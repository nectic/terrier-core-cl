FRENCHMAN Bruno Saby closed in on Paris-Dakar rally leader Ari Vatanen
yesterday in Morocco as the Finnish driver suffered two punctures in
quick succession on the fifth stage of the race between Goulimine and Es
Smara.
Saby had complained unsuccessfully on Wednesday that Vatanen and his
Citroen team were gaining an unfair advantage from radio contact with
team manager Guy Frequelin in his helicopter.
The Mitsubishi driver turned his anger into action on the twisting,
stony desert route through Morocco to finish almost eight minutes faster
than the quickest Citroen, driven by Vatanen's fellow countryman, Timo
Salonen.
Vatanen, who had started with an overnight cushion of more than 14
minutes over Salonen, came in almost nine minutes slower than Saby. He
is now just under 10 minutes ahead of the Frenchman, with Salonen third,
13 minutes behind.
In the motorcycles section, Austrian KTM rider Heinz Kinigadner
continued his monopoly of the rally, stretching his lead over the Cagiva
of Spain's Jordi Arcarons to more than 26 minutes.

MURRAY Wallace, GHK's Glasgow wing forward, has found that his
misfortunes with injury are in inverse proportion to his potential as a
prospect for rugby's higher flights. Damage to knee ligaments is the
latest addition to his catalogue of injuries.
All was going well for Wallace when he went on Scotland's tour to the
South Pacific in 1993, even though he did not break into the Test team,
but since then his career has been blighted. As GHK captain in 1993-94,
he played less rugby than he missed, and this season has been little
better.
His current injury is expected to keep him out rugby for at least
three weeks. He will thus miss GHK's national league matches against
Edinburgh Academicals and Stirling County later this month as well as
the friendly against Heriot's tomorrow at Old Anniesland.
GHK's back row will be without Craig Brown as well as Wallace. Brown
is in Montevideo with the Penguins for the Uruguay sevens, as is Gary
Parker, the Melrose back of many parts.
Like Wallace, Murray Rudkin, the Watsonian lock who had played for
Edinburgh at the age of 19, has been afflicted by injury over the past
year and a half. The 21-year-old was out of rugby last season after a
knee operation, and his first-team appearances in the past four months
have been intermittent. Most recently, an ankle injury in Watsonians'
Christmas Eve match against Heriot's has sidelined him from his club's
visit to Stirling.
Watsonians field their latest antipodean recruit, Nick Pearce, at full
back for the Bridgehaugh match. The newcomer has already played under-19
representative rugby for Queensland.
Making a shorter journey for a change of environment, Mark Beal,
formerly with Greenock Wanderers, will have his debut for Glasgow
Academicals on the left wing against Jed-Forest at Riverside Park.
Melrose have had to enlist David Shiel at scrum half for the Border
League match against Selkirk at the Greenyards. Shiel is needed in his
schooldays' role as Melrose are without Bryan Redpath, Richie Oliver,
and Parker. Redpath is in the Scotland A team to meet Italy the same
day, Oliver is injured, and the ubiquitous Parker is in Uruguay.

UKRAINE'S family connection triumphed once again at the Hopman Cup in
Perth yesterday as Andrei Medvedev and Natalia Medvedeva ousted the
top-seeded Czech Republic to reach tomorrow's final.
The Czech pairing of Jana Novotna and Petr Korda, bidding to put their
country into the final for the third time in four years, were
unexpectedly toppled in their respective singles rubbers to give Ukraine
an unassailable lead in the best-of-three tie.
Medvedeva held off a Novotna fightback to win the women's singles 6-1,
6-7, 6-3. Her brother then won 7-6, 7-6 against Korda.
The 'dead' doubles rubber was contested over just one 'pro' set, in
which the winners have to reach eight games, with the Czech pair winning
8-3.
Ukraine meet the winners of today's semi-final between Germany and
France.
* BRITAIN'S Jeremy Bates went out of the Australian hard-court
championship in Adelaide yesterday, beaten 7-6, 6-4 by local favourite
and eighth seed Mark Woodforde, who now meets Russian holder Yevgeny
Kafelnikov .
Jim Courier kept up his chances of his first tournament success for 17
months. The American eased into the quarter-finals, 6-3, 6-4 against
Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic.

* JOHN Laing, the Gala lock, who was only a minute or two away from a
cap four years ago, has retired from rugby because of torn ligaments in
his back.
Laing, formerly with Corstophine, has played 114 times for Gala since
his debut against Jed-Forest more than six years ago. He also had seven
games for the South, and as a stand-by replacement for Scotland's 1990
international against Argentina, he was warming up in preparation for
going on to the field, though that was as close as he got to a cap.
Gala will lose also their sponsors, Keyline, at the end of the season.
The builders' merchants have supported the Netherdale club for eight
seasons.

SCOTS-BORN rugby player Gord MacKinnon has been dropped by Canada
because of a row over a drunk bus driver.
Now the flanker, who has played in two World Cups, will miss the match
of his dreams against Scotland at Murrayfield later this month.
MacKinnon said: ''I'm being punished for speaking out on behalf of the
players. The Canadian management branded me disruptive. Now I'll miss
the game I've been looking forward to all my rugby life.''
He played in last month's Test clashes in England and France and was
virtually assured of a place in the side to face Scotland on January 21
-- his adopted country's first ever appearance at Murrayfield.
It was on the French leg of the trip that trouble erupted. Speaking
from his home in British Columbia, MacKinnon said: ''Our French coach
driver was always drinking before taking us anywhere, especially at
lunchtimes.
''Obviously, this was worrying, so I made representations on behalf of
the team to our tour management and they promised to sort things out.
''But the very next day the driver downed a whole bottle of wine
immediately before a four-hour journey. The bus was weaving all over the
road, and again I complained.
''But the coach, Ray Skett, told me to keep quiet and concentrate on
playing rugby. He told me I was being disruptive.
''There were other minor team matters that I brought up with Skett
from time to time, but he thought his authority was being challenged.
''It's clear now that I've been punished by being snubbed for the
Scotland game.''
Firefighter MacKinnon, who learned of his omission on Wednesday, said:
''The phone hasn't stopped ringing with calls of support from guys in
the squad.
'' They're all pretty cut up about it and some have even promised to
pull out of the trip as a protest.
''Ever since I started playing rugby seriously, my one big ambition
was to play against Scotland at Murrayfield.
''I played in the World Sevens there three years ago, when the stadium
was only half rebuilt, and I was so excited about playing in the
finished article.''
MacKinnon was given strong support last night by Canadian lock Norm
Hadley. The London-based player said: ''Gord is the victim of petty
politics and his omission is a disgrace.
''He is far and away the best back-row man in Canada, and every man in
the squad is angry at what has happened. He has our full support.''
Hadley added: ''The affair will certainly not help our preparations
for Murrayfield, because the minds of many players will not be on the
game.''
MacKinnon, who still has family in Glasgow, was close to tears as he
said: ''I was even thinking about bringing my wife and two kids over for
the game. It meant so much to all of us.
''I'm 36 now and I'll never get another chance to play against my
native country.''
Coach Skett was not available for comment at the Canadian RFU office
in Ontario.

URUGUAYAN midfielder Juan Ferriera could become a #250,000 Dundee
United signing today. The 23-year-old from Defensor, who played a trial
for United against Hibs reserves earlier this week, had talks with
manager Ivan Golac yesterday and a final decision on the deal is likely
when the Tannadice board assemble for their weekly meeting this morning.
United have already pulled in money to finance the deal by selling
goalkeeper Alan Main to St Johnstone for #150,000.
Golac has also revealed that they could lose another keeper soon, as
he has given Brechin City permission to talk to Stuart Garden.
* COLIN McDonald received the perfect pick-me-up for the chest virus
that kept him out of the Falkirk team last weekend . . . by being named
the Bell's Young Player of the Month for December.
* ALLOA tomorrow will become the centre of attraction for Scottish
football. The draw for the third round of the Tennents Scottish Cup will
be made at Recreation Park immediately after their tie with Ross County.
* EAST Stirling have been left out in the cold with only one home
Saturday match over the next five weeks.
Stirlingshire police will not allow the third division club -- their
last home attendance was only 436 -- to play in the town when Falkirk
also have a home match.
Falkirk meet Rangers at Brockville on Saturday, January 14, and Hearts
on Saturday, February 4, and Shire's home games against Montrose and
Albion Rovers have been broughr forward to the Friday evenings.
With two blank Scottish Cup Saturdays, East Stirling have reached
agreement with Ross County to switch their league fixture from the
Highlands to Falkirk on January 21.
* IN an effort to encourage their fans to travel to their temporary
home at Broadwood, Airdrie will lay on free transport for their next
three home games, against St Johntone, St Mirren, and Clydebank. In
addition, youngsters going to the game with an adult will be allowed in
free.
Meanwhile, the SFA are almost certain to hold an investigation into
the alleged head-butting offence involving Airdrie captain Jimmy
Sandison. A report from the supervisor at the match on Monday has been
received and it is likely that both Airdrie and Hamilton will be asked
for their views.
* THE Scottish League have released a further listing of re-scheduled
matches. They are:
Tuesday, January 17. Premier division -- Falkirk v Partick Thistle,
Kilmarnock v Motherwell. Second division -- Clyde v Stirling Albion,
Dumbarton v Morton. Third division -- Arbroath v Forfar.
Wednesday, January 18. Premier division -- Hearts v Hibs.

CHINA'S so-called Ma's Army, which overran the world of
middle-distance running on an alleged diet of caterpillar fungus and
turtles' blood, has gone AWOL.
Ma Junren and his wife are in hospital, seriously ill after a crash in
which he pranged one of the three Mercedes cars which his athletes won
at the 1993 World championhips in Stuttgart. But Ma's most illustrious
protege, Wang Junxia, who won two world titles in Germany, said
yesterday that she and 15 colleagues had rebelled against his
dictatorial style.
''We simply could not take it any longer,'' said Wang from the
defectors' independent training base. ''We had absolutely no freedom. We
were all on the brink of going crazy. The pressure was too intense. We
could not take it. The Ma Family Army has been disbanded and will never
be brought back together.''
The 21-year-old Wang won the 10,000 metres title in Stuttgart, slashed
42 seconds from the world record a month later at China's national
games, then destroyed the 3000m world record the same week. The
following month she won the World Cup marathon in Spain.

RACING'S rulers yesterday admitted that they would have to consider
closely plans for a new all-weather track at Kempton Park. Racecourse
Holdings Trust, the new owners of the Sunbury course, are sounding out
the possibility of floodlight racing on an artificial surface similar to
that at Wolverhampton.
''It certainly looks an interesting development,'' said the British
Horseracing Board's racing director, Paul Greeves. ''But all sorts of
questions will need to be answered. Are they proposing to transfer
fixtures or add fixtures? Where would the funding come from?''
Kempton was one of the first courses to be put forward as a possible
venue for all-weather racing, but previous owners United Racecourses
quickly dropped the idea. Instead, the new-style sport was taken up by
Lingfield, Southwell and Wolverhampton. An architect has already drawn
up plans for the project, which will cause minimum interference to the
present track.

SCOTLAND'S premier annual sailing event, the Rover Series, was
launched at the London International Boat Show in Earls Court yesterday
with the promise of a broader spread of classes in an effort to attract
a record entry for the twenty-first staging of the regatta.
At least 13 different divisions will compete on the waters of Loch
Fyne off Tarbert over the May bank holiday weekend, May 25 to 30.
The Clyde Cruising Club, the event's organisers, are looking to a
further expansion of the Sportboat Class, which was introduced last year
to provide racing for the new generation of lightweight, high
performance boats which do not necessarily reach the safety standard
required for overnight offshore races.
The One Design classes which have been strongly contested in past
Scottish Series events also can expect record turnouts in the popular
Sigma 33 and Sonata classes.
A J35 Class looks set to become established for this year's Rover
Series with 10 boats promised by the brand's importers, including two
each from Holland and Belgium.
The Etchells Class might also break new ground for the regatta as
attempts are currently being mustered to provide class racing for this
popular 22ft One Design dayboat.
Taking their lead from the very successful Ford week, run biennially
in Cork, and seizing the opportunity presented by the substantial
refurbishment of the south quay at Tarbert, a new tented village will
now be the focus for the lively social scene.

San Diego
JOHN Daly lit up another cigarette and amiably jotted down a couple of
autographs before answering the questions everyone in golf wants to
know: has he turned over a new leaf since his suspension last summer,
and is he going to behave himself?
''My New Year resolution is to forget the past. It feels good to be
back,'' said the 28-year-old big hitter, who admits to having put on
15lb and now weighs in at 15 stone.
He had more time than perhaps he would have liked to answer probing
inquiries before the first round of the Mercedes championships (the Old
Tournament of Champions) was held over until today because the par-72,
7022-yard La Costa course was like green blancmange after torrential
rain storms.
Daly will tee off today just in front of Greg Norman who, like Fred
Couples, Johnny Miller and other 1994 winners, express guarded sympathy
with the 1991 US PGA champion's drinking problems, despite his unwise
claim last year that there was widespread drug abuse among them.
He has not played competitively since August 28, after which he was
suspended by the then US Tour commissioner, Deane Beman, for a series of
drink and temper-related incidents, including signing incorrect cards,
hitting practice balls dangerously close to spectators' heads, and
scuffling with an elderly fan in a car park at the World Series.
''My parents brought me up very strictly in a small Arkansas town, and
when I got thrown into the bigger world, sometimes I didn't know how to
react.
''Since mid-November I've been exercising for about one-and-a-half
hours each day and my trainer had to slow me down. So I haven't lost any
flexibility,'' continued Daly, whose near 100% arc is the wonder of the
golfing world. ''If I keep up my stretching workouts, I should be in
better condition than I was, because I want to do things a lot slower
than previously.
''I'm just going to play golf and I don't want to talk about my
problems. I'm very fresh, but I think putting will be a problem at
first.''
Daly claims that December 21 heralded two years of sobriety, but his
future conduct will demonstrate whether he has beaten the bottle. The
big test will come after some catastrophe on the links.
* RYDER Cup player Barry Lane birdied seven of the final 11 holes
yesterday to earn himself a share of the Bell's Cup first-round lead in
George, South Africa, the Englishman coming home in 31 for a
six-under-par 66.
Americans Mike Board and Pat Horgan also putted well on the
lightning-fast Fancourt Estate club greens to shoot 66s.
Lane, playing at the back of the 144-strong field, found himself one
over after seven holes. But four successive birdies hauled him up the
leaderboard and prompted further birdies at the fourteenth, fifteenth,
and eighteenth.
''Having not played since last November, I'm pretty happy with my
round,'' said Lane. ''But I don't know where my game has come from and I
could go out tomorrow and shoot 80.''
Tournament favourite Ernie Els carded a 69. Leading scores (South
African unless otherwise stated):
66 -- P Horgan (USA), M Board (USA), B Lane (Britain).
67 -- N Henning.
68 -- P Jonas, M Welch (Britain), R Goosen, S Little (Britain), W
Player, I Hutchings.
69 -- M Archer (Britain), K Duke (USA), A Park, M Scholz, S Tinning
(Denmark), D James, R Fletcher, J Daley (USA), B Pritz, R Whittaker
(Britain), M Green, E Els, M McNulty (Zimbabwe), A Roestof.
70 -- S Dunlap (USA), S Isley (USA), B Piercy (Canada), I Gooch (USA),
M Gortana (Italy), M Ure (Britain).

SIR BOB Reid has secured another high-profile job for when his present
contract as chairman of British Rail comes to an end on March 31.
On June 27, he is to become chairman of Sears, the major retailing
group which includes familiar High Street names like Wallis, Richards,
Dolcis and Saxone as well as Selfridges and Freemans mail order.
Sir Bob will join the Sears board in April as chairman designate,
succeeding Geoffrey Maitland Smith at the group's annual meeting in
June.
The exact amount of time he will spend at Sears has yet to be decided
but it is likely to be less than the present chairman, who was chief
executive before becoming executive chairman and now part-time chairman.
Mr Maitland Smith's salary in the last financial year was #231,000,
much higher than the #131,000 Sir Bob receives in his present post. He
is unlikely to receive the same as Mr Maitland Smith but a Sears
spokeswoman could not say how much he will be paid.
Sir Bob has been chairman of British Rail since 1990, having spent his
career with Shell, finishing as chairman and chief executive of Shell
UK. Born in Cupar, Fife, Sir Bob attended St Andrews University, where
he graduated in political economy and modern history. He has been
awarded honorary degrees by St Andrews and the University of Aberdeen.
He is a director of Bank of Scotland, chairman of London Electricity and
Chancellor of Robert Gordon University.
The new appointment will be a move into calmer waters for Sir Bob, 60,
after the rigours of five years as boss of British Rail, arguably one of
the toughest jobs in the country, leaving more time for his passion of
golf which he plays one handed following the loss of his right arm in a
horrific childhood accident.

IN an age when the SFA has opened the doors, even laid out the red
carpet, for the men carrying the TV cameras but, more significantly, for
the accountants carrying the million-pound cheques at their backs, it
must be time for the authority to have a fresh look at the use of TV
evidence in disciplinary cases.
It is widely suspected, anyway, that the association has long since
put into practice the acceptance of such filmed evidence, but has used
it along with the more convenient and official supervisor's report. When
the match referee has missed or ignored a blatant piece of violence, it
has become the fashion to look to the report from the referee in the
stand to bring the culprit to court.
Maybe this assumption is unjustified but it does appear to many of us
that on most occasions when this has happened it has been preceded,
coincidentally of course, by TV coverage of the incident which has
caused something of a stir in the pubs, clubs and homes of the football
intelligentsia. Then, while strenuously denying that the eye of the
camera has had any persuasive effect on their actions, the gaffers up on
the Hill announce that they await the referee supervisor's report to see
if they are able to make a move against the wrongdoer.
In a sense, this modus operandi has been succcessful in that it has
brought to justice many a miscreant who otherwise would have been able
to escape his due punishment because the match referee had not spotted
his sin. However, it is difficult to recall this method of disciplinary
action being used when there were no television pictures to back up the
views expressed by the supervisor.
It seems, if memory serves me right, that the supervisor has been
called into play nearly always on occasions when television has caught a
particularly unsavoury incident with such glaring clarity that the SFA,
quite rightly, have felt that action simply had to be taken.
This is vigorously denied, of course, because the authorities stand
firmly behind their opinion that there must not be trial by television
in their football domain. But it is an outmoded concept, anyway. Every
referee, every player and many managers are subjected to trial by the
box on a regular basis nowadays and, indeed, Graeme Souness was once
caught breaking an SFA suspension when the camera caught him in the
Ibrox tunnel.
The argument most often voiced against the use of video evidence is
that it could be carried to an extreme, whereby goals that were wrongly
awarded could be disallowed in retrospect, that games could be forced
into replays as a consequence of 'unjust' decisions by referees.
All of that is exaggerated piffle. It would not put exhaustive demands
on administrators, especially an association which prides itself on its
efficiency, to come up with a system which would differentiate between
happenings within the normal parameters of football and behaviour
outside the acceptable.
Excessive violent actions, if missed by the referee but caught on
camera, deserve to be called to question at the very least and, if a
disciplinary committee found that the accused was clearly guilty, proper
punishment should be imposed. And an admission that TV evidence was
instrumental in achieving the verdict should be forthcoming.
That would mean -- before the claimants for the other side jump in
again -- that players from the more prominent teams who are much more
often seen on the box would have a far greater chance of being caught
than others in untelevised contests. But those involved in the big
matches also get paid more for their prominence and happily accept the
plaudits that go with greater exposure. It is merely a modern
manifestation of the old saw about getting out of the kitchen if you
can't stand the heat.
It is about time the SFA did the decent thing and admitted that telly
has its part to play, as well as millions to impart.

ENGLAND A will be looking to Ian Salisbury for more spin heroics today
as they press for victory over an Indian Youth XI in Bombay. Salisbury
took four wickets in 18 balls yesterday, giving himself an overall haul
of six for 48 as the Indian youngsters were bowled out for 199.
After England made 204 second time around on a turning pitch, the
Indians were 21 for one at the close -- still needing a further 268 to
win -- with a Glen Chapple off-cutter already proving too much for
opener Zubin Bharucha.
England manager Phil Neale explained that Salisbury had learned from
Australian Shane Warne the sort of standards he has to attain for
success at Test level. Salisbury's six Tests to date -- two each in the
last three years -- have produced only 15 wickets at an average of 54.
But the 24-year-old leg-spinner showed yesterday that he is developing
the consistency, as well as the potency, that he needs to resurrect his
Test career.
Neale has already noted how Salisbury has added a Warne-like capacity
to switch from bowling over to around the wicket without loss of
control. Neale said: ''Alan Wells has been trying to get Ian to go
around the wicket more often as another option. When he does, it results
in him bowling a little bit quicker, because he has to aim it into the
rough outside the right-hander's leg stump.
''Today he took two wickets from around the wicket and I think he has
also realised that he has got to be a bit more consistent.''
Salisbury's perfect start to the tour was completed when he took a
wicket in four successive overs to hasten the end of the Indian Youth
innings. They lost their last five wickets for just 16 runs in less than
eight overs after Richard Stemp had ended a stubborn sixth-wicket stand
of 63 by having Samir Dighe caught at slip for 26.
The A team's second innings was a succession of delightful cameos from
the top six -- without any batsman being able to convert their admirably
positive approach into an innings of greater substance on a pitch giving
the spinners a lot of assistance. Wells led the way with 36 from 44
balls, putting on 57 in 11 overs with David Hemp. Scores:
England A 283 and 204 (A Wells 36; B Rao 5-56); Indian Youth XI 199 (A
Mazumdar 68, O Kamal 36; I Salisbury 6-48) and 21 for one.

SCOTLAND'S first professional American football team, the Scottish
Claymores, have wasted no time in establishing a Scottish identity. A
newly-designed Scottish Claymores tartan will be unveiled at Murrayfield
on Monday.
Also on Monday, head coach Lary Kuharich will reveal the identities of
the seven non-Americans who will be on his team roster for the new
season which begins with a match against Dusseldorf's Rhein Fire on
April 9. Following the final try-outs at the end of last month, he has
selected six Scots and an Englishman to make up his team. The lucky
seven will attend a training camp in Atlanta from late February to March
27.

* ABERDEEN have been set a two-match winning target to dispel finally
their crisis.
Victories over Falkirk and Partick Thistle would put together a
six-match unbeaten run and continue the Dons' revival.
Pittodrie manager Willie Miller said: ''If we can achieve this it
would remind people how well we can play. They have focused on two or
three bad performances and had dismissed us as hopeless. That certainly
is not the case.''

FOR the past 15 years the Glenfiddich international men's indoor
hockey tournament has occupied the interests of enthusiasts at this time
of year but, while the organisers may now be suffering withdrawal
symptoms, its passing has not curtailed the international programme.
The Arminen tournament in Vienna has taken on its mantel while the
Midlands of England with the DTZ tournament at Kidderminster is striving
for recognition as hosts of Britain's premier event.
In terms of quality and international appeal, the DTZ still has some
way to go before it is fully integrated into the international circuit
but at least the tournament has added an alternative to this weekend's
events.
Menzieshill, winners of two tournaments last week, carry the Saltire
south. Their group opponents include Barford Tigers, Harbourne, Swansea,
and Denmark, who will be masquerading as The Vikings. The Dundee side
will be without playmaker Bruce Cuthill through family commitments,
American Peter Jones will deputise.
In Vienna, Scottish champions MIM will be looking to win all three
group matches against Royal White Star (Belgium), Verona (Italy), and
their hosts.
The Edinburgh club can count themselves fortunate with their draw for
the second group is likely to provide the finalists with the inclusion
of Limburg (Germany), WAC Vienna, Grasshoppers (Switzerland), and
Poctowiec (Poland).
In the women's event, Edinburgh Ladies make the trip without six of
their regular squad including Great Britain players Pauline Robertson,
Diane Renilson, and Janet Jack.
In the circumstances their captain, Jackie Innes, will be more
concerned at increasing the team's competitiveness and sharpness in
preparation for the finals next month of the European championship.
In their round-robin event, they will encounter two crack German sides
-- Eintracht Frankfurt and Rot-Weiss (Munich) -- and if they can split
them in the final classification they will have exceeded expectations in
the six-team tournament.
On the domestic front, the final place in the men's promotion
play-offs will be decided at Meadowbank with Brewster Harris likely to
get the berth should they take maximum points from their two games.
In the chase for the trophy, Morgan are in the driving seat. They will
take the title should they win both their engagements, but if they
falter Livingston and EK Strathmore are poised to pounce.

RANGERS' popular Ukranian internationalist, Alexei Mikhailichenko, is
wanted by Israeli club Hapoel Petach-Tikva -- but only for a loan
period. The team currently lying third in the first division would like
the former Soviet World Cup star to boost their challenge for the title
in the second half of their season, which begins on January 28.
Although Mikhailichenko has played only one game for the Ibrox first
team this season, in October against Dundee United, he has now recovered
from the injury that has kept him on the sidelines and is in training
again. But Rangers could be agreeable to a loan arrangement, which would
let the classy midfield man get back to match fitness away from the
rigours of the premier division.
If a deal does go ahead, Mikko would be following the path taken by
his former Soviet colleague, Oleg Kuznetsov, who went from Ibrox to
Maccabi but has since moved on to Dinamo Kiev. Kuznetsov, however, went
on a full transfer and had been made available by Rangers for some time
after a severe injury in his early days with the club reduced his
effectiveness.
Mikhailichenko, on the contrary, has been very much part of the
first-team squad since he was signed from Sampdoria for #2m in July,
1991, and made 24 appearances for the first team last season, with
another 10 as a substitute. But he did not make it into the side until
October 1 this term and has since been out because of injury.
He and Trevor Steven have been training in the past couple of weeks as
they make their way back to fitness, but his return to first-team duty
may have to wait on him completing a number of reserve games en route to
full fitness.
From Israel I was told: ''Although Kuznetsov only played 11 games for
Maccabi and did not impress, Mikhailichenko has a big reputation here
and if he is available for even a loan period, Hapoel will be delighted.
It is not possible that they could afford to pay a major transfer fee
for him, but they are willing to pay #100,000 to have him for a while.''
The Ukranian, who played for the CIS in the last World Cup -- a
combination of former Soviet states -- and was in the side beaten by
Scotland in Sweden during the European Championships in 1992, has a
style and smoothness which he has managed to maintain in the hurly-burly
of the premier division. He is not the type of player who wins full
marks for work-rate, but has never let it upset him.
Meanwhile, Rangers will wait to see how Richard Gough recovers from a
chest injury sustained in the Old Firm game on Wednesday night before
thinking about a team to face Partick Thistle at Firhill tomorrow. Gough
suffered the blow early in the second half but, although he could have
left the field at that point, preferred to carry on, even if he found it
hard to breathe.
Gough has only just returned to the side after recovering from a foot
injury and had hoped to put in a series of first-team games to enhance
his match fitness.
Manager Walter Smith will also have to decide on the readiness to
return of strikers Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist, both of whom have been
missing over the holiday period.
Dundee United keeper Alan Main, who has been anxious to leave
Tannadice, was granted his wish yesterday when he joined St Johnstone
for #150,000. The move brought an immediate reaction from Saints'
first-team keeper, Andy Rhodes, who asked for a transfer.
Saints had failed to buy another United keeper, Dutchman Guido van de
Kamp, after having a bid for Main turned down, but they decided to raise
the ante for the former Scottish Under-21 internationalist. The
27-year-old has signed a two-year contract for manager Paul Sturrock
who, of course, had a long association with United.
Explaining the decision to instal Main as his No.1 keeper -- he's set
to make his debut against Airdrie tomorrow -- Sturrock said: ''Andy
Rhodes has made it clear in the past he didn't see his long-term future
lying with St Johnstone.''
Rhodes' transfer request has been granted by the Perth board and clubs
in both England and Scotland are being notified.
Main, however, is thrilled to be facing a new challenge. ''It's a
relief to be away from Tannadice.'' he said. ''It has been depressing
not being involved in the picture after around 170 games for the club. I
suppose you could say there was a clash of personalities with the
manager.''

AGAINST considerable odds, the organisers of the British Alpine Racing
Ski Clubs championships yesterday managed to run an International Ski
Federation (FIS) sanctioned junior giant slalom in Radstadt, Austria.
The lack of snow precipitated widespread doubts that these FIS races
would be run and prompted the last-minute withdrawal of the junior age
skiers from both the KPMG Scottish Alpine team and the British National
team.
This meant that the high standard of international skiers in the boys'
event, with a strong entry of Slovenians, put top-15 places out of the
reach of the remaining Scottish juniors from the Lothians Ski Racing
Association, the Scottish Ski Club, and Aberdeen Ski Club.
Only Oliver Hall (Kent) and Daniel Nelson (Alpbach) could break the
Slovenians' monopoly of the top-10 places, Hall taking third and Nelson
tenth.
The girls' giant slalom was won by Australian Jeanette Korten, who was
more than three seconds clear after two runs in the hard, icy
conditions.
Josephine Clyde (Carnwath) scored the best result of the Scottish
girls. Clyde, grand-daughter of former Cairngorm ski area chief Bob
Clyde, finished fifth.
Laura Westmacott (Edinburgh) won the under-16 age-group, placing a
creditable ninth overall after skiing fifth quickest on the first run
but making an error in the second. Junior giant slalom results:
Girls -- 1, J Korten (Australia) 1min. 47.68sec. (after two runs); 2,
J Calvert (England) 1-51.39; 3, E Hunt (England) 1-51.51. Scots -- 5, J
Clyde, 1-57.16. 9, L Westmacott, 1-58.80.
Boys -- 1, J Rebrsak (Slovenia) 1-36.82; 2, T Trdan (Slovenia)
1-38.22; 3, O Hall (England) 1-38.88.

DAVID Smith and his Perth team, holders of the Stakis Masters at
Perth, opened their defence in the 1995 event by taking two shots in the
first end against Edinburgh's Alan Westwood.
But the control which the past Scottish champions had earned was lost
in the seventh end when Westwood stole a single point to go three 3-2
ahead, and he and his team of Scott Dakers, John Paterson, and Alan
Mackay kept their nerve in the eighth to allow the Smith team only one
shot for a 3-3 tie after regulation play.
Westwood then stole a point in the extra end for a 4-3 upset victory.
In other first-round action last night, the fancied Patrick Huerlimann
from Lausanne lost 5-4 to Brian Binnie (Letham Grange) after the Binnie
team took three shots in the opening end.
But Pieter Wuest got a win for the Swiss in an extra end by a 3-2

CELTIC, who continue to suffer because of their lack of goals, are
believed to be settling on Dutch striker Pierre van Hooydonk as the
player who can transform them from a struggling premier division side
into genuine championship contenders, and the price-tag of #1.2m is
unlikely to frighten Tommy Burns who has been told he can spend up to
#4m on players.
Ideally, Celtic would prefer to buy in as many quality players as
possible with their money and it has been suggested that the manager
should go for four at #1m each, but Burns will decide on how the cash
should be spent and if van Hooydonk impresses enough a move could be on.
The Breda player has scored 110 goals in 160 matches for his club and,
in 16 league games this season, has found the net 10 times. Hooydonk
played five times for Holland's under-21 side and made his senior debut
in a match against Luxembourg just before Christmas.
He is a player who has interested Borussia Munchengladbach and
Feyenoord, who were trying to do a deal involving a player of their own
going to Breda as well as a sum of money, but Hooydonk's club would
prefer the readies. Only yesterday Burns reiterated that he could not
enter the English market because ''Celtic couldn't handle the prices
there'' but he is in a position to bid for Hooydonk.
Burns and his assistant, Billy Stark, have looked at players in
Holland and Spain and have cut a list of a dozen down to three or four.
Hooydonk, who apparently has a clause in his contract which says Breda
can't demand any more than #1.2m for him, is on the short-leet. He has
made it known he wants to play in Spain or Britain and the sooner Burns
brings in a striker, the better.
They should have beaten Rangers on Wednesday night and probably would
have had they been in possession of a proven scorer like the Dutchman,
but the recognised frontmen, Andy Walker, Simon Donnelly, and Willie
Falconer, have not been producing the finishing touches Burns and
Celtic's supporters want to see.
Against Rangers, the Parkhead side had 12 attempts at goal, three more
than Rangers, but only one on target while the Ibrox men had six.
However, Celtic scored from their only shot which actually hit the
target, but one accurate attempt out of a dozen -- Paul Byrne scored
Celtic's equaliser in 59 minutes -- is a clear indication of where
Burns' most pressing problem lies.
Rangers' stand-in Colin Scott would not have dared anticipate such a
stress-free evening before kick-off even though he wasn't the first
keeper to have had an easy time from Burns' strikers.
Celtic have won only five times in 19 league games and lost only three
times, the same number of defeats suffered by Rangers. Yet, Walter
Smith's side are 17 points ahead.
Burns' difficulty is that Celtic have drawn 11 times, and with three
points available for a win these days drawns games are much more
damaging than ever before.
Only Hibernian, who are three points better off than Celtic, have
drawn a similar amount of matches and the Easter Road club also have
been left behind in the race towards the title.
In many of these matches Celtic enjoyed a lot of possession -- they
had 53% of the ball to 47% by Rangers the other night -- and the
presence of a true predator would have ensured their current league
position would have been better than fourth. ''Yes, we are missing a
goal threat, the sort of threat Rangers have,'' Burns said.
''But everyone knows that and I am working hard towards doing
something about it.
''Goalscorers tend to cost a lot of money and I have to be certain I
am getting the right person, and also value for money.
''I need someone who will score us a goal when a game is drifting
along. That sort of player would give us a bit of stature.''
Burns added that while his need is urgent, he can't afford to be
rushed and make a bad buy which is why a player like van Hooydonk would
have to be watched again. ''We are going through a hard time but I can't
just buy because of that,'' Burns explained.
However, the manager must now consider whether it would be prudent to
proceed so cautiously or go all out and try to win the Scottish Cup
which will be starting shortly for the major clubs.
He may decide to tackle that particular competition with what he has
and, after the draw against Rangers, he is more optimistic without being
lulled into any false sense of well-being.
''It was only another draw,'' he said, ''but the manner in which they
played in the second-half offered hope.
''It isn't easy for Celtic to exist in Rangers' shadow but we have to
battle through and come out the other end. We are finding that people
like Stuart Gray and Brian McLaughlin can play. The most pleasing thing
for me at the moment is the performances of the youngsters.''
McLaughlin, who is not tall enough to be tiny, played well after
having taken the first half to bed-in and he commands crucial attributes
such as touch, awareness, and speed.
Given protection, someone so slight as McLaughlin could become a
genuine player in the Celtic tradition while Gray already seems to be a
fraction ahead.
He strode through the Old Firm contest playing at the back and, as the
game progressed, his condfidence grew. He was neither panicked nor
pressured much by either Brian Laudrup or Pieter Huistra and looked as
though he is well on the way to maturing into a quality defender.
''The composure shown in the second half was everything I wanted,''
Burns said. ''It was extemely pleasing and, now, I have to look for
consistency although I know I'm not going to get that from younger
players, who need more time.
''The team seems to be getting a better mix now and things could
develop.''

THE light went out on England's Ashes campaign yesterday -- but at
least there is a little brightness at the end of the tunnel. A last-gasp
bid to revive a contest that looked dead and buried after last week's
Melbourne massacre ended in brave failure.
With ever-darkening skies threatening a premature end to the third
Test in Sydney, captain Mike Atherton was forced to withdraw his fastest
bowlers.
And that was all the encouragement Australia -- seven wickets down at
the time -- needed to hold out for a draw which maintained their 2-0
series lead -- and guaranteed retention of cricket's oldest prize until
at least 1997.
But England have, at last, played somewhere near their potential after
weeks of under-achievement. Now, perhaps, they can use this performance
as a springboard to better results during the remaining month of the
tour.
A Test that began with England slumping to 20 for three on Sunday and
was made unforgettable by Darren Gough's spectacular first-innings
batting and bowling contributions, deserved better than a tedious final
day.
Thanks mainly to Angus Fraser, it had just about everything in the end
-- except the result Atherton most wanted.
There was controversy, with home captain Mark Taylor surviving a
run-out incident. Drama came courtesy of Fraser's four-wicket burst in
the space of 13 deliveries.
Heroics, from Australia's point of view, were provided by tailenders
Shane Warne and Tim May. And there was even farce, with another over
being bowled at 7.24pm after most of the players had shaken hands on a
draw.
The main feeling for England, though, was inevitably one of
disappointment. Thanks to their poor performances in Brisbane and
Melbourne, the Ashes are out of reach, even though two Tests still
remain.
''If we play to our potential, we've got the ability to beat
Australia,'' said Atherton.
All results were possible when Australia, set 449 for victory, resumed
on 139 for no wicket.
But some tight England bowling before lunch and the net loss of seven
overs because of early afternoon rain effectively left the home side
with only a draw to aim at.
It seemed a simple target for them when century-maker Taylor was still
there with just 31 overs remaining.
He might, however, have been given out before lunch had umpire Darrell
Hair called for TV replays instead of making up his own mind.
Hair decided that Australia's captain had beaten Devon Malcolm's
return and rejected England's run-out appeal.
In fact, the verdict might have gone against Taylor, judging from
television evidence, but the third umpire was not asked for a ruling.
Atherton said of the incident: ''Whether or not Taylor was out is
immaterial to me. If the technology is there, it should be used.''
A little help from above, initially at least, helped to redress the
balance. For a docile pitch was freshened up by another light afternoon
shower and that, combined with the second new ball, enabled England to
put Australia under real pressure.
Taylor, shouldering arms, was bowled by Malcolm and, with deliveries
starting to zip through, the home team crumbled from 239 for one to 292
for seven as Fraser found a succession of outside edges.
Warne and May joined forces when a minimum of 18.1 overs remained --
and, suddenly, the odds favoured England.
''Had it not gone dark, I think we would have got closer to victory,''
said Atherton.
The mandatory last 15 overs began 84 minutes later than scheduled
because of a combination of England's slow over-rate and the provision
to make up an hour of the time lost to rain.
''I would have bowled Malcolm and Gough, but I couldn't take the
chance of the batsmen being offered the light,'' explained Atherton.

FRANK Bruno will return to the ring after nearly a year's absence in a
10-round heavyweight fight against Puerto-Rican Rodolpho Marin at the
West of England Exhibition Centre, Shepton Mallet, on February 18.
It will be his first appearance under new promoter Frank Warren and if
he wins Bruno is lined up for his fourth world-title chance, against
Oliver McCall in early summer.
McCall, who took the World Boxing Council version of the title from
Lennox Lewis, is scheduled to make his first defence against veteran
Larry Holmes in April.
Bruno, who has ended a 13-year association with Mickey Duff, said at
yesterday's announcement of the fight in Bristol: ''This is my last
chance, so I can't afford any slip-ups.''
His only contest since he lost to Lewis in October, 1993 was the
following March when he beat Jesse Ferguson in the first round in
Birmingham. He was scheduled to meet Ray Mercer in Hong Kong last
October, but the show fell through.
Marin has won 20 fights, 16 inside the distance, and lost three times
-- against former world champion Riddick Bowe, Tyrell Biggs, and Joe
Hipp in his last contest in November.

Ross Finlay test drives the Peugeot 306.
JUST by chance, I have recently been driving a fair selection of
middle-ranking family saloons. They all have their attractions and
otherwise, but I was struck by the fact that, while most of them offer
standards of handling and ride which are fine for ordinary brisk-pace
driving, they begin to seem a bit ragged if you feel more like ''having
a go''.
One which kept its composure more completely than the others was the
Peugeot 306 Sedan. French suspension designers have always been
remarkably efficient at striking the delicate balance between cornering
prowess and ride quality, even when their cars are under pressure. It is
not so much that they have -- in the case of family saloons --
particularly original ideas about basic suspension design. The point is
that their fine-tuning and, I suppose, thousands of miles of
seat-of-the-pants test driving beat the companies who rely too much on
theory and computer simulations hands down.
This mixture of top-class handling and ride has been a feature of many
Peugeots over the years. I remember a neat little 203 saloon which
regularly outpaced much more modern cars in the 1300cc class of the
Scottish autocross championship. A 404 I used for a while soldiered
happily on with a very high mileage on the clock. Just how well a 404
could go on rough roads was demonstrated by the tremendous East African
Safari performances of Bert Shankland, the expatriate Scot who was
somehow never given the acknowledgement back home which his sporting
achievements merited.
And there was a 205 test car which I enjoyed so much because of the
way it went on some of my favourite cross-country routes that I decided
to buy one of my own. With all these models, and more, it was not so
much a case of taking the car by the scruff of the neck, as simply that
each of them responded progressively as the cornering speeds rose and
the surfaces deteriorated.
You rarely think that way about diesels, but the 306 Sedan SLDT was an
improvement, going quickly, over several direct rivals which I had
previously found perfectly OK at slightly lower averages on country
roads. Pressed harder, those other cars tended to lose the feeling of
body control and handling ''flow'' which the Peugeot maintained
regardless.
Peugeot does not often get down into the bargain basement. The SLDT
comes at #11,865, using the very successful 1.9-litre turbo diesel
engine which peaks at 92bhp and has excellent mid-range torque. It mixes
standard test figures like 0-60mph in about 12.5 seconds and a maximum
around 112mph with very strong pull at modest engine revs. The fuel
consumption returns range from 64mpg at 56mph to 45 at 75 and 37mpg
around town, but as always with turbo diesels I suspect that owners like
the feel of the meaty acceleration and never quite get the economy a
lighter-footed approach would produce.
Some critics regard the Sedan as not nearly as good looking as the 306
hatchback, but that is hardly comparing like with like, when you take
into account the Sedan's vastly better luggage space. It also has better
rear passenger space than the hatchback, thanks partly to the revised
roofline. In fact, the Sedan is roomier than most of its rivals,
although there is no doubt that the latest designs from the Far East are
getting to grips with this problem.
While the performance and economy figures are very good, the way the
Sedan handles out on the open road is one of its great attractions. Its
ride and cornering remain secure when the road surfaces degenerate into
bumps and ripples, or even broken patches.
The rest of the family tushed and dratted when Armand Peugeot built
his first car in 1889, believing that the horseless carriage craze would
never come to anything. But they soon came round to his way of thinking,
and over the generations must have become -- unlike their one-time rival
Alexandre Darracq, who never learned to drive his own cars and hated
being chauffeured -- pretty keen drivers, and not just manufacturers,
themselves.

IF you are one of the many people for whom the New Year brings a
resolve to get fit then David Lloyd Leisure will be interested in you.
Health and fitness clubs traditionally see a surge of interest in
January and David Lloyd is no exception.
Up until now David Lloyd Leisure has set up and run clubs in the
Greater London area but last October it opened its first club outside
London on a 15 acre site at Renfrew near Glasgow. In the absence of any
competition the club has exceeded the company's own expectations
operating 20% above its budgeted level.
There were 968 members signed up before the doors opened and currently
there are 3,475 members. The drop-out rate at 11% was lower than the
group average of 18% helped by the lower fees and the fact that all
court charges are now incorporate into the membership fee providing even
better value for regular users.
As usual the price of goods and services is cheaper outside London and
fitness is no exception. The average fees at Renfrew are a #198 one-off
joining fee and #36 monthly subscription. This is much lower than the
#276 and #60 respectively, paid at Finchley in north London. As such the
group needs to attract more members to the Renfrew centre if it is to
make the same return on its investment.
A full year's contribution from the Renfrew club helped David Lloyd
Lesiure to report 35% better annual profits of #7.6m. Higher membership
coupled with lower debt as a result of the flotation proceeds were
behind the profit improvement. Earnings per share rose by 17% to 12.67p
and a final dividend of 2.2p is proposed taking the full year
shareholders' payment to 3.65p. Gearing rose to 40% from 12% in the
previous year reflecting the development programme. A mixture of bank
facilities and positive cashflow is used to finance the development
programme which
Although the group aims to open two new clubs per year it also intends
to maintain double digit growth rates in its existing clubs. Last year,
underlying growth was 12%. By the financial year-end, the group had
24,500 members with 84% membership renewal.
This was achieved, space permitting, by providing extending existing
gym space, putting in badminton courts alongside tennis, providing
larger swimming pools and offering new services such as the day nursery
and in the case of Eastbourne, ten-pin bowling. The potential for a new
tennis hall at Renfrew is currently being assessed.
The Renfrew club is to be the model for further expansion outside
London. Construction of clubs at Birmingham and Bristol is currently
taking place with a view to opening later this year. In addition, a
stand-alone gym is due to open in a business park in Reading. If this is
successful then further clubs could be opened on similar sites around
the country.
Planning applications for new leisure clubs have been lodged with the
relevant authorities in Manchester and Cardiff. Edinburgh, Leeds and
Newcastle have also been earmarked as potential new sites.
David Lloyd Lesiure aims to provide relatively affordable health and
fitness activities in a family-orientated environment, what it describes
as ''a five star facility with a three star price''. As recently as five
years ago the clubs were predominatly geared towards tennis. All its
centres now have a day nursery school and provide a range of services
such as sun beds hairdressing, sports shops and newsagents.
The fact that the clubs have tended to be about 30% cheaper than the
competition makes the attractive to the general public and local
planning authorities. Once the initial joining fee is paid the monthly
subscription allows free use of all facilities except courts. Exercise
classes are also included in the monthly charge.
Given what they believe to be a unique service, chairman David Lloyd
is confident about the group's future growth prospects. He anticipates
significant growth in the current year both from existing clubs and new
openings. Taxable profits in the current year are expected to reach #9m.

THERE is no sign that higher taxes and UK interest rates are dampening
consumers' willingness to spend if the latest trading reports from the
High Street are typical. This despite much talk of the lack of a ''feel
good'' factor among consumers.
John Richards, retail analyst at NatWest Markets, said he belived that
''overall numbers will show that yet again it was a record Christmas but
not an exciting, wonderful one''. He added that sales volumes were
likely to be up 2% to 3% and margin pressure, although in evidence, was
probably less than in the previous two years.
Boots, operator of Britain's largest chemists chain along with other
trading formats, yesterday reported a 6.1% sales increase for its retail
businesses in the three months to end December. Sir James Blyth said the
result was ''excellent'' given the fragility of the retail market.
Trading picked up in December after what was described as ''extremely
sluggish'' demand in October and November.
The sales growth masked mixed performances in the various businesses.
Boots Opticians recorded the best growth with underlying sales up 5.6%.
The business benefited from more advertising and the new larger
practices within Boots The Chemists stores.
Halfords continued to trade well, with good rises across most product
categories. Cycles and cycle accessories were notably strong, with sales
up 15%. Howeve,r the late arrival of cold winter weather depressed
demand for items such as car batteries.
It is harder for Boots the Chemists to grow from its existing base but
even so, underlying sales growth was 4.1% in the period. The company
views this as a good result against the backdrop of lower price
inflation, down by almost half a percentage point to 1.7%. Cosmetics,
toiletries and dispensing grew by 10% but over-the-counter healthcare
rose by only 1.7% due to the high level of sales resulting from the flu
epidemic in 1993.
There were encouraging signs of progress in the DIY business, with AG
Stanley and Do-It-All improving sales, by 3.8% in the case of Do It All,
despite less selling space as a result of the disposal programme. On the
downside, mild weather adversely affected demand for fashion clothing in
Childrens' World and its sales fell by almost 2%.
The fierce competition in UK food retailing has been well documented,
but it is still possible to make progress as yesterday's trading
statement from William Morrison shows. The Bradford-based supermarkets
group reported a 4.9% improvement in like-for-like takings in the five
weeks ending January 1, 1995. If sales from new stores are included then
the growth rate climbs to 16.8%.
Demand was strongest in produce, non-foods and petrol but for the
second consecutive year, there were disapponting sales of wines, spirits
and tobacco. Overall, trading in the week before Christmas was said to
have ''easily beaten'' previous records.
On Wednesday, the Next clothing chain announced better than expected
sales in the run-up to Christmas. This prompted City analysts to inch up
their 1994/95 profit forecasts to around #102m compared with the #73.5m
made last year.
Sales in Next Retail rose by 17% in the period August i, 1994, to
December 24, 1994 from 2% more selling space. Sales were boosted by a
conscious decision to reduce the gross margin by about 1%. This resulted
in a 3% cut in the average unit selling price.
A single range is now available in both the High Street outlets and
the directory. Sales in Next Directory were more than 35% ahead of the
comparable period in 1993, with growth in excess of 10% in customer
numbers. The current January sale is said to be progressing well, with
the company confident that it will clear the bulk of its sale stock by
the end of this week. New season merchandise is on sale from Monday.

SHAREHOLDERS in British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television
venture, have come down to earth since the company made its stock market
debut in London and New York on December 8.
The shares had been offered at 256p, which was at the top end of the
previously disclosed range of 233p to 268p because of the heavy demand,
and immediately went to an 11p premium. Yesterday, though, they fell 10p
to around 245p despite some bullish news about the level of subscribers.
Not too much should be read into this perhaps but there were analysts at
the time who felt the issue was over-priced.
There was, however, plenty of cheer from Sky Television so far as
viewing figures are concerned. It has added a net 180,000 direct to home
subscribers in the last three months of 1994. Of these new subscribers,
more than 70% have signed up for all Sky's premium channels and are
paying the top monthly subscription rate of #22.99.
The company reports that the high level of sales in this period has
included a new record for a single week's sales of 37,241 which was
achieved in the third week of December.
Sky's home subscriber base has increased by 7% from 2.64 million to
2.82 million over the three-month period. At the same time, there has
been a decrease in the level of subscription cancellations from 12% in
the second six months of 1993 to 10% in the second half of 1994, despite
the October 1994 price increase. For December alone, the cancellation
rate was 7% compared to 8% a year ago.
Research figures for January also show that the total number of homes
that subscribe to Sky is above four million for the first time.
It all sounds pretty healthy. As Sky TV's chief executive Sam Chisholm
points out, the growth in subscriptions, in part at any rate, is a
result of an enhanced profile as a result of the recent successful
flotation.
Yesterday morning, though, BSkyB was the second most actively traded
stock as sellers emerged. It was the penultimate day of the shares
stabilisation period during which advisers buy and sell shares in the
market to smooth out initial volatilities.
However, stockbroker Henderson Crosthwaite's sector analyst yesterday
issued a sell recommendation suggesting that the #4400m valuation put on
the company at the 256p offer price was too high.
It considers that without market support, the share price will decline
to the 200p level, where the market capitalisation would be #3400m,
though Henderson itself values BSkyB at only #2600m. The analyst
considers that the company will be unable to sustain the rate of profit
growth implied by a market valuation of #4400m.
That said, dominance in the two most lucrative areas of subscription
TV, films and sport, is expected to ensure success. It is not the
company, but the value placed upon it that is criticised. This caution
stems from profits depending on continuous growth in penetration via
cable and satellite. On that score the projections for penetration by
Henderson's analyst are lower than most market estimates.
Sky penetration is forecast to rise to 27% of homes by 2000-01 from
15% in 1993-94.
There are also worries that competition from the cable industry and
future terrestrial TV will drive programming costs higher with few
potential high earning new services that could be added.
It is argued that new services will anyway be more expensive to
introduce and constraints on the capacity to add new services will make
it harder to introduce price increases which are more acceptable to
subscribers if a new package is being sold.
Caution is also expressed about what happens early in the next century
when there is a big jump in programming costs as a result of the
renegotiation of the film contracts. It could lead to a period of profit
stagnation or decline as the company adjusts to the new cost regime
though this risk could be offset by judicious investment of cash flow.
Forecast profits for BSkyB for 1994/95 are #194m, rising to #264m the
following year and #321m 1996/97.
Henderson's assessment of BSkyB's prospects and valuation may be
somewhat less than the general market view and may well be wide of the
mark. However, some of the the initial euphoria after the marketing hype
was bound to wear off.

<HEADLINE>Banks seeking action from fund managers in derivatives cases</HEADLINE>

BANKS are squaring up to force fund managers to disclose the names of
their clients in a move to identify who foots the bill if someone
defaults in a derivatives contract.
''Some hedge funds are very volatile and could lose significant sums
in a short time. If they default, it is a question of who is left
holding the responsibility when the counter party is gone,'' one senior
banker said.
Hedge funds, which hit the headlines when George Soros's Quantum fund
bet against the pound in 1992, are highly leveraged investors who
regularly use derivatives contracts, financial instruments based on
underlying products such as Government bonds, interest rates and
commodities, to enhance profits.
The market for derivatives is estimated to be worth around $35
trillion worldwide.
Hedge funds and derivatives are regarded with deep suspicion by
regulators after the spectacular collapse of Orange County's investment
fund in the United States and derivatives losses from household names
such as cosmetics giant Procter &amp; Gamble.
British companies are not immune. Pharmaceutical group Glaxo admitted
at its last annual general meeting that it got into derivatives
contracts ''without understanding what they meant''.
In 1991, banks were forced to swallow losses and pride after a British
court ruled that the London local authority of Hammersmith and Fulham
was not liable to pay out on interest rate swap agreements because it
was not authorised to deal in swaps.
''Institutions who are providing these instruments need to have a risk
assessment of the people they are dealing with, and whether they are
entitled to deal and whether they know the downside risk of what they
are doing,'' the senior banker said.
The Bank of England, which regulates banking but not asset management
activities, said it is in talks with banks and fund management
companies, but that the issue was a ''routine regulatory item.''
''It is in the banks' interest to know who their counter party is. If
they do not know then they cannot measure their risk accurately. What we
are trying to do is to encourage the participants to reach a solution
acceptable to all parties,'' said a spokesman for the Bank of England.
However, fund managers are refusing the play the banks' game.
''They are trying to get the banks to police the funds, and it won't
happen,'' said one London fund manager.
The banks say regulation and naming asset management companies'
clients would help prevent the risk of the collapse of a counterparty in
a deal spreading through the entire banking system as it would weed out
risky counter parties.
The funds argue that private clients do not want to be identified. For
example, hedge funds are formed specifically for that purpose and
institutions would not want to bare their positions to the market.
They also say that London could lose its position as a leading
financial centre if draconian regulations are imposed on London-based
fund managers.
The issue of toxic portfolios has attracted the attention of
regulators in the United States, with Representative Edward Markey
saying he will reintroduce a bill to extend Securities and Exchange
Commission oversight over unregulated derivatives dealers affiliated
with securities and insurance companies.
''It is difficult to assess and quantify risk if you do not know who
the principals are,'' the London-based senior banker said. Reuter.

NORTH Sea oil production increased again in November to its highest
level since January 1987 and revenues were magnified by firmer
international prices and a stronger dollar.
The Royal Bank of Scotland Oil and Gas Index, released today, shows
average daily oil output rose by just under 2% to 2.66 million barrels
per day (bpd) from 2.62 million in October.
The total is the highest monthly figure since almost eight years ago
when virtually the same amount was recorded. A more extended snapshot
tells a similar story. In the three months to end-November, average oil
production was 20% up on the same 1993 period.
Oil revenue, measured in sterling terms, reached a four-year peak with
a 7% rise over the previous month to an average #28.7m per day. It was
#23.6m in November 1993.
''North Sea production shows a continuing trend of strong underlying
growth, and gas output would have been even higher but for the mild
weather which restricted demand for heating fuel,'' Mark Shea, the
Royal's energy economist, said.
Ten new fields came on stream last year and most have been working to
capacity.
More affected by seasonal factors, gas production rose for the fourth
successive month -- by 9% -- to 7201 million cu ft per day as winter
approached, albeit hesitantly.
However, the mild autumn weather is more accurately reflected in the
19% fall in gas production for the month when compared to November 1993.
This was also shown in the 2% decrease in the Royal's seasonally
adjusted gas index.
Gas revenue is increasingly important and when it is combined with
oil, total energy returns reached a daily average of #41.8m in November,
an 8% monthly rise and a more modest 4.7% increase over a year
previously. The discrepancy is largely because of the far higher gas
demand in late 1993.
The boost to overall energy revenue -- to the highest monthly level of
last year -- stemmed not only from the continued strong oil output but
also from higher dollar prices and a fall in the average dollar-pound
exchange rate.
In purely oil production terms, there were few major fluctuations and
a 62,000 bpd rise from Shell's Tern field accounted for much of the
monthly gain. Elf Enterprise's Claymore and Scapa, and Shell's Fulmar
showed declines of between 18% and 31%.
British Gas's Morecambe field reported the biggest gas increase -- 39%
-- with BP's Bruce showing the most significant fall, an 80% drop.
The mild weather proved a boon to tanker uplift figures which usually
start to fall by November. In fact, they showed a 7% increase.
Energy specialists say the generally healthy production figures owe
much to recent technological advances, which have enabled the oil giants
to maintain output profit margins despite the relatively low crude price
in historic terms.
Contracting out many of the operations, and efficiencies from the
latest sub-sea developments are behind some of the production increase.
In a separate announcement taking in all the European sectors of the
North Sea, analysts Wood Mackenzie said oil and natural gas output rose
by 49,000 bpd in November to 5.6 million bpd.

ALL barriers put in the way of the over-50s to discourage them from
staying at work should be removed to ease the problem of an increasing
number of pensioners, it was suggested yesterday.
If active, healthy and independent over-50s kept working, they would
slow the growth in those relying on pensions and would continue to
contribute to the financing of pensioners, it was suggested.
The recommendation came from The Carnegie Third Age Programme that
grew out of the three-year Carnegie Inquiry into the Third Age, which
reported in 1993 on the rapidly growing number of older people.
''The biggest single contribution employers and the Government can
make to reducing the pressures on those in work to pay the pensions of
increasing numbers of retired people is to encourage and enable the
over-50s to work,'' it said.
The advice has been submitted to the Retired Income Inquiry, under the
chairmanship of Sir John Anson and sponsored by the National Association
of Pension Funds The inquiry is examining the problem of a rapidly
ageing population caused by a lower birth rate and people living longer.
Through age discrimination in recruitment, training, and selection for
redundancy, millions of people in their third age were being actively
excluded from working, said the Carnegie programme.
''Losing their skill and experience, in many cases for ever, and
putting the responsibility for supporting the retired population on the
shoulders of a reducing number of younger people is crazy,'' said
director Richard Worsley.
''On compelling economic grounds, as well as on grounds of equity, we
need a major shift in attitude and policy by employers, a strong policy
lead by the Government and, if the voluntary approach does not succeed
within a given period, legislation to combat age discrimination.''

GUINNESS can no longer mark its bottles ''By Appointment to Her
Majesty the Queen'' as Britain's Royal Family has lost its taste for the
creamy Irish stout.
''We are sad to have lost the warrant. Drinking trends in the Royal
Family may change and bring back the demand,'' Guinness spokesman Bill
Spears said yesterday.
The warrant signifies that the Royal Family receives regular supplies
of a product.
''The demand for Guinness is buoyant all over the world. We are sold
in 140 countries and we expect to sell 1.8 billion pints this year,'' Mr
Spears said.
But the brewing giant is still sending supplies to the royal household
of four brands of whiskey and two of gin.

US consortium HNVA Acquisition effectively completed its takeover of
troubled property group Heron International yesterday when its offer for
Heron shares and bonds was declared unconditional.
Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), which acted on behalf of HNVA, said in a
statement the share and bond offers had been made unconditional and
settlement would take place on January 26.
''The company will still operate as Heron International but HNVA is
now the majority shareholder,'' a Heron spokesman said.
''This puts the company (Heron) on a firm footing for the future,''
the Heron spokesman said.
He added that Heron chief executive Gerald Ronson would remain at the
helm of the company, which made spectacular losses in property in the
early 1990s.
HNVA, a US consortium of investors headed by Steven Green, whose
company owns the Samsonite luggage maker, offered 45p in the pound for
senior debt and 6p in the pound for junior debt as part of its #142m bid
for Heron made in September last year. It offered #7.50 cash or five
HNVA Ordinary shares for every 1000 Common shares in Heron.
Heron's problems first began to surface in 1991 and it subsequently
admitted heavy losses in the US property market. Last year, having run
up heavy debts, it defaulted on debts to bondholders and restructuring
plans collapsed.
The Heron spokesman said the private company may eventually be floated
on the stock exchanges following the acquisition.
''A flotation will be considered in time,'' he said.
SBC said that under the Commmon share offer, acceptances had been
received in respect of 69.4 million shares, representing 95.4% of the
Common shares in issue.
The period for lodging acceptances under the common share offer was
extended to Friday, January 20.
The HNVA consortium includes press tycoon Rupert Murdoch and family
trusts of the junk bond specialist Michael Milken.

THIS morning Dundee-born actor Brian Cox returns to his home city to
launch a year-long campaign to promote books and reading throughout
Scotland. From the deck of Discovery, Captain Scott's Antarctic ship,
the campaign will be declared under way. Throughout the day a gala of
book events for families takes place at Discovery Point Visitor Centre.
Authors including Colin Hawkins, Margaret Ryan, and Scoular Anderson
will be reading yarns about pirates and adventurers, storyteller David
Campbell will be weaving tales, Julie Lacome leads two workshops
creating jungle friezes, and young children are invited to join the
Animals of Farthing Wood for a tea party. Brian Cox himself will be
reading a personal selection from books at lunchtime.
The name of the campaign is Readiscovery, and its ambitious aim is to
place a book in the hand of every Scot -- man, woman, and child.
On first reaction you might wonder whether Scotland needs such a
campaign -- after all, are not the Scots the champion readers of the UK?
Our library borrowings are the second only to the Finns in Europe -- 10
books borrowed per capita every year. Statistics show that reading is
the most common and frequent activity of all participation in the arts
in Scotland.
Closer examination, however, allows little room for complacency. A
recently commissioned Scottish Arts Council survey indicates that the
reading habit is on the wane -- in just three years, reading books has
dropped by 13% to 67%. Small wonder that reading is under threat,
particularly among young people, in an age which has seen the number of
leisure activities double in the past decade -- reading is just one of
4000 different pursuits vying for our free time.
The campaign was initiated by the Scottish Arts Council following its
Readership Report of 1989. Through its Literature Department, the
council had long supported the writer and the publisher -- it now turned
its attention to the reader. Nineteen ninety-five was designated as a
year to raise the profile of reading. A committee was formed with Dr
Janet Morgan invited to take the chair, a company established and a
sliver of office space created at the Scottish Book Centre. Three
members of staff were appointed -- myself plus touring officer and an
administrator.
At this stage the campaign seemed lumbered with its working title of
Book 95 -- serviceable but unimaginative. Great minds focused their
attention on a suitable name, considering then dropping countless
alternatives. We nearly went with The Great Escape but rejected it for
emphasising the escapism of reading rather than its relevance to life.
It seemed we would never agree -- but then my mother came up with
Readiscovery -- and at last we had a name.
How to go about achieving our aims? In July we held a consultative day
to which we invited authors, publishers, librarians, booksellers,
education advisers. Despite the short notice and the timing, 140 people
came and debated the best way forward. Author Anne Fine (celebrated
author of Madame Doubtfire) gave an inspirational address about the
importance of reading in this television age. More than 100 ideas were
put forward on the day, and in the weeks that followed. A few were
fabulous, many impractical, others plain wacky, and some brilliant in
their simplicity. A plan was formulated to fit in with the limitations
of budget: Readiscovery will act as an umbrella for the many book
activities already happening in Scotland, and also organise a few key
projects of its own.
Central to the campaign is the Book Bus, a specially built vehicle
which will tour to remote primary schools throughout 1995, designed to
stimulate interest in reading among children who live far from the
nearest bookshop or library. On board will be a wide selection of new
titles: books on tape and multi-media titles (expanding the idea of ''a
book''), and travelling with the bus will be authors who will give
talks, readings and workshops.
The Bank of Scotland were the first to sponsor the project with
#25,000 towards the construction of the Book Bus. Since then a further
#56,000 has been raised separately. The Book Bus starts its journey in
the Lothians on Monday, reaching the Highlands and Islands in the summer
term, and finishing the year in Strathclyde. Already the bus has been
fully booked: more than 17,000 schoolchildren will come on board, and
over 100 writers will be involved.
Another of Readiscovery's projects is to keep literature in the public
eye, particularly in unexpected places. Inspired by the Poems on the
Underground, the campaign will be covering Scotland with posters, one
for every month, each with an arresting extract from a book. Look out
for the first, a passage taken from Liz Lochhead, at airports and on
ferries, posted up in swimming pools, leisure centres, around
universities, in hospitals and prisons, and British Gas showrooms.
Stagecoach are displaying a poem each month in all their Scottish buses;
the January poster, appropriately, is part of Tam O'Shanter.
The flagship of the campaign will be National Book Day, to be held on
Saturday, August 12. This will be a national celebration of books, and a
day on which Scots will be encouraged to give or send books.The date has
been chosen as the first day of the Edinburgh Book Festival. Bookshops
and libraries throughout the country will be welcoming customers with
coffee and wine, and hosting author events. Every baby born on Book Day
will be presented with books and a Born to Read badge.

<HEADLINE>Strang calls for end to veal calf exports</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>980500644</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LIVE farm exports should be replaced by the export of carcases, Dr
Gavin Strang, Labour's Shadow Agriculture Minister, has told farmers in
Anglesey.
Speaking at a National Farmers' Union meeting, he said that the
welfare of farm animals was not an issue to be fought out between
demonstrators and the police.
Dr Strang said that Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave should not
simply accept the fact that European agriculture ministers had failed to
agree on legislation to protect farm animals in transit.
''The export of veal calves is unacceptable,'' he said. ''The UK has
banned the crate system because we regard it as cruel. We should not
allow calves to be exported to be subjected to that cruelty in other
European countries. Animals should be leaving this island on the hook,
rather than on the hoof.''
Dr Strang accepted that stricter legislation on animal transport could
have a short-term adverse affect on farm incomes and jobs. At the same
time, the conversion of the live sheep trade into sheep meat exports
could provide additional jobs in this country for abattoirs and cutting
and packaging plants.
He advocated the introduction of a licensing system for animal haulage
companies, setting high welfare standards for animals which continued to
be transported live.
Meanwhile, the National Farmers' Union is seeking an urgent meeting
with the Minister of Agriculture over the disruption being experienced
in the export of live animals.
Sir David Naish, union president, strongly condemned the violent
protests this week at Shoreham, Sussex, against the lawful trade in the
export of live animals.
''We are well aware of the concerns expressed by people about the
whole question of live exports. But it is appalling that a violent
minority have shown that they neither care for those protesting
peacefully, nor for the animals being properly cared for,'' said Sir
David.
The NFU had worked closely with the Government to introduce much
tougher rules to crackdown on those hauliers who had been flouting
transport and welfare rules in Continental Europe, and to ensure that
the highest standards of animal welfare are applied.
Britain is to introduce these new national measures later this month.
They will include a new criminal offence for breaching journey plans
that must accompany animals on journeys longer than 15 hours, and other
measures that will be enforceable in British courts.
''This is a lawful trade which must be allowed to continue as part of
the EU's Single Market for those who wish to meet their customers'
requirements, but it must be carried out under the strictest possible
welfare rules,'' added Sir David.

*THE Government must give British Coal's agricultural tenants a firm
assurance now about the future of their holdings in the wake of
privatisation, Sir David said yesterday. He has written to Energy
Minister Tim Eggar seeking a meeting -- and an urgent clarification of
earlier pledges stating that the Government ''did not intend to treat
farm tenancies unreasonably.''
Sir David said: ''Most of British Coal's agricultural tenants and
licensees are long established, often with lifetimes' investment in
their businesses and homes. Although many will have certain contractual
securities, there is widespread concern and uncertainty as to what the
future may bring.
''These tenants must have the necessary safeguards to ensure that the
land which is central to their farming businesses remains secure under
their new landlords.''
In particular, the NFU is calling for the Coal Board's existing
agricultural tenants to have the opportunity to buy land surplus to the
requirements of any successor to British Coal.
Sir David added: ''Should British Coal decide to sell off all its land
in one contract, that could not only have an adverse effect on the land
market, but also place many businesses in jeopardy.''

* THE SPANISH peseta continued to slump in the currency markets,
providing even better value to UK holidaymakers enjoying winter
sunshine. The peseta sank to a new low against the German currency amid
rumours of Bank of Spain intervention.
The recent rise in Spanish interest rates appears to have had little
effect in the face of continuing domestic political problems. The latest
political scandal centres on allegations of high-level government
involvement in anti-ETA death squads in the 1980s.
Elsewhere, the pound traded in a narrow range with dealers attention
focused on the peseta and the Bundesbank council meeting. German
interest rates were not changed.
Sterling's trade weighted index dipped by 0.1 to 79.9. Against the
dollar, the pound was almost one-third of a cent better at $1.5640 but
it was down more than a pfennig against the German mark at DM2.4258. The
dollar had a mixed tone.

David Belcher meets the tycoon of tune behind Dorado and examines
D*Note's appeal to a new breed of jazzuals
FOUR floors above the sleazy peepshows and teeming stews of
early-evening Soho, record-business executive Ollie Buckwell is
labouring manually and minutely at his desk, seeking to craft a
badly-broken cigarette into a fully-functioning spliff. The youthful
Ollie is a genuine tycoon of tune, and I am in the offices of his label,
Dorado, although to judge by the room's jumbled appearance, with
skateboards and piles of beer bottles and 12in singles pressed into
service as furniture, I could just as easily be in a student bedsit.
I am here because I wish to grill Matt Wienevksi, of D*Note, about his
wondrous forthcoming album for Dorado. Why Matt and I are both here, and
why Dorado exists, is because Ollie is presently the closest thing
Britain has, in a creative recordbiz sense, to Berry Gordy at his Motown
peak.
Under Ollie Buckwell, the Dorado ethos has come to mean strange
musical fruit from stranger liaisons; John Coltrane and Henry Mancini;
Duke Ellington and Maceo Parker; fabulous hybrid discs with unlikely
antecedents; loads of enthusiastic and gifted folk doing tons of hard
work on each other's music in Dorado's two tiny demo studios, installed
in what were once cupboards.
Matt and I idly watch Ollie's busy fingers as he rearranges the spilt
tobacco, sprinkling herbal ooffle-dust into it. ''Dorado reflects
Ollie's interests and personality,'' Matt is saying. ''He has an open
attitude and won't impose a style. He doesn't interfere. He lets
musicians make music and then lets them decide how it'll look on the
cover of their records.
''It's a really noisy building he's got here as well. I don't know why
Ollie puts up with it day-to-day. The Dorado musical end-product is
organic, I suppose, with lots of left-field links. Dorado is certainly
not commercial, run-of-the-mill schlock. It's not the way I'd run a
label, but it gets good results.''
Perhaps one day, I muse, all record companies will operate in such a
free and easy fashion, and music will be all the better for it. Wreathed
at last in pungent smoke, Ollie sits back and points to the one gold
record adorning Dorado's walls. ''Matt got that,'' he says with
mischievous gravity. ''For a single he did in 1992, Circle In The Round.
''Yep, we award a special Dorado gold disc every time one of our
artists manages to create a record that sells less than 2000 copies.''
Ollie chortles; Matt beams.
There will be greater good humour when D*Note's new LP, Criminal
Justice, emerges at the end of this month, for it is sure to sell in
considerably greater numbers. Not that anyone at Dorado is deceiving
themselves about the label's status: hip, but lacking the muscle to
market its wares effectively.
''We've come a long way in two-and-a-half years,'' says Ollie
realistically. ''We've established a brand name, but wider audiences
don't identify with labels, they identify with artists.'' Jhelisa
Anderson might have been the first Dorado artist to make the
breakthrough last year with her Galactica Rush album, but Dorado's
slender financial resources couldn't extend to supporting her
eight-piece band on a UK tour.
A similar fate befell Brooklyn Funk Essentials, whose album I wrote
about endlessly last year. I hope by now that you'll all have bought
your copies of Cool and Steady and Easy, but I know from your anguished
phone calls that not every record shop has been well supplied with the
disc. If you haven't got it yet, order it: you will not be disappointed.
''I know that all sorts of people like D*Note's music when they
actually hear it, but there's been a problem getting it heard,'' Matt
Wienevski says, lamenting the policies which presently prevail in
British music-radio. Matt is thus able to identify the bulk of his
current audience as jazzuals. Jazzuals? Yes: singular folk who, similar
to that vanished youth-tribe known as casuals but entirely unlike most
record-buyers, are forever seeking out the stylish, the new, and the
different.
But is there anything about Criminal Justice which might frighten the
casual pop-picker? Ostensibly, no. D*Note deal in timeless musical
staples: haunting tunes, emotive melodies, songs with words that tell
stories and articulate points of view, from the personal to the
political. D*Note's songs make statements about romantic relationships
which must be severed, as well as about governmental policies, like the
Criminal Justice Act, which are overly severe.
D*Note's music is forged from disparate components, however, emerging
from Matt's knowledge of Steve Reich, bhangra, and trance-house; tape
loops and the new ragga hardcore of the jungle DJs; the cerebral and the
floorshaking; seventeenth-century baroque harpsichords and modern pirate
radio; Debussy and Miles Davis; Ravel, Bartok and the Brecker Brothers;
Charlie Parker and Varese.
''Our first LP was a mistake, a failed attempt to write commercial
tunes; a nod to mainstream taste that wasn't mainstream. For this LP
we've stuck to our guns. It's always easy to stick different things
together -- but who would want to eat a fettucine marmalade sandwich? I
know that we've stuck different things together because they sound good
and they work.''
Sitting beneath a red wall-mounted African-mask lantern with an
incongruous Dorado ski hat perched on its summit, Ollie chuckles again.
There's no reason why Dorado's open-minded music shouldn't move the
masses, but it is assuredly not for dopes.
DON'T MISS THE BUS BRATS
THOUSANDS of you knew that Ian Dury was first to hymn sex and drugs
and rock 'n' roll, but only three of you could win a set of 10 rock
tomes from publishers Omnibus Press. The winning trio were Julie Gunn, Y
Shah, and Louise Snee. This week's competition promises two fortuitous
boss groovers a crate of Carlsberg and a pair of tickets to the Glasgow
leg of the New Musical Express/Carlsberg Brat Bus Tour when it visits
the Garage a week on Monday.
But what, you might be asking yourself, is a Brat bus tour? And what
is Brat?
The Brat Awards, scheduled to take place in London on January 21 and
22, are the NME's riposte to the record industry's self-congratulatory
Brits Awards. The Brat Awards, chosen by NME scribes and a poll of NME
readers, aim to highlight happening new stuff, rather than handing out
grandfather clocks for lifetime achievement to tired old jossers like
Phil Collins.
Thus the four bands who will spill from their UK tour bus into the
Garage are Veruca Salt, Marion, Skunk Anansie, and 60 Foot Dolls, Brat
nominees all. So how do you stand a chance of securing your tickets and
beer, or a Carlsberg T-shirt if you're among 10 runners-up?
Simply mail a postcard to David Belcher is Probably the Brattiest
Groover, The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow, G1 1QP. It must arrive
by next Wednesday, January 11. It must tell me your address and daytime
phone number. With luck, it'll be drawn from my Kangol cap.

COMMERCIAL Union is the latest insurance group to announce a cut in
with-profits endowment payouts, though on a modest scale, writes
CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
A typical #30 per month 25-year policy taken out by a 30-year-old man
maturing on January 1 would yield #64,798, down from #65,599 a year ago.
For a similar 10-year policy the reduction is from #6807 to #6419.
Commercial Union yesterday said the decline reflects the continuing
lower rate of inflation and investment returns. Unlike some companies,
the group remains committed to the with-profits endowment.
General manager, life, Ian Reynolds, commented: ''With-profits
policies have historically provided excellent real returns over and
above inflation even when, as in 1994, the value of shares and fixed
interest securities has fallen.''
The lower payouts have trimmed nominal investment returns from 12.5%
to 11.4% for 10-year policies and from 13.6% to 13.5% over 25 years.
Allowing for inflation, real rates of return of 6.6% and 4.7%
respectively have been achieved.
CU's maturity values are relatively less dependent on the terminal
bonus than the average. The terminal bonus, which is influenced more by
investment conditions in the final year of the policy than the
reversionary bonus, represents 14.9% of the payout over 10 years and
28.6% over 25 years.

Rob Adams meets Alan Stivell who brings his Celtic message to Glasgow
tonight
THESE days nobody would bat an eyelid but in the mid-1970s the sight
and sound of someone playing the bagpipes surrounded by a rock band on
BBC2's Old Grey Whistle Test was something of a novelty. The fact that
the piper and his band were French only added to the brouhaha, and sales
of the Chemins de Terre album by Alan Stivell (for it was he) picked up
very nicely indeed.
Who was this guy, people asked, and where did he come from? Answering
''France'' was neither quite enough nor strictly true. Stivell was --
and is -- passionately Breton (he advocates self-government for all the
Celtic nations, including the Duchy of Cornwall) and the news that he
had taken Paris by storm -- in the musical sense, on the live album
issued prior to Chemins de Terre -- had gone down particularly well
among his fellow Bretons, who had perceived this as a significant
retaliatory kick against Parisian imperialism.
Stivell's impact on these shores remained more musical than political,
although he did play an important role in reminding us that Celts were
farther-flung than our own islands. Indeed, it might be argued that if
anyone has earned the right to launch a series of concerts under the
Celtic Connections banner, as he does tonight, it is Stivell.
From the start his music was, he insisted, Pan-Celtic, embracing tunes
and songs from the Isle of Man, Cornwall, Galicia, and Brittany of
course, as well as Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. And although his
embracing of the Scottish bagpipes has always come across as a triumph
of enthusiasm over technical command, his convincing championing of the
Celtic harp has helped to take that instrument to a world-wide audience.
In America, for example, the Celtic harp's following constitutes a
veritable industry of makers, teachers, and players, and the Japanese
are catching up fast.
It was with his Renaissance of the Celtic Harp album in 1972 that
Stivell had first gained serious attention outside France. A
misunderstood title (the instrument was still alive and well, thank you
very much, in Ireland and Scotland), it drew on his own local experience
rather than the international one. The instrument had disappeared from
the Breton tradition in the Middle Ages and it was Stivell's father who
actually began its process of rebirth.
A musical-instrument maker to trade, Jord Cochevelou (Alan adopted his
Stivell surname, meaning spring, later) dreamed for years of making the
instrument as he'd imagined it from ancient tales, so much so that it
became virtually his life's work. It had to be perfect and when he
eventually completed his prototype the sound it made captivated his
young son. Piano lessons were ditched as Alan became hooked on the harp,
making his first public performance, aged nine, at the Maison de
Bretagne in Paris in 1953.
His father's painstaking research had resulted in Alan being soaked in
the Pan-Celticism that he would go on to preach, and when other music
such as the Beatles' and Bob Dylan's reached his ears he worked on ways
to incorporate these, too. This eclecticism is still his modus operandi.
At the Festou Noz (the Breton equivalent of our ceilidhs which have
enjoyed coincidentally a tremendous upswing in popularity) he advocates
that rock, rap, and house music be played alongside traditional Breton
gavottes.
Music, he argues, is a living force, and while young Bretons -- and
indeed Celts of whatever derivation -- should be proud of their culture,
they should also want to be part of the outside world. That is the
philosophy he brings to Glasgow Royal Concert Hall tonight, so whatever
he and his band play it seems safe to predict that it won't belong in a
museum.

FRANCE plans to sell the state tobacco monopoly Seita in the next few
weeks, a government source said yesterday after a decree was issued
setting the privatisation in motion.
The company is best known for the pungent Gauloises and Gitanes
cigarettes that have become icons of the Gallic look, as filterless
props to a host of emblematic figures from singer Edith Piaf to
philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.
The decree in yesterday's Official Journal, signed by Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur, read simply: ''It is decided to proceed with the
transfer from the public sector to the private sector of the majority
stake held by the state in the Societe Nationale d'Exploitation
Industrielle des Tabacs et Allumettes.''
Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery will formally ask the Privatisation
Commission to value the firm, a process that should take about a
fortnight.
The intention is to privatise it before the presidential election
begins on April 23. Analysts have valued Seita at Fr5000m to Fr6000m,
but the government source said it was probably worth more.
The government is pitching the attractions of Seita's network of
37,500 licensed tobacconist outlets for a whole range of private service
firms.
Seita expects a 14% rise in net income for 1994 on sales of Fr15.7bn.
Industry sources have said the government will keep about 10% of the
firm, selling 47.5% to the public, 35% to a hard core of loyal
shareholders, 5% to company employees and 2.5% to licensed tobacconists.

Mid-Life Confidential, edited by Dave Marsh (Hodder and Stoughton,
#15.99)
* HOOTS, what weird times we had out on the rock'n'roll highway that
never ends! There was me, Irvine Welsh, Cliff Hanley, Jimmie Macgregor,
Grant Morrison, A.L. Kennedy, and Kirsty Wark. Together we were the
Tartan Write Stuff, a band of two-chord wonders determined to rock it
like we'd only ever talked it. Such gigs! Hot nights rockin' da house in
Arbroath and Kilwinning. Such songs! Louie Louie, Leader of the Pack,
Nadine. Hell, we should get the whole thing down in a book . . . and if
ever we do, it won't be anywhere near as self-indulgent and consciously
in-jokey as this effort, detailing the exploits of a bunch of
hitherto-esteemed critics (Greil Marcus and Marsh) and writers (Stephen
King, Matt Groening and Dave Barry). They strapped on axes; called
themselves the Rock Bottom Remainders; sought to stave off middle-age;
pretended to be an ironic rock band -- and actually toured the States.
This sorry book tells the sorry tale. Thank God there's no accompanying
CD.
Blackanized 360[0], Music For Your Mind (Natural Response)
* JINGS, I don't think I've got a ready label for the wondrous grist
to be found on this most pleasing EP. Is it a further example of the
trip-hop mode? Or is it rare-rap-jazz-groove? Perambulent lope-loop?
Stoner-jive-hip-bop? Dunno. Best simply to say that you should have
bought it by now, and it's Scottish -- from some Edinburgh netherland,
evidently -- and I can't wait to hear the album because this is really
rather cool.
MC Solaar, Prose Combat (Talkin' Loud)
* SHAME FACED, I must confess to having hitherto been left unmoved by
MC Solaar. Rap en Francais? Mais non! Je ne comprends pas! But then I
decided to hear instead of listen, and I stopped worrying about what the
words meant, and the jazzy-funky-hippy-hoppiness washed over me and I
was made whole. So while this album is loosely about Alain Prost, Paris,
Nina Ricci, Marcel Duchamps, Rousseau and Fanny Ardant, it's mostly
about dancing one's trousers off. This is good news in any language.
DAVID BELCHER
Second Story, Open House (Green Linnet)
* TRACK three, the decidedly Balkan Merengue, gives it away. The
fiddler, impressive on tracks one and two, must have played with Andy
Irvine. He has, for he is Kevin Burke, of Patrick Street. With his three
Open House colleagues, he presents a similar formula: tightly-arranged,
crisply-played tunes and songs of a twinkle-in-the-eye persuasion
featuring appearances by Chaucer and Pythagoras as well as King Kong.
Old Irish/Eastern European medicine in an attractive new bottle.
Leading Off, Chris Thile (Sugar Hill)
* Like many 13-year-old Americans, Chris Thile plays baseball. He also
plays mandolin, guitar and fiddle. Plays each of them like a veteran, in
fact, so much so that alongside such bluegrass greats as fiddler Byron
Berline, Chris sounds like one of the gang. And most of these
cleverly-realised musical intricacies are of his own composing (the
fret-tickling Shipwrecked he wrote aged eight). One little guy, all this
talent. It's not fair.
The Place to Be, Benny Green (Blue Note)
* PIANIST Benny Green first wowed Scottish audiences with Art Blakey's
mid-1980s Jazz Messengers when barely out of his teens. It's high time
he paid us another visit. The guy has everything: great touch,
sensitivity, a gorgeous turn of phrase, and an obvious awareness of the
music's history. The opening Nice Pants hymns fellow ex-Messenger Bobby
Timmons and is one of three tracks given a sumptuous horn arrangement.
The others are solo, duos or trios with fabulous bassist Christian
McBride and the cracking Kenny Washington on drums. Wonderful stuff.
County Fair 2000, Phil Alvin (Hightone)
* THE Blasters' singer-guitarist has enlisted a cast of dozens for
this musical odyssey through America's southern states. There's
typically gritty roadhouse r&amp;b from the Blasters themselves; raggedly
eloquent blues from Billy Boy Arnold, Top Jimmy and Mary Franklin;
flamboyant New Orleans jazz from the Dirty Dozen Brass Band; tap dancing
from Fayard Nicholas . . . even the unpromisingly titled Danny Boy's
Mourning Sunset turns out to be proof of Spike Jones's little-known
Crescent City connections. Suffering and heartache have seldom been such
fun.
ROB ADAMS
Funky Gene's, Gene Harris (Concord)
* FUNKY indeed. Bluesy, too, is most of this nine-track finger-workout
from Harris. His style consists of many rather flamboyant and marathon
trills, which -- used too often -- tend to lose their effect. This is
true of the opener -- the big, brash Harris-penned Blues for Basie --
and the closing piece, Basie's Blues in Hoss' Flat. The less flashy
numbers are more appealing: the darkly-evocative Children of Sanchez and
the moody, melancholy Everything Happens To Me. But the one you won't
stop humming is the groovy Bye Bye Blues.
Organic Duke, Scott Hamilton (Concord)
* FIRST impression of this mainly Ellington CD was ''Nice sax, shame
about the organ''. Hamilton's tenor is the main attraction -- as
swinging and joyful as ever, especially on the funky Jump For Joy. But
after a few listens, Mike LeDonne's organ grows on you. It sounds a
little sparse on up-tempo numbers, but on slower tunes like Moon Mist or
Isfahan, it has an ethereal quality, providing an atmospheric backdrop
to Hamilton's wispily mellow tone. Personally, though, I'd save my money
for Hamilton's next recording.
Dream a Little Dream, Gerry Mulligan Quartet (Telarc Jazz)
* HIP HIP . . . A new CD from legendary baritone sax player Mulligan,
whose instantly recognisable, unrivalled mahogany sound is featured on
14 sparkling tunes. Every one of them is superb, but especially
appealing are two old, rarely-heard chestnuts -- the lilting title track
and the beautiful, nostalgic Home. I'll Be Around is exquisite -- heart
wrenching, with just the barest tinge of optimism -- and is also the
best example of the leader's rapport with his pianist, Ted Rosenthal. Of
the four previously-recorded Mulligan originals, The Real Thing -- a
sultry, bewitching ballad -- is perhaps the finest . . . hooray.

<HEADLINE>Gatt agreement will work to advantage of farmers</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>

FARMERS should approach the future with confidence that the most
recent Gatt agreements would work to their advantage, Mr Peter
Sutherland, first director-general of the World Trade Organisation, said
yesterday.
Speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference, he told delegates: ''I
believe the agreement will be to your advantage, rather than your
disadvantage, over time.''
He aid it was important to understand that the Uruguay Round of
negotiations had not been about a free market system, although it was
often presented as such. ''What we are talking about is a gradual
liberalisation. The agreement which has been reached is a balance of
interests. In essence, this means that trade in agriculture has at last
been integrated into the mainstream of the multilateral trading
system.''
With the adoption of a rule-based approach, designed to establish a
stable and predictable framework for international competition in all
agricultural products, there was an attempt to introduce predictability
to an industry which had never known it before.
''It means the rules of the game will be applied across the board,''
he said. ''That, ultimately, is the promise held out by the successful
conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Order is as much required in
agriculture as in any other sector.''
Mr Sutherland reckoned that the main accomplishments of the
agricultural negotiaions had been to subject all measures affecting
trade in agriculture to enforceable multilateral rules.
At the core of the agreement was a new system for the settlement of
disputes. Under the World Trade Organisation -- successor to Gatt -- the
adoption of a dispute panel's report would no longer require the
agreement of the losing country. An appeal system had been introduced,
offering an independent review before a panel's recommendations became
legally binding. This would lead to greater confidence in the results of
the dispute settlement system.
In market access, said Mr Sutherland, the major accomplishment was the
introduction of tariffs -- or ''ordinary customs duties'' -- as the sole
permissible form of Border protection.
It seemed inevitable that there would be further reform of
agricultural policies throughout the world. These reforms were likely to
be driven first and foremost by secular or technological development, as
well as by budgetary constraints, and broader macro-economic
considerations.
The new framework of rules and commitments would also play a
significant role in channelling those reforms in a direction which was
compatible with the more open trading arrangements enshrined in the
agreement on agriculture.
Mr Graham Robertson, national president of Federated Farmers of New
Zealand, said that farmers all round the world were trying to figure out
the possible effects of the recent Gatt settlement on their businesses
-- whether they farmed in countries with a high measure of support for
agriculture, or in countries such as New Zealand, where there was no
such support.
Prior to the 1970s, New Zealand farming had little support, but in the
wake of the oil crisis, and Britain's entry into the EU, the New Zealand
economy became a 'basket case.'
''By 1984, we were the recipients of a range of subsidies that, in
less than 20 years, moved us from a low level of support, to becoming an
industry that was 35% supported by the Government, and ultimately
taxpayers,'' he said.
A Labour government undertook the task of economic reform, which
included the removal of agricultural support. ''This was welcomed by New
Zealand farmers, and my organisation was to the forefront in lobbying
for the change. We saw that the subsidies we were receiving ended up in
the pockets of other sectors.
''As long as our industry was provided with an adequate income by
virtue of Government assistance, it provided the opportunity for those
sectors servicing agriculture to help themselves to their share of the
booty. Farmers found themselves replacing equipment largely for tax
reasons.'' His current combine was 13 years old and, he hoped, would see
out his days in farming.
Mr Robertson added: ''We found expensive ways to run our farms, where
once we did it more cheaply. One of the fundamental laws of agriculture
is that, giving farmers a high price for their product, will ensure that
they find an expensive way of producing it. New Zealand farmers saw the
need to wind back the subsidies, because they saw the distortions they
were causing.''
While farm families went through difficult times, sheer tenacity kept
the number of departures from the industry to a minimum. Now, he said,
New Zealand farmers were driven by the market, and they were no longer
''farming the subsidies.''
Sheep numbers were declining, as land was switched to more profitable
enterprises such as forestry, deer, dairying, or beef.
Government support measures had been largely blind to the matter of
quality, but now quality had become more important than quantity. ''Meat
companies have recognised that they must maintain prices that are
attractive to producers, and are doing this by focusing on high value
markets. In Europe, lamb is no longer aimed at the Sunday roast for the
British working class family, but is increasingly marketed as a gourmet
product for the Continental hotel and restaurant trade.''
Farmers had been forced to find cheaper production methods, and all
expenditure was scrutinised to ensure it added value to the business.
The same drive for efficiency had been seen in the farm service sector,
and New Zealand meat plants were among the world leaders in standards of
efficiency.
When incomes were underwritten by the Government, farmers had tended
to discount risk, he said. ''Now we know we must manage risk ourselves.
Now we know only the discipline of the market place. Despite the
vagaries of the market, New Zealand farmers feel more secure in meeting
the demands of customers worldwide, than relying on the whims of
politicians. It's hard to stand tall when you have your hand out.''

Ian Bell looks at the myth of the classless society where the middle
ground is home to all -- except, of course, the growing underclass
IKNOW my place. When every polemicist lumbered with negative equity
and school fees is telling you class is dead, and every politician is
tripping over his Oxfords in the stampede to colonise the middle ground,
it's hardly the time to question the great chain of being, is it?
Thought has been refined, here and in America, and old ideas of class
have been defenestrated.
In the US, to judge by the free-associating chatter of Clinton and
Gingrich, the nation is bourgeois from sea to shining sea. Granted,
there may be outposts of swinish affluence to give decent Americans
something to aim for, and pits of destitution to remind them never to
get sick or unemployed, but heartland USA is middle-income, middle-brow,
middle class, and proud of it.
In Britain, if you believe everything you read, the working class has
been abolished, its legacy apportioned among an ''aspirational'' lower
salariat with a grant-maintained conscience and a lumpen ''underclass''
who need not, given their nasty habits, be canvassed. On this, the party
leaders have no quarrel.
Yet it's a question worth asking: if the working class no longer
exists, what is the underclass under, exactly? If antiquated class
politics is no longer relevant, what is the middle class in the middle
of, precisely? To say, as so many do, that we're all middle-class now --
a terrifying thought, when you get down to it -- unless by some fluke we
are filthy rich or dirt poor, sounds like terminological inexactitude
with knobs on.
Nevertheless, Clinton promises tax-breaks for the middle class and
Blair takes the decrepit Labour Party off for a cut and blow dry to make
it presentable on suburban doorsteps, where it will speak its piece and
refrain from uncouth language. Major dreams of tepid beer and
classlessness; Gingrich makes a social contract (nothing down; years to
pay) with middle America. All roads lead to the centre.
WHEN the scores for the 20th century are added up, some prodigy will
explain that all of this has been caused by the fall of Soviet
Communism, meaning that when the advertised alternative to free markets
failed to deliver, sensitive Western socialists were free to quit the
dreary class struggle and join the fun. The fall of the Wall, wise men
will say, brought class divisions tumbling down.
The trouble is it remains a little hard to see how Stalinism's failure
became incontestable proof of capitalism's success. It is harder still
to identify the connection between events in Moscow at any time and
daily life in, say, Musselburgh. While we're at it, we might ask the
people of Chechnya to spot the difference between a totalitarian USSR
and democratic Russia.
No, the triumph of the middle class, if that is what it is, has had
other causes. Increased social mobility is one factor often called in
evidence, the closing of the industrial age another. It is easier for
ordinary folk to improve themselves these days, or so we are told, and
you can't have an industrial proletariat when there's no heavy industry
to prole around in.
As myths go, it is one of the better ones. Yet the chances of becoming
a judge or sitting in Cabinet without having attended one of the better
public schools are not much greater than they ever were. Working people
may be assembling TV sets rather than liners, but who really believes
their relationship with capital has altered significantly?
And if self-improvement is so easy, where did this burgeoning
underclass spring from? In fact, the key element in true social mobility
-- higher education -- is once again the preserve of the traditional
middle, which is to say professional, class. Video machines are easy
enough to come by, and you can call that prosperity if you wish, but a
degree, with all the status and opportunity it confers, is becoming
steadily more expensive to acquire, just as it is in the US. We may all
be middle class, but some are more middle class than others.
EQUALLY, many of those taught to regard themselves as such must be
wondering where the jam has gone. In America, anyone not blessed with
inherited wealth is having to work harder and longer just to maintain
standards of living, far less improve them. Over the past decade,
average real incomes have actually fallen, and the pattern is being
repeated in the UK if the number of hours worked per week is anything to
go by. All those people who no longer count themselves as working class
are having to work hell of a hard to prove it.
Nevertheless, Labour's attempts to make itself acceptable to the
aspirational -- Clause Four, private schools, privatisation and the rest
-- are indicative. If hardworking middle-class people aspire to private
education who, in all fairness, can call them unfair? And if, just as in
the US, they then aspire to private medicine, or private police forces,
or privatised welfare services who, with any logic, can oppose them? Not
Labour.
Gore Vidal once said America had only one political party, a slice of
which leaned slightly to the left, a slice slightly to the right. We can
now say the same. Class has not ceased to exist but politics has become
the preserve of the middling professionals of the middle order, those
whose outlook on life, whether it be schooling or free markets, is
everywhere much the same; those who justify themselves by conscripting
all but the truly rich and the hopelessly poor; those who insist the
emperor's new threads are simply the last word in modernity.
None of which would matter much if the world resembled the myth. But
the working class remains, here as in America, even if, here as there,
it is bereft of political representation. What happens, do you think,
when quite so many people are quite so thoroughly abandoned?

Every inch the nobleman, Lord Charteris has a reputation for springing
shocks such as his latest broadside against the Duchess of York
HE IS, outwardly, everything that an aristocrat who is also a royal
confidant should be. Lord Charteris, 81, former private secretary to the
Queen, exudes a grey, calm, and distinguished aura that makes you
instinctively want to stand up when he enters the room. He wears always
an impeccably correct suit.
He has a soldier's bearing and will occasionally betray the basilisk
stare and drumming fingers of the bored nobleman. But behind all that
regulation formality there lies a man who tends to dissolve into
schoolboy giggles, and who will shock you with remarks which sometimes
appear so incongruous with his regal deportment.
It was typical of him that he should end the Spectator interview -- in
which he was so forthright about members of the royal family -- with the
endearing invitation to his tormentor: ''Now, let's go and get pissed.''
Martin Michael Charles Charteris, who as one-time Keeper of Her
Majesty's Archives probably has more royal secrets in his privy purse
than anybody alive, enjoyed the upbringing that you would expect of a
grandson of the eleventh Earl of Wemyss.
It was Eton and Sandhurst, a commission in the King's Royal Rifle
Corps in 1936, and a distinguished war record. In 1949 he was invited to
join Princess Elizabeth's household. ''Choosing me was an act of pure
nepotism,'' he cheerfully admits.
''I knew Jock Colville, her then secretary, who wanted to return to
the Foreign Office, and my wife was friends with Alan Lascelles, the
King's private secretary. There was no vetting, no security clearance,
no board interviews. Nothing like that.''
He has admitted that he took three weeks before accepting. ''You
should always hesitate, and then say 'yes'. I was familiar with that
kind of life, not on the same scale, of course.
''But the furniture polish smelt the same as it did in the houses
where I was a child.'' Lord Charteris confessed: ''I simply fell in love
with her when I met her. She was so young, beautiful, dutiful, the most
impressive of women.''
He was the man quietly at the Queen's side at all the most important
moments of her life: in Kenya when her father, George VI died, helped
her through the coronation, organised her tours and triumphs, and wrote
the funnier bits in her speeches.
He says that in 1977 ''I sensed it was time to move on. I'd been with
her a long time and I never wanted to read a Cabinet paper again or
organise another African tour''.
Lord Charteris returned to the renowned playing fields to become
provost of Eton where during a sermon in College Chapel he reminded one
and all that the purpose of the school, according to the founder Henry
VI, was to educate a class of people capable of governing the country.
''Henry VIII tried to abolish Eton because it was getting too powerful.
But God immediately took him to his bosom.''
He became chairman of the National Heritage Memorial Trust, where he
gained a reputation as an old soother, magicking money out of thin air.
One friend said: ''He's a great one for taking Ministers by the elbow
and saying: 'I know you'll see us right'. And they do.'' Once, when the
performing arts was crying out in vain for cash, #25m was quietly found
to boost the Heritage Fund. ''From underspend, off the back of a lorry
or whatever,'' Lord Charteris said.
He never tried to be Jack the Lad. Once at a classy dinner, the guests
were asked: ''How many people here have been in a fish and chip shop?''
Everyone -- peers, financiers, professors -- dutifully raised their
hands. Only one hand stayed down. It belonged to Lord Charteris.
He is an aristocrat through and through, as one would expect of a
kinsman of Colonel Francis Charteris, who died in 1732 and was dismissed
from the Army for cheating, thrown out of the Dutch service for theft,
convicted of rape (though pardoned) and enriched by gambling and usury.
His illustrious descendant, obviously, has no such chequered
background.
But he will, from time to time, totally disarm you with an unlordly
comment quite out of keeping, it would seem, from one of his impeccable
pedigree.

COPIES of the RAF calendar (lovely photies of airyplanes, as you would
expect) have been winging their way to grateful recipients. Or are they
grateful recipients? The RAF is not too sure.
Enclosed with the calendar is a questionnaire. Answer yes or no to
these:
* Did you expect to receive this calendar?
* Does the calendar capture the spirit of the RAF?
* Would you like to receive next year's RAF calendar?
* How would you rate the design and layout of the calendar? (On a
scale from very poor to excellent.)
* How would you rate the photographs -- are they appropriate?
And a final question which hints at what the exercise may be all
about: If you had to buy this calendar, would you? If yes, what do you
think would be a fair price? Under #3, #3-#5, over #5.
While we are sorry to see that the Brylcreem boys are so strapped for
cash that they are thinking of flogging calendars, we can only welcome
the RAF's new approach to consumer research.
In any future conflict, we expect to see them going back over the
target to drop leaflets asking such questions as:
* How do you rate the accuracy of our bombing?
* Was the strafing effective?
* Did any parachutists drift off course and land in your garden by
mistake?
* Would you like to purchase the commemorative boxed set of
reconnaissance photographs?
(Enough knocking the brave boys in blue -- Ed.)
On the move
STILL on the subject of calendars. The RNLI snap for January is of a
picturesque bay in Dumfriesshire. Each photie is accompanied by a map of
the British Isles with a red dot indicating the location. The
Dumfriesshire snap has a red dot located in southern Ireland. Don't
launch the lifeboats yet.
Nae luck award
AN 18-year-old girl was driving to her home in Upper Hutt, near
Wellington, New Zealand. She swerved to avoid a hedgehog on the road and
her car overturned. Fortunately another car was not far behind and the
driver was able to come to her assistance. Such a shame that he ran over
the hedgehog as he screeched to a halt.
Burning question
SMALL ad spotted on noticeboard in Tesco's, Uddingston: ''For sale,
fire with hogmanay surround . . .'' Obviously a case of too much New
Year revelry.
Scottish view
MICHAEL Grade, boss of Channel 4, offered one or two of his huge
Havana cigars to the Diary reader who came up with the best reason why
his programmes are more popular in Scotland than anywhere else in
Britain.
Many of you took him literally and wrote about the quality and
individuality of the Channel 4 output and other reasons of a brown-nose
nature. These were immediately discarded.
Winner of the cigars is Graham Whyte of Cumbernauld who writes:
''Scotland has a higher proportion of insomniacs and Channel 4 is
cheaper than buying sleeping pills. Also, the passionate Scotswoman
turns her partner on by letting him watch the mucky films on Channel 4
because she can't afford Chanel No5.''
Chain of command
DEPT of You Can Take the Boys out of Glasgow But: The scene is a
community theatre in Dublin where Jim Kelman's play One, Two, Hey! has
been performed. The play is about a veteran Glasgow blues band and,
indeed, members of the Blues Poets, a veteran Glasgow blues band, are in
the cast.
Two members of the band are in conversation with the Lord Mayor of
Dublin. They ask him about the nice gold chain he is wearing. He tells
them it is very ancient and was, in fact, donated to the city of Dublin
by Prince William of Orange.
The two, being West of Scotland Proddies, are suitably impressed. The
Lord Mayor of Dublin is mildly surprised to find two Scotsmen kneeling
in front of him in veneration of his chain of office.
Audience reaction
A LETTER from Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund managers,
offered an invitation to attend a seminar on venture capital.
It urged clients to ''let us know whether you will, or will not be
able to attend. I do hope it is the latter.'' A case of you'll have had
your venture capital seminar.

THERE is no shadow of a doubt that one of the greatest stimuli for
inflation is any anxiety concerning a country's currency. And not a
sliver of a penumbra that the change to decimalisation back in 1970
caused the onslaught of just that process in the UK when I was earning
19 pounds, 19 shillings, and 11 pence a week. (The top wage for the sort
of idiotic job I did then was 20 quid but I had employers who couldn't
bear the idea of losing a penny.) By 1980 a decent wage was 100 quid.
There was a reason for that and most of it was decimalisation. For
when they changed the currency the shops, manufacturers, thieves, and
capitalists changed the prices. Relying, it turned out justifiably, on
public ignorance and the inability of the aged, infirm, and innumerate,
to understand what was happening the villains made lots of poppy.
They still do when there are monetary changes, for instance in the
Budget. It is amazing how an increase in tax on ciggies, or beer, or
spirits, results in a wee profit for the corner shop, the off-licence,
and the pub. In all the years that I have lived I never saw a decrease
in a price. And the latest dodge is being enjoyed splendidly by the
publicans and brewery chains of our land.
The changeover at New Year from the old spirit measures to new
European-directed ones is the reason why many, indeed most, publicans
are dancing because they are charging the same prices as before and for
smaller measures. Pub-drinkers out there: do not believe the old oil
they are going to give you across a counter about how they have not made
a penny out of this new European instruction.
A brewery owned pub I was in recently was charging exactly the same
for the new measure of 25ml as it was for its old one of a fifth. It is
owned by a company with thousands of outlets. A week will net them
fortunes. Not all pubs are like that.
The public house which lives in The Herald building itself, The Press
Bar, has gone over to 35ml in place of its former fifth (an increase in
volume of 23.24% extra), and has gone up in price from 94p to 106p.
We'll work out the percentage.
Desi McEntee and his boys and girls are losing. Marked contrast to the
pubs which certain breweries own, eh? But I will let my colleagues
elsewhere in the blatt go into the statistics though, as a whisky chap
myself, I know them full well.
What I know nothing about at all is Europe, and why the Scotch whisky
industry did not react to this edict from Strasbourg. I know about my
resentment of the EU itself. When Tory politicians get told off for
being anti-European, or even xenophobic, I find it hard to control
either my mirth or my rage. The most xenophobic, racist, and
chauvinistic country in Europe is France.
Monsieur Chauvin was perfectly entitled to be awffy French and so was
General De Gaulle, but it might just be said that De Gaulle wouldn't
have made much more than an especially pompous and rather ridiculous
set-aside major in the bloody Pay Corps in the last war, a figure of fun
straight out of The Sword of Honour Trilogy, instead of having the
bloody cheek to tell Britain what they could or could not join,
including the Common Market. (Some of you might have forgotten that it
was originally a simple cartel for the European coal and steel
federations and later decided to be a damn-near fraudulent agricultural
mafia.) We finally, and humiliatingly, joined what was then the European
Economic Community, in 1972.
D'you remember the referendum in 1974? We voted to give our
sovereignty away, I remember, the Labour Party being, a touch
half-heartedly, largely against it. It is now the European Union and
they can manage to tell us what measure of a dram we will have.
They do other things as well of course. Despite the fact that all the
other European countries ignore any legislation of which they disapprove
and punitively tax our products as against their own, the supine Brits
give in to every damned measure (sic) these continental chaps and
chapettes can think up.
When that Tory daftie Patrick Nicholls was forced to resign from his
wee Tory grouping for bad-mouthing our European cousins, I found it very
difficult. I am not a Tory, far less a daft one. But what he seemed to
be saying sounded sensible enough to me.
The French did run away in two World Wars and collaborated horribly.
The Italians allowed a fat grotesque of a rodomontade to take them into
a war they had no heart or guts for. The Spanish had a Civil War in the
course of which over a million perished, the . . . let's stop here: I
can just about manage the Dutch. Do not talk to me about German culture.
They would have slaughtered Beethoven, Schiller, Goethe. They would most
certainly have slaughtered me and the bulk of the Celtic nations.
I'd have gone early because I am small, dark, Celtic, part-Jewish, and
a former communist. So would almost every other Scot for the same
reasons (we are, after all the Lost Tribe of Judah).
This is not at all the same thing as saying that lots, and even
perhaps most, of our European neighbours are not absolutely splendid. Or
that we cannot learn much from them. It is to say that this nation --
and I mean the Scottish one at that -- should do what the continentals
do. Keep our own culture. Our dram for a start would do. Oh, aye, and
our currency.

THE ruin staring some Lloyds names in the face in recent years, when
their unlimited personal liability came face to face with a series of
mega-insurance claims, will read like a mere footnote in the history of
financial disasters if some of the gloomier predictions of a global
pensions time-bomb ticking merrily away ever come to pass. Whether we
are dependent solely on state provision, subscribe to company pension
schemes, or make additional personal provision, we all work on the
assumption that our contributions will grow into a healthy nest egg,
there to meet our needs when work is over. But will it?
The world's population is ageing rapidly and living longer. The number
of people over 60, which stood at half a billion in 1990, is forecast
nearly to triple, to 1.4 billion, by 2030. As a World Bank study
published last year showed, that greying of the population will place
ever heavier burdens on public pension provision. In the OECD countries,
pension spending will top 15% of GDP by around 2025. Add in the
escalating health costs associated with an ageing population and the
strains on future public finances look even more serious. Similar
mounting pressures, the study argues, will appear in the former
communist countries, in China and the rest of the Pacific region, in
South America and the Caribbean, in North Africa and the Middle East.
For industrialised economies with a well-developed system of private
company pension provision, there is an additional problem. The search
for competitiveness and efficiency has resulted, in Europe in
particular, in savage pruning of payrolls and the growth of a new
orthodoxy which insists that many previously productive workers are ripe
for retirement when they reach 50. Pension fund surpluses, built up in
headier times, are now being used up to enhance a multitude of early
retirement packages. As a result, the balance between contributors and a
swelling army of younger pensioners is shifting. If that shift goes too
far, the solvency of individual schemes and their ability to fufil
promises of pensions linked to final salary in the longer term will be
jeopardised.
There is another twist to the problem. Pension funds in countries like
Britain are now massive players in bond and equity markets. In 1991, UK
pension fund assets amounted to 73% of national GDP. If the funds
experience greater and greater difficulty meeting their obligations,
they will, in turn, demand better and better returns from the securities
in which they invest. The pressures on individual companies, through the
equity markets and on national governments, through the bond markets,
will intensify. The equity pressures could force managements to
contemplate even more of the cost-cutting medicine which is contributing
to the problem in the first place. The bond market pressures could force
governments into deeper cuts in state spending programmes, including the
burgeoning cost of public pensions.
One study published earlier this week showed that UK pension funds
lost 4% of their value in 1994, their second worst performance in 20
years. For now funds appear to be increasing their investment in bonds
at the expense of equities to boost liquidity, a reflection of the
growing proportion of pensioners taking money out of the typical scheme.
The bigger question is what's to be done to avoid a much larger crisis
in the longer term.
Before Christmas the British Government published its new Pensions
Bill, designed to enact some of the recommendations of the Goode
Committee. There is much to welcome in the proposed legislation. But the
impression persists that the Bill is weakest on the proposed minimum
solvency requirements for private pension schemes. Our politicians need
to take a more robust lead on an issue which, while it may not come home
to roost this side of the millennium, could blight the old age of many
already contributing to pension schemes. They could start, as one report
suggested yesterday, by challenging the preposterous idea that a
productive working life is often over by the age of 50.

A NEW air link between Scotland and the United States was launched
officially yesterday, as British Airways stepped in to the gap left when
rivals Northwest pulled out of the Glasgow to Boston route last
November.
Now BA is to extend its Glasgow to New York service into Boston using
a Boeing 757 aircraft which will be permanently based at Glasgow
Airport.
Mr George Cooper, managing director of British Airways Regional, said:
''Our new service will appeal to the business and leisure markets at
both ends of the route, providing Scotland with an excellent air link,
important for tourism and inward investment.''
The recruitment of cabin crew for the new route has led to unease
among mainline shuttle crews, who fear their pay and conditions may be
eroded.
The special aircraft has been named Robert Louis Stevenson to mark the
centenary of the Scots writer.

In the latest of his serial diatribes against rail subsidies, Mr T E
Whittle neatly encapsulates the attitudes and prejudices of the
transport policies of the Government (December 24).
As with them neither the environmental dimension of the debate nor the
criterion of sustainability in transport merits a mention, leading
directly to unquestioned support of the inequitable assessment technique
for competing road and rail schemes which for decades has aggravated the
decline in the rail network.
In short, his views lack objectivity on the role that railways play in
improving the quality of life of the nation as a whole and on the
economic benefits that they confer.
The point is, and it is not surmise on the part of
rail/public-transport campaigners but a reasoned argument based on
experience, that investment is crucial if the rail network is
progressively to reduce its dependency on Government subsidy.
If examples are necessary, one need cite only Strathclyde PTE, East
Coast main line electrification, and the ''Sprinterisation'' of
ScotRail's rolling-stock as evidence that investment in railways
dramatically improves financial performance.
But, as objective rail campaigners concede, the Treasury's resources
are finite, making it essential for private capital to augment
Government investment in the rail network. However, while that is the
Government's stated objective, the means by which it is attempting to do
so is causing widespread anxiety both within the rail industry and in
its customers.
Current developments on the West Highland line justify these fears.
There the inequitable treatment of rail vis-a-vis roads is particularly
blatant, with the ''blanket'' 8% return on assets demanded of Railtrack
by the Treasury (in conjunction with subsidy withdrawal) proving to be
the ''final straw'' for the London sleeper service and destroying the
viability of the summer-season, steam-hauled specials.
No such demand is made of any Highland road, which would be equally
unachievable, and it is significant that even the Rail Regulator is
challenging the policy of fixed charges by Railtrack.
This damaging policy must be changed, and the impending, savage #400m
reduction in national rail subsidy reversed, otherwise many route-miles
face closure.
The Scottish Office must assist in challenging these unfair obstacles
to ScotRail's expansion ambitions.

I often enjoy reading Jack McLean's column and despite his
deliberately provocative remarks his articles are seldom without some
refreshing points of view. Disappointingly, however, he serves up a
well-worn excuse in defence of his atheistic stance (December 30).
On previous occasions he has not been slow to point out that his
acquaintance with the Bible is more than a passing one; yet, curiously,
this has not persuaded him of the truth of God's existence. It seems
that he sees certain situations as being God's fault, whereas in reality
the fault lies with fallen humanity.
God has given us the ability to make choices and in Jesus Christ has
even shown us how we ought to act in making those choices, namely, by
giving ourselves unselfishly in the service of others out of love and
consideration for God and our fellow human beings.
This should be our response to a loving God, knowing that Christ, his
Son, has already won a place for us in heaven.
Such conduct involves recognising God also as our Creator and our
Judge before whom one day we shall all have to give account. Of course,
among our choices we can choose to reject the truth of that message and
simply help ourselves instead.
Snatching at power or wealth in such a way as to gain status or to
exploit our fellow creatures, however, offends against the love that God
offers us and in which he wants us to find our fulfilment.
The truth is that God does not overlook the injustice in this world,
and surely there is a day coming when our actions, just or unjust, will
be judged.
And might not our New Year greetings then be composed with a little
more equanimity?

A MAN concerned in the supply of ecstasy worth #2250 has been put on
community service.
Richard Cormack, 20, admitted at Elgin Sheriff Court holding 90 tabs
of the Class A drug at his parents' home but claimed he did not stand to
benefit financially. He claimed he was to receive only a few tablets for
his own use.
Sentence had been deferred until yesterday for background reports. He
had previously admitted being concerned in the supply of the tablets on
September 28 at Samson Avenue, Portessie, by Buckie.
The find had been the result of a police tip-off.
Cormack, a factory worker, had provided information which resulted in
a two-year jail sentence being imposed on the man who gave them to him.
Sheriff Noel McPartlin told him: ''I have seriously considered a
custodial sentence. The Crown has accepted you were holding the drugs
for someone else but your part was also a very serious one. However, it
is with some hesitation I will make a community service order.''
Cormack was ordered to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work in the
community, the maximum allowed.

I read with interest an article by Mike Ingham entitled, New Zealand
lamb men are starting to worry about their 'natural' image (December
12).
Quite rightly your newspaper is examining the farming systems of New
Zealand on behalf of your consumer/readers who have an interest in not
only the quality of the meat produced but also in the way it is
produced.
While the article includes much factual balanced material there are
also some unfortunate allegations that are simply untrue. The most
bizarre allegation is that low-yielding but otherwise healthy dairy cows
are shot in the field. This does not happen.
As a result of selective breeding there is always a percentage of cows
culled for low-yield; but these animals are sent to licensed slaughter
houses for humane slaughter.
These animals have a substantial value of around NZ $500. Apart from
the natural concern of farmers to treat their animals humanely the
Scottish blood that flows in many New Zealand dairy farmers, including
myself, means that foregoing such revenue will not happen.
Unassisted lambing is part of some farming operations in New Zealand
but this is based on many years of selective breeding to generate new
flocks that do not need assistance of the intensity Europeans would be
familiar with. This type of farming requires careful management of the
ewe flock from pre-tupping right through to lambing as well as strict
ram control.
The implication that New Zealand farmers have only recently begun to
worry about animal welfare is quite wrong. New Zealand farmers are not
smug about animal welfare issues and for many years a Government Animal
Welfare Advisory Committee has been operating which sets high standards
for farmers to follow.
New Zealand enjoys a natural comparative advantage compared to most
countries in that we can grow grass almost year round and produce meat
and dairy products in low-cost extensive farming systems. It will not be
a surprise to your readers that in New Zealand we seek to utilise and
maximise this advantage.
The market-place for agricultural products is very competitive and
consumers are ever more discerning.
It would be very unfortunate if consumers formed opinions about New
Zealand agricultural produce based on wrong and misleading information.

Councillor Murray Tosh of Kyle and Carrick District Council seemed to
be a little naive in his letter about the reasons why his authority is
causing further delay in starting the construction of the new sewerage
works at Greenan (December 27).
First, he makes the rather ludicrous excuse that there is no reason
for any haste because the EC's clean water directive does not need to be
complied with until the year 2001.
He then proposes to use the mechanism of a local plan inquiry in the
hope that justification might be found for moving the new and
much-required sewerage works to an alternative site with the vague
notion that it could be somewhere inland.
What he failed to give are the precise grounds, under the various
planning acts, his council are using to oppose Strathclyde region's
proposals to use the Greenan location.
The use of an inland site away from the coast raises the question of
where and how the effluent produced by the new sewerage works is going
to be disposed of.
Is it to be re-routed by pipe back to the coast and into the sea or
has it to be discharged into the rivers Ayr or Doon?
Councillor Tosh obviously lacks knowledge of the technical problems of
sewage disposal and seems to be determined to keep on delaying the
construction of the sewerage works until responsibility for it passes to
the new non-elected water and sewage authority for South West Scotland.

In Kennedy Wilson's article (Pagan past put to rites, December 23), I
was interested in the reference to Mithraism.
There are remains of a Mithraic temple at Carrawburgh fort
(Brocolitia) in Northumberland which are easily accessible from the
Military Road, and we know that Mithras was particularly venerated in
the defended frontier regions of the Empire.
This is not surprising as he appealed to Roman soldiers, to whom he
was the god of war, justice, mutual obligation, and loyalty; a very
useful god to rely on as he combined so many virtues which they
respected and held dear.
That he would have been worshipped so far north shows how powerful his
influence had become after his adoption by the Romans following their
campaigns in Persia, where he was the sun god Mithra.
They virtually recreated him in the second and third centuries when
his following rivalled Christianity. Indeed, it has been suggested by
some theologians that had Constantine not removed constraints on the
early Christians Mithraism might well have flourished instead.
It was a soldiers' religion. The initiate had to pass through a
ceremony of seven steps, including an enactment of a feigned death and
resurrection, before attaining Mithraic light and liberation of the
soul; a very male-orientated cult.
Mithras was, above all, regarded as the creator; and although the way
in which he carried out this demanding task would be considered doubtful
in today's thinking, it might be no less credible than other notions . .
. including the ''Big Bang'' theory.

A WEIGHTLIFTER who frightened staff at a Clydebank disco with a
double-barrel shotgun was jailed for six years at the High Court in
Glasgow yesterday.
Paul McInnes, 27, of Onslow Road, Clydebank, admitted assaulting staff
at The Sound Factory disco, in Chalmers Street and illegally possessing
a shotgun.
Solicitor advocate Mr Maurice Smyth said McInnes, who had 16 previous
convictions, returned with the shotgun after being asked to leave by
stewards.
Two bouncers ran away leaving two cashiers to face McInnes after he
burst in brandishing the shotgun before leaving again within seconds.
Mr Smyth said that McInnes was a friend of the owner and normally was
allowed in free.
When he arrived at 12.30am on January 9, 1994, a steward demanded that
McInnes be searched and he objected and left.
Mr Smyth said: ''On his return, he frightened the staff but he showed
no intent in harming them and left after stating his grievance about
being put out earlier.''
However, Temporary Judge Alexander Wilkinson QC said the courts would
not tolerate crimes involving firearms.

In seeking to defend his criticisms of the hospital ''league tables'',
Iain Glen of the SNP puts forward a bizarre argument (January 3).
If the clinicians at the Western General Hospital, Glasgow, did indeed
dissociate themselves ''from any valid interpretation'' of the results,
this merely demonstrates that they care more for professional solidarity
than they do for statistics.
Dr Glen's view is on a par with those who reject all the statistical
evidence that smoking causes lung cancer, or that accidents at 30mph
cause fewer deaths than those at 50mph. What on earth are the ''sources
of error'' he refers to? What is ''statistical variance'' (it is clearly
not ''variance'', a technical term in statistics, and one that Dr Glen
has probably never heard of)?
I presume that if Dr Glen denies any validity to the hospital figures,
which tell us about events that actually happened, he would not give the
time of day to an opinion poll (which of course asks a hypothetical
question) showing that, say, 40% of those questioned said they would
vote SNP.

EMPLOYMENT Secretary Michael Portillo was asked yesterday to ensure
all computer keyboards were fitted with health warnings about the
dangers of repetitive strain injury.
Labour also demanded a public inquiry into allegations that some
computer manufacturers ''covered up'' knowledge of links between RSI and
continuous work at terminals and keyboards.
Lawyers believe that new allegations, emanating from the United
States, could pave the way to thousands of claims from RSI sufferers.
It is alleged that some manufacturers knew of the dangers as long ago
as 1985.
In October 1993, a High Court judge dismissed a claim for compensation
by a Reuter news agency employee, saying the term RSI had ''no place in
the medical books''.
However, since then, unions have won tens of thousands of pounds in
compensation for workers suffering from the complaint.
Labour said it was estimated that 150,000 British workers per year now
suffered from work-related upper limb disorders, including RSI.
Mr Peter Woods, a lawyer, said: ''The evidence we have seen in the
States is documentation from the manufacturer showing that they knew of
the risks of RSI years ago.
''That will mean that some people in Britain will be able to bring
claims from the States, where compensation is far greater than here, and
cases being brought here will be much stronger.''
Mr Ian McCartney, the Shadow Employment Minister, yesterday wrote to
the Health and Safety Commission and Mr Portillo, asking what
investigations and discussions the HSC had held on the issue of RSI, and
what action had been taken to warn people about the risk of it.
He said that he was also demanding immediate regulation to ensure that
all keyboards were fitted with warnings.
Mr McCartney said: ''The Government should act immediately. Within the
next 24 hours, there should be an announcement about the new set of
regulations, because for every day that advice is not given, there is
potentially someone else injured -- and injured quite badly -- by RSI.''

In Margaret Vaughan's report on health risks from oil tankers it is
stated, ''When the tanks on the ship are opened, benzene fumes escape
from the remains of the previous cargo. There is no means for harvesting
the benzene as it rises into the atmosphere'' (January 3). I find this
appalling.
Fifty years ago, the Second World War oil tankers could not join a
convoy until all dregs of previous cargo, including the gases, had been
removed from the tanks to diminish the risk of explosion in any
anti-convoy activity.
This usually involved a gas-freeing operation at anchor clear of oil
installations, etc. It could be a long activity as the only motive power
was the wind encouraged by long canvas ''chimneys'' hoisted to
mast-height.
Fifty years on the thought of tankers berthing at an installation and
then releasing the remains of a previous cargo beggar belief. There are
so many in-transit options now available which could ensure only
gas-free vessels berth.

PEOPLE seem to be fairly equally divided into those who find it easy
to get up in the morning, and those who do not. It is not a permanent
condition, however. Today's pensioners who make tea at 6am and listen to
Farming Today could easily be the students who lay indolently in bed
when they should have been at lectures. Nor, according to our most
respected writers, is getting up early particularly virtuous. It is true
that Trollope began writing before dawn. A sleepless Dickens often
walked the streets all night. But Charles Lamb argued vigorously that
the wisdom of rising with the lark was one of life's popular fallacies.
He had never got up early, he declared, without suffering a headache.
His friend Leigh Hunt maintained that for inhabitants of northern
climates, staying in bed on cold mornings was entirely natural. It was
all very well in Paradise, he said, but Adam had no need to shave, and
Eve did not emerge from her bower into three inches of snow.
The latitude of one's bed may well provide a clue to the problem. The
latest alarm clock, given five marks out of five in a consumer report,
is a light which imitates dawn -- taking half an hour to reach full
brightness, and only then starting to bleep. ''Initial scepticism about
light-influenced body-clock regulation turned to appreciation on first
use,'' said the tester. The alarm clock would therefore be of little use
near the Equator, where sunrise is as abrupt as the non-existence of
twilight.   The sudden switch from equatorial darkness to light may even
explain the excellence of African sprinters. In prehistoric times it
could have been quite easy to wake up lying next to a lion.   The modern
need for an alarm clock seems to vary inversely with motivation. ''My
favourite way to wake up is for a certain French movie star to whisper
in my ear at two-thirty in the afternoon that if I want to get to Sweden
in time to pick up the Nobel Prize for Literature, I had better ring for
breakfast,'' wrote Fran Lebowitz. ''This occurs rather less often than
one might wish.''

THE parents of a schoolboy robbery victim who was left fighting for
his life hit out yesterday at the ''totally inadequate'' sentences
passed on three of his teenage attackers.
Visibly distressed, Ann and Peter Ridley said the two years' detention
passed on two of the defendants and the six months given to another was
a ''shambles'' and ''nothing more than a slap on the wrist''.
''We are absolutely disgusted with the sentences . . . and feel we
have been let down by the law,'' said Mrs Ridley.
''Our son David suffered a fractured skull and had to be operated on
for a blood clot on the brain. He came within minutes of death and still
hasn't recovered. He will be scarred for life.''
Her computer engineer husband added: ''Those responsible should have
got as long as four years, although no sentence will ever really
compensate for what they did.''
The couple's outburst came after Inner London Crown Court Judge Jeremy
Fordham condemned what he described as a ''wicked pack attack'' on their
16-year-old son and one of his friends.
''It was a cowardly, vicious attack and, not content with beating
these people up, you robbed them leaving them on the ground,'' he told
the two 17-year-olds and their 15-year-old campanion, none of whom can
be named for legal reasons.
The three defendants, from Streatham, south-west London, were all
found guilty by jury last year of robbing their two victims and causing
them actual bodily harm.
The court heard they were part of a gang which set upon the pair as
they were leaving a Streatham leisure centre. After punching and kicking
them unconscious the gang robbed them as they lay on the ground.
The injured youths later recovered sufficiently to go to the local
police station but, while there, David, from West Norwood, south-west
London, collapsed.
He was taken to King's College Hospital, where his skull fracture was
diagnosed and the blood clot detected.
His mother said: ''It was literally life and death when they operated
on him. We didn't know whether he was going to wake up at all or wake up
a vegetable.
''The sentences were totally inadequate, nothing more than a slap on
the wrist. It's a shambles.''
Mr Ridley added: ''The Government said it is going to come down hard
on young offenders but where is the proof.''

* When the clocks chimed in 1995 they also
heralded the countdown to the millennium -- five
years that will witness a flurry of activity to
celebrate the dawn of a new era. If John Major is to
be believed, it's a heady time to be alive -- with
Britain on the threshold of a golden age that will
see living standards double. The realisation of that
vision will bear crucially on Diana Nicol Henderson,
Blair George Walker, Christopher John McGuire,
Jordan James Wardrope, and Rebecca Leigh
Watkin -- five founding members of the class of
'95, whose fortunes we will keep a close eye on
over the next five years. They make their debut in
turbulent times -- with our values under scrutiny
as never before; the prospects of a sea change
with the return of a Labour government by the time
they are up and running; and renewed doubts
about whether the international 'peace dividend'
will hold.
According to the Chinese, 1995 -- the Year of the
Pig -- will be propitious. From cradle to classroom, The Herald will
chart the progress of our famous five and their parents -- their
aspirations and frustrations, the first hurdles in welfare, health, and
education. Today Jennifer Cunningham introduces our fledgling Citizens
2000 -- here's looking at you, kids!
DIANA NICOL HENDERSON
* BANG in the middle of New Year's Day Diana Nicol Henderson arrived
at Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital after an easy five-and-a-half-hour
labour for her young mum, Brenda Walker.
Since then, she has been a model baby, bringing nothing but delight to
18-year-old Brenda and her partner, Barry Henderson, who is 24. They are
both from Milton of Campsie, but the lack of jobs has kept them on the
move in search of work over the last two years. Most recently they both
had jobs in shops in Blackpool, but when Brenda became pregnant they
decided to move back home. Living with Barry's family became too crowded
and they moved into accommodation for the homeless. They will take Diana
home to the house they have been busily cleaning, painting, and
furnishing at the homeless unit in Bishopbriggs, but hope now that they
are a family unit to move into mainstream housing before too long.
The new arrival has already had a great welcome from grandparents and
friends, and a pram and cot are ready and waiting. There is a pile of
baby clothes which belonged to Barry's niece: ''We were hoping we'd have
a girl so we could use all the clothes,'' he said. The next priority is
a job. ''I've worked at this and that. I tried being a bin man, but I
couldn't stand more than one day, but I'll give anything else a go,'' he
added.
REBECCA LEIGH WATKIN
* ADELE and Jonathan Watkin are very proud to have a Scots-born
daughter, although they both hail from Bolton in Lancashire. Rebecca
Leigh was born at 8.22 on New Year's morning at the Simpson Memorial
Maternity Pavilion in Edinburgh, a little sister for Joshua, who was
three last October.
Both 29, they have enjoyed life in Scotland since moving a year ago to
South Gyle in Edinburgh where Jonathan, a quantity surveyor, was
transferred with the builder Bryant Homes. Adele took on a part-time job
with Marks &amp; Spencer at the new South Gyle shopping centre but is not
yet sure whether she will be able to return once her six weeks'
maternity leave is up.
Joshua is happy at playgroup and is already beginning to pick up a
Scots accent, much to his mum's amusement. Both she and Jonathan enjoy
life in Edinburgh and have found people very friendly. They see being
some distance from their families as a disadvantage, but are expecting
an imminent visit. Luckily Jonathan's sister had come to visit for
Hogmanay and was able to hold the fort at home while Rebecca was born.
''I had an emergency caesarean section, but I was able to give it a go
this time, so I feel reasonably happy,'' said Adele.
CHRISTOPHER JOHN McGUIRE
* THE standard plastic hospital cot was decked out in frills for
Christopher John McGuire. At 4.35am, he was the first baby of 1995 at
Rutherglen Maternity Hospital and received VIP treatment which included
the gift of a beautiful white shawl.
''We were expecting a Christmas baby, but are delighted to have a New
Year one,'' said proud parents Joanna and Alexander McGuire, from East
Kilbride. Married three years ago in May, they were keen to have a
family and were saddened when Joanna miscarried last January.
Christopher is part of a mini baby boom among staff at JVC, which
makes televisions in East Kilbride, where Joanna, 26, is a production
leader and hopes to return after maternity leave, ideally on some form
of reduced hours. Sandy, 25, is a steam box operative at a clothing
company, Strathwest.
Home at the moment is a 16th-floor flat in a tower block in East
Kilbride, but with a housing policy which tries to take children out of
tower blocks if possible, they hope to move to a flat in a low-rise
block before young Christopher is walking.
In the meantime the latest addition is all set for a big welcome from
the family, which includes six young cousins as future playmates on the
McGuire side and a very proud Grandad, Ronald Nordone, who returned from
a visit to Joanna's sister in New Zealand just in time for the birth of
his first grandson.
BLAIR GEORGE WALKER
* BLAIR George Walker's arrival on the afternoon of New Year's Day has
ensured that the beginning of every year will be a hectic time for his
parents for the forseeable future. Big brother Lewis will be three on
Monday -- and Mum, Frances Tyma, has already calculated that in the year
2013 they will have 18th and 21st birthdays within days of each other,
not to mention minor events like Christmas and New Year.
Dad, George Walker, is a dab hand with babies after nearly three
years' practice and was happily wielding the feeding bottle in the Royal
Maternity in Glasgow, where Blair was born by caesarean section. Frances
is not looking forward to bumping the pram up and down two flights of
stairs to their flat in Ibrox, but it was largely her decision to come
home to Glasgow after their search for jobs took them to Southampton.
George loved his job there making television scenery for TVS and Frances
found a job with Scottish Amicable. She was able to transfer to Glasgow
and is now a branch administrator, while George, unable to find a job in
television, is using his joinery skills with City Windows.
It was the high cost of their rented flat combined with the lack of
facilities in Southampton itself which prompted the move. Now 27, both
are delighted to be near their families now that they have children and
Granny, June Walker, has proved a stalwart babysitter while when Frances
returned to work.
JORDAN JAMES WARDROPE
* JORDAN James Wardrope arrived in a calm and ordered way, as might be
expected of the child of two transport organisers. Mum, Susan, 29, and
Dad, Ian, 32, met while working for Transfleet Services in Stirling.
Susan is still an administrator there, while Ian is a transport
refrigeration engineer with Leaseway Services in Cumbernauld.
Little Jordan has slept soundly between feeds since making his
entrance at 3.19pm at Stirling Royal Infirmary, where he weighed in at
5lb 11[1/2]oz, although Mum and the doctors had expected him to be
bigger. He will go home to his parents' bungalow in Causewayhead just
outside Stirling. Already all four grandparents have been to marvel at
the New Year addition to the family, who is the third grandchild on
Ian's side of the family and second on Susan's, giving Jordan three
little cousins all within reach in Alloa and Kippen.
Susan hopes eventually to return to her job, having worked for 11
years for the same company, but has not yet worked out the details.

A LOCAL government union has expressed horror at plans for hundreds of
job cuts by Grampian Regional Council during 1995.
All 23,000 staff are to be offered redundancy, or early retirement for
the over 50s, as the council bids to reduce its deficit.
Today, Unison, which is the largest staff union and represents 4000
regional council members, will make four demands of the council when
they meet for discussions.
Ms Val Lockhart, regional officer for Unison, said: ''We are horrified
at the prospect of possibly hundreds of job cuts at a time when council
services are already cut to the bone.
''We are not satisfied that the council has justified the need for
such large-scale reductions and we will be insisting we see the
financial evidence.''
Unison said the council's procedures for selecting candidates for
voluntary redundancy did not take proper consideration of the
consequences of that reduction.
They were also concerned that the proposals had not been looked at in
the context of the forthcoming local government re-organisation.
''Because of the imminent creation of three new councils in the
North-east from the six existing ones, any large-scale staffing changes
are bound to impact on the staff and management of the districts,'' said
Ms Lockhart.
''We find it astonishing that the district councils have not been
consulted for their views on the region's job cuts.''
She also said that the Government's Staff Commission, set up to
oversee staffing implications of council reform, may object to the
region's plans.
At the meeting today, Unison will demand that:
* proper and meaningful consultation begins on the full reasons for
the proposed redundancies and ways of avoiding staff cuts;
* where it is agreed staff cuts are required, the methodology should
be agreed by the unions;
* other North-east councils be consulted for the views on the impact
of these reductions in the light of re-organisation;
* the Staffing Commission be asked for its advice on the legitimacy of
the council's proposals and that no decisions on staff reductions are
taken or implemented until this advice is received.

ROCKY and Rambo, two of the cinema's most influential heroes, were
both created by the same man, Sylvester Stallone. He may be famous for
his muscles, but there is more to the man than the end product of a
lifetime spent pumping iron. While his latest film, The Specialist, is
unlikely to launch a new folk hero to rival the previous two, it takes
his career one step further by casting him opposite Sharon Stone --
strong leading ladies do not feature in most of his films -- and, amid
all the mayhem expected of a Stallone vehicle, the role allows him a
passionate, if bizarre, love affair with his co-star.
He plays an explosives expert hired by Stone, part of a weird revenge
plot she has devised to get the Mafia mobsters who killed her parents.
Things become very complicated, indeed downright kinky, because the
relationship between the avenging woman and the hired, but noble, killer
is conducted largely by telephone. Stallone considers the role a
departure for his career. ''It's an embarcation into something I should
have done a long time ago,'' he said. ''The real core of my life has
always been dominated by the feminine mystique, yet there are very few
films I've done that have dealt with the all consuming sensual fantasies
of the opposite sex. In The Specialist I begin to do that and still
maintain the action element.''
When the couple finally meet, the physical attraction between them,
which has been building up during those phone calls and his surveillance
of her, erupts in a steamy scene in which they slowly undress each other
and end up naked making love in the shower. The sex scene may be more of
the same for Stone, but for Stallone it is something new.
He hopes the film will open up new fields for him as an actor, and
regards his celebrity as something of a curse. ''It both creates a
psychic stress and atrophies one,'' he said. ''When I was younger I
would revere other artists and almost look at them as father figures.
They'd walk around with a glow, some kind of aura of invincibility. When
you finally get up to their level and begin to hang out with them you
realise they are as nuts as you are.''
He is prouder of Rocky than Rambo, and is rueful about the fact that
he met three consecutive Presidents of the United States -- Ford,
Carter, and Reagan -- who all called him Rocky. He is not Rocky. Nor is
he Rambo. He is an actor who has tried to extend his range throughout
his career, although his attempts at comedy have found favour with
neither critics nor audiences. But at least he has tried.
The Rambo character was widely criticised for being fascist and
excessively violent, an unfair interpretation of the character in terms
of First Blood, the first film in which he appeared, although not of the
sequel, Rambo II which was a sweat-drenched, muscle-bound affair. But
Stallone stands by his man. ''The thing I liked about Rambo, which
unfortunately was lost on most people, was his sense of martyrdom,'' he
said. ''He had a sense of complete self-sacrifice. The man would abandon
any kind of pleasure or sense of normalcy for some greater cause. Rambo
never instigated anything. His entire career was based on running away
from the law or trying to rescue hostages, never overtly going after the
enemy.''
Currently filming Judge Dredd, Stallone is now 48, the owner of a
celebrated, if diverse, art collection, and a painter of some note whose
pictures sell for five-figure sums. The time will come when the body
cannot be displayed as it has been for so long, and he admits that at
his age he should start putting on his cape and being ''a little more on
terra firma''. But then he adds that the way sports medicine is going
there is no reason why he cannot keep his body pumped up like it is
until he is 75.

AN #85m general hospital in Lanarkshire could be the first in the
country to be built from private funds.
Officials at Lanarkshire Health Board are considering plans to finance
some, if not all, of the new Netherton general hospital in Wishaw by
private means.
The new 500-bed hospital would be a replacement for the current
600-bed Law Hospital.
Executives with the Law hospital trust are considering private funding
as a means of speeding up building work which is expected to begin by
the end of next year.
However, the plans for private funding were criticised by local MP
Jimmy Hood as ''privatisation by the front door''.
He plans to challenge health board executives at a briefing meeting
between Scottish MPs and Lanarkshire Health Board on Monday.
Law hospital trust's plans were defended yesterday by Mr Ian Ross,
director of planning and contracts, who said that, like all public
bodies, the area of private finance must be explored.
He denied that private funding meant private medicine: ''Our patients
will be treated as they are now: free of charge.''
A feasibility study commissioned from accountants Price Waterhouse
confirmed that the private sector would be interested. However, no
investors have been confirmed.
Yesterday, a Scottish Office spokesman said no plans had been received
from the trust but discussions had taken place on the subject of the new
hospital.
He stressed that the trust must take the Government's private capital
issue into account when considering funding.
''When you come up with a large-scale project like this, you must
investigate the possibility of private-sector finance.''
The hospital would then be leased from the private investors.
Law hospital currently draws on a wide population of patients in
Lanarkshire from Motherwell and Wishaw in the north to Biggar and Lanark
in the south. Officials say the move to Wishaw will make life easier for
most of their patients. The plan includes proposals for a special rail
link.
Private finance is also being considered for rebuilding the Royal
Infirmary in Edinburgh.
Britain is experiencing a brain gain in medical research, Health
Secretary Virginia Bottomley claimed yesterday.
The upbeat message came at a seminar at which scientists from the USA,
Canada, Australia, and Russia -- all of whom now work in the UK --
presented their latest research work to Mrs Bottomley and science
Minister David Hunt.
Among them were Professor Douglas Fearon, from Maryland, USA, who is
carrying out research on inflammation and abnormalities of the immune
system in chronic arthritis, and Canadian Dr Mark Lathrop, working in
Oxford, who has played a key role in a screening programme for diabetes
mellitus.
Both are employed here thanks to money from Wellcome Trust, an
organisation whose primary function is to fund academic research in
medical fields.
''British science in general and the Wellcome Trust in particular act
as a magnet for top scientists and research staff from across the world,
producing a 'brain gain' for Britain,'' said Mrs Bottomley.
Mrs Bottomley also revealed that #437m was spent on NHS research and
development in 1994-5, 1.2% of NHS expenditure. Only five years ago, the
percentage was 0.9.

A YACHTSMAN who last year was ordered to pay the #4300 cost of a
lifeboat rescue appeared in court yesterday on a drink-driving charge.
This time, 65-year-old Fred King was fined #1000 and banned from
driving for three years.
Last May, at Portree Sheriff Court, King admitted sailing his 30ft
yacht Traigh Mor while under the influence of alcohol and had sentence
deferred for a year for his good behaviour.
The court was told King had been found on board unable to walk by
Portree coastguards after an emergency call-out. A passenger, Miss
Antoinette Passmore -- a former Downing Street secretary -- was winched
off by helicopter and the boat was taken to Uig.
At Dingwall Sheriff Court yesterday, Sheriff James Fraser told King he
had obviously not been of good behaviour and the drink-driving
conviction would be taken into consideration when he returned for
sentence to the Portree court in five months' time.

<HEADLINE>Eight years for stabbing stranger</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>12</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980500678</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MAN who stabbed a stranger for no reason was sentenced to eight
years yesterday.
Lord Morison described 20-year-old Ian Finnie as ''a grave danger to
the public''.
The judge was told that Finnie, of Cambuslang, had previous
convictions for attempted murder and for carrying an offensive weapon.
The High Court in Glasgow heard how he plunged a knife into the chest
of Mr Joseph Gray, 34, as the victim waited for friends to come out of a
chip shop.
Mr Gray was taken to hospital with a collapsed lung but recovered and
later identified Finnie in a police line-up.
Finnie was found guilty of stabbing Mr Gray to his severe injury and
to the danger of his life in Craigallian Avenue, Cambuslang on May 28
last year.
Sending him to a Young Offenders' Institution for eight years, the
judge told him: ''It is clear from the evidence and from your previous
convictions that you constitute a grave danger to the public, and I feel
it is necessary to impose a long period of detention.''
Mr Gray, who gave his address as c/o the police, said he was waiting
on two friends coming out of a chip shop in the early hours of that
Saturday morning.
Finnie and three others approached, and the accused asked him who he
was and where he came from.
When he told him to go away, he was punched on the head by one of the
accused's companions.
He tried to run away but Finnie blocked his path, pulled out a knife
and stabbed him.
Witnesses said they saw Finnie in the vicinity and thought he had
something in his hand.
Finnie, who blamed another man for the attack, did not give evidence.
Mr Thomas Welsh, defending said the accused's parents had separated
when he was quite young and from the age of 13 he had become
institutionalised.
''Social workers indicate this is part of the reason for his
anti-social behaviour and for the time he has spent in custody,'' he
said.

A 'teardrop' has been shed in pubs throughout Scotland with the
passing of the quarter gill. John Linklater investigates how publicans
and their regulars are measuring up to the metric change
DOWN at The Quarter Gill the regulars have their own way with whisky
weights and measures. They describe the difference between the old
imperial and the new metric units as a ''ba' hair'', a ''drip'', a
''teaspoon'' or, with a hint of sentimental farewell to a little piece
of Scottish heritage, a ''teardrop''.
Everyone agrees there is nothing much in it. The quarter gill might be
gone, another victim of EU directives, but there is no rush to rename
the pub. Certainly not to the 35 Ml, the spirits measure issuing since
the turn of the year from converted optics. At 90 pence it remains one
of the best value drams in the city of Glasgow.
That was how the pub got its name. It was a convenient way of
advertising the generosity of that reassuring measure which became a
trade mark of free houses, particularly in the west of Scotland.
Significantly, it remains one of three slightly defiant The Quarter Gill
public houses in the city. Therefore, we must be specific and state that
our research crawl began yesterday at The Quarter Gill in Oswald Street,
just around from The Arches theatre where the trains rumble from Central
Station.
It is comfortable and friendly. As competitive as the prices only in
the rush to get to the bar. The walls feature boxing photographs,
reflecting the previous professional background of licensee Willie Hart
who gained the Scottish middleweight belt in 1961. He admits he might be
considering a re-naming to The Old Quarter Gill, as a commemorative
touch more than anything else.
The transition has caused little stir. Few comments have been received
from regulars. The expenditure on new optics was #200 from an
Edinburgh-based firm, but with a life-expectancy of not much more than a
year, optics are regularly renewed in any case. The fact is that an old
quarter-gill shop going over to 35 ml measures is the least traumatic
place to be in the metric transition, except perhaps private golf clubs
and social clubs which are exempt from the legislation adopted by the
British Government in response to the directive.
Even so, regulars in The Quarter Gill are correct to discern a slight
difference in their haufs, however slight. A demonstration involving a
new 35 ml measure poured into an old quarter-gill pewter measure
revealed a hair's breadth shortfall. The quarter gill is a fractionally
larger measure, converting to 35.5 ml to be precise. As our survey
continued, taking us to The Quarter Gill on Dumbarton Road, we were
given the precise saving in spirits by licensee Ricky Monaghan. After
the conversion to the metric measures he saves a half measure of spirits
out of a 1.5 litre bottle on the optic. A profit of 50 pence, offset by
the requirement to display new optics, signs, and price-lists.
''I have just kept the prices the same at #1 for the new measure of
whisky. It is more of a nuisance than anything, but what is annoying is
that the quarter gill was an old Scottish measure and part of our
heritage.
''Regulars were joking about having to rename the pub. There was a bit
of a wind-up suggestion that The Quarter Gill would become an illegal
name. The measure may no longer exist, but there are pubs called The
Flying Horse or The Drunken Duck, and horses no more fly than ducks get
drunk. In 10 years' time we'll have people in here saying that they
remember the days of the real quarter-gill measures.
''It is unfortunate that the bureaucrats in Brussels have intervened,
and annoying when you look at any bar in Portugal, Spain, or Greece, or
just about any bar in Europe. They never use measures at all. The barman
just pours it out. Britain, with so many people and bodies that govern,
seems to be the only country upholding this directive. I have publican
friends in Ireland who are just refusing to go metric.''
There are other rumoured pockets of resistance in pubs around
Shettleston and Parkhead. Along Duke Street in Dennistoun there is
belligerence in signs outside pubs which still advertise prices for
quarter-gill measures. But the change to metrics seems, sadly, to have
coincided with the sudden demise of the third The Quarter Gill public
house. It closed a couple of weeks before Christmas, which may be
symbolic. Or maybe it was the chagrin of impending metrics that proved
the final straw.
Yet the relative fairness of the quarter-gill conversion to the 35 ml
measure remains a triumph for the Scottish Licensed Trade Association
which lobbied hard for this larger measure, retaining a semblance of
Scottish distinctiveness over the 25 ml measure adopted widely in
England to replace the sixth of a gill. Traditionally, the sixth of a
gill is most common in Aberdeen and the North of Scotland where the new
25 ml measure will dominate along with small price increases to take
into account the increase from an equivalent of 23.67 ml.
The problem area is the traditional fifth of a gill measure, prevalent
in most brewer-owned pubs and used widely in most pubs in Central
Scotland. The fifth is caught in a kind of no-man's land, converting to
28.4 ml, between the new 25 ml and 35 ml measures. The Scottish Licensed
Trade News reports that distillers are urging licensees to move upwards
to the 35 ml measures to encourage larger volume sales to offset lower
gross profit margins, but bar price increases are inevitable and
justified, even if this is liable to antagonise regulars.
The alternative for former fifth-of-a-gill houses is to drop to the
new 25 ml measures, offering 3.4 ml less spirits at an unchanged price.
This is the option offered to Billy Dallas at his Scottish
Breweries-owned local, which he declines to name, and he says that
regulars are highly unimpressed by the justification that the smaller
measure will subsidise new optics and ''retraining of staff''.
''That was what we were told over the bar,'' he scoffs. ''What
retraining? Are they teaching staff to haud their arm up shorter or
longer for the new metric measures? Without a doubt this is a case of
the punter being asked to pay the price of bureaucracy.''
Back at The Quarter Gill in Oswald Street, Alan Bruce is equally
resentful over the interference with Scottish measures. The narrower his
glass, the more he is convinced he is being diddled as he surveys his
double vodka. ''It is discrimination against the people, forced on us by
the EU. I worked in Holland for years and they didn't even know what
measures were.''
Which explains the attraction for a pub that refuses to surrender the
spirit, if not the measure, of the quarter gill. One thing is certain.
Whether it is the Aberdonian's dram, the Glaswegian's hauf, the
Edinburgher's nip, the Borderer's wee goldie, the tourist's Scotch, or
the toff's large one, there are some names that legislation cannot
obliterate, and that in itself creates a nonsense of the Euro objective
to standardise the serious business of ordering a drink.

THE director of Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre, Mr Giles Havergal, was
awarded the city's St Mungo Prize yesterday.
The prize of #1000 and a gold medal is given every three years to the
citizen who has done the most during that time ''for the good of Glasgow
city by making it more beautiful, healthier or more honoured''.
Mr Havergal has been the theatre's director for 25 years.
Announcing the award, Mr Pat Lally, leader of Glasgow District
Council, said: ''Giles Havergal has been one of the major players to
have boosted Glasgow's reputation internationally as a centre of
artistic excellence.
''Under his inspired direction during the last 25 years, the Citizens'
Theatre has won a deserved reputation as one of Britain's most
provocative and innovative repertory theatres.
''He has made a sustained contribution to the success of the theatre
as it celebrates its 50th birthday in Gorbals. Indeed, the recent
restyling of the theatre building itself has played its own part in the
environmental regeneration of that part of Glasgow.''
When Mr Havergal joined the theatre as director in 1969, at the age of
31, he was its seventh in nine years. Since then, he has attracted
actors such as Moira Shearer, Glenda Jackson, and Rupert Everett and has
brought international companies to perform at the theatre.
Mr Havergal said: ''I am obviously very honoured and very pleased to
receive this award, particularly because I think it makes the point that
the theatre can contribute to the life of the community and this is what
we at the theatre strive to do.''
Previous winners of the St Mungo prize include former Lord Provost
Susan Baird, author Jack House, and Sir William Burrell.

As the St Mungo prize is awarded to Giles Havergal,Herald Arts Editor
KEITH BRUCE pays tribute to the Citizens' director
THE honouring of Citizens' Theatre artistic director Giles Havergal
with Glasgow's tri-ennial St Mungo Prize could be said to represent the
city's final acceptance of a talent it had found difficulty in dealing
with 25 years ago.
Equally, of course, it could mark the merging of the once-radical
Gorbals ideas factory with the city establishment. Or the fact that
nobody is liable to be much excited by what happens on a stage these
days.
When Glasgow-born and Oxford-educated Giles Havergal was attracted
north from the Palace Theatre, Watford, in 1969 at the age of 31,
controversy attended the Citizens' almost immediately. His first
selection of plays, which included Orton and Bond, was rejected by an
interfering theatre board. His first season, which eventually opened
with Tennessee Williams's The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore was a
flop.
Havergal, by then joined by designer Philip Prowse and writer/director
Robert David MacDonald, in a subsequently hugely productive triumverate
imported from Watford, went in to year two with a programme of
well-known classics but often presented in a way audiences had never
seen them.
It was a reading of Hamlet that caused the real furore, and set the
mould for the Citizens' reputation. An all-male cast, often next to
naked, and a petulant delinquent of a Prince David Hayman kept the
letters column of The Glasgow Herald -- and more of the seats -- well
filled. Glasgow Corporation's treasurer, who sat on the theatre board,
proposed withdrawing the city's grant.
It was far from the only controversial show at the Gorbals theatre.
Havergal also sought to promote the theatre's ''otherness'', making a
virtue of its location in a notorious former slum. A simple graphic
style to its publicity was matched by low ticket prices, with many free
seats at previews and for the less well off.
The result was large audiences for theatre that was often challenging,
usually very stylish, and drawn from across Europe. After the then
chairman Bill Taylor backed Havergal over that first Hamlet, the board
and the city fathers have rarely dared bat an eyelid, excepting the
occasional headline-seeking opposition Tory.
Indeed, much public money has been poured into the Citizens' building
-- after the company, led by Havergal, refused to move to purpose-built
premises. Havergal typically lavished praise on the partnership that
made the renovation possible but then lost no time in converting the new
foyer into useable performance space.
Perhaps, in fact, the city has been very slow to recognise officially
the maverick talent in its midst. Havergal was awarded the OBE in the
Queen's Birthday Honours in 1987. The St Mungo Prize and the kind words
of Councillor Lally are perhaps a sign that at last the city recognises
he will always go his own way.

LABOUR last night challenged Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to rule out
reports that Treasury officials were considering imposing a tax on
credit cards.
However, a Treasury spokeswoman said: ''We can't rule it out. We can't
rule it in. We don't know at the moment.
''We are just getting over the November Budget. We have no comment to
make.''
It is believed that Britain would be the first country to consider
such a move which, if approved, could be announced by the Chancellor as
part of this year's Budget.
Treasury officials are said to have suggested last year that credit
cards be taxed to raise revenue for last November's Budget.
It is understood they proposed an annual levy of #10, which would rake
in an estimated #200m.
Mr Clarke is said to have ruled out the suggestion, mindful of the
huge controversy he was already facing over VAT on fuel.
A credit card tax plan also poses numerous complications such as
whether to apply a tax to debit cards -- which often double as cheque
guarantee cards -- as well as credit cards.
Ms Dawn Primarolo, a member of Labour's Treasury team, said: ''I am
very surprised the Treasury is not prepared to rule this out as a
non-starter.''
Warning of the impact on the retail industry if people restricted
their use of credit cards, she said: ''Many people have more than one
credit card, plus charge cards with different department stores. Each
one of those could be taxed.
''The Government got elected promising to reduce taxation. It is
desperate to take money from people now in indirect tax in the hope that
they will not notice, to try and bribe the electorate at the next
General Election with tax cuts.''
The prospect of a credit card tax was greeted with a predictable
coolness from issuers of cards, who said they did not know how such a
scheme would work.
A spokeswoman for Barclaycard, the largest issuer of credit cards in
Britain, said: ''Any moves in this direction might create a distortion
in the market, particularly with regards to Europe.
''I believe there are no precedents for this on the continent. And
people who take out a credit card in Britain don't just use it in
Britain. How would that be taken account of?
''It is a complex issue. What about other forms of payment such as
debit cards and cheque guarantee cards?
''At a time when credit cards are very popular, the Government would
need to look very carefully at the effects it might have at a time when
confidence is still quite fragile.''

Catherine Brown reports that mineral water producers are on the crest
of a billion-pound wave
TIME to take the waters? Pep up the system with a mineral cocktail
from an appealing bottle of clear, clean water which will do little for
the taste buds, but plenty for inner cleanliness. When people took ''the
waters'' a century ago, it was an antidote to over-rich eating.
Today ''the cure'' may still be necessary, but in the past decade it
has also become a daily habit -- a #1000m industry which makes the
Victorian spa cure for the rich seem like a drop in an artesian well.
What boardroom is without its single-serving-size of mineral water,
what sport without its bottled-water sponsor? After the fashion models
on the 1994 Paris catwalks were seen clutching bottled water as the
latest fashion accessory, who could ignore the bottled water's message
of health and body consciousness.
It was the French, of course, who began the revival of water as a
health cure in the early 80s with the advertising-led
internationalisation of Perrier.
Then other countries with as good, if not better, natural mineral
water saw the advantages of boring a hole through many layers of rock to
a lucrative water supply. Some countries, like Scotland, could boast
water which had been ageing underground for 35 years, uncontaminated by
current pollution, making it an attractive alternative to the dubious
quality of some municipal tap water. It was a persuasive sell.
In those days, the bottled water companies were cagey about putting
details of the mineral content on the label and the taste was the only
guide to whether there was a lot or a little. The difference between a
mineral water and a spring water was not clear, and there was no
regulation defining natural, as opposed to an artificially-carbonated
water.
This was sorted out with an EU rule book directive (777) to which most
European bottled water now conforms, and labels provide most of the
things you need to know. Like the high-mineral content of a water such
as Contrex (over 1000 mg per litre) which makes it unsuitable for
drinking with food. It comes into the category of medicine-water with a
slimming/health cure purpose.
In the blue-tiled Source Pavilion at Contrexeville, several thousand
still come each year to take the waters. Their daily dose from the
silver taps in the pavilion of the mineral-rich water is worked out
medically, according to their problem -- kidney stones, gout or
intestinal disorders. Joining them are those on a health and fitness
regime, using the diuretic water as part of a slimming cure.
Light mineral waters (less than 500 mg per litre mineral content such
as Scotland's leading brand, Strathmore Spring) can be taken without
restriction, making them good thirst quenchers. Whether it is necessary
to drink this kind of bottled water on a daily basis, instead of
municipal tap, is largely dependent on the state of your tap water.
When in London, a bottle of single-serving mineral water is not a
fashion accessory but a necessity. Municipal tap water in the US is also
undrinkable. In some parts of the world it can be a serious health
hazard. But Scotland has good tap water, some of it as good, if not
better, than some bottled water.
This is fine if you happen to be near a tap, but for those on the move
or stuck in a boardroom, the bottled water alternative to sugary
carbonated drinks or endless cups of caffeine-rich tea and coffee is
growing in popularity, say Maureen and Timothy Green, authors of the
revised and up-dated Good Water Guide to the World's Best Bottled
Waters*.
Water consumption is growing and outpacing all other beverages on a
global scale. In Europe, it is already bigger than carbonated soft
drinks.
What this means for small countries, like Scotland, with good supplies
of high-quality underground water, is that they are now getting a larger
slice of the cake. French Perrier is no longer de rigueur.
Local water has become environmentally correct. The transport of
bottles of water around the world is wasteful and polluting in terms of
fuel use.
The Good Water Guide has tracked down some 250 waters in 42 countries
and provides background on each company, plus details of the mineral
content of the water. What it fails to say, though, is anything about
the price. Not even a warning of the outrageous mark-ups (300% is not
unusual) which some restaurants continue to impose.
On the other hand, it is useful to have a run-down on local bottled
waters. To know that in Scotland, though Highland Spring (from
Blackford) is the largest UK producer, the top-selling local drink is
Strathmore Spring. And that there are smaller operations producing
Caledonian Spring (from the Campsie Fells); Gleneagles Crystal Clear;
Lovat (from near Inverness); Caithness Spring: Findlays (from the
Lammermuir Hills) and Fionnar (from west of Loch Ness) plus Scottish
originated own-label supermarket waters.

STEPHEN McGINTY interviews Kirsty Hume, a young Scot with the fashion
world at her feet. She tells him: 'Everybody does kiss and hug, and go
''Darling!'' but that's all a front.'
IF YOU ask Kirsty Hume to forget the rag-trade world of supermodels
and concentrate instead on picking a superhero to play, she pauses, hums
and haws, and responds: ''Penelope Pitstop! I'd love to do a Penelope
Pitstop movie.''
As a superhero, the cartoon heroine just squeezes into the cramped
company of costumed heroes. She lacked superpowers but her natural
ability to do the splits as she ran verged on the fantastic.
It's a revealing choice which discloses the tender age and elegant
physique of the Ayrshire model who last year strutted confidently on the
catwalks before stars such as Sylvester Stallone, Prince, and Hugh
Grant, while the world's fashion photographers bathed her in
flashlights. The cartoon heroine of BBC Children's TV had legs as long
as Kirsty's and forever fled the licentious cackle of The Hooded Claw.
And despite the satirical Ab Fab view of the fashion world, pressures
behind the scenes can breed a hotbed of open claw catfights as well as
the attention of cracked undesirables.
Speaking at home in Ayr in the last few days of her festive break
before stepping back into the well-clothed whirlwind of work, Hume said:
''Fashion is not the way it's presented. Everybody does kiss and hug,
and go 'darling!' but that's all a front. In the nature of all
businesses, there is a lot of bitchiness.
''There are catfights and backstabbings. And it's so busy during a
collection that you do get bitchy. There's been a lot of times when it's
so bad I just want to quit. When you think, 'No more'. But it's my
career, you can't just quit your job because you're unhappy.''
At 18, Kirsty Hume has entered 1995 with the knowledge that her star
is rising. She remains only a drop of a designer hemline behind the
supermodels and the right to drop her second name. Kirsty, this year,
could be joining Cindy, Naomi and Claudia on the first name phone
rollo-decks of the world's leading designers.
The signs are there to be seen. Last year her face graced the cover of
Harper's Bazaar in the US and Italian designer Gianni Versace picked
her, after only six months on the catwalk circuit, to be his
show-stopping finale bride. Though this honour is usually reserved for
his favourite, Versace decided Hume should carry no-one's train but her
own.
The long runway to that moment, and the aftershow party with Stallone
and Prince, began with four years of child-modelling, education at
Wellington School, and an Arts Foundation course.
She was spotted on a modelling assignment in Paris by a Miami agency
which brought her to America and the demoralising round of catalogue
cattle calls from which she was plucked by top photographer Patrick
Demarchelier.
A year ago, Hume began stepping out at shows by Donna Karen, Calvin
Klein, and Ralph Lauren. It seemed she was destined to be just another
pretty face among hundreds, but Steven Meisel saw something more. The
photographer responsible for Madonna's Sex book and the careers of
Linda, Christy, and Naomi, pushed her further along the golden path
where she was aided by her Parisian agency. After a year of hype when it
has appeared that the fashion filament might burn out with
over-exposure, Hume has her theories on that score.
''I think the reason that fashion is receiving so much attention is
movie stars are no longer glamorous. Movies today are often about
reflecting real life and a lot of that is just not very pretty. So I
think that's one of the reasons fashion is focused on.''
She's not worried about the lights slowly dimming over the next few
years so long as she can continue to work and earn a living. Not really
a problem when you consider the potential of her pay packet, which is
estimated at thousands of pounds a day.
Art remains close to her heart. Among her favourites include the
surreal designs of Salvador Dali and pop artist Andy Warhol. She still
paints in the Greenwich Village flat she shares with three pals from her
Miami modelling days, but now the subjects are fantasy-based --
''fairies and things.''
Before getting dressed paid the bills, she considered textile and
jewellery design as a possible career.
Though her work leads to the opportunities of a lifetime, it's a life
she is still growing into. ''Modelling has made me more self-confident
but it's also made me at times a little less so. I've learned a lot
about people and I know now how nasty people can be, not just in the
fashion world.
''It's difficult being a 19-year-old and living in New York. There are
a lot of nutty people out there and a part of me is very vulnerable.''
It's a vulnerability that rests easy in her home town of Ayr. The
year-end holiday was a chance to unwind: ''It's great to do the usual
things like sleep, relax, speak to my friends, eat fish 'n' chips and
drink Irn-Bru. With success you learn who your real friends are, but
with my close friends I can still hang out and catch up on what's been
going on here. There isn't any jealousy or hassle.''
Throughout our phone conversation Kirsty had been cool but pleasant, a
professional, but one incident revealed the girl beneath the
wonder-woman. She panicked: ''Shit! My dad's back. God, I can't believe
he's back that early!''
''Why have you got someone in there you shouldn't?''
''No, he hates me smoking in the house.''
At home in Ayr, where ''there isn't any jealousy or hassle,'' just
Irn-Bru and fish suppers.

VOMITING and nausea in pregnancy can be controlled using Sea Bands,
elasticated wrist bands which hold a small button. A recent Italian
medical study found evidence that they had measurable beneficial
effects, says a report in Monitor, the weekly GP magazine.
They work on the principle of acupressure, an ancient Chinese
technique which applies pressure to certain points in the body to
relieve specific ailments.
Sea Bands were invented to help overcome seasickness among the
yachting fraternity, then anecdotal evidence began to emerge that they
reduced travel sickness too. Some cancer patients receiving chemotherapy
also find them beneficial. Sea Bands can be obtained from Boots and
leading chemists, price about #6.

ANY day now the Government will publish the dud doctors Bill, known by
its official title as the Medical Act (Amendment) Bill. The first
Medical Act was passed in 1858 to outlaw quacks. The purpose of the
coming Bill is to discipline sloppy doctors whose professional
competence is found to be ''seriously deficient''.
It should finally put paid to the old joke that doctors are more
likely to be struck off for sleeping with their patients than for
killing them through neglect. That criticism has become less true in the
dozen or so years that the new law has been in the making.
In future, doctors whose work is so poor as to put patients at risk
will be ordered to undergo corrective retraining. This will be an
alternative to bringing a charge of serious professional misconduct,
with its sledgehammer procedures. The new Bill is designed to give the
public added protection and is welcomed by doctors themselves, even
though it will mean them paying higher fees to their regulatory body,
the General Medical Council.
Although fewer than 150 dud doctors a year are expected to be weeded
out by the new system, it comes at a time when the medical profession is
experiencing a severe bout of introspection. A month ago this column
reported how doctors feel their professional status to be challenged by
the twin pressures of assertive patients and aggressive managers.
Subsequent articles in the British Medical Journal confirm doctors to be
in a frenzy of self-flagellation, or at least a ferment of self-doubt.
A BMJ editorial headed Inhumanity of Medicine accepts that doctors as
a breed are callous, rude and uncaring. It goes on to admit that they
have a limited facility to treat their patients as human beings. The
evidence cited is of cancer patients who are subjected to the most
intensive regimes of chemotherapy. They are pushed to the extremes of
their endurance, and often to death's door by treatments that a hundred
years hence may be regarded in much the same light as bleeding by
leeches is today.
The article goes on to argue that the medical care doctors provide is
not geared to support very sick people. Patients with distressing
chronic illness need, above all, the attention and friendship of one
doctor whom they can come to trust. Instead, the NHS has a built-in lack
of continuity and patients are looked after by constantly changing teams
of doctors and nurses.
Among other things, it is stated that doctors lack kindness, are
thoughtless and fail to handle sick people humanely. These deficiencies
are put down mainly to the mind-numbing narrowness and intensity of
medical education: ''Two years spent in the company of a corpse is not
the most imaginative introduction to a profession that, more than any
other, needs to develop the skills of talking to distressed people.''
The editorial recommends a more broadly based preparation for trainee
doctors to ensure that they are more rounded people, and remain so.
Otherwise it is feared that many doctors will continue to live in such
an overcharged and demanding atmosphere that the central reason for what
they are doing -- the wellbeing of their patients -- is forgotten.
In a separate BMJ article, Sir Maurice Shock, the Oxford political
scientist, offers the doctors a diagnosis of why they are so hung-up
about the world around them. He thinks it is because doctors were slow
to wake up to the consumer revolution and its effect on the NHS. For a
long time, he says, the profession thought the turbulence would pass it
by. It failed to read the social and political signs.
''The NHS remained in the mould of the Co-op from which it had sprung,
though the lessons to be learned from Marks &amp; Spencer had been visible
for years,'' he comments.
Doctors failed to seize the opportunity and were not prepared for the
right-wing blitzkrieg when it struck. Sir Maurice advises doctors not to
swim against the tide that has already changed society to one in which
the consumer is cosseted, protected and powerful. He thinks doctors need
a new professional organisation; they must learn more about health
service management -- and be willing to get their hands dirty about
priorities and resources.
Against that background it would appear that action is needed not only
to boost the competence of doctors but also their confidence. Good news
in that respect comes in two other government moves. One is a revamp of
medical research and training, which Sir Maurice Shock defines as the
keys to better medicine. The second is a pledge by health secretary
Virginia Bottomley to give doctors a greater executive input in running
the new style NHS.

Persistence pays off as Trencherman revisits the Puppet Theatre to
sample a meal, free from the constraints of sod's law
ACONFESSION: there are times when even food writers and restaurant
critics don't feel like eating but, thanks to some prior arrangement,
are forced to. At such times you find yourself tasting, rather then
dining. The exercise is valid enough -- wine writers do it all the time
-- though it hardly gets you into the spirit of the place unlucky enough
to have you at table when your appetite has done a bunk. Given that
there is more to eating than lifting a knife and fork this is
unfortunate.
Sometimes everything has a chance to come together, and of such
moments is great dining made.
Equally unfortunately the writer may actually be in the mood for a bit
of real research -- appetite honed, mood good, company excellent -- only
to discover that expectations are being served up an indifferent repast.
That is sod's law.
The first time I visited The Puppet Theatre sod's law operated against
me. The service was shaky, management indifferent, and after one
stunning dish of scallops the meal proceeded on a lacklustre course. I
was surprised, to say the least, given that I had heard much of the
entrepreneurial Ron McCulloch's ambitions for the place.
Having only been open a few weeks I decided to rest the pen and return
when they might have got the act together (the only problem was that
unlike real theatre previews no-one was discounting the tickets).
Another sod's law then applied whereby other potentially more exciting
venues put the return visit into the farthest pigeon hole until eight
months later I found myself dining a quattro.
From the moment of arrival you could sense a change. The greeting was
positive. The service turned out to be equally so. Carol McCulloch has
taken firm control of front of house. The former sous chef is now in
charge of the kitchen. You can dine in the ark-like conservatory or in
one of the warren of rooms in the building proper. We were guided to
what was announced as the altar room. The architectural effect of the
conservatory is said to indicate Gaudi; our dining space might best be
described as Glasgow West End baronial with mantleshelves gone awry --
indeed the shelving (aka altar) was squint.
The tables looked serious, laden with gleaming cutlery and crisp
ribboned napery, each large enough to permit four to dine in comfort.
There is muzak, which in this price bracket I would not expect, and
given the close confines of the room not even Vivaldi at his most
raucous could come between you and your neighbours -- of which there
were to be none on the evening of my visit.
The service was helpful but discreet, though on a busy evening I
suspect they'd need a sort of spy camera to seek out the needs from
every nook and cranny. The breads proffered were exciting in variety,
and they were warm. There was unsalted butter.
Our table was soon embroiled in avid conversation over who was
choosing what from the menu. Certainly this was a good sign, since it
was not due to the length of the carte but rather because the
descriptions called for debate, and were enough to persuade us not to
double order a dish if possible. There is a set dinner menu, of dishes
not on the carte, for #28.
I chose the chicken consomme, always a good test of the kitchen, and
it was perfection itself. Clear yet rich tasting with a fashionable
julienne of crisp vegetables. The twice baked smoked haddock souffle got
a rave review.
There was success in the main course department also. A properly
medium-rare fillet made use of quality beef, moist when presented, and
enlivened by a fresh horseradish and brioche crust, the dish set in a
rich Madeira sauce composed mainly of the meat juices. The seared --
94's trend word running into 95 -- tuna was succulent, the lime and
coriander sauce sharply contrasting. The scallops which came with it
were actually queenies. We debated this. There is a mighty difference
between a scallop and a queenie -- if the latter are over raked, we'll
end up with no scallops -- and settled for baby scallops as a fairer
description.
Without being designer finicky, the platters of food were elegantly
plated in the kitchen, and this was particularly true of the wild rabbit
dish. It was good to see this on the menu, a brave move since the beast
has never really recovered its culinary position since being almost
poisoned out of existence. (It reminded me of days of yore at Cromlix
House in Perthshire where the plethora of bunnies on the lawn deemed
that they should only be served in winter when the curtains were shut).
The saddle had been nicely pan fried, with the legs roasted and
crossed to the side (well, two of the legs). There didn't have to be a
hiccup, but there was. Very gently, but very specifically, I had asked
for the sea bream to be lightly cooked. The fish was baked to perdition.
The error was the more highlighted by the excellence with which I was
surrounded.
In the pudding department the hot apple charlotte was pronounced
tip-top. I can certainly vouch for the sharp lemon cheesecake. They have
some new-fangled push-button espresso coffee machine made by Melita
which in this case didn't produce the goods, though I hear they are
going to speak to the engineer. Why you should need a doctorate in
quantum-physics to get an espresso coffee in Glasgow outside of Central
Station and the City Merchant restaurant down in Candleriggs I do not
know. Perhaps the lovely Linda from that latter establishment could set
herself up as a consultant. Come to think of it, they can manage a fair
cup across Byres Road in the Cul-de-Sac (another R McCulloch
establishment). Perhaps I'll repair there next time -- and on the
evidence of this meal there will certainly be a next time -- clutching
my petit fours. Well worth seeking out.
* The Puppet Theatre, 11 Ruthven Lane, off Byres Rd, Glasgow. Tel: 041
339 8444. Tues-Sun lunch and dinner. About #30 per person excluding
wine. Three courses from #13.95 at lunch.

DAMASCUS: A radical Palestinian group said yesterday that four of its

Washington, Thursday
PRESIDENT Clinton has nominated a special envoy to attempt to resolve
the Cyprus dispute. He is Richard Beattie, a New York lawyer who served
in the Carter administration.
The Americans are concerned that the long conflict between Greece and
Turkey over the island may explode again.
Both countries are being drawn into the Balkan conflict, and the
deteriorating situation in eastern Turkey, where Kurds are fighting a
bitter war of secession, is weakening the democratic government in
Ankara and may precipitate uncontrollable upheavals.
The State Department is under no illusion that settling the Cyprus
question would resolve the problems in Bosnia or Kurdistan, but believes
that a precautionary diplomatic effort is worth attempting.
It must know how difficult Mr Beattie's job will be.
He will visit the island soon for talks with President Clerides and
Rauf Denktash, who has led the Turkish Cypriots for nearly 40 years, and
will then visit Ankara and Athens.
He is not the first American official to make the pilgrimage. In 1964,
after the original Cyprus constitution collapsed, President Johnson sent
former Secretary of State Dean Acheson to mediate. He failed.
Three years later, Johnson sent a future secretary, Cyrus Vance, who
succeeded in defusing a crisis but failed to resolve the underlying
problem.
The island was partitioned after yet another crisis, in 1974, when
Turkey invaded the north. More than 200,000 people lost their homes,
most of them Greeks.
President Nixon and his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, permitted
the invasion and the partition, because they disliked the Greek Cypriot
leader, Archbishop Makarios, and sympathised with the military junta
then ruling Greece.
That junta was removed in a coup after the failure of its attempt to
annex Cyprus, and the situation has not changed since then. There have
been various efforts to mediate by successive UN secretaries general,
all failing.

Sarajevo, Thusday
THE UN commander in Bosnia said today the Bosnian government and their
Serb foes had agreed on how to verify a precarious ceasefire but warned
that fighting in the northwestern Bihac enclave could kill the truce.
Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose said both sides agreed their
officers would travel in United Nations reconnaissance helicopters to
verify a government army withdrawal from a Sarajevo demilitarised zone
and the disengagement of forces elsewhere.
Rose said he expected the measure to be ratified with the signatures
of military commanders of both sides at a session of the ceasefire
commission at Sarajevo airport tomorrow.
Aerial reconnaissance patrols would start immediately afterwards,
weather permitting, concentrating on the disputed demilitarised zone on
Mount Igman outside the Bosnian capital.
Rose said the government had withdrawn virtually all its troops from
the zone, albeit behind schedule. Once completed, supply routes to
Sarajevo shut for months by Serb gunfire should reopen immediately, as
stipulated by the truce accord.
But Rose warned the persistent fighting in the government-held enclave
of Bihac was jeopardising the ceasefire holding across the rest of
Bosnia.
''There's a very grave danger of what's going on in Bihac unravelling
the rest of the cessation of hostilities agreement. We're working
extremely hard to prevent that happening,'' Rose told Reuters.
The general said there was serious fighting near the town of Velika
Kladusa, apparently pitting rebel Muslims and Krajina Serbs from
adjacent Croatia against Bosnian army defenders.
The December 31 ceasefire was not signed by the renegade Muslim
militia faction or the Krajina Serbs. Rose said he was now trying to
forge a separate truce covering Bihac.
UN observers have also reported isolated truce violations in Bihac by
Bosnian Serbs who had jointly attacked the enclave with rebel Muslims
and Krajina Serbs until last weekend.
Inspired by the new truce, diplomats from the international contact
group on Bosnia -- the United States, Russia, Germany, France and
Britain -- met in Bonn to restart talks on a negotiated settlement to
the 33-month war.
The contact group talks were based on an international peace plan
drawn up last July, dividing Bosnia into two almost equal parts and
accepted by all parties to the conflict except for the Bosnian Serbs.
There was no news of the meeting's outcome but diplomats said it was
significant the contact group had not called on the Bosnian Serbs to
accept the July peace plan, indicating a shift in policy to take account
of Serb demands.
The Bosnian Serbs, who back the ceasefire because they believe it will
freeze their war gains in position, said there was a ''great chance for
peace to be restored in Bosnia''.
''Our assessments and signals coming from the United States and other
parties in the contact group indicate that the approach to negotiations
on a cessation of hostilities is now far more balanced and fair,''
Bosnian Serb parliamentary speaker Momcilo Krajisnik told a Serbian
radio station.
In Bosnia, United Nations officials criticised a US Senate move,
introduced by Republican leader Robert Dole, to end an international
arms embargo against the Bosnian government saying it would endanger the
ceasefire.
The officials said the move would encourage the Bosnians to plunge
back into a war they had already lost.
But Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said lifting the embargo
was ''the right thing to do'' and those who wanted the ban to stay were
''appeasing Serbian fascism''.
Despite their support for the truce the Serbs continued to flout its
terms by partially blocking free movement of convoys.
Two UN convoys bound for Bihac were still held up by Croatian Serbs
and renegade Muslims, despite earlier clearances.
UN spokesman Ed Joseph, speaking to Reuters by telephone from the
enclave, said the fuel situation for the Bangladeshi peacekeeping
battalion there was critical.--Reuter.

THE ruins of a Scottish castle are to go on sale, with a possible
bonus of buried treasure for the new owner.
Lordscairnie Castle at Moonzie, near Cupar, Fife, is believed to be
near a huge hoard of loot, pillaged from across Scotland by its owner,
who was known as the ''Tiger Earl''.
The fourth Earl of Craufurd, who built the castle in the sixteenth
century, is believed to have buried his hoard in land surrounding the
castle. However, he left no clue to the treasure's whereabouts.
The selling agent, Mr John Bradburne, said amateur treasure-hunters
have scoured the area with metal detectors but, so far, no trace has
been found of the bounty.
The last residents of the former three-floored tower house moved out
more than 350 years ago. Its last use was as a church in the seventeenth
century.
Mr Bradburne said the castle was ''fairly ruinous and it will need a
lot of work. It is a very dramatic building and could be renovated into
a house.''
Lordscairnie Castle, with the asking price not yet known, is to be
sold along with 29 acres of land, much of it wetlands. The property is
being put up for sale by Mr Jeremy Billinge, who bought Lordscairnie
Farm recently.

PROTESTERS have attacked the Russian Consulate in Edinburgh with
''paint bombs'', leaving several large daubs of red paint on the facade
of the building in the city's Melville Street.
Police said the incident, on Wednesday night which involved the use of
egg shells filled with red paint, was being treated as an act of
vandalism.
Mr Gennady Lazutkin, Consul General, yesterday expressed regret at the
fighting in Chechnya. He said the crisis should be solved in peaceful
ways. The Chechen republic was part of the Russian Federation and it was
an internal matter.
He was aware of the amount of concern expressed in the media in
Scotland and had passed this information to the Russian embassy in
London.
He regretted very much what had happened. He had friends in Chechnya
and a brother who lived near there.
Mr Lazutkin said: ''Frankly, President Yeltsin should have known the
situation completely prior to sending military forces, because it is
awful when our own soldiers are lying along the street.
''I think our president doesn't know the real situation. Maybe he is
not very well informed now.''
He was glad that Mr Yeltsin had halted the bombing of Grozny.
Mr Lazutkin said the consulate had received several telephone calls in
the past week protesting about the fighting.
Mr Oleg Chubar, one of the consuls, said the windows had been
shuttered after the protest phone calls. It was not planned to guard the
building and he did not feel personally threatened.
* The Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Mr Norman Irons, wrote last month to
the Russian ambassador in London saying he was distressed by the events
in Chechnya.

LABOUR'S leading Scottish team put their heads together yesterday to
plan their tactics for the year ahead.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, loftily called it
a ''summit'' for his front-bench team and full-time officials.
He said they were preparing ''to be ready to take power in St Andrew's
House with the policies, vision, and enthusiasm to change Scotland for
the better''.
With the Government unlikely to make St Andrew's House available just
yet for such a summit, Labour chose Chatelherault as a suitable
back-drop. Who knows, perhaps Labour was checking it out as a possible
country residence for any future Scottish premier, or prime minister, or
convener, or whatever the name will be of the leader of a Scottish
parliament which Labour is pledged to set up if returned to power at the
next General Election.
Labour's team believes it can turn the twin attacks on devolution from
the Conservative and Nationalist parties to its advantage. As Mr
Robertson put it yesterday: ''To hear the Nationalists joining forces
with the Tories in attacking Labour policies is a bonus for us. They are
singing the same song, attacking what the Scottish people want.''
He is aware, though, that talk of devolution does not excite the
voters just yet, which was why he was keen to emphasise before
yesterday's meeting that the Tory attacks on devolution were a
deliberate diversion from the Government's own problems. Labour, he
said, would focus on the economy, housing, and education in the months
ahead.
The party would also be preparing for a snap election, which was
always possible, he said, while the Government lurched from crisis to
crisis.
Also joining the MPs at yesterday's meeting were party officials from
Labour's Scottish headquarters. The general secretary of the Scottish
Labour Party, Mr Jack McConnell, said there were three main challenges
ahead -- maximising the number of Labour councillors and Labour
controlled councils at the new local authority elections in April;
building party membership, which grew in Scotland in the last year from
20,500 to 23,500; and keeping the campaigning going, following the Post
Office and VAT successes, by targeting rail privatisation, cuts in local
government funding, and seeking better job creation.
Clearly Labour was happy with its united front yesterday, its high
standing in the opinion polls, and a clear idea of where it is going. It
still has the problem though of its current review of councillors which
is leading to a number of sitting councillors being taken off the
candidates list. If they make a public argument about it, then there
could be some bad publicity ahead for Labour.
Mr McConnell, though, dismissed it as a ''little local difficulty.''
Perhaps he should remember that the first politician to use that phrase
ended up with his Chancellor and entire Treasury team resigning.
The meeting had a positive mood. Mr Robertson believes that Labour has
won significant victories in the past two years. He claimed it had
stopped the privatisation of Scotland's water supplies, a ferry company,
forests, and the Post Office.
It had also halted the second stage of VAT on fuel, he added, and he
expected similar victories in the year ahead, which would confound
critics who had said there was nothing Labour could achieve while the
Government held a majority in Parliament.
Not surprisingly, the SNP was less than impressed with the Labour
victories. Its party vice-president, Mr Andrew Welsh, pointed out that
Scottish water was still going to be controlled by non-elected quangos.
''Quangoisation is not a victory against privatisation,'' he said
yesterday. ''Labour's foolish boast of victory over water is simply a
cover to hide the fact that they were powerless in stopping the
Government's plans.
''Indeed, Labour made it easy for the Government, particularly when
they voted with the Tories in favour of five English Tory MPs sitting on
the very committee which stole Scotland's water.''

INVERNESS MP Sir Russell Johnston has accused British Gas of a
cover-up. He has publicly backed a man who claims he phoned the company
to report a smell of gas at a pensioners' council house the day before
an explosion almost tore it apart. The MP believes the gas company is
covering up for human error.
However, as the Health and Safety Executive began its investigation
yesterday, British Gas continued to deny that any call was received on
Tuesday afternoon about a gas leak at the house of Mr James Ross, 82,
and his wife Margaret, 82, in Bruce Gardens, Inverness.
Their niece's husband, Mr Colin Baillie, depute headmaster at Millburn
Academy, Inverness, is adamant that he phoned British Gas at about 4pm
on Tuesday.
Sir Russell told The Herald: ''I have known Colin Baillie for many
years and he is as straight as a die. If he said he phoned the gas
board, he phoned the gas board. That means that there is some kind of
cover-up within British Gas for somebody's mistake. We want answers and
we want them quickly.''
The row comes a week after British Gas confirmed that it was to cut
drastically the amount spent on checking gas leaks.
British Gas has said that the proposals will not interfere with the
company's 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year safety and emergency back-up
which would always be available.
Mr Baillie said last night: ''I am very angry. I did not imagine
making this telephone call. As normal at New Year we went to visit Mr
and Mrs Ross, who are my wife's uncle and auntie. When we went in we
smelled gas.
''I told Jim and he said that he thought he had smelled it too. I
phoned up the gas board and the first number I got was in Aberdeen. A
lady there said I had got the wrong number and I should try Inverness
direct.
''I looked at the gas board page in the phone book and found the
Inverness number, phoned it, and got a gentleman. He asked for the
address. I wasn't quite sure of the exact address so I shouted through
to Jim and Margaret and they shouted back 109 Bruce Gardens.
''Then he asked the telephone number and inquired where the meter was.
He then said: 'Please turn off all gas appliances, do not have any naked
lights, and we will be there within the hour.'
''We did all that and then we left the Ross home thinking the gas
board would be round. But they didn't come despite the fact that Mr Ross
waited for them all night. The next morning we got a phone call to say
that there had been an explosion in their house.''
He added: ''We gave a statement to the police and I was happy to leave
it at that until I heard that the gas board were saying they hadn't
received a call and had no responsibility. That really made me angry and
I decided to go public.
''I know I made the call. I made it in front of my wife, my
23-year-old daughter, Mr and Mrs Ross and their daughter.''
However, Mr Tom Deans of the British Gas press office in Edinburgh was
insistent. ''I am still issuing the same statement. This man says that
he phoned us but we have no trace of this call. These days all our calls
are electronically logged by BT who can say this call was made at this
time and whether it was answered or not.
''Technologically this is now possible, which is protection for us if
people were saying we weren't answering their calls. We are not just
sitting back. We are beavering away looking for an answer to something
that is quite mystifying. You can rest assured if there has been a
mistake at this end action will be taken.
Mr Deans added: ''Members of the public who think there is a smell of
gas should look up the local telephone book, find the emergency number,
and ring that.
''We don't have many showrooms left and the numbers of those we still
have are not listed because we were worried that people in need of
urgent help might phone up there by mistake and the whole process would
take much longer.
''It is absolutely vital that the public retains complete confidence
in the emergency call-out system. This is the first time for as long as
anyone can remember, 40 or 50 years, that there has been any dispute
about a call being made.
''We receive thousands every year, tens of thousands in the UK, but
this is the first time we have had such a complaint and we are taking it
very seriously and are conducting our own investigation.''
Mr Euan Robson, the Scottish manager of the Gas Consumers' Council,
said: ''British Gas has an excellent safety record and if the emergency
procedure has not worked it will be unprecedented in the last 12 years
that I have been involved with the council. However, it is now my clear
duty to prepare a report on this. Ofgas or the HSE may wish to institute
a formal inquiry.''
Mr and Mrs Ross and their daughter Elizabeth, 38, were taken to
Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, after the explosion but only Mr Ross was
detained. He is not thought to be seriously injured.

SCOTLAND is set to benefit from a windfall of at least #10m from the
National Lottery, it emerged yesterday.
Figures from the National Heritage Department have shown that #96.5m
has been raised nationally for good causes in the first seven weeks of
the lottery's operation.
The arts and sports organisations in Scotland are guaranteed a 10%
share of the cash, while other groups are free to submit claims for
money destined for the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the
Millennium Fund.
A spokesman for the Department of National Heritage said yesterday
that for charities, heritage, and the Millennium Fund, these would be
administered by UK-wide bodies but there would be a requirement on them
to ensure that a ''fair proportion'' was spent in each part of the
country.
The Heritage Minister, Mr Stephen Dorrell, said total sales of
National Lottery tickets had reached #370m, with seven million
prizewinners sharing #166m and 71 people winning more than #100,000,
including 16 jackpot winners.
Camelot, the operators, were installing an average of 1000 new lottery
terminals a month and retail outlets had earned nearly #19m in
commission from selling lottery tickets.
The Government's view is that no-one can dispute the success of the
lottery and that now is the time for organisations to submit proposals
for schemes to be funded by it.
''New swimming pools, refurbished theatres, improved public access to
heritage sites, and better facilities for people with disabilities will
soon be appearing throughout the country, made possible by the National
Lottery,'' Mr Dorrell said.
The Heritage Department said they expected the first announcements
about the allocation of money to come in March or April and, thereafter,
it was planned to make announcements on a quarterly basis.
However, sales of lottery tickets are falling well behind targets set
by organisers Camelot, according to an independent report out yesterday.
Ticket sales will have to more than double if the company is to meet
its forecast agreed with Government regulator Oflot when it was awarded
the contract to run the lottery.
At the moment, ticket sales are languishing at an average #52m a week.
The target set by Camelot is #90m a week.
Mr Clive Vaughan, the report's author, said: ''With all the launch
publicity, the Lottery has not achieved its targets. Sales have a long
way to go.''
Mr Vaughan, an analyst with retail experts Verdict Research, said:
''Camelot won the bid to run the lottery with average yearly sales of
#4.6bn -- or #32bn over the next seven years.
''That is #88m a week, while sales are currently running at about #50m
a week.
''It is early days yet and there are only 10,000 outlets selling
tickets. The aim is to have 40,000 ticket machines eventually.''

home's registration be withdrawn.
While the social work report is confidential, it is understood that
inadequate staffing and catering standards are among the main concerns.
Members of the Community Care sub-committee will consider the report
within the next few weeks.
However, last night, the proprietor, Dr Niqhat Majid, claimed she had
been the victim of social work harassment for the past five years.
She said: ''I came here from London five years ago and they have put
every obstacle in my way. Despite the fact that this is also my home,
they have made their spot checks in the middle of the night and very
early in the morning. I feel someone has been out to get me.
''I would invite people to come to my home and judge for themselves if
the old people are being looked after properly. Ask them if they want to
leave.''
According to Dr Majid, social workers insisted that she appoint a
manager. This condition was met but the lady appointed left after two
weeks. ''She couldn't cope with the social workers,'' Dr Majid said.
Dr Majid also claimed she had appointed additional care staff
following concern, among social workers, that the number of carers was
inadequate.
She said she would take legal advice before deciding whether to appeal
against deregistration.
A Social Work Department spokesperson said the council was dealing
with a formal legal matter and that confidentiality was essential.
It is understood the Social Work Department is investigating a further
five residential homes where care standards have been called into
question.
Last year, two residential homes were closed by Strathclyde Regional
Council following reports of elderly people being maintained in poor
conditions.
Earlier last year, the death of an elderly lady who had been resident
in Glenglova Residential Home, Glasgow, owned by Dr Rada Sarker led to a
fatal accident inquiry. At the close of the inquiry, Sheriff Daniel
Convery condemned the home's regime, stating that elderly people had
been kept like livestock for money.
Last month, the Social Work Department cancelled the registration of
Caldwell House, Uplawmoor, Renfrewshire, owned by Dr Sohair Chaudhry,
following an adverse report by social work inspectors.

A WOODLAND memorial is to be created to honour two Perth doctors who
died in an avalanche while skiing with friends in France last January.
At a commemoration service after their deaths last year, #3000 was
collected in lieu of flowers and a cheque for this amount will be
presented to the Woodland Trust by the couple's children Mark, 19, and
Melissa, 17, in a ceremony on January 11 at Moncreiffe Hill Wood, near
Bridge of Earn.
The money will be used to instal a seat and plaque at a commanding
viewpoint on the wooded hill, which has been owned by the Woodland Trust
since 1988.
Edinburgh solicitor Mr Adam Gillingham, the youngest brother of Dr
Jeremy Gillingham, said: ''The site we have chosen for the seat is
wonderful because it overlooks Perth to one side and you can almost see
the house where Jeremy and Anni lived, and Dundee to the other, which is
where they both met and trained.
''Jeremy and Anni were very well known in the area and this is our way
of thanking everyone who gave a donation.''

PLANS for open-cast coal mining within 200 metres of homes in
Ormiston, East Lothian, are being resisted by residents. They claim the
development would pollute air, poison water, and destroy large areas of
countryside.
A planning application for two mines covering 50 hectares, the size of
125 football pitches, will be lodged soon with East Lothian District
Council by James Fenton and Sons, Perth-based developers.
Fenton's consultants, Taylor Dalgleish Associates, confirmed at a
recent residents' meeting that the mining would involve 20-tonne lorries
moving coal for 10 to 12 hours a day, including Saturdays, via nearby
Tynemount Farm.
Mr Gordon Haig is vice-chairman of the Campaign for the Ormiston
Environment, formed last September to organise opposition.
He said: ''The effect on property values will be disastrous. Rights of
way will be destroyed, the visual effect on the countryside will be
terrible, and there is a general consensus that the dust, noise, and
pollution will not do our health any good at all. We've got to keep
fighting the developers.''
According to the campaigners, support is growing fast. A recent
gathering in Ormiston village hall, which included residents from
neighbouring Tranent and Elphinstone, had people queuing down the street
to voice opposition.
The last application for an open-cast mine in the area -- made by
British Coal for a site at Blindwells, near Tranent -- was granted by
East Lothian District Council 10 years ago.
However, Mr Peter Collins, a council planning officer, said a
successful application this time would have to be referred to the
regional council for a final decision.
Mr Alan Corbett, a director at Taylor Dalgleish, denied the mines
would cause the destruction and pollution feared by campaigners. He is
consulting various bodies, including Scottish Natural Heritage, to
prepare an environmental assessment report, a key part of the planning
application.
''The mine will be operational for only three years and the land will
be restored to its original state in the fourth,'' he said. ''Sometimes
it's possible to restore the land to better quality than it was
before.''
Mr Corbett admitted that some effects of open-cast mining were far
from satisfactory, but said it was the most cost-effective way to
produce coal.

A DIVINITY student who fell asleep on scaffolding 50ft above a busy
street after a party had to be wakened by the fire brigade. Luke
O'Curry, 22, in his final year of a religious studies degree at Stirling
University, and Andrew Thompson, 25, a recent graduate in film and media
studies, had climbed up after a university cheese and wine party,
Stirling Sheriff Court was told yesterday. They were spotted clinging at
attic level to the scaffolding, erected as part of renovation work on
Stirling's King Street.
Thompson came down fairly quickly when told to by police, but O'Curry
did not. Police called the fire brigade, and when they reached the top
of the scaffolding they found O'Curry fast asleep.
O'Curry, of King Street, Stirling, and Thompson, of Byres Road,
Glasgow, admitted causing a breach of the peace on September 23.
Sheriff William Reid ordered O'Curry to pay #150 and Thompson #100
towards the cost of calling out the fire brigade. He told them: ''I'll
help you by admonishing you, but it must be made clear people can't do
this sort of thing and get away scot-free. Anyone with an inkling of
intelligence would see there was going to be alarm caused.''

PRINCESS Alice and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester are to move out
of their country home ''for financial reasons'', it emerged yesterday.
The Gloucesters can no longer afford to maintain a home at historic
Barnwell Manor, near Oundle, Northamptonshire.
From spring, they will live at the Kensington Palace apartment in
London which is provided by the Queen in return for the duke and duchess
carrying out official engagements.
Princess Alice, 93, who is the Queen's aunt, will move to London
within the next three months.
The Gloucesters' private secretary Major Nicholas Barne said there
were no plans to sell Barnwell Manor, which has been in the family and
their principal residence since 1938.
The duke would continue to farm the estate, said Major Barne.
''This is not an overnight decision. It's basically for financial
reasons.
''There has been a general erosion of finances over the years due to
the size of Barnwell Manor and difficult times for farming.''
A statement from Kensington Palace announced that ''as from spring
1995, the sole residence of Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, and
the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will be Kensington Palace.
''Although it is no longer possible for their Royal Highnesses to
maintain two homes, and the future of Barnwell Manor itself is not as
yet decided, the Duke of Gloucester will continue to farm Barnwell Manor
estate as before.
''He and his family, therefore, hope to retain the close links they
have enjoyed for over 50 years with the local community.''
Barnwell Manor stands in the grounds of the ruined Castle of Barnwell
which dates from the thirteenth century. The Elizabethan manor house,
adjoining the castle, was built in 1586.
The manor and 2500-acre estate were purchased in 1938 by Princess
Alice's husband, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, although there were
family links with Barnwell before 1913 when the princess's father, then
Earl of Dalkeith, sold the property.
Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, 50, who is a qualified but
non-practising architect, is a grandson of George V and a first cousin
of the Queen.
In July 1972, he married Danish-born Birgitte Eva van Deurs, whom he
met while studying architecture at Magdalene College, Cambridge.
Six weeks later, their lives changed dramatically when Prince
Richard's elder brother, Prince William of Gloucester, was killed in a
flying accident and Prince Richard unexpectedly became heir to the
dukedom.
He succeeded to the dukedom two years later.

<HEADLINE>Jail key found in island hunt for fugitives</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980500711</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
POLICE and prison security officials were last night investigating how
three dangerous prisoners were able to fashion a key and escape from one
of Britain's most secure jails.
A key found yesterday near a telephone box close to Parkhurst could
open ''certain doors'' inside the Isle of Wight prison, police said.
Detectives said the fugitives, who may still be on the island and
could be armed, must have had help from other inmates to break out on
Tuesday.
Hampshire's Assistant Chief Constable John Wright emphasised there was
no specific evidence that jail staff were involved in collusion, after
earlier remarks were interpreted by prison officers as implying this.
Police were continuing their search for poisoner Matthew Williams, 25,
and murderers Keith Rose, 45, and Andrew Rodger, 44, a Scot, who were
all serving life sentences.
They are thought to have used the replica key to unlock the door to
the gym block where they had hidden.
They then made their way to a tool shed and used a home-made ladder to
scale a wall before cutting their way through the perimeter fence.
The Prison Officers' Association claimed the escape happened after a
week of blunders in which security lapses were reported to the Parkhurst
management -- but nothing was done about them.
Mr Terry McLaren, national executive member of the association, said:
''Four days before the escape our members reported that Williams was
sizing up walls, watching the coming and going of officers, and
generally acting as if he was contemplating to escape.
''Two days before, managers were told that items of uniform were
missing and a key had been compromised -- an alert which meant a
duplicate could be in prisoners' hands.''
Mr Wright said it was very clear that other prisoners helped Rose,
Rodger, and Williams get away.
Earlier, he said it was ''inevitable'' that police would investigate
whether any collusion within the jail involved Parkhurst staff.
That prompted the prison's POA spokesman Neil Mason to complain: ''It
is totally wrong for him to infer that there has been collusion between
prisoners and any member of the prison establishment.''
Mr Wright last night attempted to clarify his remarks by saying: ''I
am not making any assertions whatsoever about the integrity of prison
staff at Parkhurst.''
There was ''no suggestion'', from police inquiries so far, of
collusion by staff.
Two days after the escape, there have been no sightings of the three
criminals.
Armed police are taking part in the hunt on the island and the
mainland. Detectives believe the likelihood is that the men are holed up
somewhere on the island.
With the possibility that someone may be being held hostage by them,
Mr Wright renewed an appeal to people living in isolated areas to check
on their neighbours.

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980500712</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN accountant was executed by hooded gunmen on the orders of an
American fraudster, a court was told yesterday.
David Wilson, 47, was shot twice in the head in his garage by
''hitmen'' while his wife Barbara and daughters Michelle, 28, and Lisa
Marie, 26, were held captive inside his house, it was alleged.
Mr Wilson, 47, died at his luxury country home near Chorley,
Lancashire. His execution had been ordered from across the Atlantic by
39-year-old Mr Michael Austin, said Mr Henry Globe, QC, prosecuting at
Carlisle Crown Court.
Mr Globe said Mr Austin, of Fort Lee, New Jersey, was behind an
international multi-million pound cigarette fraud for which Mr Wilson
was a middle man.
He said Mr Austin planned to get rid of his associate after Mr Wilson
was arrested and questioned by fraud squad detectives about the deal
from which Mr Austin expected to make millions by pretending he had
access to contraband cigarettes.
He added: ''Michael Austin's future success in his continuing
dishonest and fraudulent activities were under threat from David Wilson.
As a result, put quite simply, he had him killed.''
He went on: ''It was he, with others, who made plans to get rid of Mr
Wilson, led to gunmen being employed, and gave directions to seek out Mr
Wilson at his home and execute him.''
Mr Austin, dressed in a blue velvet suit and red tie, pleaded not
guilty to the murder of Mr Wilson at the garage of his home on March 5,
1992.
He also denied conspiring with others to murder between January 1,
1991, and March 6, 1992.
Mr Globe said Mr Austin, whom the defence will admit was involved in a
fraud involving a non-existent shipment of Marlborough cigarettes, was
worried about what trouble Mr Wilson had caused by speaking to
detectives.
Mr Austin was never known by his own name and hid behind a string of
false identities, including that of a fictitious Mexican Army Colonel,
Hector Portillo, the jury was told.
Mr Globe said that at 8.45pm on Thursday, March 5, 1992, when Michelle
Wilson answered a knock on the door at her parents' home ''the terror
which is sometimes portrayed on films or on television became a
reality''.
The masked gunmen asked for Mr Wilson, who was out with his wife, his
other daughter and her fiance Mark Stephenson.
One of them told her: ''Your dad has been speaking to the fraud
squad.''
That was true, said Mr Globe, because Mr Wilson had been involved in
the cigarette deal and was arrested after it went wrong.
Michelle's hands were tied and when the rest of the family returned at
11pm they too were bound.
Mrs Wilson was panicking and asking what it was about. One of the
gunmen told Mr Wilson: ''You know what it's about, don't you?''
Later one of them told Mr Wilson that somebody had paid a lot of money
for them to come to talk to him. They took him to the garage saying they
wanted to talk. Instead, he was shot twice behind the right ear.
''There had been no chat, no talk,'' said Mr Globe. ''That had never
been intended. There had been what you might think was an execution. It
had been planned and executed professionally.
''They were professional assassins paid, and presumably highly paid,
for their work.
''They disappeared into the night as quickly and suddenly as they
arrived and as yet they haven't been found.''
Outlining the alleged cigarette scam, Mr Globe said the sums of money
involved could be compared to ''jackpot prizes in the National
Lottery''.
He said Mr Austin used false names to contact commodity dealers around
the world. He told them he had access to large amounts of Mexican-made
Philip Morris cigarettes which were packaged as if they were the
company's more expensive American-made brand and could be sold at huge
profits.
Buyers were found and false documents were used to get banks to pay
out with letters of credit for the consignments. But there were no
examples of cigarettes ever being delivered, the court was told.
''There is clear evidence the cigarettes that were supposed to exist
did not exist,'' said Mr Globe.
The middle men were convinced they were dealing with contraband
cigarettes. But Mr Austin never had access to the large quantities of
Marlborough and his plan was simply to steal the buyers' money, it was
alleged.
Mr Austin never once used his true identity in the fraud and even his
closest and trusted associates did not know who he was.
He pretended to be Hector Moretta Portillo, working for the United
Nations and related to the former Mexican president Portillo, and would
speak in a Mexican accent.
He used other false names to rent offices near his home and dealt on
the telephone through an answering machine so he could never be traced.
The case continues today.

Blantyre, Thursday
MALAWI'S government will charge former president Kamuzu Banda and his
closest associate, John Tembo, with the 1983 murders of four
politicians, government ministers said today.
The ministers told a news conference the pair would be charged within
48 hours and would likely appear in court within four to six weeks.
Witnesses said news of the charges were followed by the looting by
government supporters of the offices of Malawi's former ruling party.
Malawi Congress Party supporters said backers of President Bakili
Muluzi's United Democratic Front smashed windows, doors and furniture.
They said firefighters did not show up and police arrived late.
Banda, self-proclaimed life president, ruled Malawi for three decades
from independence from Britain in 1964 until he was ousted in its first
multi-party elections in May last year.
The diminutive Banda, believed to be in his mid-90s and senile,
brooked no opposition to his rule, threatening on occasion to feed
opponents to crocodiles. A number of opponents died or suffered long
prison terms.
A commission of inquiry said yesterday police acting on official
orders had killed the four cabinet ministers.
They were apparently killed for opposing Tembo's appointment as acting
president while Banda was abroad during the last decade of his
rule.--Reuter.

Hamburg, Thursday
THE unemployed lathe operator sentenced to probation for stabbing
tennis star Monica Seles during the Hamburg Open is to be retried
because the sentence was too lenient, a state court said today.
Hamburg prosecutors used their right under German law to bring the
case to trial again before a higher court.
Seles, 21, was the world's top-ranked woman tennis player at the time
of the attack in April 1993 but has not competed since.
A local Hamburg court convicted Guenter Parche of causing grievous
bodily injury. He was given two years' probation on grounds of
diminished ability.
Parche said during his trial that he was a fan of Steffi Graf and only
wanted to injure Seles slightly to put her out of action so that Graf
could take the top tennis ranking.--AP.

Constanta, Romania, Thursday
AS many as 54 seamen were missing, feared drowned, today after two
ships sank in a storm at the mouth of Romania's biggest harbour in the
country's worst maritime accident in living memory.
Two bulk carriers, the Maltese-flagged Paris and the Hong Kong-flagged
You Xiu lost power in heavy seas and a blizzard, hitting the Constanta
breakwater around midnight yesterday.
Both sank almost immediately, port officials said.
''All attempts to salvage the vessels and the crews have failed due to
the bad weather . . . I'm afraid there are no survivors,'' Constanta
port captain Marian Popescu told Reuters.
Shipping agents said each ship had a registered crew of 27 but it was
not immediately clear how many people were actually on board at the time
of the sinking.
The agent for the 25,957-tonne Paris said there were 23 Filipinos in
the crew, three Greeks, including the captain, and one Bulgarian. No
details were available for the You Xiu.
State news agency Rompres quoted different authorities in Constanta as
saying there were between 45 and 60 on board the ships.
Rescue authorities said four bodies were discovered several miles down
the Black Sea coast from the port of Constanta. Lifejackets were seen
floating or washed ashore.
Waves as high as 18ft still crashed onto the Constanta waterfront
today and force eight winds hampered efforts to find bodies as night
fell.
The breakwater was itself badly damaged in the accidents, with two
holes -- one of 50 yards, another of 40.
A British-registered tug, the Smith Lloyd, put to sea twice during the
day to try to find bodies. Romanian navy ships also helped in the
search.
Local newspapers said the sinking was the worst disaster to hit the
Black Sea port since 1988 when a Romanian freighter, the Sadu, hit the
same breakwater and sank with the loss of 15 crew.
Doctors at Constanta hospital said they were worried about coping with
the influx of bodies. The independent news agency Mediafax said the
local morgue had space for only 15 bodies. Any others would have to be
buried immediately.
Snow storms and high winds disrupted transport and communications
across the Balkan state today. A barge laden with fertiliser capsized in
Agigea port, south of Constanta, while to the north heavy seas closed
the Sulina channel -- one of three access points to the River Danube.
Bucharest's Otopeni international airport was closed for several hours
today but flights resumed later though fresh snow was still falling in
the city.
City authorities in the capital said they planned to limit hot water
supplies to Bucharest's 2.3 million people because of severe gas and
fuel oil shortages.
More snow and freezing temperatures are forecast for the rest of the
week.--Reuter.

Calcutta, Thursday
IT was only ''a matter of patience and time'' before British voters
would be influenced by the feel-good factor again, Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd said here today.
He told Indian businessmen that it was his infinite regret that the
Government's economic policies had not resulted in any political
popularity. But this would come, he claimed.
Britain had had economic recovery before which made people feel good,
he said. House prices had increased and there had been a lot of spending
in the high street.
''This time we have the kind of economic recovery all the experts told
us we should have,'' he said. ''It is export based, investment led. It
is reflected in greater profits and it is beginning to reduce
unemployment but it is not increasing house prices or causing a great
consumer splurge in the high street.''
He believed the economic recovery posed a worldwide opportunity for
Britain. ''We spend so much time discussing Europe in Britain, partly
because it is important domestically and the shape Europe takes is of
huge importance to ourselves and our children.
''But there is so much discussion on the future of Europe that the
fact we have a role and an interest beyond Europe becomes unclear in the
eyes of our own people.
''In the coming months, I want to draw attention again to the fact
Britain is a power with a world role, not an imperial power, but one
which has interests and assets going way beyond the borders of Europe.''
Earlier, Mr Hurd declared that India's trade was ''booming'' when he
arrived in Calcutta.
Booming or not, he then went to meet some of the city's poorest people
in two municipal slums.
One of them has benefited from British aid but both were dismal and
depressing places. They were also a stark contrast with the twentieth
century splendours of the stadium in which he was to make his speech and
the luxury hotel where he had lunch.
The divide between those who have not and those who have could not
have been more vividly illustrated.
He visited wards 32 and 14 of the Judgeban Bustee. Each of them houses
some 50,000 people.
It was almost like a visit to the zoo as his entourage trooped down
narrow lanes filled with mud and rubbish. It was hard to tell who was
watching who, the visitors or the people who exist there.
The hovels on either side of the narrow roads in the unimproved slum,
which he saw first, were made of mud and wattle and had straw roofs. The
absence of sanitation meant it was a trip of odours and ordure.
But the slum dwellers, who are not Calcutta's poorest people, were
brightly dressed and welcoming. They all seemed to have jobs of a sort
as rickshaw drivers, rag pickers and bottle washers, and the slum has
been here for many years.
These families are not country people who have come to the city
looking for work. They tend to be the people living on the streets who
are probably beyond the help of any aid programme.
The way British aid can help was shown when he visited the adjacent
developed slum. Here roads had been laid and electricity and sanitation
laid on.
As a result, the people who must live there take more pride in their
houses and those Mr Hurd saw were built mainly of brick -- and
everything had a feeling of stability.
He saw schoolchildren, brightly dressed and cheerful, singing songs
and playing educational games, and visited the slum's social centre
which also serves as a clinic providing innoculations and contraceptive
advice to the 8500 families living in this 1.25 square kilometre slum.
At least it all looked better than the other attempt to rehouse slum
dwellers in a block of flats -- which towered above the little houses --
down whose walls raw sewage was streaming from broken pipes.
After his visit, Mr Hurd went to the Victoria memorial, a glorious
marble palace with a massive dome and a cluster of towers built by Lord
Curzon when he was viceroy. There he saw some paintings of old Calcutta
which British artists are restoring with help from the aid programme.
After that, he spoke to the centenary meeting of the Confederation of
Indian Industry.
He told them Calcutta was alive with the buzz of change and renewal
and praised the economic reforms being carried out by the Indian
government which have resulted in greater freedom for private
enterprise.
He warned that only full reform would reap the full rewards. Britain
had been working at its own liberalisation agenda for the last 15 years
and the fight to prevent it foundering on the rocks of inertia, vested
interest and populism had been never-ending.
He also warned that the benefits of reforms could seem to many to be
unevenly and unfairly spread and as the trappings of wealth for the
already better off became more obvious it was reasonable to ask when and
how the poor would feel the difference of the new policies. There were
no easy answers.
He called for reform in four areas which would help British business
to invest in India.
There must be further liberalisation on the import/export regime
because tariffs remained high by international standards.

control over most of the capital Grozny after a day of fierce fighting
with Russian troops, Interfax news agency reported.
Russian government statements said the rebels were fleeing their
capital but Interfax quoted one deputy in Ingushetia, west of Chechnya,
as saying Chechen reinforcements were flooding into Grozny.
Others said Russian planes fired rockets at President Dzhokhar
Dudayev's palace, casting doubt on a pledge by President Boris Yeltsin
to halt air attacks on the city.
''By the evening, Dudayev's supporters gained control of most of
Grozny's districts, with the exception of small pieces of territory,''
deputy Aivars Lezdinsh told Interfax. But he said Russian troops were
getting reinforcements, adding: ''We can expect another attempt to storm
Grozny.''
As Russian troops pressed on with their stalled drive to capture the
Chechen capital, Yeltsin's promise to limit civilian casualties was cast
into doubt by the unconfirmed reports of air raids.
International criticism of Moscow's handling of the crisis in the
Caucasus rose sharply.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl revealed he had telephoned President
Yeltsin before the Russian leader's pledge to stop bombing Grozny. He
said he had told Yeltsin it was necessary to find a way to halt the
bloodshed.
The European Community suspended implementation of a key trade accord
with Moscow. The Kremlin, increasingly sensitive to criticism abroad of
its Chechnya campaign, briefed envoys of the Organisation for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The Russian deputies in Ingushetia, a region to the west of Chechnya,
said the Kremlin's warplanes had dropped bombs on Zavod district, site
of oil storage tanks in fog-covered Grozny.
They said heavy fighting was going on in two districts near one of
Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev's residences and close to the
racecourse. The deputies also said masked men were preventing aid from
reaching Grozny through Ingushetia.
But a Russian government statement issued in Mozdok, the Russian
military headquarters north of Chechnya, said there had been no bombs
dropped on Grozny.
It said Russian planes were ''being widely used outside the Chechen
capital to back up infantry'' and that the main targets of the air
attacks were ''Dudayev strongholds, troops and armour''. Fog was
hampering air activity.
Russia's human rights chief, just back after an extended stay in
Grozny, said Moscow's account of the Chechen campaign was more dishonest
than Nazi propaganda and warned that Russian democracy was in grave
peril.
''As regards the lies, we have surpassed the communists and even (Nazi
propaganda chief Josef) Goebbels,'' Sergei Kovalyov told journalists.
Kovalyov, jailed for his human rights work in the Soviet era, said he
would meet Yeltsin tomorrow during a stay to find the source of the
''gigantic lie''.
The president's influential Security Council was also due to meet
tomorrow to discuss the fighting, Yeltsin's office said.
A correspondent for Britain's Sky television said he heard no bombing
as he left the capital, but a number of bombs fell on the southern
outskirts, the main route for rebel reinforcements.
Fierce fighting was occurring near Freedom Square, close to the
presidential palace, he said. Planes were flying overhead, but at
considerable altitude.
Yeltsin sent troops and tanks to Chechnya on December 11 to end its
attempt to secede from the giant Russian Federation. Warplanes have
bombed Grozny frequently in the last month, killing civilians and
arousing fierce criticism.
Russian government statements have put an optimistic gloss on the
army's progress since Dudayev's rag-tag defenders threw a New Year's Eve
tank-led drive into disarray.
Repeated assertions that Russian troops controlled the centre of
Grozny were disproved by pictures showing rebels in command of Dudayev's
palace and moving through much of the city.
Yeltsin's swing towards conservatives during the crisis was
underscored by the appointment as justice minister of Communist Valentin
Kovalyov, who has supported the Kremlin line throughout the Chechnya
campaign.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
AN Enterprise Trust has admitted unfairly dismissing its finance
director last July and, because of lack of cash, being unable to
reinstate him.
A written judgment issued in Glasgow by an industrial tribunal ordered
Dundee Enterprise Trust to pay #1384 to the former employee.
Mr Douglas Glass, of Lethnot Street, Barnhill, Dundee, was employed by
the trust as its finance director from January 1991 until his dismissal
last year.
The tribunal judgment states: ''The respondents encountered financial
difficulties and found it necessary to make stringent financial cuts.
''It was decided that, to meet these cuts, a reduction of #50,000 was
required in the salary bill.
''Mr David Morrison, who was the then chief executive, chose the
applicant to be made redundant. Mr Morrison subsequently had his own
employment terminated.''
At the time of Mr Glass's redundancy, the only other person who could
have been made redundant was Mr Ronald Flight, who was described as the
''kingpin'' of the organisation who ''enjoyed a very high standing
within the Dundee business community''.
The tribunal heard that this was important to Dundee Enterprise Trust
''who had received bad publicity''.
As Mr Glass had received his statutory redundancy pay, the
compensation of #1384 reflected the trust's failure to follow a fair
procedure over warning of redundancy and consultation.
Mr Glass had sought to be re-instated but the tribunal decided that
was impractical as the trust had no money to pay him.
Last night, Mr Glass said: ''I'm appealing against the amount. I'm a
bit disappointed about the outcome.''

<TEXT>
A 35-year-old man calmly smoked a cigarette after pushing his father
down a flight of stairs and viciously beating him, a court was told
yesterday.
Benjamin Hay had got home the worse for drink at 2am on December 2
last year, stormed into his parent's bedroom, and accused his father
Peter, 65, of treating him badly.
He pushed his father out of the bedroom and down the stairs, before
launching a vicious attack.
Mr Hay suffered a crushed spine, a broken leg, two burst lips, and
bruising to his left eye, Haddington Sheriff Court heard.
When police arrived, the accused was calmly smoking in the living room
as his father lay crumpled at the foot of the stairs.
Now Mr Hay and his wife live in fear of their son returning home, the
court was told.
Hay, of Moat Drive, Edinburgh, admitted the assault at Inchview
Crescent, Wallyford, East Lothian, by punching and kicking his father on
the face and body to his severe injury. He also admitted violently
resisting arrest and being in possession of cannabis.
Depute procurator-fiscal Joan Arnott said Mr Peter Hay had to be taken
to hospital by ambulance. He was in extreme pain from hisback and leg.
During the attack, Mrs Hay fled the house and alerted neighbours.
Mrs Arnott said Mr Hay was now walking with crutches.
Both parents said they lived in fear of their son and were worried
about what would happen when he was released from custody, she said.
Defence solicitor Alistair Mackie said the accused could remember
little of what had happened. His client was full of remorse over the
injuries inflicted on his father.
Mr Mackie said Hay had suffered mood changes following a near fatal
car accident in September last year. He had not been expected to live
and had been in a coma and on a life-support machine for a week.
After leaving hospital, Hay had been given prescribed drugs which to a
degree had affected his senses and mood, said Mr Mackie.
There had also been the stress of still living with his parents at the
age of 35.
Hay's parents now did not want him back in their house.
Sheriff Rose Morrison allowed Hay bail and banned him from entering
the village of Wallyford.
Sentence was deferred until January 30 for reports.

THE prospects of Mining (Scotland) Ltd taking over the mothballed
Frances Colliery in Fife were thrown into doubt yesterday when the
Government said it had received no acceptable offers to buy the colliery
and did not regard its reopening as economically viable.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which has been handling the sale
of British Coal assets during the privatisation process, said yesterday
that the colliery's future was now a matter for British Coal to
determine.
British Coal later refused to say whether it would close the colliery
following the DTI's decision.
The pit is reported to have huge reserves of coal which could employ
up to 1000 people.
British Coal mothballed it 10 years ago and has been operating it on a
care and maintenance basis at a cost believed to be about #1.7m a year.
Mining (Scotland) Ltd, which last week took over the Scottish
coalfield, had requested an option for the colliery for one year and
said after the DTI decision it was considering ''alternative
strategies'' for Frances which it would put to British Coal shortly.
Confirming its decision yesterday, a spokesman for the DTI said: ''No
acceptable offer has been received for the Frances Colliery and Mining
Scotland have been advised accordingly. The future of the Frances
Colliery is now a matter for British Coal.''
He added that DTI technical advisers had concluded that there are ''no
realistic prospects of reopening Frances on an economic basis'' but
declined to say how this conclusion was reached.
A spokesman for British Coal said later that the company would
continue its maintenance of the colliery ''while we consider the next
appropriate steps'' and refused to comment on whether closure was now
more likely.
Maintenance work will include the pumping of flood water to preserve
the fabric of the mine.
Professor Ross Harper, chairman of Mining (Scotland) Ltd, said in a
statement yesterday that he had been informed that the consortium's
proposals were not acceptable to the Government.
He added: ''Mining (Scotland) Ltd is currently considering alternative
strategies for Frances and will be making appropriate representations to
British Coal.''
The DTI decision was condemned last night by the Scottish National
Union of Mineworkers, which said the campaign to ensure that the
colliery does not close should be intensified.
The union's leader, Mr George Bolton, said: ''The pit should be kept
open to allow time for a proper study of the pit and a business plan and
hopefully for the Government to have the pit redeveloped, to create 1000
jobs, and save for Scotland a huge coalfield with valuable coal which
must not be drowned for all time.''
Mr Peter Neilson, vice-president of the Scottish NUM, said at the
union's annual conference last June that the pit had vast reserves of
the highest quality coal, which was suitable for any market.
He added that the colliery was regarded as a vital component in the
long-term planning of the industry.
Mr Richard Leonard, assistant secretary of the Scottish TUC, said last
night that it had argued consistently that a breathing space of about
one year was required after the transfer of ownership of Frances to
allow a detailed assessment of the geological situation and market
implications.
He said: ''If an irreversible decision is taken to turn off the pumps
at Frances, that immediately rules out the possibility of such an
assessment and such a decision would take out the option of developing
coal reserves not only for this generation but for future generations.''
Mr Leonard continued: ''The development of Frances is a long-term
venture that would require at least some state assistance to secure
it.''
He said he suspected there may be some ''haggling'' going on between
Mining (Scotland) Ltd, British Coal, and the DTI in order to force
Mining Scotland to increase its offer for Frances and to pick up the
costs of care and maintenance.

A SHERIFF ordered a medical report yesterday before deciding whether
to jail an 81-year-old man who admitted a charge of sexually abusing a
child.
Wallace Donaldson appeared at Inverness Sheriff Court yesterday and
admitted lewd, indecent, and libidinous behaviour towards a young girl.
The offences happened at Donaldson's house on various occasions
between January 1977 and January 1982.
His victim did not report the matter until years later when, at 17,
she was receiving treatment for depression brought on by the abuse, the
court heard.
Fiscal-depute Sharon Ralph said the young woman was still prone to
lapses of depression.
Mr Peter Gray, QC, for Donaldson, said: ''For a man of 81, there's no
greater fall from grace.
''He is entirely embarrassed by his conduct and more importantly
bitterly ashamed. He cannot and will never be able to provide an
explanation for his conduct.''
He said that Donaldson, of Abban Street, Inverness, had been attracted
to his victim, partly because she looked older than her years and
because he had misinterpreted her behaviour towards him.
Mr Gray added: ''He finds himself almost at the age of 82 having lost
his good character, having lost his wife, who has left him as a result
of these offences, having lost many of his immediate family who want to
have nothing to do with him, and many of his friends.
''Ultimately, he will spent the last years of his life in disgrace as
an isolated man.''
Sheriff William Fulton deferred sentence on Donaldson until January 24
for a medical report to establish whether he could serve a jail term.

THE mother of a family facing eviction from a council house because of
anti-social behaviour has been fined #200 for attempting to defraud the
Department of Social Security.
Mrs Anne Graham, a mother of five, of Alexander Road, Glenrothes, had
denied a charge of obtaining DSS benefit of #88.10 by fraud in November
1993 and was due to stand trial at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court.
However, yesterday, following negotiations between her lawyer Marjorie
Socha and depute-fiscal Rob McAndrew, Mrs Graham pleaded guilty to a
reduced charge that on November 8 at the Department of Social Security,
Victoria Road, Kirkcaldy, she had pretended to an employee that she had
not received a giro-cheque for that amount.
The charge, accepted by the Crown, added that the truth was the cheque
had been received and Mrs Graham had attempted to induce the employee to
issue her with a replacement.
Adding that the original giro had in fact been cashed but he couldn't
say by whom, Mr McAndrew said Mrs Graham's fingerprints were found on
it, prompting the sheriff to comment, ''it passed through her hands . .
. literally''.
Last month, at Kirkcaldy, Sheriff Gail Patrick granted an eviction
order to Glenrothes Development Corporation because of anti-social
behaviour by the Grahams and some of their children.
The couple have appealed against the ruling.

POLICE fear for the safety of a three-year-old girl who gave them
vital information about the murder of her mother, a senior detective
said last night.
Little Hasna Khatun and her 31-year-old father, Syed Norul Ahmed, have
been placed under protection.
Detective Superintendent Ian Lynch said he believed the Bangladeshi
community knew more about the murder of Mrs Amina Khatun and appealed
for more information to find the killers.
Mrs Khatun, a 24-year-old mother of three, was attacked in her home in
Manor View East, Washington, Tyne and Wear, last Friday night while her
husband was at work.
She was the victim of a brutal attack and died from multiple injuries,
including ''extremely horrifying'' stab wounds in her neck.
Hasna, who speaks only Bengali, told police how a girl came into the
house, after which a fight broke out with her mother and then two other
people, at least one of them a girl, joined the visitor.
Hopes that further information could be coaxed out of Hasna in a
second interview faded because she was too upset and Mr Lynch did not
want to cause her more distress.

NEW YEAR arrived with a vengeance for the North Sea oil industry for
the second year running, with a storm knocking out almost $12.5m of oil
production in the last five days.
On January 1, 1994, the North Sea was lashed with some of the
strongest gales in history and, as the onshore celebrations went on in
deep snow in the North-east of Scotland on January 1 this year, North
Sea installations were again pounded with waves up to 75ft high.
The storm damaged the floating storage unit of Chevron's Alba field,
halting production of around 75,000 barrels per day from the Alba
Northern platform. Shell's Brent Alpha platform ceased production of
80,000 barrels per day until this weekend for repairs to a storm-damaged
pipeline on Brent Bravo.
Mr Dave Selway, forecast manager for WNI Oceanroutes (UK) Ltd, said
that much of the northern North Sea was hit by winds of 60 to 70 knots,
gusting to 85 knots. For about five hours on New Year's Day, there was a
''significant wave height'' of 43ft and, as Mr Selway explained, that
was far from the highest waves. The ''significant wave height'' was
calculated from the average of one third of the highest waves.
Scientific computation suggests that with such an average there may have
been waves more than 70ft high.
Mr Selway said the severe conditions were caused by a ''polar low'' --
a disturbance over a relatively small area caused when a polar
disturbance embedded in strong northerly winds.
Mr Selway said he thought it ''nothing more than a quirk of the
natural variation of the day-to-day weather we have in this country''
that two starts to the year in succession should be so bad.
''We had horizontal snow on October 3 and then no more winter until
January 3,'' he said. ''There can be no more variation than that. There
are those who believe in singularities, certain weather on certain days,
like if it rains on St Swithin's Day it will rain for 40 days, but I
think it's nothing more than coincidence.''
Both Shell and Chevron were hoping there would be an absence of polar
lows at least until their repairs are carried out.
Chevron is involved in discussions with the Health and Safety
Executive and Lloyds about the possibility of production restarting from
Alba, with crews on stand-by on the floating storage unit, if required,
to manually carry out some of the automatic safety functions which were
damaged in the storm.
However, a spokesman said that, weather permitting, the repairs should
take only a few days.

AN oil tanker lorry overturned yesterday on the car deck of a P&amp;O
ferry, crushing nine cars.
The tanker, which was carrying lubricating oil, broke free from its
lashings and rolled over as the ferry St Clair travelled from Aberdeen
to Lerwick, Shetland, in fierce weather. No-one was injured in the
incident, which happened between 3am and 4am.
An operation to pump off the oil began after the vessel docked in the
harbour early yesterday morning. The wrecked cars were expected to be
brought off during the afternoon.
The weather on the route was atrocious, with very rough seas and winds
of up to storm Force 10. The St Sunniva, the second P &amp; O ferry which
operates on the route, was delayed by the weather and was due in to
Aberdeen at around 2pm -- six hours late.
A golden retriever called Ben astounded rescuers when he was found
unhurt and covered in oil under the wreckage.
The dog escaped from a car which was all but squashed flat. The car,
belonging to Mr Graham Chappell, a local hotel owner, was towed from the
ferry.
Mr Chappell had given up hope of seeing the dog again but, minutes
later, Ben was found cowering between the wrecks.
The dog had somehow managed to scramble out of the way as the tanker
rolled over right on top of the Toyota Carina.
Mr Chappell, who owns the Westings Hotel, in Gott, said he was
relieved to discover his pet had survived, as he had given up hope after
seeing the state of his car after the ferry had docked in Lerwick.
''They tried to keep me away from it this morning,'' he said. ''I had
to push my way through to the car deck. My car took most of the
impact.''
While he was delighted that his dog had survived, he revealed that
around #10,000 worth of uninsured music studio equipment had also been
in the back of the car.
''It's not a good start to the new year,'' he said. He also criticised
the ferry company for not keeping him informed of what was going on.
Mr Scott Colgate, the marketing director of P &amp; O Scottish Ferries,
said the lorry would have been secured to the ferry with around eight
lashings. While there is unlikely to be a formal investigation, they
will look for weaknesses in the lashings.
''In adverse weather conditions which we encounter during the winter,
it can happen that lashings can break loose,'' he said.
''We are extremely careful and safety conscious. We would have more
lashings than other people. It may be that the vehicle lashings were the
weak point.''
He said the lorry's tank did not rupture so there was only a ''very
minor'' spillage of lubricating oil, which is non hazardous and
non-combustible. There was 25,000 litres of luboil in the lorry.
Mr Colgate added that the shipping forecast before they left Aberdeen
had been for winds of Force Six to Force Eight, occasionally Force Nine.
''There was nothing in the shipping forecast to say the sailing should
have been cancelled,'' he said.
The cost of the damage to the nine cars will now be a matter for the
insurance companies of the owners and P &amp; O.
Another passenger whose car was badly damaged, Mr Ian Gourlay, a bank
manager, said he had been told as soon as the ferry left Aberdeen that
they would be making full speed to Lerwick because of the weather.
''It was bad but I have seen it almost as bad if not worse,'' he said.
''Then this almighty clatter occurred at around 3.20am when obviously
the tanker turned over.''
He said the sight of the car deck next morning was ''pretty
horrendous''.
''Through the car deck window, we could see the tanker on its side and
the squashed vehicles underneath.''
He said he was concerned that such an incident could happen, even
though the tanker had appeared to be well shackled down. ''It would
appear the chains just couldn't hold it in the storm,'' he added.
The ferry company was attacked for failing in its ''moral duty'' to
help the owners of the cars crushed under the tanker.
One irate passenger, Mr Alistair Easten, from Lerwick, whose
four-month-old Astra was destroyed, said that he was ''furious'' at the
attitude of P &amp; O, who do not see the damage as their repsonsibilty.

AN anonymous North American donor has given $1m to Aberdeen
University's quincentenary appeal, taking it to almost half its target
of #25m.
Mr Bernie McDermott, the quincentenary director, said the #640,000
donation was strictly confidential. He would give no details about the
donor or any connection with the university or city.
The donation will go towards the university's Institute of Medical
Science at Foresterhill.
A number of other significant donations are being discussed.
The appeal fund will be used to establish a centre for the history and
culture of the North and North-east, to widen the access to higher
education, to create an oil and gas institute, a centre of environmental
law and policy to address environmental legislation, and a natural
history education centre to develop the zoology museum.
The celebrations will start on February 10 with a founder's day
service and honorary graduation ceremony. Mr McDermott said no details
were being released about who would receive honorary degrees but among
those to be honoured during the year is the Prince of Wales, who will
follow in the footsteps of the Queen Mother, the university's patron,
and Queen Mary.
Other recipients will be the Sultan of Brunei, Princess Maha Chakri
Sirindhorn of Thailand, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, general secretary of
the United Nations, writer Dame Muriel Spark, and opera singer Jessye
Norman.
On February 11, the university will receive the freedom of Aberdeen.

FORMER Dundee FC chairman Angus Cook was fined #75, with 14 days to
pay, at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday after his firm's accounts were
not lodged in time at Companies House.
Mr Cook, Hill Road, Broughty Ferry, had earlier pleaded guilty by
letter to an offence under the Companies Act.
He admitted that annual accounts, a director's report and, an
auditor's report for Liveintac Ltd, Nethergate, Dundee, for the
financial year to May 31, 1993, were not lodged at Companies House in
Edinburgh by March 31, 1994, the last date allowed.
Depute-fiscal David Dickson told Sheriff John Young that the accounts
had now been submitted.
Mr Cook did not appear in person but his solicitor Mr Michael Robson
said Liveintac was a parent company and that accounts for 10 subsidiary
companies had all been lodged on time.

EIGHT of John Major's former Ministers have accumulated a total of
nearly 40 paid directorships and consultancies since leaving or being
forced out of office. In some cases these involve companies that hope to
win Government contracts or aid for export deals.
These latest examples of the apparent continuation of the ''sleaze
factor'' dogging the Conservatives are highlighted in a new analysis of
the Register of MPs' Interests carried out by Labour Research.
It also shows that four out of five Conservative back-bench MPs have a
paid directorship outside Parliament -- contrary to the declared wishes
of the Prime Minister.
The register, as at November 21, showed that 200 out of the 243 (82%)
back-bench Tory MPs held a total of 276 paid company directorships and
356 paid consultancies. Just 38 out of 281 (14%) of Labour MPs and 10 of
the 23 (43%) Liberal Democrat MPs had a paid directorship or
consultancy.
According to Labour Research, the busiest of the ex-Ministers and the
MP with the highest number of paid jobs outside parliament is Mr David
Mellor, the former Heritage Secretary. The Putney MP has built up a
portfolio of 12 paid consultancies since resigning as a Minister in
September 1992.
Four are with defence manufacturers -- Racal Tacticom, Short Bros,
Vosper Thornycroft, and British Aerospace -- that may be involved in
Government contracts or sales overseas that require some state aid.
Another is with accountants and management consultants Ernst and Young.
Mr Nigel Forman, Tory MP for Carshalton and Wallington, resigned as
Junior Education Minister in December 1992 and now has three paid
consultancies.
Mr John Major's reshuffle of May 1993 saw six Ministers fired or stood
down, the most notable being the former Chancellor Norman Lamont, who
went on to become a director of the merchant banker NM Rothschild which
advised the Government in several privatisations. He is also chairman of
the Taiwan Investment Trust and a director of the First Philippine
Investment Trust.
Since Sir Archie Hamilton, the MP for Epsom and Ewall, resigned as
Armed Forces Minister he has acquired seven directorships, including
security firm Saladin Holdings and four consultancies, including US
defence manufacturer Litton Industries.
The MP for Gainsborough and Horncastle, Mr Edward Leigh, a former
Junior Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, has become a
director of US cable company National Telecable, while Watford MP
Tristan Garel-Jones has become an adviser to British Gas, Union Bank of
Switzerland, and Biwater International, since standing down as a Junior
Minister at the Foreign Office.
The former Social Security Minister Nicholas Scott has become a
consultant to Clark and Smith Industries, whose activities include
products for the disabled.
The South Norfolk MP and former Transport Secretary John MacGregor has
re-joined the board of merchant bankers Hill Samuel, which has been
advising the Government on the Chunnel rail link and various
privatisations.

BRITISH Transport Police are again investigating an incident in which
a piece of concrete, big enough to derail a train, was placed on a
stretch of railway on the outskirts of Glasgow.
The incident, which police say could have had tragic consequences,
follows the deaths of a train driver and a passenger last year when a
train was de-railed in Greenock after concrete slabs were placed on the
line.
A slab of concrete was discovered on the north electric commuter
railway line near to Westerton station in the early hours of yesterday.
Police immediately informed Railtrack Scotland, which is responsible
for safety and vandalism on the railway network, to ensure that any
trains scheduled to travel through Westerton station at the time were
halted.
Railtrack Scotland said yesterday that the last passenger train to
pass through the affected area was from Springburn to Milngavie, which
went through Westerton at 11.36pm on Wednesday.
Police officers attended the scene near Maxwell Avenue in Westerton
immediately after being alerted and removed the piece of concrete from
the line. There was no evidence of it having been struck by a train.
No other trains were due to use the area around the time of the
incident. The first to do so after the concrete was removed was a
freight train travelling from Fort William to Blyth in Northumberland,
which passed through Westerton at about 4am.
It was instructed to travel along the affected railway at a reduced
speed as a precautionary measure in case there was any damage to the
track.
Appealing for witnesses, or anyone with information, to contact the
British Transport police, Detective Sergeant Alex McGuire said yesterday
that ''mindless vandals'' were responsible.
''The piece of concrete was quite capable of de-railing a train and
that can be very serious, as we saw at Greenock last year.
A spokeswoman for Railtrack Scotland said that the vandalism was
particularly ''abhorant'' in the light of the Greenock crash.
Two 17-year-old youths were last month sentenced to 15 years in jail
for derailing a train and killing the driver and a passenger after they
were found guilty of culpable homicide by placing concrete slabs on a
railway line in Greenock on June 25 last year.
The Greenock case led to a greater public awareness of the dangers of
rail vandalism.

A YOUNG girl has died in hospital in Inverness from a meningitis type
condition.
The youngster was being treated in the intensive care unit at Raigmore
Hospital for the condition known as meningococcal septicaemia, a form of
blood poisoning from the same germ which causes meningitis.
Details of the girl, who came from the Grampian area, have not been
revealed at the parents' request.
The condition is rare: only one or two cases are reported in the
Highlands each year. Highland public health consultant, Dr John Bisset,
said the illness causes fever, shock, and bleeding.
''It is a very, very severe illness,'' he said. ''It has similar
symptoms to meningitis but spreads throughout the body and is not
confined to the brain.''
Dr Bisset said Highland Health Board would not be treating anyone in
the locality with antibiotics as a precaution to prevent the spread of
the condition.
Dr John Curnow, consultant in communicable diseases and environmental
health with Grampian Health Board, said a statutory preventative plan
was activated on January 2 when the case was first reported.
''All very close contacts have been offered the appropriate
antibiotics. This is not a very infectious disease and casual contacts
are not at risk.''
It is understood the girl lived in a rural area.
Meanwhile, it emerged that a 19-month-old boy died of meningitis hours
after being taken into intensive care for emergency treatment. Ryan Blow
died at Southampton General Hospital on January 1.
The news follows the deaths of five-year-old Sussex schoolgirls Emma
Harris and Alexandra Yates. Both had contracted the type C strain of
meningococcal meningitis.

A WARD with almost 30 patients at Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway
has been closed off in a bid to halt the spread of a virus.
Hospital authorities confirmed the isolation of Heaval Ward last night
and said the move was an attempt to contain a viral infection.
It follows the isolation of two elderly patients at Lochmaddy Hospital
last week, one of whom has since died.
Although the potentially fatal E coli 0157 bug was found in Lochmaddy
Hospital after tests, the death was said to be unrelated.
It is understood that eight of the patients in Heaval Ward, a
sub-acute medical ward, are suffering from severe diarrhoea.
However, Mr Brian Liddle, the health unit general manager, said:
''This is a viral infection and not as a result of the E coli bacteria
that caused the isolation of patients at Lochmaddy Hospital last week.''
Mr Liddle said the virus affects most patients for about 24 hours. It
was noticed on Tuesday and access to the ward has been restricted since
then.
The ward is to remain shut to visitors.

THE electronics company Motorola yesterday announced that it has
bought the South Queensferry plant owned by electronics rival, Digital
Equipment Corporation, safeguarding almost 600 highly-skilled jobs.
Motorola already employs 2300 people at East Kilbride and 2000 at
Easter Inch, near Bathgate, and will now take over Digital's workforce
on similar terms and conditions.
The acquisition, which will be completed this summer, will bring
Motorola's Scottish workforce to almost 5000, making it one of
Scotland's largest employers. At first around 40 new jobs are likely to
be created at South Queensferry, with more to come.
Motorola said it planned to establish a ''worldwide centre for
excellence'' at South Queensferry for the production of computer
''chips'' for cellular telephones, pagers, hard disk drives, cordless
telephones, and advanced multi-media applications. Production will be
concentrated on advanced semiconductors for cell phones.
Under the terms of the agreement -- the financial details of which
were not disclosed -- Motorola will continue to manufacture existing
Digital product lines, including the Alpha Chip, and AMD's Am486
microprocessor, under contract.
Mr Tony Joyce, Motorola's director of external affairs, said the
acquisition had been made to allow the company to get ahead of demand.
Last year, Motorola announced a #250m expansion at East Kilbride, but
this latest announcement will not affect that. Investment in 1992/93 by
Motorola was #40m and in 1993/94, #50m.
A spokesman for the company added: ''This acquisition represents
another major development in the company's commitment to manufacture in
Scotland and the growth will continue with plans in hand to make
significant additional investment at the South Queensferry site.''
Mr Andrew Spyvey, Digital's UK public relations manager, added that
the deal would bring in cash for Digital and it would help the company
return to profitability in the coming financial year.
While, on the face of it, the agreement appears to be between two
competitors, in fact Digital uses some of Motorola's microchips in its
own products.
Digital's major Scottish plants for manufacturing personal computers
for the European market are in Ayr, where 1700 people are employed, and
Irvine, where 450 are employed.

TIPPLERS throughout Scotland have already dubbed it the Euro-dram --
the measure on the orders of Brussels bureaucrats which means no-one can
really ask for a ''wee hauf'' in future.
As of January 1, licensees must sell drinks in metric quantity, which
means the traditional quarter gill has disappeared, along with measures
of spirits in 1/6 and 1/5.
The new metric measures replacing them across the range of spirits on
pub and club gantries must now be dispensed in quantities of 25ml or
35ml.
Publicans, along with the Scotch Whisky Association, are not too
worried about the changes, it emerged yesterday, with the association
claiming success in the introduction of the 35ml measure, which is
fractionally less than the original 1/4 gill.
A spokesman for the association in Edinburgh said: ''That measure is
virtually the same, while the 25ml measure falls between the measures of
1/6 and 1/5.''
However, Euro-sceptic Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, Conservative MP for
Perth and Kinross, was last night said to be ''furious'' about the new
regulations.
Sleeping off jet lag after returning from Pakistan several days ago,
his wife Samantha said at their home, Fordell Castle, near Dunfermline:
''Take it from me he is furious -- he has complained before about this
being an infringement of a Scotsman's right.
''Mind you, he was grumbling about not being able to get a drink in
Pakistan.''
Wine drinkers also face changes. Wine now sold by the glass must be
sold in quantities of 125ml or 175ml.
Beer and cider measures remain unchanged.

Cities from all over the globe, including Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon,
Washington, Beijing, and Seoul, will consider the future prospects for
very large urban areas in the context of environmentally friendly, safe,
and comfortable living conditions.
The World City Exposition will be held from March 24 to October 13,
1996, and will present Glasgow with a tremendous opportunity to make an
impact on a global scale.
Each city will mount an exhibition within the World City Pavilion.
Glasgow's costs of #215,000 will cover a long-term exhibition, a
specific Glasgow day, including a satellite link between Tokyo and
Glasgow, and promotional material.
Glasgow's Labour leader, Councillor Patrick Lally, said: ''I think the
invitation largely arises from the reputation that the city has
established over recent years and a recognition that we're an important
international city.''

HOME Secretary Michael Howard and the prisons director, Mr Derek
Lewis, are to be questioned by a powerful committee of MPs over the
crisis in the prison service.
The future of both men is in the balance after recent events. Both
have faced calls for their resignation.
Later this month, they will appear before MPs on the influentual Home
Affairs Select Committee who will want to satisfy themselves about the
clarity of chains of command in the service after the series of recent
events, including the escape of three dangerous inmates from Parkhurst
prison on the Isle of Wight.
They will also want to question the two men about the rioting at
Everthorpe prison on Humberside and other perceived blunders, like the
death of Frederick West, who faced 12 murder charges, at Winson Green
prison.
As the political row over the state of the service continued
yesterday, Prisons Minister Michael Forsyth called for an end to the
''witch hunt'' against senior figures and condemned constant resignation
calls.
Mr Forsyth said he was extremely confident in Mr Lewis, praising his
''very remarkable'' achievements in cutting escapes and reducing costs.
Mr Forsyth said there had been very serious lapses and if people were
at fault they must be held to account. However, he went on: ''We simply
cannot deal with everything that goes wrong in the prison service by
calling for the resignation of the director general or the Home
Secretary. It is not a very mature way in which to address real,
difficult problems.''
This line was challenged, however, by Lady Olga Maitland, who became
the first Tory back bencher to call for Mr Lewis's head, claiming he had
''failed, failed, and failed again''.
She said: ''The time has come when we have seen that he personally is
not up to the job. Mr Howard should ask very seriously whether this is
the right man to continue in the job. We really have had enough.''
The Opposition parties kept up the attack on Mr Howard amid
speculation that he would be shifted from his post in the next Cabinet
reshuffle but Tory MPs seemed anxious to await the outcome of the
committee's inquiry before reaching any judgment on the future of either
Mr Howard or Mr Lewis.
Sir Ivan Lawrence, chairman of the committee, said: ''There must be a
full and thorough inquiry. When we know the facts then the conclusion
can follow from that.''
Mr John Greenway, a Tory member of the committee, said Mr Howard's
resignation would solve nothing and he should be given the chance to
pursue his policy of toughening the prison regime.
He said of Mr Lewis that his position must be difficult but he
insisted it would be quite wrong to judge him ahead of his appearance
before the committee and in advance of the inquiries set in train by the
Government.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw condemned attempts to blame Mr Lewis
alone. ''We are now seeing an effort by some of Mr Howard's friends to
pass the buck to Mr Lewis to make him a scapegoat for the problems now
overwhelming the prison service,'' he told BBC TV. ''It is the Home
Secretary, responsible to Parliament, who must carry the can for the
crisis.''
Mr Straw last night wrote to Mr Howard demanding a fully independent
inquiry into the escape at Parkhurst.
For the Liberal Democrats, home affairs spokesman Alan Beith said:
''If Mr Howard's policy is to leave the prison service in a demoralised
and unaccountable mess, which he certainly has succeeded in doing, then
it is time he was replaced by someone prepared to get a grip on the
situation and put the system under effective control.''

GRAEME Obree, Scotland's world record-breaking cyclist, was furious
yesterday when he learned that he had been fired by his French
employers, just five days into a two-year contract.
The former world pursuit champion and one-hour record holder was
unable to report for training in the Alps but had sent a medical
certificate.
He was incensed when contacted by The Herald. ''Does this mean I have
been fired?'' he asked. He was particularly distressed to hear that his
former employers accuse him of lacking ''loyalty and enthusiasm''.
The Irvine-based rider was contracted to ride for Le Groupement, a
team backed by a mail order company which also has fellow-Scot Robert
Millar on its books. It had been hoped the pair would be partners in
this year's Tour de France.
Obree confirmed, however, that he will be out of action for around
three months, recuperating from an unspecified illness.
''I was to have reported to the team training camp on New Year's
Day,'' said Obree yesterday. ''But I find it very distasteful to be
labelled unprofessional and unenthusiastic.
''I have been suffering from raging headaches and have a medical
certificate from a consultant whom I am attending. I tried to tell the
team on January 1 about the problem but could not make contact. I tried
Le Groupement's office, the team, and my agent, Frank Quinn, in Dublin.
Nobody was available.
''When I got through to the team hotel, the next day, I explained my
situation. The only English speaker, public relations officer Thomas
Reveillon, said: 'It's okay. There is a letter in the post from the
squad director, Patricke Valke. Goodbye.'
''I did not know what to expect. The letter has not arrived yet and
you are the first person to confirm I have been sacked.''
Guy Mollet, Le Groupement team manager, said: ''Obree didn't even call
us to explain why he didn't turn up. His attitude is all wrong and
unforgiveable.''
Obree insists, however, that he did contact the team at their hotel.
''I do not wish to go into details,'' he said. ''Suffice to say I have a
doctor's line. A normal working person would be up in arms at such a
sacking. If you were given your jotters a day after calling in sick,
would you not be furious?''
Obree, voted Scotland's Sports Personality of 1993, insists there is
much more to his dismissal than a breach of team protocol: ''I was
signed by Le Groupement as contender to regain my world one-hour record,
which had been captured by Tour de France winner Miguel Indurain,'' said
Obree. ''But, subsequently, Tony Rominger added almost two kilometres to
Indurain's mark, taking it to 55.25k.''
The one-hour record is the blue riband of cycling, and Rominger's
performance was akin to knocking around eight seconds from the world
athletics record for the mile. It strained credulity and brought
allegations of drug use in the French media.
''Le Groupement had given me time off, in my contract, to attack the
hour record. But since Rominger has ridden such an unnatural time,
they've gone cool. They think nobody can beat it and that getting rid of
me will save them money.
''I think that Rominger's distance is just beatable, legally -- though
his own doctor says the limits of a cyclist's ability are the limits of
doping controls.''
Agent Quinn hinted, perhaps at the source of Obree's illness. ''Graeme
has been under a lot of pressure lately,'' he said. ''His brother's
death in an accident last year was a morale-shattering blow and he
hasn't been feeling all that well . . . but if he felt this way, he
should have said so in December.
''It's madness. He has lost a good salary for two years and a big
opportunity with a good team.''
Obree insists, however, that his dismissal is not a disaster. ''It's
not as if I was on #100,000 a year,'' he said. ''A normal working person
could have made as much in one year as I was on from Le Groupement. I
have other options. I'll be back, and I'll be fine. Don't worry about
that.''

THE Duchess of York has been denounced as ''a vulgarian . . . vulgar,
vulgar, vulgar'', in an interview given by Lord Charteris, the Queen's
former private secretary.
He is also quoted in an interview in The Spectator magazine published
yesterday, as saying that Camilla Parker Bowles is ''of course'' the
love of the Prince of Wales's life.
However, Lord Charteris yesterday protested that he had believed his
thoughts would not be reported. ''Those remarks were private,'' he told
an ITN crew outside his Gloucestershire home.
''I gave an interview on the basis that it was going to be a profile
of myself.
''I made it quite clear I was not prepared to talk about the royal
family.''
When asked whether he denied making the remarks, he said: ''I am not
saying that at all. I am saying that if I did, I said them off the
record, and I don't want to discuss it.''
In the article, Lord Charteris also says the Queen is enough of a
realist to know that ''there is nothing for it'' but to sit out these
troubled times, believing that the Monarchy is strong enough to
withstand change and analysis.
He believes, too, that a Charles-Diana divorce would ''clear the air
-- and yes, of course he will be King''.
As for the Queen Mother, Lord Charteris is quoted as describing her as
''a bit of an ostrich -- she has learned how to protect herself. What
she doesn't want to see, she doesn't look at''.
The interviewer, Noreen Taylor, writes: ''During last year's TV
documentary series, The Windsors, Lord Charteris described the Princess
of Wales as someone who doesn't know how to behave in front of servants
and finds conversations with dinner guests difficult.
''He added that the Duchess of York was basically unsuited to the task
of being a princess. Did that outspokenness not earn him a royal slap on
the wrist?'' she asked.
She quotes Lord Charteris: ''Not at all. There was no royal criticism
for saying what I did. Anyway, I was only saying what everyone else
thought.
''Quite simply, the Duchess of York is a vulgarian. She is vulgar,
vulgar, vulgar and that is that.''
On the question of Prince Charles's marriage, Lord Charteris said:
''The Queen Mother is aware that, in her lifetime, the Prince and
Princess of Wales are going to divorce. She is quite prepared for it
and, yes, she can and will withstand the shock.
''You don't reach 94 without surviving a number of shocks and Her
Majesty is built of stern stuff. Probably because she is a bit of an
ostrich, she has learned how to protect herself.
''What she doesn't want to see, she doesn't look at. You ought to know
that she is adorable but quite tough and resourceful, too.''
The interviewer writes: ''There are those who believe that if he (Lord
Charteris) had been private secretary during the Prince of Wales's
courtship of Lady Diana Spencer, there would have been no marriage.''
Then she quotes Lord Charteris as saying: ''The pity is that the
Prince of Wales had to marry a virgin. Divorce will clear the air. And,
yes of course he will be King.
''There is nothing in the constitution to say the monarch must be
happily married. When the dear, sweet Queen dies, although I wish she
could go on for ever, a council of succession will appoint Charles as
head of state.
''Now, if you want to cast doubt on that certainty, then you are
talking revolution, referendum, change of constitution, and that is an
entirely different matter, one I would not care to speculate on.''
Lord Charteris then asked: ''Have you met him? Oh, too bad, women
adore him, such a charming man when he isn't being whiny, which he can
be rather.
''I know Charles, know the man, and believe he will be a good King, a
King for his time.''
Questioned about Camilla Parker Bowles, he said: ''The lady has a
husband. The lady in question happens to be married. I hope that answers
the question.
''Of course she is the love of his life and there is no denying that
now, since he has made a clean breast of it himself.''
''This isn't the first time the monarchy has gone through troubled
times. And the Queen is enough of a realist, far more than you would
imagine, to know there is nothing for it but to sit it out.
''She believes the monarchy is strong enough to withstand change and
analysis.''
He went on: ''Lampooning, ridiculing, it has all been done before.
They know about these phases. They remember the abdication and how
afterwards the monarchy was revived by George and Elizabeth and adored
as a beloved family.
''The Queen is aware that they have gone through difficulties before
and survived, and so they will do again.
''If the Prince and Princess of Wales had had a successful marriage,
there would not be a problem, nor would we be having this discussion.''
He said that he believed the Prince of Wales's confession of
infidelity would fade in time. ''People will forgive,'' he added.
''There is an awful lot to be said for honesty.''
The Duchess of York last night shrugged off the remarks by Lord
Charteris.
When told about the comments as she was skiing with her two daughters
at Klosters, Switzerland, she said: ''He has said this sort of thing
before.'' With an air of resignation, she added: ''Everybody's entitled
to their own opinion.''
Commander Richard Aylard, the Prince of Wales's private secretary,
said he did not wish to comment directly on what Lord Charteris had
said.
A spokesman for the Prince, when asked about Lord Charteris's comments
on the possible divorce of Charles and Diana, emphasised that the royal
couple had no plans at present for divorce.

The past is often a place of impenetrable mystery, but Marguerite McClure has
the case sewn up.
JEAN Bell sewed this sampler, in 1819, at the age of nine or 10. It lay rolled
up in the family deed-box until I became curious. Who was Jean Bell, and where
did she live when she sewed the sampler? My hobby is studying family history
and while searching through the old parish records of the Barony Church of
Scotland, Glasgow, I discovered Jean Bell married my great-great-grandfather,
Robert McClure, in 1827. At that time they lived in Carntyne and Robert's
occupation was recorded as ``domestic servant''.
There was further reference to them in the Barony Church Session Records.
Twelve days after their son was born in 1828, Robert was called before the
court and accused of ante-nuptial fornication. However, since they were already
married, he was acquitted.
I now turned my attention to the sampler. There are three methods of finding
the origin of a sampler; some have the name of the school or town embroidered
on them, and in other examples the child's place of birth is known. It was back
to the old parish records.
Studies of Glasgow, then the whole of Scotland, proved fruitless and I assumed
Jean's parents had not registered her birth. Then came the breakthrough. Two
members of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Family History Society had just
completed feeding the 1851 Census for Glasgow into a computer which made a
search, and Jean, Robert and four sons were revealed. Jean's birthplace was
Renton, Dunbartonshire.
Jean's family must have worked in the calico printing and bleaching industry in
Renton. Most of the workers came from the Highlands and her parents could have
been among the first inhabitants of the village when it was founded in 1782.
Miss Tarrant, curator of costumes and samplers at the Royal Scottish Museum in
Edinburgh, told me the intensive work involved in the sampler indicated Jean
had attended full-time schooling; it was not embroidered at a Sunday School.
It is likely there was a church or private school in Renton at this time. By
1839, the Second Statistical Account for Scotland mentions five schools in the
Parish of Cardross, which included Renton.
Levenside Church was the sole church in Renton in 1819. It was built in 1760
and was Secession. Most of the poorer people and artisans attended. Ministers
in the these churches, as an act of civil disobedience, did not record births,
marriages and deaths. This would explain the lack of Jean's Notification of
Birth.
In 1819 there was much industrial unrest resulting in the Peterloo Massacre in
Manchester and serious outbreaks of violence in the west of Scotland. Seven
years previously the Comet, the world's first steamboat, had been launched on
the Clyde and the steamers were giving new vigour to the poorer peoples' lives.
It was the penultimate year of George III's reign and just four years after the
Battle of Waterloo.
Jean's sampler is, in fact, a genealogical record of her family. The Scots
sampler is unique in that usually the mother's maiden name is recorded.
Therefore, possibly Christian Walke was Jean's mother. The two rows of black
initials on the left side stand for deceased relatives. The symbolic birds and
sheep are thought to be derived from heraldry. The basket of fruit on the right
side  comes from Greek mythology. Fir-tree topiary was very fashionable at that
time and entered patterns frequently.
A variety of stitches are used, including French knots, stem stitch, cross
stitch and eyelet stitch. Because the sampler has been protected from light,
its colours have not faded. The threads used are, red, green, pale blue, black
and white.
Experts say that for the first 25 years of overlapping this century, patterns
do not change. This means that Jean's sampler is similar to the eighteenth
century patterns.
