Edinburgh's international conference centre is still being built but
already there are fears that exhibition space is too small for the
modern market. The district policy and resources committee heard
yesterday that the conference centre company and local enterprise board
are looking at a nearby site with a view to increasing exhibition space.

<HEADLINE>Banham resigns in row over counties reform</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979583120</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SIR John Banham, who was charged with overseeing the reform of local
government in England, resigned last night as the Government announced a
rethink of a raft of his proposals.
The former CBI chief said he recognised the Commission had not done
the Government's or Labour's ''bidding'' -- but insisted his team's
achievements eventually would speak for themselves.
Labour welcomed his resignation, but attacked the Government for not
giving clearer guidelines for the redrawing of the map of England.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson said Sir John's conduct of
affairs had been ''quite deplorable''.
He told the Commons: ''They should have been beyond reproach. Instead,
they were beyond belief.''
To MPs' laughter, Mr Gummer said he was most grateful to Sir John --
whose contract did not expire until next year -- for having offered his
resignation.
He went on to announce fresh reviews under a new chairman whose name
would be announced soon.
''I believe these new reviews must be carried out by a reconstituted
Commission which can look at the cases afresh,'' Mr Gummer said.
However, Mr Dobson said Mr Gummer's statement acknowledged that the
review of local government had ''sunk into a morass of contradiction,
inconsistency, expense and litigation, which could have been avoided if
the Government had appointed someone better able to do the job''.
Liberal Democrat local government spokesman David Rendel said Mr
Gummer was ''moving the goalposts and sacking the manager'' in an
attempt to impose Tory policy on local people in England.
''As a result, many of the 17 counties which had expected to remain as
they are have now been thrown back into the melting pot.''
Sir John's Commission was given the job of sweeping away much of the
two-tier structure of shire local government, where counties delivered
some vital services and districts others.
Ministers believed this set-up often wasted taxpayers' money, and
resulted in confusion -- with the public unaware of who to approach
about which service.
In Scotland -- as in Wales -- the Government imposed new all-purpose
councils, but in England, under Sir John's Commission, much of the map
remained unchanged, with unitary councils in a minority.
Mr Gummer, announcing his response to Commission proposals on 20
counties, rejected a recommendation that Buckinghamshire, the only
Tory-controlled county council, should be abolished.
He also disclosed -- to Labour jeers -- that he was considering moves
which could bring back the ancient county Huntingdonshire, which
includes the Prime Minister's constituency.

FANS' complaints at not being able to support their teams away from
home have led to new rules ordering Premiership clubs to give more
tickets to visiting supporters next season.
The new policy, proposed at a meeting of Premier League clubs by
Blackburn and seconded by Arsenal, was passed despite fierce opposition
led by Manchester United and Newcastle.
Under the new regulations, all Premiership clubs must give over 10% of
their capacity, up to a maximum of 3000 seats, to away fans.
The change follows lobbying from supporters groups over the difficulty
of obtaining tickets for away matches at grounds like Old Trafford and
St James' Park, where the number of visiting supporters has been
strictly limited because of the demand from home fans.

HE MAY be the latest Great British Export but Ralph Fiennes has yet to
convince me of his classical greatness despite his RSC pedigree.
Although infinitely less moving than Alan Cummings and not as
penetrating as Stephen Dillane's intellectually riveting Dane last year,
Fiennes speaks well, grows noticeably more noble as he mentally
disintegrates and is one of the most exciting swordsmen I've ever seen
in the role. There's no doubting, too, that Jonathan Kent's Almeida
Hamlet at Hackney Empire is ''an event.'' There's not a seat to be had
and the wind rattles through Peter Davison's giant, metallic rig in a
production built on a grand, almost classic French tragedy scale (Kent
did a wonderful Le Cid at the National last year).
Kent's strengths are a tremendous visual sweep and clarity and a cast
of almost embarrassing richness (both in numbers and experience). This
is a darkly shuttered world of Edwardian rigidity set off by giant
lattice window panes and monumental doors, a court of frighteningly
empty spaces and shafting shadows and dominated by James Laurence's
dapper, frock-coated Claudius -- every inch the capable governor --
Francesca Annis's sexually charged Gertrude and Peter Eyre, a bookish
Polonious of Stoppardian wit. No wonder Fiennes's Hamlet feels so ill at
ease. There's no room for emotion in a world ruled by such rational
efficiency -- underlined in Fiennes's heart-rending cry of ''I loved
Ophelia'', uttered over her corpse. The measure of how off-course he's
been thrown by events is summed up in that moment.

FUGITIVE financial dealer Nick Leeson last night exchanged his luxury
lifestyle in the sunshine of south-east Asia for a German prison cell
after his arrest by police at Frankfurt airport.
Frankfurt state prosecutors said they had received information from
Singapore authorities accusing Mr Leeson of forging a document worth
more than #50m.
Today the 28-year-old trader -- at the centre of the collapse of
Britain's oldest merchant bank, Barings -- faces a Frankfurt magistrate
at the start of extradition proceedings.
His wife Lisa, 23, was freed, however, and flew back to Britain last
night.
State prosecutor Hans-Hermann Eckert displayed a statement relating to
the alleged forgery to reporters. It had been handed over to prosecutors
by the Singapore embassy in Bonn.
No official comment was available on the statement at the embassy.
However, a diplomatic source in Bonn said Singapore had provided German
authorities with ''grounds for extradition'' of Mr Leeson.
The source said no formal request for extradition had yet been made,
adding it would come ''later''. He did not specify when.
Mr Eckert earlier had referred to allegations only of passport
falsification contained in a national arrest warrant issued by
authorities in Singapore, where Mr Leeson had worked for Barings.
However, the statement from the Singapore embassy alleged that Mr
Leeson had ''forged a certain document''. That document was confirmation
of a payment of ''yen 7,778,000,000 (about #53m) into a Citibank account
in the name of Baring Futures with Citibank (in Singapore)'', the
statement said.
The alleged forgery was aimed at deceiving Baring Futures into
believing that this sum had been paid into the bank's account by a US
company.
''(This was) in fact not true and (Leeson) hereby committed an offence
which is punishable under Section 468 of the penal code,'' the statement
added.
Extradition could well be a protracted process -- a spokesman for the
Hessen State public prosecutor's office speculated it could take up to
four months.
Mr Leeson -- who was brought up on a council estate in Watford and
failed his maths A level -- is said to have single-handedly toppled
Barings, whose clients include the Queen, with futures deals that
produced losses of #600m.
Yesterday, however, he was reported as saying he was the ''fall guy''
who ''only blew #200m''.
The Leesons had been hunted worldwide since the bank's collapse last
weekend.
Yesterday they flew in to Frankfurt -- travelling under their own
names -- from Kotah Kinabalu in Borneo, via nearby Brunei.
They were immediately held by police on a warrant from Singapore
alleging passport forgery.
Three officials from Singapore are due to fly in to Frankfurt this
morning bringing other documents supplying more information about the
case, said the prosecutor's office.
Mr Leeson's lawyer, Mr Eberhard Kempf, who spent three hours with his
client yesterday afternoon, declined to discuss details of his
conversation with Mr Leeson, but said: ''In my experience no one who's
been arrested is happy.''
Last night the mystery still remained as to why the highly-paid dealer
and his wife decided to return to Europe from a life of luxury in
south-east Asia. According to some reports, Mr Leeson even said he
wanted to fly on to London.
At present, however, Britain has no plans to apply for his
extradition.
Meanwhile, it emerged that Dutch banking and insurance giant ING Group
is in exclusive talks with the administrators of Barings to buy
''substantially all of the businesses''.
Analysts believe it could be sold for just #1 -- but with the catch
that anyone getting it for such a bargain basement price would have to
take on the #600m worth of debts.
Mr Leeson, according to the Sun, faxed his resignation to bank
chairman Peter Baring -- then explained what he had done in telephone
calls to a friend.
''I'm the fall guy -- I only blew #200m,'' he allegedly said. ''I
wasn't acting on my own.
''Senior people knew what I was doing and the rest is down to others.
I am the sacrificial lamb.
''Lots of people knew. But I was allowed to carry on.
''Why? Because if it had worked the payday for everyone would have
been fantastic. But it went wrong and they're trying to lump all the
blame on me.''

THE International Rugby Football Board annual meeting in Bristol next
week is shaping up as one of the most significant in the game's history.
The growing clamour for an end to ''shamateurism'' will be addressed
when a working party report on worldwide abuses of amateur regulations
is presented by IB president Vernon Pugh of Wales.
Last month, the New Zealand ruling body intimated that it wanted some
kind of relaxation of the amateur rules, and yesterday it emerged that
the Welsh RU is also to press for increased rewards for top players.
Wales will propose much greater benefits, especially for those who
lose out financially through playing, touring, and training commitments.
When on tour, or involved in pre-international preparation, a player
can receive a ''hardship allowance'' of #40 a day.
Wales want this increased and for players to be able to cash in on
their high profiles, but still stopping short of being paid for playing.
Scottish IB representative Freddie McLeod has been a member of the
working party.
The SRU has also indicated that, while it remains committed to amateur
principles, it is not averse to a redefinition of the regulations which
would ensure players did not suffer financially.
The SRU is also in favour of expanding off-field earnings capacity,
whereby players could endorse rugby-related kit and products, currently
banned under IB laws.
But the express intention of the IB is that the game will stay
amateur, as only a few high-profile nations among the 65 members could
sustain even limited professionalism.
An announcement is expected during the week-long meeting.

NIGEL Mansell survived a high-speed scare yesterday -- then bounced
back to post his fastest time of the day in testing at Estoril.
The 41-year-old Englishman crashed at more than 150mph in his first
session for his new team McLaren, losing control of his Mercedes-powered
car at the Portugese track's final corner. He spun off into the
barriers, making a heavy impact with the rear end of his car.
Mansell was unhurt and returned to the track in the afternoon to clock
his best time of the day, 1min 24.37sec. However, that was nearly three
seconds slower than the week's best time, recorded by Damon Hill, who
lapped in 1-21.77 in both afternoon and morning sessions.
Hill was back in action after spending Wednesday in England, where he
was convicted of speeding and had his driving licence suspended for
seven days.

<HEADLINE>United nations -- and Scotland falls into line with cup competition Threat of crisis is averted by home unions</HEADLINE>

THE row which threatened to split the four home unions over the venue
of the 1999 Rugby World Cup competition appeared to abate last night
after a crisis meeting at a London hotel.
The Scottish Rugby Union, in alliance with the Irish RFU, found
themselves at loggerheads with the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh
RFU over Wales' bid to host the competition with a Cardiff final but
with two semi-finals being staged at Twickenham.
England were supporting the Welsh bid after withdrawing its own bid to
stage the event. The quid pro quo appeared to be the realisation of the
RFU's desire to stage the semi-finals at Twickenham.
Under the Welsh plan, the four home unions would each have hosted pool
games and Scotland and Ireland would have received only quarter-finals.
This led SRU International Board representative Freddie McLeod to
declare that the RFU was demanding more and more and that he had ''put a
pistol'' at England's head.
Scotland insisted on a Murrayfield semi-final and were supported by
Ireland which had said that it would be satisfied with the third place
play-off at Lansdowne Road.
Meanwhile, Scottish rugby was given another boost with the
announcement that it is to get a cup competition next season.
The SRU announced yesterday that the knockout cup and the revamped
premier and national league structure is confirmed and that cup final
day will be May 11 at Murrayfield.
The SRU is currently talking to a number of organisations which have
expressed interest in sponsoring the cup competition and the
long-awaited advent of an alternative to the league programme will now
bring the game in Scotland into line with England and Wales.
They say that the decision to proceed with the cup competition has
come about in response to an overwhelming desire from the clubs. The
national cup will include a bowl and a shield tournament for the losers
from rounds three and four. All three finals will be played at
Murrayfield in a grand finale to the season.
The union also announced yesterday that the format for the premier
league comprising four eight-team divisions playing on a home-and-away
basis had been refettled to cater for a two-up, two-down
promotion-relegation structure.
This, said the union, reflected a change of opinion by a number of
clubs from the previously proposed basis of one-up and one-down.
The other departure from accepted practice contained in yesterday's
announcement from Murrayfield concerns Sunday rugby.
Previously, special dispensation had to be obtained for matches played
on a Sunday but for the cup competition next season the quarter-finals
will be played on Sunday, April 20, and the semi-finals on Sunday, April
27.
Under the proposals, the premier league will be played as 14
consecutive matches between Saturday, September 2, and Saturday,
November 25. The third fixture will be played in midweek and the
thirteenth fixture played on Sunday, November 19.
At the conclusion of the premier league, all 32 clubs will take part
in four regional leagues of eight clubs. The regional leagues are
intended to provide premier league clubs with ongoing competitive rugby
while their top players are involved in the inter-district series.
In each regional league, clubs will play the seven other clubs on a
once-only basis starting on Saturday, December 9, through to Saturday,
January 27.
The final positions in the regional leagues will determine at which
stage clubs enter the cup competition, the bottom four in each regional
league entering the cup at round three and the top four entering at
round four.

<HEADLINE>Dollar hits a post-war low</HEADLINE>

The Federal Reserve bought dollars in the foreign exchange market last
night after the US currency hit a post-war low against the Japanese yen.
Dealers said the US central bank bought dollars for both German marks
and yen in an effort to prop up the flagging greenback. There were also
rumours of intervention by the Bank of Japan.
Traders said the Fed bought dollars at a rate of 95.30 yen and 1.4425
marks to the dollar.
Earlier in the session, the dollar crashed through its previous
post-Second World War low of 96.03 yen that was reached in November
1994.
The dollar has come under pressure by prospects of slowing economic
growth in the United States, the effect of the Mexican peso crisis, and
by Japanese corporations turning their dollar profits back into yen,
dealers said.
After the intervention, the dollar was trading at 1.4455 marks and
95.48 yen. That compares with a late Wednesday quote of 1.4625 marks and
96.78 yen.
The pound was quoted at $1.6165, two-and-a-half cents above its London
close, before the intervention. It ended trading at $1.6128. Against the
mark, sterling closed at 2.3271 in New York.
In Europe, the dollar sank to a new post-war low of 95.95 against the
yen, and then continued to plummet forcing the Fed to abandon its policy
of leaving the exchange rate to market forces.
The slide was triggered by rumours of repatriation of yen by large
Japanese corporations such as the postal service. Dealers said Japanese
companies were nervous about the recent financial instability and higher
costs of the Kobe earthquake.
Koichi Takenaka, a vice-president for the Industrial Bank of Japan in
New York, said many Japanese companies were repatriating funds from
their US operations in advance of the March 31 end of Japan's fiscal
year. That entails selling dollars and buying yen.
''There will be more and more buying of yen as we approach the end of
March,'' he said.
In London the Government's victory in the Euro-debate boosted the
pound initially but profit-taking clipped its gains.

ALTHOUGH Kelso missed the worst of the snow, prospects for today's
meeting are doubtful with severe frost forecast and an early morning
inspection scheduled.
Yesterday the track was frozen and unraceable until mid-day.
Although he has not given up hope that racing will go ahead, managing
director Richard Landale estimates: ''If the forecast proves right and
the meeting is off we could be looking at an accumulated loss of profits
of around #20,000.''
With #38,000 prize money on offer the card has attracted several
possible Cheltenham runners and at least two from Josh Gifford's yard in
Sussex.
The Hennessy Cognac Special Novices' Hurdle is worth #15,000 and,
although the field of seven is small from a betting point of view, it is
of quite high quality, including Len Lungo's Noyan, entered for the
Coral Cup, and Colin Parker's Sparky Gayle, who will possibly go for the
Sun Alliance Novices' Hurdle.
* EDINBURGH racecourse is to be known officially as Musselburgh, its
home for the last 179 years, from next January.
The move comes as a result of an approach to the British Horseracing
Board by East Lothian District Council, who will control a new company
which has been set up to operate the course.

THE name is a bit of a mouthfull, and it certainly left a sour taste
with Scottish rugby's comeback kid, Doddie Weir.
The Springbok scrum half, Joost van der Westhuizen, nipped down the
blind-side from a corner flag scrum at Murrayfield last November. The
try which followed came gift-wrapped and with the best wishes of the
entire Scottish team -- bar one.
Weir, playing at No.8, was alone in seeing it coming. Scrum half
Derrick Patterson had assumed that the ball was going wide, blind-side
flanker Dave McIvor was posted missing, and only Weir got close enough
to interrupt van der Westhuizen's stately progress to the line.
It was Weir's misfortune that he was in the frame when the scrum half
dotted down the ball. To most of the 67,000 witnesses to the felony it
seemed as if Weir had been caught red-handed, still on the premises when
the Peelers arrived.
He was dropped from the side thereafter. Van der Westhuizen's freak
try was not exclusively down to Weir, but it probably coloured
selectorial thinking that the Melrose youngster was jaded and suffering
from a surfeit of top-class rugby.
Now he is back after a superb second half display in Paris a fortnight
ago, when he came on for the injured Damian Cronin. That he was in the
party at all had come about through an injury before the Ireland match
to the first-choice bench replacement, Shade Munro.
However, like Scott Hastings, tomorrow's other returnee, Weir has
grabbed his chance with both hands and is delighted to be back in
Scottish colours.
''Of course, it's tough luck on Damian and Shade, but that's rugby. I
don't really mind whether I get in through the back door or the front.
I'm desperate to play for Scotland and I think that I've got back my
hunger for the game.
''I deserved to be dropped after the South Africa match. I hadn't been
playing to my full potential. I don't know why that should have been.
You know, you kind of think that it's going to happen for you, but then
when it doesn't you're left wondering what's going wrong.
''The selectors have given me a good kick up the backside. Nobody
likes that, of course, but I'm back now and raring to go. I'm feeling
sharper than I was before Christmas. I've been doing a lot of weight
training and fitness and sprint work with Alan Tierney and the national
squad coordinator, Roy Laidlaw, across at Gala.
''Now I'm back, I know that a lot of people want my place and nothing
short of 110 per cent will do,'' he says.
''When I was dropped after the New Zealand game in '93, I was on the
bench for the Welsh match at the start of the 1994 Five Nations'
campaign, and I got on when Iain Morrison came off hurt. That was
probably bad for me, because I got back too soon. However, this time
I've missed a few games and I'm really keen to show what I can do.''
His lineout expertise will be at a premium against Wales. The Welshmen
field the 6ft 10in lock Derwyn Jones and Gareth Llewellyn, who is only
four inches shorter. Weir, at 6ft 6in, and his touchline partner,
Stewart Campbell, who is of similar stature, will mix-and-match in an
effort to keep big Derwyn guessing.
''I've seen videos, but I've not played against Jones before. My
Melrose team-mate, Carl Hogg, played against him when he was guesting
for Ayr against Cardiff last season and has given me a few tips.''
Weir wins his twenty-sixth cap against Wales, appearing in the second
row for the sixteenth time. His preferred position is still No.8, but of
late his club have been giving him a run on the blind-side flank.
He said: ''I still much prefer No.8, but I don't really mind where I
play for Scotland. It's such a great honour to represent your country.
''After you've been in the side a while I suppose you get a wee bit
blase. The butterflies would start on the Thursday before the match, but
now, after my absence, I've been focused on this game all week.
''So far as Scotland is concerned, I don't care where I play. I'd play
at scrum half and kick the goals if they wanted me to.''

<HEADLINE>Lonrho severs all links with its founder. Tiny Rowland to pursue Bock'until the end of his days'</HEADLINE>

LONRHO has finally severed all links with founder and former chief
executive Tiny Rowland who last night threatened to sue the company. He
had already been ousted from his position as joint chief executive last
November after a 33-year reign following a long drawn out power struggle
with his successor, Dieter Bock.
Yesterday's statement from Lonrho said that it had cut ties completely
with Mr Rowland, who leaves the board and will not become president of
the company as had been intended following the annual meeting to be held
this month.
But Mr Rowland immediately hit back in typical style saying that he
intended to sue the company for breach of contract and vowing to pursue
Mr Bock ''until the end of his days.'' He said it was the act of a
desperate man and he would get ''the best QCs and my lawyers to sue
Lonrho and Bock, in particular.''
Earlier, Lonrho's statement said: ''It is with regret that the Board
of Lonrho announce that Mr E W Rowland's association with the company
has come to an end,''.
''However, Mr Rowland's continuing public and irreconcilable
differences with the company are in the board's view incompatible with
any continuing association. Accordingly, Mr Rowland has ceased to be a
director or employee of the company with immediate effect.''
Mr Rowland's dismissal, which took the form of a letter signed by nine
directors after an early morning meeting, came after Lonrho had
confirmed that it was to sue the German magazine Focus and the Mail on
Sunday and ''any others involved'' over allegations that had been made
about Mr Bock. ''These actions will be pursued with vigour and
determination to ensure that the interests of Lonrho's shareholders are
not further damaged,'' the statement said.
The articles concerned the 1993 sale by Lonrho of its German property
subsidiaries which owned 4300 flats.
Lonrho said that after company officials read the articles, it had
asked its auditors, KPMG, to examine the details of the transactions.
''They have confirmed that the accounting treatment and disclosure of
the 1993 accounts of Lonrho is appropriate and consistent with the
facts'', said the statement.
The sale produced a profit of #8m, which Lonrho believes reflects a
good price. The company had made unsuccessful efforts over a long period
to achieve such as sale.
Mr Rowland's departure is in some way symbolic except that it looks
like leading to yet another of his renowned battles, this time possibly
in the courts. His power and influence with the company had already been
stripped away when he lost his position as joint chief executve. But it
does mean that he will lose his salary which, along with benefits and
expenses, had been due to be paid until the end of the current year.
This was not an insubstantial package amounting to about #5.5m and had
been the subject of considerable controversy.
But then controversy was something the former Lonrho chief had always
thrived on. About 20 years ago, he was memorably described by the then
Prime Minister Edward Heath as ''the unacceptable face of capitalism''
after he had out manoeuvred eight directors who were seeking to remove
him from the board.
Later came the battle with the Fayeds over House of Fraser. An end to
the hostilities with the Fayeds was eventually agreed but Mr Rowland
found he had another fight on his hands in Mr Bock. The German
businessman acquired an 18.8% stake in the then financially strapped
company and was clearly Mr Rowland's chosen successor.
Mr Rowland spent the last year in periodic conflict with Mr Bock but
the sands finally ran out for him last November. Yesterday's development
was the final touch though Mr Rowland has a habit of hitting back -- in
his own unique fashion -- as Australian-based tycoon Alan Bond found to
his cost when he tangled with Tiny.
Lonrho shares firmed just 1[1/2]p to 148p.

THE Welsh side arrived in Edinburgh yesterday for the clash with
Scotland, determined to recover the winning habit that made them Five
Nations champions last season, writes Derek Douglas.
Wales currently prop up the the table, having lost to France and
England. But skipper Ieuan Evans, who wins his 50th cap tomorrow,
declared:
''This season's championship is well gone, but it's vital we do well
at Murrayfield to take us to the final game of the season and to the
World Cup.''
Evans, only recently back in the Wales side after a severe ankle
injury, sang the praises of his Scottish counterpart Gavin Hastings.
''He was under pressure at the beginning of the season, but he has
shown that class will always tell.
''His two perfomances in the Five Nations this year have been superb,
and I wouldn't have expected anything less from him,'' said Evans.
Welsh manager Robert Norster said they had been pleasantly surprised
by the turnaround in Scottish fortunes this season:
''We sympathised with what they were going through. It is great for
them to bounce back after the criticism they have taken.
''Gavin has taken a lot of personal criticism, but he has answered the
critics in the best possible way.
''It all gives Saturday's game meaning -- there's a positive edge to
it, instead of it being a dogfight.''
The youngster in the Welsh camp, debutant prop Spencer John, recalled
the last time he was in Edinburgh:
''I was up here with Wales Under-21 two years ago, and then we went to
Murrayfield for the game to spectate.
''I didn't think then that I'd be back so soon actually playing in the
side.''

THE Scotland under-21 team which seeks to overturn a run of defeats
stretching back to 1986 in the encounter with their Welsh counterparts
at Inverleith this afternoon (kick-off 3.0) will have taken heart from
the example set by the full side against France a fortnight ago, when
the 26-year Paris hoodoo was laid to rest, writes Derek Douglas.
Manager Derrick Grant said yesterday: ''The boys are very conscious of
this record and will be trying ultra hard to get it off their backs.''
Coach David Leslie added: ''What the Scottish side did in Paris two
weeks ago has been a great example. They overcame that psychological
hurdle with a great display of guts and determination.''
Two weeks ago the Scotland under-21 side were defeated 35-12 by their
French counterparts. The Boroughmuir stand-off Bryan Easson, who scored
all of Scotland's points with four penalty goals, has been relegated to
the bench in favour of Duncan Hodge, whose dramatic drop-goal secured
victory for Scotland A against the Springboks. Assistant coach John
Rutherford said that Hodge offered ''a wee bit more by way of physical
presence.''
The coaches are looking for a more ''streetwise'' performance from
their charges today. Grant added: ''Despite the fact that our guys are
playing first division rugby, sometimes at this level they are not so
wordly-wise as those from the other countries. This is something that we
are seeking to remedy.''
Scotland Under-21 -- P W B Flockhart (Stewart's Melville FP); H R
Gilmour (Heriot's FP), M N McGrandles (Stirling County), C A Cameron

AT the end of the second day of round-robin play in the Macallan
Scottish Curling Championships in Perth, Hammy McMillan heads the
rankings with a 100% record.
The Stranraer team had three wins yesterday to go with their opening
round victory on Wednesday night, starting the day with a 6-3 win over
Drew Tasker in the morning session, before going on to beat Graeme Adam
by 7-4, and then concluding a satisfactory day's work with a 7-5 win
over Robin Gray.
McMillan now stands alone on four wins and no losses, but three teams
are breathing down his neck with only one loss out of four games each.
Among them is Gordon Muirhead, who made up for an opening round defeat
with three straight wins yesterday. The other two teams on three wins
are those of Struan MacNee and Warwick Smith. Results:
Second round -- Wilson (Greenacres) 4, Muirhead (Livingston) 5; Adam
(East Kilbride) 4, Prentice (Lockerbie) 7; McMillan (Stranraer) 6,
Tasker (Letham Grange) 3; Gray (Forest Hills) 4, Smith (Perth) 9; MacNee
(Murrayfield) 5, Kenny (Kinross) 2.
Third round -- Kenny 2, Prentice 9; Smith 9, Tasker 4; MacNee 6,
Wilson 4; Adam 4, McMillan 5; Gray 5, Muirhead 6.
Fourth round -- Smith 8, MacNee 4; Gray 5, McMillan 7; Muirhead 7,
Prentice 6; Kenny 3, Wilson 5; Tasker 5, Adam 9.
Standings after four rounds -- McMillan, 4 wins, 0 losses; Smith, 3-1;
Muirhead, 3-1; MacNee 3-1; Prentice, 2-2; Wilson, 2-2; Gray, 1-3;

SCOTLAND's senior men's hockey clubs make their official return to
outdoor duty faced with a double header that could play an important
role in league and cup hopes. MIM, fresh from triumph in the European
Indoor Championships, face the biggest test against Western tomorrow at
Cramond in the Torrie Stockbrokers National League.
On Sunday they travel to meet Menzieshill in the cup. Rivalry between
the clubs is intense, particularly after the Dundonians relieved MIM of
both domestic indoor crowns.
Both clubs are confident of victory. Jimmy Cox, Menzieshill's
international defender, said:
''Our indoor successes have given us a tremendous lift, and if we keep
the game simple we should get the verdict.''
Andrew Kay, MIM's experienced campaigner, naturally disagreed. But he,
too, looks indoors for inspiration.
''The European triumph has brought the lads closer together, and we
are a better team than them outdoors.''
In the other ties, Grange, Western, and Touche Ross should beat Pender
Uddingston, Devol Greenock, and Stepps respectively.

Arsenal 1, Auxerre 1
ARSENAL'S grip on the European Cup-winners' Cup looks tenuous after
the clever technicians of Auxerre -- the club that nurtured Basil Boli
and Eric Cantona -- gained a deserved draw at Highbury last night.
Ian Wright maintained his record of scoring in every tie in the
competition this season, this time with a debatable penalty, but the
visitors equalised almost immediately and hung on thereafter.
Arsenal had the Swedish referee to thank for their goal on the hour.
He ruled, harshly, that Jensen had been tripped, and Wright, rather than
the goalkeeper, was Mr Cool from the penalty spot.
Auxerre equalised within two minutes, the Dutch sweeper Verlaat
heading in Martins' free kick.
On Auxerre's last visit to England, two years ago, their coach Guy
Roux felt they were caught unawares by Liverpool's physical approach and
an intimidating Anfield.
Adams, Bould and the Clock end -- refusing repeated police requests to
sit rather than stand -- ensured a similarly warm welcome even as snow
fell at the kick-off.
George Graham's successor, Stewart Houston, picking his first team
under European rules, had disappointed fellow-Scot Paul Dickov in naming
Stefan Schwarz, John Jensen and Welsh striker John Hartson as the three
foreign players. It was Schwarz who provided the first test for
Auxerre's third-choice keeper, Cool, with a fierce drive from 15 yards
that was well pushed away.
Having weathered both the snow storm and Arsenal's early storm,
Auxerre ought to have earned themselves the lead and an away goal in the
only the tenth minute. Vahiruo, a French internationalist with 22 caps,
hit a cross shot from the left that striker Loslondes, completely
unmarked, steered round of the far post.
Roux had clearly done his homework, using Vahiruo and Lomouchi out
wide to counter Arsenal's attacking full backs as well as offering
outlets when the French pushed forward. They did that with increasing
confidence as the game wore on and finished the first half on top with
Loslandes heading narrowly over the bar then stooping to head wide.
Postponed: Reserve League Cup: Semi-final -- Falkirk v Celtic (pitch
waterlogged).

<HEADLINE>Rover puts BAe back in profit</HEADLINE>

ANALYSTS need pretty good radar sets to see their way through the fog
of exceptional items and changing accounting principles at British
Aerospace. However, it does appear that prospects at BAe are brighter
than they have been for some time because the defence and civil aviation
group is back in profit for the first time in four years.
The pre-tax surplus including exceptional items was #211m compared
with a #257m loss. There is a 20% increase in the dividend total to 10p
with a 6p final rather. The results show a #396m profit on the #800m
sale of Rover which helped keep BAe alive but whose disposal to BMW will
in the long term not be in the best interests of the UK engineering
industry.
That benefit was partially offset by the #245m of charges relating to
the closure of the Jetstream 61 regional aircraft production line and
several less significant items. That will reduce the civil aviation
division's costs by around #50m annually.
BAe recently announced a joint venture with the Franco-Italian ATR
regional plane group. Also on the civil side, BAe has a 20% stake in
Airbus and is now seeing cash flow generated at least a year ahead of
forecast as the consortium wins market share from both Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas.
Chief execuitive Dick Evans said BAe had made substantial efficiency
gains which has enabled it to bring sub-structure manufacturing back
in-house -- the company shed 11,000 jobs last year apart from the Rover
disposal. However, the defence side remains the money spinner.
Against expectations, the Ministry of Defence has increased spending
on equipment and ammunition in the ordnance division. The overall order
book has risen 10% to #9700m, a record level. Profits improved 19% to
#412m while margins hardened to 9% -- civil aircraft losses were
marginally reduced to #156m and could halve this time round.
BAe has sold about 40 Hawk fighters to Saudi Arabia as part of the
on-going Al Yamamah contract, the world's biggest defence deal.
Mr Evans remained mute on the bid for VSEL -- the MMC is expected to
report to President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine on March 10.
Now shed of the bulk of its diversification and less of a financial
engineering group, presumably, BAe is fighting to keep its end up
against Dasa, the aviation division of Daimler-Benz.
The Germans are insisting that they have 33% of all the workshare in
the Eurofighter 2000 irrespective of how many aircraft are ordered by
the German air force. The Luftwaffe will buy considerably fewer than the
RAF.
By rights Daimler should have only 24% of the work compared with BAe's
47%. But it is demanding that BAe's share of the Future Large Aircraft
-- a transport plane -- should be only in proportion to the number
ordered by Britain.
However, other joint ventures, such as one with the French company
Matra, should be easier to agree.
At 471p, down 8p, the shares yield 2.6%.

ASTON Villa manager Brian Little has joined the chase for Scotland
midfield player Billy McKinlay, who is rated at #1.5m. I understand that
Little has made two approaches to Dundee United manager Ivan Golac about
the player who has made it clear that he wants to leave Tannadice.
Leicester City tried to buy McKinlay soon after Mark McGhee took over
as manager at Filbert Street but were scared off by the asking price.
Since then Newcastle United have sent assistant manager Terry
McDermott north to watch the player but Little has been the most
persistent. The Villa manager has had the player watched and while his
team seems to be in a comfortable mid-table position he knows that they
can still be dragged into the relegation dogfight.
McKinlay has made himself a regular in the Scotland squad since Craig
Brown took over as international team manager, winning six caps. The
Glasgow-born player is one of the victims of the lengthy contracts which
Dundee United have used repeatedly. At the moment he is seeing out a
deal which has tied him to the club for eight-and-a-half years.
As a 17-year-old, he accepted a four-and-a-half year deal with a
further four-and-a-half years under the controversial option clause
which will soon be outlawed by the Scottish League.
He has already raised an action against the club in the Court of
Session asking that the option clause be set aside. Effectively, that
could make him a free agent.
The Tayside club's best option seems to be to sell the player -- just
as they did with Gary Bollan who went to Rangers last month after
threatening court action when he lost an appeal to the league against a
contract similar to the one McKinlay signed.
Now that Little has pursued his interest with two direct inquiries to
Golac, a transfer could happen sooner rather than later.
Golac has suggested that he wants a turnover in personnel and has been
gradually going about it. If McKinlay goes then he would have more money
available to bring in the players he wants as he continues to try to put
his own stamp on a side he may yet leave in the summer.
* THE Scottish League Transfer Tribunal performed another of its
balancing acts yesterday when they decided on a #305,000 fee for Brian
Hamilton, who left Hibs for Hearts in January.
The midfield player walked out on the Easter Road side to make the
cross-city move under freedom of contract. He had spent five-and-a-half
years with Hibs after joining them from St Mirren.
Hibs manager Alex Miller asked the tribunal to set the transfer fee at
#425,000 while his Tynecastle counterpart Tommy McLean offered #250,000
less. So, it was no great surprise when the figure settled at was almost
exactly midway between the contrasting claims of the two Edinburgh
clubs.
The fee is #260,000 with a further #45,000 in VAT and it must be paid
inside a month, according to league rules governing transfer tribunals.
After the meeting McLean said: ''We feel that the fee is a realistic
one. We are happy with the outcome.''
In contrast, Miller left without comment.
* MOTHERWELL'S bid to stay in second top place in the premier division
and repeat their UEFA Cup appearances of this season came under more
threat yesterday when their Republic of Ireland World Cup striker Tommy
Coyne had his leg put in plaster, ruling him out for at least a month.

Ross Finlay uncovers the appeal of a new classic
ALTHOUGH all motor manufacturers take a keen interest in rival
products, to the extent of buying them in and stripping them to see how
the opposition deals with mechanical elements, bodywork details and
factory processes, it is not usual for one company to mention another
quite openly.
Rover made no bones about what the 600 series was meant to be, when
this range was launched two years ago. It said its designers were trying
to achieve ''the image of a small Bentley''.
This may seem rather odd, considering that the 600 was a joint
Rover/Honda project. However, the Rover people managed, with their own
interior and bodywork details, to distance the 600 from their Japanese
partners. Such items as the discreet burr walnut trim, and the stainless
steel sill plates, all emphasised the Britishness of the 600 compared
with its other-badged virtual twin.
One area in which the 600 originally lagged well behind the Bentley
image was performance. The 623iS was a step in the right direction, but
not a full one. Things changed when the 620ti arrived, using Rover's own
turbocharged two-litre 200bhp engine, as also seen in the 220 Coupe and
the 800 Vitesse Sport. This extra level of performance is better
controlled than in some cars in the Rover catalogue.
At #20,395 the test car seemed well equipped, although it came with no
extra-cost options whatever. The 600 is meant to be an executive-class
saloon, and, although I have a hankering after the looks of models like
the 800 Vitesse with its elegant rear spoiler, the fact that the 620ti
does without that kind of detail certainly makes it look very
unobtrusive. All the same, six-spoke alloy wheels with extremely
businesslike tyres show that this is definitely the top performance
variant of the range.
It is a surprise that a car so understated in appearance should bullet
to 60mph in dead-on seven seconds. The T-series turbo engine is not
peaky. As long as you keep it revving in the mid range, it will respond
to the throttle with bursts of very snappy acceleration. It is as
flexible as a high performance turbo saloon can be expected to be in
traffic, and on a test track it would waft to a maximum speed over
140mph.
It is in its element as a long-distance motorway car. Steady-speed
fuel consumption figures are good for the type at 46mpg at 56mph and 36
at 75, compared with a likely 24mpg around town. However, while I
appreciate that the final drive ratio helps the car's flexibility and
response, I thought that such a fine motorway cruiser might easily have
been pulling fewer revs.
This is still not entirely a sports saloon. Rover does not go in for
pin-point steering feel, preferring to make its cars easy and relaxing
to drive. But even if the 620ti steering hardly feeds as much
information back to the driver on fast corners as more outright sporting
rivals, it has crushing acceleration to keep the average speeds up
everywhere else. Fortunately, this powerful car's torque-steer element
is quite small. The Torsen (torque-sensing) differential, developed by
Rover and the Belgian subsidiary of the Japanese engineering group
Gleason, originally for the 220 Coupe, also works well here. I have seen
criticisms of the 620ti's ride over bumps, and they seem rather unfair.
At least, the test car was noticeably well poised on the humps and dips
which litter the Loch Longside road to Arrochar. Not many high
performance saloons I have tried along that road could match it.
The interior is to Rover's highest standards of finish and trim.
Exterior paintwork is fine. The passenger cabin is roomy without being
the best in the class, and there is plenty of space in the unexpectedly
capacious boot. At the same time, the 620ti offers a woomph of
acceleration linked with very easy high-speed cruising. The top car in
the 600 range has many different areas of appeal.

In Atlantic City
GARY Jacobs has come a long way since making his professional boxing
debut 10 years ago in a six-round contest in Glasgow, and tomorrow
night, in America's east coast gambling capital, he will take the final
step towards his boxing ambition.
The 29-year-old Scot meets Jose Miguel Fernandez, of New Jersey, and,
barring a major upset, his next contest will be a bout with World Boxing
Council welterweight champion Pernell Whitaker.
The former undefeated European champion will be making his third
appearance in America and this time it is all about impressing the
television executives, who have Whitaker tied up in a lucrative
contract.
Jacobs is the official No.1 contender for Whitaker's title, but in
these times nothing is certain in boxing and it is vital that he puts on
a good show against an opponent who has been brought in to replace Tom
Alexander.
The Fernandez record is not impressive -- just five wins from 13
contests -- but Jacobs certainly cannot afford any complacency,
especially after his last experience in America, when he also had to
face a substitute opponent.
That was almost six years ago in New York. On that occasion, when his
original opponent pulled out, the replacement was James ''Buddy''
McGirt. The Scot lost on points and McGirt went on to win a world title.
Jacobs said: ''I've learned a lot since then. McGirt proved himself a
great fighter, and when I win the world title, perhaps I'll give him
first shot at it.
''I know people say it can be upsetting for a boxer when he is faced
with a change of opponent, but that doesn't apply to me this time. I am
ready for whatever.
''Fernandez is no threat to me. I must win on Saturday night, and I
will win with a bit of style.''
The Scot has been in America since Monday, but has given little away
in his training sessions on this side of the big pond. His final heavy
workout was done in Glasgow last Friday, when he had his last sparring
session. This week it has been merely a matter of keeping things ticking
over by running, shadow boxing, and some work on the pads.
This will be the Scot's first appearance in the ring since he
outpointed Marcelo di Croce four months ago and nothing is getting in
the way of his dream of a world title shot.
''Since I was rated top contender by the WBC I've hardly thought of
anything other than a fight with Whitaker,'' he said. ''The time is
right for me to make my mark.
''I'm much more at ease with myself these days and everything I do is
for my family. I want to give my wife and two young daughters a good
life, and the best way I can achieve that is to become champion of the
world.''

A CALL for a broad-based campaign to counter the anti-meat philosophy
being expounded by animal rights activists is to be studied by the
National Farmers' Union of Scotland.
Addressing the union's council in Aberdeen yesterday Mr John Ross,
president, warned that the real aim of some protest groups was to stop
people eating meat. ''That is their real agenda and we might as well
recognise it and square up to it,'' he said.
''We don't have a quick fix -- but if the meat industry works together
we can get our positive message across.''
He deplored the fact that at present a serious and important debate
had been taken over by 'bully boys and thugs' but he forecast that the
British public would not tolerate full-time extremists who appeared not
to care who was hurt in the interests of whatever cause they had latched
on to.
The union's approach was to focus on ensuring that the vast majority
of the public realised that British farmers were responsible and taking
positive steps to get acceptable changes made, he said.
European laws had to be strengthened, animal transport legislation had
to be tightened up and calf production systems on the continent had to
be reviewed.
Farming was becoming more and more controversial, he said. The
production, processing and consumption of food was no a matter of
unrelenting debate. ''It's a debate where extreme views get more than
their fair share of attention and we are witnessing ever more
professionally presented anti-meat propaganda in our schools. We just
can't afford to allow this slanted and one-sided story to go
unchallenged.''
Mr Ross presented a cheque for #1000 to the Scottish Farm and
Countryside Educational Trust as a token of support for their work.
Mr John Don, of Aberdeen and Kincardine, indicated that he felt much
more needed to be done. What was required, he suggested was a
'pan-industry, hearts and minds campaign' to alert the general public to
what was going on. 'Our opponents have a determined strategy -- to
change the country's attitude to the ethics of meat eating,' he said.
'They are challenging society.'
It was not just the livestock industry which was under threat, the
meat and poultry sectors were also being questioned.
The issue was possibly beyond the the capabilities of the farmers'
unions or the Meat and Livestock Commission, he said. ''I think it needs
a new body or trust or foundation which could pick up really heavy money
from the whole of the agricultural industry. There is a determined
campaign to undermine us and we will have to fight back -- not with a
knee-jerk reaction but with a campiagn to mobilise the British public on
our behalf.''
Mr Ross promised that Mr Don's proposals would be given serious
consideration by the union but he questioned whether any more could be
achieved by creating a new body rather than ensuring that existing
bodies were adequately funded.
The unwillingness of a majority of farmers to join the various farm
quality assurance schemes was criticised by a number of speakers. Mr
Maitland Mackie, Aberdeen, argued that the good practice set out in Farm
Assured Scottish Livestock scheme, of which he is chairman, could go a
long way to meeting the public's need for re-assurance on welfare
standards.
''There is nothing which could take us further down the road of making
an opportunity out of a crisis,'' he said. If a majority of farmers
signed up it would be much easier to shout from the rooftops about the
professionalism of the Scottish farmer. It would be a whole-industry
approach unique in the world.  Mr Alex Brown, in his valedictory speech
as convener of the milk committee, launched an attack on the
intervention board for its inefficiency in dealing with milk quota
transfers. ''It is totally unacceptable that producers' businesses
should be put at risk through continued delays and confusion. The board
must put its house in order. Things will have to improve rapidly if the
producers are to have any confidence in the intervention board's ability
in future,'' he said.
He accepted a suggestion that the Scottish Office should become
involved in running a small unit to deal with quota transfers within
Scotland.

PRINCE Naseem Hamed breezed into a snow-clad Glasgow yesterday and
immediately announced his own version of global warming would be
unveiled tomorrow night in Livingston.
That is when the Sheffield showman puts his World Boxing Council
International super-bantamweight title on the line against the tough
Argentinian, Sergio Liendo.
The 21-year-old Hamed predicted the atmosphere in the Forum is going
to be electric. ''The Scots are the most knowledgeable fight fans I have
ever met. They enjoy their boxing and appreciate the best, and that's
what I aim to be.
''My target has always been the world championship, nothing less would
be considered satisfactory to my way of thinking.
''I'm ready right now to take on the top contenders, but politics in
this game mean I have to meet the Liendos of this world and that's my
immediate concern.''
The customary head-to-head meeting of the main players in this
intriguing title showdown produced a barrowload of conflicting
predictions with Naseem boasting: ''All I can say to the sell-out crowd
is that you're in for a night to remember, and don't blink in the third
round, because that's when I expect it to happen.
''I hate predictions, because it puts unnecessary pressure on me, but
I firmly believe I can bring it to an early finish. So watch out for the
third, it's going to be explosive.
''I know this guy will be up for it, otherwise he wouldn't be here,
and a record of 49 wins against decent opposition speaks for itself. But
he ain't met no-one like me. I'm something special.''
Hamed's predictions did not fall on deaf ears with Scottish fight
manager Alex Morrison quick to put up a case for the Argentinian
contender. ''I've watched him closely at my Sydney Street gym for the
past week and I was most impressed. He's tough, has fast hands, and as
an amateur was rated world class. When I see a pedigree like that I'm
always wary.
''If I have to put my head on the line, I would go for a points win in
favour of Hamed, because I do not think he is capable of stopping this
tough little guy.''
Liendo's amateur record of 58 wins from 60 campaigns, coupled with a
pro career of 49 wins, lost four, and drawn three suggests Morrison has
done his homework on this one.
Hamed's manager, Brendan Ingle, respects Morrison's assessment but was
a shade more confident of the outcome. ''Liendo will be no pushover. We
know he's a tough customer, but again everybody said Armando Castro
would trouble Naz and he tumbled in four rounds.
''I think Naz, after sizing up the guy, will got to business in about
the fourth or fifth round. Naz goes for three, I say it will not go
beyond five.''
Liendo's Argentinian millionaire boxing adviser, Hernan Nicolini, as
expected, claims his man will win. ''We didn't come here to enjoy the
beautiful scenery, we want to take that WBC belt back to Cordoba.''
Liendo's manager, Juan Carlos Pradeiro, added: ''Sergio held this
title before Hamed, so we have come to get it back. We don't predict
endings, but we will win for sure.''
In the main supporting bout, newly-crowned British cruiserweight
champion Dennis Andries meets experienced American journeyman Mike Peak
of Kentucky over 10 rounds.
The last time the pair met, at Earls Court, a disturbance outside the
ring brought the fight to a premature ending.
The 29-year-old Louisville boxer briefly held the World Boxing
Association light-heavyweight title. He has met three world champions
along the way and eagerly awaits this rematch.
British featherweight champion Michael Deveney, of Paisley, is
featured in one of the 13 supporting bouts which sees Glasgow
lightweight title contender Dave Anderson face Mike Heron of Birmingham.
Other Scots on the bill include Maybole's Shaun Anderson,
Auchengeich's Brian Carr, and Edinburgh's John Wilson.

DES Smyth shot a 68, three under par, to share the lead with Spaniard
Santiago Luna in the Andalucian Open yesterday.
Only 11 of the 144-strong field, battling against a strong wind, broke
par at the Islantilla club near Huelva in southern Spain.
Smyth and Luna lead another Spaniard, Miguel-Angel Martin, and
Welshman Philip Price by one stroke, while Jose Maria Olazabal,
recovering from an operation on his right big toe, was back in the pack
on 72.
Smyth was helped by a putting tip from Irish colleague Eoghan
O'Connell, who told him to go back on his heels instead of leaning
forward when he struck the ball, but it was Smyth's course management
that earned him his score.
Gary Orr, the 27-year-old Scot, went from two under to three over when
he had a 9 at the thirteenth, and there were tales of woe from all parts
of the course.
One of the more contented players was Sam Torrance, who shot a 70 with
only one bogey, at the thirteenth, on his card.
Another happy man was Welshman Paul Mayo, who had a hole in one at the
208-yard eleventh, which helped him to a 72. Leading scores (British and
Irish unless otherwise stated):
68 -- D Smyth, S Luna (Spain).
69 -- P Price, M-A Martin (Spain).
70 -- S Torrance, W Riley (Australia), I Palmer (S Africa), F Tarnaud
(France), M Mouland, F Valera (Spain), D Hospital (Spain).
71 -- C Rocca (Italy), P Quirici (Switzerland), J Bickerton, E
O'Connell, P McGinley, A Cejka (Germany), P Hedblom (Sweden), J Robson.
72 -- D Borrego (Spain), J-M Olazabal (Spain), J-M Canizares (Spain),
V Fernandez (Argentina), P Linhart (Spain), A Mednick (Sweden), M
Hallberg (Sweden), A Hunter, M Davis, J Pinero (Spain), A Sherborne, P
Mayo, M Farry (France), T Munoz (Spain), M-A Jimenez (Spain), O Karlsson
(Sweden), J Quiros (Spain), R Claydon, J Mellor, L White, A Bossert
(Switzerland).
Other scores included:
73 -- A Coltart, S S McAllister.
75 -- D Gilford, A Oldcorn, R Drummond.
76 -- D Robertson, G Orr.
77 -- C Ronald, P Lawrie.
78 -- C O'Connor Jr, B Gallacher.
NICK Faldo shot a five-under-par 67 yesterday in the Doral Open to
finish two strokes off the first-round lead, held by Davis Love III,
Scott Verplank, and Steve Lowery. Leading scores (American unless
stated):
65 -- D Love III, S Verplank, S Lowery.
66 -- T Kite, F Allem (S Africa), W Austin.
67 -- N Faldo (England), S Elkington (Australia), D Duval.
68 -- G Norman (Australia), H Sutton, B Claar, S Rintoul (Australia),
N Ozaki (Japan), P Jacobsen, B Glasson, J Leonard, P Stewart, M Heinen.
69 -- B Langer (Germany), M Calcavecchia, M O'Meara, S Kendall, J
Sluman, B Andrade, J Haas, T Tyner.
Other scores included: 71 -- J Parnevik (Sweden). 72 -- C Montgomerie
(Scotland). 75 -- D Feherty (N Ireland). 76 -- S Ballesteros (Spain).
* TWO of Scottish golf's elder statesmen, Barclay Howard and Les
McLaughlin, proved age is no barrier in Malaga yesterday when they
helped Scotland's C team to victory in the Nations Cup.
The Scots' total of 302 tied them with Sweden, but as the
Scandinavians had only entered a two-man team they had no third score to
count in the event of a tie, Scotland taking the title with David
Downie's 78. Leading aggregates:
302 -- Scotland C (B Howard 75, L McLaughlin 77, D Downie 78); Sweden
(Scotland C won on count-back). 304 -- Spain.
Other aggregates: 314 -- Scotland A (S Mackenzie 76, C Watson 78, B
Collier, did not count). 316 -- Scotland B (C Hislop 74, R Clark 78, M
Brooks 82, did not count).
* GORDON Sherry qualified for the matchplay stages of the Argentinian
Amateur championship in Buenos Aires yesterday despite carding a
five-over-par 77 in windy conditions for a total of 147. Ireland's
Padraig Harrington fared only slightly better with a 75.
* SCOTLAND'S Alison Rose, Lindsey Roxburgh and Hilary Monaghan
qualified for the matchplay stage of the Spanish Women's Amateur
championship at Las Brisas yesterday. Fiona McKay missed the cut by a
shot on 159. Scottish aggregates:
154 -- A Rose (Stirling) 76, 78. 155 -- L Roxburgh (Tain) 77, 78. 157
-- H Monaghan (Longniddry) 74, 83. 159 -- F McKay (Turnberry) 79, 80.
161 -- J Ford (Gullane) 80, 81. 166 -- L Nicholson (Haddington) 79, 87;
S McMaster (Dunbar) 79, 87. 175 -- C Agnew (Eastwood) 90, 85.

THERE are two or three certainties that emerge each time boxing throws
up a tragedy such as the blood clot suffered by American Gerald
McClellan at the end of his fight with Nigel Benn.
There will be loud calls for the sport to be banned; there will be
appeals for headguards to be used; each in turn will be ignored.
The debate is being resurrected in the usual passionate and
well-meaning fashion, but it will ebb away once the latest tragedy slips
off the front and back pages.
The protest at boxing's very existence is heartfelt and based on
compassion for young men who volunteer to take risks of severe injury,
sometimes worse, in the name of sport.
Even those of us who have long agonised with an ambivalent conscience
over the rights of a sport which is simply sophisticated street fighting
-- however ''noble' its greatest advocates claim it may be -- cannot
morally defend its existence.
It is not possible to mount an ethical argument against the charge
which insists that, in a civilised world, people should not pay money to
watch two human beings trying to batter each other into submission.
Yet we do, and will continue to do so. Why? Because it is
unquestionably exciting as a sport, and we comfort ourselves in the
knowledge that the men who do it can achieve a very successful and
comfortable lifestyle, one which might not be available otherwise.
They are not co-erced into taking part, and would certainly do so in
shady, illegal, and highly dangerous circumstances if the sport were
banned.
It is the latter argument that has to prevail against any decision,
however conscientious, to sweep it into illegal territory.
If people really care about the welfare of those who will go into
boxing rings, officially or otherwise, they should think carefully about
subjecting young men to the old fairground mentality, when it was the
norm to fight till you fell over.
There are enough questionable dealers in the professional game as it
is, dinner-suited parasites who collect huge fortunes without so much as
having a hair ruffled.
It would be folly to open the gates to the unwashed two-bit
practitioners who would revel in the illegal fight game, where medical
supervision and proper safeguards would be given scant attention.
Yet, if the boxing business has to be allowed in its present form
simply because it is the only way to ensure some safeguards for the
health of the men involved, is it not time it accepted the pressure for
headguards?
All the usual arguments against this protective aid will be trawled
out once more.
The headguards offer only marginal protection, they are clumsy and
annoy fighters, most of whom would prefer not to have them.
Yet if you ever watch boxers sparring, you will see headguards. If
they offer little protection, why are they considered necessary for
practice sessions?
The obligatory wearing of this helmet might not make a huge
difference, but if it helps at all, it should be introduced.
Or is it really the case that some in the business feel that wearing
these guards reduces the chances of spectacular knock-outs and,
therefore, the hype that helps coin in the television megabucks?

its disciplinary procedures to make the suspension -- imposed by the FA
on the Frenchman last Friday for an attack on a Crystal Palace supporter
-- apply to all football activities up to and including September 30.

SO you thought the cold war was over? That figure skating had reverted
to its traditional image of sequins and lace with the demise of Tonya
Harding? Think again.
Harding, you will recall, was the US Olympic contender implicated in a
conspiracy to have rival Nancy Kerrigan mugged with an an iron bar, the
much-hyped Battle of Wounded Knee.
The 1994 US champion admitted felony charges of hindering the
prosecution, in return for exemption from any direct charges relating to
the assault carried out by associates. Her husband and bodyguard were
both jailed.
Well, the World Figure Skating Championships are about to get under
way in Birmingham, and the US team has already arrived in England.
Harding has been frozen out, banned never to return, but her
successor, the 1995 US champion, Nicole Bobek, promises to rival her for
controversy.
Mugging, apparently, is not her line; just a bit of burglary.
For when Bobek won the US title last month in Providence, Rhode
Island, she was on probation, seeming to confirm the view that fluffy
cygnets metamorphose into ugly ducklings off the ice.
Last November, Miss Bobek, who lives in Bloomfield, Detroit, went to
the home of a fellow skater, used an electronic security code -- given
her by her friend -- to gain access.
She was subsequently discovered by her friend's father, who also
discovered Bobek to be in posession of a substantial sum of money that
had gone missing.
Under a law applying to first-time offenders which would guarantee
anonymity -- so she thought -- Bobek pled guilty and was given two
years' probation.
She was obliged to do 50 hours' community service and was subjected to
a six-month curfew: home by 6pm, or 7pm if she had skating tuition.
The charges would remain confidential and be expunged if probation was
completed without any breach of conditions. Failure would mean automatic
conviction on the initial charge.
But a circuit judge set aside these terms three weeks ago after
details of Bobek's offence were leaked to the press.
A US Figure Skating Association is ''satisfied with the way the
situation has been handled by local authorities.'' They intend taking no
further action against Bobek.
They declined to sanction any media interviews yesterday with either
Bobek or Todd Eldredge, the US men's champion.
The association insists there will be no interviews until after the
world preliminaries are conche luded on Monday.
The championships proper, at Birmingham's National Exhibition centre,
begin on Tuesday with the compulsory dance.
However, according to reports in the US media, problems appear to
follow the precocious Bobek, and are not wholly of her own making. She
has had eight different coaches in eight years, and at at least as many
home addresses.
She took up skating at the age of three, and her mother, Jana, who
fled the 1968 Czech uprising, says: ''The ice was Nicole's sandbox.''
Yet her home and childhood background was far from ideal. Nicole has
only recently discovered that her father, whom she never knew, and Jana,
were never married.
Only last year, after running away from home, did she learn that Joyce
Barron, who had lived with her and her mother since birth, was not her
aunt.
Nicole claimed she was being mis-treated -- though she was never
struck by her mother -- and social service complaints were filed by a
sponsor and a teacher.
A third complaint was even lodged on Nicole's behalf by Barron's
daughter. Because of inadequate evidence, none of the complaints was
pursued.
In the autumn of 1993, Bobek slipped a note to a close family friend,
pleading for help. ''Life is getting harder,'' it read. ''Some days I
just want to die. I need your help to get me out, or else there is no
need for me living.''
She ran away a few days later, seeking refuge with Barron's daughter,
Rochelle, who confided that Joyce was not her aunt, a discovery reported
to have shaken Nicole profoundly.
Yet Bobek has moved back with Jana and Joyce, who arranged last April
for her to be coached by Kerrigan's mentor, Evy Scotvold.
But they fell out when Scotvold said Bobek was overweight and not in
shape for the lucrative Goodwill Games. Ma Bobek took Nicole anyway --
she placed a lowly seventh -- and moved her on to a new coach, Richard
Callaghan.
Since then Nicole has gained a stylish sophistication. Even fellow
skaters, who christened her ''Brass Knuckles'' -- she wears a ring on
every finger -- and refused to room with her because of late-night
partying and tantrums, were impressed.
Her US championship success over the favourite, Michelle Kwan, 14, was
a great surprise.
Now Kwan seems fated to skate in the shadow of a troubled girl with a
precocious talent who may yet rise above the stresses to surprise us
all.

<HEADLINE>ING Group is in'exclusive'talks for Barings</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>20</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979583147</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Dutch banking and insurance giant ING Group is in exclusive talks
with administrators of Barings to buy ''substantially all of the
businesses'' of the collapsed merchant bank, it was confirmed last
night.
Analysts believe the merchant bank, whose blue chip clients include
the Queen, could be sold for just #1.
The catch -- anyone getting it for such a bargain basement price would
have to take on the bank's debts, which could total around #600m.
Banking analyst Martin Cross from brokers UBS described ING,
Internationale Nederlanden Group, as a huge institution, easily able to
afford Barings.
Administrators Ernst &amp; Young said: ''The administrators of Barings
announce that they have entered into exclusive negotiations with ING
Group of the Netherlands.
''ING intends to acquire substantially all of the businesses, assets
and liabilites of the Barings Group, including substantially all of the
Baring Brothers &amp; Co bank, Baring Securities and the Baring Asset
Management operation.''
Mr Cross said ING had no merchant banking business of its own and
would be keen to take over Barings, which would make a valuable addition
to the group as a whole.
He said it was entirely feasible for the business to be sold for a
nominal #1 and stressed it was good news for Barings' employees if the
deal with ING went through.
''As the two groups do not have any duplication of businesses, the
jobs' outlook is better than any other scenario.''
Barings employs a total of 4000 people worldwide, 2000 of them in the
City of London.
ING Group was formed in 1991 through the merger of the insurance
group, National Nederlanden and the banking group NMB-Postbank Group.
ING operates in more than 45 countries and has a market capitalisation
in excess of #8500m.
The administrators said they would make no further comment until they
had sought and obtained the direction of the High Court and have been
discharged from their appointment as administrators.
Analysts believe time is now of the essence if ING is to succeed in
its bid to buy the merchant bank. If a deal is not secured over the next
few days, the administrators are likely to seek other potential bidders
either for the group as a whole, or for its three principal businesses,
securities, fund management and corporate finance.
A deal with ING would be a major coup over its major rival Dutch bank
ABN Amro, which is also believed to be keen to take over Barings, the
UK's oldest merchant bank.
The group already owns ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, a prominent broking
house in the City of London. The addition of Barings would give it an
even greater presence in the UK and Europe.

ENGLAND will go ahead with a rematch against the Republic of Ireland
-- but only if they receive the full backing of the police and both
governments.
The Football Association have agreed ''in principle'' with their
Dublin counterparts to replay last month's friendly, which was abandoned
after a riot by English fans.
Monday, May 22 has been mooted as a possible date, but David Davies,
the FA's director of public affairs, said: ''I am not aware of anybody
who would not like the game to go ahead -- but at the right time, and
when that is has not yet been decided.''
And he admitted: ''There will be no question of going ahead with the
game without our security advisers being happy.
''We must be sure that any lessons which need to be learned from the
Dublin game have been learned and will be put into operation.''
Both associations agree with their national coaches, Terry Venables
and Jack Charlton, that a message must be sent to the thugs.
''They feel they have unfinished business,'' said Davies. ''It is
important that the flotsam and jetsam of our society should not be seen
to have succeeded in ruining a football match.''
Venables and Charlton met again yesterday, while working for
television, and the England manager said: ''We would like to put it
right again.''
Charlton said the Irish have learned their lesson and will be much
tougher next time: ''We know mistakes were made. We tried to keep a low
profile and probably that was the mistake. Wedidn't treat them as hard
as the Belgians did (in the FC Brugge v Chelsea match) on Tuesday.''
Sean Connolly, the Football Association of Ireland chief executive, is
cautious about a rematch this season and said: ''It is obvious we will
have to have deep consultation with the Garda in Dublin and the English
police as well as the Irish Rugby Football Union before anything can be
put in place.''
The IRFU own the Lansdowne Road stadium and although they have granted
the FAI a long-term lease for World Cup and European Championship
matches, they negotiate a separate deal for friendlies.

<HEADLINE>Thorn spends #36mto save Dillons chain</HEADLINE>

MUSIC and rental group Thorn EMI has bought the Dillons bookshop chain
from the receivers of the crashed Pentos group which could save up to
2500 jobs that might otherwise have been lost.
It is paying #36m cash for Dillons and Hatchards though exact details
of the deal, which was thrashed out within 48 hours of the parent
company being pushed into receivership by its banks, have still to be
finalised.
Pentos receiver KPMG said it had received 25 enquiries about the
Dillons book chain but not all were serious. Thorn EMI's offer was lower
than one by Terry Maher, who founded Pentos, but KPMG said it took Thorn
EMI's cash offer as deal could be done immediately. It was expected that
the question of leases would influence the negotiations -- some of the
Dillons stores have expensive long-term leases.
Thorn EMI, which recently closed its Rumbelows chain of electrical
retailers with the loss of 2500 jobs, is to operate Dillons and
Hatchards as a going concern under the management of the HMV group, its
specialist retailing business.
There are around 140 Dillons bookshops and it is reckoned to have 11%
of a market worth #1300m. Thorn EMI said yesterday that Dillons was a
major force in the specialist segment, with an estimated market share of
40%, and competes with Waterstone's, Blackwell's, and other specialist
book retailers.
Dillons has a particularly strong position in academic bookselling,
with a flagship store in Gower Street in London and well positioned
bookstores in 24 universities.
Commenting on the acquisition, Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn
EMI said: ''We have been looking at the UK book market with growing
interest in recent years. I am delighted that we have been able to
acquire these excellent businesses and welcome the 2500 employees of
Dillons and Hatchards to the Thorn EMI group.
The company said that despite the disruption caused by the financial
position of the The Pentos group over recent months, it is confident
that these businesses have the capability of generating good returns.
Analysts yesterday mostly welcomed the purchase as a good one for
Thorn EMI although the company's shares were down 14p at 1033p at the
close having initially fallen 23p.

THE commodity reports delivered in the afternoon session of the NFU
council in Aberdeen by the various conveners raised only minimal
reaction from the assembled delegates.
The retiring milk convener, Alex Brown, highlighted the slow manner in
which the Intervention Board were handling quota transfers and agreed
with a suggestion from the floor that Scottish dairy farmers would be
better served by having their own separate office in Edinburgh.
On hill farming John Scott pointed out that 1994 had been one of the
worst for some time for the specialist hill sheep farmer. He said:
''Average incomes are down by 24% to #8500 and this is just not
sustainable. This must be made known to the Government. The predictions
are of another difficult lambing with higher feed costs.''
Mr Scott then turned to the subject of sheep dipping: ''Only 6000
sheep farmers out of 90,000 in the UK have applied for the necessary
certification to use organo-phosphorus dips. That will pose huge welfare
problems this summer with scab on the increase.''
On animal health and welfare, George Lyon said that in spite of the
protests at the various ports, between 70% and 80% of calves which
normally would have been exported are still reaching the Continent. Mr
Lyon also said that various court actions are pending which, if
successful, would compel the port authorities to allow live exports to
continue as in the past.
The cereals convener, David Jack, raised the unresolved problem on the
level of plant breeders' royalties on home saved seed. He quoted the
probable ruling which says: ''An equitable remuneration sensibly lower
than the rate on certified seed shall be paid.''

PARTICK Thistle have installed a giant pitch cover in an attempt to
save their league game against Hearts tomorrow.
It covers a 10,000 square yards and is moved into place on inflatable
rollers. Rangers have been using an even larger, more sophisticated
cover, and a similar one to that at Ibrox is presently at Murrayfield
and it will then be moved to Hampden to protect the Sunday match between
Celtic and Aberdeen.

CLYDESDALE Bank yesterday announced the appointment of Fred Goodwin, a
partner in accountancy firm Touche Ross, as deputy chief executive.
Mr Goodwin, 36, a Glasgow University graduate who is currently chief
operating officer of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
liquidation, will join next month.
He will be responsible for banking, financial services, operations,
and marketing.
Chief executive Frank Cicutto said Mr Goodwin would bring a new
perspective and valuable experience.
Speaking from London, Mr Goodwin said: ''Whilst, for a number of
years, my work has been very much involved with banks, this is the first
time I will actually be part of the management team.
''I could not have chosen a more interesting point at which to move
into banking, both in terms of change taking place in the sector and
developments within the Clydesdale Bank itself.''

MOTHERWELL manager Alex McLeish has been let off the hook by the SFA,
being only censured for criticising officials after the cup-tie when the
Fir Parkers lost to Hibs.
Both McLeish and defender Brian Martin were outspoken in their views
that Kevin Harper had been offside when Pat McGinlay scored. But later,
after seeing a television replay, McLeish admitted it was he and his
players who were wrong and that the linesman, who had not raised his
flag, was right.
Martin was sent off for comments to the linesman, and this will be
dealt with by normal disciplinary points procedure.
McLeish and Martin had been asked to explain themselves by the SFA
General Purposes Committee yesterday.

''I NOTE, Mrs Heraghty,'' I said to Anna in my little South-Side club,
''that according to reports some classrooms at Portree High School,
Skye, are dangerous and should be closed immediately, according to a
report by local campaigners who . . .'' I tapped the counter smartly
with my silver headed-topped cane and continued. ''I seen the photies of
the school in Portree, Skye, and you would stay in the mainland rather
than going over the sea to find yourself in Portree High School.''
Portree High School isn't just dangerous to the health of the wee
teuchters, it is dangerous to the eyesight and the all-round aesthetics
of Gaeldom. The school in Skye looks like a cribbage board designed in
concrete by Sir Basil Spence after a night out with Billy Fullerton in
Brigton. You have to be old to remember a vandal like Sir Basil Spence
to remember that reference. Skye is perhaps one of the most romantic
spots of Scotland: the song says much for the romance. The Portree High
School says even more for architects. You should see Fort William.
Set in the most magnificent, well, setting, overlooked by the highest
mountain in Britain, Ben Nevis, Fort William possesses the sort of
buildings which only architects could think up. They are square and
oblong, and sparse and brutalist, and flat-roofed, and dancing with
dampness and, once, asbestos. They have as much Highland charm as the
last bell in the bar with a lassie from Doncaster telling you it and a
hotelier asking you not to turn up to his country house concentration
camp but send a cheque.
Fort William was designed originally by the English scum who set about
the Highland people. They managed that efficiently, nae bother, but some
of the Scots continued to stay in what was after all their native heath.
And then the architects came with their fancy ways, and if it was up to
them they would have put a flat roof on Ben Nevis itself, and a wee dose
of the Bauhaus on Gaeldom itself. Given half a chance the sixties and
seventies planners and architects would have verbs and nouns and
adverbial clauses turned into circles, squares, and triangles.
THEY certainly turned their buildings into such primitive shapes.
Portree High School is the very image of a DHSS office and the new
bridge will be the last straw.
And yet the locals allow this nonsense of an architecture in their own
landscape. They most certainly permit a wee interior landscape. One in
which they allow all that money going to Gaelic speaking, (don't
criticise me on what I have just written; write to my Gaelic tutor,
Maggie frae Lewis). But look at the internal architecture of what
happens to this country and especially to the Western Isles. It actually
starts with what the bloody schools look like.
The curriculum of schools, the further education system, the Scottish
notion of politics in the post-war years. Religion and Education has
stuck on the same New Brutalism, and the same aesthetics. Scottish Law,
being happily conducted almost entirely through the black gauze of gown
and tradition, has not yet been redesigned by such builders of Progress.
Let us go back a bit. The school in which I was tormented for many a
year as a teacher, out in Toryglen in Glasgow, was razed to the ground
last summer. More's the pity that most of the pupils, former and
otherwise and teachers too, and councillors, and politicians, and
architects and planners and all the rest, could not have been immolated
thus.
Not a mile away lies the old building of the old Queen's Park
Secondary School. Still surviving, yet resplendent. Late Victorian
indeed. The buildings are, as they say, in perfect nick. So once, was
the educational and political, and social system, needing the odd flick
of paint and a new staff from time to time. Well, I would say that: I've
been new staff and new paint myself often enough. Part of that was
recognising how good the old one was.
Some years back a lot of schools were closed, many because they were
old buildings. Really because they held traditions thought to be
out-of-date, prefects or school uniforms or Latin or good exam results.
The times are different now, even if Skye doesn't know it.
You can teach in a Nissen hut and the Skye School is a metaphor for
that curious notion that culture relies on newness. And ugliness. For if
there is one notion concerning the absurd argument about Portree School
being dangerous: ugly is truly Dangerous and never takes the bad look
off the appalling reality it creates.

FOOTBALL'S ruling body has asked that the question of video evidence
be discussed when the International Board meets at Turnberry this
weekend.
The FIFA move stems directly from a decision in Germany last season,
when a Bundeslige clash between Bayern Munich and Nuremberg was ordered
to be replayed after video evidence showed a Bayern goal had been
wrongly awarded.
Cameras proved the ball had not crossed the line; there was huge
public controversy and massive demands for action.
The German FA agreed, the game was replayed, and Bayern won again.
Now FIFA want to tidy up the whole question, with the International
Board, as always, the final judges.
However, SFA chief executive Jim Farry suggested yesterday that it was
unlikely there would be any change. ''We see the referee as the man
whose decision must be final. It is unlikely there would be any
widespread acceptance of video evidence.''
Last night Farry's view received the support of the German FA. A
spokesman at their Frankfurt headquarters said: ''The association was
forced into the decision by public demand. There was a loophole in the
regulations which said that, if a referee had made a serious mistake,
the association could act.
''That is what they did. But it was never the idea to accept video
evidence in every game. That would be impossible.
''In any case, there is no certainty that every game would be filmed,
so there can be no blanket decision.''
The top brass will be at Turnberry. FIFA President Joao Havelange and
General Secretary Sepp Blatter arrive today to join representatives of
the four home associations.
The Scots have two motions: to clear up the offside law by describing
players involved ''in active play,'' and to ask for designated markings
for the technical area.
FIFA also want discussions on timeouts that would allow coaches to
stop games for two to three-minute spells for tactical changes. There is
opposition -- a coach could halt a game to disturb the opposition's
rhythm.

MY basic instinct and values lie in that a united and peaceful front
develops strengths and progress.
I am not talking about the Irish situation but Scotland's position
with England and the UK.
For years being a business and travelled person I have pondered the
uniqueness of Scotland but have preferred the shelter of the UK with its
umbrella of comfort that being part of a small eccentric island has.
It is not that my basic instinct has altered, just woken to a new and
exciting prospect of joining a much bigger community but fighting for
our own needs within that framework.
Does Scotland going solo in Europe appeal to other members of the

THE Prime Minister's speech in Glasgow once again demonstrated his
lack of knowledge of the history of the home rule movement in Scotland
as well as his continuing failure to take any real notice of the
dissatisfaction a great many of the electorate here have with his
Government.
I wonder, for example, if he has ever read or has had drawn to his
attention the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution
(1969-1973).
It did not just deal with the then surge for nationalism in Scotland
and Wales but gave pride of place to a conclusion that many of the
complaints received by the commission originated from concern about the
concentration of government in London.
Indeed this view was expressed in a Great Britain context and not
simply about feelings in Scotland or Wales. One of the main complaints
about centralisation was the absence of a regional voice in determining
the allocation of public expenditure to and within the regions.
Mr Major has also failed to understand the crucial difference between
the proposal for devolution within the United Kingdom -- as advocated by
the Labour Party -- and so-called independence in Europe as supported by
the SNP.
There is already in place a substantial amount of administrative
devolution at the Scottish Office and what is required is in effect a
Scottish voice -- democratically elected -- to determine the allocation
of public expenditure.
A Scottish assembly, far from weakening the Union, could be a means of
strengthening it and making it work more efficiently.
Nothing would be gained in my opinion by trying to unscramble the UK
economy at a time when now and in the future the European Union and its
single market are going to be the means by which continuing prosperity
and peaceful association can be assured for the people of all the
countries involved.

AM I the only person in the United Kingdom to see no logic in the
so-called West Lothian question?
If and when a Scottish parliament is set up there will still be a wide
range of important UK questions to be settled by the Westminster
Parliament; and if we have the right number of Scottish MPs at the
moment to consider these questions, then why should that not continue to
be the case?
As to purely English questions, these do not need a reduced number of
Scottish MPs to consider them as non-English MPs should not be playing
any part in them.
If English regions are not set up, then existing English MPs at
Westminster will no doubt have a heavier workload than the Scottish MPs
there, and some changes in remuneration might well be justified. But why
should there be any question of any change in numbers for this reason?
Although this would on the whole seem unlikely, is it just possible
that a belated appreciation of all this by Mr Major lies behind the fact
that no alteration is proposed in the present Irish representation at
Westminster should a new parliament be set up at Stormont?

SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric, on course to double its market share in
England and Wales by the end of this year, this week invested #20m in a
joint venture power plant in Cumbria.
The Perth-based utility has purchased 50% of Fellside Heat &amp; Power, a
partnership with British Nuclear Fuels, following the successful
commissioning of its combined heat and power plant.
BNFL's Sellafield operation will be supplied with electricity and
steam from the 168-megawatt gas-fired plant, leaving about 100MW of
electricity for sale by Hydro-Electric to its customers in England and
Wales.
Contracts for the sale of nearly all of this power have been secured
for the next several years.
With the likely advent of a 680MW combined cycle gas turbine plant
towards the end of this year, a 50/50 joint venture with Norweb,
Hydro-Electric is on course to double its market share south of the
Border from 1% to 2%.
The company is committed to defending and developing its North of
Scotland business and to expanding in England and Wales, where it
believes it is achieving ''very significant'' growth.
Chief executive Roger Young said: ''Fellside is a major project which
fits this plan well.''
Hydro-Electric has now committed #66m to combined heat and power
plants, which allow it to reap benefits from sales of surplus
electricity, once its partner in the specific project has been supplied
with the steam to run its plant.
A 9MW power plant at printing, paper and packaging giant Arjo Wiggins
Appleton's Dover operation was successfully commissioned last year.
Another two, at Salt Union in Runcorn and East Lancs Paper Mill in
Radcliffe, are due to come into production next year.

DAVID BELL asks to be forgiven for being dense because he ''thought we
joined the EU years ago'' (February 25). Well I am sorry to have to say
that he must indeed be dense if he thinks that. The truth is, we never
joined the EU.
We joined the European Economic Community which was promoted with the
idea that countries dependent economically on each other would be less
likely to fight wars. The name was subsequently shortened to the EEC and
continued as such for a number of years.
Then, without any apparent discussion, it became the EC, the European
Community. Although the economic ideals were still to be seen there was
an additional purpose being floated.
That in some unexplained way we could, in the future, all be members
of Europe as a political group, speaking with the one voice, if not in
the one language. Tell that to the former Yugoslavians.
From there the move towards more closely integrated union gathered
pace, not being spoken of openly but in coded language which sought to
conceal the true purpose of the unelected officials. And so the European
Union was born, or more correctly substituted for the EEC/EC.
David Bell is also wrong when he suggests that anti-Europeans are all
nationalists. While some may be, the rest of us have a basic problem
with the EU which is nothing to do with nationalism.
We never joined the EU and if the original reasons put forward for
joining had been anything like the current ideas for integrated
centralised government, burgeoning bureaucracy, and unelected bodies
legislating on everything from the types of cheeses which can be
produced to the curve in bananas, it would have been laughed out of
court.
However, what has happened is that we now find ourselves members of an
organisation which is passing laws affecting everything in our daily
lives, and at the same time anyone who asks questions is labelled some
kind of lunatic.
The electorate of Britain has no say in the day-to-day running of the
EU. British MPs can say little about what they feel for fear of being
labelled as disruptive, and the Government is unable to give any sort of
lead because its every move concerning Europe is examined for the
slightest hint of doubt.
Such doubts are immediately seized upon by both the opposition parties
and the media, the result being that fundamental changes to the way
decisions are reached concerning all aspects of our lives are being made
with no real debate or consideration of the effect on us all in the
future.
What on earth are we to expect of a ''state'' run by unelected
officials representing 12 or more countries which have different
languages and cultures? Sadly I can see nothing but disaster coming for
us all unless this runaway juggernaut is brought to a halt.

THE locals call it KK. The first early-morning account of the escape
route of Nick Leeson called it ''a resort on the island of Borneo'',
which made Kota Kinabalu sound slow and secretive; a tropical hideway, a
beachcomber's nirvana.
It is hardly that. Kota Kinabalu is the principal town of the
Malaysian province of Sabah, which shares the island of Borneo with
Sarawak, Brunei, and Indonesia's Kalimantan. KK is a pleasant, modern
city with a Hyatt hotel and an international airport. There Nick Leeson
came down to earth and booked himself and his wife on a Royal Brunei
Airlines flight to Frankfurt.
Like Leeson, Kota Kinabalu has had its ups and downs. It was razed to
the ground during the last war to prevent the Japanese using it as a
base, and the experience wasn't new. In earlier centuries KK was burned
down so often it became known as Api Api, which means Fire Fire. The
region was notorious for its arsonist-pirates.
In Kota Kinabalu a modern pirate learns that there are no tropical
hideways. The buccaneer's bolt hole is a thing of the past. The would-be
master of the universal money markets discovers you can run but you
can't hide. He who lives by the wizardry of information technology is
also betrayed by it. The fugitive is only as free as his independence of
airline computers and credit cards.
It's been high season for runaways, for short-term respite on planes
and boats and trains. Tickets to anywhere may be tickets to nowhere but
they have their own logic: travel deadens the mind. It liberates the
imagination from its most crushing anxieties. Time spent travelling,
actually in motion, 30,000 feet in the air or 100mph along the ground,
is stolen time. It's a fair bet that Nick Leeson and his wife found
their last hours of calm in the belly of their intercontinental jet,
flying into the sunset above the Arabian Sea.
Travelling solves nothing, but postpones everything. What choices face
the stricken thespian beneath the parapluies of Cherbourg? If he keeps
on moving, he won't have to think about them. What decisions await the
truanting schoolboy and the fleeing banker in the luxury lobbies of
Kuala Lumpur? They are gone with the whim before they have to make them.
But the fanciful flights of the Leesons, the Frys, and the young Peter
Kerrys touch something sweet in our own flights of fancy. It isn't only
those who spill spaghetti, lose millions, or take stage fright who dream
of leaving. We may live in Kansas, but we know there's another country
on the other side of the rainbow.
I love the smell of high-octane fuel in the morning, the sad salute of
the long-distance train at night. When the ferry fizzes at its berth I
want to join the seagulls on its superstructure. The country on the
other side of the rainbow doesn't exist, but the great escape lies in
trying to get there.
What is the fugitive need that drives the dreamer-traveller? Not by
any means the quest for happiness, or even a release from routine, which
roots us in realities which may be quite contented. Naturally it's nice
to break the pattern of our working and domestic lives and put all their
responsibilities on hold. But it's my theory that travelling relieves
more than the daily grind. It offers an illusion of immortality.
Time spent travelling feels like time stolen from the grave. I
sometimes think of danger when I'm travelling -- the in-flight
emergency, the careering taxi with the gung-ho driver, the flash flood,
and the short-sighted freedom fighter -- but I never think of death. I
feel, rather, as if I've extended my life; as if time can't catch up
with me as long as I'm on the move.
Think about it. Once there was the horse and the stagecoach, and most
people didn't live nearly as long as they do today. The coming of the
railways not only gave us landscape as entertainment but freed us from
our fixed position on it. The movement of large numbers of people around
the world accelerated with the aviation industry, and -- as you might
expect -- our most intense experience of detachment from our place on
the planet comes in the air.
With relocation there is also the chance of disembodiment. Nadime
Gordimer's novel The Conservationist has the best description of the
out-of-body, out-of-time, out-of-place experience of air travel I've
ever read. The episode is also erotic. In the middle of the night,
without a word being exchanged, Gordimer's middle-aged executive
traveller commits a delicate sexual assault on a young Portuguese girl
in the neighbouring seat.
Beneath the airline blanket the girl encourages his hand between her
thighs in ''an hour between the hour of Europe and the hour of Africa,
not registered on any watch glowing on passengers' wrists in the quiet
dark . . . She need not be afraid of wanting what was happening because
it was happening nowhere''. Which of us, wakening beside strangers who
have shared our sleep in a 747, haven't glimpsed the possibility of
encounters which carry no moral baggage because they ''happen nowhere''?
The famous fly from fame, the child flies from disappointment, the
foolish or the criminal fly from retribution. The rest of us fly from
ourselves, if only briefly, and return to continue the business of
slicing the bread and spreading the jam as if we'd never been away;
refreshed and extended, none the less, as if we'd put years on our
lives.
For those who keep on running, the world holds fewer and fewer hiding
places. ''Can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train,'' goes
the Dylan lyric. In America they built highways, called ''freeways'',
that seemed to go on forever, symbols of the existential journey, and
invented the road movie. But sooner or later, like Thelma and Louise,
the traveller with the open ticket is going to run up against the Grand
Canyon.

WITH all the recent furore regarding the building of new roads surely
the time has come for a radical rethink.
In recent years I have noticed that during school holidays the roads
are relatively free of congestion in the mornings, leading to a
stress-free drive to work. With this in mind perhaps there is a case for
banning all teachers from driving on a permanent basis.
The benefits to decent members of society would be enormous; teachers
would no longer have to go to the expense of buying and maintaining a
car (they are always complaining about being poorly paid anyway); the
revenue generated by public transport would, as a result, increase, and,
most importantly, the roads would be left clear for those of us with
real jobs to go to.

MURRAY International Trust, which was badly burned in Hong Kong and
Malaysia, underperformed its benchmark indices in the year to December.
After an index-beating 36.4% total return in 1993, a negative figure
of 9.8% for 1994 compared poorly with lesser ones of 5.1% and 5.8% in
the FTSE World ex Japan and All-Share indices.
The Glasgow-based investment trust suffered a 13.7% fall in net asset
value to 329.7p during the 12 months. This compared with a capital
decline in the World ex Japan index of only 7.7%.
However, the #516m Murray Johnstone-managed fund declared a higher
final dividend of 3.9p, increasing the total dividend by 3.4% to 12.0p.
The trust, which aims for a high and growing income with capital
growth through investment principally in UK, continental European, North
American, and Far Eastern and Australian equities, will pay an interim
dividend of 8.7p in 1995, up 7.4%.
Murray International's equity holdings in the Far East and Australia,
which accounted for #71.1m of the fund at the beginning of the year,
lost #19.0m in value, in spite of #7.6m worth of disinvestment.
The greatest damage came in Hong Kong and Malaysia, where markets fell
by 35% and 22% respectively.
Underlying the general setback, according to trust manager David
Briggs, was the worst European bond market for 40 years and for many
years in other parts of the world. This situation also severely dented

REFERENCE is regularly made nowadays to the ''rights of the
individual'' and to ''human rights''. Whatever these may be, they are
apparently popular concepts.
Against the trend I resurrect the following for dispassionate
consideration: ''Matthew Arnold once said that if he merely searched his
own consciousness he found that he had no idea of having rights but only
of having duties.
''He meant to convey that the idea of rights is essentially
artificial, something that social habit has conditioned men to look for;
but that the deepest part of a man -- the real function of his being --
expresses itself in recognising duties rather than in claiming rights
(The Reith Lectures, 1951; The Individual and the State -- Lord
Radcliffe).
The above is perhaps unlikely to diminish the popularity of ''rights''
but some readers, I hope, may think about it.

WITH a helpful contribution from Scottish Mutual, Abbey National had a
strong year in 1994, with profits up almost a third and shareholders
rewarded with a 27% jump in the dividend.
Sharply lower bad debts and a jump in profits from the life insurance
business pushed up profits from #704m to #932m, and the group is set to
break the #1000m barrier this year.
The final dividend of 12.05 raises the total from 14p to 17.75p.
Chairman Lord Tugendhat declared that they could sustain strong dividend
growth in 1995 and beyond.
Abbey has a tenuous link with the Barings crash because of a
derivatives operation it has jointly with Barings. However Abbey
chairman Lord Tugendhat stressed at a briefing yesterday that the 1994
results were unaffected by the crash. The business is UK based and is
not a proprietary trader and has tight trading limits. Abbey would now
exercise its right to take over the whole management of the business,
which is continuing to operate normally.
The mortgage market was flat last year but Abbey raised its share of
new loans to 18% as a result of the purchase of the mortgage book of
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and of centralised lender HMC.
Profits from the mortgage business were boosted by a fall in bad debt
provisions from #119m to #44m in the UK, representing 1.4% of the loan
book, against 2.4%, and in the Continental operations from #99m to #30m.
The number of houses repossessed fell by over a third to 3000.
Pressure was maintained on costs with the cost/income ratio down from
44.5% to 42.9%, which showed, as Lord Tugendhat pointed out, progress
towards the goal of 40% by 1997. Though the group net interest margin
slipped a little to 1.73%, the retail spread was kept at 2.1%, despite
the conflicting needs of keeping mortgage rates a down and returns to
savers up.
Abbey sees confidence returning gradually to the housing market but
mortgages appear unlikely to be the growth market they have been in the
past. So Abbey is not surprisingly keen to expand rapidly elsewhere. On
flotation in 1989 it was almost exclusively a mortgage and savings
business. With the greater flexibility plc status gave the group now a
quarter of profits come from treasury and life activities. The ambition
is to build this proportion to 40% in 1997 and the range of financial
products is being expanded rapidly to this end.
The purchase of Scottish Mutual was a major step in this direction and
it appears to have settled in well. Lord Tugendhat attributed its
success to good product design, cost efficiency and strong links with
financial advisers. Together with Abbey National Life it made a
contribution of #94m.
During the year Scottish Mutual relocated into a single office in
Glasgow. It also had additional costs in adapting systems to the new
full disclosure regime which took effect at the beginning of 1995.
The purchase of Pegasus Assurance added critical illness and
healthcare to the product list and Abbey National has recently entered
the unit trust market. On target for launch in mid-1995 is a general
insurance operation in a joint venture with Commercial Union. Finally
three small acquisitions have extended the independent financial advice
arm.
All the services will now be marketed more vigorously to Abbey's
10,000,000 customer base, though on a targeted basis. The scope for
cross-selling has barely been touched yet so there is clearly enormous
potential. It is clearly the correct strategy for Abbey to follow, the
only criticism being that it could have begun the process earlier.
Competition is hotting up rapidly and many competitors already have most
of these products available. Still Abbey has a better reputation among
consumers than the conventional banks and the insurance groups remain
tarnished by the pensions mis-selling scandal.
The marketing strategy will be enhanced by the near completion of the
branch modernisation programme which has tripled the amount of
floorspace available for servicing customers. The mortgage by phone
operation, Abbey National Direct, has extended its range into life
assurance and unsecured loans.

THERE seems little doubt that Wimpey is determined to be a major
player in the highly desireable consolidation of the UK construction
industry which staggers along with operating margins hovering around
breakeven and with little light upon the horizon as regards an upturn in
activity. Indeed the opposite is true with the sky becoming blacker.
Britain's biggest housebuilder has the advantage of a powerful balance
sheet, bank facilities of #350m and a reasonably good international
exposure in high technology design and build. It was this skill asset
which enabled it to win the #53m contract for the M77 two year
construction programme and at a price about #5m below the nearest
competing tender.
The security costs are built into the contract with the authorities
picking up part of the bill above a certain but undisclosed level. And
Wimpey is obviously hoping that the protestors' use of children in the
demonstrations will backfire in terms of public opinion.
Group pre-tax profits last year increased 77% to #45.1m boosted by a
#3.4m surplus on the sale of the Wimpol subsidiary.
The best performance came from housebuilding where UK operating
profits jumped 75% to #46.2m. A total of 7672 units were sold compared
with the 1993 total of 8134 sales. However the change in mix towards the
private sector resulted in an overall #2000 rise in average selling
prices to #59,000 with margins moving up to 10.2%.
In Scotland where Wimpey remains the clear market leader, average
prices were #100 lower at #57,000 with a 209 rise in units sold to 1643
with the revenue decrease because of the higher proportion of social
housing where margins are lower than on private development but with a
better return on capital employed.
Wimpey chief executive Joe Dwyer is expecting overall UK house prices
to move in line with inflation with the second half of the year to make
good what has been a disappointing first two months. He added that the
possible introduction of Vat on new houses after 1996, as has been
rumoured, could result in lower land prices.
The core construction side saw overseas profits offsetting UK losses
which were struck after some #7.45m of interest receipts arising from
the division financing other group activities offset in part by #4.5m of
rationalisation costs as the workforce shrunk by 400 or so or 8%. The
order book is litte changed at #595m with the activities in the Gulf in
particular the buttress until the UK private finance initiatives,
particularly in hospitals, begin to taske off.
Minerals saw good performances across the board and will be further
boosted by the recent #43.5m acquisition of the Alfred McAlpine quarries
in the Central Belt, Midlands and Wales which replicate the existing
Wimpey operations and so are ripe for rationalisation with perhaps 100
staff lilkey to be made redundant at a cost of #1.5m. There should be a
much stronger contribution from the US this year which suffered from bad
spring weather in 1994.
Wimpey has decided to defer clawing back any of the #20m provisions
made against the Channel Tunnel until the Eurotunnel revenue stream
becomes more assured.
The dividend total has been increased marginally to 5.5p which puts
the shares at 118p on a 5.8% yield. Current year profits could reach
#60m which would mean the shares are trading at around 10[1/2] times
likely earnings -- a strong hold. The shares fell 2p to 118p.

WHEN he retires at the AGM later this year Sir Denys Henderson will be
able to go with clear evidence that Zeneca, the bioscience division of
ICI demerged two years ago, is on a healthy growth path.
It could get bigger even more quickly if City rumours are to be
believed. Zeneca has consistently been mentioned as a possible ''white
knight'' for Wellcome, which has until next Wednesday, the first closing
date, to rebuff Glaxo's hostile #9000m bid. John Robb, chairman and
chief executive of Wellcome, continues to believe that any rival bidder
would wait until the last moment before making itself known.
Zeneca's board refused to comment on the bid speculation. Chief
executive David Barnes said a good new product flow was an absolute
requirement for any successful pharmaceutical company these days.
He added that those companies most at risk were the ones who were
experiencing slower growth. He said he was ''very confident we can
continue independently'' given that the group had critical mass and was
broadly based geographically.
Zeneca's annual results published yesterday would appear to give
grounds for optimism. Last year, the company made a pre-tax profit of
#659m, an increase of 4%. Profits would have been higher were it not for
an exceptional #104m charge. This resulted from #138m of provisions to
cover further restructuring in both agrochemicals and specialties offset
by profits on disposals of #34m.
Underlying sales grew by 4% although volume growth in agrochemicals
and specialties slowed down in the second half. Spending on research and
development held steady at #518m with a similar sum expected for the
current year.
Newer drugs such as the heart drug Zestril and Zoladex for breast
cancer, accounted for half the pharmaceutical division's sales, helping
to offset some of the decline in sales of older products such as the
beta-blocker Tenormin, which no longer has patent protection.
Zeneca is keeping up with the changing nature of the US healthcare
market. In December it announced the proposed acquisition of 50% of
Salick Healthcare, a leading provider of cancer treatment.
Almost half the 14% increase in the group's trading profit came from
agrochemicals and specialties. The agrochemicals division had an
excellent year, benefiting from new product launches in America and
recovery in demand in many of its European markets. However, sales to
Eastern Europe, particularly the CIS were down on 1993, due to lack of
secure finance available to potential customers.
Parts of the specialties division continue to give cause for concern.
Cotton crop failures and an increasingly competitive pricing environment
adversely affected sales in the textile colours business. Industrial
colours, however, benefited from strong sales to the paints and plastics
industries and, in particular, the US car industry.
Zeneca's balance sheet is very robust. Since demerger it has repaid
all the net debt taken on at the time. Gearing reduced to just 0.3% from
12.5% in 1993. There is a final dividend of 17.75p making a total for
the year of 28.5p.
For 1995, City analysts are looking for profits of about #850m. The
shares have been a favorite of healthcare analysts for some time because
of the company's earnings growth potential relative to others in the
sector, not least in emerging markets in Latin America and in the
Asia/Pacific region.
The presence of the agrochemicals and specialties division in the
group helps to offset some of the downward pressure on pharmaceutical
margins exerted by reforms in major healthcare markets.
However, yesterday Zeneca shares dropped 13p to 867p where they yield
4.1%.

''BEING homeless, presumably, is held to be a vice,'' says John
Linklater amid several non sequiturs and before going on to confuse
Agape with Eros (February 25).
''Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests,'' said Jesus,
according to the Bible, ''but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his
head'' (Matt 8:20).
The introduction to Linklater's article refers to ''the harsh and
humourless realities of virtue''. The Bible says that God ''richly
provides us with everything for our enjoyment'' (1 Tim 6:17). Linklater
says that faith doesn't encourage questions. The Bible says, ''Test
everything'' (1 Thess 5:21).
''God moved in mysterious ways when he created an imperfect world,''
says Linklater. The Bible claims that the world was once perfect.
Linklater says, ''most of the virtues are about preaching
conformities''. The Bible says, ''Don't conform any longer to the
pattern of this world'' (Rom 12:2).
The Bible does say, ''eye for eye, tooth for tooth''; this rule
determined the legal penalty for an Israelite who maliciously fabricated
false accusations against someone. The judges were to give the liar
whatever sentence he had tried to bring upon the accused (Deut
19:16-21). Jesus emphasised that this was not intended to permit
retaliation (Matt 5:38-39).
Linklater says that, ''the Bible only talks about vengeance,
retribution, and The Last Judgment''. In fact the Old Testament
described God as ''the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger,
abounding in love and faithfulness'' (Ex 34:6).
And, ''we can't escape the rap'' (eternal damnation), claims John
Linklater, while the Bible speaks about God's forgiveness in ''only''
about 60 different places.

FOURTEEN-year-old Peter Kerry pockets his Dad's plastic card and
passport and jets off to Malaysia after a family row over spilt
spaghetti. Next door, in Singapore, the slightly older Nick Leeson, 28,
waves around the equivalent of his employer's plastic with fevered
abandon, runs up a towering exposure to futures contracts based on
movements in the Nikkei 225 index, gets it spectacularly wrong, and
skedaddles.
Safely back home in Harrow, Peter says his ambition is to become an
airline pilot. Nick may not be home in Watford for a while. But after
putting his employer, the blue-blood Barings merchant bank, right out of
business through his exploits, it's hard to see what trick Leeson could
possibly pull in future to trump that one.
One of the few advantages of being on the receiving end of the first
editions of London-based papers like the FT this far out in the UK
sticks, is the chance it occasionally affords to see just how fallible
organs like the Pink 'Un can be, when trying to get to grips with a
running story.
''Bank decides a rescue is the only option,'' Monday's FT told us,
hours after Barings had been placed in administrative receivership. The
alternative, the story warned, would have been a gamble with the common
sense of the world's financial markets. Rejection of rescue could have
triggered ''enormously destabilising effects'' in these same markets.
In Monday's early-edition Guardian, Will Hutton was warning that we
the public would have to pay for the rescue. ''Markets where there are
telephone salaries must remain unimpaired, but governments must pick up
the pieces if things go wrong,'' he wrote. Elsewhere the Guardian was
warning of a banking crisis unfolding right around the globe.
In the event there was no publicly-funded rescue for Barings. Nor did
the global financial ''house of cards'' (Hutton again) fall to pieces.
By Tuesday even the Guardian's economics editor was conceding: ''It is
probable that the crisis will be weathered with only minor financial
knock-on effects''.
There was no rescue. Nor should there have been one. Innocent
depositors, including local authorities, may lose money. Pensioners and
would-be pensioners with funds under management at Barings may be hit,
to the extent that any invested cash in their portfolios was deposited
with Barings' own banking side. Charities benefiting from the Baring
Foundation's annual distribution of some #14m may also suffer.
But -- if we are to bring some sanity back into trading in some of the
more esoteric financial instruments now deployed by late
twentieth-century capitalism in pursuit of quick mega-profits -- Barings
had to pay the full price of getting way out of its depth in a market
based on pure myth.
That myth is a stunning one. It is that, by gambling in increasingly
complex ways on a future none of us, not even the most super-confident
Barings trader, can possibly know to any degree of precision, banks and
others can actually reduce the risks that that unknowable future
inevitably holds.
So-called derivatives markets are not new. Futures markets in
commodities like coffee, oranges, even those legendary pork bellies,
have been around as long as traders anxious to secure adequate supplies
of future crops. International companies and financial institutions have
long attempted to hedge their exchange-rate risks.
These are all gambles, even necessary gambles. But investing in
straightforward equities or bonds, unit trusts or investment trusts is a
gamble too. Like the betting-shop punter, trying to chose between the
respective merits of Desperate Dan or Sizzling Suzy in the 3.30 at
Chepstow, you can try to bring some science to the decision, studying
form, reading tip sheets, checking the ground conditions. At the end of
the day, each choice still involves a gamble with the unknown.
The newer derivatives, which started with options on the price of
specific shares at specified future dates and now extend to
steeply-leveraged futures contracts based on predicting movements in
entire stock-market indices or complex interactions of interest and
currency rates, are beyond the wit of most of us.
They take us, in horse-racing parlance, from trebles or roll-ups to
predicting every winner in a card which won't be run for another three
or six months. The difference is that, although the rewards for getting
it right are commensurately greater, the penalties for getting it wrong
stretch far, far beyond your initial stake.
And yet, 24 hours after seeing the bank he chaired ruined by such
speculative trading, Peter Baring could tell the FT that Barings'
derivatives operation in Singapore had been, in principle, a low-risk
business. ''We could hedge contracts simultaneously, leaving the bank
with a minimum exposure to market movements,'' he told his interviewers.
Fine, no doubt, as long as Nick Leeson was trading it right and
earning huge profits for his employer and million-dollar bonuses for
himself. But not even kingpin Nick could hedge the impact of the Kobe
earthquake on the Nikkei index.
The kind of derivative which extinguished Barings in one weekend isn't
just a lethal weapon which, in the hands of a loosely-supervised,
over-ambitious trader or even a confirmed fraudster can land the
equivalent of a nuclear strike on the unwary. Such arcane instruments
also pose a profound threat to what some of us thought the real point of
markets to be -- to raise capital for the real economy by offering the
prospect of profitable returns to investors.
Betting on where the Nikkei, the FTSE, or the Dow will be next week,
next month, or next year has about as much to do with real investment as
buying a Lottery ticket. If Barings's demise cuts the more exotic
derivatives markets down to size, those who have lost money in this
sorry affair can, perhaps, garner a little comfort. The rest of us will
owe them a substantial debt of gratitude.

DR J D DUNCAN writes on poverty, stress, and health (February 22).
People talk all sorts of nonsense about stress, even telling us that
stress is good for us. We all need to achieve in our lives and if the
challenge involves both physical and intellectual effort then so much
the better, such stress is health promoting.
However, the type of stress which can lead to ill health and premature
death is best defined as ''adverse environmental circumstances which are
beyond the individual's ability to control''.
It is true that, given both the demands and the neglect of the modern
economy, this damaging type of stress is common at all levels of
society; one man may be unable to cope with the demands of his work and
another with the fact that he has no work.
For the man in work, however, the day eventually ends and he can then
engage in some form of activity which will, to an extent, relieve his
stress.
Obviously the more affluent the individual the greater are his
options. For the unemployed and poor there are no such options and the
stressful day doesn't end, it turns into a week and the weeks into
months and eventually hopelessness and despair prevails. And it is this,
according to stress guru Hans Selye, which eventually kills.
Given a life full of manageable challenge the human body and mind are
wonderfully resilient and can cope with considerable abuse, but even
animals, when they are denied the means to perform, sicken and die.
Considering that all this is fairly well known I find it strange that
there is any debate about it, unless of course some find the truth an
embarrassment or are trying to cover up the sins of our politicians.

IT seems rather unfair that Jack Webster's recent article should be
headed ''In a world where God is an optional extra'' without considering
the world in which God is the main course for many and everything else
is an optional extra (February 27).
The days of Stanley Mair in Netherlee were also the great days of Tom
Allan in St George's Tron and half-a-dozen other outstanding preachers
in Glasgow could boast crowded congregations. Allan did not take on
Crossmyloof but nevertheless packed the Tron every Saturday evening as
well as Sundays with his Tell Scotland rallies.
These Saturday evening meetings have long since gone but the Tron
Church continues in the best of health with full congregations twice on
a Sunday and no depletion in membership since the Tom Allan days, thanks
to his successor George Duncan and the present incumbent Eric Alexander.
The secret of success of churches like the Tron is that they preach
the Gospel. I mean they preach the evangelical Gospel, the good news of
Jesus Christ crucified and risen in power, the old-fashioned Gospel that
Jack Webster's grandfather upheld; and the church generally would be in
a healthier state, in my opinion, if that were the case in all churches.
The ''take it or leave it'' attitude which Jack Webster rightly
describes as characteristic of our day is pitiful to behold. The plain
fact is that society today has to persuade itself that it is happy. The
psychiatric wards are full of patients guiltily conscious of having
failed to be happy.
Happiness in Scandinavia (that happy peninsula far away) often seems
to have fallen out of the window. Hemingway's happiness was a bullet
fired into his brain. The happy-go-lucky, almost tranquil experience of
walking through Jack Webster's Glasgow of 30 or 40 years ago is hard to
discover today.
The very expressions on people's faces as one strides along
Sauchiehall Street or Argyle Street is very different from the
expressions one would have found on the faces of Glaswegians of a
by-gone age. People today are miserable looking, not because of true,
dynamic religion, but for lack of it.
I've no doubt Jack Webster would agree that the biggest hypocrites are
those church people who, like himself, only use the church when it suits
them on special occasions. Such people must not be surprised if, in the
final day, God makes them an optional extra. Some of my less charitable
colleagues would say such hypocrites will not be in the reckoning at
all.
That there are still packed churches here and there filled with young
people Sunday after Sunday proves that the Gospel has lost none of its
attraction. There is no secret to packed churches. No gimmicks are
needed. The Gospel just needs to be preached with evangelical zeal and
power. Far better to make God everything than to ''use'' Him as an
optional extra.

I MUST confess to some apprehension about the new morality test for
prospective public representatives: ''What were you doing, and with whom
were you doing it, 18 years ago?'' (If extra space required, please
continue overleaf.) This is the kind of inquisition which could leave us
with Andrew Welsh as Prime Minister of Saor Alba by default, on the
grounds that nobody else is eligible. Mr Welsh and Madame Ewing make a
most unlikely pairing -- in the most innocent possible way -- as moral
policepersons.
However, I don't expect the inquisition to spread. Whatever
indiscretions Alex Salmond might or might not have committed in the
cloisters of St Andrew's on a mid-seventies summer evening will continue
to be of no interest at all to the Star Chamber of Nationalism. There
are three reasons for this: he is not a woman, he is not a republican,
and no member of the Ewing dynasty (past, present or putative) was
involved. Roseanna Cunningham, on the other hand, was caught in all
three traps. She had to go.
I hope that whoever emerges as Nationalist candidate in Perth and
Kinross is subjected to the same treatment as Ms Cunningham. He -- for,
of course, it will be a he -- must never have had an affair. And, of
course, anyone who has inhaled will be automatically disqualified. I can
foresee a little sport for Her Majesty's press.
Mrs Ewing's excuse that the media were in possession of the same
story, and waiting to pounce, does not seem too credible. Ms Cunningham
has been around for a long time. She fought a General Election campaign
in the same constituency, which the Tories thought they were going to
lose.
If anyone had wanted to play this rather poor card, they would have
done so by now. The truth is that, even in Kinning Park, stories about
private matters which occurred almost two decades ago and had no public
relevance whatsoever are of fairly limited interest or value. The idea
that the Nationalist campaign would have foundered on the rock of
seventies romance is drivel.
Instead, a woman for whom I have no political sympathy -- apart from
the republicanism -- but who appears to be a perfectly presentable
political candidate, sincere in her views, finds herself paraded in the
public prints under such tasty headlines as: ''Sex scandal ousts SNP
candidate''.
I regard that as a contemptible intrusion upon individual privacy,
irrespective of the party involved. And, to be fair to the deceased MP
whose legacy is being contested, he would have been in the forefront of
saying exactly the same thing. A better Scotland, my backside.
The truth is that the Nationalists are remarkably jumpy about a
by-election which, on paper, they should win by a mile. They are not
used to being front-runners, even less accustomed to having a record in
local government to defend.
Whichever prime and pristine specimen of Homo Scotticus is put
forward, he is going to face some difficulties in getting the lines
right for the electorate which is being wooed. I don't think we will
hear much of the screeching Monklands rhetoric, while the Nats'
new-found admiration of Clause 4 may be put on the back-burner.
We may hear rather more than usual from Mr Welsh and his rather
different strain of nationalism. I happened to catch some comments of
his on radio recently when he explained the meaning of nationalism to a
Radio 5 Live audience: ''We'll still have the Queen as head of state.
We'll still be part of the United Kingdom.'' Really?
The Nationalists will obviously go into the campaign as front-runners
because they are best-placed to beat the Tory. In every other
by-election in this Parliament, the party in that position won with very
handsome majorities. But there are enough uncertainties here to make it,
at very least, an interesting contest.
Nicky, who was not a man of immense modesty, would tell you at the
drop of a lum hat about the thousands of personal votes which he
garnered to the Tory cause and how he was the only man who could have
saved the seat. Funny enough, Bill Walker had much the same view of his
own drawing-power next door, while it is an absolute certainty that
neither believed it about the other.
There is, of course, a counter-theory, which is that the Tories held
Perth and Kinross despite of the Laird of Fordell rather than because of
him, and that there are thousands of suppressed Tory voters celebrating
their liberation and queuing up to support The Clone.
All of this will be put to the test. The racing certainty, whatever
hype is applied, is that this will not be the Great Constitutional
Showdown in the eyes of most electors. Perthshire Tories will vote for
The Clone because they are Perthshire Tories. The Nationalists will seek
to exploit every anti-Tory grievance and then claim it as a vote against
1707.
It clearly isn't the most favourable territory for Labour, but strange
things occasionally happen in by-elections. At this stage I would not
rule out the possibility that there are enough good people in Perth and
Kinross who are equally turned off by Union Jack Toryism and Calvinist
Monarchist Nationalism.
It's certainly worth proceeding on the assumption that -- in Perth and
Kinross as in so many former Tory strongholds -- there just might be a
big enough market for a genuine, attainable alternative on employment,
housing, health, railways, and indeed the constitution.

FIRE safety in our schools is a very subject and nothing could be
further from the Diary's mind than to make light-hearted references to
any scenario in which any of the little brats in uniform might perish.
But here goes.
A mole in the vicinity of Uddingston Grammar School sends a copy of
the establishment's new staff guidelines on fire safety precautions and
procedures, drawn up, of course, as part of a Strathclyde-wide
initiative.
The previous guidelines consisted of a three-page document which
appeared to be entirely adequate. The new guidelines stretches to 35
pages.
Many trees have perished, therefore, to inform the staff that: ''The
official signal that a fire drill or a genuine fire emergency evacuation
is under way is the sounding of the fire alarm.
''The alarm signal consists of a persistent, penetrating, and
ululating tone of high frequency oscillation.''
However, ''in a genuine and unforeseen fire emergency it may be
necessary for members of staff to exercise their own judgment and to
make a decision to deviate from the existing arrangements''. Such as
throwing a copy of the fire safety guidelines and a selected pupil or
two on to the flames.
Cheesed off
THEY know how to have their tea at the European Parliament. A wee
buffet has been organised for ce soir with dishes from all of the 15 EU
nations. From Austria's offering of sachertorte to Spain's tortilla it
is an extravaganza of good grub. But haud on what is this entry on the
menu under ''Angleterre -- cheddar et roast beef''. Apparently,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not exist. It's enough to make
your haggis curdle.
Dod of the action
WE were reading, as you do, details of Channel 4's upcoming series Red
Light Zone on sex, the sex industries, sexual tourism, pornography, the
growth in erotic entertainment, and sheep farming in Aberdeenshire. (OK,
we made the last bit up.)
One of the programmes is called Ladyboys and is ''an intimate portrait
of two teenage boys from rural Thailand who seek fame and fortune as
transvestite cabaret performers''. We are only telling you all this
because we were struck by the boys' names. They are called Odd and Dod.
The sort of names you might give to a sheepdog, which brings us back to
rural Aberdeenshire.
* WE hope the owners of Glasgow's newest resting place for weary
travellers, the Charing Cross Hotel, do not mind being tacked on to the
above item. In an attempt to brighten up the facade of the hotel, a
former office block, an adornment in the style of Charles Rennie
Macintosh was added. But it has to be taken down. At night time, what
could be seen more than anything else was the big red light above the
hotel door.
The department of unlikely occurrences
* The staff at Baring Brothers Singapore putting round a sheet for
Nick Leeson.
* Norman Lamont being invited to partake of the roast beef and
Yorkshire at Chequers this Sunday.
* Roseanna Cunningham and Winnie Ewing being in the same set for the
Dashing White Sergeant at the next SNP ceilidh.
* M77 being rerouted through Giffnock.
* Bairn Broon being taken into care.
* Rose Street being a Welsh-singing-free zone on Saturday.
* Sunday Sport heading ''Nicky Alive! Fairbairn Spotted Working In
Shoprite!''
* Reportng Scotland's Heather the Weather scowling at the camera and
saying ''Bugger!''
* Prince Charles accepting voluntary redundancy.
* Princes William and Harry growing up to be two perfectly ordinary
nice young men.
* Partick Thistle playing a home game unless they move Firhill to the
top of Mount Ararat.
* Jim Farry talking exclusively to Marie Claire about his sexual
fantasies.
* The editor allowing that last bit about Jim Farry's sexual
fantasies.
Out on a limb
IF this were the kind of column which indulged in low language we
would introduce this item with a phrase such as nice legs, shame about
the spelling. It concerns a bonnie lass called Sarah MacRae, pictured
left, who was Miss Scotland 1993-94.
She has set up a company, Centre Stage, to use her skills and
experience in the world of marketing. In a letter to PR companies, Sarah
writes: ''Whether it be a conference, a charity opening or a glamorous
prestige event, attention to detail and professionalism are the keys. I
have always insisted on 100% professionalism. You will find I bring the
rigorous experience I have gained from every project to bare.''
The accompanying portfolio of snaps certainly bears witness to her
attributes.

WEDNESDAY'S vote on Europe saw the Prime Minister surviving nicely if
narrowly. Given the nature of the British party system that should
hardly surprise. The electorate does not expect individual idiosyncracy
in MPs (though it sometimes gets it) and the Whips normally predict
behaviour accurately, and try to compel it where they have doubts. The
Tory Whips failed conspicuously with the famous nine rebels (now in
disarray themselves) but they must have been especially irked by the
defection of the former Chancellor, Mr Lamont, who voted in the Labour
lobby this week. Others of his colleagues are livid, though the party
line, arrived at unconsciously and accepted automatically, is one of
sadness rather than anger. The party system really only works if members
subordinate themselves to it. Voters may say that they prefer
independent thought and action in politicians, but the curious fact is
that no seat elects an independent candidate.
If a party is the only sure embrace from the cradle to the grave of a
political career, it is easy to see why some of Mr Lamont's former
colleagues believe he committed political suicide this week. His future
was uncertain before, because his present constituency is due to be
abolished by the recommendations of the Boundary Commission. He would
have found some difficulty in getting another. Constituency selection
committees are famously loyal and Mr Lamont has increasingly been giving
testimonies of disloyalty to the Government since ceasing to be
Chancellor. His views might have been expected to command support in
many Tory seats, where enthusiasm for Europe is far less than Sir Edward
Heath can imagine, but voting with the Opposition is quite another
matter. It is hard to see him being adopted for another, winnable, seat
before the next election, though it might, just, be another matter if
its outcome is to produce a Tory Opposition hostile to the EU. In that
case Mr Lamont might be able to say ''I told you so'', and climb back
into the fold.
It seems unlikely. Parties are unforgiving of desertion (though in
Parliament they can be quite generous on matters of conscience) because
they only cohere on the basis of a mutual sacrifice of personal opinion.
The party monolith may be an exaggeration but it is nearer the truth
than the Israeli idea of an ''alignment''. If the party does not hang
together it could fragment, and British voters punish division even
before the electoral system itself punishes fragmentation.

INDIA'S Taj Mahal is one of mankind's loveliest creations as well as
one of the best known. It attracts more than 1.5 million tourists a
year, including 500,000 foreigners whose spending is a significant
element in the country's hard currency earnings. A seventeenth-century
Mughal emperor's memorial to his wife, it has romantic origins which
many find echoed in its combination of grace and elegance: few who see
the marble building in its calm setting remain untouched by its
enchantment. They have also, increasingly of late, been conscious of its
precarious future as the pollutants of Indian industrial expansion
(including those from a major oil refinery three miles from the site).
The pollutants have induced physical changes in the marble -- ''marble
cancer'' in popular parlance, much similar to ''concrete cancer'' in
less celebrated constructions.
After pressure from environmentalists, the Indian Government has
announced a new plan to protect the Taj. A switch to liquified petroleum
gas use by industry operating within the immediate neighbourhood of the
monument will produce far less pollutants than existing fuels, notably
coal. And low-lead petrol for cars using regional motorways will be
available from this summer to improve air quality. A huge planting of
trees -- known to be absorbers of airborne pollutants -- will contribute
to the same end. It is not too much, though it may be too late, but it
will take some years before a fresh assessment can be made. The thought
that India's economic progress could threaten such a penalty will be
galling to its leaders, but it is only fairly recently that the full
costs of industrial acivity have become obvious beyond dispute. And it
is not developing economies only which have imposed them. London's
Albert Memorial, a less beautiful monument than the Taj but with its own
appeal, was also being eaten away by the air. It is only now being
saved, at immense cost. The Indian Government may be ahead of the game.

SPORTS of all sorts change and evolve through time. Rugby Union has
always been exciting and it has moved with the times in many respects.
Now, according to one of it most powerful figures, it is going through a
complete metamorphosis. The issue which is propelling change is the need
to face up to the role of payments in cash or in kind in what has always
been an amateur sport. Nobody doubts that payments of one sort or
another have become common in Rugby Union in recent years. The New
Zealand, Australian, and French authorities have been relaxed in their
attitude to the issue and have allowed their players considerable
latitude. An obvious example is the brilliant Australian, David Campese,
who played much of his club rugby in Italy, though probably not because
of his ancestry or because of a lack of sunshine back home.
The real objection to what has happened around the rugby world is not
necessarily the compensation (of whatever financial degree) to players
for lost income, or to the many other perks, jobs, and inducements which
have been offered, but to the utter hypocrisy of it all. Rugby should be
amateur or professional but not a queasy mixture of the two. Whether the
metamorphosis spoken about by Major Quin of the mighty Bath Rugby Club
to the Commons National Heritage Committee yesterday will be complete is
not certain; in some ways we wish it might be, if only to remove the
confusion. The annual meeting of the International Rugby Football Board
next week promises to be even more revelatory. The New Zealand ruling
body has already said that it wants some relaxation of the amateur
regulations and the Welsh RU said yesterday that it, too, wants
increased rewards for senior players. These demands should be addressed
seriously. Whatever the resulting decision, the hypocrisy should end.

Lesley Duncan meets the wives of our rugby heroes on the eve of a
bone-crunching encounter.
EVERY red-blooded woman in Scotland (and not a few French dames too)
must have envied Mrs Gavin Hastings after the Scotland captain's
heart-stopping, match-winning sprint in the Parc des Princes in Paris a
fortnight ago. But, after the glaur and the glory, what do rugby wives
really feel about the game and their men's participation in it?
Are they tolerant of the male camaraderie which takes their husbands
away from home and family not just at weekends but for midweek training
sessions throughout the winter? Do they feel excluded by the boisterous
male bonding that seems the essence of the game? Do they worry about
injuries? Do they hate the chore of restoring the bemired rugby gear to
a semblance of cleanliness for the next game?
And do they actually enjoy standing on the sideline watching their
spouses cavorting around the rugby pitch in pursuit of that wayward
elliptic ball? Is it really the stuff of adult life?
The wives of Scotland's rugby heroes turn out to be good sports. They
admit to no mutinous thoughts about their husbands' dedication to the
game. This is all the more selfless since -- unlike the wives of
professional footballers -- they have no financial benefits from their
husbands' involvement in rugby. These rugby wives tend to be young
professional women in their own right.
Diane Hastings, wife of Gavin, works in the sales and marketing side
of an investment company. How did she feel when Gavin made his heroic
dash in Paris? She was sitting at the other end of the pitch, she
explains, and it was her companion who noticed what was happening. After
that her memory is ''a bit of a blur. I was just so happy. I was dancing
up and down.'' Her main response, though, was to be ''absolutely
delighted for Gavin.''
Was it, I wondered, a burden for him, and the Scottish squad
generally, to carry the hopes of Scotland? ''Not really,'' Diane
Hastings replies. ''As long as he's still enjoying it he will continue
to play. There's a job to do and he focuses on that. It's a way of life.
He aims to win. He's a very confident person.''
Scotland's rugby wives now travel with their husbands for away games.
They stay in different hotels until after the match. The pattern is for
the wives to dine separately with the wives of the opponents' team,
while the menfolk eat together, before all meet for a dance. The French
game is the exception. ''For some reason the French don't take their
partners over here,'' says Diane Hastings. Nor do they produce them in
Paris. This in no way clouded celebratory proceedings in France. The
Scottish wives and committee ''lined the foyer and clapped-in'' the
heroes. ''The champagne flowed all night.''
Diane Hastings says she has never resented the demands of rugby. On
the contrary, ''it's great to be a part of it'' -- particularly when the
team's on a winning streak. She does, however, admit to getting ''very
tense and nervous on the build-up to a game''. Does she worry about the
score or her husband's safety? ''Both,'' she says. ''If Gavin disappears
under a pile of big forwards I wonder if he's going to come up again!''
Injuries easily happen, she knows, citing the case of Ian Jardine, who
was hurt against France. That was also a setback for the team, though it
has allowed Gavin's brother Scott to return to the side. ''Hopefully
they'll continue in their winning ways!''
One last question: who does the laundry? Male chauvinists note well.
''I have hardly ever washed rugby kits,'' says the hero's wife. The
Scotland team, of course, get fresh gear for each game but Gavin
Hastings throws his old jerseys into the washing machine. ''Occasionally
I see shorts soaking in the sink!'' says Diane Hastings.
Diane's sister-in-law Jenny also has a husband who does his own
washing. This may date back to the early days of her marriage when she
boiled some shorts of Scott's, forgot about them for a month, and found
them jellified. ''I still cringe when I think about it,'' she laughs.
Perhaps with this episode in mind, ''Scott scrubs away the night before
he's playing.'' His domestic attitude is, says his wife: ''If I've got
time I'll help you.'' Anyway, says Jenny Hastings, ''I have so much kit
of my own.''
She is, in fact, an athlete in her own right, specialising in the
triathlon, which involves swimming, cycling, and running. A member of
the Edinburgh Triathletes club, she's in the Scottish training squad.
She is also a partner in a stationer's business.
Does she enjoy rugby? ''Och yes. I was brought up in it. My dad was a
rugby player. It's good fun.'' She says she doesn't resent its demands
on Scott's time: ''We just miss each other a lot.'' She watches Scott's
Watsonian games most times, unless she has other commitments. And young
Master Corey Hastings, who's just over two, often goes too. Rugby is
very good for family viewing, says Jenny Hastings. ''Most clubs are very
friendly to children.''
Like other wives, Jenny Hastings worries about injuries. She remembers
getting a phone call from New Zealand two years ago during the last
British Lions' tour, telling her not to panic but that Scott had been
hurt and was going for an operation. It was the same injury -- a
fractured cheekbone -- as Ian Jardine's and he still has the metal
plate. The thought of tackling somebody again can be daunting but, says
Jenny Hastings, ''These guys go out to give it everything.''
Ann Jardine will be attending tomorrow's match and the dance
afterwards. Her husband Ian will, sadly, also be confined to a
spectator's role. In spite of the severity of his cheek injury he is
cheerful. He told me that he is not in much pain and is well on the
mend. His aim now is to get into the World Cup squad.
The Jardines have a 10-month-old daughter, Megan, and Ann works
full-time as a systems analyst for Scottish Amicable in Stirling. How do
they cope with family life? ''It's hard but we seem to manage,'' she
says. She was brought up with rugby, both brothers and her father
playing.
Do the rugby wives and girlfriends have a camaraderie of their own?
''Oh yes, we all have the same interest in Scotland winning. Our social
life depends on a good game,'' she says. ''You make friends as well.''
And, of course, they can all moan and groan together.
And how does her husband live up to the washing test? ''Ian's very
good. He'll scrub his strips. I don't do any of the hard work.'' With
six brothers, he was no doubt well trained by his mother.
Kenny Milne's wife Ellie also has a job and a young family. She's a
midwife in the Simpson neo-natal unit in Edinburgh, works permanent
night shifts, and has Stewart, four, and Jenny, three, to look after.
She relishes joining the other Scotland wives for away matches. ''It's
absolutely brilliant.'' They enjoy sightseeing together and getting away
briefly from the children.
Does she, too, worry about injuries? ''Yes, I do all the time. Kenny's
in the front row of the scrum. If he's injured it's going to be serious.
As a nurse I'm worried that he'll break his neck.'' All the players, of
course, wear gumshields. ''It would be crazy not to,'' she says.
But have I finally found a wifely laundress? ''I wouldn't win Miss
Persil of the Year Award,'' jokes Mrs Milne.
Ellie Milne, herself a sports person (''When we first met I was hockey
training'') and fully supports of her husband: ''He's realised his dream
in playing for Scotland. Me too!''
Equally enthusiastic about the rugby scene is Gillian Hall, Bryan
Redpath's fiancee, and a nurse at the Borders General Hospital, Melrose.
''It's good for its social side and you make a lot of good friends,''
she says. ''Sometimes I wish we could see a bit more of each other, but
I support him and am proud of him.''
The Scotland team got together in Edinburgh on Wednesday and won't see
their families until after the match. ''They're probably better
concentrating on the game,'' says Gillian Hall philosophically, though
she speaks with Bryan on the phone. And there is the post-match
socialising to look forward to: ''Hopefully we'll be in good spirits,
mix, and have good fun.''
As a nurse she does worry that he's going to hurt himself. Though he's
a scrum half and ''usually a bit safer'', she always gets really
concerned when she sees him disappear and waits for him ''coming out
alive''. When she sees big guys thundering down towards him, she says:
''I almost want to go out and protect him!'' Bryan is so ''totally
dedicated and tries so hard it would be such a shame not to support him.
He's the same with me.''
Quite a team to have on your side.

VORSPRUNG durch Glesca ya bass, as they are wont to say in Hamburg. Or
maybe not. What is sure is that the two Hamburg music journalists who
run the two-year-old Marina label are mighty keen on Glaswegian talent.
Until last week, in fact, the label's roster was 100% Scottish,
comprising Gazelle, Eight Miles High, the Bathers, Cowboy Mouth and
Sugartown.
The latter trio of bands will be on view at Glasgow's Tramway over the
next three Sunday nights in a series of Marina showcases. For #7, you
get a six-track Marina sampler tape courtesy of sponsors Smirnoff, and
of course live selections from the bands' albums to date.
So far Marina has issued Lagoon Blues by the Bathers; Life As A Dog by
Cowboy Mouth and Sugartown's Swimming In The Horsespool. Each week's
show will be different, so at some point you should be able to hear a
preview of the Bathers' next album, Sunpowder, scheduled for May and
featuring Liz Fraser of the Cocteau Twins.
The Hamburg-Glasgow link was set up by accident after Stefan Kassel
and Frank Lahnemann had interviewed chief Bather Chris Thomson. ''We
never had the idea We must release Glasgow music,'' says Stefan, fresh
from having signed his first local Hamburg band, the Beatles-influenced
Camping.
''We heard a Gazelle demo and thought it should be released. We said
to ourselves: 'Why are there so many bad records around when we know
there is so much good stuff? Let's try to release it.'
''If you look at our bands, the only connecting link is that they have
soul . . . songs with real emotion. There are a lot of great singers in
Glasgow. But while we are music fans, we aren't naive, so we know how
the music business works... we know we aren't going to get front-page
stories in the English-based music press because we can't afford a
two-page advert in the same paper.
''We know that those papers maybe won't listen to Cowboy Mouth because
of Grahame Skinner's past links to Hipsway, because Hipsway aren't seen
as fashionable. Weekly music papers in London are always searching for
new kicks . . . trying to create new kicks. In Europe, music papers are
monthly so there aren't the same pressures on journalists.
''We think that all our acts have the potential for long careers as
songwriters and musicians. I can see Cowboy Mouth doing 20 albums, like
Neil Young and Van Morrison.
''We like to remind people of Blue Note, founded in New York by two
German guys, emigrants from Berlin. For the first 10 years they weren't
successful, with a four-year spell where they couldn't release any
records because they ran out of money. But they became the best jazz
label in the world. That's us, we hope, but a little quicker.''

HAD Venus and Adonis been written last year instead of in 1593,
Shakespeare might well have enjoyed the dubious accolades accorded to
Oliver Stone if this powerful interpretation by the Actors Touring
Company and physical theatre group The Hairy Marys is anything to go by.
This is no ordinary version of the epic poem, more a flash/trash
powderkeg of video and dance that reminds one much of Natural Born
Killers and the dark deathmask that American film's enfant terrible
Kenneth Anger held up to Stateside culture in his sixties masterpiece
Scorpio Rising.
Venus and Adonis was Shakespeare's attempt to become an epic poet. It
was dedicated to the high-flying third Earl of Southampton whom
Shakespeare reincarnated as Adonis and then as Venus.
Played out in a room lit by flickering video footage of sex shops,
neon, expensive living and cheap thrills, it's a roller coaster of love
and lust. Explicit at times -- a leather-clad Adonis is beaten, bound,
and tormented by Venus -- and gentle at others, Shakespeares tale is
littered with black humour and images ranging from Biblical tales to
Nazi death camps and a soundtrack blessed with Dusty Springfield's
gorgeous You Don't Have To Say You Love Me.
It could degenerate into a shock-for-the-sake-of-it bore but it
doesn't thanks to the three performers, particularly Ona McCracken who
excels as a cocaine-sniffing narrator. Shakespeare is alive and kicking,
beating like the heart that is ''the organ of desire'', in this dramatic
reminder that perhaps we don't need Oliver Stone to tell us how powerful
and bizarre love can be.
* Venus and Adonis is at Glasgow's Tron from April 5.

Jeff Buckley is embarked on a strange journey, says David Belcher.
FACE to face this week amid the bunk-beds, blankets, and computer-game
consoles on his tour bus, newly arrived in Glasgow from Belgium, Jeff
Buckley is awesomely cool, in a cockily vulnerable, rumpled kind of way.
He is slight enough to make Bobby Gillespie, Scotland's own prince of
wiry undernourishment, resemble a bulked-up Chippendale.
Jeff's hair is tousled and dyed black. His irises are black, too;
primordial pools. His face is wan and finely sculpted. He is prone to
calling people ''Honey'' in his quiet, reproachful voice. He is the
personification of bohemian fragility.
Yet there seems a great sureness to Jeff Buckley, too. And a sparky
wit. I begin by asking, apologetically, if I can re-pose the same dumb
old questions he'll have been asked a million times already, Jeff's
short career having attracted busloads of interviewers. ''No,'' Jeff
says with mock severity, a playful smile on his lips.
Nevertheless, I take Jeff back to his peripatetic California
childhood, a rootless adolescence in small towns beyond number
''depending on my mom and what job she had, what man there was, the
state of her finances. It gave me strength, insight, resolve . . .and at
the same time it depleted my understanding . . .of what it's like to
have a home, or even your own dog for more than a year.''
During Jeff's youth, he had another name, Scott Moorhead, courtesy of
his step-father. This he discarded for his current name, the one on his
birth certificate. What does it matter? It doesn't particularly, but
Jeff Buckley's father was troubled troubador Tim, dead of a drugs
overdose in June 1975, aged one year older than Jeff is now.
Tim left Jeff's mother when Jeff was six months old. Father and son
spent eight days together at Easter, 1975. Thus there has been much
fanciful genetic surmising by the critics who have frothed over Jeff's
astonishing voice -- praising its ''muezzin arpeggios'' -- and his debut
album, Grace (''achingly majestic''). As a result, Jeff has been
displeased to be viewed as less than his own creation.
So why change your name, emphasising the link?
''And not adopt what is my right? No. But the link would have come out
anyway, even if I had changed my name. And I did think about changing
it. I never found a suitable pseudonym . . . Cool Daddy Rox?''
How do you cope with the acres of press attention you've received,
being likened to ''a choirboy singing from the rafters of a
whorehouse''? Being hailed for taking ''more risks in the space of one
song than most allegedly brave artists dare in a career''?
''Imagine it. Whether it's good or bad, it's a dilemma, being under
the microscope. I waver between the honour of it and the paranoia. I
think I cope by being more into the paranoia of it.''
Did you ever envision a career, a job other than music?
''Music isn't a job. It's a journey, a path.''
That sounds a very Californian thing to say.
''I'm very Californian! But all that bullshit mumbo-jumbo, stuff like
beach-retreat ashrams . . . it's just a way of putting ancient truths,
that were thought by real people, into bitesize packages.''
And what truths can be divined from 20 minutes sitting on a bus with
Jeff Buckley? I'm not certain. All I know is Jeff called me Honey and it
gave me quite a thrill. Cool, beautiful, awesome, daring talents who
resemble no one but themselves . . . this world is desperately short of
them.

PUNK lives. In the last scorching five minutes of the final concert of
their inaugural series last night, the Yggdrasil Quartet of Aberdeen
lived up to their reputation and earned every penny of their money. They
charged into the finale of Beethoven's third Rasumovsky Quartet with
playing that was breathtaking in its combination of sensational
virtuosity and startling clarity.
Already these four Swedish lads are immediately identifiable by their
unmistakable sound. To call it big is to miss the point. They rip into
music, pouring in energy and commitment and hauling out high-octane,
volatile sounds. There's a kind of punk element in it, which appeared in
both Schubert's Quartettsatz and Berwald's attractive Third Quartet: the
Yggdrasils always go for the attack, they revel in risk. Sometimes, with
the sheer ferocity of their assault, they almost push the music into
stress.
But such is the intensity and technical polish of their playing that
even when they force the intonation into an anxiety neurosis it's
forgivable -- it even becomes part of the excitement.
And frankly, with a group that has the ability and audacity to produce
such an electrifying performance as that final Beethoven, the
hair-raising cornering on two wheels is an integral part of the
performance.
And now that we know they can do this, the news that, on future
visits, they are going to mount an ascent of Everest -- the late
Beethoven quartets -- is big news indeed.
Watch this space.

LOSING Lawrence Foster through indisposition meant losing Bartok's
Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta, but gaining Alexander
Lazarev meant gaining Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, which seemed, on
the whole, a fair exchange. For the large audience, however, what
presumably mattered was that Midori and Tchaikovsky's violin concerto
remained in place.
Schoenberg's music for strings without percussion in fact proved a
logical match for Dvorak's D minor wind serenade, which opened the
programme, though the point might have been better made if the serenade
had been played more pungently and with more obvious enthusiasm.
But there was no doubt about the expressiveness of Schoenberg's tone
poem, for which Lazarev employed full strings and reseated the players
nineteenth-century fashion, with eight double basses stretched along the
rear of the platform, first and second violins to left and right, and
cellos and violas in the middle.
Though he thereby achieved maximum richness and balance at the
emotional peaks, Lazarev nevertheless managed to preserve something of
the delicacy of the work's original sextet version in the ravishing
interplay of parts and the soft rustle of Schoenberg's touches of
Wagnerian magic fire. The ending was exquisitely sustained, the whole
work vividly structured, and deserved its ovation.
Structure, in the Tchaikovsky, seemed not to be Midori's priority,
though her kittenish teasing of the triplets, leaps, and runs in the
first movement was a delight to watch and hear. The trouble was that her
fine-spun approach to the music differed considerably from Lazarev's
bold accompaniments. For all its moments of beauty, it was a performance
that demanded a new definition of the word rubato, and had all the shape
of a piece of bubble gum.

IT wouldn't be the first band that wanted to take a good audience on
tour with them -- the same might apply to venues. On Wednesday night
Trilok Gurtu's Crazy Saints played Manchester's Band On The Wall, a club
for which the word intimate might have been invented and a performance
which had the band's chaperon drooling.
Knowing the BOW, and having heard the Crazy Saints here, I can
understand his enthusiasm, but in the Music Hall, perched high on the
stage and with an unsympathetic acoustic, they weren't, I'm sure, heard
to best effect.
We heard the subtleties in the music -- it is all very carefully put
together -- but when it came to its heavier aspects what should have
been industrial strength riffing on Believe, with its echoes of Tony
Williams's 1970s Lifetime, had all the clout of an old Dansette.
Since the band last toured here 18 months ago guitarist David Gilmore
has joined pianist/keyboardist Daniel Goyone and bassist Chris Minhdoky,
adding a more menacing edge to the at times sugar-sweet romantic
passages. His Western Front sounds like it could do some real damage in
a more intimate atmosphere.
Gurtu, as usual, dominated. His dominance is not the solo in every
tune cliche of the drummer/bandleader but a propelling, highly musical
function. The ease with which he can switch forms from the Indian tablas
to playing swing time on his oddly arranged and far from standard drum
kit is breathtaking.
But this was a collective effort, and catching the band at the Queen's
Hall, Edinburgh (today), the RSAMD Glasgow (tomorrow), or the MacRobert
Centre, Stirling (Sunday), is recommended.

THERE is a compelling moment in The Black Swan pas de deux when Yurie
Shinohara's Odile looks at the Prince -- he has his back to her. In one
raking glance she weighs him up and marks him down as easy meat. And
then, more kestrel than swan, she swoops in for the kill, all coquettish
smiles and random aloofness, urging Prince Siegfried (Campbell McKenzie)
to pledge anything, everything for her love . . . And the whole stage is
filled with the charged passion of their encounter, the steps -- which
both handle with exact panache -- spark with something more than just
technical brilliance. The thing has life, it has drama, it connects with
its audience. And for a glorious few minutes one forgets to look at the
costumes.
Oops! One is, of course, meant to look at the costumes, and the sets
(both designed by Jasper Conran) because they are an integral part of
Scottish Ballet's new-look Swan Lake. They place the ballet in the
eighteenth century. A palely loitering first act has gauzy creams, a
little lavender, set in the greenery of a garden.
Act three offers a formal palace interior and costumes which have
deepened into black, dark gold, various shades of burgundy and
heliotrope; acres of velvet encrusted with gold braid, beads, and gold
braid. The effect is like an ornate Faberge egg because, despite truly
fine performances from the principals, there is an abiding emptiness to
Galina Samsova's restaging. Beyond the appearances, opulent costumes,
carefully orchestrated stage pictures, disciplined swans, there is a
hollow where the heart of conflict between good and evil should be
played out in force.
Last night it simply wasn't there -- perhaps this was nerves. The
important thing is, does it work in its own terms? Sadly not quite --
fine feathers can't really disguise a scarcely adequate bird.

Political Editor, Geoffrey Parkhouse reviews a faltering career
and the motives behind the former
Chancellor's damaging actions
against his own party.
THE Rt Hon Norman Stewart Hughson Lamont has a great sense of amour
propre. When this is affronted he can become very stagey and bitterly
angry. He felt put down by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary
on Wednesday night. The impulse of this took him, unforgivably, into the
Labour division lobby.
Yesterday morning there was no sign of remorse. ''When one feels one's
arguments and one's words have no effect, sometimes it is necessary to
make people sit up.'' So it was a calculated move to draw attention.
You can see why some people think him arrogant and vengeful. An Anglo-
Shetlander with fine ideas of his own importance -- ''a jumped-up spotty
little runt'', as one minister put it. This is an abridged version:
also, Mr Lamont is not spotty.
He takes himself seriously and expects others to do so. When the Prime
Minister himself fails him in this regard, the Prime Minister must be
made to ''sit up''. Ditto Mr Hurd. Their crime? They failed to denounce
the view of his successor as Chancellor, Ken Clarke, that European
monetary union need not lead to political union.
Mr Lamont has decided that it would. He is passionately against a
single currency in principle, never mind whether it is feasible or
practicable. His views -- he has also warned that it might be necessary
for Britain to leave the Union -- were not being treated with proper
respect. His distinctive looks have been equated with those of an
Italian tenor. At times, he has the volatile temperament to go with it.
At 52, Mr Lamont's glittering political career is faltering. Boundary
changes are set to rob him of his seat in Kingston-Upon-Thames. The
prospect of not even having a backbench position looms for the man who
was sacked as Chancellor in 1993, a year after the Exchange Rate
Mechanism debacle.
His friend and former Cambridge University and Cabinet colleague,
David Mellor, says that Lamont is still consumed with bitterness at
being made the fall guy for the ERM and still slighted by the memory
that Mr Major offered him a move from the Treasury to Environment.
''It's a sad state of affairs,'' said Mr Mellor.
It was Lamont who worked for Major when he was Chancellor and took us
into the ERM. It was Lamont who defended him as Britain plunged into
recession. It was Lamont who supported the attempt to keep the pound in
the mechanism. It was Lamont who ran Major's leadership campaign against
Douglas Hurd and Michael Heseltine to succeed Margaret Thatcher. It was
Lamont who helped him negotiate the key Maastricht opt-out on monetary
union.
Perhaps he has a right to feel that the Prime Minister has treated him
badly when he was merely the instrument of collective Cabinet policy. He
suspects that Major did not want to give him the Chancellorship in the
first place, but felt obliged to.
Resentment has loosened his tongue since. Major is ''weak'' and
''pathetic'' he told an interviewer. His Government was described as
''being in office but not in power'' -- a biting observation made in
Lamont's Commons resignation speech.
Last year he appeared to discover Northern Ireland and has campaigned
against the Prime Minister's ''sell-out'', much to Major's irritation.
He demands that Major renounces a single currency for ever, although Mr
Heseltine hints that his view was contrary in Cabinet. Now he gives Mr
Blair the unlooked-for bonus of an ex-Tory Chancellor voting with Labour
on a major issue, European policy.
The reason appears to be that the Prime Minister failed to treat him
with sufficient deference; failed to provide him with an answer of
sufficient clarity, even if such an answer could compromise the
negotiations to come with the EU member states. Mr Lamont, who believes
his former friend is a fool, felt that his former friend was treating
him like one.
There have been personal scrapes that might have inclined Mr Major
that his pal would become a liability one day. He is probably not the
only minister over the centuries to have his eye blackened in Mayfair by
a jealous Lothario. There may have been others who inadvertently leased
their property to a prostitute; or overloaded a credit card
(embarrassing if you happen to be in charge of the nation's financial
affairs at the time and decrying borrowing).
Lamont's escapades caused merriment rather than scandal and both
Margaret Thatcher and John Major are people tolerant of eccentricity of
the personal kind. Political eccentricity is a different matter. It
smarted when the Tories lost Newbury after Lamont had said on the
hustings ''Je ne regrette rien''.
The voters thought that he bloody well ought to have a lot to regret
about their parlous finances. Mr Major is not now prepared to defer to
Lamont, particularly when the latter seeks to drive a wedge between
Cabinet ministers.
What is the motive? Lamont needs another parliamentary seat and for
this he has to be selected by another constituency party. Both friends
and enemies say that he has got his eye on one in Northern Ireland,
where Enoch Powell departed after he abandoned Wolverhampton.
If so, it could be significant that with him in the Labour division
lobby on Wednesday night were the Ulster Unionists. He has been
championing their cause. At least in their eyes he will have done
himself no harm. There is another theory: Lamont has adopted an extreme
Euro-sceptic view, believed to be widely reflected in the mood of the
Tory Party at large, in order to attract a selection committee in a
preferably safe seat.
If he could achieve this, he might place himself at the head of the
Tory right. It has to be said however that even the Tory rebels are not
clamouring for him to do so now. He has joined their Fresh Start group,
though, and that's a start.
It is clear that Mr Lamont, intensely ambitious ever since he became
president of the Canbridge Union, feels that his talents should not go
to waste after all his tribulations and after making it to the No 2 job
in politics. Maybe he has heard another theory -- that Major will resign
after the May local elections and another drubbing from the electorate.
He would have little hesitation this time in making a leadership bid,
specially if he thought that his successor, Mr Clarke, might otherwise
replace the present incumbent. What better way to restore his amour
propre?
He takes himself seriously and expects others to do so. When the Prime
Minister himself fails him in this regard, the Prime Minister must be
made to 'sit up'

Arts, sports and community groups could be big losers with the
introduction of scratch card games by the National Lottery organisers,
reports Anne Johnstone
BY 1997 National Lottery scratch card games are expected to be
siphoning #1000m a year from our purses and pockets, outselling mighty
Coca Cola. But what may be music to the ears of lottery-organisers
Camelot, the Treasury, and those who stand to win up to #50,000 on a #1
card, could spell disaster for small charities and community groups,
especially those dependent on street collections, prize draws, and
lottery games.
Launching the new game, to be called ''Instants'', David Rigg,
communications director for Camelot, admitted this week: ''Inevitably
there will be some existing instants who will suffer -- badly in some
cases.''
Stephen Lee, director of the Institute of Charity Fundraising
Managers, goes further: ''For many smaller arts and sports organisations
and some other community groups, the procceds of lotteries form a large
proportion of their income. Some will go out of business as a result of
National Lottery scratch cards.''
Of course, some charities will stand to gain from Instants, namely
those who will receive grants. As with the on-line game, 50% will go on
prizes, 12[1/2]% in tax, and 28% will be spread equally between the five
designated good causes: arts, sports, charities, the heritage, and the
Millennium Fund.
Using current projections, each of the five should net an extra #55m a
year. But Stephen Lee claims that losers will far outnumber winners:
''If you are a small community organisation running a weekly or monthly
lottery to keep going, you must be incredibly worried. If Camelot is
right, their game will cream off #1bn a year. Their top prize of #50,000
is gigantic compared to these small locally run lotteries. This isn't
free and fair competition between Camelot and the market-place,
especially when Camelot is a licensed monopoly. This is a licence to
print money.''
He also points out that there is no undertaking from the National
Lottery's charities board to give favourable consideration to
applications from charities who believe they are losing large amounts of
income as a result of this major new player in the field.
As it happens, the Scottish Amateur Football Association is to
discontinue its own stratch card competitions in April after more than
10 years. ''Sales have been declining for some time. We felt with the
National Lottery starting, sales would be eroded further. The launch of
the Instants card would have an even greater effect. Our top prize is
#1000. We couldn't compete with a card offering #50,000,'' said
spokesman Hugh Knapp. In recent months the SAFA scratch cards operation,
intended to benefit both the association and individual clubs, has been
running at a loss.
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution, Britain's third-largest
charity, earns around #1m a year from its national and local lotteries.
Ian Ventham, head of fund-raising, says he expects the National Lottery
to make a dent in that this year. ''Scratch cards will exacerbate that.
They're bound to,'' he says.
It's impossible to estimate how much charities will lose as a result
of Instants. There is already intense controversy among fund-raisers
about the impact of the National Lottery on-line game since it began
last November. A survey by the Charities Aid Foundation indicated that
charity lotteries account for between #300m and #441m of income per
year. The Lotteries Council, which mainly represents football clubs,
recently announced that lottery takings among its members were down by
between 15% and 40%. In the Irish Republic existing lotteries
experienced a 60% drop in income after the introduction of a national
lottery.
Some charities are claiming that not only their lotteries, but street
collections and direct mail shots, have been badly affected by the
Lottery. Ethiopiaid, which supports long-term development projects in
Addis Ababa, has claimed its major annual direct mail shot, which
coincided with massive pre-publicity for the Lottery, produced only half
as much in donations as a similar appeal 12 months before.
Stephen Lee believes National Lottery Instants will simply add insult
to injury: ''It's outrageous. It's commercial greed. Income from the
Lottery is already exceeding predictions. Why do they need to do this?''
Sarah Linney, public relations manager for Camelot, admits some
existing charity lotteries may go to the wall: ''Some will find they
aren't competitive as a product.'' But she says Government regulations
here will protect smaller operators in the field, which didn't happen in
Ireland.
Camelot's position is that sctach cards are an impulse buy and by
raising revenue from #45m to #1000m, they will be raising ''new money''.
Linney points out that the largest existing UK lottery scratch card
scheme, Lucky Lotto, owned by three major charities, has welcomed
National Lottery's entry into the field, because they believe it will
raise the profile and hence the popularity of the cards.
''Our research shows that people distinguish between buying a scratch
card to support a local cause and buying a National Lottery ticket.
We're not in the business of putting charities out of business. Our job
is to maximise the money for good causes. To that end we need an instant
game as well as an on-line one.''
But Stephen Lee, for the charity fund-raisers, reminds givers:
''Whatever Instants are, they aren't a National Lottery for good causes.
If people think charities are worthy of their support, they should give
money to them directly and not through a lottery which will dispense
less than 6% of it to charitable causes.''

TV journalist Vladislav Listyev was just one more victim of Russia's
mobsters as they turn its cities into latter-day versions of Al Capone's
Chicago
THE murder of Vladislav Listyev, newly appointed head of the Ostankino
television network, who was shot through the heart by a professional
hitman as he entered his block of flats in Moscow is indicative of the
way organised crime now runs Russia's major cities.
Listyev, a fearless journalist, has stepped on somebody's toes. It is
suggested that he supported the removal of poor-class advertising from
his network, thus incurring the wrath of mobsters taking their cut from
the ads. Therefore he had to die.
Last October another leading journalist, Dmitri Kholodov, was killed
by a bomb planted in a brief case supposedly containing information
about corruption in the Soviet forces formerly stationed in Germany.
It has always been a dangerous business being a journalist seeking the
truth in Russia. In the old days it could lead to a KGB bullet in the
back of the head in the Lubyanka or an enforced stay in the gulag. Now
it is the Mafia that enforces its own particular and terminal form of
editorial control.
Journalists, however, are not the only people at risk. In 1993 there
were 25,000 murders in Russia and in the first six months of last year
813 people were murdered in Moscow, most of them by gangsters whose
activities have turned Moscow and St Petersburg into latter-day versions
of Al Capone's Chicago.
The Russian Interior Ministry estimates that the Mafia controls 40% of
the Russian economy, including dozens of banks. They have a simple
method of becoming partners in legitimate businesses: they make offers
that ''can't be refused''. Anybody who is unwise enough to refuse is
warned by being beaten up or having some fingers cut off. Some are
locked up in private prisons until they sign over their businesses.
There's no second warning: death comes by bomb or Kalashnikov; bodies
cut up by chain saws are stuffed into plastic bags and delivered to
their families.
The gangsters are quite blatant about their business. They can be seen
in the smart night spots in their sharp suits, dripping with gold chains
and rings, accompanied by their molls dressed in the smartest Western
outfits. They drive armoured BMWs and their bodyguards barely bother to
conceal their Kalashnikovs. Ordinary diners are turfed out of
restaurants when the mobsters want to hold a party.
Many of them are lawless men from the Caucasus, Georgians and
Chechens. What is often not written about President Yeltsin's invasion
of Chechnya is that it was partly prompted by the fact that Chechen
crooks had been waging war on Russia for years. The fierce hillmen have
always looked upon the Russians as legitimate targets for their anarchic
ways.
There has been, of course, always a rich vein of criminality in Russia
although it was never written about under communism. In fact, there was
a criminal underclass with a language of its own and when crooks were
sent to the gulag it was they who became the ''trusties'' and robbed and
raped political prisoners.
Corruption was epidemic under communism. Every state enterprise and
state farm had its ''tolkachi'', its fixers who arranged deals with
other enterprises, ensuring the delivery of raw materials and the
distribution of their products. Without this system communism would have
collapsed much sooner than it did.
Occasionally there would be a purge and after much-publicised trials
the culprits would be shot for ''anti-socialist behaviour''; but that
was regarded as part of the luck of the game and the corruption spread
throughout the Soviet until it reached into Brezhnev's own family.
The result of this was that when communism was revealed as a
70-year-old fraud the whole country was ready for the explosion of
criminality that followed. The old crimes of communism were simply
privatised.
The money that rolled in was staggering. It came from drugs,
protection rackets, and from contact with the West through currency
frauds and smuggled luxuries. The ''Mafiya'' bosses were able to buy
weapons, hire disgruntled veterans from the Afghan war and disillusioned
KGB men. It was simple and cheap to bribe the poorly-paid militiamen.
The police, understaffed, badly equipped and without the ultimate
sanctions of communism, have been able to do little to stem the flood of
crime. The gangsters simply do not care about the police.
Major General Alexei Semko of the Interior Ministry says: ''Under
communism we didn't have the legal nihilism in society that flourishes
today. If a citizen saw a police uniform he would react positively, in a
satisfactory way, when challenged. What we have today is anarchy.'' It
is that comparison that is making many Russians wonder if democracy is
worthwhile and if they were better off under the old certainties of
communism.
The problem is not confined to Russia. The new Mafia has already
spread its influence, its money and its hitmen abroad. In 1933, the
Chechen brothers, Ruslan and Nazerbeck Outslev, were shot dead in a
gangland hit in the penthouse flat they rented in London. In New York
the Brighton Beach Mob has brought fear to the Russian emigrants living
in this once-quiet corner of Brooklyn. Russian gangs are running
vice-rings in Germany. They have made contact with the original Mafia in
Sicily.
Louis Freeh, director of the FBI, says that organised crime in the
former Soviet Union is ''the greatest long-term threat to the security
of the United States.''
He argues that the gangs spreading through the United States and
Europe ''may have already obtained or will attain the capability to
steal nuclear weapons'' and sell them to terrorists. Freeh has now set
up an FBI office in Moscow with the co-operation of the Russian
authorities. The British security services are involved because of the
nuclear dangers and the National Criminal Intelligence Unit in London
has made the mobsters one of its prime targets.
President Yeltsin, recognising the political dangers of ''bespredcl,''
the complete absence of order, has beefed up the Federal
Counter-Intelligence Service -- successor to the KGB -- and given it
responsibility for fighting crime. He has also introduced a #1.6 billion
programme to recruit an extra 375,800 law-enforcement officers provided

Will this be enough to wipe the fat cat smiles off the faces of the
Moscow Mafioski? It is doubtful. The Russians have become too used to
corruption -- and that is one of the most baleful relics of Soviet-style
communism.

THE Prime Minister yesterday ruled out giving fresh powers to the
privatised utility regulators to cut prices where executives were
awarded excessive pay rises.
The suggestion was made to him in the Commons by Labour leader Tony
Blair, who said it would send ''the clearest possible signal to the
utilities that the game is up.''
Mr Major said he did not intend to extend the role of the regulators,
whose role was to protect consumers by introducing competition and
bearing down on prices.
He stuck to his earlier announcement that the Government will wait for
the Greenbury committee on boardroom pay and perks to report before
taking actio which would include ''legislative back-up if that were
required.''
Mr Blair referred to reports of two directors of the privatised
electricity company Norweb collecting #636,000 from their executive
share options. He suggested that the Government should support a Labour
amendment to the Gas Bill to be debated by MPs later this month which
would give the regulator power to cut prices where pay rises were
excessive.
Mr Blair said the Greenbury committee had said it would not propose
any legislation: ''Its report is not out for months and its main
recommendations will not affect the abuses in the privatised monopolies.
''The anger is now, the abuses are now -- why won't you act now to put
an end to the abuses?''
Mr Major retorted: ''The assertions you make are just frankly wrong. I
made clear the areas I believe need addressing.
''Firstly, the need for complete and open disclosure over remuneration
-- and the need to ensure that bonuses and share options are firmly
based on company performance.
''Those are the areas that need addressing. When we have
recommendations that cover those, we will consider them and if
necessary, I've made clear, we will provide legislative back up.
''But unlike you, I believe it is both necessary and desirable to wait
until we have that report and information, so we can then consider what
action is necessary.''
Labour's Derek Fatchett (Leeds Central) kept up the Opposition's
attack.
He said of Mr Major's decision to wait for the Greenbury report: ''Why
is it right to delegate this responsibility to an employers'
organisation, which has a vested interest in top people's pay?
''It's about time you gave a lead to the country and introduced your
own proposals.''
Mr Major told him: ''You are thirsting to go down the route of pay
policies that the Labour Party has gone down for generations.
''The concern that people feel about this issue is the concern that I
spelt out with great clarity on Tuesday.
''We are examining that. We are awaiting recommendations on that and
when the facts are available we will decide what action needs to be
taken -- if necessary including legislation.
''I have no intention of operating on the envious spirit that
activates you.''
Earlier, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Jonathan Aitken ,
gave a dismissive response to his Labour Shadow, Mr Andrew Smith, who
said the public wanted action now to curb huge executive rewards.
Mr Aitken said there was no reason why successful executives should
not receive rewards. In many comnpanies, these were ''well earned and
well rewarded.''
To call for the abolition of all share options, as Labour had done,
was not correct.
FORMER Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Tebbit warned of the danger
of ''third raters'' running Britain's largest companies if they were not
offered competitive rates of pay.
He said customers should be reminded that prices charged by the
utilities were controlled by the regulators. ''If the directors pay
themselves excessive amounts of money, that doesn't put up the price to
the customer. What it does is reduce the amount which is available to
pay dividends to the shareholders.''
''So it is the shareholders who ought to have the grouse and who ought
to put the bite when there are excessive pay rises,'' he said on BBC
Radio 4.
''If we don't pay the salaries which are appropriate to a world
company, then we won't get the best people. The question is -- for the
odd hundred thousand pounds or so one way or the other -- should we
accept third-raters or second-raters to run Britain's biggest
companies,'' he said. Lord Tebbit is a non-executive director of BT.

LESLEY DUNCAN introduces a new column with a look at Scottish
souvenirs with a difference
MY teenager is going to Germany on a school trip this summer for the
second year running. He'll be staying again with the family of his
German pen-friend Philipp. Presents will be needed.
Last year's tally included a tape of Scottish songs, Stirling T-shirts
with Robert the Bruce wielding an axe (what could have possessed me?),
and a Pringle jersey for Philipp, who developed an alarming taste for
golf on his reciprocal Scottish visit.
This year I want to send different Scottish souvenirs. One obvious
place to look for them in Glasgow is -- ironically in view of its name
-- the Robin Hood Gift House, 11 St Vincent Street; the ownership turns
out to be impeccably Scottish.
First, ground rules. Ideally, souvenirs should represent Scottish
craftsmanship as well as themes. That should probably rule out the chess
set with miniature reproductions of the chunky Lewis chessmen (#45.95).
It is made in Hull.
Personal tastes differ. What's kitsch to one may be covetable to
another. So while I wouldn't, myself, choose to own any of the model
buildings made by Fraser Creations I like the fact that they have sought
out subjects beyond the inevitable Glamis Castle. Their jaunty little
Glasgow tenement or Provand's Lordship (they'll have to update the
latter soon to acknowledge the new physic garden) would no doubt delight
transatlantic types with Scottish roots.
Nor does my own taste run to farm scenes with Clydesdale pulling
old-fashioned hay wain while farm workers toil under the eye of a
terrier (limited edition, #290). These elaborate tableaux by Border Fine
Arts are, however, made with an honest respect for their subjects, as
are their little pieces such as the snowy owls (#42.50).
The black Scottie, made of heavy resin, looks as if he could double as
a door-stopper, though that is not the makers' intention. If my Germans
are dog lovers this snappy Caledonian pooch (#52.50) would certainly see
off the neighbourhood Dobermans. The smaller version would make a good
paperweight.
Crystal-ball-gazers can choose from the Caithness Glass range of real
paperweights (#9-#35). Sometimes things are so ugly as to be almost
endearing. Into that category must fall the golf bag, giant club-head,
and curling stone filled with whisky (#54.45, #34.50, and #33.95
respectively) by Gordon Macphail of Elgin. Definitely presents for good
sports.
The Ingram Street shop of the National Trust for Scotland yields
pleasant possibilities, though many of their items are of English
National Trust provenance. I particularly liked the puffin from the
Highbank range, Lochgilphead (#27.15). He'd be sure to provoke a flutter
of approval on the Rhine.
I've reservations about straightforward copies of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh designs (perhaps because it seems, somehow, defeatist to rely
on the artistry of the past, however distinguished). None the less it's
impossible not to warm to the jewel colours of the ornamental tiles in
the Mackintosh range of Mynde Ceramics (#6.95-#9.95). They certainly
avoid the Scotland-as-Hicksville image.
So does the crystal made by Linda White and Andy Sharpe with swirling
Mackintosh rose or tulip motifs (decanter, #39.95; tot, #4.99; tumbler,
#8.95). The chubby perfume bottle at #23.50 could be the ideal gift for
Philipp's mother.
No dearth of choices, then. But I'm still looking for what used to be
a staple gift of mine to foreign friends -- ceramic Nessies. These came
in several serpentine hoops and could be spread out across a shelf or
piece of furniture to amusing effect. They instantly spelt Scotland to
the recipients. The ultimate Scottish emblem internationally recycled.

Women are still considered to be a
better risk by insurance companies
-- but only until their thirties.
Jennifer Cunningham reports.
TIME has caught up with the careful lady owner conjured up by so many
sellers of vehicles of doubtful pedigree. She was always assumed to be
well past her middle years, but on the insurers' risk scale there is now
no difference between male and female drivers after the age of 30. Below
that age careful girls remain a very much better bet than boy racers.
A check of the 30 companies on the AA's computer revealed a #128
difference in the cost of comprehensive cover for a man and a woman at
the age of 20.
Our hypothetical risks were a male and female nurse, each with a clean
driving licence, having driven for three years and with a one-year
no-claims bonus. Both were AA members looking for comprehensive cover
for a three-door Ford escort 1300 registered in 1990. They are both
regarded as risky by the companies and the premiums are sky-high:
#925.25 for the man and #797.25 for the woman. The difference amounts to
a year's road tax for the woman.
By the age of 30, there is no specific gender difference on a straight
comparison of cost, with factors such as type of vehicle and the area
being more significant.
Perth-based General Accident -- one of the first companies to make a
distinction -- shows an even bigger difference up to the age of 29. At
the age of 20, premiums for our nurses driving their 1990 Escorts would
be #1416.55 for the man and #1225.90 for the woman -- #190 in the
woman's favour but considerably more expensive than the AA's quotation.
At the age of 29 and with a 1992 car the cost would be #437.68 for the
man and #382.33, a saving of #55, for the woman. From the age of 30
there is no difference.
Women drivers, although 44% of licence holders, account for only 2% of
dangerous-driving convictions and 6% of drink-driving convictions and
their accident rate overall is lower. The insurance companies say this
is largely due to the fact that women drive less than men and usually in
smaller, slower cars.
Department of Transport statistics show women having more accidents
than men per 1000 miles, but driving fewer miles.
''Women tend to have bumps in car parks rather than motorway
crashes,'' said the man from the Norwich Union. They offer a Lady
Motoring policy geared to women's particular needs, which includes a
call to the RAC, a hire car for the day or getting to their destination.
They say there was enormous interest when the package was launched and
a number of women drivers switched to them specifically to get the
benefits of that deal. A number of other insurance companies have
followed suit.
This month the RAC will launch two new deals for women drivers. One is
a lady-driver's package which will offer a discount but the amount will
depend on the other risk factors involved. The other is aimed at the
woman they describe as the traditional female motorist: the mother who
drives the second car on school runs, and other local errands, building
up a small annual mileage.
It will offer a discount to take account of the lower mileage plus a
replacement car or taxi to take children to school if necessary and
special medical cover if children are injured in car accidents.
Even casual observation shows that the number of women drivers is
increasing. The fact that women begin driving at a younger age will lead
to more of them being responsible for their own insurance policies
rather than being a named driver on the policy of father or husband.
Research by the AA shows that the number of women taking out their own
insurance has been increasing steadily. In the past four years the
proportion of women taking on the responsibility for paying the premium
on their own car rose from 53% to 59% although 89% of men do so, with
only one in 100 leaving it to their partner.
It is a trend the AA wants to encourage, advising women to build up
their own no-claims discounts, although these can sometimes be
transferred if the partner dies or has to give up driving.
The most consistent advice from all insurers is to shop around and
check just what you are getting for your money -- the cheapest may not
always be the best deal.

JAMES MOLYNEAUX is to face a ''stalking horse'' challenge to his
leadership of the Ulster Unionists later this month, in the first clear
sign of discontent within the party over his handling of the framework
document on Northern Ireland's future.
A member of the Young Unionists will stand against the veteran
political leader at the Ulster Unionist Council annual general meeting
on March 18.
The challenger, from south Belfast, refuses to be named until a week
before the vote, but told BBC Radio Ulster he had a proposer and
seconder and was canvassing for support.
Party rules say that a challenger does not have to identify himself
until the day of the vote.
There is no chance that 74-year-old Mr Molyneaux, MP for Lagan Valley
and leader of the party since 1979, could be beaten.
However, anything more than a handfull of votes for the challenger
would be very damaging to his leadership.
There has been growing grassroots questioning of his handling of the
framework document and his so-called special relationship with the Prime
Minister.
The mystery challenger said bluntly that Mr Molyneaux had been duped
by Mr Major.
Mr Molyneaux was making no comment, but party officials said he was
taking it in a ''light-hearted manner'' and was unconcerned.
Recently, asked what he thought would happen if he was challenged for
the leadership, Mr Molyneaux said with heavy irony that he thought he
would ''scrape home''.
UUP security spokesman Ken Maginnis was dismissive of the challenge.
''I suppose it would be a poor country that couldn't produce one
individual with half a brain and delusions of grandeur.
''The person in question is obviously someone without any political
ambitions,'' he said.
The Ulster Young Unionist Council last night distanced itself from the
challenge and said it was not aware of any member being involved.
The Council said it fully supported Mr Molyneaux as leader.

Johannesburg, Thursday
WINNIE MANDELA arrived back in South Africa today to face a furore
over claims of fraud and corruption.
As she flew in, President Nelson Mandela vowed not to interfere with a
police investigation of his estranged wife.
''This is a matter between the police and the deputy minister,''
Mandela told reporters. ''It would be improper for me to interfere with
the police in carrying out their duties. I would not interfere even if
they raided my own house.''
As prominent officials distanced themselves from her, speculation was
rife that the controversial Mrs Mandela would eventually be forced out
of her post as Deputy Minister of arts, culture, science, and
technology.
The African National Congress reissued a code of conduct stating ''any
form of proven corruption shall constitute a legitimate ground for
instant dismissal from government''.
The president said no decision would be made until the allegations
were proved. Mrs Mandela is to meet Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who
has dealt with other crises involving her, on Saturday.
The allegations of corruption against Mrs Mandela are the most serious
so far against a member of the government, formed after the ANC won the
nation's first all-race election last April.
Amid calls for her to be sacked, Mrs Mandela cut short an unauthorised
visit to West Africa and flew home today. She gave a clenched-fist
salute to about 100 cheering supporters.
Security men and her private bodyguards forced a passage for her
through a scrum of reporters and photographers at the airport, where she
was met by her daughters Zinzi and Zenani.
A Mercedes-Benz whisked her to the Johannesburg Supreme Court, where a
judge ruled that documents seized at her home during searches yesterday
would remain under court control pending a hearing tomorrow. Mrs Mandela
emerged looking relaxed and was driven to her Soweto mansion.
Before leaving Abidjan, Ivory Coast, she accused police of trying to
discredit her with allegations that she received bribes from a building
company in exchange for a contract to build low-income housing.
Prosecutors will eventually determine whether to bring charges. Police
today said it would be at least six weeks before they questioned her.
However an ANC source made it clear the governing party is in no mood
to wait for police action.
''Because she cannot be sacked without any proof that she is guilty
our only available option is to advise her it will be in her best
interests to resign,'' he said.
Mrs Mandela has grass-roots support in the ANC owing to her militant
calls for blacks to benefit at the expense of whites after apartheid.
However her recent behaviour has become an increasing embarrassment to
Mandela and the ANC.
In recent weeks, she was reprimanded by her husband for criticising
his government for moving too slowly on reforms. She was reportedly
nearly sacked until she publicly apologised.
Meanwhile, half the board of the ANC Women's League she heads
resigned, complaining of high-handed leadership.
Mrs Mandela's marriage gave her special status for years, but she has
grown increasingly isolated since their 1992 separation.
She was convicted of kidnapping in 1991 in connection with the
beatings of four young men by her bodyguards. One of the victims was
later found dead.--AP/Reuter.

New Delhi, Thursday
THE Indian Government, bowing to environmentalists who claim pollution
is destroying the Taj Mahal, announced a 10-point to help save one of
the world's most famous monuments.
The programme calls for 100,000 trees to be planted to soak up
pollutants and for cleaner fuels to be introduced in a 4015 sq mile area
around the glittering white marble mausoleum in the northern city of
Agra.
Indianoil will spend #216m to cut back on emissions from a refinery 28
miles from the Taj Mahal, Petroleum Minister Satish Sharma told a news
conference.
However the government plan stopped short of demands by
environmentalists that the refinery and more than 2300 other industries,
including iron foundries and glass works, move out of the region.
Experts say pollution has created ''marble cancer'' which is slowly
destroying the domed monument Mughal emperor Shah Jahan built after the
death of his much-loved second wife, Mumtaz, in the 17th century.
''It is a good step, but that is not the solution,'' said Mahesh
Chandra Mehta, who has led the fight to clean up the air around the Taj.
''All industries should be shifted outside the area.''
The Taj, 125 miles south of New Delhi, attracts 1.5 million tourists a
year, one-third of them foreign. Environmentalists argue that its
destruction would lead to the loss of huge amounts of valuable foreign
exchange.
Under the plan, the government will provide liquified petroleum gas to
all households in a wide area around Agra called the Taj Trapezium.
LPG produces less pollution than the coal, kerosene, or firewood,
which are used in most homes in the region.
LPG and natural gas will be supplied to industries, and unleaded
petrol will be available by next month on the heavily travelled highway
linking Agra and New Delhi, the plan says. Low-lead petrol will be
introduced in the Taj Trapezium in September.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
Palermo, Sicily, Thursday
A JUDGE tonight ordered former Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti
to stand trial in Sicily on charges of being a member of the Mafia.
Judge Agostino Gristina issued his ruling in Palermo after six hours
of legal argument.
The trial of the politician who was a pillar of Italy's political
class for half a century will start on September 26.
Andreotti, 76, seven times Prime Minister, becomes the most senior
Italian official to face trial on Mafia charges.
Prosecutors have built their case around evidence from Mafia turncoats
and former members of Andreotti's scandal-ridden Christian Democrat
party.
The trial could probe deeper into the alleged bonds between the Mafia
and the Christian Democrats, which dominated Italy's post-war politics
until corruption probes wiped it out last year.
Andreotti, currently a senator-for-life who has waived his
parliamentary immunity from prosecution, denies the Mafia claims and
takes credit for leading a crusade to cripple the Mob.
He insists he is the victim of a vendetta designed to discredit his
five decades in politics.
Andreotti later called the judge's decision to send him for trial
''unjustified''.
''It is with sadness that I will face an unjustified trial. I thought
a mortifying two-year wait would have sufficed to establish the truth,''
he said.
''The only advantage of a trial is that it allows the witness to be
examined and cross-examined,'' he added.
One of the main Mafia informers in the case told prosecutors that
Andreotti gave reputed ''boss of bosses'' Salvatore Riina the
traditional Mafia kiss of respect in 1987. Others claim Andreotti gave
wedding gifts to mobsters and at least one alleged Mafia boss called him
''Uncle Giulio''.
Prosecutors say they intend to prove Andreotti was not a man of the
government but a boss of the Cosa Nostra.
He was not in the Palermo court for today's ruling and has not
attended any of the previous hearings.
The charges boil down to an allegation of a pact between two powerful
groups, each with something to gain.
Prosecutors say the Mafia guaranteed Andreotti's party votes and
political control of the island, and benefited in return by having a
friend at the top. Andreotti, in turn, made sure authorities went easy
on the Mafia and funnelled lucrative government contracts to mob-run
companies, they say.
Several other former Italian premiers have been convicted or
investigated for corruption. One, Bettino Craxi, fled to his villa in
Tunisia and refuses to return to Italy to face charges that include
accepting bribes.--AP/Reuter.

Los Angeles, Thursday
THE Grammys, the music industry's highest awards took on a ''something
old, something new'' aspect as pop newcomer Sheryl Crow won the award
for record of the year and veteran crooner Tony Bennett walked off with
the best album award.
Bennett, 67, who started his career as a singing waiter 50 years ago,
won with an ''Unplugged'' album for MTV.
''This is the greatest moment in my whole musical career. The greatest
moment in my life,'' he said.
The white-haired crooner is no stranger to the Grammys, having won his
first in 1962 for I Left My Heart in San Francisco.
It was also a vintage year with the Rolling Stones as double winners,
with best short video in Love is Strong and best rock album with Voodoo
Lounge.
Crow, who burst on the music scene last year with a string of hits,
was also voted best new artist and won a third Grammy for best female
pop vocal performance, all for her song All I Wanna Do.
British superstar Elton John won best male pop vocal performance for
the love song from The Lion King movie, Can You Feel the Love Tonight.
That hit, together with Circle of Life from the same film, were both
up for song of the year, but lost out to Streets of Philadelphia by
veteran rocker Bruce Springsteen.
Springsteen won the most Grammys, taking four for Streets of
Philadelphia as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences
presented its 37th Annual Awards, but he was denied record of the year
by Crow.
As well as song of the year, Springsteen won best male rock
performance, best rock song, and best TV or movie song for Streets of
Philadelphia, the theme song of the film about Aids which brought Oscars
last year for him and for star Tom Hanks.
Springsteen expressed his appreciation to ''the folks who have come up
to me in restaurants or on the street who've lost their sons or their
lovers or their friends to Aids and said this song meant something to
them''.
Bonnie Raitt won the best pop album category with Longing in Their
Hearts, best rock instrumental went to Pink Floyd for Marooned, and
Aerosmith took the best rock performance by a duo or group with Crazy.
The awards show was broadcast on CBS, and organisers estimated the
event would be seen by 1.4 billion people in 104 countries around the
world.--Reuter.

IF THE protesters in Pollok Park succeeded in their campaign against
the construction of the M77, ''they would be responsible for further
deaths and accidents which could and should be avoided,'' Mr George
Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, said yesterday.
He was speaking after receiving from the Scottish Office statistics
for the past five years which he said confirmed that the A77, which the
motorway is designed to largely replace, was indeed ''Scotland's killer
road.''
The figures showed that over that period 39 people had died in
accidents on the 130km of the A77.
This compared with 35 on the 128 km of the A74-M74 and 38 on the 159km
of the A96 (Aberdeen to Inverness) both of which, Mr Foulkes said, had
been branded killer roads.
The MP said ''There is no doubt from these figures that the A77 is
Scotland's most dangerous road.''
He added: ''This underlines the urgency of the construction of the
M77, which will improve road safety dramatically.''

A Dundee woman lost two years of treatment for breast cancer, leading
to fears that expertise is let down by paperwork
THE discovery that Scotland's Breast Cancer Screening Service is being
let down by the paperwork is a shock they and their patients could well
do without.
The Forrest Report which recommended the setting up of a national
breast screening service for women aged 50-64 concluded that it could
reduce mortality by at least one third.
Other evidence puts the potential as high as 40%, assuming that 100%
of the eligible population attended for screening.
The Scottish service's target is less ambitious and perhaps more
realistic. Given a 70% uptake, they hope to reduce mortality by 25% by
the year 2000.
But even that target is already being bedevilled by a reluctance on
the part of some women to accept their three-yearly invitation to attend
for mammography at one of the country's seven screening and assessment
centres.
Some women find the process uncomfortable, perhaps even painful, but
it seems a minor consideration set against an annual death toll of
26,000 cases and 1280 deaths. But in some areas, particularly in cities,
as few as half of those invited for screening take up the opportunity.
Dr Alastair Kirkpatrick, director of the South-east Scotland Service,
said: ''We can take one of our two mobile units to, say, Newcastleton in
the Borders, and the response will be 90%. In the Easter Road area it is
only 50%.
''You really see the benefit when you look at the populations a whole;
from the individual's point of view, a woman who has had her life saved
will naturally be enthusiastic. For the rest the benefit isn't so
obvious.''
All the more reason, then, for women to have the utmost confidence in
the system, rather than the fear that all the effort and technical
expertise will be let down by the paperwork.
In Scotland 430,000 women fall into the 50-64 age group who are being
invited for breast screening at three-yearly intervals. In addition
women over 65 are eligible, though they are not specifically invited.
That means around 3000 sets of mammogram films are passing through the
system every week, each one read independently by two radiologists who
mark up each form for review -- if there is something suspicious -- or
for routine recall in three years.
The Dundee centre has a catchment of some 40,000, so they are likely
to be handling about 270-300 sets a week.
Reading these X-ray films and trying to spot the early signs of a
tumour is a skilled and exacting job. Reading the completed form that
goes with it is hardly in the same league, but there are about 60
different entries to be made by screening staff at various levels,
starting with the patient's name and previous history and moving on
through the number of the X-ray machine and processor, and details of
the exposure involved.
This is the kind of routine red tape that comes into its own when a
technical fault is discovered at some time in the future and records
have to be checked back.
In the meantime the crucial boxes are the ones filled in by the two
radiologists indicating a normal scan, a review because of symptoms, or
a review because of an abnormal scan.
If a woman has to be recalled for further examination there are six
other forms which may come into play. Like the first form, they fit
comfortably into an A4 page and the entries are made in little boxes
which obviously anticipate transfer into a computer. In the midst of
this modern data pathway the intervening process described in Dundee as
a ''transcription error in the logbook'' has a quaint ring.
The error and the system which allowed it to happen are of a different
nature from the cervical smear test debacle which led to 20,000 smear
tests in Inverclyde having to be re-checked last year. The failings were
not in processing the paperwork but in the quality of inspection of the
slides.
By contrast the nationally-run Breast Screening Service has prided
itself from the outset on technical excellence, a fact underlined in
January when the Department of Health announced a package of measures to
improve the quality of the service in England and Wales.
Among the improvements is a higher level of optical density in the
X-ray films, which will make them easier to read. This has been standard
in Scotland for two years.
The DoH is awaiting the results of studies to determine whether
double-reading should be made standard. Two radiologists reading each
slide has been the norm in Scotland from the outset.
The Scottish service is also examining the possibility of a second
view of each breast -- straight up-and-down as well as oblique, as at
present -- and this is expected to become standard practice.
Other issues remain, however, and may not be so easy to resolve. One
is whether the interval should be cut from three years to two; another,
the question of what can be done for women under 50. Although they are
less at risk than older women, breast cancer still kills about 30 women
a year in the 35-44 age group.
Dr Kirkpatrick said: ''The fact always quoted is that it is much more
difficult to see abnormalities because there is more dense fat in the
younger breast. How real that is I am not entirely sure.
''We are running a trial in which we have been screening women aged
from 40 onwards, but to demonstrate that a substantial lowering of the
age limit would reduce mortality would need a huge trial; I think people
will argue about it for a long time.''

THE two daytime passenger trains to Europe from Scotland will start
from Glasgow when the service is introduced.
The services to Paris and Brussels, with an 8 hour 15 minute journey
time to Paris, were to start in Edinburgh.
Now Eurostar, the operator, says the trains will begin in the west
before crossing to Edinburgh and using the east coast line. No start has
been given and ''early next year'' is as firm a date as Eurostar will
give.
Another service, overnight, will start as originally planned from
Glasgow, going down the slower west coast line but, instead of having
designated portions for Paris and Brussels, which would have separated
later, will go only to Paris.
At present, Eurostar's 186mph trains run only from London Waterloo
through the Channel Tunnel to Paris and Brussels. The links further
north had been due to start before the end of this year but the train
manufacturers say they will be delivered late.
Eurostar says overnight trains to Paris will run from more centres
than planned -- to and from Glasgow, Carlisle, Lancaster, Preston,
Plymouth, Newton Abbot, Exeter, Salisbury, Basingstoke, Woking, Swansea,
Cardiff, Newport, Bristol Temple Meads, Bath, Swindon, Didcot, Reading,
Manchester Piccadilly, Stockport, Crewe, Stafford, Wolverhampton,
Birmingham New Street, Birmingham International, and Coventry.

THE woman who accused TV star Craig Charles and his friend of
subjecting her to a gang rape ordeal prevented them from having forensic
evidence which would clear them, a jury heard yesterday.
The 38-year-old former Soho stripper has alleged the actor in the cult
BBC2 comedy Red Dwarf arrived at her flat with company director John
Peploe and a third man -- who has not been traced -- and asked her to
have sex with his two friends.
When she refused, the Liverpool-born star allegedly tied her up,
blindfolded her, and encouraged one of his friends to rape her. She was
also sexually abused, she told Southwark Crown Court.
Mr Charles, 30, of Kennington, and Mr Peploe, 36, of Camberwell, both
south London, deny a joint charge of rape and four joint counts of
indecent assault on July 8 last year.
On the ninth day of the trial, yesterday, Miss Jill Evans, counsel for
Mr Peploe, said lack of forensic evidence in the case was important.
Police were not to blame for a 30-hour delay before the woman was seen
by doctors.
A doctor had been found within seven hours of her making the
allegations but she refused to be taken there by police, saying ''she
was hungry, tired, and wanted to go home to sleep'', said Miss Evans.
''It was her actions which removed the possibility of finding whatever
evidence there might have been.''
The woman, who has not been named for legal reasons, had made
''outrageous'' allegations against the two men.
''But because no-one looked at her, no medical examination took place
on that day, they can't prove a negative. She is responsible for that
evidence not being available.''
The woman had given a ''graphic'' account of her ordeal but there was
no trace of semen stains on the carpet or her clothing or anywhere else
in the flat where she said they would be.
''The only conclusion from the scientific evidence in this case is
that the woman was not telling the truth,'' said Miss Evans.
She appealed to the jury of four men and eight women to consider the
effect of the allegations on Mr Peploe, a married businessman with a
young daughter.
''We have heard a lot about Mr Charles during this trial but two
people are on trial -- one famous, one person is ordinary who has a
company, has a wife, has a daughter.''
The trial was adjourned until today, when Judge Michael Harris said he
would send the jury out to consider their verdicts.

OF ALL the reasons offered by those who engage in fox and stag hunting
for their participation in the ''sport'', the one that they are least
willing to admit to is that they take part in this sadistic activity
because they enjoy the thrill of the kill.
And sadistic it certainly is. In a fox hunt the terrified animal is
usually chased for hours on end until it is utterly exhausted. If it
makes it to its lair the hunters will proceed to dig it out. This
process can take up to four hours. Once the animal is unearthed it is
shot and then torn apart.
Many hunts are engaged in the annual activity of ''cubbing'' with the
aim of teaching new hounds the business. A huntsman goes with hounds to
where he knows there is a vixen with four or five cubs. The vixen will
hide the cubs in what she considers safety underground and then nobly
breaks cover to distract the hounds. After engaging in a very short
chase to teach the young hounds what happens when you are hunting across
a field, they are recalled and allowed to rip the cubs to pieces.
In the hectic weeks since I announced that I was putting forward a
Private Member's Bill to outlaw cruelty to wild animals I have been
besieged by outraged hunters who claim that their motives are
misunderstood. They are, they claim, more like rural social workers,
dedicated to benefiting the rural community by helping to keep down the
fox population, thereby protecting farmers and their stock.
The reality is that when you strip away all the excuses you are left
with the fact that they hunt because they enjoy the pursuit of an
exhausted and petrified animal and enjoy watching it being dismembered
before their eyes. For me, this fits the description of depravity.
The claim by hunt enthusiasts that hunting is necessary to keep the
fox population down is also bogus. A recent report by Oxford
University's Wild Life Conservation Research Unit clearly states that
hunting is largely undertaken for sport rather than for control purposes
and that it is an ineffective method of controlling fox numbers.
The hunting fraternity also greatly exaggerate the damage that foxes
do. Another recent study in the Highlands has revealed that only 1% of
sheep deaths are attributable to foxes. In any event, there are other,
more humane methods of control available.
The public revulsion to inflicting deliberate cruelty on wild animals
is evidenced by the tremendous support my Bill has received from all
sections of society. There is no doubt that the public are outraged at
the barbaric activities of the huntsmen.
A recent poll showed that 93% want their MPs to support the Bill. Two
hundred thousand letters and postcards in support have poured in. There
is also widespread support from MPs of all political persuasions,
including Sir Teddy Taylor and Margaret Ewing.
Many Liberal Democrats are also prepared to vote for my Bill today and
are passionate on the subject. It is regrettable that Sir David Steel
and Menzies Campbell have taken the opposite view, despite the fact that
the outlawing of fox and stag hunting is Liberal Democrat policy.
The hunt enthusiasts claim that opposition to their so-called sport
only comes from ''townies'' who do not understand country ways, but the
polls clearly show that 60% of the people in rural areas also want to
see hunting banned.
Most country people are opposed to fox and stag hunting. It is only
favoured by a small clique who cause tremendous inconvenience and stress
to others in the countryside. Horses, sheep and goats are usually
terrified by the hunt and are frequently injured trying to escape the
baying hounds who charge across the countryside, heedless of the damage
they do to others.
Many farmers are outraged at the constant acts of trespass. Traffic is
also frequently disrupted, because hounds refuse to recognise the Green
Cross Code when chasing a fox and will charge across main roads and
railway tracks in pursuit of their quarry.
If the hunt enthusiasts mean what they say when they claim that
terrifying and killing their quarry isn't the essential enjoyment of the
activity, then they have an alternative. Drag hunting, where an
artificially-scented bait is followed by the hounds, has increased
greatly in recent years and there is no reason why hunters shouldn't
switch to this activity.
The fact that many are reluctant to do so gives the lie to the claim
that what they enjoy about the hunt is the colour and the spectacle and
a good day's exercise in the open air; it shows that what they would
miss is the cruelty and the blood.

FINE artist, designer, and teacher, Mr Bob Stewart, has died. He was
70.
He received his diploma from Glasgow School of Art in 1946 and, only
three years later, took on the stewardship of its textile department. In
1979, he was made deputy director of the school.
It was then he also established the unique MA Design course that
enabled graduate students from various disciplines to come together
creatively and work in a new way.
His successful fine art and design career also continued. His life was
a constant search for visual excitement and sheer pleasure in visual
design.
It is impossible not to personalise any account of this remarkable
man; he had such a huge influence on my working life and remained one of
my dearest friends.
A devoted family man, he lived with his wife Sheila and six children
in a home built by themselves on the shores of Loch Strivenside.
The legacy of Bob Stewart's teaching will survive through the many
students who had the privilege of studying with him. Scotland has lost a
great artist and, for many of us, a great friend and mentor.

HUGH Cochrane, journalist's journalist, broadcaster, former Herald
columnist and the man who brought the art of passionate precision to
Scottish current affairs, has died, aged 63, after a long illness.
Journalism was his life and he lived it to the full. It was a career
track he had pursued relentlessly from the age of 15. Discovering that
he knew nobody who could tell him how to become a newspaperman, he went
boldly into the front hall of the old Evening Times in Buchanan Street
to demand a job.
His brash enthusiasm paid off when he was allowed on to the bottom
rung of the fourth estate's ladder as a copy-boy.
Hugh himself once recalled that he almost failed his entrance test. He
had been asked to spell two words to prove his suitability as a future
hack. The first was a skoosh case. The second was accommodation and he
got it wrong. It was a word which he never spelled correctly from that
day.
Always impeccably dressed, and usually sporting natty if somewhat loud
waistcoats, he came across to the uninitiated as a somewhat aloof and
distant intellectual. Nothing could have been further from the truth.
He often used words and phrases which had colleagues scurrying for the
dictionary.
He had a razor-sharp, if rather dour, sense of humour and a fund of
tales based on personal experience.
The peak of an outstanding professional career probably came during a
six-year stint with BBC Scotland. As front man for the Current Account
programme, he turned out an outstanding documentary on the sad,
compelling story of the losing battle for Upper Clyde Shipbuilders.
Hugh's humble baptism in the profession as a copy-boy was only the
start of a panoramic rise through the ranks. From the Evening Times, he
was sent to earn his spurs as a trainee reporter on the Kilmarnock
Standard.
Three years later, he returned to Glasgow to a desk job on the old
Noon Record. Within five months, he crossed the great divide to apply
his talents to the Scotsman.
Eight years as the London Times's Man in Scotland followed. The Herald
was next. Here he covered politics, the oil industry, and found time to
launch the occasional burst of measured and pungent comment on the
tomfoolery of those in power.
Hugh's passing leaves a gap in Scottish journalism that will be
impossible to fill. He was one of the last of the old-time, truly
free-spirited professionals.
He is survived by his wife, Noreen, and by a son and daughter from a
previous marriage.

IN the Commons yesterday, like the day after any great battle, some
still were savouring the sweetness of victory; others the bitterness of
defeat.
The provost-marshal's men were rounding up deserters. The conduct of
the various fighting units was being assessed. The losers were
suggesting the winners had secured only a pyrrhic victory.
The most famous deserter sat defiantly in his place, although he
imposed upon himself the discipline of asking neither the Chancellor nor
the Prime Minister one of those awkward questions which had been his
recent trademark.
One Tory colleague, Colonel Nigel Forman, observed that: ''All of us,
except one Right Honourable Gentleman, were completely convinced by the
clarification provided by the Prime Minister.''
General Lamont sat slightly slumped, as Napoleon might have sat after
Waterloo.
A studious man, Colonel Forman is less given to exaggeration than many
in his line of work. But he must have known that several of the other
ranks who filed through the Government lobby had been a good deal less
than completely convinced by what Lt-General Robin Cook had wittily
described as ''a passionate speech for the Don't Knows.''
Field-Marshal Major has decided not to order the firing squad for his
old comrade-in- arms, and indeed General Lamont might well prefer
splendid near-isolation amid the Tory ranks rather than succumbing to
the blandishments offered him by Labour left-wingers who have some
experience of deserting the colours themselves. Private Dennis Skinner
put up a sign ''for Lamont'' on the front Opposition bench below the
gangway where sit the men who, when Labour is in power, are most likely
to see the inside of the glasshouse.
A Tory skirmisher, Lieutenant Peter Bottomley, snatched it in a brief
sortie but Private Skinner drew on his reserves and another sign
appeared.
Suspecting that Generalissimo Blair is unlikely to hand him a Labour
Cabinet Minister's baton, General Lamont sat tight, possibly working out
his retreat from Kingston-upon-Thames -- where his position will soon
become untenable -- to a redoubt in North Yorkshire where Europe remains
simply a geographical expression.
Some of the divisional commanders serving under Field-Marshal Major
have long been known to be critical of his strategy and though victory
was gained it was, as another famous commander remarked, ''A damned
close run thing.''
One who is known to have doubts about a referendum being the best last
line of defence is General Clarke. In a brutal offensive. General Gordon
Brown fired back several of his old shells at him reminding that he had
once said that those who thought the people wanted a referendum were
''slightly up the creek.''
General Clarke laid down a barrage of flannel in a fighting retreat
but felt obliged to admit that his commander had ''left open''the
question of a referendum.
Just how far up the creek that left the Field- Marshal was unclear,
but, wherever, it was General Clarke has reluctantly agreed to accompany
him, with or without a paddle.
Brigadier (Robert) Maclennan of the Third Force Division who are
rumoured to get high on Euro-drug before going into battle, asked the
Iron Prime Minister what punishment he would be meting out to the
traitor who had in earlier times helped him plan the campaign that
brought him fame.
The duke said that what was getting to the brigadier was that he had
won. (huzzas from the troops.)
The serried ranks opposite responded with the roar of troops who may
have lost a battle but still feel confident they will win the war.

LARNACA: Pre-trial moves in Cyprus in which the defence are seeking

Procedural wrangles unprecedented in local legal history are delaying
the trial of Privates Alan Ford, 26, of Birmingham, Justin Fowler, 26,
of Falmouth, Cornwall, and Jeff Pernell, 23, of Oldbury, West Midlands,
who have made 18 court appearances since their arrest on September 13
but have yet to enter pleas to charges of manslaughter.
Defence lawyers secured a pre-trial hearing by arguing that warders
had violated the trio's constitutional rights by confiscating written
notes intended for their defence. If the criminal court rules there was
a breach of rights, the case could be dropped.

LADY Elizabeth Smith, widow of Labour leader John Smith, was appointed
chairman of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe yesterday.
She was approached to take over the role by out-going chairman
Jonathan Miller, who held the post for 11 years.
Lady Elizabeth agreed to take over the job as they watched Miller's
production of Cosi Fan Tutte at the Royal Opera House in London at the
turn of the year.
She met staff at the Fringe office in Edinburgh's High Street
yesterday and said she was looking forward to ''having some fun'' in her
new role.
''It's clear they are a very friendly and lively bunch of people I
will be working with,'' she said.
Mr Miller, who will now become the Fringe's honorary president, said
they were unbelievably fortunate to have Lady Elizabeth as the new
chairman.
Fringe director Hilary Strong said Lady Elizabeth, who was appointed
to the Lords as Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill last week, would bring ''a
local perspective to the role''.
Mrs Strong said: ''People in Edinburgh and, in fact, Scotland must
feel it is their festival -- not run by outsiders who march into town
and leave.
''Lady Elizabeth brings a local as well as national and international
perspective to the role.
''She lives in Edinburgh and has a place in the House of Lords. She
has also expressed an interest in funding for the arts.
''She will listen, hear, and contribute to the whole debate on all
forms of the arts.
''Lady Elizabeth is also an extremely nice, warm person, who we want
to work with. We look forward to her taking the festival forward into
the next millennium.''
She added that she hoped this year's Fringe would, for the first time,
break #1m in box office takings.
The Fringe's international officer Melissa Naylor said Lady
Elizabeth's strong cultural connections as vice-chairman of the
Britain-Russia Centre would be invaluable in attracting groups from
abroad.

<HEADLINE>The kind of snow that is hard to shift Not so rush-hour for commuters in planes, trains, and automobiles</HEADLINE>

A NEW excuse can be added to the litany which follows Scotland
grinding to a standstill after a snowfall.
Conscientious people, determined to reach their places of work, stood
accused of contributing to yesterday's rush-hour chaos on the roads.
Apparently their cars had compressed the snow so tightly that any salt
which had been put down by gritters ''could not do its job properly''.
Thousands of train and aircraft passengers fared little better than
motorists during the morning rush hour, experiencing delays of up to 90
minutes on normal journey times.
Others, including Mr Lex Gold, director of the Confederation of
British Industry in Scotland, remained stranded at home because side
roads were impassable or main roads were snarled or blocked by
accidents.
Glasgow Airport shut for an hour, and three hours passed before the
railway network returned to normal after a series of points' failures.
A Railtrack spokesman said the points, when changing, resemble
windscreen wipers, and the snow fell so quickly and heavily that they
became trapped, causing signals to turn red. The points have heaters,
but not strong enough to melt the snow.
The 7.42 from Edinburgh to Glasgow, which should take 50 minutes,
arrived in Glasgow more than two hours later, at 9.50.
Strathclyde Regional Council's roads department was geared up for the
snow, well flagged by its own, new early-warning computer system and by
Glasgow Weather Centre.
However, one motorist from Bishopbriggs still took two-and-a-half
hours for a 25-minute journey to the Western Infirmary, with 90 minutes
alone taken to cover just over a mile during rush-hour.
On crossing the Glasgow City boundary, he left behind treacherous
hard-packed ice and snow. ''A lot of people in Bishopbriggs are asking,
'Why the difference, when we also pay council tax to Strathclyde?' ''
Mr Alex McArthur, assistant director of roads, said men had been
deployed from 4pm on Wednesday to combat the snow forecast. Roads were
gritted overnight, and cleared of snow by 6am.
However, more fell half-an-hour later. Mr McArthur said: ''Its
intensity coincided with the rush-hour. The traffic packed that snow,
which meant the salt could not attack it . . .The roads were prepared.
It was an unfortunate set of circumstances.''
He said it would have been pointless to send out ploughs to break up
the hard-packed snow because the vehicles would have been stuck in the
traffic jams.
More than 400 men and 210 gritting machines were involved in clearance
operations, later supplemented by a similar-sized workforce supplied by
district councils, contractors, and even farmers.
Mr McArthur said that between one and six inches of snow built up
throughout the region over a short time, which meant little could be
done. His department had ''known the snow was coming but not when it
would hit, what intensity it would be, and it varied throughout the
region''.
The priority had been to keep main roads, including motorways, open,
followed by bus routes, and access to hospitals and police, fire, and
aumbulance services.
There are nine categories in all, down to private roads. Access to
isolated villages come fifth, and side roads, including housing estates,
seventh. Their chance of clearance is slim as gritters return to main
roads when necessary.
A Strathclyde spokesman stressed that resources were not a problem.
The winter maintenance budget has consistently increased in recent
years. Costs are not a problem, under a statutory obligation to clear
roads regardless of having spent the budget or not. It stands at #10.3m.
Glasgow Weather Centre underlined the severity of the blizzards, which
hit twice, by pointing out that snow lay even in Sauchiehall Street.
Elsewhere, the west of Scotland was blanketed, although only two roads
closed, both in the Largs area. Erskine Bridge closed after an accident
and a breakdown.
An AA spokeswoman said gritters lost the battle only because the snow
covered such a wide area and continued into the rush-hour. She added:
''I believe a million gritters would have been unable to clear it. They
worked as hard as they could with the resources they had.''
Mr Alasdair Phillips, the RAC's operations manager who has criticised
Strathclyde gritters in the past, said: ''We could not fault them. It
was the conditions as much as anything else, with snow dumped over the
whole region.'' He said the low number of accidents suggested the roads'
department ''had got its act together''.
ScotRail reported delays of up to 90 minutes for commuters on many
services including Glasgow-Edinburgh and southbound trains from
Aberdeen, Inverness, Perth, and Dunblane because of a points' failure at
Greenhill junction, near Falkirk, which also hit Stirlingshire services.
Services throughout Ayrshire and Lanarkshire suffered similar delays.
A Railtrack spokesman said some staff walked up to four miles to reach
points because roads were blocked.
At Glasgow Airport, London-bound Shuttle flights faced one-hour delays
from 7.30am to 9am as snow was cleared. Nine inbound flights were
diverted to Prestwick and Edinburgh.
Forecasters believe more widespread snowfalls are on the way and
commuters may face even worse journeys today.
* Motorists whose vehicles broke down early last night had to wait
slightly longer than normal for help from the AA: its Scottish
Operations Centre in Erskine near Paisley was temporarily closed as a
result of a small fire, started when a potato was being cooked in a
microwave oven.
* Two searches for four missing climbers, all from Sheffield, were
called off after the parties turned up safe and well.
The first pair, Margaret Gallagher, 37, and 44-year-old Peter Lewis,
were reported overdue after parking their car on a local farm in
Dalmally, near Oban, and heading into the hills on Tuesday. A mountain
rescue team and Navy helicopter were yesterday sent to the area, but the
couple walked off the hill several hours later. Similarly two climbers
feared missing on Ben Nevis turned up at the base of the mountain as
rescue team members were flown by the RAF to the summit.

PRESIDENT of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine was criticised last
night for allowing the export of tanks to Indonesia.
Coventry-based Alvis has been given an export licence, allowing an
order for Scorpion tanks and light amoured vehicles to go ahead.
Pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade said it was ''horrified''.
Spokeswoman Sue Brown said: ''We are appalled that Mr Heseltine is
allowing military exports to a regime which has an appalling record on
human rights. We shall be mounting a campaign against this decision.
''Similar tanks have been used to repress peaceful demonstrations in
the country.''
However, Mr Heseltine, announcing the authorisation in a Commons
written reply, said: ''The decision has been made in the light of the
internationally agreed criteria for military exports.''
He said the Indonesian government had given assurances that the
vehicles will not be deployed in East Timor nor used in any form of
repression of civilians anywhere in Indonesia.
* MPs from both sides have signed a motion calling for a moratorium on
the export of anti-personnel land mines.
Thousands of people have been killed and injured by the mines. An
estimated four million have been laid in Cambodia alone which have
killed and injured 30,000 in recent years.
Liberal Democrat David Alton (Mossley Hill), one of the signatories,
said the mines caused immense suffering long after wars finished.

NEW-BORN Iona McMurtrie and James Jones and their mothers yesterday
helped launch a scheme to make it easy for Lothian parents to keep
accurate medical histories of their children.
Mrs Catherine McMurtrie and Mrs Helen Jones, both of Edinburgh, were
issued with copies of a 60-page record book in which they can enter key
facts about their children's health and development.
The book includes pages to be filled in by health service
professionals attending to a child.
The scheme, launched at Edinburgh's Simpson Memorial Maternity
Pavilion, where Iona and James were born on Wednesday, follows a
successful pilot project in West Lothian in 1992.
Entitled Parents As Partners, it aims to encourage parents to work
with doctors, nurses, and health visitors for the benefit of their
children throughout their early years when the availability of
meticulously-kept medical records can prove valuable and often vital.
The books will include family history, birth details, immunisations,
growth records, and other important facts.
Parents will be urged to take the books on any hospital, surgery, or
clinic visits.
Dr Helen Zealley, Lothian's public health director, said: ''This
scheme acknowledges the importance of parents as the lead partners in
the health and well-being of their children.
''It will mean that a mother or father will know exactly what has
happened to their child from a medical point of view, and so will
doctors who may be seeing the young patient for the first time.''
It is hoped the records will also be passed on to children so they
could produce them to doctors and hospitals in later years, no matter
where they were.

A Gallup survey in today's Daily Telegraph puts Labour at 60.2%, with
the Tories trailing on just 20.2% -- one of their lowest ratings on
record -- and the Liberal Democrats in third place on 15%.
Labour's lead is up four points since a Gallup poll last month, while

<TEXT>
NEARLY #6m worth of fraud was recorded in Scotland in the second half
of 1994, more than three times the amount of the first half, according
to a firm of accountants.
The increase was attributable almost entirely to alleged embezzlement
by legal and financial advisers, say accountants KPMG.
Although the figures are based merely on cases reported in the media,
it was felt to be a worrying trend, particularly as the victims were
often members of the public who had placed their trust in such advisers.
Across the UK, however, Scotland came out best amongst cases of
reported fraud involving more than #100,000.
The South-east of England was the worst hit area, with 36 cases.
Scotland had only four such cases.
The head of KPMG's fraud investigation, Mr Ian Huntingdon, said 1994
had also been a bad year for mortgage lenders. ''Charges for mortgage
fraud, obtaining mortgages by deception, reached a new high of #109m,
including #100m in one major fraud.''

A UNION has claimed the jobs of more than 800 handicapped Scots have
been put at risk by Government inaction.
Mr Phil Davies, an officer of the GMB union, yesterday said workers at
the organisation Remploy feared for their future after new procedures
failed to provide orders for its 96 British factories.
Remploy has ten units in Scotland, employing 866, including 816
disabled people, predominately producing textiles.
Under the previous arrangements, Remploy was informed of the bids by
competitors and was allowed to adjust its tender. Under the present
set-up, that ''second chance'' has been removed, and Remploy has to
operate under normal commercial conditions.
It is awaiting word on multi-million pound textile orders from the
Ministry of Defence but claims of inaction were rejected by the
Department of Employment last night.
Mr Davies said: ''The priority suppliers scheme was scrapped last year
and it appears that the new scheme, the special contracts arrangements
is failing to ensure that Remploy gets new orders.
''Last year, Remploy won #17m of orders for textiles from the Ministry
of Defence but this year, despite the tenders being submitted, no orders
have yet been placed.''
Mr Davies continued: ''When the priority suppliers scheme was in
place, Remploy were assured of orders as they employed disabled workers
but this new system appears to be failing them.''
The Department of Employment, which provides #92m support for Remploy,
denied Mr Davies's claims. It insisted it was untrue to say Remploy had
previously been guaranteed contracts and added that the MoD contract had
not yet been allocated.
Officials from the Department and Remploy are to meet to discuss the
organisation's future and possible diversification into less competitive
markets.
A Remploy spokeswoman in London said: ''We are in limbo right now,
waiting to hear if our offer for the MoD contract has been accepted.
It's true that we are concerned about losing the contract but we prefer
to wait and see what happens before making any decision about the future
of anyone's job.''
She added: ''The MoD contract is just one of many contracts we have
tendered for and only one of our six trading divisions is affected by
it.''
She admitted the procedural switch had made the task of winning
contracts very difficult for the organisation, which ''employed people
who nobody else would give a chance to''.

<HEADLINE>Judge hears of paralysed woman's horrific injuries #350,000 award for nurse in car crash</HEADLINE>

A FORMER nurse who suffered horrific injuries in a car crash has been
awarded interim damages of #350,000 pending a full hearing of her case.
The cash will be used to provide 29-year-old Linda Walker with as much
independence as possible by building and equipping a house for her and
providing suitable transport.
The judge who made the award decided that Miss Walker would almost
certainly win her case, with final damages of almost #1m.
Miss Walker, of Glenburn Terrace, Carluke, Lanarkshire, was a rear
seat passenger in a car being driven by Miss Grace Dunn, of Nairn
Street, Larkhall, in November 1990.
She alleges that the accident on the A91 between Fallin and Manor
Powis in Stirlingshire was caused by the fault and negligence of the
driver, which is disputed.
Miss Walker claims Miss Dunn pulled out to overtake another vehicle
but there was a car coming in the other direction. In an attempt to
avoid the oncoming car, she swerved and her Ford Fiesta left the road.
The car ended up on its roof in a field and Miss Walker was thrown
out. She suffered a fractured vertebra which left her paralysed from the
chest down.
She spent nearly a year in hospital and, because of her permanently
disabling injury, had to give up her job as an auxiliary nurse.
When the case came before temporary judge, Mr John Horsburgh, QC, Miss
Walker asked for interim damages which she hopes will give her as much
independence as possible by providing a specially equipped house and
suitable transport.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, Mr Horsburgh said that in
making an interim award of #350,000 he was satisfied that Miss Walker
would almost certainly succeed in her claim, at least to some extent.
The judge added: ''It is plain . . .that the claim is very substantial
and could be worth at least #1m.''
Counsel for Miss Walker argued that it was a ''near certainty'' that
Miss Walker would succeed in her claim. She was claiming that Miss Dunn
was driving on the wrong side of the road in the face of oncoming
traffic before she swerved and lost control.
She had subsequently pleaded guilty at Stirling Sheriff Court to a
charge of careless driving.
Miss Walker's counsel also argued that her failure to wear a seat
belt, which was not a legal requirement for back seat passengers at the
time, would not result in a substantial finding of contributory
negligence.

From PATRICK BROGAN Washington, Thursday
THE balanced budget amendment went down to defeat in the Senate this
afternoon, winning 66 votes out of 100, one short of the two-thirds
majority it needed to pass.
It dealt the Republican majority its first defeat and made the dispute
a presidential campaign issue.
The Republican leader, Senator Bob Dole, switched his vote from aye to
nay at the last minute in a procedural move that only underscored the
high stakes and tricky manoeuvring in play.
Under Senate rules, that aligned Dole with the winning side and
enables him to bring the issue up for a vote again whenever he wants.
Dole, who is also the early front-runner for the 1996 Republican
presidential nomination, hopes to hang it like an albatross around the
Democrats' neck before the next election, accusing them of opposing the
principle of balancing the budget.
The Democrats have a comparable ambition, to persuade voters that the
Republicans wanted to balance the budget by cutting Social Security.
Both sides are on to a good thing.
A poll published by the New York Times this week shows 79% of
Americans favour balancing the budget -- but only 32% would do so if it
meant cutting Social Security. The question, therefore, will be one of
perception, and that probably means who can yell loudest.
The Democrats are making the most noise, accusing the Republicans of
wanting to steal from retired Americans to pay off rich ones.
Senator Dole hopes that as the months go by people will forget the
details, and remember only that the Republicans proposed to balance the
budget and the Democrats opposed.
He may well be right. People have short memories, and may blame the
Democrats in 1996 if the deficit is as big as ever, which is entirely
probable.
The proposal was a centrepiece of the Republicans' Contract with
America, the legislative wish list that helped them regain control of
Congress last November, and was the first key Republican initiative
defeated since the new Congress assembled in January.

THE South East Health Service Forum claimed yesterday that consultants
at Mearnskirk Hospital have been told not to admit new patients after
June.
However, Greater Glasgow Health Board maintained no decision has been
made concerning the future of the hospital, which is home for 120
elderly patients.
The forum made its claim when handing in a petition containing more
than 9000 signatures to Sir Robert Calderwood, chairman of Greater
Glasgow Health Board at its Ingram Street HQ.
The Newton Mearns hospital is under offer to a consortium of
house-builders, despite the fact a public consultation period on its
future does not conclude until next Monday.
The closure of the hospital is among the options put out to
consultation as part of the Care in the Community campaign drawn up with
Strathclyde Regional Council. There is also an option to retain a 40-bed
unit for the use of long-stay care.
However, Mrs Margaret Hinds, chairman of the forum, believes the
decision to close has already been taken.
She said: ''A source has told us that there will be no new patients
admitted after June. So what is the point of having a consultation and
our group collecting over 9000 signatures?''
A spokesperson for Greater Glasgow Health Board said: ''As far as I
can establish, there is no truth in their statement. It is also wrong to
say that Mearnskirk Hospital will close. No decision has been made.''
The campaign to save the hospital gained support when Mr Allan
Stewart, MP for Eastwood, attended a public meeting at Mearns Cross
Primary School on Saturday. It is understood he signed the petition
which was handed to Sir Robert.
After receiving the petition, Sir Robert said: ''This document will be
added to the other correspondence and studied after the consultation
closes on March 6.''

<HEADLINE>One error means every case since national system started in 1991 has to be reviewed Cancer checks extend to 300,000 women</HEADLINE>

BREAST screening records of more than 300,000 women in Scotland are to
be re-examined in the wake of an error in Dundee in which the system
failed to act on an abnormalilty diagnosed nearly two years ago.
Health officials said the middle-aged woman, now at home and
undergoing radiotherapy after surgery, was ''upset and annoyed'' at the
slip-up. An abnormality was picked up by routine mammogram examination
in February 1993 but, instead of being recalled, she was sent a letter
giving her the all-clear.
The review of the 300,000 cases -- every woman screened since a
national service became available in 1991 -- will check that information
in letters sent to patients corresponds with the original mammogram
logbook and computer entry.
The records of all 40,000 women screened by the East of Scotland
service based at Dundee Royal Infirmary have already been reviewed.
Errors were found in a further five cases but no further cancers have
been identified.
Announcing the review, Health Minister Lord Fraser said: ''I will make
available such resources as are necessary to complete the exercise as
expeditiously as possible.''
The review is expected to take up to three months in order to maintain
the existing screening service for women.
Ms Jan Warner, manager of the Scottish Breast Screening Programme,
said there was no need for women to contact their screening centres.
They would be notified of any irregularities found in the review.
''It is going to be difficult to reassure people and the centres are
already inundated with calls,'' she said.
Ms Warner said women should maintain faith in the Scottish service.
Its detection rate was higher than the UK target. Since its inception,
it had detected 2000 cancers and all women were treated by surgeons at
specialist centres.
She said the experience had shown a weakness which hitherto was not
known. ''We very much regret this and, as a result, all the screening
centres in Scotland and in the UK have been asked to review their
fail-safe procedures,'' Ms Warner added.
The woman was diagnosed as having breast cancer in November last year,
when routine checks of her medical history revealed the error. She
underwent surgery in December but was told of the screening slip-up only
three days ago.
Asked how the woman was now feeling, Dr Alan Cook, director of the
Dundee-based screening service, said: ''She is annoyed and upset. These
are the words I have had from her.''
Doctors have declined to give details of the type of surgery she
underwent or her prognosis, on the grounds of medical confidentiality.
Dr Derek Maclean, medical director of the Dundee Teaching Hospitals
NHS Trust, said it was for this reason and to avoid needless anxiety
among the 40,000 women that there was no publicity for the initial
review.
He said the delay in telling her of the slip-up was to allow her time
to recover from the initial shock of discovering she had cancer. ''That
is medically very sound advice and correct. When any woman is told she
has breast cancer, it is a devastating thing and it takes a long time to
come to terms with it,'' he added.
Dr Maclean said it was clear that in a high-volume screening
operation, human error could not be entirely eliminated, despite
fail-safe procedures. The fault had been a ''transcription error'' in a
logbook. He said all letters were now checked with the original source
material before being sent out.
''Looking back, I think the system has been flawed. We made a
conscious decision at the beginning that we should not have a witch-hunt
against any individual involved,'' he said.
Mrs Audrey Jones, founder chairperson of the Scottish Breast Cancer
Campaign, which has petitioned the Government for improved facilities,
described the slip-up as ''absolutely outrageous'' but welcomed moves to
tighten up procedures.
''We had been expecting something like this to happen because of the
sheer pressure on the staff running the service,'' she said.

THE ''vast sums of money'' currently being paid to Scotland should be
seen as ''the English subscription to the UK'', Mr Jaques Arnold, Tory
MP for Gravesham, said in the Commons yesterday, angering some Scottish
MPs.
He also likened them to a ''transfer payment'' on account of Scotland
and England being part of a single currency area.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Jonathan Aitken said Scotland received
21% more public expenditure than England. That was a consequence of
decisions taken by elected and accountable representatives.
Whether having a single European currency would or would not lead to
higher public spending in some areas ''was one of the very difficult
matters we would have to consider at some stage'' if a proposal came
forward.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said that, in fact, Scotland subsidised
England though its oil to the tune of #20,000 for each man, woman and
child.

Moscow, Thursday
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin today sacked Moscow's police chief and
prosecutor in the wake of the apparent contract murder of a popular and
powerful TV star.
With Russia in shock over what appeared to be a killing with big
business and political overtones, Yeltsin pledged to revive a crusade
against organised crime.
Vladislav Listyev was by far the highest-profile person to be
assassinated in Russia since Yeltsin became president in June 1991 and
his death hammered home the extent to which crime has permeated every
level of society.
The 38-year-old presenter of a popular news talk show, who was also
the key player in the launch next month of a new-look version of
Russia's main television channel, was gunned down last night when he
returned to his Moscow flat.
In a surprise appearance at television headquarters today, Yeltsin,
visibly upset, vowed to beef up the fight against crime and bring the
killers to justice.
He blamed Moscow authorities for the wave of organised crime.
''Because we have been afraid of being accused of turning Russia into a
police state, we have been afraid to step up the fight against
bandits,'' he said.--Reuter.

Mogadishu, Friday
US marines abandoned Mogadishu's beaches early today after firing
heavy bursts of gunfire and flares that lit up the dark city at the end
of two years of bloody foreign military intervention in Somalia.
Eyewitnesses said the marines splashed into the Indian Ocean in
hovercraft and amphibious vehicles, bound for warships offshore. Planes
and attack helicopters covering the withdrawal vanished at the same
time.
A ghostly silence spread over the Somali capital as the US forces and
their ships, made visible by blinking red lights, disappeared over the
horizon.
US and Italian marines completed the ''United Shield'' operation to
cover the evacuation of the last UN troops from Somalia in just three
days.
Foreign military intervention, which began in December 1992, succeeded
in alleviating an appalling famine but failed to end quarrelling between
rival clan militias.
Some prominent Somalis are trying to prevent a return to chaos after
four years of clan feuding, but many fear fighting could break out over
control of Mogadishu airport and port.
Yesterday American marines shot dead two Somalis in an armed
''technical'' jeep. Another Somali who fired a rocket grenade at them on
Wednesday was also shot dead by marine sharpshooters.--Reuter.

MEMBERS of the family of Thomas ''TC'' Campbell will visit him tonight
at Shotts Prison in an effort to persuade him to give up his latest
hunger strike.
Campbell, jailed for life along with Joseph Steel in 1984 for the ice
cream war murders, was taken from his cell at Shotts earlier this week
to the prison hospital, where he is under observation. Campbell has been
refusing food since he was moved back to Shotts on January 10 when the
Barlinnie Special Unit was closed.
Members of his family said yesterday that he had lost more than three
stones in weight. The Scottish Prison Service says the hospital move
will allow him to receive any medical treatment he requires.
His sister, Mrs Agnes Lafferty, said she had last spoken to Campbell
on Monday when he had telephoned to say he was being moved. He had
sounded weak and breathless and had told her his body was now rejecting
practically everything except water.
Campbell has maintained his innocence of the murders of six members of
the Doyle family whose house in Ruchazie was set on fire in 1984. He has
maintained that the key witness at the trial at the High Court in
Glasgow was coerced into perjury by the authorities.
That witness, William Love, has since repeatedly confessed to the
perjury but, last month, the Crown Office dismissed his claims, saying
that there was insufficient reliable evidence to prosecute him. That
effectively condemned Campbell to serve the remaining half of his
minimum 20-year sentence before parole can be considered.
He will be visited for the first time tomorrow in Shotts by his wife
Elizabeth and their three children. After being removed from the
Barlinnie Special Unit, Campbell refused to take off his ''Free the
Glasgow Two'' T-shirt and to wear prison issue clothing, causing the
prison authorities to stop visiting until he conformed.
Mrs Lafferty said: ''Other prisoners have phoned us to say he looks
awful and that he is in a terrible state. If it was left to me, I would
urge him to eat because by starving himself to death he is giving the
authorities exactly what they want. They are going to get rid of the
worst thorn in their side.

EXCLUSIVE By ROBBIE DINWOODIE, Scottish Political Correspondent
THE SNP has set up a special commission chaired by a leading
industrialist, Mr Peter Carmichael, who is not a party member, to plan
for an independent Scottish economy with its own currency.
Policy vice-convener Alex Neil will outline the plans to the party's
national council in Stirling tomorrow. ''We are determined to take the
fears and smears put about by others head-on,'' he said yesterday.
Mr Carmichael, one of Scotland's most respected industrialists, was
joint managing director of Hewlett Packard before a spell as one of the
Scottish Development Agency's most senior executives, and is now
involved in business research.
The other three members of the commission are Professor Chris Harvie
of Tubingen University in Germany, author of No Gods and Precious Few
Heroes: Scotland 1914 -- 1980; SNP vice-president Gordon Wilson; and
financier Ian Blackford, a director of corporate bankers NatWest
Markets.
They in turn will call on an informal network of advisers drawn from
senior figures in the financial services sector. ''They may publish the
occasional paper but their main role is in 12 months or so to produce a
report mapping out the creation of a Scottish currency,'' said Mr Neil.
''They will also produce detailed recommendations for entering a
single European currency, as well as drawing up a framework for the
monetary policy of an independent Scottish government, including its
period of transition. We are therefore updating the detailed work that
took place prior to 1992 in the light of changed circumstances.
''To that end, we will now embark on a consultation exercise involving
small businesses, multinational inward investors, the financial sector,
industry, trade unions, and academics.''
Mr Neil said the commission would:
* Review existing party policy to take account of a possible single
European currency.
* Examine the implications of the timescale for European monetary
union, including the preparation of detailed proposals for interim
arrangements which an independent Scottish government would have to
make.
* Study the implications of the single currency for the Scottish
economy and fiscal policy.
* Prepare detailed recommendations for the establishment of a Scottish
Central Bank and appropriate arrangements for its participation in
appropriate monetary institutions of the European Union.
''We recognise the importance of winning the economic argument because
all the polls show this is the key issue that will tilt the balance in
favour of the independence argument. That is why we are launching our
offensive now,'' said Mr Neil, who is treasury spokesman in the SNP's
Scottish Cabinet.
''People will be better off and overall taxation will be lower because
we would adopt a growth strategy, repatriate 90% of oil revenues, and
make huge savings through an anti-nuclear defence policy and run down
foreign garrisons.
''A new budget is currently being drafted which will show that, in an
independent Scotland, overall taxation will be lower than in the Union,
even with a public sector surplus.
''We are going to take the tax argument head on and say that because
of a growth strategy, oil revenues, and defence cuts, we can achieve
what cannot be done by the UK -- that is a slight reduction in personal
taxation, with a substantial impact on the low paid and small
businesses.''
Mr Neil said the aim was to create an inward investment policy which
targeted research and development, with the aim of making Scotland the
''science capital of Europe'', focusing on micro-technology, medical
research, and electronics.

THREE Hearts fans who fell foul of the law after staying in a pub
drinking all day instead of going to watch their team play an away game
have had to pay a stiff penalty for their ''disgraceful'' behaviour.
The trio were involved in a bar-room brawl which Sheriff William
Christie said yesterday could only be described as ''a Donnybrook''.
Imposing fines and compensation orders totalling #5000, the sheriff
told the fans at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court: ''What went on that day was
beyond belief. It was absolutely dreadful.''
Adding that there was no point in sending them to prison, he warned:
''But you will certainly pay for it.''
The accused, storeman William Scott, 25, Gorgie Road; factory cleaner
Raymond Knox, 31, Greendykes Gardens; and payroll clerk Andrew King, 32,
The Cooperage, The Shore, all Edinburgh, originally pleaded not guilty
along with five other Edinburgh men.
They were all charged after a pitched battle caused #2500 worth of
damage to Oscars pub in Charlotte Street, Kirkcaldy, last March.
Three days into the trial, depute fiscal Elisabeth Miller abandoned
the case against five of the men and the remaining trio tendered pleas
which were accepted by the Crown.
King admitted assaulting Mr Bruce Connelly, c/o Kirkcaldy police
office, seizing him by the clothing and punching his head.
Scott admitted assaulting pub steward Garry Grubb, seizing him,
hitting him on the body with a bar stool, and punching and kicking him
on the head and body.
He also admitted possessing cannabis resin at Kirkcaldy police office
on the same day.
Both Scott and Knox admitted throwing items to the danger of people
and, while acting with others, maliciously throwing bottles, ashtrays,
glasses, stools, chairs and tables and breaking bottles and mirrors on
the gantry and damaging a till.
The court had heard that up to 16 men were involved in a fight with
pub stewards following King's assault on Mr Connelly.
The crowd formed two lines and forced the stewards back by showering
them with glasses and furniture and then smashed up the bar before
running away.
Sheriff Christie had deferred sentence until yesterday for reports.
At the earlier hearing, Knox's agent, Mr George Henry, said the
accused had been in Kirkcaldy to see their team play Raith Rovers, but
had decided to stay in the pub.
Scott was ordered to pay a total of #2550 in fines and compensation;
Knox #2250; and King was fined #200.

BRITAIN's national newspaper and magazine film critics have voted
Kenneth Branagh's performance in his film Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
the worst male performance of 1994. The ALFS, the annual awards of the
members of the London Film Critics' Circle, were presented last night at
a charity gala held in aid of the NSPCC.
The question now is whether Branagh will find this critical abuse as
damaging to his ego as did the recent runaway -- and Branagh's friend --
Stephen Fry, who co-starred in the title role of his film, Peter's
Friends. The award for worst female performance went to Julia Roberts
for The Pelican Brief, and worst film of the year was Bille August's The
House of the Spirits.
The awards are the British equivalent of the Golden Globe and New York
Critics' Circle awards and are presented to winners not by fellow
celebrities but by the critics who voted.
Thus I gave the best actor award to John Travolta for Pulp Fiction.
The best actress award went to Linda Fiorentino for The Last Seduction,
and best film to Schindler's List directed by Steven Spielberg, who was
named director of the year. Best screenwriter was Quentin Tarantino for
Pulp Fiction.
The critics also gave awards to British films and performers. British
actor of the year was Ralph Fiennes for Schindler's List; British
actress was Crissy Rock for Ladybird, Ladybird; and British film was
Four Weddings and a Funeral, whose director Mike Newell and screenwriter
Richard Curtis both won awards, as did the producer, Duncan Kenworthy.
The film's star, Hugh Grant, was given a special award for ''the
outstanding comedy performance of the year, and one of the outstanding
comedy performances of any year.''
The other awards were: Best Foreign Language Film -- Farewell My
Concubine; non-British newcomer -- Jim Carrey; British newcomer -- Iain
Softley, director of Backbeat; British technical achievement -- Roger
Deakins, cinematographer on The Hudsucker Proxy.
The Dilys Powell award for ''outstanding services to cinema as an
actor'' went to Lord Attenborough. A special award for services to film
reviewing went to Film 95's Barry Norman.

TWO companies which claimed they suffered serious damage because of an
article published in Scotland on Sunday newspaper, yesterday settled a
#500,000 defamation action out of court.
Neopost Ltd and Neopost Finance Ltd sued Scotsman Publications after
the article, by business editor Mr Simon Bain, appeared on September 5,
1993.
The article, entitled Frank Outsider, was accompanied by a cartoon and
was highly critical of Neoposts' business practices. Neopost claims that
its reputation was lowered in the eyes of existing and potential
customers.
Neopost Ltd, of Romford, Essex, makes, supplies, and services
postal-franking equipment. It has a number of places of business in the
UK, including one at the Kirkton Business Centre in Livingston, West
Lothian.
Neopost Finance is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Neopost Ltd and
provides leasing finance for Neopost's customers.
In their action at the Court of Session, both companies said that
Scotland on Sunday made no attempt to obtain their views before
publishing the article.
They insisted that they were unequivocally committed to ethical
business practices.
Neopost Ltd claimed that, up to April 1994, it suffered a reduction in
direct sales of #11,703 a month and estimated that, in the 12-month
period from the publication of the article, it would lose about #114,000
profit.
Neopost Finance alleged that it suffered a reduction in leased sales
amounting to about #11,244 a month and estimated that, in the 12-month
period following publication, it lost profit of about #145,727.
The companies alleged that their prospects of securing new business
and maintaining their existing customers and contracts had been
significantly impaired.
They said they had called upon Scotsman Publications to publish a
withdrawal and an apology but the company had refused.
Lord Coulsfield was due to hear legal arguments in the case yesterday
when the settlement was announced. The terms were not disclosed.

A LEADING tennis coach, in charge of a British youth team, went on an
early morning drunken rampage in a Dutch hotel, an industrial tribunal
was told yesterday.
Fraser Auld, 31, from Troon, Ayrshire, allegedly drank up to seven
beers and several glasses of liqueur before setting off a fire
extinguisher and repeatedly banging on the hotel door of the female US
team coach.
A Russian coach staying in a nearby room raised the alarm, thinking
there was a fire.
Up to 30 firefighters and seven police officers arrived at the
upmarket hotel in Leuwarden.
The door of the US coach, Beverley Bowse, was broken down by the fire
brigade. She was said to have been inside, awake and frightened. One
witness said Mr Auld had spent the previous day talking frequently to
her, which had caused comments among fellow coaches.
The tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, heard that Mr Auld lost his job
with the Lawn Tennis Association after the alleged events on the night
of July 4 last year. He has brought a case against the London-based
association for unfair dismissal.
The tribunal heard that Mr Auld was in charge of two young women
players, who were due to meet up with a party of boys and compete in an
international tournament whose sponsors included the owners of the hotel
where the coaches were staying.
Mr Adrian Lynch, representing the LTA, said Mr Auld had spent the
evening downing beers in the hotel bar. He then joined an Australian
coach, David Drysdale, and a Swedish coach, Helena Norrby, for drinks in
a hotel room.
''They retired to Mr Drysdale's room, where he and Mr Auld drank a
number of glasses of 40-proof liqueur.
''It is claimed Mr Auld let off a fire extinguisher. Mr Drysdale's
reaction was one of condemnation and he said: 'You idiot, go to bed'.''
The tribunal heard that youngsters in the party were extremely upset
after the incident, which Mr Lynch described as ''hooligan-like
behaviour''.
Mr Richard Lewis, director of national training for the LTA, said Mr
Drysdale thought Mr Auld had lost his head when he deliberately set off
the fire extinguisher, spraying the corridor and the door of the US
women's coach.
Mr Drysdale had claimed that Mr Auld's room was left looking like a
''pigsty'' after he had been sick on the pillow and left black stains on
the bed from the fire extingusher.
The Royal Netherlands Lawn Tennis Association, organisers of the
Windmill Competition, threatened to abandon the whole tournament after
the incident.
Mr Lewis, who played Davis Cup tennis for Britain, explained under
cross-examination how he reached his decision to sack Mr Auld.
''In my view, even the amount of alcohol he admitted to drinking was
excessive.
''He did not deny setting off the fire extinguisher and admitted
making noises at 3am in the corridor.
''He also admitted that the fire brigade and the police were called.''
Mr Lewis said Mr Auld had offered to pay for the repairs at the hotel
but stressed that this made no difference to the dismissal.
He said: ''He left his credit card at the hotel and was willing to pay
for any costs incurred -- he really felt that was the core issue.
''He never actually said: 'I am very sorry for what has happened'.''
He added: ''If I had allowed somebody to continue as an employee
having done such a thing under the influence of alcohol and it had
happened again, I would be utterly defenceless in court.''
Mr Lewis expressed his shock on hearing news of the events. ''I could
not believe it at first. I remember the look on my secretary's face when
she gave me the fax. She was shocked as well.''
Mr Auld was employed as an administrator and house tutor for more than
four years by the LTA at its training school at Bisham Abbey,
Buckinghamshire.
He had been in charge of the squad because the regular coach, Simon
Jones, was late in arriving in Holland from a competition in Spain.
Mr Auld's barrister, Miss Jo Heal, told the tribunal that her client
did not believe he was representing Britain at the time of the incident
but was there as an escort for the children.
The tribunal heard that Mr Auld had told the LTA he had been suffering
from sickness but he admitted the symptoms had not been checked out by a
doctor.
The hearing was adjourned until today, and is expected to last more
than two days.

HIGHLAND Regional Council yesterday agreed to stay within capping
limits set by the Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, and increase its council
tax by 5%, but it postponed a decision on a further #2.4m of cuts until
after April's elections.
It had to find #12.9m worth of savings to meet Mr Lang's guidelines
but managed to identify only #10.5m of short-term cuts, holding off the
decision on the remainder until a special meeting on April 6.
Councillors argued that education would bear the brunt, with 150
non-teaching staff threatened, unless the economies were achieved by
withdrawing funding to the region's Jobs, Enterprise, and Training
Scheme (Jet). This employs 110 people, providing support for more than
1000 young, unemployed people each year. More than 100 protesters from
the Jet scheme lobbied yesterday's meeting.
A former council convener, Mr Sandy Russell, who is the current
education vice-chairman, urged that a decision on the remaining cuts
should be postponed: ''I am quite certain that out of a budget of #232m
we can identify savings in other areas without job losses. We may run a
deficit for a month or two but, at the end of the day, we will be within
our budget.''
Mrs Val MacIver, who chairs the education committee, described the
decision to postpone as ''an absolute disaster''. She said later: ''If
we don't shut down training units today, you get rid of people from
schools tomorrow. The choice was there to be made today and it was
fudged.''
In the debate, Mrs MacIver suggested that others could help with
training: ''We have a legal amd moral duty to provide education. We do
not have a legal duty to provide training. Highlands and Islands
Enterprise gets #80m a year, which includes #5m for training for work.''
As a result of the postponement, the future of both those employed on
Jet and the non-teaching staff in the region's schools is stll in doubt.
Although the council agreed to operate within the capping limits, it
is to seek counsel's opinion on whether Mr Lang acted reasonably in
setting these and whether there were grounds for a legal challenge.
Following yesterday's meeting, the new regional council tax across
Highland will range from #282.75 for Band A properties (market value of
up to #27,000) to #848.24 for Band H (more than #212,000).
The charges will yield around #30,892,000 from an estimated 72,839
tax-payers. The council's total budget was set at #232,440,476, the
maximum it can spend under Mr Lang's capping guidelines.
Added to the council tax is the regional water tax which will range
from #60.73 in Band A to #182.20 in Band H. This will mean that the
total regional charge for a Band D tax-payer will rise from #492.23 to
#515.22. The relevant district council tax must also be added.
The new unified business rate will be 43.2p in the pound; the
non-domestic water rate 9.93p in the pound, an increase of 18.2%, and
the non-domestic sewerage rate 6.67p in the pound, an increase of 17%.
* WEST Lothian District Council has frozen its existing council tax
levels for next year.
The freeze means that residents in Band D properties will continue to
pay #91 for the district council element of their council tax. The
council also announced an extra #675,000 of spending on leisure and
community projects.

THE Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, Mr George Galloway, yesterday
claimed that a corporal had killed a 16-year-old girl and that Army
bungling had allowed him to remain at large.
Mr Galloway, speaking in the House of Commons, was calling for a
debate on justice in the military as part of his campaign on behalf of
his constituents, John and Christine Menzies, whose 16-year-old daughter
Christina was murdered two years ago in Germany where her father was
stationed with the British Army.
Lance Corporal Darren Fisher, 23, of Reading, Berkshire, was acquitted
last year in a court martial of the murder.
Staff Sergeant and Mrs Menzies, who have returned to Glasgow where
Sergeant Menzies is serving at the Territorial Army's barracks in
Maryhill, are campaigning for Corporal Fisher to be taken to court
again, or for him to be charged with perjury. They also hope to sue him
for damages.
''We really want a whole change in the military system because it does
not have a jury. Instead there is a panel of five high-ranking officers
and we are trying to get that changed,'' Mrs Menzies said.
The body of Christina was found in undergrowth next to a German
motorway. She was believed to have been strangled or suffocated after
going to a disco at the British military base at Gutersloh. The court
martial of Corporal Fisher heard forensic evidence linking him to the
crime. He was acquitted.
Mr Galloway criticised what he called ''the bungling of the military
police and the incompetence of the military prosecuting authorities in
the case of the murder of . . . constituent Christina Menzies''.
He added: ''As a result of that bungling and that incompetence,
Corporal Darren Fisher -- who killed my constituent -- has literally
gotten away with murder and is currently at large in a military
establishment in Telford in Shropshire.
''Military justice and military law is seen increasingly in this
country as an ass. All sorts of cases and issues are now backing up and
urgently needing a debate in this House so that the whole system of
courts martial and the way in which justice is dispensed in the armed
forces, especially when crimes are committed against civilians as in my
constituent's case, can be properly brought under democratic control and
can be modernised so that police work and prosecuting work is up to
standard as it should be.''
Commons Leader Tony Newton said he would bring Mr Galloway's remarks
to the attention of Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.
Mr Newton said: ''I do understand that the prosecuting officer in the
case was a qualified lawyer who had experience of prosecuting charges of
unlawful killing.''
Mr Galloway has tabled a Commons motion highlighting the case.
It says he is ''gravely concerned at the unsolved murder, in a British
military barracks in Germany, of Christina Menzies, the 16-year-old
daughter of Staff Sergeant John Menzies and his wife Christine''.
Mr Galloway's motion also expresses concern at reports of poor police
work by the Military Police and ''poor legal work by the Military Police
prosecutor''.
The motion ''asks the obvious question whether the murderer of
Christina Menzies is still at large within the British armed forces''.
It does so ''in the light of the acquittal of the accused, Corporal
Fisher, and the statement by the Military Police that they were no
longer looking for any other suspect''.
Mrs Menzies said last night: ''Corporal Fisher had a top QC who just
ran rings round the prosecutor. The prosecutor was a lawyer, but he was
just not very experienced and this case relied very heavily on
forensics.''
She said she was ''very bitter'' about the case, but she and her
husband were committed to their campaign if they could afford it.
Mr Galloway said his Commons motion had already been signed by 28 MPs.
He had already brought the case to the attention of Lord Henley, the
Defence Minister in the House of Lords, but had received no
satisfaction, he said.
He added that he wanted justice for his constituents and the reform of
the courts martial system.

THE Government has decided to renew for another 12 months its special
anti-terrorism powers on mainland Britain, Home Secretary Michael Howard
announced last night.
He disclosed in a Commons written reply that he was accepting the
recommendation by Mr John Rowe QC, an independent inspector appointed to
look at anti-terrorism legislation, that the Prevention of Terrorism
(Temporary Provisions) Act should remain in place for a further year.
Mr Howard's decision comes in the face of calls for the Act,
introduced in 1989 to combat increased activity by Northern Ireland
paramilitary groups, to be scrapped under the Ulster peace process.
Labour, which opposes the legislation over controversial provisions
such as exclusion orders, immediately declared that it again would vote
against the renewal of the Act when it comes up for debate in the
Commons next Wednesday.
Since 1989, hundreds of men and women -- mostly republican, but some
loyalist -- have been barred under exclusion orders from travelling to
mainland Britain because of suspected links with paramilitary
organisations.
A Labour spokesman said of Mr Howard's move: ''We think it is a great
shame that he has not taken the opportunity to review it in the light of
the new circumstances.''
Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Marjorie Mowlam explaining Labour's
concerns, said at Westminster: ''We have long-standing objections to the
use of exclusion orders, which are an unacceptable form of internal
exile.''
She called for a thorough and independent review into all the powers
within the Act.
''Such a review would be particularly timely, given the widely shared
view of the need for there to be some anti-terrorist provision,
alongside what Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew has described
as ''the Government's working assumption that the ceasefires are
intended to be permanent''.

A FURTHER addition to Glasgow's growing hotel sector was announced
yesterday. The 22-bedroom Brunswick City Hotel will open in the Merchant
City in September.
The hotel is currently being built at a cost of around #2m on a site
near the former Sheriff Court (which is being converted into a five star
hotel). The Brunswick City will be aimed at the three-star sector of the
market.
The man behind the venture, Mr Joe Duffy, said the hotel will have a
cosmopolitan feel. ''It is designed so that no two bedrooms look or feel
alike -- from the design to the architecture and interior decor.''
Mr Duffy, who worked on Operation Raleigh as a regional co-ordinator
for four years, said his experiences in hotels abroad had prompted his
new venture.
''It was during this time that I realised how monotonous it was to
wake up in a hotel bedroom that could be anywhere from Falkirk to
Frankfurt.
''Although in a different city with a different culture this was never
reflected in the interior or exterior of the hotel.''
Glasgow's planners and development agency chiefs have been pushing for
the introduction of facilities in the city to fill the gap between bed
and breakfast establishments and the growing number of deluxe hotels.
A spokesman for the Glasgow Development Agency, which is partly
funding the project with the Clydesdale Bank, said: ''If we are going to
make Glasgow a major tourist destination, which everybody is working
towards, then we must provide a range of facilities.
''The key point about this hotel is that it enables us to bring a
derelict site which has lain empty for some time, in one of the most
important areas of the city, back into use.''
The Brunswick City is being built on the site of a demolished
industrial warehouse at 106 Brunswick Street. Spanning eight floors, it
will include a split-level restaurant and a penthouse with a private
lift. Average prices for a double room will start at #40.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson has written to Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang demanding that he clarify his policy on compensation
for redundant local authority employees following a Government defeat in
a Commons committee.
The complex procedures of the Statutory Instruments Committee mean the
Government can ignore the defeat, secured when several Tory MPs were
lulled into absenting themselves temporarily from a debate.
However, Labour claims it highlights an inconsistency in the
Government's pledge to base compensation for council workers made
redundant under local government reorganisation on the recommendation of
an independent body.
Despite a recommendation that compensation be based on up to 82 weeks'
salary, pressure from the Treasury has lowered the maximum to 66 weeks.
Labour claims Mr Lang wanted 82 weeks but was unable to persuade the
Cabinet to back his position.
Mr Robertson said: ''It has drawn attention to the fact that the
Government is short-changing local government employees despite what its
independent commission recommended. And it has drawn attention to Ian
Lang's defeat in Cabinet on what he thought was fair for local council
employees.''
SIR JOHN BANHAM, who was charged with overseeing the reform of local
government in England, resigned last night as the Government announced a
rethink of a raft of his proposals.
The former CBI chief said he recognised the Commission had not done
the Government's or Labour's ''bidding'' -- but insisted his team's
achievements eventually would speak for themselves.
Labour welcomed his resignation, but attacked the Government for not
giving clearer guidelines for the redrawing of the map of England.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson said Sir John's conduct of
affairs had been ''quite deplorable''.
To MPs' laughter, Environment Secretary John Gummer said he was most
grateful to Sir John -- whose contract did not expire until next year --
for having offered his resignation.
Mr Gummer disclosed -- to Labour jeers -- that he was considering
moves which could bring back the ancient county Huntingdonshire, which
includes the Prime Minister's constituency.

SADNESS turned to anger after Brenda McKessock watched her fit, active
mother reduced to a shadow of her old self by mesothelioma.
When Mrs Ellen McKessock, of Erskine, died at the age of 67, her
daughter vowed to find out more about the disease that killed her, and
came up against a fog of ignorance and secrecy.
''She had been exposed to asbestos in a factory in the Glasgow area,
unaware of the risk at the time,'' Miss McKessock said yesterday.
''The first indication was when she had a couple of heart attacks, in
1984 and 1986. None of the usual reasons applied: she didn't eat a lot
of fat or sweets, she was really into fruit and vegetables.''
Mrs McKessock was a fitness and dancing enthusiast.
However, in 1992, she started to become tired and breathless. She was
taking swimming lessons but it became more and more difficult.
''It rang alarm bells for my dad and two sisters when she started to
complain about her illness. At first, the doctor thought it was a
muscular complaint, then she was given other tests, including a barium
meal,'' her daughter recalls.
The diagnosis was made at Christmas in 1992. She had mesothelioma,
with pleural thickening in both lungs. Asbestos had taken away about a
third of Mrs McKessock's lung capacity.
She was taken into a hospice in Paisley for a time. The only medical
help was pain control and she wanted to go home to die.
Miss McKessock said: ''It is a very difficult illness to cope with. It
got a stranglehold on her and she would take panic attacks because she
was fighting for breath. I could see the terror in her eyes but there
was nothing I could do for her.''
Her agony ended early one morning in November, 1993, and Brenda's
quest for knowledge about mesothelioma took on a fresh impetus.
It was a disease that had been swept under the carpet. ''My mum wanted
to know everything that was going on but the doctors told her little or
nothing. Yet there was information about the risks as far back as the
Thirties and beyond, yet they went on using it.''
Miss McKessock, a computer programmer and analyst, has written a book*
about the experience, based on a diary she kept during her mother's
illness and her research. She said: ''I have only scratched the surface
but if it can help anyone else it will be wonderful.''
In spite of the restrictions placed on asbestos use in the UK, the
legacy remains in the buildings, including schools, in which it has been
used.
Internationally, it is an even bigger problem: in 1990, nearly four
million metric tonnes were used by the 24 biggest consuming countries
(Britain is not among them).
*Mesothelioma, the story of an illness, is published later this
month by Argyll Publishing, at #7.99.

SCOTTISH Gas last night admitted it is still encountering teething
problems with a new system brought in 10 months ago to speed up its
repair and maintenance service.
Gas workers have told The Herald of the frustration of having wrong
parts for radiators and gas cookers delivered to them before they go out
on jobs.
In some cases, no parts at all are put aside for the employees.
They have had to use a special voucher system to buy the missing parts
from local shops in the area to which they are sent.
The new system was brought in as part of the gas company's
cost-cutting plans.
Under the new repair scheme, gas depots were closed and employees told
to start their working day from home rather than report to a depot.
At the end of the working day, a worker with a pass key to gas
engineers' vans leaves the next day's work schedule and parts for the
work.
However, in many cases the parts left do not correspond with the work
the service engineer is being asked to carry out.
One worker in Edinburgh said: ''It's difficult to explain why we don't
have the correct parts with us when we turn up on the doorstep.
''A man with keys to the van comes round in the evening and is
supposed to leave the work schedule and the parts in the van.
Unfortunately, that doesn't always happen correctly.
''The men are trying their best with the system but being left the
wrong parts is quite frustrating.
''It's also embarrassing when people know the chief executive is
earning over #450,000.''
A Scottish Gas spokesman said there were still problems with the
system and all contracts for deliveries were under constant review.
He added: ''There are a number of outside companies we use all over
Scotland to deliver the parts to the vans overnight.
''We admit there have been teething problems with the system since it
started.''
Meanwhile, millions of consumers could face higher bills under
Government plans to allow private firms to compete for the UK's 18
million domestic gas users, Labour warned last night.
How much people paid was likely to depend on where they lived -- and
the elderly and poor could find themselves in the cold, said Shadow
Trade Secretary Jack Cunningham.
However, Trade and Energy Minister Tim Eggar hailed the launch of the
Gas Bill -- which would end British Gas's monopoly of domestic supply --
as the dawn of a bright new age of lower prices and greater customer
control.

MORE than 95% of recent retirees were below 65 and two-thirds were
younger than 60, according to a survey which appears to make a mockery
of Government moves to equalise state pensions at 65.
The difference between Government policy and actual practice is
demonstrated by Incomes Data Services, which studied 26 large
occupational pension schemes covering around 40,000 recent retirements.
Only about 5000 to 6000 took place at the ''normal'' pension age set by
the relevant pension scheme.
Virtually all the other retirements took place early, with more than
95% of recent retirements happening below 65. Two out of three retirees
began to draw their company pension before 60 and in eight schemes more
than one third of retirements took place before the age of 55.
In the Royal Bank of Scotland, BAT, Du Pont, and Imperial Tobacco,
more than half of all retirements were before 55. At the other end of
the scale, retirements after the age of 65 made up a tiny proportion of
the total.
The report also showed that, in many schemes, different categories of
worker tended to have a different ''normal pension age''. In the Tesco
scheme, for example, senior managers enjoyed an NPA of 60 while all
other workers had an NPA of 65. Only 14 schemes had a common NPA for all
grades, while in six schemes the NPA was 60, in seven it was 65, and in
one case it was 63.
The term ''normal'' is misleading since members tend to retire
earlier. Some retirees take advantage of provisions allowing early
retirement from a specified age -- 60 at Sainsburys -- without any
actuarial reduction to the pension entitlement.

SCOTTISH Homes yesterday made it clear that it would not change its
policy of refusing to allow district councils to try to take over its
houses.
This was despite a surprising call for a U-turn by Mr David Orr,
director of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, and a
Scottish Office announcement yesterday confirming that tenants of East
Kilbride Development Corporation would have the opportunity to vote for
the district council when the corporation was wound up.
A Scottish Homes spokesman said last night that the decision on East
Kilbride was ''an entirely separate'' matter and added: ''Our position
remains exactly as it was. We believe that it is better to seek to
diversify housing stock ownership.''
None the less, Mr Orr's remarks, effectively supporting demands by
opposition politicians and tenants, are likely to anger the leaders of
Scottish Homes. They have been heavily criticised recently for refusing
to allow district councils to be put on ballot papers for stock
transfers, except in very special circumstances.
The bulk of housing association funding is channelled through Scottish
Homes and individual associations have taken over thousands of the
agency's homes through tenants' ballots.
Mr Orr told the annual conference of the Chartered Institute of
Housing in Aviemore that the absence of district councils as a choice
for tenants meant the whole issue had become ''a political football''.
He said that while the federation believed that housing associations
and co-operatives offered the best options for Scottish Homes's tenants,
it also believed that where councils wanted to bid and tenants wanted
them to, they should be allowed to do so.
Scottish Homes's transfer programme was not, as Shadow Chancellor
Gordon Brown was reported to believe, a scheme to allow millionaires to
get richer through tax breaks.
Nor would it be the end of the civilised world, as some believed, if a
local authority won a tenants' ballot.
East Kilbride District Council's leader, Councillor Colin Robb, last
night welcomed Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's announcement that
corporation tenants would be given the chance to vote for the council in
all 10 areas affected.
''We are extremely confident that tenants will choose the council --
the landlord with the proven track record, the local presence, and the
local accountability -- rather than an unknown absentee private
landlord,'' Councillor Robb said.
''All our independent market research findings have shown that an
overwhelming number of tenants want us as their landlord, and I'm sure
the vast majority of them will demonstrate their strength of feeling
over this issue when it comes to returning their ballot slip in the
spring.''
Mr Lang urged tenants to consider factors including standards of
service, management, and rental policies before voting in a secret
ballot to decide their future landlord when the corporation is wound up.
East Kilbride District Council will be a choice for tenants on the
ballot in all 10 areas. The Munro Trust will also be on the ballot along
with the council in five areas (East Mains, Greenhills, Newlandsmuir,
West Mains, and Whitehills). If a majority of tenants in the other four
areas or in sheltered housing vote against the council, the housing will
pass to Scottish Homes, the residuary landlord.
Mr Lang said the ballot would afford many tenants the opportunity to
break the public sector domination of rented housing in their area
should they choose to do so.
On a wider front, he said Scottish Homes would continue as a single
national housing agency for advancing the Government's housing policies
in Scotland.
The agency said yesterday that it planned to invest #367m in housing
in 1995-96. A further #175m was expected to be generated from the
private sector.
Housing associations protested that this was a 4.3% cut in spending on
affordable rented housing.
Mr Peter McKinlay, chief executive of Scottish Homes, said the
investment programme would contribute to the development of 8500 new and
improved homes for sale or rent.

THERE are more naked women shown on British television than naked men,
according to a report on sex, violence, and bad language on television,
which was published yesterday. It seems that women, under-represented on
all television programmes, from current affairs to films, feature in
two-thirds of all nude scenes.
This bias greatly upset the women reporters covering the launch in
London of the report by the Broadcasting Standards Council, which is
chaired by Lady Howe. It was not, however, clear whether they wanted
more jobs for the girls or more naked men on television.
The report, the third compiled by the BSC, revealed that only
children's programmes had a representative gender mix of performers.
On news programmes, there was a four-to-one bias in favour of men when
it came to reporting but a 50-50 balance between presenters. On sports
programmes, there was an 11-to-one bias in favour of men, and all the
major presenters were male.
Lady Howe said there was a long way to go before women achieved the
right representative balance. It would not happen until they had better
representation at decision-making levels, she added.
The greatest concern expressed by viewers was about violence, although
there had been no significant increase in the amount shown. Bad
language, however, was on the increase, particularly in comedy
programmes.
The report does not indict specific programmes, and the strength of
concern is low, which would suggest that the material does not go very
far beyond the bounds of justifiability. After the 9pm watershed, such
language is used mostly on alternative comedy programmes.
Viewers most likely to express concern tend to be over 55, to watch
more television than the rest of viewers, and watch more of the sort of
programme they are likely to complain about. Women and parents are also
groups who express anxiety about programme content in relation to their
children's viewing.
Incidents of violence are more likely to be reported from programmes
shown before the 9pm watershed than those involving explicit sex or bad
language. This indicates that broadcasters have been more rigorous in
observing the voluntary watershed in the case of language and sex than
violence.
The concern expressed about violence in programmes starts to rise
substantially after 8pm, which could suggest the need for the watershed
to be brought forward.
Lady Howe said they would be watching the situation but it was a
watershed, not a waterfall, and the changeover to adult programmes was
intended to be gradual.
* BBC Scotland's cult/camp sitcom, The High Life, yesterday emerged as
one of the most popular programmes in the corporation's annual
international sales promotion conference at Brighton.
A total of 390 overseas programme buyers, representing 190
international broadcasting organisations, were offered 600 hours' worth
of new BBC product. The most requested programmes included The
Buccaneers, The Private Life of Plants, Ghosts, The Glam Metal
Detectives, and The High Life.
A spokesperson for BBC Worldwide Television said that, though actual
sales arrangements had still to be confirmed, the BBC Scotland comedy
looked like being bought by Australia and several European and
Scandinavian broadcasters.

<HEADLINE>Driver who dealt in drugs wins unfair sacking claim</HEADLINE>

A CONVICTED drug dealer who was sacked after being questioned by
police about his alleged possession of large quantities of cannabis and
money has won his unfair dismissal claim.
Lorry driver David Hay's sacking came a short time after two break-ins
at H Young Transport Ltd's Ayrshire depot. The company's contracts
included the distribution of controlled drugs.
An industrial tribunal in Glasgow heard that there was no suggestion
that Hay was involved in the break-ins, or any reason to suspect drugs
in his possession at the time of his arrest had come from the company.
He was sacked because of the company's previous problems with the
theft of drugs. Management felt they could not keep on an employee who
had been caught with drugs.
Hay, whose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, won his case but the
tribunal found he was 100% to blame and awarded no compensation.
It heard that, after the first break-in, drug squad officers lay in
wait and arrested the culprits during a second break-in.
Hay was off sick for four months. After his return to work, the
company heard he had been caught with a large amount of what appeared to
be controlled drugs and a large sum of money. He was sacked on the
managing director's instructions.
Last August, almost two years after his sacking, he was convicted of
supplying cannabis, possession with intent to supply, and possessing
amphetamines.
The company had no reason to believe the drugs in his possession had
come from it. However, in the light of the problems with theft it could
not keep on an employee who had been caught with drugs in his
possession.
Hay felt he had been unfairly treated because he had not been charged
by police at the time he was dismissed, and was not given the chance to
deny his guilt.
He told the tribunal the drugs had not come from his employers and he
felt they were not entitled to dismiss him.
The tribunal found his sacking was unfair for procedural reasons but
said it was clear the firm could not have been expected to show trust.

A FAMILY planned to murder their father, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Robert Greig's wife and future son-in-law considered poisoning him,
it was alleged at Glasgow High Court.
Mr Greig was found strangled with massive injuries to his head.
Mr Thomas Whiteside allegedly had offered to kill him. He and two of
Mr Greig's daughters later allegedly discussed the murder plan further.
Mr Greig's wife, Frances, 43, told police during a tape-recorded
interview played to the court that she spent the evening with her lover
in her daughter Laura's flat.
Miss Laura Greig arrived at the flat in Sutherland Street, Paisley,
and allegedly said: ''If you want Tam (Whiteside) to do it, give him the
keys of the house.'' She handed over the keys to her house at Shortroods
Road, Paisley.
Later, Mr Whiteside, who is charged, along with Mrs Greig and Miss
Greig, with murdering Mr Greig, arrived and allegedly told her: ''It's
done.'' She said: ''I went home later and discovered Robert with his
head smashed in.'' She called police and at first denied knowledge of
the killing, the court heard.
She also denies paying a man #200 to murder her husband. Mr Stuart
Mack, 24, told how he allegedly took the money but failed to carry out
the killing.
The trial continues.

TWO workmen told of their anger yesterday when confronted by
demonstrators at the M77 motorway site in Glasgow.
Mr William Stewart, 24, and Mr Andrew Donaghue, 49, said protesters
ripped out fence poles, scattered concrete mix on to grass, and
obstructed them from wheeling barrows.
Mr Stewart told Glasgow Sheriff Court that they were paid by result
and protesters were costing them money.
He was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Paul Murphy, 28, of Millbrae
Crescent, Langside; Mr Jake Hunter, 22, of Pollok Free State; and
Frances Claxton, 20, of Maryhill Road, Maryhill, all Glasgow.
They deny obstructing workmen and breach of the peace at the M77
motorway site near Cowglen, Glasgow, on February 9.
Mr Stewart told Miss Gillian Hodsley, prosecuting, that, at about
11.30am, he was concreting metal posts for a security compound at the
site.
He claimed Mr Murphy blocked his way as he pushed a barrow of cement
mix and some of it spilled on to the grass.
Mr Hunter, he alleged, was pulling the posts from the ground and then
started to scatter concrete with a shovel.
Mr Stewart said he had been instructed by his firm not to have any
contact with demonstrators.
The trial continues.

PRESSURE for Rugby Union players openly to become paid professionals
intensified yesterday after a clear indication that the allegedly
amateur status of players may be about to change.
In evidence to the Commons' National Heritage Committee, one of the
most senior figures in the game was in no doubt that change was in the
offing.
Major J W Quin, secretary of Bath Rugby Club, said Rugby Union was
going through a ''complete metamorphosis''. He referred to a forthcoming
meeting of the International Rugby Board and to what might happen after
the World Cup later this year.
He told the committee, which questioned him closely on Rugby Union's
amateur status, that its members might be surprised by developments if
it reconvened in a year's time.
The committee session, which took place against the background of
increasing concern over amateurism versus professionalism in Rugby
Union, took evidence from representatives of both codes -- union and
league.
One of the key witnesses was the former Great Britain Rugby League
international Joe Lydon, who said he knew of one top union player who
was paid ''expenses'' which could only have been run up if he had
travelled to the match venue ''via Bahrain''.
Mr Jack Robinson, chairman of Wigan Rugby League Club, openly admitted
to the committee that they had had approaches from union players wishing
to switch codes, or that clubs approached players. To test them out,
''we always play them away from home under an assumed name to protect
them,'' he said.
The most aggressive questioning, however, was reserved for Major Quin,
who admitted that Bath had so many internationals in its ranks that many
of them were stuck in the 2nd XV.
He was strongly challenged by Labour's John Maxton, MP for Glasgow
Cathcart, who demanded: ''How do you attract these players? What makes
them come to Bath to play?''
Mr Maxton specifically referred to the Irish international Simon
Geoghan, questioning why he travelled to play for Bath when he could be
playing for London Irish, Saracens or Wasps in London.
Major Quin told him: ''In Rugby Union, you want to play for a First
Division club. The success that has happened at Bath has not happened
overnight.''
Mr Maxton: ''You do not offer them any financial package at all?''
Major Quin: ''No. Everything we do falls within the rules laid down by
the international board.''
Players were reimbursed for travel expenses -- to the tune of 20p a
mile -- and while Major Quin admitted some players received help with
getting jobs, he qualified his remarks by stating: ''Rugby Union, being
an amateur game, is why we have no players here today. They have jobs.''
The Bath secretary was pressed on the lucrative contracts players
could now get for advertising clothes and other items. It was pointed
out that after former Scotland captain Ian ''Mighty Mouse'' McLauchlan
wrote a book some years ago about his rugby career, he had been banned
even from coaching schoolboys.
Major Quin simply accepted that times had moved on and were set to
move further. Asked about speculation as to why senior players --
England's Jeremy Guscott was mentioned -- had stayed in Rugby Union when
they could have moved to Rugby League, Major Quin said: ''It is his
choice.''
The spokesmen for both codes made it clear there was mutual respect
but asked why, if Rugby Union was changing ''bit by bit'' towards
professionalism, it did not take the full jump. Major Quin replied:
''Because we are still an amateur sport. We operate under IB rules.''
Asked about the annual income of the Bath club, he said he did not
know but would be happy to give the committee details in writing at a
later date. As a rough estimate, however, he said it was close to #2m.

THERE was a furious reaction yesterday to a plan by Labour's hierarchy
to force a modern version of Clause 4 on to the agenda for the party's
Scottish conference next week.
As revealed in The Herald yesterday, the suggested re-write of the
statement of principles, penned by Scottish MP Brian Wilson, was to
feature as an amendment to a motion before conference in Inverness by
the Co-operative Party defending the original version.
The withdrawal of the motion meant that the amendment fell, and with
it an opportunity to put across a key component of the leadership's
case.
However, the general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, Mr Jack
McConnell, said yesterday there was a way around the problem.
Although it had not been done before at Scottish conference, it was
the practice at national conference in England that, once submitted and
accepted in good faith, motions and amendments become the ''property of
the conference'' and could be used for the purpose of creating composite
motions.
He said the Scottish conference's standing orders committee would
probably accept this interpretation on Monday night, clearing the way
for a composite motion. which included Mr Wilson's alternative wording.
to come before the conference in Inverness next week.
The Campaign for Socialism, the group which wants the retention of the
original wording, written more than 90 years ago, attacked the plan.
''This is the last act of a desperate man,'' said co-convener, Mrs
Mary Picken.
''I am astonished that Jack McConnell can prejudge what an independent
standing orders committee will think.
''I have never in my life come across any rationale which suggests
that an amendment can stand alone without a resolution to amend.
''My understanding is that neither a resolution nor an amendment
become the property of conference until they stand moved.
''We will be challenging this. It is a desperate attempt by the party
establishment to force through an amendment by devious means.
''At a time when it is the party's constitution that is under debate,
attempts to subvert that constitution by bending the rules will not be
looked on favourably.
''We are not afraid of the amendment but we will not sit back and see
the rule book abused in this way.''
There will be rival fringe meetings by modernisers and traditionalists
on Thursday night in Inverness.
When the conference proper opens on Friday, there will be debates on a
Scottish parliament and rural affairs before Mr Blair gives his leader's
speech. This will be followed by the Clause 4 debate, which is certain
to be stormy and which Mr McConnell said yesterday would be a close-run
affair.

THE classic building which around 18 months ago was at the centre of
Edinburgh's unsuccessful bid to host the new National Gallery of
Scottish Art is, after all, to get a major cultural role.
Next week, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang will give the go-ahead for the
Dean Centre, a former orphanage across the road from the existing
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, to house a prestigious art
collection.
More than #2m will be allocated for the conversion of the building in
Belford Road into an art gallery, where the works of Leith-born
international sculptor Sir Eduardo Paolozzi, some at present on the
Continent, will be exhibited.
In July 1993, a partnership of local authorities and the local
enterprise company launched an ambitious #21m proposal to establish a
new National Gallery of Scottish Art -- now earmarked for Glasgow -- at
Belford.
Lothian region has now offered the Dean Centre as a gift to the
Trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland.
Yesterday, the trustees' chairman, Mr Angus Grossart, indicated in a
brief statement that the project was going ahead and that further
details would emerge next week. He added: ''Our plans for Glasgow remain
unchanged and the trustees remain resolved to achieve a major presence
there.''
Councillor Eric Milligan, Lothian region's convener, said the project
would complement the Gallery of Modern Art.
''The indications are that the Secretary of State has looked at this
favourably and it has to be seen as a great coup for Edinburgh.''
The convener said talk of East-West rivalries should be consigned to
the dustbin, adding: ''This is in no sense trying to pull the rug from
under Glasgow or put a spanner in the works.
''If people think the National Gallery of Scottish Art in Glasgow
ought to go ahead, then that will be justified on its merit and take its
place in the queue. It's a matter for the trustees, for the Secretary of
State, and the people in Glasgow.
''The Dean Centre provides an opportunity to enhance the cultural life
of Edinburgh, and on that basis we are proceeding.''
Meanwhile, the favourite option for the proposed new National Gallery
of Scotland remains the Post Office building in Glasgow's George Square.
Public meetings have been held in Glasgow and Edinburgh as part of the
consultation process, the outcome of which will be reported back to the
Secretary of State.

FORMER world champion racing driver Jackie Stewart does not rule out
the business run by his son, Paul Stewart Racing, breaking into Formula
One -- although it might take as much as #24m.
Although their current sponsorship package for Formula 3000 is just
over #3m, they do not rule it out in the long term: ''Believe me, we're
looking at it all the time but it's obviously an awful lot of money and
we wouldn't want to go in and not be competitive,'' said Stewart.
In the first instance, however, they want to win the European team
championship in Formula 3000 and believe their new signing, 25-year-old
Allan McNish from Dumfries, and his French partner Didier Cottaz, who
has just re-signed, are the men to do it.
''Last year, we were leading going into the last race and lost by five
points,'' said Stewart.
McNish, at 19, was the youngest Formula 3000 winner yet and still
holds the fastest lap time.
''We signed him not because he was a Scot but because of his
experience and seat miles in the highest quality cars,'' explained
Stewart.

THE Prime Minister said yesterday that he would not support a
backbench Bill to outlaw hunting which is to have its second reading
debated in the Commons today.
Such measures traditionally had been a matter for the conscience of
individual MPs, Mr Major insisted at Question Time.
He was responding after Labour MP Bill Etherington (Sunderland North)
challenged him on his stance on the ''admirable'' Wild Mammals
(Protection) Bill, piloted by Mr John McFall (Dumbarton -- Lab.).
Mr McFall's Bill would ban fox-hunting, stag-hunting and hare-coursing
and prevent animals being taken, killed or injured by use of dogs and
snares.
Earlier yesterday, a petition with a million signatures demanding the
abolition of blood sports was delivered to 10 Downing Street by the
National Anti-Hunt Campaign and a cross-party group of MPs.
As the petition was handed in, veteran Labour MP Tony Benn said:
''This is how political change occurs -- people start doing something,
politicians realise they have to do something, and gradually it
penetrates to the top.''
Another supporter of the Bill, Tory MP Sir Teddy Taylor, said: ''I
think we will win (the debate) without a doubt.''
However, opponents of Mr McFall's Bill yesterday delivered a petition
against his proposals to his Dumbarton constituency office. The petition
was , signed by 16,000 country sports supporters from all over Scotland.
The signatures were collected over a two-week period following the
launch of a nationwide campaign under the Countryside United banner, and
include those of anglers, stalkers, shooters and hunters.
The petition condemns what it calls ''the misinformed and
counter-productive Bill, which would damage Scotland, her great sporting
tradition, her economy and her unique countryside''.

A RETIRED consultant plastic surgeon, who was appalled to discover on
a visit to Ghana that there were no facilities for plastic surgery, has
masterminded a project to remedy the situation, writes David Steele.
Mr Jack Mustarde, of Alloway, visited Ghana as part of a Rotary
International scheme in 1991. He found that patients were suffering
terribly because problems requiring reconstructive surgery could not be
treated properly.
He said: ''I was determined from that moment to establish a specialist
unit in Accra. With the help of President Rawlings and his government,
as well as countless others in Ghana and Scotland, the dream has become
a reality.''
So far, donations for the unit total #100,000. The same again is
required before the facility can be fully equipped.
Yesterday, Mr Mustarde met Ghanaian nurse Susana Banin at Ayr Hospital
to discuss her progress in specialist training for her role at the unit.
Mrs Banin will move next to Canniesburn for theatre training.
She said: ''I have been very fortunate to train with such wonderful
people.''

<HEADLINE>Inquiry hits at policing of football casuals</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHANGING police tactics in Scotland to deal with football casuals may
be worsening public order, not improving the situation, according to an
academic investigation into soccer fan behaviour.
A Scottish ''firm'' -- an alliance of normally opposing casuals for
international matches -- is now a reality and Hibs, Aberdeen, and Dundee
casuals recently formed an unprecedented alliance for a recent
international in Holland.
The research by Aberdeen University's sociology department suggests it
is now routine for Scottish police to ''arrest'' groups of fans on
suspicion of conspiracy to commit a breach of the peace although, in
reality, the police know that even if the fans are charged, which they
say is rare, the cases never reach the courts.
''There are two dangers to this,'' Mr Richard Giulianotti, one of the
research team, said. ''Firstly, the civil liberties implications are
obvious -- all football fans are affected by this and innocent parties
have been already.
''Secondly, there is no long-term guarantee that this will improve
public order involving the targeted fans -- indeed the reverse may be
the case.''
The researchers say soccer hooligans are increasing their efforts to
avoid being monitored by police and one outcome is fights with known
opponents being pre-arranged well away from police and public scrutiny.
''At least three such fights have taken place in the past six months
and the irony here is that prior policing successes appear to have
induced this sudden intensification of Scottish hooliganism with
increasing unpredictable consequences,'' Mr Giulianotti said.
''The violence lasts far longer than in the past due to its social
isolation and, in part consequence, weaponry tends to be more
prevalent.''
He said the initial consensus between Aberdeen and Hibs casuals that
weapons were inappropriate was now very fragile and in recent years
baseball bats and tools had been used. The use of ''blades'' or knives
was generally regarded as indefensible although some groups were known
for carrying weapons and casuals from Glasgow generally were expected to
carry knives.
The researchers say that, to counteract football hooliganism, Scottish
police have recently begun to detain large numbers of young fans under
their ''liberal'' interpretation of ''conspiracies to cause a breach of
the peace''.
''The vast majority of people detained are not formally charged after
detention and no convictions have resulted from these detentions in the
past year.''
To ensure the most accurate possible information for their research,
one of the team socialised with casuals in ''all possible situations''
except in arranging or engaging in violence. He had provided a clear
picture not only of casual groups but of individual casuals and their
motivation.
The club-level research was carried out in Aberdeen, Dundee, and
Edinburgh and they learned that although the style of casuals may now be
very similar to other fans, they remain behaviourally and culturally
distinct from mainstream supporters.
''Each casual formation's declared raison d'etre relates to the
attempted pursuit, confrontation, and engagement of opponents in
competitive violence, with the intention of establishing claim to
'number one' status in Scotland within the national hooligan network,''
said Mr Giulianotti.
''Each formation has a particular name and acronym and there are
generally shared understandings of who are 'legitimate' targets --
typically opposing casuals only.''

Meanwhile, the Government faced other, economic problems yesterday. Mr
Clarke warned that inflation was likely to rise in the next few months
as higher excise duties and rising world commodity prices fed their way
through the price chain.
But beyond that, the underlying annual rate of price increases,
currently 2.8%, was likely to fall back within the lower half of the
Government's 1-4% target range, Mr Clarke said in a speech in Newcastle
upon Tyne.

THE full political impact of Mr Norman Lamont voting with Labour
against the Government emerged last night at Westminster. The return of
the Tory rebels from exile from their party could now be delayed a
month.
They are outraged by the former Chancellor's theatrical voting
decision on Wednesday night. The rebels were outflanked by him, when, on
an impulse, he decided that he would support Labour leader Tony Blair's
condemnation of the Prime Minister's European policy, the only Tory to
do so.
The nine rebels, who have attracted calumny for their opposition to
the Prime Minister, either abstained or supported the Government in a
majority for Mr Major that was reduced to five by Mr Lamont's action.
His bizarre voting decision has irritated No 10 and the Cabinet as a
whole, because they were hoping to get the Tory rebels back on the
Government whip. Now they are faced with the situation of being unable
to withdraw the whip from Mr Lamont and unable, for the time being, to
return it to the nine rebels who did their best to accommodate the
Government on that key vote.
At Westminster last night Mr Lamont's personal conduct was coming
under severe question.
It emerged that before he voted with the Labour Party on a motion that
claimed the Prime Minister's European policy was against the national
interest, Mr Lamont had attended a party given by Ian Greer Associates.
This may have been an unwise move: this famous lobbyist firm is
embroiled in current sleaze accusations. Fellow Tory members report that
the ex-Chancellor was fully in control of his faculties when he decided
to vote with Labour, reducing the Government's victory from seven to
five.
At the same time, the Ulster Unionists are looking at Mr Lamont with
wary eyes. One of them said last night: ''We think he is a chancer and
may be just using us to promote his own position on Northern Ireland --
which is a very recent one.''
The Ulster Unionists do not see Mr Lamont in the same light as Mr
Enoch Powell who consistently argued their cause for decades before
abandoning his parliamentary seat in Wolverhampton to take one up in
Northern Ireland.
Even Mr Lamont's friends believe that he has now killed off any
political future. Former Foreign Office Minister Tristan Garel-Jones,
who negotiated the Maastricht Treaty with Mr Major, Mr Lamont, and
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, put the ex-Chancellor well out of bounds
yesterday.
''I don't really want to speculate and to spend much time dancing on
his grave. I just feel very sad for him personally.'' Mr Garel-Jones
stated on BBC Radio. ''He has committed a rather inelegant political
suicide.''
In the Commons Mr Lamont was mocked by Labour left winger Dennis
Skinner who placed a notice on the Opposition bench next to him stating,
''Lamont''. This was for Treasury questions in the Commons conducted by
Mr Lamont's successor as Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke.
Mr Lamont laughed when he saw the notice on the notorious Tribune
bench on the Labour side but he did not seek to intervene during
Treasury questions to try to embarrass further the Chancellor who
succeeded him when he was sacked by Mr Major a year after the Exchange
Rate Mechanism debacle.
Mr Lamont, in that key 20-minute division in the Commons on Wednesday
night, broke all the rules and he will not be forgiven by the Tory
Party. The Prime Minister will not recommend Mr Lamont for the peerage
that he might have normally expected as a former Cabinet Minister.
Mr Lamont's seat in Kingston-Upon-Thames vanishes with boundary
changes before the next General Election. What has outraged not only the
Government but the Tory rebels, is that Mr Lamont gave no warning to the
Government whips on Wednesday night about the voting course he was going
to take.
Tory Party chairman Jeremy Hanley said last night that it was a
strange vote for Mr Lamont. ''After all, the Prime Minister was setting
out the policies which Norman until apparently a very short time ago
thoroughly agreed with,'' he told BBC1's Question Time programme.
On whether the whip should be restored to those who supported the
Government, Mr Hanley said those who voted with the Government were
''obviously in a different position to those who did not. They certainly
made a step in the right direction.''
He said it was in the hands of the Chief Whip to decide ''whether a
clear and consistent support has been shown by them''.
Leading Euro enthusiast, Mr Hugh Dykes, a senior Tory back bencher,
described Mr Lamont's move as ''bizarre in the extreme'' causing great
consternation in the Tory Party. ''I cannot recall a previous example of
someone, having held such high office, behaving in that way.''
Mr Lamont's political future, either in England or in Northern
Ireland, appeared to be dead last night.

WIDE-ranging changes are needed in all sectors of the offshore oil and
gas industry to secure the future of North Sea developments, according
to a working party report on the competitiveness of the UK Continental
Shelf.
The essence of the conclusions of the report, published yesterday by
the Department of Trade and Industry, is that a profound change of
culture is necessary for all parties involved in the offshore industry
if costs are to be controlled.
The report says this will call for a change of approach from oil
companies, contractors, suppliers, and the Government.
The working group was set up after a conference in Aberdeen in October
to consider the implications for the offshore industry if costs were not
reduced.
Since then representatives from the oil industry, the offshore
supplies industry, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, and the DTI have
been meeting under the chairmanship of Mr John d'Ancona, director
general of the Offshore Supplies Office.
The group, which invited evidence from 33 companies and organisations
related to the offshore industry, says the practices of the past evolved
in times of large projects and generally rising oil prices and at a time
when much had to be learned about the complexities of managing major
projects in a harsh offshore environment.
''The challenge for both the Government and the industry now is to
adapt the available skills and expertise to suit changed market
conditions,'' says the report. ''Change on the scale that is needed will
require the development of a high degree of trust and confidence between
all parties and their perceptions of each other's roles must also
change.

HEALTH service employees at Crosshouse and Ayrshire Central hospitals
yesterday told Ayrshire and Arran Health Board that any transfer of
their jobs to North Ayrshire and Arran Trust had to be on their existing
terms and conditions.
The workers' resolution follows claims, outlined in The Herald this
week, that the Scottish Health Service central legal office was advising
the North Ayrshire and Arran Trust, a new hospital trust, on how to
circumvent EC rules designed to protect the pay and conditions of people
in public-sector services that are privatised or contracted out.
Yesterday, 700 health service staff decided unanimously that the
transfer of their jobs to the new hospital trust on April 1 should be
carried out in accordance with the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection
of Employment) Regulations 1981, which translates into British law a
1977 EC directive aimed at protecting workers' rights when undertakings
change hands.
The meetings were told that Ayrshire and Arran Health Board's
personnel manager, Mr Mervin Gunn, had asked the advice of the Scottish
Health Service central legal department on how the health board could
''circumvent'' the regulations and whether he could advise the
contractor not to hire any NHS staff.
Mr Allan Wilson, local area officer of the health service workers'
union Nupe, said: ''Only the lowest paid of the health board staff are
not being transferred to the trust on their pre-existing terms and
conditions of employment and only the North Ayrshire and Arran Trust, of
all the other potential trusts in Scotland, is seeking to single out
their support services staff for this shabby and discriminatory
treatment.''
Mr Wilson has written to Mr Bill Ritchie, chairman-designate of the
North Ayrshire and Arran Trust, seeking the trust board's assurance that
it does not condone Mr Gunn's actions nor share his desire to circumvent
EC law.
He has also called upon local communities in North Ayrshire and Arran
to show their disgust at ''this attempt to evade the law on protection
of employment rights'' by writing to Mr Ritchie.
Last night, Mr Ritchie said: ''Negotiations on this matter are
continuing between management and unions and we are hopeful of a
mutually satisfactory resolution.''

A GIRL, aged nine, accused of trying to smother a baby in her pram,
appeared in Paisley Sheriff Court a day early, it was revealed
yesterday. She is now believed to be back home with her parents after
being granted bail.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was expected to make
a second appearance at the court yesterday, charged with attempted
murder.
But when the court started it was revealed that she had been
''hurried'' through on Monday after a request by social workers to the
procurator-fiscal's department.
The girl was remanded into the care of social workers for eight days
by Sheriff George Crozier when she made her first appearance last week.
But social workers asked for the case to be heard early to protect the
girl's appearance from the glare of further publicity.
A court official said: ''It's rare for a child to appear in the
Sheriff Court and it's also rare for a petition remand to be taken a day
early.''
Court staff were taken by surprise when the child suddenly appeared in
the afternoon with social workers and her mother.
Even the police in charge of prisoners were not informed of the
petition and had no note of it.
Paisley's assistant procurator-fiscal, Mr Ian MacDonald, confirmed
through his office yesterday that the girl had appeared and had been
granted bail.
Corridors leading to the courtroom were blocked off to protect the
girl from the public gaze and after her two-minute appearance before the
sheriff she was hurried out the back door and into a social worker's
car.
The girl was charged with allegedly attacking the nine-week-old baby
from Renfrew, in Well Street, Paisley, last month.
The girl, from one of Paisley's housing estates, was accused of
placing her hand over the baby's mouth, compressing her nose to the
danger of her life, and attempting to murder her.

TWO masked men, one armed with a sawn-off shotgun, yesterday stole an
estimated six-figure sum from a bank in Uddingston. The robbery at the
branch of the TSB at 125 Main Street took place at around 1.30pm. The
men threatened the staff and demanded that they hand over the money. The
shotgun was not fired and no-one was hurt.
The men ran out of the bank and escaped in a blue Ford Sierra, later
abandoned outside Lyle's Bar, Main Street, Uddingston. The raiders are
then believed to have switched to a red Ford Sierra which was reported
stolen in Glasgow on Thursday, February 18. It was later recovered in
the Birkenshaw Industrial Estate, Viewpark.

DETECTIVES were last night hunting a gang of thieves who stole #50,000
worth of watches from an Edinburgh shop and then fought off its staff
and members of the public who tackled them as they fled along a busy
street.
The raiders who struck at one of Scotland's oldest jewellery firms are
believed to have been operating recently in Scottish cities.
In yesterday's incident at Laing the Jeweller in Frederick Street two
men, one dressed in a suit and the other in a multi-coloured ski jacket,
burst into the premises at about 10am and grabbed a handful of designer
watches.
They were chased by three members of staff and, as they made for a red
Vauxhall Calibra car parked across the road with another man at the
wheel, pedestrians in the busy street joined in the chase.
One of the gang managed to get into the car which was later found
abandoned in nearby Young Street. The other fled into George Street and
disappeared.
No weapons were used and no-one was badly hurt.
Lothian and Borders police described one of the raiders as aged
between 20 and 30, 6ft 2in, with a slim build and tanned complexion.
He had shoulder-length brown hair swept back and spikey on top and
wore a light grey suit.
The second man who entered the jewellers was aged between 30 and 35,
5ft 8in, and had short dark hair, also spikey on top.
A police spokesman appealed for anyone who saw the vehicle being
abandoned, or who was near the jewellers at the time, to contact them
immediately.

THE Strathclyde public was yesterday reassured by Chief Constable
Leslie Sharp over fears of harassment, particularly of young people, by
his officers during the stop and search phase of Operation Blade which
started on Monday.
By Monday night 110 people had been stopped and searched for knives
and two were found in possession. Another two men arrested for other
crimes were also found to be carrying knives.
After helping consign three quarters of a ton of knives, axes,
bayonets, swords, and a dozen other types of weapons to a foundry
furnace, Mr Sharp said senior officers were standing by to investigate
any allegations made by the public and they would do so quickly.
Every officer on the street had been briefed in the law applying to
stop and search in Scotland.
''The first and essential point is that if you have nothing to hide
then you have nothing to fear from this part of the campaign. No-one
will be stopped at random. People will be stopped on a reasonable
suspicion. This is a difficult area for the police but reasonable
suspicion arises from the hour, the behaviour, and the place -- the
crime pattern analysis of the area.
''Every officer has had a briefing on the need for courtesy, patience,
and tolerance,'' he said.
In certain areas, he added, officers will have available to them
knife-resistant vests on a trial basis.
The procurators-fiscal of the region had indicated they were prepared
to hold special courts should the need arise.
Mr Sharp said his officers had carried out more than 4000 stops and
searches last year, 800 more than the previous year, but never before in
such an intensive way.
Fending off the criticism that the real villains had not binned their
knives during the surrender period, he said they had never really
expected the very hard end of the criminal fraternity to hand in the
weapons they used for robbery.
But there were different categories of knife carriers, including
otherwise respectable young people who might carry a knife in the city
or town centre for protection.
There were also youngsters in housing schemes who carried knives for
territorial or gang purposes and to those two groups he said: ''Don't do
it -- all knife carriers are not dyed in the wool villains.''
It was too early, Mr Sharp said, to discuss success, as many aspects
of the campaign had yet to be tackled.
''What has happened is that because of the publicity we have gained
the public confidence to speak out against the problem, the confidence
that perhaps something can be done about it. From that has stemmed a
current of public condemnation which has brought pressure on the
retailers and the knife dealers, on the young thugs themselves.
''They are beginning to feel just that wee bit isolated. It has put
pressure on the respectable young people who carry knives for protection
on a Friday or Saturday night.'' In a symbolic gesture, the 4569 weapons
surrendered were yesterday melted down in a furnace at the foundry of
George Taylor and Company of Hamilton. The molten metal was cast into a
mould of a fifteenth century classical relief, Allegory of Agriculture
by Agostino de Duccio, borrowed from Glasgow School of Art.
The swords into ploughshares idea came from Superintendent Angus
Kennedy, the force information officer, who has masterminded the
publicity barrage.

MR Gavin Boyd, who died on Sunday night at the age of 64, leaves a
lasting memorial in the shape of the Theatre Royal, the home of Scottish
Opera. It was his fund-raising effort which culminated in the gala
opening of the company's home in Glasgow with Die Fledermaus on October
14, 1975.
As chairman of the fund-raising effort he secured #1m from industry,
commerce, and private subscription, which was matched pound for pound by
the Government to enable Scottish Opera to buy the theatre from Scottish
Television and renovate it.
He subsequently became chairman of the opera company itself and
continued to serve on the board of the Theatre Royal. His efforts were
recognised with a CBE in 1977.
Scottish Opera managing director Mr Richard Jarman said yesterday:
''Scottish Opera owes him a huge debt for his part in establishing the
company and particularly in getting the Theatre Royal up and running.''
Gavin Boyd was educated at Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University,
graduating in law before joining the practice of Boyd &amp; Co., founded by
his father. His reputation as a corporate lawyer led to an invitation
from Mr Hugh Stenhouse to join the board of Stenhouse Holdings and he
succeeded him as chairman after Mr Stenhouse's death in a car accident.
Mr Boyd is survived by his wife Kathleen and son Campbell.

A CENTRE designed to ease the worries of thousands of cancer victims
in Strathclyde is to be built soon in Glasgow.
The development, the brainchild of the Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund,
will be sited next to the Beatson Oncology Unit at the Western Infirmary
which handles more than 6000 new patients a year.
News of the project, which will focus on the support services
available to patients and their families, was given during a visit to
Glasgow yesterday by the president of the CRMF, the Marchioness of
Zetland.
Fund organisers in Strathclyde have been conscious for some time of
the need to provide surroundings where patients can receive information
and expert advice on specific cancer issues, such as diet and mobility,
as well as skilled nursing and medical attention.
The new unit will also give cancer victims access to a clinical
psychologist, occupational therapist, and social worker.
Project co-ordinator Sara Trickett explained that the cost of the
cancer help centre would be met from the #1m appeal now being made by
the CRMF in Strathclyde. She said fund-raisers were confident of
reaching the target, having achieved nearly half the figure within the
first 12 months of the two-year appeal.
The funds will also be used to establish further key Macmillan nursing
posts in the region, including the first clinical-based Macmillan
physiotherapist in Scotland, based at the Beatson.
Speaking to the CRMF's Glasgow 84 Committee, one of the top
fund-raising groups in Britain, Lady Zetland praised the enormous
contribution being made to enhance cancer care in Strathclyde.

LEYLAND-DAF's UK plants and showrooms are offering customers
''business as usual'' less than four weeks after they and their
Dutch-Belgian parent company DAF were placed in administrative
receiverships.
Yesterday, the receivers announced that production at its three UK
manufacturing sites -- the Leyland truck assembly plant in Lancashire,
van manufacturing in Birmingham, and the axle works at Albion, Scotstoun
-- was now close to planned levels.
Mr David Gill, joint managing director of Leyland-DAF, said: ''We are
now able to offer our customers a virtually normal service.''
Against this much improved background, the receivers Arthur Andersen
are continuing to seek buyers for the UK operations.
Both the Birmingham van plant and the truck operation at Leyland,
Lancashire, are the subject of management buy out proposals. Financial
arrangements and management plans are now being drawn up.
Plans for the future of the Albion axles plant are not as far
advanced. Although not part of these management buy out (MBO) proposals,
or the ''New DAF'' rescue package in Holland and Belgium, Albion's
future is linked to all three.
The Scotstoun plant supplies axles to the Birmingham van plant and
components to Leyland. Successful management buy outs of these
operations would require continued supplies from Albion which should
then become attractive to prospective buyers. Agreement has already been
concluded for Albion to continue supplying components to New DAF.
The van plant MBO is the more advanced, mainly because it is less
reliant on reaching a marketing deal with New DAF.

LABOUR'S deputy leader, Mrs Margaret Beckett, yesterday called for a
spiritual renewal in Britain.
She told a housing conference in Aviemore that just as we needed a
fresh approach to the economy, we needed to find a fresh partnership
between the individual and the community.
One of the most unfortunate characteristics of political debate in
recent years had been the tendency of some people to suggest there was a
magic wand which could be waved -- that somehow you could put in less
and get out more, she said.
It had been dangerous to portray the relationship between the
individual and the community as one of conflict instead of one of
balance and mutual interest, Mrs Beckett told the conference.
''What we need is a reassessment of where we ourselves stand, of where
we stand in relation to others in our community in our locality,'' she
said. It was a reassessment which should seek to find a fresh balance,
to see the future of the individual, the rights of the individual and
the ambitions of the individual as being central to each of us.
Addressing the annual conference of the Institute of Housing in
Scotland, Labour's deputy leader said ''a climate of fear'' was being
encouraged in Britain today. There was fear of unemployment, fear of
homelessness and of business failure and that fear lay at the heart of
our social and economic problems. Unless it was addressed it would be
impossible for us to tackle our social priorities, she said.
Turning more specifically to housing, Mrs Beckett said bad housing
conditions created bad health and wasted public money. It cost more to
keep a family in bed and breakfast hotels and hostels than it would cost
to provide them with a decent home. That was a lost opportunity for them
and wasted money for the country.
She referred to a discussion paper launched by the institute at the
conference which warned that social trends were marginalising the
tenants of public rented housing. Mrs Beckett said there was now a
divisive concentration of people in the most vulnerable groups in public
sector housing, and within that public sector in particular localities
and estates.
Earlier, the institute's chairman, Mr Mike Stanley, warned that the
effect of the Government's policies had been to increase the
polarisation between the council sector and the owner-occupier sector.
''The extent to which deprivation and council housing have become so
closely linked is both striking and alarming. On our estates a stratum
of society is being created which does not share in the prosperity of
the majority and suffers multiple disadvantages,'' he said.
The benefit of an effective social mix on estates was well appreciated
by those attending the conference, he said.
It was encouraging to note, he added, that some Government spokesmen
had now acknowledged that a housing policy solely based on owner
occupation was not the whole answer to the nation's housing needs.
Much had been said about the effect of right to buy on the number of
homes available to rent. The institute believed, said Mr Stanley, that
the rules governing right to buy should now be reviewed, particularly in
areas of housing stress.

FORMER Liverpool City Council deputy leader Derek Hatton and two other
people were formally acquitted yesterday of one charge of conspiring to
defraud the city council, when they appeared at Mold Crown Court
yesterday.
Mr Hatton, builder Roy Stewart, and former Liverpool city councillor
Hannah Folan were acquitted on the direction of Mr Justice Waterhouse.
Mr Stewart, managing director of Rogerson's Developments, who faced
only one charge, was discharged. Mr Hatton and Ms Folan face other
charges and the trial continued.
All three were acquitted of a conspiracy charge relating to the
Stonedale Crescent multi-retail and cinema complex site in Liverpool's
Croxteth district.
Yesterday's formal verdicts came after days of legal argument at the
North Wales court. Mr Justice Waterhouse told the jury of seven women
and five men: ''I have heard a number of legal submissions.
''It is my duty now to direct you to return a verdict of not guilty in
relation to the three defendents in respect of count three.
''I have ruled that there is insufficient evidence before the court to
justify the jury in finding that there was a common intention on the
part of the three defendents to defraud Liverpool City Council.''
The case was put forward on the basis that there was an intention to
make Liverpool City Council run the risk of financial loss or detriment,
he said, and went on: ''One of the many points influencing my decision
was the fact that the evidence before the court is that Mr Stewart,
before the meeting of the estates committee in December 1987, had agreed
to an option that he would pay the agreed market value of the land or
that it would go to independent arbitration and he would pay the cost of
the arbitration.''
The Judge told the jury that the case would continue on counts one and
two.
The jury had heard 26 days of prosecution evidence in relation to the
Stonedale Crescent site and two other conspiracy charges relating to two
car parks in Liverpool. They were sent away at the close of the
prosecution case last week while the Judge heard several days of legal
submissions.
After making his ruling yesterday afternoon, he sent the jury away
again until this morning while he considered further legal matters.
Mr Stewart learned of the Judge's decision at the end of yesterday
morning's proceedings, before the jury returned, and left the court to
emotional scenes, hugging his wife Vera, daughter Debbie, and son Roy
amid tears of relief.
He remained composed as he was discharged from the dock and walked out
of the court. He left the building with his legal representatives,
declining to comment.
His solicitor Mr David Thomas said: ''At this stage, Mr Stewart has
been advised that it would not be suitable for him to make any
comment.''
Mr Hatton, 44, now a public relations consultant, of Childwall,
Liverpool, still faces two charges of conspiring to defraud the local
authority, in relation to car park sites in Manesty's Lane and Brownlow
Hill.

THE Prime Minister spent 40 minutes last night with Ulster Unionist
and SDLP representatives at a meeting called in the Commons to consider
the closure of a maternity hospital in Northern Ireland.
Although nominally it was about a relatively obscure issue, Mr Major
wants to keep Irish MPs on side for the continuing Maastricht Treaty
Bill debate, and prove a point to US President Bill Clinton.
He wants to show he is taking the trouble to involve himself in Irish
politics while Mr Clinton is deciding on an envoy to be sent to Northern
Ireland.
At the meeting for the Unionists were Mr James Molyneux, Mr Ian
Paisley, and Mr Robert McRea, the MP for Mid Ulster where the hospital
is sited. The SDLP was represented by Mr Dennis Haughey.

THE leader of Scotland's Seventh Day Adventists yesterday revealed
that David Koresh, the self-proclaimed ''anointed one'' who is under
siege with 75 of his followers in the Texas town of Waco, took part in a
recruiting mission to the UK in 1988.
On Sunday Koresh, 33, and his followers, including as many as 14
Britons, who are members of the secretive Branch Davidian, which they
claim is an off-shoot of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, were involved
in a shoot-out with agents from the US Branch of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (ATF).
The gun battle left at least six people, including four federal
agents, dead. Over 400 federal agents have since laid siege to the
Branch Davidian's fortified compound. ATF agents had attempted to gain
access to the compound in an effort to serve a search warrant.
Yesterday Pastor Bob Rodd, who heads the Seventh Day Adventist
congregation in Crieff and who is leader of the church's 300 adherents
in Scotland, said that in 1988 Koresh, using the name Vernon Howell, and
an associate called Schneider, had mounted a recruiting mission in the
UK.
''The pair of them tried to make contact through Newbold College in
Berkshire, which is our theological training college. They were denied
access and a warning went out to all congregations that they were trying
to recruit young people in particular,'' he said.
Yesterday the Foreign Office in London said that around 14 Britons,
including women and children, could be among those under siege in the
Waco compound. A spokesman said anxious relatives had been in touch but
the Foreign Office had no way of confirming whether the Britons were
with Koresh in Waco.
Mr Robert Blake, of Nottingham, said his son, Winston, was one of
those under siege. ''We don't know if he will come out alive and we're
really worried,'' he told ITN.
The British Embassy in Washington and the consulate in Houston, Texas,
were attempting to establish the truth behind rumours that as many as 50
Britons were members of Branch Davidian in the US.
Pastor Rodd said that in 1988 he had been Seventh Day Adventist youth
organiser for Scotland and the North of England. ''I am fairly certain
that no Scots were recruited. So far as I am aware Howell (Koresh) and
Schneider visited congregations only in Manchester and Nottingham.
''I also want to make it clear that the Branch Davidian has absolutely
nothing to do with us. It was set up in 1929 by Victor Honteff who was
dis-fellowshipped from our church for teachings which were not
considered to be orthodox Christian in nature.
''It is not true to say that Branch Davidian is an off-shoot of our
church. It has nothing to do with us,'' he said.
The Seventh Day Adventist Church, which believes that the Second
Coming of Christ is near, has about eight million members worldwide. In
Scotland there are around 300 adherents with congregations in Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Dunfermline, Irvine, and Crieff.
Since Sunday's gun battle 18 children have been released from the
22-acre Waco compound. Koresh was wounded in the initial assault and his
two-year-old daughter was reported to have been killed.
Relatives of Koresh urged him to surrender. His grandmother, Jean
Holub, said: ''I wish he'd give up and I wish he'd get out of that place
and start over and not get killed, take care of his family.''
Koresh's mother, Bonnie Haldeman, said that a chilling message from
her son had been left on her telephone answering machine. He said:
''Hello, mama. It's your boy. They shot me and I'm dying, all right? But
I'll be back real soon, OK? I'll see y'all in the skies. Bye.''
There were signs late last night that Koresh may be preparing to
surrender. A fleet of ambulances and police vehicles approached the
group's compound and the FBI last night arranged for a long statement
from the cult to be broadcast on radio.
Radio stations in Dallas and in Waco said they had agreed to broadcast
the 58-minute taped statement from Koresh.
In the taped statement Koresh said: ''I, David Koresh, agree upon the
broadcasting of this tape to come out peacefully with all the people
immediately.''
The broadcast raised hopes for a quick end to the 51-hour siege.
Koresh had apparently agreed to begin releasing members inside his
heavily-armed camp two at a time, according to local television reports.
The injured would be removed from the scene first and taken to local
hospitals.
Last night the local Waco hospital was told to prepare to receive
injured, said hospital spokeswoman Marsha Jepson. She had no details on
the nature of the injuries.
Police also sealed off the emergency area of the nearby Hillcrest
Baptist Medical Centre.
The ATF assault on the Branch Davidian compound came a day after the
Waco Tribune-Herald newspaper had begun a series of reports on the cult.
It was alleged that Koresh may have abused children of group members and
that he claimed to have at least 15 wives.
Agents said they had been out-gunned by the sect, which held a wide
variety of weapons including a heavy machine-gun.
Federal agents had sent in more firepower overnight. A convoy of 25
trucks, cars and vans carrying agents in riot gear moved in as onlookers
were ordered out, and the FBI sent its elite Hostage Rescue Team to the
scene.
US authorities have refused to say how long the 400 law-enforcement
officers massed outside the fog-shrouded compound were prepared to let
the stand-off drag on.
Last night Pastor Cecil Perry, president of the Seventh Day Adventist
Church in the UK, said that what Koresh represented was totally alien.
''We view with regret the happenings in Waco. Unfortunately there are
individuals from this country who have been mesmerized by the cult of
leadership of Vernon Howell (Koresh) who has no link with our church
other than he has tried, on his visit to this country, to prey on the
unsuspecting.
''Individuals from within our congregations who made any alliance with
this group were adequately warned of the danger of following this
so-called prophet,'' he said.

DELICATE negotiations are under way to secure the future of the second
runway at Prestwick Airport, seen as vital to the future of the growing
Ayrshire facility.
On the day that Federal Express, the world's largest freight airline,
launched a freight service to North America and the Far East from
Prestwick, it emerged that a row was developing between the airport's
owners and the neighbouring Freeport over ownership of runway 03.
For several weeks, workers from PIK, the company which bought the
airport from BAA in April 1992, have been improving the 1000m runway on
the southern tip of the airport.
They had hoped to have it ready for use this weekend but a letter
arrived from solicitors acting for Freeport Scotland warning that it
intended to exercise an option, given to it by BAA, to take over the
runway with a possible view to building factories.
Senior PIK officials insist that the runway is licensed and will
operate as part of the airport's growing role in Scottish freight and
passenger aviation. They see the company as having a strong legal
position.
Independent analysts have made it clear that two runways capable of
taking wide-bodied jets put the airport in a strong position
internationally.
Chairman Lord Younger of Prestwick said: ''I am confident that an
amicable solution will be found to this problem.''
Mr Bill Barr, chairman of Freeport, has said that he hopes that the
two companies can work together for the good of the local economy. He
felt that it was inappropriate to comment further yesterday.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Kyle and Carrick
District Council holds sizeable stakes in both PIK and Freeport Scotland
and has zoned land beside the runway for housing. There is likely to be
political controversy over which should win support should battle be
joined.
Federal Express yesterday began a new export freight service for
Scottish businesses to North America and the Far East with DC10-30
freighters visiting Prestwick six times a week.
The company is offering a fast service, in some cases the following
day, to destinations in North America and the Far East. It is aimed
specifically, though not solely, at Scotland's expanding electronics
industry.
Research has shown that, while 62% of Scottish air freight imports fly
directly into Scotland, 78% of exports are trucked to England before
leaving by air.
Federal Express chairman Fred Smith worked closely with Lord Younger,
chairman of the Scottish Partnership in Electronics for Effective
Distribution (Speed), in setting up the new service.

AN opera singer claimed at an industrial tribunal yesterday that he
was persecuted by a gay clique in the male chorus of Scottish Opera.
Mr Stephen Hill, 28, who is gay, was sacked by Scottish Opera for
verbally and physically abusing company manageress Miss Lesley Boyd in a
row about overtime payments last July.
He was called to a disciplinary hearing and sacked while still wearing
his costume and before the performance of Don Giovanni at His Majesty's
Theatre, Aberdeen, was completed.
Mr Hill, of Armadale Street, Dennistoun, Glasgow, claims that he was
provoked and was unfairly dismissed. He wants his job back.
The Glasgow tribunal heard that the union representative called to
support him at his disciplinary hearing had been accused of sexually
assaulting Mr Hill some weeks earlier.
Managing director Mr Richard Jarman said that Mr Hill told him that he
did not want to say anything in front of ''that bastard'' and as a
result the union representative, Mr Malcolm Aitken, left.
Mr Jarman said that Miss Boyd told him that Mr Hill had torn up the
timesheet and told her what to do with it, grabbed her arm, pushed her
violently to one side, and left the office. He said that Miss Boyd had
marks on her arm and he formed the view that there had been a degree of
force.
He said that Mr Hill was in a highly emotional state and Miss Boyd and
orchestral manager Mr Jay Allan had tried to calm him down before the
performance.
Mr Jarman denied that Mr Hill was persecuted by a clique within the
male chorus and would not agree that male chorus members were more
likely to be homosexual.
After the dismissal, he agreed to pay Mr Hill #1600 and to destroy his
disciplinary record in order not to prejudice his career.
The tribunal continues on May 7.

AS the Government prepared to announce its plans for Scotland's
constitutional future next week, the three opposition parties took a
tentative step towards a united front on the issue when their leaders
agreed to meet next Monday to discuss a way forward.
They will be just ahead of the Government statement, which is expected
to be approved by Cabinet tomorrow after a final scrutiny by a Cabinet
committee yesterday. A large number of Cabinet Ministers attended the
meeting and declared themselves satisfied about points that some had
questioned in the draft the previous week.
The statement, which will expand the responsibilities of the Scottish
Office, call on the opposition parties to co-operate in expanding the
work of Scottish committees, and emphasise Scotland's ability to realise
its national identity as a distinct part of the United Kingdom, could
trigger a more determined bid by the opposition parties to work
together.
Monday's meeting was achieved by Labour and the Liberal-Democrats
agreeing on a twin-track approach which does not dump the Constitutional
Convention but allows for other processes outside it and the SNP
accepting that the convention does not have to be buried before it can
work with the other parties.
Mr Tom Clarke (Labour), Mr Jim Wallace (Liberal-Democrat) and Mr Alex
Salmond (SNP) will meet under the chairmanship of STUC general secretary
Campbell Christie at Westminster, where the MPs have to be because of
possible key votes on the Maastricht Treaty Bill.
At a meeting yesterday, Mr Clarke and Mr Wallace agreed to ask their
Scottish colleagues to attend a joint meeting together with the three
SNP MPs to consider a common approach to Taking Stock.
Yesterday's meeting, attended by Mr Christie, Canon Kenyon Wright, the
convention convener, and other convention members, agreed that the
body's role had to change. Mr Clarke said he saw it as a campaigning
body. Asked later if he accepted that the convention might have had its
day, he replied, ''Never''.
Later, Mr Salmond said the agenda for Monday's talks must clearly be
the democracy declaration agreed at the Edinburgh demonstration by
25,000 on December 12, which all the parties had endorsed, and also Mr
Christie's further proposals. The declaration called for a Scottish
parliament, a referendum on the constitution, and a campaign to carry
the case into Europe.
Mr Wallace said it was necessary to build on the mood of unity at the
December meeting in the Meadows. Mr Clarke was more cautious about
agenda details but welcomed the chance to discuss ways of making
progress on Scotland's future. Mr Salmond promised he would come with
detailed plans for taking the declaration further.
Although it would be easy for the leaders to fall out again, with
Labour unwilling to endorse independence, or the SNP devolution full
stop, the imminence of the Government's proposals is likely to prevent a
quick break.
The probable agreement to hold a gathering of all Scottish opposition
MPs in Scotland goes some way, though only on a one-off basis, to meet
Mr Christie's proposal for a Scottish parliamentary council.
Mr Salmond said it would have been ''foolish and unconstructive to
have introduced the convention into this process and I am pleased this
red herring has now been withdrawn''. The two other leaders insisted
there was still a worthwhile role for that body.
* From the time the convention was set up in 1988, the SNP has refused
to join and it and the convention parties have blamed each other for the

SCOTLAND YARD detectives were last night investigating the deaths of
two brothers -- apparently high-ranking officials in a newly emergent
Russian state.
Both brothers, from the oil-rich Muslim state of Chechnya in the
former Soviet Union, were shot through the head three times with small
calibre bullets. They were in London to make business contacts who could
design passports, money, and stamps, for the new state.
The eldest victim was shot a few days before his brother was similarly
killed.
Two men were being questioned by Scotland Yard detectives last night.
In December, the brothers had paid #1m in cash for a luxury penthouse
apartment in Bickenhall Mansions, west London. However, the brothers
also rented a house in Harrow, north London.
The trussed up body of the elder brother, aged 40, last seen alive on
Thursday morning, was found in a box in a garage at the house in Harrow
on Monday after the police had been alerted by suspicious workmen.
Later the same day, the second body, of a man in his thirties, was
uncovered in the penthouse flat, which had been under police
surveillance.
It appears from post-mortem examinations that the first victim had
been shot at least four days before the body was found.
The second man was killed closer to the time of the discovery of his
remains.
After two men who entered the luxury flat were arrested, the body of
the second murder victim was found.
The younger brother had been away from London last week and is known
to have been alive on Sunday.
Detective Superintendent Ken Woodward, of the Metropolitan Police No 8
major investigation pool, who is heading the inquiries, said that the
younger brother might have been killed while he slept in the flat.
Mr Terry Catlin, whose company manages the mansion block, said
residents had no idea what was going on.
The Edwardian block had gone undergone extensive refurbishment in
recent years and was fitted with security video entry system.
The flat had been sold to a foreign company, registered in either
Paraguay or Uruguay.
Police, he said, had been at the premises since Monday afternoon.
Mr Catlin said he believed that three people had occupied the flat.
Chechnya is a small area in Southern Russia. Its leader General
Djhokar Dudayev claims it is a fully independent country and not an
autonomous region of Russia.
He has often threatened Boris Yeltsin that the local citizens will
take up arms against Russia to ensure its claims to sovereignty.

ARMED police stormed a North London block of flats last night and two
men were arrested in connection with the Harrods bomb hours after police
showed a video of two suspects.
One man was taken to hospital with a head wound.
Two teenage girls living next door to the house where the arrests took
place described how they saw a man being dragged by police from the
building after hearing screams.
Scotland Yard said shots were fired at anti-terrorist squad detectives
and a tactical firearms unit as they moved in on a house in Stoke
Newington, north London.
They were responding to a tip-off after police released a video of two
men filmed just before the IRA blast at the Knightsbridge store which
injured three people on Thursday, January 28.
Scotland Yard later said a ''substantial amount of firearms and
explosives'' had been recovered from the house in Walford Road. Last
night forensic officers were checking the contents of the flat.
Scotland Yard said police did not return fire during the arrests.
It is believed both men were being held at high-security Paddington
Green police station last night.
The police had had the pictures of the bomb suspects for about a
month, but decided only yesterday to release them.
The publicity brought an immediate response.
Dozens of armed police surrounded an area of Stoke Newington as vans
and police cars blocked off Walford Road.
With the road sealed, heavily armed police from Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist squad and from the tactical firearms unit rushed the
building.
Miss Theresa O'Brien, 18, of Walford Road, said she was at home with
her 15-year-old sister Anne Marie at about 4.30pm when they heard the
screaming.
''I realised it was the man next door,'' she said. ''He just kept
screaming without using any words. I went to look out of the window.
There were lots of police surrounding the house and pointing guns at it.
''They were wearing flak jackets and special hats. They shouted to me
to get away from the window and my sister had to pull me away.''
She added: ''We saw a man being dragged along, his whole body on the
ground. He was surrounded by police.
''I saw that his whole face was red. It was all bruised.''
One of the men arrested, who she thought was in his mid-thirties,
moved into the upper two-storey flat in the three-storey terraced house
in Walford Road just before Christmas, she said.
He lived with what she presumed was his wife and two sons in their
mid-teens.
Mechanic Tommy Murray, 24, who works in a garage on the corner of
Walford Road, said: ''There was blood all over the place. They had him
on the floor. He seemed unconscious but there was a gun pointed at him.
There was blood pouring out of his head. There was a lot of shouting.
''The police were using what seemed like heavy-duty rifles but they
were in plain clothes and the cars were unmarked.''
Scotland Yard said in a statement that the two men were being held at
a central London police station.
It said: ''As a result of the televised appeal made today, armed
police went to an address in Walford Road, Stoke Newington, this
afternoon and, after shots had been fired at officers, two men were
arrested.
''Police did not return fire. One man suffered a minor head wound
during the course of his arrest and was taken to a hospital.
''He has now been discharged and both men are at a central London
police station, detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.''
Anti-terrorist squad commander David Tucker told a New Scotland Yard
news conference they had not released the pictures from two clips
lasting 45-seconds from two security cameras before because ''there is a
danger that wider publicity would give the opportunity for these people
to be warned and escape.''
He went on: ''The intensive efforts to identify them have not yet
succeeded and we have reached the point where we need public help in
doing that.''
He said it had to be accepted ''that for some reason which I can't
specify the men are legitimately described as suspects''.
The computer enhanced pictures, released at lunchtime, show two men,
one carrying a briefcase, smiling and talking to each other as they walk
along the street near the store in Knightsbridge at 9.09am on January
28.
About 10 minutes later two coded telephone warnings claimed there were
devices inside and outside the store.
A device exploded at about 9.40am, 20 minutes before the store was due
to open.
Last November, a police constable was shot twice after stopping a
lorry packed with a ton of explosives in Stoke Newington. One man was
arrested later and charged with attempted murder and terrorist charges
but a second man escaped.
The next day, a bomb attack on Canary Wharf in London Docklands was
foiled after security guards spotted a van laden with a ton of
explosive.
