Though divorce will not be an issue for the churches, remarriage certainly
would be, report Ron McKenna and Calum Macdonald
THE Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, was consulted before the letters
from the Queen were sent and agreed with their contents, church sources said.
Earlier, a Church of England spokesman, the Rev Eric Shegog, said that from the
church's point of view, a divorce would be no bar to Charles becoming king.
The Archdeacon of York said a royal divorce would not be an issue for the
church, but a remarriage would.
The Venerable George Austin told BBC2's Newsnight: ``There comes a time, sad
and painful as it is, that a marriage has to be recognised as dead, and after
the shenanigans and tantrums of the past few weeks, it has been very publicly
obvious that it does seem to have died.''
He added: ``Certainly for many people who hold to a traditional view of
marriage and its sanctity, remarriage would cause problems.''
The reaction from politicians and church leaders in Scotland was sympathetic.
The Very Rev Dr James Weatherhead, principal clerk to the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland and former Moderator, said it was ``not surprising''.
``I don't know that there is any strong comment that I can make. I don't think
there are any distinct consequences for the church.''
Dr Weatherhead said that the monarch although a member of the Church of
Scotland was not, unlike the English position, the surpeme ruler.
``The convention is that when the monarch comes to Scotland she is a member of
the Church of Scotland. It is normal for the Queen when she comes to attend the
Church of Scotland that she takes communion there.''
He also said that divorce had long been recognised by the church under certain
circumstances.
``I think the church as a whole will sympathise with all involved. Any divorce
is a breakdown of human relationships. That is something that makes people sad.
It is the kind of a predicament where things have gone wrong. It is not a
judgment thing,'' he added.
Father Tom Connelly, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland,
said: ``Naturally, it is always very sad if a marriage breaks down.
``We do recognise that if the breakdown is irretrievable, then it is very often
better for the children if the parents separate, but of course we don't accept
you can get remarried if you divorce.''
Scotland's political leaders emphasised that there were no constitutional
implications. Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ``On a human
level, it seems sadly inevitable, but I don't think it has any constitutional
ramifications at all.''
Scottish Conservative Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst said: ``It is always
extremely sad when a marriage ends. I think the best thing we could all do is
leave them to sort it out for themselves away from the glare of publicity and
in the interest of themselves and their children.''
Sir Michael was reluctant to comment on the impact of the Panorama interview
but added: ``I think the current situation is clearly unsatisfactory and a
strain on everybody. I am very sad for them.......for them all.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond commented: ``If the marriage is finished, and that is
pretty obvious, then the best thing is divorce. I'm sort of doubtful if you
should divorce by royal consent. The decision is for them and not anyone else.''

THE recent high-level talks about the Princess of Wales's future role are
thought likely to run parallel with negotiations about a divorce settlement.
The Panorama interview is being viewed by many as a deliberate move by the
princess to enable her to demand more favourable terms by indicating her
determination to stand her own ground.
Her first priority will be to be given unlimited access to her sons.
With Prince William in direct line of succession to the throne, that should
ensure her a place never too far from the centre of public attention for the
rest of her life.
But financial security, leaving her free to maintain a lifestyle free from the
demeaning need to beg favours from the rich and famous around the world, is
also very important to the princess.
She is thought likely to insist on a home of her own, although she might prefer
to maintain a base within the recognised royal family environment, such as her
present Kensington Palace home.
Staff, transport, and protection would also be needed to allow her to continue
the public duties she clearly wishes to carry out.
The now infamous TV interview, when the Princess of Wales admitted adultery,
was clearly the deciding factor in influencing the Queen to urge Prince Charles
and his estranged wife to divorce.
After the November 20 Panorama bombshell, in which the princess called royal
officials ``the enemy'' and questioned the prince's suitability to be King,
nothing would again be the same.
This seemed clear when Diana apparently could not face spending Christmas with
the Royal Family at Sandringham and turned down the Queen's invitation.
Charles had already set the pattern by appearing last year on a prime-time TV
documentary when he too confessed to infidelity.
The Jonathan Dimbleby television scoop was followed up with an authoratative
book in which more private thoughts were aired in public.
The couple's unhappy marriage may have been doomed to fail.
The princess told BBC1's Panorama of the strains placed on her marriage by the
prince's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. There were three people in
her marriage, Diana complained.
The royal couple had struggled in vain to keep some sort of unity but, perhaps
inevitably, they decided to separate three years ago.
Since then, there has been been an uneasy truce.
The couple have appeared together in public, albeit rarely, and usually with
Prince William and Prince Harry, at state occasions such as the summer's VE and
VJ-Day commemorations.
But those close to the royals knew that Charles and Diana just did not get on.
At times they managed to disguise their dislike for each other, perhaps for the
sake of the children.
In truth, however, there was never any chance of a reconciliation.
The princess told the nation, and the world, on Panorama that, despite her
affair with ex-cavalry officer James Hewitt, she did not want a divorce.
The prince, since receiving his mother's dramatic letter, has now made it known
to the princess that he shares the Queen's view that an early divorce is
desirable.
Divorce is a matter for the husband and wife. But clearly the Queen could not
stand by and watch the couple's very public marriage break-up inflict damage to
the very institution of monarchy.
Neither Charles nor Diana wanted to be seen to make the first move to divorce.
Now the Queen has done it for them.
And, although no-one was speaking for the princess last night, it seems divorce
proceedings will start early in the new year, if not sooner.

A STRONG sign of major changes within the royal household came on Monday with
the announcement that the Princess of Wales would not be spending Christmas Day
with her sons and the rest of the royal family at Sandringham.
The about-turn, taken as a clear indicator of worsening relations between
estranged Diana and her royal in-laws, was announced as the Prince of Wales and
Camilla Parker Bowles were riding on the same hunt.
As both households were by then aware of the content of the Queen's letter, it
may have been decided to abandon any pretence of a close family gathering in
that the knowledge the divorce stance would become public.
Prince Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles were careful not to be seen together as
they joined around 100 other riders on the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt near
Highgrove House. Mrs Parker Bowles stayed with the hunt for about two hours,
leaving half an hour before the prince's arrival.
Of the princess's decision to have Christmas alone, Buckingham Palace said she
had made ``private, alternative plans.'' Prince William and Prince Harry would
be joining other members of the royal family, the palace added.

<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974782468</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Western Isles Council last night welcomed the news that compensation may
finally be paid to the creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International. It could mean the council receiving almost #5m in the spring.
A Luxembourg Court yesterday accepted the withdrawal of a motion by former BCCI
employees appealing against their settlement. This left the way clear for the
compensation package already agreed by BCCI's biggest shareholder, the Abu
Dhabi Government, being paid.
The move has already been approved by courts in England and the Cayman Islands.
The settlement means, in effect, that between 25,000 and 28,000 verified
claimants will get a first dividend of 20% of their claim. In the case of the
islands council, which lost #24m, this would be #4.8m.
Vice-convener Angus Graham said: ``We have had so many final hurdles, but this
looks more definite and I think we can expect the payment in April or May.
``If we get our 20% it will make quite a difference to the council and would
mean us saving #400,000 a year in loan charges, so we certainly welcome the
news.''

<HEADLINE>Pact on steel clears way for summit in Dublin</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974782469</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MR Major and his Irish counterpart, John Bruton, plan to give the Northern
Ireland peace process a joint boost by staging a summit meeting in Dublin today.
Their talks got an eleventh-hour go-ahead last night after the settlement of an
unrelated London-Dublin row in Brussels.
Britain's determination to veto a European Union plan to back with cash the
#30m takeover of the troubled, state-backed Irish Steel company by an Indian
buyer had threatened to sour inter-government relations to an extent that a
peace summit would not have been worthwhile.
Failure of the takeover would mean the loss of almost 400 jobs at an Irish
Steel plant in Cobh, near Cork.
But British Steel said it was ``very disappointed with the outcome of the
negotiations''.
``British Steel holds to its belief that the use of Article 95 of the Treaty of
Paris to approve individual subsidy cases is illegal,'' it said.
``The company will, therefore, be challenging the decision in the European
Court of Justice and will also request the court to ensure that the purchaser
repays any illegal aid.''
The British Iron and Steel Producers' Association said: ``The British
Government has wasted the opportunity to assert the rule of law and set down an
important precedent for the future.
``The deal reached today fails in any real sense to curtail Irish Steel's
future output and the UK steel producers deplore this compromise. The UK steel
industry will be pursuing this through the European Courts.''
Weeks of negotiations between senior officials from the two governments failed
to break the deadlock in        the peace talks, and yes-       terday
afternoon the two prime ministers were in telephone contact about the affair.
However, soon after the start of a crucial EU ministerial session in Brussels,
sources on both sides confirmed they had settled their differences.
That permitted the activation of plans for Mr Major to head south to meet Mr
Bruton, late this afternoon, after a series of engagements in Northern Ireland.
Mr Major, accompanied by his wife, Norma, will be a dinner guest of Mr Bruton's
tonight before flying home tomorrow morning.
Dublin sources said the aim of the summit would be to maintain the dynamic of
the momentum created by the joint communique on the agreement they struck at
their last meeting in Downing Street.

GORDON Wardell, the ``grieving'' husband who shed tears for his murdered wife
on television as part of an elaborate plot to hoodwink police, began a life
sentence for her murder yesterday.
Wardell was described by Mr Justice Cresswell as an ``extremely dangerous,
evil, and devious man'' after a jury at Oxford Crown Court unanimously
convicted him of murdering his wife Carol, 39, a Woolwich Building Society
manageress, in September last year.
Wardell, 42, of Meriden, Warwickshire, had tried to outsmart detectives by
claiming that he and his wife were the victims of a ``terrible robbery that
went wrong''.
Shortly after the killing he faced the TV cameras at a police news conference
appealing for help in tracing the murderer. He kept up the charade of
distraught widower at Mrs Wardell's funeral.
After the jury delivered its verdict, the court heard that Wardell had already
spent time behind bars for an attack on a woman.
As a 17-year-old schoolboy he was jailed for four years after luring a
teacher's wife into woods, indecently assaulting her and stabbing her in the
neck.
Passing sentence, Mr Cresswell said: ``You killed your wife in a brutal manner
and then cynically attempted to escape detection by going to elaborate lengths
to make it appear that your crime was the work of a gang of robbers.
``This was an outrage to your wife, her family, and to everybody who knew her.''
As the verdict was announced there were gasps of ``yes!'' from the public
gallery and Mrs Wardell's 67-year-old mother, Joan Heslop, broke down in tears
of relief.
Wardell showed little emotion, shaking his head slowly as the foreman read the
verdict.
Wardell, an executive for a car parts company, earning #27,000 a year, told
police an elaborate story of how the supposed killers of his wife knocked him
out with drugs when he arrived home from a quiet Sunday evening pint on
September 11 last year.
After beating himself to make the raid look believable, Wardell gagged himself
with a ripped sheet from his garage and tied his hands and legs to a rubbish
bin stand before telling how the raiders took his wife.
After leaving hospital in a wheelchair and wearing tinted glasses, a frail
Wardell, who lost two-stone in weight in the weeks after his wife's death,
faced the media to broadcast his tale of the scene of terror which greeted him
upon his return home.
After the sentence, Mrs Heslop said she would like to see Wardell hanged for
what he did to her daughter. ``He should be dead,'' she said.
Mrs Heslop said that Wardell had stayed with her for three weeks after the
killing and it was not until the day after the funeral that she first suspected
her son-in-law.
``It was just a mother's feeling, I suppose,'' she said.
Wardell's painstaking efforts to cover his tracks after suffocating his wife
began when he drove to the building society branch she managed in Nuneaton,
tapped into her security codes and looted the safe of #14,000.
He planted one of Mrs Wardell's sandals in the office then dumped her body in a
lay-by.
Wardell returned home and bound and gagged himself in the living room as if
trussed up by the fictitious gang.
After he was found by police he claimed that the last time he saw his wife was
the previous evening as she was being held at knifepoint on their sofa by a man
in a clown's mask.
In his subsequent television appearance Wardell choked back tears as he told
how he had ``lost everything'' and appealed for help in the hunt for his wife's
``totally evil'' killer.
Describing the conviction as ``wonderful, absolutely wonderful'' Mrs Heslop
added: ``A light has gone out of our lives never to return. But justice has
been done. Carol will be able to rest in peace now.
``She loved life and was full of life. To have it taken away tragically in such
a way was terrible.''
Mrs Heslop said that she knew nothing of Wardell's previous conviction until
his arrest, but could not say if Mrs Wardell knew about her husband's criminal
history.
She added that she was ``absolutely disgusted'' by Wardell's phoney display of
grief as he carried out his plot to deceive detectives.
Mrs Wardell's brother, Tony Heslop, 46, described the verdict as ``brilliant,
great, perfect''.
His sister, Susan Field, 42, said: ``Carol kept us together because the family
meant everything to her.''
Detective Superintendent Tony Bayliss, who led the Warwickshire police
investigation described Wardell as ``cool, cold, calculating'' and a
``dangerous, evil man''.
His motive for murder had not been fully established but was believed to be
``domestically orientated''.
Mr Bayliss said that his suspicions were aroused when there was no response
from the public or from ``our sources of help'' to police appeals, despite a
large reward being offered.
Police were also suspicious about aspects the the crime.
If the motive had been cash why had the gang chosen such a rural building
society branch? Why had they only taken about #14,000 from the safe and left
the automated cash machine untouched along with credit cards in the safe?
Why did pathologists find that the five-man gang had not tried to rip off Mrs
Wardell's gold rings and chain or make off with cash and thousands of pounds
worth of cameras, televisions, and spirits from their home?
Closer examination of what had happened at the Woolwich also raised questions.
Mrs Wardell used a personalised security code to gain access to the staff areas
of the branch and she had been trained that in the case of any raid she should
use what was know as the ``duress code''.
By tapping in that number she would have sent a silent alarm to security and
alerted them to the raid without tipping off the gang.
Wardell expected police to believe that his wife, praised by colleagues for her
commitment to her work, would not have tried to get help when the branch was
robbed.
Asked about Wardell's elaborate plot, Mr Bayliss said: ``I don't think he was
an actor. He was a person you could not get beneath the skin. Very cold.''
Asked why his criminal history did not arouse immediate suspicion, the
detective said: ``Just because someone has a previous conviction it does not
automatically make them a suspect in a murder case.''
Mr Bayliss said that Wardell's possible involvement in other outstanding crimes
in the Midlands was ``a matter we will deal with in due course'', adding that
other forces ``may want to speak to us in the light of today's events''.
He believed that the key evidence was from an anaesthetist who rejected
Wardell's claims that he was unconscious for many hours as a result of being
``drugged'' by his invented assailants.
Mr Bill Clegg, QC, defending Wardell, said afterwards that the possibility of
an appeal would be ``under consideration''.

GORDON Wardell was not a newcomer to apparently motiveless attacks on innocent
women.
Wardell, 42, a 6ft 3ins keep-fit fanatic, had almost killed before, but
neighbours and friends in the Warwickshire village of Meriden where he and his
wife Carol lived a seemingly idyllic life, were unaware of his violent past.
The young Wardell, a bespectacled promising A-level student at the Woodlands
comprehensive school in Coventry, lured his science master's wife to a wood
before launching a terrifying attack on the woman in front of her two young
sons in 1970.
The 17-year-old youth, who had never had a girlfriend, told 32-year-old science
master's wife Brenda Hayes that he had found a rare plant her absent husband
had been looking for.
He then rode his bike to the spot and waited for the woman to arrive before
ambushing her at knifepoint, tying her hands behind her back and sticking
plaster over her mouth.
The teenager, who, a court heard, had a fantasy that he was Hollywood film star
Paul Newman, then squirted de-icer in her face and indecently assaulted her
before stabbing her in the neck twice.
Mrs Hayes needed nine pints of blood to recover from the attack and Wardell was
jailed for four years after being found guilty of grievous bodily harm when the
prosecution dropped a charge of attempted murder.
Wardell told police at the time: ``I was fed up and it was just a reaction - I
don't know what to or what for.''

<TEXT>
THE funeral of murdered schoolgirl Heather West marked the end of a ``terrible
nightmare'', her brother said yesterday.
Mr Stephen West, 22, led a small group of mourners at a brief country
churchyard service on Tuesday when the remains of his sister were finally laid
to rest. He said yesterday: ``After laying her to rest we can now resume our
lives.''
But the funeral is said to have caused a major rift in the family.
Ms Anne Marie Davis, daughter of Frederick West and stepsister of Heather, felt
angry and snubbed because she was not invited, said her confidante Virginia
Hill, co-author of Ms Davis's book Out Of The Shadows, which told of life at 25
Cromwell Street.
However a spokesman for the family said Ms Davis had agreed not to attend the
funeral.
Heather West was the last of 10 victims of her serial killer mother, Rosemary,
42. The Gloucester housewife and mother of eight is now serving life for the
murder of Heather, who disappeared in 1987, and nine other young women and
girls, including her stepdaughter, Charmaine, eight.
Heather West's remains were the first of nine to be unearthed in a police dig
early last year at Cromwell Street. She had been decapitated and her body
dismembered.
All the victims, except for Heather, were reburied earlier at private family
services. Her funeral was postponed until the end of her mother's trial.
Rosemary West apparently wished to attend the service but was not granted
permission to leave Durham Prison.
The funeral took place at St Michael's parish church at Tintern, on the Gwent
border with Gloucestershire in the Forest of Dean, an area Heather West loved
as a child. The service was conducted by the Rev Julian White.
Stephen West led the mourners, including his sisters Mae, 23, and Tara, 18, and
Mr Peter Grose and his daughter, Tamara. Mr Grose is the publisher of Stephen
and Mae West's just-published life story, Inside 25 Cromwell Street.
Also present were Rosemary West's solicitor, Mr Leo Goatley, and his wife.

SCOTLAND shivered yesterday as weathermen predicted that temperatures are set
to drop even further before Christmas.
Shetland had a foretaste of what might be in store for the rest of the country
when blizzards blocked almost 600 miles of roads and closed airports after the
islands' worst snow in 11 years.
At the Rothiemurchus Estate, near Aviemore, Scott Hosie, 25, went fishing
Eskimo-style through a hole in the ice.
The coldest night of the winter so far sent the mercury down to -8 degrees and
brought snowploughs and gritters out across the North of Scotland. The A96
Lecht road from Tomintoul to Cockbridge was closed overnight.
Mr Ian Symon, of Castle Douglas-based Weather Watchers, yesterday predicted
heavy snow falls before Christmas over most of the country.

THE allegations that led to the ruling Labour group being described as the
Monklands Mafia have been around so long that they seem buried in the mists of
time.
In fact it was in August, 1992, that The Herald revealed deep divisions within
the Lanarkshire towns of Airdrie and Coatbridge over the way the Monklands
council was being run by its Labour leaders.
Conservative politicians began to take an interest, and ever since the stream
of allegations has been endless.
The concerted campaign led by an English MP can be put down partly to attempts
to embarrass the late Labour Party leader John Smith and then Shadow Scottish
Secretary Tom Clarke in their very own heartland.
In addition, Monklands offered a golden opportunity to transfer the Tory sleaze
label to Labour.
But what helped the allegations linger so long were protests by Labour
councillors. Four resigned as vice-conveners for numerous reasons - including
that nearly all convenerships went to Coatbridge councillors.
They also believed that for many years Catholic councillors from Coatbridge had
been biased against the mainly Protestant town of Airdrie.
The quartet were suspended at various times for breaches of local party
discipline.
An internal inquiry by the Scottish Labour Party executive in October, 1992,
issued six months later, said all claims regarding irregularities should be
passed to the Government, the Accounts Commission, and the police.
Overall, the complaints of religious bigotry and a spending bias in favour of
Coatbridge were ``dynamite'' which exploded when combined with allegations of
``jobs for the boys''.
These included the seemingly bizarre claim of personal patronage in hiring
staff. A two-tier application system was confirmed in which people applying
from the local Jobcentre were given pink forms and people who knew councillors
were given ``higher priority'' green forms.
However, an inquiry ordered by the Scottish Office into Monklands District
Council's employment practices yesterday concluded that the local authority did
not fail to comply with requirements.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said later of the conclusions by Mr William
Nimmo Smith, QC: ``No further action is therefore required by me.''
The inquiry came after the allegations of nepotism among senior councillors
refused to go away even after the council had commissioned its own inquiry,
chaired by Professor Robert Black.
Arguably, Professor Black's report, published in June, merely muddied the
waters by doing little more than record on paper all the allegations.
The report indirectly led to then Scottish Secretary Ian Lang ordering a public
inquiry into staff appointments, something he had long resisted because most of
the allegations were unsubstantiated.
Despite Dover MP David Shaw's repeated baiting in the House of Commons, Labour
MPs John Smith and Tom Clarke refused to become embroiled in the controversy.
However, Mr Clarke issued a statement yesterday welcoming the findings, while
Mr Shaw pledged to fight on despite being castigated by the Government inquiry
for an ``irresponsible'' attitude in evidence.
Mr Smith's successor, Mrs Helen Liddell, confronted the allegations head-on
during last year's Monklands East by-election. She faced an SNP candidate, Kay
Ullrich, who had claimed only a Nationalist victory would make Labour clean up
its act and ``restore and revitalise the reputation of Monklands''.
Only time will tell if Mr Nimmo Smith's findings will do just that. Ironically,
the Monklands name will be wiped off the political map with local government
reorganisation in April.

A SECOND director of an Edinburgh-based company at the centre of claims over
alleged violations of the US embargo against Libya may face extradition
proceedings.
The US customs service was last night reported to be considering seeking the
extradition of a director at McNeil International.
No-one was available for comment at the firm's West End offices.
Company director David McKeeve, 36, from Glasgow, appeared in court in Boston
on Tuesday charged with breaching the US embargo by attempting to export more
than #250,000 of computing equipment.
He and McNeil International are accused of submitting false information to
shipping agents and the US customs.

the same morning sessions at the nursery, and four members of staff, were
yesterday given courses of antibiotics.
The parents of 30 other children who take part in afternoon sessions at the
nursery have been advised of the situation. They have been told to seek
immediate medical help if their children show symptoms of the disease or become
ill in any way.
The boy was taken to Yorkhill Hospital for Sick Children on Monday with
suspected meningococcal meningitis, a bacterial form of the brain infection.
The disease causes inflammation of the brain and can be life-threatening.
A hospital spokesman said the child had initially been taken to intensive care,
but was now being cared for in a general ward. ``His condition is more settled
and he seems brighter,'' he said.
Dr Rob Brogan, a consultant in public health medicine with Greater Glasgow
Health Board, said: ``There is minimal risk to other children because of the
steps we have taken.
``The boy is doing well, he is responding to treatment. If we get the disease
early with antibiotics, the chances are excellent. We would expect the child to
make a full recovery.''
Dr Brogan said it was thought that the boy had picked up the bug in the past
seven days, by coming into close contact with a carrier, someone among the 10%
of the population who carry the bug naturally in the back of their throats.
The antibiotics were aimed at wiping out the infection in the carrier, and
therefore helping to prevent other people picking up the disease.
Dr Brogan added: ``At this time of year especially, there is quite a number of
people who carry it in the back of their throats and it doesn't do them any
harm, they have a natural immunity to it.
``This is just one isolated case. We get a lot of sporadic cases at this time
of year and we take these steps to stop it developing into an outbreak.''
Symptoms of meningitis include fever, drowsiness, sensitivity to light,
headache, neck stiffness, and a body rash.
q.A twelve-month-old boy is detained in the Borders General Hospital also
suffering from meningococal meningitis. Earlier this month two women were
treated at the same hospital for the virus.

THE report of Mr William Nimmo Smith, QC, appears to be a clear-cut rebuttal of
the key allegations which have been made against the ruling Labour group on
Monklands District Council.
His findings, reached after two weeks of evidence from 77 witnesses, and a
period of private information gathering, are unequivocal:
q There is no evidence to support any allegations of religious bias in the
making of any appointment to employment with the council.
q There is no evidence to support any allegation that membership of or
connection with the Labour Party has had a material effect on any appointment
to employment with the council.
q There is no evidence to support any allegation of nepotism in connection with
any appointment of a relative or a councillor to employment with the council.
The forensic approach of Mr Nimmo Smith is laid out in his introduction to the
report, in which he says he had read a large number of press cuttings about
``Monklandsgate,'' the ``Monklands Mafia,'' and ``Jobs for the Boys''.
He characterises the mood in Monklands by going on to say: ``The tone of the
press coverage of these and other allegations indicated a general assumption
that there was substance to them. I was thus not surprised to hear casual
remarks about the council, such as: `Everyone knows they've been at it for
years.'
``I am familiar with the way in which allegations and rumours can, by
repetition, gain credibility regardless of underlying facts.
``They may be true, but again they may be based on a mis-perception of events
or they may simply have been invented out of malice and passed on through
ignorance and credulity.
``It was therefore obvious to me at the outset that elementary principles of
fairness required me to proceed on the basis that I should only find that the
council had failed to do what was required of it if my inquiry disclosed
evidence which I accepted and which I regarded as sufficient to lead me to that
conclusion.''
Mr Nimmo Smith tackles the various aspects of his inquiry in separate sections:
Appointment procedures
He says the council had decided, in late 1992, to review its procedures for
appointing staff after widespread criticism, and awarded the task to
consultants Ashdown Millan.
Mr Nimmo Smith says he regards the new procedures as being in accordance with
current best practice and as providing the best available safeguards to
minimise the risk of appointments being made by reference to considerations
other than merit.
However, he adds that previous methods of appointment, when councillors were
more heavily involved, invite comment.
``Where the perception that political power was exercised by a small number of
councillors had led to disagreements . . . such ininvolvment was not only
unjustifiable, but readily gave rise to the further perception that its
persistence derived from a desire to make appointments for improper reasons.
``Councillors' involvement in the making of appointments prior to the adoption
of the new procedures was in the circumstances such as to give apparent
substance to allegations (of wrongdoing). For this, the members of the council
must carry the responsibility.''
The Black Report
Mr Nimmo Smith is less than complimentary about the outcome of the inquiry
undertaken by Professor Robert Black, professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh
University, who was appointed by the council to investigate the various
allegations against it.
Professor Black, says Mr Nimmo Smith, was under pressure of time to complete
his work and had limited financial resources. One central passage of the Black
Report is ``no more than a compendium of untested allegations''.
The conclusion reached in yesterday's report is: ``The unfortunate consequence
of the treatment of allegations of nepotism in the Black Report is that they
were given apparent legitimacy by their repetition by a person of independence
and high standing.
``This led to press reports which described the Black Report as a `damning
indictment' and as containing `damning evidence of nepotism'. He himself made
clear in his evidence (to Mr Nimmo Smith) that he had never intended his report
to be read in that way.
``Overall, the outcome of Professor Black's inquiry must be regarded as a
disappointment.''
General allegations
Mr Nimmo Smith says he asked a number of political figures to give evidence to
his inquiry. Many, he concludes, were unable to give any substantiation to the
allegations which were circulating.
However, he singles out English Tory MP David Shaw for particular criticism.
``As his evidence went on, I became increasingly unimpressed by it. I regarded
his attitude as irresponsible.''
``I had a strong impression that there was substance to the perception that
political power was exercised by a small number of Coatbridge councillors.
``Councillor Brooks, in particular, struck me as a strong-willed man who liked
to control the exercise of power. It seemed to me to be more than a coincidence
that the wards of the `rebel' Labour councillors and the SNP councillors are in
and around Airdrie.
``Although these are political considerations, and thus outwith my remit, I do
not feel able to ignore them, because I think that much of the trouble which
has arisen, and in particular the allegations with which I am concerned, stem
from the insensitive exercise of power.
``If power is exercised in such a way as to lead to a sense of exclusion,
suspicions are more readily aroused and rumours and allegations gain currency.
``I think that there was, for far too long, a collective failure on the part of
the council to respond adequately to the allegations, and for this the chief
executive (Mr Maurice Hart) must bear some responsibility. But such allegations
do not form part of the normal experience of a chief executive, and they are
notoriously difficult to counter, so I do not regard this as a criticism of
great substance.''
Coloured employment forms
Much of the original criticism of Monklands centred on the use of pink and
green employment application forms. It was claimed that the ``green''
applicants had the implicit support of councillors.
After examining the evidence, Mr Nimmo Smith says: ``I am . . . persuaded that
the use of a green application form had no material effect on any identifiable
applicant's employment prospects.''
Religious affairs
On the allegation of sectarianism, Mr Nimmo Smith is clear: ``I could find no
evidence whatever to support any allegation of religious bias in the making of
appointments . . . I conclude without hesitation that there has been no
religious bias.''
The Labour Party connection
Mr Nimmo Smith says he fully investigated the claim that party membership was
an advantage in gaining employment or subsequent promotion. He carried out
extensive surveys of the council's building services and housing departments,
and asked numerous witnesses about the allegation.
He says he was given full co-operation by Labour Party officials and concludes
that no-one could justify the claim.
Councillors' relatives
The Black Report had alleged that a total of 68 council employees were
relatives of councillors.
Mr Nimmo Smith says the true total should be 48, of whom 17 had not been
appointed or promoted since 1990, the start date for his inquiry. He
subsequently interviewed 28 workers and was ``favourably impressed by each''.

RAIL privatisation passed another milestone yesterday with the announcement of
two more passenger franchises, for Great Western Trains and LTS, going to
management-employee buy-out teams.
Together with Tuesday's announcement that Perth-based bus operator Stagecoach
is to run South West Trains out of London Waterloo, this completes the first
tranche of franchises. Contracts for the second tranche, which includes Inter
City East Coast, are due to be let in the spring.
GWT, which operates out of London Paddington, and LTS, which serves Tilbury and
Southend in Essex from London Fenchurch Street, have won contracts of 10 and 15
years respectively, subject to investment plans being cleared with the rail
franchising director.
``New services, new rolling stock, less cost,'' was the jubiliant declaration
from Transport Secretary Sir George Young as he welcomed the deals as
``excellent news for passengers''.
Less ecstatic was Labour transport spokesman, Brian Wilson MP, who warned that
all three franchises ``will cost the taxpayer far more than they did before BR
was broken up two years ago.
``In 1993/94 neither South West Trains nor Great Western received any subsidy
at all,'' he said.
Mr Wilson predicted that there would be ``very few more franchises let before a
General Election''.
The Great Western franchise goes to Great Western Holdings, with the line's
management and employees owning 51% of the voting shares. It is backed by West
Country-based bus operator FirstBus, venture capitalists 3i and funding from
Intermediate Capital Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
LTS Rail is a comparatively small commuter line operating out of London's
Fenchurch Street station, taking in such stations as Barking, Upminster,
Tilbury, Basildon, Southend and Shoeburyness. The LTS franchise has been won by
the buy-out team Enterprise Rail, backed by 3i and Gresham Trust, and the new
company is committed to investment in the franchise and intends to completely
re-equip the business with new trains not later than the year 2002.
Meanwhile, the managing director of ScotRail, Mr John Ellis, has reaffirmed his
commitment to leading a management bid for any future private franchise of the
passenger service.
He added that a privatised ScotRail would introduce new rolling stock on the
Glasgow to Edinburgh line, with existing trains on the line being moved into
service on other routes.

<RECORDNO>974782480</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A POLICEMAN who had sex with a 15-year-old solvent abuser on the back seat of
his patrol car after being told to drive her to hospital was sentenced to 12
months yesterday.
The judge told PC Adam Grice-Roberts, 32, he had been guilty of a ``grave
breach of trust'' towards a girl he was supposed to be looking after.
The jury at Preston Crown Court rejected her claims that the officer had raped
her. He pled guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse.
The court had heard the sex took place in his Rover patrol car in the
underground car park of Blackpool Central police station after he had been
called to find the girl collapsed in an alleyway, sniffing butane gas.
The judge told Grice-Roberts: ``You had intercourse with her not only when you
were on duty but when you were supposed to be looking after her.
``It is of the greatest public interest that members of the public should be
able to trust police officers. That trust has been lamentably abused.''
Grice-Roberts claimed the girl had offered him sex and he believed she was 17.
The girl's family criticised the year-long sentence for an offence that carries
a maximum two years.
Her mother said: ``I am totally disgusted. He knew he was going to get the
lightest possible sentence because he is a policeman, a policeman who took
advantage of a girl who should have been in his care.''
The girl was visiting her family from the children's home where she was living
in North Wales when the incident happened.
She gave evidence by a video-link.
The shamed officer resigned from the force during the case, he has lost his
police house and his fiancee, who became engaged to him when his marriage broke
up, has left him.
Grice-Roberts, of Lindle Crescent, Hutton, near Preston, will serve his
sentence segregated from other prisoners, as a convicted police officer and a
sex offender, for his own safety.
His mother said he accepted his actions were very foolish and that he deeply
regretted them.

THE widow and family of a taxi driver have won a crucial legal victory in their
damages action against the man charged with murdering him but acquitted by a
jury's not proven verdict.
A judge ruled yesterday that David Anderson had no relevant defence to a claim
by Mrs Margaret Mullan that he was responsible for her husband's death.
Temporary judge Mr Gordon Coutts, QC, decided that any further hearing in the
case at the Court of Session should be restricted to the amount of damages to
be awarded to Mrs Mullan and her three children. They are claiming a total of
#100,000.
Mr Coutts also ruled that there was no justification for an inquiry into the
family's motive in bringing the action.
Mr Anderson, 24, of Nelson Road, Gourock, who claims that the true purpose of
the case is to have him branded as a killer, is expected to appeal yesterday's
decision to three judges.
Mr Mullan, 38, was working as a taxi driver at the time of his death in
February, 1990.
He took an early morning booking to drive Mr Anderson from Gourock to Greenock.
At some point in the journey Mr Anderson produced a hunting knife which
penetrated Mr Mullan's heart and killed him.
In May, 1990, a jury at the High Court in Paisley returned a not proven verdict
against Mr Anderson and the Mullans raised a civil action against him a week
later.
They claimed that by his actions Mr Anderson was responsible for the death of
Mr Mullan by stabbing him or causing a knife to penetrate his chest to a depth
of five inches.
In a written decision issued yesterday, Mr Coutts said that it had been argued
on Mr Anderson's behalf that it was contrary to public policy to allow the
action to go ahead.
Mr Anderson claimed that he had taken out the knife, which he used at work and
normally carried, to show to the taxi driver. He alleged that Mr Anderson left
his seat and the knife went into his chest as the driver kept moving towards
him.
He maintained that contact was entirely accidental.
Mr Coutts said counsel for Mr Anderson had attacked the motivation of the
Mullan family in bringing the case, claiming that they were using the court for
an improper purpose.
It was alleged that the Mullans' true aim was not to recover damages but
effectively to have Mr Anderson declared to have murdered or otherwise
unlawfully killed Mr Mullan.
Mr Coutts said: ``If there is any justification whatsoever for a preliminary
inquiry into the motivation of a pursuer in a case, which I doubt, this is not
such a case.
``The absence of any precedent is in itself a powerful argument against any
such inquiry being proper, but, further, in the present case, which bears to be
simply an action seeking damages, it would seem wholly inappropriate.
``The only reason why some damages might not be recoverable would be if Mr
Anderson was bankrupt and I do not think that the Mullans should be deprived of
establishing their right to damages even if they have difficulty in recovery.''
Mr Anderson was said to be out of work and to have no assets, but the judge
added: ``I see no reason why he should not be required to pay a sum each week.
A wrong has been done to these pursuers and they are entitled to a remedy.''
On the question of Mr Anderson's defence to the action, counsel for the Mullans
argued that the production of a knife capable of causing death in a taxi in a
deserted location on a dark night amounted to negligence.
This is the first case of its kind to reach this stage in a Scottish court. Joe
and Kate Duffy sued Francis Auld in a civil action after the charge of
murdering their daughter Amanda was found not proven, but Mr Auld did not
defend the action and there was no court hearing.
Mrs Mullan was said to feel personally vindicated by the court's decision. Mr
John O'Donnell, a solicitor speaking on her behalf, said she was pleased but
not surprised by the outcome.
He added that Mrs Mullan had never been interested in making Scottish legal
history despite the ground-breaking nature of her legal battle.

<RECORDNO>974782483</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A TEACHER acquitted last week of assaulting three unruly pupils was yesterday
also cleared by his employers of any professional misconduct.
Thomas McGhee, 40, was told the news at the end of a three-hour disciplinary
hearing at Central Regional Council's headquarters in Stirling. He is a senior
teacher at a primary school in the area.
Although he was not suspended and continued to teach while awaiting the court
case, Mr McGhee said that at times he had found it difficult to cope.
``I'm just relieved the whole thing is over and perhaps I can get back to
teaching the class in a normal situation again.
``I've had enough of court and the legal system for the rest of my life. I did
not have any doubts of the outcome.''
Mr Ken Wimbor, EIS assistant secretary, who accompanied Mr McGhee to the
hearing, said the union's lawyers would be meeting with local authorities in
the new year in the hope of resolving the issue of discipline guidelines.
He insisted that teachers faced a dilemma in disciplining rowdy pupils.
If they did intervene they faced the possibility of appearing in court accused
of assault, then a professional disciplinary hearing. If they turned a blind
eye they could be accused of negligence.
He said: ``I'm obviously concerned that any member has to endure this kind of
pressure for so long.
``The fact that Tom was found not guilty last week and the charges have not
been upheld following a disciplinary hearing are obviously a concern.
``It's not fair to have two procedures and that's one of the matters we'll be
examining with some urgency.''
Councillors on Central's education committee welcomed the news that Mr McGhee
had been cleared.
Conservative Councillor Helen Scott said: ``It seems a little bit unnecessary
to have a disciplinary hearing after the court has made its decision.
``I think it's extremely difficult for teachers when they are faced with
violence in the classroom and I think there's a lack of guidance. I'm sure they
need help in that way.''
Evelyn Boyce, Central's head of school development, who conducted yesterday's
hearing, said: ``Mr McGhee was not sacrificed on the altar of political
correctness or any other altar.
``For many years teachers have not been able to use corporal punishment not
because of political correctness but to create an appropriate environment for
young people, and because there are other means available of disciplining
pupils.''
Mrs Boyce defended holding the disciplinary hearing. ``There are two separate
processes each with their own integrity.
``Our responsibility as employers means we have a duty to ensure our employees
are not involved in any misconduct.
``We're not above the law but we do have separate duties as employers and the
criteria that apply in a court of law are not necessarily the criteria we have
to look at.''
Mrs Boyce said it would be difficult to give clearer guidelines to teachers on
discipline.
She explained: ``It's not always possible to give very specific guidance
because each situation can be unique and different.
``Given that all situations are unique and different it wouldn't be possible to
lay down recommendations as to the minimum level of contact there should be
between teachers and pupils.
``But recommendations have to be that contact should always be at the minimum
level and cannot be excessive in any circumstances.''
Mr McGhee was cleared in court of assaulting three boy pupils. Two boys claimed
he had banged their heads together and the other alleged he had grabbed him by
the face and lifted him off the ground.
Mr McGhee said he had simply given the two a ticking off, and used the crook of
his finger to lift the other boy's chin up so that he could get eye contact.

CAROL Wardell was a conscientious woman who threw herself into her career after
finding out she could not have the children she longed for.
The Coventry-born bank worker had been promoted rapidly after joining the
Woolwich as a cashier at its Coventry branch 13 years ago. She met her future
husband at a party in Hinckley, Leicestershire.
When they began chatting she found out she had been taught by Wardell's mother
and soon after a romance began to blossom.
His parents were impressed by her devotion to him and hoped she would help
Wardell, who had been in and out of work since leaving prison, settle down.
The couple married on April 17, 1982, at the Holy Trinity church in Coventry.
They moved into the three-bedroomed detached home built on the former Triumph
Bonneville motorcycle factory site in rural Warwickshire.
Her work never interfered with her home life and she was a regular dinner
hostess who kept a meticulously clean household.
Mrs Wardell was described as fun-loving by colleagues who admired her calm
influence in the work place.
Her older brother Tony Heslop, who lives in Rugby, Warwickshire, said at the
time of her death: ``She and Gordon had been trying for a family for years but
she never managed to fall pregnant. It appears she could not have children.''
Oxford Crown Court had heard that Wardell had not had sex with his wife for six
months before her death and the relationship had been suffering because he had
been made redundant and was out of work for a time.
Betty Wardell, 68, paid tribute to her daughter-in-law. ``Carol was Gordon's
whole life. Initially Carol was not very ambitious but it grew over the years.
She worked so hard and took at least two examinations a year.''
Mrs Wardell did charity work in her spare time. She was a founder member of
Share, a Coventry based self-help and relaxation group.
She also gave her free time to a charity for the mentally handicapped.
Mrs Wardell had experience of dealing with an armed raid at her workplace. She
was praised by her employers after facing a gunman who grabbed #180 at her
Nuneaton branch in February 1992.

A MEETING of the new East of Scotland Water Authority was cancelled yesterday
after being disrupted by demonstrators.
A Santa Claus figure burst into the council chambers of Newtown St Boswell's in
the Borders to make his protest about the role of the authority.
Mr Norman Walkins, from Edinburgh, strode through the door, shouting: ``Bah!
Humbug! Don't pay for the fat cats. We are not paying for water boards in
Scotland - you are unelected, and we don't want you.''
Mr Walkins was backed up by 14 people already in place in the public benches.
Banners were unfurled, a whistle was blown, and various chants were made. Dr
Ian Preston, chairman of the authority, called the meeting to a halt.
Some of the protesters carried Scottish Militant Labour badges.
Only two items of business were concluded in the public session. One was that
staff would be fully consulted about the new water authority set-up, with a
``hot line'' established for guidance. The other was that its new headquarters
would be located in Pentland Gate office park on the west side of Edinburgh,
with the intention of moving in before April 1.
The authority had met in private session earlier, and the chairman said after
the interrupted meeting that no decision had been made on the fixing of charges.

LAST year Prince Charles appeared on ITV and admitted being unfaithful to his
wife. Last month the Princess of Wales confessed on BBC to adultery. Last night
the Queen urged that the couple seek an early divorce.
The Queen's no-holds-barred intervention goes way beyond the ``no constraints''
interviews which involved her son and daughter-in-law.
Presumably, the last straw was the princess's private thoughts in her first
solo television interview.
The Panorama broadcast took place almost three years after deep divisions
emerged in what was once seen as a ``fairy-tale'' marriage.
Now the conversations with reporter Martin Bashir, covering every stage of her
life, take on even more importance.
Because, regardless of constitutional questions raised by the Queen's
intervention, the princess cast doubts in front of 15 million viewers on
Charles's suitability to be king.
She even hinted that it might be better if Prince William succeeded the Queen.
In a key passage, she said that being king, or the ``top job as I call it,''
could be ``suffocating'' for Charles.
And, asked if she would accept a divorce - if her husband wished it, she
replied: ``I would obviously discuss it with him, but up to date neither of us
has discussed this subject.'' Asked if it was her wish to divorce, she replied:
``No, it's not my wish.''
The princess was also asked if it was her wish that Prince William should
succeed the Queen, rather than her husband. Her reply: ``My wish is that my
husband finds peace of mind, and from that follows other things, yes.''

It started with a kiss: the Prince and Princess of Wales on the balcony of
Buckingham Palace on their wedding day in 1981.
It was hailed as the `wedding of the century', but cracks appeared in the royal
marriage almost from the beginning, reports Roger Williams
THE fairy-tale marriage between the Prince and Princess of Wales started with
the ``wedding of the century'', but soon became a public prison for both
partners trapped in a loveless union.
Cracks appeared in the early 1980s, and after Prince Harry's birth in 1984 the
couple drifted irretrievably apart.
But the split was acknowledged only in December 1992, when their formal
separation was announced.
The last few years have seen a succession of claims about the troubled
marriage, culminating in Andrew Morton's biography of Diana in 1992 and
Charles's authorised biography by Jonathan Dimbleby last year.
The revelations in the books show that the marriage which was sealed with a
kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace was difficult from the start and ended
in bitterness.
1981 - In February, after months of speculation, Buckingham Palace announces
the prince's engagement to 19-year-old Lady Diana Spencer. The couple marry on
July 29 at St Paul's Cathedral.
1982 - Prince William is born in June. Charles, away from the public gaze while
Diana basks in public affection, resents her skill at enchanting ordinary
people.
Their interests take them in different directions, and Diana has little time
for Charles's philosophic wanderings.
1984 - Prince Harry is born in September.
1987 - A rift in the marriage becomes increasingly obvious, prompting furious
media speculation about a possible split. The prince spends more than a month
at Balmoral, apart from his wife and family.
1991 - Relations are said to be so cool between Charles and Diana that they are
reported to have separate rooms during a State visit to Czechoslovakia.
By their 10th wedding anniversary, the relationship has died altogether. They
have separate holidays, separate friends, separate and rival households, and
almost, but not quite, separate homes.
But they still portray a semblance of unity in front of the cameras and in the
eyes of the public.
1992 - Andrew Morton's book Diana: Her True Story, is published in June. It
says the princess feels ``trapped in a loveless marriage'', suggests she
suffered from the slimmer's disease bulimia nervosa, and that she made a number
of suicide attempts in the early 1980s.
In August the ``Squidgygate'' tape scandal breaks, giving details of an
intimate telephone conversation said to be between Diana and long-standing
friend James Gilbey, in which he professes his love for her and calls her
``Squidgy''.
In November comes the ``Camillagate'' tape - allegedly a highly personal and
intimate conversation between the prince and Camilla Parker Bowles.
That same month, during a four-day visit to Korea, the prince and princess are
dubbed ``The Glums'', with reports that they are apparently unable to bear
being in each other's company.
The press unites to declare the marriage a sham and for the first time the
truth of the couple's unhappiness together begins to gain wide acceptance.
In December, the Prime Minister announces to a packed House of Commons that the
couple have agreed to separate.
1993 - In March an Australian TV company broadcast fresh extracts from the
Squidgygate tapes, alleging that the relationship between Diana and Gilbey was
much more intimate than previously claimed.
Charles and Diana attend some functions together - but mostly lead separate
lives.
In December the princess announces her withdrawal from public life and asks to
be allowed to live away from the media spotlight.
1994 - In June Charles admits to Jonathan Dimbleby, in a television
documentary, that he has been unfaithful to his wife. He says he has no
``regrets'' about the admission and believes he will still be crowned king.
In October Anna Pasternak's book about former Army officer James Hewitt's
alleged five-year affair with Diana is published, fuelling speculation that the
royal couple will divorce. But through their lawyers they deny plans for a
settlement.
Later in the month, the Sunday Times starts serialising Jonathan Dimbleby's
biography of Charles, which goes far further than the television interview,
giving an unprecedented insight into the prince's private life.
1995 - In August, Diana is linked with another man, England Rugby captain Will
Carling, after they become friends while training at an exclusive gym in
Chelsea, west London, and Mr Carling visits her at Kensington Palace.
The rugby player and his wife Julia later separate.
In September the prince and princess put on a public display of family unity
when they join Prince William on his first day at Eton.
But within a few weeks, the prince appears in public at a high society party at
London's Ritz hotel attended by Mrs Parker Bowles, refuelling speculation about
their relationship.
In November, an unprecedented interview with Diana is broadcast on the BBC's
Panorama, in which the princess reveals that she often feels herself under
attack from her husband's party, but insists that she does not want a divorce.
Earlier this month, it is suggested that Diana will be spending Christmas with
the royal family at Sandringham, but a few days ago it is announced that the
princess has changed her mind.
The decision is interpreted as a snub to the royals, but it is not yet known if
the princess had received the Queen's letter before deciding to stay away.

IF the Prince and Princess of Wales divorce, Diana would not become Queen,
according to a constitutional expert.
Laws and customs meant even if Diana's popularity and worldwide fame made her
ideal for the role, she would still be barred, said Dr Rodney Barker.
For a king could not choose a queen other than his wife.
But the royal family had enough power over titles to agree that Diana could
retain the title ``princess'' and perhaps that she remain ``Her Royal
Highness''.
The Prime Minister was unquestionably right when he said - announcing the
Wales's separation in December 1992 - that Diana could still be crowned queen,
according to Dr Barker, of the London School of Economics.
But divorce was a different matter.
Even if Charles renounced any intention of remarrying, he could not agree that
Diana could be queen to his king.
``It is inconceivable and constitutionally out-of-court that a person called
queen has neither succeeded to the throne in her own right nor is married to
the person who succeeded in his own right.''
By custom, said Dr Barker, a king's wife was crowned queen but queens - such as
Elizabeth II and Victoria - refrained from having their consorts crowned king.
``That is probably because of the ridiculous assumption that if there is a king
and a queen, the king is the important one.''
A divorced Diana could perhaps retain the title Princess of Wales, but that
seemed unlikely, he said.
Whether or not Charles had any intention at present of remarrying, allowing a
divorced Diana to retain the title would be seen by advisers as risking
confusion if, at some later stage, the prince took a new bride.
``You can hardly have two princesses of Wales,'' said Dr Barker. ``But one can
speculate that the palace could allow the use of the title Princess Diana.''
The title ``Her Royal Highness'' - famously denied the Duchess of Windsor after
the abdication of Edward VIII - was an honour for closely defined members of
the immediate royal family.
But, particularly as Diana was mother of Princes William and Harry, the Queen
could use her wide discretion to allow her to retain the style HRH.
Dr Barker said a divorce would not affect the rights of the young princes to
succeed to the throne.
Their father would remain immediate heir to the throne.
A divorce would have no direct constitutional significance, partly because the
eighteenth century Act of Settlement and Royal Marriages Act made no mention of
it. ``I imagine that was because in those days such a possibility wasn't even
considered.''
The way to divorce is clear. Just like thousands of unhappy couples who divorce
each year, the royal couple's names would be added to the list of individuals
parted on the nod of a County Court judge.
If both parties reach an amicable agreement, the whole process could be
concluded within a matter of weeks without any need to involve solicitors.
Under current law, all that is required is for the necessary legal papers to be
completed and a payment of #40.
A judge will then normally grant a provisional decree nisi, allowing the
parties a breathing space.
Six weeks later, unless the couple have changed their minds, the decree
absolute will automatically be granted and the marriage legally terminated.
Divorce can only take place if a marriage has irretrievably broken down.
To support this, at least one of five grounds must be proved: adultery,
unreasonable behaviour, desertion of two years or more by the respondent or two
years continuous separation - in which case a judge may refuse a decree if he
feels divorce might adversely affect the children - and a separation of five
years, which allows either side a decree without the consent of the other.

<HEADLINE>Cheating chief of law firm jailed for 10 years</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974782490</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE former head of a large law firm was jailed for 10 years yesterday for
plundering more than #5m from dead clients and charities, including Guide Dogs
for the Blind.
Graham Durnford Ford, 52, carried out ``substantial and systematic thieving''
over a two-year period, the court heard.
He paid himself almost #900,000 in four years and used the rest to prop up his
law firm, one of the largest in the South-east of England.
Judge David Croft at Maidstone Crown Court called it ``cheating the dead''. He
added: ``What you did was build a dung hill for you to crawl upon.''
His plundering was often to such an extent that beneficiaries of wills were
left with virtually nothing to inherit after they were fooled by ``grossly,
almost ludicrously, excessive fees''.
Durnford Ford, described as a tyrant by his senior partners, headed a law firm
in Hastings, Sussex, with branches in Battle, Bexhill, Eastbourne, Hailsham,
Polegate, Rye, Seaford, Ashford, in Kent, and London.
He used most of the money to keep his company afloat and to give the appearance
of a successful businessman enjoying ``a very good living''.
Following his arrest by the serious fraud office, his firm collapsed with the
loss of 230 jobs.
Durnford Ford admitted 10 specimen charges of theft amounting to #148,700. He
was jailed for one year on every charge, to run consecutively.
Mr Timothy Barnes, prosecuting, said it was not in the public interest to
divulge the exact amount stolen. But he added: ``The extent of the losses is
not less than #5m.''
The total losses paid out by the law society in compensation are #8.7m, the
court was told.
Other former directors now have to pay 50% of their salary, plus any windfall
payments, to the Law Society. Contributions by other solicitors throughout the
country to the Law Society compensation fund have also increased.
One estate of #33,800 was reduced by Durnford Ford to #530. Another fell from
#62,000 to just #9200 and a bequest of #140,000 to the Guide Dogs Association
plunged to #13,500.
Durnford Ford, of South Lodge, Saxon Hill, North Trade Road, Battle, Sussex,
denied four charges of furnishing false information and these were left on file.
His co-accused, William Bew, 38, of Cirencester, also denied four charges of
furnishing false information.
He was found guilty of all four charges by the jury after an eight-week trial.
He was given 15 months, suspended for one year.
Bew resigned just five days before the firm collapsed. He chose not to give
evidence during his trial.
He was a junior partner and was worried about the way the company was being
run, but was too timid to tackle his chief.
The court was told insurance policies of more than #70,000 were cashed to pay
advance school for Durnford Ford's daughters.
Mr Peter Hilton, defending, said: ``As a fraudster Mr Durnford Ford is in the
upper league. His conduct has had a crippling effect on his partners.''
Judge Croft told the court Durnford Ford was one of the most devious conmen he
had come across.
``Bew was one of your direct victims. You corrupted him and you caused him to
be in the dock today,'' he said.
Durnford Ford has been struck off.

<HEADLINE>Memorial to Ibrox disaster planned</HEADLINE>

A PERMANENT memorial to the 66 Rangers supporters who lost their lives in the
Ibrox disaster 25 years ago is to be erected by the club.
Mr Campbell Ogilvie, club secretary, said it would allow fans to remember
friends or relatives who died, and serve as a lasting reminder for all Rangers
supporters.
The disaster occured at Stairway 13 on January 2, 1971. Supporters were leaving
the New Year Old Firm game as Rangers scored an equaliser in the closing
seconds. In the confusion, as fans turned and hesitated, someone fell and
others became caught in the crush.
As well as the death toll, almost 200 people were injured in what was the worst
football disaster in British history until Hillsborough.
``I have been involved with the club for 35 years and irrespective of
everything I have been through this is the saddest day I can remember,'' said
Mr Ogilvie.
It had been hoped to have the new memorial sited at the Govan/Copland corner of
the stadium opened for New Year, but that will not be possible because of
present construction work.
``The new stadium is in fact the greatest memorial to those who died,'' added
Mr Ogilvie. ``It was after the disaster that Mr Waddell, the team manager, and
his board of directors decided to modernise Ibrox. New legislation came out in
1975 but even before then, Mr Waddell had plans on how he wanted the look of
the club.''

TWO Labour MPs at the heart of last week's controversial Govan selection battle
face severe disciplinary action from the party for going off on holiday this
week and missing Tuesday night's crucial vote against the Government.
Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson last week narrowly defeated rival candidate
Councillor Mohammad Sarwar for the redrawn Govan seat. Mr Watson was strongly
supported in his campaign by neighbouring MP Ian Davidson, currently
representing the old constituency of that name but likely to contest the new
Pollok seat.
Neither Mr Watson, who is with his wife at an unknown holiday destination
abroad, nor Mr Davidson, who is in Sri Lanka with his wife and two children,
had prior permission to miss the crucial vote and will face the wrath of Chief
Whip Donald Dewar on their return.
London MP Brian Sedgemore was also absent, on a trip to Barbados, and what
rankles with the Whips is that the loss of these three votes cost Labour
victory on its own more critical motion. Fortunately for the three, they had
the consolation of the Government's motion falling by two votes.
Mr Watson, however, must consider the party's national executive meeting next
month to consider a demand for a rerun of the Govan contest.
One of Mr Watson's supporters in Govan, party activist Archie Graham, defended
him yesterday: ``Mike's voting record as an MP is second to none and I would be
absolutely amazed if Mike was somewhere and the Whips could not get hold of him.
``I am assuming he advised them that he was going away for a few days for a
family holiday. If there has been any difficulty I can only assume there has
been some sort of misunderstanding.
``The man never had a family holiday in the summer because of all the stress
and strain and work that had to be done for the reselection battle. It was a
well-earned break.''
Critics from the rival Sarwar camp see it differently. Pollok party member
Stewart Daniels said he had begun as a Watson supporter but had changed to the
rival camp.
He said yesterday he would be writing to Mr Dewar expressing concern about time
off granted from Westminster for the selection campaign and the absences on
Tuesday night.
Two other Scottish MPs missed Tuesday night's vote but both had permission.
Pollok MP Jimmie Dunnachie was absent for health reasons and was paired with an
ill Tory MP, while Clydesdale MP James Hood attended a European engagement
accompanied by his Conservative counterpart.
One Labour MP said of Mr Davidson last night: ``It is inexplicable that a man
now relying on the goodwill of a Labour leadership seeking to end the year on a
triumph should have acted in this way.''
The SNP was quick to capitalise on events. ``If such an attitude is the best
that Labour can offer, then it simply underlines the need for change in Govan
and throughout Scotland,'' said the party's candidate in the constituency, Ms
Nicola Sturgeon.

<HEADLINE>Monklands council cleared of `jobs for the boys' Inquiry fails to silence critics</HEADLINE>

MONKLANDS District Council was cleared yesterday of providing ``jobs for the
boys'' by an independent inquiry set up by the Government, but critics refused
to let the matter rest.
As Labour leader Jim Brooks and his colleagues celebrated, political opponents
pledged to continue their campaign over allegations of nepotism and religious
bias.
The next step in the saga is likely to come from Labour's own hierarchy next
month.
The party's national executive committee is due to consider its unpublished
report into the allegations and the suspension of some 15 Labour councillors in
Monklands since June.
Mr William Nimmo Smith, QC, in an 83-page report, found no evidence to support
any allegation of religious bias or nepotism in making job appointments within
the council. He also found no evidence to support allegations that Labour Party
connections or membership had a material effect on appointments.
However, the QC said the council's previous employment procedures had given
rise to the perception that appointments had been made for improper reasons.
Mr Nimmo Smith, who described Councillor Brooks as ``a strong-willed man who
liked to control the exercise of power'', went on: ``I think that much of the
trouble which has arisen, and in particular the allegations with which I am
concerned, stem from the insensitive exercise of power. If power is exercised
in such a way as to lead to a sense of exclusion, suspicions are more readily
aroused and rumours and allegations gain currency.''
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said the report concluded that the council
had not failed to comply with requirements of Section 7 of the Local Government
and Housing Act, 1989. He added: ``No further action is therefore required by
me.''
Councillor Brooks said: ``I am delighted with the report. It is a vindication
in detail of the people of Monklands.''
However, English Tory MP David Shaw, who was castigated in the official report,
last night insisted his campaign would continue regardless of the findings.
Mr Shaw, whose attitude on giving evidence was described as irresponsible by Mr
Nimmo Smith, said: ``It is not irresponsible to raise matters of amazing
concern to people. No one will be satisfied with this report, apart from those
with vested family and financial interests in the outcome.''
The Dover MP added: ``As far as I am concerned, this matter will never be
over.''
He argued, as did Scottish Tory chairman Sir Michael Hirst and rebel Monklands
Labour councillors, that the terms of the inquiry had been too narrow.
The council's SNP group spokesman, Mr Neil Douglas, dismissed the report as a
Scottish Office-prompted sham, and also complained the inquiry should have
extended beyond employment practices.
Critics were also unhappy that the inquiry had been legally restricted to
investigating events after 1990. Some allegations of ``jobs for the boys''
dated before then. In addition, job application procedures had been altered
since 1994.
The Government inquiry followed allegations that people could get jobs with
Monklands if they were relatives or friends of councillors, or connected to the
Labour Party, or were of a certain religious persuasion.
However, the remit did not cover other allegations: including a spending bias
in favour of Coatbridge by Roman Catholic councillors against the mainly
Protestant town of Airdrie.
The inquiry also followed another, commissioned by the council itself and
chaired by
Professor Robert Black, whose findings failed to eliminate public concerns that
the council was run by a ``Monklands Mafia''.
His report coincided with the entire Monkland ruling group being suspended by
the Labour Party pending its investigation into the allegations.
Professor Black's report was described by Mr Nimmo Smith yesterday as ``a
disappointment''. So far as employment issues were concerned, it did ``no more
than repeat allegations which were already current''.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ``This report is a vindication
of the Labour Party's demand two years ago for this kind of inquiry to get at
the truth.``
He conceded there were strong criticisms in the report of councillors and
council procedures which gave rise to the allegations. But he was adamant:
``The wilder allegations of Ministers and David Shaw have been firmly
rejected.''
Monklands West MP Tom Clarke welcomed the ``thorough report'' and the
conclusion that there was no evidence to substantiate the claims.
Scottish Conservative chairman Sir Michael Hirst said: ``It should be
remembered that the terms of reference were very narrow. Notwithstanding the
findings, the council accepted and implemented a number of recommendations from
consultants to improve their recruitment and employment methods. This all came
about only after the Monklands stooshie blew up.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said: ``No democrat could have
taken any consolation from a finding there had been malpractice in Monklands.
The report is therefore a timely reassurance that the council did not fail to
comply with its duties.''

AN abused mother was admonished by a judge yesterday after she killed her
husband with a single stab wound through the heart.
Mother-of-two Jean Digney, 44, was allowed to walk free from the High Court in
Edinburgh by Lord Abernethy.
She was originally charged with murdering her husband, Mr James Digney, but her
plea to the reduced charge of culpable homicide was accepted when she appeared
in court last year.
The couple's son had found his father dead in a chair and his mother weeping in
their home in Wallace Road, Irvine, Ayrshire.
Lord Abernethy deferred sentence on her for a year to be of good behaviour. He
admonished her yesterday.
The judge heard at the earlier hearing at the High Court in Glasgow that she
had been terrorised by her husband and that he had demanded sex from her at all
hours.
The stabbing victim suffered from polio and was taking steroids which
heightened his sexual demand. He made obsessive sexual demands at all times of
the day, it was alleged.
The court heard that on the fatal night in September last year the couple, who
had an 11-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter, had been arguing and
drinking.
Mrs Digney later told police: ``I didn't mean to kill him. I just got hold of
the knife. I killed their dad.''
The court was told that Mrs Digney's son Keiran was a diabetic who had had to
go into hospital while his mother was remanded in prison before her initial
appearance in the High Court last December.
Lord Abernethy originally agreed to defer sentence on her for a year because
she was needed at home to care for her son. He decided she was not a threat to
the public.
Last night the dead man's widowed mother Mrs Mary Digney, 66, said from her
home at Dunton Knoll, Irvine: ``I don't think justice has been done, although
for the children's sake I'm glad she's free. I'm not fit to look after them.''

A SCOTTISH family have put their house on the market to save their pets from a
builder's ban on animals.
Ralph and Anna Baillie moved into their new, #145,000 home four months ago with
their three children and their three pets.
But now, the family are having to sell up so that the children can keep their
pets.
Muir Homes Ltd has threatened legal action unless the Baillies get rid of
Guin-Guin the guinea pig, Bun-Bun the rabbit, and Shamu their Samoyed dog. The
Inverkeithing-based firm has told the family that it will act to enforce a
clause in the title deeds which prohibits the keeping of ``livestock''.
Now, after heartfelt pleas by their children - Charles, 11, nine-year-old
Miranda, and six-year-old Henrietta - the Baillies have opted to sell their
three-bedroom, detached house in Bridgewater Avenue, Auchterarder, Perthshire.
Guin-guin belongs to Henrietta, Bun-bun has been Miranda's since he was a
bunny, and Shamu is the favourite of all the family.
Charles, Miranda, and Henrietta are so devoted to their pets that they even
told their parents to forget about presents this Christmas and let them keep
the animals instead.
Mr Baillie, 38, a post-graduate business student at the University of London,
said, ``The animals are a part of this family and the children would be
devastated if we had to get rid of them.
``This was supposed to be our dream home but Muir Homes have left us with no
option but to move.'' He added, ``It is a ridiculous situation. The children
will need to be moved to new schools and it will take time to settle in to
another house.
``But it is the only way to keep the entire family together, including the pets.
``Muir Homes has an annual turnover of #32m. I can't believe they are being so
strict about something so minor.''
The family's rabbit and guinea pig are kept outside in a hutch and the dog also
spends part of the day in the back garden in his kennel.
The Baillie's home is part of a development of a dozen new homes with several
still for sale, and is next door to the scheme's show house.
Muir Homes maintains neighbours have complained about the animals but the
Baillies have been around all of their neighbours and claim that none have
admitted to objecting to the pets.
An offer by the Baillies not to replace the existing pets as they died off was
rejected by the builders which threatened legal action unless the animals are
disposed of by the end of this week.
Mr Ian Steven, conveyancing partner at Rollo, Steven and Bond solicitors, said:
``On the face of it, this does seem fairly mean of the builder.
``But they want to sell their houses and most modern schemes now do have
clauses limiting pets to one dog or one cat. It is to stop people breeding
animals and is a universal clause in most modern developments.''
The Baillies previously lived in the countryside, outside Crieff, with no
neighbours.
Last night Mrs Baillie, 33, a jewellery designer, vowed that she would ``never
live in a modern housing estate again.
``Our solicitor pointed out the clause in the deeds to us but we didn't think
that `livestock' meant the childrens' pets,'' she said.
She added: ``There is no way we can get rid of the animals, it would be
heartbreaking. If the animals go, we go.''
A spokesman for Muir Homes said that the matter was in the hands of the
company's solicitors and it did not wish to discuss the situation further.

<HEADLINE>Queen orders divorce Dilemma for Diana as Charles agrees to the final parting</HEADLINE>

THE Queen has urged the Prince and Princess of Wales to seek ``an early
divorce'', and Charles has agreed.
Buckingham Palace said last night that the Queen made her dramatic intervention
in a letter to each of them this week.
Her move came amid continued public debate about the effect of the marital
disagreement on the future of the royal family and the monarchy.
A Palace spokesman said the prince responded to the letter by indicating that
he agreed with his mother, but the princess's response was not known.
``After considering the present situation the Queen wrote to both the prince
and princess earlier this week and gave them her view, supported by the Duke of
Edinburgh, that an early divorce is desirable,'' the spokesman said.
``The Prince of Wales also takes this view and has made this known to the
Princess of Wales since the letter.
``The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will continue to do all they can to help
and support the Prince and Princess of Wales, and most particularly their
children, in this difficult period.''
There was no indication how soon a divorce could take place, and how imminent
any further announcement might be, he said.
The Queen's action came weeks after the public debate about the future of the
marriage was heightened dramatically by the princess's interview on Panorama.
In it she said she did not want a divorce, but was repeatedly critical of her
husband, his family, and their advisers.
Constitutional experts have said that a divorce would mean Diana could never be
queen.
When asked on Panorama if she wanted to be queen, she said that she was more
interested in being a ``Queen of Hearts'' by developing her role in public life.
The Palace spokesman declined to say when the Queen's letters were sent, other
than earlier this week.
He said there was no connection between the letter and the princess's
apparently sudden decision not to join her estranged husband and the rest of
the royal family at Sandringham for Christmas.
It is understood the princess told the Queen on Sunday that she had changed her
mind about Christmas, less than a month after letting it be known that she
would be at Sandringham.
The Prime Minister and senior Privy Councillors have backed the Queen's
decision after prolonged private talks over the last two weeks.
The Buckingham Palace announcement last night followed discussion between the
Queen and her Prime Minister after the Princess of Wales spoke on Panorama of
``enemies''.
The Prime Minister will undoubtedly welcome the prospect of an apparent end to
the ``War of the Waleses''.
He has long believed the present situation was unsatisfactory and untenable,
especially when there appeared to be no immediate prospect of a complete split.
Mr Major, who announced the couple's original separation in the Commons, will
make a further statement to MPs once divorce proceedings are in train.
The news broke hours after the princess met Mr Major at her home in Kensington
Palace.
He is thought to have discussed her known wish for an officially recognised
role in public life, probably as some kind of goodwill ambassador. Mr Major,
who is understood to have met the Princess privately two or three times a year
at Kensington Palace, has been a strong supporter of her desire for such a role.
It seemed certain that she would have raised the question of divorce in the
light of the Queen's letter.
Mr Major has given his consent to a royal divorce as he was obliged to do as
Prime Minister at the Queen's bidding. The issue was not handled at Cabinet
level but on a one-to-one basis when the Prime Minister saw the Queen at a
weekly audience two days ago.
Constitutional experts have been working on this scenario for several years and
Prince William remains, after his father, successor to the throne.
In her Panorama interview on November 20, Diana said she did not want a
divorce. She told interviewer Martin Bashir: ``I don't want a divorce but
obviously we need clarity. I await my husband's decision of which way we are
all going to go.''
She described her feelings on her separation from her husband: ``Deep, deep,
profound sadness. Because we had struggled to keep it going, but obviously we'd
both run out of steam.
``And in a way I suppose it could have been a relief for us both that we'd
finally made our minds up. But my husband asked for the separation and I
supported it.''
She said she had not asked for a separation: ``I come from a divorced
background and I didn't want to go into that one again.''
Constitutional expert and former Conservative Cabinet Minister Lord St John of
Fawsley said: ``I think it is extremely sad that events have come to this.
``I feel, however, that the Queen was quite right to intervene and to say they
must now make up their minds to divorce, or make a go of it. Clearly they are
not going to make a go of it.''
Lord St John said a divorce
Continued from page 1
would have no constitutional effect on the Prince of Wales. ``But it will have
an effect on the Princess of Wales because when the divorce goes through she
will not become queen. But it has no effect on his position under the Act of
Settlement.''
Constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor also said there were no constitutional
implications in a divorce.
``We have had a divorced king before,'' he told Newsnight.
``Once the divorce has gone through, Diana is no longer the wife of the heir to
the throne, so she no longer becomes queen and that is an important resolution
of the problem, because as long as they are not divorced she would become Queen
as soon as Charles ascended to the throne.''
A Tory Minister applauded the Queen's decision to call for an ``early divorce''.
Sir John Wheeler, a Minister in the Northern Ireland Office, said: ``As one of
Her Majesty's Privy Councillors, I welcome the decision.
``It is a good thing to clear the air in the interests of constitutional
monarchy and for the good of the two people concerned.''
Senior Tory MP Sir Teddy Taylor, a strong supporter of the princess, said:
``What is most unusual is the fact that this information had been made public.
``It is disappointing that this kind of intervention in a highly charged
situation between two young people has been made public.
``Whoever made it public should be locked in the Tower or thrown in the
Thames.''
Conservative MP James Hill, chairman of the Commons Constitutional Committee,
said: ``I think it is excellent news but as I have said for some months that
family and domestic problems should be resolved and I am very pleased that the
Queen has acted. I think this has been in my mind for some months now but the
problem of young children has to be clarified.
``As far as the end of the affair I hope it is amicable and there is no longer
any tit-for-tat. I think it will be the best thing for the nation.''
Senior Tory MP Sir Patrick Cormack said: ``Sadly I believe divorce is
inevitable.
"It would be unthinkable to have an estranged, but still married, king and
queen.''
He suggested the princess's Panorama interview, in which she said she was
opposed to the idea of divorce, had hastened the issue.
``That interview was a very sad and sorry performance in many ways.
``She did everything to demonstrate that the marriage was over, everything to
question her husband's fitness to be king.''

INTER-Milan manager Roy Hodgson, newly sacked as coach of Scotland's European
Championship opponents Switzerland, could become a soccer spy for Craig Brown.
Brown has spoken to Hodgson and has already asked him to visit the Scotland
training camp during the championships next summer. He believes Hodgson can be
an important aid as he plans for the final match of our three-country section
against the Swiss.
Said Brown yesterday: ``I know Roy very well and I was speaking to him on the
telephone just after he was told that the Swiss no longer wanted him to look
after the national team. Obviously, he was upset, because it had seemed that
the Swiss FA had agreed to a dual role for him, one which would have allowed
him to coach Inter-Milan and remain with the Swiss for their European
Championship games.
``Even after the draw at the weekend, Roy was under the impression that he
would remain in charge. Then on Tuesday, he was told that Artur Jorge from
Portugal was taking over.
``I don't think the Swiss players will react too well to this change. Roy was
highly respected by them and, after all, it was under his guidance that they
went to the World Cup finals for the first time in nearly 30 years.
``Now he's gone and I have to admit that this is a boost for us. It will
unsettle the Swiss and upset their planning and organisation, and they have
been major components in their recent successes.
``I know, too, that if I ask Roy a straight question then he will give me a
straight answer. If I want to know anything about his former team then I am
sure he will tell me, and he will be honest.
``We will be looking at all the teams in the group ourselves, but I believe Roy
will be able to give us some valuable insights.''
Enlisting Hodgson's aid, even in a modest manner, could add substantially to
Brown's dossier on the Swiss. He knows them already, of course, from the last
World Cup qualifying campaign, when they were one of the teams who prevented
Scotland from reaching the United States.
Brown insists: ``We have arranged for videos of all the recent games played by
our three opponents in the European finals and we will look at all their games
from now on.
``If I cannot see them myself, then Alex Miller or Frank Coulston will go to
see them. Our preparations must be as thorough as they were during the
qualifying period - and they will be.
``The England game will be particularly intriguing, of course. We have the
prospect of clashes between team-mates to look forward to - Colin Calderwood
could be asked to take care of Teddy Sheringham, Colin Hendry versus Alan
Shearer, and even Stuart McCall against Paul Gascoigne. All of them will want
to get the better of the lads they train alongside every day.
``That is going to add a bit to a game that really doesn't need any more
ingredients to whip up interest.
``The Dutch are liable to miss Danny Blind through suspension and he is the man
who organises their defence. He is the main inspiration at the back and the
young players in the team look to him for guidance. So that could help.''
The Scots' team manager has now agreed with the International Committee that
only two warm-up games will be played before the end of the season. One of
these will be at home against a major European country in March - and the
opponents will be announced later this week.
The other is the game against reigning European champions Denmark in Copenhagen
in April.
Following that, the Scottish squad will travel to the United States in May to
play two more games. Both are likely to be in New York, one against the United
States and the other could be against Chile.
These will be Brown's final opportunities to get the squad ready for the games
in England in June.
Meanwhile, the players that Hodgson had moulded into one of the most dangerous
international sides in Europe were indeed angered by the Swiss football
federation's treatment of the Englishman.
``I am very, very disappointed,'' Bayern Munich forward Ciri Sforza told a
Swiss newspaper. ``I just don't understand why they made the decision.''
``It would have been better to hold our team together until the finals,'' said
captain Alain Geiger.
q ANOTHER manager whose position is under threat is the Republic of Ireland's
Jack Charlton, who will meet Football Association of Ireland officials today
with speculation mounting that his nine-year reign will come to an end.
It is believed the Republic are anxious to have a new man installed by January
23, when the dates for the World Cup fixtures will be sorted out.
The FAI yesterday refused to elaborate on the Dublin meeting, saying only: ``It
is purely speculation in the papers. There is no news conference planned.''
Millwall manager Mick McCarthy, who played for the national side with
distinction, is among the front-runners to replace Charlton.
Charlton was hoping to celebrate 10 years in charge by leading the Republic in
the European Championship finals next summer, but those dreams were dashed when
they were outclassed by Holland in the play-off at Anfield last week, their
fourth defeat in five games.
The manner of that 2-0 defeat by the Dutch not only disappointed Charlton but
many of the FAI hierachy, who now feel a change is essential if they are to
progress.
Charlton, 60, has dragged the Republic up by their bootlaces during his time in
charge. Under his unique style of management, Ireland have lost only 17 times
in 93 matches.

KEVIN Francis struck twice to send first division Birmingham into the
quarter-finals of the Coca-Cola Cup south of the Border, ending Juninho's hopes
of a Wembley cup-final appearance.
Francis flattened Middlesbrough's Premiership high-fliers with a double in the
first 17 minutes at St Andrews to give the Brazilian, Juninho, his first bitter
taste of a giant-killing defeat.
The 6ft 7in former Stockport striker gave the Blues the lead after 11 minutes,
and before Bryan Robson's side could recover, Francis grabbed a second six
minutes later.
At Burnden Park, Gary Megson, No.2 at Bradford but fancied to take over as
manager of Norwich, watched City take on Bolton.
The match ended 0-0 after extra time, with Norwich winning the tie on penalties.
q WIMBLEDON striker Dean Holdsworth has been advised to see out the remaining
18 months of his contract with the London club. The advice comes from his
agent, Eric Hall, who believes it is in the player's best interests following
the judgement in the Jean-Marc Bosman case.
Players are now free to move at the end of their contracts with no fee involved
in cross-border transfers within the European Union. ``Dean might move abroad
and I know I could fix him up with a super, super deal,'' said Hall.
``I have already had inquiries about him from clubs in Spain and Italy. For
that reason it would be in his best interests, for the time being, to stay at
Wimbledon.''
Top players, like Holdsworth, could be set for rich pickings when their
contracts end. Money that would have been used to finance transfer fees will
now be used to line their pockets - and those of their agents.
q FLU victim Duncan Ferguson could be struggling to make Everton's team for
Saturday's Premiership trip to Coventry. The former Rangers striker has been
confined to bed since being sent home from training on Monday.
Ferguson, who has made two substitute appearances since his release from
prison, had to pull out of Tuesday night's reserve clash with Sheffield
Wednesday, missing out on vital match practice.
q FALKIRK midfielder Steve Kirk's move to East Fife is off. The Fifers agreed a
fee with Brockville manager John Lambie, but the 32-year-old player could not
agree personal terms with the second division leaders.
q MATTHEW Wicks is at the centre of a tug of war between three London clubs
after having decided that he wants to leave Manchester United. Alex Ferguson is
having talks with Tottenham about the young defender, the subject of an FA
inquiry into ``poaching'' allegations by Arsenal.
The Gunners would like him back and Chelsea also are said to be interested in
Wicks, who is unsettled at Old Trafford and wants to return to his London home.

Capital
not in
the fast
lane
THE only opportunity to see Britain's leading athletes in Scotland next year
will be at the Kelvin Hall on February 24, because Edinburgh cannot afford the
cost of hosting a             major track meeting.
The capital's inability to find at least #10,000 towards competitors' assembly
costs for a summer match means Glasgow's indoor McDonald's International will
be Scotland's only Olympic year track-and-field spectacular.
``We hoped Edinburgh would pick up a European permit event,'' said British
Athletics Federation spokesman Tony Ward.
``It's a disappointment that when there was scope for such a meeting in
Scotland, it will now go ahead at Crystal Palace. In future we hope it can be
restored - or, of course, Glasgow could build a suitable standard arena and we
could bring it here.''
Edinburgh, forced on financial grounds to spike a planned UK match against the
USA this year, will have competition should it try to pick up the baton again.
By this time next year a new       stadium with a 10-lane straight will be
completed at Scotstoun, where plans include an 8000-capacity stand.
``Our position is that we were willing to host the event, which to us means
offering a free            stadium, and providing a civic reception and
marketing support,'' said an Edinburgh Dis-trict Council's spokesman.
``Unfortunately, the council has had to make considerable cuts in the
recreation budget for civic amenities and is unable to offer direct financial
support of the kind BAF wanted.''
Sally Gunnell, the grand       slam Olympic, World, European, and Commonwealth
400 metres hurdles champion, confirmed yesterday that she will compete for
Britain against France in Glasgow, possibly facing Scotland's Europa Cup
one-lap champion, Mel Neef, over 200m.
The meeting will be the last before the European indoor championships in
Stockholm, and UK team places will still be at stake. Gunnell, who plans to
miss the Europeans, said: ``I may do the 200 or 400m in Glasgow, I am not 100%
sure which yet and won't decide until nearer the time.''
BAF confirmed they are to ask the French to send as strong a team as possible
in the face of complaints by Glasgow that recent visiting teams have been
second rate. It also is a disappointment that, as yet, there is no agreement
between the promoters and 'Nuff Respect, the agency whose principal assets,
Linford Christie and Colin Jackon, declined to run in BAF outdoor events this
year.
Spokesman Ward insists BAF is ``hopeful,'' but it is perhaps significant that
the pair have been omitted from publicity material which features sprinter
Darren Braithwaite and hurdler Tony Jarrett, both of whom will run in Glasgow.
The event will rely on such as Mark Hylton, the 18-year-old European junior
400m champion who surprised Scotland's Brian Whittle when beating him for the
AAA senior indoor title last winter. Such is the depth of British one-lap
quality that he could win a European indoor medal, yet struggle to make our
Olympic relay squad.
Ward is encouraged, meantime, that Christie, despite repeated vows that his
cham- pionship career is over, this week confirmed he will compete in the AAA
championships, from which the first two past       the post will be selected
for the Olympics.
Neef, who will have her first outing of the winter a week on Saturday in
Edinburgh's New Year Sprint meeting at Meadowbank, said: ``I plan to race 60
and 200m indoors most of the winter, then switch to 400m for the AAA and
European indoor.''
She added that she will have to make Britain's team on merit at the shorter
distances against France. ``I was running fast enough to do that last year, and
hopefully can do so again. With the Olympics, I don't want a long indoor season
of 400m running. But I recognise I have a responsibility.
``Not many Scots make the British team, but those who do, like Yvonne Murray
and Liz McColgan, Tom McKean and Brian Whittle, have a tradition   of winning
medals. It's time I       did that, and hopefully the             European
indoors will give me the chance to do so.''
Tickets for the Glasgow event (#9 and #5 for children and   senior citizens)
are on sale at      the arena, or call the ticket hotline: 0141 337 1806.

Johnston-style defection. Freed by Fort William, Skinner was paraded in Elgin
City colours and actually played for the club on Saturday against Peterhead.
But Clach last night appeared to have enticed the 29-year-old former Dundee
United and Caley Thistle defender to Inverness.
Clach commercial manager Peter Corbett said: ``Barring last-minute hitches,
Billy has agreed to sign for us.'' Skinner is likely to make his debut on
Saturday against his old club, Fort William.

game at Leeds on Christmas Eve. The Republic of Ireland midfield player has
suffered a further setback as he fights for fitness following his second hernia

Keane was due to play in United's reserve game against Derby at Bury last

HAWICK have given public, but qualified backing to the Scottish Rugby Union's
recommendations that districts and not clubs should represent Scotland in
Europe next season.
In a statement released yesterday Bob Chrystie, the vice-president of Hawick,
said: ``Scottish clubs are not strong enough to take on the Baths and Cardiffs
of this world. Going in as we are would do Scottish rugby's image no favours,
and while it might strengthen the bank balances of a few clubs, it would
certainly be at the expense of the game in Scotland.
``If clubs go into Europe then they will be faced with strengthening their
teams with outsiders - something that would not be good for the game in
Scotland - or by trawling other clubs.
``Scotland players whose clubs were not involved in Europe would seek new
stages for their talents and that in turn could take them to England, Wales,
or, further afield seeking remuneration.''
The Border club, which won a record 11 championship titles in a 14-year span,
rejects the idea being banded about of hybrid districts being formed next
season and instead thinks that the SRU should devolve power to existing
autonomous regions.
``Full-time professionals - in rugby development, administration, and marketing
- would work from within each district with overall responsibility for rugby at
all levels from mini through to representative games and this structure would
be funded by the SRU,'' said John Thorburn, the Hawick secretary.
Thorburn believes that players are unlikely to be released by clubs south of
the Border for district representation, but suggests that both parties will
have to come to a contractual accommodation.
``It would be a pretty stupid player - or agent - who did not have this built
into his contract with a new club,'' said Thorburn. ``Players will soon realise
that they are in demand and it is up to them to strike the best deal in a
spirit of give and take.''
Thorburn suggests that failure by players to represent their district should
automatically exclude them from national representation. ``With lucrative
contracts at international level, that might make some players consider that
their best future lies in Scotland,'' he said.
Despite their backing of the SRU, Hawick remain critical of the union's lack of
consultation with clubs. ``There are too many rumours flying around and anxiety
breeds fear,'' said Thorburn. ``The present district structure is not perfect,
but where there exists an obvious indentity, as with the South, then that
should be seen as the way ahead.
``Hybrid teams will prove nothing and it is questionable if they would be
allowed into the competition anyway.''

ALBERT Craig yesterday turned his back on Partick Thistle and headed up the A80
to team-up again with John Lambie, now manager of Falkirk.
Craig, plus #10,000, was part of the deal which takes striker Nicky Henderson
to Firhill, and the new man at Brockville was hardly in the door when Falkirk
assistant manager Gerry Collins was tipping Craig to play a big part in helping
his new club ease their way off      the bottom rung of the premier division
ladder.
``We're well aware of Albert's capabilities as John worked with him at both
Hamilton and Partick Thistle,'' said Collins. ``The type of quality Albert has
is hard to come by and we're delighted to have brought him here.''
Falkirk have found goals hard to come by this term and Collins reckons Craig
can help solve that problem. ``Albert gets himself into the box well for a
midfield player,'' said Collins. ``By his standards, last season was a bad year
for him yet he still managed seven goals. He may be 32, but he's a fit lad who
takes care of himself.''
And Henderson may not be        the only new face in the Thistle team in the
near future. Steve McMahon, a 25-year-old striker who has spent two years in
China, is now on trial at Firhill. ``I've been training with Thistle for three
weeks,'' said McMahon. ``Last season I scored nine goals in 22 league games and
the lad I played alongside was top scorer.''
However, Thistle manager Murdo MacLeod issued a note of caution. ``He's done
well in training, but I need to see him play a few games to get a better idea
of his ability.''
q.MARTIN O'Neill is expected to    be confirmed as Leicester's new manager
within the next 24 hours. The club have been given permission to talk with the
Irishman following his recent resignation from Norwich after only six months in
charge.
Leicester chairman Martin George is negotiating a compensation deal with the
Carrow Road side, thought to be around #500,000.

CELTIC'S good recent form has attracted the attention of punters, and as a
result leading bookmakers have the Parkhead side at the shortest Christmas odds
to win the premier division title for years, with one large layer contemplating
a #300,000 loss.
At the start of the season, Rangers were expected to make it eight title
successes in a row. However, Tuesday's goalless draw at Motherwell has left the
champions only two points clear of Celtic at the halfway stage.
While the Ibrox club remain championship favourites, the Old Firm have still to
meet twice, with the first showdown at Parkhead on January 3.
Corals had Rangers at 1-6 in August, with Celtic 6-1. Before the game against
Motherwell the league leaders were 2-7, with Celtic 5-2, but yesterday the odds
were 4-11 Rangers and 2-1 against Tommy Burns' team. ``We've trimmed the odds
again on Celtic after the Rangers result,'' said a spokesman for Corals.
``These are the shortest odds I can remember on Celtic winning the league at
this time of year since Graeme Souness became Rangers' manager in 1986.''
Ladbrokes appear confident that Rangers will see off their city rivals. They
offered the same pre-season odds as their rivals but now have cut them to 1-5
Rangers, with Celtic at 11-4.
``Celtic have received more backing for this season than for many years,'' said
a Ladbrokes spokesman. ``A lot of cash went on them in August, but the
bookmakers still expect Rangers to win the league. If Celtic do it, we will
have to pay out around #300,000, so from that point of view we're cheering
Rangers.''
q.FORMER Aberdeen player Willem van der Ark has been ordered to give up
football or run the risk of being crippled. A recurring groin injury has forced
the 32-year-old striker, now with Camburr, to retire.
Van der Ark, the only foreigner to score a hat trick in the Scottish Cup,
revealed: ``It has been a long-standing problem which surgery has failed to
clear up. When the medical people ask you to choose between a career or a
wheelchair there is no decision.''
q.SCOTT Booth, missing since a thigh injury forced him out the Coca-Cola Cup
final last month, is now back in full training.
``I am aiming to use him in a reserve game against Falkirk on Saturday,'' said
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken. ``This means that I will have available all my
first-team squad apart from Colin Woodthorpe.''
Pittodrie chief scout Jimmy Carswell is making progress in a Glasgow hospital,
where he has been detained after having suffered a stroke earlier this month.

RAITH Rovers play against Celtic on Tuesday knowing that success will move them
into the history books. Three points for the men from Stark's Park would put
Raith into third top place in the premier division, their highest position in
113 years.
It is a far cry from 21 months ago when the club were close to bankruptcy, but
were saved when chairman Alex Penman stepped in. He took over the reigns at
Kirkcaldy and now Penman, with a little help from Jimmy Nicholl and his
players, has turned the club around.
``We have made great strides as a club and most of that is down to the players
and the manager,'' said Penman. ``But we are not content to settle for what we
have. Permission has been granted for us to build three new stands at our
ground. This will bring the capacity of the stadium up to 10,400.
``We will continue to try and build this club because there is massive
potential.''
q.HIBERNIAN have gone back       to school and become the envy        of Craig
Brown, the Scotland manager. Brown, a former teacher, was at Easter Road
yesterday to lend his support to a new scheme linking Hibs with 10 local
primary schools.
Hibs have started an education pack for schools which involves pupils doing
projects on the club. ``We have been planning a similar schools pack with the
SFA but Hibs have beaten us to it,'' said Brown.
``I commend this scheme and we'll be pinching some of the ideas for the SFA
pack.
``In my experience if there is more interest, there will be better learning.
Ask school children to spell ``Wednesday'' and ``Thistle'' and they will find
some difficulty. But they have no problem if you stick ``Sheffield'' and
``Partick'' in front of the words.''
Aberdeen have a similar schools scheme running and other clubs in Scotland are
likely to follow suit.

THE Scottish Players' Union yesterday suggested that an independent review is
needed to decide on the best league structure for football, and union secretary
Tony Higgins claimed: ``That would stop the hardy annual each year of people
putting forward ideas for change.''
The Scottish League management committee meets today in Glasgow with first
division clubs pressing for a 16-club premier division next season. But the
indications last night were this would not gain the necessary support.
Even if the clubs are successful in calling an extraordinary general meeting,
they will require 75 per cent backing for a new set-up next season, or
two-thirds backing for a change the following year.
There is also a fear that the major sponsors in football would be unhappy at a
major change in the structure, after being assured the present four leagues of
10 clubs would run for a minimum of five years.
Higgins is a member of the Ernie Walker ``think tank'' at present investigating
Scottish football, but stressed that the make-up of the leagues does not come
into their remit.
Said Higgins: ``A straw poll of players would probably find they agreed with
the managers that they would like a bigger premier division. But the issue is
much wider than that.
``I feel independent research is required and that might mean an investigation
lasting up to a couple of years.
``An independent commission would look into the issue of full-time football,
quality of stadia, commercial activities, television, and much more.
``We understand the difficulties for our members are right across the range of
the clubs, taking in full-time and part-time players, and we know that it is
particularly difficult for any one club to speak conclusively for the whole of
Scottish football.
``But an independent body could put forward a plan. The clubs could accept or
reject it. But, either way, we would know where we stood and annual discussion
about change could be brought to an end.''

THE Scottish League's management committee will assemble this morning, and at
some point of their meeting, they will discuss a proposal to dismantle the four
divisions of 10 clubs each. The move for change is being driven by the first
division members, who feel the interests of the game are being undermined by
the current set-up, which was supposed to run for at least five years.
Even though they will be opposed by the might of the Old Firm, and at least
four of the other premier division concerns, they are determined to press
ahead, believing that when details of their proposal have been examined by the
second and third division clubs, they will win greater backing.
Rangers, Celtic (whose chairman Fergus McCann made his views known in
yesterday's Herald Arena column), and the others who are against, believe the
current format to be better than the proposal to change to a        16-club
premier division and two divisions, each of 12 clubs.
They also feel the quality of the football would suffer, because an increased
top division would inevitably mean a number of meaningless matches between
sides who neither were challenging for promotion, nor trying to beat relegation.
There are arguments on both sides which make some sense, but perhaps it should
be remembered that the bottom line is a top division of 10 clubs playing one
another four times each season is not healthy. There are too many matches, and
meeting the same players regularly breeds a familiarity which does not do the
game any good.
Players are too aware of the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents and
matches can be stale. Also, there is something to be said about the demands
placed on players and managers - let us not talk about pressure, because that
is something experienced by people trying to support families while out of
work - and they have to be protected. There is little point in abusing and
neglecting assets, even if those assets are modest in terms of real worth.
The Scottish League should change, and the top division should have at least 12
clubs who should not be required to play one another more than twice, home and
away, in the league. Some clubs will be       appalled at the thought of only
11 home matches in the league, but it is time the game's finances were
restructured in tandem with ways   designed to improve the       quality of
play.
McCann, and Murray - a prime mover behind the push for a Super League - are
correct in their belief that clubs who wish to play at the top should have
proper facilities and sound finances, and it is also difficult to disagree with
them over the number of clubs who have professional status. It really was a
nonsense to increase the size of the Scottish League from 38 clubs to 40 when,
if harsh realities were being faced, the membership would be reduced.
There are too many seeking a share of too little, and sooner or later the
league will be streamlined. In fact, the decision might be made for the
Scottish clubs because UEFA are still running scared of Europe's big clubs, who
are always seeking ways to win more sponsorship money.
One of the main reasons for the successful Champions' League format was to head
clubs with rebellion in their minds off at the pass, and when clubs like Milan,
Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern and Dortmund feel they want
more, they will threaten the establishment again. Murray, for one, remains
convinced a European super league will be in play        by the year 2000, or
soon after, and Scottish clubs will be recruited.
He is not saying they will be in the top division, but places in, say, a
northern league, could be awarded to the Old Firm and perhaps one or two other
Scottish clubs, who might meet the entry requirements.
UEFA cannot afford to allow their big clubs to get away, and they may be forced
to introduce their own super league to keep everyone satisfied. When they make
a decision, Scottish football will have to fall in       line. Perhaps the
members of the management committee should be aware of the wider picture when
they come to consider their own little problems today.
Above all, the main consideration should be the wellbeing of the game and its
development. Instead of talking about what sponsors or        individual clubs
might feel would suit them, everyone at the meeting should do what is best for
the game, and to my mind, that means a slightly larger top division with
ambitious clubs committed to improving standards of play.

BAYERN Munich's Jurgen Klinsmann and AC Milan team-mates Paolo Maldini and
George Weah are the candidates for FIFA's player of the year, soccer's world
body announced yesterday.
Some 100 national team coaches from around the world were polled for the
survey. The winner will be announced on January 8 in Milan during a gala
evening attended by FIFA president Joao Havelange.
Klinsmann has been scoring regularly for club and country since he returned to
Germany after a successful spell in England with Tottenham Hotspur.
Defender Maldini and striker Weah have been outstanding in Milan's revival in
Italy's Serie A this season. Liberian-born Weah is reported to have won the
prestigious Golden Boot award in a poll conducted by France Football magazine,
although an official announcement won't be made until December 26.

Washington Wednesday
TALKS on the budget crisis broke down today in a bitter dispute between
President Clinton and Republicans in Congress.
The outline agreement reached yesterday between the president and party leaders
was rejected by extremists in the House of Representatives, and a large part of
the federal government therefore remains closed for the sixth day.
Mr Clinton appeared in the White House press room to denounce his opponents:
``Yesterday, Speaker Gingrich, Senator Dole, and I reached an agreement to work
together in good faith to balance the budget and reopen the government,'' he
said.
``Today, the most extreme members of the House of Representatives rejected that
agreement.
``These Republicans want to force the government to stay closed until I accept
their deep and harmful cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, in education, in the
environment.''
He insisted: ``I won't yield to these threats. I'm determined to balance the
budget but I won't be forced to into signing a budget that violates our values,
not today, or tomorrow, nor ever.''
He claimed that ``a small minority of the House is determined to keep the
government closed until they get their way''.
He made a persuasive case of it, and the Republicans are in serious danger of
losing the whole debate on the budget.
Their leaders look suddenly weakened as they have lost control of their troops.
Senator Dole and Mr Gingrich were defied by their deputies earlier today, who
both said that they would not agree to providing the money to reopen the
government until the president accepted their budget terms.
When the president met Senator Dole and Mr Gingrich yesterday, the three agreed
on the outlines of negotiations that were to resume today. That meeting was
cancelled at the last moment, after members of Congress, chiefly newly-elected
ones, balked at the appearance of concessions by their own leaders.
The current game of chicken began in October, when Congress failed to pass both
the overall budget for the next seven years, and the Appropriations Bills that
would finance the 13 departments of government in the current financial year.
It passed a temporary measure, a ``continuing resolution'' to keep the
government funded, which expired in mid-November.
The government then closed for a week. Congress passed a new resolution,
providing funds for another month, and negotiations with the president were
meant to conclude a budget agreement in that time. Congress finally passed its
seven-year plan, and the president vetoed it. Congress also passed seven
Appropriations Bills, which the president signed, and three that he has vetoed.
So far, there has been no agreement, and the president has dug in his heels on
a few key issues while the Republicans continue to push for their version of a
balanced budget by 2002.
The current shut-down effects less than half the government. That means 280,000
civil servants are out of work.
They include most of the State Department, stranding Americans overseas who
need new passports or consular help. The Interior Department is also closed, so
national monuments like the Statue of Liberty, the parks like Yellowstone, and
the museums like the Smithsonian and the National Gallery are all closed.
If Mr Clinton succeeds in making his charges stick, he will deal a lethal blow
to his Republican rivals, making them look weaklings dominated by the
extremists in Congress. Those same extremists delight in the role, oblivious of
the harm they may do to the party.

CALA, the Edinburgh-based builder, warned yesterday that poor house sales in
the South-east of England and lower profit margins throughout the UK would
prevent any profits growth this year.
CALA shares plummeted 24p to 87p after the firm said pre-tax profits before
exceptional items would be similar to the #4.1m achieved in 1994-95.
CALA said trading had been weak since its annual results announcement in
September.
``In particular we have experienced low levels of visitors and sales
reservations in the south-east of England since mid-October and, as a result,
we expect unit sales for our operation in that area to fall short of budget for
the year to June 30, 1996,'' the company said.
South-east England generates about 40% of CALA sales, but operations there have
been running at a small loss for the last two years.
``We have been selling about half of what we would like to in the south,'' said
executive chairman Geoff Ball. ``November and December have been very poor.''
Business in the Midlands and Scotland remains satisfactory, but the cost of
offering part-exchange facilities to house buyers is eroding profit margins
everywhere.
Mr Ball said the part-exchange scheme was knocking about 1.5 percentage points
off CALA's usual 14% gross margin.
It is too early to say whether the bottom line will be boosted by any
exceptional items, after benefitting from a #2.8m exceptional profit on land
sales last year.
Despite the gloomy profits outlook, CALA expects to maintain the full-year
dividend at 3.2p.

A CLEAR majority of the
people of Lewis and Harris still oppose the introduction of a Sunday ferry
service, but the idea finds favour with the younger islanders and some
churchgoers, according to a System Three Poll.
Caledonian MacBrayne's managing director, Mr Colin Paterson, said it confirmed
his view there would be a Sunday sailing some time, although not in the
immediate future.
The poll was conducted for BBC's Eorpa programme and its results will be
debated tonight.
The survey of 400 islanders showed 60% opposed the idea, 34% supported it, and
6% did not know. Among the under 44s there was a clear majority in favour. In
the 16-19 group, 48% were in favour, 39% against. In the 30-44 group, 52%
supported it with 45% opposed.
The different views do not divide neatly along lines of church attendance, with
29% of those who support the Sunday service attending church, while 31% of
those who oppose it are not churchgoers.
When asked why they opposed the service 40% said to ``keep Sunday special'';
37% because it would destroy the culture or way of life; 8% because it would
force people to work on the Sabbath; and 3% because other businesses would
open. There was also a range of reasons accounting for support: 43% giving need
to travel to work/family visits; 23% convenience; 10% as an emergency; and 8%
to help business/ tourism.
In 1989 CalMac introduced the first Sunday sailing to North Uist but the
Government intervened and the company abandoned plans to introduce one to
Harris in 1991 when it looked likely that local fishermen, with church backing,
would blockade Tarbert.
Mr Paterson said: ``There is clear demand for the service amongst those who are
most likely to travel, the younger islanders and eventually we will have take
note of that demand.''

Paris, Wednesday
A FRENCH convict once on death row has won a doctorate cum laude in history
from Tours University with a brilliant study on family life in the 15th century.
Philippe Maurice, 39, whose death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by
President Francois Mitterrand in 1981, went to the university in handcuffs on
Monday to receive the award.
The head of the university jury, Professor Bernard Chevalier, said that
Maurice's thesis - Family life in 15th-century Gevaudan, the archives of Lozere
solicitors 1380-1430 - was an exceptional work by any standard.
Maurice had been sentenced to death for killing a security guard and a
policeman. He later seriously wounded a prison warder.
After his sentence was commuted a few months before Mitterrand finally
abolished the guillotine in 1981, Maurice tried to strangle another prison
guard, bringing widespread criticism of the presidential pardon.
Chevalier, his professor of mediaeval history, said Maurice turned to study in
prison although he had no academic training.
In 12 years he went through secondary school and university curricula, writing
his thesis in prison from 22,000 folios of microfilmed archives sent by
regional authorities in central Lozere, his home region.
``Studying was the instrument of his own reconstruction,'' Chevalier said.
``This condemns the death penalty. No man is beyond redemption by
society.''-Reuter.

DOCTORS at the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, battled in vain for more than three
hours to save the lives of a woman and her unborn child yesterday after she was
seriously injured in a head-on crash between two cars.
The woman, who was nine months' pregnant, was a front-seat passenger in a car
being driven by her husband when the crash happened at an accident blackspot
near Summerston, Glasgow.
Strathclyde Police said the woman, Mrs Helen Howe, 32, of Bilsland Drive,
Ruchill, Glasgow, died from multiple injuries. The baby was stillborn.
The news was broken to her husband, Mr Charles Howe, 33, at the same hospital,
where he underwent an operation for serious leg injuries. He was later said to
be in a comfortable condition.
The couple's nine-year-old son James, who was a passenger in the rear seat of
the car, was also injured and taken to the same hospital before being
transferred to Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow. He sustained a broken forearm.
The accident happened on a narrow stretch of Blackhill Road near to Blackhill
Farm Cottages, a row of three houses surrounded by fields on the edge of
Summerston.
One of the residents, Mrs Janet Monteith, 51, was among the first on the scene
and spoke yesterday of how she comforted Mr Howe while ambulance staff worked
on his wife.
``He was talking and asking what had happened and then told me that his wife
was pregnant and overdue.''
Fighting back the tears, Mrs Monteith added: ``I didn't realise just how
serious it was. His wife was just sitting as if in a trance. I didn't think she
was going to die. It's very, very sad.''
Police investigating the accident were yesterday searching for the driver of
the other car involved and said they were following a definite line of inquiry.
Mrs Howe was travelling in a Ford Fiesta being driven by her husband when it
was in collision with a Vauxhall Corsa car travelling in the opposite direction
at about 9.50pm on Tuesday.
It is believed that the couple had two other children, a girl of about 13 and a
boy of about 12.
A spokesman at the Royal Infirmary said yesterday: ``A medical team tried for
more than three hours to save Mrs Howe but, despite their best efforts, the
injuries she suffered were simply too grave.
``This is an absolutely tragic situation which has affected many people in the
hospital who are very shocked by it and our hearts go out to the family.''
The three male occupants of the other car were not being named by police for
operational reasons but two teenagers were traced and allowed home after
receiving hospital treatment.
Police declined to talk in detail about the incident yesterday and Chief
Inspector Alistair Anderson, the officer leading the inquiry, would say only
that it was a ``horrendous'' accident whose dreadful consequences were made
worse by the approach of Christmas.
Neighbours of the Howes, who live in a second-floor tenement flat overlooking
Ruchill Park, described them as a quiet family who kept themselves to
themselves.

DOUGLAS THOMPSON talks to Jim Carrey,
the man whose sense of humour took him from cleaning toilets to top dollars
HE IS all about figures including his own which he can turn into a wind tunnel
of contortions and thrust into outrageous situations. The other figures which
run into tens of millions of dollars have made Jim Carrey the toast - and livid
green envy - of all Hollywood - and the town's highest paid screen comic ever.
Ol' Rubber Face who used to clean toilets in Toronto's public lavatories goes
into 1996 as the star of the moment. His physical humour - a throwback to the
silent movies' slapstick set - is turning on giant audiences from teenagers to
veteran funnymen like Jerry Lewis to whom he is often compared - but this is a
new, wild and crazy guy. Well, wild maybe, but not so crazy. He has managers
and advisers but mostly he needs accountants and bankers.
``I went through periods when I had nothing, so somebody in my family had to
get stinkin' wealthy,'' says Carrey who is enjoying his fame - and fortune: ``I
refuse to feel guilty. I feel guilty about too much in my life but not about
money . . .''
You'll want to know the figures. His latest movie Ace Ventura: When Nature
Calls - it opens in Britain on Boxing Day - earned $37.8m in its first weekend
in America last month. Already it has easily overtaken the magic $100m mark.
It is Carrey's fifth box office blockbuster in a row. It began with the
original Ace Ventura: Pet Detective in the spring of last year - he was paid
$350,000 to play the title role - and then soared into orbit with The Mask,
Dumb and Dumber and this year's Batman Forever in which he played The Riddler
to Val Kilmer's Caped Crusader.
With each film his money increased by $1m to $2m increments. That was until
Cable Guy came along. He is being paid $20m to play a television cable
technician who ``terrorises'' Matthew Broderick. Next he's starring in Liar,
Liar as a pathologically dishonest single father who promises to tell the truth
to his son for 24 hours. It's another comedy - and another $20m. Is he worth it?
The man who has made his money out of laughs is serious: as much as anybody
else who brings that many people in. Movies nowadays make so much money with
all the tie-ins that a hit makes $300m overseas.
``The things in the Hollywood trade papers saying it's ruining the business is
basically the studios not wanting to pay the money.''
He says the cash bonanza is certainly not ruining his attitude: ``When the
first big pay-cheque with Dumb and Dumber hit I went, `Gosh I wonder if this
will affect my peformance. Will I do a take and think, was that worth $7m?' But
that never happened.
``If anything, it made me rebel against that thing when people who get rich
start playing safe. With Dumb and Dumber I put a bowl cut on my hair, took a
tooth off, went against the leading man star thing. It was a good test for me.
``The money - if I sit and think about it - is great. But if it's not good work
it's not going to be worth anything. I'm glued to my work - probably in an
unhealthy way.''
Of course, like all clowns, he wants to be taken seriously. Which brings us to
more figures. He is being paid $12m - his agent calls the fee ``low'' - to star
in The Truman Show. Its antecedents are promising. The director is Peter Weir
(Dead Poets Society, Witness) and the producer is the veteran Scott Rudin.
Carrey will appear as a New York insurance adjuster whose life veers off the
tracks. He says it's ``something more grounded in reality for me''.
But audiences go to see him for laughs, for movies like Ace Ventura: When
Nature Calls which is a lowbrow comedy which raises its sights when it goes for
the jokes about bodily functions. But no matter what the critics make of his
cerebrally challenged films, his audience just gets bigger and bigger. This
time he's back with his Hawaiian shirts and jet stream pompadour and trying to
make the world safe for animals in a cartoon Africa. It's tens of millions of
dollars of total tosh.
Will his fans love a ``reality'' Carrey? Can he move on to drama? ``I always
want to put a little humour in it. I'm not a James Dean guy but I see myself
more as a James Stewart character. There is a certain plan that has to happen.
``Can't bang them over the head with Shakespeare all of a sudden. People don't
like change. A lot of my stuff is dumb but there's smart stuff in there too.
I've been dubbed responsible for the dumbing of America.
``It's not up to me to educate America. I'm trying to give them relief. Ace
makes fun of the leading man and that's what I wanted to do.''
He's also always wanted to be a star. At 33, he's made it.
He began trying 16 years ago wearing yellow polyester and appearing at Yuk
Yuk's comedy club in Toronto, where he was born the youngest son of an
accountant.
When his father Percy, who died last year, lost his job, the family ended up
living in tents and working as a cleaning crew. His youngest son saw
showbusiness as his way out. He moved on from one set of stalls to another -
but his first stand-up comedy shows went down the toilet. Now he's worth
millions.
``That's always been my pattern. I try something, totally suck, go away, come
back and I totally kill.''
In between there were the comedy clubs, a couple of television and movie tries
and marriage in 1987. He was divorced from his wife Melissa this year (he now
lives with actress Lauren Holly who worked with him on Dumb and Dumber). His
former wife revealed another side of the usually publicly smiling tall
``funniest man in America''. She was going through their divorce when she said:
``Jim is an extremely depressive person. I would sit up counselling him through
it until four or five in the morning on many, many nights.''
Her former husband's reaction without explanation is simply: ``She's lucky to
be out of my life.''
Actress Courtney Cox who co-starred with him in the original Ace says: ``There
are two Jims but not a terribly dark one. He has a very serious side. He did
have a hard time and he is very sensitive and there's definitely a deep side.
But it's that way with all comedians. Jim couldn't be that funny without the
pain on the other side.''
During one of the difficult ``painful'' periods in 1987 Jim Carrey took a drive
up Mulholland Avenue which has spectacular Tinseltown views of Hollywood.
In one of those silly dream moments he wrote a cheque to himself. It was
post-dated November 23, 1995. It was for $10m. For once he got his figure
wrong. By then he was the $20m man.

THE UK'S visible trade with non-European Union countries enjoyed a significant
improvement in November, with the deficit narrowing to #496m, down from
October's #1183m and less than market projections of around #950m.
Exports rose 9% over the month to a record #5777m while imports dipped 3% to
#6273m, taken as an indication that manufacturers are no longer rebuilding
stocks but will meet demand from their shelves. This helped the pound to
strengthen a little against the mark. It was also in line with a relatively
firm dollar.
About half the rise in exports was due to erratic items, mainly the export of a
warship to Saudi Arabia. But after excluding oil and erratics - the gap still
fell from #962m to #525m.
On the same basis, exports rose 6.6% in the three months to November and
imports by 5.9%.
The Treasury said: ``Strong growth in export volumes is contributing to
narrowing in non-EU-visible trade deficit.''
However, the Central Statistical Office makes the point that the pattern of the
deficit over the last three months has been erratic, making estimation of the
trend particularly difficult. Bearing this in mind, the addition of the
November figures has led to a flattening in the estimate of the latest trend,
with exports rising faster than imports.
James Capel's Adam Cole considers that the most encouraging aspect of the
November trade data was the sharp fall in imports - the first significant
evidence that manufacturers have stopped rebuilding stocks. The trend in
exports remains surprisingly good, but it is thought unlikely to be mirrored in
trade with the EU countries when data becomes available.

THE name Balbir (as every devotee of Indian food will know) is practically
synonymous with curry in this city, and with Indian cuisine of the highest
standard. Balbir's first restaurant was the legendary Ashoka in Argyle Street
which he opened in 1973. Almost a decade later he bought a restaurant in
Elderslie Street, changed its name to Ashoka Tandoori, and for the first time
introduced a lot of Punjabi and other regional dishes from the Indian
sub-continent, to Glasgow.
The Ashoka Vegetarian across the road was a logical step forward, and Balbir's
huge success resulted in a lot of other Indian restaurants up-grading their
cuisines. Glasgow is now without doubt the ``curry capital of Europe'' boasting
more ``quality'' Indian restaurants than any city outside India.
It was a sad day for fans when Balbir decided to sell up in order to spend more
time with his family, because although the name remained, the standard was not
quite as he'd have liked it. However, after a short break, he was back in
action with a new restaurant, Ali Baba's Balti Bar in town, and just three
weeks ago, in the heart of Partick, he opened Balbir's Balti &amp; Dosa House in
Hyndland Street, for the convenience and gastronomic delight of a West End
clientele which likes to have good food on the doorstep.
You will find that dining in the Balti &amp; Dosa House is superb value, as well
as being a tremendously satisfying gastronomic experience.
For the uninitiated, ``balti'' means, literally, ``bucket'' and is in fact the
Birmingham version of the ``karahi'' or Chinese wok.
As for dosas, Glaswegians probably first tasted these in the Vegetarian Ashoka
(1987-92). The dosa is a South Indian crepe made with ground rice and daal.
Scrumptious! But the range is now extended for non-vegetarians too, and
includes an exciting variety of meat and fish. As you might imagine though, the
vegetarian menu at the Balti &amp; Dosa House is more extensive than in other
restaurants, considering Balbir's credentials in that department.
The restaurant is at the bottom of Hyndland Street (No. 11/13) close to
Dumbarton Road, and is particularly handy for Hyndland and Partick residents.
But it's well worth making a special trip from further afield not only to
sample Balbir's excellent cuisine, but because the parking is so easy. Balbir's
also have a home delivery service (5pm-11pm, no charge for delivery).

Film attacked
LOS ANGELES: The family of former US President Richard Nixon has denounced
controversial director Oliver Stone's new film, Nixon, as ``erroneous and
malicious''. Nixon's daughters Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower
accused Stone of character assassination of their late father.
Bodies found
ASUNCION: Up to 100 corpses, which Paraguayan police say may be those of
drug-traffickers or smugglers, have been found in a clandestine grave across
the border in Brazil. News reports say there were signs of torture.
Man impaled
KIEV: A timber yard worker survived a bizarre accident that left him impaled on
a 5ft wooden pole. Fellow workers had to saw off both ends and carry him to
hospital, where doctors took three hours to remove the pole.

IAN FOOTE, who died suddenly in Argyll last week, was, without doubt, one of
the finest football referees Scotland has ever produced, on a par with other
giants such as Jack Mowat, Hugh Phillips and Tom ``Tiny'' Wharton.
He will also be remembered as a fair goalkeeper during a playing career with
the amateur side Muirend and junior clubs Petershill and Bo'ness United, but it
was during the seventies and eighties when he made his big contribution to the
game, as a referee.
He was given the honour of handling three Scottish Cup finals, the first in
1975 when Celtic beat Airdrie 3-1 at Hampden Park, the last match in which
Parkhead captain Billy McNeill ever played.
Four years later when Rangers met Hibernian in the final, the clubs fought out
two goal-less draws with Brian McGinlay in charge.
And when McGinlay could not officiate at the second replay, the SFA turned to
Ian Foote. Rangers won that one 3-2 after extra time making it the longest
Scottish Cup final of this century.
His third and last Scottish Cup final came in 1981 with Rangers again involved.
This time they beat Dundee United 4-1 after a 0-0 draw.
Ian Foote was also on FIFA's list of top referees and in 1979 he handled the
first leg of the UEFA Cup final when Red Star Belgrade drew 1-1 with Borussia
Moenchengladbach in Yugoslavia.
Tom Wharton, now an SFA referee supervisor, paid tribute to Ian when he said:
``There is no doubt that Ian Foote was one of the most outstanding referees of
his time. He was very strict on the field, but a quiet, kindly man who never
had a bad word to say about anyone.
``He was a very good-living man and was still involved in his family business.
It's tragic that he was not given the chance to enjoy retirement.''

FORTE has sold its Travelodge chain in the US for #108m - a little more than
had been expected - and the deal brings total receipts in its disposals
programme to #1100m, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
The latest sale does not represent a scorched earth policy, as the business was
put up for sale in September, well before the Granada bid.
The transaction followed a competitive auction process which was won by a
consortium led by HSF Incorporated, one of the US's largest budget hotel
franchising companies, with brands such as Ramada and Howard Johnson.
It will have exclusive right to the Travelodge name in North America and
Mexico. Forte is retaining the right in the UK, Continental Europe and most
other areas.
Travelodge has not been Forte's best performer but finance director Keith
Hamill attributed the satisfactory price obtained to the hard work put into
improving the performance of the business.
The money will go towards reducing debt and funding capital investment and
acquisitions to develop the core interests.
The disposal progamme has included a variety of transactions this year, ranging
from the sale of the remaining stake in Gardner Merchant and the Harvester pub
chain to odd hotels in Spain and Ireland, and Lillywhites, the sports equipment
retailer.
Forte is also trying to sell 60 of the 72-strong chain of White Hart hotels in
the UK and there are two possible buyers, but the sale has hit snags and may
not be completed.
Granada has attacked Forte for continuing with disposals while the subject of a
bid because potential buyers will press for a lower price as a result.
In another development yesterday, the High Court confirmed that the Council of
Forte was entitled to retain or sell its shares as it might think fit. Run by
eight trustees, the council has just 0.08% of the shares but effectively
controls half the votes.

A FAMILY caught up in a violent disturbance on a transatlantic flight yesterday
arrived back in London, and criticised the airline for handing out free drinks.
Northwest Airlines had said drunken British and Irish tourists wreaked havoc on
the flight from Gatwick to Los Angeles on Monday until the worst offenders were
tamed by American Olympic wrestlers and handcuffed to their seats.
Seventeen people from three families - ranging from men in their 60s to
children as young as two - were taken off the plane at Minneapolis and
arrangements made to return them home, said airline spokesman Doug Killian.
An 18th person, Michael Purcell, 25, was remanded in custody in the US on
charges of assaulting and intimidating a crew member and flight attendant.
The airline claimed the families began throwing food, shouting and swearing
when flight attendants refused to serve them more alcohol.
However, one of the families returned to Gatwick yesterday and insisted they
had been treated unfairly.
Grandmother Eileen Cash, from Kilburn, north London, said: ``We were going on
holiday, and feel ashamed and embarrassed over it but we never did anything.
``They gave us drink on the plane, they shouldn't have.''

NIGERIAN asylum seeker Peter Nwokoye was freed from Saughton Prison yesterday
to celebrate his first Christmas with his wife Tracy at their Edinburgh home.
Mr Nwokoye, 35, who has spent the past six months in jail awaiting judicial
review of the Home Office refusal to allow political asylum, said: ``I just
thank God I am free. I have never been in jail before and, although some people
were kind, it was a really horrible experience.''
Lord Milligan ordered his interim liberation at the Court of Session until the
judicial review hearing, on condition that #1000 was lodged as security and he
reported to police three times a week.
Mr Nwokoye fears political persecution if he is sent back to Ogoniland, a
homeland he shared with Nobel Peace Prize nominee Ken Saro-Wiwa, whose
execution by the Nigerian authorities shocked the world. According to
television reports, Mr Nwokoye's home village has been razed to the ground.
Mr Nwokoye, who arrived in the UK in 1991, studied at Stevenson College and met
Tracy, 26, a bank clerk, at a disco.
He had wished to train to become a minister, but was unable to obtain the
necessary extension to stay here. The couple were married in September at an
Edinburgh registry office.
``She came in every day to see me in prison, and all the family have been very
supportive. I am so happy to be out and going home with my wife for Christmas''
he said.
Mrs Nwokoye said: ``I am just delighted that he is out.''
The couple, whose home is in the Dalry area of Edinburgh, are now awaiting the
judicial review which could take a six months before coming to court.
A Home Office spokesman said he could not comment on specific cases, but powers
to detain under the Immigration Act were not exercised lightly and only used in
a small minority of cases.

IT HAD been a long week; the fishing vote had been lost and the men in the
white coats had still not come to collect the Eurosceptics; the Lottery
regulator was warned to keep away from airports, Mr David Ashby from double
beds, and rail privatisation was proving about as popular as the flu virus. The
Prime Minister took a deep slug of his cocoa and his eyelids became very heavy
. . .
A handbag bashed into his left ear. ``Pull yourself together man. I didn't get
where I am today - able to command #25,000 for a single, boring speech - by
sitting sleeping in the chair.'' It was the Ghost of Christmas Past.
``Oh no, when I was in power I hardly slept at all and neither did anyone else.
Sent doddering old Foot back to walking his dogs, punctured the Welsh windbag,
destroyed the Argies, smashed the unions, and that was all before lunch.
Rejoice, I cried, and people did.''
Cried or rejoiced, wondered the PM, silently. He attempted a defence. ``In your
day, Maggie, we had big majorities, the Whips could put the fear of God into
them, threaten to have them deselected. Now they are deselecting themselves in
huge numbers, scared to stand again.''
``Bah, humbug!'' came the riposte, ``it is not about the size of your majority,
it is about leadership, the firm smack of government, the pleasure of power. If
you don't pull your socks up and get stuck into Pretty Boy Blair you are going
to be an ex before your time.
``Think of the miners' strike, think of Wapping, think of Goose Green, remember
the poll tax - well, maybe not - and remember I picked you as my successor. And
I don't like losers.'' There was time for one more blow with the bag and she
was off.
The PM tried another snooze but a blast of cold air troubled him and he awoke
to face a tall man with a long nose and a permanently sneering expression.
``You are not trying to tell us you are doing well, are you? demanded the
visitor. It was the Ghost of Christmas Present.
This time the PM was not going to give in without a fight. ``Just you hang on a
minute, Jeremy (Paxman), I am the leader who is always being written off but
keeps going. Oh, yes.
``Who else could have achieved 16 months of peace in Northern Ireland? Who was
it who persuaded President Clinton to send troops to Bosnia? Who faced up to
his critics by resigning and then got elected again?''
The ghost's lip curled: ``Who else could lead a party 30 points behind in the
opinion polls? Who else could manage to make the public so hostile to the
Tories when there is good news to tell? When are you going to quit, give Tony
his rightful place, let John and Gordon and all the other talents on the
Opposition benches have a go at facing me?''
``Never!'' The PM was becoming quite animated now. ``Just wait until the
interest rate cut starts to filter through, until they have had my next round
of tax cuts, when their mortgage payments fall, then they will all come back.
``Mr Blair will not be able to hide the cost of his policies forever. I shall
expose them, tell the people that his devolution proposals will lead to the
break-up of the United Kingdom. I will give them a triple whammy . . .''
The ghost held up his hand. ``I'm sorry - that is all we have time for tonight.
I would like to thank me for coming and wish me and all my fans a Merry
Christmas.''
The PM was left wrestling with the sheets again.
Could things become any worse? Could there be another dry summer in Yorkshire?
Could Cedric Brown be given a #1m pay rise? Will we discover we have sold
British Rail to Colombian drug barons? He bit his lip.
The Ghost of Chrismas Yet To Come smiled. ``Did I tell you about the time I was
captain of the R and A and lost all my balls? Most people thought it had
happened years ago.'' His big frame heaved with mirth.
``Willie,'' gasped the PM, ``is it you, Willie?'' ``Yes, it's me, old boy, not
pushin' up the daisies quite yet. Still time for a few noggins and a bit of
advice like I used to give to Herself. But first I have to show you what could
happen to you if you do not change course.''
He grasped the PM by the hand and they soared away together over the rooftops
of London. They came to rest in a large chamber with red seats.
``This is what awaits you, PM, a seat in the old Lords' home. You can find a
place between Buffy and Bunter - both deaf as goalposts so it won't matter what
you say. Grub's not bad, drink cheap, but Gawd, it's really boring.''
``Must I be confined to this awful place, Willie?'' ``Perhaps not. Look here -
you are just a slip of a lad, really, not even 60, Winnie was still in the
wilderness at your age. Plenty of time for a comeback - know what I mean?'' ``I
should give up?'' ``Yep, for the moment. Resign. Say you want a break. Want to
retire as undefeated champion. Handin' it over to Heseltine.''
``But you always said you could not trust Heseltine.''
``Who needs to trust him? He will galvanise the troops, put the boot into
Blair, resign from the European Union if he thinks there are votes in it, bring
back hangin' and floggin' and that's just in schools. In the meantime, as old
Charlie de Gaulle used to say, you wait.''
``But I just don't understand, Willie, if I hand over to Hezza and he is
victorious how does that help me to make a come-back?'' The old ghost grinned.
``Did I say anything about winning, John? Ghosts are not into miracles.''

A 16-YEAR-OLD girl killed herself yesterday, only days after two previous
suicide bids failed.
Miss Jessica O'Riordan was persuaded not to jump from a river bridge on Monday.
Later that day she survived leaping in front of a train. She was allowed home
after seeing a doctor. Yesterday she died when she jumped from a fourth-floor
fire escape at a hotel.
Miss O'Riordan, who lived with her social worker mother and two older sisters
at Brockenhurst, Hampshire, had attended a concert hours earlier by the band,
Pulp, in Bournemouth, with a 19-year-old friend, Miss Sally Smith.
The teenagers had been spotted by a policewoman sitting on the edge of the
Itchen Bridge in Southampton on Monday evening.
Later that evening they went to Southampton rail station, where Miss O'Riordan
jumped in front of a train. She landed between the tracks and escaped unhurt.
Yesterday the two girls climbed up to the fourth floor at Marsham Court Hotel,
in Grove Road, Bournemouth.
Staff heard screams and ran outside to see Miss Smith, hysterical, at the top
of the fire escape and her friend's body on the ground.

Lord Jacques of Portsea Island, born January 11, 1905, died December 20, 1995
LORD Jacques of Portsea Island, who died yesterday, started his working life as
a teenage miner and then a grocery apprentice and rose to become a Government
whip and deputy speaker of the House of Lords. He was 90.
Virtually his entire working life was associated with the Cooperative movement
and he was elected President of the Co-operative Congress in 1961. He also
served as chairman of the Co-operative Union.
Lord Jacques, a Labour life peer, entered the House of Lords in 1968. He twice
served as a Government whip, first between 1974 and 1977.
Then, early in 1979, only a day before his 74th birthday, he was reappointed a
Government whip, an indication of the difficulty the then Prime Minister, now
Lord Callaghan, was having in filling junior posts in the House of Lords.
He served as deputy speaker in the Lords from 1978 to 1985. Lord Jacques was
last seen in the Lords as recently as last month for the State Opening of
Parliament.
His service to the Co-operative movement was probably unrivalled. He was, in
fact, known as Mr Co-op for many years.
After working as a miner, John Jacques became a grocery apprentice at the
Co-operative Society at Ashington, Northumberland, near his birthplace.
He spent 20 years as chief officer of the Portsea Island Society, raising
turnover from #2m to #22.6m and paying his 200,000 members in the Portsmouth
area a regular dividend of 1s 6d in the #1.
And he was the man behind the ambitious regional plan to group the 467 retail
societies into 50 regional trading units.
His colleague, Lord Graham of Edmonton, said yesterday: ``He was the Mr
Reliable and never ever let down either the Co-operative Movement or the Labour
Party. His record as the eminence of the Portsea Island Cooperative was
unrivalled.''
Lord Jacques, whose first wife Constance died in 1987, is survived by a widow,
Violet, two sons and a daughter.

HOPES of racing at Kelso this afternoon were frozen solid yesterday and the
Border track's stewards called off the fixture because of frost.
After having inspected the track, clerk of the course Johnny Fenwick-Clennell
said: ``It was frozen solid. We had no problems early this morning but things
have got worse through the day.
``The forecast is for sub-zero temperatures and with racing scheduled to start
at 12.20, we have no chance of going ahead.''
But punters should not fret because hopes are high that Lingfield and Uttoxeter
will survive to provide a final chance of action before a three-day yuletide
break in the fixture list.
Clerk of the course David McAllister was ``cautiously optimistic'' that today's
meeting at Uttoxeter will go ahead. ``We had half an inch of rain last night
and the forecast is a mixed bag,'' he said.
The cold snap is threatening next week's action. Ayr, due to race on Boxing
Day, and Edinburgh, where a meeting is planned the following day, were frozen
yesterday.
Manager Mark Kershaw said: ``We have had quite a lot of frost and we look set
for a severe frost tonight. No inspections are arranged yet but we will be
making plans as we get nearer the weekend.''
q TRAINER Jonjo O'Neill was fined #400 and jockey Alan Roche suspended for
seven days for schooling and conditioning Princess Maxine in public at Hexham
yesterday.
The mare looked tenderly-handled when staying on to finish fifth in the
novices' hurdle. Roche told officials that his instructions had been to ensure
that she got the trip.
O'Neill said he was satsified with Roche's riding, although he would have
preferred him to have had the horse in a more prominent position coming down
the hill in the back straight.
However, one trainer with a large smile on his face at the course was Steve
Kettlewell, whose late gamble on Easby Joker paid dividends.
The gelding wrapped up his third success from four outings this season with a
comfortable defeat of Lupy Minstrel in the Santa Claus Chase.
q MASTER Oats, the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, has been withdrawn from
Wednesday's Welsh National at Chepstow.
Kim Bailey's gelding, pulled up in the Rehearsal Chase on the same course on
his reappearance, now will go for the Ericsson Chase at Leopardstown the
following day.
Without Master Oats, Miinnehoma has been left to shoulder top-weight of 11st
7lb in the Welsh marathon. The 1994 Grand National winner has been the main
market mover and is now a 10-1 chance from 16-1 earlier in the week.

<HEADLINE>Council drops case against Lanark Blue</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>974782609</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CLYDESDALE District Council environmental health committee announced yesterday
that it would take no further court action against Lanark Blue cheese-maker
Humphrey Errington.
The council faces a legal bill of #350,000 spent in pursuit of the Dunsyre
cheese-maker, one year after ordering 44 batches of his soft cheese destroyed
because of alleged listeria contamination.
The council's statement reiterated the case it had put before Sheriff John
Allan at Lanark Sheriff Court, and regretted that the sheriff had not accepted
its evidence.
In his judgment, Sheriff Allan had said the cheese was not unfit to eat and
refused the council's request that #27,000 worth of it should be destroyed. He
was also critical of the environmental health office's ``combative and
confrontational manner''.
In a statement following the in camera meeting at the council's Lanark
headquarters, department director Duncan McDougall said: ``The committee
totally rejects the criticism of the district council staff and fully supports
the action taken by staff who followed nationally agreed guidelines throughout
the case.''
The council, he said, had consulted a great many experts before taking action
against Mr Errington: ``These experts presented the overwhelming opinion of the
medical and microbiological professions that such gross contamination of the
food rendered it unfit for human consumption.''
The sheriff's decision, he said, therefore appeared to be contrary to expert
microbiological and medical opinion.
``However, it is not the intention of the council to take any further legal
action in respect of the case, but the matter shall be pursued with the
appropriate bodies, including Cosla, the Scottish Office, and the medical and
microbiological authorities.''
Mr Errington had a mixed reaction to the statement.
``I'm very relieved they are not going to take any further action,'' he said.
``It would have cost us a lot more money to defend ourselves in the Court of
Session.
``Looking at the statement it's difficult to know what to say because some of
the statements are totally untrue. It's a partial account of events.
``Our lawyers are beginning to draft a complaint to the Local Authority
Ombudsman. It seems to be the only way to achieve an inquiry into this.
``If the council would do it themselves I wouldn't need to bother. Our case is
that there has been severe maladministration.''
Mr Errington said he was taking legal advice about suing Clydesdale for his
#120,000 court costs.
Mr Fergus Ewing, SNP business spokesman, said last night: ``What must happen
now is that Mr Errington should receive his legal costs and compensation.
Clydesdale District nearly bankrupted Mr Errington. They lost the case.
``They appear unable to accept defeat. Apparently to their way of thinking even
the sheriff was wrong. Isn't it unbelievable that the councillors condemn the
judgment of the sheriff when none of them bothered to turn up to hear a word of
evidence in the 19 days of the hearing?''

IT WAS the lie, not the lifestyle, that ruined David Ashby. After the grotesque
libel case which, it must be confessed, added enormously to the gaiety of the
nation, here is a man humiliated and weeping. This is not to gloat, well not
much.
It's hard not to feel something for a man broken on the wheel of hubris, even
one whose ego, matched for monstrosity only by his seriously weird wife, led
him to gamble all for his sexuality.
Maybe he thought the stakes were worth the enormous risk. Perhaps if he'd let
the Sunday Times story pass and quietly forgotten his legal action he could
have blustered on with his life. Instead, he staked all on opening up the
shaming family secrets to a raucous public.
Oh how we all chortled over the Christmas Eve row, when his wife was chanting
``poofters, poofters'' through the letterbox. Who can forget, we asked, wiping
our eyes, the couple wrestling each other to the ground, firing off bilious and
spittle-flecked salvoes of contempt while attempting a half-nelson 'neath the
festive mantelpiece?
What a merry image that was, of Silvana teetering round his study on her peery
heels peeling off the wallpaper with bare nails. Such a giggle when she claimed
to have learned her bad language from Channel 4. What a laugh, eh? Of course we
can mock. Why not? It was Mr Ashby, after all, who chose to expose the entire
cast in this steamy satire on a Greek tragedy to public hilarity. (Interesting
to note, don't you think, that the word tragedy derives from the Greek for
goat?).
What? You think I'm being unseasonally cruel? Well, look at it this way. Do you
think Mr Ashby expected to get away with preaching the importance of family
values, as he did in his election literature, to carry on spouting
double-standards, one morality for us MPs, and another for them feckless poor,
while leaving his wife in the circumstances we have read about?
Mr Ashby needs to grasp that, despite the best efforts of the homophobic
tabloids, people can and do put up with, forgive, even admire the courage of
people who take the honest but hard decision to come out as gay - Michael
Barrymore, Chris Smith MP, former Tory MP Matthew Parris. What they won't
tolerate is arrogant hypocrisy. It was the cant the jury rumbled in Mr Ashby's
case.
Although the case is over the hypocrisy won't go away. It seems now that senior
party figures are rallying round, trying to salvage Mr Ashby's perilous
financial state. Michael Heseltine and millionaire peer Lord Archer - just the
man don't you think to offer consolation? - are tipped as those to pass the top
hat round. It would be heartwarming to report that their concern is for a man
down on his luck at Christmas.
It wouldn't be true though. If there is a whip-round to raise half a million to
stave off Mr Ashby's bankrupcy, it won't be to salvage his brass neck, rather
it will be to save their own thick skins.
If Mr Ashby is bankrupted he can't continue as an MP. It would shave another
wafer off a transparently thin majority of two. Think about it. Only one MP -
and envision all those doddering, sickly looking old buffers with pacemakers
stumbling about on the backbenches - would then stand in the way of a general
election.
If one positive thing could be salvaged from this whole gruesome tale it would
be to still the sermonising of the high-Tory-muck-a-mucks. What joy no more to
hear the preachings of those smug, purse-lipped inhabitants of the moral high
ground who rejoice in pontificating about the superiority of the traditional
family unit, shaped in their own image, over any other.
By virtue of my education and career I may have achieved a middle class gloss.
But my early allegiances return with a vengeance when I hear some Tory gasbag
spouting heartless nonsense which equates poverty and single parents with moral
failure, compounded by the bone-headed brutality that denigrates any variant on
the nuclear family.
How much self esteem can the children of single parents have when they are
constantly called a social problem?
Dysfunctional? The Ashbys make the Buck House Windsors seem like positive role
models of emotional health and familial stability.
So I'll drop my scorn and offer seasonal goodwill to fallen Tories when they
stop blaming poverty on the poor and acknowledge their own moral obligation in
its spread. That might take a miracle. But it is Christmas.

<HEADLINE>Loyalist politician jailed for 10 years Gang convicted of conspiracy to run guns to UVF</HEADLINE>

LOYALIST politician Lindsay Robb, a peace negotiator for the Progressive
Unionist Party while a member of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force, was
jailed for 10 years at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday for conspiracy to
acquire and run guns to the UVF in Northern Ireland.
Two of his Scottish followers, John Johnston, of Campbell Crescent, Laurieston,
Falkirk, and William McArthur, of Ure Crescent, Bonnybridge, who were also
convicted of conspiracy after trial in Glasgow, were jailed for 10 and eight
years respectively.
Other members of the group, loyalist sympathisers from central Scotland who
were caught in a police and MI5 operation, and a Liverpool publican who stored
a handgun and a machine pistol for them, received shorter sentences from Lord
Sutherland.
The judge told the gang: ``Northern Ireland has enough troubles of its own
without interference of a deadly kind from anyone else outside.
``At a time when all sensible people are seeking peace in this unhappy province
it must be made clear that attempts to enlarge the arsenals of paramilitary
sectarian forces cannot be tolerated and the sentences to be passed must
reflect that fact.''
As he was led from court, Robb shouted defiantly: ``Up the UVF.'' A small group
of republican demonstrators chanted ``Free Colin Duffy,'' a reference to the
part Robb played in the jailing for life of an IRA murderer in July. Robb was a
witness to the killing of a former UDR officer in Lurgan, his home town, but
was allowed to give evidence anonymously by the Crown.
It was claimed yesterday that Robb, 28, told that trial he had no knowledge of
links between the Progressive Unionists and the UVF and that he condemned
violence. The demonstrators said yesterday that the trial judge in Northern
Ireland had commended Robb, by then a PUP peace negotiator, for the
impartiality, honesty, and credibility of his evidence.
The PUP said yesterday that it had had observers present throughout the trial
in Glasgow who had expressed concern at the ``concealed MI5 witnesses, the
dubious evidence that was allowed to be presented which prejudiced the minds of
the jury and Mr Robb's case''.
Members claimed there was no direct evidence to connect Robb to any offence and
said there would be an appeal against the conviction.
Earlier, Mr Donald Findlay, QC for Robb, said that his client continued to deny
that he had had any involvement in obtaining guns.
The group was arrested in a armed swoop in an Airdrie street.
Johnston, who received concurrent sentences totalling 11 years for other
offences, was said in court yesterday to still dispute he was a UVF member.
Publican Francis Hives, 45, was said by his counsel, Mr Charles Boag-Thompson,
QC, to have lost everything he had ever worked for. Hives had insisted there
were to be no gun deals within his premises. He had been swept along by events.
However, Lord Sutherland said that Hives had played a material part and jailed
him for five years.
William McArthur, 41, of Bonnybridge, was said by the judge also to have been
convicted of conspiracy but, although playing a lesser part than Johnston, he
still had been a major force. He was jailed for eight years for conspiracy and
received lesser concurrent terms for the other offences.
Lord Sutherland accepted that David White, 29, of Northburn Avenue, Airdrie, a
taxi driver, had played a lesser part in collecting the weapons and he jailed
him for five years for possession of the two guns with two lesser, concurrent
sentences on other charges.
Alexander Davidson, 23, who was found guilty of possessing two bullets at the
Seacat terminal in Stranraer, was jailed for two years.

<HEADLINE>Money supply figures hint at housing upturn</HEADLINE>

THE depressed housing market received a boost yesterday from the M4 money
supply, the wider monetary aggregate taking in bank and building society
lending and deposits, as well as from building societies' own lending figures
for the month.
Money supply grew by 1% in November to give a year-on-year increase of 9.3%,
topping the Government's 3% to 9% monitoring range for the first time.
The figures provided some encouragement that the housing market was at last
showing signs of moving. This was supported by the Building Societies
Association's own mortgage figures for the month which revealed a sharp upturn
in net lending to #865m from just #295m in October.
Actual M4 bank/building society lending rose #3400m in the month.
City economists were playing down the rate of expansion in M4, pointing out
that the strong growth was caused in part by under-funding of the public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR). During the course of a financial year this
influence should unwind.
Goldman Sachs' economist Martin Brookes said that although M4 growth picked up
strongly throughout this year, in coming months slower M4 and M0, the narrow
definition, should add to other data evidence of easing inflationary pressures.
Meanwhile, the Building Societies Association reports that, aside from net
lending, gross mortgage lending rose from #2624m to #2947m in November, while
net new commitments were also substantially ahead of October at #3216m, up from
#2887m.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
commented: ``While this strong increase may well represent increased building
society share, it is also to be hoped that it signals the start of a modest
recovery.
``The unilateral action by building societies to reduce mortgage rates,
followed by a further reduction after the fall in base rates last Wednesday,
means mortgage costs are at their lowest level since 1968. With tax cuts in the
pipeline, prospects for a modest recovery in the mortgage market in 1996 are
good.''
The British Bankers' Association reported buoyant credit demand in November.
While consumer credit fell back its October record, mortgage lending was higher
at some #700m.

<HEADLINE>Nato takes up mission in Bosnia `We are not here as cowboys looking for a fight' - Admiral Leighton Smith</HEADLINE>

Sarajevo, Wednesday
NATO took over the peacekeeping baton from the UN today after a shaky handover
and moved quickly to sweep away key roadblocks in Sarajevo and put the first
British troops in Serb-held areas.
Nato commander Admiral Leighton Smith formally took overall command of a
60,000-strong force to police a Bosnia peace treaty and insisted: ``We are not
here as cowboys looking for a fight.''
However he also made it clear that his forces had clear instructions to use
their awesome firepower if they felt threatened.
The day started badly for Nato's much-heralded mission as fog prevented Smith
from landing in Sarajevo for the handover, bringing wry smiles from UN
officials who have been a butt of endless criticism for their performance
during the war.
Nevertheless Nato quickly got into its stride after the change of control was
done without ceremony but on schedule, at 10am. Troops moved at once to
dismantle two Serb roadlblocks on the main road to Sarajevo's airport, which
has been closed for much of the war.
Shortly afterwards British forces pushed across a former front line in Bosnia
to become the first foreign fighting unit to be stationed on Serb-held
territory.
They were welcomed by local Serbs who offered them glasses of home-made spirits.
``We will accept any friends who will help to end this war,'' one Bosnian Serb
soldier said. ``This is the best moment in four years of war.''
Some 60,000 troops with heavy equipment and backed by formidable air power and
an array of spy satellites will fan out across Bosnia in the coming weeks as
the world's most powerful military alliance ensures that Bosnia's warring
parties implement last week's Paris peace treaty.
Meanwhile, American generals deployed in Bosnia and neighbouring Croatia linked
up for the first time today across the Sava river which separates the two
countries.
And an advance party of Russian troops arrived at the main US base at Tuzla,
bringing them together with American soldiers in a potential combat zone for
the first time in 50 years.
``I don't know what to think,'' said Craig Johnson, a member of the US team
flown into Tuzla to take over the base from Swedish UN troops.
``They have trained us and trained us back in the States that the Russians are
the enemy. Well, now they're no longer the enemy,'' he said with a laugh.
Russia, not a Nato member but worried that it has lost Soviet-era superpower
clout in foreign affairs, agreed to send 2000 combat troops and 2000 support
staff to join the 20,000 American Nato soldiers based at Tuzla.
Despite the arrival of the advance party, Russia's role in the multi-national
peacekeeping operation is still being discussed.
``They are waiting for a political decision from Moscow to see whether to join
the Nato force or not,'' said a Nato press officer.
``If they get a positive answer, the Russian contingent will be a brigade-sized
unit with three battalions. Its task will be the same as that of Ifor and they
will be working under US troops and not separately at all.''
In Sarajevo, Bosnian Serbs, who have been the most resistant to the peace deal
because it will mean their suburbs of the city returning to government control,
were resigned to the arrival of a Nato force they see as an occupying army.
``They won't protect us. They've been fighting against us since the beginning.
But what can we do?'' said Janja Mandic, a 49-year-old woman in the Serb-held
district of Grbavica as she carried home an aid package of canned meat.
In Washington, the International Monetary Fund said that it had approved
Bosnia's membership and granted the war-ravaged country an emergency #30m
credit.

Chernobyl
aid pledged
OTTAWA: Ukraine and the G7 industrial democracies yesterday signed an agreement
on the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power station, nearly a decade after
the world's worst nuclear accident.
The memorandum of understanding involves #1533m in aid from the G7 to support
the closure of the Chernobyl power plant by the year 2000.
Plane skids
NEW YORK: Kennedy International Airport was closed for four hours last night
and 45 flights from Europe were diverted after a Tower Air Boeing 747 skidded
off a runway while taking off in a snowstorm, injuring 12 people.
Dinosaur riddle
MIAMI: One of the world's most sophisticated research ships is set to sail from
Miami this week, seeking proof for a theory that the dinosaurs were killed off
by a cataclysmic explosion when an asteroid or comet smashed into Earth 65
million years ago and radically changed the environment. Scientists will drill
into the Earth's crust near the site of a giant crater seeking the answers to
the riddle of what killed the beasts.
Star `was eclipse'
NEW YORK: The three Wise Men who travelled to Bethlehem to see the new-born
Jesus were attracted to Israel by a double eclipse of Jupiter and not, as the
New Testament says, by a dazzling star, a US astronomer claims. Michael Molnar
linked astronomical events at the time of Christ's birth to astrological
symbolism on Roman coins to help him formulate his startling claim, published
in the New Scientist.
Shutdown urged
TOKYO: Calls for Japan's nuclear reactor to be closed down increased yesterday
when nuclear bosses admitted they had lied about film footage showing a serious
accident 12 days at the plutonium-fuelled Monju plant.
Miro vandalised
BRASILIA: A Brazilian artist desperate to promote his own work vandalised a
##fm painting by Spain's Joan Miro. Janr Reis, 27, told he slapped a handprint
of black glue on Miro's Women in the Street at a Rio exhibition because he had
could not sell his own paintings.
Soldiers plea
NAIROBI: Yemen urged Eritrea to free nearly 200 Yemeni soldiers captured last
weekend during fighting on a disputed island in the Red Sea. Eritrea had
pledged to release them two days previously.
Jail a monument
PRETORIA: South Africa yesterday declared Robben Island, the prison where
President Nelson Mandela was locked up for 18 years, a national monument.
Junior mafiosi
BARI: Four teenagers, two aged 14 and the others 17, have been arrested for
running a Mafia clan. They are suspected of the attempted murder of another
minor, extortion, theft, and illegal arms possession.
Reeve offered job
LOS ANGELES: Actor Christopher Reeve, paralysed from the neck down by a riding
accident in May, says he has received several acting and directing offers and
will start to consider scripts next year.
Briton held
MADRID: A Manchester couple who fled to Spain to escape British justice are
both behind bars. Linda McNelly, 45, absconded from prison in Staffordshire in
1992 while serving three years for cheque fraud and was held at a road block
near Alicante yesterday. Her husband Wally was arrested when he recently
returned to Britain and is in an Aberdeen prison charged in the theft of
#50,000 worth of antiques from a furniture van in the city in 1992.
Barbie in Africa
NAIROBI: Toy retailers in Kenya are doing a brisk trade in Christmas sales of a
black, Maasai Kenyan Barbie doll, the first in Africa. The doll wears a

FOR some time now there has been serious disquiet among those who study the
British political scene at the behaviour of Members of Parliament. We've always
had eccentrics, in this context a euphemism for being daft, but the
contemporary phenomenon is different and much more widespread, as if a
collective daftness has descended on the place.
We all know the background. Through the mists of time MPs have roamed the
badlands of Wild Westminster, massing in rival herds, bellowing and pawing the
ground in jousts of ritualised and feigned belligerence. The promised mayhem,
like most other things, didn't materialise, but bullshit did. Mounds of the
stuff, casting shadows o'er the parliamentary landscape and bringing to
Parliament that distinctive odour or flavour for which it is famed.
To be more precise it was mad bullshit, which experts in the field, lobby
correspondents and media political analysts, fussed over, probing for the inner
truth they believed was secreted somewhere in the shit, and whose discovery
would somehow justify their work. Alas without success.
I remember one old scribe, as urinated as a newt, in Annie's bar, one of many
watering holes in the Palace of Westminster, musing into his cups and
muttering, ``there is no inner truth, it's all shit. My monthly pay cheques
were nothing but a series of excremental payments''. He then took another long
sip and started muttering again. ``There is no inner meaning . . .''
The old scribe was being too sensitive. Sewage engineers handle the same basic
material as parliamentary correspondents but have no such feelings of guilt.
Somebody has to do it, and our scribes are our eyes and ears in the badlands.
They warn us of impending or potential disasters like Michael Portillo. It was
a venerable scribe who first alerted me to the dangers of parliamentary mad
bull's disease.
He had long ago identified the symptoms. Unsteady pins, an ungainly gait, a
tendency to fall over, a propensity to strike policemen and members of the
public, when returning to the cloisters from a reception where the bar was
free, and furiously blinking eyes, which seemed to be trying to focus or
re-focus, on something important, like your next drink.
Now these characteristics are not uncommon in the Houses of Parliament with 21
bars and cafes providing round-the-clock booze. An alcoholic, it is reckoned,
could live in Parliament for years, flitting from bar to bar, like a sort of
phantom of the opera, without anybody being any the wiser.
Once upon a time Winston Churchill, striding through the corridors, needed a
telephone, saw this guy using one and told him forcibly that this phone was
reserved for Members of Parliament. The guy retorted: ``I've been a Scottish
Labour Member for 20 years.'' Churchill looked at him intently, still knew him
not from Adam, and asked: ``Which bars have you been hiding in?''
Though the victims of mad bull's disease look as if blootered by bevvy it's a
different malaise, only contractable through exposure to parliamentary offal,
which has been recycled from debates past, and becomes more awful offal, each
time it's used and reused.
It should have been removed years ago, treated with chemicals to break it down
into constituent parts, then incinerated, placed in titanium tubes, and buried
in a remote part of the Himalayas for at least 1000 years, protected by a
special regiment of Gurkhas, led, of course, by white Anglo-Saxon officers, or
dumped in the ever-willing Dounreay.
This would have ended the unedifying spectacle, of poor mad bulls driven into
corrals or division lobbies by bulls, more mad, called Whips. How many more
times are we to witness the sordid relic of what was once a man, slither to his
feet at Prime Minister's Question Time, and say those dreaded words: ``Would my
Right Honourable Friend agree with me that . . .'' without taking action, like
putting him down.
There was concern that wives and families might be affected by exposure to
parliamentary offal. MPs are given relatively large sums of money for
secretarial, office administration, and research. An MP's wife who might before
his elevation have been a bingo caller or a double-glazing saleswoman, is then
discovered to have outstanding secretarial abilities, and put on the payroll.
Their child who might have left school with an O-level in domestic science is
often found to be a genetically programmed research genius, and put on the
payroll.
Thankfully the staff of MPs seem unaffected except for the odd research
assistant desperate to be a career politician. Funnily enough women MPs also
appear unaffected. No, dear reader, you're wrong, that lady MP is not a mad
cow, she's just mad.
As a General Election approaches the anxiety spasms associated with the disease
become more severe. Some MPs become completely deluded. The most afflicted talk
possessively of ``my seat'' as if current occupation bestows a property right
for all times to come.
When in danger of being dropped by their local party they wail, ``but it's my
career''. It's no good saying that if they wanted a career they should have
been a lawyer or a dentist, some of them are, as well as being MPs.
They view political parties as employment agencies for the likes of themselves.
Tell them that politics is about serving the people and they laugh like
demented coyotes.
Many MPs do have a sickness, but it's in the mind, which doesn't make it less
serious. They're only interested in their careers. They say what has to be
said, or do what has to be done, to safeguard their careers. The truth becomes
expendable, and a bit of a nuisance.
Imagine living that way. Career self-survival at all costs. No issue bigger
than yourself. No wider picture, only a small picture, a self-portrait. Such
self-obsessed priorities do induce a kind of madness, as we saw last week in
the Govan Labour Party. And it is said: ``Those that the gods would destroy,
they first make mad.''

<HEADLINE>City positive on Bank of Scotland plan to realise #211m from 49% flotation of Australian subsidiary BankWest warns of profit squeeze</HEADLINE>

BANKWEST, Bank of Scotland's new Australian subsidiary, expects profits growth
to slow as competition in the financial sector Down Under squeezes interest
rate margins.
The likely impact of competition on BankWest's profits was revealed in the
prospectus for Bank of Scotland's flotation of 49% of the Perth-based bank,
which only last month announced record earnings.
However, Bank of Scotland bought BankWest with an eye on the ``New Tiger''
economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan, and some
industry-watchers are confident about the longer-term benefits of the
acquisition.
BankWest, whose year-end is being brought into line with that of its parent
company, forecasts that net profits will advance only 6% in its next full
financial year to end-February 1997 to A$100m (#48.2m). This would represent a
marked slowdown of the growth in profits which it has enjoyed during the past
three years. The predicted advance is based on an adjusted prior-year net
profit figure of A$94.5m (#45.5m).
Last month, BankWest announced a 20% increase in net profits to A$99.2m
(#47.8m) for the year to end-September. Its strength in business lending helped
it weather a downturn in the Australian mortgage market and, stripping out
exceptionals, underlying net profits were up 38%.
The prospectus says: ``Continued competitive pressure, particularly on interest
margins, combined with a number of external factors, including the increased
tax rate, will, in the directors' opinion, constrain the bank's capacity to
increase profits after tax in the 1997 financial year as strongly as in the
previous three years.''
Bank of Scotland, which acquired 100% of BankWest for A$900m (#434m), aims to
raise A$438m (#211m) before expenses from the sale of 213.5 million shares in
the Australian bank at A$2.05 (99p).
Details of the flotation emerged yesterday, when the prospectus was registered
by the Australian Securities Commission. However, Bank of Scotland declined to
comment on the prospects for the flotation, on the grounds that Australian
stock market regulations prevented it from so doing because the prospectus had
not yet been issued.
Bank of Scotland had previously undertaken to float 49% of BankWest, subject to
it realising a minimum consideration of A$#416m (#200m).
If the net proceeds of the sale exceed A$416m the balance will be payable to
the Western Australian state government, which sold BankWest to Bank of
Scotland.
When the Scottish bank initially mooted the flotation plans, the City was
sceptical about its ability to sell 49% because it considered the proposed
public offer price was on the high side.
However, industry experts seem encouraged by the way the flotation is
progressing.
Michael Lever, banking analyst at broker James Capel in London, said there was
a slight sense of relief that Bank of Scotland looked like selling the 49%.
He said there were no indications that the flotation would not be a success.
BZW analyst Hugh Pye is extremely bullish about the BankWest purchase, Bank of
Scotland's biggest since it took over British Linen Bank in 1971.
He said: ``I think it is a good bank and a good acquisition. I would quite like
it if Bank of Scotland ended up owning the whole thing forever but they have
had to agree to sell down.
``However, they will still own 51%. On a long-term view, I think it is going to
prove very successful for them.''
Touching on the scepticism with which the announcement of the BankWest
acquisition was greeted back in September, Mr Pye said he believed a number of
observers had come round to a positive view.
He added: ``I think there are still some doubters but I think they will be
proved wrong in time.''
The BankWest offer will open on January 8 and close on February 9, with shares
expected to begin trading on the Australian Stock Exchange the following week.

Washington, Wednesday
A FLORIDA dope-head was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison yesterday
for killing a puppy. The average American murderer serves about seven years in
prison, though the courts are trying to raise that.
Allan Laboy killed the dog because it woke him in August last year. He ran out
of his house, grabbed the animal, and beat its brains out on the pavement. The
judge concluded that he had a record of abusing animals and sent him away for
five years for cruelty to animals, plus four-and-a-half years extra for
violating his parole on other crimes.
He had been released early from a sentence for burglary, and killing the dog
was apparently considered a violation of his promise to behave.
His defence lawyer explained that Mr Laboy was a drug addict who was spaced out
on cocaine and alcohol when he killed the dog.
Jury and judge all agreed that this was not a mitigating sentence.
The judge said that he had received hundreds of hand-written letters, chiefly
from children, from all over the country demanding a condign sentence on the
defendant. He was glad to comply.
There is a strong tendency in the United States to increase sentences,
particularly for drug offences. There are now more people in jail in America
than in any other country, well over 1.5 million, and prison-building is a
growing industry.
Mr Leboy's lawyers are to appeal against the sentence: if it is upheld, and the
precedent is followed, the prison population will explode yet further.
q.The Library of Congress, the world's largest depository of knowledge, has
scrapped an exhibition on the lives of plantation slaves because some black
members objected.
No-one will explain what has sent the library into a crisis of political
correctness. The exhibition had already toured the country, without protest,
for several months.
Plans for a more ambitious exhibition on Sigmund Freud ended in a 1982 law suit
alleging discrimination against blacks in promotion decisions at the library,
which agreed to pay $8m (#5.3m) in back pay to plaintiffs.
A member of staff said: ``There is an atmosphere of fear at the library now.''

Robert Parrish, film director and child star, born Columbus, Georgia, January
4, 1916, died Southampton, Long Island, December 4, 1995
ROBERT PARRISH worked with everyone in Hollywood during a long career which
began as an extra and a child actor in the silent era. He was an extra in
Murnau's Sunrise, made in 1927, a powder monkey in The Divine Lady, a saga
about Nelson made in 1929, and was the boy who blew the peashooter at Charlie
Chaplin in City Lights in 1931.
He became one of the children in the Our Gang films, but although he was a
handsome man his real career was behind the scenes. He graduated to film
editing, and during the war while serving in the navy edited John Ford's
Oscar-winning documentary, The Battle of Midway.
His first film, Cry Danger, made in 1951, was a gangster film starring Dick
Powell and Rhonda Fleming, which received decent notices and he worked
regularly thereafter. Parrish was not one of the great directors, but he made
some good films which pulled in the punters, including The Purple Plain, made
in 1954, in which Gregory Peck played a Canadian fighting the Burma campaign
with the help of a British supporting cast.
Others were Fire Down Below (1957) in which Rita Hayworth played a lady no
better than she should be who caused trouble on a south sea island between
Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon, and The Wonderful Country, (1959), in which
Mitchum rode the range. In 1962 he made In the French Style, a romantic comedy
starring Stanley Baker, one of many films which failed to make Jean Seberg a
star, while in 1967 he was one of several unhappy directors involved in Casino
Royale, the all-star, all-flop Bond movie everyone tends to forget.

<HEADLINE>Troubled Rodime considers restructuring</HEADLINE>

MOUNTING debts, negligible revenue and prolonged legal battles in the US have
forced computer disk drive company Rodime to consider restructuring its bank
debt and share capital.
The Scottish registered company pioneered the development of computer disk
drives in the eighties and once owned factories in Glenrothes, Florida and
Singapore.
But today Rodime consists of little more than a board which hires lawyers to
fight long and costly battles to defend its patents in the US.
Debts have mounted to $47.2m (#30.6m) and it no longer has sufficient income to
pay dividends on its Preference shares or interest on its $33.9m (#22m) of bank
borrowings.
``The board is currently in discussions with its bankers regarding a possible
reconstruction of the company's share capital and indebtedness,'' Rodime said
in a statement accompanying its latest annual results.
Last September a US federal appeals court threw out its test case against the
computer firm Quantum for alleged infringement of a patent on 3.5-inch disk
drives.
The ruling has damaged Rodime's chances of obtaining royalties from other
manufacturers and of winning a second test case against another US firm,
Seagate Technology. This has already dragged on for three years without coming
to court.
Rodime shares have fallen from just over 11p to just 1p this year and
Scottish-based director David Mathewson said the board hoped to put its
restructuring proposal to shareholders in January.
This could take several forms, including a debt-equity swap to help compensate
Preference shareholders and a debt restructuring to capitalise interest arrears.
Rodime's pre-tax loss fell to #4.1m from #7.0m in the year to September 30,
reflecting lower payments to the company's US lawyers.
``The previous year there had been a tremendous activity on the Seagate case
and that was slowed down last year,'' Mr Mathewson said.
Rodime hopes this will come to court in the second half of 1996. But it is
still awaiting a pre-trial conference which has already suffered 10
postponements.
Even if Rodime loses the Seagate case, it still hopes to generate revenue from
patents being sought on other types of disk drive which are less used than the
3.5-inch type.
Revenue from royalties rose to #318,000 from #33,000 last year, but no new
agreements have been signed since 1993.

Vatican City, Wednesday
THE Vatican, seeking to lead adolescents away from temptation, issued a sex
education guide today to help Roman Catholics save their children from sin.
The handbook, compiled by the Pontifical Council for the Family after several
years' study, urges parents to steer children away from society's ``negative
influences'' and a secular ``banalisation of sex'' by teaching the facts of
life at home.
``They must be able to give their children.......a positive and calm
explanation of Christian morality,'' it said.
It cited ``the indissolubility of marriage, the relationship between love and
procreation as well as the immorality of sex before marriage, abortion,
contraception, and masturbation''.
The Vatican reiterated the Pope's hard line on Aids.
``Parents must refute the promotion of so-called `safe sex' or `safer sex', a
dangerous and immoral policy, based on the illusory theory that a condom can
provide sufficient protection against Aids,'' the Vatican said.
``Parents must insist on abstinence outside marriage and fidelity inside
marriage as the only true and sure education to avoid infection.''
The 60-page handbook singled out masturbation as a particular sin, calling it a
``grave disorder'', characteristic of immaturity, for which there was no moral
justification. It gave parents no tips about what to say to teenagers on the
subject.
On homosexuality, it advised parents not to raise the issue at all before
adolescence and to seek expert advice if necessary. It reiterated a Church
blanket ban on homosexual sex, which it said was ``against the laws of
nature''.
The Vatican put the onus on parents to act as role models for their children,
echoing the Pope's recent defence of women's roles as mothers and their right
to remain at home.
``Mothers who value their vocation as mothers and their place in the home help
enormously in developing in their daughters the qualities of femininity and
maternity and in giving their sons a clear, strong, and noble example of
womanhood,'' the guide said.
``Fathers who conduct themselves with virile dignity, without machismo, will be
an attractive model for their sons and will inspire respect, admiration and
security in their daughters.''-Reuter.

LIKE most sensible people, the Diary was moved to outrage by the English vicar
who recently took it upon himself to tell 50 small children that neither Santa
nor the tooth fairy exist.
``It's your mum and dad,'' he allegedly alleged. Who could believe such arrant
nonsense? Wanton cruelty aside, we could only marvel at the logic of Canon
Brian Andrews, of Abbots Langley, Herts, who has since apologised for his
``ill-judged remark''.
He said he had simply been trying to show children that, while the story of
Santa Claus was a fairy tale, the story of the birth of Christ was not. Small
wonder the little ones were reduced to hysterics.
Ignoring the simple fact that presents actually turn up under the tree each
year while the Big Man remains, 2000 years on, a tad overdue for his
appointment, the vicar's claim strikes us as a philosophical strategy akin to
arguing that pixies are real because the Wizard of Oz has been exposed as a
hoax.
According to the Diary's department of Berserk But Deeply Systematic Theology,
however, the canon's condition is not so very unusual. Known as the Pull the
Other One Syndrome, it is a growing social problem. Today, as a guide to
readers, we bring you the latest research.
The Marriage of the Prince of Wales. A widespread delusion, belief in this
``fairy tale'' afflicts entire countries. There is no such thing.
The European Triumphs of Glasgow Rangers. Thousands have travelled to the ends
of the earth in the hope of witnessing one of these miraculous events, last
believed to have occurred in the distant past. Researchers have yet to confirm
a sighting.
Britain's Economic Recovery. The so-called Feel-Good Gnome who appears once a
year with a red box full of ``goodies'' is in fact a fat bloke hired for the
occasion by the Bank of England. The box, children, is empty.
The Lottery Regulator. Believed to fly around the world with no assistance
whatever, the Lottery Pixie is thought only to hand out huge amounts of money
to nice little companies who have been good all year long. In fact, as any
expensive legal team could prove, he does no such thing.
The Four Wise Beatles. Contrary to all appearances, only Saint John Lennon is
now accepted as authentic by students with ears.
The Labour Party, otherwise known as the Social Democratic Brunch. Scholars are
divided. Some point to the Miracle of Labour's Second Coming as proof this
otherwise unbelievable entity actually exists. Others point to Tony Blair as
proof that the opposite is, in fact, the case.
Free no more
HIGH jinks in the House of Commons, where the Government, in the shape of the
mean and moody Michael Forsyth, was moving the other night to give still more
power to the mighty Scottish Grand Committee. Commons Leader Tony Newton told
the House the plans had been ``widely welcomed north of the border'', which may
well be true, depending on which Tory you talk to.
Labour, predictably, demurred just a bit. It was thus left to Sir Hector Munro,
elder statesman of Scottish Conservatism, to put the matter in perspective.
Welcoming the reforms, he said the plans were ``a major step forward in
bringing government to the people of Scotland''.
In sharp contrast, presumably, to what we enjoyed hitherto.
Stable condition
A PARTY of Edinburgh primary school children (we declare an interest in this
one) is hauled along to a local hospital, there to bawl carols and impose some
Christmas cheer on defenceless senior citizens.
``And how did it go?'' we inquire afterwards of Deeply Callous Child. ``Not
bad,'' he offers. ``One old dear in tears and three fast asleep inside 20
minutes.'' And that was after he had learned all the words, too.
SOME readers may have noticed the American legal system holds an entirely
unhealthy fascination for this Diary. We can't think why, but can only report
that in 1992 a federal jury in Montgomery, Alabama, found that a group of fuel
retailers had conspired to fix prices, as alleged, but decided on balance that
the plaintiffs had been damaged only to the tune of $1 (tripled, by anti-trust
law, to a whopping $3).
Finishing up the case last month (American courts being about as speedy as
ours) Judge Myron Thompson nevertheless ordered the losers to pay the fees of
the opposition's 19 victorious lawyers - fees totalling $2,035,658, and not a
cent more.
Jurists among you will also be pleased to hear that earlier this year the
Louisiana legislature closed a decade-old loophole in its drinking law. From
1985 until June 1995, the legal age for buying or drinking liquor had been 21,
but it was illegal to sell liquor only to those under 18.
A sporting nation
THOSE who were wondering how Scotland ended up in the same group as England for
next year's European Championships should have looked no further than the
sports section of Monday's Daily Telegraph, which carried the non-aligned
headline: ``Scots march on Wembley to add spice to England's task''.
Good to know your place, don't you think?
Ask a silly question
MEANWHILE, Edinburgh's Evening News, perhaps the finest evening newspaper in
the entire capital, runs a ``fun daily quiz''. Earlier this week its ten
questions were aimed at those sad people proud to be known as ``telly addicts''.
Question Four: ``Which spoof chat show host revels in the company of a group of
Manchester senior citizens and is otherwise known as Mrs Merton?'' Answer:
``Mrs Merton.''

THE US Senate voted tonight to use legal action to force the White House to
release documents in the Whitewater investigation.
The Senate passed a resolution to seek a court order enforcing a subpoena by
the Senate Whitewater Committee for notes made by former White House counsel
William Kennedy at a 1993 meeting on Whitewater, involving President Clinton's
lawyers and White House aides.
The White House and Mr Kennedy are refusing to comply with the subpoena, saying
release of the notes would violate the president's lawyer-client privilege.
If the legal action takes place, it could lead to a constitutional
confrontation that might have to be decided by the US Supreme Court.-Reuter.

Bocac, Wednesday
BRITISH Nato forces pushed across a former front line in Bosnia today to become
the first foreign fighting unit stationed on Serb-held territory.
Just a couple of hours after the United Nations formally handed responsibility
for keeping the peace in Bosnia to Nato, some 100 British soldiers swept past
Serb checkpoints to venture where UN peacekeepers had never been allowed to go.
B Squadron of the Light Dragoons headed in armoured vehicles up the narrow
Vrbas river valley in western Bosnia to set up camp at Krupa, a village some 18
miles south of their ultimate destination, the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka.
``Our aim is to make our presence felt as quickly as possible,'' said spokesman
Major Alastair Ross in Gornji Vakuf, headquarters of Nato's British-led
division South-West.
The Dragoons crossed the line just past a ruined medieval castle and the Bocac
hydro-electric power station, the only thing working for miles around in a
snowswept no-man's land.
Trees, snow, the emerald river, and villages destroyed by fighting or burned
out of spite were all they saw on the way.
This area, around Mrkonjic Grad, is to pass back to the Serbs, who lost it only
two months ago, under the Bosnian peace treaty signed last week in Paris. All
the residents have fled.
The Dragoons had swopped their blue UN peacekeeper berets for regimental ones
and set out before dawn in UN vehicles once painted white, now green and black,
from their base in government-held Bugojno.
The 13,000 Britons, the second biggest Nato contingent after the Americans,
will keep the peace in Bihac, Prijedor, Jajce, and other Bosnian towns which
have all become bywords for death and degradation in Europe's worst conflict
for 50 years.
With one-third of their troops already on the ground serving under the UN, the
British had a head start over the 20,000 Americans arriving in Bosnia for the
first time, and managed to deploy more quickly across central Bosnia.
Nato's Implementation Force (Ifor) is the first outside force the Serbs in the
Banja Luka area have seen during the war, but it is just the latest foreign
army to pass through the region over the centuries.
The Romans, Ottoman Turks, Austro-Hungarians, and Nazi Germans have all marched
through an area which once stood on a main trade route between Europe and the
Orient.
In Croat and Muslim-held areas of Bosnia, people have grown used to a foreign
presence through UN peacekeepers over three years of war. In more hostile Serb
areas unsure of outsiders, however, Ifor will have to tread more carefully.
Banja Luka, ``cleansed'' of virtually all non-Serbs to become an ``ethnically
pure'' region which aid officials have dubbed an intolerant ``Heart of
Darkness'', could pose problems, although British officers said they had been
pledged co-operation.
The town is a base for General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander whom
Ifor members will be obliged to arrest should they see him. Nato officers say
they will not seek him out.-Reuter.

ROYAL Bank of Scotland chairman Lord Younger yesterday sold nearly
threequarters of his shareholding, although he could have realised an
additional #35,000-plus if he had taken profits at the height of Friday's
takeover speculation.
Lord Younger sold 40,000 of his 54,655 shares at 565p, well adrift of the 658p
intra-day high to which Royal Bank surged on Friday amid fevered speculation
that Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation was about to launch a #6100m bid.
His sale realised #226,000.
The chairman's office said there was nothing significant or untoward about the
transaction.
Royal Bank directors were prevented from dealing in its shares between the end
of September and November 29 because of the two-month ``close period'' ahead of
the announcement of final results.
Hanson disposals
HANSON has decided on two major divestments which will go much of the way
towards achieving the #2000m disposals target it has set itself. It is
proposing to float off Suburban Propane, the third-largest distributor of
propane in the US, which will realise about #500m, and it has earmarked the
sale of Cavenham Forest Products for at least #1000m. The company owns
1,750,000 acres of forests in North America and a number of sawmills. Other
assets in the out-tray include the stake in National Grid which Hanson acquired
with its takeover of Eastern Electricity, and Seven Seas, a manufacturer of
vitamin supplements.
Flotation plans
INCHCAPE has decided to press ahead with the flotation of its insurance broking
business Bain Hogg. The group said in April 1994 that it intended to float the
business eventually but it has received a number of approaches to buy it in
recent months. It has concluded that flotation remains the best option.
Murray trust lags
MURRAY Split Capital Trust lagged behind its main benchmark indices in the
three months to November 30, but said this was just a ``blip'' in an otherwise
good performance. The #26.7m trust, which aims for both capital and investment
growth, saw net assets increase 2.3% during the first quarter of its financial
year. The FTSE All-Share Index rose 4% and the Kleinwort Benson TOPSI-100
Index, which tracks higher-yielding shares, rose 3% over the same period. The
dividend was increased 3.8% to 2.75p from the first quarter of last year as a
sign of confidence. The net asset value of the income shares barely rose to
51.8p from 51.6p at the end of the last quarter of 1994-1995. The NAV of the
capital shares increased to 219.0p from 213.5p.
Shields on track
GLASGOW'S Shields Automotive yesterday announced its #500,000 acquisition of a
south Glasgow-based Toyota car and van dealership from Lex Service. The two
dealerships, which sit next to each other on St Andrews Road, employ about 80
people and offer full after-sales facilities such as bodyshop, MOT, service and
maintenance, parts and paint ovens. ``Our mid-term goal is basically to build
up a dealership group,'' the company said. ``We're aiming for having five
dealerships with a combined #50m-plus turnover.''

<TEXT>
AN Ayrshire mother was last night celebrating after Strathclyde Regional
Council decided to delay a decision on closing her daughter's school.
Mrs Jean Kerr was about to fight a decision by the region to close a special
needs school attended by her daughter, Helen, eight, because it suffered from
``sick building syndrome''.
The region had decided to shut Craigpark School, Ayr, despite local pressure to
keep it open backed by a 10,500-signature petition supporting the pupils'
parents.
Strathclyde's decision to close the school followed numerous complaints from
staff and pupils about suffering nausea. Yesterday, before a hearing was due to
take place at the Court of Session, Edinburgh, the region agreed to a reprieve
for Craigpark, at least until the end of next month.
Mrs Kerr, of Portland Road, Dalrymple, was about to ask for a suspension of the
closure order, but the school board chairman, Mr Roy McHattie, said the school
had won a stay of execution.
Last night, Mrs Kerr spoke about the sick building syndrome: ``It didn't affect
all the children or staff. Some became nauseous, others had dry throats, skin
irritations, and dry eyes.
``No-one could find a cause for it. Strathclyde sent in their own regional
chemist twice and Dundee University came in to investigate the problem. That's
when they decided it was SBS. It's been going on for three years.''
Craigpark is for profoundly handicapped youngsters.
Floorboards were replaced and a new ventilation system installed at a cost of
#120,000 last year. The children went back for three days, but the problems
started up again.
``We don't say there is nothing wrong with the school. There's definitely a
problem. We just feel Strathclyde could investigate the problem a bit more
thoroughly,'' Mrs Kerr added.

THE housing market is still deep in the doldrums as can be seen from continuing
poor results from the majority of housebuilders.
Yesterday's profit warning from Edinburgh-based CALA was a case in point. It is
suffering from a low level of visitors and sales in South-east England,
probably the hardest hit housing area. But there are now signs that the market
could at last be in sight of recovery, if only modest.
This at any rate was the message in yesterday's data from the Bank of England
and the Building Societies Association which showed mortgage lending pick-up.
Anecdotal evidence, so far, also suggests that the building societies
themselves are becoming more optimistic.
The societies and other lenders as well as members of the construction industry
had of course asked the Chancellor to try to kick-start the market by some
Budget initiative. He declined to do this but the trend of lower interest rates
with the societies and banks leading the way with further mortgage interest
rates reductions even before base rates were reduced. They then cut rates again.
This clearly is the best tonic to encourage house purchase. Many potential
buyers will anyway have held back until after the Budget. And if purchasers do
return in numbers it will still take time for this to work its way through to
housebuilders.
Moreover, the housing market should be wary of false dawns. There have been two
of them. That ``feel-good'' factor has proved very elusive and tax cuts and
lower interest rates in themselves may not be enough to counter job insecurity
and stressful working conditions.
Employment may be rising but the terms of conditions are not necessarily such
as to encourage long-term financial commitments. But for the moment mortgage
lenders appear to have taken an optimistic turn which is actually somewhat
ironic given their recent pleas to Mr Clarke.
New team
BT'S relationship with its regulator Oftel is edgy at the best of times but it
is likely to deteriorate as it battles to prevent Oftel's director-general, Don
Cruickshank, from achieving more wide-ranging powers against anti-competitive
behaviour.
Now BT is upgrading its compliance department to ensure it abides by its
various operating licences and with competition and fair trading law. A new
post of director of compliance is being created and the holder will head a
small department reporting regularly to the BT board's audit committee. At
present these functions are divided between a number of individuals, some of
whom have other responsibilities as well.
The new dedicated team will no doubt be more adept at countering arguments put
up by Oftel.
Even BT would admit that in an organisation of its size some lapses in
practices are bound to occur. Competitors who usually depend on it to deliver
calls, claim far worse things go on. For example, Keith Monserrat of Scottish
Telecom alleged BT was particularly unco-operative over value-added data
services which carry higher margins.
Mr Cruickshank wants the power to act quickly when anti-competitive practices
come to light. At present it is a lengthy process and rules are drawn so
tightly the practice can slip between them so is not dealt with.
If this happens it can only be corrected through an amendment to the licence
which has to be agreed with BT. If agreement cannot be reached the whole thing
is referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a ruling.
BT is wary about the regulator extending his powers and will almost certainly
force the issue to the MMC.
If it can delay this into 1997 it may avoid it altogether, because a Labour
Government would appoint a new regulator and it appears to be sympathetic
towards BT despite its continuing market dominance.
A team dedicated to the complexities of the licence and competition law will
help the group in the tussles to come.
Huge gamble
IF you want to buy a share at bargain basement prices, look no further than
Rodime, the one-time king of computer disk drives.
At 1p a share you won't find much cheaper on the stock market, but even then
you'd be taking a huge gamble.
The company has virtually no assets other than a set of patents which it is
fighting long and expensive court battles in the United States to enforce - so
far unsuccessfully.
The factories Rodime once owned on three continents are gone. Royalties from
licensing other manufacturers to make disk drives have been cut to a trickle.
The company's continued existence depends entirely on the generosity of its
bankers and its debts continue to mount.
Rodime is in heavy arrears on its interest payments and cannot even afford to
pay dividends on its Preference shares. Most other companies in such
circumstances would simply have folded.
But Rodime keeps alive a tiny flame of hope that by paying even more millions
of dollars to its US lawyers it will one day win a US court case to enforce
respect for its patents.
That could open up a new revenue stream that might yet be the company's
salvation.
But it's a long shot. Yesterday's news that Rodime may shortly propose a
restructuring of its capital and debt sent its shares down another !fp to 1p.
At that price they are hardly worth selling. But only a fool or a very brave
punter would buy.

Los Angeles, Wednesday
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD girl who underwent surgery to allow her to smile will be home
for Christmas.
Chelsey Thomas, her face slightly swollen after an 11-hour surgery five days
ago, was expected to be released by Friday, her doctor said.
The blonde, blue-eyed youngster was in good condition and surgeons were pleased
with her progress, said Dr Avron Daniller, chief of plastic surgery at the
Woodland Hills hospital in Los Angeles.
Chelsey, who lives in Palmdale, California, was born with a rare neurological
disorder that prevents her from smiling.
The first of two operations was completed last Friday, but it will be months
before the results are evident. If successful, a second operation on the other
side of her mouth will be performed in about six months.
Surgeons transplanted a nerve from Chelsey's thigh into the left side of her
face, connecting it to the muscle responsible for smiling.
Chelsey is one of an estimated 500 to 1000 people in the US afflicted with
Moebius syndrome, in which the nerves that transmit commands from the brain to
the facial muscles are missing.-AP.

THE Rev J Donald Smith MA, BD, DD, who has died at the age of 79, was for three
years among the thousands of British Servicemen held in the notorious Changi
Camp and forced to work on the Siam-Burma ``death railway''. He later wrote a
book, remarkably free of rancour, about his experiences.
Donald Smith was born in Aberdeenshire in 1916. His father was dominie in the
village of Fintry, and his grandfather parish minister of Keith Hall. He was
educated at Robert Gordon's College and graduated with honours in French and
German from Aberdeen University in 1939. He intended to become a teacher but
when the Second World War broke out volunteered for service and found himself
attached to the Intelligence Corps.
Being fluent in modern languages, he was trained and equipped for desert
warfare, he thought, in Basra. But in 1941, he found himself posted to the 18th
Division, destination Singapore. The route there took him to Halifax, Nova
Scotia, in American ships. He sailed for the Far East by the South Atlantic in
mountainous seas to Capetown and then up to Mombasa.
Donald Smith and his comrades landed in Singapore on January 13, 1942. On
January 20, the Japanese attacked. ``The 14th of February we called black
Saturday,'' he said.
For the next three years Smith and thousands of gifted and dedicated servicemen
were prisoners in Changi Camp, working on the Siam-Burma ``death railway.''
They lived and nearly died there.
Donald wrote up the story in a book of quite splendid prose - as moving a
record of courage, faith, and hope - with never a trace or bitterness or hate,
as ever I have read. And All the Trumpets was published in 1954. It was written
on the Isle of Bute, where he stayed for seven years after his release.
He was community officer of Bute. The first time I met him was there, a shy,
self-effacing, and obviously highly gifted person. I had known nothing about
him and he did not say anything about himself or his experiences. He married a
Rothesay girl, Gina Cunningham. She was to become a great and gracious partner
and colleague in his ministries.
Donald was seriously weakened by his ordeal. His central vision had been
destroyed. But he fought on and in 1957 gained his second degree of BD. ``Gina
read so many books with me that she gained the B and I the D,'' he said.
Together Donald and Gina exercised great and good ministries in Errol, Cults
East, and in Auchtergaven; retiring in 1981 to Kintore. In 1978, Aberdeen
University honoured him with the degree of Doctor of Divinity.
He died of cancer, going as he lived, bravely and thoughtfully. A man of mercy
and truth. A great number of friends and members of his various congregations
gathered in Kintore Parish Church for his funeral service.

Warsaw, Wednesday
POLAND'S Cabinet today dismissed allegations by outgoing President Lech Walesa
that ex-communist Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy had dangerous contacts with a
Moscow spy.
Walesa called a sudden meeting of the National Defence Committee last night to
say he had been given secret materials revealing a threat to state security.
A source said the allegation concerned Oleksy's past social contacts in Warsaw
with someone who turned out to be a Russian intelligence agent.
After an emergency Cabinet meeting yesterday, a statement said: ``The Cabinet
does not share the view about there being a threat to the State.''
However the pro-Walesa foreign, defence and interior ministers dissented from
the Cabinet judgment and Walesa left the meeting in silence.
Oleksy, who denied the claims, later said on television that he would not
``give in to blackmail'' or resign.
Walesa, who led the Solidarity union to victory over communist rule in 1989,
lost last month's elections to Oleksy's close ally Aleksander Kwasniewski and
is due to hand over power on Saturday.-Reuter.

In William Russell's view the latest contender for Jerry Lewis's comic crown is
going off his chump
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (PG) directed by
Steve Oedekerk
On general release from Boxing Day
The Indian in the Cupboard (PG) directed by Frank Oz
On general release from tomorrow
IF YOU have ever wondered what an ace in the hole looks like now is your chance
to find out. Not that I recommend it, because there are better films to pass
your time with in the cinema this Christmas than Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls.
The hole the comedian Jim Carrey has dug for himself is exceedingly deep and
not worth exploring. The advice is not given lightly, because Carrey's first
outing as the manic investigator in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was great fun,
suggesting that here was a fine new star comedian in the Jerry Lewis tradition,
but with more charm, adept at pulling both funny faces and physical comedy.
His promise was fulfilled in his next starring role in The Mask as a man
transformed, from time to time, into a cartoon character by an ancient Egyptian
mask, which he had carelessly put on his face. The dazzling special effects
could have swamped Carrey totally, but his comic personality proved strong
enough to overcome them and there was a flesh and blood comedian up there on
the screen as well as the cartoon character.
Admittedly, I was less entranced by his high camp Riddler in Batman Forever,
but there is no denying that he performed with abandon and got the laughs in a
film which, while it pulled them in at the box office, was very much a Chinese
meal of a movie.
His most recent hit, Dumb and Dumber, in which he starred with Jeff Daniels -
they played a dense twosome who ran a pet parlour - left me stone cold, but I
saw it on video on my own, not circumstances in which one should watch
brain-dead comedy. Such films must be seen in the cinema, preferably after a
couple of pints of lager, to achieve their effect.
By the standards of the genre - the Wayne's World and Bill and Ted films are
other notable examples - Dumb and Dumber was well above par, and while it may
not have made me laugh much, Carrey's comic personality remained appealing.
Alas, in this new outing as Ace Ventura things have gone sadly wrong. Ace, the
man with the Li'l Abner quiff, loves animals, and the opening sequence, a
splendid send-up of the opening scenes in the Stallone mountain drama, Cliff
Hanger, promises well.
Having scaled impossible heights to rescue a racoon lost in a mountain-top
plane crash, Ace sees it plunge to its death after the harness, to which it is
linked, gives way. There is a vintage gross moment when, on his way up the
cliff, he encounters a hungry baby eagle. In some comic scenarios Mummy eagle
would appear and attack him, but not in the world of Ventura. What happens I
will not reveal, but it has the right disgusting, no-holds-barred edge.
We next find Ace in a Buddhist monastery, where he has gone to find himself,
being asked by a British colonial official (Ian McNeice) to come to Africa to
help the local Consul General (Simon Callow) find a lost sacred white bat,
whose disappearance threatens to spark off a civil war between two tribes.
So far so good, but once in Africa the film goes to pieces. What is surprising,
given the politically correct climate in the United States, not to mention the
fact that black Americans are so proud of their African roots, is the view
taken of the natives. It makes that of the old Johnny Weismuller Tarzan films,
which today are frankly offensive, seem positively enlightened.
Carrey mugs frantically - as a face puller he is second to none - but he has
nobody to play off, and there is less of the physical comedy than before. Even
the animals he meets are given little scope, and his friendly monkey companion,
Spike, is no Cheetah. The fact that Callow, an actor who tends to go over the
top of the top at the drop of a false eyelash, looks positively staid is some
measure of how frenetic Carrey is in his search for laughs.
The plot makes no sense, and some of the stunts go beyond the bounds of
acceptable outrageousness. The sight of a naked Carrey emerging from the womb
of a rhino is not something I wish to see ever again. But I did laugh once. At
the end, Callow, the villain of the piece, flees into the jungle where he meets
the randy silver-backed lady gorilla we have been repeatedly told is lurking in
the bush and nature takes its course.
Carrey fans will ensure that the box office is good, but there are diminishing
returns and if his next films - there is to be another Mask - prove as dire
then that bright future will fade fast. On the other hand he got $20m for this
one so he can laugh all the way to the bank, even if the audiences do not do
much laughing. ``All-l-lRIIIGHTY then,'' as Ace would say? No, it is not.
A better bet, although well down the list of must-see Christmas movies in a
year that has the splendid tale of a trotter at large, Babe, and the witty The
Santa Clause on offer, is The Indian in the Cupboard. Directed by Frank Oz, of
Muppet fame, it is based on the book by Lynn Reid Banks in which nine-year-old
Omri (Hal Scardino), given an old cupboard as a birthday present, discovers,
when he puts another of his presents, a 3in-tall plastic Indian, inside it,
that the toy comes to life.
The Indian, played by a native American called Litefoot, turns out to be Little
Bear, a real Iroquois chief, and Omri forms a friendship with him which comes
under stress when his friend, Patrick, puts a cowboy in the cupboard.
This is the enchanting world of Mistress Masham's Repose, The Borrowers or
Gulliver's Travels in which getting to know the miniature people provides
lessons about life for the humans involved.
Oz and screenwriter, Melissa Mathison, have treated the book with respect, but,
for obvious box office reasons, the setting has been shifted to America, which
causes some of the adventures to lose their point. For all its timeless appeal
the story is firmly rooted in an English story telling tradition.
The British Tommy in a tin hat, for example, who administers first aid after
the Indian and the Cowboy (David Keith) fight, might conceivably be found in a
British toy box, but not in one in Manhattan.
There is also a scene in which Omri and Patrick, a really unpleasant brat, fall
out over their new friends - Omri sees them as people, Patrick as animated toys
- which rings very false. The special effects as little man steps into monster
hand are superbly done, and Hal Scardino makes an delightful Omri - bookish,
grave, and sensitive, but never a wimp.
Both Litefoot and David Keith make their 3in-high heroes the stuff of adventure
stories, but Oz has unaccountably made a rather dull film from Lynn Reid
Banks's celebrated, and far from dull, book.
Add Kenneth Branagh's In the Bleak Midwinter and Jean Cocteau's La Belle et la
Bete to your list, and there is plenty around in the cinema this Christmas to
make an outing worthwhile should what is on offer on television pall.
It makes the old Tarzan films         look positively enlightened

Milan, Wednesday
PROSECUTORS called today for the symbol of Italy's war on corruption, former
star magistrate Antonio Di Pietro, to be indicted on charges of extortion and
abuse of office.
The request, which could shatter Di Pietro's political ambitions, was lodged in
Brescia, northern Italy. It capped seven months of inquiries into bombshell
allegations that the man associated with exposing the political corruption
scandal that felled Italy's old governing class had himself engaged in corrupt
practices.
A judge must now decide whether to order a trial.
Di Pietro's lawyer insisted on his client's innocence and hinted that the
allegations had been fuelled by revenge.
``Antonio Di Pietro has been the target of allegations of all kinds. It is the
price he has had to pay for his stubborn pursuit of the `Clean Hands'
investigation,'' said Massimo Dinoia.
Prosecutors also requested a trial on charges of complicity in blackmail for
former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's brother Paolo, former Defence
Minister Cesare Previti, and two Justice Ministry inspectors.
They are alleged to have used information about Di Pietro's past to force him
into quitting Milan's elite team of investigators one year ago.
Di Pietro has played an increasingly high-profile role as a ``political
conscience'' in the four-year Italian corruption scandal.
With many opinion polls still identifying him as the man Italians would most
like to see as prime minister, commentators said that he had been awaiting the
outcome of the Brescia inquiry before deciding whether to enter
politics.-Reuter.

CATHERINE Rogan and Michelle Bergin are on the stairway to success as they
provide catering for the launch of a directory of Scottish young entrepreneurs,
writes ANDREW MULLINS.
The 1996 yearbook of the Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust (PSYBT) was
unveiled at their Wholefoods and Sweet Nothings cafe in Glasgow's Princes
Square yesterday.
The cafe is one of 2800 small businesses in Scotland set up with the help of
#8.6m of loans and grants from the trust, whose patron is the Prince of Wales.
The yearbook is backed by Scottish Enterprise as part of its plans to make 1996
the Year of the Entrepreneur.
The book is intended to promote PSYBT and encourage networking between young
entrepreneurs aged 18 to 25 who have received help from it.
Publisher Caspian Woods explained that PSYBT had helped him with a low-cost
loan and a business advisor who provided three years of after care. The trust's
volunteer advisers are mainly retired business people.
Mr Woods, whose publications include the new PSYBT yearbook, said the
assistance he received was ``worth its weight in gold''.

Vivian Blaine (born Vivien Stapleton), musical comedy actress; born Newark, New
Jersey, November 21, 1921, died New York, December 9, 1995
BROADWAY stars seldom get the chance to recreate their greatest roles when the
film comes to be made, but Vivian Blaine was lucky.
The first and possibly the greatest lady to tell a man to take back that mink,
she played the floozie with a heart and a head cold - Miss Adelaide - in Guys
and Dolls when it was filmed in 1955 with Frank Sinatra as her reluctant
fiance, Nathan Detroit.
It is an indictment of the studio system that her best film role, despite a
miscast Sinatra, was one she had already played in the theatre, because during
the forties she had appeared in a succession of Fox musicals to little effect.
She began her career as a band singer with Art Kessel and his Kassels in the
Air, and was given a contract by 20th Century Fox in 1942. Four small parts
followed before Jitterbugs in 1943, a Laurel and Hardy comedy in which she was
billed as ``the Cherry Blonde'', a night club singer the two comedians helped
fight off gangsters.
The next year she had two leading roles followed in Greenwich Village, a 1920s
story about a classical musician who allowed his work to be used in a jazz
musical, starring with Don Ameche and Carmen Miranda, and Something for the
Boys, loosely based on a Cole Porter show.
In 1945 she appeared in State Fair, the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical,
opposite the crooner, Dick Haymes. But she did not unseat the studio's reigning
blonde, Betty Grable, and when she made Three Little Girls in Blue in 1946 it
was another aspirant to the throne of the leading blonde, June Haver, who got
top billing.
She recreated the role of Miss Adelaide when Guys and Dolls came to the London
Coliseum in 1954, and her career thereafter, once she had played the role for
the screen, was spent largely in the theatre and in television.
Her stage musicals included Say Darling, Company, in which she played the role
created by Elaine Stritch of the lady who lunched, Gypsy, Follies, and Hello
Dolly. A fine singer, who could belt a song and sing it sweetly, if she did not
make it into the pantheon of the cinema's great musical leading ladies, she
certainly did so on Broadway.

Moscow, Wednesday
THE Communists and their allies will hold about 40% of the seats in the new
Russian Parliament, according to the latest projections.
However President Boris Yeltsin, breaking his silence over the Communist
revival, said that the outcome of Sunday's parliamentary election was no
tragedy and would not force him to dilute reforms.
``We have no reason for concern or to regard the election as a tragedy,''
Yeltsin told reporters at the sanatorium outside Moscow where he is recovering
from a heart attack.
The Communist Party, cashing in on discontent with hardships under
Western-style reforms, looked set to win one-third of the places in the
450-seat Duma.
However election experts said the Communists could control 40% of seats if they
managed to form an alliance with other left-wing groups.
Communist and nationalist forces together should have more than half the seats.
This would give them a majority if they formed an unprecedented alliance,
although parliament is much less powerful than the presidency.
Despite a disappointing showing by reformists, Yeltsin said Russia would
``manage to follow the same political course as before'' and expressed
confidence that the new Duma would continue democratic processes.
Yeltsin assured German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by telephone that the new Duma
would conserve the ``mood for reform'' and that he would establish
``constructive co-operation'' with it.
However the reformist former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, who expects to have
no seat in the new Duma, said the Communists risked creating ``a real mess'' in
the run-up to June's presidential election.
To avoid splitting the liberal vote for the presidency, Gaidar said his
Russia's Choice party would probably bow out.
The delay in announcing results prompted cries of foul play from two likely
challengers for the presidency, retired general Alexander Lebed and former
vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, although Gaidar said he believed the vote was
by-and-large fair. Foreign election monitors said they had no evidence of
widespread fraud.
Like Gaidar, Rutskoi and Lebed's nationalist parties failed to win the 5% of
votes needed to win seats in the half of the Duma allocated by proportional
representation.
Adding to Yeltsin's problems, a battle raged today in breakaway Chechnya's
second city, Gudermes. Refugees fleeing the fighting said Russian forces had
subjected it to the worst shelling they had seen in the year-long war. 10
Russian soldiers were reported dead in street battles.-Reuter.

RUTHERFORD Manson Dowds, the rapidly expanding firm of Scottish accountants,
opened a new larger office in Glasgow yesterday, writes ANDREW MULLINS.
The premises in Blythswood Square are three times bigger than the old Glasgow
offices of the eight-year-old firm, which also has branches in Edinburgh,
Aberdeen and London.
It specialises in corporate finance, audits and accounts and takes an
aggressive approach to seeking out new business.
The firm has three partners and 24 other staff working in Glasgow, but
partner-in-charge Ian Steele said: ``We expect to double in size in the next 24
months.''
Rutherford Manson Dowds was founded in 1987 and expects to turnover #6m this
year.
The early years saw the partners eschewing existing large businesses to
concentrate on smaller companies with potential.
``We identified the David Murrays and Tom Farmers of tomorrow, and as they have
grown so have we,'' said founding partner Cahal Dowds.

TWO Labour MPs at the heart of last week's controversial Govan selection battle
face severe disciplinary action from the party for going off on holiday this
week and missing Tuesday night's crucial vote against the Government.
Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson last week narrowly defeated rival candidate
Councillor Mohammad Sarwar for the redrawn Govan seat. Mr Watson was strongly
supported in his campaign by neighbouring MP Ian Davidson, currently
representing the old constituency of that name but likely to contest the new
Pollok seat.
Neither Mr Watson, who is with his wife at an unknown holiday destination
abroad, nor Mr Davidson, who is in Sri Lanka with his wife and two children,
had prior permission to miss the crucial vote and will face the wrath of Chief
Whip Donald Dewar on their return.
London MP Brian Sedgemore also was absent, on a trip to Barbados, and what
rankles with the Whips is that the loss of these three votes cost Labour
victory on its own more critical motion. Fortunately for the three, they had
the consolation of the Government's motion falling by two votes.
Mr Watson, however, still must consider the party's national executive meeting
next month, at which there will be a demand for a rerun of the Govan contest.
One of Mr Watson's supporters in Govan, party activist Archie Graham, defended
him yesterday: ``Mike's voting record as an MP is second to none and I would be
absolutely amazed if Mike was somewhere and the whips could not get hold of
him.''
``I am assuming he advised them that he was going away for a few days for a
family holiday. If there has been any difficulty, I can only assume there has
been some sort of misunderstanding.''
``The man never had a family holiday in the summer because of all the stress
and strain and work that had to be done for the reselection battle. It was a
well-earned break.''
Critics from the rival Sarwar camp see it differently. Pollok party member
Stewart Daniels said he had begun as a Watson supporter but had changed to the
rival camp.
He said yesterday he would be writing to Mr Dewar expressing concern about time
off granted from Westminster for the selection campaign and the absences on
Tuesday night.
Two other Scottish MPs missed Tuesday night's vote but both had permission.
Pollok MP Jimmie Dunnachie was absent for health reasons and was paired with an
ill Tory MP, while Clydesdale MP Jimmy Hood attended a European engagement
accompanied by his Conservative counterpart.
One Labour MP said of Mr Davidson last night: ``It is inexplicable that a man
now relying on the goodwill of a Labour leadership seeking to end the year on a
triumph should have acted in this way.''
The SNP was quick to capitalise on events. ``If such an attitude is the best
that Labour can offer, then it simply underlines the need for change in Govan
and throughout Scotland,'' said the party's candidate in the constituency, Ms
Nicola Sturgeon.

SCOTLAND so far has received almost #125m in awards from the National Lottery,
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton announced yesterday,
(writes Stephen McGregor).
He emphasised that the awards had ranged from the very small to the very big,
and that many organisations had benefited ``beyond their wildest dreams.''
The Minister told the Commons: ``The successful projects have ranged from small
but very important grants - such as #600 given to Gallowhill Elderly Forum -
right up to the #23m towards Scotland's Field of Dreams at Hampden Park.
``Other awards have included the #3m announced for a new Edinburgh Festival
headquarters; #10.2m to purchase the Mar Lodge estate in the Cairngorms;
#710,000 awarded to the Glasgow Film Theatre; #3m to the Scottish Gallery of
Modern Art to purchase the Penrose Collection; #660,000 for Strathclyde Poverty
Alliance and #1.5m to Tayside Regional Council for a sports complex.''
Lord James said: ``Many people may still be waiting for their first personal
success with the lottery, but one thing is certain - Scotland as a nation is
winning.''

They were young, they were free. Now they're not but they're on
the road anyway.
Keith Bruce charts his band's charity efforts
THE story so far: Ten years after they were invented over a St Patrick's Day
pint in Jack McLean's favourite hostelry, Glasgow instrumental rock'n'roll
combo The Beat Poets acquire a conscience and release a charity single, Silent
Night, in aid of the Big Issue. Suddenly they are required to play in front of
people four nights in a row to promote it. Those ten years have not been kind .
. .
Thursday: Glasgow's Archaos Club. Student night. ``Why do they dress like
that?'' our cigar-chewing record company boss inquired of no-one in particular.
``Because they can,'' replied the guitarist in a moment of insight. The young
crowd dance enthusiastically but the Beat Poets then dissipate any popularity
they'd built up by electing to lug their gear across the crowded dancefloor.
Friday: Your diarist cannot remember playing Aberdeen's Lemon Tree, having
found it necessary to have a stiff drink after a white-knuckle ride to get
there. Chauffeur Caroline is an experienced rally driver, whose forest stages
career was brought to an end by a ``wee bump'', which left her sister in
hospital for six months. Ironically the band is late because of her inability
to start the van. After half an hour's anxiety, the guitarist had diagnosed the
problem. It was in gear.
Saturday: The Kaisers play a stormer of a set at Edinburgh's Music Box. The
Beat Poets are pleased to have got through theirs without any more disasters.
The first hint of trouble came when the Fife-based keyboard player turned up
with his Hammond organ in the back of a milk float. His car has died and he has
hired a second van. It is normally used by Lloyd the milk, as the side clearly
reads. It doesn't smell, but it's not very rock'n'roll.
The bass player gets call from home. His girlfriend has roused the neighbours
after lying on the floor of their flat for an hour unable to move. She's
trapped a nerve in her back and he goes off home to look after her immediately
after the gig.
As a dep. bass player is being contacted, it becomes clear that all is not well
in the other half of the engine room of the good ship Beat Poets. We watch
horrified as the drummer's left arm swells visibly until he resembles a
spinach-fuelled Popeye, only without the muscle-power. An infection in his
elbow is later diagnosed and treated with powerful antibiotics, but for now
every blow on that snare drum is agony.
Sunday: The road back from Newcastle at 3am stretches out in front of the
diseased sextet carrying equipment up the fire escape of the Riverside Club.
The drummer has his arm in a sling. The bassist looks confused. The keyboard
player is driving a milk float. The tenor saxophonist is chain-smoking Marlboro
and wondering why he, the owner of the second lightest instrument in the
line-up, is carrying all the heaviest equipment. The trumpet player is busy
oiling his valves.
Later the saxophonist cracks and lurches mad-eyed at the guitarist, armed only
with a crisp packet, wounding him on the top lip and ensuring that he will
never be able to play the trumpet. The trumpet player buys him a drink. The
promoter has added another band to the bill. His own. Their guitarist has a
vintage electric guitar which he destroys during his performance for no
apparent reason.
Monday: The men from Scottish Television are being very patient. They have two
hours to film a band in a Glasgow city centre church and concert venue. The
drummer has his arm in a sling. The bassist and guitarist are wearing dark
glasses, not to look cool but because their eyes would frighten young children.
The guitarist has a scar on his top lip. The trumpeter is late, having forsaken
this pantomime to play for Cannon &amp; Ball at the King's next door. Sound move.
n The Beat Poets can be seen, eventually, on Scottish Television's Don't Look
Down tonight at 7pm. They play Glasgow's Cottier tomorrow, if they're spared.

PRISONER George Beattie has been granted parole and is due to be released today.
Beattie, who has constantly protested his innocence since being convicted of
murdering typist Margaret McLaughlin at Carluke, Lanarkshire, in 1973, was
recalled to Edinburgh's Saughton Prison two months ago.
This is understood to have been as a result of an argument with his parole
officer over timing of meetings to fit in with his job as a bus driver.
The parole board met earlier this week and agreed to his immediate liberation
subject to satisfactory follow-up arrangements.
Beattie was first paroled in 1986 but was recalled to prison six years later
after admitting a breach of the peace at the office of his then social worker.
He was released in 1994 pending an appeal against his conviction but it was
refused and he went back to jail. In March this year, he was released on parole
amid intense media interest. To escape the attention Beattie moved to Slough,
where he took a job as a bus driver.
His supporters condemned his recall in October over what appeared to be a
simple argument between Beattie, who has a low IQ, and his parole officer, and
the manner in which Thames Valley police officers broke down the door of his
house in the middle of the night and arrested him.

IRRESPECTIVE of police claims that the so-called Operation Blade has proved a
resounding success deserving of repetition on a wider perspective, the whole
ill-advised media exercise seems to exhibit little understanding of the
delinquent mentality.
Far from being dissuaded by brash publicity, the ubiquitous psychopath is
awakened to the desirability of the knife as a means of unprovoked offence.
Criminal use of a blade has ever been, and ever will be, part of a vigorous and
competitive society.
That such unwelcome media publicity is counter-productive has plainly been
shown in the recent wanton murder of otherwise innocent victims. These outrages
may well have been prevented if a hitherto stable situation had simply been
left alone.

n A NEW study on HRT, hormone replacement therapy, has found an unexpected and
beneficial side-effect: it reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease by up to
40%. The study by the European Menopause Society and reported in the current
issue of GP, the doctor's magazine, suggested that the use of HRT could both
reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and delay its onset by up to 10 to 12
years. It also confirmed that HRT can prevent heart disease in up to half of
users while the risk of breast cancer increased only with long-term use, over
10 years. Meanwhile the use of HRT is well established for the control of
menopausal symptoms and the prevention of osteoporosis, or thinning of the
bones.
n HERBAL medicine, used since time immemorial, is one of the best known and
trusted of the alternative therapies. At its simplest it's a soothing cup of
herbal tea. But herbs can be used for a whole range of ailments, from chronic
fatigue syndrome to eating disorders. If you would like to find out more about
using herbs but don't know where to start, try The Women's Guide to Herbal
Medicine (Hamish Hamilton, #18.99), by Carol Rogers, a Glasgow author. It
explains how to use herbs safely in the home and under the guidance of a herbal
practitioner. A medical herbalist, Carol Rogers offers sensible nutritional and
lifestyle advice to complement herbal remedies and a whole section focuses on
health maintenance and the prevention of disease.
n SO you've had a heart attack and you want to avoid another. Then you should
read Heart Attack: How to Return to a Full, Healthy and Active Lifestyle
(HarperCollins, #6.99).
n WE are in the throes of a flu epidemic and this raises the question: how
effective is vaccination? Well, the results are encouraging. The latest
research from Britain, America, and the Netherlands shows that the flu vaccine
does offer considerable protection, particularly if it is an annual
vaccination. Deaths among the elderly can be reduced by as much as 40% and it
also reduces the number needing admittance to hospital by up to 60%.
n WHILE many of us view the approaching festive season with varying degrees of
dread and excitement, people who live or work with a problem drinker see it as
a time when their alcohol-dependent partner will be presented with even greater
temptations.
Now private alcohol counsellor and educationist Elspeth Harte offers the
following advice on How To Cope With Someone's Drinking.
``I am not anti-drink, but my experience as an addiction counsellor has shown
me that alcohol abuse has a knock-on effect, causing tremendous problems, not
just for the drinker but for their family, friends, and colleagues.
``This is particularly apparent in cases where someone who drinks too much
fails to acknowledge the fact and expects other people to fit in with their
behaviour.
``So you get wives altering the household routine, colleagues covering up at
work and so on.
``No-one should have to tie themselves in knots because of someone else's
drinking. It is possible to limit the damage.''

n AMONG the plethora of Christmas cards on offer are those supplied by the
Mouth and Foot Painting Artists. These highly original cards, which provide a
much needed life-line for handicapped people, offering them a chance to earn
money and some independence, was started back in 1956 by the painter Erich
Stegmann as a self-help co-operative. A polio victim, he grew up without the
use of his arms yet he built a highly successful career in Germany by painting
with a mouth-held brush. Today this international self-help co-operative
produces Christmas cards and calendars. One such painter is Glasgow artist
Edward Rainery, paralysed from the neck down due to a diving accident. He says
the Mouth and Foot Painting Association helped to make him an established
artist. Further information from the Mouth and Foot Painting Artists, 9

Stand by for a return to the traditional `January sales'. Elizabeth Buie
explains why it is the end of the line for pre-festive season price slashing
COUNTING today, there are only four shopping days left till Christmas.
Unfortunately, you're not likely to pick up a last-minute bargain for Great
Auntie Jeannie or your nearest and dearest before the 25th.
For, unlike last year, virtually no shops are having pre-Christmas sales.
Instead, it is back to the traditional Boxing Day queues outside the shop
doors, with eager customers poised at the starting blocks ready to pick up the
``monster'' bargain of a living-room suite knocked down to #200, or a cashmere
coat for a tenner.
The question is whether this return to the traditional sales pattern is a sign
that the retail industry is returning to health after the long malaise of the
recession.
Most analysts believe that the industry is actually retreating from the
discount culture that has infected it for the past few years and, in trade
jargon, is going back to ``trading prime'' with seasonal stock clearances.
In fact, last year's rash of pre-Christmas sales was the result of poor stock
management throughout the year and a sign of trading distress. By the time
Christmas was beckoning, shops had found themselves over-run with goods which
they needed to clear as quickly as possible.
This year, however, according to Richard Perks, senior retail analyst with
Verdict Research, retailers have not had the capital to build up a large stock
of goods - and therefore have not been under pressure to clear their shelves so
quickly. In the case of others, the bitter experience of the past few years has
taught better stock management. In fact, in the case of some retailers,
business has picked up to the extent that they have come close to running
short.
In addition, many retailers may have discovered that early sales last year
proved counterproductive - they found that customers were waiting till the last
minute before buying anything, and ultimately buying less.
This season's sales, when they do come, are likely to offer fewer items than
consumers have come to expect in the past, but still good value and in some
cases with bigger discounts, largely because of stores' more-disciplined stock
management.
The Burton Group is a classic case of a retail company which has completely
reversed its sales policy. It felt that customers had come to perceive its
goods as ``always on sale'' and therefore reverted from discounting goods most
of the time to offering what it terms as a ``first price, right price'' policy
combined with genuine stock-clearance seasonal sales. Last year the Burton
Group spent 33% of its time ``trading prime'' compared with 68% this year. The
strategy appears to have been successful. Profits before tax in 1994 were
#41.1m compared with #98.6m this year.
Others are beginning to follow suit, recognising that year-round sales pull the
sector down. Customers begin to think they are not being offered a genuine
sale, just a general lowering of prices, and are not attracted into the shops,
defeating the very purpose of discounting merchandise.
While supermarkets can engage in a price war on key lines, such as bananas or
baked beans, it is harder for clothing retailers. Most men buy black socks, and
most women have a range of ``Marks &amp; Sparks knickers'', but these are not items
that have to be bought at a particular time of year.
Dr Steve Burt, acting director of the Institute for Retail Studies at Stirling
University, explained: ``If you have a sale all the year round or for five
months of the year, customers do not feel the urgency of buying in the three
weeks before Christmas because they know that the same prices will be available
in the New Year or Easter or summer.''
The hard times experienced by so many consumers in the 1990s appear to have
influenced their shopping habits. This Christmas, shoppers on the whole appear
to be looking for more value for money than before. Perfume, music and videos,
as well as small electrical goods are proving the most popular gifts, although
at the higher end of the market, there are some reports of personal computers
being bought for Christmas.
``They are not going so much for high-ticket items, but lower prices and better
value for money. The 90s say two things: we have had a very prolonged
recession, and although there has been an upturn over the past two years, there
has not been a feel-good factor; and there was a demographic peak hitting the
80s, so that the people who were in their 20s in the 1980s are in their 30s in
the 1990s and do not have as much disposable income,'' said Mr Perks.
According to James May, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, the
recent upturn in sales has come as a great relief to many clothing retailers
whose profits were badly hit by a long hot summer followed by a mild autumn.
The weak pound appears to be encouraging tourists to come to Britain for their
Christmas shopping. And while the excesses in luxury gift spending of the 1980s
have virtually disappeared, some of Britain's larger cities are reporting the
arrival of a new breed of high-rolling spender - the new capitalists from the
former Eastern bloc.
``In London we have seen some very funny money coming in from places like
Russia with people buying large quantities of jewellery and clothing and paying
for it with fistfuls of dollar bills produced out of rather grubby suitcases,''
said Mr May.
``But that is a small tip of the retail trade. I don't get the impression that
there is a lot of ostentatious spending going on at the moment,'' he added.
Dr Burt said that it would not be until next month that we could really gauge
how good a Christmas this has been.
``I think retailers would like to return to the traditional pattern. Possibly
they will go back to heavier discounts and sales lasting a shorter period,'' he
said.
``Retailers are becoming more realistic and they are also trying to recover
sales figures and margins in particular. It is much more in their interest to
get back to standard pricing and sales, rather than an incremental drift
down,'' he said.
If the post-Christmas sales also produce the bigger price cuts that are being
predicted, it will also be good for consumers.

NATIONAL Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley yesterday launched a strong
defence of National Lottery watchdog Peter Davis and accused Labour of trying
to hound him out of office.
Answering an Opposition emergency question in the Commons, Mrs Bottomley said
there was no question of Mr Davis's honesty or integrity being in question over
his acceptance of free flights from GTech.
She also announced that Anne Rafferty QC will head the inquiry into bribery
claims by Virgin Atlantic chief Richard Branson against Guy Snowden, chief of
GTech, a stakeholder in lottery operator Camelot.
Shadow National Heritage Secretary Jack Cunningham forced Mrs Bottomley to the
despatch box to make a statement on the affair after her decision on Tuesday
that Mr Davis could keep his #84,000 a year job as Oflot director-general.
Dr Cunningham accused both Mr Davis and Mrs Bottomley of showing ``an abysmal
lack of judgment'' and called for a code of conduct for regulators of private
monopolies to avoid further controversies.
However, Mrs Bottomley rounded on him, insisting Labour's ``victimisation'' of
the regulator, whom it had ``pursued and hounded'', showed it was ``unfit now
or ever to govern''.
Mrs Bottomley said she had met Mr Davis on Tuesday to discuss the free flights
provided for him and his staff in the United States.
To Opposition jeers, she said: ``My confidence in the director-general remains.
There is no doubt about his integrity.''
The visits to the United States had taken place some months after Oflot had
awarded the main licence to Camelot.
``The director-general considered the issues raised with care, recorded them
thoroughly and made no attempt to hide them.''
The Minister continued: ``I have told the Director General that I do not think
that his acceptance of the flights was wise in the context of his role as
regulator of the lottery.''
Mrs Bottomley said it was inevitable that Mr Davis needed to ``work closely''
with Camelot.
``I have told him that this fact makes it the more important that he should
maintain a proper distance from the company and its constituent parts and to be
seen to do so, taking all steps to guard against any possible misunderstanding
of his actions.''

DANIEL Clark mistakenly attributes editorial in the New York Times Magazine to
copy produced by the British Tourist Authority (December 16).
We do work closely with many American travel writers to encourage them to write
about travel to Britain but we do not, or wish to, have editorial control. As
your readers will appreciate, independent advice from a journalist is
invaluable when planning a trip, as indeed is a contact for more information on
Scotland for the rest of the UK, such as BTA's popular information service in
New York.
I would like to reassure your readers that we at the BTA in the United States
see Scotland as a critical brand in the mix that is Britain. A new advertising
campaign in partnership with the Scottish Tourist Board kicks off in the spring
to encourage more Americans to visit Scotland.
Two press trips are already planned for early next year to bring more American
journalists to Scotland - concentrating not only on your cosmopolitan cities
and beautiful countryside but also focusing on Burns and the Charles Rennie
Mackintosh anniversary celebrations.
Rest assured, we will continue to work closely with the Scottish tourist
industry, and with a little bit of help from Hollywood, promote Scotland
throughout the USA.

MAJOR celebrations to mark the bicentenary of the death of Robert Burns will
take place in London and Scotland next year, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
told the Commons yesterday.
He said there would be a major event in London on January 31. There would be an
event in Scotland during the year, probably in the South-west.
Mr Forsyth's announcement came after Labour's Brian Donohoe (Cunninghame South)
made an appeal for funds for the celebrations, which he said were a
``shambles'' because of a lack of private sponsorship.
He called on the Scottish Office to make up the shortfall, but Mr Forsyth said
he could not give such a commitment.

I AM rather confused with reports on the economy, inflation, and tourism. As a
businessman, I find it very important that this information is correct so that
I can use it to gauge my performance and plan future strategies.
It has just been announced that tourism is on the up again by 9% in the latter
part of this year. This follows an announcement earlier that there had been a
16% increase in the first six months of 1995. However, like practically
everyone in the industry from hoteliers, shopkeepers, coach operators, and the
like, I disagree with these findings.
My latest venture, The Invernairn Mill Visitors Centre, which has only been
open a year, has no previous figures to compare with, other than these
statistics. As one of my sons remarked, using this information in our business
is like him using a Ford workshop manual to repair a Mercedes motor car.
I embarked on this venture because the Scottish Tourist Board insisted that
tourism was on the up year after year. Earlier this year, however, the new
chairman took over and announced that over the last five years tourism had
actually been on the decline, a welcome clarification of fact.
Good businesses are going under every day. More often than not it is not
through bad management or lack of effort. It is more likely to be things
outwith their control, such as ever-increasing rates and overpriced utilities,
all brought about to fund salaries of diabolical magnitude for top executives
incomprehensible to the ordinary working people, our customers, who find
themselves in an increasingly poor financial state with increasing lack of job
security being a major contributing factor.
If we as a nation are to survive, there has to be a massive change in the way
we think and do things. The establishment cannot keep biting the hand that
feeds it without dire consequences.
The business community supports the country but it would appear that no-one in
authority is hearing this. They are obliterating the workforces through
short-sightedness, self-centred monetary greed, which is projected towards
higher management with dire consequences for the working man struggling with
the machinations of politics with no reward.
I am of the firm belief that my views are widespread and that such policies are
having a devastating effect on people's lives.

CAMERATA Scotland is the new name adopted recently by the Chamber Orchestra of
the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, for reasons which will be entirely
obvious. They began on familiar ground with an elegant, well-judged reading of
Haydn's Symphony No 96 under conductor William Conway. The bright, nicely
burnished strings, crisply pointed woodwind, and a small but sharply focused
brass section were all impressive, as was the finely controlled sense of
structural awareness in the unfolding music.
The strings responded equally impressively when called upon to produce greater
breadth and depth of sound in Sibelius's ravishing Pelleas and Melisande Suite.
The music is in a very different vein to that of Debussy's better known work on
this theme, and Conway drew taut, richly expressive playing from his ensemble,
enhanced by three excellent woodwind soloists.
They began the second half with a contemporary work by the Edinburgh-based
composer Edward Harper. Fiddler of the Reels is a highly effective short work
for string orchestra, in which Harper teasingly inserts snatches of a
reel-derived figure into a rather darker musical language, then allows the folk
idiom to emerge in a colourful sunburst before extending the original process
in more complex fashion.
The ensemble absorbed its challenging rhythms with great assurance, and that
confidence carried over into Dvorak's Czech Suite, a work which is something of
a rarity on the concert stage. It may be a relatively minor work in his canon,
but it is a substantial and highly idiomatic one, and the orchestra, with wind
and brass restored, gave a sparkling, highly sympathetic account of it.

A RECENT Herald Opinion article proclaimed charities had become ``warped by
association'' with commercial sector values, used doubtful fundraising tactics,
and employed (an obviously unnecessary) ``professional cadre'' of staff.
Unhappily, this served to reaffirm that the word charity, in itself, has become
synonymous with old workhouse and do-gooder connotations that bode no further
elaboration.
After all, everyone knows what a charity is. Goodness knows, there are enough
of them - approximately 23,500 in Scotland with research suggesting another
1000 formed each year. However, despite being pretty good at promoting their
causes, charities seem to be poor at improving general understanding of their
role.
Charities began as voluntary institutions raising alms for the disadvantaged,
but persistent erosion of the welfare state has meant an increasing reliance on
their role; not just as cushioning, but as specialist service providers filling
growing health and social care gaps. Subsequently, many charities, particularly
the large national and international ones, have developed into sophisticated
organisations managing substantial revenues and resources as part of their day
to day ``business''.
This year the Scottish Council for Spastics will spend #18m on direct provision
of services to some 2000 children and adults with cerebral palsy and other
disabilities. The range of specialist services provided by the organisation -
including education, therapy, employment, residential and day care - requires
sustained financial planning and development. In many respects, therefore, the
Council, as with other large voluntary organisations, is like a commercial
business and has similar assets, cash-flow problems and regulations to meet. In
order to function competently and fulfil its contractual obligations it
requires structure, planning, job division and secure funding.
General misunderstanding of the term charity masks a plethora of business-like
principles and attitudes which must exist in voluntary organisations if they
are to effectively match resources to the needs of their clients. It must be
recognised there is a vast divide within the charitable sector and that
not-for-profit voluntary organisations and one-off fundraising causes are two
ends of an expanding spectrum. Nevertheless, every type of organisation within
this spectrum has to adhere to the same stringent regulations and fundraising
legalities. For voluntary organisations, public perception is also a dominant
concern and the slightest sniff of bad publicity can rock the whole sector in a
way few commercial groups experience.
To sustain their role, therefore, voluntary organisations must have a
responsible attitude which seeks to educate, influence, and elicit support
without causing supporters to be turned off. This is a fine line. However, it
is not our business to hide the injustices of the world or the many needs which
society at large cannot or will not pay for. There will always be an element of
guilt in charitable donation, but that is not to say that with fundraising
tactics the end always justifies the means.
Real life images of despair, need or triumph are frequently used because they
confront people to think and act. But integrity has a large part to play,
because many voluntary organisations are ultimately seeking to change the
attitudes or rules which have made their role necessary. The Scottish Council
for Spastics seeks to influence and change attitudes through a positive
portrayal of disabled people. We take this so seriously we are changing our
name to Capability Scotland in order to more effectively facilitate integration
of disabled people into society. In a way we are trying to do ourselves out of
a job although the likelihood of that, in the light of dwindling state aid, is
slim.
One obvious implication of the increasing number of charities is the struggle
to secure voluntary income from an overcrowded marketplace which has many other
competing attractions, such as the National Lottery, for consumer spending.
Some charities are fashionable or appealing by their very nature but so many
more have to plan in advance where voluntary income can be secured from. For
big, well- established voluntary organisations the standard fundraising tools
are no longer enough on their own. The Scottish Council for Spastics will be
looking at methods which serve several objectives; the current business
breakfast series, sponsored by Scottish Airports Ltd, is an example of an
income-generating activity which also enables us to communicate our aims and
foster closer links with the corporate sector.
We have to constantly adapt and develop to know our supporters and cultivate
means of keeping them loyal. To many people this will sound like good customer
services and it is; the voluntary sector has not been slow to learn or
innovate, yet this persistent incompatibility between ``doing good work'' and
efficient management persists.
How would the public and corporate sector wish to see an organisation such as
the Scottish Council for Spastics spend its #18m on service delivery? If we are
to fulfil our role we must do it efficiently and effectively.
Michelle Hegarty is press &amp; public relations officer for The Scottish Council
for Spastics (soon to be Capability Scotland).

MOVES to curb chequebook journalism, particularly payments to witnesses in
criminal cases, were promised by Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord
Wakeham last night.
The Tory former Cabinet Minister told the Lords in a debate on the issue that
he was proposing a new protocol to the self-regulatory code of practice for
newspapers and magazines.
His disclosure follows public concern over the payments made by newspapers for
the stories of witnesses in the trial of mass murderer Rosemary West.
Lord Wakeham said he had begun discussions with editors and proprietors of
newspapers and magazines to find a solution to the serious issue which his
proposed protocol aimed to address.
He stressed he could not guarantee he would be able to negotiate a satisfactory
agreement but declared he would have ``a determined attempt'' to achieve one.
The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, responding to the debate for the
Government, said he ``warmly welcomed'' the protocol that Lord Wakeham had
offered to negotiate with newspaper and magazine proprietors.
He said if Lord Wakeham's proposals could be made to work, then it was a
preferable way forward than by legislation, which would be ``difficult''.

WITHIN a fortnight of The Herald Foundation for Women's Health opening at the
Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, two cases of gynaecological cancer were detected. As
one nurse remarked: ``If we never detect another early case of cancer this year
the clinic has already justified its existence.''
Both women have already started treatment and are progressing satisfactorily.
Normally it would have taken several weeks, when symptoms would by then be more
obvious, for these patients to be diagnosed.
They would be logged for hospital visits then tests and treatment over a period
of months, often having to see a string of duty doctors in different locations.
Although cancer was not suspected by these patients' GPs, they did recognise
that each woman had a gynaecological problem.
Now, thanks to the innovative Herald Foundation Clinic for Women's Health,
women at risk undergo examination with the most advanced equipment and, if
necessary, receive a management-of-care plan in a single visit.
Referral to the clinic, which deals only with secondary investigations, must be
made through family doctors. Although it has been open for less than two
months, it is already fully booked, and there is a short waiting-list.
If the list should grow too long then an extra session will be added to cope
with the demand.
Response to the project is positive, with many women remarking on the
clinic's calming and visually pleasing atmosphere.
For the medical staff, the surroundings represent an amazing transformation
from their former use as a Victorian operating theatre. Paintings have been
loaned by a dozen Scottish artists, including Elizabeth Blackadder, June Carey
and Jacki Parry.
The decor, based on imaginative use of pastel colours and designed by Drew
Plunkett of Glasgow School of Art, has attracted comment. ``It's now a pleasure
to come to work,'' says one of the nurses.
In the majority of cases women need visit the clinic once only, hence the name
it has gained in medical circles - One-Stop clinic.
As Dr Helen McEwan, consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at the Royal
Infirmary, says, this is the whole purpose of the clinic - to reduce the number
of visits women have to make, and to ensure that those visits are carried out
speedily in comfortable surroundings. The Herald Clinic for Women's Health has
certainly fulfilled that remit.
While more than #50,000 has been raised through generous donations from Herald
readers, we are still some way short of the sum required to cover running costs
for an initial two-year period. Those wanting to make a special Christmas gift
to the clinic should send their donations to The Herald Foundation for Women's
Health, 195 Albion St, Glasgow G1 1QP. Those who wish to donate by covenant
should write to the same address for details, including the word Covenant on
the envelope.

<HEADLINE>Agreement reached in principle with Scottish farmers over the purchase of their holdings End in sight for British Coal tenants</HEADLINE>

THE year-long saga over the sale of British Coal's farms in Scotland is finally
drawing to a close. According to estate agent Bell Ingram: ``Agreement has now
been reached in principle with all 57 of British Coal's agricultural tenants in
Scotland over the purchase of their holdings.''
David Gwyther, the director of Bell Ingram who handled the sale, added: ``It's
been quite a long and complicated process with a number of difficult issues
needing to be resolved. In particular, the valuation of milk quotas, treatment
of tenants' improvements, and British Coal provisions on future windfall gains
and environmental liabilities have all caused concern to prospective purchasers.
``However, we are very pleased that all of these issues have been resolved and
that every one of the farm tenants in Scotland has opted to buy his or her
holding.''
However, not all the tenants are quite so happy with the deal they have been
offered, and several are seeking amendments to the conditions of sale.
Jimmy Wilson who farms at Lumphinnans, near Cowdenbeath, and who is also
president of Fife and Kinross NFU, commented: ``We may have accepted in
principle and agreed a price, but there are a number of conditions which
individual farmers wish to have altered. In my own case the boundaries are
ill-defined and I am waiting to see the title deeds.
``I also have a neighbour where British Coal wants to retain the shooting and
fishing rights for 99 years at #1 per year.''
Other conditions include the proviso that the land should only be used for
farming purposes. Mr Wilson said he could understand British Coal wanting to
prevent anyone becoming involved in mining operations, but he felt that if
taken to its logical conclusion this would preclude letting holiday houses,
running a contracting business or taking horses at livery. No diversification
is permitted for a period of 20 years.
Mr Wilson remarked: ``It's belt and braces and just altogether too much.''
Originally British Coal, at the instigation of the President of the Board of
Trade, Michael Heseltine, planned to sell the farms in one lot believing this
would be the best and quickest course of action.
However, the tenants were outraged at not having the opportunity to bid for
their farms. An action committee was formed, questions were asked in the House
of Commons, most notably by the Labour MP Martin O'Neill, and the NFU was
called in to champion the cause.
Under pressure, British Coal relented and agreed to talk with the tenants, but
it soon became clear that the valuations of the respective parties were miles
apart, with the farmers arguing they were entitled to a near-50% discount on
open market value. This view was supported by independent experts and bankers.
Similarly, there were difficulties surrounding future pollution problems from
abandoned underground workings. The tenants took the line that British Coal
should remain liable.
If the tenants and British Coal can thrash out their remaining differences the
various deals should be signed and sealed by December 31, with payment for the
farms made a month later.
In England negotiations are still proceeding between British Coal and farmers.

<HEADLINE>Assault claim in `right to die' case. Lack of emergency means doctors require consent to continue feeding, says lawyer</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE McKAIN, Law Correspondent</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

DOCTORS may be breaking the law by keeping the patient in the ``right to die''
case alive by artificial means, it was argued yesterday.
The present treatment provided for 52-year-old Mrs Janet Johnstone, food and
liquid through a naso-gastric tube, could amount to an assault, Ms Lynda Clark
QC, counsel for Law Hospital NHS Trust claimed.
This was because the patient, who has been in a deep coma for nearly four
years, cannot give consent to what is happening, there is no longer any
emergency justifying the treatment and no hope of recovery.
Ms Clark also argued that doctors would be acting lawfully if they withdrew her
treatment.
In the first case of its kind in Scotland, the trust has gone to the Court of
Session to ask Lord Cameron to declare that it can discontinue the artificial
feeding which is keeping Mrs Johnstone alive, without the risk of prosecution
for murder or culpable homicide.
The judge has been told that if the feeding tube was withdrawn, as doctors
propose, she would die of dehydration, possibly within 10-14 days.
Mrs Johnstone's relatives agree with the hospital and say that it would be
kinder to let her die peacefully and with dignity than keep her in her present
condition when there is no hope of recovery.
The action is being defended by the Lord Advocate, in the public interest, and
a guardian appointed by the court to represent Mrs Johnstone.
Ms Clark submitted that the underlying legal principles governing medical
intervention were relatively simple.
In the case of a rational adult, treatment, even to save a life, was lawful
only if the patient consented. However, in emergencies, treatment was justified
without consent because of necessity and in the best interests of the patient.
For example, if a patient was brought in unconscious with a heart attack, that
could be treated. But if doctors found a lump which they thought might be
malignant they could not operate to remove it unless it was immediately
life-threatening. They would have to wait until the patient became conscious
and consented to an operation.
In Mrs Johnstone's case there had been an emergency when she became unconscious
after being admitted with a drugs overdose. Doctors were justified in
continuing to treat her in until she was diagnosed by several experts as being
in a persistent vegetative state with no hope of recovery.
At that point doctors took the view that it was no longer in her best interests
to receive treatment, including artificial feeding, which was doing her no
good, although it was prolonging her life.
This threw into question the whole legality of continuing to feed Mrs
Johnstone, of Allanton, in Lanarkshire, artifically.
The question was, what was the legal justification for this? Ms Clark added:
``In my submission there is none in law. So, technically, it could be regarded
as an assault on Mrs Johnstone.''
Putting a tube down her throat was saved from being an assault initially
because of the emergency and because it was in the patient's best interests
when there was some hope of recovery. That was no longer the situation.
Ms Clark said her basic proposition was that, if treatment was not necessary in
the best interests of the patient, it must be lawful to stop it.
The question was not whether it was in the best interests of Mrs Johnstone to
die but whether it was in her best interests to have her life artifically
prolonged.
She went on to discuss the House of Lords case involving Tony Bland, who was
also in a persistent vegetative state following the Hillsborough football
disaster.
In that case the judges had ruled there was no absolute obligation on doctors
to prolong a patient's life regardless of the circumstances.
Ms Clark said, ``If the justification for intervening with a patient who lacks
the capacity to to consent lies in the fact that the treatment is provided in
his best interests, it must follow that treatment may and ultimately should be
discontinued where it is no longer in the patient's best interest to provide
it.''
The hearing continues.

TAKE a measure of whisky, add a dash of incomprehension, then enrich with a
taste of Chicago - and you have the mix for an innovative way of marketing a
new building. Even although there is little to be seen but the scaffolding, the
canny Co-op is attracting interest for its redevelopment of No9 George Square -
where 65,000 sq.ft of new office space is being created behind the
``Chicagoesque'' retained facades overlooking the square and South Hanover
Street.
Its prominent site attracted a whisky firm whose advertising campaign plays on
braw Scots phrases like ``ilka dram a ferlie'' and ``unco sonsie''. Using the
scaffolding at No.9 as the backdrop, the first of the TV ads features a baffled
young man in a George Square phone box who is calling his granny to ask what
``unco sonsie'' means.
Bill Colville of letting agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe pulled off this free TV
marketing coup and claims that the completed project will be equally sonsie.
``The building has an enviable location - a factor which has led to requests
from organisations interested in using it as a focus for events. I was a bit
bemused when we were first approached for the TV advert, however, the filming
went smoothly and it's good to see the finished result on TV.''
Although filming requirements can be complicated, Colville reckons that letting
agents should seize any such opportunities of pushing their clients' buildings
into the limelight - or the TV screens of the nation. ``You have to consider
insurance as well as the possible delays to construction work - and you have to
get agreement from all parties involved. But if everything goes well it can
increase the profile of a scheme, which can't be a bad thing,'' he says.
Using photographs taken during the original film shoot, Colville carried his
marketing campaign a step further by organising a photo caption competition for
city agents - the people most likely to find tenants for the building. The
winner was the kenspeckle David Griffin of Griffin Webster partnership who came
up with the sleekit, but topical, caption: ``All this to avoid empty rates!'' -
which won him a 4.5-litre bottle of the hard stuff.

IT WAS the kind of last day before the Christmas hols of which King Herod or
the unreformed Scrooge would have thoroughly approved.
Government whips were hunting down rebels, Labour its non-attenders who had
fled to distant parts like Barbados, Sri Lanka and a cottage in rural Ireland,
while Mr Mike Watson (Glasgow Central) had fled so efficiently that nobody knew
where he was. Both whips' offices are likely to give those concerned a horrible
1996.
As purely Scottish committees take over examination of more Scottish
legislation, the Tory whips have lost much of what used to be the dreaded
punishment of sentencing an awkward English Tory to service on a Scottish Bill
committee. A couple of months on, say, the Sewerage (Scotland) Bill committee
could break the proudest spirit.
Mr Michael Forsyth, Scottish Secretary, got nearest to being Christmassy,
promising the Scottish Opposition that some of them might receive invitations
to a grand bash he's having next month in honour of the bicentenary of the
national bard. Mr George Robertson made clear he would rather have a General
Election.
When the Rev. Martin Smyth from the Ulster Unionist bench suggested closer
co-operation in promoting tourism between Northern Ireland and Scotland Mr
Forsyth agreed, adding: ``We Unionists must stick together on this and other
matters.'' Ministers will doubtless be asking Santa if he can deliver them
Ulster Unionist votes in 1996.
The Opposition took off in full cry after the lottery watchdog, Mr Peter Davis,
rather in the style of wolves pursuing a sledge. The lovely Virginia must have
been sorely tempted to throw Mr Davis to them, the traditional Russian device
for preserving at least some of those on board. But, no. Virginia, looking ever
more like a former head girl at Enid Blyton's immortal Mallory Towers, kept Mr
Davis on board.
She did also carefully get it on the record that Mr Davis had assured her that
there were no skeletons in his cupboard and that she had advised him to
``maintain a proper distance'' from Camelot and its constituent parts.
In the eyes of her back benchers, a small halo appeared to encircle her golden
head and the chaps decided to gallantly ride to the rescue. ``Gutter
politics'', ``McCarthyite smears'' and other Yuletide greetings were lobbed at
the Labour benches who continued to decline to put a charitable construction on
Mr Davis's activities. Virginia's suggestion that he had saved the taxpayers'
money by not hiring a private jet for his tour of US state lotteries produced
only derision.
Even the Speaker, most charitable of ladies, insulted the Scottish Labour
Opposition for Christmas. Temporarily forgetting Ms Rachel Squire's name when
the Dunfermline West MP rose to ask a question, Ms Boothroyd said: ``I mean the
pretty one.'' Mr John Maxton (Cathart), Mr George Foulkes (Carrick) and others
sitting immediately adjacent to Ms Squire looked hurt.
The Leader of the House, Mr Tony Newton, announcing the business for the first
week back in the new year, said pathetically that no-one had wished him a merry
Christmas. ``I do,'' said Madam Speaker kindly. So does the Sketch to its
readers.

CRANBERRY sauce, the traditional accompaniment for turkey, may be a special
topic of discussion over the dinner table in some farm circles this year
following a visit to the US under the aegis of the Scottish Agricultural
Organisation Society - the umbrella organisation for farm co-operatives.
The fish farming co-op Scot Trout recently completed a study trip to the Ocean
Spray Cranberry co-operative in Massachusetts and returned with more
information than most of us would appreciate on the history of the cranberry.
The North American Indians, for instance, mixed the berries with dried deer
meat and melted fat. The resulting concoction was used to poultice arrow wounds.
The Scottish visitors were more interested in modern applications and were
particularly keen to study marketing methods under a co-operative system. ``We
were looking for a co-operative whose members, like those of Scot Trout, are
totally dependent on the co-op for the sale of their entire farm output,'' said
James Graham, SAOS project director. ``We also wanted a co-operative which was
strong on value adding, operated in an international market, had strong brand
development, and was significantly more developed than Scot Trout.
``We couldn't find a co-operative with all these features in the UK so we went
to Ocean Spray which fitted the profile well.'' Ocean Spray was founded 50
years ago, has a membership of 750 cranberry growers and 150 grapefruit
growers. It generates annual sales of more than $1200m and enters the list of
America's top 500 industrial corporations as number 332.
The visit highlighted several issues related to developing and managing a
strong co-operative structure.
``The massive investment made to create and then protect the Ocean Spray brand
was impressive,'' said Mr Graham.
``At Scot Trout we don't have sufficient profit margin to allow us to go to
that level of branding. Our market place is also different. Major manufacturers
drive the US food sector, while in Britain we are much more in the hands of the
major retail multiples.''
The Scot Trout delegation also noted the level of profits retained by Ocean
Spray every year to finance re-investment and development. ``In our system we
tend to return profits to members each year - maybe we should adopt the Ocean
Spray approach and seek to build stronger businesses which will then be of
greater value to members,'' said Mr Graham.
When the Scots met some of the grower members they found real commitment to the
co-operative ideal. ``They knew they could often sell their crops for more
immediate cash than they would get from Ocean Spray, but they appreciated the
security of having a long-term market into which they could sell.

FIRST, England's coach broke down. Then the wheels came off on the field as
another set of students made Mike Atherton's team look in need of extra tuition
before next week's fourth Test.
A year ago, it was the kids from Australia's Cricket Academy who caused great
embarrassment with two wins in as many days over the Ashes tourists. Now, the
South African Students XI recovered from a perilous 23 for five to reach 253
for six when bad light ended play an hour early.
Mark Ilott struck four times inside seven new-ball overs. But Nic Pothas, a
23-year-old from the Rand Afrikaans University in Johannesburg, hit a maiden
first-class century and finished unbeaten on 141, with a 6 plus eighteen 4s. He
received fine support from Mark Davis (44) and spinner Nicky Boje (42 not out)
in rescuing an apparently wrecked innings.
England's day began badly when their coach ground to a halt between Durban and
Pietermaritzburg because of a fuel blockage. A substitute vehicle arrived but
start of play had to be put back half-an-hour.
In addition, Jason Gallian, having arrived in South Africa the previous day
following his call-up from Pakistan, slipped and fell on his back when bowling.
Later, the Lancashire opener suffered a dislocated left little finger while
trying to intercept a Pothas cover drive. Physio Wayne Morton quickly repaired
the damage, Gallian returned to the fray, and should be able to bat without
difficulty today.

A HOSPITAL for frail elderly patients in Cumbernauld is to be built in
partnership with the Scotcare group through the Private Finance Initiative,
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth announced yesterday.
The #3m hospital will have 40 beds in single rooms for continuing care
patients, and 30 day hospital places offering chiropody, physiotherapy,
occupational therapy and other services. It is expected to open early in 1997.
The patients at the new hospital will receive consultant-led care through the
Lanarkshire Healthcare NHS Trust.
Scotcare, which claims to be Scotland's largest provider of independent health
care, already operates eight homes, including a specialist Alcohol Related
Dementia Unit and the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit near Newmains.

yourself'', around the streets by two mad woodsmen clutching ferocious axes.
Imagine carrying your truncated tree and having that lot flee past you. It's
bound to cause a few pangs in the hearts of those who haven't been
environmentally conscious enough to purchase a living, potted tree.
The Nervous Forest is a typical example of the ``public subversion with a smile
on its face'' ethos of Ian Smith, the man behind the inspired lunacy of
performance group Mischief le Bas who have been popping up at various events
around Scotland, from outdoor festivals to nightclubs, for the past three years.
They've been entertaining Glaswegian shoppers since the end of November as part
of the city's Shine On Christmas festivities. The Nervous Forest is just one of
Smith's creations: each day three separate teams of Mischief le Bas performers
do a pick'n'mix of eight manifestations.
So, if you've stepped out of Marks'n'Sparks to be confronted by a gang of Elvis
lookalikes, industriously cleaning the streets, had to dodge past some
suspicious looking aliens, merrily doing their Christmas shopping or teetered
along the streets laden with purchases only to pass a group of ``Dizzy
Shoppers'' staggering under a more impressive 8ft-high pile of packages, now
you know what it's all about.
Glasgow streets have been echoing to the cries of ``Eh, what's that?'' as
Mischief le Bas have spread their very particular brand of merry mayhem. Three
slightly dim kings with two camels in tow have been meandering around town and,
while miserably failing in their task to find the nativity star, they did at
least manage to discover baby Jesus - ie, the replacement statue for the one
stolen from the manger in George Square by some particularly perverse thieves a
few weeks ago.
Some Snow Angels have also been drifting around, eagerly awaiting the
consignment of a case of rather splendid spray snow to Smith's long time
supplier, joke shop proprietor Tam Shepherd. ``Tam has assured me that this
spray shoots 24ft in the air,'' says Smith enthusiastically. ``Angels are
usually an image of hope and purity but ours are yobs.''
More civilised are a group of Van Goghs, who are colourfully togged out in
dungarees and straw hats and carry easels and sunflowers. They were originally
conceived by Smith as part of Mischief le Bas residency entertainment programme
for the Scottish Claymores, the American football team based at Murrayfield.
The Van Goghs showed up to make a visiting team from Amsterdam feel at home.
They speak with the standardised MTV presenter European accent which fits all
Mischief le Bas foreign incarnations such as the mayor and mayoress of
Luxembourg and the irascible tattoo-faced food-bearing Nomads. At Murrayfield
the Van Goghs mingled with the crowd, carved Edam cheeses and made occasional
frenetic dashes over the barricade on to the pitch, thus incurring the wrath of
the chief security inspector.
``He got most upset and told us to put the knives away, stop eating cheese and
stop jumping over the barricades,'' grins Smith. ``I kept shouting in our bad
Euro accent, `So sorry, ve do not understand, ve have only one ear' and he just
kept repeating the same thing, only more slowly and louder until I shouted `Eet
ees okay Meester, ve are from Dennistoun.' He went ballistic.''
Mischief le Bas's presence in the city centre has been stepped up from last
year's input to the Shine On festival. Then, they raced around dressed up as
stars and entertained people on the tube, building a ``rapport'' with the
underground staff which resulted in many severe tannoy messages instructing
them to stop lying down on the platform.
That kind of interaction is crucial to Smith's artistic vision. ``Every
manifestation we do interacts with the public,'' he points out. ``What works
for us is the humour in it, if it was too chi-chi then Glaswegians wouldn't
have it, they would think we were showing off.''
While many of the costumes can seem surreal they're certainly not as
off-putting as more pretentious street performers like the Peds, the cult of
black costumed faceless droids who wander the streets of New York and Los
Angeles. While the Peds stride silently, the Mischief le Bas group will
invariably be raucous and giggling.
``When people see us at first they can be a bit freaked out and think we're
weird, but then when, for example, a Dizzy Shopper turns and says `Oh, my feet
are killing me' it always gets a laugh. It's accessible though not puerile. I
mean it's not just people walking down the streets in funny costumes, there's
more to it than that.''
``Mischief le Bas are the best at what they do and have been getting a
fantastic reaction,'' says Neil Butler, artistic director of Shine On. ``No-one
else is doing what Ian is doing. Who else can you phone up and say I want some
camels on the street? I think the fact that it's a strange experience but
obviously so good humoured is essential to its success.
``Ian has an oblique angle of looking at things but you get what he's about.
He's great at dislocating people's sense of reality. The other good thing is
that he's working with lots of people, getting them involved in performing and
really enjoying themselves.''
Smith's ``mini industry of weirdness'' is composed of a growing band of friends
of friends, and only about 10% of those who take to the streets have had
previous performance experience. ``There are no rehearsals, just briefings when
the peformers are given a few catch phrases and a demeanour. They get a 65p
laundry bag containing their costumes which are designed by myself and Rachel
Mimiec, who has callouses on her fingers from running up camel costumes. I'm
always out there with them, keeping it all on beam, but there's a lot of
freedom.''
That element of spontaneity is essential to the effervescent energy of the
company. ``We're always trying out something new,'' says Smith. ``It's about
everyone getting jollies out of it.''
All the same, alongside the fun and hilarity, the mischief makers are prepared
to suffer for their art. Office hours weirdness is arduous work. ``We're
starting to suffer from physical fatigue,'' says Smith. ``We can even identify
certain aches and pains, such as Camel Back and Dizzy Shoppers' collar bone.''
Putting a shine on Glasgow sure requires plenty of elbow grease.

SUSAN MITCHELL, 28, a mother of three, was yesterday found guilty of causing a
drunken death smash which also left her boyfriend a virtual vegetable.
Mitchell, of Bruce Avenue, Dingwall, had denied causing the death of passenger
Ronald MacDonald, 34, of Strathpeffer, by careless driving while unfit through
drink.
She had also denied injuring another passenger, her boyfriend, insurance
representative Kevin Dennison, 30, who, the court heard, can now move only his
eyes. A third male passenger was slightly injured.
She was found guilty by a jury after a three-day trial.
Sheriff James Fraser deferred sentence on Mrs Mitchell until January 8 for
background reports.
Fiscal Ron Phillips likened the road tragedy to a festive season TV campaign
against drinking and driving, only this time ``nobody was acting''.

LIVESTOCK producers should brace themselves for a further rise in compound feed
prices, warns Chris Rackham, Bibby's director of raw materials.
The principal reason for the rise in raw material prices is increased demand
from Asian countries for feed materials and the disastrous US maize and cereal
harvests.
``Customers have been protected from the full impact of these price rises so
far,'' said Mr Rackham. ``However, it is impossible for compounders to absorb
the full cost of these increases as stocks of cheaper raw materials run out.
``Feed prices look set to rise by more than #20 a tonne as the full impact of
the most volatile and bullish market seen for several years is felt.''
Lean lamb
THE market for Scottish lamb in France will continue to grow, says leading
importer Claude Thieblemont. He warns, however, that overfat lamb is not
required at any price - and too many British lambs are failing to meet the
specification. He told an audience at Thainstone, Inverurie, that France was
only 47% self-sufficient in lamb, importing 165,000 tonnes a year to bridge the
gap.
Pig plan
PIG farmers should be alert to the need to plan ahead and keep their breeding
herd at full capacity, says Tim Bramley, North of England business development
manager with PIC. Postponement of replacement by one month on a typical 400-sow
farrow-to-finish unit could reduce annual output by 188 pigs a year, cutting
profit by #4500, he said.

FIFE Flyers last night confirmed the signing of rugged Canadian forward Kevin
St Jacques.
The player, drafted by National Hockey League side Chicago, then loaned to
their farm team, Indianapolis, joins Scotland's only Premier Division club in
the New Year. Player-coach Mark Morrison confirmed the Kirkcaldy-based club had
applied for a work permit for the robust player, who is a prolific marksman and
also a big penalty taker.
Morrison said: ``We've heard great reports about Kevin and we don't anticipate
any hitches with his work permit.''
St Jacques led the scoring charts in the Western Hockey League in 1991-92
season with 140 points for Lethbridge and Morrison added: ``That level of
scoring would do us fine.''

Stephen McGinty reports how airlines around the world are cracking down on
rowdy or dangerous passengers - which can mean securing them to their seats
FEW airline passengers have fallen so low by flying so high. But the behaviour
of drunken British and Irish tourists on the Northwest Airlines flight to
America this week has brought the dangers facing cabin crews and passengers out
from behind a cloud of jurisdictional boundaries. One member of the party, made
up of three families, came down to earth with a bang.
Michael Purcell, aged 25, was remanded in custody in America on charges of
assaulting and intimidating a crew member and flight attendant.
The dangerous antics of the drunken group were only tamed when a team of
American Olympic wrestlers grappled with them and handcuffed them to their
seats.
This was only the most recent incident in a series of in-flight assaults which
has prompted British Airways to head a worldwide crackdown on drunken and
violent passengers.
These incidents include:
n September 1995, when a Uruguayan businessman was sentenced to 14 days in
prison for a drunken mid-air assault on a BA steward on a flight from Brazil to
Heathrow Airport.
n Northwest Airlines had a case earlier this year of a Washington talk-show
hostess assaulting a flight attendant who tried to stop her using a laptop
computer while landing.
n In 1994 an eight-year-old boy was indecently assaulted on an Air Canada
flight to London. A doctor molested an 11-year-old girl on a flight from
Minneapolis to Gatwick.
The increase in airborne anti-social behaviour has resulted in British Airways,
British Midland and other major airlines within the past year equipping cabin
crews with handcuffs.
The handcuffs are supplied by an English company called Quik Kuff, who also
provide staff training in the use of their equipment. British Airways began
training on this new restraint kit in May this year.
Previously, airline cabin crews were trained in methods of calming aggressive
passengers but they were not provided with such equipment. Now the use of
handcuffs is part of both initial and recurrent training for all cabin crews.
British Airways are reluctant to discuss such procedures, and a spokesman said
only: ``We have every confidence that our cabin crews can deal with any
incident and ensure the safety of the majority of passengers.''
In America, carrying handcuffs on board planes is mandatory under federal law.
Iain Burns, of American Airlines, said: ``It's simply to secure troublesome
passengers to their seats, and it is exceptionally pleasing to their fellow
passengers.''
Sarah Prew, editor of the newsletter Cabin Safety Update, available on
subscription to British cabin staff, said: ``Training in Britain on how to
restrain a passenger is not a recent introduction, but the actual kits are. The
cabin crew are trained how to protect themselves and use restraints.''
Ms Prew explained that such behaviour is usually a result of drunkenness but
other incidents have occurred among people with poor mental health and those
who have been deported, after their police minder has left the plane.
Ms Prew added: ``The decision to handcuff a passenger is made by the cabin crew
member who is dealing with the passenger at the time. The responsibility also
lies with the chief cabin crew member or services director who will be informed
and may try to talk the passenger out of his behaviour, as may the captain.''
The final decision on whether to turn back or land at the nearest airport is
made by the captain, and only when it has become apparent that the behaviour of
a passenger could compromise the safety and integrity of the aircraft and other
passengers.
Mr Chris Dark, general secretary of BALPA, the British Airline Pilots
Association, said: ``BALPA takes this very seriously because it's our members
who will have to take the decision to restrain a passenger. In the UK we have
got to emphasise that such behaviour is unacceptable in what is a very safe
form of transport.''
Jurisdiction in airspace remains a problem. It was decided at the recent
convention in Tokyo that responsibility for passenger offences should be taken
at the country of arrival. However, a number of nations refuse to allow a
troublesome passenger into the country.
``This forces the offender back on to the aircraft which is, of course, the
last thing we want,'' said Mr Dark. ``Alternatively, some countries have a
sin-bin, a locked room where drunken passengers can sober up before being
returned home.''
In the opinion of the Transport and General Workers Union, who represent cabin
crews, the problem of violent passengers is increasing. A spokesperson said:
``This is becoming an increasing problem for our cabin crew members. The
problem is that there are jurisdictional boundaries - who is responsible?
``Plus some companies are reluctant to pursue the matter for fear of losing
that person as a customer and also bringing on bad publicity. Even today a lot
of our cabin crew suffer sexual abuse and innuendoes.''
The union also highlighted the problems of consuming alcohol at altitude. At
45,000 feet the blood thins and any alcohol consumed will have a greater effect
than if consumed on the ground.
The ability of passengers to bring large bottles of spirits onboard has been
discussed, with some aviation bodies suggesting that the purchase of duty-free
be restricted until passengers return home. However, no such plans are in the
pipeline.
Asked if any aircraft has a padded cell in the cargo hold, Sarah Prew replied:
``Not yet!''

FOUR heritage projects across Scotland benefited from funds raised by the
National Lottery when the Heritage Lottery Fund announced its sixth award of
grants yesterday.
The fund gave 34 awards throughout Britain for land, buildings, museums, and
galleries, with Scotland receiving #312,119 out of the #25m awarded.
In Perthshire, Historic Scotland was awarded #250,000 to help with the purchase
of Stanley Mills on the banks of the River Tay. The 18th century mill was one
of Scotland's pioneering group of water-powered cotton mills.
The first stage of the project will begin in the new year, and the fund has
indicated it may award further grants to help in the resoration of the mills.
The Shetland island of Fetlar received #20,619 towards the extension of the
Fetlar Interpretive Centre; a museum, visitor centre, and tourist information
point. The extension will provide additional display space for the museum's
collection, which includes photographs and film of folklore and local history.
In Argyll, the Strachur Smiddy Museum received #12,500 towards restoring an
18th century smiddy to its original state.
Stranraer Museum received #29,000 which will go towards an extension providing
additional gallery space as well as renovation of the facade of the museum,
which is housed in the Old Town Hall.
.q.The National Gallery in London has been given #8m from lottery funds to help
buy a painting by George Seurat, The Channel of Gravelines, from a German
collector.

DEPUTY Prime Minister Michael Heseltine challenged Tory rebels MPs who
contributed to the Government's defeat on European fisheries policy to realise
that they could end up installing the Labour Party in power.
It emerged that the Government could have won Tuesday night's vote, instead of
losing by two, if two Tory MPs had not made the mistake of thinking that voting
started at 10pm instead of 7pm and arrived three hours too late.
Their votes would have made it a tie, with the Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd,
procedurally bound to vote with the Government.
As Labour whips sought to track down MPs who missed the vote without
permission, the Tory whips' office refused to name the late arrivals, but the
two Tories were identified later as Sir Michael Spicer (South Worcestershire)
and Sir Michael Marshall (Arundel).
Mr Heseltine warned the rebels that they ``have got to face up to a very simple
question: are they trying to replace this Conservative Government with a Labour
government which will, in the simplest of their own terms, abandon all the
safeguards John Major has secured in Europe.''
In a BBC Radio interview, he suggested that local Tory parties should ask the
rebel MPs what they were up to.
Labour leader Tony Blair said yesterday: ``The Government is obviously in
disarray and the real problem is there's no sense of purpose or direction in
the Government any more. The sooner their misery is brought to an end, the
better for the country.''
In the Commons, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, said the fishing talks
which open in Brussels today might go on until Christmas Eve as Fishing
Minister Tony Baldry fights to get a good settlement for Scottish and UK
fishermen.
However, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said the Government had
lost the confidence of the nation as it had lost the confidence of the House of
Commons on fishing and should now call a General Election.
SNP leader Alex Salmond taunted Mr Forsyth for attending the last fisheries
council meeting ``playing second fiddle to the English fisheries Minister and
not saying a word.''
Meanwhile, it emerged that Tory Euro-sceptics will be rebuffed today in the
fisheries row when Ministers make clear Britain has no intention of abandoning
the European Union's common fisheries policy (CFP).
Three Ministers are due in Brussels to negotiate for Britain on annual totals
for fish catches and national quotas for next year against the background of
Opposition attacks and Tory Euro-sceptic criticism of British fishing policy.
A British official said yesterday that the Ministers would negotiate on the
basis of reaching a balance between scientifically-argued calls for cuts in
catches and the fishing industry's genuine needs.
After the Government defeat, officials are making it clear they will not give
in to rebel Tory demands for a unilateral abandonment of CFP.
The subject is unlikely to be raised at next year's inter-government conference
to review the Maastricht treaty. Britain has made no attempt so far to have
fisheries added to the already-agreed agenda which would be the only
opportunity to raise fishing policy in the EU.
Ministers take the view that to ditch the CFP, as demanded by Euro-sceptics and
some fishermen, would be impossible because such action would involve launching
complicated bilateral negotiations with all other EU member states.
The result would be to return privileged access to British inshore fisheries
for foreigners as existed when the UK had a 200-mile limit.
In short, Ministers believe the Euro-sceptics' demand for renouncing CFP and
restoring the 200-mile limit is nonsensical.
The UK negotiating team led by Mr Baldry also will include Scottish fisheries
Minister Raymond Robertson and Northern Ireland's Baroness Denton.
They will be negotiating proposals for major cuts in catches of
domestically-popular fish stocks in the North Sea including plaice and haddock
and slightly less dramatic reductions in catches in fishing grounds off the
west coast.
A British official sought to calm fishermen's doubts yesterday when he insisted
that British boats would not land fewer fish from the Irish Box which is due to
disappear on Hogmanay as a formally recognised conservation zone. The box
surrounds Ireland and includes rich fish resources to which the Spanish will
have new but limited access from next month.
An official said: ``The Spanish will have access to more waters but not to more
quotas. There will be no less fish for the UK and no more fish for Spain.''
Meanwhile, the Government will support Irish moves at today's council of
fisheries ministers in Brussels to debate the crisis in the fish farming
industry. Scotland has 5000 jobs dependent on fish farming and the Irish have
about 2000.

HOUSING groups and councils yesterday attacked the Government over major
cutbacks in housing expenditure in Scotland first revealed when the share-out
of the Scottish spending block was announced.
They were reacting to an upbeat Government statement on capital spending which
said local authorities should be able to invest about #350m in their council
housing next year and more than #1bn in the next three years.
Shelter Scotland said this actually meant a cut of #400m in direct investment
in housing over the period. It claimed that the size of the cutback was
equivalent to the cost of building 9000 new homes.
Of the allocations total, #240m is projected to come from capital receipts
mainly from council house sales, and the rest is consent to borrow. For the
first time, the Government has ordered councils to use 25% of the cash received
from receipts to repay their capital debt. The figure will rise to 50% the
following year.
Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson said he believed the estimates were
both ``realistic and achievable.''
However, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities claimed that the new
restriction over the use of capital receipts alone would cut the investment
available for housing by #300m over three years.
Cosla vice-president Councillor Keith Geddes said the new figures showed just
how severely the policy would affect council house building.
Shelter Scotland director Liz Nicholson said the announcement confirmed its
worst fears over the cutbacks. They would amount to 17% for next year and rise
to 38% by 1998-99.
``This is the most savage cut to the housing budget that Shelter can ever
remember. There will be no cheer for homeless and badly housed people this
Christmas'' she said.
However, the Minister insisted that ``substantial resources'' were being made
available for housing in view of this year's tough public spending round.
q.Mr Alan Ferguson, , director of the Chartered Institute of Housing in
Scotland, said: ``Adding to what many authorities have seen as unrealistic
dependence on receipts, the Scottish Office has told councils that 25% of the
receipts has to be used to offset their housing debt. This again limits
councils' ability to improve their stock.''

The Government's Private Finance Initiative promises much for hard-pressed
departments and the taxpayer. Ken Smith examines the implications
IF the Scottish Office were a house, then Secretary of State Michael Forsyth
would be the head of the household who has just been handed a credit card with
no financial limit, and told to go out and buy what he wants.
No need to save up the money, or to beg a loan from the bank manager, just hit
the shops and worry about the bills later.
That, in a simplistic sense, is the rationale behind the Government's Private
Finance Initiative. Roads, hospitals, sewage works, schools and colleges can
all be built without the Scottish Office paying. Private companies will design
the project, put the money up for it, run it for a set period of say 25 years,
and be paid back over the length of the contract.
The Government does not have to increase the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement and, in theory, major projects can be brought forward. After all,
philosophically speaking, all finance is private. Whether the money to build a
road is borrowed by the road builder or the Government is of little concern to
the drivers using the road.
When the Treasury relaxed borrowing rules, allowing the PFI to progress,
Michael Forsyth was the Cabinet Minister above all who saw the rich
possibilities it held out. While the Government is keen to keep public spending
at a minimum the PFI allows projects to go ahead which might otherwise be held
back. Indeed, the Scottish Office will argue that it will allow projects to
proceed which would not have happened for years.
So Mr Forsyth seized the ``initiative'', as it were, enthusiastically. By March
1999 the Scottish Office plans #2.2 billion worth of projects financed in this
way, and the final total could be even higher. Only the departments of
Transport and Health have anything like the same amount planned.
But, as anyone with a new credit card in his or her hand should ask, what is
the catch?
Three major road projects in Scotland are planned with private finance. The
first will be the completion of turning the remainder of the A74 at the Border
into motorway. Kevin Delaney of the RAC has few reservations about PFI. In
general, the motoring organisation welcomes PFI, but would be concerned if the
Government simply used it as an excuse to reduce its own spending on roads.
``Financially, it's a lot better than the suggestion that motorists pay tolls
on private roads. Instead, the Government has taken up our suggestion of shadow
tolling, whereby the builders and operators of the roads are paid in ratio to
the numbers using the road,'' he said.
There are two worries among members of the employers' organisation, the CBI.
First that smaller Scottish companies will lose out as the financial backing
and expertise required will be too great for smaller outfits. The second is
that the PFI is so new that it will take some time before contracts are
awarded. That means a hiatus in major capital projects just at a time when
construction companies are desperate to win them in order to survive.
In essence, the contracts are so large - #100m for the A74 upgrade, #150m for a
new Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh and #115m for a new Law Hospital in
Lanarkshire - that what are called special-purpose companies will be set up to
operate them. There will usually be three partners: the construction company to
build it, a financial house to fund it, and an operator to service the building
or road during the length of the contract.
Michael Murphy, a partner in Glasgow-based solicitors MacRoberts, which is
involved in setting up such companies, said one difficulty which has to be
resolved is the future of the equity stake of the partners, particularly the
construction company.
If a special-purpose company is set up to deal with say a #100m project, about
#10m to #15m of equity would be expected. The construction company may put up
about a third of that. The difficulty would be if there is an insistence on the
construction company keeping its equity stake for the length of the contract.
The construction company would prefer to take out its equity once the project
is built and move it on to another Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO)
scheme. Again, if too many such schemes crystallise at the same time then even
the largest construction companies would struggle to provide the necessary
equity.
Mr Murphy is confident, though, that such problems will be resolved. ``There
may be initial difficulties, but I suspect that in the near future we will be
looking back and saying that it's a good initiative and that it is generating
capital projects which are desperately needed.''
The Scottish TUC is less impressed. Assistant general secretary Richard Leonard
said: ``It's a bit like these signs that say `Buy Now and pay in March'. You
end up paying more in the long run. The Government can borrow more cheaply and
the companies will be wanting much bigger profit margins.
``It will also lead to priorities being determined by profit margins rather
than need.''
Nevertheless, if the teething problems are sorted out, there will be a rush of
much-needed capital projects by the end of the decade, and few people will
worry about the actual method of funding. Unless, that is, the major projects
are won by, say, French companies who have built up expertise in this area.
The day may come when the roadworks ahead in Scotland are marked with signs
stating: ``Attention Travaux.''

A system of franchised courses for older people is planned in Dundee. ANN SHAW
describes the level of teaching ability needed
A NOVEL franchise running fitness classes for the elderly has just been
launched by fitness guru Dorothy Dobson. Her name is synonymous with keep-fit
for she was one of the first to pioneer exercise for older people - long before
the current health boom made it fashionable.
Way back in 1978 Dorothy started her first class at Dundee University for the
over-sixties, already recognising the important role that stamina and fitness
play in helping people to enjoy an active Third Age.
In 1992 Dundee named Dobson ``Citizen of the Year'' in recognition of her work
with the elderly. Aware from the start that many older people are worried about
what constitutes safe exercise, Dobson worked in close conjunction with the
university's medical experts.
Research by consultant geriatrician Dr Marion McMurdo at Dundee University
proves that regular exercise offers:
n Reduced risk of heart disease and strokes.
n Stronger muscles, and improving mobility.
n Improved balance, reducing the risk of falls.
n Reduced anxiety and depression.
n A maintained independence to a later age.
The demand for the Dorothy Dobson Over-60s Exercise Classes, based on gentle
exercise to music, proved so phenomenal that Dundee University are currently
running more than 20 classes.
Finally, they decided they could no longer continue to fund more classes and
they have decided to launch them on a franchise basis.
Like the university classes, the emphasis is on quality of instruction and
preference is given to those seeking a franchise who have a medical or
paramedical background, and are also trained fitness teachers.
Half of the profits from this joint venture between Dundee University and
private investors will be reinvested in the university's ongoing research into
ageing and health.
From a marketing point of view this is a growth area. Already 17% of the
population is over 65 and within 10 years this is expected to exceed 25%.
How might you expect to earn? That depends on how many classes you would run
every week. If you were to do four with an average attendance of 30, regarded
as the minimum, you could expect annual earnings of #3250 - hardly a fortune.
On the other hand if you have enrolled 100 per class then you could expect to
earn #11,650.
Energy, and commitment to the cause of fitness for the elderly are prime
requirements: the emphasis is on the quality of instruction rather than
providing a business opportunity for someone to make a quick buck out of a
growing market.
``What you have to remember,'' points out Dobson, ``is that you need to enrol
about 120 in order to get a regular number of 80-90 each week.''
The franchise itself costs #4700 and comes with a full package of support and
training, including a one-week course in Dundee, an ongoing music programme,
along with marketing and promotional help.
``We are not looking for perfection,'' says Dobson, but a class leader should
be fit and healthy and lead a healthy lifestyle. You will be dealing with a
membership of up to 300 people or more, so you must have some organisational
skills. You should also be capable of building the confidence of your members
to achieve their potential.''
What happens once you have completed your application form? Dobson says: ``You
will be invited to attend an initial meeting to assess your qualifications and
suitability for the job. Part of your assessment will involve a brief session
exercising to music.''

JENNIFER Cunningham's article highlights the difficulties experienced over the
festive season by the thousands of children whose parents have now separated
(December 18).
For many more families the stress caused by the extra layer of financial and
other concerns created at this time of year will be the final straw which
breaks the camel's back and causes family breakdown.
Large numbers of families will split up over the holiday period. Family law
solicitors will be consulted by these parents in the New Year and will try to
help sort things out.
While is is still necessary to have separate legal advice at some stages,
people can now choose to start the process of separation by going together to a
family law solicitor mediator who will help them work out the practical
difficulties of separating in a co-operative way.
Those difficulties can often be extremely complex and concern both the family's
finances and the arrangements for the children in the future.
Having a mediator who has a detailed and practical knowledge of the law can be
very important. Mediation has many advantages but those who stand to benefit
most are the children.

Robbie Dinwoodie describes how one MP's week in politics has turned out to be
long and eventful
ONE RING and it answers - a strangled Dalek croaking out its death throes at
half-speed: ``The mess.......age....... unit....... is .......full.'' Mike
Watson's answering machine has melted under the heat of the Labour whips' wrath.
A week ago, the Glasgow Central MP at the centre of a selection battle with
opponent Mohammad Sarwar was anxiously expectant. Gradually, he became
fretfully confident as the contest reached its climax. Finally, he stood
victoriously depressed as he accepted a victory tainted by electoral
mud-slinging.
A week in politics is a very strange time, as Harold Wilson once almost
observed. Watson began last week as an MP fighting for his very livelihood and
ended it in victory - however narrow - over his adversary. But this is a
different week, and when he returns from his sojourn abroad which led him to
miss Tuesday night's three-line whip, he can expect the Labour Inquisition to
show him the instruments of torture.
Stretched out on the adjacent rack will be neighbouring MP Ian Davidson, chief
aide in the campaign to reselect the candidate. The fact that both MPs put
family holidays before the absolute demands of party managers who knew they had
a chance to damage the Government will inevitably lead to disciplinary action.
Although parliamentary group discipline is not connected to party procedures,
Watson still has to consider the national executive meeting next month which
will decide on an appeal for a re-run of the contest for the new Govan seat.
As one party insider put it yesterday: ``Last weekend, everything was going for
Mike. There was unease about the handling of the selection process, but the
feeling was that a sitting MP had won and he certainly had the support of his
fellow members of the Westminster club, especially since in the immediate
aftermath of the count Mohammad Sarwar and his supporters had gone over the top
in their condemnation.
``But since then Sarwar has gone out of his way to make conciliatory noises,
and now Mike has gone off abroad and missed a crucial vote. The boys in the
club are not pleased.''
How did it come to this? The answer is a combination of the clash between
individual exhaustion and collective discipline, coupled with the haywire
imperatives of one-member-one-vote. At the first of last week's three branch
meetings in the run-in to Thursday's count, only four people turned up to hear
the pleadings of the three candidates. Most preferred to vote by post, and it
was the verification of these votes - the checking of signatures - that led to
the hair's-breadth result.
New Labour will have to live with this new system of hands-off democracy which
gives power to individual party members but no longer requires them to sit
around at dull and lengthy meetings. It is a new machine, with new skills to
run it.
The machine of Old Labour would never have got itself in such a twist. For good
or ill, union power brokers would have sorted out a solution. A well-regarded
MP such as Watson whose seat was disappearing would have been found a new
billet, and an important entrant like Sarwar - with such a significant power
base in the Asian community - would have been found a seat from which someone
else was retiring, or was so persuaded.
This is very non-politically correct to say, of course, and entirely contrary
to the OMOV spirit which the late John Smith bequeathed to his New Labour
heirs. But it would have worked. Whoever accused the Conservatve Party of
internal democracy, after all?
Faced with this new reality the Parliamentary Labour Party gave generous leave
of absence from Westminster to Mike Watson to fight his battle, and Ian
Davidson to support him. The new guerrilla warfare of OMOV was an exhausting
fight, and both MPs marked their calendars in bold red pen for last Friday:
``ON HOLIDAY.''
Watson flew off with his wife for a weekend in Barcelona, returned to London on
Monday, and then flew off abroad again for a week on Tuesday morning. By then,
Davidson had flown off with his wife and two children for a holiday in Sri
Lanka.
They will have their own version of events to tell on their return but the word
from whips yesterday was that neither had sought prior permission, neither had
left a forwarding address or contact telephone number, and that although
Davidson had written to say he would be away on ``urgent business'' this week
both would be in trouble when they got back.

POLICE yesterday urged anyone shielding the killer of 16-year-old schoolgirl
Mhairi Julyan to come forward.
The man leading the hunt, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder, said: ``Someone
out there knows who is responsible for this. Someone has vital information and
that's who we want to speak to.''
The officer said that, although the response from the public had been very
good, no-one had been questioned.
Mhairi, a Kilmarnock Academy pupil, disappeared after a night out with friends
at the pantomime Sleeping Beauty in the town's Palace Theatre on Saturday.
On Sunday, her body was found in the Stagecoach bus depot close to her home in
Samson Avenue. Police said the sexually motivated attack was ``brutal and
savage''.
Young women in Kilmarnock admitted they were shocked at the possibility of a
killer being in their midst.
Teresa Le Masurier 19, a horticulturist, said: ``I'm from New Farm, which isn't
very far from the murder scene. It's scary when you think it happened so close
to home. London Road is a busy road, and you'd think somebody saw something.
``Now everybody's telling me to take a bus or a taxi but never walk home.''
Lesley-Anne Jardine 20, an auxiliary nurse from Kilmarnock, said: ``We don't
know if he will strike again. The poor lassie was only walking home. It could
have been anybody who did it.''
Her friend, sales assistant Gillian Falconer 20 added: ``I can't sleep at night
now. I'm even having nightmares about it, and that's never happened to me
before. We just don't feel safe anymore.''
Police have mounted extra patrols and have urged parents to find out where
their children are going at night.

LOTHIAN region's transport committee yesterday approved parking restrictions to
enable speedier bus transport in Edinburgh. Red lines will denote no parking
whatsoever and green-coloured lanes will signify buses only.
If the Scottish Secretary approves the plan early next year, it could be in
operation by next September.
Fake notes alert
THE Bank of Scotland has warned of counterfeit #20 notes in circulation. The
fake Bank of Scotland notes are of poor quality and can be identified by
checking for a non-existent or faint security thread and an unclear watermark
or the numeral 20. The backs of the counterfeit notes are also blurred.
Drink move
CHIEF Superintendent David Mitchell told West Lothian District Council
yesterday that he would shortly recommend two town centres in the distict where
public drinking of alcohol should be banned to reduce nuisance and street crime.
Woman `stable'
AN 83-year-old Edinburgh woman is ``stable'' in hospital after being struck by
a wheel which broke from a trailer behind a Land Rover in Colinton Mains Drive.
Mrs Doris Brown, of Oxgangs, is Edinburgh Royal Infirmary with head injuries.
By the neck
FOR Men Only, a barber's shop in Stephen's Brae, Inverness, is serving up a
free bottle of beer with every haircut as a festive gesture to customers.
Holiday sale
A T Mays launched a #10m sale yesterday by taking up to 35% off the cost of
cruises and summer breaks. The travel agent has 96 branches in Scotland.
Vandal jailed
PATRICK Reid, 31, of Benula Road, Inverness, was jailed for five months at
Inverness Sheriff Court yesterday for smashing 110 windows on three coaches at
the ScotRail depot on Longman Road, Inverness, on November 26. The damage
amounted to #8000.
Batons on way
NORTHERN Constabulary's 600 officers will start training with US-style
side-handled batons in the new year. They will also be issued with easy to use
speedcuffs.
Hibs deal
LOTHIAN region yesterday agreed to sell to Hibs for #65,000 the former
technical block of Norton Park school, next to the club's ground in Albion
Place, Edinburgh. It will be used as club offices.
Delays ending
THE majority of the work to streamline Clydebank's Kilbowie roundabout on Great
Western Road will be over before the start of the Christmas break. Delays have
been caused for five months.
Canal upgrade
FOUR kilometres of towpath on the Forth and Clyde Canal between Clydebank and
Glasgow is being raised to a standard suitable for walking and cycling.
Clydebank District Council will contribute up to #13,000 to British Waterways
to help finance the work.
Body found
A PENSIONER who went missing two weeks ago has been found dead. The body of
Hugh McNab, 85, was found at Invergowrie, near Dundee. He had last been seen at
his home in the Menzieshill area of Dundee on December 7. There were no
suspicious circumstances.
220lb baby
AN Asian elephant has had a female calf weighing 220lb at Chester Zoo. Only one
Asian elephant has been successfully reared in the UK - also at Chester, in
1977 - and zoo staff are anxious to repeat their success.
Green for go
WORK on signalling systems at Haymarket railway station in Edinburgh is to go

PETER Nicol, who missed the Scottish Championships last weekend, has been named
No.1 seed for the QM British National Championships in Birmingham from January
9 to 15.
The Inverurie man, who lost to Peter Marshall in the final two years ago, has
been placed ahead of England's world championship-winning trio of Del Harris,
Simon Parke, and Mark Chaloner.
Last week the world No.8 became the first Scot to win a Super Series event, the
Mahindra International in India, and he aims to be the first to win the British
title.
But Martin Heath, winner of the Scottish Championship last weekend, will not
compete in Birmingham, for which the draw will be made today. Heath complained:
``I don't agree with the Squash Rackets Association rankings. It is only the
English players who are automatically included, so I really regard it as an
English Closed event.''
Colchester's Harris is back at the top of the English rankings - for the first
time since March 1991. Harris takes over from Nottingham-based former world
No.2 Marshall, who had dominated the SRA rankings for four years but has had to
drop out of competition because of chronic fatigue syndrome.
Yorkshire's Simon Parke is No.2 and Lincolnshire's Mark Chaloner - the Sports
Writers' Association International newcomer - is third.
Norfolk's Cassie Jackman has displaced Suzanne Horner of Yorkshire at the top
of the women's list. Jackman, another former world junior champion, last held
first place two years ago but has been consistently topped by Horner since May
1993.

Although details of the event have not been released, Edinburgh-based concert
promoters Regular Music are involved in talks with Dumbarton District Council.
Councillor Sam McCallum, convener of the Leisure Committee, said: ``I can't
name names at the moment, but we're hoping to land the biggest and the best for
Balloch.''
The Balloch Castle Country Park was the setting in June 1991 for a Runrig
concert.
It was also revealed yesterday that Scotlands biggest pop festival, in
Strathclyde Park, will go ahead next July.

THE latest brutal murders in Northern Ireland are not directly involved in the
struggle between nationalists and loyalists. They do seem to have their origin
within the nationalist community all the same, and the pattern whereby its
leaders are simultaneously judge, jury, and executioner is familiar.
Indirectly, there is a message related to the political struggle - the murders
show how the IRA retains its ability to operate in a lethal manner with near
impunity. Curiously, neither the Dublin nor London governments had much to say
about these killings until yesterday when the murders were vigorously
condemned, just after the Unionst MP Ken Maginnis had drawn attention to the
official silence. Probably the timing was fortuitous but the fact is that the
established governments may be too deeply involved in the peace process to
react quickly to other challenges to civilised society.
The two governments are not making much progress in their efforts to establish
a lasting peace. Sometimes they are waylaid by minor matters, like the dispute
concerning EU subsidies to an Indian takeover of an Irish steelmaker. Sometimes
they merely go through the motions of diplomacy - like the summit meeting
scheduled for today - where nothing substantial can be achieved. Activity by
itself is not enough, and some activity even when positive is worth little. The
fact that the two governments got on well in their discussions with the
Alliance Party hardly matters, for it is the most reasonable of all Ulster's
political groupings. If liberal and democratic governments could not get on
well with Alliance representatives there would be no hope anywhere in Ireland.
Th
So far, so gloomy. The fact remains, however, that the political peace seems to
be holding into its second Christmas. The momentum for its continuance is
almost palpable. Could it prove irresistible? Just possibly the IRA will insist
on keeping its weapons but desist from using them. That is far from ideal but
it is better than a regression to the old ways. Obviously, the talks must go on
but any quick, neat resolution of years of conflict seems improbable.

SOME of the correspondence concerning the Presbytery of Glasgow's treatment of
the Asylum Bill prompted by Stewart Lamont's somewhat inaccurate article
(December 16) implies that a small number of activists railroaded the
Presbytery into the decision that it made. Furthermore it is alleged that this
was pre-orchestrated and that the Presbytery Council knew nothing of it.
I would like to point out that Norman Shanks contacted me as convener of the
Presbytery's Community Responsibility Committee asking if he could make a
deliverance arguing against the withdrawal of benefits from asylum-seekers as
part of our report. This proposal I was happy to agree to after confirming with
the convener of the Presbytery Council that such a procedure would be
acceptable.
That it was not pre-orchestrated is shown by the fact that another speaker.
unaware of our intentions, made an essentially identical motion immediately
before our report was due to be delivered.
The terms of the motion and the implications of the motion were then placed
before Presbytery and discussion was invited. If Presbytery felt that it was
being railroaded or that it was not sufficiently informed of the facts to make
a decision then this was the time to complain - a number of us bear sufficient
bruises from previous verbal maulings to know that the members of Glasgow
Presbytery are not hesitant when it comes to making their views known .
However, a majority of Presbytery members were then happy to vote to accept the
terms of the motion and, if memory serves me right, only Mr Lamont actually
voted against.
This hardly smacks of railroading and would seem to imply common assent to an
issue that goes to the heart of concepts such as dealing justly and with
righteousness towards the sojourner in our midst.
In suggesting that a small cabal railroaded Presbytery into a decision which it
did not understand nor wished to make, Stewart Lamont does his fellow
presbyters a great disservice which he should attempt to put right as soon as
possible by accepting that on this, as on many other issues, it would seem that
his colleagues in Presbytery fully understand the issues and yet still choose
to disagree with him.

THE operators of both the Forrestburn and Knockhill motor racing circuits were
urged yesterday to get together by Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch.
He was speaking in a Commons debate in which concerns were raised about the
threat to Knockhill in Fife from the new race track development at Forrestburn
in Monklands.
The issue was raised by Ms Rachel Squire (Dunfermline West - Lab.), who argued
that if Forrestburn succeeded, it could put Knockhill out of business.
The plan at Forrestburn is to produce a 3.2 mile international lay-out designed
to attract Formula 2 and Formula 3 race driving - with Formula 1 a possibility
in the long term.
Pointing out that #1.4m of EU money would be used in the Forrestburn project,
Ms Squire said only a limited number of events were large enough to attract
crowds big enough to make the business viable.
She called for full consultation with experts around the UK on whether there
was sufficient business available to support two racetracks within such a short
distance of each other before further progress was made on Forrestburn.
She voiced fears that ``public money will have been used to build up false
hopes in Lanarkshire and ruin a successful private enterprise business in Fife,
which I believe could damage the sporting reputation of Scotland.''
For the Government, however, Mr Kynoch said the two tracks were looking at
essentially different markets, and suggested that they could be complementary
projects rather than one being seen in competition with the other.
He said he understood Ms Squire's reservations, but said that she should get in
touch with organisations supporting the Forrestburn development.

A THIEF known as Lucifer was jailed for 27 years yesterday after a campaign of
terror that police said had spanned 10 years and made him #1m.
Powerfully built Keith Bramble, 36, had boasted he was protected by Satan and
could never be caught. His 6ft 4in frame swayed in the dock in a Middlesex
court and he had to grip the rail as he received the longest jail term ever
passed for domestic break-ins.
Judge Derek Clarkson, who retires today, told Bramble that he preyed on the
wealthy and vulnerable, and had enjoyed frightening his victims.
``Inspiring terror seems to have had an appeal to Keith Bramble,'' the judge
said. ``This defendant gloried in the effect that he could produce. It was, as
well as the prospect of enrichment, part of the attraction.''.
Judge Clarkson said that too many courts these days looked ``with a certain
intellectual detachment'' on crimes committed in Britain without taking into
account the effect on the victims.
``The public expect and they are right to expect judges to take into account
the effect of crimes of this sort on people who are attacked in their own
dwellings, where they should feel always at ease and secure.
``I take the view that these crimes do merit severe punishment. They are wicked
and callous crimes against people in their own homes and the punishment must
act as a deterrent.''
He invoked sentencing powers available under the Criminal Justice Act to impose
a jail term 50% longer than he would otherwise have passed.
The judge told Bramble he would serve concurrent terms of 21, 22, and 27 years
on the three robberies of which he was convicted at Guildhall Crown Court, and
serve an additional six months, also concurrent, for assaulting a prison
officer with intent to resist arrest.
He sentenced Anthony Gabbidon, 31, who accompanied Bramble on the last and most
serious raid, to 16 years.
Bramble used the cover of dark and stormy nights to target homes in up-market
areas.
He would be masked, and invariably armed himself with an array of weapons,
including crowbars and knives.
Detective Inspector John Shatford, who led the hunt, said after the hearing
that Bramble liked his victims to be in so he could ``relish their fear'' and
feed his addiction for inflicting ``maximum terror''.
``He carried out a campaign of unmitigated terror but many people can rest
easier in their own homes now that he is out of circulation.
``That sentence will do more to prevent similar offences than anything else the
police could do.''
Bramble stole fortunes in cash and jewellery and spent much of it on crack
cocaine, surrounding himself women whom he treated like slaves.
In court, Mr Shatford told the judge of the effect Bramble had had on his
victims.
``They will never recover from it. I have spoken to them all and they are
totally devastated,'' he said.
One of those in the packed public gallery during the sentencing hearing was
fashion firm chairman William Angel, 69, whose house was the last Bramble
raided.
Mr Angel said: ``The judge summed it up by saying that not a lot of thought was
given to the victims. Courts just don't realise the terror we have been through.
``When we go out at night we are petrified. We are worried 24 hours a day.''
Mr Angel, who tried to use a table to defend himself and his wife and his aged
brother-in-law when Bramble burst in, said that during the struggle with his
attacker he managed to pull off his mask.
``I keep on seeing that face over and over in my mind. That face will always
stay with me.
``There was an expression of absolute fury on his face but at the same time
panic. Being unmasked really unnerved him.''
Jailers later spoke of Bramble being in a ``zombie-like state'' after the
sentence. One said: ``He was so stunned he couldn't speak. But during the trial
he was full of bravado and had convinced himself he was going to get off.''

DEVOLUTION and abolishing the undemocratic archaic House of Lords has been
promised by the Labour Party since Keir Hardie's election address of 1888, and
has never been delivered.
Keeping in mind that the present New Labour Party is unquestionably the least
radical in its history how, in the name of Scotland, can anyone believe its
present ambiguous ``commitment'' to a so-called Scottish parliament?
Devolution is something which must be granted as a privilege by Westminster; it
is not a right, and may be given or taken away. As such it has very limited
use, except to appease Scottish political aspirations and preserve Labour's
vote in Scotland.
Decisions on issues such as taxation, nuclear waste, defence, unemployment
benefit, and the economy would still be taken by Westminster. Devolution would
amount only to an extra tier of local government called a Scottish parliament.
Labour's Jack Straw boasts that ``power devolved is power retained''. Obviously
Labour's priority is not devolving real power to Scotland but preserving it at
Westminster. Scotland mustn't confuse appeasement and treachery with power.

It's party time and with it comes the dangers of over-indulgence. Ann Shaw has
some timely advice for anyone falling foul of the demon drink
SCOTS botanist Duncan Napier put together a cure for over-indulgence in 1860: a
mixture of bitter yellow Peruvian bark, pulverised cloves, crushed cinnamon and
a large pinch of sulphuric acid in a weak mixture of alcohol and warm water.
This gruesome concoction, which sold well in Edinburgh, was one of many
traditional remedies which medical herbalist Dee Atkinson discovered when she
took over Napier's Dispensary, the oldest herbal house in Britain, a few years
ago.
Happily, today more palatable cures are offered for hangovers. The most popular
in Scotland, according to one young Glaswegian is ``Irn Bru and a fry up.''
The search for the perfect ``morning after'' cure is something as old as man's
ability to brew beer, distil spirits and ferment grape juices.
The aim behind all hangover cures is to boost the liver, to help it metabolise
the alcohol. Drinking water helps with the rehydration of the body, but you
need more than that.
A boost with some multi-vitamin and mineral supplements is needed. An extra
gram of      vitamin C, before and after a night out, helps. Eating lots of
fresh fruit and drinking orange juice is one of the simplest and most effective
ways of helping to cure the condition, says Atkinson.
Take your pick from alternative health remedies. One that comes highly
recommended is an extra vitamin B complex supplement plus six evening primrose
oil capsules with a glass of water and a small piece of dry wholemeal bread.
This combination, if taken an hour before a drinking session, is believed to be
good at preventing hangovers.
On the other hand, many people simply reach for a couple of paracetamol and a
glass of water. As good a cure as any, says one doctor.
There are some simple precautions that can be taken: eat a meal before drinking
to delay absorption of alcohol; alternate alcoholic drinks with mineral water
or fruit juice; try herbal tea rather than coffee as the morning-after caffeine
merely stimulates a hangover; and drink lots of water to replace the fluids
lost by the dehydrating effects of alcohol.
Or again there is another popular, remedy: stay in bed. Some people swear by
the ulcer drug Zantac, which apparently cures hangovers quickly.
A point to remember: rum, port, red wine, whisky, and brandy generally produce
more serious hangovers than vodka, gin and white wine.
Don't forget that alcohol can have a very different effect on people of the
same height and weight. Some people seem to have a natural ability to clear
alcohol out of the system faster than others.
Regular drinkers are less likely to suffer hangovers since their body has built
up a tolerance. Those most at risk of severe hangovers are the      people who
really only let themselves go at Christmas and New Year.
The bad news for women is that the female liver is less alcohol tolerant to
start with. Hormonal levels also seem to affect metabolism with some women
finding they can consume more at certain times of the month, according to their
menstrual cycle.
Finally, a word of warning from one doctor for those considering some short,
sharp, shock treatment for the body: it is dangerous to indulge in vigorous
exercise if you have still got alcohol in the bloodstream and you are
dehydrated.
The bottom line, of course, is not to drink. On the other hand, when
non-drinkers get up in the morning bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, that's as good
as they'll feel all day.
HOW TO CURE
IT NATURALLY
n THOSE looking for something novel to cure a hangover should try either of
these herbal remedies: Hangover Hotch Potch Bitters or Swedish Bittes.
Dee Atkinson says: ``We do a roaring trade in Hangover Hotch Potch Bitters.
This is a tongue-tingling mixture of dandelion roots, milk thistle seeds and
gentiana compound.'' (Available from Napier's in Edinburgh and Glasgow price
#1.95, also on mail order.)
Swedish Bittes is popular with continentals. It is a herbal elixir based on
bitter herbs which have traditionally played an important role in maintaining
food health and overall wellbeing.
This 11-herb mixture contains manna, aloe, senna leaves, rhubarb root, zedoary
root, angelica root, theriraca (blended mix), carline thistle root, myrrh,
camphor, and saffron. Available from all good health shops for #6.99.
Brew that is true after
a flagon of the dragon
A SURVEY carried out in The Herald office revealed that the most popular cure
for a hangover is Irn-Bru.
Billy Connolly even dedicated a song to it in remembrance of hangovers cured.
It has to be remembered that Irn Bru is a piece of Scots folklore. This fizzy
orange liquid is not just a drink. It is an icon - as much a part of Scotland
as tartan or heather - which is believed to possess magical restorative and
medicinal powers.
A hard man can walk into a Gorbals bar and ask for a bottle of Bru without
anyone turning a hair. But there is no medical evidence that Irn Bru solves a
hangover better than any other fluid. Yes, it helps with rehydration but so
does sweet tea, and that's cheaper.
You would be better off, says medical herbalist Dee Atkinson, eating lots of
fresh fruit and drinking orange juice, for the benefit of vitamin C, and to
boost your liquid intake.
Every nation has its tried-and-tested treatments:
The French favour a small coffee with salt.
The Germans believe in a magnesium-rich breakfast - bananas and red meat washed
down with milk.
The Swiss reach for the O-Pur: a can of neat oxygen which gives 10 minutes'
supply and comes with a disposable face mask.
The Japanese drink gallons of green tea, while the Chinese boil banana skin and
drink the liquid.
Russians believe a bottle of vodka is the answer, often mixed with rassol, the
juice left after pickling salted cabbage.
Icelanders go for the time-honoured cure of a large glass of cider vinegar and
honey.
The Americans go for the prairie oyster: a raw egg, tomato juice, and hot
pepper sauce, mixed and drunk in a oner.
Or there is the Californian ethos: ``Stop pouring poison into your body. Honour
it as a temple with abstinence.'' Californian doctors have also developed a
drug, Naltrexone, which removes the pleasurable effects of drinking, leaving
the drinker with only the hangover.
The answer for Italians is simply a very large cafe espresso, brewed fortissimo.
A REALLY RUDE
AWAKENING
n-``HIS mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night,
and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he'd somehow been on a
cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police.''
- Kingsley Amis's definition of a hangover in Lucky Jim.
n-HANGOVER: Roget's Thesaurus definition: ``Crapulence, crapulousness;
next-morning feeling, sottishness, beeriness, leaving you feeling squiffy,
tight, lushy, soused, soaked, pickled, blotto, drunk as a lord, stinko.
n-FOR a bad hangover, take the juice of two quarts of whiskey.
- Eddie Condon.
n-I'D take a bromo, but I can't stand the noise.
- Joe E.Lewis.
EXPERTS PUT IT TO THE TEST
TESTS carried out by Which? magazine found that commercial hangover remedies
should relieve symptoms but two paracetamol and a glass of water will do the
job more cheaply.
A panel of experts analysed five products which are designed to treat a
combined headache and upset stomach.
n.Beecham Resolve (contains paracetamol, citric acid, sodium bicarbonate
potassium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, vitamin C) Cost: #2.95 for pack of 10.
``Vitamin C won't tackle hangover symptoms and you should get enough from a
healthy diet to make the amount in Resolve an unnecessary addition.''
n.Alka Seltzer (aspirin, citric acid, sodium bicarbonate). Cost: #2.99 for pack
of 30.
``The combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric acid partly protects the
stomach from attack by aspirin, but most of our experts preferred products
containing paracetamol.''
n.Boots Headache and Indigestion Relief (paracetamol, caffeine, citric acid,
sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate) Cost: #1.59 for 200mml.
``Contains only half as much caffeine as Answer, so is even less likely to give
you a lift.''
n.Superdrug Paracetamol Seltzer (paracetamol, sodium bicarbonate) Cost: #1.55
for 24 tablets.
``Contains the important ingredients and costs much less per dose than the
others.''
The magazine summed up its findings. ``You may find that remedies which combine
a painkiller and antacid are convenient to take and that those with sweeteners
(all but Alka Seltzer) are more palatable. But our experts reckon that taking
plenty of liquid and two paracetamol will work just as well and cost much
less.''
A number of home remedies were also considered by the panel with varying
results.
While evening primrose oil could work in theory, the panel thought it unlikely
to have an effect. A fried breakfast may work for some people but it is one of
the worst things to have on a delicate stomach.
Prairie oyster - raw egg, lemon juice, pepper and spicy sauce - has a
reputation for effectiveness but the panel could find no explanation for this.
Dioralyte, a treatment for severe dehydration, will combat some of the effects
but at 40p a dose it is expensive, compared with plain water.
The panel was clear on one of the worst things a hungover drinker can do -
treat the symptoms with more alcohol. Although the ``hair of the dog'' may help
the symptoms temporarily it could be the slippery slope to alcoholism.

IN Glasgow's biggest office deal for several years, 250 St Vincent Street has
changed hands for #10.25m. The building has been purchased by BBC Pension Trust
Ltd from Scottish Widows at a price which reflects a net initial yield of 7.1%.
The building was completely redeveloped in 1990 behind a retained facade by
Burton Property Trust, creating 44,000 sq.ft of open-plan space. Scottish
Widows purchased the redeveloped property in 1991 for some #8.25m, achieving a
#2m uplift in value over the past four years. The property is let to Norwich
Union at an initial rental of #755,000 per annum on a 25-year lease. The BBC
Pension Trust has been active in the Glasgow market, having recently sold the
office investment at 225 Bath Street to a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of
Scotland in a #7.75m deal.
Scottish Widows was represented by Hillier Parker and the purchaser by Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley. ``This is the largest and most significant office transaction
to take place in Glasgow over the past few years,'' says Peter Smolka of
Hillier Parker. ``Investment funds are engaged in a flight to quality. The rent
at 250 St Vincent Street is close to the building's true rental value and it
has an excellent tenant with an unexpired 20 years left on the lease. The deal
is a strong indication of renewed investor confidence in the city.''
He is optimistic that the blip in investment activity which boosted the Glasgow
market a couple of years ago might be repeated in 1996.
``There won't be an avalanche of investment deals, but I think we'll see a
steady flow. A lot of big investors have Glasgow on their hit list - but they
are extremely picky about which buildings they will purchase, only the best
will do. There would be more deals done in Glasgow if there were more quality
buildings available on the market, but landlords are tending to hold on to
their best stock.''
However, he is concerned about Glasgow's planning policy which pushes for city
centre redevelopments to be carried out behind retained facades, wherever
possible. ``There is a growing reluctance among the big investors to purchase
this kind of building. This is an important planning issue which Glasgow needs
to face up to,'' he says.

PERHAPS it is the feet and the way they don't like being seen walking together.
Or the way the knees seemed to concertina with the responsibility of pointing
forward all the time - the way they shoogle and buckle and shimmy sideways to
avoid whatever lies straight ahead.
Gerard Kelly has got pure dead glaikit legs. They are currently supporting him
in Robinson Crusoe, along with a stalwart cast who all seem to share a real
affection for the particular quirks of old-fashioned panto.
From the moment the lights dim, tradition asserts itself: Blackheart the Pirate
(Derek Lord with a deep, dark swaggering voice to match his deep, dark
swaggering vices) crossing rhyming couplets with the ethereal spirit of the
Northern Star (Mairi McHaffie).
There's booty at stake. A vital map, a desert island, treasure - all needing to
be found by someone more deserving than Blackheart. Enter penniless Captain
Cockle, his lovely daughter and her fearless beau, Robinson Crusoe
(enthusiastically played by Briony McRoberts temporarily deserting the High
Road for the high seas).
The plot takes in such perennial favourites as the shipwreck, the underwater
kingdom, a desert island full of hotsy-totsy dancing cannibals and a Friday
(Cornell John) who spouts elegant Shakespeare unless we shut him up!
James Horne's Dame is properly garish and coos like a foghorn but it's Kelly's
Silly Billy that wins hearts and powers the comedy. ``Am I the man for the
job?'' he beseeches us. ``You are. You are!'' we roar back lovingly. ``If the
job is keeping panto alive for another generation, that's certainly true,''
said Ofpants, the official panto watchdog. ``Kelly leads by a mile and two daft
feet.''

BLABOUR and the Tories were involved in angry exchanges yesterday over the
state of Scottish education.
The plan for nursery vouchers, the assisted places scheme and the student loans
system all came under fire from Labour during Scottish Question Time in the
Commons.
Mrs Maria Fyfe (Glasgow Maryhill - Lab.) referred to the recent announcement
that the Government's plan for privatising student loans had been delayed for a
year, which means it will not be brought in before October 1997, well after the
last possible date for the next General Election.
She asked Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson how he would
``extricate himself from this shambles,'' but Mr Robertson insisted the student
loans scheme was working well.''
From the Labour Front Bench, Mrs Helen Liddell renewed her attack on the
proposals for nursery vouchers.
Mr Robertson, who clashed with Mrs Liddell on Tuesday over the assisted places
scheme, told her: ``Over the recess you should be looking at what you have been
saying from the Front Bench because sometimes your comments have been
absolutely shameful.''

ALL'S well that Bell's well. Putting Irish conductor Christopher Bell in charge
of a musical occasion with a strong social element - where the conductor has to
communicate with the audience, whether it's kids or grown-ups out for a night
on the town - is an increasingly clever thing to do.
Bell has not only a natural gift of the gab, he is completely from another
planet (in the best sense). In 13 years of working on this page, and in
thousands of concerts covered, no other conductor would have dared to invite an
audience to come along to a New Year concert and ``throw up over everyone''.
In attempting (successfully) to get the audience at last night's RSNO Christmas
Concert to sing along, he hurled good-natured abuse at the huge crowd,
referring to the ``ancient Celtic singing'' that was going on, that the sound
of the mob suggested to him that there were some Russians out there, and
referred to the women's singing as ``hormonally challenged'', with an
exhortation to the ladies to ``hoist yerselves up''.
Knockabout stuff, lapped up by the crowd, though the coup de grace was getting
us all to do a ``crossover Mexican wave, with some double thrusting by the
chaps in the middle''. All of which had almost nothing to do with the musical
content of the show, though everything to do with the atmosphere.
In and around all the nonsense, there was congregational choral singing, Dave
Anderson - as droll as a bassoon - narrating Brother Heinrich's Christmas, and
the RSNO adult and junior choruses in shining fettle for a series of seasonal
items.

WILLIAM RUSSELL heralds the satellite arrival of the classics they couldn't kill
BRITAIN's television viewers have seen nothing like it before. Will they wish
to see anything like it again? Bravo, the satellite channel, is to screen on
Monday nights at 10pm over the next two months the best, if there is such a
thing, of the films made by New York's famous Troma studios.
They are being shown after 10 because, as even the studio's boss and leading
director, Lloyd Kaufman, with 42 films in 22 years, admits Troma films are not
family viewing. ``I don't think teeny children should be watching them,
although otherwise they are fun,'' he says.
Troma specialises in not so much low-budget as no-budget movies. Kaufman
believes it is a mould-breaking organisation which has led the way where
Hollywood has been afraid to go, although it has duly followed. Big names who
started at Troma include Robert de Niro, Oliver Stone and Kevin Costner.
The films in the season will be the directors' cuts, says Kaufman, and include
such famous titles as Stuff Stephanie in the Incinerator, Surf Nazis Must Die
and A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell. This latter was one example of where
Troma pre-dated Hollywood and showed Steven Spielberg a thing or two, claims
Kaufman.
``We were unable to afford his animatronic computerised dinosaurs, but our
creatures are very good,'' he said. ``We hatched them ourselves from original
eggs in Troma's damp New York basement. The story is about a deadly, horny
dinosaur who pursues the last woman alive on earth. She is a sexy, little
blonde and the dinosaur gets lucky, no doubt about it.''
Kaufman says that women in Troma films were always strong. They had to be. And
it was Troma policy not to be sexist so they did not use the word women, but
called them Gyno-Americans. Not only were they strong and courageous, but they
wore very small costumes. Indeed, very small costumes was a Troma speciality.
It saved money.
IT is not just available in video stores or on Bravo. It is also on the
Internet, and Lloyd said he got sacks of fan mail from all over the world, many
from persons of the sex opposite to his own. Feminists loved Troma.
I asked what his current project was, and he said he was busy making Tromeo and
Juliet, having visited Stratford upon Avon recently and been entered by the
spirit of Shakespeare. He declined to say how.
The greatest Troma star is the Toxic Avenger, known familiarly as Toxie, a
green-faced mutant who has featured in several adventures in which he cleans up
the world. Lloyd said Toxie was extending his range and would be joining the
Three Tenors Tour next year, having just been signed up by Harvey Goldsmith,
although whether Toxie would sing or just clean up after the famous three Lloyd
did not say. The original Toxic Avenger film is Bravo's Christmas Day treat,
while the sequel goes out at New Year.
He hoped the British public, which was being exposed for the first time to
Troma, would like what he had to offer, although being ``only a poor artiste''
he had no idea whether it would. Then he promised to send me a copy of his
masterpiece, Chopper Chicks, which stars several Gyno-Americans in very small
costumes, for Christmas. When I thanked him he made clear he had said lend, not
send. Lloyd gives nothing away.

Anne Johnstone examines a report which exposes the misery of old folk trying to
live on meagre incomes
`THERE are some days when I think, why do I have to do this when I've worked
all my life and reared a family of 10 children? There's just no end to it. I'm
constantly robbing Peter to pay Paul.'' The speaker is Kathy Bell and she's
wondering why, at the age of 74, she's still having to go out to work to make
ends meet.
Kathy is one of the pensioners whose ``spending diary'' is featured in a report
out yesterday from Age Concern. Just About Coping doesn't pretend to be a
scientific study, bristling with shocking statistics. The size of the sample
(32) is far too small for that. Rather, it brings those statistics to life,
lifting the lid on the misery of life for many pensioners in Britain today.
If, as some suggest, you can judge a country by the way it treats its old folk,
Britain doesn't appear to come off very well. This report paints a sad picture
of tired old people who always choose the cheapest brand, rarely eat out and
can't afford to buy clothes.
More than a third of the sample said they had difficulty staying out of the red
and half appeared to have a weekly deficit. ``Often, it's a one-off item such
as a repair bill that knocks them for six,'' says Jane Titley, Age Concern's
campaigns manager and author of the report. She says that rather than borrow,
older people fall back on their savings and when these are exhausted, they
start cutting essentials like fuel and food.
Asked how they would spend the money if they had another #10 a week, almost all
said it would go on basics: food, clothing, heating. Most said they never took
holidays. Half said they spent nothing on clothes.
Though much is made of old people's access to free prescriptions, a third of
those in this survey reckoned that long-standing health conditions such as
arthritis, osteoporosis, angina and high blood pressure, cost them money. Such
expenditure includes fares for travel to and from hospital appointments and
medication not covered by prescription.
One lone pensioner told how she needed to buy antiseptic after falling and
cutting herself outside. It cost #1.49. She could only afford it by buying less
food that week.
All those participating in the survey were asked to keep a ``diary'' listing
income and expenditure each week, and complete a detailed questionnaire about
their longer-term spending and income. The diaries leave an impression of old
people scrimping and saving and always on the trail of special offers and the
cheapest of everything.
One man, who lived a long way from shops, made a meticulous list before each
week's shopping trip, detailing each item he needed and the exact cost, then
juggling the items until he could get it to fit his meagre income.
The survey is part of Age Concern's 1995 Short Change campaign for a decent
level of income for all pensioners. Its findings closely reflect those of a
similar exercise conducted among Scottish pensioners two years ago.
The Government is fond of telling us how well pensioners have fared under the
Conservatives. For example, Peter Lilley, then Social Security Secretary,
stated in 1993 that pensioners' ``average'' net incomes have increased by 54%
since 1979.
Sally West of Age Concern says such statements are misleading: ``If only
average figures are considered, the picture is skewed by the richest fifth or
so of pensioners who have enjoyed much higher increases. There is a clear trend
showing the lower the income, the smaller the percentage increases.'' In fact,
after the deduction of housing costs the poorest fifth of pensioners were just
2% better off in 1989 compared with a decade earlier.
Many pensioners are worse off in real terms because of the introduction of
charges for services which used to be free, and increases in indirect taxation.
All age groups have to squeeze their belts at times. The difference between
most old people and most of the rest of us is that we generally look forward to
at least modest pay rises. Because state benefits are uprated annually on the
basis of the retail price index, rather than average earnings, many old people
will never see their earnings rise, and life is a constant struggle.

SCOTTISH workers are less happy with their lot than other UK employees,
according to two surveys published today by Proudfoot management consultants
and the MSF trade union.
Some 59% of Scottish workers describe their boss as a Scrooge rather than a
Santa according to Proudfoot's study, which shows 55% as the UK average. They
also have more complaints about pay levels (60% as opposed to a 45% average),
poor promotion opportunities (49% against a 25% average), and being expected to
work too hard (46% against 34%).
The Manufacturing Science and Finance survey shows that 92% of Scottish
employees feel the jobs in their workplace are no more secure than last
Christmas, while 46% believe they are less secure.
These figures for Scotland are higher than the UK averages, which are given as
85% and 43% respectively, but considerably short of the gloom emanating from
London (94% and 61%), Northern Ireland (100% and 67%), and Wales (100% and 73%).
The MSF study also indicates a worsening of treatment of employees by their
bosses and that stress at work is escalating. A total 20% complained of
worsening treatment compared with three months ago, while 42% described the
treatment in their workplace as ``very poor'', with the biggest complaints
coming from the financial services sector, where 58% said their treatment was
poor or very poor.
Apart from job security, pay continues to be the main issue of workplace
concern, along with worries about pressure of work and increased stress. Stress
is a particular concern in financial services, the voluntary sector, and the
NHS.
Commenting on the survey, which covers 366 private and public sector workplaces
employing 118,000 staff, MSF general secretary Roger Lyons said: ``People are
going into the Christmas period not knowing if they will have a job in the new
year.
``Tax cuts have not changed a thing and people have no confidence in John Major
and his beleaguered Government. The best Christmas present he could give us is
a General Election.
``Ebenezer Scrooge remains the number one role model for Britain's bosses,'' he
added.
Proudfoot chief executive Malcolm Hughes said his company had wanted to take a
light-hearted look at how employees evaluate their bosses, but the survey had
raised some serious issues which managers should seek to address in the future.

ENGLAND A's hopes of completing a clean sweep in the one-day series against
Pakistan - and finishing the tour unbeaten - were dashed by 21-year-old fast
bowler Sajid Shah in Sheikhupura yesterday.
The right-armer, playing his first match of the series, took six for 43 as
England A were dismissed for just 115 in reply to Pakistan A's 40-over score of
248 for five for a crushing 133-run defeat. But England A won the Test series
1-0 and the one-day internationals 2-1.
The tone had been set by opener Sajid Ali, who plays for Poloc in the Western
Union and has represented Pakistan in 10 one-day internationals. He scored 38
from 34 balls, with seven 4s and a 6, out of the total of 53 when he became the
second victim of Sussex paceman Ed Giddins. Test men Shakil Ahmed (69 off 83
balls, with two 6s) and Asif Mujtaba (62 off 82, with one 6) then had a stand
of 118 runs off 126 balls.
Shah then ripped through England's top order, capturing half their wickets to
reduce them to 59 for five. The main resistance came from Kent paceman Dean
Headley, with two 6s in an unbeaten 26.
SCORES: Pakistan A 248-5 (Shakil Ahmed 69, Asif Mujtaba 62); England A 115
(Sajid Shah 6-43). Pakistan A won by 133 runs.
q PAKISTAN thrashed New Zealand by 54 runs in a one-day match in Wellington
yesterday to take a 2-1 lead in the four-match series.
Aamir Sohail (58), Inzamam-ul-Haq (54), Ijaz Ahmed (42), and Akram, whose 36
not out off just 15 balls included two 6s and three 4s, helped Pakistan pile on
261 for four. In reply, Craig Spearman scored a quickfire 33, but Pakistan
captain and man-of-the-match Wasim Akram removed him and Bryan Young in
successive balls.
There was brief resistance from Stephen Fleming (35), Roger Twose (37), and Lee
Germon (40) but New Zealand were all out for 207.
SCORES:: Pakistan 261-4 (Aamir Sohail 58, Inzamam-ul-Haq 54); New Zealand 207.

SHUNTED by ideology and fired by a desperate sort of determination, rail
privatisation is pushing ahead. We may not like it, believing that there was
little wrong with the nationalised service except a deliberate lack of state
investment, but the privatisation process now resembles nothing so much as the
headlong rush to introduce the poll tax. Just as the general public could
hardly believe that anything as wrong-headed as the poll tax would be pressed
upon them, there is a feeling abroad that rail privatisation is so generally
unpopular that it could not possibly happen. Would that it were so. The simple
fact is that, although the Government cannot meet its latest target of
privatising just over half of the system by April of next year, there is every
likelihood that the bulk of the railways will be in private hands by the time
of the next election. The only caveat to that is that Mr Major and his
colleagues may fall by the trackside before 1997, but those who are appalled at
the prospect of a privatised rail system should not rely on such an outcome.
The Government's determination is personified by Sir George Young, previously
the mildest of men, who appears to have developed a privatising zeal for
anything that moves on rails. His plans, and the requirements for services set
down by the franchising director, Mr Salmon, were soundly rebuffed recently by
the Appeal Court judges in London who decided that the minimum service levels
set by Mr Salmon were too low and in contravention of Government guidelines.
This has not troubled Sir George; he has merely altered the guidelines and
allowed the first three privatisations to go ahead. We can learn a good deal
from these commercial agreements; the first point is that the Labour Party's
attempts to deter private investors from involving themselves in franchise
holders by the threat of taking the privatised services back into public
ownership under a Labour Government appears to have failed. This is suggested
by the appearance of the important venture capital company 3i in two of the
first three franchises. Other potential investors who may have hesitated will
be heartened by the involvement of 3i and may be more willing to emulate them.
The plans set out by the management-employee buy-out teams who were yesterday
awarded the Great Western franchise and the London, Tilbury and Southend line
(LTS), better known as ``the misery line'', tell us other things. The Great
Western company will receive public support of #53.2m in the first year of
operation, falling to #38.2m in the year 2003. Depending on how you assess the
figures, it can be argued that there was no public subsidy to British Rail on
the routes in 1993-4. Other interesting facts include the admission by the
heads of both Great Western and LTS that jobs will be cut and that a varying
amount of fares (in the case of Great Western only 25%) are protected by the
fare-capping system. Stagecoach, which has been awarded the franchise for South
West Trains, provides other interesting facts. Although the company has no
plans to raise fares or reduce services, neither does it have plans to buy new
rolling stock. With a seven-year franchise this is, perhaps, understandable,
but Stagecoach's development plans appear to focus largely on linking their bus
services into the new privatised rail network. Is that really what all this
upheaval has been about?
The privatisation of the rail network is no more palatable to the general
public than the poll tax; that much appears certain. Unfortunately this holds
no weight with the Government which stands alone as an enthusiastic proponent
of the scheme. It is important to remember, as the arguments rage back and
forth, that there was an alternative to the present shambles. That was to
finance properly what was already an excellent rail service and, moreover, one
which was integrated because it was held in the hands of the state. It is
wrong, of course, to have a closed mind on the subject. It is possible that
some of the privatised services may improve on the previous system, but as all
private schemes require a greater return on capital than public schemes, we
await with interest news of the added, and inevitable, cost burden.

SKYE Camanachd could not have drawn a shorter straw than their first match of
1996 after the festive break.
The island side, who play in north division one, suffered a heavy defeat at the
hands of all-conquering Kingussie in a recent MacAulay Cup tie. They have now
have been scheduled to meet the premier league side again in their MacTavish
Cup tie which was postponed a fortnight ago.
Skye should be thereabouts when the play-off for the right to go up to the
premier league takes place between the champions from divisions one in the
north and south.
Duncan Cameron, president of the Camanachd Association, has been pleased with a
very successful second part to 1995. He said: ``We have to be delighted with
the way things have gone so far, especially coming off the back of such a great
Camanachd Cup final at the end of last season, and the international
performances against Ireland.
``I now look forward to building on that success in 1996 and the implementation
of our development plan is now the key to our future, with our first ever
full-time administrative officer in place and due to make up his new duties
formally at New Year.''
No premier-league matches have been scheduled for January 6, but Fort William
and Newtonmore cross camans in an all-premier MacAulay Cup tie at the Eilan.
The first-round draw for the top competition, the Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup,
will take place on January 16.
With that, and the Centennial final at the end of the season, there is still a
lot of shinty to come, Cameron's view is that 1996 should produce a fitting
climax to the historic first season of the premier league.

RUGBY League has been quick to deny reports that Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation were given the power to veto player movements in rugby league's
Super League which begins next March, but their protestations will not ease
fears that sport is running short on morality. The sports we love appear to
know no bounds in their willingness to prostitute themselves.
Football is not immune. Indeed, some fear that the game, which accepts hundreds
of millions from satellite television, could come under assault from the money
men who will make greater demands far beyond those which have tinkered with
kick-off times and days on which matches are played.
Even though Rugby League's chief executive, Maurice Lindsay, was protesting
that his sport has not sold control to Murdoch's people, you don't have to be a
cynic to believe sport is heading in the wrong direction. There is no doubt the
hand of satellite television is tightening around sport and Jim Farry, chief
executive of the SFA, said last night: ``I am worried about sport's dependency
culture on media moguls. I see difficult times ahead.''
Another of the most influential players in the Scottish game, Rangers owner
David Murray, feels football's autonomy eventually will come under increasing
threat by television companies. ``Easy targets have already been identified and
picked off,'' he said. ``Television is already calling the shots and Sky
appears to be taking over. I don't see any danger to us at the moment, but we
might not be able to say that in the future.''
Some time in the not-to-distant future there will be a ridiculous number of
channels available to viewers - at a cost, of course - and it is thought Sky
are negotiating with the top clubs in England with a view to offering each of
them their own channels.
Sky Television have paid #87m to create the Super League and reports claimed
that players had signed ``loyalty'' agreements with News Corporation. Such
deals would have allowed the media people the final say in any transfer deals.
``It is nonsense to suggest we have given up control of our sport or any part
of it,'' said Lindsay. ``Claims that the loyalty agreements signed between
players and News Corporation require the players to play wherever News
Corporation say are both unfair and irresponsible.''
He did admit that voluntary loyalty agreements had been signed by players, but
that these will benefit players, clubs, and fans.
Nevertheless, with the advent of satellite television it was inevitable sport
would be corrupted. The process of change has taken another, some might say
sinister, turn with rugby league's agreements and, as Sky's slogan says, there
is no turning back.
Those in football who fear the influence of television companies will recoil in
horror that players in another sport have signed agreements not to play for
teams in a rival rugby league - the Super League is in competiton with
Australian Rugby League - and although they were saying such a distasteful
scenario could never befall the people's game, everyone and everything has a
price. Satellite television is paying hundreds of millions into football on
both sides of the Border.
The more football becomes dependent on satellite television's money, the less
likely the sport is to hold out against new demands. Football is already close
to the point where the money from television companies is greater than gate
receipts and that is a perilous position for any sport.
The day football's administrators first held out their hands and accepted
millions for live coverage of their product was the day some of us realised the
game was up. It all seemed to be happening too quickly and it appeared that not
enough thought was being applied, because people were bewitched by the amounts
offered. The consequences were not properly considered.
It was in the mid-80s that Scottish football accepted around #12m from Sky for
live broadcasting rights and there must always be a price. Sky, who have the
rights to live FA Premier League action because #304m was paid in 1992 - the
rights to the Endsleigh League have just been bought for #125m - are clearly
determined to have it all.
Next time football will receive an even greater sum but their own cost could be
higher. Satellite companies are not throwing money at football because they are
benefactors; they have their own motives and they will ask for more in return.
``It's Citizen Kane gone crazy,'' was the reaction of Leeds United's manager
Howard Wilkinson in The Independent, which carried reports of rugby league's
sell-out. ``Sport has to maintain its independence if it is to maintain its
integrity,'' he added.
Farry does not feel Scottish football is in any immediate danger of being
brought to heel by a television company, but the SFA are like King Canute in
the modern day. While the English authorities have sold their game to live
television, the SFA continue to impose strict restrictions, with Farry pointing
out: ``We are one of the last bastions in that we feel football's interests
should always come first.''
How much longer football will be able to hold out before television people
start interfering with the fundamentals remains to be seen, but the signs are
ominous. There is something to be feared in having media companies tailor an
entire sport to its own needs. Football must resist. The price of failure does
not bear thinking about.

KEVIN McKenzie finally makes his district debut this season, the Stirling
County hooker displacing his clubmate Rob Cairney in the North and Midlands
side to face Edinburgh at Meggetland on Friday night.
McKenzie is joined by fellow Bridgehaugh men Mark McKenzie and Kenny Harper at
half back, lock Stewart Hamilton and No.8 Gareth Flockhart, all of whom return
to the district side after missing the match against Scottish Exiles at
Rubislaw last Sunday.
Flockhart comes in for the luckless Martin Waite, who had a useful match
against the Exiles.
Other than the return of the Stirling players and the consequent reversion to
the side that played against South, the only change is at right wing where Neil
Renton is preferred to Simon Burns. North and Midlands side:
R Shepherd (Melrose); N Renton (Kirkcaldy), P Rouse (Dundee HSFP), A Carruthers
(Kirkcaldy), J Kerr (Watsonians); M McKenzie (Stirling County), K Harper
(Stirling County); W Anderson (Stirling County), K McKenzie (Stirling County),
D Herrington (Kirkcaldy), S Grimes (Watsonians), S Hamilton (Stirling County),
D McIvor (Edinburgh Acads) captain, G Flockhart (Stirling County), R Wainwright
(West Hartlepool).Replacements: S Burns (Edinburgh Academicals), B Easson
(Boroughmuir), M Fraser (Stirling County), M Waite (Edinburgh Academicals), A
Penman (Grangemouth), R Cairney (Stirling County).
q LAST night's under-21 inter-district championships - North/Midlands v
Scottish Exiles and Edinburgh v South - were postponed because of heavy frost
on the back pitch at Murrayfield.
A statement issued by the Scottish Rugby Union said: ``Endeavours were made to
find an alternative venue, but without success.
``The international pitch has not been on stand-by for these particular
matches.''
The main pitch at Murrayfield, however, will be on stand-by for the senior
inter-district championship matches on Friday (North and Midlands v Scottish
Exiles) and Sunday (South v Glasgow).
q NEW Zealand wing Jonah Lomu, who dashed England's World Cup dream by scoring
four tries in their semi-final clash, has been voted player of the year by the
Rugby Writers' Club.

GEC LOOKED poised last night to win a crucial #2500m submarine contract as the
Government came under fire for ``smuggling out'' the announcement days before
Christmas.
Defence Ministry officials confirmed that GEC-Marconi had been selected as
preferred bidder for up to five of a new class of nuclear-powered submarines.
The decision could prove a damaging blow to Britain's sole submarine
manufacturer, VSEL, and have serious ramifications for the future make-up of
the British warship industry. GEC owns both VSEL and Yarrow shipbuilders on the
Clyde.
Both GEC and VSEL submitted bids to build the submarines a week after GEC
defeated British Aerospace to buy VSEL, based at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
This produced a curious battle with a parent company competing against a
subsidiary.
Defence officials were astonished to read the respective bids - and discover
GEC bidding with a much more creative design at significantly less cost.
News of the decision leaked out when Labour's John Hutton (Barrow and Furness)
raised a point of order in the Commons.
Mr Hutton said: ``Involvement in this contract is absolutely essential for the
future of VSEL and for the jobs of thousands of my constituents.
``The Government's decision today will, at the very least, create unwelcome
uncertainty about the future of VSEL, where nearly 10,000 jobs have already
been lost.''
An MoD official said the GEC tender offered the best value for money and best
matched the technical compliance requirements.
Negotiations would now begin with a view to awarding the contract late next
year.
Although VSEL is the only British yard capable of producing an entire submarine
from design to launch, GEC proposed a novel solution.
It argued that individual sections - hoops - could be manufactured in different
parts of the country, then brought together at a yard such as VSEL for final
assembly.
The system has been used in Sweden for constructing conventionally-powered
submarines for some years.
It is expected that GEC will carry out final assembly work on the submarines at
VSEL.
However, the majority of the work will be carried out at different sites around
the country and the impact on the VSEL yard could be significant.

JIM Park, the national coach, is disappointed that less than half the Scottish
squad have accepted invitations to a training camp in Florida in February.
A fortnight in the Fort Lauderdale sun may seem an attractive proposition, but
only four of the 10-strong squad, Alison Sheppard and Forbes Dunlop, from
Milngavie and Bearsden, and Stirling University pair, Kerry Martin and Pauline
McLean, will be on the plane on February 5.
The Scottish Amateur Swimming Association arranged the trip on the basis that
it would provide an ideal training opportunity in the final build-up to the
Olympic trials in Sheffield at the end of March.
``It is a great chance for the swimmers to get away from home pressures and
focus on training, and I would certainly have liked more swimmers to accept,''
said Park. ``Some have complained that it is too close to the Olympic trials,
but I don't agree.
``It is disappointing, but we do want to stay flexible and the association will
be providing funding for those who have made alternative arrangements.''
That category includes Richard Hope and younger sister, Kirsty, who will join
Milngavie and Bearsden's Sheppard, Jamie McNeil, Tom Griffith, and Douglas
Forrest on a club trip to Arizona a week today, and Arbroath's Cameron Black,
who also is going to the US next week.
But Commonwealth Games medallist Fraser Walker is one Scot who has decided on a
stay-at-home policy. The 22-year-old has been training with Warrington this
season, and he explained: ``I went to Lanzarote with the Scottish squad last
year and came home ill. I can't afford that to happen again.''

I AM sure many readers will view with abhorrence the dispute about the
selection of a prospective Labour candidate for Govan.
I am bound to say my sympathies are with Mike Watson. After all he is a sitting
MP whose seat in Glasgow Central has been squeezed out by the reduction in the
number of Glasgow parliamentary constituencies.
He has been an excellent MP and it would be unfair if his parliamentary career
were to be cut short while he is still a relatively young man.
I am all in favour of ethnic minorities being represented at Westminster but
not at the expense of sitting MPs. Mr Sarwar should have waited until a
suitable seat became available.
The Labour Party is free of racism. In Glasgow as elsewhere the party has gone
out of its way to avoid the accusation of racism in its selection of
candidates. The full-time officers of the Labour Party in Scotland supervised
the count in Govan in accordance with the party rules.
Mr Sarwar has the right to query the selection of Mike Watson and appeal to the
National Executive committee. Doubtless he willl avail himself of this right
but it does not help having George Galloway, MP for Hillhead, taking sides. He
should have kept out of the controversy.

PETE Sampras and Steffi Graf have been named world champions by the
International Tennis Federation.
This is the third time Sampras has won the award, while Graf was named for the
sixth time in the past nine years.
Sampras won Wimbledon and the US Open, each for the third time, and was
runner-up in the Australian Open. He won three other tournaments and led the
USA to victory in the Davis Cup.
Graf won the three Grand Slam tournaments she entered: the French, Wimbledon,
and US Open. She also won the season-ending WTA Tour Championship and suffered
only two defeats during the year.
``Pete Sampras and Steffi Graf have played exceptional tennis, especially at
the majors,'' said ITF president Brian Tobin. ``They fully deserve to be
recognised again as the best of the best.''

IS there any particular reason why Christian churchmen choose to go to war, at
least in the pages of the press, during what they claim is a season of
universal goodwill? Two years ago it was the Virgin Birth controversy, now it
is the question of asylum and immigration.
I suspect that most people are willing to accept that asylum should be offered
to those in genuine need but all sorts of tales are currently circulating in
Central Scotland about illegal economic immigration and it is this, real or
imagined, that causes anxiety.
When spokesmen for the Muslim Parliament declare our system of democracy
corrupt and redundant and, in effect, set up a state within a state obedient
only to Islamic Law, anxieties increase.
To people who are worried, Andrew McLellan's words (``I want Britain to be
proud, strong, principled, brave, free, and generous'') may sound a little bit
like King Vortigern addressing some timorous subjects who want Hengist and
Horsa sent packing (December 18).
I feel that this whole matter cannot be clearly and properly discussed because
of various shades of political correctness as well as fear and suspicion of
``the alien in our midst''. If we could address our moral and economic problems
more effectively, perhaps such anxieties would diminish.
It does seem rich, however, that the descendants of the Dalriads, who boast
today that they are scattered over the face of the earth to the effect that
there are more people of Scots descent out of Scotland than in it, should make
such a fuss about immigration and the threat to their way of life.

I WAS interested to read the letter, The whisky trail in London (December 14).
Certainly it would seem that the British Tourist Authority is biased in favour
of English tourism. However, as many tourists intending to visit Scotland will
enter the UK at London Airport, they could do worse than start the whisky trail
in London.
Some of the London shops stock a wide range of malts and some years ago when I
lived in London I sometimes found rare malts more easy to obtain in London than
in Scotland.
Although whisky is not made in London now, some was in the nineteenth century.
According to Barnard (1887), the Lea Valley Distillery, Stratford, London, made
305,000 gallons of grain whisky, and 155,000 gallons of malt whisky, annually.
However, the distillery closed down in 1902. For some years the buildings were
occupied by paint manufacturers but they were demolished some years ago.
In Barnard's time there were also whisky distilleries in Bristol and Liverpool.
At that time, the English whisky could be blended with Scottish whiskies and
the blend sold as Scotch. Now, a whisky could not be described as Scotch if it
contained any English spirit.

SO THERE is now a rebellion threatened by the clubs as they sense the whiff of
a major upset. Ah yes, if ever there was a time for the clubs to be the SRU,
and the reverse, then this is it. What a great deal of political back-watching
we are about to see.
It's not the staff, it's some of the wallies on the various committees that
perplex the Diary. Urgent and drastic streamlining is needed for an accountable
SRU.
You see, it's not the Bill Hoggs of this world who are the problem, it's the
rather obvious queue of unemployable nitwits who would quite fancy Bill Hogg's
post itself if they could ever oust the man from his seat. Whether they could
or not is open to question, but it would be a big mistake.
Just like the Tory government, the SRU has to divide itself between
``operational'' and ``policy'' matters. No-one is slagging off the operational
side too much. It's the policy tossers that need sorted out. There are some
good guys, no doubt. But only the SRU would look to some of the dead wood
that's there for advice.
Frankly, it's embarrassing.
q Glasgow's rugby clubs are examining their individual agendas over the coming
weeks to see what lies ahead for the city, and the Diary understands that Andy
Little, GHK's director of rugby, is penning a paper for the club on how he sees
the future at Old Anniesland.
``It's deep-thought time,'' says Brian Simmers at Glasgow Accies. ``We spoke
with GHK two years ago, but it was decided then that amalgamation was not the
way ahead, which is why we got Kevin Greene. That's the way it still stands and
I am happy at that.
``All the clubs need to have a clear idea of where they want to go.''
The Diary understands that talks among the Glasgow clubs are imminent. Many of
the clubs in the city are ambitious, and with the advent of eight-team leagues,
the need for at least one team in the top division is paramount.
q WHEN Glasgow played Connaught at the weekend, two of the Glasgow committee
were invited to preview the match by taking part in a discussion on the local
radio station with the Connaught coach and captain.
``Tell me, Tom,'' said the Irish interviewer to Tom Morrice, one of our brave
Glasgow chappies. ``What style of rugby do you play now?''
``Oh,'' replied our flustered hero, perhaps unsure of the rigours of live
broadcasting, ``I haven't played rugby for a while. I gave the game up years
ago.''
Muffled laughter all round.
q HEARD at a mini rugby game as uttered last weekend by an anxious mother
standing on the touchlines, her side having just made an error of dazzling
proportions - ``Come on, Dalziel, catch a grip of yourselves.''
The next mistake was severely punished. ``Come on, Dalziel,'' said the mother.
``You're as bad as . . . Strathaven.'' We must now see the Strathaven mini
rugby team in action.
q THE Diary can reveal exclusively that a club touch-rugby competition is to
come to Glasgow this summer for those that are interested.
It's worth noting that the Edinburgh clubs took part last summer and Glasgow's
did not. Various venues are being examined, and the City of Glasgow is to get
involved in the shape and form of Ken McEwan and some dosh.
q THERE I was walking along Great Western Road on Tuesday, when an enormous
great big Jaguar stopped and rolled down its window.
Seated within were Jimmy Martin and Bill Dunlop of GHK. ``What are you doing
out?'' asked Martin, the GHK president. ``I thought you were dead.''
When he said ``thought'' I think he meant hoped. Nice friends.

OU carried two articles on teachers (December 15) . One on the gratifying
clearing of Mr Thomas McGhee over false accusations of assaulting his pupils,
the other commenting on the brave actions of teachers in the horrific
Middlesborough stabbings.
Your reports, obviously, made no links; please allow me to do so. I would
suggest that most of us in the teaching profession are the caring and dedicated
people typified by the Middlesborough three and the recently murdered Head, Mr
Lawrence.
However, this is not currently widely recognised or reported. We are those who
regularly ``fail'' our pupils if politicians are to be believed. We are those
used as party political footballs subject to the throwaway comment.
For example, the normally laudable Mr Blair, Leader of the Labour Party,
recently said that when he comes to power there will be zero tolerance of
failure.
I realise that like any other human beings teachers are prone to failure at
times. However, Mr Blair's zero tolerance phrase is borrowed from another place.
Does he really see teachers in the same category as drunken men who regularly
and systematically beat their womenfolk to a pulp?
We live in a day of trumpeted pupil and parental rights. Don't teachers have
feelings and rights, too? It's surely time to give credit where it's due and to
redress a clear imbalance.
