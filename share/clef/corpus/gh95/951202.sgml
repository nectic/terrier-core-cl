CHESS
Following his lacklustre 50% score in the Credit Suisse Masters in October,
Gary Kasparov bounced back to win his next tournament, the Intel Rapid Chess
Grand Prix event in Paris (November 9-12). In Paris, Kasparov was devastating.
Although he lost the first game in the final against Vladimir Kramnik, he won
the second game and then the play-off Blitz decider to take first prize both in
this event and the 1995 Grand Prix series as a whole.
Kasparov had some good fortune in the semi-final against Vishy Anand, who
uncharacteristcally defaulted in the first game of the two-game tie. Poor Anand
apparently confused the French for 1pm (treize heures), thinking the tie began
at 3pm. Frantic organisers could not at first track him down in his hotel, as
he had gone out for a pre-game stroll.
The French spectators had plenty to to be proud about. Their top player, Joel
Lautier, also got through to the semi-finals, only to lose 1!s-!s to Kramnik.
But the revelation of the event was the remarkable play of 12-year-old French
junior, Etienne Bacrot. Kramnik had a very hard time defeating him in an
earlier round, and in this tie also conceded one draw.
Rapid Chess is played at a rate of 25 minutes per player per game. Two games
are played at this rate, followed by sudden death Blitz games in the event of a
1-1 tie. In the Blitz games, White gets 5 and Black 4 minutes, with White
having to win and Black only to draw to decide the outcome.
Even the best players make frequent mistakes under this sort of pressure. But
to win requires a great deal of skill. Gary Kasparov was clearly ready for his
opponent in the following game and won superbly.
White: A. Morosevich
Black: G. Kasparov
Intel Rapid Chess Grand Prix, Paris 1995
King's Gambit Accepted
1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 Nf3 d6
This was Bobby Fischer's famous ``bust'' of the King's Gambit, which he
advocated in an openings article in 1961. The old move, and by no means a bad
alternative, is 3 . . . g5. Fischer called 3 . . . d6 a ``high class waiting
move''. It was aimed primarily at preventing the respected Kieseritzky
Variation (3 . . . g5 4 h4 g4 5 Ne5), Spassky's favourite, with which he beat
Fischer in Mar del Plata in 1960.
4 d4 g5 5 h4 g4 6 Ng5?!
The main line given by Joe Gallagher in his excellent Batsford openings book
Winning with the King's Gambit, is the rather strange retreat 6 Ng1. I doubt
whether this move really gives White anything, but if White can wrest control
of f4, even at the expense of a pawn, he can cause problems resulting from the
weaknesses in the Black kingsde pawn structure (h7, g4 and f7).
6 . . . h6!
Fischer thought Black could refute White's play by 6 . . . f6, and if 7 Nh3
gxh3 8 Qh5+ Kd7 9 Bxf4 Qe8 10 Qf3 Kd8. I expect Morosevich had some new idea in
mind, but Kasparov gets his new move in first.
7 Nxf7
This sacrifice is often dangerous in such positions, but Kasparov appears to
have drawn its sting in this particular line.
7 . . . Kxf7 8 Bxf4 Bg7 9 Bc4+ Ke8 10 0-0 Nc6 11 Be3?!
Possibly better is 11 c3, so that if 11 . . . Qxh4 12 g3 is playable. Now Black
can grab White's h-pawn with impunity.
11 . . . Qxh4 12 Rf7 Rh7!
White may have missed this move, which allows Black to hold on to his extra
piece without compromising the safety of his king. Without any clear target in
Black's position, White is probably already lost.
13 e5 Na5 14 Bd3 Kxf7 15 Qf1+ Ke7 16 Bxh7 Be6 17 Nd2 Rf8 18 exd6+ cxd6 19 Qe2
Kd8 20 c3 Ne7 21 Re1?!
White has a lost game, but this move allows an immediate end.
21 . . . Bc4 22 Bf2
Or if 22 Nxc4 g3 and Black mates on h2.
22 . . . Rxf2 23 Qxf2 g3 White resigns
Once again White faces mate on h2 or hopeless material loss.

THEY used to have bells, then it was sirens and then electronic wah-wah sound
generators like those in US police car chases. But ambulances, it seems, have a
directional problem. They could be putting people in danger just because while
the driver knows where he happens to be going, the siren sound doesn't let
pedestrians and drivers know where it's coming from.
Dr Deb Withington of Sound Alert in Leeds has a solution to the problem, and
it's almost a silent one at that.
``We can't localise ambulance sounds because there's not enough information in
it for the human's brain to get a directional fix. You get it wrong 56% of the
time, so if you hear an ambulance, it's most likely to be coming in the
opposite direction than you believe. That makes it dangerous at road junctions
when an emergency vehicle is speeding along. Car drivers have a particular
problem in getting a fix on the sound, and it is they who really need to get
out of the way . .  and fast.''
``I work on sound localisation and we've been testing people on the state of
the art driving simulator at Leeds University. You need to test people while
they're driving to replicate as close as possible the normal conditions. We
looked at existing sirens and tried a whole range of noises. Most people get
the direction wrong. We worked out that it was the sound component that is a
problem, so we've altered it.
``We believe our new sound does a better job. A siren must grab your attention.
There's lots of data about what makes an alerting sound. Fire engines
occasionally use an air horn which is better than the normal ambulance sound as
far as pinpointing is concerned.''
The problem so far has been preference . . . for American cop car chase movies.
Withington says: ``People like electronic sounds, but whoever designed them
just didn't have a clue. The makers say it's a big seller in the US and people
think that's fine, believing that what's good for America, must be good for us.
But you still can't tell where the noise is coming from and it's always a good
idea for pedestrians and ambulances to be able to locate a fast-moving
emergency vehicle, to get out of the way, or to ensure they don't impede its
progress.
``We have developed a sound with an alerting tone, like the wah-wah, but that's
followed by a burst of white noise, a bit like sound interference on the
television screen a `sshhh' sound which is a broad band locator, and much
easier for the human ear to pinpoint.
``Our company was set up with DTI money to try to make a better ambulance
siren, and we believe we've got it right. Existing manufacturers are beating a
path to our door, so we know we've succeeded. There are many uses and many
safety applications in having an alarm sound that the human ear can pinpoint.
``We have ambulance, police and fire services on our side. Police forces have
had a play on our simulator and they want the system desperately. It helps them
get to a scene much quicker because traffic gets out of the way. We have
patented the system.''
Strangely, Withington says that as far as emergency sound location is
concerned, the old-fashioned clanging bell was much more efficient on the human
ear than the US import. Now we will have the jarring generator followed by a
pianissimo hush to tell us to get out of the way.
Good for new technology, but we still have a fondness for the old idea, beloved
of primary children, where the young ambulance recruit just yells out of the
window when he's passing his own street: ``It's me, maw . . . me maw . . . me
maw.''
n RUGBY world champions South Africa have been using high technology to keep
them ahead of the game. They've created a new application for the JVC
Professional video system which gives them the edge over the other teams.
The South Africans wanted a minute analysis of the opposing teams and the
formulation of winning game plans. When they ran on to the pitch against
Australia in May, they knew exactly what they were up against, and how to
combat it.
Because they had seen their opponents play over and over again on video. The
JVC Professional system's dynamic variable playback tracking allowed them to
study the way different teams and individual players moved, defended and
attacked. The system's slow-motion capability allowed them to break down the
moves, and the team could even watch the results in their hotel televisions on
the night before the match.
When the Springboks played the All Blacks, they had big Jonah Lomu's moves off
pat, down to which leg he used to start off running, which hand he caught with,
how many strides he took before changing the ball from one hand to the other.
They had him sussed.
Maybe Scotland's team should get in on the hi-tech act. It seems a surer bet
than sending men in bunnets to spy from the sidelines.
n PHILIPS have launched a new VCR range which dispels the user-unfriendly
reputation of players, most of which are unprogrammable by anyone beyond
puberty.
The new four-head VR 757 nicam deck features Videoplus and PDC plus jog shuttle
on both the remote control and front panel.
It's the first to feature Philips EasyLink which the company say makes it the
most user friendly on the market. It's a digital software connection that
automatically downloads channel information from compatible TVs to the video
decks.
The machine comes with a turbo-drive winder which spools an entire 180-minute
tape in just 95 seconds. It also has Videoplus programming and a six-event
memory for up to 15 hours of continuous play. It's selling now at #430.
Sounds simple enough even for adults.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN LOWS
n THE 10-hour flight to Denver, plus a few hours stopover, is a bit of a drag.
n Meals are massive and the quality, range, and availability of food excellent.
Be prepared to return with an increased waist measurement.
n The altitude of around 10,000ft can be a problem. You will find yourself out
of puff after walking up stairs, never mind after blasting down a double black
diamond bump run. The benefit is that when you get back to Scotland you can ski
almost all day without getting tired.
As darkening snow clouds over Scotland herald a new ski season, Weekend Extra
presents Ski Special. First
up on the piste is Fergus Wyllie, who travels to
Colorado to discover a world a million miles away
from the snaking queues and monosyllabic lifties
of Europe. Can it really be as good as it sounds?
ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGHS
n No one thing makes skiing in America so good. It is a combination of varied,
immaculately prepared runs, no lift queues, friendly, efficient staff, and
great food and drink at reasonable prices. The attitude of everyone is such a
refreshing change from Europe.
n All Colorado resorts are terrific but I fell in love with Copper Mountain.
The views and the relaxed atmosphere make it a pleasure to visit.
n Breckenridge is superb for nightlife. It has everything from rough, tough
cowboy saloons to super smooth restaurants.
THE buses said it all about Colorado skiing. To a background of rock music, the
cheerful and friendly drivers talked to passengers over a loudspeaker,
informing them of the next stop, asking who was getting off where, and giving
details about connecting buses. Oh, and they were free.
The service could not be better. Just like the skiing. Whether you like steep
and deep or wide and glide, Colorado has it in spades. It is the equal of
anything Europe can offer but the good old US of A is streets (or should it be
pistes?) ahead on organisation, efficiency, and courtesy.
The nightlife is varied and terrific, food and drink are of a much higher
quality than here (and usually cheaper), and almost everyone is helpful and
friendly. Am I giving the impression that I liked it? Too bloody right. Adored
it more like.
I stayed in the small town of Frisco, a few miles from the ski resorts of
Breckenridge, Keystone, Arapahoe Basin, and Copper Mountain. Across the road
from my hotel was a stop for the Summit Stage buses. Complete with ski racks,
they are operated by the county with financial help from the resorts and make
it very easy and painless to make full use of the Breck lift pass which also
covers Keystone and A-Basin. Check the local patois, dude.
My first stop was Breckenfridge, as it's known locally, and boy did it live up
to its nickname. The cold on the trails (pistes), which rise to nearly
12,000ft, was much worse than anything Scotland has to offer. My face was not
as much pinched by the cold as punched. And that was with hardly any windchill.
After every run, my companions and I checked each others' faces for white
patches of frostnip.
Our faces may have been cold but our welcome was warm. The lifties were
amazingly friendly, helping you on to the chairs, asking how you were, and
encouraging you to ``have a good one''. Obsequious Americans after your cash,
you might say, but they really seemed to mean it. It was definitely altitude
without attitude.
And so well organised, so efficient. Each chair has a rope ``maze'' in which up
to six queues of skiers merge into four, then two, and finally one. At each
junction, the ``Please alternate'' signs are rigorously observed and it is
almost a pleasure to queue. There is a separate queue for single skiers and
even strategically placed boxes of paper hankies with which to wipe damp noses.
Visiting French and Italians must be horrified.
The super quads (four-person chairs) move an amazing amount of people up the
hill very quickly. You progress through what appears to be a huge queue in no
time at all. Our longest wait was an untypical 15 minutes at a quad chair
beside the main ticket office on a very busy Sunday.
But what about the skiing? Awesome just about sums it up. Breck's 126 trails
vary from immaculately groomed, motorway-wide greens to steep, deep, and
mega-bumpy double black diamonds. Whereas European pistes tend to be longer,
fewer, and more crowded, the Americans cut a linked system of runs through the
trees which cover most of the resorts up to almost 12,000ft.
This offers endless options of route and means that, even on a busy day, it is
not unusual to have large sections to yourself. Don't get the idea that the
Breck trails are all short. One of the resort's four peaks claims to have a
three-and-a-half mile run although I suspect this may involve a 40-minute walk
to the summit.
If you are a bump fiend, this is the place for you. They are much more
plentiful than in Europe and it is not uncommon to have one-third of the width
of a run left as moguls while the other two-thirds are groomed. It means you
can bale out of the bumps if the going gets too tough and also that parties of
mixed ability can stay together with some skiing moguls while others cruise the
smooth.
One of my favourite Breck trails was the single black diamond Cimaron, a long,
fast race run which screams down the full length of the mountain. The majority
was groomed but the bumps had been left to grow in one or two places at the
side of the trail. On my third day in Breck, overnight snowfall had left
slightly heavy but very skiable powder on parts of Cimaron and my morning was a
blur of blasting through thigh-deep piles of white delight.
Breck is a beginner's dream. The wide, smooth, easy trails have an amazing
quality of snow and must be the ideal place to learn to ski. The only drawback
is the cost of classes - about #120 for six days. The facilities for children
are excellent.
A fenced-off area not only has safety nets at the end of the short runs but
also conveyor belts to bring the little ones back to the the top of the runs.
When they venture forth on the slopes, the munchkins in each ski class wear
balloons of the same colour tied to their backs, presumably for recognition
rather than elevation. But it's not cheap - #150 for six days including lunch.
Not only do the Americans know how to groom trails, they know how to name them.
Devil's Crotch, High Anxiety, and Sizzler conjure up quite accurate images and
certainly make for an interesting trail map. Goodbye Girl, a short but very
steep double black diamond trail, almost became Goodbye Boy for yours truly
when I picked my way down it through large bumps in deep, heavy snow. Scary or
what.
If I needed a few fingers of red-eye to calm my shattered nerves, Breck was the
place to provide it. The nightlife in what was once a Victorian gold and silver
mining town is just as good as the skiing. Its traditional wooden buildings
house some terrific bars and restaurants and, surprise, surprise, everyone is
really friendly.
Among the best were the Breckenridge Brewery and the Whale's Tail. The Brewery
bar and restaurant makes its own ales right before your eyes. They  bubble away
in 20ft metal vats behind the bar as you stagger your way through the six brews
- ranging from oatmeal stout to the aptly-named Avalanche lager. And the food's
good too.
Mind you, it is even better in the Whale's Tail seafood restaurant. Three
friends and I all had superb mixed grills of salmon, mako shark, and prawns,
plus vegetables, followed by desert, which, washed down with a litre of house
wine, worked out at #20 a head. That was our most expensive meal in Colorado
and, believe me, we ate well.
The excellent quality, even in fast food restaurants, and the enormous helpings
make it much better value than Scotland. Add this to the conspicuous
cleanliness and you wonder what our catering industry is playing at.
A culinary highlight of Frisco was Smithwick's Bar-B-Q Shack, and it was a real
shack, where we ate buffalo in hickory sauce from plastic plates with plastic
knives and forks. The waiter said it had been cooked for 40 hours and I
believed him. It was absolutely gorgeous.
After three days of skiing Breck, we jumped on to the free bus for the short
ride to Copper Mountain. Perhaps it was the glorious sunshine, or the lunchtime
Buds, but the beauty of this resort stole my heart. The towering peaks of the
Rockies were so white and the Colorado sky so brilliantly blue that it almost
hurt.
What definitely did hurt was plunging headfirst down the double black diamond
Triple Zero in Spaulding Bowl after my skis decided to stop dead in a lump of
heavy snow. Luckily, it was my pride that suffered most as I picked my way back
up to give my errant Dynastars a good thrashing.
My reason for attempting this very difficult bump-packed bowl was not bravado
but because it was the only way to reach Crosscut, a single black diamond run
that swooped magnificently through the forest below the bowl. Steep it was but
groomed as smooth as a baby's bottom. Just right for big GS turns and zooming
all the way down.
Although not as big as Breck, Copper Mountain has 98 trails which tend to be
longer and perhaps more scenic. Another of my favourites was Triple Treat, a
black run whose bumps were not too difficult and interspersed with groomed
areas for a quick blast. It led to the bottom of A lift, which must have been
the quietest chair in Colorado when we were there. Mind you, the sun-bathing
lifties did not seem to mind getting up every 20 minutes or so to help us on.
We ate lunch in the Clubhouse, right at the bottom of B lift. The food was
plentiful and cheap, the service excellent, and the only problem was trying to
persuade yourself to stop soaking up rays and Buds and hit the slopes again.
The next day, we moved on to Loveland, a small ski area which does not normally
figure on British holiday itineraries. It is about twice the size of Cairngorm
with a good selection of trails ranging from steep bump runs to smooth
cruisers. It is well worth a visit if you want a change from the big resorts.
And talking of big resorts, there is Vail. With more than 4000 skiable acres
and a lift capacity of 42,720 skiers per hour, it is huge with a capital H. The
121 trails are the usual Colorado mix of easy and difficult but it is the seven
back bowls that set it apart from the other resorts on our tour. They are so
massive that you could share one with 1000 skiers and not be within 100yards of
anyone. The snow was deep and slightly heavy when we were there but the mainly
black runs were still enjoyable. In powder, they must be heaven on earth.
Now the bad news. Although Vail is très chic and classy, it is much more
expensive and not nearly as friendly as Breck. After days of chatting to
lifties, it was quite a shock to be greeted with silence at Vail. Where did
they think they were, for goodness sake, Cairngorm?
Keystone was our next stop. Its 53 trails are full of character and flow over
three heavily wooded peaks. The double black diamond woodland skiing was better
than anything in Europe and I will never forget the thrills and spills when
Timberwolf showed its teeth. Boarders are banned from Keystone which has the
added attraction of floodlit skiing on 13 trails until 9pm. The Outpost Lodge,
12,444ft up on the North Peak, is a great place to eat not only because of the
food. Built of huge pine logs, it has all the atmosphere of a forest cabin
complete with a massive open fire.
A 15-minute bus ride away from Keystone is Arapahoe Basin with 61 trails. The
East Wall area has powder when everywhere else is hard packed and it was
thigh-deep for our visit. A short walk is necessary to get to the best trails
but that was the last thing on my mind as I whooped my way down Corner Chute
and North Pole Plunge leaving billowing clouds of powder in my wake.
The steep mogul runs off the Palivacinni chair are mega difficult and will
satisfy the most demanding bump fiend. I decided discretion was the better part
of valour and left them well alone lest more than my heart was broken at having
to leave Colorado after 12 days of glorious skiing.
There are only two disadvantages about Colorado. One is the long journey -
eight hours from Glasgow to Chicago and two hours to Denver - followed by a
two-hour bus trip to Breckenridge. The other is the fact that you will be
absolutely determined to return, come hell or high dollar against the pound.
Yes, the best skiing in the world is not overpriced, not overrated, and over
there.

IT was the way David Sole dismissed the Scottish Rugby Union that impressed me.
After his ``tantamount to cheating'' allegation following Edinburgh Accies'
game against Melrose, he first told the SRU that he would not be able to come
and meet them because of ``baby sitting duties,'' and then a statement from
Edinburgh Accies said that it would now be very difficult for David to slot in
time to his schedule to talk to the SRU over the coming weeks because of a
hectic ``social diary.''
Wonderful. Like Sole I have had some real snash from folk at the SRU in my time
- the last one was in Paris when a nobody had a drunken go and to my eternal
relief I didn't punch his lights out - and I have sympathy for David's
predicament.
He was once called ``a cancer in Scottish rugby'' after, you may remember,
captaining a Grand Slam winning team.
David's not the most normal person in the world, but you have to admire the guy
and know that he says what he thinks.
What folk in the public don't realise is that when someone outside the SRU
criticises the set-up, the bearded nobodies take it personally.
You see, many of the blokes in the SRU are on their own personal, one-man
crusade to become the president. Bill Hogg's not.
I like him, but he doesn't like me, which was quite obvious from his early
morning call the other day. Goodness, the man has a strong voice in the early
morning.
I doubt whether David believes that blokes who are on a one-man crusade to be
SRU president have the class to be sitting in judgment of him.
I was at the game when David had his outburst. His side had just lost. The end
of the match had been a farce. Accies were being penalised and then penalised
again as time was running out. In fact time had run out.
As a neutral, and I was a neutral, I thought that something fishy was going on.
Now, I may have been wrong, and I am prepared to accept completely that I am
wrong, but that's what it looked like to me.
A penalty means that time carries on. Anything else stops the game.
The insinuation in David's remarks is that there was cheating going on.
Many thought that was happening, others did not, but only David, as is David's
way, had the guts to say what he thought.
What I'm about to say is probably vastly unfair, but I think it happened in the
past.
I remember going down to the borders to play rugby, and having the incredible
bad luck to have a borders referee on the day.
It seemed to me at that time as a player from Glasgow that the borders referee
would bend over backwards to ignore misdemeanors from the local players, and
keep an extra eye open for our infringements. The local players would bend,
grovel, and handle all day and get off with it. Hey, not that we ever
infringed, you understand.
Now, I am equally sure that borders teams have come up to the cities in the
past, seen a city referee, and then reckoned that they were harshly done by.
David Sole was in a rage after the game. But, it seems to me, nobody has had
the guts to ask the question: Was he right, or was he wrong? The neutrality of
Scottish referees is such a holy subject that you daren't ask the question.
I believe in this case we have to ask that question and find an answer. Maybe
to mollify it we have to ask the question as to whether this was a dreadful
display on the day or not.
OK, David's comments didn't look good in print, but we must surely find out if
he had a case. It was a fraught time.
It is my earnest belief in this one that the SRU have to do the unthinkable,
and examine the game in detail, before they ask Sole in again to ``explain
himself.''
The SRU must launch an investigation into the match to find out if a referee
did become emotionally involved in a game of rugby to the detriment of one of
the teams. Border TV have, I believe, the whole game on video.
For Edinburgh Accies, forty or fifty thousand pounds rode on that game.
That was a big-time game. Sole coaches Edinburgh Accies forwards, their under
21s, and he takes mini rugby on a Sunday. He could and should play a major role
in rugby's future.
He lost his cool on the day. It has now degenerated into posturing. Go on SRU,
ask the unacceptable question.

SHARES in British Biotech continued to soar yesterday having reached #21
briefly in New York overnight although there was one trade of 10,000 shares at
#26. That followed almost hysterical reaction on Thursday of positive clinical
trials for one of its anti-cancer drugs, Marimastat.
This is an oral drug apparently suitable for ovarian, prostatic, colorectal and
pancreatic cancers. It has been involved in tests for eight types of different
cancers.
However, British Biotech has been anxious to play down the initial discoveries
although it has also seen progress with lung and gastric cancers. It pointed
out that it will take some years to complete all the tests sufficient to get
full approvals but analysts are enthusiastic enough to suggest that it could be
a #700m-a-year product.
The shares came off the top and eventually closed 127p better at 1675p compared
with a year's low of 423p.

with Prozac, a widely prescribed anti-depressant drug, after tests showed it
made them less apathetic and more sociable.
Sit-up record
BEIJING: A six-year-old boy in east China's Shandong province set a national

EXTRA prize money has ensured that the William Hill Handicap Hurdle at Sandown
this afternoon has a much larger field than last year, and Squire Silk could be
the one to help punters in their struggle with the sponsors.
He was caught for stamina at Chepstow but should have no such problem over this
shorter trip and better going. Andrew Turnell's hurdler beat Bookcase at
Newbury, giving away two stone, and on that form holds Lonesome Train.
Viking Flagship should be favourite for the Tingle Creek Chase on last year's
form. He beat Travado and Nakir when winning this event last year, and the time
of his victory in the Queen Mother Chase was a fraction better than Sound Man
in the ``Arkle'' the previous day.
However, Sound Man comes to the contest fit and showed progression when he won
by a distance at Ascot. I will take a gamble on him taking the measure of his
older rivals.
At Chepstow, Master Oats has the Rehearsal Chase at his mercy. Kim Bailey's
champion won on his reappearance in this event last season and went on to prove
himself the best chaser in training.
Bradbury Star is the only rival in the handicap proper but his disappointing
performance first time out does not suggest he is capable of an upset today.
Mad Thyme won his first two chases last year (General Wolfe well behind at
Uttoxeter), before failing to make the grade in the top class. His early exit
on his reappearance means he starts fresh today, and I will take a sporting bet
on him upsetting Greenhill Tare Away in the Jack Brown Chase.
Beachy Head raced in good company last season and shaped well on his
reappearance. He can land the Emmerdale Chase at Wetherby where he has won over
course and distance.

I READ the news today. Oh boy. That's how the Beatles put it, and after a week
when I've been mugged in spectacular fashion by certain sections of the media,
I certainly know how they felt.
If you're wise and have restricted your reading habits to sensible papers then
you won't know what I'm talking about.
If not, then you'll know that after my performance against Melrose last
weekend, I got the kind of reviews that are normally reserved for child
molesters or Michael Forsyth. One comic, which masquerades as a middle-market
tabloid, even devoted a double-page spread to my shortcomings.
I wonder if that's what their readers want? Let's get one thing straight. I
played an absolute shocker last weekend and I don't need the media, or
team-mates, or Stirling County ``supporters'' to tell me that.
When the going gets tough you certainly find out who your friends are and over
the past week, I have had to think long and hard about my priorities and my
rugby. The game is moving into fresh pastures and the ground-rules seem to have
changed. As players we are going to have to give serious thought to whom we
talk to and when.
I've always been a media-friendly player. I've never turned down a request for
an interview. Basically, I like a blether and I like speaking about rugby. I've
enjoyed the high profile that goes with being a Scotland player and, although
some might disagree, I think it's good for the game.
There comes a time, though, when you have to be a bit more careful and on your
guard, and that time is now. As rugby moves into the professional era this is a
learning process for all of us involved.
Don't get me wrong, tall trees catch the most wind and if you are a Scottish
internationalist then you have to take the rough with the smooth. If you've
played a stinker then it's the right and the duty of the newspapers to call it
as they see it. We've been lucky in rugby up until now because media treatment
of the game has always steered clear of the kind of personal abuse that crops
up in football.
Constructive criticism is one thing but when it gets to the stage of reporting
the comments of the crowd. Gimme a break.
The media are entitled to write whatever they want, even when they ask loaded
questions with the sole purpose of making money and selling newspapers.
They can be as sensational as they want but, by the same token, those who took
such delight in having a crack at me can't then expect to call me up and carry
on as if nothing has happened.
I've really had my eyes opened over the past six days but I'm a wiser man as a
result. No more Mr Nice Guy.
I take heart from the fact that Gavin Hastings suffered the same kind of
treatment but went on to prove the critics wrong.
I'm not placing myself in the same category as Gavin but, just as he did, I
know that I've still got a lot to offer my club and Scotland, and I'll get it
right not to put one over on the critics but because of the personal
satisfaction that it will give me.
Last weekend against Melrose I was trying too hard. That was a game we should
have won but we know that. Today against Boroughmuir we have the opportunity to
take the premiership challenge right down to the wire. It ain't over until the
fat lady sings, and at the moment she's still warming up.

MELVYN Bragg, the high-profile chairman of Border Television, is to relinquish
his position at Easter. However, the South Bank Show producer and editor will
remain a non-executive director of Carlisle-based Border.
Referring to Mr Bragg's multitude of other commitments, Border finance director
Peter Brownlow said yesterday: ``The man is just a whirlwind and being chairman
of a public company does demand a fair proportion of time.
``With the additional burdens he is accepting on behalf of independent
television, he probably feels that now is the time to step down from Border,
but still be available.''
Mr Bragg, 56, who reportedly made a seven-figure sum out of share options
issued to him a few years ago to lock him into London Weekend Television, is
likely to represent the interests of the independent television industry when
the long-awaited Broadcasting Bill is going through Parliament.
Mr Brownlow said: ``It is sad that he is stepping down as chairman.'' However,
he was sure Mr Bragg, a native of Cumbria, would continue to make a valuable
contribution as a non-executive director.
The question of who will succeed Mr Bragg as non-executive chairman will be
considered at Border's next board meeting in early February.
Mr Brownlow said he did not yet know whether the successor would be chosen from
Border's non-executive directors or brought in from outside.
Border's shares yesterday lost 2p to 212p.

WOLVERHAMPTON &amp; Dudley Breweries basked in City approval yesterday with profit
last year above expectations with the stated pre-tax total up 13.5% to #43.5m.
``The right sort of sun shone in 1995,'' said chairman David Miller.
He added that throughout the summer pubs traded well, take-home trade sales
were buoyant rising by more than 15%, and free-trade business was won back due
in part to problems at one big competitor.
The group boosted its pubs business by building 10 new outlets and buying five
others. There was a strong improvement in margins in the second half as the pub
refurbishment programme bore fruit.
In this financial year, another 15 pubs will be added to the estate, 44 will be
remarketed and another 130 refurbished as part of a capital expenditure
programme costing #45m.
The dividend total has been raised 10.3% to 15p with a 9.9p final. The shares
leapt 21p to 551p.

POOR Neil Kinnock. Even his critics and opponents are beginning to wonder what
he has done to deserve such a bad press. Those days should now be long behind
him.
At first he was portrayed as the Welsh windbag, a political romantic, an
anti-Scottish centralist, a boyo who became distant from the grass roots of the
party. Then they began to call him autocratic, unwilling to listen. After the
election defeat which destroyed his leadership they called him a failure.
This week a new word was added to the lexicon of abuse which Neil Kinnock has
suffered. His boss in the European Commission, Jacques Santer, described him as
weak.
Well, that is the way it was widely reported. In fact Santer did not use the
word ``weak''. But he did - remarkably - suggest that his transport
commissioner had been unable to win an argument in the commission because he
``may not have enough of a strong personality'' to win people over to his cause.
This was immediately interpreted, reasonably enough, as an attack on a ``weak''
Kinnock and as this evidence of disharmony within the commission reverberated
around Europe, Santer quickly began to backtrack. Suddenly, Neil Kinnock was a
``very active, co-operative, efficient commissioner'' with whom Santer looked
forward to working. ``I do not consider, however, that Neil Kinnock has a weak
personality,'' the president added for good measure, shamelessly contradicting
himself.
In retrospect the whole affair was rather ridiculous but probably quite
wounding to Kinnock. To some extent it was caused by the familiar pitfalls when
someone speaks spontaneously in a second or third language and ends up saying
something he did not really mean.
But the damage had been done. Neil Kinnock had been dished again. No-one ever
said politics was supposed to be fair.
In the backrooms of the European Parliament there was fury inside the big
Labour-dominated socialist group with individual British Euro-MPs at each
others' throats. Some, the Kinnock loyalists, expressed outrage at this public
humiliation of a prominent commissioner widely regarded as effortlessly on top
of the job; others argued that he deserved to be slapped down for stepping out
of line.
Kinnock's crime in the eyes of Jacques Santer was to suggest that the king had
no clothes, the king in this case being European economic and monetary union
(Emu). To say such a thing is the ultimate heresy in Brussels these days, at
least inside the commission, where anyone failing to sing from the official
hymn sheet must be struck down. When we talk about Emu we talk about the
European Union's grandest and most ambitious project in decades. Even to hint
publicly that it might be going wrong is treachery.
Kinnock might have got away with it if a French news wire had not picked it up.
His remarks were intended to be personal and private in so far as any speech
made to 200 suits at a business seminar is private. Worse, he then told his
audience that he thought the EU was going about enlargement the wrong way and
that some fresh thinking might be in order.
In these circumstances you might consider that Kinnock, far from being weak and
unable to win arguments, should have been commended for his courage in speaking
up, if not for his carelessness in being reported.
Some commissioners agree with him on both issues. When Bruce Millan, whom
Kinnock replaced, gave up managing the EU's multi-billion pound structural
funds he told reporters as he was leaving that eastwards enlargement of the
community was simply unthinkable in the short term without a major overhaul of
spending. Almost everyone agrees but there are still those who insist that, for
example, the common agricultural policy, accounting for half of all EU
spending, can survive enlargement without major alterations.
No-one outside Kinnock's immediate circle of Eurocrats knows exactly what
happened when Kinnock and Santer met privately on Wednesday afternoon. But it
is significant that Santer's retraction was promptly distributed to Brussels
correspondents by Kinnock's press spokeswoman. Kinnock has remained silent,
with as much dignity as he can muster.
Even without such unforeseen annoyances, life in Brussels was always going to
be difficult for Neil Kinnock and his high-profile wife, Glenys, from the
moment he was chosen to replace Millan as Labour's commissioner and she went on
to win a Welsh Euro-seat with Britain's biggest majority. Her emotional victory
speech in which she bitterly recalled fate's treatment of her husband signalled
the peculiar kind of pressure they would face in Brussels where the knockers
and the merely jealous refer to them sniffily as Labour's royal family.
Obvious efforts have gone into keeping their lifestyle unpretentious in the
face of sniping about their new-found Euro-wealth. Cleverly, they inherited the
tenancy of a modest flat near the commission from a departing Daily Telegraph
reporter. Ostentatious it is not. Thus the tabloids were denied spreads on the
shock-horror scandal of the Kinnocks' continental opulence.
His appearances at cocktail parties are limited and there is no back-slapping
camaraderie with boyos in the pubs around the commission. The Neil Kinnock who
eventually came to power as Labour leader - the former radical with the hippy
hair and extravagant language - is now a slim coffee drinker in a sharp suit
who has the energised look of one who is almost unhealthily healthy.
SOMETIMES, a little of the old Kinnock is allowed out to play. As an
accomplished after-dinner speaker he still has them slapping their thighs and
you can see he is enjoying himself when he slips the leash on his natural
Celtic gift for fun and linguistic histrionics. That is probably why he
sometimes goes on too long: he is a born communicator, a poet.
At work Neil Kinnock showed early on that the job held no daunting challenges.
He brought a briskness to his directorate and a refreshing lack of Eurobabble
to a portfolio which is interesting but limited. Sorting out dodgy ferries,
making Europe's trains run on time, and knocking back airlines chancing their
arm on subsidies is not the stuff of geo-political statesmanship. But he does
the job well, everyone agrees.
Kinnock's trouble, which he will never resolve and can never forget, is that he
was destined for better things, and everyone knows it. The battle-hardened
toughness is no longer needed. Years of experience gained in running a major
European political party goes unwanted. The European Commission with its
flunkeys, limousines, pushy power-dressed women, and subservient bureaucrats is
a long way from the valleys and, in a sense, even further from the bear pit of
the House of Commons. Brussels is not his natural habitat and would never have
been his chosen future.
Kinnock gives the impression of a man carrying a suppressed, agonising
frustration. Underneath the smart suit there is still the bolshy son of a Welsh
miner, still a man of the people, who found the transition to eminence more
difficult to handle than fellow countrymen like Aneurin Bevan, and who,
strangely, attracted more racist criticism than other Welsh politicians in
England.
Yet this is still the man who made Labour electable from nowhere - much thanks
he got - and who handed the job to John Smith for the finishing touches, and
thus to Tony Blair for the ruthless socialist bypass. Kinnock is now the
becalmed bruiser who still loves a political joust and whose eyes light up when
the conversation turns to electoral trends and Labour shoptalk. And then it is
back to the esoterics of trans-European networks and another night of bleak
Eurospeak with commissioners, most of whom have never scaled his heights and
couldn't lace his political boots. No disrespect to Jacques Santer - nice chap
and all that - but to be denounced as a lightweight by Mr Santer is rather like
being criticised by John Major for being colourless.
In his public appearances in Brussels Neil Kinnock puts on a brave face and he
soldiers on. But sometimes, in his darker moments, he must wonder about life's
capricious ways.

SATELLITE broadcaster BSkyB's role in the supply of programmes to the cable
television operators is to be investigated by the Office of Fair Trading. This
was announced yesterday by Director General of Fair Trading John Bridgeman who
said the review is expected to last for six months.
It was sparked off by complaints from some cable operators and their request to
the Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang for a ministerial reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The companies had complained earlier this year and had successfully forced
BSkyB which is 40% owned by Rupert Murdoch's News International to rewrite its
rate card and remove some of the clauses that were thought to be significantly
anti-competitive. Some had said the deal signed with TeleWest Communications
and Nynex Cableomms was unfair.
BSkyB with 4.4 million subscribers is by far the biggest operator in pay-TV. In
addition to the rights to an increasing proportion of premier sports events
being acquired, it has also the rights to a large proportion of Hollywood's
films.
Companies had said that they were being ``bundled'' whereby they had to take
programmes they may not want as part of a package rather than buy just one
individual show.
Mr Bridgeman said the review would be confined to issues relating to the supply
in the UK of programming and related services at the wholesale level. The
investigation will also look into access to encryption, subscriber management
and transponders.
He added that his predecessor, Sir Bryan Carsberg, opted for informal
undertakings because they provided a swift and flexible mechanism to tackle the
practices which he had identified as likely to frustrate competition in this
market. These were to be reviewed by no later than the end of 1996 or earlier
if considered appropriate. He said he had been in recent contact with the DTI
about an appropriate response to continuing complaints from cable operators.
``As the development of this fast-moving market is now at a crucial stage I
have decided to take advantage of the flexibility of informal undertakings to
carry out an early review,'' he added.
Separately, the OFT said that it was evaluating under the Restrictive Trade
Practices Act the terms of various agreements to televise sports. BSkyB shares
saw turnover of almost 30 million and fluctuated heavily during the day,
eventually closing 5!sp lower at 428!sp.

CARE in the Community is a good policy for many suffering from poor mental
health. Indeed its advantages are widely recognised, but its implementation has
left much to be desired and there is a widespread unease about its operation.
Many assume that the deficiencies are to be found in the inadequacy of
financial resource, but that, in the main, may not be the case in Scotland,
where the annual report of the Scottish Health Advisory Service has just been
published. The service is no kind of lapdog but a genuinely independent body
with a radical cast of mind. It finds no consistent implementation of policy
and no clear notion of who are responsible for maintaining that policy to
ensure good professional practice.
The drawbacks of care in the community have been exposed in a number of
dramatic cases in England where, for example, several horrific murders have
been attributed to the poor management of schizophrenics. There, lack of
adequate financial resource seems to have been a factor of some importance in
explaining the failures, but here, as the director of the SHAS suggested
yesterday, there has been a simple lack of understanding between social work
departments and health boards, each of which seems to have imagined that the
other was responsible for the oversight of the policy. Conduct seems to have
differed between localities and individual patients have not been well, and
consistently, served. In some ways that is a far more disturbing situation than
a poor outcome because of financial weakness, for that can always be tackled by
an allocation of new funds. Establishing the proper responsibility for the
people concerned, and ensuring they receive the attention they require, is far
more challenging and goes a long way to justifying the widespread sense of
unease which unites many professional workers in the field with popular
observers.
Once established as existing, this situation can be addressed. In fact the new
Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Forsyth, initiated a thorough review of
Care in the Community on his appointment. For other bodies had expressed doubts
about how the policy was working in fact, no matter how attractive it was in
theory. It should be possible to promote the required reforms by a firm
political judgment, either allocating responsibility generally for implementing
the policy to one body or allocating it to different bodies in different places
but always making the allocation clear. Thereafter, at any rate, seems a
relatively easy matter of administration. This is not the first time Mr Forsyth
has appeared to use his new broom to good effect - and if more money is
required as well, he should get it.

Conrad Wilson compares two very splendid
hotels on the shores
of famous lakes
WHAT the Villa d'Este is to the South-west shore of Lake Como so Cameron House
is to the equivalent portion of Loch Lomond; each seems idyllically situated.
Each, for a price, pampers its guests in the ways they would expect, each is
within reach of a famous major city, each has its own marina, and each serves
uncommonly good food.
The Villa d'Este is the sort of hotel to which opera directors and star singers
retreat for some peace and quiet after they have been booed at La Scala, Milan.
Cameron House, just before I dined there last month, had fed - so they said
with pride - Sir David Frost and Esther Rantzen.
Although Milan and Glasgow have obvious features in common, the smaller towns
of Como and Alexandria, which lie rather closer to their respective grand
hotels, do not. Como has an exquisite cathedral, a fashionable silk industry,
and deservedly plenty of tourists; Alexandria has an air of depression.
On the other hand, the Villa d'Este does cost rather more to stay in. For the
privilege of a view of Lake Como, you will pay something like #280 a night for
one of its 151 rooms, even at the present favourable exchange rate. This makes
Cameron House, at #150, seem relatively cheap, especially as it has just been
named Scottish Hotel of the Year by the AA. Dinner prices are in proportion.
The Villa d'Este's cheapest meal being about the same as Cameron House's
dearest.
Nevertheless, Cameron House is no bargain. Possessor of one of Scotland's few
Michelin stars, its chef, Jeff Bland, is rightly proud of his cuisine, and the
hotel charges for it accordingly. However, although #37.50 per head may seem a
lot, at least in Scotland, for a four-course set dinner on a Saturday night,
nobody could fault the quality of the ingredients or object to the finesse with
which Bland by no means blandly handles them.
Foie gras, langoustine minestronie, fillets of brill and a choice of cheese
formed one permutation of the short menu the night I ate in the so-called
Georgian Room; salmon ravioli, the same soup, fillet of beef, and a hot
chestnut souffle formed another. Although the ingredients themselves were
conspicuously expensive, the expertise of the cooking must have been worth just
as much. This was labour intensiveness on a high and inventive level.
The foie gras, for instance, was served within a ring of roasted cherry
tomatoes - much more interesting that way than raw - along with toasted
brioche. The salmon ravioli turned out to be a single intricate parcel of fish
and shellfish on a bed of thinly sliced asparagus. The clear, keenly flavoured
soup came with ``parma shavings'' (cheese, I would guess, as well as ham) and a
real Marseillaise rouille, its effect an audacious amalgam of France and Italy.
The brill was a brilliant illusion, in which the fish encircled a saffron and
truffle mousse so subtly it was hard to tell which was which. Razor-thin
ribbons of courgette and a dill and vermouth sauce were its accompaniment. The
grilled fillet of beef was no mere fillet of beef, but a fillet of beef stuffed
with wild mushrooms and artichokes with a powerful port wine sauce.
With ingredients such as these, side dishes of vegetables would have been not
only redundant but nonsensical. The chestnut souffle, served with caramel
ice-cream, was a perfect specimen of its kind. The cheese, mostly French and
served from a trolley, was in prime condition.
For those who insist on simple food, Jeff Bland's cooking may seem over-the-top
- the product of a chef already seeking his second Michelin star - but in
almost every respect it carried me with it. Talking to him about it, moreover,
confirmed its seriousness. Whether he has veal or scallops, langoustines or
turnips at his disposal, the questions he invariably asks himself are ``What
are we going to do with them?'' and ``Is there a better way?''.
Originally from Yorkshire, he says he is happy to buy ``everything that's good
in Scotland'', but some things - including chicken, duck, and guinea fowl - he
prefers to import from France. The inference seems obvious. If a product is not
right, he would ``rather scrap it than serve it''. With a background in what
used to be British Transport Hotels - the Queen's in Leeds, the Caledonian in
Edinburgh - he is nothing if not meticulous. But then, with a team of 29
assistant chefs, here is someone who has no need to take short-cuts in his
cooking.
To recoup the cost of such cuisine, the hotel imposes a dismayingly high
mark-up on its otherwise enticing wine list. But the service (except breakfast,
served elsewhere in the building) is immaculate, even though the Georgian Room
- one of several additions to Tobias Smollett's handsome, if somewhat sombre,
birthplace - is a lot less beautiful than the food.

THE Chancellor ack-nowledged in this week's Budget that paying for long-term
care for the elderly is a growing problem for many families. Most people were
disappointed, though, that he did not go further.
The immediate measures he announced were modest. However, he did float a number
of other ideas and will be consulting on proposals to encourage people to make
advance provision for long-term care.
Immediate action includes an easing of the means testing of elderly people who
need to enter long-term nursing or residential care. At present you have to
make a contribution towards this if your savings are more than #3000. If you
have over #8000 you must meet the full cost. Following the Budget you will
qualify for help with fees if you have less than #16,000 and free care when
your assets drop to #10,000.
Age Concern Scotland has welcomed the change but its director, Maureen O'Neill,
points out its limitations: ``The increase in capital limits will help people
with modest savings who need residential or nursing care, but will not prevent
them having to sell their homes to pay for care. The Chancellor's failure to
increase capital limits for means-tested benefits for people living at home,
means the benefit system will continue to penalise older people with savings.''
Providing more free care will involve extra expenditure by local authorities
and the DSS. The Government has said it will provide them with a special grant
to cover this. At the moment, though, according to Age Concern, the amount
allocated for this appears insufficient.
``Church of Scotland homes for the elderly are having to be closed because they
are not receiving enough funding from local authorities and the Church is not
prepared to compromise on quality. Yet they currently provide the lowest cost
care, at under #300 a week, compared to fees of up to #400 to #500 in the
private sector,'' says Liz Mitchell at Age Concern.
As part of this week's Budget package, the Chancellor also announced that
benefits paid out under long-term care insurance policies are to be made tax
free, even where they go direct to the person needing care. Until now, only
payments made straight to care providers have been tax free.
This new provision should make it easier for elderly people to compensate
relatives or friends who give up work to look after them in their own homes.
However, Sandy Johnstone, manager of Commercial Union's long-term care
insurance arm, is somewhat dubious about the possible consequences of this
development.
He explains: ``We see potential problems and abuses. Where we are paying fees
direct to recognised providers, we know there will be some control over the
quality of care given. If payments are made direct to policyholders to purchase
their own care, it is more difficult to check whether they are getting the
standard of care they really need.''
So far, though, relatively few people have taken out long-term care insurance
policies. These come in two main forms. The first involves making advance
payment, either by regular premiums or a lump sum, to cover the cost of care if
the need arises. Policies will normally pay out if the holder becomes incapable
of undertaking two or three ``activities of daily living'', such as bathing,
dressing, or going to the lavatory unassisted.
Under Commercial Union's Well-Being policy, for example, a 61-year-old man
paying a regular premium of #46.20 per month or a single premium of #4616 would
be entitled to #10,000 worth of annual benefit to pay for care for as long as
it was needed.
The second type of policy is available to those with an immediate need for
care. It is an annuity plan which provides enhanced payments in return for a
lump sum investment. Payments will depend on the holder's state of health on
entering care.
The Government would like to encourage more people to make their own provision
for long-term care. Ideas on which it will be consulting include partnership
schemes similar to those which exist in the US, where people who pay for, say,
the first three years of care in a home then receive it free, without a means
test, allowing them to retain any remaining savings.
Another possibility is to enable those with company pension schemes to opt for
a variable pension, taking a small one in the beginning in exchange for a
larger one in later years to help cover the cost of care.
The insurance industry is keen to get involved in this process. Scottish
Mutual's chief executive Andrew Pople says: ``Health care is an area where we
are actively developing our business. We would welcome the opportunity to take
part in the consultation process on long-term care.''
His views are echoed by Britannia Life's Chris Frohlich, who believes the
Government will also have to consider giving people an extra tax incentive
upfront to start planning for long-term care.
For the present, however, according to Age Concern, most retired people feel
betrayed. They believe they have already paid for their care through a lifetime
of taxes and National Insurance contributions and that the state has broken its
promise to look after them.

AUSTRALIAN Craig Parry shot a six-under-par 67 for a halfway total of 132 and a
one-shot lead at The Lakes course in Sydney yesterday.
But he was overshadowed by Frenchman Jean-Louis Guepy, who fired a brilliant
course-record 63, 10 under par, to move up to a stroke off the lead.
Greg Norman, the world No.1, stormed to a 67 by picking up six shots in the
first 14 holes to stay in contention for the tournament that bears his name.
Leading scores (Australian unless stated):
132 - C Parry 65, 67.
133 - J L Guepy (France) 70, 63.
134 - M Campbell (New Zealand) 66, 68; F Nobilo (New Zealand) 64, 70.

138 - B Faxon (USA) 68, 70.
139 - G Norman 72, 67.
q LAURA Davies and Mark McCumber say they make a perfect match on the golf
course. It showed yesterday with a six-under-par 67 in the modified alternate
stroke-play second round of the J C Penney Mixed-Team Classic at Tarpon
Springs, Florida.
Davies and McCumber are 14 under for two rounds, one stroke in front of Val
Skinner and Jay Delsing, who also had a 67. Five teams were tied for third,
another stroke back. Of that group, Carin Hjalmarsson and Doug Martin had the
best round yesterday, a 64, while Vicki Goetze and Steve Stricker, and Barb
Thomas and Steve Jones, had 65s.

n At first glance it looks pretty strange, a new design for some very old
technology. It's the banana chair, and from where your Frontiersman sits
hunched over a smoking keyboard, it looks like the apotheosis of all comfort.
One could go for a snooze given half a chance.
The banana chair is what's known as a dynamic seat which effortlessly tips the
sitter into a series of relaxing positions, the most recumbent of which is the
almost flat- out posture. The makers say it's designed to fit the human form
and sitting in it feels just like floating. It even comes with a relaxation
cassette and a booklet of loosening exercises. Just looking at the picture
makes one's eyelids droop. Originally developed in 1988, a low-down version has
now been raised and made more compact, using adjustable armstraps to alter the
sitting angle. The BC portable folds into a little carry-unit easy to store and
haul out into the garden during the next long-awaited heatwave.
It's selling at #279 from the appropriately named Banana Chair Company on
01773-533626.
The firm have brought out an even more complex version, the Butterfly Recliner
at #495, which looks, to this stressed-out scribbler, the ultimate in induced
lethargy. It's a rocking-chair recliner, guaranteed to paralyse all industry.
Once he is sprawled in one of these, wild horses would be hard put to get this
writer out again.

n The Society of Scottish Artists have painted themselves into cyberspace with
the launch of the first major British exhibition of artists on the Internet.
Sixty artists and sculptors are now exhibiting more than 100 images on the Net.
The works include pieces by George Wylie, Lesley Banks, Bill Gillon, Lys Hansen
and others.
The SSA web site is: http://www-edin.easynet.co.uk/ssa.
n A NEW home shopping service has been launched for Internet users by the
Innovations Group, offering more than 2500 products on a web site.
The Innovations mall offers gifts and gadgets, home furnishings and a range of
catalogues. Customers can make a selection, complete an order form and give
credit card details which are encrypted before transmission to the Internet
server. The company says it can offer new products every day. Innovations
E-dress is http://www.innovations.co.uk.
n YOUNG women who engage in even moderate exercise may suffer from iron
deficiency that results in anaemia, scientists have found. In the first
long-term study of the effects of exercise on the iron status of women,
researchers found that women who take up exercise can lose enough iron to bring
on feelings of fatigue, a symptom of anaemia. Good diet and possibly iron
supplements could be recommended.
n SCIENTISTS in Oregon are trying to put the pep back into peppermint. The
state is a leading producer of the flavouring, and it's under attack by all
sorts of pests. Now university entomologists have designed a computerised
system known as ``Integrated Pest Management for Peppermint'' which helps
identify pests, diseases and other problems. Our polo mints seem to be getting
the protection they deserve.
n FLOWER power is being used to help the farmed salmon industry in Maine. Like
Scots farms, the US industry is faced with infestations of sea-lice which can
drastically reduce yields. Now scientists at Maine University are using a
treatment made from pyrethroids, a natural derivative of chrysanthemum leaves.
It's already been used as a household insecticide, and it seems to be more than
80% effective against sea-lice. It can be used in very low doses and breaks
down in the environment.
n CLOUDY skies may be gloomy but they're also complicated. Their role in global
warming is still foggy, involving complex interactions with carbon dioxide,
heat, and the sun. This month, scientists are gathering more data on the
situation, using three heavily instrumented aeroplanes that will fly above,
below, and in the clouds over Kansas and Oklahoma. The data from this ``cloud
sandwich'' will show how much of the sun's heat is absorbed by clouds at
different altitudes and will be used to improve computer models that predict
global climate change.
n THE most accurate clock in the universe is a . . . star! It's actually a
collapsed star, squashed by its own gravity with the same mass as the sun, but
only about as wide as Greater Glasgow. It's known as a pulsar, spinning at
colossal speed and emitting a pulse of energy on every turn. Astrophysicists
can use the pulses to check on the accuracy of the most accurate timepieces on
earth, atomic clocks which measure the frequency of radiation produced by the
element caesium.
n TELFORD, birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, will make science history
next year when scientists of all disciplines will gather for Scientific
Computing '96, the first exhibition designed to attract the entire computing
fraternity.
Sponsored by the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society of Chemistry and the
Institute of Biology, the exhibition expects to draw scientists from all over
the UK to test and compare the very latest in soft and hardware. It's being
held at the same time as the Physics World Exhibition and Congress, and will
run for two days in April at Telford International Centre.

EDNA Deane, the world champion ballroom dancer famous for having been the
``girl who danced with the Prince of Wales'', has died at 90.
Deane died at her home in Rottingdean, south of London, where she was confined
by crippling osteoporosis. She was born Edna Morton Sewell in the Orange Free
State - now part of South Africa - in 1905 to British parents. Her family
returned to England in 1907, and she trained in ballet and ballroom dancing.
She found fame in Britain under the stage name Edna Deane in the 1920s.
At one ball in the mid-1920s Prince Edward - later King Edward VIII - asked her
dance nine times. That led Herbert Farjeon to pen the popular music hall number
I've Danced With a Man, Who's Danced with a Girl, Who's Danced with the Prince
of Wales.
Fred Astaire, who saw her at the London Palladium in 1929, called her
``authentic poetry in motion''.In 1933, she and her partner Timothy Palmer won
the British and world ballroom dancing championships. When, upon her first
marriage in 1935, she retired, the Sunday Express mourned, ``The lights of
London have dimmed ..... The divine Edna is lost to us.''
She later became a choreographer and writer on dance. When she turned 90 last
month, she was still receiving birthday cards from fans. She is survived by a
daughter from her second marriage to the late restaurateur John Fuelling.

Actress Dolina Maclennan plays Ishbel in Machair and Flora in Hamish MacBeth.
She also does television cooking, writes and does storytelling. As she tells
LEILA FARRAH, she runs bed and breakfast at her home in Blair Atholl.
n BREAKFAST is the only meal in the whole day I'm sure of - without it I'm
shaking by 11 o'clock. Mostly porridge with oatmeal from Blair Atholl Mill,
then sometimes fish, bacon and eggs or scrambled eggs, usually the same as what
the guests are having.
Lunch is usually home-made soup left over from the night before. People pop in
all day for numerous cups of tea, the kettle's always on the boil. I don't bake
- apart from bread made with honey and olive oil - or make cakes but love
Selkirk Bannock spread thick with Lockerbie butter.
I cook Scottish food using good fresh ingredients. I grow my own strawberries,
raspberries, gooseberries, lettuce, potatoes, carrot, and beetroot. I get local
pheasant and roe deer - hind - in season from Pitlochry, salmon from Lewis,
trout from Glen Almond, and fresh fish from Buckie. I have nothing frozen or
processed and don't go in for fancy cooking. Game I do in red wine and juniper
berries, fish just in butter and parsley. A wonderful Gaelic expression says
``Everything has its own taste'' so when you come across something like Beef
Collops Culloden or Salmon Killiecrankie you just cringe. If the ingredients
are good, it needs nothing else.
I love cooking with oatmeal and make a wonderful pheasant soup like the
Cormorant Soup I'd eat as a child in Lewis - with onion, fresh sage, pinhead
oatmeal and nutmeg. I don't use recipes but read them avidly.
I love a beautifully set table with polished crystal, silver for dinner, and at
breakfast a plain china just to make people feel they're worthwhile with a
different atmosphere at each meal. My house rule is no hurry - I work very fast
but I don't hurry and that relaxes people which means sometimes people will be
at the breakfast table at midday.
If I'm cooking dinner for six or more, I sometimes forget to eat and by the
time I've cleared up - I'm past it. But as long as I've had breakfast, lunch
and bannock, I'll maybe just eat leftover vegetables. So I just love going out
to dinner and being fed.
As a child from a fishing family in Lewis I'd pick the seafood from the shore,
so my ideal meal would be fresh boiled lobster, sole on the bone with new
potatoes and a salad afterwards, then strawberries and cream fresh from the
garden. I don't like to eat anything that isn't real. And my favourite drink is
the local excellent tapwater with ice - or a good wine.

IN less than three years the country's largest split-capital investment trust,
the Glasgow-based Scottish National, faces extinction. Yet last week's annual
report made scant mention of this.
Nor is Scottish National the only trust having to face up to decisions about
its future. There are 15, with assets approaching a massive #1750m, due to be
wound up over the next three years. And if the messy way in which Sphere
recently met its end is anything to go by, shareholders may need some
reassurance that the directors are up to looking after their interests during
their remaining life.
Split-capital investment trusts have been around in one form or another since
the sixties. They underwent a great revival in the late eighties and continue
to evolve. There are now nearly 60 which have some form of split capital
structure.
Traditionally, they had two classes of shares: capital and income. The former
benefit from any capital growth in the trust's investments but get no income.
The latter get the dividend income but have no share in any capital growth.
Capital shares are generally a high-risk investment which do well in sharply
rising markets but under-perform when they are falling. Income shares tend to
be much steadier performers.
Most of the newer split-capital investment trusts have adopted a different
structure which involves the issue of zero dividend shares and highly geared
income shares. Zero dividend shares give a predetermined rate of return, paid
when the trust is wound up, and there is no income.
The highly geared income shares get all the income from the trust's investments
and any capital left after repaying the zero dividend shares. Under this
structure, it is the capital shares, the zeros, which offer the lowest risk.
Whatever their structure, all split-capital investment trusts have one thing in
common: a fixed winding-up date. For some investors this is a great help. For
example, many people buy zero dividend shares as a tax efficient way to pay for
things such as school fees. For others, the prospect of being paid a large sum
on a specific date could mean a big bill for capital gains tax.
What happened at Sphere and the proposals which Jupiter is now putting forward
for the winding up of River Plate show that shareholders may end up totally
confused and far from happy.
At Sphere, the management company didn't want to launch a new investment trust,
so shareholders who didn't fancy cash had nowhere to go.
In the end the board told them to take shares in a new trust run by Guinness
Flight. However, Gartmore Shared Equity, one of Gartmore's stable of
split-capital investment trusts, then added to the confusion by putting in a
bid for Sphere which some shareholders accepted.
Jupiter's proposals have pre-empted River Plate's winding-up date by nearly a
year. Shareholders are being offered the choice of going into a new trust,
Jupiter Split, taking cash now, or staying with River Plate until the trust is
wound up next October.
Jupiter's Philip Butt says it decided to make the move now because it was
becoming increasingly difficult to deal in River Plate's shares. However, he
admits shareholders are confused, but adds: ``River Plate income shareholders
who want to carry on getting their high income for another year will be able to
do so."
River Plate can only be extinguished early if more than 90% of shareholders
accept the Jupiter offer and the minority are forced to sell. Mr Butt thinks
this won't happen but admits shareholders who want to stay with River Plate
could lose out in these circumstances.
John Szymanowski of stockbroker Warburgs predicts: ``Most split-capital
investment trusts are managed by large investment management groups and will
come up with proposals which give shareholders the option of taking cash or
shares in a new trust. After all no-one voluntarily watches funds under
management disappear out the door.''
However, investment trusts are run by independent boards of directors and some
of them may ask other groups to put in alternative proposals. And with many
split-capital trusts now standing at a discount to net assets, a spate of
opportunistic takeover bids can't be ruled out. Jupiter Split is hoping to
complete the acquisition of River Plate by the end of the year, but there could
still be a bid from somewhere else.
This could be tough luck on the shareholders who planned to take cash on a
specific date - and the experience at Sphere proves this is what most people
want to do. They may be plunged into uncertainty during the run up to their
trust's winding-up date.
The next trusts to face these problems are Fleming International High Income,
Hong Kong and Rights &amp; Issues, all of which are due to be wound up next year.

WHY does every day and week and year have to be dedicated to something? Who
decides? Has the UN set up a special committee? (``Hmmm if National Cycling
Awareness Day is in March and 1996 is World Haemorrhoid Year - slogan: Stand Up
For Your Rights - then we should give the International Root Vegetable
Awareness Society the second Tuesday in June.'')
As a generalisation, any issue that needs its own week or month isn't one that
should command our attention. This commemoration gimmick is nothing but a
cynical nineties public relations ploy. This was brought home to me last
Saturday when I caught the televised comedy gig in aid of HIV-related charities
which was set up to mark World AIDS Day.
When I switched on, Phil Kay was just finishing, and after his inspired
improvisation I suppose it could only really be downhill. And boy did it career
downhill fast. In fairness to the other performers, benefit gigs are always a
nightmare. The more serious the cause that is `benefiting'' the more chance
there is that the whole night will involve a major bit of sincerity overload,
and the less likely that a paying audience will allow themselves to be
entertained.
The audience at these things tend to think that, although it's a comedy night,
it's inappropriate to laugh while there are trees to be hugged and dolphins to
be put on re-employment training. The only reason that a comedian might prefer
to do an AIDS benefit is that it provides an opportunity to use his usual
inspiration for material - sex. It's easier to be funny about sex than it is to
be funny about Bosnia or whales. Or Wales. No that's not true, it's always easy
to laugh at the Welsh.
The fact that condoms are such a rich source of laughs should be enough to
rebut the fanciful notion, cruelly put about by AIDS charities, that condoms
are erotic. If condoms were erotic, they wouldn't need TV adverts to tell
teenagers to use them, they'd need to put out adverts telling them to stop
before the world's rubber supplies run out. Maybe the Pope should stop trying
all this moral-high-ground stuff and tell it like it is.
As the competition among fund-raisers hots up they're all having to become more
cynical and manipulative.
In between the comedy segments on Saturday night there were serious
``heart-tugging'' moments, telling us how terrible it is to have AIDS. If
anyone was ever insensitive enough to imagine that having AIDS is a picnic, the
programme was quick to educate them. It did this by interviewing the most TV
friendly, most middle-class AIDS sufferers it could find. From what they told
us we could only surmise that AIDS is much much worse than leukemia, or kidney
failure, or lung cancer.
In some senses they are right: AIDS is a unique illness, but not in the degree
to which it takes young people and breaks them. The programme tried to show a
different image of AIDS, and while challenging people's preconceptions is not
necessarily a bad thing, a denial of the facts (that AIDS affects mostly gay
men and drug addicts) can only serve to stigmatise the disease further. The
only time anyone who looked gay got a word in was if they were doing a turn
on-stage. From their attitude we can assume that it's OK to be gay on a show
like that, but only if it's a sixties-style camp, and only if the person
doesn't look unwell.
Medical science has been able to watch the evolution of AIDS over the past 12
years in an unsurpassed manner. Within five years of its description in the
medical journals we had innumerable programmes featuring ``experts'' who
earnestly told us that AIDS was going to sweep the world, making the bubonic
plague look like last year's chickenpox outbreak. Religious fundamentalists of
all sorts were delighted. Here was proof that God was pretty fed up, and about
to wreak havoc on unbelievers. This always confused me, because by this
implication anyone researching a cure for AIDS would be doing the Devil's work.
What has happened in the past decade? In the UK there is no ``plague''.
Compared with heart disease, cancers, and even car crashes, HIV infection is
still comparatively rare among the general population. From a global
perspective AIDS is rampant in parts of Africa, but it still has a huge way to
go before it catches up with malaria in the continent's death league.
We all know that HIV infection is a tragedy, but if you're an African who's got
malaria, or a middle-aged woman with stomach cancer, that's just as tragic.
Maybe more would be done for them if they had the decency to get themselves a
trendy terminal disease.

YOUR report on November 28 of Sir Bruce Pattullo's speech at the Glasgow
Chamber of Commerce did no justice to him on the debate on devolution. I say
this as a long-standing supporter of reform who attend the event.
His advice was given added force precisely because he was prepared to set aside
his personal view which he did in a sentence. He went on, at some length, to
suggest that business should engage with the detail of the devolution plans
perhaps on a sector-by-sector basis and that to do otherwise would be some sort
of failure of leadership.
His calm advice had its effect in the chamber but little sense of this was
carried into your over-personalised report.
Here was one of Scotland's leading businessman avoiding shrill comment and
trying to encourage reasoned debate within a business community which, so far
at least, has shown every sign of wishing to duck its responsibilities. One
only needs to look at CBI Scotland which is to give no leadership and do no
homework and in its own quaint phrase ``stick to its knitting.''
I think The Herald's unbalanced report poorly served Sir Bruce, the Chamber,
and Scotland and only confirmed the worst fears of those few people in business
tempted to contribute to the debate: that they had better not.

ONE of the things that puts East 17 shaved head and hairy shoulders above the
rest of the current boy-group pack is that, in opposition to the dazzling
``shiny teeth and bronzed torsos'' brigade, East 17 look mostly like convicts
on the run after a violent barber attack.
To be this aesthetically challenged and this scary, and still have
pre-pubescent girls scream at you and choose to wear your face on their chests
is a remarkable feat. To come up with the odd pop gem on top of it seems just
like showing off.
The show, as you would expect, is a Big Bucks Extravaganza, complete with a
breathtaking set, a spectacular light show, erotic dancing girls, bad
acoustics, and Georgio Armani boxer shorts (frequently exposed).
However it's a shame that East 17 still feel the need for choreographed dance
routines in their show, a credibility kiss of death.
How can guys like these look cool flying through the air with their ankles
above their heads? They can't. They just look embarrassed, and it doesn't suit
them.
But for the most part this is a wildly exciting show, even for an old woman
like me. All around me, young girls respond with a reverence that reminds me of
an old-fashioned word: swoon.
It can only be a healthy sign that badly shaven rough diamonds still appeal to
teenage girls, especially with Take That getting cleaner and more responsible
at every turn.
Better to scream at something real than to sob for a cardboard cut-out.

T HAS been reported in certain newspapers that Mr Angus Cook sold his
shareholding in Dundee Football Club to Mr Ron Dixon. This is incorrect and
misleading.
For the avoidance of doubt, I wish to inform you that I refused on many
occasions to sell the club to Mr Dixon and indeed sold the club to Mr A
Drummond who in turn sold the club to Mr Dixon.

PETER Ebdon gave a superb display as he romped into the Royal Liver Assurance
UK Championship final in Preston last night.
Ebdon had lost the first frame to Andy Hicks during the afternoon but stormed
back to seal a 9-1 triumph.
In tomorrow's final he will meet a Scot - either holder Stephen Hendry or
provisional world No.2 John Higgins, who play their semi-final today.
``I did a thoroughly professional job and felt very good,'' said the
25-year-old Londoner, whose victory took him further than last year, making
amends for his 1994 Guild Hall semi-final defeat by Hendry.
``It didn't matter what Andy did, because I always felt in control of the
match,'' said Ebdon, who will be appearing in his third ranking event final.
``To be honest, I don't think I've peaked yet. I could have played all day
because I was enjoying it so much.''
It was the second time in just over a month he had beaten Hicks following a
success at last month's Skoda Grand Prix - and it avenged a 13-8 drubbing in
the world championship quarter-finals in Sheffield earlier this year.
Hicks, 22, who had beaten world No.5 James Wattana and third seed Ronnie
O'Sullivan in his previous games, claimed the opening frame with an 84 break
before Ebdon bagged the next nine frames.
Frames five and six proved crucial. Ebdon, leading 3-1, fluked a red to start a
clearance of 107. He then doubled the final green after Hicks had missed the
same ball to clear up with 25 for 5-1.
Ebdon finished the session with another vital clearance of 31 and when the
match resumed he required only 39 minutes, firing two half-century breaks, to
wrap up his crushing win.
Hicks picked up a #18,000 consolation prize.

HENRY Ward Pirie was educated at George Watson's College and Edinburgh
University, where he graduated MA LLB. He served in the Royal Scots and the
Indian Army during the later war years and left the service with the rank of
lieutenant.
He was called to the Bar in 1947 and in 1954 was elevated to the bench as
Sheriff-Substitute (as the office of Sheriff was then designated) at Airdrie.
He was transferred to Glasgow in the following year and served in the old
Sheriff Court in Ingram Street until his retirement in 1974.
In court, Sheriff Pirie was noted for his quiet courtesy. When it was possible
to dispose of a case summarily he would do so but when the occasion demanded he
could assemble and systematise detailed issues of fact and law with skill and
clarity. His human qualities enabled him to deal with family law cases with
particular sensitivity.
Sheriff Pirie was ready to give his time to the encouragement of young lawyers
and was an active honorary vice-president of the Glasgow Judicial Society.
After retiring he enjoyed writing and broadcasting and gave advice on legal
matters to newspaper readers.
In private life, Harry Pirie was quietly congenial. His prowess at golf was
considerable and his acute mind allowed him to excel at bridge. The same
quality was displayed in his expertise as setter of crossword puzzles for The
Herald, among other publications.
There are now a decreasing number who can remember the Sheriff Court of the
post-war decades. Legal life was, or seemed, less frenetic then than now. To
those who can remember these days, the passing of Harry Pirie will touch a
poignant chord.
Sheriff Pirie leaves four sons. His wife predeceased him.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke's third Budget may not have improved his party's
election prospects to any great degree - although that remains to be seen - but
it did raise a cheer at the offices of ProShare, the organisation which
campaigns for wider share ownership.
ProShare had been upset when, in an ill-judged breakfast-time swoop back in
July, he changed the tax rules on company share options in a way which caught a
whole lot of little kittens as well as the boardroom fat cats who were his real
target. Even when later modified, it looked as though these employee option
schemes would be few and far between in the future.
Now all is forgiven. ProShare greeted the Budget with the comment that it was
``the best in many years for employee share ownership''.
The old Approved Discretionary Share Option Schemes, which gave tax concessions
on options up to a value of #100,000 or four times salary, are to be replaced
with new Company Share Option Plans.
These plans, which have to cover virtually all employees to get the tax
concession, will allow companies to grant options up to a value of #20,000.
These will be at an exercise price equal to the market price at the time of
granting and can be taken up without penalty after three years.
Provided the employee's options do not total more than #20,000, they will
escape the July ruling on discretionary schemes that income tax must be paid on
the difference between the option and market prices when it is exercised even
if the shares are not sold. The concession will also apply to options granted
under the old schemes provided the #20,000 total is not exceeded.
Opponents of the Chancellor's July clampdown had been complaining that levying
income tax in this way meant the employee would have to sell a large number of
the shares.
No chancellor pleases everyone with a concession so there have been a few
rumblings that the #20,000 limit is on the low side. It would be surprising,
however, if he was in any hurry to raise it as, quite apart from political
objections to giving cream to fat cats, the Inland Revenue is anxious to make
sure options do not become a way of giving employees part of their salary tax
free.
Mr Clarke also gave a welcome boost to Save As You Earn option schemes known as
ShareSave. Under these around a million employees have been given options to
buy shares at discounts of up to 20%. They must save with an approved
institution, often a building society, enough money each month for five years
so the total including tax-free interest will be sufficient to acquire these
shares at exercise time. The minimum monthly saving is #10, the maximum #250.
The restrictions on these schemes have been criticised partly because #10 a
month was too much for some employees but mainly because five years was
regarded as to long a commitment. Only about a third of those entitled were
taking them up. Mr Clarke is meeting both criticisms, reducing the minimum
period to three years and the minimum monthly payment to #5.
A pre-Budget poll of companies indicated they would welcome these changes and
continue to support employee share option schemes. The concession on ShareSave
is likely to bring in another 300,000 people.
The new share option plans, which are largely modelled on the old discretionary
ones, are expected to be popular. More than 6000 had been started before the
Chancellor jumped on them in July.
The delight about both ShareSave and Company Share Option Plans is that they
are risk free. The ShareSave employee does not have to exercise the option if
the price is not attractive when it matures. He or she can just view it as a
tax-efficient savings plan. Similarly, those granted options under company
plans will not only get them free but they will be under no compulsion to take
them up.
The Chancellor's other concession to encourage employee share ownership affects
the share-based profit sharing schemes which involve around a million people.
Under these companies can distribute shares worth up to 10% of an employee's
salary each year. The snag has been that income tax must be paid if they are
sold in less than five years. Mr Clarke is now reducing this to three.
No wonder an increasing number of employees are keeping anxious eyes on their
company's share price. Purely from this point of view, ShareSave participants
stand to gain the most as they can be issued options at a discount. The new
company option plan holders should also do well as the share price will have
three years in which to climb, even though the options will not be granted at a
discount.
Research in America suggests firms with such schemes tend to do better than
those without, although there is no proof this is because option holders put in
extra effort.
Provided the schemes keep within the rules, the shares acquired are free of
income tax. Capital gains tax may be paid when they are sold if total gains
exceed the annual limit of #6000. However, anyone seeing gains of more than
that can pass shares to their spouse to double the tax-free allowance.

The intrepid Clive James learns to tango and play polo in Buenos Aires. Allan
Laing finds a travel master who is never afraid to step on toes
THEY'RE all at it. A few years ago Michael Palin went around the world in 80
days. Angus Deayton has just circumnavigated the globe in pursuit of that most
elusive of emotions, happiness. And Simon Dring has dusted off the old kaftan
and is currently on the road again, following the hippy trail to Katmandu.
Give a personality a passport and, next thing you know, he will promise you the
Earth. It may have been a hard day on the Planet for some but, for those on a
television company's expense account, life's a beach. I blame Alan Whicker
myself.
The current master, of course, is Clive James. This week, if it's Monday, it
must be Buenos Aires. City of gorgeous women and macho men, both genders
wonderfully unencumbered by political correctness. The last redoubt of the
anti-feminist. Clearly a killing ground for old Clive's witty observational
humour.
So what does the fearless roving reporter do when he secures an exclusive
interview with the President of Argentina? Ask him some deep and penetrating
questions about South American politics? His thoughts on his country's
continuing love-hate relationship with the United Kingdom? The Falklands
perhaps? Well, no, actually. Clive avoids the obvious and goes for the Big One.
He asks Carlos Menem how good he is at the tango. The old paso doble. The
sexiest dance in the world.
Other, more earnest, broadcasters might have taken the opportunity of
conducting The Major Interview. But not Clive. He's been there, seen it, done
it, read the book, bought the t-shirt, and clapped the dog. In his own sweet
way, he is a graduate of the Trivial Pursuits school of television journalism.
If Panorama had asked him and not Martin Bashir to grill the Princess of Wales
then things might have been different. ``There were three people in this
marriage. It only takes two to tango.'' Mind you, it's a task which the balding
Australian would probably have refused. Diana, it is said, is a personal
friend. So perhaps, having made this documentary about Buenos Aires, he
delivered a few wise words of advice to HRH before she em-barked on her tour of
Argen-tina - maybe even a few Latin American dance lessons.
``Buenos Aires is the most romantic city I've ever visited. I'd never been
there - except in my dreams when I would dance the tango with a smouldering
Latin beauty who soldered her body to mine and whispered to me in Spanish as we
moved,'' he says.
But, in his waking hours, Clive could not dance a step. Two left feet. So he
enrolled with an Argentinian dance teacher.
``She was working with unpromising material. The tango is a kind of mobile
embrace but it was about an hour before I got closer to my teacher than the
tips of her fingers. Although her English was almost perfect, she tended to
lapse into Spanish whenever I trod on more than one of her feet at the same
time,'' he confesses.
A woman's place in Argentina is a few dance steps behind her bloke. The men,
explains James, were ``macho to the point of mania''.
``The tango is the supreme example of this. The man can stand there, shooting
his cuffs and being macho. He only has to learn a few steps. The woman will do
the rest, performing wonderful arab-esques around him,'' he adds.
President Men-em can tango, that's for sure. ``He is a man of romance,''
discloses Clive. ``He also has a certain macho directness, a problem you are
stuck with in Buenos Aires.
``The President himself comes from the Sixties, which is my era. As to what he
is thinking - it could be to do with his hairstyle, his sideburns, his stack
heels, and his flared trousers - maybe he has a flared mind.''
But enough tango. Surely there is more to the land of the gaucho? Oh well,
there is the polo. Not the car, not the mint, but the game. Clive found his way
to a ranch on the Pampas where they gave him a pony called Steady Eddie. After
a couple of hours, James had mastered the walk and was making good progress on
the trot. He was ready for a couple of chukkahs.
``Polo is easy,'' he says. ``All you have to do is ride the horse and hit the
ball.'' Easier said than done.
Clive James in Buenos Aires is the first in a series of new travel films which
the globetrotting James has made for ITV. The next stop is Nashville where he
gets to make a country and western record with Mark Knopfler and Chet Atkins.
It's a song called ``Someone Else's Someone'' which he wrote himself.
``If you think that Nashville was a dream come true for me - yes, it was. But
I'd be crazy to think that my record was really any good. There were moments,
though, when I almost got carried away with the dream and thought I was really
something. It was a shock afterwards to hear it coming through all that
equipment,'' he says.
Humorous though his travelogues certainly are, Clive James believes that,
behind the laughs, there is often a serious message trying to get out. ``I
think I do make serious documentaries. The reputation of the programmes is now
such that I don't have to persuade people that, although I'm a joker, I have
serious things to say.
``The programmes have established that these things are possible. But I'm not
the first man in history who thought he was being serious and turned out to be
a very successful clown.''
n.Clive James in Beunos Aires is on ITV on Monday.

PETE Sampras and Yevgeny Kafelnikov won their singles matches yesterday to
leave the United States and Russia all square after the first day of the Davis
Cup final.
World No.1 Sampras overcame Andrei Chesnokov in a five-set thriller, then
Kafelnikov put the Russians back in the match by beating Jim Courier in
straight sets.
Wimbledon and US Open champion Sampras defeated world No.90 Chesnokov 3-6, 6-4,
6-3, 6-7, 6-4. After the match and with injured team-mate Andre Agassi among
the specators, Sampras threw his arms in the air to celebrate victory but then
collapsed with cramp and was helped off the court.
Despite Kafelnikov's 7-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory, he and Courier looked evenly
matched - trading powerful shots in a series of long rallies that delighted the
near-capacity crowd in Moscow's Olympic Stadium.
Kafelnikov took time to settle in the first set, double-faulting three times,
before convincingly winning a tie-break 7-1.
The second set went with serve to 6-5 when Courier dropped his service after
the Russian initially squandered two set points.
Courier trailed 3-0 in the third, broke back to 3-2 but eventually lost 6-3.
Kafelnikov and Andrei Olkhovsky face Todd Martin and Richey Reneberg in today's
doubles.

EDUARDO MENDOZA'S big novel of the eighties, City of Marvels, established him
as one of Spain's major writers and put Catalonia firmly on the literary map.
Through the maverick and uncompromising rise of its central character - Onofre
Bouvila - Mendoza charted the parallel ascension of Barcelona as it prepared to
become one of the major sources of Spanish wealth and power.
The historical intricacies and dramatic pantheon of characters in City of
Marvels is a vivid portrait of Spanish upheavals early this century. Catalonia
proved to be the perfect focus for an examination of those issues which led to
the first Spanish republic and civil war.
The Year of the Flood takes place some 30 years later, in the fifties, with
Franco firmly in power. It is shorter, quieter and less ambitious. References
to the political climate are kept to a minimum and there are none of the
historical digressions which gave City of Marvels its scope. But the characters
are more fully drawn and the narrative moves with greater pace and precision.
It is the story of a love affair between a nun and the Catalonian landowner to
whom she goes to for help. Sister Consuelo has a plan to build a hospital for
the elderly but all attempts at extracting money from church and state have
failed. So she turns to the disreputable Augusto Aixelà for financial
assistance.
There are two nice, unexpected twists to the way their relationship turns out.
This first occurs with the realisation that it is Sister Consuelo who is
persisting with their business meetings because of a romantic attachment, and
not the other way round. And the second concerns the way in which a sexual
encounter with Augusto precipitates the building of the hospital, precisely at
a moment when his deceit and corruption become apparent.
Sister Consuelo emerges not only as the heroine, but as the most deeply drawn
of all Mendoza's characters. The emotional truth of her predicament is
expressed in a neat but powerful scene which takes place just before the
seduction.
It makes for a good, sad story. The ending is as drab and ironic as real life,
making the constancy of Sister Consuelo's lifelong love for an unlovely man
seem gloomily truthful rather than affirmative.
However this is not enough to fulfil the inherent potential of Mendoza's
narrative. Augusto is a fully committed supporter of Franco; Sister Consuelo is
politically unaware; and the conclusion of the novel comes when we finally meet
the band it named lo coix. But the implications suggested by this trio of
state, church and resistance are not explored.
Even in City of Marvels there is an ironic detachment from the narrative and a
sense that difficult subjects should be cryptically referred to rather than
directly confronted. In The Year of the Flood the story withdraws even further
into the suggestive and the ambiguous.
At a time when Ken Loach's Spanish Civil War film, Land and Freedom, is being
fervently seized upon in Spain for its dramatically charged representation of
the past the critical subtleties of Mendoza's approach seem more impotent than
circumspect.

Brussels
NATO, signalling the start of its most ambitious military operation, gave the
go-ahead today for 2600 troops to take up position in Bosnia to prepare for the
deployment of a 60,000-strong Alliance-led peace force.
Nato sources said 200 could leave as early as tomorrow from the headquarters of
the ACE Rapid Reaction Corps in Rheindalen, Germany, where they are on 24-hour
standby.
A short Nato statement said the decision to ``deploy theatre-enabling forces
into Croatia and Bosnia-Herzogovina'' was made by Nato ambassadors meeting as
the North Atlantic Council (NAC), the Alliance's top policy-making forum.
Diplomats said the decision followed a formal request from Nato's Supreme
Allied Commander in Europe, General George Joulwan of the United States, who
will be the overall commander of the alliance's peace implementation force.
``I stress these are not combat troops, they are experts in logistics,'' said
one alliance source.
The bulk of the so-called ``enabling force'', which includes 500 Britons and
700 US servicemen, is expected to be in position early next week, a Nato
ambassador said.
``The idea is that they should be in place quickly and complete the enabling
architecture so that the rest . . . can surge in force, that's the concept. The
success of this operation depends on speed,'' another senior Nato diplomat said.
The advance unit will upgrade communications and transport facilities, take
over the running of ports to be used for troop arrivals, and check that roads
and airfields can withstand intensive use.
Alliance sources said the decision to authorise the dispatch of the advance
party was made after a few last-minute hitches on rules of engagement for the
force and the terms of reference for political advisers with the military were
cleared up.
They said the advance unit would have different rules of engagement to the bulk
of the force, which would be covered by a UN Security Council mandate.
Problems over the exact wording had prevented a decision yesterday but the
hitches were quickly resolved after consultations with national capitals.
``There is a can-do air around Nato at the moment,'' said one source.
The NAC is expected to give provisional agreement to the main peace force plan,
which has been meticulously drawn up by the Alliance's military authorities.
It will be endorsed next week at a historic first joint meeting of all 32
Alliance defence and foreign ministers.
The final peace conference in Paris on December 14 will open the way for the
adoption of a UN Security Council resolution handing over the Bosnia dossier to
Nato.
G-day, for Go-day, will then receive final approval and thousands of heavily
armed troops will pour into Bosnia through five entry points.
Alliance defence ministers have been told the rest of the force should arrive
within the first 30 days.-Reuter.

I TRAVELLED back from Paris on Monday, November 27. There was a rail strike in
France, but the Eurostar managed to leave, although slightly late. All troubles
began on arrival in London, where our party discovered that the so-called Link
Train to the North of England and Scotland had departed two minutes before our
arrival.
No-one in authority appeared to deal with the 30 or so passengers (or
customers) who had through tickets and reserved seats on this train which,
presumably, left with no passengers on board!
We were all finally packed into taxis to take us to King's Cross, where we were
left to find any seat that was left on an already busy train. Cross Country
Services took no responsibility in satisfying our needs, as this was a Eurostar
problem.
This break in communication between Eurostar and Cross Country Services, which
runs the Link Train on Eurostar's behalf, has happened before and each seems to
put the blame upon the other. Meanwhile the passenger is caught between the
incompetency of these two businesses.
Is this a clue as to what will be an even more regular occurrence when the
total railway network is privatised?
I also wonder whether Eurostar would quite like to get rid of their northern
connection, and are doing their best to discourage travellers from using the
service.

SERIFA is the second in the series Whose Freedom is it Anyway (R4) in which
Vera Frankl looks at how life has changed for women in Eastern Europe. In the
spring of '92, Serifa Halilovic arrived in Zagreb with her nine-year-old
daughter, having left her husband and two older children in her much loved home
town of Sarajevo. Sarajevo, she said was a place with a special atmosphere, a
special smell, where people of different nationalities lived harmoniously, a
place where the tradition of tolerance was strong.
A bridge was blown up, return was impossible, and her lively little girl became
withdrawn. The English teacher who enjoyed her life, her city, who used to sit
in the balcony in the evenings with a glass of wine and enjoy the company of
her friends was now on her way to becoming someone else entirely. We believed
the world would stop the war, she explained, almost incredulous of her former
naivety.
Stranded and without a job, she watched as thousands streamed into Zagreb. She
set up a women's refuge camp, and with the asset of her excellent English, she
travelled overseas to raise funds. Her life was split into before and after
halves, but she did not know which half was the dream - and she carried this
sense of unreality to Brussels, aware that in another life she would have
enjoyed herself, gone shopping, but now inhabiting the ordinary was no longer
an option.
The hopes and experiences of America's black slaves in the light of Abraham
Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Act was the topic of The Spirit of America (R4),
another illuminating series which will be looking at six historical turning
points of African-American history. This week the British writer Caryl Phillips
talked to Professor John Hope Franklin, who demolished the notion of a
benevolent, straightforward move to grant freedom and guarantee its future with
legislature and state-aided reconstruction.
In fact, the state did nothing to counteract the powerlessness of the people it
had only technically liberated. The euphoria of walking freely off the
plantation, of being allowed to marry, of being allowed to own land was heady,
but it soon became clear that the government actively co-operated in the former
slave owners' accumulation of power; the best next stage for the ex-slaves was
deemed that they become apprentices of their former owners.
The Act was essentially duplicitous, and nugatory in its very conception, for
the preliminary proclamation extended freedom only to Confederacy-held areas,
but not on the Union patch. In other words, freedom was allowed where freedom
was impossible. The Klan was not challenged by the small Union army, and the
handy racist belief that the negro was a helpless child in need of protection,
became a self-fulfilling prophecy as the recently freed were left utterly
exposed to barbarism. ``De facto slavery?'' questioned Phillips. ``That's
pretty strong,'' answered the meticulous expert on oppression, ``but if you
pushed me . . . Yes.''
The corrupt and murderous regime of General Abacha, the Nigerian despot at
whose hands Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants were recently hanged, has
turned the country into a ``kleptocracy of contractors'' where bribery
lubricates every transation. In From Our Own Correspondent (R4) the most
complex and inchoate situations are regularly rendered, if not completely
comprehensible, at least immediate and compelling. John Egan's report from a
terrified Ogoni village bore this out, as did Bridget Kendall's account from
fundamentalist downtown Montana, where the new conspiracy theory gaining wide
appeal seems to be that President Clinton, gays (which equals felons -
homosexuality being illegal) and feminists are plotting to disarm America and
turn it over to the new bogeyman, the United Nations. Well, it is always
disheartening to know that instead of those familiar Reds, there's a foreign,
polyglot and ineffectual body under the bed . . .

FRENCH television pioneer Leon Zitrone, a star since the 1960s, died in a Paris
hospital after a brain haemorrhage on the night of his 81st birthday on
Saturday.
Zitrone won the hearts of the nation with sensational commentaries at major
public ceremonies, including the annual Bastille Day parade, the funeral of
President Charles de Gaulle, and the marriage of Prince Charles.
But he also produced gripping commentaries of sports events such as the Tour de
France cycling race, horse racing, and figure skating.
``Leon Zitrone was an extraordinary professional, dear to the hearts of the
French people,'' President Jacques Chirac said. ``Present at all the great
moments of television, his erudition, his rigour, his enthusiasm were
appreciated by all.''

THE jute and the jam may be long gone, but Dundee now has another claim to fame
- the best museums in Scotland. For the second year in succession, the city has
scooped the Scottish Museum of the Year Award sponsored by the Post Office.
Following the 1994 success of Discovery Point, part of the Dundee Heritage
Trust, the #2000 prize went this year to Barrack Street Museum of Natural
History for a display entitled ``Head for the Hills''.
The exhibition focuses on the wildlife of the Scottish Highlands, with
interactive computers explaining the life cycles, of plants, animals and
insects, and audio systems reproducing bird calls.
Originally opened in 1993, the display was destroyed by fire a few months later
and had to be reconstructed at a cost of #50,000. Since reopening last year, it
has attracted 45,000 visitors. The prize money will be spent on another
interactive exhibit on aquatic wildlife.
The award was welcomed by Dundee district councillor Helen Wright, representing
the provost, who said: ``It is a well-deserved tribute to a wonderful project.
When you go in the door it's like a breath of fresh air, it's like stepping
into the country in the middle of the city.''
Announcing the award at Scone Palace, Colin Thompson, the chairman of the
judges, expressed satisfaction at a new innovative approach to museums and
galleries in Scotland, often aimed at younger visitors.
``A significant number of the entries this year were for presentations that
were either designed expressly for children or that kept them firmly in mind,''
he said. ``This signals, thank goodness, the end of the take it or leave it era
of museums when the glass case display was the be all and end all.''
Kenneth Graham, the chairman of the Scottish Post Office Board, welcomed the
increasing popularity of museums and galleries, which he said provided an
opportunity to review the past, better understand the present, and reflect on
the future. He noted that 8.5 million people visited about 300 such
institutions in Scotland last year, which was considerably more than had
attended football or rugby matches.
Sandy Gall, the broadcaster and author who presented the award, provided an
interesting perspective on the ceremony with an anecdote about a museum in
Kabul.
He was making the point that residents of Scotland are fortunate in not being
exposed to daily danger, or having their museums pillaged, as is the case in
other countries. The museum in the Afghan capital was a case in point - when he
visited it last summer he found it an absolute shambles. It had been fought
over and systematically looted of its treasures such as sixth-century ivory
carvings and rare Buddhas.
His audience was left with a greater appreciation of the pleasures of browsing
around a natural history museum without being exposed to artillery fire.
Two other entries were highly commended - the restoration of Abbot House, the
oldest house in Dunfermline, and a new community museum in part of the old fish
market in Newhaven.
The National Museum of Scotland won the publications award for Treasure
Islands, inspired by the work of Robert Louis Stevenson, and the Whithorn
Discovery Centre won the educational award for an archaeological exhibit in the
form of a three-dimensional jigsaw.
Another award went to a scarecrow called Bogle. Created by the Scottish
Agricultural Museum at Ingliston, it comes to life to provide a 12-minute
audio-visual programme for children evoking old ways of life in the country.

William Matheson, Gaelic scholar; born August 25, 1910, died November 30, 1995
WILLIAM MATHESON, who died in the small hours of Thursday morning was an
exceptionally gifted Gaelic scholar and teacher whose influence on Gaelic
studies has been profound and whose contribution to the rediscovery of the
riches of traditional Gaelic song was unique.
Although his earliest memories were of Harris, he was born and brought up in
Sollas, North Uist, the son of Malcolm Matheson and Mary Murray from Lewis.
Willie's father was missionary to the United Free Church, and a gifted
precentor and preacher. He and his younger brother, the late Professor Angus
Matheson, of the Chair of Celtic at Glasgow University, were sent for their
secondary schooling to the mainland, and Willie spent two years at Boroughmuir
High School in Edinburgh before transferring to Inverness Royal Academy in
1926. From there he proceeded to Edinburgh University in 1929, graduating with
Honours in History in 1933.
Even before he completed his history degree he had been drawn into the circle
of Gaelic scholarship led by Professor W J Watson, where he was a contemporary
with Sorley MacLean, Kitty MacLeod, and James Carmichael Watson among others.
Now he assisted Professor Watson in his work on the Campbell of Islay
manuscripts of Gaelic folktales, and began work on his magnificent edition of
the poems of John MacCodrum which established his reputation as a scholarly
editor of no ordinary powers. It was in that connection that he embarked on the
series of field trips to the Outer Isles which laid the basis for his
unrivalled understanding of the older Gaelic song-poetry.
By 1938 he had come to feel a strong religious vocation and enrolled at New
College. He was ordained in the Church of Scotland in 1943 and served as
minister in Tobermory from 1945 to 1952, when he was invited by the new
Professor of Celtic, Kenneth Hurlstone Jackson, to return to Edinburgh to take
charge of Scottish Gaelic teaching there. A long and fruitful partnership
ensued between the doyen of early Celtic studies and the learned scholar of
Scottish Gaelic poetry and Highland history.
Willie became a senior lecturer in 1965 and, in recognition of his superb
edition of the poems of Roderick Morrison, the Blind Harper, he became Reader
in Celtic in 1972.
These were eventful years in university life and Willie's time at Edinburgh saw
great changes in the status of Gaelic language and literature as subjects of
study. The rise of interest in the language in the 1960s led to his becoming
the first teacher of an intensive beginners' class in a modern language in the
University of Edinburgh.
He brought memorable clarity and precision to his explanation of the details of
grammar so that many ex-pupils can to this day quote his very words on vexed
points of Gaelic grammar or syntax.
At the same time he embarked on a long-term project of recording, in the most
authoritative and authentic way possible, the great collection of songs he had
been amassing since his student days.
He had realised early on that the traditional versions of Gaelic songs could be
set beside the texts and tunes collected in earlier centuries. They could offer
a means to recapture or reconstruct the total performance of this precious but
neglected heritage. This solitary task was to be with him until his retirement
from the university in 1980 and remains, in the archives of the School of
Scottish Studies, a monument as enduring as any of his published works.
He was also generous in imparting his songs to other singers, especially
younger singers, and in that way he made a more powerful impact on the revival
of traditional Gaelic singing than may at first sight appear.
He was in his latter years a genial and endearing companion, with original and
sometimes unexpected views on almost any subject that offered intellectual
challenge. He was clubbable and loved to hold the floor. He would challenge
authority in debate, but was kind to people who showed forgivable ignorance.
The fact that he had thought things through from first principles gave him a
confidence which enabled him to assert the validity of an oral tradition
against a written source.
At the time of his Readership, Professor David Greene of Dublin stated that:
``If there were such a post as a Professorship of Scottish Gaelic, I would say
that William Matheson would not only be the outstanding candidate for it; I
would go further and say that nobody in the past has been better equipped for
it and that, alas, it is unlikely that anybody will be equally well equipped in
the future.''
Sadly, Willie was not able to achieve in his retirement all that he had
planned. But in the adversity of Parkinson's disease he found the strength to
continue working on family history and on committing to paper the repertoire of
unpublished Gaelic words and sayings which he had heard in his youth.
The poet Rob Donn said of his patron, John Mackay of Musal, words that would be
equally applicable to Willie Matheson:
Cait an teid sinn a
dh'fhaotainn
Duine sheasas 'nad fhine,
An rathad tionail no sgaoilidh?

YOUR correspondent William C Wolfe (November 21) appears to be suffering from
that strange affliction which affects SNP supporters, the perpetuating of myths
about Scotland's financial situation within the Union.
He asserts: ``Scottish taxpayers have subsidised other parts of the UK for
generations; ie, taxation spent in Scotland has been far short of a fair share
of what has been raised in Scotland. This has been shown to be the case time
and again since the 1940s''. Eh, no.
The facts are that Scotland contributes around 8% of total taxation revenue
going into the Exchequer, and receives between 10% and 11% of total UK
Government expenditure through the Barnett formula which Michael Forsyth
managed to preserve in the face of Treasury dogma during the latest round of
departmental spending cuts.
Therefore it is quite clear that Scotland receives more than her fair share,
and for that we should be grateful to the Scottish Secretary. And what
``proof'' has there been since the 1940s anyway? Answer - none whatsoever.
Briefly, on a related point, the SNP were reported delighted during the week
when John Major stated that Scotland could survive on her own with five million
people and a steadily improving economy. Alex Salmond took this as proof that
they had finally won the argument, but he was sadly wrong again.
Of course Scotland could survive on her own, a fact which has never been in
doubt. The message that we have given to the electorate for years is that the
Scottish economy would never manage to survive the actual process of
independence, that the effect and the costs would be totally destructive.
It is simply not worth putting the Scottish people through that when we can
stay in a Union which has served us well for just short of three centuries.
Why destroy everything by taking a step into the dark? Why trust our future to
people who, as Mr Wolfe and the SNP's pathetic ``Budget'' showed recently, have
not the faintest idea of how to do a few basic sums and face basic economic
reality, never mind run a country?

IT comes as a surprise to be reminded that of that triumvirate of theatrical
knights who dominated the British theatre for almost half a century, Olivier,
Gielgud and Richardson, the first to be knighted was Ralph Richardson, possibly
the least remembered at the moment of the trio.
He got his knighthood in the 1947 New Year Honours, a deeply jealous Olivier
had to wait six months for the Birthday Honours for his, while Gielgud was out
in the cold until the Coronation list in 1953.
Gielgud is still with us, the theatrical equivalent of the Queen Mother, a
much-loved institution in his own right. As for Olivier, his reputation is
probably at its nadir, and it is currently modish to sneer at his mannerisms
and tricks in performance. But nobody seems to bother about Richardson, who, in
his prime, managed to be what neither of the others succeeded in becoming - a
genuine star in both the cinema and the theatre.
He was a strange man, prone to violent outbursts, and patently haunted by
demons, who disliked directors, and was ruthless with underlings who dared
upstage him. He loved motor bikes, drank gin like water, kept ferrets and had a
Spanish-speaking parrot called Jose, which he treated like a human being.
Audiences loved him, and his colleagues, in spite of all the difficulties of
coping with such an unpredictable man, found him inspiring. John Miller has
turned to many of them in his attempt to analyse what made a Richardson
performance and the result is a fascinating, detailed picture of the actor at
work. Where this admirable, highly readable books falls down is in its portrait
of the private man. We learn very little about Richardson as a husband - he was
married twice, and had a son, Charles, by his second wife, Meriel Forbes.
Charles appears a couple of times and then completely disappears from his
father's life, or so it seems.
The book records Richardson's long pre-war career and the origins of his
lifelong theatrical partnership and friendship with Gielgud. He was one of the
truly great Falstaffs, a wonderful Peer Gynt, a superb Sir Peter Teazle, an
immaculate performer of the plays of J B Priestley, while in the cinema he was
mesmerising in films like The Fallen Idol, The Sound Barrier and The Heiress.
Gielgud, who contributes an admiring preface, recalls how, when he was
directing School for Scandal, Richardson as Sir Peter, worried about how to
make his first entrance, got stuck during rehearsals. ``Should I have a
newspaper in my hand? A walking-stick? Or be taking snuff, perhaps?,'' he would
ask. At last, one morning he walked down to the footlights and announced -
``You know, Johnny, I prayed to God last night to tell me how to come on in
this opening scene, and this morning God answered `Do what it says in the text,
just come on'. ''
WILLIAM RUSSELL
WHISKY
WHAT is now known as ``the licensed trade'' used not to be: it was called, when
I was in it many years back, ``the spirit trade''. And if you see sometimes
some old pub which has a sign on its windows stating ``Wine and Spirits'' you
might well wonder. Back in the nineteenth century the temperance people tried
to close all pubs and taverns, and anywhere which purveyed liquor at all. They
switched eventually to giving licences to beer shops and closing all inns which
sold spirits across a counter. It never worked, and pubs opened everywhere for
the sale of spirits.
Beer is a thin drink, and with licensing laws as draconian as they were it was
small wonder that small beer became relegated to small chasers with large gills
and half gills of spirits. In Scotland, whisky had played a part for centuries
with illicit distilling ending with a genuine retail industry. And of all the
spirits, the one which ended as the biggest seller of them all was . . . the
illicit one. Whisky.
Whisky is now so large and immovable an industry that no other spirit comes
close to it in fame and volume of traffic, and needless to say, the bulk of the
pages of the late Gordon Brown's book on spirits is taken up with Scotch. Brown
died just last year, after a distinguished career as journalistic toper, or
even the other way round. (He wrote a regular column on the old booze for the
Guardian). His book on the geography of the Whisky Trails was a splendid text
for anybody interested in whisky.
And now there is this book on Classic Spirits of the World. Well there aren't
any, in my view, except whisky. I might allow Irish whisk(e)y, but that's about
it. All the others are low young things, with bare feet and ragged dresses,
still too young to put their hair up. What is more they admit it and so does
Gordon Brown.
Scotch has to state its age, and it is the youngest whisky which goes into the
marriage, be they malts, single or vatted, or blends, which is stated on the
label on the bottle. Thus you can find a whisky which describes itself as
five-year-old but which can, and often does, have a 25-year-old and older malt
in it. And every Scotch, even the humblest, has to be at least three years old.
Scotch is unique in that and paying the price for its age and quality for it is
by no means cheap to store all these casks in bond for all these years. It is
not thus with other spirits.
And what a lot of them there are. Brown goes through them. Brandies and
cognacs, gins and genevers. Vodkas and schnappses. Aqua vitae comes out in many
a guise. Sometimes it is next door to poteen or even worse rotgut. The French
marc and the Italian grappa both taste like old raincoats which have been
pissed on for years by elderly wet Airedales. Until recently both drinks were
almost entirely illicit anyway and mightily adulterated by industrial alcohols
when they came to the outlets.
Ironically the now largely prohibitionist Arabs invented spirits and the word
``alcohol'' or alkhul derives from Arabic. This book is not only informative in
every spirit and liqueur you have ever heard of, the pageantry of the
photographs makes it worth buying just as a damned art object. So buy it.
From Canongate we find yet another addition to the genre, The Malt Whisky File.
In much the same format as Wallace Milroy's classic slip-in-the-pocket books it
is equally informative, certainly less subjective, but perhaps not as
entertaining in idiosyncrasy. But no connoisseur of whisky should be without
this well-produced little hardback either for there are some background details
of the distilleries themselves which Milroy (and indeed the other well-known
whisky chronicler Michael Jackson) often left out due to their rather insider
assumption that everybody knows that stuff anyway.
I have often thought that a nice wee play or even novel could be written about
whisky reps. The legendary whisky drummers such as Dougie Renfrew or George
Thompson or Andy . . . I'd better leave his name out for he still supplies me
with some out-of-the way malts. The legendary whisky reps used to drop into
pubs I have known.
``Well Michael, and how is Anna this weather your eldest must just be finishing
at the yooni the wee lassie got into Fernhill did she have a dram yersel wan
fur Jack here and his pal ah'll be getting away . . . '' Then the stop at the
door. ``Ah'll be forgettin' mah name next. Wid ye want an order next week?''.
They always got an order the auld fellows. Like something out of Neil Munro's
Erchie stories, the old whisky reps spread themselves throughout Scotland,
selling their wares with a panache and an impertinence which gladdened the
heart. Today the whisky reps are leggy girls with clipboards who don't sell
anything like as much as the old lags of the whisky circuit.
I looked forward to Malcolm Greenwood's A Nip Around the World; thought it
would be about the whisky lads in their dapper suits and 40 years worth of
selling our most famous product. Well, Greenwood's book isn't. Malcolm is
indeed a whisky salesman but at international level. Somebody told him that his
reminiscences were worth a book. I heard Malcolm on radio last week and he
sounded witty and amusing. Sadly his book of tales of his trade did not meet
that. What makes a damned good anecdote doesn't work, sometimes, in print.
We have a last book on uisge-beatah: Make Your Own Scotch Whisky. Rowland Emmet
did the illustrations and they are a bit thin. Anyway I am not sure this book
is legal. Making your own Scotch most certainly isn't. On the other hand, it
tells you how to make Scotch and is perhaps one of the most informative books
on the water of life (you can call it research when the excisemen catch up with
you), and no imbiber should be without this, just for daftness. Dafter yet: I
was allowed to see an illicit whisky, just for photographic purposes. You
believe that, you'll believe anything. Cheers.

THE hills are alive with the sound of the British. The up-market resort of
Courchevel 1850 in the biggest ski area in the world, France's Three Valleys,
has developed a distinct English ring, with not a little twang of Scottish.
Courchevel 1850, and its sister resorts of 1650 and 1550, have always been
popular with Brits inclined towards inclines but now it seems our native tongue
has taken over and is spoken by staff in every bar, restaurant, and shop. By
the way, the numbers refer to the height in metres although it could just as
easily be the price of a meal. Not only the air gets rarer as the altitude
increases.
Obviously, the main attraction is the magnificent skiing but another
contributing factor is the top-class instruction offered by the Scots-run Ski
Masterclass. Kenny Dickson and his wife, Sue, have gathered together a highly
qualified group of British instructors who received nothing but praise from
every pupil I spoke to.
The Dicksons go back to Aviemore every summer where they used to teach skiing
and still have a home. Because of this link, there always seems to be someone
from the Spey valley in Courchevel, either on holiday or working as an
instructor.
Courchevel 1850 is a pleasant mix of modern hotel blocks, traditional mountain
architecture, and sumptuous chalets. It is the nicest of the three Courchevels
and head and shoulders above other Trois Vallee resorts like the bleak Val
Thorens and Les Menuires.
I stayed with Ski Activity in the Ski Lodge in the town centre, three minutes
walk from the slopes and a short stagger from bars and restaurants. Actually,
the nearest bar was only a short fall down the stairs as the lodge had it own
hostelry on the ground floor, Tee-Jays, which had the lowest prices in the
resort.
The Ski Lodge offers basic but comfortable accomodation on a chalet basis.
Activity's main base in the resort is Le Tournier, a chalet hotel close to the
slopes which has a warm, friendly dining room and excellent food and wine.
It is always a good omen when a holiday starts with something going wrong but
turning out to a blessing in disguise. Gils, the geographically challenged
driver of the bus which took us from Geneva to Courchevel, was driving so fast
over a sleeping policeman that the bus's engine hit the concrete, cracking the
sump, and liberating all the oil. Disaster you might think. Not at all. We all
trotted off to a nearby supermarket for beer and nibbles, and spent an
enjoyable hour getting to know our fellow skiers in the warm sunshine. We were
almost disappointed when the replacement bus arrived.
That set the tone for the first three days of our holiday. The sun blazed down
during the day on Les Trois Valles and it snowed at night.
Courchevel valley has 26 green, 27 blue, 36 red, and 11 black runs, and
combined with the other two valleys - Meribel and Beauville - the ski area is
immense. There are almost too many runs to choose from. The Courchevel valley
would be more than enough to satisfy me for one week but because the other two
valleys are just over the hill you feel obliged to ski over and try them out.
On the fourth day of our stay, the weather closed in with rain and cloud
creating poor visibility. It did not seem that bad compared to Scottish skiing
conditions but it prompted the cancellation of an extreme skiing competition in
Courchevel's Grand Couloir, which had attracted skiing notables such as
American Glen Plake, he of the 2ft orange Mohican haircut and star of many ski
videos.
It seemed strange that the world's toughest skiers should be put off by a wee
bit of mist. Perhaps it would have played havoc with Mr Plake's famous tresses.
In a way, that summed up Courchevel. A cut above the rest.
n Fergus Wyllie travelled with Ski Activity, of 23 Blair Street, Edinburgh.
Prices for one week on chalet basis at the Ski Lodge range from #289 to #539
and at Le Tournier from #349 to #609.

Elizabeth Buie looks back over 60 years of a clean and renewable technology
SIXTY years ago, the fishermen, landowners, and councillors were flatly opposed
to Britain's first major hydro-electric power scheme in Galloway.
It would damage the landscape, the fisheries, and mining interests, they said.
But the partners in the Power Traction Finance Company were determined to
succeed in their venture - and they did. In fact, this consortium acted as a
forerunner to the business groupings that are now being formed to develop
projects through the Government's private finance initiative.
In only one of many parallels with similar developments today, this pioneering
company had to appoint a consultant pisciculturist (a specialist in fish
culture) to protect fishing interests. It also had to make compensatory
payments to local landowners, and it had to set up a scenery committee.
Nowadays, hydro power is recognised as probably the cheapest form of energy to
operate, and the least polluting. But if it is to have a future it will be in
the form of small to medium-size generation plants - at least in the developed
world.
Back in 1935, there was just as much opposition to a major new power
development as there would be today.
The Galloway Hydro-Electric Scheme originally comprised five power stations,
together with their associated dams, tunnels, and pipelines. At the time of its
construction, it was the first integrated scheme in Britain designed for the
purposes of public electricity supply. For although hydro-electric generation
existed in the North of Scotland at the time the Galloway scheme was
commissioned, it was aimed specifically at providing electricity for particular
processes, such as the aluminium plant at Foyers.
Plans for the scheme were developed in the 1920s - electricity as a commodity
had grown significantly in popularity in the years following the First World
War.
The proposal to develop Galloway's hydro resources was made in 1923 by three
Kirkcudbrightshire residents - Major Wellwood Maxwell, Captain Scott Elliot,
and Colonel William McLellan, an engineer and partner in the firm Merz and
McLellan.
But their grand plan remained in the back of a drawer until the publication of
the Electricity Supply Act in 1926. The Act created the Central Electricity
Board which was to be responsible for the development of an electricity network
for Britain. Its role was to plan for the creation of a national grid and it
had powers to ``select'' which generating stations would be linked into it. By
the late 1920s it had been decided that the first grid scheme in Scotland would
include a link between Carlisle and Kilmarnock - the green light for power
generated in Galloway to be transmitted into the West of Scotland's population
centres.
Merz and McLellan, in conjunction with civil engineers Sir Alexander Gibb and
Partners, approached the Power Traction Finance Co Ltd to ask for their backing
for a Bill to promote the scheme.
The Power Traction Finance Co, a consortium of engineering companies, plant
manufacturers, and an insurance company - namely Sir William Arrol, Messrs John
Brown, Cammel Laird, English Electric, and the Prudential Insurance Co -
combined engineering expertise with financial power. Its members also had a
successful track record in developing hydro-electricity.
The next stage was to win the hearts and minds of potential objectors to the
scheme.
The provision of a cheap electricity supply to Ayr Town Council in exchange for
their rights to the development of hydro power on Loch Doon, and a promise to
Kirkcudbright County Council to give first priority to the recruitment of local
unemployed during the construction phase secured two important early victories.
But there were objections from local landowners over the impact of the scheme
on the landscape and heritage of the area, and from fisheries boards regarding
the amount of compensation water allocated for the preservation of fisheries.
Then the Mining Association of Great Britain lodged objections on the grounds
that the scheme would have a detrimental effect on the coal industry.
Eventually, the fisheries boards withdrew their protests following the
appointment of a consultant pisciculturist. Landowners accepted significant
financial deals. The mining fraternity's arguments were countered by evidence
that other coal-producing nations had developed hydro-electricity with no
negative effects on mining.
In 1931, the CEB granted all five power stations in the Galloway scheme -
Kendoon, Carsfad, Earlstoun, Glenlee, and Tongland - ``selected'' status. It
was the signal for construction to begin.
The project cost almost #3m to complete and at the height of construction some
2000 men were employed, representing a major boost during the depressed 1930s.
Loch Doon Castle, the finest example of a Norman fortress in Scotland, was
moved, stone by stone, from its original location on an islet to a new site at
the side of the loch.
And to preserve the Doon as a prime salmon water, fish ladders and passes were
constructed to allow salmon to return from the sea to their spawning grounds.
In 1935, Glenlee and Tongland power stations first supplied electricity to the
grid. It cost 0.109d per unit.
Today, on the sixtieth anniversary of the scheme, the original turbines still
generate electricity for the Scottish grid. In fact, the stations' operator
ScottishPower is developing a new control system which will be the first of its
kind in the UK, enabling six power stations (Drumjohn was later added to the
original five) to be controlled out of hours by a computer.
The scheme produces 8% of ScottishPower's output and is its cheapest.
Jack Kelly, manager (Hydros) with ScottishPower, said: ``It is part of our
industrial heritage. It has been there for 60 years and there is no reason why
it should not be there for another 60 years provided we invest in the scheme.''
MOST environmentalists today would not argue with him that hydro power has a
future - provided that any new schemes are small enough in scale not to have
too great an impact on remote areas, habitats, and people's livelihoods.
Some suggest that flow levels have not always been set at the right levels, and
some power generators, such as Hydro-Electric are collaborating in research in
this area. Some fishermen are not convinced that fish ladders eliminate the
problems faced by salmon returning upriver.
But hydro is indisputably one of the cleanest technologies as well as being
renewable. Unlike nuclear and coal-powered generator stations, it has no impact
on global warming.
Nevertheless, the landscape lobby is unlikely ever to permit the construction
of another scheme in Scotland the size of the Galloway scheme. The future for
hydro is likely to be lots of little stations, maybe as small as 2MW to 4MW.

A CLEAR signal yesterday that manufacturing industry is continuing to weaken
and that price pressures do not pose an inflationary threat added to already
feverish market speculation that the Chancellor would soon slice another half
point off base rates.
It is thought this could even come after his next monthly monetary meeting with
the Governor of the Bank of England on December 13.
The Chancellor, though, with an eye on the pound's vulnerability, may prefer to
leave well alone and it is doubtful if the Governor would support a reduction
at this time, even if the Bank is no longer calling for an increase.
The fresh round of cuts in mortgage rates - others were following suit
yesterday - together with the tax reductions anounced in the Budget could have
taken some of the pressure off the Chancellor, but some market operators
believe that his Budget growth projections are too optimistic without a fillip
from lower rates.
Many economists, including the CBI's who now regard a !s-point reduction as
``sustainable'', are looking for a cut, though a number think not until the New
Year, with Goldman Sachs going for a one-point reduction by mid-1996.
Their case was strengthened with the release of the Purchasing Managers' Index
from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply which showed a fall in
the index to 49.6 in November from October's 50.5.
Any number below 50 denotes a contraction and this is first time this has
happened since November 1992.
The index has shown a steady downward trend since peaking at 61.6 in mid-1994.
At the same time, the number of companies reporting lower prices exceeded the
number reporting increases for the first time in two years.
The survey echoes the message from other surveys and official data in recent
months that the main risk to growth in the near-term is a period of severe
destocking.
Securities House James Capel's Adam Cole says that while the data clearly
support the case for a near-term reduction in base rates, further evidence that
the Chancellor's growth forecasts are too optimistic is required before rates
come down. This points to early next year as the most likely time for a rate
reduction.
Also released yesterday were figures from the Bank of England showing that net
consumer credit lending rose to #872m in October compared with #640n in
September. This was considerably above market expectations which had centred on
a figure approaching #600m and a large increase over the #430m notched up in
October last year.
Lending by credit card firms rose to #249m from September's #190m. The consumer
credit figures are somewhat at odds with retail spending, with High Street
sales staying flat. Month-on-month sales actually fell 0.1% in October.
However, one month's figures in isolation have to be treated with caution and
while they could be taken to indicate an improvement in consumer confidence,
the credit data have consistently outperformed actual spending in 1995.
One analyst suggested the October rise could be due to either consumer
desperation or optimism, whether people are falling back on credit to maintain
their standards of living or whether they are being adventurous. Certainly, it
in no way dampened market enthusiasm on interest rates, though the Governor of
the Bank of England may look askance.
Mortgage lending data from the Bank shows that the number of loans approved
appears to have firmed in recent months. However, the data also shows that
across the mortgage market as a whole - covering banks, building societies and
other specialist lenders - there were only modest amounts of lending in October.
Gross mortgage lending in October totalled #4650m, almost the same as in
September, but lower than the #4750m in October 1994. Net lending totalled
#925m, a worsening since #1190m, and also lower than the #1540m in October last
year.
However, both the number and value of loan approvals (promises to lend) were
more positive. The value of approvals totalled #4800m compared with #4400m in
September and #4600m in October last year. The number of loan approvals was
78,000 against 73,000 in September and 80,000 a year ago.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, commented,
``The housing market is not yet out of the woods of recession, but there are
some positive signs. While lenders are cautious of welcoming what could be
another `false dawn', the approvals figures seem to indicate that the housing
market's low point occurred in the summer and that we are now in a period of
fragile equilibrium.''
He added, ``Given that by the middle of next year households will be feeling
the impact not only of the recent mortgage rate reductions but also of the
Budget tax cuts, the hope that confidence can improve seems stronger now than
at any time in the last 12 months.''
Goldman Sachs' economist takes the view that although the mortgage rate cuts
announced by lenders this week will further help, with activity in the rest of
the economy faltering, the housing market is likely to remain weak for a
considerable time to come.

IN his weekly articles, John Macleod has been consistent on two counts: in the
vilification of Roman Catholicism and in his ignorance of that same faith.
His article about the vote on the Divorce Bill in Ireland (November 28) is a
hotch-potch of sarcasm, malevolence, ignorance, and bigotry which, truly, would
not be out of place in a football fanzine.
Eamon de Valera, the Dail, the Irish people (how dare they have a 90% Catholic
population?), Ireland itself (poor and boggy), the Pope, the Roman Catholic
Church, an un-named bishop, and Fr Brendan Smyth all come in for lashings of
abuse from the ``Wee Free'' caped crusader.
It is true that, in the moral dilemmas of recent times such as abortion,
divorce, and contraception, the Catholic Church has maintained a firm,
traditional line whereas Reformed Churches have adopted a more pragmatic
approach.
In both cases, however, memberships are still dropping and it's now time that
we Christians, of all denominations, realise that we have more in common with
each other than that which divides us. We must work and pray together to ensure
that there will be a future of Christianity in the new millennium.
In our increasingly secular society, there are no easy solutions but surely we
should expect something more constructive from a Christian journalist in one of
our ``quality'' newspapers.
The irony of it all is that we in Scotland will never have the chance to
challenge the respective moralities of Church versus State in a referendum
since the Church of Scotland has ceased to be a part of the everyday lives of
most Scots.
The fact that the Catholic Church is still such an integral part of the lives
of many Irish people is to be envied rather than mocked. Wouldn't we Scottish
Christians (of all denominations) be happy to see such vibrant religious and
moral debate in our own country?
John Macleod's article has a coldness about it. He is fond of quoting Holy
Scripture so perhaps he has noticed that Jesus said to his disciples: ``A new
commandment I give to you: to love one another as I have loved you''.

Portland
TWO former British disciples of an Indian love cult were jailed for five years
each by a court in Portland Oregon today for conspiring to kill a US federal
prosecutor.
Sally Anne Croft and Susan Hagan were found guilty last July of plotting, with
others, to murder Oregon state attorney Charles Turner in 1985. Sentence had
been deferred until today.
Mr Turner was never assaulted or harmed in any way.
Miss Croft, 45, a former chartered accountant with City auditors Ernst &amp; Young,
and Mrs Hagan, 48, an aromatherapist who devotes much of her life to treating
Aids patients, quit the Bhagwan cult in 1985 in disillusionment.
At the time, the two women were among the top officials at the Oregon commune
founded by followers of the late Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, advocate
of free love and lavish spending.
They had fought a lengthy battle against extradition before being deported to
the US earlier this year.
State attorney Turner, who has since retired, led a grand jury investigation
that resulted in charges of widespread immigration fraud at the cult's vast
commune in central Oregon.
Witnesses said Miss Croft, who was the cult's chief financial officer, provided
funding for gun-buying trips associated with the murder plot, which was never
carried out.
Mrs Hagan was also implicated as a top official in the cult hierarchy.
US District Judge Malcolm Clark said his verdict attempted to balance the
community work of the two women since they fled the United States after the
break-up of the guru's 4000-member cult against the seriousness of their crime.
Lawyers for both women said they would appeal against the sentences although
both had faced possible life terms.
The judge ordered the women to report to federal prison in Washington state on
January 12. They will be eligible for parole after 20 months.
The women were linked to the plot to kill Turner by testimony from five former
commune members, who made deals with the government for their testimony and had
admitted lying in the past.
Defence lawyers tried to discredit the former Rajneesh followers. However, they
called only one witness, another former follower who contradicted a small part
of the prosecutors' case.
Three former commune leaders also have been charged in the plot against Turner,
but remain fugitives.
The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh became notorious in the early Eighties for his 93
Rolls Royces, #2m watch, and teachings on ``cosmic orgasms''.
He was eventually deported from the United States after pleading guilty to
arranging sham marriages for his followers for immigration purposes.
He died in his native India in 1990, leaving his Oregon community shattered and
many of its members facing legal charges.
State investigators say the sect was responsible, among other things, for the
biggest illegal wire-tapping operation in US history, an arson attack on a
county planning office, an attempt to manipulate local election results, and
the poisoning of a restaurant salad bar that led to an outbreak of
salmonella.-Reuter/AP.

Larnaca
A BRITISH soldier accused of killing a Danish tour-guide in Cyprus confessed to
a police officer within hours of his arrest that he bludgeoned her to death
with a spade, a Cyprus court was told.
Chief Inspector Charalambos Argyrou quoted Alan Ford, 27, as saying: ``I killed
the girl. I hit her twice with a spade on the head.''
Argyrou told the court in Larnaca that he had questioned Ford over the
disappearance of 23-year-old Louise Jensen.
Ford and two other British soldiers charged with Jensen's abduction,
manslaughter, and conspiracy to rape have all pleaded not guilty.
The statement took lawyers for both the prosecution and defence by surprise and
the bench ruled it should be ignored.
Ford, face flushed and obviously annoyed, walked over to Argyrou, who was
sitting in the witness box after the judge left the courtroom, and demanded to
know why he had not said anything sooner. Argyrou ignored him.
``He's talking bullshit,'' Ford was overheard saying to his co-defendants Jeff
Pernell, 23, and Justin Fowler, 27.
The court went on to discuss whether an eight-page statement allegedly made by
Ford one day after he was detained was admissible evidence.
The defence says it was not voluntary, but given after police told Ford his two
co-defendants had already incriminated him in their own statements.
Earlier this week the court threw out defence objections to the admissibility
of testimony that Pernell had blamed Ford for what happened to Jensen when he
told a policeman ``Alan did it.''
The three soldiers, stationed at the British base of Dhekelia, are accused of
bundling Jensen into their mini-Moke after knocking her off her boyfriend's
motorcycle near Ayia Napa holiday resort 14 months ago. Her battered body was
found in a shallow roadside grave two days later.
The hearing continues.
q Another court in Larnaca today fined a British soldier #930 for negligent
driving in an accident in which two Pakistani students died earlier this year.
Lance Corporal Gareth Austin, 24, of the Royal Greenjackets, was banned from
driving for two years.-Reuter

Veronica, Lady Gainford; born March 3, 1900, died November 6, 1995
VERONICA Gainford, had a remarkable memory - what sometimes seemed like total
recall; of the books she read, of the volumes of poetry she learnt as a girl,
of the appearance of the world in which she grew up and of public events
throughout this century.
It is difficult to conceive that an event as utterly remote as the death of
Edward VII in 1910 could be vividly recalled by someone alive until
``yesterday''; or the sinking of the Titanic, or seeing Pavlova dance and
theatre productions by Granville Barker. Memories of being taken as a little
girl to call on Florence Nightingale, of having Baden-Powell as a god-father;
of being taught to fly by Val Baker, who also taught Amy Johnson. She recounted
her childhood and youth in a compelling memoir privately published in 1992.
She was the only child of Sir George Noble, 2nd Baronet of Ardmore and
Ardarden, elder son of Sir Andrew Noble, who came from Dunbartonshire and who
became chairman of Armstrong Whitworth on the Tyne.
Her mother, Molly Waters, was one of a large Irish family; another of the girls
married George Noble's younger brother John. Veronica Noble grew up with lots
of cousins and her descriptions of life in the large houses of well-to-do
Edwardians make fascinating reading, particularly her accounts of holidays
spent at her grandfather's houses, Jesmond outside Newcastle and Ardkinglas on
the shores of Loch Fyne.
``Twelve Nobles are always talking at once, six can't hear and the other six
won't listen,'' she said described fairly well the family meals. Her parents
seem to have believed in education, even for a girl, and she had a succession
of governesses as well as attending St Paul's and the famous Northlands, kept
by Sophy Weisse, a woman of German extraction who had been at school with
Robert Louis Stevenson and whose father had settled in Edinburgh as the ``only
truly liberal town'' in Europe. At Northlands games were not of high importance
but Ellen Terry came to talk about Shakespeare and Mme Suggia to play her cello.
The First World War spelled the end of a certain way of life but in 1919 George
Noble took his daughter by air to Paris in a Handley Page bomber done up to
accommodate passengers with mauve satin brocade and wicker armchairs. During
the war, at the age of 17, she had learnt to drive a car and in 1916 got to
ride in one of the first tanks, made at the Armstrong factory at Elswick. She
also learned dairy farming, book binding, spinning, embroidery, and knitting;
her knitting skills were exceptional, as was her knowledge of the traditional
Highland crafts. Later she collected and published a book of patterns for kilt
hose which ran to four editions and has now been taken over and re-published by
enthusiasts in the United States.
Following her marriage in 1921 to Joseph Pease, of the Yorkshire mine-owning
family, whose forebear had backed George Stephenson's Stockton and Darlington
Railway, she went to live in Yorkshire at Swale, Richmond. Her three sons were
born in 1921, 1926, and 1930, and family life was combined with what sounds
like a somewhat hectic social whirl, revolving round the racing calendar and
the sporting seasons.
Veronica herself enjoyed fishing, stalking, and swimming. In 1935, while
staying at Glen Fyne Lodge for the fishing she saw, fell in love with, and
bought Taynish near Tayvallich and by the autumn she and her family had moved
in. They lived in this magic place until the terrible fire in 1955; three miles
of pot-holed track to the nearest telephone didn't help extinguish the flames
quickly.
After the Second World War the two older Pease boys resumed their studies in
Edinburgh and visits to Taynish became a keenly anticipated pleasure for their
friends. Joe (who succeeded to the title in 1943) and Veronica Gainford worked
very hard to provide a warm welcome, plentiful home-grown food, including milk,
eggs and vegetables, and endless activity and laughter. Changed circumstances
and post-war austerity had not diminished the skills of such generous hosts.
Veronica Gainford took an active part in the life of the village and country
during the 60 years she lived there. She was a member of the central council of
the SWRI for many years and for a period chairman of the Argyll federation.
Later she published a book on Tayvallich and Taynish which is a mine of
information on local history, families, farming, buildings, flora and fauna.
The Taynish peninsula itself is one of the largest remaining oak woods left in
Britain. Much of it was acquired by Scottish National Heritage and since 1977
has been run as a national nature reserve.
Veronica Gainford had friends of all ages and a wide range of interests. She
loved company but needed solitude for spiritual nourishment.
For a number of years she was interested in the teachings of Ouspensky and the
ideas of the great Jesuit palaeontologist Teilhard de Chardin. Until last year
she made an annual visit to Iona; in the special qualities of the island she
found spiritual and physical replenishment. She asserted that after being there
a few days she could walk right across the hilly island which she couldn't do
on arrival!
In her 80's she took part in a 12-mile sponsored walk from Lochgilphead to
Tayvallich. She led the reels at her crowded 90th birthday party and we were
all confidently looking forward to her 100th. Only a few days before her death
she was alert and enjoying a dram and a joke with friends or relatives but her
20-year battle against cancer was finally lost on November 6.

THE Herald seems to think that because John Macleod can string together some
words in a clever manner, that somehow justifies a regular column, not to
mention a contribution to his bank balance. Does The Herald not realise how
continually offensive this person can be to those who contribute to its bank
balance? Not because Macleod holds views reminiscent of 1930s Germany do I
write. It's The Herald using good rain-forest trees to encourage him, that's
what puzzles me.
Surely his articles are published solely for their controversy value, not for
intelligent grown-up people?
We are, at least most of us, products of our early environment, brought up the
way our mammies and daddies thought proper. If this meant going to mass, or
church service, or synagogue, or mosque, so be it, for in most cases it was
done with the best of intentions, and to instil a sense of goodness.
John Macleod, in his perverse way, sniggers self-righteously, like an
adolescent, at the beliefs of others, and in public. I wonder how he would feel
reading an article written in the same bile-style, about how his mammy and
daddy brought him up.
Like fundamentalists the world over, Macleod has a fundamental ignorance of
life. Not only as it is, but as it should be. I suggest he goes to work with
the tabloids, where most of his like-thinkers reside. There at least he'll have
a captured audience who'll probably think he's intelligent.

IN both his Budget statement last year and the later ``mini-Budget'' the
Chancellor announced rises in funding for the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme
(HEES) to its present level of #100m a year. He gave an unqualified assurance
that this level would be maintained until April 1998.
No mention of HEES was made in this year's statement to the House. It now
emerges in the subsequent departmental small print that funding will be cut by
#31m from April next year.
Persons over 60 who now qualify for a full grant to insulate their homes will
have the entitlement cut to 25%. If they are not on benefits, it is assumed
they have the means to pay. This is described by the Department of the
Environment as better targeting for those ``in greatest need''.
The truth is, of course, that the Chancellor was in a panic last year over
national outrage at the proposed second stage increase in VAT on fuel. He now
regrets offering help in reducing fuel bills to the over-60s, and believes
public interest in this issue has waned - or that we won't notice.
But note the failure of nerve. When he increases HEES funding, the announcement
is made with a fanfare in his Budget speech. When he cuts back, not a whisper.
And yet another Government promise, made to Parliament, has been broken within
a year.
HEES represents remarkable value for the taxpayer. Every pound spent gives a
reduction in fuel bills, hence an effective increase in income, for ever. There
are significant reductions in atmospheric pollution, which the Government
professes to be not just a national but a global priority.
Thousands of much-needed jobs have so far been created - of precisely the kind
the economy has been losing. They are local and semi-skilled. The, often young,
people engaged in HEES work have gained vocational qualifications, a real
income, and the pride of delivering a valued service to others in the community
who are elderly or in need.
Well, so much for all that! The equation is brutally simple. A 31% cut in HEES
funds will mean a 31% cut in jobs. Many of those with jobs now were previously
unemployed. Next year they will be back on the Broo. So from the supposed
saving of #31m must be deducted both the financial and social costs of
unemployment. This is the economics of the madhouse.
Meanwhile, we learn that the same amount, #100m, that will insulate 600,000
cold British houses this year, is to go in profits to the shareholders of
Yorkshire Water. The country's future, it seems, lies in not supplying water.

CONNOISSEURS of irony will, as much as optimists, enjoy contemplating President
Clinton's remarkable success in the British Isles. The ironists' pleasure
derives from the way in which Mr Clinton, who promised a near return to
isolationism to win the presidency, has been forced by domestic failure to the
foreign fields which seemed so unappealing when tilled by Mr Bush. Mr Clinton
has, so far, been defeated by domestic problems but has enjoyed a run of
foreign-policy successes whose significance is considerable - the Middle East,
Bosnia, and now, possibly, Ireland. The optimists may not even accept the
qualification: and it is undeniably true that Mr Clinton has neither put a foot
nor a word wrong all week. He has achieved a near miracle, saying what both
Irish traditions wanted to hear. It is possible that he was set up and cleverly
exploited by the Irish-American (shorthand for nationalist) lobby but that
hardly matters when he has managed to cross the traditional Irish divide.
(Perhaps someone has pointed out to him that there are far more Protestant
Irishmen in the US electorate than there are Catholic, though it is the latter
who are organised.)
The President was always on to a good thing. A phenomenon of our times is the
way in which major political figures often carry more clout abroad than at home
- Mrs Thatcher and Mr Gorbachev are quick examples which prove the point; but
Mr Clinton has shown himself to be in the same mould. He went down well here -
deliberately and explicitly reviving the ``special relationship'', to the point
of naming a new powerful US warship after a famous British Premier, the
half-American Churchill. It may be protested that much of his effort, including
the vessel's name, is concerned with mere symbol, but in an Irish context the
symbolic has a contemporary resonance which is rare, possibly even unique. The
significance of Mr Clinton's visit, and its accompanying promises, is all
practical, and designed for today and tomorrow notwithstanding its use of the
past and its ability to deploy symbolic code.
If his imprint was as bold and popular as his appeal, there was little room to
doubt the extent to which the field was prepared. The hunger for peace in
Ireland is as evident as the bankruptcy of the gunmen. At the very least Mr
Clinton's visit must make it harder for the extremists - on both sides - to
resort again to violence. The chance of disarmament has been advanced, though
that does not mean that the hard-line Republicans have been convinced: one
reason for their holding on to the gun is their poor record at the ballot box.
The ability to kill and to terrorise is what makes the IRA a potent force -
that, and not its ability to run up inspiring electoral totals for Sinn Fein
candidates on either side of the border. Whatever the power of the nationalist
tradition in Irish history it is not entirely at the disposal of Sinn Fein,
something which needs re-stating again and again.
Mr Clinton displays a degree of glamour on this side of the Atlantic, where
many Presidents this century have personally come to develop a special
relationship with British and Irish opinion - Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt,
Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan certainly did so. Mr Clinton may not
have exhibited it before, but something of its magic, the indefinable element
in popular politics, has been discerned this week. And it has been put to good
use. Its real worth may lie in the complicated bargaining which has to take
place in the next three months. It still could be shoved aside brutally - few
gunmen in any situation have much time for effete and imprecise words like
``magic'' any more than they have much time for majority popular opinion, which
has always been hostile to extreme violence in both communities in Northern
Ireland. The IRA might not have the self-confidence to opt for peace, but Mr
Clinton's visit has shown them - what they should anyhow always have known -
just how deep is the longing for it. It is widely shared, being the common
sentiment that united his enthusiastic crowds in London, Belfast, Londonderry,
and Dublin. The reception he received on this side of the Atlantic may, with
his other foreign successes, do Mr Clinton much good in his race for
re-election next year, but its importance here transcends that political
dimension. Though it is too soon to be sure, it is not too soon to hope that he
has delivered a powerful new impetus to the movement for peace.

THERE is a trick that stage magicians do where they dangle some glittering
trinkets in one hand. While your eyes follow their colours and movement the
other hand is stealthily removing your wallet without you knowing.
Scotland's local government leaders were today putting on that wide-eyed look
when they pat their jackets and realise the wallet has gone. The magician is,
of course, Secretary of State Michael Forsyth.
To be fair to Michael the Magician, the local government leaders were willing
victims. While he was working out what constitutional changes to make to
somehow steal the thunder of proposals for a Scottish parliament, on his desk
fortuitously dropped a letter from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
It proposed 52 ways that the Scottish Office could devolve power to the
councils which take over in April. A quick read of the list showed many things
that the Scottish Office could agree with - even the most power-hungry zealot
would not stand in the way of Cosla's wish that pelican crossings could be
erected without the requirement to issue notices and consult the Scottish
Office.
Nor was there much danger of a constitutional crisis if provisions in the Kirk
Dykes Act (1597) requiring councils to maintain churchyard walls were abolished.
The Scottish Office makes much of the fact that only nine of the 52 suggestions
by Cosla have been rejected by Michael Forsyth. The remainder will go out to
public consultation.
But if the 52 were playing cards, Michael the Magician has kept all the aces,
kings and a queen, and thrown all the plain cards back on the table.
Although minor changes concerning kirk walls, traffic regulations, and public
path creation orders may eventually be given to local councils to decide, the
tight grip on the purse strings still remains at the Scottish Office. Mr
Forsyth has rejected claims he should relax the capping powers he has over
councils. He also insists that councils should continue with compulsory
competitive tendering.
Councillor Keith Geddes, Cosla's senior vice-president, was said to have
welcomed the Secretary of State's announcement. He was quoted as saying it was
a step in the right direction.
But he was only being polite. Mr Geddes said yesterday that his complete view
was that yes, it was one step forward, but it was also three steps back, when
other announcements were taken into account.
Earlier in the week Mr Forsyth announced that councils had to spend a quarter
of their receipts from the sale of council houses into servicing council debt -
in other words pay it to the bankers and financial institutions.
Until now it has been used for construction and repair work. At a stroke the
country's construction industry, not in the best of health at present, was
dealt a difficult blow. And as Mr Geddes says: ``This was done without
consulting local authorities or the construction industry about the effects it
will have.
``It is all very well giving us more control in some selective areas, but in
effect it is more control but on a much smaller sum of money.
``The real issue in Scottish local government still remains resources. The
proposed changes would be much more welcome if they came with appropriate
resources.
``The more minor items he has gone along with will simply tidy up some aspects,
but he has held back on the issues which would have given real strategic powers
to the councils.''
One change proposed by Mr Forsyth is that the new councils will be allowed to
make their own bye-laws. The limits though are not spelled out, other than the
relatively non-contentious suggestion of allowing councils to limit the
drinking of alcohol in public places.
Planning applications for fewer than 10 houses would be decided locally without
recourse to the Secretary of State.
Councils may also be allowed to take their own decisions on school closures -
but given the heated arguments they can create, the Scottish Secretary would
probably be quite glad to wash his hands of that one. He can of course allow
any school to opt out, so in a roundabout way he would have a form of final say.
He may also allow councils to take over houses at present owned by Scottish
Homes.
The building of trunk roads may come within the councils' remit. But if there
is not sufficient money coming with the responsibility, then the councils may
be cautious of this expansion.
On allocating resources, there appears to be a significant change in that there
would be only one capital expenditure covering education, social work, roads,
transport, and general services, rather than separate totals. It will allow the
council to decide spending priorities among the different areas.
It sounds like more freedom for the councils. But two key areas are excluded.
Housing will still be a separate total agreed with the Scottish Office. Nor, it
seems, will spending on police and fire services be included.
As John Mullin, chair of finance at Strathclyde region, puts it: ``It's little
more than window-dressing. The financial straitjacket has not been loosened. It
is not so important how you slice the cake up, as the size of the cake in the
first place.''
BUT perhaps they are simply opposition politicians who are unwilling to give Mr
Forsyth his proper credit? So I sought the views of Steven Hamilton, once the
chief executive of Glasgow District Council, but now retired and thus
answerable to no political master.
He also saw the removal of capital receipts from councils as the removal of
freedom to act. And he pointed out that even if councils had freedom within
their capital allocations, they still had to prove to the Scottish Office that
their capital schemes could not have been financed by the Government's Private
Finance Initiative. In other words, the Scottish Office will still be crawling
over the spending plans.
``I don't see where the greater freedom Mr Forsyth is talking about is coming
from. Many of the proposals are very trivial. I find it very difficult to
believe that local authority powers are going to change significantly.''
Mr Forsyth says this will be the first wave in a tide of reform which will
sweep across the shoreline of government and change its shape for ever.
The local councils, though, believe it will hardly get their toes wet.
Although minor changes may eventually be given to local councils to decide, Ken
Smith explains why the tight grip on the purse strings still remains at the
Scottish Office

THE former matron of Cameron Hospital in Fife and wife of the former principal
of the Free Church of Scotland College, Murdina MacAuley Cameron, nee Smith,
has died in hospital in Edinburgh. She was 78.
Born in the Hebrides, Murdina moved to Glasgow when she was young and was
brought up in the city. After a long career in nursing she became matron of
Cameron Hospital at Windygates, near Leven, caring for long-term patients.
In 1969 she married W J Cameron, who later became principal of the Free Church
of Scotland College, retiring in 1977. He died in 1990.
A bright and vivacious woman and a prominent member of the Buccleuch and
Greyfriars parish in Edinburgh, Mrs Cameron approached her role as principal's
wife with great enthusiasm. Having retired from nursing shortly after her
marriage, she devoted the rest of her life to church work. She had no immediate
family.

ROBERT McLachlan, who died last week aged 90, was for many years a significant
and colourful figure in the Glasgow Meat Market.
Born in Pollokshields, his father was a master butcher and Robert joined him in
that business. During the war, he became Meat Controller for South-West
Scotland, and developed a great love for Dumfriesshire and Galloway which
remained throughout the rest of his life.
When he returned to the meat market in Glasgow, he built up a flourishing
business and was widely respected as an astute businessman but also as a man of
integrity and honesty. He was still to be seen on the floor of the market in
his eighties.
He was a committed and practising Christian and a member of St George's Tron
Church in Buchanan Street.
He had wide interests and many friends. One of these, the late Ian MacNicol,
was the catalyst in his enthusiastic interest in art, particularly in the works
of Hornel and Munnings. He loved travelling, particularly in the West Highlands
of Scotland.
In 1935 he married Janet Rankin who died 15 years ago. They had no children.

REVENGE is a dish best eaten cold, and after 123 years, the bone of contention
between those old Border rivals, Gala and Melrose, is just right for the
picking.
The issue is the small matter of the Gala goalposts and strips which
disappeared under cover of darkness and ended up five miles away at the
Greenyards, as the Melrose men staged a nocturnal breakaway from their
erstwhile comrades in arms.
That was in 1877 and, in truth, the clubs have long since kissed and made up,
with the purloined goods replaced in kind.
However, against a backdrop of such splendid internecine strife, there is no
way on God's earth that Gala will roll over today and allow their Border
colleagues a clear run at the final championship hurdle.
The SRU Tennents Premiership has maintained its flavour right down to the very
last crunch. Melrose, Stirling County, Boroughmuir, and Watsonians are still in
the hunt. Melrose are in the driving seat and a win for them at the Greenyards
means that Stirling must beat Boroughmuir today and Heriot's FP on December 16.
Then it would come down to points' differential and Stirling must wipe out the
41-point deficit which separates the two sides.
Boroughmuir, who for long enough had the championship and their destiny within
their grasp, now must win against Stirling today and look for Gala to defeat
Melrose. The odds on a Watsonians' triumph are even longer, and if they are to
be champions then they must beat Hawick today and profit from losses by Melrose
and Boroughmuir and by Stirling in the re-arranged game with Heriot's.
If Melrose are successful against Gala today and Stirling lose, then the new
championship trophy will be handed over to captain Bryan Redpath by SRU
president Iain Todd at the close of play. If Boroughmuir beat Stirling and
Melrose lose to Gala, then Todd will hightail it to Meggetland, where he will
present the trophy to Boroughmuir in a 6.30 ceremony once the team have
returned from Bridgehaugh.
But all of that is in the future. Yesterday, Gala coach Peter Dods was
confirming that defeat at the Greenyards is the last thing on their minds.
``We'll not be making it easy for Melrose,'' he said. ``For once we want to
make it easy four ourselves. Last week when we beat Hawick I told the boys that
our season starts now. That win represented our first victory after relegation
and, at last we had started to put things right.
``We're totally relaxed about Melrose. The pressure is all on them and they
certainly won't think that it's a foregone conclusion. The season began badly
for us. We just seemed to crack under pressure. Even yet we haven't really put
our thumb on what went wrong. But there is no pressure on us tomorrow.
``I don't think that Melrose will be playing a fast, furious game. They will
want to keep it tight and it's a game plan they work well. We'll be out to
disrupt that plan. I'm stressing to the boys that we have nothing whatsoever to
fear. We go into the game with that win over Hawick in the bag. I have said all
season that somebody is going to be on the receiving end from us. Hopefully it
will be Melrose tomorrow.
``We're looking at next season now. The premiership is all but over and already
clubs are starting to recruit for next year. We're looking at what we can do
for our players because we have to make sure that we keep as many of the squad
as we can for next season. We have to get the commitment to Gala from the
players now. It's no good waiting until March or April,'' he said.
In the Melrose camp, Doddie Weir, who may well be playing his last league game
for the club he has been with for 10 of his 25 years before enlisting with
Newcastle, harbours no illusions as to how tough it will be today.
``Gala have had a nightmare of a season and there is nothing would please them
more than to beat us tomorrow. I know that because my brother, Tom, has been
telling me so all week.''
Tom Weir, two years Doddie's junior, is at lock today for Gala in direct
opposition to his brother. ``I've been trying to bribe him all week for their
lineout codes but there's nothing doing. He says they played really well
against Hawick last week and that they're all up for it tomorrow.
``It's a great way to end the season, though, a Border derby at the Greenyards.
What more could you ask for. Except a win for Melrose.''

READERS of The Pickwick Papers learn that, in Charles Dickens's time, oysters
used to be a poor man's food. The excellent Sam Weller thought indeed that
poverty and oysters went together.
Yet today they are a rich man's food, perhaps becoming a little less so than
truffles or caviar, but still scarcely popular. Even a gastronome in waiting
like myself never tasted oysters till I was 20, and while I now down a few
dozen a year, they are far from a staple of my diet. Yet my consumption must be
well above the average. How do we account for the difference between the age of
Dickens and our own?
The paradox poses itself because we need only go over to France to find oysters
very commonly eaten. In the streets of Paris, there are countless stalls
selling them. You can swallow half a dozen on the spot, or carry them away in a
poke. Yet the French fish the Atlantic waters like ourselves. Why should they
have so many oysters.
Both Britain and France are maritime nations, and have always consumed the
fruits of the sea. Britain is insular, her people free to roam the oceans of
the world, gathering in its produce and sending back her own. She therefore has
a natural bias towards free trade. On the other hand France, attached to the
end of the Eurasian land mass, is open to invasion and has throughout her
history needed a strong state to defend herself. A strong state naturally tends
to intervene in the economy.
By the middle of the nineteenth century, when Neild's story starts, both were
also big nations, with burgeoning urban populations to be fed. Oysters proved
in many ways ideal. Though superabundant, they could not swim away. Once
fishermen found an oyster-bed, all they had to do was scoop the creatures up:
much easier than hunting down and chasing shoals of herring, for example.
What happened then was that British fishermen scooped and scooped till the
oyster-beds were gone. The doctrines of free trade, a religion in themselves
during the Victorian era, made the government wary of intervening. It conducted
inquiries, but ignored the evidence that oysters were being fished to
extinction.
France, however, took the opposite course. There the government was reluctant
to see a cheap source of sustenance vanish. As it became obvious that the old
methods of harvesting natural oysters could not continue, cultivation was
encouraged under strict legal safeguards. Up to this day, coastal communities
make a living from that, and there are oysters in plenty for everybody else.
Each country followed its own instincts but which, Neild prompts the reader to
ask, has come off better?
Interwoven with this narrative are many titbits of oyster lore.  There are
recommendations on how to cook them, though no recipes as such. But you will
not find a clearer explanation of what to do if you want to choose oysters,
take them home, open and eat them for yourself.
Also in my batch this time is the latest edition of Mrs Beeton, thoroughly
modernised since the great lady's time and now put into paperback. ``First
catch a hare'' is out, but there are numerous tips of the kind other cookbooks
omit, such as how to clean a squid, bone a chicken, brand a souffle  or carve a
saddle of venison, all admirably illustrated. Up-to-date methods, including
even the dreaded microwave, are well covered. The text is about evenly divided
between the techniques of every kind and the recipes, the latter oddly
presented in rigid alphabetical order, so that after onion soup comes orange
marmalade, then osso buco, then oxtail and so on. This volume is excellent
value.
There is a similar but more self-conscious old-fashioned look about The Cook's
Scrapbook. Every dish is pictured, and in between there are culinary
reminiscences of days of yore or grainy black-and-white photos of Granny Black
leading her hob and the like. Still, the recipes are good, with all the
standard favourites and an excellent range of specialities from different parts
of Britain, including Scotland. This is obviously aimed at the Christmas market.
Finally, there is another attempt to cash in on the audience for Masterchef,
with a selection of the best recipes from the five years the series has been
running. It is perfectly all right if you like that sort of thing, but I remain
suspicious of virtuosity in the domestic kitchen for its own sake.

WHILE the draft dodger was in Belfast pouring his sickly syrup over the
medicine hastily concocted for Ulster to ingest, my two American guests
arrived. They, like their President, had come with elections in mind. ``Gee,
this must be so exciting for you Scotch (sic),'' they trumpeted to the man
standing at the bar of the Glasgow pub in which we arranged to meet. He looked
bemused, then, cautiously and silently, began rearranging his hauf-and-a-hauf
on the counter creating a curious pattern with the beer pump, no doubt a secret
symbol to ward off evil spirits or irrepressible Yankies. It didn't work.
``Are you going to a party?'' they asked; somewhat improbably I thought since
his dark uniform below his anorak suggested the only knees-up he experienced
that day was when climbing into the driving seat of his bus. He visibly
brightened, nevertheless, as his interrogators were both attractive young women
in their early twenties, although had overindulged on mom's apple pie.
``No, are you?'' came the reply. I detected an element of hope in his voice.
``It's St Andrew's Day tomorrow,'' they crowed in unison. ``Is it?'' his
expectations sank with his whisky. What I like about Americans is their
inexhaustible optimism. I suppose you must have it to contrive a jigsaw of a
peace plan like that for Bosnia. These ladies, fresh from an east coast
university, were in Scotland to see our own pieces put together, namely, a
Parliament of all the Labour Talents. That it was happening on St Andrew's Day
was ``wonderful'', ``amazing'', ``historic''. I wondered if Canon Kenyon Wright
had written their scripts.
They were anxious to get to Edinburgh, though 24 hours were to elapse before
``festivities'' began. Would there be a parade? Were all the houses decked out
in bunting? Would there be thousands of people out on the streets? Wasn't it
exciting?
Enthusiasm is such a rare quality one is reluctant to dampen it. ``We should
watch it on television,'' I said helpfully. Their faces contorted. ``No, we
want to be out on the streets,'' they pleaded eagerly. This was serious
business. They were writing it up for a magazine so the folks back home could
share our day. They had tape recorders, decorated with all manner of devices,
including a clock which, impressively, told you the time to the exact minute in
places such as Seoul and Peking. For backup there were pads with a rainbow
assortment of coloured pens. Also their cameras had an array of attachments
which would have done credit to Richard Avedon.
They had also been doing their homework. Seventy five to 80% of Scots wanted
constitutional change. The status quo was not an option. Tories faced wipeout.
The Daily Record in audio.
First stop the following day was Calton Hill and the proposed Assembly
building. The Rocky Horror Show in all its grim reality. A balding man from
Stirling was spotted surreptitiously handing out leaflets to press men. We
three created a ``crowd'' on the pavement and, feeling exposed, looked around
for members of the public. Eight or nine were huddled together. We joined them
but they disappeared soon after when their bus arrived.
On to the Mercat Cross in the High Street for real theatre. A proclamation was
read, a pipe band blew, Saltires fluttered, and 100 of the self-appointed,
chests extended, marched to the Assembly hall. Pageantry, drama, but still no
crowds.
None the less, I savoured the pathos. These Modern Anthenians, like their
ancient counterparts who crept out of their city on the way to the ill-fated
Peloponnesian Wars, had set their course to do or die. The Americans, I
discovered, were not big on historical analogies, more on ticker tape. ``Where
is everybody?'' they asked. Which for Labour must surely rank with other
imponderables such as the West Lothian question.
To the rest of us it is transparently obvious. There is no widespread popular
demand. Of course if you ask Scots whether they want their own parliament, the
majority response will be in the affirmative. It is a romantic notion, like
wanting Partick Thistle to win the cup. But few would volunteer to stand on the
terracings to watch them any more than most of us would willingly pay the
Tartan Tax.
Those outwith the chattering classes remotely interested in a parliament have
been suckered into believing that such an institution will have a dramatic
effect on everything from the economy to pensions. When they discover it is no
better than a glorified county council the discontent will manifest itself. It
will, further, spiral out of control if the current generous block grant
formula is revised on the back of objections that the Scots are being treated
favourably. And we are. This is why it makes sense to retain the Union. No-one,
least of all Europe, will give us such a great deal. It is utter folly to throw
it away.
Yet many in Scotland would have us do so, peddling half-truths in TV programmes
like Scotching the Myth. The basis of this argument, which has recently
resurfaced after most of us thought it had been buried five years ago, is that
more public money is spent on a Londoner than on a Scot. What is so surprising
about that? More money is spent per head in Scotland than on a Geordie, a
Welshman, or a Liverpudlian. If you look within Scotland more is spent per
capita in Edinburgh and Glasgow than Pumpherston and Uphall.
If these comparisons mean we can accuse London of having its snout in the
trough, would it not be justifiable for Geordies to accuse we Scots of the
same? Do I see hands raised offering to cut back on public spending to put
Scotland on a par with Newcastle?
Of course it costs more to build in some parts of London than most of Scotland.
It is reflected in prices. Clever, eh?
Propaganda like Scotching the Myth and Labour's hyped claims of what an
Assembly can achieve play into the hands of the separatists. If anyone should
have been dancing in the streets this week it is the Nationalists. At least it
would have made the day for my Americans.

THERE are two kinds of magic and this Pinocchio has them both. There's the kind
of technical whiz-wizardry which makes our little wooden chum's nose grow when
he tells whoppers. And I promise you, it really does get longer and longer
before your very eyes. And even the spoilsport clever-clogs who sit looking for
the tricks and telling everyone else how it's done won't know. Actually it's
done by . . . mmmmm.
Sorry, but the Lady in Blue has sealed my lips. She's the mysterious stranger
who helps everyone see how to make the other kind of magic works. This is the
magic of ordinary things, the magic that we all take for granted. It's to do
with trying your hardest even when things seems impossible, and caring about
others, and having family and friends who care about you. ``You're never alone
if someone is missing you,'' says this marvellously upright, bustled, and
brollied individual in a rig-out that's more be-toqued Queen Mary than token
Mary Poppins.
Does this sound as if writer Myles Rudge hasn't got beyond the ``pi'' in
Pinocchio? Fret not. This is true, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed adventuring - Mr
Fox and Miss Kitty providing a gallus dawd of raffish low life - mixed with
fits of daftness, some sing-alongs, lots of audience participation and just the
right slosh of sentiment.
Really the plot is just a midsummer night's dream where everyone - from
Geppetto the toymaker (Sandy Welch) to Carlo, his flesh and blood son
(Christopher Delaney) - learns the dangers of selfishness. Kathryn Howden's
Frenchified show-off is a cracking oo-la-la-laugh while David McKay's Cricket
so appealed to my own conscience that I simply can't spoil things by telling
you how that nose grows . . .

THE MYTH OF THE JACOBITE CLANS: Murray Pittock, Edinburgh University Press,

Scotland/HMSO, #12.95

FROM REBEL TO HERO: The Image of the Highlander1745-1830: Robert Clyde,
Tuckwell Press, #20
THE flood of Jacobite books marking the 250th anniversary of the '45 swells.
The waters are in some places admirably clear, in others thoroughly muddied.
Murray Pittock has written a bold but in the end, I am obliged to say, a bad
book. I am obliged to say so despite the fact that, as a general principle, I
applaud his quest for a Scottish historiography cleansed of kitsch. In fact,
all historians of the present generation in Scotland are engaged on the same
quest.
This does not mean we must accept the substance of Pittock's argument, that the
Jacobites, so far from being marginal, were and are central to Scottish history
and identity since the Union. His argument proceeds from the notion that they
formed a nationalism in the era after 1707 which, though later suppressed and
distorted, has survived to emerge, perchance to triumph, in our own time.
In a previous book, Pittock's argument rested on the explication of Jacobite or
quasi-Jacobite texts, in the present work, he at least looks to a real world
beyond texts. He even wrestles with statistics. No doubt to his own
satisfaction he wins the bout, but I have to disqualify him on grounds of
cheating.
The central point which Pittock seeks to establish is that Highlanders did not,
as myth tells us, make up the bulk of the armed strength which Prince Charles
Edward Stuart was able to call forth from Scotland. On the contrary, they
contributed only half of it, if that. It follows that the rest must have been
Lowlanders. The prince therefore united Highland and Lowlands: he led a
national, indeed nationalist, uprising. This was not the dying jerk of a doomed
Gaelic civilisation, but Scotland striking for freedom. The main evidence
adduced is that, when Charles marched off in November 1745 with 6000 clansmen
into England, he left behind a ``northern army'', composed of Lowlanders, to
hold the territory of Scotland. It did not do very well, for English troops at
once re-occupied Edinburgh.
Maybe it was a matter of the northern army's organisation. Pittock stresses
that the prince's invading force was not a tribal rabble, but a modern military
corps with a proper command structure.
But who were the generals, brigadiers and colonels of the northern army?
Pittock does not tell us. What, come to that, were its units? At the Battle of
Falkirk in January 1746 the only Scottish additions to the Jacobite host,
meanwhile back from England were three regiments of Farquharsons, Mackenzies
and Frasers - Highlanders, not Lowlanders.
Indeed at the Battle of Culloden in April the only further additions were one
regiment of mixed clans and two of Gordons (though some of the latter, raised
on Speyside, might just about count as Lowlanders). But why did the rest of the
northern army not show up at this supreme crisis of Jacobitism? No doubt, with
the holding of all that territory, it had better things to do.
One might begin to suspect that the northern army was a phantom, a figment of
Pittock's imagination. The suspicion will be confirmed on examination of how he
came to believe that it existed at all. The authority on which he most relies
is a doctoral thesis of 1963 by a Miss McCann, who put the number of fighting
Jacobites at 12,470 to 14,140. Subtract the 5000 who marched into England and,
hey presto, the northern army appears.
I have not had the pleasure of reading Miss McCann's thesis, so I cannot tell
how she arrived at her figures. What I wonder is why, for a piece of evidence
crucial to his case, Pittock again does not tell us. He diligently computes
recruitment in various bits of the Lowlands, but omits to add them up. A glance
will show that they come nowhere near covering the gap between 5000 and 14,000.
Hanoverian spies reckoned the Jacobites raised no more than 3450 extra men
while the prince was dashing to Derby, but many of these must have had second
thoughts when before long they faced the prospect of encounter with the
bayonets of the British army. In any event, why should the spies have lied?
It is easy to lie with statistics, or at least to accept consistently the
estimates most favourable to a preconceived purpose. This is not good
historical method, though. It may be quite all right for a literary critic, as
Pittock is, to draw out of texts an individual interpretation which opens up
original insights to himself and others: I dare say that is his job.
A historian, on the other hand, is stuck with facts, which often refuse to
gell. But he is never entitled to ignore or wish away those that will not fit
the framework he would like to find. And in this instance, Pittock has failed
to disprove the myth of the Jacobite clans. The rest of his argument falls.
Not all Jacobite books in this anniversary year are bad. The one by Michael
Hook and Walter Ross, which presumably counts as the official publication on
the '45, is exceptionally good: rapid narrative, skilful deployment of detail,
sound judgment right through and excellent illustrations. John Gibson, whose
monographs have so expanded our understanding of Jacobitism, gives sterling
service again with a vivid book on Edinburgh's uneasy experience of the Stuart
homecoming. Robert Clyde mainly surveys printed literature on the Highlands
after it was all over, but the theme of rebel-to-hero is well sustained.

SWIMMING
TWO world records went tumbling at the world short-course swimming
championships in Rio de Janeiro yesterday while China's Le Jingyi won her
second gold medal.
Claudia Poll, of Costa Rica, and Australian Samantha Riley broke world records
as they won gold medals in the women's 200 metres free-style and 200m
breast-stroke respectively.
China's Le, a double gold medallist at last year's world championships in Rome,
added the women's 50m free-style title to the 100m free-style gold she won on
Thursday. Le won in 24.62sec.
Poll won her final in a time of 1min 55.42sec, bettering the mark of 1-55.84
set by Germany's Franziska van Almsick in Beijing nearly three years ago.
Brisbane's Riley demolished the opposition in her final, finishing in 2min
20.85sec to knock more than one second off the record.
Van Almsick, in addition to losing her 200m record, pulled out of the
confrontation with Le when she failed to start in the morning's qualifiers, her
coach Achim Jedamsky saying she had a bout of flu.
Australia won two more golds, taking their total to six, when defending
champion Daniel Kowalski won the men's 400m free-style, and the men's relay
team won the 4 x 200m free-style. Kowalski swam the last leg to take his second
gold of the day.
Britain's Sarah Hardcastle won her first world title when she won the women's
800m free-style in 8-26.46.

ALNWICK Castle is used to rebellious Scots - the fortress owes the existence to
their unwelcome attentions.
Scots again are girding themselves for battle beneath its ramparts - not
because they will be competing for Britain today in the European Cross-country
Championships, but because they are not.
The failure to include any Scot has provoked anger among those who believe the
performances of Kilbarchan's Robert Quinn and Cambuslang's Steven Wylie,
respectively third and fourth in the final trial, warranted more than reserve
status.
British Athletic Federation secretary Matt Fraser, also secretary of the UK
cross-country commission, said: ``There was no trial as such, because this is
so early in the season. We just stipulated four races to be taken into
consideration. But we acknowledge the discontent, and we'll review it for next
year.''
Fraser warns Glasgow, who want the 1997 championships but have yet to lodge a
formal application, that they have a rival. ``Portugal have already made a
bid,'' said Fraser.
Quinn, first reserve today and is optimistic of a place: ``usually one person
gets injured or has flu,'' is himself that victim. Wylie is on standby, hoping
to be given the chance to flourish. However, with a clean bill of health
reported last night, that prospect seems remote.
Andrew Pearson is the Briton most likely to challenge Portugal's defending
champion, Paulo Guerra. ``I will be disappointed if I don't take a medal, and
also if the British team does not get one,'' he said.
Pearson spent last summer in Kenya, but it was a disaster: ``I proved allergic
to malaria tablets, and was ill for months.''
With women's world 10,000 metres champion Fernando Ribiero, and defending
champion Catherina McKiernan sidelined, the world junior champion, Anne-Marie
Sandell, of Finland, could make a speedy impact on the senior ranks.
Wylie's absence on international duty will weaken Cambuslang's team for the TSB
West cross-country championships today at Stepps, where the Lanarkshire club
will be under strong pressure from Shettleston.
Dave Cavers (Teviotdale) chases retention of the East title at Edinburgh's Jack
Kane Centre, but Glen Stewart should lead Leslie Deans Racing Club to the team
title.

JOAN McFADDEN visits a show for parents-to-be and young families
THE Baby and Toddler Show at the SECC, in Glasgow, is designed especially for
parents-to-be and young families, and aims to provide an enjoyable day out
coupled with the chance to buy anything and everything you might need for your
children.
Anyone who is pregnant and revelling in it will find themselves thoroughly at
home, while those who are already baby bores can indulge themselves and their
offspring.
Begin with the stand representing the Queen Mother's Hospital, where the staff
midwife has the knack of making every pregnant woman feel cherished and
special; move on to the fashion show where the models look hugely pregnant yet
very elegant; and test drive the huge range of baby equipment on display.
Throughout the day there is non-stop entertainment for children, which includes
favourites such as Fireman Sam and Rupert the Bear. Santa is welcoming guests
into his grotto - a bit early but welcome - and there are free balloons and
goodies galore for all the tinies. There is also excellent provision for all
the practical needs of the under-fives, including a play area, feeding and
breast feeding areas, nappy changing areas, and a restaurant.
Life assurance, pain relief in labour, and safety in the home are just some of
the services on offer, and although there are certainly some predictable toys
such as the ubiquitous Mr Blobby there is also a wide variety of rather more
unusual goods. One stand features hard- wearing and very attractive reversible
clothing, while another sells beautiful wooden toys, which include a unique
nativity scene.
The drawback to all the more individual clothes and toys is the price, as the
sellers are clearly aiming at higher income families. Some of the parents I
spoke to felt the entrance fee of #6 per adult was extortionate, and that the
bulk of the goods available were out of the question for anyone on a tight
budget. Since financial constraints usually go hand in hand with children, some
exhibitors appear to be simply pricing themselves out of the market.
Some of the most popular stands are those featuring specialist magazines, such
as First Steps, which are tailored for pregnancy through to toddlers. These
magazines provide a wealth of information on subjects such as baby equipment,
ante-natal care, and children's fashion, and they are well worth looking at
before you start forking out hundreds of pounds on the latest trend.
It is very pleasant to be able to take small children into a show which happily
caters for them and doesn't leave you feeling that pushing a buggy
automatically alienates you from the rest of the human race.
If you're looking for a special present, one to try before you buy, or just
like the feeling that everytime a tantrum threatens you can divert your toddler
with a passing clown or reindeer then this is for you. The big plus for me is
no-one attempted any hard sell, but the big minus has to be all the people
ignoring the No Smoking signs. With so many small children around there are too
many tiny faces at just the wrong height.
n The Baby and Toddler Show at the SECC, Glasgow, today 10am-6pm and tomorrow
10am-5pm.

Nairobi
BRITISH detectives are in Nairobi to investigate the shooting of British
diplomat Graeme Gibson, 43, who is paralysed after being shot in the neck on
November 24 by a three-man gang driving a stolen car.
Two detectives from Scotland Yard flew to Nairobi at the Kenyan Government's
request this week.
Police believed the attackers were thieves after Mr Gibson's car, but Kenyan
Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka now says it could be an attempt to undermine
the government and give the impression of insecurity.
Mr Gibson and his wife Pam left for Britain today, leaving a note to say they
were sad to leave. ``We will be flying to Britain where Graeme will be
continuing treatment for the terrible injuries he suffered,'' they said.
Attacks on expatriates in Kenya have risen in the last few years and political
analysts said the government's decision to bring in Scotland Yard was meant to
show it was seriously concerned.
Next week, prosecution and defence lawyers will present final submissions in
the trial of three men charged with the rape and murder last year of British
housewife Caron Winter.
Kenya called in Scotland Yard to investigate the 1988 murder in a game reserve
of British tourist Julie Ward. That murder was never solved and a Kenyan judge
accused local police of attempting a cover-up.
In February 1990, President Daniel arap Moi brought in Scotland Yard again to
investigate the murder of populist Foreign Minister Robert Ouko, after his
charred remains were found in a bush near his rural home in Western Kenya.
The detectives were sent home before completing the work.
In another sign that the Kenyan Government was taking attacks on visitors
seriously, it announced the formation of a Tourism Protection Unit (TPU)
designed to end attacks on tourists and win back confidence in the country's
top foreign exchange earning industry.

IN A FIT of misplaced vanity the day after my book, Making It Work*, on the
challenges facing women in the nineties, was published (but after all, no-one
knew me there), I went into Dillon's bookshop near London University to see if
they'd got it and whether they'd displayed it decently. I couldn't see it but
checked with an assistant. ``About women? That'll be under gender studies which
is under sociology on the third floor.'' It was a long climb - up the main
staircase, then up another much narrower one to the most obscure and distant
corner of the shop. It wasn't there either, and since it's written in plain
English wouldn't really have fitted.
Coming downstairs I paused by a table at the main door. NEW THIS WEEK! Peter
Ackroyd on Blake, Robert Harris's Enigma, a novel about clever but crusty (in
the old sense) bachelors, Anthony Quinn on himself, Michael Barrymore on
himself and booze, another chap on Andre Malraux. Men on men, but no-one calls
it ``men's studies''.
This is not just a story of how pride comes before a crestfallen exit, but I
think illustrates a dilemma facing feminism today. It is no longer the case
that women's voices go unheard, or women are not present as writers and
broadcasters and filmmakers, in law, in unions, in decision-making (though
there are many areas still wholly male). What's much harder is getting women's
views to count as mainstream. The very emphasis we have fought for to stop
women's specific interests (as practitioners and audience, representatives and
voters) being obscured and overlooked, has turned back on us to create a kind
of trap, another excuse for marginalisation.
The book is about the things that shape women's lives and options in the 1990s:
work, kids, grannies, the CSA, politics, sex, self-esteem . . . obscure things
like that. Writing about changing families and demographic change - the ageing
population, why fewer women are having children; about an ill-divided ``60-40
society'', long hours and competitive pressures at work, and insecurity; about
legal reform of divorce and child maintenance - these seem to me questions of
current affairs as well as central to contemporary feminism. Of interest to
men, even.
Flag up ``women'', though, and you can be tucked away under a category of
special interest and at the back of the shop. As one woman councillor put it:
women's issues are people's issues, only most people in decision-making roles
ignore them. Women politicans have for years faced this dilemma, but it comes
in several guises: the distinction between ``soft'' and ``hard'' news, for
example, though family policy matters as much to most of us as economics, and
indeed the two cannot be understood separately.
Pursue ``women's issues'' and you risk being marginalised; determinedly eschew
them in the hope of being taken more seriously and you reinforce an ascription
of value which underpins sex discrimination. Mrs Thatcher is the pre-eminent
example of the latter strategy, famously described as the best man in Cabinet.
Yet she was both praised and reviled in ways permeated with sexual imagery,
from Alan Clark's flirtatious talk of slim ankles to the slogan ``Ditch the
Bitch''. I never thought of myself as a woman politican, she said. But can you
avoid it?
Fiona Mackay at Edinburgh University, in a study of women politicians in local
authorities, found most were deeply ambivalent about ``women's issues'' - seen
as a way of sidelining concerns which should be in the mainstream, but
recognising the risk of those issues being lost there. Most agreed in practice
a list of interests which should be shared, but aren't usually: childcare and
other caring responsibilities, women's health, violence, equal opportunities,
part-time working, low pay, and the low level of women in decision-making.
The processes of agreeing the Platform for Action at Beijing and, although
closer to home, drawing up a parallel Agenda for Action (which the Women's
National Commission and Equal Opportunities Commission did earlier this year)
can feel remote from our everyday and local concerns, but when you look at the
details, reflect them. Again they raise political, social, and economic issues
which concern everyone.
It is a long and scarcely visible battle for political legitimacy, not just for
women but a ``women's agenda''; not just a place on the
board/committee/executive, but a role in reshaping its priorities.
Engaging with and challenging national and international politics - for example
taking forward the resolutions of the UN Women's Conference at Beijing - is one
of two clear priorities in women's politics in the 1990s. (The other is sexual
and domestic volence.)
But ``mainstreaming'' is also a demand for a different focus: that gender is
taken account of across all policy-making. For example, understanding that care
is an economic, not just a family, issue; and that the impact on most women of
most policies is different than it is for men. For example housing (women are
more likely to live in social housing), transport (women are much less likely
to have a car); the consequences of austerity programmes in the Third World
(women fill the gaps when health and social programmes are cut back), and types
of aid. But it means making very careful arguments when integration - not so
very different a concept on the face of it - has become code for quietly
dropping these awkward besoms off the bottom of the agenda. A current example
of this is the sidelining of the world of women's units and committees in some
new local authorities.
If integration risks invisibility, intervention to increase women's role means
political trouble - and leaves many women wondering whether the battle is worth
it. The front-running example is women-only short lists in the Labour Party:
the policy has generated a great deal of heat (and a false but general public
impression that no Labour men can stand anywhere) but, in Scotland anyway, a
very mixed outcome: of the six seats where the policy applied, the three least
winnable have gone to women. The policy is called diversionary and
undemocratic, even anti-equality, in the case of the London would-be candidate
who is suing under the sex discrimination legislation. Yet male-only short
lists go unremarked, as does the Tory party's failure, so far, to pick a woman
candidate to fight any safe seat in the UK.
When I interviewed feminist writer and researcher Cynthia Cockburn she argued
that managing both to keep a specific focus on women and on discrimination and
to insist that women and women's issues had a central place in the mainstream
would be difficult. ``We've made a huge climb and we've reached a plateau and
it seems now almost inconceivable that we can make the next step. The demands
have become less legitimate because we already have some representation.''
When I talked to her she was doing research on the presence of women and
women's interests in the social dialogue (between government, trade unions, and
employers) in the European Union. ``It's not a negative story. There are women
present and women's interests are acknowledged and there are women's committees
which are considered legitimate. At the same time there's a huge step still
needed to get real parity, or to have a women's vision of the future of Europe
in any way central to what happens.''
Because more women are in decision-making roles, and often forcefully so, it
obscures how small their number is: 9% at Westminster - an increase of 2% on
the 1987 election, and at a time when there was a lot of lobbying on the issue.
Similarly the elections to the shadow unitary authorities returned 22.4% women,
a stunning increase of 0.5%. If the argument for a gradualist, evolutionary
approach was plausible in 1928, it isn't any longer. Yet action to ensure women
have an equal part is seen as reverse discrimination - a quasi-liberal argument
which only makes sense if you assume the same starting point. We need to
recognise that most of our institutions still run positive action programmes
for men.
Structures and intervention to address women's lack of involvement are still
needed, not so much to provide a springboard as information, research back-up,
and political analysis, to make possible the evaluation of all policies in
terms of how they support, or erode, equality. And to enable women to argue
more successfully that women's interests are people's interests. And that we
all need a different political settlement.
The second, allied, dilemma is summed up in feminist shorthand as
``difference''. Women's politics have been dogged by oversimplistic assumptions
of women's commonalities. No - read on - this really doesn't contradict what
I've been arguing about a women's agenda, though it is a tightrope to be walked
with care.
If sisterhood was powerful once, it has not been enough for a long time. Tenets
of shared oppression and solidarity defined women without their consent;
women's liberation asserted a stereotype of women almost as narrow as those it
overthrew. The astonishing amount of comment generated by the spat between
Suzanne Moore and Germaine Greer earlier in the year and the recent more
serious public disagreement between Angela Neustatter, Maureen Freely, and
Naomi Wolf about Wolf's views on abortion are telling - and not only that the
women's movement is sexy when it's angry. Both glee (in the media) and dismay
(some feminists) at such discord reveals a lot about ideas of feminist
solidarity.
This has long been a paralysis and unrealistic expectation. Yes
From an acknowledgement of diverse inequalities and conflicting priorities has
followed the difficulty on developing a single feminist politics - but the
world still expects us to. The idea that the women's movement could be more
formal than a loose network of groups and campaigns is, I think, unrealistic.
Although it would be easier to relate to existing political structures if it
were, and mean interventions could be more powerful. (Better communication
between groups would help a lot.) But gender does not provide that sort of
organising principle.
A DIFFERENCE which has come more into the frame in recent years is between the
Scottish women's movement and the rest of the UK. Interviewing women in England
I asked them whether they saw themselves as part of the women's movement and an
awful lot said ``what women's movement?'' No-one says that in Scotland: you may
have reservations about its role and effectiveness but not its reality.
Defining it is harder. Without even trying to go beyond recent contacts and
events I can think of the women drummers Sheboom (now the largest drumming
group in Europe, I'm told), women weaving webs in endangered trees, the new
lesbian health clinic in Glasgow, the latest stage of Zero Tolerance, Meridian
(the centre for black and ethnic minority women), Engender's Gender Audit, the
STUC's women's conference, the Lanarkshire 16-day campaign against violence.
The image of feminism is problematic: still dungarees and shoulder pads (though
rarely worn together); its practice, though, is widespread and diverse.
``Front-line'' organisations like Women's Aid and Rape Crisis add another
dimension, as do specific professional and interest groups, like women in
social work or women planners, and student groups and academic courses. At a
recent conference for the Clackmannan Women and Girls Project the topics
engaged with (on my count anyway) included homelessness, political
participation, women and technology, unplanned pregnancy, relationship
problems, the social dimensions of health, employment rights, and the Beijing
conference. Organising and creating consensus across such a range of interests
is difficult: which is a lesser priority, not relevant, not political? Perhaps
the only thing all the Scottish women's groups have in common is lack of money.
Knowing about the range of organisations rather than a narrower focus is an
advantage of a small country. Something else that seems to me different is
consciousness of poverty as the most fundamental inequality, and one which can
co-exist with equality of opportunity for some women. The widening gap in
income and life chances between different women is one of the negative changes
of the past 25 years.
If the revived Scottish women's movement since the 1970s has much in common
with the rest of Britain, since around the mid-1980s it has become more
separate and consciously Scottish: arguments about gender and nationhood and
``the double knot in the peeny'' have been important, as has women's political
response to Conservative rule, and the way women have participated in building
a distinctive political culture. Disgruntlement with the ``double democratic
deficit'' has brought women actively into the process of constitutional reform.
As Isobel Lindsay from the Campaign for a Scottish Parliament and Alice Brown
at Edinburgh University, among others, have observed, this has been a catalyst
for a radical and assertive response to women's limited representation.
The prospect of a new legislature has galvanised interest and brought women
together from all sorts of political backgrounds and none. Arguments about a
different electoral system, sensible and ``family friendly'' parliamentary
procedures, authentic consultation, and the role of civic society have been as
important as 50/50 representation. Gender equality has become the cornerstone
of a vision of a Scottish parliament as more participatory and responsive; an
intrinsic part of the debates on access, accountability, and democracy.
Less commented on is how this has led to a wider stage for women's politics and
a different kind of dialogue with other players on it - a conversation which
has been perhaps a little more equal, with more real communication than in the
past. Rather than a women's movement which is wholly oppositional its voice is
now acknowledged, if still often misunderstood and talked over.
It is when women within and outwith traditional political structures have
worked, if not in clear accord, then at least in parallel and with some
communication and mutual respect, that most has been achieved. This was true
for the British legislation of the 1970s; it is also true of the quite rapid
porgress made on key women's issues in the Republic of Ireland in the 1980s and
1990s.
In Scotland, such a useful convergence, allied to a more pragmatic feminism, is
reason for cautious optimism. And reason to believe that interests and
approaches defined as ``women's'' are more and more part of a shared vision of
the kind of political future we want.

SKIERS are a faithful lot. Come budget or bank rates, inflation or skidding
currency, the addicts are now anxiously awaiting the first snowfalls, searching
out bargains and new areas, where their francs, schillings, pounds or lire can
go furthest.
So what's on the ski map for 1995/96?
In headline terms, the snow-sure resorts of the US and Canadian Rockies are
being strongly featured in the tour operators' brochures, since our two main
skiing countries, Austria and France, have pretentious currencies (15
schillings for a pound in Austria, and about seven francs in France) that have
made them expensive for British skiers.
Thomsons, the largest tour operator, have reintroduced four Rocky Mountain
resorts. In the US, the British beginners' favourite of Breckenridge, smart
Vail and Beaver Creek, and Winter Park, the nearest major resort to Denver,
offer flights from Manchester and Gatwick, with prices starting at #406 a week,
for flights and room only.
In lesser-known Canada, they're offering Banff and Lake Louise, both beautiful
areas with a good variety of skiing, Jasper, most suitable for beginners to
intermediates, and the highly challenging Whistler. Prices here start at #415
from Heathrow.
The debate about North America v Europe continues to run; certainly standards
of transatlantic safety are almost obsessional, while maintenance of the skis
and lifts is unbeatable, as are the standards of tuition and fun in the ski
schools, as well as the friendliness and welcome often missing in sometimes
surly France and Switzerland, though rarely in Austria.
There are more holidays on offer this year in tax-free Andorra, in the nearby
French Pyrenees and in Italy, particularly Livigno, where costs of extras,
passes, equipment hire and tuition are half of most other parts of Europe.
The black run bashers maintain that the Alps still have the most challenging
skiing, and that the vast connected areas such as the Val d'Isère/Tignes
circuit and the Trois Vallees in France, the huge St Anton-Lech region in
Austria and the Sella Ronda in Italy, have this as well as the cosiness, the
rustic huts and mountain restaurants of the traditional Alpine resorts.
WHETHER the beginners are children or adults, the choice of the ski resort is
critical. Few resorts are really suitable for experienced skiers and total
beginners, and certainly in year one it is best to compromise by choosing a
resort for the least experienced in the party, perhaps with classier resorts
nearby.
What are the special needs for a total learner?
It all starts with the ski school; English-language tuition is a must, as is an
understanding of how bad we Brits can be.
Cheap equipment hire and limited ski passes (which beginners may not need in
the early days) are sensible; there's no point in paying for the latest
equipment, or expensive passes covering miles of hillside.
The nursery slopes should be near the village centre, avoiding the need to lug
cumbersome equipment all over the hillside. Gentle, wide and easy slopes should
also be accessible, for the blissful time the learners move from the painful
snowplough to piste skiing.
Finally, there should be plenty of life and lots to do in the village or
resort, in case the beginner decides to drop out - this happens to about a
quarter of first-time skiers.
The best skiing country for beginners is still Austria - the natives are
welcoming, tuition is excellent and standardised throughout the country. Most
resorts have plenty of après ski activities.
Alpbach is a friendly and picturesque mountain village, with good nursery
slopes near the village, swimming, sleigh rides, tobogganing, indoor tennis, as
well as bars and cafes to keep holidaymakers happy off the slopes.
Obergurgl, only discovered in 1931 is high enough to have snow over a long
season - which means it is above the treeline and can be a bit bleak in
January. There's a good ski school that meets near the hotels, cosy apres ski,
plus two nearby resorts for more advanced skiers.
Skiing in France is superb, but by no means always for the beginners, and ski
classes tend to be large. There are miles of runs of most grades - but many are
too difficult for all but budding geniuses for the first few years.
La Plagne is a large, modern purpose-built resort, and like most of these, a
little light on atmosphere. The accommodation is largely in concrete towers,
but the ski schools are good, and nursery slopes excellent and well maintained.
Flaine is somewhat smaller, very popular with the British; not too far from the
airport, with good kindergarten and children's beginners classes - though the
après ski is a bit thin on the ground.
The United States is having a revival on the British ski market. The advantages
are the language, and excellent ski facilities, the disadvantages the long
flight and transfers, a problem with young children.
Breckenridge is a Colorado resort, an old silver mining town with lots of
restaurants and nightlife (although remember, those under 21 cannot get
alcoholic drinks) has excellent skiing, good facilities for beginners, while
the more expert skiers have decent skiing of their own.
Other resorts that are suitable for total beginners, but which aren't death to
skiers in the party; Westendorf, Igls, Soll and Niederau in Austria; Les Arcs,
Avoriaz, Courchevel, La Clusaz and Valmorel in France; Saas in Switzerland.
DON'T believe the hoary old chestnut that all you have to do with the very
young is to strap skis to their feet, and they'll be off down the slopes,
fearless, fully in control. It's a legend that insurance claims are made of.
Couples who have been skiing for blissful childless years think they can take
junior to their favourite (lots of black runs) resort, put him or her into ski
class and that's it - maybe by day three they'll be skiing together. Ha Ha!
Apart from the distance of the resort from the airport (the nearer the better),
it once again all starts with the ski school. I remember my first born lining
up, as a minority of one in a French class, falling over and so knocking down
half the class, with the pigeon English speaking instructor not very amused.
Tears - and total refusal to return on that trip.
British, or largely British classes, with English speaking instructors is an
absolute essential, as is the proximity of the class to your accommodation;
it's not fun walking for miles four times a day (or at least twice) delivering
or collecting junior, carrying his equipment before he causes serious injury to
others within ski-pole distance.
Choose a resort with plenty of non-skiing activities, in case the child drops
out. And of course if the kids are say under six, then an excellent nursery (or
obliging Granny) are vital.
Mayrhofen in Austria actually breaks the basic rule of the proximity of the
nursery slopes to the village - but since they collect children from the foot
of the cable car which is in the centre, keep them all day and deliver them
back to the village, it is my number one choice anywhere in the world.
THE ski school is a family affair, run by the Spiess family, started by Riki
Spiess, a former Olympic ski medallist, her grown up children and even
grandchildren - plus a cosy heated hut where the young skiers are made to relax
over lunch and a couple of cartoon films.
Hinterglemm is another village where learners have their own hillside, away
from the queues and traffic. Within a few days of tuition, children can usually
join one of the easy blue runs and maybe even undertake a seven kilometre run
back to the village - a triumph indeed.
The skiing is too good in many of the best French resorts to spend money on
extensive ski passes for beginners. The largest nursery slopes are probably at
Isola 2000, developed and built by a British company. As long as you stay at
the top end of the resort, the rather untidy Alpe d'Huez offers both a large
range of creches for pre-ski children, and British owned ski school for those
learning to ski.
Other resorts with excellent facilities for children include Flaine, Avoriaz
and La Plagne in France, Wengen and Saas Fee in Switzerland.
To entice families on to the slopes together, and reasonably economically,
Thomsons have chosen 16 resorts which offer savings on child prices,
supervision, free children's ski school, and some free lift passes.
Their Polar Bear Ski Club in five resorts provides children between four and
eight years old with mornings or afternoons on the slopes or fun and games for
non-skiing children, organised by NNEB trained representatives. The cost is
between #40-#90 a week.
Family ski specialists Ski Esprit (01252 616789) run half-day Snow Clubs on six
days every week at four French resorts, with horse-drawn rides, tobogganing,
nature trails, picnics and snow art, and some baby sitting - this costs #89 per
week, including lunches.
THERE'S no such thing as cheap skiing - but there are ways of making the whole
business less expensive.
Dates are crucial - avoid the high seasons, which include the Christmas and New
Year holidays and school half term. The best reductions are in January, after
New Year celebrations, and after Easter - when you have to go high to be sure
of snow.
If there are three or four of you, take a car package, offered by various tour
operators. A car is also very useful in the resort. You can reach most of the
French skiing areas in a very long day's driving with a change of driver, but
budget for an overnight stop for Austria and Switzerland.
Coach skiing holidays are the cheapest way to get to the snow - although not
suitable for small children, most coaches these days offer videos, reclining
seats and toilets.
Look out for last-minute bargains - companies offer real discounts of between
#50-#60, if you specify the resort, and they pick the accommodation.
Take advantage of the ski companies' special money-saving holidays - Thomsons
for example offer Learn to Ski Weeks in a couple of dozen resorts, where the
price includes equipment hire, English speaking instructors, discounts on ski
passes, clubs for children and even free babysitting.
Andorra, tucked away in the Pyrenees between France and Spain is the tax-free
country with friendly instructors, mainly British and Australian instructors,
perhaps missing the most challenging skiing, but with plenty to do off as well
as on the slopes. Arinsal and Soldev with wide, open runs are its best resorts
for beginners and intermediates, while advanced skiers will find more challenge
at Pas de la Casa, Andorra's highest resort. Boot and ski hire costs under #40
a week, with passes just over #50 - about half of what you can pay in France
and Austria.
Bulgaria is another budget choice, lacking perhaps the charm and après ski
options of the Alpine resorts, but what you miss in character, you'll make up
by real money savings.
In Pamporovo, there are 14 runs suitable for beginners, and at Borovets the
slopes are gentle and sunny. Cost of equipment hire is similar to that in
Andorra, but ski school is even cheaper, while a lift pass will be around of
#35.
Italy too has its advantages, and disadvantages for the budget skier. It is too
far to drive, and some of the distances from the airport can be horrific. But
equipment hire is even cheaper than in Andorra and Bulgaria (#28 for six days),
though lift passes cost more than in those countries.
Livigno is one of the most popular resorts, though the five hours plus drive
from the airport make it unsuitable for families with children. But there's
plenty of skiing, and the resorts of Bormio and Santa Caterina are on the same
pass. The village of Livigno is somewhat chaotic, but like much of Italy great
fun - with the added advantage that drinks are below the supposed duty-free
airport prices.
Cauterets and Barège in the French Pyrenees are just about accessible by car,
and much cheaper than some French Alpine resorts - though you'll have to pay
#60 or more for ski hire, and lift passes can cost from #100 upwards for six
days.
IF resorts for non-skiers seems like a contradiction, it refers to those who've
tried it and hated it, to those non-sporting partners or appendages who like
the scenery but not the scene, and to pregnant women decent enough to indulge
their partners by going along. As one who came under the latter heading on
several occasions, my own requirements have been those traffic free resorts
with lots of walks (usually with cross country Langlauf skiing) - Saas Fee in
Switzerland being a perfect example, and Australian resorts within easy reach
of Innsbruck or Salzburg, with good public transport. The lack of charm and
activities in Flaine and Les Menuires in France were two that nearly caused
serious domestic friction.
Choose a resort where there are lots of shops, perhaps a swimming pool, sleigh
transport and a lift system which allows you to go up to the mountain and
admire the scenery, and enjoy the huts and restaurants - returning to base by
cable car.
For the non-pregnant non-skiers, look out for skating, perhaps riding, good
places nearby for excursions and lots of activity, with the larger Austrian and
Swiss resorts being the most suitable.
Switzerland's Pearl of the Alps, Saas Fee deserves its title - a genuine
Valaisanne village, guarded by a glacier, quaint wooden cuckoo clock chalets
with logs stacked outside for the winter, no cars, no sky scrapers, outstanding
shopping, so what more can a non skier ask for?
Excellent school for beginners, and most important this - the slopes converge
in the heart of the village near the cafes, so that it's easy to meet up with
the rest of the party.
For the non-skiers, or those who want a day off, there's a really fine leisure
centre which they call a resort in a resort, with pools, saunas, gymnasium,
Turkish bath, plus a centre for cross country skiing and walking.
Fine shopping - look closely at some of the oldest chalets, half of which are
shops selling jewellery, watches, designer wear and other high quality goods
for a high quality resort.
IF you can, avoid January, when the sun never seems to top the mountains bowl,
and it's cold. In Austria, more than half of Seffield's winter holidaymakers
never set foot on skis - they spend their time . . . eating in some of the 70
or so restaurants, they play tennis on stupendous indoor courts, or try their
hand at bowling. In between, as with most Alpine resorts, there are delightful
walks in the woods on prepared paths.
Seffield is also one of Austria's largest cross-country centres, with more than
120 miles of prepared track. Cross-country is much cheaper than downhill
skiing, and even a beginner can lope off into the woods to enjoy the peace and
silence.
Innsbruck, the capital of the Austrian Tyrol, and not itself a ski resort,
seems to have found the ideal compromise - packaging five surrounding ski
resorts, while being based in the city itself.
All are linked from Innsbruck by a bus service, with the same ski pass serving
the entire region, offering a great variety of skiing (and sometimes snow
conditions) plus the advantage of a sophisticated city.
For those who will not go near anything resembling a ski, Innsbruck is a
delightful city with its echoes of grandeur of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
combining with the quaintness of the Tyrol - usually traffic free streets of
arcades, rococo houses, baroque churches, shops selling high quality loden
clothes, plus more than 80 bars, restaurants and cafes.
Other resorts for non-skiers: Grindelwald, Wengen and Murren in Switzerland;
Soll and Kitzbuhel in Austria and Chamonix in France.
THERE can be few holiday situations as disastrous as heading off for the annual
ski pilgrimage and finding . . . no snow. And its arrival is totally and
horribly unpredictable.
Last year, from December onwards it lay deep and crisp and even over most
European ski resorts from December onwards. Yet for several years beforehand
the season has been starting later and later, with the best snows not arriving
until late February and March.
The package holidays tend to start in the second week of December, when many
``ski bargains'' can be found. But be warned, the height of the resort above
sea level is critical; generally you must be above 1400 metres before mid
January, or find a resort near a glacier. These include Kaprun, Zell am See,
Hintertux, Obergurgl, Lech and Stubai Valley, all in Austria; Saas Fee, St
Moritz, Zermatt and Verbier in Switzerland; Livigno, Cortina and Courmayeur in
Italy and Les Arcs, La Plagne, Chamonix, Tignes, Val Thorens and Meribel in
France.
The American and Canadian resorts probably have the longest season, from quite
early December to well into March.
It is also worth checking with the National Tourist Offices on the availability
of snow-making machinery. It does not provide snow for long runs, but it can
repair worn out bottlenecks and help to keep the runs down to the village open.
The Consumer Association's (#15.99) includes information on snowmaking, as well
as good early or late skiing.
THE prices quoted are for seven nights, per person, self catering (S/C), half
board (HB) or bed and breakfast (b&amp;b).

DYNAMICS
n At first glance it looks pretty strange, a new design for some very old
technology. It's the banana chair, and from where your Frontiersman sits
hunched over a smoking keyboard, it looks like the apotheosis of all comfort.
One could go for a snooze given half a chance.
The banana chair is what's known as a dynamic seat which effortlessly tips the
sitter into a series of relaxing positions, the most recumbent of which is the
almost flat- out posture. The makers say it's designed to fit the human form
and sitting in it feels just like floating. It even comes with a relaxation
cassette and a booklet of loosening exercises. Just looking at the picture
makes one's eyelids droop. Originally developed in 1988, a low-down version has
now been raised and made more compact, using adjustable armstraps to alter the
sitting angle. The BC portable folds into a little carry-unit easy to store and
haul out into the garden during the next long-awaited heatwave.
It's selling at #279 from the appropriately named Banana Chair Company on
01773-533626.
The firm have brought out an even more complex version, the Butterfly Recliner
at #495, which looks, to this stressed-out scribbler, the ultimate in induced
lethargy. It's a rocking-chair recliner, guaranteed to paralyse all industry.
Once he is sprawled in one of these, wild horses would be hard put to get this
writer out again.

Celebrity surfers
Andi Robertson examines the
rehabilitation of snow bums as skibiz recognises potentially lucrative
new markets
EXPERIENCING near exponential growth currently, snowboarding is the
mid-nineties boom winter sport. Only a couple of years ago, the struggle was to
gain acceptance on the slopes of some of the more conservative resorts. Now
there's a realisation that this is not just a short-term youth fad, complete
with a bad attitude, but it could in fact become a worthwhile profit centre.
Significantly perhaps, this coincided with a projection that 4.8 million
snowboarders will be on the slopes worldwide by the year 2000 - which would
equate to roughly one in three piste users being on a board, not skis.
It has doubled its number of participants each year, a trend unlikely to be
broken as the marketeers and hype merchants seize snowboarding's potential for
the consumer advertising world to sell everything from energy drinks to
breakfast cereal.
Add to that the growing number of celebrity boarders: Sting, Peter Gabriel,
Jamiroquai, Seal, Paula Abdul, Uma Thurman, Daryl Hannah, Eddie Vedder and
Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam, and Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys, and there's
little wonder that every resort that can, is opening its arms and welcoming the
prodigal sport as it inexorably heads mainstream.
Although its roots in the USA date back to the late sixties with Tom Sims
regarded as one of the founding fathers, latterly along with Sherwin Popper,
Dimitre Milovich and Jake Burton Carpenter who have all contributed to varying
degrees. It is undoubtedly the latter whose company, Burton, has popularised
many of the technological developments which have ultimately made the sport
all-mountain and all-terrain.
The majority of today's boarders still come from a surfing, windsurfing or
skateboarding background, with a small, but growing percentage completely
abandoning skis in favour of a board. Skateboarding has left the strongest
imprint, while the obvious common manoeuvres and tricks are readily translated
from street to slope - or indeed icy half pipe - with no separate phrase-book
needed for their cryptic descriptions.
``The average board buyer is still very much in the 17 to 29-year-old age
bracket,'' confirms Andy Groom of Glasgow snowboard shop Mach, ``but it's
really only recently that we've started to see more families, for example, come
in and hire a board to try for the first time. As well as the exposure it's
enjoying I'm sure that word is starting to filter through that it's actually
easier to learn than skiing.''
The British Snowboard Association now has a recognised three-level teaching
qualification which is highly regarded around the world; and it is now working
closely alongside BASI, the British Association of Ski Instructors, in its
ongoing tuition developments.
All the Scottish resorts now have some level of qualified teaching on their
hills, and boards can be hired on the hill, or from most specialist retailers.
Aviemore snowboard shop Boardwiser reckon to have hired to more than 9000
customers last season and this year will have rental equipment for children as
young as seven or eight: ``Currently boards must be one of the main presents on
loads of children's Christmas lists, because we're inundated at the moment with
parents looking to find out what's best for their kids,'' says Boardwiser's
Justin.
The competition scene equally owes much to surfing and skateboarding. While
there is a mainly alpine-based circuit run by skiing's governing body, the
Federation Internationale de Ski (FIS), who currently hold the keys of the door
to the Olympics (where the sport will feature in the Japan games of 1998);
snowboarding's own international body, the ISF, runs a flourishing circuit of
its own which is well supported by the trade and runs the full range of
freestyle and boardercross plus gate events.
The hard-core ISF members take exception to being described by the FIS as
merely a discipline of skiing and are campaigning for Olympic status in their
own right. Meanwhile riders who compete in FIS-sanctioned events cannot go on
to race at ISF events.
Boardercross is the latest contest to capture the boarders' competitive zeal.
It is a mass start downhill race which takes in jumps and tricks en route and
was the most popular event at last year's well-supported British Championships
in Val d'Isere.
A full calendar of competitions is already planned for next year in Scotland,
ranging from the Scottish Championships which will be a mainly freestyle
contest and a boardercross, to a fun weekend at Cairngorm sponsored by clothing
company Westbeach.
Typifying the moves by UK resorts to accommodate the unique needs of the
snowboarder, Cairngorm will have a custom-built snowboard fun park in
operation. Free to users, it will be designed and maintained by Boardwiser and
situated on the Fiacaill Ridge. It will include big quarter-pipe jumps, table
tops and railslides with at least half a dozen exciting ``toys'' according to
the shop's staff.
As much as anything it is the level of technology - which has stayed abreast,
at least, of what the leading edge exponents are doing - which has meant that
riders have continued to enjoy the sport, making progress. Time was, when
powder snow was the snowboarder's raison d'etre, but now with the advances in
board construction, making them stiffer and lighter, even old hard packed snow
can be enjoyed.
There are four main types of board. Freeride boards cover all types of terrain
and conditions, and along with freestyle boards - used for tricks and spins -
should be the first purchase of the newcomer. JIB boards are for more advanced
skate style tricks and fun-park riding while freecarve boards are for
alpine-style riding with hard boots.
A specialist retailer is undoubtedly the best first stop for the newcomer. Most
have been around since the sport started in Scotland and will give good advice
on where to go and learn - and what to hire or buy.

SOUP, that most versatile of all dishes, comes in many differing guises. As a
family we eat soup as the standard Macdonald family lunch throughout the
autumn, winter and spring.
Early in the new year I intend to give some thought to main-course soups, as I
think of them. Today my attention is focused upon an altogether more elegant
aspect - soup as a first course. I feel that soup as a first course has been
forgotten. We have all tended towards the knife-and-fork type of first course,
imagining it to be more impressive. We are wrong! With one or two provisos, few
first courses can beat a good soup in our lengthy cold weather months.
These provisos are the soup shouldn't be too thick, which is not only inelegant
but makes it far too filling when followed by a main course and pudding, and
that great care is taken in its making.
To explain myself on this last point, the most vital prerequisite for
first-class soup is really good stock. I tend to use chicken stock for pretty
well all my soups, but if you don't eat meat, make vegetable stock, which takes
10 minutes in a microwave oven, and 40-45 minutes on a conventional cooker.
All homemade stock is better by far than a cube and water, and better, too,
than ready-made bought stock. Good stock makes all the difference not only to
the taste of soup but also to its texture.
Before I turn to the variety of soups which make suitable first course
subjects, there are a number of ways to dress up a good soup - I hesitate to
use the word garnish. One of the most obvious garnishes are croutons. These
shouldn't be deep fried because that renders them saturated with fat, but an
even golden brown colour is easily reached if you bake your croutons. Brush the
slices of bread on each side with melted butter, cut off the crusts, and slice
into fine and neat cubes.
Brush a baking tray with melted butter and spread the bread over the tray. Bake
till the depth of colour is reached - open the oven and shake the contents of
the tray a couple of times as they bake. You can flavour croutons with curry
powder or bashed cumin seeds, or sprinkle them with freshly grated Parmesan
cheese halfway through baking.
Croutons render serving bread or rolls unnecessary and should be handed round
in a bowl with a spoon - this prevents them from becoming soggy as they sit in
the hot soup.
Herbs make a good garnish: not chopped parsley, but a leaf of flat-leaved
parsley, or a sprig of dill - good on leek and potato soup. Other garnishes can
be a fine chopping of a relevant ingredient of the soup - finely diced apples
in the soup recipe today. Or skinned, diced and deseeded tomatoes chopped
finely or sliced into slivers in a smooth tomato and carrot soup.
Which brings me to the content of smart soups - for my taste, beetroot makes
one of the very best. Not only does it taste so good but it looks positively
beautiful, with its richly ecclesiastical purple hue. I always feel a twinge of
guilt when I serve Bortsch because I have always understood true Bortsch to be
made with duck stock. I never make duck stock, only chicken.
To make Bortsch thin enough for a dinner party two large or three smaller
beetroot cooked in 1!s pints of stock give the right texture.
Carrot soups, flavoured with ginger and garlic, liquidised and sieved when
cooked to get the desired smoothness of texture, make  memorable eating. The
quantity of  garlic and ginger needn't be feared; the result, if both are well
cooked, is a very pleasing glow of flavour.
Lady Claire Macdonald praises the          oft-neglected culinary virtues of
soup

Brussels
NATO ambassadors unanimously picked Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana as
the new head of the Alliance today, ending six weeks of often bitter
transatlantic arguments.
``Ambassadors have agreed by consensus to propose Javier Solana, currently
Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, as Secretary-General of Nato and chairman
of the North Atlantic Council,'' the Alliance announced.
The choice of the 53-year-old Spaniard will be formally endorsed at a meeting
of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday.
The Spaniard will replace Belgium's Willy Claes, who was forced to quit on
October 20 after being implicated in a bribery scandal involving his party in
the late 1980s.
Nato had desperately wanted to resolve the succession before it sends a
60,000-strong force to police the peace in Bosnia. The first elements may leave
for Bosnia as early as tomorrow.
It will be the first time the Alliance has had a secretary-general from a
country whose armed forces are not fully part of Nato's integrated military
structure.
Diplomats stressed that Spain, unlike France, was a member of the Alliance's
nuclear planning group and participated in military planning.
However, Solana must be the first Nato chief to have campaigned actively
against his country joining the Alliance.
The Spanish Socialist Party swept to power in 1982 on a ticket that promised to
tke the country out of Nato if the people voted for such a move in a
referendum, and Solana used the issue as part of his platform.
He became the Minister of Culture in the first post-Franco Socialist government
and remains the only member of the Spanish Cabinet to have served alongside
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez throughout his 13 years in power.
Carlos Miranda, Spain's ambassador to Nato, who as Dean of the North Atlantic
Council chaired today's informal meeting, welcomed the choice.
``This is a very good and important day for Spain,'' he told reporters in
Madrid, adding that the appointment was ``a great recognition of Spain's
contribution to the Alliance''.
Britain said Solana had the right attributes for a tough job. ``We are
confident he has the right qualities and experience to take on this demanding
post,'' said Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel commented: ``Javier Solana is a
first-class choice. (He) combines a European outlook and a commitment to
transatlanticism with the ability to lead. He has demonstrated this clearly
during the Spanish presidency of the European Union, which is just ending.''
The news came as Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen announced in
Copenhagen that he was withdrawing his candidacy for the top Nato job.
``I congratulate my former Spanish colleague,'' he said in a statement. ``I
express the hope that he will use it to work for a strengthening of the
transatlantic ties as well as a strengthening of the European pillar of Nato.''
Solana emerged as a clear favourite for the post after the United States vetoed
former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, the European candidate, on November
10 and the French refused to agree to Ellemann-Jensen, who was Washington's
choice.-Reuter.

2oz butter
2 onions, skinned and chopped
2 good eating apples, eg Cox's, cored, skins left on and chopped
3 washed sticks of celery, trimmed and chopped

Simmer gently till the celery is soft. Cool, liquidise, adding the cheese to
the liquidiser. You can use any good blue cheese in this recipe. Season with
nutmeg and pepper, and salt if it is needed. Sieve the soup. Reheat carefully,
in a clean saucepan, and taking care not to let the soup boil, which will make
the texture granular. If you like, stir a couple of tablespoons of chopped
flat-leaved parsley through the soup just before serving.

Walking in all of
the squares
Archibald S Thom
Argyll Publishing, #16.99
HISTORY
HELPING to build a bridge over the Salmon River in Ontario in 1913, Sandy Thom
saw one of the Red Indian squad throwing his sledge- hammer into the water far
below. Several other Indians scrambled down into the river to retrieve the
hammer which hadn't been thrown in a temper, as Thom thought. The Indians
brought up the pike that the thrower had seen from the heights.
It was a lesson for Alexander Thom. Ancient practices can survive in a modern
context. He was to use this insight when he came to study standing stones and
circles in Scotland and beyond. Had they been thrown together, or raised to a
design?
Thom was the classic lad o' parts: from a Carradale, Argyll, farm (born 1894)
to Oxford as professor of civil engineering, via a teaching post at Glasgow
university and important work on gun ships, flying boats and Spitfires in two
world wars. Retirement is a restriction of cerebral function for many people,
but Thom had a new career in the sights of his theodolite.
A superb sailor and navigator, he had entered the quiet anchorage of East Loch
Roag on Lewis on a summer evening in 1933 to see the rising moon with the
stones of Callanish, the ``Stonehenge of Scotland,'' silhouetted against it.
``After dinner we went ashore to explore. I saw by looking at the Pole star
that a north-south line existed in the complex. This fascinated me, as I knew
that when the site was built no star of any magnitude had been at, or near the
celestial pole.
``Precession had not yet brought Polaris as near to the celestial pole as it is
now. I wondered whether the alignment was a chance occurrence or whether it had
been deliberately built that way.''
Thom had found a subject to which he was to devote most of his time and
creative brilliance on his retirement from Oxford in 1961. He collected
information on as many megalithic sites as possible, as far apart as the Orkney
and Brittany, arguing (as Magnus Magnusson stated in the Chronicle television
programme he made with Thom) that ``Stone Age people were not just simple
primitives. They could be intelligent and sophisticated mathematicians and
astronomers to whom time was an exercise in science, using stones as calendars
and clocks; men who could measure and survey with the accuracy of a modern
theodolite.''
At Kintraw there is a standing stone, a large ruined cairn, a deep gully and on
the far side of the gully, 20 feet further up, a large boulder on a ledge like
a platform. Thom was convinced that a Stone Age man, standing on the platform,
made his first observation of the winter solstitial sun setting in the Paps of
Jura behind Ben Shianti 30 miles away.
Thom's book Megalithic Sites in Britain (1967) caused much controversy and
scepticism, but he was a man sure in his opinions and in his mathematics. The
appeal of this biography by his son and collaborator Archibald is not only the
great affection and respect he had for his father, but because of its wandering
narrative.
The Thoms lived at The Hill Farm, Dunlop, Ayrshire, where Alexander built his
own house, Thalassa, in 80 days. How invigorating it is to read the story of a
man of independent mind who seems to have cracked ``the Stone Age code,''
whatever the sceptics say.

PRESIDENT Jacques Chirac must be seeking posthumous guidance this weekend from
the spirit of General de Gaulle, the man he claims to follow, as the nationwide
public sector strike in France gets even worse.
There are already no trains and no public transport. Half the country's postal
sorting offices have stopped work and many universities are closed. Electricity
and gas workers have gone on strike and teachers have voted for a stoppage next
week.
Air traffic at Orly Airport was disturbed yesterday when maintenance workers
occupied the runways. Last night, two of the main unions, CGT and FO, pushed
for the strike to be extended to other public sector branches and announce they
are ready to continue their action until December 12.
The student riots and general strike of May 1968 which almost toppled General
de Gaulle has become a nervous topic of conversation in government circles as
France slithers further towards economic paralysis this weekend. On Thursday,
France's Prefets, the regional representatives of central government, had talks
with Prime Minister Alain Juppe about alternative means of transport and
requisitioning the army.
Mr Juppe has even been said to have had television facilities installed in his
Paris offices in order to address the nation in case of extreme difficulty.
President Chirac, meanwhile, who kept cautiously in the wings last week,
leaving his ministers to stand front stage and face the abuse, is going to have
to take firm action of some sort.
For the government has dug in, repeating it will not go back on welfare reform,
waiting to see which way public opinion will turn, and hoping, unrealistically,
that disagreements will weaken the unions. Already at a historically low
popularity level, Mr Juppe, ``a man so wounded that he can no longer feel
pain'' as one commentator put it, dare not change tack. To do so at such an
early stage of Mr Chirac's presidency would deprive the latter of credibility
for the rest of his seven-year mandate.
Dissolving the National Assembly and calling a General Election, as did
President Chirac's role model, General de Gaulle, in 1968, appears futile,
given the huge majority he already enjoys. A national referendum on the welfare
reforms which provoked the strikes is an increasing possibility.
President Chirac's Gaullist RPR party, meanwhile, is organising a demonstration
by its supporters in Paris on Thursday - exactly as the general's followers
staged a giant march on the Champs Elysee in 1968 to help extinguish the May
riots. To add to the government's pain, meanwhile, seven by-elections are being
held in the Paris region tomorrow.
The strikes have scuppered all hopes of increased pre-Christmas spending. As if
the economic consequences were not dire enough, figures published last week
have brought even deeper gloom: consumer spending is down, unemployment has
increased for the third consecutive month, and France is heading for zero
growth in 1996.
It is not only the extent of the strikes, and the discomfort they entail, but
also the violence of the protests that has proved a shock. One hundred thousand
students and workers took part in demonstrations in 12 towns and cities on
Thursday. The marches in Paris and Nantes in Britanny ended in violence,
apparently committed by outside elements, who ransacked a university cafeteria
and library and looted shops. They destroyed bus shelters and telephone kiosks
and set alight cars and buses.
Physical destruction was met yesterday with verbal violence when the government
accused unions of lying about their plans concerning the state-controlled
sector.
Even supporters of the government are dismayed by the tactlessness with which
Mr Juppe, after doing little during his first months in power to honaour
President Chirac's spectacular election promises on unemployment and
relaunching the economy, has piled reform upon reform within a very short
period, without consulting unions or explaining his intentions properly.
Changes to France's deeply indebted welfare state have been introduced at the
same time as reforms of the country's equally overdrawn rail service and the
pension schemes of public employees. The abolition of certain tax allowances
affecting all salaried workers have also been put forward without proper
explanation. To cap it all, Mr Juppe announced he would push his measures
through by decree, to avoid debate in the National Assembly.

<HEADLINE>Provisions that will make saving rather less taxing</HEADLINE>

THE Chancellor ack-nowledged in this week's Budget that paying for long-term
care for the elderly is a growing problem for many families. Most people were
disappointed, though, that he did not go further.
The immediate measures he announced were modest. However, he did float a number
of other ideas and will be consulting on proposals to encourage people to make
advance provision for long-term care.
Immediate action includes an easing of the means testing of elderly people who
need to enter long-term nursing or residential care. At present you have to
make a contribution towards this if your savings are more than #3000. If you
have over #8000 you must meet the full cost. Following the Budget you will
qualify for help with fees if you have less than #16,000 and free care when
your assets drop to #10,000.
Age Concern Scotland has welcomed the change but its director, Maureen O'Neill,
points out its limitations: ``The increase in capital limits will help people
with modest savings who need residential or nursing care, but will not prevent
them having to sell their homes to pay for care. The Chancellor's failure to
increase capital limits for means-tested benefits for people living at home,
means the benefit system will continue to penalise older people with savings.''
Providing more free care will involve extra expenditure by local authorities
and the DSS. The Government has said it will provide them with a special grant
to cover this. At the moment, though, according to Age Concern, the amount
allocated for this appears insufficient.
``Church of Scotland homes for the elderly are having to be closed because they
are not receiving enough funding from local authorities and the Church is not
prepared to compromise on quality. Yet they currently provide the lowest cost
care, at under #300 a week, compared to fees of up to #400 to #500 in the
private sector,'' says Liz Mitchell at Age Concern.
As part of this week's Budget package, the Chancellor also announced that
benefits paid out under long-term care insurance policies are to be made tax
free, even where they go direct to the person needing care. Until now, only
payments made straight to care providers have been tax free.
This new provision should make it easier for elderly people to compensate
relatives or friends who give up work to look after them in their own homes.
However, Sandy Johnstone, manager of Commercial Union's long-term care
insurance arm, is somewhat dubious about the possible consequences of this
development.
He explains: ``We see potential problems and abuses. Where we are paying fees
direct to recognised providers, we know there will be some control over the
quality of care given. If payments are made direct to policyholders to purchase
their own care, it is more difficult to check whether they are getting the
standard of care they really need.''
So far, though, relatively few people have taken out long-term care insurance
policies. These come in two main forms. The first involves making advance
payment, either by regular premiums or a lump sum, to cover the cost of care if
the need arises. Policies will normally pay out if the holder becomes incapable
of undertaking two or three ``activities of daily living'', such as bathing,
dressing, or going to the lavatory unassisted.
Under Commercial Union's Well-Being policy, for example, a 61-year-old man
paying a regular premium of #46.20 per month or a single premium of #4616 would
be entitled to #10,000 worth of annual benefit to pay for care for as long as
it was needed.
The second type of policy is available to those with an immediate need for
care. It is an annuity plan which provides enhanced payments in return for a
lump sum investment. Payments will depend on the holder's state of health on
entering care.
The Government would like to encourage more people to make their own provision
for long-term care. Ideas on which it will be consulting include partnership
schemes similar to those which exist in the US, where people who pay for, say,
the first three years of care in a home then receive it free, without a means
test, allowing them to retain any remaining savings.
Another possibility is to enable those with company pension schemes to opt for
a variable pension, taking a small one in the beginning in exchange for a
larger one in later years to help cover the cost of care.
The insurance industry is keen to get involved in this process. Scottish
Mutual's chief executive Andrew Pople says: ``Health care is an area where we
are actively developing our business. We would welcome the opportunity to take
part in the consultation process on long-term care.''
His views are echoed by Britannia Life's Chris Frohlich, who believes the
Government will also have to consider giving people an extra tax incentive
upfront to start planning for long-term care.
For the present, however, according to Age Concern, most retired people feel
betrayed. They believe they have already paid for their care through a lifetime
of taxes and National Insurance contributions and that the state has broken its
promise to look after them.
MILLIONS of small savers will be spared the hassle of chasing up the tax
inspector and many more should benefit from higher returns on their savings,
thanks to changes announced in the Budget.
Interest from bank and building society savings accounts is to be taxed at 20p
in the pound instead of 25p, the current rate for basic income tax. The change
also applies to income from certain types of annuities, the First Option Bond
from National Savings, gilts, corporate bonds and cash unit trusts.
Savings interest rates may be coming down in the wake of mortgage cuts, but the
tax change means savers will see more of their interest - and free many lower
income savers from the chore of claiming tax back.
Up to now, banks and building societies have deducted 25% from savings interest
even for customers who, because of their low income, should only be paying tax
at 20%.
The Inland Revenue says 5.3 million people are liable to pay tax at the lower
rate and it's a fair bet that a large number of them have money tucked away in
a bank or building society.
Savers in this lower tax band can claim back from the Revenue the 5% extra tax
deducted from their interest by banks and building societies. But it is clear
that many people, particularly older savers, don't bother to chase up what is
owed to them.
From next April, 20% taxpayers won't need to reclaim tax - the lower amount
will automatically be taken off. But they shouldn't forget to claim back what
they are owed for this and the past three tax years. The 20% band was first
introduced in the 1992-93 tax year when it applied to the first #2000 of
taxable income.
Ask for the free leaflet IR11 ``How to reclaim a repayment of tax on bank and
building society interest'' from your local Inland Revenue office or get
details by ringing the free Taxback information line on 0800 660800.
For middle income savers paying tax at the basic rate, the change means more
will be going into their savings account and less to the tax inspector. ``It
means an extra #2m for our savers,'' says David Chalmers of the Dunfermline
Building Society.
Higher rate taxpayers are still due to pay 40% on their interest, although
there is a boost to their cash flow because they'll receive a higher level of
net interest before having to pay the extra tax due.
But all sorts of taxpayers who also invest in life insurance policies may
benefit longer term from the tax cut.
Life insurance companies already pay 20% tax on their dividend income from UK
shares, but face the higher 25% rate on many other types of investments,
including bank deposits and gilts. When the rate of tax on these drops to 20%
next April the effect should be a higher net income for the companies and
better returns for policyholders.
``There has to be much more discussion on the mechanics of the change to
determine just how much of a reduction in tax this means for life companies,
but this is potentially very good news for policyholders.
``It's also welcome to see the Chancellor moving towards a level playing field
so life companies are not taxed at a higher rate than other savings vehicles,''
says Standard Life.
``There are many factors that determine returns on life policies, but a rise in
our net income must be good for policyholders,'' says Anne Young at Scottish
Widows.
The reduction is also good news for higher rate taxpayers who put their money
into single premium life policies - often called investment bonds.
When these policies mature - or when the holder dies or cashes in early - the
gain made takes into account basic rate tax. But higher rate taxpayers have to
pay more - the difference between the basic rate (24% from April) and the
higher rate of 40%.
Once the tax rate on savings income is cut a large part of the gain made within
the policy will be taxed at only 20%, although higher rate payers will still be
treated as though they've paid 24% on the gain.
``If the tax proposals go ahead as planned that will mean the effective tax
rate on investment bond profits for higher rate payers will be lower,'' says
Gavin Stewart at Scottish Amicable.
The tax change also has implications for those coming up to retirement. It has
always been a good idea to take the maximum cash lump sum you can from a
company pension scheme and reinvest some of it in an annuity to boost your
retirement income.
That's because the regular pension paid from your company is liable to tax in
full, but income from an annuity you buy yourself is only partially taxed.
From April the taxable portion will face tax at only 20% making this type of
annuity look even more attractive than before the Budget announcement,
especially if interest rates head still lower.

IF the Pastels are the most obvious support act for Teenage Fanclub,
particularly in Glasgow, then they are also the most apt. Only a few songs into
their set, remarkably their first Barrowland show in their 12-year existence,
they shared aesthetic and songwriting values. In short, the two bands listen to
the same kind of records: the right ones.
In spite of the self-mocking references to ``our usual lack of
professionalism'', this is one of the Pastels' most cohesive sets for some
time. With flute and an additional guitar augmenting the three permanent band
members who share lead vocal duties, the set mixes the best of Mobile Safari
(Coolport, Basement Scam, and Token Collecting) with a knowing cover version,
an offshoot project song and a nod to the past in Truck, Train, Tractor.
It is also quite obvious why Teenage Fanclub, and not the Pastels, are
headlining. Where the latter's excellence is studied and sporadic, the
Fanclub's comes in sackloads and is made all the more remarkable by its
apparent ease of execution.
Where most other homecoming shows by established acts rely on crowd-pleasing,
watered down, souped-up versions of their best songs with a great light show,
the Fanclub delve into the back catalogue and recorded highlight, Grand Prix,
with only the warmth of the songs to call on.
Such is the charm, self-assurance, and unassuming nature of both the band and
the songs that to succeed in this manner makes for a much greater triumph. Star
Sign, The Concept, Radio, and Sparky's Dream played back to back make for a
great quartet of intelligent and timeless pop songs while 120 Minutes and
Versimilitude show the qualitative depths of the band.

SCOTLAND'S Tracey Craik produced a final-round 75 yesterday to win the American
Express Tour qualifying school tournament at the La Manga Club, Spain.
With a level-par aggregate of 288, Craik finished two strokes ahead of
Australian Anne-Marie Knight, with Tracy Loveys one stroke further behind.
There were 41 players who earned exempt places on the Tour next season,
including Myra McKinlay, who had a closing-round 74 to finish on 298, and Morag
Wright, whose 78 enabled her to qualify with one stroke to spare.
``It wasn't very good today,'' said Craik. ``I missed a short putt on the
eighth and that seemed to put me out of my stride, but the cheque will help to
pay for the week.''
The winner had started the final round four strokes ahead of Loveys, who
birdied two of her first three holes, while Craik drove into rough to drop an
early shot at the second.
She redeemed this with a birdie at the third, where she hit a  No. 9-iron to
eight feet before finding sand to take 4 at the short fifth, then missed a putt
of 18 inches for another 4 at the eighth.
Craik then pulled her No. 3-iron into sand to drop another shot at the ninth
and, out in 39, was now only one stroke clear of Loveys and two ahead of
Knight, the losing finalist in this year's US amateur championship.
A birdie at the eleventh from 20ft steadied Craik who came home in 36, with
Knight moving into second place with a birdie at the last to creep past Loveys.
Final qualifiers:
288 - T Craik 71, 72, 70, 75 (#1050).

THEATRE
RALPH RICHARDSON: The Authorised Biography
John Miller
Sidgwick and Jackson, #16.99
IT comes as a surprise to be reminded that of that triumvirate of theatrical
knights who dominated the British theatre for almost half a century, Olivier,
Gielgud and Richardson, the first to be knighted was Ralph Richardson, possibly
the least remembered at the moment of the trio.
He got his knighthood in the 1947 New Year Honours, a deeply jealous Olivier
had to wait six months for the Birthday Honours for his, while Gielgud was out
in the cold until the Coronation list in 1953.
Gielgud is still with us, the theatrical equivalent of the Queen Mother, a
much-loved institution in his own right. As for Olivier, his reputation is
probably at its nadir, and it is currently modish to sneer at his mannerisms
and tricks in performance. But nobody seems to bother about Richardson, who, in
his prime, managed to be what neither of the others succeeded in becoming - a
genuine star in both the cinema and the theatre.
He was a strange man, prone to violent outbursts, and patently haunted by
demons, who disliked directors, and was ruthless with underlings who dared
upstage him. He loved motor bikes, drank gin like water, kept ferrets and had a
Spanish-speaking parrot called Jose, which he treated like a human being.
Audiences loved him, and his colleagues, in spite of all the difficulties of
coping with such an unpredictable man, found him inspiring. John Miller has
turned to many of them in his attempt to analyse what made a Richardson
performance and the result is a fascinating, detailed picture of the actor at
work. Where this admirable, highly readable books falls down is in its portrait
of the private man. We learn very little about Richardson as a husband - he was
married twice, and had a son, Charles, by his second wife, Meriel Forbes.
Charles appears a couple of times and then completely disappears from his
father's life, or so it seems.
The book records Richardson's long pre-war career and the origins of his
lifelong theatrical partnership and friendship with Gielgud. He was one of the
truly great Falstaffs, a wonderful Peer Gynt, a superb Sir Peter Teazle, an
immaculate performer of the plays of J B Priestley, while in the cinema he was
mesmerising in films like The Fallen Idol, The Sound Barrier and The Heiress.
Gielgud, who contributes an admiring preface, recalls how, when he was
directing School for Scandal, Richardson as Sir Peter, worried about how to
make his first entrance, got stuck during rehearsals. ``Should I have a
newspaper in my hand? A walking-stick? Or be taking snuff, perhaps?,'' he would
ask. At last, one morning he walked down to the footlights and announced -
``You know, Johnny, I prayed to God last night to tell me how to come on in
this opening scene, and this morning God answered `Do what it says in the text,
just come on'. ''

IT seemed not so long ago that Tennents at its Wellpark brewery in Glasgow
introduced two new beers to the Scottish market. At that time Tennent's
70/-Velvet Ale, a 3.5% ABV keg beer, and Aitken's 80/-cask ale, with an ABV of
4.2%, have gained wide ground across the country.
Perhaps heartened by a degree of success in these products, the brewers at
Wellpark have had the recipe books out again and this time their ingenuity has
created two new beers; Tennent's White Thistle, a cask-conditioned ale, and SD
Premium Lager, believed to be the first mixed-gas dispense draught lager.
Born out of Tennent's association in sponsorship of Scottish rugby, White
Thistle stems from the emblem that is woven on to the internationalists'
jerseys. Indeed, it has become the official beer of the Scottish Rugby Union.
Tennents has certainly a creditable performance in past sports sponsorship and
the SRU will surely benefit from the brewer's association with the league and
the new 1556 Cup.
White Thistle is certainly worth a try. It is dark in colour with good malt and
hop flavour, and with an ABV of 3.7% it has an acceptable session-drinking
strength. In a market area where uniqueness of flavour and individuality are
the hallmarks of many beers, White Thistle will certainly not disgrace itself.
It will certainly be the cause of a number of conversions.
The other product from Wellpark is Tennent's SD Premium Lager. Its name has
been derived from the genius of Bass Brewing's marketing department who after
many months of meetings and mind exercises drew up a short list from the draff
and whittled this down to the moniker, SD.
However, as a brew SD is totally different. Dispensed at a temperature of 2¡C
it is four degrees colder than the normal serving temperature of lager. It is
also dispensed using mixed gas which gives the beer a tight creamy head. At 5%
ABV it is in the premium class and a new design of bar font and tall glass give
it a kind of princely status. Indeed, its appearance is also supported with a
range of point-of-sale items such as T-shirts and holdalls.
When Cellarman first sampled SD it was a struggle to find taste. The head
created by the mixed gas overwhelmed the beer and those extra degrees of chill
almost called for gloves to prevent frostbite in the fingers. But just the way
that food can be served too hot to appreciate its taste then so too beer can be
served too cold to capture those tiny, delicate darts of flavour.
As the beer warmed more to my palate then so too did better flavour come
through. The mixed gas head hung on determinedly, however, and was more of an
intrusion than it is in stout.
Apart from the premium status as a beer, SD will be sold at a premium price
which is expected to be about 25p a pint more than ``lesser'' lagers. But
taking the ABV of 5% apart, for lager drinkers SD will be quite a different
experience. Unlike Tennent's lager or Carlsberg lager, SD is not the owner of a
particularly distinctive flavour and it may have more appeal with the drinker
who enjoys beer such as Caffrey's and who dislikes the high fizz factor found
in lager.
SD is certainly different but so too was Ken Brooker of Harviestoun's
Schiehallion, a pioneering cask-conditioned lager which when introduced had a
certain gamble factor attached but which has gone on to be a huge success.
Maclay followed and in the summer 1314, a cask-conditioned seasonal lager,
flowed forth.
But perhaps SD needs a second chance, this time with the gloves off and not at
1100 hours.

BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with the rest of the world narrowed to a better
than expected #972m in September from August's revised #1258m as exports rose
faster than imports.
However, the whole of the change in the overall deficit comes from the
previously reported deficit with with non-EU countries which fell from #1000m
to #702m, largely reflecting a rise in exports to North America. This was later
reversed in the October non-EU trade outcome.
For September the deficit on trade with the EU (the new component in the
figures) was little changed at #270m against August's #248m.
After stripping out oil (a surplus of #403m against #292m in August) and
erratic items defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver, the
underlying gap improved slightly over the month from #1586m to #1402m.
The Central Statistical Office said that despite the improvement in the deficit
in September the latest estimate of trend suggests that the whole world visible
deficit is widening.
Analysts considered that the October global data will probably show the
improvement in the deficit between August and September more than reversed
given the non-EU figures for that month.
In terms of both value and volume with the latter excluding oil and erratics,
the visible trend is for is for imports to rise slightly faster than exports so
the gap is likely to deteriorate moderately in the months ahead.
However, when overseas economic activity begins to stengthen, there could be
some improvement from next spring, according to some sector analysts.

RICH HALL - comedian
n THE best Scottish meal I ever had was ``Monster on Toast'' served in
Inverness. Apparently some fisherman had caught the Loch Ness Monster and the
denizens of the town, knowing the value of tourist income, kept quiet about the
whole affair. On the menu, the monster was obliquely referred to as ``tuna
surprise''.

EVEN AT this, the eighth and last volume, it all seems incomplete. Perhaps
that's as it should be. It was not a life to be done up in ribbons as a gift to
posterity.
Besides, the story has been told well enough and often. Stevenson guessed most
of it himself, with the tainted percipience that comes from constant,
hag-ridden infirmity. He intimated his own mortality, cool as you like, writing
jovially to Edmund Gosse, just days before death arrived, ``I was not born for
age''.
A book such as this, the final instalment of the yarn and an exemplary piece of
scholarship in its own right, might seem to call for some sort of definitive
statement. The truth is there have been too many valedictory speeches made over
Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson. It is as though all the scholars and
biographers and journalists have conspired. We saw, or imagined, criminal
neglect while succumbing to that implausible charm. It may not have been the
best of combinations.
Now, with RLS restored and his reputation as secure as any can be, there is a
chance to conclude the puerile debate between the ``debunkers'', who got their
revenge in early, and the restorers who have been at work in the 40-some years
since J C Furnas and David Daiches began to bring the real Stevenson to light.
With these letters finally in print we can stop treating the writer as a piece
of his own fiction, cease the vicarious adventuring, and consider the artist,
meaning the work.
Stevenson's prose remains a thing of wonder, as people as diverse as Graham
Greene and Jorge Louis Borges have testified. Its punctiliousness owes a
little, perhaps, to his legal training and a good deal, I think, to the
Enlightenment stylists like Hume whose anglicised (Hume would have said
``purified'') Scottish diction was still evident, even in polite society, when
Louis was a boy.
Then there was his auto-didacticism, the apprenticeship of the ``sedulous ape''
mimicking Addison and Steele. Stevenson's paragraphs are like complicated
Victorian instruments, the clauses cogs and spinning gears, the whole
brass-bound with semantic rigour. He is, in all things - politics, family
crises, literary criticism, descriptions of nature - precise.
But then add the metaphorical glitter of Stevenson's Francophilia, nowhere more
evident than in these (generally casual) letters. It gave him his romantic
streak, his panache, and invigorated, perhaps even at an unconscious level, his
storyteller's gift. Thus, even in notes dashed off or dictated it is, always,
the sheer vivacity of the writing that entertains, no matter how grim the
subject. So the veteran of sickness could write to a seriously ill J M Barrie
in July, 1894: ``No, Barrie, 'tis in vain they try to alarm me with their
bulletins.
``No doubt you're ill and unco ill I believe; but I have been so often in the
same case that I know pleurisy and pneumonia are in vain against Scotsmen who
can write. (I once could.) You cannot imagine probably how near me this common
calamity brings you. Ce que j'ai tousse dans ma vie!'' As the world knows, he
packed an amazing amount into these last two years, ``up to the knees in one
novel, up to the waist in another, and over head and ears in verses''. When not
writing he was planning to write; when not toiling he was itching to toil.
In addition to paying work there were the 300 or so letters preserved here,
sometimes very long ones; a publicity campaign in defence of Samoa's natives
(Lord Rosebery, then Foreign Secretary and another correspondent, eventually
warned local officials to leave RLS be) and the aftermath of his wife Fanny's
mental breakdown (still a source of controversy).
There are meditations on his lineage (here he writes to Samuel Smiles, no less,
inquiring after a connection between George Stephenson and his own tribe); an
estate to run, family to feed, thoughts of home (``I wished this morning to see
the hills of Fife in their winter hap . . .''), bills to pay and, always, the
shadow of illness.
RLS was a curious combination of happy charm and pessimism; it may have been
the key to the man. Here he writes to his old friend and lawyer Charles Baxter,
with a native rebellion going on, after fretting over royalties (``Suppose we
got 1000 from the magazines . . .'') and his will:
``It is strange; I must seem to you to blaze in a Birmingham prosperity and
happiness; and to myself, I seem a failure. The truth is, I have never got over
the last influenza yet, and am miserably out of heart and out of kilter. Lungs
pretty right, stomach nowhere, spirits a good deal overshadowed; but we'll come
through it yet, and cock our bonnets. I confess with sorrow that I am not yet
quite sure about the intellects; but I hope it is only one of my usual periods
of non-work. They are more unbearable now, because I cannot rest. No rest but
the grave for Sir Walter! O, the words ring in a man's head.''
The strangest thing about these letters is that they can read almost as a
narrative in their own right, yet it will be a rare reader who does not know
how the story ends, with that famous, brutal, near-mythical suddenness.
The last, self-deprecating words of the final letter read simply: ``(Matter
petered out). Yours ever R L Stevenson''.
Add only that this volume is the magnificent conclusion to a magnificent
enterprise. Bradford Booth, who began it, died in 1968; Ernest Mehew has worked
on it for 25 years. They deserve the highest praise.
Meanwhile, a paperback selection (at the very least) should be published
forthwith.

Envoy rebuked
in China row
THE Foreign Office summoned the Chinese charge d'affaires yesterday after a
senior Chinese official accused Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten of behaving
like a ``big dictator''.
Wang Qiliang was told that the comments by Chen Zuo'er, a Chinese
representative on the Hong Kong Joint Liaison Group, were ``unacceptable'',
particularly as the handover of the colony to China is only 18 months away.
Volcano threat
PLYMOUTH: Montserrat's Governor Frank Savage has declared a state of emergency
and ordered a second evacuation of thousands of residents as the Caribbean
island's volcano, Chances Peak, rumbled anew. The volcano roared to life in
July and forced half the island's 11,000 residents to flee a month later.
Guevara found
VALLEGRANDE: Bolivian authorities believe they have found the burial site of
legendary leftist revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara, 28 years after the
military killed him. The remains will be exhumed and given a Roman Catholic
burial.
15 held in raid
BUENOS AIRES: Authorities raided Argentina's largest military barracks and
arrested 15 people, including several soldiers, in connection with last year's
attack on a Jewish cultural centre that killed 86 people.
Leader `stable'
ATHENS: Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou remained in stable condition on
life support machines in hospital yesterday.
Malan in court
DURBAN: Former South African Defence Minister Magnus Malan and 19 other
officers appeared in court yesterday to hear an indictment accusing them of
plotting operations against the ANC and its supporters in the 1980s. The 20 are
to stand trial in March in the massacre of 13 people in 1987.
Body found
VERONA: Italian police investigating a ``House of Horror'' case have found a
third female corpse in the grounds of an abandoned villa linked to Gianfranco
Stevanin, a 35-year-old farmer convicted of sexual assault.
Ship in peril
HALIFAX: A Maltese freighter with 29 people aboard was listing badly and in
danger of breaking up in gale-force winds 890 nautical miles off the coast of
Nova Scotia last night. The Canadian navy frigate Calgary was heading for the
Mount Olympus in the hope that a rescue helicopter could airlift the crew to
safety.
Charge dropped
MONTREAL: French singer and actress Vanessa Paradis, 22, who was arrested at
Montreal's airport in February, has had hashish possession charges against her
dropped ahead of a scheduled trial.
Stone steps in
UNITED NATIONS: Film star Sharon Stone yesterday replaced Elizabeth Taylor as
chief fund-raiser for the American Foundation for Aids Research. Stone, who
will be asked to raise $76m (#50m) over four years, told reporters: ``This
sounds like an awful lot of money until you realise that one movie may cost
$50m.''
Teenager cured
CHARLOTTESVILLE: A British boy who holds the world record for receiving
get-well cards - he reckons about 200 million of them - has been declared cured
of a brain cancer which doctors originally said was inoperable. ``I feel great,
fantastic,'' said 16-year-old Craig Shergold, who had an egg-sized tumour
removed from his brain by a Virginia surgeon in March 1991.

WAYNE McCullough brings his world crown home to Ireland tonight - and can
increase the clamour for a showdown with ``Prince'' Naseem Hamed.
The WBC bantamweight champion's three-fight deal worth more than #700,000 with
ITV will increase the public's awareness of him, starting with his first title
defence against unbeaten Dane Johnny Bredahl in the special big-fight
atmosphere of the King's Hall, Belfast.
If the non-stop Ulsterman hits peak form against Bredahl - a former WBO
super-flyweight champion - there will be more talk of a Hamed fight, especially
as McCullough is thinking of moving up two more categories to featherweight,
the same division.
McCullough said: ``I'd like to shut Hamed up for once and for good. He hasn't
fought anybody; let him fight somebody first.
``The fact is he's unknown in America and I think that makes him jealous. I'm
popular over there and here.''
After winning the silver medal in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, McCullough moved
to the States under the managership of Matt Tinley, a Denver-based television
executive - and the 25-year-old from the Shankill Road journeyed to Japan in
July to win his title the hard way.
Meanwhile, McCullough was shocked when his American boxing mate, Justo Sanchez,
due to meet Belfast's Paul Ireland, had to withdraw from his scheduled fight
with Paul Ireland because of a mugging incident.

THE bride is drunk. Very drunk. She giggles her way through the vows, and on
her way to sign the marriage schedule sprawls all her length on the chancel
steps. What should the clergyman do? He has just read a passage in which he
declared that marriage is ``not to be entered lightly or inadvisedly but
thoughtfully, reverently . . .'' That clearly is not the case in this instance.
Is the bride sober enough to be responsible for her answers? And who is to
decide - in the absence of a Breathalyser in the vestry?
These are not simply hypothetical questions. The incident described actually
occurred recently within a church in the West of Scotland. Certainly the
incident is not unique (although it is usually the bridgroom who is the worse
for wear).
On hearing the story of the tipsy bride I asked a group of senior Kirk clerics
what they would have done. Would they have called the wedding off? Certainly
not, replied my first sage, who has hundreds of weddings (and wedding meals)
under his belt and is the minister of one of the big surburban charges.
``Would you take the responsibility of telling the relatives that they had to
send everyone home and cancel the reception?''
What about the charge of marrying while under the influence of drink?
``Not your problem. I take the view that once the marriage schedule has been
issued by the Registrar the wedding has been legally sanctioned. As long as it
doesn't turn into a mockery you have done your duty in blessing it.''
At this my second sage, who has been involved in more legal wrangles than most
people have had steak-pie dinners, grew restive. ``Notwithstanding this,'' he
began, showing his legal background, ``if there is a subsequent legal challenge
to the marriage - that it was undertaken while not of sound mind, you're on a
sticky wicket, especially if you had evidence of that in front of you.''
However, to demonstrate that he did not always follow this counsel himself, he
followed this ruling with a number of amazing tales of marriages he had
conducted 50 years ago.
I was left without a definite answer to my question and hoping fervently that
the situation never came my way. The fact that the problem arises in the first
place is a consequence of the role that the Kirk plays as a national church.
Its ministers are pledged to marry and baptise those who live within the parish
in which they serve, and once they have opened their church doors, all sorts of
people may enter therein. That is why the fuss this week about the report of
the Church of England on co-habitation is not simply an instance of the church
moralising from a distance about those who have little to do with them. This is
a real issue both for the churches and for society.
Many of the couples who present themselves to book their church wedding are
already living together and/or one (or both) has been divorced. This presents
ministers with several choices, and the wide and contradictory way in which
they make them has created a very real dilemma.
One response is to welcome the couple, perhaps encourage them to become
attached to the church and even become members. The fact that they share the
same address is glossed over. After all, it is what they are promising in the
future that is to be blessed, not anything that has gone before. As for the
divorce, Protestant marriage is not technically a sacrament and therefore the
covenant which is to be made is not invalidating anything which went before,
only recognising that the previous covenant has failed and hoping for a lasting
one.
The alternative is to refuse the wedding or to impose conditions (such as one
partner moving out until the wedding). This might be accompanied by probing
questions about the sleeping arrangements or whether the bride is a virgin. You
think I'm making this up? Well I'm sorry to say that several of my colleagues
in the Glasgow area are adopting this kind of attitude. One even offers a
second-class wedding service for non-virgins. Others point blank refuse if the
couple, although resident in the parish, are not members of their church (which
is contrary to Kirk regulations, but most who take this stance can usually cite
conscientious objection, which is allowed in the case of remarrying divorcees).
If I thought it might shame my colleagues into a more tolerant attitude I would
name them and their parishes, but it would only distract for the real issue -
that there are now diverse and contradictory views within our churches on
divorce and co-habitation. It is too easy to polarise them into fundamentalist
and liberal. Those who think the Catholic position is clear on this question
should also think again. Their very clarity and orthodoxy is - as is so often
the case with fundamentalists (both Catholic and Protestant) - lacking in
kindness and compassion. As for church reports on this question, they help
clarify the issue but they should be noted, not voted. That way lies sectarian
sacraments - only avalailable to those who say the right creed, sleep in the
right bed, and don't have a bad marriage behind them.
Pastoral problems, as my sages illustrated, are often best dealt with by a
mixture of compassion and common sense. You can call that a ``fudge'' if you
like, but if a fudge can bring peace in Ireland, it must surely have God on its
side.

A NIP AROUND THE WORLD: Malcolm Greenwood, Argyll, #7.99.
MAKE YOUR OWN SCOTCH WHISKY: Adam Bergius, Argyll, #7.99
PAPERBACKS
Up North: Travels Beyond the Watford Gap, Charles Jennings, Abacus, #6.99.
ALTHOUGH it's impossible to love a travel writer who doesn't love Blackpool,
and difficult to take seriously a cosmopolitan sophisticate who says he
couldn't live anywhere but the suburbs of London, Charles Jennings's engagingly
written and cheerfully abusive tour of the land of whippets and brown ale is a
droll and cheeky read.
His knockabout insults are defused by their wild exaggeration of stereotypes
and his evident fondness for the innocently ludicrous (it made my day to know
that there's a Sooty Museum at Shipley, near Bradford). All very unfair, of
course, but what's funny that isn't? Last (aggrieved) word goes to Blackpool's
director of tourism: What on earth did he expect a town like Blackpool to smell
like?
Cycle Of Violence, Colin Bateman, Harper Collins, #4.99.
NOT since Evelyn Waugh's Scoop has there been as good a novel about a
journalist as this insouciant black comedy-thriller of the Troubles, written by
a young man who rejoices in the noble title of deputy editor of the County Down
Spectator and shares with Flann O'Brien a keen interest in the comic potential
of the bicycle. His hero is Miller, a too-smart young hack exiled from the
safety of Belfast to bandit country and the Crossmyheart Chronicle, where he
proceeds to get into more trouble than you can shake an Armalite at. Apart from
the ceasefire, this is the best thing out of Ulster for years.
Brando, Peter Manso, Orion, #8.99.
ELEVEN hundred pages, distilled out of 750 interviews, may just smack slightly
of overkill for the biography of a film star. As a document of the movie biz
and its mores from the 1950s to the 1980s, however, it's intriguing in moderate
doses, stuffed with more scandal than Kenneth Anger's Hollywood Babylon, and
Marlon Brando emerges almost incidentally as one of the great sacred monsters
of Hollywood.
Scottish Dates, Brian D Osborne and Ronald Armstrong, Birlinn, #6.99. Scottish
Proverbs Colin S K Walker, Birlinn, #5.99. Scottish Customs, Sheila
Livingstone, Birlinn, #6.99.
LEFT by your bedside for a month or two and subjected to regular offhand
dipping, these excellent little books will gradually and painlessly furnish
your mind with a useful quantity of the lore, language, and history of Scotland
- which is something a Scottish school education never did for most of us.
Sheila Livingstone's Scottish Customs, a treasury of folkways linked to all
aspects and occasions of life, is particularly evocative, reminding the reader
of the few old customs that still survive and the many that only very recently
faded away.
The Guinness Encyclopaedia of Television, Jeff Evans (ed), Guinness, #14.99.
PUFFED as a reference book but really aimed at TV trivia fans, this is the kind
of book that its purchasers will look up from every couple of minutes to regale
their helpless partners with a fascinating remark like ``Here! Did you know
there used to be three Cartwright brothers in Bonanza?''

WATCH out, here it comes! After record-breaking summer '95, the most inclement
months of the year have finally arrived - a time of howling winds, horizontal
rain, and ``crunch, slither, slip'' on ice-bound roads from Lerwick to Berwick.
When the shivers hit San Andreas proportions in January, the realisation should
have finally soaked in, writes PAUL WELSH.
Short of boarding the first steamer  for Panama and forgetting Scotland from
November to April, this is a heavyweight contest that always goes the full
distance. It is Us versus Winter again, and like any fight, tactics are
essential if you want to survive the contest intact. Throwing your hands in the
air and cursing this particular season is not good enough - it will land the
punches anyway.
Read on, then, and defend yourself.
STEP 1
Performing Ablutions
n A plunge in the Kelvin might work, but without an ice-bound loch it is hard
to appreciate the full impact of a sauna in winter. On a weekly basis, however,
saunas help to keep you healthy, and a level of Scandinavian rigour can be
attained using a cold shower. As long as high blood pressure is not a problem,
go and sweat.
Saunas stimulate the immune system (something you will hear about) and, if
rheumatism or arthritis are unwelcome visitors during winter, a session at the
local leisure centre should help to chase them away as well. For those who have
never tried one, imagine a mini tropical paradise that can cost less than #3
per hour. Now imagine a typical day in February. . . enough said.
n Allander Sports Centre, Glasgow - 0141 942 2233 (#2.90 per hour, swim
included); Perth Leisure Pool - 01738 635454 (#4 per hour, swim included,
reopening mid-December); Commonwealth Pool, Edinburgh - 0131 667 7211 (#5.60
for maximum of two hours, no swim).
STEP 2
Choosing Underwear
n Standing in your birthday suit, your body will feel relaxed and invigorated
after a sauna. You will be positively glowing with good health, so if you want
to stay that way, think ``warm layer close to the skin'' before getting
dressed. Call me old-fashioned, but wearing a pair of long johns is the single
major difference between smiling and grimacing all the way to next summer; and
here, at least, the wearer has some tactical options. Sparks will fly with
top-of-the-range Damart - long-lasting, toasty-hot, but man-made - whereas
Marks and Spencer do a fine cotton line - cosy, comfortable but liable to leave
you looking like a nineteenth-century gold prospector. After intensive use, the
crotch will head for the knee, the knee for the ankle, and all elastics will
declare unilateral independence. But the best thermals of all are army surplus.
Cheap and rugged, find a rare wool mix and you will absolutely never go to war
(or is that work?) chilly.
n Damart Thermawear - 0141 332 2586 (ladies from #12.99, men from #16.99);
Marks &amp; Spencer - 0141 552 4546 (ladies from #9, men from #10); Army surplus -
0141 337 2550 (unisex cotton mix from #1.50)
STEP 3
Wrapping Up
n To declare a wind and waterproof outer-shell essential from now till the
Scottish Cup Final is worse than stating the obvious - it is rubbing salt in a
frost-bitten wound. Nevertheless, it might stop some people going out
underpressed and under-gunned in midwinter. Cappuccinos and croissants may
induce a continental spirit in Princes Square, but that wind-tunnel also known
as Buchanan Street will quickly disperse the feeling in March. Button-up before
leaving any building, or body heat will be replaced by an unforgiving arctic
jet stream. From that point on, common sense should prevail. Hat, gloves, and a
chest/throat-protecting scarf are de rigueur (thermal insoles would be also, if
imagination could only stretch that far). It may sound like the kit-list for an
OAP coach excursion, but the experience of 65 winters soon puts fashion sense
where it belongs; out in the cold.
STEP 4
Eating well (or not, as the case may be)
n Regardless of clothing, every wizened parent still swears by one fundamental
maxim: you are what you eat. Unfortunately, Christmas and New Year are often an
excuse for eating and drinking too much. For many, the rest of winter is spent
covering up the depressing result with over-size woolly jumpers and old jogging
pants. Pampering that constant winter companion, comfort eating, will not
preserve your hour-glass shape or honed physique but plenty of fresh fruit and
vegetables will. Up your carbohydrate intake with pasta, potatoes, etc, if you
feel cold. Avoid fatty foods as ever. This will curb some of the food-related
winter blues, and, although many of the survival steps encourage an appetite,
that is OK. Burn-up energy with exercise, not brooding over unwanted weight.
STEP 5
Swallowing Supplements
n Remember, a continental breakfast doesn't do anything for a cold but vitamin
C will. Take the case of Dr Linus Pauling, the Nobel prize-winner in Medicine.
He died recently but not for lack of this supplement, because he swore by it.
Pauling advocated a level of consumption which exceeds government
recommendations by over 1000%, and developed a mega-dose regime of vitamin C
that apparently counters severe ailments including cancer. A vastly increased
resistance to the common cold, flu, etc, is also possible using the same
tactic. A dose of between one and three grams per day is reasonable but have no
fear about quantity, it is impossible to overdose on vitamin C. Things can get
a little loose down below, though, so if they do, cut down to bowel tolerance
because you have had quite enough.
Combined with vitamin B - the great stress buster - the effect of vitamin C is
further enhanced, and apocryphal stories abound regarding these vitamins'
life-enhancing properties. Both are widely available.
STEP 6
Staying Happy
n Are you sad or what? Yes, Glasgow parlance is rough, but Seasonal Affected
Disorder (SAD) is always rougher. C
n SAD Helpline - 0800 45 43 45; Full-Spectrum Lighting - 0141 944 2647
STEP 7
Exercising The Body
n They say: ``Winter does not rot in the sky!'' But you might, if you don't
flex your muscles now and again. In fact, a minimum of two or three times a
week for 20 minutes, according to Nicola Forrest-Brawley, ex-British champion
mogul-skier and now a lecturer in health and fitness in Glasgow. If you want to
cover all the bases, ie stretching, the cardiovascular system (heart and
lungs), and muscular strength/endurance, an exercise regime of 25-plus sit-ups,
press-ups, and squats per day is a start for enthusiastic men and women.
``This will help maintain good body compostion,'' says Forrest-Brawley, ``and
sustain summertime fitness levels.'' An additional bonus is the buzz of
endorphins, the natural opiate released into the bloodstream during exercise.
The potential for a healthy addiction is there, and these hormones also
neutralise pent-up aggression, tension, and the ``winter blues''. If you want
to feel good and stay on the right side of the law, start by touching your toes.
STEP 8
Exercising The Mind
n Some folk deny they have a body. Some folk deny they have a mind. In both
cases, the results are usually far from attractive. But don't worry, winter is
the perfect time to do something about brain fitness as well. Blown back
indoors, Scots are left with plenty of time to read interesting books, learn a
second language, ditto musical instrument, or write a story. In fact, do
whatever takes their intellectual fancy.
A holistic view of human life rates creativity right up there with vitamins and
regular physical exercise, and it has been shown that active use of the brain
helps to slow its physical degeneration in older people. Bucking the winter
trend of limited mental activity also has its social rewards. Next summer's
trip to Spain will be enhanced by a regular language class during the winter.
Pick up a guitar at the same time, and you could serenade a potential lover
with the poetry of Lorca. As you stroll through Granada discussing the finer
points of Moorish architecture, the personal reward for visiting Partick
Library in December could be more abundant than the orange groves of Andalucia.
STEP 9
Scaling The Heights
n Winter sports have annoyed people for years. Groan at ``bare-your-chest and
howl'' climbers flawed by gaudy colours, gizmos, and real ale. Guffaw at the
body-hugging jumpsuits of hopeless skiers piste-bound by social obligation
rather than inclination. Grimace with Captain Courageous as he is winched to
safety in a force nine gale. Yes, they all deserve to be gently knocked, but
there is one thing that cannot be denied. They have all turned the tables on
winter, harnessing wind, snow, and ice for excitement and pleasure, as each
weekend blast of do-or-die adventure carries them through the dull days (and
nights) that stretch till spring. Be careful, of course, but get out there and
try one nevertheless. What could compete with that heady mix of adrenalin and a
savage, elemental world?
STEP 10
Supping Ancient Brews (of course)
n Winter is synonymous with feelings of fatigue, low energy, and sluggishness,
all signs of a body conserving heat by slowing down blood circulation.
Unfortunately, this lowers our natural immunity to coughs and colds, so a
downward spiral of infection and tiredness is also possible.
For centuries, our wily ancestors have experimented with herbs and plants that
tackle this problem, and many of their tonics and natural medicines are still
available today. Taken in tincture form (a teaspoonful a day), the herb
Echinacea increases the body's immunity and, according to Jackie Hazzard of
Napiers Medical Herbalists, ``it makes people feel vital, energised and
alive''. This is the number-one herbal response to winter, but combinations of
ginger, cloves, thyme, cinnamon, and chilli in remedies such as Napiers
Composition Essence and Remedy No 7, will also chase away respiratory problems
and warm cold hands and feet by increasing the rate of circulation and
generating a feeling of warmth. Although herbal medicines work for all, they
are especially effective with older people of low mobility.

Siobhan Redmond - actress tells ANN DONALD about her nighttime reading
n I'M a bit of a fiend for the printed word. I'm always buying books,
newspapers and magazines. In fact in the boot of my very old Volkswagen Beetle
I still have bundles of old Vogue magazines that I can't bear to throw out. I
don't read them, just look at the pictures. Very occasionally I'll read the New
Yorker because I've never been to New York and I'd like to go, but the nearest
I get to it is buying the New Yorker and having a bagel.
I've also just read Deborah Tannen's book You Just Don't Understand which is
about the conversational differences between men and women and what really
underlies the text. Obviously I can't precis the book for you as Tannen is a
highly intelligent woman who has managed to write a whole book about it so I
can't sum her up in a few sentences.
I do like short stories and I find them perfect for times such as when I'm
rehearsing and I don't have a lot of time at my disposal. I've just finished
Alice Munro's latest book Open Secrets which is wonderful. I promised myself
I'd learn 10 pages of lines then read one short story but they're so morish
that I gorged to bits on them.
I'm also leafing through anything with kitchens in them as I've just moved
house. The trouble is I'm spending so much money on buying the magazines that
I'll never have enough money left to buy the kitchen stuff. I'll probably end
up papering the walls with cuttings instead.

THE working prostitute has a degree in hypocrisy, the man who pays her can also
preach against her, and it happens. But if you cannot understand the need for
prostitution then you don't understand sex.
If a man sleeps with a woman who is willing, he can kid himself he's not using
her, but if money changes hands he can't. Men are at their most honest when
they kerb-crawl. It is more cost-effective to buy the services of a prostitute,
than it is to wine and dine a hopeful. As one male source put it, at the end of
the night, a date might say no.
The prostitute triggers different reactions in both sexes. Some women hate her
because she supplies cold what they need to be warmed up for hours to do. Other
women secretly admire her, because she makes men pay for what is provided for
free in a relationship or in the name of a one-night stand. Straight, honest
payment is more respectful a response than the token promise of love and
affection. A man, however, does not hate the prostitute, he can't dislike what
is available to accommodate his desire. Men and prostitutes are in league with
each other. And women know it.
Sex is supposed to be romantic, an expression of emotion rather than a quirk of
market forces. If you sell it you're turning pink-rosed connotations around and
dumping on them. But the prostitute's clients remain uncriticised. This
illustrates the prejudice society has. Blaming a prostitute for providing sex
that people buy is like blaming a baker for making people fat.
There is, although many would not admit it, a huge element of free will in
prostitution. You don't have to sell your body and no-one has to buy it. Like
men, prostitutes can disassociate sex from emotion. To some this seems
merciless, but it is not morally wrong.
Edinburgh has many prostitutes, and their health and welfare, and that of their
clients, is kept under a semblance of control by Scot-pep, a society set up and
run by working and ex-prostitutes. Project workers supply condoms, HIV
counselling, talk to the girls about welfare rights and give them legal advice.
The aim of Scot-pep, subsidised by Lothian Health Board, is to ``promote health
and dignity in prostitution by empowerment, support and peer and client
education''.
The group recently took part in a European Symposium on health in the sex
industry. Other ``twinset and pearls'' societies which aim to ``help'' working
girls, have God on their side, which is nice but somewhat impractical, their
purpose to convince women to abandon their ``wicked ways''.
Rose is 39 and has been working for five years, as has Amanda, 23, a single
parent, currently on what she jokingly refers to as ``maternity-leave''.
Jennifer, 35, (not her real name) has worked on and off for 15 years. She is
sonsie, smiling and assertive, with a face from the past. She's the snub-nosed
madam in a Toulouse-Lautrec poster, with a mothering chest.
Amanda looks much more contemporary with a nose-ring, black DMs and T-shirt,
but Rose looks as if she's had a harder time. If Jennifer represents the
gallusness of the oldest profession in the world, then Rose represents its
distress. The women say it's amazing how many ``brain surgeons with brickie's
hands'' pick them up, how many 20-stone footballers. Some guys who pay to have
sex with a prostitute want her to enjoy it. ``I had my first orgasm with a
client,'' says Amanda. Jennifer adds: ``You get some very talented men.''
If you remove subjective opinions about the morality of prostitution then she
is allowed not to be a victim, but a businesswoman. And her clients are allowed
to be well-balanced husbands and fathers, not raging psychos. But some might
prefer the prostitute and the client to make a tragic case, for if using a
prostitute is regarded as normal, rather than a perversion, then there is no
reason of principle for soliciting to be illegal, and the bellowing moral
guardian is stumped.
The insistence to portray the prostitute as victim is a convenient mechanism to
avoid the truth that some of the women enjoy their job. Amanda comments that
it's nice to work in a situation where you can have a laugh with your
colleagues. Compare working long shifts in a factory to make up a decent wage
and you find out why women sell sex. You are untaxed and self-employed, you
have a control over your hours not afforded to wage slaves, and there is no
ageist glass-ceiling. Unlike food or pieces of technology, nothing can replace
the demand for sex.
Some female prostitutes, however, only earn enough to pay the bills. The
``Quarterly Group,'' as professional prostitutes call them, are women who take
to the streets every three months when the gas, telephone and electricity bills
come in. Whenever Edinburgh is injected with disposable income during the
Festival, the Tattoo or any political or religious conference, there's work.
There is also a constant support of local clients who prefer to come out in the
dark. It's not worth starting on the streets before 9.30pm in the summer, or
6pm during the winter.
To be specific, prostitution itself is not illegal in Scotland, but soliciting
- that is, loitering with intent - is. Interestingly, here, pimps are
non-existent. ``This is a matriarchal society,'' says Jennifer, ``and Scottish
women don't bend to the will of men.''
Some might say that prostitution is synonymous with the abuse of women, that's
why it's so hard for a prostitute to file for rape. ``I really do believe that
prostitutes prevent a portion of sexual offences,'' insists Jennifer. ``If you
can pay for sexual favours then you won't abuse somebody.'' So a man will
assault if he's broke? Prostitutes say, by way of illustration of their theory
that all men are potential rapists, that they get every profession and class,
but the common denominator is probably sexual immaturity. In Hollywood, as the
arrest of Heidi Fleiss exposed, groupies are so easy, that paying for it is the
only way a rich, famous guy can get his kicks. Sometimes prostitution is not a
social service, but an outlet for sexual hedonism. What prostitutes really do,
is help other relationships along. They are paid mistresses.
``Prostitutes are the best actresses in the world,'' says Rose. She claims a
hundred different roles, from sex therapist, to nurse, to psychiatrist, but she
says nothing about the abuse of an innocent victim having more to do with the
pursuit of power. Talk about abuse and the subject of S&amp;M is raised, quite
naively. Sado-masochism is theatre between adults, mere titillation. If a man
wants to rape he will.
``If you have someone who wants to pay a lot of money for you to take the belt,
you lay down rules,'' says Jennifer. ``My life isn't worth an extra #20. You
agree on a cut-off word and the activity ceases. Clients know the rules and
abide by them. A lot of people think that who pays the piper calls the tune,
but you are in control.''
In Scotland you need two witnesses to corroborate that you are actually
committing an offence by loitering with intent. After a third caution you go to
court for a #40 fine. Rose, Amanda and Jennifer say they've never had any
trouble with the Scottish police. It's more of a hassle to be a prostitute down
south, they say, as you only need one witness for a conviction, and determinant
on how many condoms you have on you, the law can insist that you are soliciting.
The media fuss over the recent granting of licenses to several saunas is
unwarranted. Apres Debra Scanlon, the Leith woman who won a battle to prevent a
sauna opening near her home, Edinburgh's prostitutes feared that licences would
be revoked, leaving 200 women on the streets. But the first sauna licence was
granted 17 years ago. Prostitution will carry on regardless of legislation, an
underground organisation run mostly by women, who have to look out and after
themselves.
``The majority of clients are trustworthy,'' says Rose, ``but you don't know
how drunk a client is until you're already in the car. The worst I've ever had
is someone asking for their money back.'' Little things hurt, such as small
boys, maybe punters of the future, throwing eggs, and passers-by spitting on
you.
Prostitutes carry mobile phones or ask clients if they can take down their
number plate. When I ask the three how much they earn, one of their pals looks
at me and says: ``More than you.'' In terms of being a professional, she's
convinced a prostitute earns more.
A girl in a sauna earns the same as the girl on the street, but in a sauna you
have to pay desk money or ``rent'', and this is a consistent percentage figure
of what you earn. Rose prefers working the street, regardless of the danger,
because she wants every penny she earns to be hers. But she curses the fact she
has to take clients to dark alleys. Jennifer prefers the sauna, saying:
``You're a bolt away from help''. They all agree, that by working in a sauna
you can disguise the job better, because you work shifts, the way you would in
McDonald's.
In a sauna, the minimum charge is #25, on the streets, #20. All three women
went into prostitution for the money. ``I was doing cleaning jobs, the DSS
found out and I had to pay them #500. I was living on #36 a week, I couldn't do
it,'' says Rose; Amanda was caught out when the Government withdrew benefits
for 16 and 17-year-olds; Jennifer was working as a lab technician when she
encountered financial problems. ``You can make a very healthy living out of
prostitution,'' she says. ``If you work every day you earn #30,000 to #40,000 a
year. You get used to the standard of living, when you stop work it's difficult
to adjust.''
Prostitution is a mindset. Jennifer, for example, has had trouble with her car
this morning. The discussion turns to how much it will cost her to fix it.
``Two punters,'' she says. Fifty quid.
It is impossible to gauge the number of men who use Edinburgh's prostitutes.
Jennifer asks me to multiply three punters a night over five years, times the
number of women working in what they charmingly call the ``outdoor industry''.
``There is no such thing as a standard client,'' says Jennifer, ``human beings
are very complicated. Some relationships are sad, people who have been together
for a long time and who can't experiment sexually, and the man can't ask for
what he wants because the woman can't hear him. I have a regular, middle-aged
client, and the only reason he comes to me is because his wife won't give him
oral sex and he enjoys it. He tells me that a man has two choices; to go with a
prostitute or have an affair. The woman involved might tell the wife, but the
prostitute won't.''
There is an underlying contempt for women who are sexually inhibited. The three
prostitutes I interviewed, seemed genuinely disgusted at the fact that men had
to come to them at all. In their world, they provide a sexual menu because the
person the man really wants to be with, isn't co-operating.
``Sometimes you get widowers, sometimes clients just want a cuddle, some miss
physical contact with a woman,'' Jennifer adds.
Although 35, she advertises herself as 40. ``Some men prefer a younger lassie
because that's their fantasy; some men look for an older woman who knows where
she's at and doesn't have any hang-ups.''
It may seem daft, but I ask what qualities you need to be a prostitute.
Everyone howls with laughter. ``Do not be a virgin,'' screeches Rose. ``Wait a
minute, you'd get quite a lot of money for that!'' shouts Jennifer. ``Aye,''
Rose retorts, ``but you could only sell it the once.'' They're chewing the sofa
in merriment.
``It's a job you can or can't do,'' says Jennifer, when it calms, ``it's about
attitude. You have to put up with bullshit, and be sympathetic and patient.''
``Prostitutes do not receive much understanding,'' says Rose. ``But we are very
tolerant. What we don't like to take, we don't like to dish out.'' Jennifer,
Rose and Amanda say they are actresses, but they have no pretence. Just the
compassion any underdog has for downtrodden others, a category which they
believe includes frustrated men.

q MASSACHUSSETTS-born tenor saxophonist Flanagan and pianist, vocalist and Mojo
scribe Ingham wear their influences on their sleeves, Flanagan's being fifties
Sonny Rollins and Zoot Sims; Ingham's Mose Allison and Mark Murphy. Together
they create a selection of cool and tidy hard bop and dispassionate, resigned
balladry. Producer Adrian Utley, of Portishead, contributes some fine jazz
guitar on one track and should any of his or any other non-jazz fans fancy
taking a chance, they'll find the other nine tracks easily accessible too.
The Bright Field, Paul Machlis (Culburnie)
q HEAVY hints of Micheal O Suilleabhain here: folk melodies merged with
classical voicings and arrangements; and lots of clear, rippling piano work
courtesy of Machlis, the Californian who recorded the memorable Skyedance with
fiddler Alasdair Fraser in 1986. Fraser again contributes some typically grainy
lines but the overall ambience leans further towards craft-shop-friendly
California dreaminess than true Celtic grit.

q WILL is the effortless master of the creamy-smooth love-groove, and we relax
into the mellifluous folds of his voice. He can be readily located somewhere
between old-time cocktail-jazz and nu-style R&amp;B, in a penthouse suite adjacent
to those occupied by Barry White and George Benson. Will Downing croons
butterily, like a butterfly with satin wings. Yeah, as you might have guessed,
we like Will Downing at Belcher Towers. Even when his songs are a bit on the
bland side. Like they are here. Drat it.
Your Little Secret, Melissa Etheridge (Island)
q MS Etheridge's slow, subversive ascent to all-American post-grunge rock
superstardom takes a nasty turn as she mutates into Bryan Adams. Strained vox;
ploddy drums; cliched gewtar.
Mixmag Live Volume 20, Richie Hawtin (DMC)
q STEP it out this way for yon driving, mutated electronic soundscapes, chuck.
If you missed Richie Hawtin guest-starring with the Slam laddies into the early
hours of the morning in Glasgow, you'll be able to sample his sonic sculptures
in the privy of your own home early in the new year upon the release of this
seamless 22-track, 56 minute set recorded on Hawtin's home nightclubbing turf
in Windsor, Ontario. As well as a couple of blasts created by young Hawtin
under his Plastikman alter ego, you get a wheen of politely uninsistent techno
recorded by sundry chaps for the Ferox label. Ah me; after hip hop, trip hop,
and loop bop, how about a spot of nimble, fleet-footed skip lope?
Trance Atlantic 2, Various (Trance Atlantic)
q A FURTHER instalment of digitalised transatlantic trance-ambience from the
folk behind the Volume compilation series, which means that in addition to two
75-minute CDs, you get a fat, glossy, full-colour CD-sized brochure explaining
exactly where in the US of A all these plangent sound-washes and percussive
pumpings are coming from. From suburban bedrooms in towns and cities coast to
coast, actually, wherein computer-literate young music-boffins are having fun
igoring all the rules.
Essential Mix: Tong, Cox, Sasha, Oakenfold, Various (ffrr)
q DJ superstars Tong (Pete), Cox (Carl), Oakenfold (Paul) and Sasha (just
Sasha, OK?) offer propulsive insights into the healthily diverse state of this
nation's dancefloors. Radio 1 top dog Tong favours songs (eg Kelli Rich's
Hide-A-Way); clubland favourite Cox opts for a harder-edged, more relentless
groove, courtesy of such dancemeisters as Laurent Garnier and Dave Clarke.
Sasha prefers squittery bloops; Mr Oakenfold revisits the scenes of old crimes
with Utah Saints and the Prodigy. All in all, a moderately good time is had.

q IT has been clear for many years, to those who have heard her music in
concert, that Aberdeen-born Judith Weir is one of the most individual and
distinctive composers around.
There is a compact quality to her language, technique and style; and a ready
accessibility. Weir's is a pared-down music, no excess baggage, entirely
fat-free. Now, for the first time, in a collection of her chamber works, there
is an opportunity to assess and survey that style at breadth.
Performed by two groups that have tirelessly championed her music - Domus, and
the Schubert Ensemble of London - this is a superb collection, containing a
broad range of Weir's music, from the stellar piano work, The Art of Touching
the Keyboard, to the instrumental mini-opera, The Bagpiper's String Trio.
Prince of the collection, which also includes the atmospheric El Rey de Francia
and Ardnamurchan Point, is the masterpiece, Distance and Enchantment, inspired
by Brahms, and a wondrously evocative piece in its own right as well as a
compendium of Weir's techniques, from mind-boggling echo effects to soaring
lyricism.

IT frequently happens that jazz musicians become trapped within their chosen
style, still able to improvise of course, but limited to a stylistic approach
or a repertoire of songs with which the public associate them.
In his touring years with the All Stars even the majestic Louis Armstrong
produced a set menu of tunes night after night, rarely changing them because
the trumpeter believed he knew what his public wanted.
Duke Ellington was lumbered with the ``medley'', that group of his most famous
tunes which he ran through thousands of times on tour after tour.
Similarly, the pianist Ralph Sutton, was long identified with Fats Waller who
was his inspiration and a major influence on his playing. But in recent years
Sutton has been playing with a new authority, breaking free of the programme
which had become overly familiar even to his most devoted followers.
Waller songs still form a part of any of his sets and he remains the finest
interpreter of the impressionistic pieces written by Willie ``The Lion'' Smith
but Sutton has moved into other areas showing a new assertiveness and authority
as he does so.
Three CDs which have been issued in the past few months underline that trend
which was first demonstrated on a Sackville recording Live At the Cafe des
Copains where Sutton played such songs as Laugh Clown Laugh, Poor Butterfly,
This Is All I Ask, and Russian Lullaby among others.
On a follow-up to that recording Sackville have pieced together a second
helping from Sutton's Toronto appearances. And, once more, we hear the pianist
stretch out on Winter Weather, You Turned The Tables On Me, Willow Weep For Me,
I've Got a Crush On You and the wonderful Worryin' The Life Out of Me, written
by the trombonist Miff Mole.
On yet another Sackville offering Sutton renews his partnership with the
Australian trumpeter Bob Barnard. Using a Steinway Model D instrument Sutton is
at his very best.
The third CD finds Sutton teaming up with the Japanese trumpeter Yoshio Toyama
in a series of duets interrupted by a solo track from Sutton on Shine. Again
the programme is a varied one. There are certainly two from the Waller songbook
but otherwise the music is as varied and imaginative as on the other recordings.
There is Hoagy Carmichael's Lazy River, and Moonglow and One Hour. The two men
spark fresh ideas off each other and the results are fascinating and hugely
enjoyable.
At the time of writing, Ralph is playing a lengthy engagement in Berne before
moving on to Switzerland and then returning to his Colorado home just before
Christmas.
At the start of the year the grind of touring will begin again and, hopefully,
it will include a visit to Britain, and, more especially, a return to Glasgow.
Last summer he starred at Nairn demonstrating the newer facets of his work as
well as reworking the Lion's delicate but difficult pieces. A Glasgow
appearance sometime next year would confirm his stature for all of and redefine
his place in the jazz world's piano playhouse for his supporters in the city.
In the meantime the new CDs are available to underline the still growing
talents of the man from Hamburg, Missouri, who was discovered by Jack Teagarden
in the forties and who continues to travel the world proving that stride piano
is alive and well in his massive hands.

MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET
(retail, #14.99; also available to rent; cert U).
Desperate goodwill addicts such as Couch Potato, who likes to get a seasonal
fix around this time of year to put him in the mood for Christmas, are not
inclined to be too picky about the quality of their supply - as long as it's
not Dudley Moore in 1985's Santa Claus: The Movie, any one reel of which would
have made the reformed Scrooge sack Bob Cratchit and break up Tiny Tim's crutch
for firewood. Like realistic-minded children on Christmas morning, we take
what's under the tree with as grateful a heart as we can muster.
Which is just as well for the new Miracle On 34th Street, Les Mayfield's 1994
remake of George Seaton's 1947 Christmas classic. What's wrong with this is not
that it doesn't live up to the original - it really would be a miracle if it
did - but that it doesn't live up to its own tantalising possibilities.
On the credit side, Richard Attenborough gives a lovely performance, artfully
underplayed but wonderfully warm and gentle, as Kriss Kringle, the
department-store Santa who believes he's the real McClaus and ends up having to
prove it - both to a New York insanity hearing and to a little girl who wants
something very special for Christmas. Mara Wilson is both sweet and wholesome
as the little girl, and Dylan McDermott twinkles pleasantly against type as her
mum's boyfriend and Kriss's lawyer.
Elizabeth Perkins, contrariwise, is pretty flat as Momma - but we could ignore
that if it weren't for the general lack of zip and zing in direction,
photography, and editing; the corporate blandness of tone that discards the
original's sharp but genial satire; and the way the soundtrack neglects its
beautiful orchestral theme in favour of naff pop covers of Christmas standards.
Despite all that, the story and four solid performances - we forgot to mention
old-timer Sam Prosky as the Judge - just about save the day, and if you watch
this Miracle in the right spirit, it'll produce the desired effect. In the
spirit of Christmas, we'll give it two Ho!s out of three.
THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE (rental, cert PG).
Its title shortened by one word from the stage play - for fear that American
audiences would think it the third film in a series - Alan Bennett's witty and
sympathetic account of the mental, political, and familial light of the first
(but probably not the last) British monarch to talk to the trees makes an
agreeable but essentially uncinematic talk piece whose main purpose is as a
substitute for the play.
Nigel Hawthorne is heartbreakingly good as the king, seizing every opportunity
for pathos and barnstorming bravura, while Rupert Everett makes an almost too
convincing figure as that heartless fop, the Prince Regent; but purely as a
film, the production suffers from the British carriage-trade curse of gentility
and decorum.
This doesn't extend to the sleeve blurb, however, which reads ``The King was
all powerful and all knowing. But he wasn't quite all there.'' What are they
trying to sell us - Carry On Up The Nuthouse? If only Frankie Howerd and
Kenneth Williams were still here to play the King and Prinny . . . now, that
would be a movie.

CAN this really be the shy, retiring Glasgow suburb of Clarkston? Where are the
ubiquitous, nice, neat hedgerows, the orderly grey, paved garden paths, the
perfect window frames and all the other necessary architectural accoutrements
of suburban living? Why is it that instead of the collective utilitarian spirit
of DIY heaven, it is the collective magical spirit of Turkish Delight,
Tutenkhamun and Grimms' Fairy tales that is invoked by one peek over the garden
wall at a certain unsung designer craftsman's home/workshop?
The subversive in suburbia is Michael Gallacher. For here in ``conservative''
Clarkston, the 38-year-old amateur craftsman has endowed the art and
architecture of the area with more than a hint of Eastern promise and gothic
fantasy in products that vary from one-off interior design features and
cabinets to rocking horses and gigantic flying dolphins on rockers, all
hand-carved from wood.
One need only glance up the muddy path to the customised front door and sitting
room window to realise that here is a man who took those summer holiday trips
to Cyprus, Greece and Turkey that little bit further, in actually attempting to
reproduce back in Blighty the architectural wonders captured in holiday snaps.
The overhang of the window is composed of semi-circles of plate (hand-carved by
Gallacher) as one would see on Islamic temples, while the latticed wood door
frame recalls the window design of any conventional Eastern building.
It is only recently, however, that the self-effacing craftsman has ``gone
public and professional'' with his work, For the past 10 years he has worked in
the theatre at Ross Hall Hospital, with his craft skills taking a back seat.
Despite coming from an artistic lineage - his mother Nita Begg is a painter as
was his father William Gallacher, who also lectured in architecture at Glasgow
School of Art - the young Gallacher has never been formally trained, other than
a three-year Scotvec evening course in joinery and carpentry.
Sitting in the small front room swamped by two very adult-sized rocking
dolphins on one side of Gallacher's settee, and two traditional styled wooden
rocking horses on the other, he explains why it has taken nearly 20 years to
finally recognise his inherited artistic blood.
``Ever since I was a boy and given paints, pens and crayons I've loved making
things,'' he says with a grin. ``However, I think that I took my skills for
granted, in that I have learnt them subconsciously in the same way as being
able to see or walk and so I never really saw the advantage of formal
training.''
Although he opted for ``artistic civvy street'' rather than attend art college,
Gallacher continued to work away independently after hours. These projects
involved everything from renovating his father's former garret of a studio in
Sauchiehall Street into an imaginative and valuable house to building sunken
bathrooms for friends and one-off Arabic cabinets for work colleagues.
The influence of his deceased father is not only visible on the walls of
Gallacher's house, which almost disappear behind the series of vast
self-portraits that hang throughout the small house, but is obviously in his
son's latent enthusiasm for architecture. ``There were always my dad's
architectural drawings around the house when I was young,'' he recalls, ``and
I've always been the guy who wanders around Bath Street and West Regent Street
gazing at all the intricate architectural detail or running up closes to get a
better look at a particular carving.''
This enthusiasm is supplemented by an impressive library of architectural books
that echo his love of the Islamic style. ``I've got everything from World of
Interiors to imported American books on architecture and construction.
Everything in here,'' he says leafing through a particularly heavy tome, ``is
where I get my ideas from.'' That, of course, and the numerous scrapbooks of
hundreds of photographs he and his wife compile when they sojourn to places
like Cyprus and Turkey. ``Oh yeh, I definitely get a huge buzz out of seeing
these incredible tombs or stone labyrinths or columns and thinking `Right, that
will look really good in a sunken swimming pool or bath'.''
Expanding on his own personal taste, Gallacher is patently not a clean-cut
minimalist man. ``I have very strong opinions on styles and Minimalism or
Charles Rennie Mackintosh aren't really me at all,'' he states. ``I love that
whole image of fanciful that mixes the epic nature of films like Ben Hur with
the lost city of Atlantis!'' he grins broadly.
And it is fittingly in Gallacher's own bathroom / showroom where the ``epic
meets the watery''. This is clearly the designer craftsman's labour of love,
having devoted two years of his time and coupled his interior eye with
carpentry and joinery skills to fashion everything by hand. We enter what
appears to be a fourteenth - century Turkish bath chamber, replete with
eight-sided Islamic star carved into the former window frame, sunken bath,
soaring gold embossed pillars and perfectly replicated mini temple that doubles
as a bathroom cabinet.
Artistic licence and liberty have been thoroughly embraced with a scoot through
the centuries and styles, with one half of the room opting for the Turkish look
and the other half for the Egyptian.
The surprising influence for this original bathroom is slightly closer to home,
as Gallacher explains. ``It's actually inspired by the fantastic architecture
of the Acropolis, Glasgow,'' he says. ``It really is an architectural
historian's paradise because these Victorian bigshots built themselves
incredible tombs that were influenced by architectural styles from all over the
world.''
Gazing at his handiwork, Gallacher notes with a dissatisfied sigh that his
artistic vision is not appreciated by everyone. ``I think that people are a bit
wary of my style,'' he says, ``which is why I have to temper the `oddities'
like the temples and cabinets with the traditional crafts like dolphins and
rocking horses.''
With plans to go full-time into the designer craft business, Gallacher is
hoping that his ``oddities'' will appeal to those who don't run with the
conventional interior pack and who appreciate a hint of Eastern promise in
their household. Who knows, he may even succeed in transforming conservative
Clarkston into a hotbed of Turkish baths. Michael Gallacher can be contacted on
0141-644 2644.

AND then there was Dublin . . . a day like this is a rare occurrence, but when
it happens one day after the other then you know that times can change and that
humanity has already overtaken hatred.
Dublin's day with the Big Feller sought no competition with the Belfast or
Derry visits of President Clinton. Those momentous events truly broke new
ground, moving Northern Ireland closer to that moment in the Nobel poet Seamus
Heaney's dream when ``hope and harmony rhyme''.
The Republic's offering was a partnership in welcome for an extraordinary
peace-broker, a man who in one year of gambles in foreign policy has pulled off
the Arab-Israeli accord, the Bosnian peace agreement, and now is articulating
with such potency the ordinary people's desire for a settlement in Northern
Ireland. It cannot be disregarded by those who hesitate and see it as the
opportunism of an upstart outsider.
What President Clinton is doing is nudging the key political players, north,
south, and over the water, towards a permanent and stable peace, stripped of
triumphalism for anyone. To view his actions simply as an exercise in gathering
votes back home recklessly misreads the dynamics of what is happening.
Not since 1990 had Dublin's College Green been so thronged with bellowing good
nature as yesterday when the third American President to become a Freeman of
the city spoke of his pride in feeling like ``a real Dub''.
Five years ago Jack Charlton had delivered a similar message to 100,000 people
when he brought home the ``lads'' after the quarter-finals in Italy's World
Cup. Yesterday the lunchtime crowd reached 80,000 but for security reasons
space had been reduced since that sunny evening of Jacko's time on the
municipal podium.
In a day of salty air and pearly light the Bank of Ireland's eighteenth century
elegance was at its best. This was the site of the original Irish Parliament
and before its colonnades Bill Clinton, his voice strained now from three days
of garrulous diplomacy, reinforced his peace-making role with some of the
phrases we had heard before.
The reason was not idleness or lack of attention - this has been one of his
most eloquent journeys abroad - but merely because the essential message does
not alter: those who now take imaginative risks for peace will find America
morally, politically, and financially supportive: ``We want to walk together.''
But from his Northern visits he was clearly affected by the urgent aspirations
of the young. And in the Republic, too, where the majority of the population is
below the age of 35, his message again to any of those who remain reluctant to
seize the new momentum was this: ``I want more than anything for the young
people of Ireland, wherever they live on this island, to be able to grow up and
live out their dreams close to their roots in peace and honour and freedom and
equality.''
As is the way of presidential voyages yesterday's was wrapped around with
formalities and official functions: a trip down the formal corridors of
President Robinson's residence, an address to the Dail at Leinster House, and
finally a state banquet hosted by Taoiseach John Bruton at Dublin Castle.
And as this is a man of spontaneous walk-abouts and impromptu one-to-one
briefings, and this is Ireland, land of flexible time, everything ran late.
Added to this, Dublin's own irrepressible informality was in cracking form.
Glued to a classical pillar on College Green, was an emergency notice written
in a hasty hand: Whitehouse toilets, O'Neills's Pub round the corner.
On the matter of pubs President Clinton himself paid homage to that Dubliner
incarnate, the bar-fly, by visiting Cassidy's in Camden Street, the den where
the Special Branch drink and where market traders roar out the price of fruit
and vegetables on the pavement outside, their voices loud as America.
In the back snug the President raised a glass or two of the black stuff
(even-handedly, as ever on this trip, he sipped both Guinness and Murphy's)
with the Cassidy clan. Their ancestors were shared by his late mother, also a
gambler whom, he said, would have loved Ireland because ``you have nearly 300
racing days a year''.
Everyone has a Christmas they remember above all others and this may be the one
which Northern and Southern Ireland never forget. But if peace is really to
grow stronger it is vital to ensure the memory of every victim of the Troubles
also remains alive.
But the overwhelming message for everyone from the past two days is that this
is a different Ireland than even 15 months ago and anyone of rabid politics
must ask themselves now just who do they represent? On this island, north and
south, a softer wind is blowing.

MATT Smith once woke to find a heron investigating the pond in his back garden
but otherwise - barring the odd road accident - his frogs live a fairly charmed
life. Neighbours in the flats above know to rescue any strays found hopping
towards the traffic at the front. At the last count there were 60 frogs and an
uncertain number of newts.
The garden at 60 Cleveden Drive in the West End of Glasgow is a world of its
own. Six young robins were reared in the wall above Smith's collection of
ornamental grasses from the southern hemisphere. Wrens flit through the
Australian eucalyptus and Chilean Fire Bush. Young frogs try out their legs
among naturalised snakes head fritillaries and oxslips in the wild flower
strip. Edible grapes grow among passion flowers on the patio. All within a
shortish walk from the Great Western Road.
Native birds will take whatever shelter and food they find in the city but
exotic tender plants are flourishing in what used to be a common-or-garden back
green only because the gardener goes to great lengths to seek them out and grow
them. ``A garden is a very artifical environment,'' says Smith who grows many
of his plants from seed and traces others through plant exchanges organised by
the National Council for Conservation of Plants and Gardens (NCCPG).
With the help of the Plant Finder, he beats a track to small specialist
nurseries in the nooks and crannies of Scotland. If he wins the Lottery he will
buy a piece of land somewhere in the Central Belt and start his own nursery to
produce the rare plants he finds round Inverness-shire or Dumfries and Galloway.
Let's hope he does. The plantsman's approach challenges the ``subtle
brain-washing'' of commercialised gardening. ``We don't need to spend a fortune
on expensively packaged seed. Smith either collects seed from his own plants or
orders from ``no-frills'' suppliers like Chiltern Seeds. Like most of us he
bought his first plants from garden centres. ``They're fine when you are
starting out but after a while you realise that they are very limited,
over-priced and they all stock the same things whether they are at Wick or
Land's End.''
You may not need rolling acres to create a unique garden but it helps to have
nerve, know-how and imagination. Matt Smith seems to have it all. At the age of
30, he is not only treasurer of Glasgow and District branch of Scotland's
Gardens Scheme, and a keen member of NCCPG, he is also assistant horticultural
officer (``a charge hand'') for East Kilbride responsible for developing Calder
Park's new winter garden glasshouse collection which attracted 100,000 visitors
this year.
But all this has happened almost by accident. When Smith moved to Cleveden
Drive around nine years ago the garden was little more than a few narrow
borders of Michaelmas daisies set in grass. At that time he had just asked to
be moved from his job as accounts clerk (``I hated it, absolutely hated it'')
to the parks department. He took a horticulture course at Auchincruive College
and never looked back. ``I might be earning more money if I had stayed where I
was but I never wake up in the morning and wish I didn't have to go work.''
Meanwhile the garden in Kelvinside has been transformed with full support and
some help from the neighbours. John Kinloch built stone paths and dry stone
walls which provide the structure. Wendy Henry, in the garden flat, helps with
cultivation, Ian Butler's garage is crammed with sands of pots and bags and
Ross Graham provides ground space for tubs and cold frames where hundreds of
seedlings lie wait to be potted on. ``They're screaming for attention,'' says
Smith, shutting the lid on them firmly. ``They'll have to wait.''
Smith filled the borders and dug the ponds then rescued the frogs and newts
from underneath old carpets and corrugated iron on a piece of wasteland
destined to be cleared for luxury flats. He also commissioned the wooden bridge
he was featured leaning on in The Beechgrove Garden. This summer 200 visitors
came when he opened to the public under the garden's scheme.
Of course I should have seen it then when the meconopsis, grown from seed, were
in bloom. In fact any time but now when the leaves are lying on the grass and
only a few grapes cling to the vine. ``It's the usual story. Gardeners always
say, `if only you had come last week you would have seen . . . '''
That hint of self-mockery seems characteristic. Smith, aware there is still
plenty to see, alternates between infectious enthusiasm, and ironic
self-consciousness. He scatters botanical names with such bewildering speed
neither my Latin nor ageing shorthand can keep up. What is the Pitman's
shortform for Lippia citriodora? Let's say lemon scented verbena.
Smith uses Latin terms for accuracy - ``common names are only common to where
you live, if you want to find something at a nursery it is useful to know even
just a bit of the Latin name.'' But he has no time for horticultural fads. ``I
hate to think I'm becoming a plant snob. I really loathe people who look down
on plants just because they are common. But I want to grow things you don't
find anywhere. If I want to see a berberis I can look over the garden wall, I
want the space for magnolias and eucalyptus - I suppose that makes me a plant
snob.''
Despite this morning's autumn rain, the garden has a lush sub-tropical look.
Smith's favourite garden is Logan, near Stranraer, where he once found a
gardener hoeing a bed and muttering, ``Bloody cordylines, they get
everywhere.'' From Logan come the echiums, from Inverewe the bromeliads. An
Australian holiday last year has strengthened his passion for plants from down
under: note the white flowering eucryphia and aromatic Australian mint bush.
``I was hanging over walls photographing people's gardens and then I discover
they really envy our cottage gardens and plants like delphiniums and aquilegia
which they can't grow.''
You will find some of those at 60 Cleveden Drive, too, along with alpines,
hostas, rhododendrons and spring bulbs. But the flowering currant is white and
the gardener manipulates the shades he wants from self-spreading plants like
Indian Balsam (``Policeman's Helmets'') by weeding out anything other than pale
and more interesting forms. ``In the ideal world there would be room for
everything.''
Faced with the reality of a six-month winter the ``plantaholic'' makes sure
colour and scent from September to April. The winter flowering cherry, Prunas
subhirtella ``Autumnalis'', will bloom from November; the striking foliage of a
variegated Lords and Ladies, Arum italiacum ``Pictum'', now catches the eye;
spring snowflakes, Leucojum vernum, appear in February, and nearing Christmas
the Chinese witch hazel, Hamamelis mollis, puts on a spectacular scented
display. The first real sign of spring is when the frogs start croaking.

A BONANZA of books that would make good Christmas presents have appeared on the
market in the past few weeks and a round-up of some of them might make useful
reading.
Leading the field because of the sheer scale of its scope and the information
it provides is the 1996 edition of Miller's Antiques Price Guide, subtitled ``a
Professional Handbook''. Now in its seventeenth edition, it codifies and lists
more than 10,000 different antiques, ranging from corkscrews to Chippendale
furniture, which have been sold through auction houses, antique shops, markets
and fairs during the past year. All the entries are accompanied by photographs,
many of them in colour.
In the past, Miller's Guide, and others like it, have been included little
information about individual items but this year the consultants Judith and
Martin Miller have incorporated features throughout the text discussing such
diverse subjects as collecting early oak furniture or the state of the market
for silver.
The price of this authoritative and weighty tome is #21.99 and it is published
by Reed Consumer Books Ltd.
Miller's closest rival in the collectors' handbook class is Lyle Publications
who have also brought out their Antiques Price Guide for 1996.
The emphasis in Lyle books, especially in the Price Guide which is reputed to
have a good sale to the inmates of HM prisons, is on finding bargains and
making money. Apart from a foreword discussing the state of what to look for in
any specific area.
As with Miller's the items listed in the guide have been taken from past sale
returns and 7500 of them are illustrated with photographs. This book is also a
weighty hardback and sells for #17.95.
In their series Cash In On Collecting, Lyle's have also brought out other
useful handbooks - There's a Fortune in your Attic; Antique Dealers Pocket
Guide and 1001 Antiques Worth a Fortune (which not a lot of people know
about!). These are all thick paperbacks with a cover price of #7.95 and the
emphasis is on finding unlikely or unsuspected bargains.
Buyers are urged on by anecdotes such as the one about the man who bought an
oddly shaped walking-stick for #4.50 from a junk shop which was subsequently
discovered to be a Hawaiian godstick worth #47,000. What ``not a lot of people
Know'', of course, is how rarely this sort of thing happens.
A more seriously informative book from Lyle is their Price Guide To Silver
which contains more than 3000 descriptions and illustrations of pieces of
silver - with prices. Very useful sections include a glossary of names and
terms and a list of silver marks. Unfortunately not many Scottish marks have
been included, only Edinburgh and Glasgow. The silver price guide costs #14.95
and all the Lyle books are published by Lyle Publications, Glenmayne,
Galashiels.
A book where pecuniary profit is not offered as the main temptation to buyers
is A Guide to the Antique Shops of Britain 1995-96, published by the Antique
Collectors' Club at #14.95.
It has a section on antique shops in Scotland, dividing the country into
Scotland north and Scotland south, and the list of shops given is fairly
comprehensive although there are some omissions. Information appended to each
entry details opening hours, half closing days and the availability of parking,
as well as describing the stock and giving some idea of the range of prices to
be expected.
There is also a list of auction houses throughout the country, maps, a list of
specialist dealers and an index of all shops mentioned in the text. It would be
the perfect book to take on a touring holiday.
Last of all is a book for the specialist numismatist, Coincraft's Standard
Catalogue of English and UK Coins 1066 to Date. It contains 600 pages with 5000
photographs and prices. The publishers make the claim that it is the first new
catalogue of British coins since 1929.
Although my knowledge of coin collecting is next to nil, I found this a good
book to browse through because the pages are frequently enlivened by little
boxes of information entitled Collecting Hints. The headings to the various
sections also give a mass of interesting information, mystifying Latin
abbreviations on coins are explained, and a history of British coinage is
included, as well as a chart of monarchs to lead the reader through history.
I found myself following the history of the mint at Berwick-on-Tweed, which
only operated when things were quiet on the Border and the coinage from which
was often very coarsely cast. The book is produced by     a panel of specialist
editors and published by Coincraft at #19.95.
n Christmas is coming and the salerooms are bringing out their seasonal
offerings. On December 8, Christie's in South Kensington are offering a
selection of dolls and Christmas decorations including a six foot tall
composition figure of Santa Claus holding an empty sack.
In the 1930s, this figure used to stand at the entrance of Trinity Arcade, a
very up-market store in Nottingham. Children used to climb on to his feet in
order to whisper their requests for presents and as a result the toes of his
boots are all worn away. The estimate for the shoddily shod Santa is between
#1000 and #1500.
An unexpectedly high price of around #500 is also quoted for a set of eight
large German-made coloured glass balls for hanging on Christmas trees and
dating from the 1950s. There must be many of those coloured baubles still lying
around in family attics or boxrooms. Worth having a look anyway.

n Being a bit of a movie buff I would have to go for either The Towering
Inferno or Bullitt as my best film. I am a great Steve McQueen fan. Both of
these movies personify the ultimate coolness of this great actor. From the
tremendous car chase in Bullitt to him hanging off a helicopter in The Towering
Inferno he was the 1970s equivalent of Arnie, Sly and Bruce all rolled into one.
n My worst shop has to be Flip Inc. From the moment I walked in there I knew I
was out of place. All of the staff glanced me up and down and thought to
themselves: ``What is he doing here?'' If I needed assistance I had to go to
them as they were not prepared to move away from the mirrors situated about the
shop. I think the words ``chocolate'' and ``eat themselves'' spring to mind.

A STRIKER who admits he didn't know where to find Aberdeen on the map will turn
out for the Pittodrie side against Partick Thistle at Firhill this afternoon.
Dean Windass of Hull City was transferred north after a #700,000 deal conducted
at a rapid pace by manager Roy Aitken, who was anxious to make the point that
the signing did not mean anyone would be leaving.
He said: ``I am not finished yet. I am looking to build a competitive pool and
this shows our supporters where I am trying to take the club. I watched him
several times, and know I have a player who will suit our passing style. He has
all the qualities required.
``His arrival will increase competition for places but that is healthy.''
Hull manager Terry Dolan, who signed Windass for nothing three years ago from
non-league football, even though he had been freed by Hull as a teenager, said:
``I'm happy for him. He deserves to play on a bigger stage.
``I am just surprised that it has taken him so long to get this move. All the
clubs, including Celtic, who watched him recently, will regret not making their
minds up quicker.''
The 26-year-old Windass admitted he was still dazed at the speed of it all:
``It hasn't sunk in yet. I was struggling to find Aberdeen on the map - thank
goodness they've got an airport here. I saw them win the Coca-Cola Cup on TV
but it was so one-sided that I didn't pay much attention.
``I certainly never dreamed I would be playing for them a week later.''
The new man had been let down when a move to Norwich City fell through but now
looks forward to the prospect of playing in Europe next season. ``I've landed
the move to a big club I have always wanted. It will be a different challenge
from fighting relegation with Hull but I'm sure I can handle it.''
Windass, it seems, is not short on self confdidence as he went on to point out
that, although he is not the quickest player in the world, ``I have the vision
and passing ability to compensate.''
Aberdeen will again be without striker Scott Booth, keeper Theo Snelders, and
two other players face fitness tests this morning.
Thistle were still hoping late last night that they, too, would have a new boy
in their team to face up to Windass. Manager Murdo MacLeod was determined to
have further talks with Celtic defender Mark McNally when he returned from a
trial with Southend and, if it went as he hoped, there is every chance the
player will line-up at Firhill.
Celtic have left the final decision to McNally after having accepted a #60,000
bid from any of three clubs - Thistle, Falkirk and Southend.
MacLeod has team problems. Gregg Watson is out because of flu, Wayne Foster and
Albert Craig are doubtful because of injury, and the manager himself, who
sounded as if he was in the throes of the bug, is a non starter. One sure
starter, however, is Mark Cairns, the reserve keeper who gets his chance after
the unfortunate injury to Nicky Walker.
Celtic's good form which has kept Rangers in their sights will have to continue
at Kilmarnock's expense at Parkhead.
Manager Tommy Burns has a full squad from which to choose, including defender
John Hughes who is playing his last game before a three-match suspension which
will keep him on the sidelines until after Christmas.
Another man making his final appearance for the same period is Peter Grant who
is also aware that Phil O'Donnell has recovered from injury and should be able
to step in when Grant steps out.
Kilmarnock will still be without Ray Montgomerie, Mark Skilling and Billy
Findlay, but former Army player Gary Holt, who was also with Celtic, will be in
from the start. ``He deserves his chance,'' said manager Alex Totten. ``He is a
typical squaddie in that he can run all day but he has the ability to go with
it.''
Motherwell will have Dougie Arnott in the front line for their home meeting
with Hibs, after he had looked doubtful following an injury last week, but the
list of absent friends remains long.
Manager Alex McLeish, who will field the same team that began in the draw with
Falkirk, said: ``Eddie May and Shaun McSkimming have been back in training this
week but it would be unfair to risk them at this stage.''
Hibs will check on Pat McGinlay, who has had flu, and Keith Wright, who has
been out for some time because of a hamstring injury, but McGinlay may be the
better bet to play. Manager Alex Miller was not too despondent after the 4-1
defeat by Rangers at home, but wants to see his side play throughout as well as
they did in the first half then.
Falkirk, beginning to recover their confidence, will be fully tested by the
team that never ceases to surprise, Raith Rovers, at Brockville.
Raith have added new signing, Bristol City defender Mark Humphries, to their
squad.

DECEMBER skies are empty of planets, save for surly Saturn hanging low towards
the south-west. No matter. Who needs planets? Let's cast an eager eye on the
winter stars.
Making a slow entrance from the south-east comes the aptly named Winter
Triangle, a trio of biggies called Sirius, Procyon and Betelgeuse. Sirius,
alias the dog star, is the brightest in our whole firmament. The others are
pretty good shiners too - with Procyon the eighth brightest in the sky and
Betelgeuse the tenth.
Also clearly visible is Capella, the sixth brightest. Look almost directly
overhead and you'll find it in the constellation Auriga. Having located Auriga,
pan a little southwards and you can lock on to the constellation Taurus in
which there are two easily identifiable star clusters.
Swimming strongly into vision come the Pleiades, a glorious sight, the famous
Seven Sisters lightly veiled in mistiness. No need to remove the binoculars and
rub your eyes, however - that blurry effect is caused by the swirls of spare
gas left over when the sisters were born, a kind of inter-stellar soft focus.
The gas glows with a luminosity reflected from these young and hot lovelies,
which is why the Pleiades are classed as a reflection nebula.
The sisters are mere infants in the cosmic time scale, having been formed just
a few million years ago.
According to ancient myth, they represent the daughters of Atlas who were swept
up into the sky when they pleaded to be saved from the clutches of the hunter
Orion. The seven may be the brightest luminaries in the cluster, but there are
fainter stars galore alongside them. Altogether there are about 400 stars in
the Pleiades - some sorority!
Also in Taurus is the Hyades star cluster, which is grouped round Aldebaran.
But since Aldebaran, a red giant, is the brightest star in the whole
constellation, the Hyades are rather outfaced by their companion.
Keep with Taurus. Within it you will find the nebula known prosaically as M1
and more picturesquely as the Crab. The origin of the Crab is far different
from that of a nebula such as the Pleiades. The Crab - which in fact is a great
cloud of gas - is all that remains of an old star which expanded in old age
until it exploded (the phenomenon known as a supernova). The cataclysm was seen
as a bright light in the sky by earthlings in the year 1054, though of course
it happened much earlier in time.
Once a supernova takes place, the neutrons created by the gravitational
collapse form a rapidly spinning, highly condensed core or neutron star which
sends out radio signals or pulses at regular intervals - hence the name pulsar.
The Crab is one of only two pulsars which transmit light as well as radio waves.
On the whole, 1995 has been a poor year for viewing meteor showers, due to
their occurrence at times of fairly bright moonlight. December is no exception.
However the Geminid shower, due on the 14th, are prominent and should be worth
seeing. Look towards the south-east and locate the constellation Gemini - the
stars Castor and Pollux are good markers.

MARK Waugh abandoned his trademark cavalier approach to wreck Pakistan's hopes
of a substantial first-innings lead in the third and final Test in Sydney
yesterday.
The Australia batsman defended resolutely to compile a patient unbeaten
half-century on the second day at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Batting at No.4, Waugh's 54 not out steered Australia to 151 for three from 57
overs in reply to Pakistan's first innings 299 before bad light stopped play 30
minutes before the scheduled close.
Waugh gained valuable support from twin brother Steve, who finished on 26 not
out, in adding 60 runs in an unbroken fourth-wicket partnership.
Pakistan No.3 batsman Ijaz Ahmed had earlier lifted his side to a respectable
total with a fine 137, his highest score in test cricket.
But the tourists failed to capitalise on his marathon performance by losing
their last six wickets for 36 runs after resuming on 231 for four.

A DEFIANT 52 from South African-born Robin Smith was not enough to save his
adopted England on the second day of the second Test against South Africa in
Johannesburg yesterday.
Replying to the home team's total of 332, England slumped to 200 all out in
just 68.3 overs. South Africa were five without loss in their second innings at
the close.
Left-arm spinner Clive Eksteen claimed three for 12 to destroy the middle
order, while paceman Shaun Pollock mopped up the tail to return figures of
three for 44.
Smith hit a steepling uppercut 6 in his 109-ball stay, which also included
eight 4s, but apart from Graham Thorpe, England's batsmen had only themselves
to blame for not keeping Smith company.
Thorpe was horrified to be given out caught at short leg, off Eksteen's first
delivery, and his ire seemed vindicated when television replays showed neither
bat nor gloves within touching distance of the ball.
But there was no doubt about Eksteen's next two victims. Graeme Hick struck a
powerful return catch soon after tea on six, and Jack Russell was caught at
mid-wicket for 12 following a mistimed sweep.
Alec Stewart earlier clipped swing bowler Meyrick Pringle straight into
Kirsten's hands at short mid-wicket in the last over before tea to depart for
45 as England slumped from 109 for two to 116 for four.
Stewart and Thorpe had added 64 to repair the early damage inflicted by Allan
Donald who bowled Mike Atherton for nine with a beautiful off-cutter and Mark
Ramprakash for four with a full delivery that ripped out the middle stump.
Stewart had enjoyed a remarkable piece of luck on 26 when he was beaten for
pace by a Donald bouncer. His attempted hook lobbed gently to mid-wicket where
Shaun Pollock dropped a simple catch.
Pollock, who endured a day of fluctuating fortunes, had fared much better
earlier when South Africa added a further 54 runs to their overnight 278 for
seven thanks largely to his brisk innings of 33.
Eksteen was delighted to have made a significant contribution on his home
ground.
``We've had a very good day but there are still three hard days to go before
the Test is ours,'' he said.
Coach Bob Woolmer also sounded a warning note. ``Plenty of Tests have been lost
from similar positions to this. We have to put a really big score on the board
to make sure it doesn't happen to us.''
After a disastrous second day for England, William Hill quote South Africa as
1-2 favourites to win the second Test, with the tourists at 5-1 and the draw at

DUNDEE vice-chairman Malcolm Reid admitted last night that the proposed
management take-over of the club  will hinge around Jim Duffy.
It emerged yesterday that Canadian millionaire Ron Dixon had jumped the gun on
Thursday by announcing that a #3m deal had been concluded which would put Reid
and player-manager Duffy in control at Dens Park.
Reid, who would succeed the Canadian as chairman with Duffy taking a seat on
the board, said: ``I am fairly confident the deal we have been offered will be
completed.
``But Jim Duffy's final decision will be a key to the whole thing.
``If he were to turn down what is on offer then I would not be interested in
playing my proposed part in the take-over.''
But last night, Duffy was making it clear there would be no comment from him on
the matter. ``Right now I am prepared to talk about football at the club and
nothing else,'' he said.
Reid also conceded that negotiations are on-going on the plan Dixon put
forward. He said: ``There is a lot of work still to be done. We have still to
look at the legal angles involving the movement of shares in the club. And we
are still talking about the final price although Ron is not putting any
pressure on us in that regard.''
The vice-chairman also made it clear he is also still looking for financial
backing to complete the take-over. He said: ``Things have now been spelled out
to the other members of the board and other          people are also showing an
interest.
``We believe there will be backing because this move would put the club into
the local ownership of people determined to fulfil Dundee's ambitions.''
Reid hopes that the whole thing can fall into place to the satisfaction of
Dixon and those taking charge at Dens in time for Christmas.

BARINGS was described in 1818 by French statesman Duc de Richelieu as the sixth
great power in Europe, alongside England, France, Russia, Austria and Prussia.
q The first Baring, Johann, arrived in Britain in 1717 from Bremen in northern
Germany.
q Two of his sons, John and Francis, started the bank in London in 1762.
q Baring credit re-opened trade with the United States after the American War
of Independence and helped finance Britain's wars against Napoleon.
q The Barings invested heavily in land to hedge against disaster should the
bank fail. When Francis died in 1810 he had just #68,000 in the bank but
#400,000 in land holdings.
q The so-called Baring Crisis of 1890 rocked the City. It was sparked by a
default on Argentinian loans worth about #250 million in today's terms.
q Edward Baring, Lord Revelstoke - who had a gambling instinct - had to sell
houses, paintings and furniture to pay off his debts and his wife was said to
have died of shame.
q But the bank survived as the dynastic family rallied around.
q In 1969, control was passed to a charity which held the share capital.

FIRST DIVISION
\IT was a shock at the time, but neither Morton nor Clydebank can remember the
exact season. ``Approximately three years ago,'' seems to be the general
consensus from manager Allan McGraw and Kilbowie secretary Ian Steedman. The
Bankies travelled to Cappielow never having defeated the home side on the south
banks of the Clyde. The men from across the water, formed in the mid-60s, won
7-1. They have not tasted victory there since.
The two sides meet again today. Morton, in second place in the first division,
naturally are favourites. The fact that Clydebank have lost only four league
games this season - twice each to Dunfermline and Dundee United - would suggest
caution in any forecast of what will happen.
Much will depend from Morton's point of view whether or not Alan Mahood can
shake off an injury, while Bankies must wait for fitness tests on Tom Currie,
Davie Nicholls, and Colin Sutherland.
Leaders Dunfermline, meanwhile, can still look down on the other teams despite
having lost three of their past five matches. And, as far as their long list of
injuries is concerned, there's good news for them, and possibly bad news for
the opposition who have failed to take advantage.
Hamilton are the visitors to East End Park today, and the Fifers will welcome
back Stewart Petrie and Greg Shaw. Injuries, however, still will rule out Brian
Rice, David Bingham, Neale Cooper, Andy Smith, and Kenny Ward.
Accies manager Iain Munro will miss the injured Michael Geraghty and Scott
McCulloch.
Dundee coach John McCormack is in no doubt that his club - despite their
Coca-Cola Cup defeat by Aberdeen last week, and the boardroom wrangles in
midweek - will not only come back strongly against St Mirren at Love Street,
but also win against Dumbarton in midweek to go top of the league. Winger Neil
McCann may miss today's match.
Airdrie have striker Steve Cooper suspended for their home clash against St
Johnstone at Broadwood.
St Johnstone have John O'Neill, Andy Whiteford, and Danny Griffin doubtful.
Dundee United take on struggling Dumbarton at Tannadice.

BEAUTY BOX
I would call it a debate if it was intelligent enough, but nothing
intellectually smart comes from the fashion industry. Designers, style gurus,
PRs and models, have decided that the PC mob have had it too good. The fur
coat, they claim, is back.
Last year, Sophia Loren agreed to advertise fur. She was approached because she
is old, and has the stage-managed tartiness of the fabulously rich and
self-obsessed. In Italy, 7.5 million women own real fur coats, and if I was
prepared to be nice, I'd say that the star is deluded by a cultural and genetic
disposition to flaunting vulgar items of wealth. In America, too, the fur
industry is still worth $1.5 billion. Think of their weather, it's glorious.
Wearing fur in Italy and America can't be explained away in terms of
practicality.
There are women like Sophia, who think that wearing mink and fox is glamorous.
They are conditioned by avarice into believing that real fur is sensual. But
women like Sophia Loren are dinosaurs for they have no spiritual involvement in
modern-day society.
Implementing the idea in the public consciousness that it is OK to wear real
fur, is designed, literally, to redress the zeitgeist. If the stigma attached
to wearing fur recedes, sales increase. Statistics show that the number of fur
farms in Britain has decreased from 50 in 1989 to 13 today, and it's a fact to
be proud of.
Marketing men and women, however, are working overtime to convince people that
it is socially acceptable to return to wearing real fur. The Fur Education
Council (FEC) who speak for the Fur Traders Association, say that in Britain
during 1993/94, sales were up from #3.7m to #10m. What is significant is that
the FEC was set up to counteract anti-fur campaigns by Greenpeace and Lynx. The
FEC say their figures are supplied by the Department of Trade and Industry, who
in turn, say they were supplied by the Central Statistical Office, who, in
turn, have admitted that they don't know where the figures came from.
The underlying presumption in the fur debate, is that people are ready and
willing to abandon principle for the sake of being in fashion. The lives of the
truly superficial are a series of gestures, and if a woman is heard to declare
that she has no problem with wearing mink or snow leopard or alligator or
domestic cat (they use cat fur to make coats in Italy), then she will parade
the streets in defiance of public disapproval, wrapped up in her own personal
crusade.
Women who wear real fur coats scare me, they are dangerously pathetic. They
think they're so brave for stepping out in one too. But they are not Marie
Antoinette, there is no rabble, no crescendo of revolution at their front
porch. In the street they are usually eyed with a mute disbelief, their tragedy
the fact that they think the murder of 40 joyful, vulnerable, intelligent
creatures could possibly be flattering to wear.
Another tack adopted by spin doctors for the fur trade is that the popularity
of fake fur is responsible for the return of real fur. I have several fake
furs, which are made of the same material as a teddy bear, in blue, red, and
speckled like snow after a dose of road grit. No effort has been made to
simulate the skin of any species. If I thought their appearance would propel
women to a furrier, I would burn them.
The older women who wear fur have a different mindset. They would never wear a
fake, too cheap. Just as girls of my generation, would never dream of doing it
for real.

MILLION DOLLAR CHALLENGE
NICK Faldo shot his worst round of the year as he struggled to a 78 at the Sun
City Million Dollar Challenge in South Africa yesterday.
The former world No.1's second round was one of the most remarkable of his
career as he went out in nine-over-par 45 - but came back in three under.
Faldo's troubles began when he dumped two balls in the greenside lake at the
par-3 fourth hole to record a quad-ruple bogey 7. Then he took a 7 at the par-4
eighth.
``The strange thing is that I did not hit the ball that badly,'' said Faldo,
who lies 12 shots behind leader Nick Price. ``But the rough is so bad this week
that if you're 10 feet off line you have no shot.''
Price, of Zimbabwe, shot the best round of the day - a 67 to lead at the
halfway stage.
Scotland's Sam Torrance, joint overnight leader with American Corey Pavin,
dropped back after a 73 to be four shots behind Price.
Pavin carded a 72 which left him sharing second place with Germany's Bernhard
Langer and fellow American Tom Lehman, three behind Price who bogeyed the first
hole but made no further mistakes.
He went out in level par but stormed home in 31 with five birdies, including
three in the last four holes.
Torrance spoiled his round with a 7 at the par-5 ninth - the hole he eagled on
his way to the joint lead yesterday.
After a 69, the second-best round of the day, Langer said he did not think
Price's three-shot lead was significant.
``You can lose three shots at one hole the way the course is set up,'' he said.
Colin Montgomerie continued his woeful time at the event, adding a 76 to his
opening 79 which left him detached from the rest of the 12-man field and 17
shots behind Price.
Local favourite Ernie Els remained in contention after a second successive 72,
six behind Price. He was critical of difficult pin positions. ``With the rough
up they should put the pins in easier places. The crowd does not want to see us
struggling out there,'' he said. Scores:
138 - N Price (Zimbabwe) 71, 67.
141 - B Langer (Germany) 72, 69; T Lehman (US) 71, 70; C Pavin (US) 69, 72.
142 - S Torrance (Scotland) 69, 73.
144 - E Els (S Africa) 72, 72.
147 - V Singh (Fiji) 75, 72.
150 - D Frost (S Africa) 74, 76; P Mickelson (US) 73, 77; N Faldo (England) 72,

CHRISTMAS is coming early for a handful of Highland League clubs, thanks to a
bargain pre-festive sale by Fort William. Five of their top players are
available on free transfers because the Lochaber club is struggling for cash.
Fort William can't afford the travelling expenses for their quintet of
Inverness and Aberdeen-based players and have released them, setting off a
scramble for their signatures.
In a bid to make an assault on the title, the Fort made generous offers this
season to capture defenders Mike Andrew and Billy Skinner, goalkeeper Billy
Neilson, midfielder Alan MacDonald, and their current top scorer Alan Moir, who
is studying at Aberdeen University.
But their challenge has faltered and they have told the players they will make
their farewell appearance at Deveronvale today.
Elgin and Clach are likely to head the queue for the services of the players,
although lowly Forres are expected to make bids as well.

MACCLESFIELD, December 2 - A deadly game of cat-and-mouse is being played in
the tranquil English countryside of Cheshire as the Jacobite and the British
Government's armies try to outmanoeuvre each other.
Prince Charles Edward Stuart and his 4500 clansmen, their numbers now swelled
by about 300 English supporters, mean to continue their headlong advance, which
has brought them from Carlisle in 10 days. Their momentum has baffled all
resistance. There were hopes of intercepting them at the River Mersey, which
runs just south of Manchester. But without opposition they crossed it yesterday
and covered another 10 miles to arrive at this little town, famous for its
button-making.
Here the prince learned that the Duke of Cumberland, now in charge of all royal
forces in England, is moving towards him with 8000 troops. Formerly under Sir
John Ligonier, these have been encamped in Staffordshire for a fortnight,
barring one of the main routes south but otherwise making no attempt to meet
the Jacobite invasion while they awaited their new commander. The duke has
galvanised them into action and obviously intends to join battle at the first
opportunity. His forward outposts are now at Newcastle-under-Lyme, fewer than
20 miles away.
The Jacobite leaders held a council of war last night. They decided to split
their army, not for the first time, to keep the other side guessing and exploit
their advantages of greater speed and flexibility over a more conventional
force.
At daybreak, the Jacobite general, Lord George Murray, moved 1200 soldiers five
miles south-west to Congleton. From there a road leads into Wales, where he
might get the chance to recruit more men. Cumberland really has no choice but
to turn and follow him. The danger is that this will leave the rest of the
clansmen, still standing to arms at Macclesfield, with an open road through
Derby towards London. There are no other loyal forces between here and the
capital.
The Jacobite leaders maintain in public a united front of support for Prince
Charles's strategy of striking straight at London. But the anxieties of the
Scots are never far away. Most would have preferred to remain in their homeland
and defend its independence under the restored Stuarts against any Hanoverian
attack. They went along with the invasion of England against their better
judgment, but they are becoming pessimistic.
This is because so few Englishmen have joined them. They expected their
fortunes to look up after they reached the prosperous textile town of Preston
on November 26, in the heart of the traditionally Jacobite North-west of
England. There and at every place where they have stopped since Carlisle, they
held a ceremony proclaiming King James III and VIII in an effort to stir the
local people. But the response was minimal.
Prince Charles then forecast he would raise at least 1500 men in Manchester,
which he entered on November 29. He was encouraged by the fact that, like other
towns, it fell to him with ridiculous ease. People said afterwards:
``Manchester was taken by a sergeant, a drummer and a woman.''
The sergeant was James Dickson, a Scot formerly serving in the British army who
opted to change sides after being captured at Prestonpans. He marched out in
front of the main body of the Jacobites with his mistress and a drummer-boy.
They got to Manchester well ahead of the rest, to be surrounded by a crowd
which was first curious then hostile. He defended himself with a blunderbuss,
and this was the signal for the 500 or 600 local Jacobites to show themselves
and come to his rescue. They then occupied the streets.
When the army arrived, church-bells rang out and bonfires were lit. Many people
illuminated their windows, while civic leaders came to kiss the prince's hand.
Another crowd gathered outside his lodgings, where some were allowed to watch
him dine. At the table, according to an eye-witness, Lord Elcho, Charles was
exhilarated, and asked his officers ``in what manner he should enter London, on
horseback or afoot, and in what dress''.
But the town may have put on its show of enthusiasm only to humour the
Highlanders and prevent any looting. In any case, when it came to recruitment
Manchester was little better than smaller places. About 300 men volunteered,
most of them unemployed, and several admitting that they would have joined
whichever came first.
There are still enough of them to form a Manchester Regiment, the only one to
be mustered so far by the Jacobites on English soil. It has been put under the
command of Francis Townley, of Townley Hall, Burnley, a Roman Catholic whose
father joined the rising of 1715 but was afterwards acquitted of treason. The
younger Townley has served as an officer in the French army.
None of this was enough to impress the Scots, who while in Manchester held
private meetings to go over the situation. The English people were obviously
cool towards them and, as Lord Elcho puts it, they have ``received not the
least encouragement from any person of distinction''. Nor have the French shown
much sign of mounting the promised invasion across the Channel. The Scots
reckon they have proved their own loyalty to the Stuarts, and never meant to
force the deposed dynasty on England.
When the clan chieftains then gathered at a highly charged council of war on St
Andrew's Day, November 30, they told the prince he should go back to Scotland.
But he differed and again got his way. The Scots agreed at least to march on to
Derby so that, in Elcho's words, ``neither the French nor the English might
have it to say, the army had not marched far enough into England to give the
one encouragement to land and the other to join''. The next day the Jacobite
army left Manchester, but with its leaders clearly sensing the approach of a
crisis.
n Another dispatch next week.

NICK LEESON's deal with the Singapore authorities may not mean that others
involved in the Barings scandal will walk away scot-free, but the fact he was
not cross-examined in court meant that he would not be publicly naming names.
What happened next depended on whether the Singapore authorities, as Finance
Minister Richard Hu indicated in October they intended to, pursue charges
against those Barings executives alleged to have taken part in a cover up.
Leeson's immediate staff in Singapore are unlikely to interest the Singapore
authorities. They are more interested in the man he reported to in London, Mr
Peter Norris, and the two regional bosses, Mr James Bax and Mr Simon Jones.
Singapore's official report into the Barings debacle, published in October,
said other Barings officials had concealed Leeson's unauthorised trades and
that there was ``a strong inference that key individuals of the Barings group
management were grossly negligent, or wilfully blind and reckless with the
truth''.
After the collapse in February, Barings was bought by the Dutch financial
conglomerate, ING, and, while most of the 2000 Barings staff in London were
kept on, 21 of the senior staff were either sacked or resigned. The ING
decision was clearly taken on the basis of what it found when it took over. The
Singapore report found the fall of Barings Futures to have been caused by
``institutional incompetence, a lack of understanding of the future business
among senior executives, and a total failure of internal controls''. Some of
those who left voluntarily, or were dismissed, must have borne some
responsibilty for that situation.
The two names which crop up repeatedly are those of 40-year-old Mr Norris, who
was head of the investment banking arm, and now lives in Hertfordshire, and
42-year-old Mr James Bax, who was south east Asia regional manager, and still
lives in Singapore. The auditors, Price Waterhouse, in their report to the
Singapore authorities, alleged the two men had ignored warning signs, provided
Leeson with more and more money for his losing bets, and later tried to cover
up his losses.
They were said to have played down a #50m discrepancy in Leeson's books,
discovered by the auditors in January, which would have served as a warning
that things were going wrong. There were other warning signs about that time
which were also ignored, including two from Simex, the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange.
The Bank of England, whose Board of Banking Supervision published its report on
the affair in July, is examining whether it was misled by Mr Norris in the
account he furnished of the events leading to the collapse. There are
discrepancies between what he told the Bank, and what is contained in the
Singapore inspectors' report, and he has discussed them with the Bank's
investigators, Mr Brian Quinn, head of banking supervision, and Mr Ian West,
head of special investigations.
Although criticised by the Board of Banking Supervision report published for
failing to prevent the collapse, it is only in the Singapore report Mr Norris
is accused of participating in a cover up. Mr Bax has not been interviewed by
the Bank officials. He has, however, been interviewed by the CAD, as has Mr
Simon Jones, operations manager for the region when Leeson was dealing. The
Singapore report also named Mr Anthony Hawes, the group treasurer, as having
been involved in the concealment.
Mr Norris has dismissed the Singapore conclusions as having no basis in fact,
and, to be fair, the report's conclusion that there was a cover up appears
based on conflicting testimony from former Barings executives, rather than
conclusive proof. The man who might be able to furnish that proof is Mr Leeson.
Since he is not now going to undergo cross examination in public about his
crimes, if no further action is taken by the Singpore authorities, that may be
the last to be heard. While what has happened is clearly in Mr Leeson's
interests, from the point of view of the British investors, who trusted
Barings, as well the matter of public trust in the Bank of England's ability to
supervise the activities of such banks, it is bad news.
Other Barings executives criticised by the Board of Banking Supervision for
their part in the affair include Mr Ron Baker, head of the financial products
group, was found to have no real understanding of the nature of Baring Futures
Singapore and to have failed to familiarise himself with what Mr Leeson was
doing, and the former Bank supervisor, Mr Chris Thompson. Although the
chairman, Mr Peter Baring, and the deputy chairman, Mr Andrew Tickey, emerged
relatively unscathed, they, too, had to take responsibilty for the fact that
senior management was so ill-informed.
Mr Leeson's lawyers have all along claimed he was being made a scapegoat for
``a wide circle of people''. This magic circle may well, because of the deal,
simply vanish. It is no longer operating, its members are no longer working for
Barings, and the supervisory authorities have learned the lessons of the
Barings affair.
Mr Bax and Mr Jones have so far not commented on either report, but in a letter
to the Singapore Times in March, claimed that Mr Leeson reported directly to
London.
The Serious Fraud Office said last night it had not uncovered any evidence of
criminal actions by London-based Barings staff, but it would be taking a keen
interest in developments in Singapore. The SFO investigation into Barings would
be reactivated in the event that information were to come to light which
warranted it pursuing any actions in Britain, he added.

NICK LEESON had the world in his hands - but let it slip through his fingers.
The boy who went from a Watford council estate to dealing in hundreds of
millions of pounds, sent world markets crashing.
His actions reverberated around the globe as his bosses at Barings Bank, in
London, tried to disassociate themselves from his activities.
Leeson, 28, is the only son of a plasterer. His mother died ten years ago and
Bill Leeson took charge of Nick, his younger brother and two sisters.
At school, Nick was a prefect, a good footballer but not too bright
academically. He failed his maths A-level and left Parmiter's School with two
poor passes in French and History.
Like many of the school's old boys, he went to work in the world of banking.
His first job was as a clerk at Coutts.
Three years later, he switched to the merchant bank Morgan Stanley, where he
made his mark as a dealer in futures. Within five years, he was being
head-hunted by Baring Brothers.
As the whizz-kidd went from strength to strength, he met and married Lisa Sims,
who worked at the bank as a secretary.
Soon they were living a luxury lifestyle in Singapore - but hardly had time to
enjoy it.
Lisa, 27, stood loyally by her husband and was by his side as they fled
Singapore only to be stopped in Germany. She returned to Singapore with him
when he was finally extradited. Leeson had been pale and drawn as he was
arrested in Germany. But his return to Singapore last week was more relaxed.
He sipped gin and tonic on the plane and smiled as he made his first court
appearance on arrival.
Now he will have time to contemplate how the couple will be able to pick up the
pieces of their life on his release.
Lisa was staying out of the limelight with friends yesterday - and was ``not
too bad'' under the circumstances, her father, Mr Alec Sims, said.
He said he did not know if Mrs Leeson, a part-time waitress, had any plans to
fly to Singapore.
A spokeswoman at the Elizabeth Tea Rooms, in Pudding Lane, Maidstone, where Mrs
Leeson works, said she was not expected in and could not say where she was.

DESPITE criticism from Rangers and Scottish Professional Footballers'
Association secretary Tony Higgins, the SFA have no intention of altering its
use of referee supervisor reports in disciplinary cases.
Chief executive Jim Farry made it clear yesterday that, under the current
rules, the committee is entitled to conduct an inquiry into any player
misbehaviour from wherever the information comes.
``We have a good relationship with the member clubs who agree to the articles
and rules that allow the disciplinary committee to investigate any reports of
misconduct.'' said Farry. ``All reports are examined and passed on to the
relevant body. It is up to them if any inquiry is instigated, wherever the
report comes from. We once received one from the Lord Provost of Glasgow.''
The SFA case, disputed by Rangers, is based on the articles and standing orders
which refer to the council having the right to discipline any player or
official who brings the game into disrepute . . . and the committee's
entitlement to ``deal with all reports in connection with field offences or
misconduct . . .''
The chief executive also insisted that the role of the referee supervisor is as
it has always been. ``His mission is to construct a report for the association
on the pre-prepared form that he fills in after the game. It is then up to the
SFA to pass on any relevant matters to the respective department.
``Contrary to opinion, the supervisor is not there to pick up on the referee's
mistakes but if there is a clear indication in his report that there is a
disciplinary matter which needs investigation then it is passed on.''
Farry said that the meeting on Thursday, during which two Rangers players, Paul
Gascoigne and John Brown, were suspended for one game as a result of incidents
not reported by the referee in the game against Aberdeen at Ibrox, had been
conducted fairly.
``Every player had his chance to state his case, there was time for the
reporter of the incidents (the supervisor) to be questioned and to question the
players and then a decision was reached.''
He also pointed out that the punishment handed out matched the suspension which
would have ensued had the players concerned been shown a red card by the
referee.
Two players also involved in controversy at Ibrox, Rangers' Alan McLaren and
Billy Dodds, of Aberdeen, had their cases deferred in order to allow police
investigations in which they had been questioned, to be completed.
However, that does not mean the others, Gascoigne and Brown, will be excluded
from any action taken by the procurator fiscal who has asked for the
investigation.
Meanwhile, Gascoigne was in his usual place in the squad announced by manager
Walter Smith for the trip to Edinburgh to meet Hearts at Tynecastle, but the
manager left his listeners intrigued by saying that Brian McGinty, who played
in the side that was successful in last week's visit to the capital, when they
beat Hibs 4-1, will keep his place.
With Stuart McCall and Brian Laudrup fit again, there seems to be a
well-stocked midfield, especially as Charlie Miller has also to be accommodated
but perhaps McCall will be used in a different role.
McGinty, who did well last week, will be 19 shortly and may be about ready to
stake his claim for a regular spot in the pool. In any case, Smith would be
pleased to see a repeat of the form his team showed at Easter Road where
Gascoigne received some of his best notices since he arrived from Lazio.
``Hearts have had something of a revival in recent weeks,'' said the manager,
``and although they were dented at Parkhead last week they will be a different
team from the one we beat at Ibrox.''
The Tynecastle side would be all the more formidable if they have striker John
Robertson in his place but, although he will have a fitness test on the injured
hamstring which kept him out last week, he may be odds against making it. Alan
Lawrence is standing by to take his place.
q DUMBARTON are set to appeal over the five-match ban imposed by the SFA on
goalkeeper Ian McFarlane on Thursday.
McFarlane was called in front of the disciplinary committee after being
red-carded twice for the one incident when a linesman said he had both
head-butted and punched Airdrie's Jim McIntyre.
McIntyre described the incident as ``handbags at 10 paces'' and Dumbarton
manager Jim Fallon said yesterday: ``Our directors will meet over the weekend
to decide whether they will make an appeal.''
Meantime, with 17-year-old Peter Dennison the only other keeper on the books,
Dumbarton last night signed the former Clydebank keeper Ken Meechan, from
Greenock Juniors.

SECOND/THIRD DIVISIONS
IF ASKED to pick out a team who have failed to win any one of their past four
home games, you would not immediately think of East Fife, leaders of the second
division. Curiously, that indeed is the Fifers' record over the past two months.
Player-manager Steve Archibald, however, will not be too hard on his men for a
number of reasons. They would have been bound to lose momentum sooner or later,
they do still lead the division by six points, and they can boast seven wins
from eight away matches.
Today's visitors are Berwick Rangers, who share second place with Stirling
Albion, and Tom Hendrie's injury-hit Borderers have been boosted by the return
to the squad of striker Paul Rutherford, who is available for selection after a
long time out through injury.
The result at Methil will be noted with interest at Forthbank, where Stirling
will hope to extend their 12-game unbeaten league run. Out-of-form Forfar are
the visitors.
Like the leaders, Clyde fare better away from home than in front of their own
support but they will find it hard to take points from Stranraer's Stair Park.
Stenhousemuir will hope to make up for last week's home defeat - at the hands
of Clyde - by collecting the points at lowly Montrose, whose manager, Andy
Dornan, has been trying to recruit from the Highland League. Gordon Dalziel
will expect his Ayr United team to climb out of the bottom two by defeating,
and leapfrogging over, Queen of the South.
The highest attendance in the third division assuredly will be at Livingston,
where second-placed Ross County will hope to deny Jim Leishman's team a first
victory at their new Almondvale Stadium. Caledonian Thistle will do well not to
understimate East Stirlingshire, while Cowdenbeath's revival will be tested at
Arbroath.
Brechin City ought to be too strong for Albion Rovers at Cliftonhill, while the
visit of Queen's Park to Alloa takes Spiders' manager Hugh McCann back to a
ground where he once had charge. One man who was there at that time, the home
side's long-serving defender Willie Newbigging, has come off the transfer list
and will be fighting to win back a first-team place.

TRADING in derivatives involves gambling with the chance of making mountains of
money - and the risk of losing spectacularly.
They are ``derived'' from the underlying price of other investments, including
futures, which involve betting on future prices.
A certain amount of money is invested in the hope that the value of a
commodity, currency, shares or bonds will rise.
If it does, your bonus for making your company truckloads of money is assured.
If not, it can mean financial oblivion.
The particular attraction of derivatives comes from the fact that only a small
down-payment is needed to stand a chance of hitting the big time.
Leeson lost Barings hundreds of millions of pounds by gambling on a contract
linked to share prices on Tokyo's Nikkei index.
The multi-billion pound global derivatives business came about when
stockbrokers were dreaming up new ways of increasing business in the late 1980s
after the world stock market crash of 1987.
Derivatives are very highly geared - each pound of investment can carry #20 of
risk or more. And they are complex - many bank directors are said not to
understand what the young dealers in their employ are doing.
Many City observers say that futures markets have been in business longer than
traditional stock markets, which is trade based on the current price of shares.
It is thought that trading in rice futures in Japan began centuries ago and
many believe they can play a useful role.
Commodity futures, for example, allow a farmer to fix the price for his crops
in advance.
Those in favour of derivatives say they can help offset risk in an increasingly
volatile market.

n I LOVE beautifully dressed toddlers, velvets and muffs flatter the demon
underneath. Girls are great when they're wee; well-dressed and badly behaved,
and some of them don't grow out if it.
These children, however, aged between nine months and 10 years, are in
sartorial chains. They were photographed outside Stratford-Upon-Avon where, the
adults say, ``they had lots of fun'' carol-singing Deck The Halls With Boughs
of Holly, We Wish You A Merry Christmas and On Christmas Day In The Morning.
The whole scenario smells of bossy parents, for only a starstruck mum would
bother disciplining a toddler to learn the words to Good King Wenceslas.
Other instances of human cruelty on the photo shoot include a spot of
gardening. Yes, they were indeed ``gathering winter fuel". The girls picked
``pine cones and twigs'' in their floral dresses, while the boys ``pushed the
wheelbarrows'' in Venetian trousers and white shirts. What a lot of work to
portray a picture of gentrified countryside indolence.

OVER the course of a dozen years, Edinburgh-born skier John Vaitkus has slowly
become one of skiing's more familiar faces. Captured in spectacular action for
the pages of ski magazines and videos across the world, his profile is
instantly recognisable. His neat, technically precise skiing mixes control with
absurd dynamics and at 37 he remains in demand as one of an elite breed of
international skier.
Paradoxically for all his globe-spanning exposure to ski enthusiasts of all
standards, he remains almost entirely anonymous. Vaitkus has lived in Chamonix
for more than 10 years and has the unmatched snowfields, challenging couloirs
and cornices as his daily ``office'' routine, making his living as one of
Europe's leading ski models.
It's a remarkable existence and a success story which has outlasted the
hundreds of pretty-boy rich-kid Europeans, Antipodeans and Americans who
gravitate to photographic meccas such as Chamonix for a post-ski racing
pre-college rite of passage - if they're lucky earning beer money and perhaps a
few glossy enlargements of a once-in-a-lifetime leap.
``Over the past few years it has become crazy out here. There are kids who are
prepared to fling themselves off anything without a second thought just to get
themselves on to film. It's amazing that, as yet, there's been no real tragedy,
but it's waiting to happen,'' says Vaitkus, who has worked with most of
Europe's top photographers, but now chooses only to work mostly as a close-knit
team, with those who sympathise with his working methods and ethics.
``It's come to the stage where photographers demand more and more, not because
they've shot it all perfectly before, but because they want to make up for
their technical shortcomings by getting kids to do bigger more radical jumps
and that's stupid.''
Vaitkus points to the exploits of the mohawk-styled American stunt skier Glen
Plake and Scott Schmidt; and also producer Greg Stump whose enormous video
sales have made them ski-household names. Their exploits become simply
run-of-the-mill, swelling this lemming-like exodus to the mountains to jump
higher and further in pursuit of celluloid glory.
His stock in trade has been stills and video work in advertisements and
promotions for leading worldwide manufacturers such as Salomon and Tenson,
while in the UK one of the most comprehensive annual collections of Vaitkus in
action is featured in the retail chain Ellis Brigham's weighty, glossy
mail-order bible The White Book in which he has starred for a number of years.
The world recession in the ski market coupled with the fast-growing influx of
do-it-for-nothing thrill seekers has made it all the tougher. He reflects that
five years ago a mere 20 days of work early in the season was more than enough
to keep body and soul intact for the year. Now now he is increasingly being
forced to exploit other avenues in paragliding and climbing.
Those who hire him rank him among only a handful of successful, totally
dedicated European ski-action models. While his contemporaries have almost
universally Alpine or Scandinavian backgrounds, born in the mountains,
Vaitkus's enduring passion for the sport started on the dry-slope matting of
Hillend as one of the first Edinburgh comprehensive school kids taught to ski
as part of the curriculum.
He too may have served his apprenticeship on the race circuits in the winter,
but he also bummed in the summer skiing resorts, living in a beaten-up Renault
6 for three months just to ski every day.
His teenage potential was rewarded as one of the first recipients of the Boyd
Anderson scholarship, which was awarded by the benefactor who granted much of
the land Hillend is sited on. It was for less privileged kids who needed to get
racing and training on snow. He went on to become a respected coach to British
Alpine Racing Clubs but gave up when, he says, he really felt he couldn't look
British children in the eye and tell them they really could go on to win World
Cups.
``Racing's a vital background for what I do now. It requires at least
centimetre if not millimetre precision every time, just as it's needed when you
make a turn for a top photographer who expects you to keep the skis' logos
perfectly framed - even when you're dropping in on a big cornice -- so I guess
all those wet nights at Hillend must be worth something now!''
Most of all he feels the new crop of bone-headed daredevils are simply missing
the point, trading only on the freefalling seconds of big air - not that he
doesn't still yearn for the same regular adrenalin fix and will take the
scariest of drops in his stride, but his is a craft which has been honed
through winter and summer months in Chamonix.
``Now I always know the risks exactly, intuitively. I'll have flown the slopes
through the summer paragliding, or climbed them, and know the likely conditions
for any given weather pattern. We set out to minimise the risks. I want to do
this for a lifetime, not to have to give it up tomorrow. What most of these
kids are losing out on is the whole mountain experience.''
Vaitkus has turned director, teaming up with fellow skier Roger Lambert and
Swedish cameraman Lars Pykto to make their second film over a six-week period
last spring. The Long Way Down records an inspirational descent from a 4000m
peak above Chamonix dropping 6000ft of vertical, down through the tree line
towards the valley floor.
Avoiding the cliches of endless cliff jumps and wipeouts, it concentrates
instead on stunning scenery and dangerous descents in areas never skied before.
With a budget of around #15,000 it reputedly challenges even the multi-million
dollar productions of Warren Miller.
At one point in shooting Vaitkus dropped on to a 45-degree untouched face only
to find the six inches of new snow slide away from underneath him to reveal a
sheer wall of glacial blue ice.
``My first thought was that my only means of survival, my ice axe, was on my
pack but fortunately I had brand new skis on and the razor sharp edges gripped
until I managed to get my pack off and sort myself out.''
In the immediate future the trio will be skiing to earn their keep but looking
for funding for their next film project. A job which, says Vaitkus, is a much
more daunting mountain to conquer

THE United Kingdom Agricultural Supply Trade Association has approved 69 forage
additives which are recognised as being capable of improving at least one
aspect of UK silage making. The scheme sets out in which of nine separate
categories silage additives are approved.
Mr Tony Baldry, Minister of State for Agriculture, has welcomed the creation of
a UK-wide register of products which gives livestock farmers up-to-date,
independent information on approved additives.
``The silage additives industry has become increasingly important,'' he said.
``Far more sophisticated products have been developed, which allow not only for
a high degree of control over the fermentation process but also other benefits
such as increased liveweight gain for beef cattle and improved milk output for
dairy cows.''
He praised the UKASTA scheme as a good example of self-regulation by industry.

A PANEL of five judges ruled yesterday that incompetent legal representation
can amount to a miscarriage of justice in Scots law.
In a landmark decision, the Court of Criminal Appeal brought the Scottish law
into line with legal systems in a number of other countries and overruled a
previous case which is nearly 50 years old.
The judges made it clear, however, that they were not opening the floodgates
and that an appeal over incompetence would succeed only where it had led to the
denial of a fair trial and a miscarriage of justice.
The appeal was brought by James Anderson, 44, who was jailed for three years
and nine months at the High Court in Glasgow for a serious assault and a Bail
Act offence.
He alleged that his solicitor-advocate had changed previously agreed tactics
without consultation and ignored instructions to attack the character of the
victim in the assault charge.
Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, who heard the appeal with Lord Justice
Clerk Ross, Lords Sutherland, Cameron and Johnston, said that in the case of
McCarroll in 1949 it had been decided that lack of skill or diligence in the
preparation or conduct of a defence could not be pleaded as a miscarriage of
justice.
Both the Lord Advocate and defence counsel for Anderson agreed that McCarroll
should now be overruled.
Lord Hope said the starting point for an examination of the whole issue was the
right to a fair trial - an essential principle for any system of criminal
justice. Part of that was that an accused should have his defence presented to
the court.
The right to a fair trial should not be viewed as involving a right to a
retrial simply because things might have been done differently by an accused's
counsel or his solicitor.
However, the decision in McCaroll's case seemed to mean that even if the
conduct of counsel or the solicitor deprived the accused of the right to a fair
trial by not presenting his defence, the court could not interfere on the
ground that there had been a miscarriage of justice.
``We regard that proposition as unacceptable,'' Lord Hope said.
The court was referred to cases from England, New Zealand, South Africa, The
USA, Canada and Australia, countries which all recognise the right of the court
to intervene if a fair trial has been denied by the incompetency of counsel.
Lord Hope said counsel's independence must be preserved if he was to fulfil his
duty to the court and act in the public interest. He could not disregard his
client's instructions, but the way in which he conducted the defence within
those instructions was a matter for him.
Therefore, the circumstances in which an appeal would be allowed on the grounds
of inept legal representation must be narrowly defined.
``The conduct must be such as to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. It
can only be said to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice if it has
deprived the accused of his right to a fair trial.
``That can only be said to have occurred when the conduct was such that the
accused's defence was not presented to the court.''
In Anderson's case, the appeal court ruled that there had been no miscarriage
of justice and his appeal must be refused.
Lord Hope said the solicitor-advocate who conducted the defence at the trial
had been fully justified in not attacking the character of the victim in the
assault charge.
Lord Hope added: ``The criticisms which have been made of the
solicitor-advocate in this case fall far short of an allegation that he
deprived Anderson of his right to a fair trial.''
Mr Alan Boyd, President of the Law Society of Scotland, commented: ``Legal
representation must be of an acceptable standard, particularly where an
individual's liberty is at stake.''

AN armed robber who staged a hold-up at an off-licence weeks after his release
from prison was jailed for six years yesterday.
Brian Dick, 28, managed to get #209 cash from a woman employee by threatening
her with a wine bottle.
However, Dick, of Crewe Road Gardens in Edinburgh, did not escape from the
premises and was still there when police arrived to answer an alert.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that the raider had been given separate
sentences of three and five years for armed robbery. He had only been freed
from his last prison term weeks before he staged the robbery at Victoria Wine,
in Dalry Road, Edinburgh, on October 26 this year.
The Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Ross, told him he had to take account of his
previous record and added: ``My principle concern must be the protection of the
public.''
Dick admitted assaulting the woman employee by threatening her with a bottle
and robbing her of the money.
He also pled guilty to resisting arrest and struggling violently with police
and was given a further three months in prison.
Advocate depute James Campbell said that after browsing in the shop, Dick
picked up a wine bottle and told the employee: ``All the money out of the
till.''
After he was handed the cash he demanded tape from a security camera.
But other customers arrived at the store and the shopworker managed to press a
panic button.
His defence, solicitor-advocate Ray Megson said that Dick had committed the
offence on ``the spur of the moment''.
He said Dick could give no real explanation for failing to escape from the shop
after he was given the money.

ROY FULLER: Writer and Society
Neil Powell
Carcanet, #25. SOME poets live dangerously and we love them for it, love Burns
for his boozing and Byron for his battling and Berryman for his battling and
boozing. These reckless, self-sacrificial poets seem authentic to a reading
public suspicious of the creative credentials of Wallace Stevens who became
vice-president of the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company; and Roy Fuller
who became vice-president of the Building Societies Association and a governor
of the BBC.
In 1968 I was one of those foolish enough to run against Fuller in the election
for the post of Oxford Professor of Poetry. Fuller, who described himself as
the Conservative candidate, was the obvious man for the establishment.
Nominated by Auden and Day Lewis - old leftists who had left old beliefs behind
as they lurched to the right - he had impeccable social credentials as the
senior solicitor of the Woolwich Equitable Building Society. Fuller was duly
elected, easily beating Enid Starkie, Yevtushenko, Al Alvarez, Kathleen Raine
and yours truly.
Recalling this event, Neil Powell notes: ``Oxford's academic establishment
breathed an almost unanimous sigh of relief on finding that its most public
literary honour had landed in such capably safe hands''.
Although he flirted with Marxism and sold the Daily Worker on the streets of
Blackpool in the 1930s, Fuller was always a safety-firster. It was fashionable
for English poets - Auden and Day Lewis and Spender - to make Marxist noises in
the 1930s and Fuller simply followed the fashion. After Margaret Thatcher made
her marks on British society, Fuller described himself as ``an old bull of the
right''. He took pride in meeting Her Majesty and when the Queen asked him what
he thought of Ted Hughes (destined to become Poet Laureate) he replied: ``Well,
he certainly looks like a poet.''
Fuller himself looked like a safety-firster although he attempted to add a dash
of danger when describing himself in his novel Image of a Society (1956): ``His
face was very smooth, his pallor had an orange tinge: against it the moustache
seemed incongruously luxuriant and brown.'' Smooth is the essential epithet.
After a stretch in a private practice as a solicitor, Fuller joined the
Woolwich in 1938. The year after that he established himself as an acolyte of
Auden in his first collection, Poems; and the year after that he prepared to go
to the war in which he served as a radar mechanic in East Africa then as a
radio and radar officer at the Admiralty in London. In 1942 he published his
second collection, The Middle of a War, and this remains the most impressive
artistic achievement of all his slim volumes and 10 novels.
The title poem of The Middle of a War is a self-portrait of the artist as a
young fogey: ``My photograph already looks historic./The promising youthful
face, the matelot's collar,/Say `This one is remembered for a lyric./His place
and period - nothing could be duller'. '' Fuller roughly rhymes with ``duller''
and knew he could not equal the intensity of the Great War Poets of the past,
Owen and others who died in action. Fuller was, however, good enough to win the
approval of safe old Spender who favourably reviewed The Middle of a War and
wrote of its author as ``the only poet who has given us as clear a picture of
the life of the Forces as some of the war artists have done in painting''.
Surviving the war - ``Incredibly I lasted out a war,/Survived the unnatural,
enormous danger'' claimed the poet, though Powell claims ``given the cushy good
fortune of his wartime career his survival was not really incredible at all'' -
Fuller returned to his safe job with the Woolwich and Powell points out that he
carefully avoided contact with the literary louts of London. He continued to
write poems, of course, but he also displayed his professional expertise in
Questions and Answers in Building Society Law and Practices (1949).
Powell sees Fuller as a man who carefully cultivated the two contrasting
aspects of his personality - a bit of a professional bore yet also a practising
bard who reached ``greatness'' in his poem The Ides of March, from Brutus's
Orchard (1957). The Ides of March is a statement of Fuller's paradoxical
position, his ``romantic, classic situation''.
Fuller's poems always define his existence as a dilemma, a matter of living
with classy (rather than classic) comforts while longing for some meaningful
romantic quest. He is always writing about himself, even when assuming roles as
in Translation from Counterparts (1954). Supposedly speaking as Cinna, the poet
from Julius Caesar, Fuller sticks to the same old subject of himself: ``I will
stop expressing my belief in the rosy/Future of man . . . When they call me
reactionary I shall smile,/Secure in another dimension . . . The ruling class
will think I am on their side/And make friendly overtures, but I shall retire/."
The fiction of Fuller is similarly autobiographical. Having read Counterparts,
Robert Graves wrote to Fuller: ``But what a world you live in! . . . Your
solicitor's job doesn't sound very thrilling.'' Fuller responded by writing a
novel, Image of a Society, about life as lived in a building society in a plot
that turns upon the overvaluing of a property and the casual construction of a
mortgage document.
Featured in the novel is Fuller himself in the image of Philip Witt, a building
society solicitor who writes on the side. Witt, as Powell accurately puts it,
is ``a self divided between a career which he despises and a literary ambition
in which he lacks confidence''. The Woolwich was not amused and Fuller was told
to hold his tongue on the subject of building societies. He did as he was told.
``I would like to renounce the waking rational life,'' wrote Fuller in
Counterparts: ``I would like to resolve to live fully/In the barbarous world of
sympathy and fear.'' He never did. He did his professional duty and he died, in
Powell's opinion, as an unfairly neglected poet. Powell is an admirer of Fuller
but aware of his flaws and his ``divided self's wishful thinking, inventing a
purely hypothetical alter ego''. Powell is to be applauded for his controlled
enthusiasm and for describing one man's struggle to reconcile creativity with
careerism. Career, in this case, came first.

Jim Hewitson recalls how a fair maid's
name got in the way
of a good battle
DRUMS were beating, banners flying in the breeze and everything was set for the
Battle of Falkirk, 1578 vintage. But you'll search the histories in vain for
details of this stramash because it's one of the very few battles I can trace
in the history of Scotland which was called off at the eleventh hour - with the
teams lined up and the referee's whistle to his lips, if you'll pardon the
Brockville analogy.
So many dire conflicts and so much bloodshed permeate the pages of Scottish
history that it's a delight to come across a battle which was abandoned with
opposing armies squaring up to each other on the field, a day which ended not
with a roll-call of the dead and maimed but with troops trudging home to the
wife and weans and their ain fireside. Surely, only the psychopaths were
disappointed.
Although on July 25, 1578, the young King James VI had taken the reins of
government, the former Regent, the Earl of Morton, was still effectively
running the show. He had been throwing his weight around to such an extent (for
example, persuading the King to switch a meeting of parliament to Stirling from
Edinburgh where he felt safer) that he had angered a large section of the
Scottish nobility including Argyle, Athole, Montrose, Lyndsay, Ogilvie,
Maxwell, and Herries.
Licking their wounds in Edinburgh this disaffected crew latched on to (or
possibly originated) a story which was certainly doing the rounds (although
later publicly denied by James) suggesting that the King wished to be freed
from the clutches of Morton. Many of Edinburgh's citizens were irked at the
removal of the parliament to Stirling and so there was no difficulty getting
together a force which, commanded by the Earls of Athole and Argyle, left the
capital on August 11 and was supplemented on its arrival at Falkirk until it
was 7000-strong.
Some nice historical detail is available. We learn that among their banners was
a silk affair displayed by the men of Merse and Teviotdale on which was painted
a boy ahint bars with the motto - ``Liberty I crave, and cannot it have'' and
beneath it the answer of the soldiers that they would die to set him free.
In the crazy politics of the time Morton's party, of course, also claimed to be
acting both in the King's name and for his welfare and had gathered a force of
some 5000 men which although outnumbered had superiority in cavalry and a host
of experienced soldiers.
Drawn up to face each other at Falkirk, a desperate conflict looked on the
cards. However, a brief delay occurred when a Teviotdale man called Tait
challenged anyone in the Morton camp to ``break a lance with him'' in honour of
his mistress. The call was taken up by one James Johnston, a retainer of the
Master of Glamis. On a little plain beside the River Carron the joust took
place with all due ceremony. In the first tilt, Tait was run through by his
adversary's lance and fell dead from his horse.
However, this chivalrous hiatus had allowed Sir Robert Bowes, the English
ambassador, and two Edinburgh ministers, to pass between the armies and after
frenzied discussion a basis for a truce was identified and the forces
dispersed, at least for a wee while.
Just for the record, the two bona fide Battles of Falkirk were in 1298 (defeat
for William Wallace) and 1746 (victory for Bonnie Prince Charlie). One each -
extra time still being played.

<HEADLINE>MP tells court of economy in sharing beds</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975093889</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MPS sometimes sleep together on foreign trips to save money, Tory David Ashby
told the High Court yesterday.
Mr Ashby told the eighth day of his libel action against the Sunday Times it
was ``unimportant'' whether he had slept with a man or not and there had been
other times when he had had to share a bed with fellow MPs.
He said the fees office, which controls expenditure, will allow an MP only so
much and that as a consequence an MP may have to share with another member.
Mr Richard Hartley QC, for the Sunday Times, asked him to name the other MPs he
had slept with. Mr Ashby replied: ``I can't do that.''
He said, however, he would write down the names for the judge and jury.
Mr Ashby is claiming damages over an article published in the Sunday Times on
January 16, 1994, which said he shared a double bed with a male friend during a
holiday in Goa at the end of 1993.
He says it alleged that he was a homosexual who had misled his wife about the
nature of his sexuality; that he had lied to the public about having an affair
during a French holiday with a Dr Ciaran Kilduff; and that he was a hypocrite
in having emphasised the importance of the family in his last election address.
Times Newspapers Ltd and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil deny libel,
although they accept that Mr Ashby did not holiday with a man in Goa. They
assert that the MP was, and is, having an affair with 32-year-old Dr Kilduff.
Mr Ashby denied grabbing a carving knife or threatening to kill his wife during
a row at his constituency home in Ravenstone in June when she found him in the
company of a friend, retired civil servant Edward O'Byrne.
The jury watched extracts from a video tape of Mr Ashby arriving at and leaving
Dr Kilduff's flat in Westleigh Avenue, Putney, last August Bank Holiday.
The newspaper claims he stayed overnight while Mr Ashby says he left late on
the Monday and returned early on the Tuesday, but that was not recorded on
video.
Mr Ashby said the extracts showed him wearing different clothes and his car
parked in a different position.
Mr Hartley read out a letter from Mr Ashby to his wife, written some months
before the hearing in response to a letter from her warning that she would be
giving evidence for the newspaper if he persisted with the action.
Mr Ashby wrote that she was being ``taken for a ride'' by the Sunday Times.
He wrote that if he lost the case, he would be destroyed as a barrister and MP
and his means of keeping her would be gone.
Mr Ashby angrily told Mr Hartley that the letter was not an attempt to stop his
wife from giving evidence, but a bid to get some dignity back and give her some
respect amongst her fellows.
``Alastair Brett (Times Newspapers' in-house lawyer) was trying desperately to
break and has succeeded in breaking up what remains of my relationship with my
wife,'' Mr Ashby said.
``How dare you suggest otherwise. How dare you.''
The court adjourned briefly as Mr Ashby broke down.
Re-examining, Mr Ashby's counsel, Mr Geoffrey Shaw QC, asked if the five days
he had spent in the witness box had been a strain.
Mr Ashby responded, ``I can't say how much of a strain they have been. I think
the whole litigation, everything that has happened, I'll never forget it. I'll
live with it for the rest of my life. It's going to haunt me.''
``Do you relish speaking of these private matters?'' asked Mr Shaw.
``I've hated every moment,'' Mr Ashby replied.
Asked if he had been feeling unwell some of the time, Mr Ashby, who is diabetic
and has a heart condition, said it had been very difficult.
The hearing continues.

Drugs binge
leaves one
youth dead,
another ill
ONE teenager has died and another is seriously ill after a suspected drugs and
drink session went wrong.
Paul Flynn, 17, was found dead in his home in Dunsinane Drive, Letham, Perth,
yesterday morning. His best friend, Craig Low, 17, was found unconscious nearby.
Craig was rushed to the intensive care unit at Perth Royal Infirmary where last
night he was on the critical list.
His parents kept a bed-side vigil as their son was maintained on a life support
machine. Their son's condition was described as ``touch and go''.
The dead boy's parents, John and Evelyn Flynn, were being comforted by
relatives last night.
The boys had spent Thursday evening together at Paul's house and detectives are
building up a picture of what happened in the hours before Paul's death.
A police spokesman said: ``We are investigating the sudden death of a Perth
teenager found dead at his home this morning.
``Detectives and forensic officers are conducting a full examination of the
relevant locations and inquiries are continuing into the cause of the death.''
The matter is being treated as a drugs-related death but it will take two weeks
for toxicology reports to confirm drug abuse.
It is suspected the boys had been taking Methadone.
Paul is survived by a brother, Steven, eight.

n MIDWINTER on the Ythan, and a shocking pink dawn over the black dunes. Ice
floes hush against the banks, borne inland on a rising tide. Long-tailed ducks
flight in from their roosts offshore, laying the arctic sky on to the river
where they settle.
They make vees on the moving water, then dive, then flight again, calling out
the winter's necessities in a romantic yodel: ``Coal and Candlelight''. Of all
the transliterations of their call, this old name evokes most strongly the
frosty northern coasts where they winter.
It is only since the 1970s that we have found out how many ``Caloos'', as they
are known in the northern isles, winter with us. A great roost was found off
Burghead, ten or 15 thousand strong, too far out to be seen from land. In Scapa
Flow they roost likewise in the centre, where the German sailors must have
heard them in winter of 1919. By day they scatter in little parties off the
coast, diving for molluscs longer and deeper than any other duck: a minute at a
time and well over a hundred feet down.
Off any sandy shore from Barra round to Bellhaven you could pick out twos and
fours through binoculars. They look white against a blue sea, but closer you
see a patchwork pattern of browns and blacks. In flight the long, pointed
tailfeathers show which give them the fowler's name ``sea-pheasant''. By April
you will see bigger parties on the lochs and bays of Orkney, now moulted to a
darker brown with white cheeks. By the Churchill Barriers they perform a rich
repertoire of bowing, stretching, twisting, splashing displays, pairing for the
long flight to the arctic. They look like a different species then, until you
hear that unforgettable, musical cry.
As a child, on first looking into the Observer's Book of Birds, the prints of
the long-tailed ducks, with a wild northern shore behind, held me spellbound.
Every time I see them again, or hear their ``Coal and Candlelight'', the spell
is woven anew.

A MAN murdered a mother and her five young children in a fire which engulfed
the bedroom they were sharing, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Scott Vowls, 24, had quarrelled with the woman's brother with whom he had
earlier shared the flat, alleged Mr David Calvert-Smith, prosecuting at the Old
Bailey.
He returned to his former flat, took hold of a double mattress, and left it
``outside what he thought was the man's bedroom. He deliberately set fire to
it,'' Mr Calvert-Smith said.
``The result is hard to contemplate. It was a single, terrifying and terrible
incident.''
Mr Vowls, a barman, of Bermondsey, south London, has denied murdering Mrs Judy
Newell, 35, and her five children, aged between one and seven years, at the
flat on the Longfield Estate, Bermondsey, in January.
The prosecution alleged that Mr Vowls had moved into the flat in July, 1994,
with Mrs Newell's brother and another man, but in January moved out after a
quarrel with the brother. Mr Calvert-Smith said: ``We say Vowls kept his key.''
He left a mattress and a bag containing some clothes in his room. Less than
three weeks later Mrs Newell moved in with her five children, Nathan, seven,
Cassandra, six, Ashley, four, Courtnay, three, and Curtis, one.
Mr Calvert-Smith said the brother moved out to accommodate them. ``The family
slept in his bedroom.
``Vowls returned at midnight two days later, retrieved his clothes and left
them on an outside balcony.''
He then went back inside and ``deliberately set fire to the double mattress'',
alleged Mr Calvert-Smith.
A man sleeping in the lounge was able to escape by climbing over a balcony. The
father of Mrs Newell's children, who had recently separated from her, was first
suspected of starting the blaze.
``There were allegations that he had ill-treated her. But as investigations
progressed it became clear from circumstantial evidence surrounding the case
that Vowls and he alone must have been responsible for the killings.''
Mr Vowls was a loner who often drank in a local pub, Mr Calvert-Smith said.
He had left the flat after arguing with Mrs Newell's brother.
``It was the sort of argument people in flats have - about untidiness and
making a proper contribution to the electricity bill,'' Mr Calvert-Smith said.
The trial continues.

HE ARRIVED in Scotland with a reputation that suggested he was only marginally
less menacing than Don Corleone, a football hit-man whose temper was as short
as his closely cropped hair, yet Pasquale Bruno exudes Mediterranean charm, not
to mention dark looks, which, I hear tell, has ladies buckling at the knees.
Bruno, who has quickly established himself as a favourite with Hearts fans, is
disarmingly frank about his image as a hard man, just as he quite freely talks
about his observations of Scotland, Edinburgh, and football in this country.
The fact that, in the main, he is complimentary ought not to be taken as too
significant, either, because the impression this hardened, experience but
likeable pro gives is of a man who would not hesitate with a criticism, just as
he doesn't hang about with his tackles.
So far, the new man likes much of what he has seen and has had no problems at
all in fitting in with the capital lifestyle. Partly, this is due to his
discovery that Scotland is predominantly a wintry but welcoming extension of
the old country itself. ``There are so many Italians here,'' he says, with the
expressive gesture that has not fooled a referee for years. ``Restaurant owners
and waiters and people like that - it is not so different.''
Bruno, who has two cousins in Hamilton, a privlege he probably shares with much
of the Italian population, was born in Lecce on the Mediterranean coast, where
he learned and began his pro football career with the local Serie B team.
A four-year spell with Lecce was followed by four at Como in Serie A, then
Juventus for three years, Torino for three years, and finally Fiorentina for
the past couple of seasons.
It is a career that was signposted with major successes, particularly for
Juventus in the UEFA Cup of 1991, when they also won the Italian Cup, and city
rivals Torino, where the club were to reach the final of the same competition
but lost to Ajax. There were other winning medals but also a perceived
toughness that earned him a much larger collection of yellow and red cards.
Ask him how many and he will shrug and say: ``I do not know, honestly.'' Press
him a little and he will confess that he did miss a total of 50 games because
of suspension. When I responded in astonishment, the old Latin humour surfaced
as he put his head in hands in mock shame.
Bruno, none the less, seriously refutes the hard-man charge, insisting that
there are far tougher characters in the Italian game. ``The problem for me,''
he says in English that may not be perfect but is creditable - ``I want to
learn it better here'' - ``was that I had become known as a tough guy. Referees
knew who I was and if I fouled someone I could be sent off, when another player
could do the same foul and nothing happen.'' All of these remarks are
accompanied by expressive hand movements that leaves the interviewer astounded
that he didn't convince any referee that canonisation was imminent.
``They call me ``The Animal' but this is not true. There are many harder
players than me in Italy. `The Animal' stays with me and referees get to know,
and they see me make fouls, but not others.''
Pasquale's popularity with the Gorgie Road aficionados has not been based on
the macho image, more on the Italian's ability to read games, allied to an
incisive and accurate tackling skill. There are not too many ordinary players
in Serie A and certainly not one who survived so many years in its heat. Bruno
can play. That is for sure.
In Scotland to date he has still managed to pick up two yellow cards and it
would be a brave man who would predict he will steer clear of Park Gardens
during his 18-month contract with Hearts. However, the man himself has been
comfortable with many aspects of the Scottish game. ``Here, if I tackle a
player and he goes down, he gets up again right away. In Italy he rolls around
and around for minutes. That is why I like it here.
``The game here is tough and strong, but fair. People are not diving or
pretending. I like that. Also, the game is on for 90 minutes, not like Italy,
where there is so much time lost for injuries and other time-wasting. In Italy
a game lasts one hour.''
This is not to say he is uncritical of the game he has joined. ``Sometimes the
long ball is a good idea but other times you have to pass the ball about from
the back.''
He arrived at Tynecastle aware of Hearts' contribution to the Scottish game.
Joe Jordan, who seems to be universally popular in Italy, told him all about
the Edinburgh club, as well as the delights of the city. ``Edinburgh is a
beautiful place. My wife Marcella and I like it very much.'' His older
daughter, 11-year-old Sandra, has stayed with his sister in Florence ``because
she likes the school'' but young Marta, who is five, is in Scotland.
``The Scottish people are different from the English. They are very friendly,
warm, like the people in the Mediterranean where I come from. The fans have
been good to me. They are passionate, like the Torino and Fiorentina supporters.
``I want also to help the young players at Hearts to develop. Scottish football
must improve its organisation and skills because you saw the different class
when Juventus met Rangers. It is maybe not so bad when teams from abroad come
to Scotland but when they go to Italy, say, the teams there have so many
top-class players and technique that it is difficult.
``I think British football could become leaders again and I hope so, because it
is so important for the people here.''
Perhaps his remarks about the English would have been readjusted if he had
moved to Manchester City a few years ago, when they were keen to bring him from
Italy. ``It was always my dream to play in British football one day but it
didn't happen with Manchester City or Crystal Palace, who also had been
interested. The problem then was that I was earning too much money and they
could not pay so much.'' It was at that time he spoke to Paul Gascoigne, then
with Lazio, to get the Manchester City picture, but he also played against him,
and knows and admires the Rangers player's talent.
``I also played against Laudrup and Mikhailichenko when they were in Italy.''
He will meet two or maybe three of them again this afternoon at Tynecastle when
he knows his side are in for a hard afternoon. ``Rangers are rich and can get
the top players but in football you never know. I think we can do a good
result.''
The fact that he has scarcely had an injury in his 16 years as a professional
has meant that this 33-year-old may have more miles on the clock left than most
of his contemporaries. He is not sure what will happen when his contract runs
out. ``I know that Jim Jefferies and the chairman want to build a good team and
if that happens, I may stay a long time. Who knows?'' The shoulders shrug
again. ``I don't want to be a coach when I finish playing, maybe a general
manager.''
In the meantime, the old Med charmer will get on with his business, proving
that he has a lot of talent still going for him. He wouldn't deny he likes the
going when it gets tough, which might be reflected in the player has most
admired. ``Gentile was my favourite.'' If memory serves me right, that old
Italian star turn was able to look after himself, too.

AGRICULTURE Minister Douglas Hogg was last night coming under increasing
pressure to tighten ``mad cow disease'' regulations after a leading brain
scientist warned that humans could be at risk.
Shadow Agriculture Minister Gavin Strang echoed Professor Sir Bernard
Tomlinson's call for beef offals to be banned from the food chain.
Earlier Sir Bernard, a neuropathologist and medical adviser to the Government,
warned that ``mad cow disease'' - bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -
could be transmitted to humans. His warning came after reports at least three
farmers and three teenagers have been struck down by the human equivalent of
BSE - Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).
And Mr Strang says many people, who might not have been worried about BSE in
the past, will have been alarmed by a warning from a scientist of Sir Bernard's
standing.
``A lot of people are going to listen to him,'' said Mr Strang. ``Up to now the
Government has been saying that any possible link between the two diseases is
remote. I don't think that description can be justified any more.''
The Government continues to stress that there is no proven link between BSE and
CJD and says the numbers of cases of BSE are falling year on year.

By Our Political Correspondent
THE Prime Minister said last night that he fully anticipated there would be
another Budget before the next General Election - and that he looked forward to
several more years in power.
``This Parliament can go on towards the middle of 1997. I see no reason for it
to be foreshortened, so I would expect another Budget next November,'' he told
Channel 4 News.
Asked about the prospect of another five years in office, he replied: ``I very
much hope so. Yes, indeed.''
Earlier, when he addressed the Tory women's conference in London, Mr Major said
he was ``proud'' of this week's Budget.
He said that he and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke had resisted calls to take risks
or bribe the electorate because that would have been wrong for Britain.
``The British people have worked too hard, sacrificed too much to achieve the
excellent prospects that lie ahead for us to even consider putting it at risk.
We are not that sort of Government,'' he said.
However, he forecast: ``In time 20p will become the basic rate''.
Many Tories are now pinning their hopes on the Chancellor getting close to that
target next year in another Budget
At the women's conference, Mr Clarke made a robust defence of his Budget,
promising that the tax cuts would not be reversed and that there were more to
come.
After a muted reaction from voters and business to what he himself has called a
prudent rather than an exciting Budget, Mr Clarke was out to convince that it
was just the first step in a tax and interest rate-cutting year to come.
Mr Clarke said his Budget would help win the next election because it was ``a
platform for lasting prosperity for individuals, their families and business''.
Referring to the criticism of the Budget, he said he stood accused this week of
the ``dreadful crime'' of honesty, responsibility and financial rectitude.
However, he insisted: ``The British people would not have been much impressed
by unsustainable tax cuts that were not affordable, or were branded as some
kind of electoral bribe.
``As a Conservative Chancellor, I don't believe in some mythical money tree
from which I can pick imaginary fivers and tenners.''
However, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, speaking in his Dunfermline
constituency, claimed that the Budget was ``unravelling with every day that
passes''.
He listed hidden charges coming into force which would wipe out the effect of
the tax cut ``almost before it has come into peoples's hands''.
Mr Brown cited the council tax, postal charges, increased TV licences, rail and
London Underground fare increases, school meals, milk rises, higher dental and
NHS charges, with raised prescription charges to come, the petrol rise and the
road tax increase.
Far from being prudent, he said, Mr Clarke was ``prisoner of failure, now
paralysed into inaction hoping something will turn up''.
Mr Brown indicated that Labour was considering subjecting the privatised
utilities not just to a windfall tax when it came to power but to compulsory
rebates to consumers.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, speaking in Bristol , called the Budget
``a smoke and mirrors con trick.''
The Government was borrowing to fund tax cuts to try to save their skins and
the next election, he said.
The promised extra money for education did not even cover rising pupil numbers,
the cost of inflation and pay rises for teachers.
Mr Ashdown again challenged Labour to join his party in voting against the
income tax cuts in the Commons on Tuesday at the end of the Budget debate.

SCOTTISH local authority leaders meeting in Stirling yesterday warned that the
Government's clampdown on capital spending announced in the Budget would have a
devastating impact on their building programmes and on jobs in the construction
industry.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has estimated that the new
restrictions will mean the loss of #100m of potential capital investment for
schools and road-building in Scotland next year.
Cosla's Labour vice-president Councillor Keith Geddes, who leads the new City
of Edinburgh Council, said he very much doubted that if the new rules had been
in force projects like the Edinburgh Festival Theatre and the new Edinburgh
International Conference Centre could have been undertaken.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has told the new single-tier councils that
next year they will have to use 25% of their capital receipts to pay off their
growing capital debt. That sum is due to double the following year and could
increase even further if debt totals are not reduced greatly
In addition, he intends to severely reduce the amount of current revenue
councils can spend on capital projects.
Councillor Geddes said it was no use Mr Forsyth offering councils more freedom
over their capital spending priorities on the one hand - as also announced this
week - while at the same time imposing such draconian curbs on the amount which
could be invested .
The powers Mr Forsyth was planning to return to councils in some areas paled
into insignificance compared with the new powers he had taken over capital
spending, he said.
Council leaders now intend to have discussions with construction industry heads
and trade unions.
Councillor Geddes said he believed they were also genuinely concerned that the
clampdown would lead to huge reductions in new building programmes by councils
alone or in partnership with others and, therefore, to job losses.
The Scottish Secretary has said if councils were prepared to enter into
partnerships with the private sector on more capital projects this should more
than offset the effects of the changes he was imposing.
However, Councillor Geddes said it had to be recognised that joint ventures
under the Private Finance Initiative still had to be paid for from somewhere.
Council leaders also are ``gravely concerned'' at the effect of the tight
capping limits imposed on Scottish local authorities in the budget settlement
for next year.
At yesterday's meeting, they warned that if they only increased spending by
0.8% over what the Government believed they should be spending the public would
face service cuts and increases in charges. Council jobs also could go.
Between now and Cosla's next meeting with the Scottish Secretary on January 19,
the new councils have been asked to produce figures showing by just how much
they will have to cut spending to reach their capping limit and what sort of
services are likely to be hit.
The Convention also decided yesterday to press ahead with its plan to set up an
independent commission to examine the future of local government finance.
Cosla vice-president Councillor Peter Peacock, convener of the new Highland
Council, said he hoped the Scottish Office would decide to co-operate with the
setting up of a commission.
The Convention now plans to look for people prepared to serve on the proposed
body.
Councillor Peacock said it was time to recognise that the council tax was
inadequate as a means of financing local authority spending. He said the
commission would prepare a report which would be presented to the Scottish
Grand Committee and/or a Scottish parliament.

A BUSINESSMAN who employed children as young as 14 to work 12-hour shifts in
his bread-making factory was yesterday ordered to pay a total of #40,500 in
fines and costs.
Managing director William Eid employed two 14-year-old boys and one 15-year-old
to work in his Leicester factory, which manufactured speciality breads for
large companies.
One child was told to use the dough-cutting machine without the guard down,
exposing him to the blades, because it increased productivity, Leicester Crown
Court heard.
``All employees, including the children, were exposed to electric hazards in
the building which could have led them to receive lethal shocks,'' said Miss
Caroline Knight, prosecuting.
Eid, 31, of West Heath Gardens, Hampstead, London, was also disqualified for
three years from being a director of his firm, Balaika Ltd, of Chartwell Drive,
Wigston, Leicestershire, which used to trade as Honeytop Foods.
He admitted three charges of employing under-age children and eight breaches of
Health and Safety regulations concerning an unsafe electrical system and
unguarded machinery.
Eid was fined #7500 and ordered to pay #5000 costs. On behalf of the company he
was fined #18,000 and ordered to pay #10,000 costs for the Health and Safety
breaches.
Mr Simon Readhead, defending, said Eid was not a man who couldn't care less
about his workforce.
He blamed a female supervisor for employing the children to work in the factory.
``His plea is based on his failure to intervene or double check for himself the
ages of these children,'' said Mr Readhead.
Judge Christopher Young told Eid that the Victorian days when young children
could be exploited had long since gone.

NEW Circuit Engineering has come a long way in 10 years. In 1985 John Kirkwood
was in his garage, identifying faults and adapting standard socket switch units
which welders were having difficulties with. (They were always short-circuiting
and exploding.) Now he is the managing director and driving force behind a
company with an annual turnover of #2.5m, a workforce of 43 and a 25,000 sq ft
factory in Maryhill, Glasgow.
New Circuit Engineering specialises in the design, manufacture, installation
and com- missioning of automatic control system and distribution switchgear. As
the larger of only two independent switchgear companies in Scotland, it has
bucked the economic trend to take an ever-increasing share of a shrinking
market.
Kirkwood believes an important reason for this it that its independence has
allowed it to be flexible in looking at customers' requirements. It aims to
offer a high-quality total solution to their problems, and to remain
competitive at the same time.
Kirkwood had been an electrical engineer with a large Japanese company. It was
his experience there that led him to see a gap in the market for a company
which could produce switchgear designed to meet customers' specific needs.
Having solved the welders' problems by re-designing and adapting their
mass-produced switchgear, he decided to launch NCE to manufacture switchgear to
the optimum specification for every customer. He moved into a unit in Yoker in
Glasgow with a colleague and two electrical wiremen.
Since then the company has grown steadily. Kirkwood maintains his approach to
the control of the business has been central to this. The management team keeps
a very close eye on every aspect - design of the equipment, production methods,
administration and, most significant, finance.
Right from the start, he saw the importance of making NCE a ``one-stop shop''.
This meant early investment in a facility to fabricate control panels as well
as building the casing and designing and manufacturing the electrical
switchgear.
Over the 10 years since, NCE has continued to invest in new plant and
equipment. Most recently the metalwork fabrication machines were linked to an
integrated CAD/CAM facility, while a sophisticated new paint plant enables it
to tackle almost any finish.
NCE's expansion has also been helped by taking over of a number of small
companies which were specialists in their own fields - metalwork fabricators,
painters and CNC engineers. The most recent acquisition was in 1994, when it
bought Harper Hillington Controls, which had a skilled team with experience in
sewage, water treatment, marine and other specialised areas.
Unusually, this steady expansion and solid capital investment has been funded
out of profits. Kirkwood believes this moderate approach to growth is one of
the key factors behind the company's strong position.
NCE has never borrowed and, as a result, can ride out dips in demand in a way
debtors cannot. Too many companies, he says, grow too big too quickly, build up
debt which has to be serviced, regardless of business cycles, and then collapse.
In fact, the management team has been very successful in spreading its market
base so slumps in demand do not occur. Its customers range from multi-national
chemical corporations, oil companies, offshore operators and the semi-conductor
industry, to regional and district councils, specialist water and sewage firms,
hospitals, the whisky industry and ScottishPower.
So, while NEC blazes a very successful trail in the UK, the future should see
its steady expansion into the direct export market, particularly to the Far and
Middle East.

PRESIDENT BILL Clinton set out his vision for a new Ireland last night, and won
praise from all sides for giving a massive boost to the peace process. In
Dublin, he drew 80,000 cheering people on to the streets to hear a passionate
plea for a lasting solution to the Troubles and an end to bloodshed.
He called on them to stand firm alongside Premier John Bruton as he took the
necessary risks in the search for peace.
And he won warm praise from Mr Major and Mr Bruton for his commitment to peace
in Ireland and received a standing ovation in the Irish parliament.
The first tangible signs of progress came with the despatch of invitations from
the British and Irish governments to Ulster's political parties to join
preliminary discussions aimed at leading to inclusive negotiations on the
future of the province.
Mr Clinton toasted his success with a glass of Irish stout in a Dublin pub
bearing his mother's maiden name, Cassidy. It was the high emotion of the
public rally in the city centre which encapsulated the mood of his historic
three-day visit to Britain and Ireland that forced a breakthrough in the
stalled peace talks.
Having received the freedom of the city, the President set out his vision for
the future and a new Ireland.
``I know well that the immigration from your country to the shores of mine
helped to make America great,'' he said.
``But I want more than anything for the young people of Ireland, wherever they
live on this island, to be able to live out their dreams close to their roots
in peace and honour and freedom and equality.''
His address was repeatedly interrupted by rousing cheers from the crowd, waving
US and Irish flags.
In a heartfelt plea to the Irish people, he said: ``The most important thing is
that we have more in common with people who appear on the surface to be
different from us than most of us know. And we have more to gain by reaching
out in a spirit of brotherhood
Cand sisterhood. That is the challenge the young people of this generation
face.''
Mr Clinton's deft path through the minefield of Irish politics was saluted by
the British and Irish leaders.
Mr Major said the cause of peace had received a ``huge boost'' from the first
trip by a serving US President to Northern Ireland.
In a keynote speech to the Tory Women's Conference in London, the Prime
Minister delivered a blunt message to the paramilitaries: ``People who mean
peace don't need guns.'' He said the time had come for paramilitaries to
``start ridding themselves of guns and explosives'' so all-party talks could
start.
Mr Clinton's key political engagement during his 24-hour stay in Ireland was a
private 40-minute meeting with Mr Bruton.
Mr Bruton openly admitted that the President's visit created the opportunity
for London and Dublin to reach a breakthrough agreement over the peace process.
``The ingredients for the agreement have been there for some time,'' he said.
``We both recognised that the President's visit was an opportunity for both of
us to launch in the best possible circumstances an initiative we were both
going to have to agree to shortly anyway.''
Later last night Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was sitting down to dine with Mr
Clinton. Mr Adams was among 300 people at a banquet hosted by Mr Bruton in
honour of the President at Dublin Castle.
Mr Major last night told Channel 4 News he was confident that the preparatory
talks with the parties would now go ahead following the issuing of formal
invitations by the two governments.9

<HEADLINE>Call for fast action on care in the community Alarming failures in health policy</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>2</EDITION>

ALARMING failures in community care for people with serious mental health
problems were revealed yesterday by an independent health watchdog.
Three years after health boards and social work departments in Scotland were
instructed to implement a care programme approach there is no evidence that the
policy has been implemented.
The findings in the annual report of the Scottish Health Advisory Service were
revealed at a conference in Edinburgh, where Health Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton announced a series of measures to answer the criticisms.
The policy was drawn up to ensure individual planned care and adequate back-up
facilities in the community for those with serious long-term mental illness,
including dementia, leaving hospital or already living outside.
It was also designed to avoid the horrific incidents in England where
schizophrenic patients had been discharged only to kill themselves or others.
SHAS director Donald Rankin said: ``This is a very worrying situation and
people have got to do something about it now.''
Although the absence of written individual care plans did not mean services
were shoddy, these were an essential discipline to ensure effective care and
support were actually delivered.
The SHAS conducted a survey of staff throughout the country but found a
worrying inconsistency in arrangements between boards and local authorities and
poor implementation in most areas of the whole care programme approach.
Dr Rankin said the problem was not financial but a failure to take on the
policy and implement it.
``My impression is that health boards have been waiting for social work to act
and social work has been waiting for the health boards to act,'' he said.
``The result is that after three years nothing has actually happened, but there
is now a very clear view from the Scottish Office that this has to get done.''
The SHAS findings come in the wake of earlier disquiet expressed by the
Scottish Association for Mental Health, the Mental Welfare Commission and the
Scottish Office social work group.
A review of community care policy was instigated by Mr Michael Forsyth after
his appointment as Scottish Secretary.
Lord James said the policy of caution over the introduction of community care
in Scotland had served the country well and would continue but at a more
measured pace.
``We have agreed that no hospital will close without agreed replacement
facilities and services being in place and properly resourced, and that no
person should be discharged from long-stay care without an agreed care plan
setting out arrangements for their support, care and accommodation,'' he said.
Lord James said the operation of the care programme approach would be assisted
by the experience of two pilot schemes now under way in Stirling and Glasgow.
``These will ensure that authorities do keep in touch with mentally ill people
and that services develop to provide necessary back-up, such as community
mental health teams and the availability of 24-hour on-call support,'' he added.
Lord James said the Government had long recognised community care was not a
cheap option.
``This scheme has been a valuable means of providing momentum for community
care, but now that momentum is established we want the emphasis to be on
achieving sound local agreements,'' he added.
Mr Robin Laing, director of the Scottish Association for Mental Health, gave a
broad welcome to the Minister's comments, but he said there was one glaring
flaw: he said the Scottish Office had, without consultation, frozen next year's
grant at #18m to provide community facilities and support for people with
mental illness.
``This grant has risen substantially in recent years to meet demand. Now it has
been frozen at a time when mental health has been declared a priority area.
With no increase, there will be no new developments at a time when they are
most needed,'' he said.
The SHAS report also criticises hospital discharge procedures for the elderly
and calls for a radical re-appraisal of design of psychiatric hospital wards
and the need for choice of single sex accommodation.

ALL over Copenhagen buildings are being built, renovated or tarted up. So much
so that a month ago the city ran out of scaffolding because the entire supply
was being used - by private house-holders as well as by the authorities. The
reason for the sprucing up of an entire city? Copenhagen is the European City
of Culture for 1996.
In the four years since Copenhagen won the title, over 50,000 Danes, 42 local
authorities and three regional authorities have been involved in deciding how
to spend the #99.3m budget. Like Glasgow, holder of the prestigious title only
five years ago and one of the two role models for Copenhagen 96, the Danish
capital has opted to celebrate the accolade with a year-long festival.
Given its budget and the significance the Danes are attaching to the tourism
value of 1996, the festival is vast: 100 international programmes involving 500
contemporary visual artists and more than 200 international theatre, opera,
music, dance and ballet companies. Not to mention the hundreds of local
community projects (another leaf from the Glaswegian book) which go unlisted in
the official brochure.
The Glaswegian influence is most apparent in the philosophy behind the 1996
celebrations. Copenhagen 96 is hoping to rejuvenate the city by generating
creativity and by encouraging the people to take an active interest in cultural
events. The theme ``rediscovering the city'' has been incorporated into the
curriculum of schools all over the Copenhagen region.
The Danes are also following the Glaswegian example of renovating old buildings
and finding new uses for disused, often industrial, buildings. Under the banner
The Changing City, at least 40 such projects are in progress, one of the most
interesting being a 1960s-built former power station which is being converted
into a site for youth events, and which will include a hip hop centre for
children. Similarly, the nucleus of the year's activity is the Kronborg, a car
ferry from the 1970s, which has been transformed into ``a sea-going house of
the arts'', complete with exhibition and conference areas, a concert room, and
a cafe bar. The Kronborg has already functioned as a kind of ambassador of the
arts: when Lisbon was city of culture last year, the Kronborg sailed to visit
her.
Each day during Copenhagen's reign as city of culture, there will be at least
nine, and at most 140, events and activities on offer. These range from the
sublime to the ridiculous. Many are sublimely ridiculous: there's none o' yer
Frank Sinatra or yer Pavarotti here; in fact there's not a great deal of
popular culture in the Danish programme. They take their culture very
seriously, and define it very broadly. Among the more bizarre projects is
Smells of the City: a team of Japanese fragrance artists have been commissioned
to come up with a smell for each season. Their incense pads will be used on
buses, trains, in city squares and at the openings of events during the year.
In a similar vein, Sounds of the City will be an evolving work by the leading
``acoustic sound artist'', Klaus Schonning (from Germany), and will be made up
of sounds recorded by microphones placed in gaps between the paving stones in
the Town Square.
In addition to the 21 orchestras, 11 string quartets, 15 solo classical
pianists, and festivals of jazz, world music, Nordic Women's music, baroque
music, and choral music, there is a fascinating venture called Art Projekt 96,
scheduled to take place in September. First launched in Munich last year, the
idea is to invite a prominent musical figure to organise a day of concerts
representing the entire scope of their interest. The finale of each day will be
a concert involving the celebrity him/herself. Among those who have been asked
to participate are composer Steve Reich and the Kronos Quartet, saxophonist
Branford Marsalis and pop star Bjork, who has agreed to put on a pop-art
concert.
Even more ambitious, however, is the Copenhagen 96 visual art programme. While
the city's museums were planning exhibitions celebrating Denmark's ``Golden
Age'' (1800-1850), video art, Nordic art , Islamic and Byzantine art, 14
artists from all over the world were despatched to the Arctic where they spent
a month in isolation considering how they would interpret the experience for
Copenhagen 96. Even more artists, 96 to be precise, will be participating in
Container 96 - Art Across Oceans. The museums of ports around the world chose
artists to represent their cities by creating art installations to be
transported to the port of Copenhagen in seven-metre long shipping containers.
Everything from paintings, graphics, sculptures, photographs, and computer art
will feature, and the containers will be displayed on the main pier of
Copenhagen's harbour from May until August.

A SENIOR fire officer praised the bravery of passers-by who dragged six
Aberdeen University students from their car after it struck a wall and burst
into flames early yesterday.
Three of the students died and the three others were badly injured in the
accident outside the College of Agriculture, in King Street, Aberdeen.
Passing drivers and people attending a ceilidh in the college rushed to the aid
of the victims in the north-bound F-registered Audi. A passing nurse stopped to
help.
Divisional fire officer John Sangster said: ``When we arrived all six had been
removed from the vehicle and were lying on the pavement at the rear of the car.
``It is very brave for an untrained person to drag someone from a burning car.
The firemaster intends obtaining their names from the police so they can be
asked if they would be prepared to accept a commendation.
``We were there before the ambulance and we carried out first aid and heart
massage until they arrived. Two of our officers then went with the ambulance to
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and continued to attempt resuscitation until they
reached the hospital.''
The three who died were the driver, Mr Raymond Hessey, 30, of Livingstone Road,
Thornton Heath, Surrey; Mr Anthony Oxborough, 23, of Lansdonne Close, Baildon,
West Yorkshire, and Taryn Elder, 20, from the US.
The injured are Mr Russell Betney, 19, of Millfield Close, Farndon, Chester, Mr
Darren Stonard, 21, of Newry Road, Wyken, Coventry, and Mr Ian Holmes, 18, of
Lanburgh Road, Hutton Rudby, Cleveland. They have been detained in hospital but
their conditions were not giving cause for concern.
Aberdeen University principal Professor Maxwell Irvine said: ``The entire
university community is shocked and deeply saddened by this terrible tragedy
and is giving all the assistance it can.''
Professor Irvine said that Mr Holmes and Mr Betney were both BSc freshers, and
Mr Stonard was in the final year of BSc geography. Mr Oxborough was an MSc
graduate at last week's ceremony.
q A soldier from Scotland died and another was seriously injured when they were
thrown from a car early yesterday at Weyhill, in Hampshire. Police named the
dead man as Mr Brian Allan Longmuir, 21, from Irvine.
The injured man, who is in hospital at Winchester, was named as Mr Brian
Fisher, 29, of Dinnington, Sheffield.
The men were both based at Tidworth, Hampshire.
Police said it was not certain who had been driving, and appealed for witnesses.

GRANGEMOUTH-based Currie Line celebrates its 200th birthday next year. Last
February it was bought by its management for #6.7m, after what adviser Andrew
Godfrey of Grant Thornton calls ``the longest running MBO I've ever been
involved in''.
Some MBOs are over in weeks. Some take a few months of nail-biting haggling.
Others, like Currie Line's, persist, in on-off convoluted fashion, for years.
Nearly four years, as far as Mike John and his six-strong Currie Line
management team are concerned.
This story really started in April 1991. Currie was originally the Leith,
Hamburgh &amp; Hull Steam Packet Company, trading from the Baltic to the
Mediterranean. In 1940, because of that word Hamburgh, the censor started
holding up its mail.
So it changed its name to Currie Line. By 1968 the freighter business was
running out of ideas and was bought by another powerful Scottish shipping
family, the Runcimans.
``I don't think they could believe their luck,'' says Mike John. ``There was
#3m in the bank and a large estate in central Edinburgh where the Currie
directors had lived and the gardeners' bill alone was #8000 a year.'' Within
the Runciman Group, Currie became part of the Anchor Line. In 1972, Runciman
added another east coast shipping line, George Gibson, a specialist in gas
carriers.
At the time Anchor itself was still offering transatlantic services and
sailings to India. So Currie, with its short sea services, and Gibson looked
like natural additions. But, when the managing director left in the early
eighties, responsibility for the subsidiaries was spread across several pairs
of management hands. It just wasn't working.
Mike John joined in 1987. A student apprentice with Stewart &amp; Lloyds in South
Wales in the early sixties, he was a qualified metallurgist and fuel
technologist, a natural choice for the new markets which were opening up in the
North Sea in the seventies. He worked on platform construction for a subsidiary
of British Steel's tubes division, latterly as operations manager, responsible
for some 500 people.
In 1978, he decided to move into the private sector and took a job with diving
specialist Wharton Williams. By the early eighties he had moved to Oceaneering
International, a NASDAQ-quoted, Aberdeen-based service company with a turnover
of #50m.
Then the Oceaneering president was killed in a flying accident and a new CEO
moved in, determined to appoint his own team. ``Within a year there had been a
50% turnover in senior executives. I was halfway down the list and the North
Sea was in a mess,'' he recalls. ``Runciman happened to be looking for someone
to put the pieces of Currie Line back together again.''
So he moved. But, within a year, Runciman was the target of a hostile takeover
bid from the Leeds-based mini-conglomerate Telfos. The bid failed but Telfos
was left with nearly 30% of the Runciman stock. Then Telfos got into trouble
and that stake was sold to Swedish group Avena.
Little more than a year later, a larger Swedish consortium was back with an
aggressive bid for the rest of Runciman, which finally succeeded in May 1990.
Avena was interested in Runciman's property and engineering interests. Two
other consortium members were attracted by the shipping side.
Within a year the new owner was struggling to justify its purchase price. So
John and his team broached the idea of a buy-out. A colleague who had been
finance director at Oceaneering when he had been MD had since joined Grant
Thornton. He introduced John to his corporate finance colleagues. Partner Jim
Borrows became the group's principal adviser.
Initially the plan was to test the MBO bid against a trade alternative. Bids
went in that summer. But majority parent Avena went bust and a bank emerged as
the majority holder of the Runciman group assets. All talk of an MBO went on to
the back burner.
Other assets, such as the Duncan Adams haulage subsidiary were sold off. But
Currie, under John's management, was cash generative. Turnover, which had been
#3m in 1987, reached #17m by 1994.
There was talk of trade sales but, eventually, in early 1994 John and the
management were invited to renew their interest. By this time Grant Thornton's
Jim Borrows had another big deal in hand. So head of corporate finance Andrew
Godfrey stepped in.
The team had a price on the table within two days. But, again within days, they
were told it was too low. Outside advisers were appointed to find a trade
buyer. For months the business was hawked around. But eventually, after more
nail biting, an offer from the MBO team, backed by 3i and Bank of Scotland, was
accepted.
``We're rolling now,'' says John. The greatest challenge since completing the
deal has been investing in new equipment - trailers, containers and side
loaders - to enhance Currie's position as a carrier by sea and land with a
distinctive Scottish hub.
The three-vessel short-sea container service, operated by its Rotterdam-based
Macvan subsidiary, offers four sailings a week out of Grangemouth, three out of
Antwerp, two out of Rotterdam and two out of Felixstowe. ``We carry
petrochemicals, whisky, electronic goods, paper, rubber and plastics for all
the majors,'' says John.
Currie's shipping side is complemented by extensive ware- housing, including
bonds, at Grangemouth and a road haulage fleet of 29 tractors and 160 trailers,
assembled from a standing start. There is also a ships agency.
``We are very much in balance in terms of trade in and out. And the more you
are in balance, the more profitable you can be.'' At present Currie commands
12% of all unit loads moving out of Scotland.
``We can see how to grow that,'' says the man who waited long and patiently to
get to make the decisions for himself and his team.

EXCLUSIVE
ONE of Scotland's best known theatre companies was forced into hastily
rewriting its Christmas pantomime last night after paying off its artistic
director on the eve of the show's opening.
The board of Borderline Theatre Company unceremoniously made award-winning
director Mr John Murtagh redundant on Thursday - without apparently taking into
account that he had written, was directing and was due to star in the panto.
Mr Murtagh refused to take rehearsals yesterday and, through his lawyers,
issued a statement to Borderline, exercising his copyright over Babes in the
Wood, which had been due to open at the Magnum Theatre in Irvine on Monday.
The move, which is already being construed in theatre circles as an
embarrassing own-goal, also resulted in the resignation of the board's
vice-chair, Mrs Catherine Czerkawska.
``I am disgusted by the way this whole thing has been engineered. There is no
other word for it,'' Mrs Czerkawska said yesterday.
``Papers were timetabled 30 seconds before the meeting, and the redundancy was
handled in a heartless manner. John had given a lot to this company and was
popular and respected. My phone has not stopped ringing with people horrified
at this decision.''
Borderline announced yesterday that it is to cancel the first three nights of
the show while a new version is written and the cast learn their lines.
Councillor Bobby Campbell, chairman of the theatre board, who personally told
Mr Murtagh of his redundancy, confirmed that the theatre had not expected the
pantomime to be hit.
``I understand he walked out and took his script with him today. It was clear
last night that he wasn't happy, but I have been made redundant myself and I
didn't go in the huff about it. Anyway, that's his decision at the end of the
day.''
Councillor Campbell confirmed that no warning of impending redundancy had been
given to Mr Murtagh, but said that it would have been impossible to do so. The
decision had been made only at Thursday night's board meeting into the
company's financial crisis.
``The financial problems for the company are being caused by the reorganisation
of local government,'' he added. ``Strathclyde region have given Borderline
considerable grants in the past, but they are not going to be there next year.
``Already one local authority has said it will only give limited support. A
report was produced into the various financial options, and it was decided that
the job of artistic director should go.
``Nothing was mentioned before because the decision was only made at the board
meeting, and there could have been another outcome. After that it was decided
that he should go forthwith, because that was the best financial option for
him.''
Mr Murtagh said he was ``simply shocked'' by the decision. ``I have been with
this company for almost five years and had recently been praised by the Arts
Council for what I was doing. Their only comment was that I was overworked.''
He added: ``I was playing the Dame in the pantomime, as well as writing. They
just expected me to turn up for work this morning, directing the cast as
normal.''
Equity, the actors' union, yesterday described the decision to make Mr Murtagh
redundant as ``shabby'' and said it would be supporting him in legal action on
his behalf.
Scottish Organiser Mr Drew McFarlane said: ``Put crudely, the board have been
inept. This is the crassest piece of management I have ever come across in my
industrial relations experience.''

CUSTOMS officers last night charged 12 people after Britain's largest operation
on untaxed wines, spirits, and beers.
Customs and Excise investigators raided addresses and seized alcohol worth
several million pounds in Operation Barlow last Thursday.
Officers charged Alan Carlton, the director of Carlton Transport, based in
Fraser Road, Erith, Kent, his wife and co-director Carol, and their son Steven,
the company manager, all from Slade Green, Erith, Kent.
They will appear before magistrates at Birmingham later today together with
Alan Brown of Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex; William Beale, an importer from
Tatworth, Somerset; Francis Savage, 58, of Parsonage Street, London and Anthony
Lacey, 41, from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex.
Five others will appear at Warley Magistrates Court, in Oldbury, West Midlands,
tomorrow.
They are Mark Nixon, a 41-year-old owner of a haulage firm based in West
Bromwich; Sukhdev Shergill, 26, of Bescott, Walsall; Ramjet Paul, 31, of Castle
Bromwich; Delveear Sagu, 33, from Smethwick and Edward Bacon, from Perry Barr
in Birmingham.
All are charged with evading excise duty on goods between November 1994 and
November 1995.
Others including nine from the Leeds area, have been bailed until a later date.
Investigators also found Ecstasy tablets worth #130,000 at a commercial address
in Kent, a investigators said.
Many of the goods recovered were marked as tax free exports but had been
diverted within the United Kingdom or re-imported without taxes being paid.

A COUPLE were yesterday awarded a total of nearly #900,000 damages for their
severely handicapped daughter by a High Court judge who criticised the legal
delays the pair had faced in their battle for compensation.
Anne and Keith Jewitt have been fighting in the courts for nine years for money
to help them provide special care at home for their daughter, Michelle, 13, who
is paralysed, incontinent, and knows only 12 words following difficulties at
her birth.
Mr Justice Holland, who was giving his judgment in London after hearing the
case in Newcastle upon Tyne, said it should have been possible to bring the
case to court faster. Meanwhile, a crash victim whose face and skull were
reconstructed by pioneering computer-based plastic surgery using photographs
from the family album won #956,303 damages in the High Court yesterday.
Mr Maurice Bell, 48, of Thornby, Cumbria, is blind as a result of the injuries
he suffered when a defective lorry jack-knifed and hit his car five years ago.
He also has no sense of smell, is deaf without hearing aids and has a severely
restricted sense of taste. Even his sense of touch is affected.

<HEADLINE>Judge recommends deportation for HIV sufferer who stabbed her lover with syringe  Parting `present' leads to jail</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A WOMAN who injected her boyfriend with her own HIV-infected blood as a parting
``present'' collapsed in the dock at the Old Bailey yesterday - World Aids Day
- as she was jailed for two years.
Rhena Ndagga slumped to the floor as Mrs Justice Steel passed sentence,
describing her crime as ``deliberate, calculating and cruel''. She also
recommended Ndagga for deportation, saying her continued presence in this
country was detrimental to the public and there was ``a real risk she might
commit a similar offence''.
Ndagga was treated by the court matron before being helped to the cells.
The judge said Ndagga's former boyfriend, David Kabagwire, has spent the months
since her attack in ``constant fear and distress'' that she had infected him.
He has had several blood tests which ``mercifully'', added the judge, have
proved negative. But he faces more before the final prognosis is known.
At an earlier hearing the judge told Ndagga: ``There can be nobody in this
court who can fail to have sympathy for you, your condition and your ultimate
future. Equally there is nobody in this court who can fail to be horrified by
what you did to David Kabagwire.''
``For whatever motive, maybe your own unhappiness, you quite deliberately and
calculatingly injected him with your own blood.''
Mr Kabagwire knew Ndagga from her native Uganda but he did not become her lover
until they met again as students in the UK. He was not in court for the
sentence.
Prosecutor Garrett Byrne had told the court Ndagga began an affair with Mr
Kabagwire soon after she arrived in late 1993.
``As she had recently come from abroad and despite the fact they had protected
sex, he thought it prudent they should both attend hospital to be tested for
the Aids virus.''
Mr Kabagwire's tests were negative, but hers were positive.
``However, they continued to see each other and have protected sex. She
insisted the tests must be wrong.''
Then he began a relationship with another woman and told her he did not want to
continue seeing her. ``She said she did not care and wanted to carry on having
sexual relations,'' Mr Byrne said.
In May this year, Ndagga told her 28-year-old lover she had been ordered to
leave the country and was returning to Uganda.
``She said she had a present for him and she was sure he would like it.''
In bed that night he felt a sudden pain in his shoulder and saw Ndagga turning
away from him.
The following day, after she insisted again the HIV tests on her must be wrong,
they agreed to return to the hospital for further tests.
They stopped at the home they shared in Gurney Close, Barking, Essex, on the
way. As he bent down to recover a briefcase ``he felt a sharp pain in one of
his buttocks.
``He stood up and saw the defendant in front of him. On the carpet was a needle
attached to a syringe with what seemed to be blood inside.
``She said she had injected him earlier on the arm, but had only put in a
quarter of the blood. She said he would now be ill as well as her.''
She added she was leaving the country the next day and did not care what
happened to him.
``She said this was the present she had promised.''
Mr Kabagwire called the police and she was arrested. A small syringe containing
blood was found in her pocket, said Mr Byrne.
Mr Kabagwire told the jury that when he asked Ndagga why she had done it she
said she wanted to satisfy herself. ``I did not know what to do - I felt
upset.'' He said he received counselling afterwards and still had more tests to
take.
Ndagga was cleared of causing a noxious thing, her blood, to be administered
with intent to endanger life, but was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm
with intent.
The judge said it had not been possible to test the blood found in the syringe
for HIV.
Ndagga, who now claimed she did not have the Aids virus, refused to take
further tests.
But the court had heard from Mr Kabagwire that he and Ndagga had had tests in
two separate clinics and on each occasion hers had been positive and she was
very upset about it.
Mr Serugo Lugo, defending, said Ndagga's present condition was unknown.
He said if she was sent back to Uganda where her experiences had been
``harrowing'' she would not get the assistance she would in this country. ``She
needs assistance rather than punishment.''

THE Prime Minister insisted yesterday that the tax-raising Scottish parliament
Labour was proposing ``to outflank the SNP'' would prove a mechanism ``to
maximise conflict and wreck the Union.''
Mr Major told the Tory women's conference in London that Labour's plans could
do what Britain's enemies had never achieved, ``split our island apart and set
one people against another. What stupidity.''
He accepted that changes were due in Scotland, but said that those proposed by
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth would improve the government of Scotland
without endangering the Union.
Would the Scots feel the Union gave them a better deal, he asked, if they had
to pay an extra tartan tax on Scottish jobs, investment and prosperity?
He said Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson had made it clear that he
believed the Government majority in Westminster should not have the final say
on the laws of Scotland but must defer to the majority party in Scotland.
He asked if Mr Robertson would apply the same proposition to England. ``For on
that basis, few past Labour governments could have governed England - they had
no majority in England. What sort of perversion of our constitution are they
prepared to tolerate?
``Either they fail to grasp the dangers of such devolution or they are prepared
to sell the crown jewels of our political heritage in a desperate bid for
votes.
``They are putting the whole constitution of our country in question. As they
plan that, how dare they talk of the national interest.''

not to prosecute the vehicle's owners, Fewston Transport, of Skipton,
Yorkshire, for manslaughter.
Python peril
A BURMESE python stolen from a pet shop in Hackney, east London, is ``extremely
dangerous'', Scotland Yard warned. The 15ft snake is pregnant, ``a condition
which makes her extremely short-tempered and capable of strangling a human
being''.
Mercury fear
THE Highland Green Party is calling for an independent inquiry into claims that

SKIING:
EMMA Carrick-Anderson's disappointment at her performance in the opening World
Cup Slalom this season in Vail two weeks ago - when she failed to make the
second run cut, was eased by two consecutive top-10 placings in international
FIS races in the USA over the past two days.
In Loveland on Wednesday, the Dunblane double Olympian took an excellent second
place in slalom, finishing just 47-hundredths of a second behind USA's Kristina
Coznick () who skied to ninth place in that Vail world cup slalom.
On the first run of the technically demanding course, on artificial snow
Carrick-Anderson was only two-hundredths behind the American.
A minor error on the second run robbed her of a possible victory, according to
her coach Kurt Scherl.
In a FIS giant slalom in Winterpark on Thursday, Carrick-Anderson placed sixth.
Her first run was third quickest but she failed to capitalise, losing her
rhythm on the second run. Results:
FIS Slalom, Loveland, USA - 1, K Coznick (USA) 1-35.19; 2, E Carrick-Anderson
(GB/Dunblane) 1-35.56; 3, C Gedde-Dahl (Norway) 1-37.35; 12, S Robertson
(GB/Aberdeen) 1-40.87; 17, K Morris (GB/York) 1-42.74; 24, K McGibbon
(GB/Glasgow) 1-45.06; 25, T Pirie (GB/Aberdeen) 1-45.13.
FIS Giant Slalom, Winterpark - 1, K Ikeda (Japan) 1-23.86; 2, K Kashinagi
(Japan) 1-24.18; 3, K Clark (USA) 1-25.11. 6, Carrick-Anderson 1-26.21; 10, L
McKenna (GB/Aviemore) 1-26.92; 20, Morris 1-28.79; 34, McGibbon 1-30.85.
q LUC Alphand, of France, won the season's opening Alpine World Cup downhill
race at Vail, Colorado, yesterday with a time of 1min. 37.93sec., according to
provisional results.
Lasse Kjus, of Norway, was second in 1-38.47 and Patrick Ortlieb, of Austria,
finished third in 1-38.61.

TV star Chris Evans announced new deals with the BBC and Channel 4 yesterday.
His hit television game show Don't Forget Your Toothbrush will move from
Channel 4 to BBC1 - but without him as host.
Media pundits speculated that Evans would defect to BBC TV, because he already
works for the BBC as Radio 1's breakfast time disc jockey. But they thought
Channel 4 would assert its rights over the Toothbrush format.
Instead, Toothbrush will go to the BBC, which will pay Channel 4 for the format
rights. Evans will stay with Channel 4, creating and presenting a 26-part
entertainment and music show.
He is also discussing ``new projects'' for BBC1 and BBC2 with entertainment
head Chris Pye, which are thought to include late night Friday music shows.
No-one would put a price on his latest deals. But Evans, 29, has already become
a multi-millionaire from his company Ginger Productions. His three-year deal
with Radio 1 alone is rumoured to be worth #3m.

<HEADLINE>ScotRail under fire as fares are increased</HEADLINE>

SCOTRAIL yesterday announced that fares will increase by an average of 3.5% in
the new year. A Glasgow-Edinburgh standard return will go up by 4% to #13.
Labour and the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland expressed
disappointment at the increases.
Shadow Transport spokesman Brian Wilson said: ``Even if many of these increases
are above the rate of inflation, this is still the quiet before the storm.
``If the Tories succeed in privatising, then all the indications are that fares
would rise sharply. There is also a lot of hidden increases going on from the
removal of special fares.''
A spokesman for the FSB said ScotRail should have made an effort to freeze all
fares given the problems it encountered in the past year. He added: ``This move
is hardly going to encourage people to leave their cars at home and travel by
train.''
The Government announced earlier this year that some fares would be capped and
would not exceed the inflation rate.
However, ScotRail's are based on the retail price index for July, 1995 - when
inflation was 3.5% compared with the current rate of 3.2%. The increases will
take effect on Sunday, January 7.
It is expected that fares within Strathclyde - some 60% of rail services in
Scotland - will be held at least until April by Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive. From then, a new PTE, comprising of members from the new unitary
local authorities, will assume control of local transport budgets.
ScotRail said its fares would increase by an average of 3.5% in line with
national policy, which regulates increases in key fares to the rate of
inflation for three years from next year and at 1% below for the following four
years. Similar fares changes are being applied by other train operating units
across Britain.
There will be no change in the fares for passengers purchasing advance tickets
for the long distance routes from Glasgow or Edinburgh to London. This includes
the Fort William sleeper service which was reprieved earlier this year.
Examples of ScotRail increases include: a 3.1% increase in the
Edinburgh-Glasgow standard single fare, up from #6.50 to #6.70; a standard day
return on the same route is up 4% from #12.50 to #13. A standard single from
Edinburgh to Aberdeen is up 3.5% from #28.50 to #29.50, while an Edinburgh to
Aberdeen supersaver return is up 3.1% from #32 to #33.
ScotRail said some short journey fares will increase by slightly more than 3.5%
and some slightly less because minimum fares would be rounded to the nearest
10p. Apex fares, booked 48 hours in advance of travel, have not been increased.
Inter-City West Coast, which runs Anglo-Scottish services to and from London
Euston, including overnight sleeper trains, said there would be no increases
for tickets purchased in advance. The same will apply to Inter-City East Coast
Anglo-Scottish services to and from London King's Cross.
Inter-City Cross Country, which runs Anglo-Scottish services not going to
London, including Aberdeen-Plymouth, Edinburgh-Manchester, and Glasgow
Birmingham, said it would continue its ``fares freeze.''
Labour's transport campaigns co-ordinator, Ms Glenda Jackson, said the
increases demonstrated that the Government's fare capping was nothing more than
deception. ``The reality for many rail passengers is that their fares will
again be rising by well above the rate of inflation.''
STRATHCLYDE Police yesterday urged the public to consider using public
transport or park-and-ride facilities as an alternative to their vehicles to
cut down on the amount of traffic in Glasgow city centre in the run-up to
Christmas.
Police appealed to drivers who must use their cars to plan their journeys
carefully, making use of multi-storey car parking, and advised against
continuously driving around the city centre looking for a parking place.
They also warned that vehicles which were illegally parked or were causing an
obstruction, endangering the safety of motorists and pedestrians, would be
removed.

FERTILISER and feed prices are rising, and some farmers may find it difficult
to find supplies of fertilisers unless they had already booked their orders
with merchants.
The sales director of Montrose-based Angus Fertilizers , Alistair Ballantyne
outlined the situation this week when he said: ``Prices are anything up to #18
per tonne higher than last year and the supply situation is tight.
``I can see problems ahead for some farmers who think all they have to do is to
pick up the telephone and expect the fertiliser to arrive the next day. Often
it will not.''
The most acute shortage is of ammonium nitrate and it is reckoned within the
trade that virtually all the UK manufactured product is sold at prices around
#140 per tonne. Imported fertilisers from the former Eastern Bloc countries
have, in recent years, offered farmers a lower cost option, but often with
lower quality.
Now countries such as Lithuania are finding it more attractive to divert their
exports to the world market rather than just within the EU.
Commenting on that aspect, Mr Ballantyne said: ``Countries in South America for
example which, in the past, have used relatively little fertiliser are now
active in the market as a result of high grain prices.''
Sources in the trade say that has probably been more fertiliser purchased
forward this year than for some time. This is reckoned to be a direct
consequence of most farmers having had an excellent harvest.
At the same time world grain prices have rocketed with wheat having risen from
#89 to #137 per tonne in the past six months, although there are indications
that the market is falling back slightly. In effect, world prices are at least
on a par with those in the EU, hence the Commission's decision to halt export
restitutions apart from on a limited tonnage of malting barley.
q The National Farmers' Union of Scotland has appealed to the Government for
action to restore confidence in the pig industry. Speaking after a meeting with
Scottish Office and Ministry of Agriculture officials in London, the union's
pig convener, David Whiteford, said that despite improved prices margins were
being badly squeezed by the high cost of cereals.
``Brussels must improve its management of the cereals regime and make even more
radical cuts in arable set-aside rates,'' he said. ``This will help get feed
prices down towards the level promised under reform of the CAP.
``We also told the Government how disappointed we are that it has again failed
to offset trade distortions caused by unilateral UK welfare legislation. It
must now honour its commitment to encourage retails to buy only from sources
which match our welfare standards.''

ULSTER peace talks politician Lindsay Robb had two Scots fiancees, and three
children by one of them, a court heard yesterday. Mrs Margaret Glen, 33, of
Airdrie, told the High Court in Glasgow earlier this week she was in bed with
Mr Robb when he was alleged to have had a gun in a Falkirk pub.
Yesterday it was revealed that Mr Robb had a Scots-born girlfriend in his home
town of Lurgan, Northern Ireland. The court heard this is Ms Debbie Thorburn,
the mother of his three children.
Mr Robb is on trial with five other men, who all deny conspiring to acquire
weapons for the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force with intent to endanger lives
in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
The five others are Mr John Johnston, 49, of Laurieston, Falkirk; Mr Francis

NOT many people know that Noah knew the Macneill of Barra. But he did, because
prior to the Great Flood, Noah sent the Macneill a message, telling him that he
had reserved a place in the Ark for him and for his wife. The Macneill replied,
with typical Highland courtesy, thanking Noah for his trouble, but saying that
he already had a perfectly good boat of his own.
Barra is the largest of the southern isles of the Outer Hebrides. The other,
smaller islands, are Vatersay, Muldoanich, Sandray, Foldday, Lingay, Pabbay,
Mingulay and Bernery. These islands are uninhabited, other than Vatersay, which
is now joined to Barra by a grand new causeway, completed in 1994.
Climb to the top of Barra's highest peak, Heaval (383m),  past the Carrara
marble statue of the Madonna and Child to enjoy the view. A comfortable half
hour will see you up and from the summit you will be rewarded with an
unforgettable vista which encompasses most of the Hebrides; the mountains of
South Uist and Harris in the north, the lazy spread of the southern isles; the
misty island of Skye, hazily to the east.
In 1839 when the last of the main line of Macneill chiefs, General Roderick
Macneill, was declared bankrupt, Barra was bought by the infamous Colonel
Gordon of Cluny. The new laird presided over decades of brutal eviction and the
enforced emigration of his tenants. Against their will, the people were shipped
to Canada and their land was given over to sheep farmers.
Robert Lister MacNeil, a Canadian architect and descendent of a dispossessed
Barra man, successfully proved his claim to the chieftainship and became the
45th Chief in 1915, restoring and living in Kisimul Castle in Castle Bay.
Robert Lister is buried in Kisimul Castle and his son, the 46th Chief, now
cares for the ancient clan home of the Macneills.
Another more recent famous Barra resident, was Compton MacKenzie, the author of
Whisky Galore, who recounts the story of the SS Politician which ran aground
off the Island of Eriskay, her holds packed with thousands of cases of whisky,
many of them being ``liberated'' by local people.
The film of the book was shot on Barra with Compton MacKenzie himself playing
the part of the captain of the island ferry. MacKenzie, who came to live on
Barra in 1928, was a founder member of the Scottish Nationalist Party and he
built himself a fine house on the north coast of the island; overlooking the
white sands of Traigh Mhor, cockle strand, where Loganair land their
aeroplanes, weather and tide permitting.
Compton MacKenzie lies in the graveyard of Cille Bharra, one of the oldest
places of Christian worship in Scotland and perhaps dating back as far as the
early years of the seventh century.
The chapel was founded, tradition has it, by St Finnbarr, patron saint of
Barra, whose dramatic statue dominates an outcrop in the sea at Northbay.
The ``Aberdeen Breviary'', from the sixteenth century, tells us that Finnbarr
was born in Caithness, was ordained a priest in Rome, then returned to Scotland
where he ``converted many to the faith of Christ''.
Cille Bharra is the starting point for a super Barra walk. Park near the chapel
(OS Map 31, Barra, Gd Ref 31/70407) and climb south to the top of Ben Eoligarry
(102m). Look north east to the island of Eriskay and the Princes Strand, where
Bonnie Prince Charlie first set foot on Scottish soil in 1745. In fact, BPC had
made a prior call at Kisimul Castle, but the Macneill diplomatically and
happily, given the horrendous aftermath of the uprising, was ``not at home.''
Descend south, on to the white sand and golden green-marram-grass spiked dunes
of Traigh Eais. Three thousand mile old, huge, blue, foam-crested, Atlantic
waves crowd the shore and dash in fury against the black crags of Ben Erival
(200m). The landscape lies essentially unchanged, as awe-inspiring today as it
must have been in the days when Finnbarr's monks trembled and prayed before
their mysterious maker.
At the end of the beach, cross the narrow neck east to reach the road near the
cement-block factory, the offices of which are Compton MacKenzie's old house
(31/695056). Walk north now over Traigh Mhor, keeping a weather-eye open for
incoming Loganair flights, back to the eternal peace and calm of Cille Bharra.

TV chef Keith Floyd wed for the fourth time yesterday, after a three-month
romance with food stylist Tess Smith.
The 51-year-old celebrity restaurateur and his 32-year-old bride were married
at a register office in Didcot, Oxfordshire.
``Unfortunately we're not going on honeymoon as we're both going back to work
on Monday morning,'' he said.
He added: ``We are going to the local pub to have a few beers and have a good
time. You're all invited.''
Floyd married third wife Shaunagh Mullet in 1991, but the couple separated soon
after.

Steady rise
in number of
flu cases in
Scotland
ON a population basis the incidence of flu in Scotland is more than double that
in the rest of the UK, figures released yesterday revealed.
They indicate there were more than 15,000 new cases at the end of last week,
compared with 77,000 in England and Wales, where the latest wave was said to
have surprised doctors.
The figures are based on returns from ``spotter'' GP practices sent to the
Royal College of Practitioners' monitoring unit and, in Scotland, to the
Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health at Ruchill Hospital.
Dr Ahilya Noone, at the centre, said yesterday: ``Our spotter practices showed
that were 295 cases per 100,000 population at the end of last week, compared
with 139 overall for England and Wales.
``That has come as no surprise - our data had already been showing a steady
increase over the past few weeks.''
The surge in the North of England was most marked, from 58 cases per 100,000
the previous week to 120 last week. North of the Border, however, the climb has
been steady - from 109 three weeks ago, 223 the following week, and 295 last
week.
In England that would qualify comfortably as an epidemic. A spokesman for the
college's monitoring unit in Birmingham said that was reached around the
200-250 per 100,000 mark. But Dr Noone said: ``There is no real definition for
epidemic.''
Although the prolonged summer might have been expected to delay the onset of
this year's wave, Dr Noone pointed out that last year's outbreak did not peak
until January.
``But it doesn't follow that this year's will go on increasing until then,''
she added.
In fact, this year's probably has more in common with the 1993-94 outbreak.
Both were variants of Influenza A, and the strains currently prominent are
largely covered by the vaccination programme for the vulnerable which was
already being promoted by the end of September.
The vaccines cover strains analogous to A/Johannesburg, A/Singapore and
B/Beijing and are targeted at people with asthma, chronic bronchitis, diabetes,
shortness of breath, heart trouble, kidney failure or other serious medical
conditions.
People taking steroids or cancer treatments are also targeted, as are patients
in residential or long-stay homes where rapid spread could occur, but
immunisation of fit, healthy adults is not recommended by the Scottish Office
Health Department.
The main symptoms of flu are fever, headache, aching limbs, coughing, sneezing,
and a runny nose.
Treating the symptoms is the best that can be done for those who catch flu -
that means staying home and resting (and keeping it to yourself) and taking hot
drinks and painkillers. But beware of accidental overdose of paracetamol or
aspirin through different preparations containing these drugs.
q Meningitis cases in Scotland are substantially lower this year than last,
notwithstanding the recent high-profile outbreaks here and in England. Dr Sarah
O'Brien, a consultant epidemiologist at SCIEH, said there had been 149
meningococcal infections so far this year compared with 173 at the same point
last year. ``They tend not to follow any particular pattern, although they tend
to be more numerous in winter. We normally expect to see a number of unlinked
cases,'' said Dr O'Brien.

VIOLENT crime as well as cheque and credit card frauds are to be specifically
targeted under Operation Holly, an initiative being launched next week by the
Lothian and Borders force.
The officer leading the operation, Detective Chief Inspector Watson McAteer,
said yesterday they estimated that at its peak as many as 100,000 shoppers a
day would converge on Edinburgh city centre.
``That in itself is bound to attract the criminal to the capital,'' said the
officer. ``This year we have already laid plans for cheque and credit card
fraud crime to be one of our top priorities. Crimes of violence such as robbery
will be our other priority.''
He said both young and elderly people had been targeted before by criminals
during this period because they were unable to put up much resistance.
``It is therefore our objective to target the robbers with plain clothes
officers mingling with shoppers on the streets.''
He said the prevention initiative would also continue into the hours of
darkness to give more protection to revellers attending late night Christmas
functions.
Detectives from a number of areas including Serious Crime Squad and Fraud Squad
will be supported by a team of specially selected uniformed officers .

BUSINESS Diary has the bargain of the year for small and medium-sized
engineering companies who yearn for the skills of a highly qualified engineer
but can't afford the extra cost.
Lanarkshire Development Agency and Scottish Design have teamed up in an attempt
to ensure the skills of engineers made redundant as the result of Rolls-Royce's
decision to close its aero design division in East Kilbride are not lost to
Scottish industry.
It is hoped that the project, which is already being supported by Rolls-Royce,
will also be funded by Strathclyde European Partnership. The aim is for 25
former RR engineers to be placed with small and medium-sized firms in
Strathclyde for a year. The engineers will be paid a salary of #15,000, with
the companies involved only having to meet 50% of this.
David Robson, business manager of Scottish Design, told Business Diary: ``Such
world-class experience can make a significant impact on local companies who are
competing in a global market place. We are excited about the chance to help so
many firms take on these skills, and we want to hear from interested companies
as soon as possible.''
The engineers involved have already completed a 10-week training programme to
prepare them for working in smaller companies and are available to start in
January. They include senior mechanical design engineers, project managers,
technical authors, IT systems specialists, engineering managers, design
draughtsmen and engineering technicians.
If your company is interested in this initiative, contact David Robson at
Scottish Design on 0141 221 6121.
Edinburgh has
incentive edge
SCOTLAND does not just beat the Irish when it comes to the inward investment of
computer companies. It also has an edge in attracting lucrative hotel business.
Stephen Carter, general manager of the five-star Caledonian Hotel in Edinburgh,
recently returned from the Incentive Travel and Meetings Exhibition in Chicago
which is attended by top hotels from around the world.
He brought back with him a #250,000 incentive travel package from an American
life assurance association, having beat the Irish contingent for the business.
Hail to the new
chamber chief
CONGRATULATIONS to W Stewart McKay who has been elected by the Ayrshire Chamber
of Commerce to succeed Richard Cole-Hamilton as president.
He will be only the second president of the Ayrshire Chamber since it was
formed in 1992 by the two separate chambers in the area coming together.
The new president was South-west of Scotland and Cumbria manager of the
Clydesdale Bank before setting up the Wisdom Associates business consultancy
earlier this year.
Transmitting a
property idea
THE boom in mobile phones is bringing in its wake another property boom
according to chartered surveying firm DM Hall.
The autumn edition of its Landscape newsletter aimed at the farming community
contains the following snippet of news: ``As the mobile phone business
continues to grow, transmitter sites are in ever-increasing demand. These can
be quite profitable for the owner of the modest amount of land required - like
a site in Fife where we achieved a rental of #5500 a year.''
DM Hall's surveyors are welcome to come and see my garden any time.
Espionage at
big breakfast
THERE was a spy in the camp when KPMG Tax Advisers held its Big Budget
Breakfast in the Glasgow Moat House Hotel on Wednesday, thanks to Business
Diary.
Sitting among the 200 guests listening to KPMG tax partner Joy Travers and her
colleagues give their breakdown of the Budget proposals was a Coopers &amp; Lybrand
staff member. The mole had gained access to the event by being one of the first
10 Business Diary readers to give the correct answer - Norman Lamont - to the
question - Who was the last Scots-born Chancellor? - which we set last week.
The entry arrived at the KPMG offices via a fax from the person's home, but
when the accountancy firm checked further it was discovered the entrant was a
Coopers &amp; Lybrand employee.
Ian Spinney of KPMG joked: ``We were rather flattered that Coopers &amp; Lybrand
needed to come to us for tax advice!'' The immediate response to this from an
insider at Coopers &amp; Lybrand was: ``Perhaps it was a bit of freelance
industrial espionage by one of our staff, but we are told the mission drew a
blank.''
Away from the cloak and dagger goings on, Joy Travers sat down to breakfast
with John Paterson, the fundraising director of The Princess Royal Trust for
Carers, and presented the charity with a cheque for #200.

FEARS are increasing that Government proposals for implementing the EU
agreement on the protection of animals during transport could decimate the
Scottish livestock sector.
In a heated debate at the Scottish NFU's Ayr area executive, president John
Scott from Ballantrae said that if the proposals went through it would not only
severely damage the auction system but also add enormously to both farmers' and
hauliers' costs.
``Make no mistake this is possibly the biggest single threat faced by the
Scottish livestock industry,'' warned Mr Scott.
He claimed the new rules were ``self-defeating'', creating more stress and
suffering for animals instead of less.
``Multiple loading and off-loading of newly-weaned calves or sheep will simply
cause more welfare and health problems,'' he said.
``We should be pressing for a relaxation of this directive exempting the whole
of Scotland from some of these proposals which are damaging to animals and
farmers' interests alike.''
Alan Parker, from Lochwinnoch, called on the union to enlist the help of the
SSPCA, as much of what was being proposed was simply ``downright cruel'',
adding ``it pays no regard to livestock management or the welfare of animals
and is seriously flawed''.
Henry Murdoch, from Dalrymple, said the sad thing was that the directive had
been drawn up by people who had no knowledge of the livestock industry. Changes
being proposed to journey times, feeding etc were just ``plain daft''. He
added: ``It's time qualified people had a say in these matters.
``I think there is a hidden agenda in all this. There are people out there who
want to make it impossible for livestock farmers to function.''
Area vice-president Adam Train, from Tarbolton, said the total impractability
of the directive had to be stressed to the Scottish Office who he believed
would be ``supportive'' of farmers' concerns.
A resolution from the area to union HQ will point out that the proposals pay
little regard to livestock management or welfare and calls on the Government to
take practical advice from hauliers, veterinary officials and farmers.
Following another lengthy debate on the possible introduction to the UK of US
beef treated with hormal-growth promoters, the area agreed to back the Meat and
Livestock Commission view that the use of such products should continue to be
banned here and across the rest of Europe.
Mr Scott said that under the GATT agreement there was no way hormone-produced
US beef could be kept out of Europe. The issue for UK farmers was that while
there was obvious commercial advantages to be gained by hormone use, the view
of consumers on the matter was ``paramount''.
The area's livestock convenor Ian Kerr, from Newmilns, said the less said about
the matter the better. ``If we make too much an issue of this the public will
not be able to distinguish between US beef and home-produced beef free of such
promoters.
Alan Parker said the welfarists should be looking at the US feed lots where
hundreds of animals stood shoulder to shoulder. ``It's high time we in Scotland
stressed the significance of the natural product produced here and set industry
standards for Scotch quality beef,'' he said.

MICHAEL Heseltine was informally offered the post of John Major's deputy three
weeks before the Tory leadership election during which the appointment was
announced, the deputy Prime Minister has disclosed.
He told colleagues to vote for Mr Major after he had told the Prime Minister
that ``I am not going to be involved in this process.''
Casting new light on John Major's path to victory in the leadership battle,
which ended with his re-election in a straight fight with John Redwood, Mr
Heseltine said - in an interview in the Times today - the idea of his promotion
came up in a late-night Commons chat with Mr Major.
``There was no agreement,'' he said. ``It came up as a thought to be discussed.
It was left on the table, so to speak . . . I think it was quite obvious that I
was going to become his number two.''
The plan was confirmed by Mr Major on the morning of polling, he said.
However, asked whether the advance move had been intended to get his support in
good time, Mr Heseltine said such a ``Machiavellian interpretation'' had not
occurred to him.
He said that between the two conversations about his promotion, Mr Major had
told of his idea, which ``had been in his mind for some time . . . to lance the
boil'' over the leadership question.
``He asked my view. I said, after a moment's reflection, that I thought it was
a very sensible thing to do. That was it.''
Explaining why he was so firm in telling his supporters to vote for John Major,
he said: ``I do not believe in deceit.
``If I say to John Major's face I am not going to be involved in this process I
am not the sort of person who then goes round the House of Commons saying well,
I may have said this to the Prime Minister but don't take a blind bit of notice
- you go and sort it out. I would not do that.''
He added that he and Mr Major would never be ``prised apart'' by the
``pressures of politics or by the scrutiny of the media''.

A HOMELESS project designed to provide high quality accommodation for up to 39
young people who might otherwise be forced to sleep on the streets of Glasgow
was opened in the south side of the city yesterday.
The James Shields project will provide a sanctuary for young people aged
between 18 and 25 for stays as long as two years.
Named after the city's last Lord Provost, the project was officially opened by
members of Glasgow City Council who have leased the converted Abbotsford
Chalmers Free Church building on Pollokshaws Road. They were joined by
representatives from the Bridge of Weir-based charity Quarriers who will run
the centre and provide support for residents.
According to the project manager, Ms Nicola Hanley, homeless young people will
be referred to the centre by the council's housing department and have their
rent paid for by the DSS. ``The project will have a bias towards female
residents as there's not a lot of suitable accommodation. People will be able
to live here independently but the support workers will help some to acquire
the skills to live on their own and eventually move out to their own
tenancies.''
One of the project's new residents, Ms Yvonne Donnelly, from the Possil area of
Glasgow, described the sequence of events which had led her to seek shelter at
the project.
The 21-year-old told how she had been working at Butlins for five months before
returning to Glasgow to live with her mother. ``We had an argument and she
threw me out. When I was away I was used to my own freedom but when I came back
my mum was telling what to do and asking me where I was going all the time.''
Ideally Ms Donnelly said she would like to get her own house with her boyfriend
of three months who is currently in hospital but who has also been living in
hostel accommodation. But having just moved into her own flat in the centre a
few days ago she said was impressed with the standard of the accommodation.
``It's really nice in here. You couldn't ask for a better place. And it's
clean.''

A DETECTIVE accused of corruption visited a man in police custody to make sure
he did not inform on a drug dealer and his associate, a court heard yesterday.
James Reid claimed that Constable Neil Cooper came to his cell to tell him not
to implicate Ronald Cormack and Mr Ian Smith over a break-in.
He said Mr Cooper, who was not involved in investigating the case, told him to
stick to a different story because the officers interviewing him would believe
it.
Reid, 23, of the Gallowgate, Aberdeen, claimed Mr Cooper said Cormack and Mr
Smith had phoned to ensure Reid was being looked after.
Mr Cooper, 36, of Springdale Crescent, Bieldside, Aberdeen, denies attempting
to defeat the ends of justice by failing fully to report the break-in and
informing Mr Smith that Reid had not implicated either him or Cormack.
He also denies a further charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice and
a charge of corruption.
The High Court in Aberdeen heard that Reid was arrested in the city's Polmuir
Road, in December 1991, on suspicion that he had stolen a mobile phone.
He had been sitting in a car as a look-out for Cormack and Mr Smith, known as
Fat Billy, who were allegedly breaking into the Inn at the Park hotel nearby.
The court has heard that Cormack is serving a 15-year sentence for drugs and
firearms offences.
Reid said that when he was taken into custody he told police officers he had
been planning a lone break-in at a shop nearby.
Asked by Advocate-depute Alan Turnbull what Mr Cooper had said to him when he
paid a visit to the cells, Reid replied: ``To stick to the same story.''
Reid said Mr Cooper told him the police believed the story about the shop
break-in.
He added: ``He just said Fat Billy and Ronald Cormack had got in touch with him
and asked him to see how I was doing.''
Asked by Mr Turnbull if he was surprised by this, Reid replied: ``In a way,
yes.''
The trial continues.

n THE stories that formed the most powerful mythology of my childhood came not
from Greece or Rome or the Arabian Nights, but from Glasgow. Glasgow was where
my grandmother (1897) and my mother (1919) were born. It contained the house
and nursery of their childhoods which shaped their imaginations for the rest of
their lives, and which produced stories and images which coloured the later
(and by contrast, we felt, dull) childhoods of my sister, my brother and
myself. Glasgow, we came to believe, was it.
My great-grandfather, James Hedderwick, was a successful Glasgow stockbroker
and also a city father. His portrait hangs in the boardroom of the Royal
Infirmary in tribute to his chairing the committee that organised and paid for
the hospital's great rebuilding programme at the turn of the century. His first
wife having died in childbirth, he brought home to Glasgow in 1887 a
Gloucestershire girl, known locally as ``the Rose of Rodborough,'' and
installed her in No 2 Clairmont Gardens. It was in the top-floor nurseries of
that house that the Glasgow stories began.
They were stories of life in a prosperous Edwardian household, of bowling hoops
in Kelvingrove Park, of watching the city Art Gallery go up, of peering through
the nursery banisters at well-dressed dinner guests crossing the chequered hall
floor far below. They were stories of games, plays and parties, of books and
pictures, while my grandmother's generation merged inexorably into my mother's,
linked by a reluctance to leave that safe and richly imaginative world behind
as well as by the abiding presence of my grandmother's nursery nurse.
They were, above all, stories of a vanished kind of childhood where ritual and
order prevailed, where the child was oddly both monarch and subject at once,
and where the outside world lived, quite definitely, beyond the nursery windows.

A FORENSIC scientist gagged himself in a witness box yesterday to demonstrate
how a man - accused of murdering his wife - could have deliberately tied
himself up.
Gordon Wardell was found bound and gagged in the living room of his home after
the murder of his wife last year.
He watched from the dock at Oxford Crown Court as Roger Ide wrapped a piece of
sheet around his neck, tied it, and lifted it over his mouth to show how easily
Mr Wardell could have fooled the police.
Mr Ide had no problems talking through the gag, similar to the one found on the
accused, who denies murdering his wife Carol last September.
He claims she was killed by raiders who stole money from the Nuneaton branch of
the Woolwich Building Society where she worked.
Mr Wardell said the same gang gagged and bound him in their home in Bonneville
Close, Meriden, near Nuneaton, Warkwickshire.
However, Mr Ide - an expert in knots - told the court how easy it may have been
for Wardell to tie himself up. He explained how a strip of material used for Mr
Wardell's gag had been torn off a sheet found in the couple's garage.
When asked by prosecutor Richard Wakerley, QC, if the gag could have stopped
someone shouting, Mr Ide replied: ``It would not have been very effective at
all.'' ''
If a person wanted to silence another, they would put an object in their mouth
and then tape it, Mr Ide explained.
Mr Wardell was found gagged and bound to a metal bin stand with his knees
almost bent double across the main pole of the stand. It was Mr Ide's belief
that Mr Wardle would not have been found this way.
When Mr Wakerley asked if it was possible to tie oneself up that way Mr Ide
said: ``Not in a convincing way, with your hands tied behind your back.''
A police officer, posing as Mr Wardell, was shown stripped to his
underwear,tying himself up to the same metal bin stand in the couple's living
room.
The case was adjourned.

WORKERS at the Kvaerner Govan shipyard have rejected a 6.15% pay offer over two
years - raising fears of possible industrial action.
However, a union source predicted last night that the dispute at the Clydeside
yard would not come to that.
It is understood that union representatives are seeking a rise equivalent to
1.5% above an estimated inflation rate of 3.5% for the first year of a deal.
Management confirmed that the workers had rejected the offer, and said further
discussions would be held with full-time union officials on Monday.
It is understood that the dismissed offer to 1400 workers was for a 3.27%
increase in year one and a 2.85% increase the following year, and a promise
that this would be reviewed if inflation, based on the retail price index,
climbed above 3.5% before next November.
It had also been proposed that a 15-minute tea break would be moved back two
hours, beginning at 7.30am instead of 9.30am, and staff would be expected to
give up three days' floating holidays to equalise holidays awarded to manual
workers.
The company also proposed to make #100 bonus payments to each of the 1200
permanent workers and pro-rata payments to about 200 temporary workers, based
on service, and suggested this could be paid into their wages before Christmas
if the deal was accepted.
Management also indicated its desire to give job guarantees to the workforce
for the next 12 months, if enough work could be secured.
Mr David Cooper, shop stewards' convener at the yard, would not be drawn on the
possibility of industrial action last night, saying: ``The yard is working
normally and negotiations are continuing.''
Kvaerner Govan is awaiting confirmation of twoorders which would secure the
1200 permanent jobs at the yard until 1998.

THE father of tragic ecstasy teenager Leah Betts paid tribute to his ``pretty
little ship'' at her funeral yesterday.
Leah collapsed and died following her 18th birthday party after taking a single
tablet of the drug.
Yesterday her retired policeman father Paul spoke of the torment and heartbreak
of coming to terms with his daughter's death.
In his address to the congregation which packed into the family's parish
church, Christ Church, Latchingdon, Essex, he told the mourners, many of whom
were grieving teenage friends of Leah, how he saw his daughter as a ship and
himself as the captain.
In the analogy to Leah, based on the family's favourite pastime of sailing, he
said how the captain ``thought he had prepared the little ship for anything
that the sea could throw at it and it could communicate as and when needed''.
``He trusted it with all his heart and believed that wherever it went it would
return safely.
``One day,'' he said, ``the little ship was to enter uncharted waters,
unbeknown to its captain.
``The evening started calmly with a gentle glow in the sky, and the little ship
was decked out in all its splendour with a soft wind filling the sails, but it
was not long before the little ship was in a full-blown storm.''
Choking back tears, Mr Betts went on: ``All of a sudden a gigantic wave lifted
the little ship into the air and tossed it on to jagged rocks.''
He said his little ship had been lost for ever but he spoke proudly of how his
daughter's donation of her organs had brought life to six others.
Leah's brother, William, also spoke movingly of his sister as a ``beautiful
rose which stood out from all the other flowers''.
The 11-year-old said: ``The lovely rose grew too close to a weed which started
to wrap around it and as it struggled to get free the weed became too tight and
the rose died.''
In his sermon, the Rev Dr Don Gordon described Leah as ``a loving, lovable and
lovely girl''.
He spoke of her enthusiasm for life, her plans to study for A-levels and go on
to become a teacher.
Leah's father and her step-mother, Janet, had used Leah's death to bring home
the message of the evil of drugs, he said, and had saved in turn many other
young lives.
He said: ``Could it be that in 10 or 15 years observers will look back and say
`That was the turning point, that was a historic situation'.''
Many people from the local community gathered outside the church, listening as
music from Leah's favourite band Oasis was relayed on speakers.
At the end of the service her coffin was led out to Whitney Houston's I Will
Always Love You.
Leah was buried at Great Burstead cemetery alongside her mother, Dorothy, who
died in 1992.

<HEADLINE>Two charges admitted Leeson  jailed for six years</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975093933</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FORMER futures trader Nick Leeson was sentenced this morning to six-and-a-half
years for his part in the #860m collapse of Barings Bank.
The time Leeson has already spent in a German jail will be subtracted from the
time he has to serve in Singapore.
In court yesterday he admitted two charges connected with the spectacular
failure of Britain's oldest merchant bank.
He was charged with cheating Barings' auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, by telling
them that he had enough money to cover his trading activities.
He was also charged with deceiving Simex, the Singapore International Monetary
Exchange, and persuading it to release more than #76m.
He had already served nearly nine months in the German jail while awaiting
extradition to Singapore. As a consequence, his sentence was backdated to March
2, 1995.
He was sentenced by Judge Richard Magnus, who said: ``The accused was in a
position of trust. He had used that position to trade his honesty and
integrity. The sentence must be sufficiently substantial to indicate the
gravity of the offense to the public.''
He added: ``The facts speak of the criminal enterprise of the accused. The
facts conclusively support the two charges.''
Leeson was expressionless as the sentence was passed.
He was convicted yesterday after pleading guilty to the two charges of
cheating, and the prosecution dropped the remaining nine charges of fraud and
forgery.
Leeson was sentenced to six years for misreporting details about the status of
around #300m in Barings contracts on Febuary 1. That meant Simex released money
to Barings that it should not have.
He received an additional six months for forging documents to deceive Coopers
and Lybrand to believe Barings had received $78m from the New York firm Spear,
Leeds and Kellogg in February.
Prosecutor Lawrence Ang portrayed Leeson as a young trader who used lies and
deceit and resorted to cut-and-paste forgery to conceal losses from regulators.
Leeson, who managed futures trading operations in Singapore, bet that Japan's
stock market would rise. When it slumped after the Kobe earthquake, he doubled
his bets in an attempt to recoup his losses. After he completely wiped out
Barings' cash reserves, Leeson left Singapore.
In pleading for a lenient sentence, defense lawyer John Koh called Leeson's
gambles the ``misguided acts of a dynamic, but in the final analysis,
insufficiently experienced trader.''
Mr Koh also blamed Leeson's chiefs in London for not controlling his
activities. Leeson was in charge of trading as well as keeping his own books,
in effect policing himself.
He noted that Leeson was a first time offender; that he did not personally
profit from the deals; that no substantial loss was caused to investors or to
Singapore's reputation; and that he returned voluntarily to face trial.
Mr Koh, yesterday handed prosecutor Lawrence Ang a Midland Bank cheque for
#50,464 and pledged that the remainder of the #70,000 prosecution costs would
be paid soon.
Leeson had to borrow against his interest in London properties owned by his
wife to do so, Mr Koh said.
Mr Koh told the court that Leeson was sorry, and ``contrary to speculation,
there are no secret profits. Our client has no assets''.
Proceeds from a #450,000 book deal Leeson made for his memoirs ``will go to the
agent, the ghostwriter, English and German lawyers and Singapore counsel,'' he
said.
Any other likelihood of Leeson profiting from his notoriety was remote, because
a writ had been served on him in Britain to strip him of possible gains.
``Any Hollywood movie is
highly improbable,'' he added in a reference to reports about a possible
Hollywood film about the Barings collapse featuring Hugh Grant, star of Four
Weddings and a Funeral.
Leeson's wife, Lisa, meanwhile, was keeping out of the limelight back in
Britain.
Providing a glimpse into the trauma that Leeson suffered during the Barings
debacle, Mr Koh revealed yesterday that she had suffered a miscarriage at the
end of             January.
Speculation is rife in Singapore that Leeson may have struck a deal involving
him detailing to investigators the role played by Barings executives in the
bank's collapse.
The island state's Commercial Affairs Department is believed to be particularly
interested in the role of Mr Peter Norris, Barings' former head of investment
banking in London; Mr James Bax, Leeson's boss in Singapore; and Mr Simon
Jones, director of Baring Futures Singapore.
However, back in Britain, a spokesman for the Serious Fraud Office emphasisied
that it had not uncovered any evidence of criminal actions by London-based
Barings staff.
He reiterated the SFO's consistently expressed view that Singapore was the most
appropriate jurisdiction for Leeson's prosecution. But the SFO continued to
take a keen interest in developments in Singapore.
Mr Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham and a writer on derivatives who
campaigned for Leeson to be tried in Britain, expressed disappointment about
the way the case had been handled.
He said: ``This confirms what we always feared, that Leeson back in Singapore
would not have to face rigorous examination to tell the whole truth in public
about the collapse of Barings and the involvement of executives in London in
its collapse.''

THE LIARS' CLUB
Mary Karr
Picador, #14.99. LEECHFIELD was voted one of the 10 ugliest places on earth.
There is a small east Texan town and a cancer blackspot to rival Chernobyl and
Bhopal. It is situated on the swampy rim of the Gulf of Mexico, and is home to
an oil refinery and its workers.
The Liars' Club was a handful of oil workers who met in the American Legion Bar
to drink salted beer, play dominoes, shoot pool and tell lies. Mary Karr's
father was undisputed champion.
This is a shrewdly conducted memoir. Karr often seems overawed by her material
and continually stresses its veracity, usually after another fantastic
revelation which causes one to reflect upon on the title and the fact that she
was allowed to sit in on some of the fabling sessions.
Karr is a Professor of Creative Writing and Literature at Syracuse University
and has constructed her memoir like a novel. Pictures are continually blurred;
half memories, little more than snapshots, beginnings of incidents arrive
without reason as though the whole was too painful to recall, as though the
entire memory had been misplaced.
Or she traces the lies, tries to deconstruct the stories and diminish their
power, taking one of her father's myths and tracing the truth, or using it to
take her into a memory of her own, until the two become confused. ``I've plumb
forgot where I am, for an instant,'' she confesses at one point. ``Which is how
a good lie should take you. At the same time, I'm more where I was inside
myself than before Daddy started talking, which is how lies can tell you the
truth.''
She says little, other than by implication, about a family or society which
needs to lie to itself. Her father's lies, she says, were a fence, built
between him and the other men, `` . . . put up to keep them from knowing him
better''.
And as the narrative vacillates between truth and fiction, the techniques are
entirely fictional, using the opening sequence - ``a single instant surrounded
by dark'' - as a recurring theme which dominates the narrative. It is a memory
that took 30 years to unfreeze.
Mary is seven and her sister Lecia is nine. They are alone in the house with
the local sheriff and family doctor. The doctor kneels before her on a mattress
on the bare floor, gently pulling at the hem of her favourite nightgown. ``Show
me the marks,'' he says.
Their mother is drunk and missing. Their father is working at the oil refinery.
Lecia is pretending to sleep. Mary is trying to pinch her awake; something she
does continually throughout the book which becomes a story of untangling this
single memory.
When first published in America, The Liars' Club sold by word of mouth alone.
It is now shifting 10,000 copies a week in the States and a big movie deal has
been made.
It isn't hard to see why. It is the perfect testimony to America's therapy
culture, where the tribulations of someone worse off than yourself are a source
of inspiration and comfort, where a happy ending comes with the genre. It
shines light into dark corners, rattles skeletons and gives hope to those who
need to help themselves and are reliant upon inspirational pieces written by
someone telling you what to do rather than share an experience. It is the real
thing, the perfect antidote to inspirational works that are plotted like
mystery novels, where all will be well when you finish the book.

A LOT of water has run over the Mersey Tunnel since Sandra and Beryl gave up
the lease on their Liverpool flat and went their separate ways almost 20 years
ago. But now television writer Carla Lane is planning to bring them back
together with a new series of The Liver Birds.
Ms Lane, more concerned with animal welfare than comedy scripts these days,
confirmed yesterday she had written seven new episodes of the series she
created. But she will only go ahead if all the original cast agree to take
part. Provided they do, then rehearsals will begin early in the New Year.
The Liver Birds, one of the most successful sitcoms of the Seventies, starred
Nerys Hughes and Polly James as the two fun-loving Scouse flatmates with a
carefree lifestyle and outrageous fashion sense.
The new series will pick up two decades on. According to Ms Lane, one of the
girls will have lived an exciting life while the other will have been caught up
with domestic responsibilities. However, she would not reveal which one was
which.
After the original series, Nerys Hughes, now aged 53, went on to star in a
number of television dramas. Ms James, now 54, carved herself a successful
career on the stage and has only rarely been involved in television work.
Ms Lane, who went on to write award-winning sitcoms like Bread and Butterflies,
is convinced that the Liver Birds will work second time around.
``After meeting them I felt quite excited and thought it was a good idea after
all so I agreed,'' Ms Lane said. ``Writing the scripts was easy because I know
the characters so well. The real worry for me is that the original series was
glitzy fun and they dressed in ridiculous fashions so it has stayed in people's
memory that way.
``It's very hard to take two women in their 50s and make them like that. Now
they have responsibilities and we will see how they are coping. As a writer I
have matured since then and I'm hoping people will be pleasantly surprised. I
feel pleased and I think it will work,'' Ms Lane said.
q Daytime television presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan are moving
their long-running This Morning programme to London from Liverpool, it was
announced yesterday.
The husband-and-wife team said they had become frustrated at the refusal of
some international stars to travel north for interviews.

THE clearest hint yet that the long-delayed Loch Lomond by-laws will be
ratified by the end of the year was given yesterday by Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth during a short visit to the area.
On a grey, chilly morning, with the loch totally free of screaming power boats,
water ski craft and jet skis, Mr Forsyth said it would take ``pretty powerful
arguments'' to convince him to overturn the view taken by the local authorities
that the by-laws were necessary to cut down on bad behaviour and conflict
between loch users.
He sidestepped the question put to him by The Herald on whether or not he
favoured a joint board - which would carry planning powers, its own budgets and
staff - over the current joint committee made up from the three new unitary
authorities bordering the loch which leaves the future running of the area
essentially unchanged.
He also refused to be drawn on whether he thought fast water sport was
ultimately a sustainable activity at a beauty spot.
Mr Forsyth took the opportunity to emphasise that yesterday's consultation
exercise was very much in line with his announcement on the previous day of
greater power for local authorities. However, he may yet amend the by-law
proposals to meet objections put forward by the Scottish Sports Council which
have been the cause of the delays.
As he disembarked from the Loch Lomond Park Authority's patrol boat at Luss,
the Scottish Secretary said he had to take the by-laws decision soon so he had
taken the opportunity to see exactly what the implications were.
``Yesterday I talked about the importance I attach to the devolving of power,
and with that responsibility, down to local government and to give local
authorities more freedom to formulate by-laws. This has been trivialised by
some of my opponents but it is an important issue of civic life,'' he said.
By-laws could be used to stop drinking in the open in towns and cities, he
said, admitting that the Scottish Office had taken a restrictive view in the
past.
``I think it is a matter for individual councils and I want to see an extension
of the freedom of local authorities in this area. Today what is under
consideration is the use of by-laws to ensure a speed limit inside a cordon
around the shore line to allow people to practise such sports as swimming,
canoeing, sailing or fishing and to limit the use of high-powered speed boats
where there would be safety or environmental considerations and conflicts with
other users.
``It is my intention to make a decision before the end of the year and I would
need to have some pretty powerful arguments to make me overturn the views which
have been taken by local authorities who are, after all, the democratically
elected bodies with responsibility for this area.''
He said that he considered Loch Lomond to be a very special place, not just
because his constituency boundary ran through its centre but because it was
important to Scotland and had great natural beauty and environmental importance.

AT the grand old age of 106, Margaret Duncan knows exactly how to hook a man.
Glasgow's oldest citizen, born when Victoria was Queen and the Eiffel Tower was
just being built, had the city's Lord Provost and comedian Andy Cameron dancing
attendance at her birthday party yesterday.
As Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall handed over a set of silver teaspoons, a case of
wine and a tartan shawl, she joked: ``I think you must think I'm getting
married again.'' That would make husband number three for Margaret, who has
already outlived two spouses.
Her first husband, whom she married at 45, was an ``elderly man'' of 66. Her
second was a 67-year-old ``toyboy'', whom she wed for companionship when she
was 72.
But the fragile lady with the big laugh suffered heartbreak as a young woman.
Her first love, Harry Glover from Shettleston, was killed in the First World
War when she was 22.
These days Margaret, who still regrets she did not have children, is rarely
separated from her new male companion - her budgie Harvey.
Much has changed in her life since she was born in Glasgow's East End, the
youngest of four children.
Times in Britain, under the government of Lord Salisbury, were hard. But
Margaret has fond memories of her childhood, in the days when trams ran through
Glasgow and the River Clyde was booming with industry.
She said: ``When I was a girl you didn't have the television, but we were quite
happy without it because we all got round the piano at night and sang.''
She has not lost her taste for the simple things. Yesterday she prepared to
celebrate with a lunch of her favourite Scotch broth, followed by silverside
and butter beans.
And afterwards, there was no doubt about a sing song: her favourite is the old
music hall song, Who's your lady friend?

It was a natural and, in Scotland at least, an apparently never-ending source
of power. Now, as
Eileen Goodchild discovers, efforts are being
made to harness Glasgow's rivers
IN areas like Strathclyde, rivers, constantly replenished by rain, are an
obvious source of energy and our ancestors made full use of them. Grinding corn
by hand for bread-making must be one of the most tedious jobs ever invented.
Then someone had the bright idea of harnessing the energy of a river to a wheel
coupled to a grindstone and took the backache out of grinding corn.
Two hundred years ago the bulk of Europe's flour was produced between hefty
grindstones turned by water-driven wheels. It was low-grade technology but it
worked well and provided about one hundred million people with flour. Even the
small mill on the Allander at Milngavie, known as Gavin's Mill, was sending
flour to Cornwall. The water-driven Newmills Grain Mill on the River Leith
supplied the West Indies with barley meal for feeding slaves.
Massive handbuilt water wheels empowered much else. The slitting and grinding
mill at Pointhouse, erected in 1734 by the Smithfield Iron Company, had eight
water wheels. These turned the rollers of a slitting mill and operated a pair
of shears for slitting and clipping bars of iron into suitable lengths for
making horseshoes and nails. Sawmills, waulk mills, cotton mills, and paper
mills obtained their energy from the river. There was even a ``shammy''
(chamois leather) mill on the banks of the White Cart near the Shaw Bridge,
built in 1735 to the specifications of the Tassie family, Protestant refugees
from Italy.
The wheels and machinery of those early grain mills were made from wood by
highly skilled craftsmen. The act of milling involved balancing the power
produced by the water wheel against the resistance to motion offered by the
internal machinery and the great runner stone.
An arrangement of simple levers and ropes enabled the miller to control the
water driving the wheel and the amount of grain entering the millstones. During
the milling he adjusted the gap between the stones by raising or lowering the
``runner'' stone.
Failure to get the adjustments right either brought the whole operation to a
``grinding halt'' or damaged the stones. No precise system of measuring the gap
was employed. Instead a sample of the meal emerging from the stones was tested
by the miller using that oldest of man's measurements, ``the rule of thumb''.
He assessed the quality of the meal by rubbing it between his thumb and
fingers. An experienced miller developed a broad, polished thumb.
The law of Scotland in the year 1248 enacted that no-one was to grind corn by
hand except in an emergency. The miller was entitled to keep back his ``toll'',
about one-sixth of volume of grain, or peas or berries. The farmers of an
estate were ``thirled'' to the mill until the Act was cancelled in 1799. Today
we are all ``thirled'' to the electricity companies: we may not generate our
own electricity.
Glasgow's first mill belonged to the Church and was situated on the now
banished Molendinar Burn quite close to the cathedral. The name means ``The
Mill on the Hill''. The burn, once a trout steam, is today a sewer. In the
twelfth century the church abandoned it in favour of advantages offered by the
natural waterfall on the faster flowing Kelvin at Yorkhill. The falls have a
10ft drop and the Incorporation of Glasgow Baxters, who operated a mill higher
upstream, later calculated the work value of the flow at 60hp.
The Baxters owned an orchard in Partick by the Kelvin in which grew a
magnificent pear tree. Once a year when the fruit was ripe a little ceremony
was held, ``the shaking of the pear tree''. Would-be purchasers assembled in
the orchard and the crop was sold to the highest bidder. He was not allowed to
climb the tree to harvest his crop. Instead a cloth was stretched out tightly
round and under it and the fruit was shaken off.
A later Baxters mill was rebuilt several times and in 1903 became the property
of the Scottish Co-op, producing ``Lofty Peak'' flour until the 1970s. The site
is now the Kelvin Hall car-park.
It wasn't until the 1800s that steam power started to overtake water as a main
source of energy. The lower reaches of the Kelvin were too flat for the
overshot wheel. From 1850 onwards the surviving mills at Partick were using
turbines and electricity. The Scotstoun Mill, which belongs to RHM Foods, is
still grinding flour, about 700 tons a week, which is sent to the company's
Duke Street Bakery. A nineteenth-century mill building stands on the site of
the oldest mill. It is now called the ``Bishop's Mill Court'' and has been
converted into 20 flats. The original stone wheatsheaves still crown the gable
ends.
However, at Milngavie, where the Allander drops sharply down the hillside, the
miller was able to take advantage of the new-style water wheel. He
reconstructed the dam and lade and installed an overshot wheel. The original
wheel, which dipped into the Allander, was on the other side of the building.
The mill was worked until around 1945. The lade was demolished when the town
expanded, but the wheel is still there.
At Baldernock a small sawmill is still empowered by the work energy it receives
from one of the many little burns that tumble down the Campsies. The mill
building dates from the sixteenth century when it was a grain mill and included
a kiln where the grain was dried before milling. The mill dam is 250 yards
upstream. The lade runs from the weir below the dam to the mill and a ``heck''
prevents debris from blocking the tunnel under the road. The mill owner and a
group of enthusiasts are making heroic efforts to carry out urgent repairs both
to the lade and the machinery.

MONKLANDS District Council - the subject of a ``jobs for the boys'' inquiry -
revealed yesterday it had won a prestigious award for commitment to the
training and development of its workers.
The award comes a week after the Government inquiry into allegations that
councillors on the Lanarkshire authority used their powers to get family and
friends jobs on the workforce.
During the inquiry headed by Mr William Nimmo-Smith, QC, evidence was heard
from witnesses that senior members of the Labour controlled council issued
green application forms to show they were backing individual applicants for
jobs.
Mr Nimmo-Smith will make his findings known to Secretary of State, Mr Michael
Forsyth, later this month. If he finds councillors have failed in their
statutory duty in hiring staff, then Mr Forsyth may take legal action against
certain councillors.
Several allegations surrounding the jobs claims centred on those employed in
the housing department.
But yesterday the council's housing department announced it had become the
first in Scotland to win the Investors In People Award - a nationally
recognised standard aimed at raising the level of commitment to training and
development among employers.
Monklands Housing, which administers the letting of 21,000 houses, shows its
long-term commitment to its 260 workers through new staffing structures,
intensive on-going training courses and a more effective communications
strategy, a council spokeswoman said.
Housing convener, Councillor Betty Leitch, a witness at the inquiry who said
her two relatives got their council jobs on their own merit, praised the
housing office.
She said: ``The housing department's success follows two years of intensive
work towards achieving the certification and we are delighted to be the first
local authority to attain it.''

A MOTHER left a child unrestrained in the back of her car while she drove under
the influence of alcohol or drugs, a court heard yesterday.
The woman, 31, of Forres, Moray, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was
reported after she stopped her car to ask a passer-by for directions in Elgin
last June.
She yesterday admitted a total of four charges, including neglect, in Elgin
Sheriff Court.
Fiscal James MacKay said the woman refused on two occasions to supply police
with a specimen of her breath for testing.
``Police became concerned about the accused's fitness to look after the girl
after the doctor found her to an extent to be under the influence of alcohol
and marginally not fit to be in charge of the child,'' Mr MacKay said.
``The child was released into the care of a family friend.''
He invited Sheriff Noel McPartlin to refer the case to the Children's Panel.
The woman's agent, Mr Alastair Russell, said: ``During the early part of this
year she faced circumstances which placed her under great strain and anguish
and she felt the woman (from whom she had asked directions) had contributed to
that anguish.''
Mr Russell said the accused had drunk two cans of cider.
Sheriff McPartlin deferred sentence until later this month for social inquiry
and community service reports.

A 33-year-old man appeared in court yesterday accused of threatening to shoot
policemen during a siege at a house in Glasgow on Thursday night. Mr Brian
Campbell, of Tormusk Road, Castlemilk, did not enter a plea and was detained
for inquiries.
Witnesses sought
POLICE are seeking witnesses to an attack on an 85-year-old woman in Scott
Street, Perth, at 4.40pm on Thursday. The elderly woman suffered a broken hip
and was seriously ill in hospital yesterday. The attacker, a young man who
stole her handbag, was confronted by a passer-by and ran off towards Perth High
Street.
Cannabis fine
A WOMAN was yesterday fined #500 in Dingwall Sheriff Court for drug offences.
Heather Newsome, 33, of Langlands Terrace, Kyle of Lochalsh, had admitted
cultivation and possession of cannabis.
Doctor impostor
A FORMER hospital attendant who dressed as a doctor and went on a stealing
spree was yesterday warned he faced jail. Gavin MacKenzie, 47, of Glen Court,
Inverness, admitted 11 offences at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness between
September 1994 and June 1995 but pleaded not guilty to 20 other charges. The
sheriff deferred sentence.
Last sighting
A MAN, 69, found beaten to death in his South Yorkshire home was last seen
alive on Wednesday night, police said yesterday. Widower Maurice Hoyle died of
head injuries sustained in an apparently motiveless attack.
Soccer hearing
THE hearing of match-fixing allegations against football players John Fashanu,
Bruce Grobbelaar and Hans Segers was adjourned yesterday until January 3.
Chester recovering
ENTERTAINER Charlie Chester has been moved to Nunnery Fields Hospital,
Canterbury, for rehabilitation after a stroke last week. A BBC radio spokesman
said doctors were hopeful of improvement.
Escapee warning
A PSYCHIATRIC prisoner who has escaped could become dangerous in certain
circumstances, the Scottish Office warned yesterday. Robert Moor, 52, who
escaped from Dykebar Hospital in Paisley, was acquitted of murder on the
grounds of insanity in 1971.
Youth flees
A JUVENILE detainee, known as the ``Pyjama Boy'' since his first institutional
escape at the age of 11, has escaped again. The 14-year-old was sent to a
children's home on the edge of Dartmoor last week on counts of burglary,
dangerous driving and car theft.

Radio
station
sacks head
of news
MANAGEMENT at a Scottish radio station yesterday sacked one of their top
executives.
But the head of news with Aberdeen-based Northsound has contacted his lawyers
and yesterday vowed to fight his dismissal.
Mr Jonathan Moore was suspended earlier this week and yesterday was dismissed
from the station, which sponsors Aberdeen FC.
A spokesman for the company said: ``We can confirm that Mr Moore's contract has
been terminated. It is an internal matter.''
Mr Moore had been head of news at Northsound for the past two years. He joined
the station after spells at Dundee-based Radio Tay and Edinburgh-based Radio
Forth.
All three stations are part of the Scottish Radio Holdings group which also
owns Radio Clyde in Glasgow.
Scottish Radio Holdings insiders said Mr Moore was sacked after completing a
freelance contract for PR Consultants Scotland.
Later Dundee-born Mr Moore, 29, issued a statement which said: ``I can confirm
that I was dismissed by Northsound Radio for alleged breach of contract. I
strongly deny this and I am meeting my lawyers next week when we will discuss
an application to an Industrial Tribunual for unfair dismissal.''
Mr John MacDonald, the Aberdeen director of Shandwick Scotland, the public
relations company which was until recently known as PR Consultants Scotland,
said yesterday: ``I can confirm that John Moore, of Northsound, has recently
done work for us on a freelance basis, as indeed have other personnel at the
radio station.''
He added: ``However, I am not prepared to discuss money figures in this
context.''
A legal battle now seems imminent at the station which is already involved in a
wrangle over rights to cover football matches involving Aberdeen ... the team
it sponsors.
Rival station Scot FM, whose broadcast area does not cover Aberdeen, has an
exclusive radio contract to cover Scottish Football League matches in Scotland.
Northsound has reported the situation to the Office of Fair Trading because it
believes BBC Radio Scotland has a monopoly in its area because it has a
separate public sector contract which allows it to broadcast league matches.

A NORTH Sea oil rig painter who claimed he had suffered psychiatric injuries
from watching colleagues die in the Piper Alpha disaster yesterday lost his bid
for #200,000 damages.
Mr William Hegarty, 43, of Bonhill, Alexandria, was aboard the 23,000 tonne
support vessel MSV Tharos which tried to pick up survivors and aid the stricken
platform as it was destroyed by a series of explosions on July 6, 1988,
resulting in 167 fatalities.
Mr Hegarty said he would be appealing against the decision.
He told the High Court in London his life had been in danger at the time and
said he had since suffered post traumatic stress syndrome and depression.
Mr Justice Popplewell in his judgment said Mr Hegarty was a man of ``ordinary
fortitude'' who was genuinely in fear of his life. But he dismissed the action
``with regret'', saying Mr Hegarty's life had never been in real danger.
Last night Mr Hegarty said: ``It was a shock. I expected to win. I thought the
legal system was fair.''
Mr Hegarty said he had not worked since the disaster and added: ``I still
suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. I haven't slept properly for
seven-and-a-half years. I can't sleep without medication. I still dream about
it and it will not go away.''
Mr Hegarty claimed a huge fireball engulfed the support vessel, which he said
had moved to within 25 metres of Piper Alpha. ``The company owed me a duty of
care and I think they broke that rule.''
Mr Hegarty, who has a wife and four children, said he had fallen deeply into
debt since he stopped working and his lifestyle had completely changed.
His claim for personal injury and consequential loss, was brought under common
law and under regulations of the Off-Shore Installations Operational Safety
Regulations 1976.
Mr Justice Popplewell said: ``There were a number or risks resulting from this
fire but I am quite unable to conclude that anything that happened that night
was `likely to endanger' Mr Hegarty's safety or health. Accordingly, with
regret, I must dismiss this action.''
He ruled that the Piper owners, E. E Caledonia Ltd, formerly Occidental
Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd, had owed Mr Hegarty no ``duty of care''. He noted
that the Tharos could never have been within 25 metres of Piper Alpha and the
only damage to the vessel was blistering of paint.
He said: ``It was undoubtedly a catastrophe of the highest order, it was
shocking, frightening and devastating, not only for those on Piper Alpha but
those on Tharos who had to watch the horrendous unfolding of events without
being able to contribute materially to the welfare of those on Piper.
``Mr Hegarty was present for about two hours before he was evacuated.''
The judge said he had been shown photographs and a film of the disaster, but
they ``did not start to convey the horror of that night. However, they do not
show a fireball either approaching Tharos or engulfing it''.
The judge said he had heard evidence from others who witnessed the disaster and
from the Tharos's skipper, Captain Alistair Letty.
He said he accepted Captain Letty's evidence that the fireball had, at no time,
actually reached Tharos.

THE death of an elderly man found lying on the toilet floor at his GP's surgery
cannot be attributed to the time it took to find him, a fatal accident inquiry
was told yesterday.
John Ross, aged 86, died eight days after being found unconscious on the floor
of the Muiredge Surgery in Buckhaven. He had lain there for 30 hours before
being discovered. The Fatal Accident Inquiry at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court heard
that the former docker suffered from two life-threatening conditions which
could not have been treated, even if they had occurred in hospital.
Mr Ross disappeared on August 1 after leaving his home in Sea Road, Methil to
collect a prescription for his wife.
Mr Ross' son Harry, expressed shock and dismay that his father had lain
undiscovered for so long.
When his father failed to return home, the inquiry heard, Harry Ross went to
the surgery to collect his mother's prescription, unaware his father was lying
in the toilets. He claimed receptionists had told him his father had not been
to the surgery that day.
Dr Peter Walker, a pathologist, reported that he could not separate the
unrelated major stroke and lung-damaging blood clots which either singly or
together killed Mr Ross and expressed ``surprise'' that the deceased had had no
symptoms of ill health.
The post mortem examination revealed that Mr Ross had suffered a series of
embolisms - blood clots - in the month prior to his death.
Dr Walker told Sheriff Gail Patrick that Mr Ross suffered from the type of
arterial disease common in the elderly, caused by an accumulation of deposits
associated with fatty foods.
The arteries at the base of his brain were ``severely diseased'' which caused a
``major'' stroke for which there was no adequate treatment.
Mr Ross had also suffered thrombosis in his legs resulting in blocked arteries
causing lung damage and he had suffered a further episode just prior to his
death in Kirkcaldy's Victoria Hospital.
Questioned by depute fiscal Christine Baillie, he said there was no connection
between the stroke and the embolisms, adding that he believed Mr Ross's
collapse in the toilets was the start of the stroke.
Asked by Miss Baillie if immediate discovery would have made any difference to
the prognosis, Dr Walker said: ``I feel none at all,'' as, facing two
potentially and factually life-threatening conditions, neither of which would
benefit from primary treatment, Mr Ross ``could have died at anytime''.
Questioned by Ross family lawyer, David Ritchie the pathologist agreed it was
possible Mr Ross had collapsed as the result of the embolism.
Asked by Mr Ritchie if it was possible the stress of that could have brought on
the stroke, Dr Walker said: ``Not in my opinion,'' but added that it was at
least ``theoretically possible.''
Asked if he would accept the fact that lying for 30 hours in the toilet
possibly led to Mr Ross's early death, Dr Walker said: ``No. I find it
surprising he lived as long as he did.''
Responding to questions from lawyer Susan Craig, representing the Muiredge
Practice, Dr Walker expressed the view that had Mr Ross suffered the embolism
at the surgery he would not have been unconscious but would have died.
Ms Craig asked, ``So if he had collapsed with the embolism, they would have
found a dead body?'' Dr Walker replied: ``Yes.''
He also told her that if Mr Ross had survived an embolism and been admitted to
hospital he did not think doctors could have predicted a stroke and that in any
case there was ``no primary or adequate treatment for either of these killers.''
The inquiry heard from practice doctor Swapan Mukherjee that Mr Ross, who
suffered from osteo-arthirits and some prostate trouble, did not regularly
visit his GP.
He added that he and his colleagues were ``devasted'' when Mr Ross was found on
the evening of August 2 and it was realised that neither checks by practice
staff nor cleaners had discovered him earlier. Receptionist Mary Wilson told
the inquiry that she had failed to check the cubicles in the toilet before
locking up.
Dr Mukherjee revealed that under verbal procedures in force prior to the
incident the rooms were to be checked prior to closure to ensure the lights
were off and there was no one in them.
He told Miss Baillie that as a result of the incident, and recognising the
inadequacy of the measures, a new written checking procedure had been
introduced which included checking the toilets four times a day. Surgery staff
on duty on the day in question, he noted, had been disciplined.
The inquiry continues on December 19.

A PERJURY trial was halted at Stranraer Sheriff Court yesterday after the
accused collapsed in the dock and had to be taken to hospital.
The jury had taken its place and Sheriff Robert Dickson was taking the bench
when Mrs Jill Thorley fell to the floor screaming and moaning.
As jurors were taken from the court police officers attended the woman, who
appeared to be having breathing difficulties, before paramedics and a local
doctor arrived to examine her. She was taken by ambulance to the Garrick
Hospital in Stranraer and has been detained for observation.
Mrs Thorley, 51, of Knocknar, Monreith, Port William, pleads not guilty to
charges of perjury and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
It is alleged that on August 18, 1994, at Stranraer Sheriff Court, having been
sworn in as a witness to give evidence at a Fatal Accident Inquiry
investigating the death of Daniel Dailly Lowe, a patient at Hillcrest
retirement home, Wigtown, she said that her son Robert David Thorley was the
sleep-in member of staff at the home on February 6, 1994, and that the level of
staff was sufficient to take it within the guidelines of the social work
department, the truth being as she well knew that Robert David Thorley was not
sleeping in the home and the only member of staff was Marie Blackley.
She further denies that between February 6 and August 17, 1994, she induced
Robert David Thorley and Marie Blackley to give false information to the
police, procurator-fiscal Francis Walkingshaw and to give false evidence at the
FAI at Stranraer Sheriff Court and to pretend that they had been on duty at the
home on February 6 when Daniel Lowe left the home and this she did with intent
to deceive the authorities over the staffing levels.
Sheriff Dickson formally adjourned the case and said that he would await
further medical information on Mrs Thorley's condition.

NEW rules governing approved rifle and pistol clubs will come into effect from
January 1 following a report by an independent committee which advises the Home
Secretary and the Scottish Office.
In future, members, prospective members and guests must sign a declaration
stating that they are not prohibited from possessing a firearm.
The concept of ``novice'' membership is to be abolished, because in the past,
members could attend clubs for basic training - but not shoot - which led to
confusion.
Probationary membership, which allows a newcomer to be individually trained in
safe practice, and to shoot under the supervision of experienced club members
remains, but the minimum period of probation has been reduced to three months.
By making the changes the Firearms Consultative Committee has addressed a
number of concerns expressed by police and rifle and pistol clubs.
Advocate Mr Kevin Drummond, who served on the committee, yesterday said: ``The
new rules are the result of careful examination of the criteria.
``I am confident this revisal will be welcomed by the police, and the shooting
community.''

Don't even think about taking your child
to the slopes in an old anorak and jeans, says Fergus Wyllie.  Today's
fashion-smart kids won't get out of the car-park without thermal insulation and
avalanche reflectors
TO say that children's ski clothing is a growing industry is a bit like saying
that Alberto Tomba gets to the bottom of the hill quickly.
More and more manufacturers are producing not only jackets, trousers, and suits
specially designed for youngsters, but also scaled-down versions of the latest
adult gear, in hi-tech, waterproof, wind-resistant, thermally-insulated,
all-singing, all-dancing material.
It has to look right or you can bet your bottom dollar that junior will not
even consider putting his or her arms inside it. Style and quality clothing is
not cheap, especially considering how quickly the youngster will grow out of
it, but it is important that your cherished offspring does not turn into an ice
lolly while braving the arctic conditions on Scottish slopes for hours on end.
There is a flourishing trade in second-hand children's ski wear for this reason.
One example of very smart scaled-down adult gear is Killy's Mougli jacket and
Picasso trousers as worn by Neil Watters, 11, a member of a race training class
at Glasgow Ski Centre in Bellahouston Park.
Both the matt-finish jacket and trousers are made with Entrant G11 waterproof
and breathable fabric and have all the necessary press-studs, zippers, hood,
and flaps to keep bad weather at bay. The jacket, which has a Recco avalanche
reflector and detector, costs #150 and the trousers #80.
Six-year-old Gail Ross is wearing Nevica's Sonic jacket, also with the
avalanche reflector and detector, and Zebedee trousers. They are waterproof and
breathable and cost #100 and #56.
Chuck Roast clothing from New England in the United States is relatively new to
Scotland and combines bright, attractive colours with good performance. Ladi
Smrcek, 10, is wearing a Teflon-coated waterproof jacket (#60) and Polartec
Snow Pants (#24) while Gabriella Flynn models the Snow Pants and Kennebec
fleece (#36), again made from Polartec fabric which is very lightweight, has
good insulation and breathing qualities, and is claimed to be ``non-bobbling''
after machine-washing. Chuck Roast is available from Tiso shops.

Fergus Wyllie examines the growing confidence in Scots resorts
THIS summer has been a season of growth for Scottish ski areas. Glenshee, which
rather cheekily adopted the title of Britain's ``Trois Vallees'', has gained a
fourth valley by merging with Glencoe.
However, the development which will be of most immediate benefit to skiers is
at Nevis Range where a new chair and tow have opened up extra runs on the
North-east face of Aonach Mor.
The Great Glen chair, from the Snowgoose restaurant to the base of the Nid
ridge, and the Rob Roy T-bar, taking skiers 385m up the ridge, are part of a
#750,000 scheme which includes a chairlift ``over the back'' in Coire Dubh to
be erected next summer.
This year's piste map shows two black and five red runs in the corrie starting
at the Nid ridge. They will not be groomed or snow-fenced but the entrances
will be marked with poles on the ridge. Nevis Range emphasises they may not
always be open, particularly in icy conditions, when the entrances will be
roped off. The ski patrol will be extra vigilant here and will confiscate the
lift pass of any skier who ducks under the ropes of a closed run.
A line of poles will be placed at the bottom of the runs leading back to the
chair and tow so that skiers do not end up halfway to Spean Bridge in poor
visibility. A large cornice often forms along the ridge but it is hoped to keep
the entrances open by grooming and blasting. Eight staff have been on a course
to learn the dangerous art of moving snow with explosives.
Although this development will be very attractive to intermediate and advanced
skiers, the people who will benefit most from the new tow and chair will be
beginners. The green runs beside the restaurant are only reliable in good
winters, whereas the area at the base of the Nid ridge serviced by the chair
and tow has much better snowholding.
The chair, which will be both walk-on walk-off and ski-on ski-off, will also
fill a gap in the progression of beginners at Nevis Range, where the
development has created seven jobs. Until now, learners have started on the
rope tow, moved to the Lochy and Linnhe pomas beside the restaurant, and made
the big jump to the more formidable Alpha poma, taking them on to blue runs if
the snow cover was poor. Now the Great Glen chair will carry them to and from
easy green and blue runs at the base of the Nid ridge.
A new snack bar, Cameron's Tea Hut, has been built there but unfortunately,
like the popular eaterie at the bottom of the Goose run, it will have no
toilets. It seems they cannot be provided due to environmental considerations.
I would have thought the environment might suffer considerably if skiers cannot
be bothered to return to the toilets at the restaurant.
Nevis Range, where a lift pass increases to #17 for an adult and #11 for a
junior (under 18), is opening a snowboard hire shop at the base station with 20
``trays'' at #15.50 a day.
Further south, the most immediate effect of the merger between the Glenshee
Chairlift Company and the White Corries at Glencoe is that the western area
will now open seven days a week, making it a very attractive mid-week prospect
to Central Belt skiers.
The pistes should also be in better condition thanks to overnight grooming by a
#130,000 machine bought with the help of Lochaber Enterprise. Moguls will be
left on one or two runs, however, and the chairlift company stresses that
traditional, hairy Glencoe skiers ``will be able to enjoy what they have always
enjoyed''.
More snow fences have been put on the Plateau to improve snowholding and extend
the length of the season by avoiding that painful walk from the access chair to
the Cliffhanger chair and lower T-bar when the poma track is broken.
A 350-yard trainer tow has been installed parallel to the Plateau poma at
Glencoe to increase the beginners' area.
An adult day lift pass at Glencoe, where 14 winter jobs have been created,
costs #14.50. Sales of a joint season ticket covering Glencoe and Glenshee at a
bargain #210 ceased at the end of October with slightly fewer than 100 sold.
However, canny skiers can buy a book of five-day passes usable at either area
for #60 until December 31.
The Glenshee Chairlift Company, which now effectively runs both areas, resisted
the temptation to market its two areas as Scotland's ``Four Valleys'' and went
for the slogan, Ski Scotland's Super G's (sic). Shame about the apostrophe but
at least it tried to be imaginative.
Snowboarding is big everywhere but especially in Glenshee where the chairlift
company will have 200 boards for hire this season at #12 a day (#17 with soft
boots). It is also opening its own school, the Glenshee Snowboard Academy. It
is not known whether naughty pupils will be spanked, belted, or given lines.
Grampian Enterprise has helped with #100,000 spent on environmental
improvements, such as car park surfacing, grassing, paving, and fencing at
Glenshee, where an adult day lift pass costs #16 this season.
However, the chairlift company's main concern during the summer was its #1.3m
Glen Golf Course in Alyth. It plans to erect the clubhouse next year and open
for business in spring 1997.
The Cairngorm Chairlift Company is also starting its own snowboard school. This
is a new departure as all the ski schools on the hill are independently run. It
has 50 boards for rent at #15 a day and there are literally hundreds of hire
boards available in shops around Aviemore.
Obviously, the company's main efforts have concentrated on getting planning
permission and EU funding for the #15m development plan, which includes a
funicular railway. It received a setback recently when the Cairngorms
Partnership board declared that outstanding issues needed to be resolved before
it could support the project.
The chairlift company's chief executive, Mr Tim Whittome, said that some of the
concerns had now been resolved but that there had been ``shifting of
goalposts'' over objections to the scheme.
Unfortunately, a September deadline for EU Objective One money had been missed
and the company was working towards having planning permission and its own
financial package in place to meet the next one in March. Mr Whittome said that
the earliest construction could start was 1997 with the new uplift open in 1998
and the buildings complete by the end of 1999.
Despite all these difficulties, the chairlift company continues to work at
improving its product, especially customer care. This area, in which training
started last year, will no doubt be improved by the appointment of former Marks
&amp; Spencer executive Anne Angus as general manager.
A high-season, day lift ticket at Cairngorm increases to #17 (child #11.30) and
a morning-only ticket has been introduced at #12. Skiers will pay the full
price but can obtain a #5 refund before a certain time.
Over at the Lecht, they are also gearing up for more and more boarders. A
snowboard park with jumps, walls, and its own tow will be made between the
Eagle and Grouse runs. Unfortunately, a half-pipe is not possible because the
Lecht does not normally have enough snow to build one, and the winds howling
off the Cairngorms would just fill it up with snow every night.
The ski centre has ordered more boards, taking the number for hire up to 44,
and there will be a full-time boarding instructor. Last season, the area had 30
ski instructors teaching mainly beginners at weekends and expects to increase
that number this winter.
There is a new building housing the ski school and a larger shop, run by the
Ski Snow Shop of Aberdeen, selling gloves, hats, goggles, and clothing.
Out on the white stuff, a second, larger piste grooming machine has been
purchased which will improve snow quality, particularly in bad conditions.
One day's full area lift pass costs #11 for an adult and #8 for a child with
ski hire #10 and #7. A combined lift pass and ski hire ticket is available
midweek only for #16 (December and January) and #18 (February and March).

NINE accused, all members of the Scottish League of Gunfighters, had to stand
in the jury boxes at Dundee Sheriff Court yesterday because the dock was not
big enough to contain them all.
They are charged with possessing smooth bore revolvers capable of chambering
and firing .38 calibre cartridges, which had been converted from replica guns
designed to fire blanks, and are also accused of possessing prohibited weapons
without the authority of the Scottish Secretary.
The offences are alleged to have happened in the Scotsman bar in Gellatly
Street, Dundee.
The nine deny the charges.
They are Mr William Townsley, 36, of Tarvett Mill, Cupar; Mr John Cargill, 60,
of Fleming Gardens West, Dundee; Mr Munro Crichton, 51, of Sharps Court,
Dundee; Mr Patrick Welsh, 52, Edzell Court, Dundee; Mr John Martin, 49, of

A degree?
I don't
believe it,
says actor
BELIEVE it or not, Scottish actor Richard Wilson, best known for his role as
irascible pensioner Victor Meldrew, yesterday became an honorary doctor of
Glasgow Caledonian University.
Proposing him for the doctorate, Professor Gordon Dickson, dean of health, said
Mr Wilson had ``committed himself to his profession and achieved excellence in
it'', frequently undertaking ``unsung work'' and offering support to young
aspiring actors.
Meanwhile, the new Principal of Glasgow University yesterday insisted that the
description of ``ivory towers'' no longer applied to British higher education.
In his first address to a graduation ceremony, Professor Graeme Davies said of
that sobriquet: ``Nothing could be further from the truth of the current
situation.''
However, he added: ``For our universities to be able to continue to make the
contribution of which they are capable, and upon which much of the economic and
cultural success of the future will depend, it is important for Government to
ensure that their ability to respond is not jeopardised.''
Professor Davies accepted that universities had to give a high priority to
wealth creation, and cited the work done to help fish farming in Scotland, a
sector which now employs more people than steel and coal production.
``They (universities) are vibrant, exciting and rewarding communities which
have increasingly developed partnerships and networks that penetrate deep into
the commercial, industrial and financial sectors.''
q LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday criticised Government policy on higher
education after being awarded an honorary degree.
Mr Blair, who was made an honorary doctor of civil law by Northumbria
University, later told a news conference that virtually every university in the
country was unhappy about the way it was being treated.
``There are difficulties over funding and would be under any government. But I
think it is essential we find a system that is fairer and allows as many young
people through university as possible.''

From a period when the world went through fundamental changes, Rosemary
Trollope remembers her nursery, a place where time stood still for two
generations
I HAVE an unfair advantage. In my mother's nursery time had stood still, so
that her childhood had joined ours without a break, and I knew her Edwardian
childhood as well as I knew my own because, in the nursery, it was unaltered.
The nursery was on the second-to-top floor of a large hushed, grey, Glasgow
house, and over it reigned my mother's nurse, Nuck, as tall and dignified as
the house itself.
She distributed love and astringent discipline, clean clothes on Sundays, hot
milk and Huntley and Palmer's tea biscuits as she had done all her life, and it
was she who stood in the doorway and turned back Time should he ever have the
temerity and stamina to climb the long stairs from the pillared marble hall to
the nursery floor.
Whatever changes took place in the rest of the house over the years, the
sanctuary of the nursery remained inviolate. It was a great relief to us,
arriving in the holidays, not only to find the carriage clock on the corner
shelf hiding its elegance in a worn leather case, but to know it had always
been so.
We liked having the same tall fireguard, with the extra brass rail for airing
baby clothes, and we liked the shelves full of time-honoured books, accepting
the ones we liked and the ones we loathed as we accepted people, through
propinquity.
We liked knowing that the oval table, with the green bobble-edged cloth, was
the same table and cloth which had sheltered our mother when, overcome with
pity for the fate of a new little brown loaf, she had taken it and hidden under
the table to save it from being eaten.
With or without a brown loaf, we hid under the table and peered at passing feet
from under the serrated canopy.
The frames of the tall, double-glazed windows were painted in a peculiar
terracotta enamel of excellent quality which had withstood two generations of
children without a chip. (The strange colour puzzled me for years but recently
I read that there was an Etruscan vogue about the turn of the century, and I
can only think our grandmother fell victim to it.)
Both generations of children looked from the same tall windows over the same
wet dark street, with the fascinating oblongs of light from the windows
opposite, and the same sing-song sound of the trams passing at the end of the
road on their way to Charing Cross. And if one group of children saw carriages
and cabs pass by, and another cars, that was a mere detail, because the real
world lay inside the nursery, and not outside in the rain.
The double-glazing of the day and night nursery windows was a tribute to our
progressive grandfather who had this done as far back as 1901, the year that
Glasgow trams abandoned horses and became electric.
He also installed bathrooms on all three upper floors of the house, and had one
put in the basement, too, for the maids. He took no notice at all of his
friends at the Club who said, ``For heaven's sake, man, what did maids want
with a bath?''
He must also have been a pioneer with electricity, for the light switches -
domes of sectioned brass like little peeled oranges - must have been among the
earliest light fittings of all.
This brass, which fashioned not only the light fittings but undulating
three-legged bedside lamps with frilly japsilk shades, and a fascinating
up-and-down pendulum above the brisk white china shade in the nursery, was an
excellent shock conductor.
Several of the lamps could not be turned on without a curious furry sensation
up one's arm and in the nursery pantry one could, by turning on the light with
one hand and the tap with the other, experience quite a sharp electric shock.
One of my brothers overdid this and wept, but Nuck did not sympathise. She
simply told him it was a daft game to play and to get on and eat his tea like a
Christian.
She made tea in the nursery pantry (all our other meals were carried, on vast
japanned trays, up those interminable stairs from the basement kitchen by a
little kitchen maid in a print dress and an engulfing cap and apron) and boiled
the kettle on a gas ring, and cut banana sandwiches, and poured into a tall jug
the town milk which always tasted to us slightly odd.
If people came to tea with us treats were added to the normal tea - cookies
from Skinner's, glossy like newly-peeled conkers, and little square cakes iced
in a particular soft icing, pink or white or pale yellow.
We were excited one day to be told that our admired and adulated older cousins
were coming to tea and would, moreover, have tea with us in the nursery. We
were fully conscious of the honour, though I now realise there must have been a
strong adult lobby against allowing us to seep downstairs, since I was four at
the time and my brothers younger.
To mark the splendid occasion I was to be allowed to wear my white buckskin
shoes.
They were exquisite shoes, like a pair of white mice, but they were seldom worn
because they were party shoes and I was rapidly growing out of them.
I thought about wearing my white shoes at the tea party during all my waking
moments, all the following days.
When the day at last dawned it didn't dawn at all. The whole world was obscured
by a dense black Glasgow fog.
Glasgow fogs differed from present fogs or Los Angeles fogs or London
pea-soupers of post-war fiction in that they were black, black like coal, black
like the darkest night except that no light could penetrate them.
It invaded the house, creeping in round closed windows, hazing the light bulbs
and covering everything with a pall of grime.
Unwary children, scampering across the bedroom in bare feet, were rewarded with
dark grey soles, and a book left open in the morning had gritty pages by night.
However, the messenger boy from Skinner's bicycled through the blackened street
with the cookies and cakes for our tea, and Nuck said, ``Well, well, all's
well.''
But it was not.
My throat had begun to ache, and all too soon I couldn't swallow and could
hardly speak. I tried to cry but it was too painful, so I was shut inside
myself, my misery and me. Nuck said: ``Poor wee thing. You've got the fog in
your throat. It's no good giving you a jujube because you wouldn't be able to
swallow it. Never mind. You'll be better tomorrow.''
The afternoon was several years long, and my efforts not to cry were as
agonising as the desire to cry itself. I still could not believe that this had
happened to me and was sure that by tea-time, when they came and I had my white
shoes on, I would be better.
When it was time for us to be washed and changed for tea, grown-up voices
agreed it would be silly for me to put on my white silk party dress considering
my sore throat, but I was told consolingly: ``Never mind, you can wear your
white shoes.''
Squeezing them over my stout fawn wool socks only matched the general
distortion of the day, and I was not surprised when no healing magic from my
shoes crept up my legs after all. At tea I sat between the huge cousins, and
they were joking and kind. ``Are you not eating your cookie? Shall I cut it
into wee bits for you?'' ``Here, have a pink cake to match your hair ribbon.''
I tried to say I couldn't eat, but no voice at all emerged from my swollen
throat. ``She's got fog in her throat,'' voices explained over my head.
``She'll be all right tomorrow.''
What good was tomorrow? Tomorrow Marjorie and Dick and John would not be here
and I wouldn't be wearing my white shoes and the treat would have passed me by.
Outside the window was the dense and muffling blackness of the fog, only
stirred by the faint fog-horns of the ships on the distant Clyde.
Inside, in the bright cosy room, with the foggy haze around the light like the
corona round the moon, everyone laughed and talked unmindful of me.
I sat, my chin not far above the edge of the white tablecloth, unable to eat or
speak, enveloped in sorrow and my hugely aching throat, and my white shoes were
no consolation at all.

q.In a recent newspaper article several leading financial advisers were quoted
as saying that due to Equitable Life's secretive stance in not revealing
information on its cash reserves they could not recommend the company. It also
quoted Money Management magazine as reporting that Equitable Life had a low
free-asset ratio.
The company countered this criticism by arguing that it didn't publish its
reserves to avoid misleading comparisons and by suggesting that independent
advisers might be sour over its policy not to pay commission on selling
pensions.
I have in the past made regular single premium payments to my Equitable pension
policy and had intended to do so in the future. However, in the light of the
criticism made by the advisers I wonder if there is significant cause for
concern.
n.Financial advisers are clearly not going to recommend a non-commission paying
life office and there is no reason under the ``best advice'' rules why they
should because they have not out-performed commission-paying offices, though
Equitable Life is frequently in the top 10.
As you indicate, Equitable does not agree with the financial strength tables
published by Money Management and other magazines because there is a no
standardised way of compiling them. Within the official parameters, a company
can calculate its free-asset ratio, which - because it measures the ratio of
surplus assets to liabilities - is considered a key measure, in a variety of
ways, some more flattering than others.
Instead, Equitable points to outside opinion on its financial strength, notably
its ``AA excellent'' rating awarded by Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency,
which is only just below the highest AAA category, and the recommendation by
the Government Actuary that it may be used to run pension plans for local
authorities and other public sector bodies. Equitable also has a strong track
record on its payouts on with-profits policies.
All insurance companies are closely monitored by the Department of Trade and
Industry, and the chance of even a small company going bust is remote. However,
a relatively poor financial position could act as a constraint on its
investment performance and, therefore, the returns a with-profits policyholder
would obtain.
q.I am 48 years of age and would like to retire at 55. My husband and I are
members of our relevant company pension schemes. We have a mixed bag of shares
and our mortgage is paid off.
In the light of the enclosed estimate from my employer, should I purchase added
years or is this not financially viable? We have followed your advice over the
years in the purchase of both unit and investment trusts. I have enclosed
details of our portfolio and would be grateful if you could advise us on
whether any changes are recommended.
n.Assuming your scheme provides a pension of one-sixtieth of final salary for
each year of service, paying the maximum contribution for added years would be
worth an extra 10% of salary on your pension if you continued working until 60.
However, retiring at 55 would greatly reduce the pension purchased and it is
probably not worth doing because you would get a better return by saving the
extra contributions you would have made. As for your portfolio, it seems quite
well-balanced and no obvious changes are called for.
q.I am almost 50 and planning for retirement. I've been making AVCs (#80 per
month) for five years into a pension plan with Albany Life. At this rate it has
been calculated I should be able to retire within the next 10 years on half my
present #25,000 salary. By that time my mortgage will have been paid off.
However, I should like to ensure I'm comfortable in retirement by investing
more now. My thought was to increase my pension contributions but I've been
told there is a risk of ``overfunding''. Could you explain? If this is not a
tax-efficient way to build a nest egg how could it best be done?
n.The maximum that those in a company pension scheme are allowed to contribute
to their main scheme and AVCs is 15% of earnings. The employer's contributions
are on top of this. You are presently contributing 3.8% so unless your payments
into the main scheme are exceptionally high it would appear you have quite a
lot of leeway. Typically, the employee's contribution is 6% to 7% of gross
earnings.
Overfunding results when the AVC, combined with the main company scheme, would
provide benefits which exceed the maximum allowable two-thirds of final salary.
The overfunded portion is returned after a tax charge of 35% for standard rate
taxpayers. This is to offset the initial tax relief on premiums. People who
have been with one employer for many years may already qualify for nearly the
maximum pension. If this is the case overfunding is a real risk. However, this
does not appear to be so in your case.
q.I am 58 years old, work as a professional and have various investments but
not a PEP. We are in the process of buying a flat for our son. It will be in
his name but we are taking out a mortgage for about #50,000. This will also be
in his name, but as he has no income the repayments will be made by us and the
possible rent from other students who will take a room. I will act as guarantor.
The building society, Bradford &amp; Bingley, is looking for security for the loan
and will accept a PEP in my name. Our financial adviser has suggested three
companies, Ivory &amp; Sime, M&amp;G Compound Growth PEP and HSBC Flexipep. He is
leaning towards Ivory &amp; Sime and I would appreciate your advice.
n.All these fund managers are respected names in the industry and it is really
impossible to predict which might give the best performance over the timescale
of a mortgage. However, expenses have an important bearing on performance over
the long term, so it is probably advisable to go for the one with the lowest.
But have you thought of simply having a repayment mortgage, possibly with
enhanced repayments so it is repaid in less than the usual 20 to 25 years?
q.Can you tell me how inheritance tax is levied on husband and wife? Is it now
like income tax where independent taxation applies, or is it assessed on the
joint estate?
n.Inheritance tax (IHT) is levied separately on husband and wife so each can
have an estate of up to #154,000 without any IHT worries. In addition, anything
passing from one spouse to the other by lifetime gift or on death is exempt.
But if one spouse leaves his or her estate to the other there will be IHT
payable on the second death if the joint estate is more than #154,000.
Passing the estate, or at least enough to use the #154,000 allowance, direct to
the next generation is a sensible tax move but care must be taken to ensure
this does not leave the surviving spouse with insufficient income or capital to
live comfortably.
With effect from April 6, the exempt amount will be increased to #200,000 for
each spouse.
q.I bought a new house six months ago but have recently had to resell it due to
difficulty in selling my present home in the depressed market. I had to take
out a bridging loan but have had a claim for tax relief on this refused. The
tax office says that in my circumstances the interest paid on the loan is not
allowable. Am I not right in saying bridging loan interest is allowable in
addition to relief for mortgage payments?
n.Tax relief is usually available for interest paid on bridging finance up to
#30,000 in addition to any relief given for existing mortgage interest on the
old house. Relief for bridging loan interest is available for up to a year to
enable the existing house to be sold, and this time limit can be extended by
the Inland Revenue if it considers it reasonable to do so.
However, the relief is only available provided that within the 12 month or
extended period the new house is occupied as your main residence. It is likely
that if you never sold your old home you did not take up residence in the new
one and it, therefore, never became your main residence. If this is the case,
the Revenue's decision is correct.

FAN INDEPENDENT Scotland should set up an Association of States of the British
Isles, Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said yesterday.
The association would identify areas of common concern and interest with
England, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic, the Isle of Man and the
Channel Islands.
It would be based loosely on the Nordic Council and other similar groupings of
nations in Europe and would allow joint action, where appropriate, on issues
before the European Union and other international bodies, Mr Salmond said.
He was speaking to reporters after visiting the Council of Ministers in
Brussels, where he claimed Scotland was excluded from full participation
because of British interests.
He complained that at a recent fisheries council Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth, who enjoys full Cabinet rank, had sat silently during the meeting
while the talking was done by a junior representing English interests.
``This is what it has come to,'' he said. ``There was a time a few years ago
when the very thought would have been laughed at.''
Later, Mr Salmond met the EU's social affairs commissioner, Padraig Flynn, for
talks on the Social Chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Salmond said that under the Labour-Liberal Democrat proposals for a Scottish
parliament the Scots still would be unable to sign up for the chapter because
Westminster retained a veto. The same would apply under Mr Forsyth's proposals
for the Scottish Grand Committee.
``Only the parliament of an independent Scotland can take that decision and
thus fulfill the clear wish of the Scottish people, who are good Europeans but
are treated as an offshore outpost of Europe under the present arrangement,''
he said.
His proposals for an association of states is an updated version of a policy
which the SNP advanced in the 1970s. It was designed to show that an
independent Scotland would not be cast adrift politically and economically.

<TEXT>
ONE of Britain's largest and best-known charities yesterday announced swingeing
#9m cuts in children's projects.
Save the Children, whose president is the Princess Royal, blamed a ``difficult
operating environment'' for the dramatic cutbacks - which amount to 10% of the
total budget.
The National Lottery had been a ``significant pressure'', a charity spokesman
added.
The move will lead to job losses and project closures, including programmes in
the UK such as family centres and schemes for young people leaving care.
It is the second funding crisis for the charity, which has 80 UK projects and
programmes for children in more than 50 countries. Last year it announced it
was slashing #30m from its budget over four years.

Animal rights protesters have appealed to Tesco to help save seals from being

The International Fund for Animal Welfare took out full-page advertisements in
national newspapers calling on chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin to ban Canadian
tinned salmon from his stores. He said yesterday: ``If our customers feel
strongly about it, which some clearly do, then it is up to them whether they
want to take action and stop buying Canadian fish.''

Andi Robertson
bemoans the parlous
state of ski finance
EVEN for a nation which spawns legions of wannabe McCoists, Hastings and
McColgans, there should be a path to let the rarer youngsters who dream of
becoming the next Tomba or Zurbriggen reach their potential.
So contends the British Ski Federation who are charged with the task of
overseeing the perilous route from first slalom gates raced, through to
Olympic, World Cup or World Championship selection.
Since moving north under the aegis of a new regime five years ago, competitive
skiing's British governing body - based in a converted registrar's office in
East Calder, West Lothian - seem to have laid these foundations.
With a new set-up of international coaching in place which actually achieved
continuity over three or four years, British ski racing had a financial
timebomb planted in its midst around a year ago with the news that the Sports
Council was planning massive cuts to its contribution to the BSF's budget. In
fact the projection promised a cut from #305,000 to just #120,000 over the
period between the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics and the season of the 1998 games
in Nagano.
It may well be a return to this painful, pedantic refrain - ``money please for
Britain's hard-up, hard-done-by ski racers'',-but the current demoralising
effect is a shock wave which soon reaches the retail operators, many of whom
invest in supporting young talent, financing coaching, and running and funding
race leagues or championships.
Each will concede that there is little direct return from sponsorship (least of
all in the sale of race equipment which is almost universally discounted for
the young competitors), but they insist that the need for a high-profile
successful British team is an essential component of their marketing mix.
``In general we get tremendous support for our athletes from the retail trade,
from British manufacturers and distributors - and the unfortunate fact is that
we are becoming more reliant on them,'' reflects British Ski Federation Chief
Executive Mike Jardine.
Rob Farrell of retailers Nevisport, who are an equipment supplier to the
British team and for two years have supported one of the KPMG Scottish Ski
Team's brightest hopes, Derek McMillan, with equipment echoes the BSF viewpoint.
``Take youngsters such as Derek - it's now a massive commitment for parents to
fund a ski racing career. For many that drive is only going to be killed if
there's no prospect of external funding ever really taking over and subsidising
their costs when they reach national team level,'' Farrell says.
While they continue to fight the Sports Council's plans there are signs of a
substantial restructuring of UK coaching and the Home Nations and British
teams, as concessions, according to Jardine, ``to the seemingly ever-changing
justifications of the council for their cuts''.
The BSF has been thrown a lifeline from the industry in the form of a
management contract to run the Snowsports &amp; Outdoor Leisure Trade Exhibition -
skiing and snowboarding's biggest annual trade show, to be held in March at
Manchester's G-Mex.
The federation has already had to lay off administrative staff. The revenue
generated will allow it to maintain its current level of international coaching
staff and continue a programme that sees more British team skiers Europa Cup
qualified than before and more British skiers racing abroad than before and,
after the postponement of last year's Alpine World Championships, the daunting
prospect of two World Championships in consecutive years followed by the 1998
Olympics.
But without funding to send full teams to each then there is little light at
the end of the tunnel for British ski racing.

<HEADLINE>Bid to have daughter sterilised</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE McKAIN, Law Correspondent</BYLINE>

A MOTHER is asking a judge to allow her 32-year-old daughter, who is severely
mentally handicapped, to be sterilised.
However, a curator appointed to look after the interests of the daughter is
opposing the application.
Lord MacLean was told at the Court of Session that the daughter attends an
adult training centre from Monday to Friday and lives at home in Edinburgh at
weekends.
The mother maintains her daughter is vulnerable to sexual advances, that her
life in the community involves contact with the opposite sex and that, to an
extent, she can travel around Edinburgh on her own.
According to the mother the daughter has always been popular with the opposite
sex and might be coerced into sexual activity without being aware of the
possible consequences.
She fears that if her daughter becomes pregnant she would be unable to cope
mentally with the pregnancy or with caring for the baby.
The daughter has been on the pill from the age of 15, but the mother is arguing
that it is impracticable and medically risky for her to continue with
contraception indefinitely.
She says sterilisation is the safest way of meeting her daughter's needs.
The mother also wants Lord MacLean to appoint her a tutor to her daughter with
powers to decide, for example, with whom she is to associate, whether she
should be allowed to engage in social activities and to consent to surgical
sterilisation.
The curator accepts that the mother should be appointed as tutor to her
daughter but does not accept that the daughter should be sterilised.
She argues that sterilisation is unjustified because the woman does not at
present engage in sexual intercourse. She says her oral contraception is
well-controlled and that the alternative to that would be a serious of regular
injections or an implant to prevent a pregnancy.
Lord MacLean is expected to issue a written decision later.

Eric Thorburn is
photographer to the great and the good, and Clare Henry
reveals that he loves every minute of it
AS a boy in Govan, Eric Thorburn liked model-making. Soon his hobby extended to
suspending wooden airplanes with catgut in the back garden. ``Then I decided to
immortalise them via my dad's camera. That's how I discovered I liked
photography.''
Currently the best kent name in Scottish photography, with a list of clients as
long as your arm, from the Queen to Scottish Power, Distillers, Carstairs
Hospital, Newsweek and Hello!, he has just finished one of his most enjoyable
assignments ever: taking all 45 artist members of the 134-year-old Royal
Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.
``I just loved it. Fabulous. I only knew about five of them, people like David
Donaldson and Sandy Goudie - the rest were all new to me. It was terrific
working with artists. Ask them to lie on the floor surrounded by canvases and
they didn't blink an eye. You can't do that with royalty or managing
directors.''
Personality is all-important here. Thorburn has an engaging enthusiasm which
encourages a rapport with his sitters. Portraiture depends upon eye contact.
There are no short cuts. ``I enjoy the buzz; thrive on it.''
Thorburn took his artists in their studios - so I decide to turn the tables on
him and visit him in his studio, an old coach house at the bottom of his
garden, originally converted for his grandmother. Here in the curved, coved,
ground floor studio he did all the posed shots for Scottish Ballet and many of
his magazine and newspaper fashion pages. ``The dancers came on the train with
their costumes and we took the pictures here under powerful lights. Models
posed with the wind machine! But I got totally, utterly bored with posed
fashion photography. Nowadays I'm more often out and about on location.''
He almost missed his treasured RGI project. The phone call came out of the blue
and Thorburn turned the commission down. Luckily his wife Liz came to the
rescue, and immediately persuaded him to change his mind, ``A good thing too.
It's been such a lot of fun!''
They went to Arran to capture Jack Knox in his converted garage studio
overlooking the beach or riding his bike, to Hampshire to see William Crosbie
at home, to Elie to take Geoff Squires leaning on his splendid balcony, to
Clydebank for Tom McKendrick and to Lincolnshire to photograph Barbara Balmer.
They visited Dundee and Arbroath for Alberto Morrocco and Bill Littlejohn and
drove all over Britain at speed to pin down reclusive artists in their gardens
or gregarious folk in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
One especially memorable trip was to Bellochantuy in Argyll where Bill Wright
creates his beautiful grainy waterscapes on the beach. ``I love the look of him
- his beard, his sailor's cap. However I wasn't getting it right. Then I saw
these huge 12ft rocks, like giant pebbles, and got him walking between them.
It's my favourite black and white shot.''
The original plan, brilliantly conceived by Barclay Lennie, RGI treasurer and
gallery owner, was for all black and white portraits. ``People seem to think
they are more `artistic' than colour,'' says Thorburn. ``I don't agree. I feel
it's an insult to photograph colourful painters in monochrome. So we
compromised: four colour shots plus one black and white each. The exception is
Mary Armour. She said she wanted all colour, so I made an exception. After all
she's the honorary president; she's the boss.''
When he left school Thorburn was apprenticed to photographer Stephen Orr. ``I
was thrown in at the deep end: society weddings, clan chiefs etc. I also met
Olivier and Chagall. We did pictures for the personality page of the Glasgow
Bulletin.''
Then he started up on his own. ``I was dead lucky again. I found premises at
385 Sauchiehall Street - but there was a big difference between assisting Orr
and doing it on your own. But a business gets its own momentum. We don't
advertise, we don't have brochures or portfolios.''
With Thorburn's client list you don't need to. Thirty years on he's still
snapping the great and good: 18 years with Scottish Opera taking every single
production, seven years with Scottish Power covering Torness, Hunterston,
Inverkip and more, Pitlochry Theatre, Scottish Field (more than 200 front
covers), Highland and Islands Development Board (``a dream of a brief for 15
years - to cover Caithness, Sutherland, Orkney and Shetland as, when, and how I
wanted to. But then they sold their library of my pictures. It's a sore
point.'')
The list goes on with Scottish Ballet, all 60 of United Distillers properties
from Wick to Edinburgh, Scottish Tourist Board, Glaxo, the Royal Scottish
Academy of Music and Drama - plus many royals.
Thorburn did the official portrait of the Queen in Holyrood's Throne Room with
the crown jewels for Edinburgh Castle; also the official portrait of the Queen
Mother at Clarence House for the RSAMD. ``I've taken all the Royals several
times, including Diana, but the Queen Mother is a favourite. She's a wonderful
lady.'' Thorburn once took all the Scottish dukes in their castles too.
Celebrities include Michael Caine, Sean Connery (used three times life size in
Moscow); Leonard Bernstein (``great profile''); Benno Schotz (the last pictures
taken just before his death, looking very smart in a bow tie), Alex Gibson,
Jackie Stewart and Rudolf Nureyev. Thorburn's shot of Pavarotti drinking from a
huge quaich of whisky at the banquet following his Glasgow concert, has been
used around the world.
The Nureyev pictures involved a memorable trip with editor Roddy Martine. ``I
flew direct to Paris from Jura where I'd been fishing with Lord Astor. It was
first class and champagne all the way. Nureyev was in a great mood and even
agreed to pose outside despite the rain.''
Thorburn rarely exhibits his work. ``It's not worth it. I might do five or six
prints to get a perfect image but the difference is so slight, the average
person doesn't notice. Most of my work is for reproduction. It drives me crazy
when they alter the essential composition by trimming - but that's life.''
At least he has control of his RGI artists exhibition and has made the most of
dramatic, often memorable compositions: a nude Sandy Goudie raining poppies,
(``he put as much into these shots as I did''); Crosbie in dense shadow, Eli
Lamb and her litho stones, MacInnes and Low with haloes. Many shots play on the
double mirror reflection. ``I've learned an enormous amount from these
artists.''
Thorburn's studio walls are a mini-Thorburn picture gallery: oyster catchers
against the Speyside sun (his daughter's favourite), Parkhead squalor, Hill
House splendour, Pavarotti, his children, the Queen. Current projects include
photos for David Donaldson's book and Mackintosh architecture for the 1996
exhibition catalogue.
His son Paul is already in the trade, taking shots of Mel Gibson and friends at
the Braveheart première for the new In! magazine.
I left him as he and Liz rushed off to take belly dancers in Edinburgh. ``Every
day is different for a photographer. I love it!''
n Thorburn's exhibition, PRIVATE VIEW, is on the ground floor at the MacLellan
Galleries today 10am-5pm; tomorrow 11am-5pm. Admission free.

VISCOUNT Pollington, who last year found his sister dead of a drugs overdose,
yesterday admitted possessing an imitation gun with intent to cause fear when
he appeared at the Old Bailey.
He also admitted affray in a Chelsea branch of the Winerack off-licence.
Pollington, 36, the heir to the Earl of Mexborough, was remanded on bail until
January for medical and other reports to be prepared.
Judge James Rant varied his bail conditions to allow him to leave his home in
Hasler Street, Chelsea, to spend Christmas with his family on their estate in
Yorkshire.
The facts of the case were not opened in court and Pollington was not referred
to by his title.
He was charged in the name of John Andrew Bruce Pollington by the clerk. He
answered only to confirm his name and to respond to three charges. He pleaded
guilty to possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence in July
this year. The offence happened in a Chelsea pub.
He denied stealing a packet of cigarettes from Winerack in August this year,
but admitted affray by using or threatening unlawful violence causing a
reasonable person to fear for their safety at the shop on the same date.
Pollington, an international yachtsman, discovered his sister, Lady Alethea
Savile, dead of a drugs overdose at her Chelsea home in September last year.
He later told an inquest his sister had told him on many occasions that she
intended to take her own life.
She took the overdose after her parents cut off her allowance to try to wean
her from drugs.

THE Scotch whisky industry is, quite rightly, congratulating itself on securing
a 27p reduction on a bottle in the Budget, but the Diary has found another use
for the product.
According to the Earl of Gowrie, a small application of Scotch (externally) to
the head is just the thing for treating head lice. The fascinating information
comes from Lords exchanges on the matter the other day, but not everyone was
convinced.
Lord De Freyne: ``My Lords, considering what has been said about this problem,
does my noble friend agree that whisky is bad for the head?''
Health Minister Baroness Cumberlege: ``I have heard of vinegar being used as
shampoo, but never whisky. I thought Lord Gowrie was providing a rather quirky
solution to a quirky problem.''
Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: ``My Lords, if whisky does the trick, would not
surgical spirit do it just as well, but much cheaper?''
Baroness Cumberlege: ``My Lords, I think these are a lot of lousy suggestions.''
Incidentally, who was that man in the Red Lion pub in Whitehall on Tuesday
night sinking a pint with a couple of his press officers? Yes, it was Kenneth
Clarke, who raised his glass to the assembled company, and declared: ``Cheers -
and no price rise.''
Time to be off?
STAYING in the Lords, peers are also debating plans to change us all on to
Western European Time, a variation on the theme put forward recently by Tory MP
John Butterfill in his Private Member's Bill.
All sorts of fuss the other day about the tilt of the globe and the east-west
element, which apparently means that the real time in Glasgow is 45 minutes
behind the real time in London.
Lord Howie of Troon: ``That 45 minutes is quite substantial, especially on a
Glasgow morning in January or February. I have been there often at that time
and I know that it is a dismal experience. It is not a happy time. It is cold,
miserable and dank and it is also dangerous.'' Better off in Troon, then.
Rural London
WE ARE fascinated by information from the Scottish Office about the grants
available for dry-stone walling works in Scotland - 70% for dyking works on
inbye and hill land and for the provision of dykes to exclude livestock, and
grants of up to 50% for works which improve the attractiveness of the landscape.
The only puzzling thing is why all this information came in the form of a
written reply to Joan Ruddock, Labour MP for Lewisham Deptford in the heart of
south-east London.
Wrong scent
IT'S AMAZING what a presidential visit can do. Mr Clinton's trip to Belfast has
prompted the Northern Ireland Office to go ``live'' on the Internet. You can
now get a general introductory background on Northern Ireland, notes on the
economy, industrial development, employment, tourism and so on.
Another little footnote to Mr Clinton's visit concerns the very attractive
floral display that was set up in the Royal Gallery the other day in
preparation for Mr Clinton's address to representatives from both Houses of
Parliament. The whole thing had to be removed and replaced with pot plants
because, it was discovered at the last minute, Mr Clinton has an allergy which
can be set off by flowers.
Returning fire
NICE to be popular. Dover Tory MP David Shaw, the man who pursued the Monklands
affair until he was blue in the face, is now being targeted by Labour. A group
of MPs headed by Clydesdale's Jimmy Hood have tabled a Commons motion noting Mr
Shaw's interest in other MPs' constituencies and inviting MPs to press the
Government on issues that concern the people of Dover, ``who are obviously
being neglected.''
Slow starter?
WHO was that sound asleep in the Commons Press Gallery the other day? Could it
have been Sheila Gunn, formerly of the Times, recently recruited to add spark
to Conservative Central Office's relations with the media?

LABOUR women MPs are set to hugely outnumber their Tory counterparts after the
next election, Labour said yesterday.
So far, the party has selected 102 women to fight seats, compared with the
Tories' nine.
Thirty of Labour's prospective parliamentary candidates will have been MPs in
the current Parliament, and 39 are in the most winnable seats.
The Tories have selected three would-be women MPs in seats where Tory MPs are
standing down.
Labour currently has 39 women MPs, and none intends to stand down at the next
election.
The Tories have 20 women MPs, but Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman, MP for Lancaster,
and Dame Jill Knight, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, have already announced they
are standing down.
Ms Tessa Jowell, Shadow Minister for Women, said: ``Currently just nine per
cent of MPs are women, and while Labour is poised for a substantial boost in
its representation of women in Parliament, the Tories seem to be doing their
best to keep aspiring women out.''
Tory vice-chairwoman Dame Angela Rumbold has urged her party to do more to
increase its number of women MPs, amid fears there could only be one new woman
on the Conservative benches after the next election.

Alison Kerr  visits Copenhagen, a city of many
parts, and relaxes in a cafe society which
appears to be at peace with itself
COPENHAGEN is a city of cities. As such, its character is difficult to define,
and its geography even harder to grasp. There's an old town, a new town, and
even a free state within one of them (which one, I'm not sure). It's all very
confusing - especially if you only have a couple of days there. Where most
cities normally get by on one or two main squares, Copenhagen has nine: the
walk from the Town Hall to the Royal Theatre, along the world's longest
shopping precinct - the Stroget - takes you through at least three. Similarly,
there are three artificial lakes, and various canals; and a whole host of
castles - from Rosenborg Castle (completed in 1633) through to late
eighteenth-century Amalienborg Palace (the current royal family's residence).
The first striking feature of Copenhagen particularly, and Denmark generally,
is the phenomenal number of people whose chosen mode of transport is the
bicycle. In the course of the 15-minute bus journey from Copenhagen's slick
airport to its central railway station, I counted 33 cyclists - from the
left-hand window alone. That's at least two cyclists a minute. This
predeliction for pedalling is not just a result of Denmark's admirable concern
for the environment, but also because cars are so expensive to buy and run.
After the bikes, the thing that you might notice is the distinct lack of style
of the Dane on the street. Whereas Paris is chic and London is street-wise,
Copenhagen - in terms of fashion anyway - is pedestrian precincts behind: this
is not a city that compulsive clothes buyers should target for a shopping
spree. Rather, what Copenhagen excels at are beautifully designed household
objects to be found in boutiques on the Stroget; in the department stores and
in the lower-budget, trendier shops of the studenty Latin Quarter - an area
which provides the ideal antidote to some of the tack and tat displayed on the
main commercial streets.
The emphasis on all things nice for the home is very much part of the Danish
psyche. A custom that is regularly referred to in all the guide books is the
untranslatable hygge. Less of a practice and more of an ambience, hygge sums up
the cosy, congenial atmosphere of a meal at a friend's house: good food, plenty
of drink and a meticulously and thoughtfully laid-out table. It's particularly
associated with the winter months, when social activity switches, for the most
part, from the outdoor entertainment (on the streets and in the Tivoli Gardens)
and cafe culture to indoors events like theatre, formal concerts and dinners,
which usually take the form of huge buffets (specialities include dishes with
spiced meat, pickles, and a wide range of fish).
In the early autumn the city was still buzzing by night: people promenading the
pedestrian area and indulging in the city's healthy cafe life. On the Saturday
of my visit, the Danish Royal Opera was performing Carmen in the Royal Theatre
(also home to the Royal Ballet) and an American trio was delighting the packed
Copenhagen Jazz House. Everybody walks, or pedals, in this city - reckoned to
be one of the safest in Europe - and if you're staying in the centre of town,
it's unlikely that you'd need to take a bus or a taxi to go anywhere.
The only way to see Copenhagen is by foot. And, if you follow the suggested
walking routes in the city council's handy guide Copenhagen in One Day, it's
easy to see how the Danes work up an appetite for their buffets and smorrebrod
(open sandwiches). A favourite Sunday walk of locals is along the Langelinie
(``the long line'') - a stretch of pier with two attractions worth stopping
for. One is the Gefion Fountain - a huge affair with an imposing statue of a
manly-looking goddess beating the hell out of four oxen with a whip. Garrison
Keillor, in a series of essays called We Are Not Married, says of this
impressive sight: ``Most Americans walk past this magnificent fountain and
hardly see it because they are intent on finding the famous mermaid statue
which they know from their map to be nearby, and which they imagine to be as
big as the Statue of Liberty, but which turns out to be a small, sad, damp
person in the midst of a personality crisis.''
True, size-wise she is a bit disappointing, but the Little Mermaid (from Hans
Christian Andersen's fairy tale) is a lovely sight all the same, and one which
has become symbolic of the city: miniature versions sell in all the tourist
shops. Andersen (1805-1875) was, of course, one of Copenhagen's most famous
sons. His statue sits just beyond the Town Hall Square, on Hans Christian
Andersen Boulevard, and the city's tourist office has been named after the
title of one of the songs from the Hollywood musical of his life - Wonderful
Copenhagen.
Copenhagen is an architectural treasure trove. Only three skyscrapers (one of
them being my hotel, the Radisson SAS Royal Hotel) impinge on its skyline -
which has little changed over the past century. The proliferation of
Renaissance-style buildings (like the Stock Exchange) was the work of Dutch
architects brought to Denmark by King Christian IV. Paris was the inspiration
for the King's New Square, and presumably the Royal Theatre which bears a
considerable resemblance to the French capital's opera house. Houses are
painted in warm colours - ochre, yellow, gold, terracotta. Of the many
different styles of church spires in Copenhagen, the most awesome is the green
copper spire of Our Saviour's Church - Scandinavia's oldest baroque church. The
gorgeous mint green of the spire contrasts beautifully with the golden
staircase which is wrapped around it, and which leads to the golden globe
perched on the very top.
Our Saviour's Church is just around the corner from an area that's not referred
to in any of the tourist books. In fact, it's not even acknowledged on any of
the maps of Copenhagen. Christiania is a ``free state'' within Denmark. In the
1960s, hippies in their masses moved into a disused military base and set up
home there. Despite various attempts by the city to reclaim the property, the
squat has grown over the years, and is now tolerated by the government.
Christiania has its own venue (holds 2000) for rock concerts (The Levellers
were soon to appear there), its own restaurants, and its own authorities, to
whom anyone wishing to join the existing 2000 residents has to apply.
Understandably, Christiania is a mecca for New a
n British Midland operates daily flights from both Glasgow and Edinburgh.

<HEADLINE>6000 jobless to go on `workfare' scheme</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975093965</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WORKFARE-style ``Project Work'' scheme for up to 6000 long-term unemployed
people was launched by the Government yesterday. Under it, people between 18
and 50 who have been jobless for more than two years will have to attend a work
experience programme or lose benefit.
Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard announced that Ministers
have decided to press ahead with the scheme following a trial project in
Norfolk.
Mrs Shephard said the Government would now be setting up two pilot schemes in
April to deal with ``the recalcitrant few'' who did not want to go back to work.
After Mrs Shephard's announcement at the Tory women's conference in London, the
Prime Minister said: ``The majority genuinely seeking work will find this a
lifeline. But those who refuse to take the offer of work experience will lose
some or all of their benefit.''
Mrs Shephard said the scheme would require ``some activity, some effort'' from
the unemployed group affected. ``It's called paying for what you get - making
some effort in return for help given.''
Placement would last up to six months, comprising three months of training and
three months' work experience. The type of work offered could include painting
and decorating, construction and gardening.
People who refused or dropped out would lose two weeks benefit at first. The
second time it happened the person could lose a month's benefit and a third
drop out could lead to total loss of benefit. Hardship cases, where dependent
children were involved, probably would retain about 60% of benefit.
Mr Major said the Government would look with interest to see if Labour
supported the project. Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown recently produced a
similar idea for cutting the benefit of young people who were unwilling to join
any of four types of education or training projects.
Shadow Education and Employment Secretary David Blunkett said the Government
scheme offered no real opportunity or choice, and the cost of the scheme, at
between #10m, contrasted with Labour's billion-pound package to tackle
long-term youth unemploymen funded through the windfall tax.
Liberal Democrat spokesman Don Foster said it was ``a small step in the right
direction''. It would be far better to use benefit payments as a way of giving
in-work training with the chance of a real job at the end.

Kelly Holland, from Hamilton and Arlene Elliot, from Partick, both 17, were
found hanged in their cells in Cornton Vale in June.
Mr Low reviewed the Cornton Vale regime following the deaths but told the
inquiry he was satisfied the system was reasonable.
But he admitted that nursing staff who screened prisoners for warning signs of
suicide were sometimes under so much pressure they did not have time to read
the girls' medical notes.
He said: ``The regime is satisfactory in terms of what we can provide, but
given enough money I'd like if possible to provide a more therapeutic regime.
He said counselling and enabling staff to spend more time with prisoners would
make the inmates think better of themselves, and less likely to contemplate
suicide.
It would be more effective than providing special anti-hanging cells.
So-called Aberdeen cells, designed to be ligature-proof so there was nowhere
for prisoners to attach a noose, would cost up to #50,000 each at Cornton Vale,
he claimed.
Mr Low said the jail was currently looking at various options for change, but
would not reach a decision until after the outcome of the fatal accident
inquiry.
Asked whether it was possible to eliminate all risk of suicide in prisons, Mr
Low replied: ``I'd like to, but I don't know if that's physically possible.''
Earlier, a senior prison officer described how he had spent 45 minutes talking
to Arlene Elliot the night before she died.
Residental supervisor Derek MacLeod said the officers had been extra vigilant
after Kelly's death three days earlier, and he decided to talk to a number of
girls.
He said he had no concerns at all about Arlene, and if he had, he could have
put her on strict suicide supervision.
Mr MacLeod said he was the first to arrive in Arlene's cell on the evening she
died, after hearing another prisoner screaming for help.
He told the inquiry at Stirling Sheriff Court that while other officers
administered heart massage and the kiss of life, he tried three times ito
contact a nurse.
Arlene's mother, Roseanne McKay sat with her head in her hands on the public
benches as Mr MacLeod gave his evidence.
The inquiry will continue on January 8.

THE athletics jury which has already condemned 30-year-old Lynne McIntyre as
one of sport's under-achievers may yet have to reconsider.
Twelve years after she was the youngest Olympic 1500 metres finalist, at 19,
the City of Glasgow woman hopes to return and win selection for Atlanta in the
same event. Why not? She has overturned a catalogue of disasters, any one of
which would have buried a person of lesser moral fibre.
In 1984, McIntyre was eleventh in Los Angeles. A week later she set a British
junior 800m record (2min. 01.11sec.) which still stands. Were it not for South
African Zola Budd's passport of convenience, she would also hold the 1500m mark.
Charting the rise and demise of the former Lynne McDougall is simple, but
behind the statistics - as many Scottish senior outdoor titles as Commonwealth
champions Liz McColgan and Yvonne Murray combined - and the belief that she can
run faster after a 12-year absence, lies a saga of triumph against emotional
and physical adversity.
The death of her coach, and then her father; painful injury; surgery; and then
divorce - all while earning an honours degree and a distinction in a
post-graduate Masters - conspired against her.
Budd and McIntyre, the two youngest in that 1984 team, exchanged little
conversation, with Budd a cloistered pawn in a newspaper circulation war.
However, McIntyre, dismissing two Commonwealth final appearances as incidental,
hopes to have the last word.
Just months after her seventeenth birthday, belying her frail physique, she won
the 1982 Scottish senior 1500m title, setting a senior native record. It
survived a week, broken by future Commonwealth 10,000m champion Murray, one
year her senior.
Two years later McIntyre won the national senior cross-country title with
Murray second. And when McIntyre won the 1986 Scottish 1500m title, the older
McColgan - later that year to become Commonwealth 10k senior champion - was
runner-up. In 1989 she set a Scottish championship 1500m record which still
stands, and the future European and world finalist, Alison Wyeth, was runner-up
when McIntyre won the UK 1500m title.
But perhaps none of this should have surprised. In the winter of '76, she had
given a clue by running future Olympic 400m finalist Linsey Macdonald a close
second in the Scottish under-13 cross-country championships.
A few months ago, despite having kept in modest shape - enough to pick up what,
by her own standards, were soft Scottish track and cross-country titles in the
interim - McIntyre was contemplating final retirement.
Instead, after her flickering enthusiasm had been kept alight by Gerry Barnes
and Bill Parker, she returned to John Anderson, the man who had stepped in to
steer her to Olympic success following the death of much-loved Glasgow coach,
Ronnie Kane.
Anderson, a far better mentor than histrionic Gladiator referee performances
might suggest, refused to help her unless she was serious. ``I told him I was
back because I felt I'd never fulfilled my potential,'' she said.
``If I could achieve that at 19, physiologically immature, I know I can run
faster now. I got a poor degree at Strathclyde (she dismisses a second-class
honours in psychology) and don't want to look back on my athletics in the same
way. Perhaps I can do as well in athletics, second time around, as did in my
Masters.''
It was perhaps no coincidence that she sought out Anderson within days of her
former husband remarrying. ``It took me three years to sort out my life after
our marriage broke up,'' she said. ``I felt ineffectual - as if I could not
control my life. It was hard working out where I went from there. But women, I
think, do better than men in that situation, because they confront themselves.
We internalise it, while men just carry on.''
Listening, one understands why, at 21, she counselled drug addicts and
alcoholics full time, and why, now, she co-ordinates the Glasgow Healthy City
project which attempts to address the problem of urban regeneration by
combating unemployement, poverty, and deprivation. She realises winning Olympic
gold might be easier than changing government attitudes.
The elfin face is remarkably unchanged since 1984, I observe. ``Surprising,
considering I enjoy a Glenmorangie - with a dash of water - and a good dry
white wine,'' she said with a laugh. Then, heresy: ``There's more to life than
athletics.''
Perhaps that truth reveals why she might just succeed in turning back the clock.
Unlike most top athletes, she puts something back. Responding to an initiative
by fellow 800m internationalist Carol Sharp, McIntyre will help present a
Puma-backed conference next weekend at Jordanhill College, Glasgow, which will
attempt to reverse the pattern which sees Murray as the only Scot, Sharp and
McIntyre apart, to have broken 2-03 for two laps in more than a decade. Perhaps
en route to Atlanta, Lynne will retrace her footsteps and show the way.

BANK of Scotland yesterday revealed it was confident of offloading 49% of the
Bank of Western Australia, hours after announcing completion of the #439m
purchase of its entire share capital.
When Bank of Scotland first announced the acquisition on September 20, industry
analysts believed it might ultimately be left with more than 51% of the
Australian bank.
This concern was a consequence of the public offer price implied by Bank of
Scotland's proviso that it would float 49% subject to it realising a minimum
price of #202m.
This was considered to be on the expensive side.
However, Bank of Scotland general manager Robin Browning said yesterday that
the flotation looked likely to succeed.

SHARES in printed circuit board manufacturer Prestwick Holdings, having already
been slashed from the 50p-plus level they reached in September, yesterday
tumbled another 4p to 35p.
The latest 10% plunge in the Ayr-based company's market capitalisation followed
comments by outgoing executive chairman Archie Coulson at the company's annual
meeting.
Mr Coulson said first-half results were not likely to meet the company's
original expectations. He blamed delays in the installation of new equipment,
part of a major expansion drive by Prestwick, as well as associated staff
dislocation and recruitment and training costs.

BARINGS was described in 1818 by French statesman Duc de Richelieu as the sixth
great power in Europe, alongside England, France, Russia, Austria and Prussia.
q The first Baring, Johann, arrived in Britain in 1717 from Bremen in northern
Germany.
q Two of his sons, John and Francis, started the bank in London in 1762.
q Baring credit re-opened trade with the United States after the American War
of Independence and helped finance Britain's wars against Napoleon.
q The Barings invested heavily in land to hedge against disaster should the
bank fail. When Francis died in 1810 he had just #68,000 in the bank but
#400,000 in land holdings.
q The so-called Baring Crisis of 1890 rocked the City. It was sparked by a
default on Argentinian loans worth about #250 million in today's terms.
q Edward Baring, Lord Revelstoke - who had a gambling instinct - had to sell
houses, paintings and furniture to pay off his debts and his wife was said to
have died of shame.
q But the bank survived as the dynastic family rallied around.
q In 1969, control was passed to a charity which held the share capital.

NICK LEESON's deal with the Singapore authorities may not mean that others
involved in the Barings scandal will walk away scot-free, but the fact he was
not cross-examined in court meant that he would not be publicly naming names.
What happened next depended on whether the Singapore authorities, as Finance
Minister Richard Hu indicated in October they intended to, pursue charges
against those Barings executives alleged to have taken part in a cover up.
Leeson's immediate staff in Singapore are unlikely to interest the Singapore
authorities. They are more interested in the man he reported to in London, Mr
Peter Norris, and the two regional bosses, Mr James Bax and Mr Simon Jones.
Singapore's official report into the Barings debacle, published in October,
said other Barings officials had concealed Leeson's unauthorised trades and
that there was ``a strong inference that key individuals of the Barings group
management were grossly negligent, or wilfully blind and reckless with the
truth''.
After the collapse in February, Barings was bought by the Dutch financial
conglomerate, ING, and, while most of the 2000 Barings staff in London were
kept on, 21 of the senior staff were either sacked or resigned. The ING
decision was clearly taken on the basis of what it found when it took over. The
Singapore report found the fall of Barings Futures to have been caused by
``institutional incompetence, a lack of understanding of the future business
among senior executives, and a total failure of internal controls''. Some of
those who left voluntarily, or were dismissed, must have borne some
responsibilty for that situation.
The two names which crop up repeatedly are those of 40-year-old Mr Norris, who
was head of the investment banking arm, and now lives in Hertfordshire, and
42-year-old Mr James Bax, who was south east Asia regional manager, and still
lives in Singapore. The auditors, Price Waterhouse, in their report to the
Singapore authorities, alleged the two men had ignored warning signs, provided
Leeson with more and more money for his losing bets, and later tried to cover
up his losses.
They were said to have played down a #50m discrepancy in Leeson's books,
discovered by the auditors in January, which would have served as a warning
that things were going wrong. There were other warning signs about that time
which were also ignored, including two from Simex, the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange.
The Bank of England, whose Board of Banking Supervision published its report on
the affair in July, is examining whether it was misled by Mr Norris in the
account he furnished of the events leading to the collapse. There are
discrepancies between what he told the Bank, and what is contained in the
Singapore inspectors' report, and he has discussed them with the Bank's
investigators, Mr Brian Quinn, head of banking supervision, and Mr Ian West,
head of special investigations.
Although criticised by the Board of Banking Supervision report published for
failing to prevent the collapse, it is only in the Singapore report Mr Norris
is accused of participating in a cover up. Mr Bax has not been interviewed by
the Bank officials. He has, however, been interviewed by the CAD, as has Mr
Simon Jones, operations manager for the region when Leeson was dealing. The
Singapore report also named Mr Anthony Hawes, the group treasurer, as having
been involved in the concealment.
Mr Norris has dismissed the Singapore conclusions as having no basis in fact,
and, to be fair, the report's conclusion that there was a cover up appears
based on conflicting testimony from former Barings executives, rather than
conclusive proof. The man who might be able to furnish that proof is Mr Leeson.
Since he is not now going to undergo cross examination in public about his
crimes, if no further action is taken by the Singpore authorities, that may be
the last to be heard. While what has happened is clearly in Mr Leeson's
interests, from the point of view of the British investors, who trusted
Barings, as well the matter of public trust in the Bank of England's ability to
supervise the activities of such banks, it is bad news.
Other Barings executives criticised by the Board of Banking Supervision for
their part in the affair include Mr Ron Baker, head of the financial products
group, was found to have no real understanding of the nature of Baring Futures
Singapore and to have failed to familiarise himself with what Mr Leeson was
doing, and the former Bank supervisor, Mr Chris Thompson. Although the
chairman, Mr Peter Baring, and the deputy chairman, Mr Andrew Tickey, emerged
relatively unscathed, they, too, had to take responsibilty for the fact that
senior management was so ill-informed.
Mr Leeson's lawyers have all along claimed he was being made a scapegoat for
``a wide circle of people''. This magic circle may well, because of the deal,
simply vanish. It is no longer operating, its members are no longer working for
Barings, and the supervisory authorities have learned the lessons of the
Barings affair.
Mr Bax and Mr Jones have so far not commented on either report, but in a letter
to the Singapore Times in March, claimed that Mr Leeson reported directly to
London.
The Serious Fraud Office said last night it had not uncovered any evidence of
criminal actions by London-based Barings staff, but it would be taking a keen
interest in developments in Singapore. The SFO investigation into Barings would
be reactivated in the event that information were to come to light which
warranted it pursuing any actions in Britain, he added.

NICK LEESON had the world in his hands - but let it slip through his fingers.
The boy who went from a Watford council estate to dealing in hundreds of
millions of pounds, sent world markets crashing.
His actions reverberated around the globe as his bosses at Barings Bank, in
London, tried to disassociate themselves from his activities.
Leeson, 28, is the only son of a plasterer. His mother died ten years ago and
Bill Leeson took charge of Nick, his younger brother and two sisters.
At school, Nick was a prefect, a good footballer but not too bright
academically. He failed his maths A-level and left Parmiter's School with two
poor passes in French and History.
Like many of the school's old boys, he went to work in the world of banking.
His first job was as a clerk at Coutts.
Three years later, he switched to the merchant bank Morgan Stanley, where he
made his mark as a dealer in futures. Within five years, he was being
head-hunted by Baring Brothers.
As the whizz-kidd went from strength to strength, he met and married Lisa Sims,
who worked at the bank as a secretary.
Soon they were living a luxury lifestyle in Singapore - but hardly had time to
enjoy it.
Lisa, 27, stood loyally by her husband and was by his side as they fled
Singapore only to be stopped in Germany. She returned to Singapore with him
when he was finally extradited. Leeson had been pale and drawn as he was
arrested in Germany. But his return to Singapore last week was more relaxed.
He sipped gin and tonic on the plane and smiled as he made his first court
appearance on arrival.
Now he will have time to contemplate how the couple will be able to pick up the
pieces of their life on his release.
Lisa was staying out of the limelight with friends yesterday - and was ``not
too bad'' under the circumstances, her father, Mr Alec Sims, said.
He said he did not know if Mrs Leeson, a part-time waitress, had any plans to
fly to Singapore.
A spokeswoman at the Elizabeth Tea Rooms, in Pudding Lane, Maidstone, where Mrs
Leeson works, said she was not expected in and could not say where she was.

TRADING in derivatives involves gambling with the chance of making mountains of
money - and the risk of losing spectacularly.
They are ``derived'' from the underlying price of other investments, including
futures, which involve betting on future prices.
A certain amount of money is invested in the hope that the value of a
commodity, currency, shares or bonds will rise.
If it does, your bonus for making your company truckloads of money is assured.
If not, it can mean financial oblivion.
The particular attraction of derivatives comes from the fact that only a small
down-payment is needed to stand a chance of hitting the big time.
Leeson lost Barings hundreds of millions of pounds by gambling on a contract
linked to share prices on Tokyo's Nikkei index.
The multi-billion pound global derivatives business came about when
stockbrokers were dreaming up new ways of increasing business in the late 1980s
after the world stock market crash of 1987.
Derivatives are very highly geared - each pound of investment can carry #20 of
risk or more. And they are complex - many bank directors are said not to
understand what the young dealers in their employ are doing.
Many City observers say that futures markets have been in business longer than
traditional stock markets, which is trade based on the current price of shares.
It is thought that trading in rice futures in Japan began centuries ago and
many believe they can play a useful role.
Commodity futures, for example, allow a farmer to fix the price for his crops
in advance.
Those in favour of derivatives say they can help offset risk in an increasingly
volatile market.

OVER the course of a dozen years, Edinburgh-born skier John Vaitkus has slowly
become one of skiing's more familiar faces. Captured in spectacular action for
the pages of ski magazines and videos across the world, his profile is
instantly recognisable. His neat, technically precise skiing mixes control with
absurd dynamics and at 37 he remains in demand as one of an elite breed of
international skier.
Paradoxically for all his globe-spanning exposure to ski enthusiasts of all
standards, he remains almost entirely anonymous. Vaitkus has lived in Chamonix
for more than 10 years and has the unmatched snowfields, challenging couloirs
and cornices as his daily ``office'' routine, making his living as one of
Europe's leading ski models.
It's a remarkable existence and a success story which has outlasted the
hundreds of pretty-boy rich-kid Europeans, Antipodeans and Americans who
gravitate to photographic meccas such as Chamonix for a post-ski racing
pre-college rite of passage - if they're lucky earning beer money and perhaps a
few glossy enlargements of a once-in-a-lifetime leap.
``Over the past few years it has become crazy out here. There are kids who are
prepared to fling themselves off anything without a second thought just to get
themselves on to film. It's amazing that, as yet, there's been no real tragedy,
but it's waiting to happen,'' says Vaitkus, who has worked with most of
Europe's top photographers, but now chooses only to work mostly as a close-knit
team, with those who sympathise with his working methods and ethics.
``It's come to the stage where photographers demand more and more, not because
they've shot it all perfectly before, but because they want to make up for
their technical shortcomings by getting kids to do bigger more radical jumps
and that's stupid.''
Vaitkus points to the exploits of the mohawk-styled American stunt skier Glen
Plake and Scott Schmidt; and also producer Greg Stump whose enormous video
sales have made them ski-household names. Their exploits become simply
run-of-the-mill, swelling this lemming-like exodus to the mountains to jump
higher and further in pursuit of celluloid glory.
His stock in trade has been stills and video work in advertisements and
promotions for leading worldwide manufacturers such as Salomon and Tenson,
while in the UK one of the most comprehensive annual collections of Vaitkus in
action is featured in the retail chain Ellis Brigham's weighty, glossy
mail-order bible The White Book in which he has starred for a number of years.
The world recession in the ski market coupled with the fast-growing influx of
do-it-for-nothing thrill seekers has made it all the tougher. He reflects that
five years ago a mere 20 days of work early in the season was more than enough
to keep body and soul intact for the year. Now now he is increasingly being
forced to exploit other avenues in paragliding and climbing.
Those who hire him rank him among only a handful of successful, totally
dedicated European ski-action models. While his contemporaries have almost
universally Alpine or Scandinavian backgrounds, born in the mountains,
Vaitkus's enduring passion for the sport started on the dry-slope matting of
Hillend as one of the first Edinburgh comprehensive school kids taught to ski
as part of the curriculum.
He too may have served his apprenticeship on the race circuits in the winter,
but he also bummed in the summer skiing resorts, living in a beaten-up Renault
6 for three months just to ski every day.
His teenage potential was rewarded as one of the first recipients of the Boyd
Anderson scholarship, which was awarded by the benefactor who granted much of
the land Hillend is sited on. It was for less privileged kids who needed to get
racing and training on snow. He went on to become a respected coach to British
Alpine Racing Clubs but gave up when, he says, he really felt he couldn't look
British children in the eye and tell them they really could go on to win World
Cups.
``Racing's a vital background for what I do now. It requires at least
centimetre if not millimetre precision every time, just as it's needed when you
make a turn for a top photographer who expects you to keep the skis' logos
perfectly framed - even when you're dropping in on a big cornice -- so I guess
all those wet nights at Hillend must be worth something now!''
Most of all he feels the new crop of bone-headed daredevils are simply missing
the point, trading only on the freefalling seconds of big air - not that he
doesn't still yearn for the same regular adrenalin fix and will take the
scariest of drops in his stride, but his is a craft which has been honed
through winter and summer months in Chamonix.
``Now I always know the risks exactly, intuitively. I'll have flown the slopes
through the summer paragliding, or climbed them, and know the likely conditions
for any given weather pattern. We set out to minimise the risks. I want to do
this for a lifetime, not to have to give it up tomorrow. What most of these
kids are losing out on is the whole mountain experience.''
Vaitkus has turned director, teaming up with fellow skier Roger Lambert and
Swedish cameraman Lars Pykto to make their second film over a six-week period
last spring. The Long Way Down records an inspirational descent from a 4000m
peak above Chamonix dropping 6000ft of vertical, down through the tree line
towards the valley floor.
Avoiding the cliches of endless cliff jumps and wipeouts, it concentrates
instead on stunning scenery and dangerous descents in areas never skied before.
With a budget of around #15,000 it reputedly challenges even the multi-million
dollar productions of Warren Miller.
At one point in shooting Vaitkus dropped on to a 45-degree untouched face only
to find the six inches of new snow slide away from underneath him to reveal a
sheer wall of glacial blue ice.
``My first thought was that my only means of survival, my ice axe, was on my
pack but fortunately I had brand new skis on and the razor sharp edges gripped
until I managed to get my pack off and sort myself out.''
In the immediate future the trio will be skiing to earn their keep but looking
for funding for their next film project. A job which, says Vaitkus, is a much
more daunting mountain to conquer

n NAIL Revitaliser from Mane 'n' Tail is a combination of moisturisers which
you massage into the cuticles each day to combat splitting and irregular
ridges. I have irregular ridges, so does the Grand Canyon, but like the tourist
attraction itself, they don't make me any less beautiful. Mane 'n' Tail hired a
clairvoyant to promote their product (why should you never go to the movies
with a clairvoyant? because they've probably seen it), and she says the shape
of your nails are a clue to your personality.
n If your nails grow down you have a controlling personality, if they grow up
you suffer from hypertension.
n If you have thin fingers you are spiritual and flexible and
anti-materialistic. Chunky fingers betray a sensual, stubborn, indulgent nature.
n If you have long fingers you are patient, broad-minded and pay great
attention to detail - the longer your fingers are in relation to the size of
your hands the more patient and painstaking you are. If you have short fingers
you are instinctive and impulsive. You do not suffer fools and you're an
excellent organiser, but you have a tendency to flirt with other women's men.
Shame on you!
n If you have small hands you are hard-working, energetic, earthy and
intuitive. You pull your sleeves up in a crisis. If you have large hands you
are broad-minded, artistic and expansive.
Nail Revitaliser is available from Boots priced #4.35 for 113g.
n Square nails - placid, practical and calm
n Oblong nails - fiery, short-tempered but
forgiving
n Rounded nails - intuitive but impractical
n Long narrow nails - narrow-minded and
stubborn
n Fan-shaped nails - sensitive and prone to
stress
n Oval nails - easy-going, open and sulky
