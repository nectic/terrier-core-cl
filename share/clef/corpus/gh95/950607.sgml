* SERVES British Rail right for running all those so-called ghost
trains to try and outwit the courts. Forward planning has its merits,
but, you should not count your chickens when the beaks at the Court of
Session can peck back.
A map in the May edition of Intercity magazine shows Scottish stations
with sleeper services. No Fort William though. Funny that Thurso and
Wick also don't have their own place and are just represented by a
single upward arrow. Do they know something we don't?
Bike run
* HOWEVER, John o'Groat's has been put back on the map by Sheriff
Charles Palmer, newly finished his epic 1002-mile ride from Land's End
in aid of the British Heart Foundation. A benchmark in many ways, as the
first heart attack and triple heart-bypass patient, never mind sheriff,
to complete the journey by bike.
Nineteen days in the saddle weren't without incident: deluges in the
West Country and again between Callander and Glencoe, a brief tumble
north of Spean Bridge. ''I had a sore bum for a few days at the
beginning because nobody told me you don't wear underpants under cycle
shorts. Apart from that everthing went very well. It's been one of the
best things I have ever done. I've never felt fitter'' he said.
Thus far the total raised is #24,000 with a particularly generous
response from English judges, despite the BHF earmarking the proceeds
for Scotland. Those Scottish lawyers still holding on to their fivers or
tenners should send cheques off to the BHF, c/o Sheriff Palmer,
Dunfermline Sheriff Court, 1/6 Carnegie Drive, Dunfermline.
Over and out
* DESPITE all the efforts searching for bon mots on someone's
retirement, it does not always work out that way. Like the Catholic
Marriage Advisory Service for Scotland whose outgoing president Ian
Shanley was commended, according to the Scottish Catholic Observer, for
his ''on the job professionalism.''
And there is yet another blow for Tannadice as it loses its only fan
in the Cabinet Office, Sir William Stewart, who hangs up his white coat
today after five years as the Government's chief scientist. His boss,
Science Minister David Hunt complimented him as: ''Islay's greatest
export . . . who has put British science back at the top of the Premier
League'', but then added, ''which is more than you can say for Dundee
United.'' Ouch!
Murphy's law
* IN the pleading business, it's always worth having a go, even before
Sheriff Andrew Murphy. A solicitor seeking bail for his client at
Falkirk Sheriff Court pointed out that despite a long record, the
accused had been out of trouble for the last 12 months. But as the
sharp-eyed Murphy rejoined dryly: ''He has been in prison for the last
year. I suppose that has a bearing on it.''
Brotherly love
* THE emasculation of trade unions under a tide of legislation from
the present Government was confirmed in depressing fashion by the
unedifying battle between the AEEU and GMB over redundancies at the Nigg
Fabrication yard in the Moray Firth. As if that wasn't bad enough,
immediately beside its report headlined ''Nigg workers vote to end
strike'', the Scotsman ran an advert which began: ''Gentlemen: are you
currently receiving treatment for impotence?''
Far out
* AS a drugs trial was about to start, it became apparent that an
important witness was missing. Temporary judge Robin McEwan, QC, was
informed of the possibility that the witness might be in South America.
On the other hand, the Crown informed the court, he might well be on his
way to court. ''Is that via the Pacific?'' queried Mr McEwan.
The same trial, which involved allegations of cannabis growing,
provided a fascinating glimpse into the home life of dear old Queen
Victoria. It emerged in evidence that police had found a copy of the
magazine The Face at the home of one of the accused. According to the
magazine, cannabis has been used over the years to treat various
ailments. One promiment user was the long-reigning monarch who
apparently found it helpful in combating pains at a certain time of the
month.
What we still don't know is whether she was prescribed it by her
doctor or whether a certain faithful Highland retainer kept more in his
sporran than the odd bawbee.
Outline diction
A SHORTHAND writer was experiencing some difficulty in getting down
every word uttered by that eminent pleader, Mr Gordon Jackson, QC. The
problem seemed to result from a combination of the speed of the Jackson
delivery and his resonant Scots accent completely devoid of the 'bool in
the mooth'. Following an intervention by the trial judge, Lord Marnoch,
Mr Jackson conceded that he could speak a bit more slowly, but reckoned
there was not much he could do about his accent. Faculty wits have now
sugggested a series of elocution lessons, with advocate James Reilly as
a possible tutor.
Sotto voce
* ON the subject of plain speaking, there are signs that dropping to
10p may have taken some of the power out of the Thunderer's voice. In
its Scottish Law Reports, the London Times refers to Lord Gill granting
decree of declarator de piano. Presumably it meant de plano, but the
prospect of musical accompaniment to judicial pronouncements is not
without its appeal. Maybe Lord Weir ex-temporising to Count Basie, Lord
Hope as Glenn Gould, and Lord McCluskey tinkling the ivories as Russ
Conway. As yet we only have Hazel Aronson to substitute for Mrs Mills
and Lord Osborne as a drummer.

THE beauty of timber frame is the flexibility it affords builders.
The traditional market for this form of construction is housing --
everything from small bungalows to flats in locations ranging from the
remotest island to suburbs of large cities, but in the commercial and
industrial sectors, the technology is being used for an increasing
number of projects -- from small, single business units to large
warehouses.
With safety in mind, every timber frame project is examined and
cerificated by a industrial or structural engineer. All structures which
meet SCOTFI standards will also be marked with their Quality Scheme
Symbol.

CURRENTLY building on seven sites throughout Scotland, with another
five due to arrive on the market for the during the summer months, Tay
Homes offers a package of special bonus features for the family seeking
a new home with part-exchange as part of the transaction.
''During the month of June we are increasing the valuation figure we
will apply against a new home to a full 100%,'' said Tay director Iain
Stewart. ''Normally, a certain amount is deducted from the value -- it
can be between #1000 and #2000 below a full part-exchange offer -- to
represent the costs involved.
''During the summer we are also operating another scheme which can add
#250 to what the new house buyer will receive. This bonus will apply if
we begin marketing the house from the moment the buyer signs on for that
new home rather than when it is ready for occupancy. It is an extra
incentive which will allow us more time to market the house we are
accepting as that part-exchange, even while the owner is still living in
it.''
The Tay approach to part-exchange also includes a mortgage offer of
two years' free mortgage protection, part of a pattern intended to
provide confidence to the potential purchaser who is considering moving.
Tay also operate their ''Backstop'' plan which they describe as ''an
alternative to full part-exchange''. Backstop concerns new properties
which will not be completed for around six months.
But right away the customer can be given a firm valuation on their
present home, usually #1000 or #2000 below a full part-exchange offer
value. The customer then has until four weeks before their new house is
ready to indicate whether they wish to accept the offer or have
succeeded in making their own sale.
''Backstop offers a guaranteed sale, a negotiating tool in dealing
with potential customers for a family's existing home, and the so
important element of confidence,'' said Iain Stewart. ''Like full
part-exchange, Backstop is an integral part of our sales approach.''
The Tay Homes plan follows a practical set of basic guidelines. The
first is that the new house purchaser must be ''trading up'' by at least
#20,000 in value. A reservation must be placed on a new Tay Homes
property, one which is either complete and ready for occupancy or is
scheduled for completion within three to four months.
The customer's existing home is valued by both a building society
valuer and an estate agent. Then, based upon an average valuation drawn
from the two reports, an offer is made to the purchaser.
''If the client accepts, the missives are concluded,'' said Iain
Stewart. ''If not, then either a revised offer is negotiated or the
client can cancel.
''It is a very fair scheme, to everyone's benefit. If there is a
stumbling block to a deal, it is because some clients cling to an
unrealistic value of their present property.
''But above all part-exchange provides that vital ingredient of
confidence to the potential purchaser on the move -- including job
movers who do not have the time or the inclination to be involved in
selling their existing house while trying to settle into a new job some
distance away in new surroundings.''
During the month of June we are increasing the valuation figure we
will apply against a new home to a full 100%

''AN important string to our negotiating bow,'' is how Persimmon Homes
describes its new part-exchange scheme, created to make the business of
house buying as smooth as possible for potential customers.
The Persimmon approach to part-exchange was launched last autumn. The
firm had realised that while there was no shortage of would-be
purchasers genuinely interested in buying they included a number who
were reluctant to commit themselves until they had sold an existing
home.
''As a company we were already offering buyers what we regarded as an
unbeatable package in which our Home Change Scheme was part,'' said
Margaret Cumming, Persimmon's sales director. ''Home change involved us
as a company in the professional marketing of a client's existing
property at no cost to them.
''But there could be no guarantee that the property would sell at the
end of an agreed period. So we developed the scheme further. We decided
to offer straight part-exchange. Under the revised plan we would buy our
client's house at an agreed valuation and they would then be free to
move into their new Persimmon home.''
The results benefited the Persimmon customers involved and left the
company owning a number of properties throughout Central Scotland. These
were in a wide variety of locations and ranged in size from one-bedroom
flats to four-bedroomed detached villas.
Persimmon who rate as seventh in size in the UK league of private
housebuilding companies, found the new approach an outstanding success.
In the months that have followed there has been an immediate increase in
inquiries for these established properties -- a demand that has
continued ever since.
While their new house customers benefit from the positive ability to
sell their existing homes to Persimmon at an agreed valuation, the
resulting stock of established homes also represents exceptional value
when marketed.
A prospective purchaser can receive financial assistance through low
interest mortgage packages, along with legal costs and survey fees being
partially funded.

* HOME-OWNERS in Scotland can expect to see a gentle increase in the
value of their property -- but only if the Government holds back from
raising interest rates. That's the verdict of the region's estate agents
as reported in the Birmingham Midshires/ICM Housing Monitor.
Estate agents in Scotland expect values to recover by an average of
0.8% in the next 12 months if interest rates remain constant; but nine
out of ten say a rate rise would damage recovery in the housing market.
Elsewhere in the UK, agents in London and the South East are the most
optimistic, predicting average increases of 2.3% and 1.1% respectively.
The gloomiest outlook is in the North of England, with a projected
downturn of 0.1%.
Mike Jackson, chief executive of Birmingham Midshires Building
Society, says: ''The Government has shown it cannot be trusted with the
prosperity of Britain's home-owners and should now resist the temptation
to cause further damage on top of this year's reduction in MIRAS.
Interest rates should be kept stable and the Government should cancel
the proposed cutbacks in benefits paid to home-owners unable to work.''
The Housing Monitor, commissioned by Birmingham Midshires, is
conducted by leading market research pollsters ICM. A random sample of
300 estate agent offices throughout the country were polled by
telephone.

SCOTLAND'S manager of the year, Jimmy Nicholl, is wanted by relegated
Norwich City, who have been without a leader since John Dehan left the
club in April.
Nicholl, who took Raith Rovers to success in the first division
championship as well as the Coca-Cola Cup and a place in the UEFA Cup
next season, is on a short leet of three.
The others are former England keeper Ray Clemence, now manager of
Barnet, and Nicholl's former Northern Ireland team-mate Martin O'Neill,
who is in charge of Wycombe Wanderers.
Nicholl said last night: ''I came into the office after my holiday
today to discover that our chairman had given Norwich permission to
speak to me. I will speak to their chairman Mr Chase and we will take it
from there.''

WHEN he saw Louis XIV's stables at Versailles, the Elector of Hanover
exclaimed: ''The King of France's horses are better housed than I!'' If
he took a canter over the hills above Milngavie, he would be impressed
by how the horses are housed at Easterton of Mugdock today. This estate
is built round a luxurious modern country mansion with its own thriving
equestrian and livery business. With around 64 acres of paddocks and
woodland, the estate -- a kingdom for the horse -- has been built up by
a businessman who bought a few acres and an old farmhouse in the 1980s.
Easterton House is an impressive south-facing property built in 1988.
Accommodation comprises: three reception rooms, six bedrooms, four
bathrooms, kitchen and breakfast room, and two conservatories. The
leisure wing includes a steam room, sauna, and swimming pool. There are
garages for four cars and about five acres of ground. Adjoining the
house around a courtyard with central raised gardens is a stable block
with stabling for five horses and a two-bedroom flat.
It is a short trot to Easterton Stables, a busy livery and equestrian
centre in about 35 acres with 24 loose boxes, tackroom, haysheds, a sand
arena, and a 1000-metre sand canter track. A four-bedroom flat goes with
the stables. The purpose-built equestrian centre has its own access, via
an archway under an imposing clock tower, entirely separate from the
house. The property is available in five lots, or as a whole. The joint
agents, G&amp;S Properties and Cluttons, are seeking offers over #520,000
for Easterton House and offers over #245,000 for Easterton Stables.
Three parcels of land of between five and ten acres are available at
prices from #15,000 to over #25,000. Total price? #825,000.

DE LA RUE'S banknote printing activities are not proving as lucrative
as its investment in the National Lottery.
Profits before exceptionals did rise 22% to #152m in the year to March
but this was not good enough for the market where doubts on prospects
caused the shares to dip 14p to 913p. The 22.5% stake in Camelot
produced a contribution of #2.4m. The group has written off its costs
associated with the setting up of the lottery, which cost #30m in total.
Also written off are reorganisation costs of #4.9m following the #662m
purchase of Portals, which provides the paper on which the group prints
its banknotes.
The paper business is now integrated with the printing side, giving
the group the vertical integration it wanted. The expected benefits are
beginning to come through, such as in research and development and
cross-selling to each other's customers. The group intends to sell off
Portals' other activities, which are worth around #160m. Since the
year-end the engineering and technology business has been sold for #50m.
De La Rue, under the chief executive Peter Marshall, shocked the
market back in March when it warned of only modest growth in profits.
The actual results show that associates, including the Camelot stake,
made #28m against #15.6m, contributing about half the overall gain.
While not exactly on the scale of the lottery, De La Rue shareholders
receive a 15% dividend uplift at 23p, in line with the rise in earnings
per share.
De la Rue's traditional banknote printing division increased operating
profits by a tenth to #56m, though turnover was up 51% at #323m with the
bulk of the increase representing sales of banknote printing equipment
to state-owned works overseas. The already mouth-watering margins have
increased further from 26% to 26.5%. Security printing apart from
banknotes continued to do well in the export sector.
Payment systems saw a downturn, with profits off 5% at #38.5m. The
German subsidiary, Garny, was hit by increased capacity which came on
stream with unification. Its orders have started increasing again lately
however. The rest of the division made progress. Costs were tightly
controlled in the face of pricing pressure, leaving margins barely
altered.
Spending on Portals and the lottery cut De La Rue's cash balances back
from #375m to #106m.
The outlook for security printing has turned dull, with orders below
the levels seen in recent years, while the main benefits of the Portals
acquisition will be felt from next year. Recovery is seen in payment
systems, so long as the upturn in Germany is sustained.

FEW subjects have caused more excitement and discord than the National
Lottery and now the profits earned by its Camelot owner have added to
the general gaiety.
Chief executive Tim Holley and the rest of the board are an easy
target in the wake of British Gas and the Cedric Brown pay row. Mr
Holley is receiving a payment totalling #443,000 for the 10 month
period. That includes a base salary of #200,000, a bonus of #120,000,
benefits of #11,000 and a pension fund contribution of #120,000.
The base salary this year is being raised just 4%. So on an annualised
basis he can earn #599,000 before pension contribution and perks with
the bonus being capped at 140% of base salary.
But personality Elizabeth Hurley is reportedly receiving #1m a year to
feature Estee Lauder cosmetics -- and even the most virulent critic of
either Tim Holley or Gas's Cedric Brown would concede they do work
pretty hard for half that sum. And Gazza now being bought by Rangers --
what is he really worth?
It is Camelot shareholders who pay the salaries out of their profit
and the argument is surely not what Mr Holley and colleagues get but
Camelot's arrangement with the Heritage Department which should be
scrutinised if that is really necessary.
At one level, the National Lottery is the transfer of resources from
the vast majority -- some 30 million Britons out of an ''eligible'' 44
million indulge -- with there being justifiable anger that a total of
some #21m or so has gone to buy the Churchill Papers and Marr Lodge,
where the beneficiaries are markedly few in number.
There is also deep suspicion that an unduly high distribution will be
made to good causes that include the fat cats' Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden rather than to less high profile but worthy causes where the
payback in enjoyment per pound spent will be appreciably higher.
Commercially, the lottery has been an outstanding success. In the
period between the launch on November 14 and end March, sales have
exceeded all expectations at #1191m. They are about #340m above the
forecast made by Camelot which won the licence in competition with seven
other applicants. These include Richard Branson's Virgin Group which
offered to donate all profit to charity.
The shareholders each with 22.5% are Cadbury Schweppes, De la Rue,
lottery specialist GTECH and Racal, with terminals supplier
International Computers having 10%.
Around #562m was distributed in prizes during the period to over 27
million winners. The odds of winning the jackpot outright are about 14
million to one against, worse than the football pools and sometimes seem
even less likely than on some horses one may fancy.
The good causes have been allocated #317m which is #90m above forecast
and Camelot seems on present form to be on safe ground that it will be
able to hand over #9bn out of the promised #32bn revenue generated in
its seven year concession period.
It is impossible to quell controversy over the distribution of prize
money. Mr Holley said yesterday that when there is a roll-up as there
was last week when no-one won the jackpot, sales in the second week when
the honey pot approaches #20m rise by 20% above normal.
That is the dream factor coming into play where fantasies as to what
the winner would, and should, do with the money frequently enliven
existences. And what is the harm in that as comparatively few spend more
than loose change.
Do we really want prize sizes to be decided by professional
do-gooders?
The inflow into the lottery is now amounting to #110m a week and has
been doing quite discernible damage to retail trade as measured by the
official statistics. It has also affected other gambling activities such
as football pools, particularly Vernons, horse-racing -- Ladbrokes have
squeaked a little on being hit on two fronts and also casinos as
experienced by Stakis.
The pre-tax profit in the period of #10.8m represents a return of just
0.9% on turnover and is expected to remain at 1% over the life of the
franchise -- above annual sales of #3.7bn, good causes receive an
increasing proportion of turnover at 30.6% compared with just 26.6% in
the initial start-up year.
Camelot's take falls to 1.65% to cover costs which include advertising
which this year will amount to around #50m.
To be sure Camelot was anxious to play up the volatility of future
revenues which are expected to amount to #5bn this year. Instant scratch
cards which have seen some fraud have probably done more damage to
charities than the on-line National Lottery although Camelot says there
are incidences of competing charitable scratch cards seeing an
improvement in sales.
New games will be introduced each month but some overseas lotteries
have seen this area decline in popularity -- that the National Lottery
has been the fastest growing in the world and is also the biggest
carries the danger that it could be a shooting star and fade as boredom
grows -- the BBC Lottery draw programme is a disaster.
If Camelot had not met the launch date it would have been fined #1m a
day while it invested an initial #50m. So an adequate reward for risk is
its due and if it is highly successful, then the good causes benefit in
even greater proportion.
If Camelot was set up as a commercial enterprise, approved by
Parliament and which coincidentally has transferred a total of #156m to
the Treasury, then the remuneration argument is being over-blown.

IT'S possible, as a serving ''laptop bombardier'', that we've missed
the real meaning of the Bosnia crisis, but we are grateful to Alan
Watkins, the venerable sage of the Independent on Sunday, for putting us
straight.
Writing to the nation at the weekend, he said: ''. . . Croatia is not
a sovereign state in international law. Still less is Bosnia. The
criteria for statehood are a government in effective control of a
defined piece of territory. Bosnia satisfies none of these.''
There: the answer at last. Bosnia cannot be a state until the Serbs
stop attacking it, and the Serbs won't stop attacking until Bosnia stops
declaring itself a state. If the Bosnians do anything to establish their
state, such as defeating Serb armies, they merely prove they are not in
control of a ''defined piece of territory''.
Gosh. Did Hitler mention any of this to anyone 56 years ago? And is
Rifkind taking notes? But we wonder what would happen, under the Watkins
Doctrine, if some little group, say five million meek north Europeans,
simply voted to declare statehood without going out and gaining
''effective control''? We think, as Mr Watkins and the London press like
to say, we should be told.
Rat race
BRITAIN, according to a survey published yesterday by the Chartered
Institute of Environmental Health, now has more rats than humans.
Researchers add that the number of rat infestations has soared by 39%
since 1979.
A spokesman for rats retorted last night that a 39% rise was simply
the going rate for the job and entirely justifiable if British Gas were
to continue to attract the right calibre of rodent, so there.
Refreshing honesty
SOMETIMES you might as well just say what you mean. There in the
personal columns of yesterday's Guardian, amid all those ''thoughtful,
humorous, intelligent non-smoking'' males and the ''scintillating,
vivacious, professional'' women seeking soul-mates, was a true cry from
the heart. Did he want love, happiness, marriage? Not quite.
''Make an old man very happy. Buy him a pint in one of many old beamed
pubs in the historic area. I live nine miles north of Edgware.''
Firey furnace
FROM Brisbane, Australia, comes news of slight embarrassment for the
local fire brigade, who have just had a blaze put out for them. In their
own fire station. By the ambulance service.
Driving home from a call, officers of the Queensland Ambulance Service
saw smoke and flames emerging from the kitchen of the Capalaba fire
station in south Brisbane. Breaking in, they discovered a scene familiar
to fire prevention officers the world over: someone, going out in a
rush, had left the grill on.
The station was unmanned at the time, reported an unreasonably jolly
spokeswoman for the ambulance service, because the ''fireys'', as
they're known down under, were out on a job. Putting out a fire,
apparently.
Makes sense
NICE TO see that Dr Hastings Banda, nonagenarian former dictator and
Kirk stalwart (Motto: Apres moi, the Church and Nation Committee),
hasn't lost his sense of humour. Responding to claims by doctors that he
is unfit to stand trial for murder, the old charmer retorts: ''Who is
saying that? Do I look crazy? I don't think so.''
But of course, doc: any notorious thug who actually wants to be tried
for murder is quite obviously sane. And you've never looked crazy in
your life, have you?
Innocent pastime
STILL with murder, we hear that America's entrepreneurial spirit is
holding up under the strain of the O J Simpson trial rather better than
its legal system. With Judge Ito down to his last two alternate jurors
(defined as any person who can prove they're not negotiating the sale of
book rights while deciding on a man's innocence) and most US lawyers
predicting a mistrial, Carnival Cruise Lines of California is offering a
once-in-a-lifetime holiday.
It is, of course, the O J Trial of the Century Cruise, a Los Angeles
to Baja, Mexico, weekend package, scheduled for September and offering
panel discussions, talks by legal experts, games, and trivia contests
devoted exclusively to the fate of Mr Simpson. Lynch mobs and gambolling
around the gallows, we understand, are just no fun any more.
* ALSO from the States comes news that President Clinton has responded
to Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's recent attack on Hollywood for
producing violent, sex-filled films. Clinton said he had no problem with
the Republican's arguments just so long as the issue was not
politicised.
Apparently the President is keen to keep sex out of politics.
Hell hath no
fury . . .
THE recent, astonishing publicity surrounding Ms Julie Burchill and
the fate of her magazine has seen the scribbler deliver herself of some
choice language concerning people who were once her bosom buddies. The
world of the Groucho Club -- where you have to eat with your fork
because all the knives are buried in people's backs -- is like that.
Fighting to stay awake through the coverage we were, however, reminded
of a remark by Tony Parsons, the reformed punk who survived both
marriage to Burchill and her subsequent bad-mouthing. ''Hell hath no
fury,'' he once said, ''like an ex-wife run to fat.''
Diabolical liberty
FINALLY, arts news. The top prize in this year's Advertising Age
awards in New York has been won by a television commercial that tells
the tale of a cut-throat businessman who dies and discovers that hell is
a place with giant chocolate chip cookies but no milk to wash them down.

THE runaway musical success of last season -- without argument -- was
the first concert series staged, very much as an act of faith, by the
newly-formed Children's Music Foundation in Scotland.
The Royal Scottish National and Scottish Opera orchestras put on five
lunchtime concerts in Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. Each was short, some
had a guest presenter, and each featured mostly bite-sized chunks of
popular, classical music. And every one of them sold out.
Each concert had the atmosphere of a party, packed with kids and
family groups. So successful was the series, it was inevitable that it
would be followed up.
Yesterday, the second series was launched, and -- reflecting the huge
success of the first -- major expansion is involved. The same two
orchestras will feature. Five weekend concerts will again be staged in
Glasgow. But the new series extends to Edinburgh, where three will be
promoted at the Usher Hall, and to Aberdeen's Music Hall, which will
house one concert.
In addition, the foundation has been approached by the MacRobert
Centre in Stirling, which will buy in three concerts.
Conductors for the series will include several from last season --
Nicholas Kok and Christopher Bell (the latter revealed a singular talent
as entertainer as well as conductor). They are joined in the new series
by some big names wanting in on the kids' act: Richard Armstrong,
musical director of Scottish Opera, and film composer Carl Davis.
Brochures and tickets for the series, which begins in Glasgow and
Edinburgh in October, are available now.

ONE of Christopher Gable's main aims is audience participation. No,
not as in hauling some hapless body from the stalls on to the stage, but
as in drawing the audience in to the heart and pulse of whatever scene
is unfolding before them. Well, this Northern Ballet Theatre production
of Romeo and Juliet not only compels and involves, it tempts one towards
dramatic heresy: a different ending to Shakespeare's play -- because
those silly, wonderful children deserved to live and love and confound
the stupid, arrogant prejudices of their parents.
This production is eminently persuasive -- and that's because of
limited company numbers. If crowd scenes are a shade thin, individual
performances are rich in character and emotion. William Walker (Romeo)
and Jayne Regan (Juliet) both convey the heady, impulsive nature of
teenage passion. They respond to each other with a kind of voracious
wonderment that steams with emerging hormones and newfound poetical
yearnings. At times one almost overlooks the panache and expertise of
the dancing, simply because the acting is so riveting.
Now this degree of interpretation could seem out of kilter if the
steps didn't accommodate it. But Moricone's choreography, with its
astute blend of classical and contemporary techniques, easily allows the
heat of a given moment to find whatever body language is appropriate, be
it a teetering bourree of inner apprehension or a floor-bound sprawl of
sexual abandon.
Another strength of this version is the way in which it melds everyday
banality with high tragedy.
What this production proves is that flair, committed performances, and
a determination to serve the drama of the piece can conquer limited
resources and provide audiences with an evening to believe in and
remember.

VALERY TOUGH considers the questions raised by a play about the life
of a schizophrenic
TO be frank, it's a crazy world. The lead character of Beast
Productions' The Trouble with Frank is in trouble. His world is ruled by
drugs, he doesn't have a job or a fixed abode, he shows scant regard for
the authority of the professionals, and now he's up for criminal damage.
A shell-suited one-man family from Hell, destined to a life of poverty,
squalor, and crime? Not quite.
The drug Frank takes -- or, more problematically, doesn't take -- is
prescribed medication for schizophrenia. He doesn't have a job because
jobs are hard to come by when you've spent three years in a psychiatric
ward, and he doesn't have a home because the community which is supposed
to be caring for him can't offer him anything permanent.
On view at Paisley Arts Centre tonight, the play is an hour-long look
at his life and relationships, both with the professionals who are
supposed to help him and with his sister who, although clinically sane,
is disco-mad. So does The Trouble with Frank see the start of a new
theatrical genre of community care drama? Director Fiona Miller, whose
impressive community theatre CV includes work with 7:84, TAG, Dundee
Rep, and the National Theatre, is adamant that the production is strong
theatre in its own right.
''The role of Frank is a strong, emotional one -- it's a great part
for a male actor. We're not out to make a huge statement from any one
standpoint. We're not saying this is how community care is or should be
-- it's just one man's view of his life.''
Beast -- Fiona Miller and dramatherapist Andrew Dawson -- was set up
in 1994 to provide training and development for local authorities,
schools, and community arts organisations. Last year saw them securing
funding to provide a training residency for social work staff from
Strathclyde Regional Council, funding which seems set to continue into
1996. The Trouble with Frank was commissioned from writer Roderick
Stewart in order to explore mental health issues. Stewart is perhaps
better qualified to comment than most, having a family member with a
history of schizophrenia.
The play is intended as a springboard for discussion, and to this end
Beast held a preview and workshop at Glasgow's Centre for Contemporary
Arts earlier this week for mental health workers. However, the minefield
that is 90s-style political correctness often dictates that people like
Frank are presented in a positive light, not helpless victims of a
debilitating condition.
Frank's experience is not positive. Although he is witty and obviously
intelligent, we see his sense of reality disintegrate as the voices in
his head leave him hopelessly disempowered. Frank was previewed in the
Arches Theatre in Glasgow in January, and while reaction from mental
health professionals was largely positive, there were accusations of
''anti-psychiatry'' and a plea to show community care working well.
Dawson (who was co-director of 7:84's New Frontiers project) believes
that Frank's role is to provide a safe environment for the exploration
of a difficult subject, not to dictate policy.
''We want to promote healthy responses to one character's pain. After
all, there is support for Frank, in the form of a psychiatrist and
social workers, but it is support he doesn't want to use. He chooses not
to take his drugs, after all. We may be questioning psychiatry, but
we're certainly not slagging it off.''
In training mental health workers to use dramatherapy techniques with
their clients Dawson is moving away from the traditional direct therapy
work of the dramatherapist.
If The Trouble with Frank achieves nothing else, it will certainly
alert its audience to the absolute normality of mental illness. If your
idea of someone with schizophrenia is Jasper Carrot's nutter on the bus,
the sight of an unassuming young man in a pair of jeans and a shirt may
well surprise.
Failing that, you may see the irony in Frank's psychiatric social
worker being on sick leave with stress -- the mental illness of our
time. Bear in mind, too, although the media choose to hold up cases such
as Christopher Clunis (the schizophrenic who stabbed a man to death on
the platform of a London Underground station), people with mental health
problems are many times more likely to die from overdoses of prescribed
medicine than they are to kill anyone else.
But, frankly my dear, does the community give a damn?
* The Trouble with Frank is at Springhall Community Centre,
Rutherglen, tomorrow, and Glasgow's Arches on Friday and Saturday,
touring thereafter. Valery Tough is Press &amp; Publications Officer at
Enable, the organisation for people with learning disabilities. The
Legal Advisers of Enable and the Scottish Association for Mental Health
have written a guide to community care law in Scotland. The Care Maze
will be published later this summer.

IT could be a sporting life for some in Pollokshields. Six new
management flats which overlook Clydesdale Cricket Club are available
for let. Not only that, but there's a good chance of seeing Rangers
football team training in the area, I'm told.
Letting agent Stephen O'Neill says it makes the flats an interesting
proposition for the sporting-minded.
They are on the southern edge of Pollokshields and only two minutes
walk from Crossmyloof station, with a fast and frequent service to the
city centre.
Maxwell Park station is about five minutes away, and there is a new
supermarket some 200 yards along the road. The development itself is of
a good standard, he points out, and the flats are to be let unfurnished,
but including new carpets, lined curtains, and fully fitted kitchen.
''There are two styles of flats available,'' he says. ''There is a
one-bedroom flat, which also has lounge, kitchen and bathroom with
shower. Alternatively, the two-bedroom flat has the same accommodation
plus an en-suite shower room off the master bedroom.
''Security is high on the agenda, and a particularly comforting
feature is the underground garage, with remote-controlled door. To the
rear, and facing south, is a raised deck type of paved garden area.''
The flats have gas central heating, double glazing, quality kitchens,
and a video security entry phone. Rents are #400-#420 a month for the
one-bedroom flats, and #475-#520 for the two-bedroom ones. Spaces in the
underground parking area come in at #20 a month.
O'Neill also has a nice big Victorian villa, not far from the new
flats. This one comes with four bedrooms and four public rooms. There
are two bathrooms, plus garaging, and its own gardens, naturally. The
all-in price is #1200 a month.
North of the river, there is a traditional flat in Hyndland. It has
two bedrooms, plus a lounge, kitchen and bathroom. Handy for those who
want to be out of the city centre, but convenient for amenities. It
comes in at #550.
The actual city centre, the Waterfront to be specific, has a lot of
supporters, of course. If you want to keep an eye on the river traffic
rather than the road-packed variety, this could be the one. Two
bedrooms, two bathrooms, lounge with French windows, and handy parking.
For #500.
Going below the magic #400 a month figure is not too difficult either.
A cosy pad in the Merchant City keeps its cachet. You get bedroom,
lounge, kitchen and bathroom with shower. Private parking is an optional
extra, but the rest can be secured for #390.
Opting for Yorkhill means your are that bit nearer the Art Galleries,
or the park, whichever takes your fancy. This flat has bedroom, lounge,
kitchen, bathroom and central heating, and it comes for #375. There's
parking, too, of course.

CELTIC, whose headlines have been more involved with internal disputes
than transfer moments, may be about to change all that. They seem likely
to make Dutch internationalist Peter van Vossen the club's first signing
of the summer but may have a contest on their hands to beat others to
the signature of Dundee United midfielder Billy McKinlay.
Van Vossen's club, Ajax, yesterday admitted that the Glasgow team have
made a concrete bid for the 27-year-old forward, who has not been able
to hold down a first-team place in the Champions' Cup-winning side this
season.
McKinlay, who will play for Scotland tonight against the Faroe
Islands, admitted that he had heard of the Parkhead club's interest, but
the race has only just begun, with Aberdeen joining English clubs
Coventry City, Everton, and Aston Villa at the post.
However, United manager Billy Kirkwood insisted that there had been no
approach from Celtic as yet. The bid, possibly in the #1.5m region, may
be en route shortly, along with one of #1m from Spurs for United's
Under-21 internationalist, David Hannah.
Van Vossen may be the first through the doors at Parkhead. An Ajax
spokesman said that Celtic, who ''seem determined'' to match the
personal terms of van Vossen, had made an impressive offer but would not
say what that amounted to. It is believed to be in the region of #1.7m.
Manager Tommy Burns, a fan of the Ajax system, has first-hand
knowledge of their style after having visited the club in January. He
has a high regard for the club and the players on their books, which is
one reason why van Vossen would be high on his list of desirable
signings.
The man who has had 18 caps for Holland is still one of the squad
members and, although kept out of the Ajax side by the exciting new
generation of players brought into the front rank by coach Louis van
Gaal, he was on the bench during the Champions' Cup final in Vienna,
when the Dutch team beat AC Milan to become the top side in Europe.
The Ajax spokesman said that the way was now open for the player to
discuss the move with Celtic directly, once he returns from holiday.
Van Vossen, who started out as an amateur, was one of the few young
Dutchmen to escape the notice of the big clubs in his own country before
he was picked up by Belgian side Anderlecht. Hibs fans may remember his
skills, as he was a member of the side that knocked out the Easter Road
team in the UEFA Cup.
He was bought by Ajax -- a huge compliment in itself, as they are very
selective in the transfer market -- for #1.5m three years ago and
continued to win caps for his country. Now he is unhappy at the prospect
of a season out of the top side, with competition from the Finn, Jari
Litmanen, Patrick Kluivert, Ronald de Boer, and Mar Overmars, to name
but a few.
Strong and fast, van Vossen can operate on either left or right, as
well as through the middle, and is also interesting Werder Bremen's new
coach, Dutchman Ad de Moss, and Spanish side Seville. However, Celtic
have a head start and, if they get the terms right, could persuade the
Dutch player to join his international colleague Pierre van Hooydonk at
Parkhead, especially as they can promise European football for him next
season.
The personal demands of Belgian star Marc Degryse seem to have put him
out of the orbit of the Parkhead club and their chances of signing
Russian internationalist Dimitri Radchenko are hitting problems because
of the work permit situation in Scotland.
A Scottish League spokesman said yesterday: ''There are no permits
available at the moment and that situation does not look like changing
in the near future.''
No such problems are involved in any McKinlay deal. The midfielder
admitted: ''It is very flattering to hear that a club, a major club,
like Celtic might want to sign me.
''I have not heard anything so far. Really, it's up to my own club to
decide if they want me to go. They know my feelings on it. I have asked
for a transfer, I am ready to contest my contract in the courts, and the
new boss, Billy Kirkwood, has spoken to me about that.
''Basically I want to go and Celtic would be an attraction for me.
However, I must wait to see exactly what my future could be.
''This is a major career move. I have had a long time at Tannadice,
eight years, and a change is essential.
''There has been talk of English clubs too, but if Celtic came in, I'd
be very happy to talk to them if the clubs had agreed terms.''
Kirkwood dismissed stories that Gordan Petric, who has been linked
with Celtic, is wanted by Bolton. However, Hannah, the 20-year-old
midfield player, wants a move to the English Premiership because he does
not want to play first-division football for United next season.
Spurs manager Gerry Francis had a #500,000 bid rejected for him
earlier in the season when he was with Queen's Park Rangers, but with
millions to spend to transform the White Hart Lane club into a major
power, he is back in for one of Scotland's most promising talents.
Hannah revealed: ''I don't think there has been a firm bid yet by
Spurs but there is a link. ''I have a year of my contract still to run
but, hopefully, something concrete will come up in the next few weeks.
Gerry Francis watched me earlier in the season and was back again for
our last game, against Celtic.''

THOSE little extras can count for a lot when buying a new house. If
the previous owner leaves some carpets and curtains, or throws in garden
tools, somehow the deal seems sweeter. And if the house was designed by
one of Scotland's most famous architects, you have the pleasure of
buying something that's cut out from the common herd. So the buyer of
one of Edinburgh's most upmarket houses will have nothing to beef about
-- it comes with a share in a herd of Limousin cows grazing nearby.
Shieldaig is a B-listed house in Hermitage Drive, among the city's
most prestigious addresses. It was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer
(1864-1929), the Edinburgh architect who specialised in large country
houses.
It is a more modest, but sparkling, example of his style, with three
public rooms, nine bedrooms, a conservatory, a tennis court, and a
separate three-bedroom property.
Norman Galbraith of DM Hall describes it as ''one of the best houses
in Hermitage Drive, which in itself is one of the best residential
addresses in Edinburgh''. The sellers bought Shieldaig 18 years ago, and
since then only one of the half dozen or so good houses on the south
side of the drive has been offered for sale.
''Houses like this come to the market so seldom that they generate
tremendous interest when they do.''
The main part of the house has three reception rooms, hall,
conservatory, laundry room and pantries, six bedrooms and two bathrooms.
There is a large garden with greenhouse, a tennis court, and garage.
The chauffeur's accommodation was built with the house and has been
upgraded to provide three additional bedrooms and a playroom for
children. This accommodation can be closed off to provide a completely
separate house with its own entrance from Hermitage Drive, and could be
let or used for secondary accommodation.
DM Hall say one of the main features is that all the main rooms in the
house face south, which makes for ''a delightfully sunny and quiet home
with a genuine rural feel''.
It looks out over an acre of garden and Hermitage of Braid, a park
which adjoins the open countryside of Braid Hills, where there are
opportunities for golf, dog-walking and child-exercising.
The seller has a lease on an 11-acre paddock beside Blackford Hill and
it is likely that the benefit of this can be passed on to the buyer of
the house. At present there are six French Limousin bullocks in the
paddock.
Offers over #800,000 are expected.

Pretoria
CONTROVERSIAL plans for a 20-team Rugby World Cup in 1999 -- for which
Scotland would have to pre-qualify if they do not finish in the top
three this year -- are to be thrashed out by officials in Johannesburg
next week.
However, the organisers may have made a rod for their own backs by
their insistence on qualification by all but the top three teams from
RWC 1995 plus the hosts, Wales, in 1999.
Currently, qualification for the finals is decided on a geographical
play-off basis and, under the existing arrangement, the Five Nations'
Championship teams, without whom a World Cup would be unthinkable, would
come under the European Western Zone.
This year, after their dismal showing in 1991, Wales were forced to
pre-qualify via wins over Portugal and Spain and a European zonal
play-off victory over Italy.
The prospect of the Five Nations' sides competing against each other
in qualifying rounds is one which would cause commercial backers to
shudder.
The tournament organisers, who as yet have not said how the format
will operate, will have to give special consideration to this issue.
The 20-team format, with four more nations competing than in the
current tournament, has also led to fears of more mis-matches along the
lines of Ivory Coast v Scotland and Japan v New Zealand.
The proposed new qualification process has an almost absolute
potential for disaster, both for sponsors and in a playing sense.
For the first World Cup in 1987, the 16 competing nations did so at
the invitation of the organisers. In 1991, the eight quarter-finalists,
plus the host nation South Africa, were seeded to qualify automatically
for this year.
The remaining eight teams played through the qualifying tournaments in
four zones, Africa, Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe. Additionally,
for the less well recognised nations there were pre-qualification rounds
to even reach this stage.
Under the new plan only the finalists, the third-placed nation and
hosts Wales qualify automatically.
* SOUTH Africa hooker James Dalton yesterday lost his appeal against
his 30-day suspension for fighting in the match against Canada.
Dalton was one of three men sent off on Saturday, and now he joins
fellow Springbok Pieter Hendriks, who recieved a 90-day ban, on the
sidelines.

CAR-TIRED buyers might be intrigued by this unusual haven for horses;
hardly what you expect to find only nine miles from Glasgow's
traffic-packed city centre. But Easterton of Mugdock -- a modern country
mansion set among five acres of rolling hills -- and its adjoining
equestrian centre combine the rural idyll with a successful business.
The estate is on the market in five lots, or as a package. For more

A HOUSING strategy that would meet the shortfall in Scotland's housing
stock could create 33,000 new jobs, per year, according to the first
-ever detailed study into the connections between the property market
and the Scottish economy.
Published yesterdayTues 6 by the housing charity Shelter, Building
Scotland's Future examines the economic benefits to Scotland of a
building programme which could meet the needs of the nation by the year
2000.
''This is a really important document,'' says Tricia Marwick of
Shelter. ''Up until now the lack of information on the links between
Scotland's housing and the economy have prevented builders, lenders,
politicians and campaigns like Shelter from coalescing around the facts
about housing requirements in Scotland. This document presents the facts
for the first time.''
The report claims that creating those 33,000 new jobs per annum
through housing investment would save the Treasury some #297 million, as
workers paid tax and National Insurance and no longer required needed
benefits.
The report calls for a programme of housing investment to take
Scotland to the year 2000. Key aspects, which include what is currently
being done, include:
* Building 56,000 social rented homes;
* Returning 10,000 empty homes to use;
* Restoring repair grants expenditure to 1984 levels; and . . .
* Tackling dampness and disrepair in the public sector housing stock.
Shelter claims that the cost of such a programme would cost be some
#580 million per a year, or #2.9 billion by the end of the century. This
Such a cost represents some 2.5% of the Scottish Secretary's of State
for Scotland's current budget, but the programme of housing investment
would bring additional benefits, which would reduce the real net cost to
the public purse.
Eradicating dampness and disrepair could also provide many savings in
terms of health and social benefits.
The report was drawn up with the assistance of leading economists and
housing analysts from six universities, housing associations, the
Council of Mortgage Lenders, and private sector consultancies.
It argues that the case for a substantial increase in housing
investment in Scotland would provide a wide range of important economic
benefits -- from employment creation to ensuring a housing market that
suits the changing labour market.
While housing had a 9.4% share of Scotland's total public expenditure
in 1981, that share had fallen to 3.9% by 1992.
Although Scotland's average economic performance is better than many
other parts of the UK, the underlying reality is that incomes in
Scottish households are polarising and wages at the lower end are being
squeezed downwards. People in these income groups are finding housing
less affordable, even although they are in work. Based on figures from
the 1991 Census, the Shelter report calculates (conservatively) that
there is a shortfall of some 67,000 dwellings in Scotland. That
shortfall will be exacerbated by the number of new households being
created each year.
Forecasts by independent consultants Business Strategies Ltd suggest
that some 14,800 new households will be formed each year in Scotland
between now and the end of the century, some 74,000 in total to be added
to the 67,000.
The combined total of current need and projected need is 141,000 homes
-- or 28,200 new homes each year for the next five years. Where will
these homes come from? The private sector is currently building around
15,000 new homes in Scotland each year to meet current demand. Shelter
assumes that the responsibility for the remaining 13,200 needed will
have to be met by the low-cost social rented sector.
The Government has said that Scotland's owner-occupation level of 55%
should grow to match the 67% figure south of the border, but it is clear
that the lowest income groups are hardest hit by property market slumps
(some 2.5% of English home owners suffered repossession during the
slump, most of them on marginal incomes).
The Shelter programme would result in Scotland's home ownership
growing to a plateau of 60% by the end of the five-year period. The rest
of the housing requirements should be made up of a combination of social
rented sector and private rentals.
Tricia Marwick says: ''The private sector has a vital role to play in
Scotland's housing provision, but we're hoping to build a consensus
among builders, lenders, academics and others that owner-occupation
cannot meet everyone's housing needs.'' The document will provide the
basis for a high-powered housing seminar in October.
Bob Campbell, of the Scottish Building Employers' Federation, says he
does not agree with everything in the report. ''But my reservations are
subordinate to the overall need to initiate a debate and I believe that
this report achieves this objective.''
He is calling for a wide-ranging discussion with a view to evolving a
''sensible strategy for housing in Scotland which will also encourage
economic prosperity''.

Part-exchange is becoming popular with new home buyers, Robert McLeod
reports.
A CLEAR indication of the way in which part-exchange has become a
growing part of the Scottish new house purchase scene is provided by
Barratt.
''Our part-exchange department has had a fantastic year, surpassing
last year's turnover total,'' said Christine Hill, director of sales for
Barratt West Scotland.
''Our Oakleaf part-exchange scheme had a #10m turnover of established
homes last year. We first introduced the concept of part-exchange back
in 1971 and since then the scheme has gone from strength to strength as
more people opt for a speedy, frustration-free move.
''The houses part-exchanged came from a wide scatter of locations in
all sizes and values. Barratt's Oakleaf team purchased established homes
from buyers who were moving into new Barratt houses and sold them at
''prices well below current market values''. They bought and sold
properties ranging from modest flats at around #21,000 to top-range
family properties priced up to #147,000.
''We use independent specialist valuers to assess the properties
involved,'' said Christine Hill. ''This is done free of charge then we
give the owner our part-exchange value decision within seven days.''
The result declares Barratt, is that a customer moving into a new
Barratt home can have a speedy and problem-free move while saving
hundreds of pounds on advertising, estate agency and other selling
costs.
But Barratt also highlight the other side of the coin -- good news for
buyers seeking an established home at value for money prices. In the
past 12 months Barratt has offered Oakleaf Homes, already competitively
priced for a quick sale, with the bonus of a package of brand-new
furniture under their ''homestart'' scheme along with free surveys,
mortgage contributions, and legal and survey fees paid.
The extras list can include carpets, curtains, and fresh decor. White
goods including cookers and fridges may all be included in the Oakleaf
price.
''We have had some superb deals running on our Oakleaf homes in the
past year,'' said Christine Hill. ''All on our list offer increased
value for money, which is particularly important to first-time buyers.
This fact has been reflected in our sales.''
Barratt currently has 14 developments in Scotland, from Kirkcaldy,
Glenrothes and Perth in the east through Stirling, Cumbernauld and near
Linlithgow to Paisley, Clydebank and Largs. New Barratt developments
will be launched over the next few months at Stenhousemuir, Irvine,
Newmilns, and Gorebridge.
Buyers with a property to sell can choose between Barratt's Oakleaf
part-exchange scheme or can take advantage of another Barratt facility
-- their agency selling Service. The latter can also save the new
housebuyer considerable sums of money which might otherwise be spent on
advertising, estate agency fees and legal costs. The savings come as
part of a general package of incentives made available through the
expertise of the professionals involved.
''We are making it easier for people with property to sell to achieve
the move,'' said Christine Hill. ''What's available can remove a great
deal of the hassle associated with moving house -- and we can also offer
a rich package of incentives for first-time buyers.''

ROSS Aitken, who in his first pro season in 1991 won the Rookie of the
Year title, exhibited some of the reasons why at Letham Grange yesterday
to claim the lead after the first round of the Scottish Open Assistants'
Masters.
The Kilmarnock Barassie assistant shot a four-under-par 64 on the
5528-yard New Course -- short but with punishing rough -- to nose in
front of a group of five players, who ended their first round on 65.
The key to Aitken's success was to keep the ball on the straight and
narrow and he plundered five birdies, the only loss coming at the
396-yard ninth where he overshot the green.
''I led after the first round of the North of Scotland assistants
event at Inverness last month but fell away towards the end, so,
hopefully, I can learn from that, and not make the same mistakes here,''
he said.
Among 16 players who broke par yesterday was Hilton Park's Stewart
Russell, on 65. The 24-year-old was level after 14 holes, but he had a
birdie 3 at the fifteenth and a hole-in-one at the next, where his
No.8-iron shot pitched a foot from the cup and popped in. Leading
first-round scores:
64 -- R Aitken (Kilmarnock Barassie).
65 -- N McGill (King James VI), S Russell (Hilton Park), M King
(Pitreavie), G McFarlane (Clydebank &amp; District), G Jack (Kirriemuir).
66 -- P Wardell (Longniddry), J McKinnon (Braid Hills), M Hastie
(Turnberry Hotel), A Tait (Cawder).
67 -- C Sinclair (Blairgowrie), P Lovie (Inverurie), E McIntosh (Braid
Hills), A McKenna (Merrist Wood), D Herd (Alloa), M McEwan (Frome Golf
Centre).
68 -- A Purdie (Cardross), S Kennedy (Pitreavie), G Wheelaghan
(unattached), D Drysdale (Dunbar), D McCallum (Paisley).
* DEESIDE'S Peter Smith led his amateur team of Derek Fitch, Jim
Byers, and Bill Dryden to victory in the Lombard Invitational Pro-Am at
Cawder yesterday. Leading Stableford scores:
83pts -- Peter Smith (Deeside), B Fitch, J Byers, B Dryden. 80pts -- R
Weir (Cowal) P Crilley, M Sherrard, K Swindell. 78pts -- G Weir
(Braidhills) B Clark, A Ball, A Brown.

TIMBER frame is a well-established form of construction, dating as far
back as the twelfth century, but an increasing number of developers
throughout the world are becoming more aware of the benefits of this
traditional, environmentally friendly form of building.
Scotland has taken the lead with at least 50% of all new build houses
and 90% of self build houses created by this method, according to the
Scottish Consortium of Timber Frame Industries (SCOTFI). Timber frame is
also popular in North America and Scandanavia where it has to cope with
weather conditions even more severe than those in the UK.
The method complies with all required UK building regulations and is
more durable than the potential homebuyer, or home builder, may first
think. A recent report from the independent Building Research
Esablishment gave the method a clean bill of health following a survey
which lasted ten years.
There are Tudor houses, built from timber during the sixteenth
century, still in use today.
The major points in timber frame's favour are the speed of
construction and the level of sound and thermal performance. In
reasonable conditions a timber frame home can be wind and watertight in
two or three days and completed in just two months. Standard insulation
also gives an efficient use of fuel in the home and excellent noise
levels, but levels can easily be increased.
While this energy efficiency makes timber frame a ''green'' form of
building, the actual materials used in construction -- renewable
softwoods and CFC-free insulation -- help to add to the planet-friendly
profile.
The choice of design in a timber frame home is also a plus point for
developers or self builders who are looking to construct something a bit
different, and while the components are strong, they are relatively
lightweight and can be transported to remote plots or those which are
difficult to reach. That's also why it is so popular with self-build and
small developments.
How does the method work? And how can it be so durable? The simple
explanation is in the name. The building relies on a timber frame as its
basic means of structural support. The frame is stiffened by sheathing
material, giving it the strength to withstand lateral loads and to
support multi-storey and widespan structures. Timber frame can now be
built to five storeys.
The frame itself is factory manufactured to give the highest possible
levels of accuracy and quality. When it comes to putting the building
up, the frame is covered by plasterboard internally and filled with
non-combustible insulation material. Barriers to keep out moisture and
vapour are also incorporated at this stage.
On the outside wall, the finish can be stone, brick, roughcast or even
timber. A structural timber frame along with internal load-bearing
timber wall panels and party wall frames support the roof, also made
from timber.
It is this simplicity of construction which attracts both
housebuilders and those adventurous enough to consider building their
own home. Timber frame houses range from one-storey bungalows to flats
in several storeys. According to SCOTFI, the accuracy that goes into
manufacture, along with the easy to erect procedure even reduces the
need for special on-site skills.
The organisation also assures potential self-builders put off by
financial hurdles that timber frame construction is recognised by
financial institutions and building societies for lending.

One of Scotland's top chefs has entered in partnership to open a
restaurant in Glasgow bringing haute cuisine to a public at a
competitive price, Bill McLean reports
YES, the recently opened restaurant, bar, and brasserie at 22 West
Nile Street is the most positive quality eating-out spot to appear on
the Glasgow scene for years. This joint venture by top chef Ferrier
Richardson and commercial caterer Frank Bell of CCG Services is already
packing them in because of its policy of providing good food at
affordable prices in stylish surroundings. Haute cuisine has never been
so accessible in the heart of the city and dining deluxe has become a
reality for many.
Ferrier Richardson is probably best known for his innovative
restaurant October, alas no more, which attracted good food fanciers in
their droves across the Glasgow boundary to Bearsden. Trained at the
Glasgow College of Food Technology and shaped in the classic BTH
kitchens of the Central Hotel, he went on to make a name for himself in
London's Ma Cuisine where he evinced a passion for Japanese cookery
which shows in the east meets west philosophy adapted for his dishes.
As the manager of the Scottish Culinary Olympic Team he has collected
gold medals in competitions in Frankfurt and Singapore and is a founder
member of the Scottish Chefs Association. His recipes in chapter 10 of
The Flavour of Scotland -- an anthology of the best of contemporary
Scottish cooking -- #14.99, Mainstream, have helped to make it a cookery
book bestseller.
From the outside Yes has a distinctly transatlantic look enhanced by a
long blue and gold sign and attractive blinds which would not look out
of place in an upmarket restaurant in New York. The split- level bar on
the ground floor has high poseur tables for eating in comfort and the
raised lounge area makes a feature of painted panels in the manner of
Picasso's Spanish civil war protest Guernica. Colourful Juan Miro prints
are much in evidence and the large bar and brasserie menu has an
impressive range of starters, sandwiches, pasta platters, main courses
and desserts. Deep fried Camembert with a curried pear chutney, #2.45,
is an intriguing starter and the espresso coffee at 95p is highly
recommended.
The Weddell and Thomson architectural partnership must be credited
with another stylish Glasgow restaurant interior which captures
perfectly the optimistic spirit of the age. Designer Elaine McBride has
been given full creative rein and the restaurant downstairs is a
tasteful triumph.
Yes -- the restaurant -- has been constructed on three different
levels, the bar and private dining room, pre-dinner drinks area, and
main restaurant plus a raised area with hardwood floor which can also be
used for small private parties.
The principal colours are bold cobalt blue, strong cerise red, and
ivory. Limited edition coloured prints, bevelled mirrors and Scottish
Colourist inspired paintings by Stuart Vernon grace the walls, and from
Wednesday to Saturday light jazz is played on a grand piano, controlled
down-lighters add to the atmosphere and crisp white linen tablecloths
and napkins add a traditional touch.
Luxurious booths around the walls ensure discreet dining and comfort
and central tables with banquet seating are ideal for intimate business
lunching.
The private dining room can seat eight to 18 in comfort, with special
menus prepared on request, has been nicknamed the Main dining room by
some witty patrons because the oil paintings on its walls are by Glasgow
artist Leslie Main. It can also be hired for board meetings and is very
popular with the business community. A built-in glazed wall cabinet
displaying contemporary glassware also serves as a window on to the
enthusiastic dining world outside. Music in all parts is played softly
on CDs and cool sounds West Coast jazz and the velvet tones of Ella
Fitzgerald can be heard.
Ferrier Richardson is executive chef/patron, brother Simon is in
charge front of house and Derek Blair is chef de cuisine. The attractive
and attentive serving staff are dressed in white and the wine waiter is
extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Designer Italian cutlery sits well
beside the bottles of Greek virgin olive oil on every table instead of
butter for the bread. And what bread. It comes hot in a basket. Try the
sun-dried tomato or garlic bread with a spot of olive oil in its
individual dish. You're certain to ask for more.
Lunch is served from noon until last orders at 2pm. Dinner is served
from 7pm until last orders at 11pm. The lunch menu changes every
Wednesday and is a bargain two courses with coffee for #9.95 or three
courses with coffee, #12.95. For dinner, two courses and coffee is
#17.95, three courses and coffee is #22.50, and there is a specially
selected eclectic surprise menu for #24.95. The world-wide wine list has
been painstakingly compiled by Fraser Alexander and contains many honest
and keenly priced bottles.
On my Thursday visit I was impressed by the steady flow of customers.
Yes has been opened for only four weeks and its well deserved food and
value reputation has quickly got around. The dining room is airy and
spacious and the light and sound levels are well controlled. The dinner
menu was a delight to read with such starters as Salmon Carpaccio,
Orange Mixed Pepper and Balsamic dressing sharing the page with gateau
of haggis neeps and tatties with whisky butter sauce and hot and sour
Sichuan soup.
I ordered a half bottle of lightly chilled Sancerre 1993, Les
Baronnes, Domaine Henri and Bourgeois #10.25, from Chavignol. My starter
was a prawn and Gruyeren souffle with freshly made lemon Hollandaise
sauce. The main course was roast salmon with cracked pepper and ginger
Bok Choy spring onions and saffron potatoes.
The souffle was delicately fluffy and light as air, the prawns Gruyere
and Hollandaise sauce combining in a stunning mixture of flavours. The
cracked pepper and ginger gave the roast salmon a tangy lift while the
Bok Choy spring onions and saffron potatoes were perfect subtle
accompaniments. The Sancerre was a fine example of its class.
Discreet dining and comfort are assured in the stylish restaurant
The exterior of the restaurant has shades of Manhattan

STEPHEN Gallacher of Bathgate, many people's tournament favourite,
missed the cut at Hoylake last night when South African Bradley Davidson
chipped in at the final hole for a birdie and a 149 two-round total.
That finale, in the third-last qualifying group, was enough to end
Gallacher's interest. He produced a fine sand save on the same hole to
complete a seven-over-par 79, but he drove erratically and missed the
cut by a single stroke.
Scottish Amateur champion Hugh McKibbin negotiated the Wallasey course
in a two-over-par 74 in the final strokeplay round, for a
two-round-total of 147 to make the last 64. Bagging two birdies across
the shorter course, he struggled on ''difficult to read'' greens.
Pinner Hill's Gary Clarke was the only player to break par in both
strokeplay rounds. The 24-year-old West of England champion posted five
birdies in his two under-par round of 70 to lead on an outstanding total
of 139.
One ahead of McKibbin was first-round leader David Downie. The
Ladybank golfer followed up on his course-record equalling 68 at
Wallasey with a nonchalant six-over-par 78 at the harder former Open
Championship venue in tame early conditions.
Tied on that two-round aggregate was Wick's Roger Beames, the newly
awarded youth cap who posted a three-under-par 69 across Wallasey.
Gordon Sherry -- the beaten finalist last season -- picked up four
birdies in a round of 70 across the Wallasey course despite ''playing
terribly''. He headed for the practice ground last night after
consulting coach Bob Torrance.
Mortonhall's David Patrick, a golf scholar in America at Charlestown
University, South Carolina, stormed to a course-record equalling 68 at
Wallasey. Leading qualifiers:
139 -- G Clarke (Pinner Hill) 70, 69.
142 -- Y Taylor (Brynhill) 72, 70; L James (Broadstone) 72, 70.

SCOTTISH Amicable, one of Scotland's biggest life insurance companies,
yesterday rejected a suggestion that it was hiving off its fund
management arm as a first step toward ending its mutual status, writes
ROBERT POWELL.
But Scottish Amicable conceded that recent moves to give its fund
management subsidiary greater autonomy could lead to key executives
being offered a minority stake in the venture.
As a mutual life office Scottish Amicable is owned by its policy
holders and all profits made revert fully to their benefit.
None are siphoned off as dividends to independent shareholders.
Michael Bell, a Scottish lawyer based in Devon, questioned the motives
of Scottish Amicable in setting up its subsidiary Scottish Amicable
Investment Managers as an autonomous profit centre.
Mr Bell is chairman of Solicitors Financial Services, an organisation
that represents about 100 lawyers who do financial business in Scotland.
He said in a statement that any move by Scottish Amicable to hive off
its fund management subsidiary would be like ''selling off the family
silver''.
But Graeme Knox, the managing director of Scottish Amicable Investment
Managers, strongly denied any intention by Scottish Amicable to end its
mutual status or dispose of its fund management subsidiary.
Recent changes that have given Scottish Amicable Investment Managers
more autonomy are purely aimed at making the firm more efficient at
managing the #12bn of funds under its control, he said.
''It has nothing to do with demutualisation. The company is ultimately
owned and operated by Scottish Amicable,'' Mr Knox said, noting that
two-thirds of the funds under management are owned by Scottish Amicable
with profits policy holders.
Mr Knox said Scottish Amicable Investment Managers had been managing
external funds for the last 20 years and by operating with greater
autonomy the firm could achieve a better return on investment.
''We are doing this for the benefit of the policyholders,'' he said.
On May 1 Scottish Amicable announced that its fund management
subsidiary was moving to new offices in Glasgow, separate from those of
the parent company and that henceforth it would be ''resourced and
operated independently.''
Bernard Solomons, the chairman of Allied Provincial Securities, became
chairman of Scottish Investment Managers in place of Scottish Amicable
group managing director Roy Nicholson and the company launched a drive
to boost the volume of external funds under management.
Scottish Amicable said then that key employees of the fund management
company would be encouraged to own shares in it, but Mr Knox said this
would only amount to a small minority stake.
''It remains controlled by Scottish Amicable because they own all the
shares of the company and will certainly continue to own more than 90%
for some time to come,'' Mr Knox said.

SCOTTISH No.1 Senga Macfie has turned to a sports psychologist for
help at the start of an important run of tournaments that will reach a
climax with the women's World Open in Hong Kong at the end of this
month.
The first test of her mental toughness will come this weekend, when
she lines up as favourite in the fiftieth anniversary Greek Open in
Athens. Her younger sister, Helen, is defending champion.
Senga, the world No.18, is famous for lack of organisation -- she has
often arrived at tournaments with just one racket, or minus a skirt --
but she is hoping the sessions will be a turning point.
However, she doesn't sound totally convinced.
''He has stressed the importance of positive thinking, and of staying
relaxed,'' said the London-based 26-year-old who led Scotland to a
bronze medal at the European championships in Amsterdam in April. ''I
think it could work.
''I've also been putting in a lot of training with my coach, Ian
McKenzie, over the past few weeks, but Greece is the first event since
the European championships.''
Unfortunately, she has been given tough draws for both the World Open
and the warm-up event, the Malaysian Open, in 10 days' time, where she
will open against volatile Australian world No.12, Vicki Cardwell, a
match that she predicts ''will be an absolute nightmare.''
At the World Open, from June 27 to July 2, she meets the English No.2
seed, Suzanne Horner, in the first round.
However, she can look back with confidence to a career-best win over
the then world No.2, Liz Irving, in Hong Kong last year.
* WORLD champion Jansher Khan cruised into the quarter-finals of the

ANDRE Agassi's plan to complete his Grand Slam collection with the
French Open title ended in abject failure yesterday when he was knocked
out of the tournament by unfancied Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov in less
than two hours.
The American world No.1's play was often as ragged as his
street-urchin attire in a 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 quarter-final upset.
But on paper, there should have been no contest.
Agassi, holder of the American and Australian Open titles, had looked
at his formidable best, not dropping a set in his four previous rounds.
The Russian, much feared for the power of his shots during his rise on
the circuit over the past couple of years, had fallen away badly of late
with a succession of poor results which boded ill for his hopes.
''I'm surprised with myself,'' Kafelnikov said. ''I never thought I
could beat Agassi here. I came expecting nothing.''
But the American, treated for a thigh injury during the first set,
found no answer to the accuracy and consistency of Kafelnikov's baseline
strokes as he became the last of the top four men's seeds to exit the
Paris tournament.
Agassi said he had suffered a hip injury early in the first set and
had not been able to move properly for the rest of the match.
''I had a very sharp, excruciating pain when I pushed on it,'' he
said. ''I couldn't move well on the right and I couldn't go well for the
serve.''
The American said he had thought about giving up in the second set.''I
wouldn't have risked further injury except in a Grand Slam,'' he said.
''But do you walk off court or do you stay out there?
''You come here to play well and to give everything. For it to end
like this is extremely disappointing. To be beaten is not difficult, but
to go out like that when you don't even have a shot at it, well, I don't
know what to say.''
Agassi had said after winning the Australian Open that he felt he had
a good chance of becoming the first player since Rod Laver to win all
four Grand Slam events in his career.
But like Pete Sampras, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, all out of the
tournament already after chasing the same landmark in Paris, it was not
to be.
Agassi, whose pounding baseline game makes him a natural favourite at
Roland Garros, has curiously won Wimbledon, the American and Australian
Opens without capturing the French clay-court title that seemed his for
the taking.
Austrian Thomas Muster, seeded five, almost joined them in what would
have been another major reverse, being forced to come back from 2-1 down
in sets before beating Spaniard Alberto Costa 6-2, 3-6, 6-7, 7-5, 6-2.
Muster, who extended his run to 33 consecutive wins on clay, now meets
Kafelnikov for a place in the final.
The other quarter-finals, which match Michael Chang with Romanian
qualifier Adrian Voinea and defending champion Sergi Bruguera with
Italian Renzo Furlan, will be played today.
There were no upsets in the women's quarter-finals with Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, Conchita Martinez and Steffi Graf being joined in the
semi-finals by Kimiko Date, the first Japanese to go so far in Paris.
German second seed Graf, who had a devastating 6-1, 6-0 win over
Argentina's Gabriela Sabatini, may be all that stands in the way of an
all-Spanish final when she meets Martinez in the last four tomorrow.
Defending champion Sanchez Vicario should prove too strong for Date in
the other match, though the Japanese player did well to come back from
5-2 down in the first set before trouncing Croatia's Iva Majoli 7-5 6-1.
* MONICA Seles, who has not played a competitive match since being
stabbed during a tournament in Germany more than two years ago, will
return to tennis for an exhibition match against Martina Navratilova on
July 29.
Seles is already due to appear at the Special Olympics World Games at
New Haven, Connecticut, on July 8, when she will conduct a clinic, but
she has yet to say whether she will compete in any WTA Tour events.
A venue for the match between Seles and Navratilova, who retired from
the Tour last November, has yet to be announced.

The colt is in great shape after his exertions in France and should he

INDOOR tennis courts in Scotland are no new innovation, we had them in
Edinburgh more than 100 years ago, as DOUG GILLON discovered in a book
which has just been published by the SLTA to celebrate its centenary.
TENNIS in Scotland has come full circle in 100 years, finally grasping
what was already apparent in 1878 -- namely that indoor courts are more
practical in our climate.
The Indoor Tennis Initiative, launched in recent years by the Lawn
Tennis Association to revive the sport in Britain -- and which has just
helped fund the new #3m national centre at Craiglockhart -- is merely a
revival of facilities which Edinburgh enjoyed more than a century ago.
Indeed, the first six Scottish championships (1878-83) were played
indoors, in what was known as the ''Tin Temple'' beside Edinburgh's
Grange cricket ground.
It housed two wooden-floored courts, end to end, with a curtain
between, was lit only by side windows, and had six rows of seats in a
tiered spectator gallery.
As there was just a three-foot gap between the sidelines and walls, a
rule was introduced permitting players to hit the ball as it came off
the wall, provided it had not bounced for a second time.
This is just one fascinating illumination of times past provided in
the Scottish LTA centenary book* launched last night in Edinburgh.
Author George Robertson warns: ''No longer will the barest of
facilities be accepted. The potential member will look elsewhere . . .
clubs that do not recognise this, and do not provide high-quality
facilities to set alongside good floodlit courts, may not still be
operating by the turn of the century.''
David Lloyd, the former Davis Cup player, is a millionaire thanks to
his early recognition of changing tastes which led to his launching a
string of quality facilities throughout the UK.
''If tennis is to have a healthy future . . . we must provide keen
players with the opportunity to play all year round, regardless of
weather conditions,'' said Lloyd. ''Scotland's climate is the harshest
in the British Isles, and will benefit proportionately more from indoor
facilities.''
The Tin Temple, demolished in 1902, housed the world's second-oldest
tournament after Wimbledon. But the Scottish moved outdoors because of
the advent of an early power player, JG Horn.
Winner of the Scottish title from 1881-83, he was inaugural president
of the SLTA, formed on June 11, 1895.
Horn possessed a smash service, and could smash overhead right from
the back of the court. Lobs, designed to thwart his volley, touched the
temple roof, with consequent forfeiture of the point. And so the
championship moved outdoors, to Moffat.
Wimbledon stars were regular early visitors, but few will lament the
passing of some early traditions. What John McEnroe would have made of
brass bands playing during tournaments is perhaps all too predictable.
Reference is made to the 1888 West of Scotland Championships: ''There
was only one weak spot in the whole proceedings of Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday, and that was the band. To those who did not hear it, no
description could do the subject justice, while to those who did, no
description is necessary!''
The cost of hiring a band could amount to half the groundsman's annual
wage. The practice ended when a competitor drove a ball through the big
drum.

Japan 0, Brazil 3
THE remarkable pulling power of world champions Brazil was clearly
evident last night on Merseyside when 3000 fans were locked out.
Police advised that the gates of Everton's Goodison Park ground be
closed for safety reasons after the kick-off was delayed by 15 minutes.
Nearly 30,000 fans braved the incessant rain to see this Umbro Cup
match -- 8000 more than attended England's game with Japan on Saturday.
Brazil did not disappoint, either, showing a full range of skills.
Zinho, who plays in the J-League for Yokohama Flugels, led the way with
two goals. Roberto Carlos, from Brazilian champions Palmeiras, got the
other.
Carlos opened the scoring with a delightful goal when he fooled
Kazuaki Tasaka before drilling a low shot passed keeper Nobuyuki Kojima.
Edmundo then ran from the centre circle, beating four players, only to
see his shot come back off the underside of the bar. Juninho smacked a
post with a free kick and there was no respite after the interval.
Masami Ihari headed away a corner from Juninho but only as far as
Zinho, who let fly with a spectacular volley. Zinho capped a marvellous
individual display when he got on the end of Edmundo's pass to score the
third.
* ENGLAND manager Terry Venables, under fire for his side's poor
showing in the 2-1 win over against Japan, looks set to bring in
Newcastle's new #4m right back, Warren Barton, and first-choice left
back Graeme Le Saux for tonight's Umbro Cup match against Sweden.
Spurs' Teddy Sheringham is poised to take over from the disappointing
Stan Collymore, while Paul Gascoigne is unlikely to be on for a whole 90
minutes.
Spurs winger Darren Anderton, who scored the first goal against Japan,
is doubtful with a ''tweaked'' knee.
ENGLAND -- (possible) Flowers (Blackburn), Barton (Newcastle), Le
Saux, Batty (both Blackburn), Unsworth (Everton), Scales (Liverpool),
Platt (Sampdoria), Barmby (Tottenham), Shearer (Blackburn), Sheringham
(Tottenham), McManaman (Liverpool).
* HAMILTON, in an effort to attract more youngsters to games, are
introducing a season ticket for under-14s, who will be able to attend
all of Hamilton's home league matches next season for only #25.

AMERICA'S World Boxing Association light-heavyweight champion Virgil
Hill will complete the trio of world title fights on the Don King-Frank
Warren Wembley Stadium fight spectacular on July 22.
The long-established Hill will defend his crown against South Africa's
Gary Ballard on the #20m-plus Frank Bruno-Nigel Benn bill, his
nineteenth defence of the title in two reigns, interrupted by his sole
career loss to the great Tommy Hearns.
Hill had 11 successful defences until Hearns dethroned him in June,
1991, but regained his crown in 1993 by beating Frank Tate and has won
seven title fights in succession since then, the last on points against
British champion Crawford Ashley in Stateline, Nevada, in April, when he
damaged a hand.
Ballard is no stranger to British rings. He beat Gateshead's Ian Henry
in four rounds on the Michael Bentt-Herbie Hide World Boxing
Organisation heavyweight title promotion at Millwall in March last year.
Hill's date replaces the WBA heavyweight title rematch between Bruce
Seldon and Tony Tucker, which is now favoured to appear on Mike Tyson's
big comeback night in Las Vegas on August 19.
Bruno will have his fourth shot at a world title against WBO holder
Oliver McCall, while Benn will defend his World Boxing Council
super-middleweight championship for the eighth time against a challenger
yet to be named.
* MARK Delaney, of West Ham, has been forced to pull out of next
Tuesday's WBO Continental super-middleweight title fight against
Welshman Darron Griffiths at the Festival Hall, Basildon.
Delaney has a back injury, but promoter Barry Hearn will now top the
show with another WBO Continental title contest.
Crawley super-bantam Michael Alldis will move up from the undercard to
head Hearn's bill against Laureano Ramirez, of the Dominican Republic, a
recent victim of Prince Naseem Hamed.

SCOTTISH champion Bruce Flockhart is planning a trip to the Far East
for some extra practice instead of taking a summer break after
successful performances at the world championships in Switzerland last
month.
Despite a long and tiring season, the Scottish No.1 has organised a
three-week excursion to Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore to train and
take part in competitions there, where standards are of the highest
calibre.
Not content with that, he also will take part in the American and
Canadian Open championships in August along with fellow-Scot Anne
Gibson.
''I hope to get through a few rounds if I get decent draws,'' said
Flockhart, who will be travelling East with the English team, although
he is paying his own way with help from the Scottish Badminton Union,
Stirling University, and the British Olympic fund.
''I've been to the Far East before, when I was 17, but I will
appreciate it more now. The aim of the trip is to get as much experience
as possible,'' he added.
Olympic squad member Gibson will have extra reason to play well at the
American Open as the tournament will be held in Atlanta, the site of the
1996 Olympics.
Serving as a warm-up event for next year, the competition will provide
an invaluable opportunity for a sneak preview of the facilities.

THAMES Water is not paying any rebates to customers and has no plans
for a share buy-back unlike Anglian Water, despite increasing its annual
profits by 26% to #304m. This upset the City which marked its shares
down 8p to 500p.
However, in its defence Thames has always had the lowest combined
domestic water and sewerage bills of the privatised water companies of
England and Wales, currently at #172 or roughly 50p per day. It intends
to maintain this position into the next century envisaging just a #10
increase during the next five years.
On the subject of the share buy-back, finance director David Luffrum
said that the board had unanimously decided that proving real growth in
dividends in the long term was a better route to take than making a
one-off large special dividend. Last year, the dividend was increased by
12.4% to 25.3p after a final shareholders' payment of 17.1p a share. The
scrip dividend alternative remains available.

FORMER England manager Bobby Robson looks set to disappoint Arsenal by

has told the president of champions FC Porto that he will honour his
contract, which still has two years to run.
''There is no possibility of Robson going to Arsenal,'' Porto
president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa said.
Porto have threatened to report Arsenal to UEFA and FIFA, claiming the
north London club have made an illegal approach to Robson.
Arsenal, seeking a big-name replacement for sacked George Graham, may

ROBERTO Baggio looks certain to leave Italian champions Juventus in
the summer -- but any interested British clubs are likely to be
disappointed. Tottenham and Queen's Park Rangers have both been linked
with the Italian, but Baggio will either stay at home or move to Japan.
''I've been in contact with a number of clubs, both in Italy and
abroad,'' said the former European Footballer of the Year. ''I realise
now that Juventus don't want to keep me. I sensed the way the wind was
blowing and felt I needed to act.''
Baggio's contract with Juventus expires at the end of this month and
he has not been able to agree a new deal with the club, having been
asked to take a big cut in salary.
Baggio would probably cost around #5m and Inter-Milan look favourites
to land him, but his Italy team-mate, Dino Baggio, who moved from
Juventus to Parma last summer, has been encouraging Parma directors to
step in. AC Milan, Roma, Spanish champions Real Madrid and Barcelona,
plus a number of Japanese clubs, are also believed to be interested.

Rome's Olympic stadium tomorrow.
Christie, who began his outdoor season with a disappointing fifth

the Namibian world champion again over the same distance. But he is the
top man over 100m and will avoid highly rated American Dennis Mitchell

Two 100m sprints will be staged, allowing Mitchell, a world and

EDINBURGH Income Trust yesterday reported another gloomy performance
and warned that a switch of investments into high-growth companies was
likely to cut income further this year.
The split capital trust aims to provide capital growth for its zero
dividend preference shareholders as well as capital growth and income
for its ordinary shareholders.
But Edinburgh Fund Managers, who manage the fund, said it was
struggling to meet both targets.
Total assets fell 4.7% to #14.2m during the year to April 30, compared
with a fall of only 0.1% in the Financial Times All-Share Index over the
same period.
But after provisions for repaying preference shares when the trust
comes up for liquidation in 2000, the net asset value showed a 21.4%
fall to 39.8p per share.
The trust has suffered a steady decline in assets since it was started
up four years ago, but Edinburgh Fund Managers said it was trying to
reverse the trend by shifting from high-yielding into high-growth
shares.
It warned, however, that this strategy would probably lead to a
further 15% fall in revenue this year, aggravating a 5.6% decline to
#942,000 in the financial year just ended.
The trust held its full-year dividend at 4.0p, which was only just
covered by a decline in earnings per share to 4.11p from 4.59p.
Edinburgh Fund Managers said it would have to dip into the trust's
reserves to prevent a cut in the dividend next year.

THE Rugby World Cup authorities have attempted to defend what is seen
in many quarters as the indefensible, whereby teams with players sent
off or cited for foul play can maintain the 26-strong squad so long as
they do so at their own expense.
Yesterday, Chester Williams, the black Springbok winger who was
sidelined at the start of the tournament because of an injury, was
brought back into the Springbok squad in place of Pieter Hendriks, who
was banned for 90 days for his part in the brawl against Canada.
The South African decision to recall Williams, so long as his living
costs for the remainder of the tournament are met by the SARFU and not
RWC, is perfectly legitimate within the rules of the competition but
runs contrary to the organisers' stated position that responsibility for
player discipline lies not only with the player but with their unions.
The fact that teams which have been guilty of foul play can remain
unpunished flies in the face of the RWC demand for collective
responsibility.
Yesterday, at a news conference in Johannesburg, RWC chairman Sir
Ewart Bell was asked whether a more ethical response would have been to
limit replacement players to positions, like the front row, where there
would be a danger element if such players were not replaced.
Employing the Sir Humphrey Appleton skills garnered during his years
as an Irish diplomat, Sir Ewart replied: ''I note what you say with
interest. There are various combinations that one could apply. One has
to recognise that there is a certain degree of flexibility within the
squad and players can play in different positions, therefore if you
devise some system for specific players then that may not apply in any
specific situation.
''However, it is a fact that elsewhere in the rules of the tournament
there could be sanctions on a team that had a player sent off. If, for
example, there was a draw or equal points at the top of a pool, then
then there are a series of determinants to decide who has won the game,
and that series of determinants includes a penalty if you have had
players sent off in the tournament.
''So what I am saying is that we do recognise the point that is being
made but the organisers' feeling is that it would be very difficult to
cover in a very precise form what is being recommended, because players
often are capable of playing in different positions.
He added: ''At the end of the day we came to the conclusion that
administration gets detailed enough and that the team should be allowed
to replace a player sent off, but at their own expense, and that is what
we have done.''
* MAX Brito, the Ivory Coast winger paralysed from the neck down in
the match against Tonga last week, is still seriously ill in a Pretoria
hospital. He is undergoing surgery to stabilise his cervical spine.
* SCOTLAND'S Jim Fleming is one of four officials selected from the
original 22 to officiate in the quarter-finals. Fleming will referee the
South Africa v Western Samoa match. The referee for Scotland's
quarter-final game against New Zealand is Derek Bevan of Wales.

THERE is rarely an occasion when a Scotland manager is able to move
into an important game without a problem. Here in the Faroe Islands,
Craig Brown had expected to be trouble-free after already having been to
forced to select a depleted squad for this European championship clash.
After all, he was without 14 players who would almost certainly have
been in his squad. But just as he thought he had left his troubles at
home, Brown discovered that Brian Martin, the Motherwell defender, was
doubtful.
Martin, who won his two caps in Japan, had to pull out of the second
workout of the day at the Toftir Stadium, where the game will be played.
He has a calf injury which he has carried through much of the season,
but it troubled him again yesterday and Brown may not wish to gamble on
his fitness when so much is at stake.
The defender, of course, is the one player who is experienced playing
competitively on these islands. He did so with Motherwell in the UEFA
Cup and while he can pass on his knowledge to the rest of the players,
there is now no certainty that he will play alongside them.
Said Brown: ''We will give him until tomorrow morning to make sure
that he is okay. We have brought the best possible equipment with us to
provide treatment, and he will have extra treatment between now and
tomorrow morning.
''We don't want to disturb what was a successful defensive set-up in
Japan.
''He played there alongside Colin Calderwood and Alan McLaren, and
they were comfortable together. It would be good for us if they could
continue the understanding they worked on over there.''
However, in his squad, he has cover for this contingency. Stewart
McKimmie could move in to a sweeper role, with McLaren and Calderwood as
markers, and young Craig Burley, happily free of injury, could go into
the right-back slot.
Brown, of course, will stand by the formation he believes is best for
Scotland. He will have three central defenders, with the full backs
pushing forward to make it a five-man midfield.
Early in the game he will deploy Darren Jackson in a wide position --
and then move him to play just behind the two main strikers, Duncan
Shearer and John McGinlay.
He hopes to fox the Faroese by pushing Jackson wide to begin with. By
his reasoning, they will then find it difficult to regroup, and to
change the tactics which will have been rigidly set down by their Danish
coach, Alan Simonsen.
The players seem confident and, even in these laid-back surroundings,
they appear to have an edge to their approach.
Rangers defender Alan McLaren for instance said: ''It still annoys me
that they scored a goal at Hampden. I know that it doesn't count as
regards qualification, but we should not have let them score -- and I
don't want to let them score here.
''What we want to do is to win the game, and then set things up for
the match against Greece at Hampden. Then, maybe, the fans will come
back to support us. That is what we want.''
Brown has impressed on the players that he wants a positive attitude,
and, eventually a positive result.
He pointed out: ''We have done well in our away games so far, and we
want that to continue. If we get a victory then we know that we have
three home games waiting for us and that could be the perfect way to
finish.
''The players know what is at stake. They all desperately want to be
in the European Finals in England next summer.''
Victory here can give Brown's men a powerful push towards that target.
Yes, they would still have to win their home games, but surely that is
what any country would want to have on a run-in to possible
qualification. Three home games -- think of that -- and then look
forward to booking your tickets for the finals.

Ross Finlay is glad to tell a new Saab story
SAAB sales in this country are up by a fifth compared with the figure
for the early part of last year, and one reason for that is the
introduction of an entry-level model at under #14,000. With good
passenger space, as the occupants sit quite upright, an enormous boot
capacity, and a strong technical specification, the three-door 900 2.0i
shares many of the features of the more expensive cars in the range, at
its showroom price of #13,995.
Since half of it was sold to General Motors, Saab's automotive
business has a definite Swedish-American feel. The cars are still
clearly Swedish designs, but American management techniques, with some
painful plant closures, plus the ability to buy in materials and
equipment at substantially reduced cost from GM's vast worldwide
suppliers' network, have made the company more competitive and put its
once parlous financial situation back into profit.
All 900s have anti-lock brakes and pollen-filtered ventilation
systems, and their bodyshells are among the most robust built anywhere
in the world motor industry. However, for safety and easy-repair
reasons, they include a number of deliberate crumple zones.
From the base-model 900 at #13,995 the range rises through various
trim, equipment, body and engine options -- including a 2.3-litre unit,
two-litre turbos and a V6 -- to the top priced convertible at #28,195.
All are better equipped, at standard prices, than their German rivals.
Saab has now brought its Sensonic transmission to the UK market, as an
option on all turbo models and available in the limited-import Sensonic
Special at #20,995. While a traditional automatic gearbox in a 900 costs
#1000, Sensonic is an automatic clutch at #250 less, and has much more
appeal to the keen driver.
Using the kind of electronic sensors and micro processors fitted to
blank-cheque Grand Prix applications, although with quality control to
Saab's fighter-plane standards, a Sensonic-equipped car has the usual
throttle and brake pedals, but no clutch pedal. There is none of the
usual automatic-transmission annoyance of the box changing up or down
against the driver's inclinations. The Saab uses a conventional gear
lever controlling five forward gears.
There is none of the mechanical drag which makes full automatic
transmissions so much less effective than manual boxes. On the other
hand, there is no ''creep'', something to be borne in mind when the car
will not hold itself on a slight up-gradient as conventional automatics
do.
The well-equipped Sensonic Special has a full 185bhp two-litre turbo
engine. This will slingshot the car to 60mph in eight seconds, give it
tremendous mid-range grunt, and fade out at a test track speed
approaching 143mph. Steady-speed fuel consumption returns are about
44mpg at 56mph and 34 at 75, but do not be naive enough to look for
similar figures if you continually let the acceleration rip.
Drivers quickly learn that the Sensonic system reacts best to precise
and quite gentle treatment, although it will allow a certain amount of
part-throttle opening through a gear change. It seems to be well aware
of exactly what the driver is doing. For instance, if you lumber along
in an excessively high gear, there is a discrete chime and the trip
computer display advises you to shift down.
If you bring the car to a stop, keep it in gear as it will accept, and
put your foot on the brake pedal, the system will assume that you are
waiting to move off again shortly, and will lie doggo. But if, in the
same situation, you apply the handbrake, it will assume you propose to
halt for a longer time, and gives the equivalent of a discrete cough
before showing ''disengage gear''. I can see this system leading to
better driving from the people who buy Sensonic-equipped cars, because
it is highly embarrassing to be ticked off by an electronic Jeeves.

SO many international players are expected to stay on after the World
Cup to enjoy those great traditions of South African provincial rugby --
sun, fun and plenty of money -- that calls have been made for a quota
system to limit the number of players that can play in the Currie Cup.
As we revealed last week, Western Province pays its top players up to
#800 per week to play rugby and promote the game in the region.
Other provinces have similar arrangements where the best players
receive win bonuses, sponsored cars, and other cash incentives.
It is understood that Frenchmen Phillipe Sella, Laurent Cabannes, and
Fabian Galthie are all due to play in Western Province, as is Welshman
Robert Jones. Italian prop Massimo Cuttitta is to play for Natal next
week following his country's exit from the tournament, Welshman Neil
Jenkins is joining Northern Transvaal, and several English players are
said to be staying on in Natal after the close of the tournament.
''We knew there would be a flood of players,'' said Western Province
president Ronnie Masson. ''I have always felt that there should be an
enforced limit on the number of foreign players in our top-grade
tournament.
''I think, as does my union, that there should be a ceiling of two or
three per province. However, that has to be the same for all of us.''
Ed Griffiths, the man who has the dual and sometimes hard-to-fathom
role in South Africa of media liaison officer with his country's team
and chief executive of SARFU, said that it was entirely up to each union
to do what they felt was correct.
''It's not for us to tell each union what to do,'' he said. ''They
have to make their own policy. Foreign players are entitled to play here
as long as they get clearance from their own union back home as well.''
That approach has left many in South Africa dissatisfied at the lack
of action taken by SARFU over the very same sort of situation that made
England introduce laws to decrease the number of foreign players in
their domestic set-up.
''We have approached SARFU over this matter, formally proposing a
limit,'' said Masson.
''But they have refused to do anything about it. I do not agree with
that way of thinking and I am very unhappy about it, despite the fact
that, on the face of it, their decision is final.
''We will have to change it soon or our local boys will not get a
chance. We always knew that there would be a flood of players after the
World Cup.''

THE vital role of field sports in sustaining the rural economy in
parts of Scotland was emphasised yesterday by the Scottish Landowners'
Federation as they launched a new handbook on the management of country
sports.
Graeme Gordon, federation convenor, said that visiting UK sportsmen
alone put more than #40m a year into the Scottish rural economy. Country
sports -- mainly fishing and shooting -- were a critical factor in
maintaining communities, schools and shops.
That tack was supported by Richard Cooke, factor of Dalhousie Estates,
who said that in Glenesk 50% of the resident labour force -- 14
gamekeepers -- was related to shooting.
Without grouse shooting only five full-time deerstalkers would be
retained. Without grouse and deer shooting, he said, the 120-strong
community in Glenesk which had a shop, school and post office would
become a collection of scattered farms.
The federation would be pressing the Government to take account of the
importance of field sports in its forthcoming White Paper on rural
policy, said Mr Gordon. ''Country sports are an important land use
alongside agriculture and forestry,'' he said. ''Traditionally across
Europe they have been seen as an interactive land use because they
complement other land uses.''
As the Common Agricultural Policy evolved more toward a rural policy
there would be pressure for recognition of field sports as an activity
which should receive financial support under measures to encourage farm
diversification, said Mr Gordon.
''With the publication of our handbook we are hoping to counter
criticism of country sports. Much of that criticism is based on lack of
information. I hope that commonsense and reason will prevail.''
The federation have expressed their concern that some species of birds
of prey, which currently enjoy protection, are becoming too numerous. Mr
Cooke of Dalhousie Estates said that hen harriers and peregrines posed a
threat to the recovery of the grouse population.
''In some areas the imbalance between predator and prey is a matter of
concern,'' he said. ''It needs to be looked at on a local basis.''
Some ''endangered'' species were no longer endangered and the
legislation giving them protection should be reconsidered. Mr Cooke said
that his estate had had six years without grouse shooting which meant a
loss of #60,000 for each season missed.
On current rates of recovery, following the 1989 collapse of the
grouse population, he estimated it would be another two seasons before
shooting would be viable at Glenesk.

Zimbabwe
SCOTLAND'S tour management have announced that Stuart Reid will take
over the captaincy from the injured Fergus Wallace, who arrived back
home yesterday. ''Stuart deputised for Fergus on Saturday and is the
natural choice,'' said manager Arthur Hastie.
Reid, who has captained Boroughmuir for the past two seasons, will be
joined by another member of the police force, Hawick flanker Derek
Turnbull. The latter arrived in Zimbabwe on Monday and, having checked
his fitness, the selectors had no hesitation in pitching him into action
straight away in today's match against Zimbabwe A at Mutare.
Turnbull, who has 15 caps to his credit, has recently returned from a
North America tour with the British police, where he led the side to
four victories from four games. This will be his eighth tour with
Scotland, one of these being the 1988 expedition to Zimbabwe, where he
played in both the Test matches.
Turnbull will be one of four Hawick players in the pack, which
contains Jim Hay, captaining the side, No.8 Brian Renwick and lock Ian
Elliot.
The side was clearly picked with an eye to Saturday's test team, but
coach David Johnston indicated that there were still possibilities for
players to promote themselves. Certainly, selectorial attention will
focus on Duncan Hodge, who plays his first tour match in his preferred
position of stand-off after appearing at inside centre last Wednesday in
the Scots' 42-13 win over Mashomaland Country Districts.
Hodge will be in direct competition with Stuart Laing, who played in
the first two matches and proved beyond doubt his talent as a
goal-kicker. But the selectors may prefer the more aggressive running of
Hodge, who himself will have a chance to demonstrate his goal-kicking
skills today.
Elsewhere in the side, Derek Stark switches from left to right wing in
his second outing and in the centre the selectors have paired the two
Scottish exiles, Murray Craig and Ron Eriksson.
Scotland -- M Dods (Gala); D Stark (Boroughmuir), M Craig (Waterloo) R
Eriksson (London Scottish), J Kerr (Watsonians); D Hodge (Watsonians), K
Troup (Edinburgh Academicals); M Browne (Melrose), J Hay (Hawick), A
Kittle (Stewart's Melville FP), I Elliot (Hawick), M Rudkin
(Watsonians), D Turnbull (Hawick), B Renwick (Hawick), G Flockhart
(Stirling County). Replacements -- R Shepherd (Edinburgh Academicals), G
Burns (Stewart's Melville FP), G Dall (Heriot's FP), R Scott (London
Scottish), A Watt (GHK), M Scott (Orrell).

THE Scottish Women's Open Golf Championship, to be played at Dalmahoy
from August 3 to 6, has found a sponsor -- but for one year only, and
the white knight which has come to the rescue is not from north of the
Border but is the London-based catering company, Payne and Gunter.
The prize-money, as under the short-lived aegis of Skoda, last year's
one-off sponsor, is #75,000. BBC TV will offer similar four-day coverage
as was given recently to the men's professional championship, and the
world's No.1 woman golfer, Laura Davies, will defend the title against
what is expected to be a strong international field.
Yet Terry Coates, chairman and chief executive of the American Express
Tour, expressed frustration and disappointment at the continued absence
of Scottish support. ''After Europe's Solheim Cup victory at Dalmahoy in
1992 we thought sponsors would be queueing up,'' he said.
0 Given the media exposure and the fractional cost of staging a
women's tournament compared with one on the men's tour and the new
standards being reached by British and Europeans on the women's world
stage, he was hard pressed to explain the reluctance of Scottish
business or industry to test the waters.
He admitted that sponsorship operated in a highly competitive
environment and that support in Scotland by the drinks industry, was not
necessarily the image appropriate to women's sport. But he disclosed
British Airways has just agreed a minor involvement, including help with
travel.
The European Women's Tour has in the last two years expanded from a
moribund nine tournaments to 19 worth some #2.5m in prize-money for
which its 288 members can compete.

A COURSE playing long following heavy rain should favour Britain's
Laura Davies in the American Express Evian Masters which begins over the
Royal Golf Club at Evian in France today.
Davies will be attempting to extend her record of winning at least
once each year in Europe since turning professional in 1985. Eight
members of the 1994 Solheim Cup side, including Helen Alfredsson, the
holder, will have other ideas.
Already this year Davies has won twice on the LPGA Tour where she
leads the money list with earnings of $431,176. There is no disputing
that Davies is the world No.1. The only obstacle would appear to be the
greens which baffled her last year when she had to settle for tenth
place, nine stroke adrift of Alfredsson.
Last year, over the same course, Scotland's Gillian Stewart lost much
ground with a closing 77. This left Stewart sharing twenty-ninth place
with Alison Nicholas, who scored a maiden LPGA win with her victory in
the Corning Classic in New York two weeks ago.
While Nicholas has won 10 European titles it is now four years since
her last. Much of her time over this period has been spent in America,
but her Corning success has enabled her to revise her playing schedule.
''By winning the Corning my player's card is now guaranteed for three
years,'' explains the former British Open champion. ''As an
international member I still have to play in 15 LPGA events, but I have
already played 11.''
Nicholas will play in the US Open and the JAL Big Apple event the
following week. The Weetabix British Open counts for both the American
Express and LPGA Tours and two end-of-season events would fulfil her
obligation.

THE British Wool Marketing Board, which is making a #4.2m takeover bid
for the 1400-member co-op Scottish English and Welsh Wool Growers Ltd
said yesterday that it had acceptances covering 55-60% of the share
holding.
The bid is being launched through the board's wool handling and
merchanding subsidiary -- Wool Growers.
Ian Hartley, managing director of the Wool Board, said that at this
stage he regarded the level of acceptances as a good response. The board
is aiming to acquire 90% of the shares, which would enable it to make a
compulsory acquisition of the remaining 10%.
The deadline for acceptance is next Monday but that can be extended if
necessary.
The board's offer puts a value of #4.10 on each #1 of capital
currently held by the co-op's existing members, most of whom farm in
Scotland and Wales.
''We have had responses from 800 of the 1400 members and the number of
rejections is in single figures,'' said Mr Hartley.
It was, he admitted, proving harder than expected to contact all
members of the co-operative. For many years they would have regarded
their shares as being of little value and some had failed to give
notification of changes of address.
Rog Wood, a Wool Board director, said he knew of one case of a woman
with a holding worth nearly #30,000.
A second letter to shareholders was issued yesterday by the society's
chairman, Jim Brown, recommending acceptance of the offer. Mr Hartley
met members of staff at the Hillington depot to discuss the board's
plans for the future.
''We want to revitalise the field and sales side of the business,''
said Mr Hartley. There will be no diminishing of service -- in fact we
hope we can improve the service.''
Redundancy terms have already been agreed for senior management at the
society. That apart, the board has no redundancy plans in prospect.

CHALLENGING the decisions of High Court judges is often an anxious and
certainly always an expensive course for a newspaper to follow, with no
guarantee of success. But if a court makes a decision affecting the
media which flies in the face of common sense as well as the plain
language of an Act of Parliament, the press would be abdicating its
responsibilities if it sat idly by. Judges have a habit of using
previous decisions as precedents, and unless the press sticks a foot in
the door it is likely to be slammed firmly in its face. That is why the
Herald's successful foray into the Court of Criminal Appeal yesterday is
of significance well beyond the confines of Albion Street.
At the beginning of the trial of Dr Paul Agutter, later sentenced to
12 years as the Safeway poisoner, Lord Morison decided to make an order
banning publication of any pictures of Mrs Agutter. She was one of the
victims in the case and her husband had tried to get rid of her by
spiking her drink with the lethal poison, atropine. The judge was
rightly concerned to save any further distress being caused to an
11-year-old girl also involved in the case at that point, although that
object was already being achieved by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland)
Act 1975 which bans the media from identifying anyone under the age of
16 involved in court proceedings. Lord Morison apparently thought a ban
on pictures of Mrs Agutter would help protect the 11-year-old. His
motives were no doubt sound, but he caused utter confusion by indicating
that he was dispensing with reporting restrictions before making an
order which actually increased them by including Mrs Agutter in their
ambit.
The Herald took the view, now confirmed by Lord Justice General Hope,
Lord Allanbridge, and Lord Cyde that such an order was incompetent
because the protection imposed by the law extended only to those under
16. The Herald has no interest in or intention of identifying an
11-year-old girl, but considers that, as a matter of public interest,
court proceedings should be reported openly and fully unless there are
compelling arguments to the contrary. The decisions of our courts should
be treated not with trepidation but rather with a respect which allows
them to be examined coolly and dispassionately and leaves them open to
challenge when they are seen to be flawed.

KEEPING the exterior of your home weatherproof will prevent costly
deterioration of the internal timbers, furnishings and decoration, and
will protect the fabric of the building itself.
Over time, there is invariably some deterioration in any house, no
matter how well-constructed -- no housebuilding company has ever been
able to halt entirely the ravages of time on the homes it constructs.
The decay may be caused by chemical action, biological factors, or
caused by weathering -- wind, rain, frost or snow. Whatever the cause,
the process begins from the laying of the first brick or timber, and
ultimately affects every material used in the construction of the house.
Paint, varnish and special preservatives can help protect brick, stone,
wood and metal from destructive influences, but to be effective, they
must be applied on time, with care and on a regular basis.
Exterior cladding can provide a new, weatherproof external surface
which will protect the original fabric of the building, preventing
damage and keeping the structure and interior safe and sound. But all of
these measures are pointless without regular checks to detect broken or
blocked rainwater gutters, pipes and channels and drains. Equally,
damp-proofing precautions and fabric maintenance will not be effective
unless there is adequate ventilation.
Reputable professional firms have expertise in pinpointing potential
trouble spots, and should be called in on a regular basis to make
repairs at the right time, with the right materials in the right way if
you plan to protect your investment in your home, and avoid massive
repair bills in the future. Armed with some knowledge of the causes of
deterioration, it is possible to avoid major defects developing, often
at a fraction of the cost which results from delays, or from botched
jobs done by inexpert handymen.
Acids play an important part in the deterioration of houses.
Industrial pollution of the atmosphere with acidic gases carried by
rainwater or fog is a common cause of deterioration. Sulphur dioxide is
a common pollutant gas -- it forms sulphurous acid when dissolved in
water, and causes serious damage, especially to lime mortar and anything
containing calcium carbonate. Even bricks, in which tiny sea shells have
been heated and oxidised to form calcium oxide, will react to absorbed
sulphur dioxide by splitting.
Even acids produced naturally do a great deal of damage -- carbon
dioxide dissolved in water to form carbonic acid is the most serious of
these naturally produced acids, and although only a relatively small
amount of the gas exists in the atmosphere, rainwater and mists
distribute it over every exposed surface.
If the surface is porous, deterioration will occur. Penetrating water
accelerates the action of carbonic acid, and algae will grow in the damp
stone or brickwork. Green stains and slime will begin to appear, and if
they dry out, turn black and provide nutrients on which lichens and
mosses can grow. These vegetations produce their own quota of acids,
often with devastating effects.
Where acids released by lichens and mosses have been carried down a
pitched roof by rainwater, it is fairly common to find that the lead has
become thin, or has been cut right through by the dissolving effect of
organic acid. Once the lead has been penetrated and rainwater can get
through, the process of deterioration advances rapidly -- dampness
inside the building causes fungal growth and insect activity, which can
cause devastation very quickly.
The most common fungus found attacking building timbers, in both old
and new homes, is the cellar fungus -- wet rot. It's often seen on dead
wood in forests, is frequently found in damp cellars, but will attack
flooring, joinery and even roof timbers if conditions are favourable.
The most destructive fungus of all carries the misleading name dry
rot. It is encouraged only by dampness, but when it was first noted
several centuries ago the fact that timber which had been attacked
eventually appeared very dry, brittle and powdery led to the mistaken
conclusion that the decay had been caused by dry conditions. In fact,
the dry rot fungus needs damp, but not wet, conditions for the
germination of its spores. It develops most rapidly at around 20 degrees
Centigrade, and the British Isles provides it with ideal growing
conditions throughout much of the year.
Dry rot is never found out of doors in Britain, but often occurs after
the wood has already be attacked by cellar fungus. Once established on
damp wood, dry rot will penetrate masonry with strands five or more
millimetres thick passing through brick, stone and even coarse concrete.
Moisture passes along these strands, and acid is released, so the fungus
actually creates the damp, acid conditions in which it can flourish in
environments which had previously been perfectly dry.
The best defence against most forms of decay and deterioration is dry
timber, and so it is essential that the walls of your home are sound and
weatherproof. Even that most common of pests -- woodworm -- will rarely
attack wood with a moisture content below 12%. And the fungal decay
organisms of wet and dry rots will never occur on wood with a similarly
low moisture content. Warmth and ventilation will reduce dangerous
humidity and dampness, discouraging timber-destroying insects and fungi.
But if you already have damp timber in your home, specialist firms can
keep it free from decay by applying timber preservatives, containing
long-lasting toxic chemicals which destroy insects and fungi and inhibit
egg laying and spore germination.
The amount of condensation in older homes has increased greatly in
recent decades due to the disuse of coal fires, and the subsequent
sealing off of chimneys to stop draughts, which reduces ventilation.
Many outbreaks of wet and dry rot start because of condensation, and if
coal fires have been replaced by central heating in your home, it may be
advisable to have grids under or in the skirting behind the radiators to
ensure adequate ventilation.

Toulon
STUART Gray follows in the footsteps of his famous father tonight,
when he makes his Scotland Under-21 debut against France in the Toulon
International Tournament.
The Celtic defender has already shown he has inherited some of the
talent which made his dad Eddie a legend with Leeds United, and on being
told he would be playing tonight, the 21-year-old admitted: ''It's great
to be keeping the Scotland tradition within the family, but I haven't
had the chance to tell my dad yet.
''He played so many times for Scotland and I always hoped that I could
follow him. It is a great honour to win my first cap at this level. I've
played a youth level before and want to complete the set before my
career is over.
''I have just signed a two-year contract at Parkhead and I am aiming
to make the breakthrough into the first team. Having won the Scottish
Cup, there is a real feeling that this is just a stepping stone to more
success and I want to be part of it.
''It is the same here. While the European Championships are our
priority, this event is important to many of the players. We are
disappointed at losing to Mexico, but the players believe we can win our
next two games and qualify for the semi-finals.''
Scotland have injuries to midfielder David Hannah and Doug Freedman,
with the Barnet striker the more doubtful of the two. But Scotland
manager Tommy Craig insisted: ''I have no fears that whoever is brought
in will do the job required. The players are determined to ensure they
get a result against France.
''If they perform to anywhere near their potential they will win. I
came here to win this tournament and believe this is still possible.
Looking back, the players were over-anxious and this contributed to the
defeat by Mexico. But they are a resilient bunch and have shown before
that they are capable of winning anywhere.''
But the Scots must subdue the threat of the player rated as the new
Michel Platini. Metz midfielder Robert Pires is already being tracked by
some of the Continent's leading clubs. Scotland assistant manager Eric
Black, who was with Metz when Pires first arrived at the club, said:
''He is an exceptional talent. Metz's problem will be hanging on to
him.''

IT IS useless to expect large-scale public inquiries to be tidy
affairs. They deal with complex matters such as planning laws, and these
are merged with the sometimes ragged opinions of those who will be most
affected. That said, the inquiry into the proposed quarry at Lingerbay
on Harris has been a fragmented undertaking at times. This is not the
fault of the Chief Inquiry Reporter, though she need not have showed
such sensitivity to the recent misspelling of her name in a document
from the hapless Western Isles Council. Nevertheless it is inevitable in
an issue which has dragged on for years, and in an inquiry which has sat
for the past eight months, that opinions will change, supporters of one
side or another will swither, and new insights will emerge as a result
of the airing of submissions from the interested parties.
That is precisely what has happened as far as public opinion on Harris
is concerned. The recent opinion poll on the island has reversed one
taken two years ago. The result is that a large proportion of the
population of Harris now wants the Secretary of State to reject the
Lingerbay quarry. The Western Isles Council has changed its mind and now
opposes the quarry plan. It is tempting to reject the poll and the
council's about-face on the grounds that constant referenda are not the
way to conduct business. In national matters this is undoubtedly
correct, but with issues like this, which will affect the local
population radically (and affect nobody else at all), the results of a
well-conducted opinion poll must be heeded.
The people of Harris must live with the consequences, and their
concerns should precede the strict letter of planning law. That must be
the prime concern of Mr Lang if, as seems likely, he is called to make a
judgment.

Political Reporter Benedict Brogan describes the reception at
Westminster for new Nationalist MP Roseanna Cunningham
THEY made her wait. It was almost an hour before the signal came
yesterday afternoon for Roseanna Cunningham to advance across the green
carpet of the Commons Chamber and take her place as the Member of
Parliament for Perth and Kinross.
Flanked by her sponsors, SNP colleagues Andrew Welsh and Margaret
Ewing, Ms Cunningham bowed twice when she had to, then solemnly swore to
be faithful and bear full allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen and her
heirs and successors. How they laughed on the nationalist benches.
She shook hands with Madam Speaker, who wished her good afternoon and
said it took a while to get used to the place -- ''stick to your
colleagues'' was her advice.
And that was it: the woman referred to by Michael Forsyth as a
Bolshevik, who knows more Scottish regiments than her London-dwelling
Tory rival, had joined the English club by the Thames.
But, first, tradition had her stand beyond the white line on the floor
of the Chamber, cooling her heels while the Parliament she would rather
not sit in -- of a United Kingdom she is pledged to break up --
discussed an English judge's report on arms sales to Iraq and the
development of the British film industry in London.
She passed the time being welcomed by MPs from all sides, mostly male,
who gravitated to the newcomer in an elegant skirt with all the
enthusiasm of those still unused to women as politicians.
Sir Edward Heath, Father of the House, smiled and said hello -- the
longest-serving member greeting the newest.
Norman Lamont, former Chancellor and staunch Unionist, stopped by as
well, presumably to explain why independence from Brussels matters while
independence from London does not.
Only Raymond Robertson, Aberdeen South MP and manager of the Tory
campaign in Perth and Kinross, seemed to bear a grudge -- Ms Cunningham
had to offer her hand twice before he shook it.
Her day at Westminster had begun with the fanfare of arrival, as she
was led up to the St Steven's entrance by a piper trailing the busload
of friends, in yellow Roseanna T-shirts, who had accompanied her from
Scotland.
The pipes were later confiscated by Westminster police, who claimed --
rightly, some might argue -- they were a dangerous weapon.
Outside, Ms Cunningham clutched a Saltire with her SNP colleagues and
posed for photos.
Labour's Dennis Skinner, the Bolsover MP renowned for his
internationalism and incorruptibility, stood watching. ''She's a
republican,'' he said approvingly, ''but I have no time for this
parochial nationalism.''
At the news conference afterwards, party leader Alex Salmond reassured
the SNP's opponents by noting that on current trends his party wins one
by-election a decade. Winnie Ewing -- winner of Hamilton in 1967 --
managed a smile and dismissed her earlier rift with Roseanna as an
incomprehensible lunacy by the media.
Ms Cunningham said she was pleased for herself, for the people of
Perth and Kinross and for the whole of Scotland.
''The by-election said a great deal to Scotland and the rest of the UK
about what politics was really like in Scotland and what the SNP really
stood for. The end result was a ringing endorsement of what we stand
for.''
And she acknowledged the irony of a republican Scottish nationalist
taking a seat in what is the heart of the Union.
''It's a pretty diseased heart, isn't it? London is the least
attractive aspect of the scenario. But we've long accepted until we have
our government in Scotland we have to come here.''
Once she's found a place to stay, she will begin work on her maiden
speech, which she is expected to deliver at the earliest possible
opportunity. Her colleagues are keen for her to shoulder some of the
burden of being one member of one of the smallest parties at
Westminster.

A COMBINATION of higher start-up costs in international businesses
coupled with increased fraud held back profits growth at Vodafone,
Britain's biggest mobile phone company.
In the year to end March, pre-tax profits grew by just 2% to #371.1m
on turnover up 36% to #1153m. Reflecting the long-term growth prospects
for the group, there is a final dividend of 1.7p, increasing the total
payout for the year by 20% to 3.34p.
Its UK customer base continues to grow, helped by the low prices of
subscriber equipment and the availability of low-cost tariffs which has
brought cellular phones well within the budgets of many consumers. At
the year-end, the group had two million subscribers, including overseas
interests, and numbers are growing at the rate of more than 90,000 per
month. This rapid growth resulted in connection costs for new
subscribers in network subsidiaries increasing to #187m from #83.8m.
However, these subscribers are expected to contribute to profits in the
current year.
Fraud and bad debt reduced profitability by #16m although increasing
moves to digital telephones coupled with increased customer verification
measures are expected to reduce the problem to around #3m in the medium
term.
Capital expenditure and investments in the year amounted to #496.1m of
which #335.1m was incurred overseas most of it in start-up operations.
For the first time, overseas investment exceeded that in the UK and a
similar situation is expected to occur in the current year.
Having established a base in 14 countries, Vodafone intends to
consolidate its position and expects to receive an increasing revenue
stream. Last year, new overseas businesses incurred start-up losses of
#63.1m compared with #35.7m previously. These are expected to follow
Malta, Hong Kong, and Greece into profit.

THE Government will try to protect ''the essential parts of British
life'' from European interference, the Prime Minister pledged in the
Commons yesterday.
Mr Major also renewed his attack on Labour's policy and warned against
abandoning Britain's power to veto major European Union proposals.
He was replying at Question Time to Tory Anthony Coombs (Wyre Forest)
who welcomed the Government's ''robust approach'' at the weekend's
Messina conference in Sicily -- called to pave the way for next year's
intergovernmental conference on the EU's future.
Mr Coombs urged Mr Major to remind European Commission president
Jacques Santer ''that far from wanting to give up the opt-out or our
national veto, the vast majority of the British people actually want to
see a reduction in the interference of the European Commission in the
nooks and crannies of British life''.
To Tory cheers, Mr Major told the House: ''I confirm that we shall
sustain the veto that we have had. We shall continue the policies of
seeking genuine subsidiarity.
''And we shall certainly try to ensure that the essential parts of
British life are protected from external interference.''
Meanwhile, Labour Euro-sceptics yesterday called for a Labour
Government to hold a referendum on Europe after next year's
Inter-Governmental Conference.
Veteran left-wing MP Peter Shore, launching the Labour Euro-Safeguards
Campaign, said Britain's continued membership of the EU was not at
issue.
However, it was essential to begin the process of ''rolling back the
frontiers of the emerging European state''.
''What is particularly objectionable is the continued transfer of
decision making powers from the UK Parliament to European
institutions,'' he said.
''This is not self-government, it is alien rule.''
Flanked by fellow MPs Austin Mitchell and Denzil Davies, he told a
Westminister news conference that joining a single European currency
would represent a further erosion of British sovereignty.
The campaign launch graphically illustrated the divides within the
Labour Party over Europe which mirror those among the Conservatives.

<HEADLINE>Ayrshire bus buy is referred.  Stagecoach 'astounded' by MMC investigation</HEADLINE>

PERTH-based bus group Stagecoach Holdings, which has suffered a
reversal of fortune in recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission
inquiries, was ''astounded'' by yesterday's announcement of an MMC
investigation into its purchase of an Ayrshire bus company.
It believes Corporate and Consumer Affairs Minister Jonathan Evans'
referral decision may be at odds with the relevant legislation.
Until recently, MMC investigations normally ended with Stagecoach, the
UK's largest bus company, giving assurances about levels of fares and
services.
However, in April, the Government ordered Stagecoach to sell its 20%
stake in Glasgow-based Strathclyde Buses, on public interest grounds.
The previous month, the Department of Trade and Industry instructed
the Perth-based company to sell its 20% stake in the South
Yorkshire-based Mainline Partnership bus group. The DTI, in this
instance, took tougher action than that recommended by the MMC.
Stagecoach had not expected its #4.25m purchase of Ayrshire Bus Owners
(A1 Buses), completed in January, to be referred to the MMC.
However, some industry analysts feel the MMC report, due by October 6,
could once again go against Stagecoach.
A1 operates local bus services in North Ayrshire, with depots in
Kilmarnock, Irvine and Ardrossan. Like Western Scottish, which was
acquired by Stagecoach for about #6m last July, A1 is based in
Kilmarnock.
Illustrating the relative size of the acquisition, finance director
Derek Scott compared Stagecoach's annual turnover of more than #400m
with the #3m made by A1.
Stagecoach points out that the provisions of the Fair Trading Act
1973, in connection with such merger inquiries, relate to companies with
a 25% market share either in the UK or in a substantial part of the UK.
Mr Evans believes the acquisition raises competition concerns in the
operation of the bus market in ''parts of the Strathclyde and Dumfries
and Galloway Regions''.
But Stagecoach, which has a UK market share of only 12%, thinks the
areas cited do not constitute a substantial part of the UK and will
bring this matter up with the MMC. The City will watch the outcome with
interest.
Mr Scott said: ''We are astounded because it is a very small
acquisition. This is certainly a change of direction by the DTI.''
''Our initial reaction is: 'Is that a correct interpretation of the
law?'.''
However, Bill McCall, an Edinburgh-based director of stockbroker
Tilney, believes the latest inquiry could result in another divestment
ruling.
He said: ''The methodology so far would show that the MMC has been
fairly tough so far as legislation in this vein is concerned.''
However, Mr McCall acknowledges that Stagecoach's challenge to the
legitimacy of the referral leaves a question-mark over the outcome.
Stagecoach said it was entirely confident that the public interest
arguments to be examined by the MMC would demonstrate that its
acquisition of A1 had improved the quality of bus services in Ayrshire.
In spite of recent competition rulings, Mr Scott remains confident
that Stagecoach can increase its share of the UK market towards the key
25% level.
The Perth-based company is also looking to move into the railway
business, having a particular interest in the ScotRail and South West
Trains franchises.
In spite of yesterday's news, Stagecoach shares edged 2p ahead to
217p.

THE National Lottery is a thrawn and skewed affair. Conceived in a
fetching pink mist of ideas about raising money for good causes, it has
developed into an efficient agency for raising money from ordinary
people, enriching a very few, beggaring small charities, and rewarding
outrageously the executives of this handsome monopoly. It is not too
late for some, if not all, of these blemishes to be remedied, and we
might as well start with those at the top. The executives of Camelot
have large salaries and now, we learn, benefit from performance-related
bonuses. What they have done in a monopoly situation to earn such
bonuses defies understanding. Worse, the bonuses are set to get bigger
if cash targets are met in future years. This is plain wrong, and also
raises the question of how the cash targets were set and at what level.
To put it simply, the base salaries at Camelot are high enough to
provide incentive and if it is not forthcoming the incumbents should
leave.
Reviewing the salary structure of Camelot executives is, therefore,
the first act of necessary reform. As Alf Young described in this
newspaper yesterday, the boardrooms of Britain, by and large, seem
incapable of understanding the very real revulsion on the streets at the
practices of some of their occupants. Whether this message penetrates
corporate consciousness or not, there are other reforms of the Lottery
which must be undertaken. Ideally, the organisation running it should be
non profit-making. This is not a sop to Mr Branson, who made a bid to
run the Lottery on these lines, but a way of rescuing the reputation of
an organisation which is, we repeat, a monopoly and which should be used
more effectively for the good of the nation whose individual members
queue up daily to contribute their mite.
Lastly, and by no means least, the disbursing of Lottery cash to
charities must be done on a more sensible basis. Many of the Lottery
players        (a misleading term conveying carefree fun) believe a
large proportion of the money raised goes to charity. It does not.
Moreover, the charity allocation often seems to go to the wrong
charities. The exclusion of medical charities from the benefits is
utterly wrong, especially as they are among the many charities whose
receipts appear to have collapsed because of the Lottery. The
responsibility for reform rests with the Government; it can make a start
on refurbishing its tarnished reputation by acting immediately.

Anne Johnstone discovers that the Pied Piper's business did not end at
the River Weser, as the hated harbinger of plague scurries back to
prominence in Britain.
RATS now outnumber people in Britain and, according to the Chartered
Institute of Environmental Health, it's time the country appointed a
Pied Piper to combat the problem.
A survey carried out by the institute showed an increase of 39% in rat
infestations in homes since 1979. Here's a group, it seems, that has
prospered under the Tories.
There are now an estimated 60 million rats in the UK and one in 20
homes is infested. In rural areas the figures are up by nearly 50%,
although in business premises the problem has declined. This is probably
because, in response to the Food Safety Act, companies which manufacture
and sell food have been forced to face up to their responsibilities for
keeping their premises clear of rodents. Many now employ pest-control
companies to monitor their buildings and keep them free of rats and
mice.
Nevertheless, the figures for private homes are so worrying that the
institute yesterday called on the Government to concentrate
responsibility for rodent control in one Government department. At the
moment it is shared by a range of bodies, including the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Health, the
Department of the Environment, local authorities and -- in England and
Wales -- the privatised water companies.
''The extent of this increase, combined with the fact that many
infestations are not being treated, indicates that improved methods of
control must be introduced and co-ordinated nationally,'' says Graham
Jukes, director of professional services at the institute.
You would not expect a rat to respect national boundaries, so it comes
as something of a surprise to find that Scotland doesn't appear to have
witnessed the same rise in its rodent population as England and Wales.
According to John Frater, chief executive of the CEIH's sister body, the
Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland, the number of rat
infestations dealt with by Scottish local authorities has stayed at
around 11,000 a year for some time. In 1984 the figure was 12,800. There
was a peak of just over 13,000 complaints in 1986, but in 1993 it was
down to less than 11,000.
Glasgow's 10-strong squad of Rodent Control Operatives handled around
5000 complaints about rats last year and another 2000 about mice. If
anything, the figure is declining. There seem to be a few areas,
particularly in the north of the city, where rats are a particular
problem. In the backcourts of Ruchill, for example, there are rats which
appear to have become resistant to the anti-coagulants used to poison
them. In Possilpark there's a long history of rat problems associated
with the sewer and refuse systems.
''If you have rats above ground, usually it's an indication that
there's something wrong with a sewer. The problem is exacerbated when
people throw litter about, especially half-eaten food,'' says Glasgow's
environmental health director, Brian Kelly. A major initiative is to be
announced soon to tackle this.
A spokeswoman from the CEIH yesterday was sceptical about the idea
that Scotland was somehow immune from the worrying trends which emerged
from its survey in England and Wales. The number of incidents dealt with
was not necessarily a good measure of the problem, she said. It could
indicate cutbacks in the services provided by local authorities, or lack
of public awareness of the problems posed by rats. It could also mean
that infestations once handled by council operatives were being dealt
with by private pest-control companies or by amateurs.
''A similar survey in Scotland might well uncover similar trends,''
she said.
The institute does not attempt to explain the apparent explosion in
the rat population, though it offers some possible suggestions. Tom
Stephens, of Rentokil, sponsors of the report, speculates that the
series of mild winters and wet summers may be partly to blame. ''More
rats are overwintering and more are breeding later in the season,'' he
said. It has been estimated that even a one degree rise in average
temperature as a result of global warming could produce a catastrophic
rise in the numbers of rats and mice. Rodents reproduce at a phenomenal
rate.
Secondly, the rise in junk food and the amount of it which ends up
discarded along our city streets, are providing rats with an a la carte
menu, the likes of which they have never known. Rattus Norvegicus, the
brown rat, will eat just about anything, including electrical wiring,
and can gnaw through anything, including concrete. Its weapons are its
incisors, which on the Mohr scale (a sort of Richter scale of hardness)
measure 5.5, which makes them tougher than steel.
Thirdly, the report points to changes in the way Britain's rat
population is being controlled. Many councils have cut back on pest
control services, or even withdrawn them altogether for private
homeowners. Others are charging for the service. Some of the privatised
water companies in England and Wales have also stopped baiting sewers
routinely with rat poison. Instead, they are only responding to reported
infestations. The CIEH is heavily critical of this change in policy, and
some environmental health experts in Scotland hint that this is why the
rat problem appears to be greater south of the Border. Clearly the
emergence of rats which are resistant to the chemicals generally used to
control them is another worrying factor.
Tom Stephens of Rentokil says more needs to be done to raise public
awareness about ''the nasty side'' of rats, particularly the way they
spread disease. They are often associated with food-poisoning outbreaks,
and salmonella as well as Weil's disease (leptospirosis) which
originates in rat urine and can cause kidney failure and death in
humans.
Will nobody speak up for the rat? Rob Ollason will. As head of the
education section at Edinburgh Zoo, he has used rats for 18 years for
his small animal handling sessions and his own children kept them as
pets. He says: ''Rats are lovely animals. They are very trustworthy and
much easier to tame than hedgehogs. We find them very clean and
sociable. Rats are reliable and I've never known one to bite a member of
the public.''

RACAL Electronics made a profit of #8.4m before tax (#4.8m after tax)
from its 22.5% stake in National Lottery organiser, Camelot.
Its share, #6.8m, of Camelot's start-up costs of #30m is being
amortised over three years. This, it says, is consistent with the bid to
run the National Lottery and is in line with Racal's accounting policy.
Racal's share in Camelot's winnings helped profits to more than double
last year to #58.3m enabling the dividend to be raised by 18% to 5p
after a final payment of 3.25p.
Turnover from continuing operations rose by 7% to #937.9m.
However, the City chose to focus on the difficulties faced by Racal's
data products business where revenues were #25m short of expectations in
the second half, and the shares dropped 8p to 250p where they yield
2.5%.
The market for data products is said to remain tough with margins
under continuing pressure. The Racal board has taken action to limit the
decline in the business with increased resources being devoted to growth
sectors.
Marine and energy activities also had a tough year because ofreduced
investment in oil exploration and little improvement is expected in the
current year. Turnover dropped by 2% and profits fell from #11.8m to
#6.8m. However, after breaking even in the first half, the energy group
returned to profitability by the year-end.
Including the contribution from Camelot, profits from data
communications grew sharply to #14.3m compared with #3.5m previously.
Turnover was 3% ahead at #384.2m.
Elsewhere in the group, strong performances were also seen in the
radio communications and defence radar and avionics divisions. Profits
rose by 15% to #20.5m in radio communications.
Increased research and development expenditure in the current year
coupled with the competitive market place means that the divisional
profits are likely to be reduced in the current financial year.
The defence radar and avionics group is expected to benefit in the
current year from a positive contribution from the #19m Thorn Sensors
acquisition. Provisions of #22m have been made for reorganisation and
contract liabilities. Specialised businesses also had a good year with
turnover up 8% and profts 29% ahead at #26.6m.
Racal's balance sheet deteriorated during the course of the year with
interest costs more than doubled at #3.7m. This was due to more
expenditure on acquisitions and investments, higher capital expenditure
associated with the lottery network and increased US interest rates.
With an opening net debt of #49.2m, the interest charge for 1995/96
will be higher than last year. Year-end gearing was just 9.3%.

EXECUTIVES of the nuclear industry will have their work cut out to
restructure the business in time to meet the Government's target for
privatisation in the summer of 1996.
Nuclear Electric chairman John Collier yesterday said it was a tight
timetable which was only ''just about'' feasible. He was speaking as the
company revealed another set of strong results, with operating profits
up 53% at #1200m for the year to March.
Directors can look forward to higher pay packages post privatisation,
as Mr Collier said directors' pay had not reflected their achievements
in recent years. But they will not do as well from privatisation as
others have done.
''It should be obvious to everyone by now that Nuclear Electric
directors will not be allowed to enjoy the same easy pickings that have
been associated with earlier privatisations,'' a spokesman commented.
Executive pay and share options had not yet been considered by the
board.
The company is starting to reorganise itself into the structure which
the Government decided upon last month. This involves the formation of a
holding company which will have Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear as
subsidiaries.
The regular contacts with Scottish Nuclear which already take place
will be firmed up into discussions about their future relationship
within the holding company. Nuclear Electric's Heysham 2 and Hinckley
Point B are considered sister reactors to Scottish Nuclear's Torness and
Hunterston plants.
The older Magnox plants of Nuclear Electric will be put into a
separate company which will remain state-owned. This will cause Nuclear
Electric the most problems because some of the Magnox plants and the AGR
reactors are on the same site.
In some cases there are physical links in the form of shared services
which will have to be separated. Each reactor will have to secure
individual operating and discharge authorisations and other regulatory
approvals. It is hoped to get the basic separation done by the early
autumn.
The structure means that the 2000 job losses which the company had
projected over three years will be less than expected because there will
be more duplication required. So far 500 jobs have gone and 250-300 will
be axed this financial year, against 400 expected earlier.
Before the #1250m a year annual subsidy, to take care of
decommissioning old plants, Nuclear Electric made losses in 1994/95 of
#33m, though they were down from #434m. The subsidy will end with
privatisation.
Improving operating performance is being led by cost savings and
rising efficiency. Operating costs were down 24% and productivity up
11%. Turnover in 1994/95 dipped 7% to #1638m, partly because of lower
prices but also because of problems in Heysham 1 and Dungeness B
reactors.
Cracks were detected in steam pipework welds which had to be
thoroughly investigated and put right. They highlight the risks involved
in the sector in that the tiniest fault has to be taken seriously,
leading to output reductions. Total electricity production fell 3%.
AGR unit costs were down to 2.4p a unit which compares favourably with
National Power and PowerGen which will be the company's competitors. The
#1250m annual subsidy to take care of inherited liabilities will be
phased out on privatisation.

THE 700 years of the Auld Alliance have seen a few ''up and unders''
between France and Scotland. However, the friendly association between
the two nations is probably strong enough to withstand even the
attentions of a World Cup referee with a defective timepiece.
When John Balliol first launched the alliance it was more an act of
desperation than an affaire de coeur -- an attempt to put some French
military muscle behind his otherwise empty throne.
It is also true that, through the years, the alliance usually meant
that bit more to the Scots than to the French, rather in the manner that
the more recent transatlantic ''special relationship'' used to be
enthused over by British politicians but provoked nothing but polite,
routine endorsement across the water.
However, like many marriages of convenience, time lends its own
enchantments and the genuine warmth of feeling between France and
Scotland should not be under-rated. You need only to travel across the
Channel to realise that an ''Ecosse'' sticker is a passport to, at the
very least, an entertaining evening in a small cafe.
The reverse is also true. Almost all the Frenchmen and women I know
who live in Scotland are enthusiastic supporters of all things Scottish.
That support can be found in such diverse places as a lovely hotel by
Loch Fyne, and the centre of the Edinburgh financial community. In both
places -- and many others -- there are French members of the SNP.
French friends of Scotland can also be found outside (or above) the
world of party politics. In the person of Jean Claude Richard we have
been fortunate to have, over the past few years, an energetic, engaging
and immensely pro-Scottish French consul.
Jean Claude is a living embodiment of the French enthusiasm for the
present day alliance, and a fine example of the good that such
partnerships can bring. Largely at his initiative the BBC decided to
devote an evening's programming to the Auld Alliance -- an achievement
which is beyond the Scottish political parties, even with the help of
the Court of Session!
There are many others -- men and women -- who have found the two
countries to be suitable counterpoints in their lives.
David Hume was one of them. Hume has a distinguished place in the
development of the Franco-Scottish relationship, not only because he
studied in France and brought a French tradition to fruition in his
native country, but also -- perhaps primarily -- because he introduced
his native land to pink ice cream -- a fashionable fad in Paris, that
became one of the staples of the Scottish ''pokey hat''.
But Mary of Guise -- a Frenchwoman who ruled Scotland, albeit as a
regent -- Mary Queen of Scots (and almost Queen of France) and Madame
Ecosse herself -- the modern embodiment of the European standing of
Scotland -- are all examples of the matriarchal tradition shared by
these two ancient partners.
And that sits well with the patriarchal tradition -- the noble Humes,
the sad and dispirited Stuarts, and the countless unnumbered, ordinary
people who often fought in each other's wars, and died on each other's
battlefields. That particular relationship was sealed with much Scottish
and French blood at the Somme and on the Marne.
Curiously the same words are often used to describe our nations --
proud, self-confident, even aggressively insular. The latter is not true
-- although we have sometimes appeared so. The French have, on occasion,
defined themselves by reference to their often aggressive German
neighbour. And Scotland, too often and for too long, has had the
anti-English chip on our shoulder.
Self-confidence needs to shine through. France is a noble and ancient
European nation which may have suffered defeat, but which has also shown
resilience and determination. In the last years of the twentieth century
it is leading the way in assured belief in a new and co-operative
Europe.
Scotland also needs to find the confidence to participate fully in
that Europe, as a sovereign state. It should not and must not define
itself by anything other than its own abilities and strengths. The
moment we fall into the trap of seeing ourselves as merely ''not
English'' we demean our potential, and that of our people.
Seven hundred years ago we made an alliance with another European
country. The fact that we still remember and celebrate it is a cause for
confidence. We are able to choose our own friends, and work with them
for mutual benefit. We need to do a lot more of it!

THE 1995 ScotRail timetable, with few sleeper trains, no overnight
low-fare seats, and cuts in Highland services, marks 10 years of decline
since the peak of Chris Green's success in delivering what in retrospect
was an apogee of Scottish railway achievement.
In 1985, Ayrshire electrification was still under way and the Bathgate
reopening was being prepared; these came in 1986. There were strikes
that year on the Strathclyde system, but before it ended Green as
general manager had successfully brought in driver-only electric trains.
At the same time, he was installing radio-signalling on the West
Highland, Kyle and Far North lines and proposing the Dornoch Firth rail
link at the then bargain price of #13m.
The 1985 timetable and the mainline trains in use then stand out, by
comparison with the depressed ScotRail and its tinny, underfloor-engined
short trains of today, with no mail or parcels carried and cycles
discouraged, and freight trains a mirage.
Moreover there was confidence and hope, and the staff ran the service
in the mid-eighties with enthusiasm and a belief in their managers.
The Edinburgh-Glasgow service then took 45 minutes and travellers
enjoyed highest-quality Mk 3 coaches with seats at tables. Trains nearly
as good ran Glasgow-Aberdeen, while Edinburgh-Aberdeen enjoyed High
Speed Trains nearly all day, not just on London services, with hot food.
That service ran fast to Dundee, with a second, hourly, Dundee service
for local stations. (The two are now largely combined, so through
travellers take longer, and put up with more stops.)
Main-line services to Inverness consisted of the well-built 1960s
coaches behind large locomotives.
On the West Highland, Kyle, Far North and Aberdeen-Inverness routes
similar comfortable coaches were in use, on tight schedules. The big
vans could carry almost unlimited mail, parcels, rucksacks, and cycles.
Arguably, Anglo-Scottish trains were also better then: an hourly East
Coast High Speed Train with uncramped coaches and seats at tables, and
trains every two hours Glasgow to Euston, plus two day and two night
trains each way between England and Inverness, and East Coast sleepers.
Many Scottish stations were so well restored as to merit a special
article the next year in Country Life. In all, ScotRail was on the way
to becoming a symbol of modern Scotland as the TGV is of France.
The rot set in very soon after Chris Green's ''promotion'' to
revitalise South-east England's system. He was replaced by lacklustre
managers applying a policy of cost-cutting, cheaper trains, and
compliance with London directives (or possibly no clear aims at all).
Initiatives like Dornoch were left to wither.
Decline was perhaps crystallised by the loss of the full first-class
carriages in each Edinburgh-Glasgow express. Beloved of Edinburgh
advocates in daytime, and acceptable to the evening-dress fraternity at
night, once reduced to a smoky half-coach the quality image on the most
visible Scottish service was lost.
The latest indignity is talk of class 165 suburban diesel trains for
the line. These are limited to 75mph (slower than traffic on the M8) and
have five-a-side seats. Some run now on London area branch lines to
places like Marlow and Henley-on-Thames. They would mean a one-hour
journey, the timing of the 1950s diesels. At least those had bars.
Since 1985, despite Ayr electrics, Bathgate and Fife Circle, it has
been downhill, even though passengers have largely remained loyal. Green
in his reduced role in 1994-95 could do little to reverse this.
Fortunately the present situation is clearly not politically
acceptable. Let us hope that 1985 is not forgotten as a benchmark and
let us give Green and the managers and staff who ran ScotRail in that
year our thanks for showing us a glimpse of a railway we could yet have.

MUCH as I dislike reacting to overt provocation, I really cannot
permit Mr Deerey's letter (June 2) to go without an answer.
His attack on Murray Ritchie's article appears to be based on two
premises, both of which are false. These seem to be, first, that Mr
Santer should shut up because he comes from a small nation and,
secondly, that Luxembourg is a ''sponger'' on EU funds which does not
even have its own economy.
The first premise is an extremely dangerous one. Does Mr Deerey
endorse the belief that ''might is right''?
With regard to the second premise, it is necessary to puncture Mr
Deerey's cosy delusion. Very few countries can nowadays generate the
dynamic resources to have an entirely self-supporting economy. This is
indeed the main reason for European unity, supported by all bar the
right wing of the Conservative Party.
Luxembourg, far from being a ''sponger'' on the wealth of the European
Community, is actually a net contributor. Indeed its citizens have the
highest per capita income in Europe.
Perhaps we should listen a little more to Mr Santer and a little less
to Lord Tebbit.

I WOULD like to respond to the letter from Chris and John Harvey of
Tarbet with regard to the marketing of the West Highland rail line (June
6). They express strong concerns about the apparent lack of creativity
and innovation in marketing Scotland's famous West Highland line.
Since joining the railway from the private sector in January 1994, I
have been convinced that the fortunes of this spectacular tourism asset
could be reversed by innovative and sustained marketing. To that end,
ScotRail's marketing team has worked hard and since last August we have
introduced --
(1) A complimentary Kid's Pack given to all youngsters.
(2) An audio tape which dramatises the history and heritage of the
West Highlands, available for sale on the train with a Walkman if
required.
(3) A ''Window Gazer'' which explains to passengers what they can see
through the window at every stage of the journey.
(4) A new range of short-break holidays to Oban and Fort William.
(5) A relaunch of the West Highland Railcard which has seen
distribution rise from 1300 to 25,000 in just three months.
(6) Testing of a unique concept to place a camera on the front of the
train feeding live ''Driver's Eye'' views to passengers through TV
monitors mounted in the cabin.
The net effect of these and many more initiatives has been to build
the West Highland line business by 50% and fill trains at a time of year
when they are normally empty.
I will leave the Scottish Tourist Board to fight their own corner but
should say that we have developed a very productive partnership with
them in the past few months.
We have many more exciting plans for the West Highland line and
ScotRail's many other services which are being introduced this year and
beyond. I hope that our plans and the early encouraging results which
they are producing put Chris and John's minds at rest.

Robert Dickson pays tribute to two men of
different generations whose championing of
the underdog marks them out for inclusion in
the pantheon of Scottish legal history
THE untimely death of Lord Morton of Shuna robbed the legal scene of a
kindly man who combined courage and a great legal brain with a human
touch.
These were qualities he shared with another judge whose death more
than 50 years ago at the age of just 58 was a grievous blow to the
Scottish legal system.
It had been intended that Lord Justice Clerk Aitchison would, in the
summer of 1941, be promoted to the House of Lords in which he would
undoubtedly have represented our legal system with distinction.
Lord Morton, for all too short a period, was a member of the House of
Lords and his address in that chamber in November last year, when he
spoke of the problems he perceived in the conduct of civil cases, will
be long remembered.
Craigie Aitchison had been in his time one of the most famous pleaders
at the Criminal Bar. His successful defence of Donald Marrett, accused
of killing his mother, came the same year as he managed to overturn the
verdict which had stood against Oscar Slater for so many years.
The magnitude of his task cannot be underestimated. Oscar Slater had
been convicted in 1909 of the murder of an 83-year-old lady in her house
in West Princes Street, Glasgow. The savage killing of Miss Marion
Gilchrist had aroused a great deal of public feeling and it may be that
this factor caused the then Lord Advocate Alexander Ure and the
presiding judge, Lord Guthrie, to attack the character of the accused in
a totally unacceptable fashion.
There was no right of appeal against a jury's verdict in 1909 and to
many of the public it seemed as though Oscar Slater was fortunate that
the death penalty was commuted.
Nineteen years later, with the law changed to allow criminal appeals
in such cases, Craigie Aitchison managed to persuade five judges that
the words used in the judicial summing up and those chosen by the
prosecutor were such that the conviction had to be quashed. To do this,
he had to assault the reputation of Lord Guthrie who had been a much
respected judge until his death in 1920. A far greater difficulty was
the need to criticise in blunt terms the speech of the then Lord
Advocate. By 1913 Mr Ure had become Lord Strathclyde on his appointment
to the top judicial post of Lord President of the Court of Session.
Although he had resigned in 1920 he was in July 1928 living in
retirement in Helensburgh and was a revered figure of the Scottish legal
establishment.
Craigie Aitchison did not flinch from the task before him. One
contemporary writer wrote: ''Mr Aitchison minced not his words but
directed his shaft straight at those of whose actings he complained''.
Fearless in his fight for those who sought justice, he would not allow
his personal feelings or sentiment to stand in his way. His address to
Lord Clyde and his four colleagues, which was spread over six days, was
a triumph of logic and forceful reasoned argument.
In 1929 with the change of Government, Craigie Aitchison himself
became the first ever Labour Lord Advocate. A year later he was elected
as MP for Kilmarnock, positions he retained until 1933 when he was
created Lord Justice-Clerk. His appointment to that post ensured that
the high traditions set by his predecessor, Lord Alness, were
maintained. Some of Lord Aitchison's judgments still guide the progress
of Scots Law particularly in criminal matters.
Regarded at first as being somebody who might allow his liberal
attitude (he had twice been a Liberal Parliamentary candidate in East
Stirlingshire) to soften his dealings with criminals, he quickly
disillusioned the Glasgow underworld by passing such harsh sentences in
his first High Court Circuit that he required a police escort back home
to Edinburgh because of the threats made against him. In the same way as
Lord Carmont was to do 20 years later, he caused the citizens of
Scotland's largest city to pause before resorting to violent crime.
The son of a Falkirk minister, Craigie Aitchison had attained success
by hard endeavour and ability. The winner of top prizes at university,
he used his talents as an advocate to achieve some remarkable verdicts
and it was his proud boast that he never lost a single murder trial. At
a time when Legal Aid was virtually non-existent, it was a tribute to
the Scottish Bar that counsel who could command large fees in other
cases were prepared, for no remuneration, to defend the poor and
ignorant.
Few accused had a better fighter in their corner than Craigie
Aitchison and once on the Bench he maintained his quest for the
underdog.
In his valedictory tribute, Lord Normand summed up Craigie Aitchison's
philosophy: ''He was resolved that so far as it in him lay no man should
be denied his due because of his poverty, or because he was humble or
friendless even when his own errors or folly had obscured the justice of
his cause.''
That comment adapted to the 1990s could equally have been said about
Hugh Morton. Whether as counsel for the Crown, or for the defence, he
used his best endeavours to ensure that nobody was denied a fair trial.
I well remember hearing him address a jury in the High Court in a tragic
case where a young woman had died needlessly. His quiet and gentle plea
was a masterpiece and its very simplicity hid the hours of thought which
had gone into its preparation.
In the same way as Craigie Aitchison, Hugh Morton used his outstanding
ability to fight for what he believed to be right and to try to ensure
that justice was both speedy and fair. Like Lord Aitchison, Lord Morton
once on the Bench never allowed his political views to cloud his
judgment and both men retained a sense of humour, modesty and
approachability despite high office. In each case premature death cut
short a brilliant career.

I REFER to the article by Christopher Reekie (June 3) describing the
Sunset Ceremny with fireworks to be held at Edinburgh Castle on August
20 in commemoration of VJ-Day and the end of the Second World War and
the fact that veterans were ''lining up'' at the castle to collect their
tickets.
While we did indeed invite a number of veterans along to the castle to
receive their tickets in person, and are certainly encouraging members
of the wartime generation to apply for tickets, we would not wish people
to think the castle itself is the contact address.
Other veterans and members of the wartime generation wishing tickets
should apply to the VJ Project Office, Army HQ Scotland, Craigiehall,
South Queensferry EH30 9TN (tel: 0131 310 2008) no later than June 30.
Any remaining tickets will be available to the public from that
address after June 30.

YOU devote almost a whole page to coverage of ''an all-out war against
drugs in Strathclyde'' (June 2). I am afraid your reporter, James
Freeman, has swallowed whole the police message without filtering it via
his brain.
He refers to the ''vociferous pro-legalisation lobby'' against whom
the Chief Constable ''came down hard''. I had not noticed the
voiferousness of this lobby -- I only wish it existed.
The article unwittingly demonstrates the crying need for it: 90% of
the drugs trade escapes detection, yet Leslie Sharp ''firmly believes
that practically all modern, urban crime is linked to drugs''.
His answer, almost on the eve of his retirement, is to ''give (drug
dealers) notice that their time is running out''. In September there
will be ''an unprecedented purge''.
James Freeman is disappointingly credulous in adopting the macho
language to which Mr Sharp appears to have become addicted at the end of
his career. Nothing that he plans is new, and it is no more likely to
succeed than the far more expensive ''War on Drugs'' started by the US
authorities.
Drugs are undoubtedly a cancer in our society, but their chief menace
comes from their illegality; almost all the crime to which the police
refer is a by-product of this.
Although they are no more enlightened when it comes to drugs, the
Americans did at least learn eventually that the prohibition of alcohol
did not work. The same is true of cocaine, heroin, and the rest, despite
their undoubtedly more harmful effects.
Large parts of many of our towns and cities are now virtually in a
state of anarchy because of a drug subculture. If this was no longer an
illegal subculture, that would change. It is time that the conventional
wisdom was challenged.
Mr Sharp, whose position as a public servant should inhibit him from
making political statements, is obviously not the man to face up to
this; instead, he is going to launch another futile campaign which, as
he acknowledges, will take the police away from other duties.
This is the trench-warfare strategy: I hope that it will not be too
long before we recognise that the Sharp method will be no more effective
than was Haig's during a very different conflict.

IN Guinea Bissau in West Africa the richest man is he who has the
highest dung-heap. There can be no questioning his lofty status for he
must have many cows to have so mighty a pile.
Outside the village the fields lie bare. Their fertility has been
exhausted by over-use, no dung has found its way there to be spread and
renew fertility under the African sun.
In Britain the director and members of the board of British Gas are
known as very rich men with high salaries and share options. They live
in a cocoon of wealth but out beyond that magic circle how do things
fare?
British Gas has shed some 12,000 employees, and workers who remain are
offered a 2% rise in wages. Gas showrooms everywhere have been shut
down. There is the ever constant fear of the sack and of poverty.
An odd likeness, is there not, between the barren fields of Guinea
Bissau which must do without dung so that the rich man may be recognised
by the height of his dung pile, and the barren stretches of industrial
Britain from which wealth is drained to feed the vanity and bank
balances of the very rich?

YOUR news of the likely advances in computer technology and Ruth
Wishart's article on poverty (June 5) focused for me the dangers of
allowing business to go uncontrolled.
On one hand, business supplies a nation's economic wealth. On the
other, its allegiance is to the largest shareholders -- not to any
workforce that remains after the march of technology, or to consumers.
Privatisation has meant that services introduced for the public are
now owned by companies and sold for the benefit of stakeholders. But a
country's Government supposedly exists to provide first for its people
and secondly for its business. Privatisation has reversed the
priorities.
If ''Mammon'' continues to receive sacrifices, companies will
increasingly shed employees and consumers will receive whatever standard
of service the optimum profit allows.
One country alone can't tackle this -- especially one insisting on a
veto. Perhaps Scotland should separate from its southern neighbour
before it's too late and they drag us down with them.

THE Scottish Secretary has put a bold face on the disastrous plan to
set up Health Care International Hospital in Clydebank at a cost of at
least #30m. The blinkered and narrow mindset which produced this
ill-fated plan is reminiscent of British rule in the last days of the
Raj.
The Scottish Secretary should not underestimate the acuity and good
sense of the Scottish electorate.
The sight of nurses and doctors doing charity stunts to raise funds
for essential equipment for children's hospitals has not escaped the
notice of people who value health care for all sections of the
population. It is a misnomer to talk of free health care because it has
already been paid for by all those who worked and made contributions
through taxation since 1945.
How ironic that the men and women who fought against Nazism and
Fascism in the Land Army, the factories, and the battlefields, have not
the peace and security of an established and secure health service as
they grow older and require more care.
The explosion of anger of the small shareholders at the British Gas
annual general meeting is only a symptom of a more widespread feeling
that most people deserve better -- jobs, decent wages, quality
education, a roof over their head, and accessible health care for people
of all age groups.

THE Saturday afternoon movie on BBC2, Love on the Dole, based on
Walter Greenwood's book about life during the Depression, had me
thinking I must be living in a time-warp.
I was not around during these hard times but I find the similarities
between then and the present day frightening. Our country is in a
similar position now to what it was 65 years ago.
This Government is guilty of failing most of us, from the masses of
unemployed teenagers, graduates, and redundant workers to the
overworked, undervalued doctors, nurses, and teachers.
It is totally unacceptable that the rich get richer and the poor
forgotten. How long must we put up with this injustice?

The Government now is probably irrevocably tarnished by a 'sleaze'
factor
As the Scott inquiry controversy grows, Stephen McGregor reports on
mounting media pressure while James McKillop considers the careers most
at stake
WHEN John Major announced the setting up of the Scott inquiry into the
arms-for-Iraq affair in November 1992 it was seen in some quarters at
Westminster, among grins, winks, and knowing smiles, as the classic case
of a Government trying to kick a difficult issue into touch.
What better, as far as civil servants and Ministers were concerned,
than to have a full and detailed inquiry which would probably take
forever, fudge the whole issue with stacks of complex -- and probably
contradictory -- evidence, and bore the public to death.
The tactic has not worked as, through clenched teeth, Mr William
Waldegrave would probably tell you. The beleaguered Minister has
defiantly insisted he will not resign over the allegations that he
misled MPs about the affair and has attracted support not only from his
fellow back benchers but from his constituency association.
Even the Prime Minister has expressed his belief in the ''integrity''
of the Agriculture Minister, said to be based on his knowledge of him
''as a Minister and as a person''.
More significant, however, are two other aspects of the affair.
Various Tories are now howling with complaint that the leak of the draft
findings of the Scott inquiry ever took place, and we will all now have
to wait for a real Gavin Hastings touch kick because the final report
will not be ready until the autumn, or even possibly next year.
Neither of these tactics will work, and it is probably about time this
Government realised why. It is deeply unpopular, unlucky, and accident
prone. It has probably been in office too long and, as the Nolan
committee and one or two other little matters have highlighted, there
are elements in the party whose arrogance and belief in what they can
get away with constantly undermine not only John Major's authority but
the public perception of the party of Government.
There was a time -- and it is not so long ago -- when the ''into
touch'' tactic would have worked, simply because there was far less
media attention focused on Westminster. Nowadays, however, with the
spread of newspaper, television, and radio coverage of politics, it is
difficult to hide. As soon as Mr Major made his announcement about the
Scott inquiry and its nuts and bolts, the more serious newspapers and
news-gathering organisations allocated teams of people to cover the
thing, and London now is awash with experts in every nook and cranny of
Scott. Nolan was given the same treatment.
There was a general suspicion that the Government was ''at it,'' and
therefore the media was determined not to let go of either issue. Nor
has it and nor will it. Nor will it again if something similar happens.
We have all learned our lesson except, apparently, the Government.
There is not much point, either, in complaining about leaks such as
the one which brought about the Scott disclosures. Mr Major referred
yesterday to a ''malicious leak of part of a report,'' back benchers
were outraged, and even Sir Richard Scott himself told reporters outside
his home: ''My feeling about the release of the draft report is that it
is regrettable. It should not have happened, should not have been
leaked, should not have been used, and the sooner I get my full report
out the better.''
Looked at from here, the furore over the Scott inquiry can only do
further damage to a Government already on its knees and a Prime Minister
fighting desperately for his own survival.
Put basically, the public no longer trusts this Government which,
despite John Major's own personal honesty, straightforwardness, and
integrity, seems simply to stumble from one crisis to another.
They are protesting about what has happened over Scott -- new evidence
will be presented, Ministers protest their innocence -- but there is no
escaping the conclusion that the Government now is probably irrevocably
tarnished by a ''sleaze'' factor which cannot be rescued.
Mr Major and his senior lieutenants have tried in recent weeks to look
like a Government that has not run out of steam. The attacks on Labour
as having no meat on the bones of their policies have been stepped up,
the Cabinet has tried to put some meat on its own bones in terms of
coming up with new policies and legislation for the Queen's Speech in
November, and a reshuffle is in the offing.
It is unlikely, however, whether any of this can change the
perceptible and growing feeling, to which the Scott and Nolan inquiries
have added considerable weight, that this Government is down and out.
It will have, by the autumn, something like 18 months to sort matters
out. A new party chairman is a certainty, as is a new Health Secretary,
but beyond that it is difficult to know what Mr Major can do to breathe
new life into the body, particularly since he will be operating with a
Commons majority of probably no more than seven -- a far cry from the
Thatcher days of 140-plus.
As for Mr Waldegrave, he always has been a wee bit accident prone, but
has survived. The latest controversy, however, may be terminal. He has
been around -- Central Policy Review Staff from 1971 until 1973, a
member of Sir Edward Heath's political staff from 1973 to 1974,
assistant to the managing director of GEC, a JP for inner-London and
various ministerial posts leading up to his present position, which he
is said to enjoy.
Aged 48, he is variously described in one of the books of Commons
profiles as an ''erratic young high-flier,'' an ''old-establishment
archetypal thinking wet,'' and someone (wait for this) who is ''often
perceptive and witty but can sometimes flounder.''
He has even been described as a future Tory Prime Minister. That
ambition -- if, indeed he personally ever harboured it -- may have to
wait a very considerable time.
At the moment the ball, in terms of future Prime Ministership, is
firmly in Mr Major's court. The media has not yet turned its attention
to Mr Blair and his cohorts, and while the Prime Minister must dearly
hope that it will, this is unlikely until, how can we put it, certain
matters are cleared up.
We are caught at the moment in the classic situation of: ''What did
Ministers know and when did they know it?'' As one profoundly neutral
Westminster observer remarked yesterday: ''A lot of people have
forgotten what the Scott inquiry was all about, but they are still
asking what the Hell is going on?'' Oh dear, Norma, oh dear.

Who judges the judges? Law Correspondent Bruce McKain reports on the
vital role of the press
A HIGH Court judge, recently retired, was about to pass sentence at
the end of a particularly sickening and violent West of Scotland rape
case in which the victim had been stripped and left for dead on a
railway line.
He wanted to impose severe punishment to mark the court's disgust and
particularly wished the message to be hammered home in the next day's
newspaper headlines as well as on television and radio.
He sent his clerk round the High Court building to locate a
journalist, alas without success, leaving the public, outside of those
immediately involved in the case, unaware of the dreadful crime that had
been committed and the punishment inflicted.
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example of justice being
carried out in a vacuum. It happens in courts the length and breadth of
Scotland every day, basically because of too much crime, too many
courts, and not enough journalists to go round.
So when it is said, with much justification, that Britain is one of
the most secretive countries in the world, in many ways we only have
ourselves to blame for allowing it to happen.
Many news organisations look to sex, pop, and soap opera to fill their
pages and airwaves because they are much less dangerous, expensive, and
time-consuming than covering the courts.
It takes a huge commitment to train staff properly to grapple with the
minefield of legal reporting but surely it is a commitment worth
honouring.
Lord Emslie, the distinguished former Lord Justice General, once said:
''If the public is to retain confidence in the judicial process I have
no doubt that they must be kept aware of what the courts are doing and
why they have reached decisions which affect the lives and the liberty
of the people in this country.
''In the nature of things, few members of the public attend trials and
other court hearings and we have come to rely on court reporters, in the
public interest, to provide an essential link between the courts and the
people whom they exist to serve.''
Yesterday's successful challenge by The Herald to a court order which
banned the publication of the picture of the wife of the Safeway
poisoner, Dr Paul Agutter, is an excellent example of the part the media
can play in trying to ensure that the courts act properly in the public
interest.
The order pronounced by the court was in fact one which it was not
empowered to make, but which would have stayed in force but for The
Herald's decision to take the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
The challenge was important because it now allows The Herald (and
other news organisations) to use pictures of the victim in one of the
most notorious criminal trials in recent years.
But perhaps the real importance lies in the mere fact that that the
challenge was made at all.
Because judges, sheriffs, and magistrates do sometimes make decisions
that defy logic and common sense, and too often they are allowed to go
unchallenged.
The Scottish courts used to take the view, for example, that
publishing a picture of an accused person was contempt of court even if
there was no issue of identification and no possibility of prejudice to
the case.
That was arrant nonsense, but it wasn't until the case of Atkins v
London Weekend Television in 1978 that sanity was restored when the High
Court said: ''We accept the proposition that the publication of a
photograph of an accused person will constitute contempt only where a
question of identification has arisen or may arise and where the
publication is calculated to prejudice the prospect of a fair trial.''
The Scottish courts, or more particularly the late Lord Justice
General Clyde, also used to think that a newspaper was in danger of
committing contempt of court as soon as a crime was suspected.
This edict, which in effect became the law for a number of years, made
investigative reporting of crime virtually impossible.
Earlier this year, Lord Hope fined the Evening Times and its editor a
total of #2750 after it published a completely accurate story, warning
the public that a man called Daniel Boyle had escaped from custody. The
Times added that Boyle was facing an armed-robbery charge and might well
be dangerous.
Lord Hope took the view that this put at risk Boyle's prospects of a
fair trial, a few months in the future.
However, he decided that the Daily Record had not committed contempt
when it published a story mistakenly describing Boyle as a killer. This
was on the somewhat artificial basis that the Record had not actually
mentioned the fact that Boyle was standing trial in a few months' time.
In another recent case in which a bank manager was on trial charged
with stealing #163,000, a newspaper headline stated, as a fact: ''Bank
boss stole cash for 20 years,'' and the first paragraph of the story
described him as ''crooked''.
Somehow, the trial judge came to the view that this did not create a
substantial risk of prejudice to a fair trial.
Sometimes the media has no right, or locus standi as the lawyers put
it, to go into court to challenge bad decisions, except behind the
scenes by lobbying lawyers and MPs.
When the court option is available and prospects of success are
realistic, as they were in The Herald case yesterday, the media is
failing in one of its most fundamental duties if it fails to take up the
cudgels.
Some may ask whether the media, which wallows in public esteem
somewhere below politicans and estate agents, should be entrusted with
the crucial role of judging the judges.
The short answer is that no-one else is doing it. More important,
perhaps, the media in Scotland has shown over the years that it can
behave responsibly even without a law compelling its compliance.
It may surprise a lot of people to know that there is no law in
Scotland banning the identification of rape victims in reports of court
cases.
The reason that their names never appear is because a voluntary system
was agreed between the media and the judges some years ago by which the
press is allowed to stay in court while the alleged victim gives her
evidence -- provided she is not identified.
Lord Avonside, a fearsome judge, who was not a noted fan of the press,
said: ''In our courts a victim alleged to have been raped almost
invariably gives evidence behind closed doors. The public is not
permitted to hear her evidence.
''It has been the practice to allow the press to remain. They are
asked to exercise a wise discretion and, in my experience, this they do
admirably.''

There was much free entertainment and a great deal of satisfaction to
be had just from watching the most powerful in the land being brought
down to earth when they were forced to answer direct questions at the
Scott inquiry and explain their actions. So much so, they even made a
play out of it.
Margaret Thatcher, in particular, was superb. She began in her most
haughty manner. ''Papers! Do you mean there are more papers to look at?
I have never seen so many papers in my life.''
Lord Justice Scott intervened after the initial skirmishes by making
it clear that this inquiry was serious in its intent to get to the
bottom of this affair. Thereafter the victor of the Falklands war, just
like every other witness who had preceded and succeeded her, gave in and
got down to the business of directly answering questions put to her.
Mr Waldegrave is but one of a series of very important people likely
to be criticised by Sir Richard in his final report who have received
drafts and have been given a final opportunity to respond. Some are
taking legal advice. The main players in Government over the
arms-for-Iraq scandal realise that their careers are hanging in the
balance. The list of the main actors makes interesting reading. The
judge will decide who is innocent and who is guilty.
* William Waldegrave is hugely intelligent, perhaps too intelligent to
be involved in Government. Certainly he is far too intelligent for an
aristocrat. Son of an earl, he went to a reasonable school in England,
Eton. His education continued at Corpus Christi, Oxford -- he was
president of the union there -- and at Harvard. He is a hugely likeable
chap and it is understandable that his constituency even now is prepared
to back him to the hilt. They know full well he would not knowingly get
involved in any form of skullduggery. In front of Scott he was relaxed.
However, his intellectual reasoning over a change of policy in existing
Howe guidelines governing the sale of arms to Iran and Iraq came across
as a bit too clever by half. Yes, he said, a new approach was being
taken over sales to Iraq. However, no announcement had been made to
Parliament. Ergo, there was no change in Government policy.
* Attorney-General Sir Nicholas Lyell did not come across too well at
the inquiry, especially over conflicting advice given to individual
Ministers concerning their roles in signing Public Interest Immunity
(PII) Certificates. Michael Heseltine was reluctant, and he was told one
thing. Other Ministers were keen to sign, and they were told another. He
is another Oxford man. During national service he was an officer with
the Royal Artillery. As a lawyer his speciality was commercial and
industrial law. While at the end of his evidence Lord Justice Scott paid
all due deference to a brother judge -- Sir Nicholas was a recorder at
one stage -- there was no doubt his role in the affair was suspect. Sir
Nicholas accepted he carried ministerial responsibility for a series of
blunders.
* Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind signed a PII that could have
withheld evidence from the Old Bailey trial of executives from Matrix
Churchill. Known to every politically minded person in Scotland, it is
reckoned he is too clever by half. Certainly he is far more intelligent
than the rest of us. Educated at George Watson's and Edinburgh
University, he is attempting to get to grips with one major problem of
speaking far too quickly and in staccato sentences. Often he fails. As a
lawyer he hoped he came across as a credible witness at the Scott
inquiry explaining how he was totally justified in signing the PII.
* Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, was another lawyer to give evidence. His
was a laid-back approach with a relaxed attitude to PII's. No doubt he
felt he was on safe ground in so much as he signed the document to
ensure that intelligence material did not unnecessarily get into the
public domain. His down-to-earth Nottingham background came across
rather well, even though he was a former president of the union at
Cambridge.
* Peter Lilley also signed a PII even though he reckoned the
prosecution of the Matrix Churchill executives was doomed. Educated at
the elite Dulwich College and Cambridge, his publications include such
titles as Do You Sincerely Want to Win? and Lessons for Power.
* Michael Heseltine, millionaire publisher, who might still have
ambitions to become Prime Minister, comes out of the inquiry whiter than
white. He steadfastly refused to sign a PII until told by the Attorney
General it was his duty so to do. Even then he had it rewritten to cover
his main objections.
* Sir Robin Butler -- real Christian name Frederick -- as head of the
home Civil Service is most concerned over likely criticism of mandarins.
Educated at Harrow and University College, Oxford, he has done it all.
It is not known if he was entirely amused when he was given one of the
special ties for journalists who covered the inquiry. We would like to
think he was.
* Lord Howe of Aberavon, once known as Sir Geoffrey Howe, more or less
told Sir Richard that without lay assessors he could have no insight
into the way Government worked. It was Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
who drew up  guidelines on arms to Iran and Iraq that were at the heart
of the inquiry. He implied the judge had no business investigating what
went on behind murky corridors in Whitehall.
* John Major reckoned that it all happened when Margaret Thatcher was
Prime Minister. Even while he was Foreign Secretary he knew nothing
about a secret Government relaxation on the embargo on arms to Saddam
Hussein, he told Sir Richard.
* Margaret Thatcher. She never said it, but we all knew she was
thinking it. None of this inquiry business would have happened in her
time.

DETECTIVES hunting the murderer of 22-year-old prostitute Leona
McGovern, whose body was found in the grounds of the Glasgow Arts Centre
at Washington Street, last Friday night, are still seeking a man seen
running from the scene.
The prostitutes who frequent the Anderston area had been severely
frightened, the detective leading the police hunt said yesterday, but
they were still there and plying their trade.
A clear description was given of the man -- aged 20 to 30, dark haired
and wearing tight trousers and a denim jacket -- but people have still
not come forward despite the fact that the area was busy at the time.
The officer in charge of the murder hunt, Detective Chief Inspector
Nanette Pollock, said yesterday that the murder scene was directly
opposite the Marriot Hotel and close to the main road, so that motorists
and taxi and bus drivers would certainly have been around between 7pm
and 9pm.
She appealed to potential witnesses to call either the Crimestoppers
number or Cranstonhill Police Station with any information, which would
be treated in confidence.
DCI Pollock said that the response from the prostitutes and the
homeless who frequent the Anderston area had been good. Leona McGovern,
originally from Haghill and homeless, had died from a severe head injury
which was particularly brutal, she said. A weapon had probably been used
but they did not know what. There was no indication at present that she
had known the man.
The alarm was raised by someone who had seen two people going into the
grounds of the Art Centre but only one coming out and thought there was
something amiss.

A SPRINKLER system which two years ago helped to save Edinburgh's
Playhouse Theatre from being destroyed by fire was responsible yesterday
for the plug having to be pulled temporarily on the hit musical Singin'
in the Rain.
A hairline fracture in a pipe feeding the system at the 3000-seat
venue caused around 100,000 gallons of water to pour through eight
levels of the building.
Firefighters called to the scene around 4am found floodwater 5ft high
in the basement which caused damage estimated at #150,000.
It washed out last night's production of the show which had its
Scottish premiere a week ago. However, this afternoon's show is
scheduled to go ahead.
As a team of around 100 workers -- many flown from London, Manchester
and Bristol -- prepared to work through the night to ensure a quick
resumption, the show's star, Paul Nicholas, accused Albert, the
theatre's ghost, for the mishap.
He said he had never encountered such an incident before. ''Albert was
a handyman and I think when he saw me having such a good time last night
on stage he decided he wanted to do his own version of Singin' in the
Rain. Hopefully, we can appease him for the rest of the run.
''It's nice to know the sprinkler system works,'' added the star who,
while singing the title number of the show directed by Tommy Steele, is
drenched by water from fire hydrants.
Two years ago, a blaze -- thought to have been started accidentally by
homeless people at the rear of the theatre -- badly disrupted Edinburgh
Festival productions by international opera and dance companies. Damage
was estimated at around #750,000.
People with tickets for last night's show were being offered a refund
or rescheduled tickets for performances which run until July 8.

SOMETHING rather curious has happened to Senator Bob Dole, who is
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. He issued a
stirring denunciation of Hollywood and the record industry last week,
and a majority of Americans agree with him: many of the leading figures
in those two cultural forces in our lives are sleazy, immoral, and
utterly corrupt. But a clear majority of Americans also believe that
Dole was motivated by politics, not conviction.
All those years of denouncing politicians and Washington have got to
the Republicans as well. People distrust all politicians, including
those who most vigorously denounce the breed, including conservative
Republicans. Serves them right.
Dole's attack on Hollywood and on ''gangsta rap'' was the most
effective in years. He did not make the mistake of Vice-President Dan
Quayle during the last election, who denounced a television character,
Murphy Brown, whom her script writers made a single mother. Most people
thought it ridiculous to go after an image.
Nor did Dole fall off the edge, like Patrick Buchanan during the 1992
election, who proclaimed that there was a cultural war between the good
and decent, on the one hand, and the forces of darkness -- who all
happen to be Democrats. Neither did he propose censorship. He used the
force of public humiliation to attack the rich, middle-aged white men
who make money out of selling garbage to teenagers.
Dole went for misogynistic songs in which the singers praise the joys
of rape and murder, using all the basic obscenities plentifully. He also
went for the most violent of the current crop of movies, including
Natural Born Killers and True Romance. He made his speech in Hollywood
itself, adding injury to insult. ''We have reached the point where our
popular culture threatens to undermine our character as a nation.'' He
referred specifically to the country's largest media empire: ''I would
like to ask the executives of Time-Warner a question: Is this what you
intended to accomplish with your careers? You have sold your souls, but
must you debase our nation and threaten our children as well?
''A line has been crossed,'' he said, ''not just of taste but of human
dignity and decency. It is crossed every time sexual violence is given a
catchy tune. When teen suicide is set to an appealing beat. When
Hollywood dream factories turn out nightmares of depravity.''
ALL good stuff. Dole is not usually eloquent: he has got himself some
good speech writers. Dole has a point, and by making it has brushed all
the other multitude of Republican candidates off the charts. By a nice
coincidence, the papers have just revealed that Senator Phil Gramm, the
hyper-moral Texan who is Dole's chief rival, once helped finance a dirty
movie.
True, that was 20 years ago, but the story threw Gramm off stride just
as Dole was winning all those favourable headlines and praise. Jonathan
Yardley, a consistently liberal columnist in the Washington Post, for
instance, wrote that Dole ''was dead-on right''. He said: ''The plain
truth is that American popular culture is every bit as debased and
depraved as Dole said it is and that this should be a matter of the
utmost concern to all of us.''
And never mind if Dole was consciously playing politics.
The question will be whether, first, Time-Warner can be shamed into
closing down its gangsta rap division.
Time-Warner makes the preposterous answer that banning gangsta rap
would deny minorities artistic outlets. What it means is if it stops it,
the singers will move to some other company. We will see.
Another sinister trend is that many white children in the suburbs now
buy gangsta rap as much as blacks in the ghettoes.
It's not just Time-Warner, of course. That company is merely the
largest of the media conglomerates. Nor is it a left-right thing, though
the maker of Natural Born Killers was Oliver Stone, who has been
subverting the United States from the left for years. Bruce Willis, who
makes super-violent movies, is a raving Republican, and Dole made an
exception for Arnold Schwarzenegger, possibly because he is a Republican
too.
Individual Hollywood directors, like Stone, may be conspicuously
immoral, but it is the culture of the place that has attracted all the
current scrutiny, the fact that violence, sadism, and a general trashing
of America is the ruling principle. In Hollywood, government and
business are always evil and victory usually comes to the most violent
defender of truth and justice.
Hollywood's friends say they are merely reflecting a violent,
alienated, insecure society that believes in every conspiracy theory and
detests the Government. Dole and many others are suggesting that words
and images have done a lot to create that alienation.

THE HCI hospital at Clydebank -- which crashed with debts calculated
at #120m -- reneged on a deal to pay for a tiny community park for
elderly people in the town, it was claimed yesterday.
Clydebank District Council will pick up the bill for HCI's #15,000
promised share of the cost of the park, near the hospital gates at
Dalmuir.
The hospital's patients will still be able to use the 6.5-acre site if
they want a stroll after it is opened by Clydebank Provost Mr Jack
McAllister on June 15.
The ceremony concludes four years of negotiation between the council,
community representatives, and original hospital top executives -- many
of whom left shortly after it went bust in November.
HCI's cash injection was to pay for creating and installing equipment
-- including a giant chessboard, seating for pensioners at a quiet
corner, and a play area for young children with special non-slip
surfaces.
The council was to pay only #5000, to cover the cost of landscaping
the area.
Councillor Mary Campbell, who represents Dalmuir, said yesterday: ''It
was a gey hard battle, month after month, and after all that the
community is not to get its money.
''They knew months ahead of time that it would not be forthcoming. I
can even put my finger on the back-sliding starting in February last
year.''
Mrs Campbell, who is leader of the shadow Dumbarton-Clydebank unitary
authority, said HCI bosses wanted to give the #15,000 directly to the
district council to absolve the company in any possible subsequent legal
dispute connected with the park.
The #180m complex was formally opened in June last year and
immediately began to lose money.
In February, the Abu Dhabi Investment Company paid #20m for a lease to
treat patients flown in from the Middle East.

In the wake of the row over HCI at Clydebank, Alison Daniels describes
how the hospital is concentrating on the future.
THE renewed political row over the public funding of the private
Health Care International hospital in Clydebank has cast an unwanted
shadow over those facing the task of turning round the hospital's
financial fortunes, attracting overseas patients, and polishing its
tarnished image in the UK.
The receivers' report delivered by accountants Arthur Andersen to
creditors on Friday, caught the media unawares -- creditors were
informed by letter -- and provoked calls this week for the Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang's resignation amid accusations of figure juggling.
The Scottish Office maintained that the report was an issue for the
creditors and that the #27m owed to the taxpayers was a figure detailed
at the time of receivership in November. The receivers described the
project as flawed from the beginning. It emerged that the venture's
total losses amounted to #120m and in the six months up to March 1994
the hospital lost #21m and in the following six months, #18.8m.
The political fall-out has been greeted with a degree of weary
resignation by HCI's business development manager, Rick Taylor. In
response, he details HCI's realigned objectives, future plans for
expansion, the hospital's refined marketing strategy, and a number of
medical innovations as well as hinting at lucrative new Middle Eastern
patient contracts about to be signed.
While the war of words, claims, and denials is waged in the political
arena, the atmosphere inside the Clydebank hospital is, as usual,
serene, verging on tomb-like. A handful of Middle Eastern patients and
relatives wander through the hospital's gleaming reception area. In a
pristine conference room, Taylor fingers a string of worry beads.
Simply put, he says, HCI is principally concerned about the future and
about meeting the two-year break-even target set by the Abu Dhabi
Investment Company when it took over the ownership of the business and
leased the building from the banks three months ago.
To date, he argues, there is clear evidence of a turnaround in
fortunes. About six weeks ago 70 full-time medical jobs were advertised
across the UK and Ireland from which 30 posts have been filled and a
further 32 offers outstanding.
In addition, another recruitment drive was discussed at a meeting last
week, a new consultant working in the oncology department is due to be
appointed, and the hospital is set to expand the range of treatment it
can offer outside its core areas of cardiology, vascular and open-heart
surgery, oncology, orthopaedics, and ophthalmology.
Consultants specialising in gynaecology, plastics, and reconstruction,
infectious diseases, ear, nose, and throat problems, and breast cancer
will be brought in to HCI on contract in response to demand.
The current workforce is 383, comprising 23 doctors, 50 nurses, 52
housekeeping and catering staff, 178 clinical and administrative support
-- a wide-ranging umbrella covering technical and paramedical staff,
managers and secretaries -- and 80 staff in the hotel.
Of course, the public funding debate has prompted questions about
patient numbers -- a theme Taylor is visibly irritated by and says has
been over-emphasised. The aim, he says, is to attract high-paying
patients, who, if receiving top-of-the-range treatment, can pay up to
#100,000 for a complicated operation rather than mop up NHS waiting list
patients requiring only, for example, #300 to #400-a-day varicose vein
treatment.
Treating NHS patients, is not, however, out of the question. There
have already been a number of high-profile operations involving NHS
patients referred by trusts, though at present there are none in the
hospital and Taylor anticipates more only when trust waiting list
deadlines loom.
At present the hospital has 48 general ward beds, the occupancy rate
of which has averaged out at 85% over the past three months. Taylor
reveals another 12 beds are to be opened shortly but will not be drawn
into giving exact patient numbers, saying only that other private
hospitals average a 50% occupancy rate.
The strategy for filling existing and new beds revolves around
attracting patients from the Middle East, using Abu Dhabi Investment's
contacts, and targeting the UK private medical care market rather than
the original over-seas scatter-gun approach. However, contacts in the
United States, it is added, are being kept warm.
Taylor says HCI intend to launch an aggressive UK advertising
campaign, extolling the hospital's medical virtues, in direct
competition to London's top private hospitals. Taylor claims the
palpable increase in private UK patients reinforces his belief that
patients are prepared to travel for quality treatment.
There has also, he adds, been an increase in the number of Arab
patients, all of whom have brought with them a retinue of relatives,
thus boosting the hotel side of the enterprise. That, incidentally, is
to be marketed to local businesses for use as a conference facility in
addition to the series of medical conferences to be held over the summer
in the hospital.
''The long-term objectives of HCI have not changed. We are
consolidating what we have and the results are there this time. We would
prefer to be a new company and we want to make this place a success. It
would be useful if people could separate us from the old HCI.''
Optimism about the future is echoed by anaesthetist Predeep Ramayya
who verifies that patient numbers are rising. He says a third theatre is
to be opened, a number of junior doctors have been recruited, and
outlines plans for a new cancer programme involving brachy therapy, a
type of radiation treatment.
''We are gearing up for more patient referrals. The whole thing has
changed completely, all the staff are really excited now. People need to
remember the receivership was last year.''
Marketing HCI to Middle Eastern patients is a challenge being tackled
by staff at Clydebank and by the hospital's Harley Street office, who
have been liaising with foreign health attaches.
As the worry beads whirr through his fingers, Taylor acknowledges that
HCI's new-found confidence relies as much on potential success of the
refined strategies as his current assertion that the number of Arab
patients is rising. Yes, he says, the new owners face a tough task but
their success must be judged on results, not the mistakes highlighted in
the receivers' report.

THE Scottish Conservative Party just now bears some resemblance to one
of the beasts in the Book of Revelation, with heads of different species
each talking at once, and each in a fashion more mysterious than the
last. They rise up out of rivers of fire and oceans of blood, which
recall the blasted electoral landscape. They all herald doom, but one
might have a message of salvation. The problem is to decide which.
Since the debacle of Perth and Kinross these heads have sprouted
vigorously, and my purpose here is to try to make some sense of what
they are saying. We can start with the guidance they are given from on
high, the official doctrine of the moment, that the Government is on the
right course but needs to improve its presentation.
That the course may well be right is demonstrated by nothing so much
as that the alternative government, of the Labour Party, proposes to
follow exactly the same course in most essentials, at least in fiscal
and monetary policy. That being so, then in Scotland some bolder
presentational stroke than any yet conceived will clearly be required to
draw the distinctions that remain between the Government and its
alternative.
Cool managerial competence at St Andrew's House is no longer enough
when Labour's snottier urchins have been taught by their leaders to wash
their faces and comb their hair, though angelic smiles still seem too
much for some of them.
The only proposed stroke to merit the description of boldness is that
the Scottish Conservatives should change their name back to Unionists,
the title which they in fact bore from 1912-1965 -- a period, I need
hardly add, of rather greater electoral success than they have been used
to since. The argument is that Scotland's self-serving political
opposition, with its hangers-on in the media and academe, consistently
underestimates for its own sinister purposes the real strength of
Unionism. At least one-fifth of the electorate rejects any
constitutional reform. If it came to the crunch, the proportion might
turn out to be higher still, enough to stop dead all change, as it did
in 1979. An explicitly Unionist party would rally this coherent block of
opinion, one of the largest we have.
The argument seems so persuasive that the reluctance to run with it
must be a bit of a puzzle. Perhaps one explanation is its source, which
I suspect to be a group of slightly power-crazed businessmen a little
too ready with writs for defamation, so I shall restrain myself from
further comment. The proposal was, however, one of those put to the
Prime Minister when he took stock after the last election, and came up
to meet the great and good at Bute House. Yet not a word of it was
breathed in the official document summarising the conclusions of that
exercise.
The party's name is, of course, a matter for itself rather than for
the state or the constitution, so an official document would not be the
proper place to talk about it. At the same time I am sure there is a
deeper reason for the reticence. It is that taking the title of Unionist
would represent, or certainly would be represented as, a lurch to the
right. And the most powerful men in the party want nothing of the kind.
Again it would be invidious to name names. But one may assume that
opposition to a lurch would start in the Cabinet, that it would cover
the lower ministerial ranks of the Scottish Office, that it would
comprehend higher officials of the party, stalwarts of its voluntary
organisations, and many candidates. It does not matter that the lurch
might actually be popular among activists, especially the younger ones.
In the Tory Party, such people are always there to be led rather than
followed.
For proof of these propositions we should look at those public
statements which the bigwigs have felt moved to make in the wake of
Perth and Kinross. They have risen in a confused, and sometimes not very
sensible, babble. If we have to sum them up in a single term, it might
be devolutionary, though in a sense stopping short of what everyone else
calls devolution.
What is not to be found among the bright ideas is any suggestion that
policy should lurch to the right, that the Scottish Conservative Party
should move from statism to individualism, from corporatism to
capitalism, as its sister in the South did so triumphantly during the
1980s. If the policy is not going to lurch to the right, there is
obviously no point in having the presentation lurch to the right either.
Some of the bigwigs take their line out of personal conviction: they
are One Nation Tories. Some fear, even yet, to offend the political
consensus in Scotland. Over and above that, however, they are preparing
and repairing their defences against the one lurch they may have to ride
out willy-nilly, the lurch that would land Michael Forsyth in St
Andrew's House as Secretary of State.
This depends on so many imponderables that for now one can only say it
is as likely as not. If it does happen, it will surely be followed by an
effort to shift from statism to individualism, and from corporatism to
capitalism. This was what Forsyth set out in his address to this year's
conference, potentially the major Scottish Conservative statement of the
decade. But the establishment is, in the usual coded fashion, making its
position clear. Amid these murky moves, the stage is being set for a
drama which could determine not only the party's but also the country's
future.

THE recent trend of declining property repossessions in Scotland could
be reversed as a result of Government cutbacks in mortgage interest tax
relief and income support for homeowners, the Council of Mortgage
Lenders warned yesterday.
John Urquhart, chairman of the Building Societies Association/CML
committee for Scotland, believes the recent cut in the rate of tax
relief to 15%, coupled with the state benefit reductions due this
autumn, will also cap house price rises in Scotland this year.
Figures contained in a report published by the council demonstrate
that the tax and income support changes will have a greater impact north
of the Border than in other parts of the UK.
A survey of mortgage lenders indicates that Scottish homeowners will
face average increases of 11.8% in repayments, taking into account the
MIRAS reduction and the cost of repayment insurance to cover the income
support withdrawal.
Only in Northern Ireland and Wales will owner-occupiers suffer a
greater increase in the cost of their mortgages.
The typical loan in Scotland, where house prices are only about 80% of
the national level, is closer to the MIRAS limit of #30,000 than the
average UK mortgage. This is why the Scots will be among the hardest
hit.
Last year, the number of repossessions in Scotland, which generally
avoided the negative equity trap which blighted the South, fell from
2330 to 1791.
Running at only 0.22% of the number of outstanding mortgages,
Scotland's repossession rate is less than half of the national one.
Although he does not expect the MIRAS and income support changes to
prevent the number of repossessions falling again this year, Mr Urquhart
said: ''I have my concerns that these changes are going to see a reverse
of that trend in 1996.''
The council, which continues to fight the proposed reductions in
income support, does not believe the private sector is rushing to plug
the gap with offers of suitable insurance products.
On the outlook for house prices in Scotland, which were essentially
flat last year, Mr Urquhart said: ''While the underlying factors
affecting the housing market in Scotland remain positive, the cutbacks
in mortgage interest tax relief and income support are likely to be felt
more heavily in Scotland than in some other parts of the UK.
''It is, therefore, unlikely that owner-occupation or house prices
will rise significantly in Scotland in 1995, although longer-term
prospects are stronger.''

IT WAS probably unwise of us to send troops into Bosnia in the first
place, and many people said so at the time. We all know the old truth
that it is much easier to go in to such a situation than to get out
again, and there are few examples of a civil war ended by outside
intervention.
But even if it was unwise from a rational point of view, that does not
mean it was wrong to do so. Indeed, even looked at from today's
perspective when there is no sign of it ending, it looks like a most
commendable and generous action on our part. We have very little
commercial or selfish interest in getting involved in a conflict which
does not directly threaten us. Why then did we do it, and are the
reasons as strong today as they were four years ago?
We decided to send troops in for three main reasons. First, the United
Nations asked us to go in; secondly, the mission was not to fight a war
against anyone, but to save life and alleviate hardship among civilians
of all sides; thirdly, and most potently, most of us in Britain could
bear no longer to watch such cruelty and misery being inflicted upon
innocent people without doing something about it.
Fortunately, we were joined by our French allies and contingents from
many other countries.
We have jointly achieved much. Thousands of lives have been saved, and
many thousands of people have been fed and sheltered throughout the
hardships of war and bitter weather. Although the civil war still rages
it has been to some extent stabilised by our presence. We have also been
able to exercise a formidable diplomatic influence both in New York and
on the ground in Bosnia.
Parliament, to its great credit, has showed strong unanimity in
supporting the sending of more troops. I believe they are truly
reflecting the views of the majority of people in the country in this.
It is clear that substantially more troops will be a great help in
protecting those we have there already. I hope it will be made crystal
clear that although their role is entirely defensive and humanitarian,
they will react very strongly if they are threatened with any form of
attack. We owe it to them to leave no doubt in anyone's mind about that.
Clear rules of engagement can be a soldier's lifeline in a crisis.
THE extra forces do, of course, give us the means to withdraw if we
ever have to do so, but I welcome the Prime Minister's statement that
this is not an option at present. I hope it will not be contemplated
unless events make it impossible for us to carry out our humanitarian
mission.
Commendable resolve is being shown and it must now continue through a
very difficult period that lies ahead. Great restraint will be needed,
whatever the provocation, if the hostages are to be released unharmed.
That is priority number one. Thereafter, we must use our greatly
increased strength to press on with our humanitarian mission. We cannot
expect much thanks, but such tasks are a particular and long-standing
British skill.
Which leads me to three last thoughts.
British servicemen and women are better than any others at this sort
of work. We are better trained and we have had plenty of practice. It is
a special way that we, a small country, can make a unique contribution
to world peace.
Secondly, and partly because of this, we are fully justified in
keeping our permanent place on the Security Council of the United
Nations. None of the other nations who aspire to replace us have
anything like our track record in responsible action in peace-keeping
outside our own area.
Finally, here is yet another example of a completely unexpected task
for which we need well-trained and well-equipped forces. It shows again
how we must never let our forces be cut to a level where we would be
unable to undertake these tasks. We are quite nearly down to the minimum
level already and there may be future internal battles ahead to ensure
we lose no more.
The world would be a much less safe place without us.

Michael Tumelty heralds the advent of a new star in the firmament of
international opera
SHE'S diminutive. She's irrepressibly effervescent. She won't sing
Verdi or Puccini. There's nobody alive who can sing Rossini like she
can. She's the first authentic superstar mezzo-soprano of her
generation. She's only 28. And she's here.
Tonight, Cecilia Bartoli, the gorgeous, bubbling dynamo of a mezzo who
has swept critics and an adoring public before her, makes her Scottish
debut in Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall.
Not even the looming omnipresence in the past five years of a
tripartite juggernaut of tenors has overshadowed the unstoppable rise of
the vivacious and outstandingly talented Bartoli. Compared with her
crackling, electric presence and exuberant volatility, the Big Three are
monolithic.
''La Stupenda'', she has been dubbed by the legendary Dame Joan
Sutherland. ''The Golden Age of singing isn't dead,'' wrote one
commentator: ''it was just waiting for Cecilia Bartoli to come along and
rescue it.'' That she has not only rescued but revivified a Golden Age
has been reflected in the awards showered upon her by the industry in
the past three years: Top Recording Artist and Singer of the Year in
1992; Artist of the Year and Top Selling Classical Artist in 1993;
Female Classical Artist of the Year in 1994.
And the industry is not alone. She has been besieged by her public who
have snapped up her records like water in a drought. The sheer number of
recordings she has undertaken has been astounding, the level of their
success even more so. In 1993 five of her recordings were simultaneously
in the top 15 best-selling classical albums. Last year she turned up at
Tower Records in New York for an autograph session, was swamped by
thousands of fans, and stayed for five hours, signing discs.
So who is the world's newest and starriest diva? What has she got?
Where did she get it from? And where is she going?
Cecilia Bartoli was born in Rome and born to music. Both her parents
were opera singers -- the marriage was stormy, they separated and,
according to daughter Cecilia, their friendship improved from that
moment.
Young Bartoli -- a natural talent -- made her operatic debut at the
Teatro dell'Opera in Rome at the age of either eight or nine (depending
on which version of the story you believe) singing the offstage shepherd
in Tosca. And she has spent the rest of her life to date explaining
patiently that she wasn't a child prodigy: ''It was a one-off; I was
finished at eight.''
In fact her aspirations lay in another direction altogether. Her
passion and ambition lay in flamenco dancing, which she studied and
intended to make her career, shifting away only in the light of a
paucity of demand for castaneted flamenco dancers in Italy. Er . . .
good idea, wrong country.
She didn't begin formal musical studies until she was 17. But the real
source of her astonishing skill -- her technical and musical abilities
are breathtaking -- was her mother, her only singing teacher, who
basically let her away with nothing.
The explanation, Bartoli has said, is quite straightforward. Whereas
most singers see their teacher for, at best, a couple of hours a day,
she was at home, with her mother, all the time. Life was one unending
lesson -- even when singing in the bathroom Bartoli would hear her
mother bellowing: ''Non e giusta.'' ''That's not right.''
She was introduced to the Italian public on a TV variety show
presented by two international operatic stars, Katia Ricciarelli and Leo
Nucci. But the real discovery of Bartoli, which launched her
stratospheric rise to stardom, happened in several stages.
On another TV show, from the Paris Opera, Bartoli was singing in a
gala concert dedicated to another great mezzo, Maria Callas. She sang,
prophetically, and with a wee fairy tale touch, an aria from Rossini's
Cinderella. The prince watching this show was the great conductor and
pianist Daniel Barenboim. He was completely bowled over by Bartoli,
sought her out, and immediately engaged her to sing at an orchestral
concert in Paris.
Barenboim conducted her in Rossini arias, then moved to the piano,
accompanying her in Mozart -- her other great specialism. He promptly
engaged her to sing in the Mozart Requiem.
The old dictator of the Berlin Philharmonic, Herbert von Karajan,
asked Bartoli to audition for him. He, too, immediately engaged her to
sing in the Bach B Minor Mass at Salzburg in 1990. Karajan coached her,
but died before the performance took place.
Perhaps the seminal element in her development, however, was her
discovery by Christopher Raeburn, senior producer to Decca Records.
Decca intended to record a new version of Rossini's Barber of Seville,
was determined to find an Italian mezzo to sing Rosina, and sent Raeburn
off to Italy.
He heard Bartoli at audition, and recognised immediately ''a fully
developed and complete, finished, artist.'' Crucially -- and this is
central to Bartoli's art -- Raeburn recognised also her highly
individual sense of presence. His discovery, above all, set the alarm
bells ringing throughout the industry. And the rest, as they say, is
history.
The list of conductors who have sought to work with her reads like a
litany of the great: Claudio Abbado, Riccardo Muti, James Levine, Sir
Georg Solti, Christoph von Dohnanyi, Charles Dutoit. She has sung with
the Berlin Phil, the Vienna Phil, Chicago and Montreal Symphony
Orchestras, and countless others. She has appeared in opera at La Scala,
Milan, the Opera Bastille de Paris, the Salzburg Festival, the Vienna
State Opera, and many more.
Opera-house demand for her is insatiable. Last year the Metropolitan
Opera of New York was reported to be ''on its knees'' begging her to
appear. The demand is reflected in her income. Industry sources reported
that her first US tour in 1991 netted around $80,000 (#50,000). Within
three years that had risen more than tenfold to over $850,000
(#550,000).
Obscene money? Of course; though I suppose she is a voice in a
million. There is every tone colour on the palette in that voice. She
can be dusky and sexy, impish and coquettish; though a mezzo, she can
soar to a height that some sopranos would kill for.
She has brought new meaning to the concept of clarity of expression
and articulation. And she has a vibrant presence and an infectious sense
of enjoyment that are the antithesis of the dour, joyless performance
staged earlier this year in Glasgow by another diva, Maria Ewing.
She knows her limitation -- she does not have a huge voice, and won't
sing the great Verdi and Puccini romantic heroines. At Rossini and
Mozart she is unparalleled. But what the world is waiting for is the
moment Bartoli decides that the time is right to take on the ultimate
mezzo role: that of Carmen. It should be incendiary (and the old
flamenco lessons will find an appropriate outlet).
In the meantime, she is going to cut back in 1996. She wants time for
living, ''time to enjoy''. Which, for a glamorous young woman, a sports
car fanatic who, as a teenage ragazza, hightailed it to Paris for an
adventure, singing in the streets to raise money, and who, as an
international opera star, is not exactly reputed to spend her time in
between shows moping in a hotel room, shouldn't be too difficult. Viva
la diva.
* Cecilia Bartoli: Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow. Tonight, 7.30pm.

NOW, don't get me wrong. I'm pro-choice, always have been, always will
be. When it comes to fundamental human rights I'm ready -- if someone
could just promise to give me an alarm call please -- to take up
placards and defend the principle of options, whether it be an
upper-case principle -- a Pro-Choice women's right to choose in the
abortion debate -- or a lower-case principle -- a pro-choice non-violent
direct-action campaign against my favourite soap operas being programmed
against each other.
Admittedly, it's commitment which wanes somewhat in the face of fox
hunters, National Front supporters, and people who wear pastel Pringles,
but generally I'm a kinda' laissez-faire, anything-goes, different
strokes for different folks sort of gal.
But too much choice can be simply too much. In principle I love the
idea of increased access to television channels, multi-hued tins of
emulsion covering every possible variation of the colour spectrum and a
few besides, and 355 different fonts on my computer, but in practice I
find it bloody confusing, and oh-so time-consuming.
Of late I've felt this alarming nostalgia for a time when exotic meant
57 varieties of Heinz (mmm, shall I heat up the lentil or tomato or be
real reckless and open the mulligatawny?) and long for simplicity in my
supermarket. For someone as desperate to be trendy as my sweet sad self
this is dangerously Luddite.
I first spotted the symptoms during a television advertisement
campaign for Coca-Cola. In the advert a young family are driving along a
dusty American highway and stop at a warehouse hyperstore. They enter
and follow Identikit families around, purchasing blandly packaged goods
bearing only product, not brand, names. The mood is one of sombre black
and white austerity; colour only enters their lives when they pick up a
hitch hiker who produces some cans of bright red, boldly emblazoned
Coke.
A media-sophisticate and self-proclaimed ad-junkie, I got this one
well wrong. When the family stepped into that bland superstore I didn't
think they had entered an identity-vacuum hell, as you were clearly
supposed to think. Instead I spotted a glimpse of heaven, a celestial
oasis of perfectly ordered, clearly labelled goods. I wanted to shop
there. It looked simple, it looked quick.
Shopping makes me shudder and ideally I would zoom around my local
supermarket, gathering my sporadic supplies, but I don't. I drift;
confronted by its treasure trove of choice I become helplessly marooned,
a slave to indecision. I can't for the life of time understand why so
many of my generations have become Haagen Daas addicts. By the time I've
pondered what type of terrifyingly sweet flavour to favour -- Baileys
Irish Cream? -- I've come to my calorific-conscious senses and moved on
towards the low-fat yoghurts, where I pre-empt similar meanderings by
simply grabbing a pack of the supermarket's own brand.
Ice cream indecision is as nothing, however, compared with detergents.
My personal bete noire is soap powder. When did that become so
difficult? When did boxes of Persil suddenly breed and spawn 24
children?
I've had enough problems trying to work out my politics without
wasting time pursuing the endless varieties of soap powder most stores
sell. I already have enough worries without getting into an angst about
whether to opt for biological or non-biological, colour or non-colour,
powder, concentrate, or liquid. Supermarkets slyly dignify this
ridiculous consumer farce by proferring ''helpful'' little notices,
pompously explaining the differences between biological and
non-biological (using jargon which leaves you none the wiser), as if the
shelves of soap powder were some sort of museum exhibit.
Even worse is a trip to the chemist, where you need a chemistry degree
to decide what kind of moisturiser to buy. The beauty product
manufacturers believe in blinding us with science and get away with
marketing the same basic product under different labels: I can't for the
life of me decide what Hydra-Tricella Tri-Activating Hydration Cream
actually is and the only difference I can discern between bath and
shower gel and ''Revitalising Body Cleanser'' is the price tag.
'Course we suckers cough up: most women will happily take out a second
mortgage to buy anything with AHA's in it (that's Alpha Hydrox Acids,
folks). The latest scam is ''post-sport beauty products'' -- ordinary
soap and shampoo is no longer cool in the lockers. If you want to
impress the folks at aerobics it's now de rigueur to have a holdall
crammed with nonsense like Ralph Lauren Polo Sport Face and Body Soap,
or Body Drench Tone and Sports Lotion.
But for me the worst example of this proliferation of endless choices
is the recent craze for flavoured vodkas. The bar at the top of my main
street actually offers over 100 different types of vodka which sound
cool, until you glance at their list. I ask you, what kind of society is
so bored and desperate for something new that it comes up with Macaroon
Bar vodka. And what kind of state do you have to be in to buy it?

A SCHOOL cleaner who challenged Grampian Regional Council and a
private contractor when, under privatisation, she was threatened with a
cut in her rate of pay and a reduction in her hours and holidays,
yesterday received #10,000 compensation.
It has taken Mrs Phyllis Kelman more than two years to win her case
and it has cost her trade union, Unison, more than #30,000, but both
were celebrating what they believe is a legal ruling which has
implications for thousands of public sector workers whose jobs are being
contracted out or privatised.
Mrs Kelman, 53, was a supervisor earning #4.04 an hour and had been
with the council for seven years when a #600,000 contract for school
cleaning in Kincardine and Deeside was awarded to Care Contract Services
(CCS) of Yorkshire in December 1992.
According to Unison the firm then contravened the European Union's
Acquired Rights Directive by cutting the pay and conditions of the 180
school cleaners whose jobs were privatised.
Mrs Kelman refused to accept the conditions and asked her union to
fight her case.
In February 1993 the union went to the Court of Session but lost. It
then went to an industrial tribunal but lost there too. It took the case
to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which took the view that Mrs Kelman
had been unfairly dismissed.
Yesterday she received her #10,000 compensation, paid by Grampian
region and CCS.
Mr Bob Thomson, Unison associate general secretary, said: ''This is a
marvellous day for many low-paid workers like Mrs Kelman who have been
short-changed by privatisation.
''The decision by the Employment Appeals Tribunal means that the jobs,
pay, and conditions of thousands of Scottish public sector employees
must be protected if their work is put out to tender.
''This momentous ruling exposes the shambles of the Government's
privatisation policy. Compulsory Competitive Tendering has caused upset
and anxiety among staff in the public sector and has been a very costly
process for local councils.
''Grampian councillors and chief officials made a gross error of
judgment in awarding the school cleaning contract to Care Contract
Services. Despite Unison's warnings to the contrary, they meekly
submitted to the Government's erroneous view that European law did not
apply in this case.
''Mrs Kelman's victory demonstrates the value of trade union
protection at work. Her case cost Unison in the region of #30,000 in
legal expenses. Legal aid would not have been available to Mrs Kelman
and she would have been unable to pursue her case without her union's
backing.
''However, we should not forget the other cleaners who were sacked.
Most of them were not members of a trade union and have been denied
justice.''
Mr David Stevenson, the lawyer who acted for Mrs Kelman on behalf of
Unison, said local government employees had faced the upset of CCT over
the past five years.
''The message is still coming forth from the Government and other
places that the protection of employment which is conferred on employees
by this European directive will not necessarily apply to local
government employees.
''The position as advised by Unison and its legal advisers is that it
does and should.
''Unison is currently heavily involved in a campaign that it should
apply, and Mrs Kelman's case is an illustration of the costs of refusing
to accept that position.''
Grampian's convener, Mrs Rhona Kemp, said that the council had had no
wish to put its services out to tender.
''This was forced upon us by Government legislation and we were
obliged to accept the lowest tender.
''We had no option but to do the Government's bidding and now we are
being left holding the financial baby. It is Government regulations
which have been found wanting and if they had any honour the Government
would accept responsibility for the consequence.''
CCS eventually pulled out of the contract. Mrs Kelman now works
full-time at a hotel in Banchory.

Elizabeth Buie assesses the chances of a policy breakthrough for
conservationists at the fourth North Sea Ministers' conference in
Esbjerg
EXPECTATIONS always ride high on the eve of an event such as the North
Sea Ministers' conference, which opens tomorrow.
The environmentalists prepare their wish-lists, lobby sympathetic
participants, and proclaim loudly that unless their demands are met,
doom and disaster will inevitably follow.
In reality, some measured progress is probably the best that can be
hoped for, given the business and governmental interests involved. To
eradicate pollution from the North Sea and put in place the
wide-sweeping fishery conservation measures that many would like to see
is undoubtedly asking too much of the illusory collective will of some
of the most industrialised nations of Western Europe.
Britain goes into the conference in Esbjerg, in Denmark, already
labelled the Dirty Man of Europe by some environmental pressure groups.
According to Greenpeace, Britain fares worse than any other country
for atmospheric emissions, emissions of organic substances, and has
unsatisfactory policies on hazardous waste, dioxin reduction and risk
assessment.
The UK's Environment Secretary, John Gummer, can expect to face
criticism from Denmark, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and the
European Commission for giving approval to Shell to dump the Brent Spar
oil platform at sea. But, after all, it was partly in an attempt to
embarrass the UK at this conference that Greenpeace embarked on its
expensive occupation of the abandoned platform in the first place.
Britain also stands accused by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) of
having met only a few of its commitments to reduce pollution. It is also
criticised for being the only country that still allows the use of
oil-based muds for drilling, which can devastate marine life around oil
and gas rigs. It is also the only country still dumping sewage sludge
into the sea.
And there is more. Of the 16 groups of pesticides recognised by the
Hague Declaration as particularly hazardous for the health of the sea
and identified for complete elimination by 1995, only three have been
completely phased out. The UK has phased out six groups of pesticides,
compared with Germany's eight, and Norway, Denmark and Sweden, which
have phased out 10.
Scientists believe that man-made chemicals affect marine life, leading
to contaminated fish and shellfish, poor fish breeding success, human
health hazards such as skin and eye irritations and gastro-intestinal
illness, problems with the reproductive performance of all marine life,
and overall damage to the eco-system. WWF warns that unless drastic
reductions are agreed at this week's conference -- with full commitment,
proper enforcement and regular monitoring -- the damage to marine life
could lead to the collapse of the food chain that sustains fisheries.
As for the fish themselves, conservationists argue that while
fishermen are fighting for their jobs, fish are fighting for their
lives. The WWF claims that in January, reports showed that the stock of
sole in the Channel, and cod and mackerel in the North Sea had all
reached or fallen below ''safe biological levels'' -- any lower and
extinction could follow.
As part of their concern for the future of all fisheries,
conservationists want to see an end to damaging forms of industrial
fishing such as sand-eel fishing around Shetland.
The conference is unlikely to bring about any drastic changes to
fisheries policies as long as the current EU Common Fisheries Policy is
in place. Spain, one of the greediest fishing nations, has only observer
status at the conference, not being a country that borders on the North
Sea (paradoxically, Switzerland is a permanent member of the conference
group, despite having no coastline.)
For its part, the UK Government makes no pretence of expecting major
shifts in policy to emerge by the end of this week. The Department of
the Environment said last month that there were still ''a few areas'' in
which the North Sea states still needed to make significant progress
''taking account of work in other international forums and under other
initiatives''.
In a written parliamentary answer, Mr Gummer said his priorities would
be the protection of species and habitats, in line with the EU Habitats
Directive; modifying fisheries, especially industrial fisheries
policies, again under the EU; working on the prevention of pollution by
hazardous substances; further reduction of nutrient inputs to the North
Sea, an area in which he claimed the UK did not contribute to problems;
and pollution prevention from shipping and offshore installations,
although he proposed to stick to the UK's position of making
case-by-case decisions on the abandonment of oil rigs.
A DoE spokesman added: ''But, given past progress, the fourth North
Sea conference will mainly be reviewing progress, consolidating past
achievements and considering how to press forward with the
implementation of the agreed, binding European legislation and
international conventions.''
A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)
said that it felt that Mr Gummer was making ''the right sort of noises''
and that in fact Britain was ''in the front of the van'' when it came to
trying to drive policy forward. But he still remained sceptical that
action would be forthcoming. The UK makes much of the need for research
in a number of areas -- the hard part is going to be translating
research findings into significant changes in policy.

A LIBERAL Democrat candidate, who lost her election battle by one
vote, will have to wait another week for a historic legal ruling on her
political future.
Sheriff Principal Gordon Nicholson deferred judgment after hearing
evidence at a special election court in Jedburgh yesterday.
He was told the April victory of independent, Mr Tom Dobson, in
elections for the Scottish Borders Council came after four recounts and
a decision by the returning officer.
Borders region chief executive, Mr Kenneth Clark, ruled two ballot
papers cast for Liberal Democrat, Mrs Pat Miller, had not been stamped
by polling station officials and were therefore invalid. What would have
been a one vote win for Mrs Miller became a one vote defeat.
Yesterday, Mrs Miller's agent, Mr Jamie Gilmour, submitted that, while
Mr Clark could have taken no other action on the night, the situation
was against natural justice and had no precedence in Scots law.
Mr Gilmour claimed that either the seat should be transferred
immediately to Mrs Miller or be fought again.
For the returning officer, Mr Ian Wilkie said the court had no power
to transfer the seat. The only alternative to upholding the decision was
a by-election.
The sheriff principal adjourned the hearing and said he would deliver
his judgment next Wednesday. He asked Mr Dobson if he had anything to
say. He replied: ''Only that if the position had been reversed, I would
have accepted the vote gracefully.''
When Mrs Miller's agent raised the question of costs -- estimated at
#3000 -- the sheriff principal queried responsibility from lawyers
consulted on Mrs Miller's behalf by Borders Liberal Democrat MP, Mr
Archy Kirkwood.

AN international criminal court would not be a practicable solution to
the Lockerbie case, Scotland's top law officer said yesterday.
Lord Rodger, the Lord Advocate, said any such court was ''inevitably
some considerable time away''.
He was responding to a call from Mr Ross Harper, president of the
International Law Association. Mr Harper had maintained that it would
ensure that those who perpetrated crimes against humanity could be
brought to justice.
It would be a mechanism for enforcing human rights and provide a forum
to try Lockerbie-type cases as well as those accused of war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Harper will put forward a resolution to create an international
criminal court at the council of the association in Edinburgh next week.
Yesterday, Lord Rodger, who received notice of the motion from Mr
Harper, said he considered that, whatever its jurisdiction and whatever
states might accept that jurisdiction, such a court did not represent a
practicable solution to any current case such as Lockerbie.
''The United Nations Security Council has made it clear that what is
required is surrender of the two accused for trial in Scotland or the
United States and it is up to Libya to take the necessary steps to make
them available.''
The United Nations has been considering whether to establish a
permanent international criminal court and has agreed to set up an ad
hoc working committee.
The British Government has voiced serious reservations about giving
such a court jurisdiction over crimes of terrorism.

THE public services union Unison has called on the new unitary
councils to wage a fresh campaign over the impact of compulsory
competitive tendering on services during reorganisation.
Unison believes there will be enormous disruption to council services
if the Tories' timetable for the resumption of tendering is not relaxed.
Under the Government's plans, contracts would start being awarded by
the new councils in April 1997. However, Mr Mark Irvine, Unison's head
of local government in Scotland, said this would get in the way of the
need to maintain the present level of services to the public.
''The Tories were wiped off the map at the council elections in
April,'' he said. ''At the time, the Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
admitted his Government would have to listen more closely to the views
of the Scottish people or face years in the political wilderness.''
Mr Irvine said a serious debate about the decentralisation of services
was not possible unless Mr Lang was prepared to think again over the
timetable for tendering.
Unison has written to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities,
calling for a fresh approach to be made to the Scottish Office to demand
a review of the situation on CCT.
The letter calls for a longer moratorium to allow the new councils to
concentrate on maintaining service delivery and to consult properly on
proposals for decentralisation.

AN Aberdeen woman has been awarded #4500 compensation from her former
employer for racial discrimination.
Mrs Mercy Moyo of Powis Circle, Aberdeen, a native of Zimbabwe,
resigned from her job at the Mark One store in Aberdeen's Bon Accord
Centre last September after being told she was ''smelly'' and given a
can of deodorant.
She told an industrial tribunal yesterday that after the incident she
was singled out for special treatment in the way her handbag was
searched when she left the shop. Mrs Moyo also claimed she wasn't given
training which would have let her seek promotion.
The tribunal heard that on August 11 last year, Miss Linda Logan took
up an appointment as manager at the shop.
Eight days later, Miss Logan approached Mrs Moyo and asked her if she
used a deodorant as the fitting rooms were ''somewhat smelly''.
Mrs Moyo was distressed by what she saw as a public criticism of her
personal hygiene.
The tribunal also heard that prior to Miss Logan's appointment as
store manager, 21% of the store staff were from ethnic minorities. After
August 10, the equivalent figure was 7% and by the end of 1994 there
were no minority-group employees.
In finding for Mrs Moyo, the tribunal stated: ''It appeared to us to
be plain on the evidence that Aberdeen staff members of ethnic minority
groups were, as a class, treated less favourably than others.
''Much of the blame for that was attributed to Miss Logan and, in our
opinion, on the evidence she had to accept that.
''We considered it legitimate to draw the inference that the failure
to offer Mrs Moyo training on the tills was on the ground of her race.''
The tribunal also noted that, on the day the remark had been made
about Mrs Moyo's personal hygiene, no customer's complaint was recorded,
although it was alleged that the matter was raised only because of such
a complaint.
Witnesses for Mrs Moyo, who worked in the shop, said there had never
been any problem with her personal hygiene.
The tribunal noted: ''It was therefore surprising that Miss Logan said
the smell was so strong it made her 'sick to her stomach' and that it
was not confined to the fitting rooms but could be detected wherever Mrs
Moyo went in the shop.''
In awarding Mrs Moyo #4500, the tribunal added: ''Having watched and
listened to Mrs Moyo give evidence, we were satisfied that she took care
of her appearance and was particular about her personal hygiene.''

THE number of offenders given community work as an alternative to
imprisonment fell by 460 in 1993, said a report published yesterday by
the Scottish Office.
The report of the working of community service schemes showed that
5655 offenders -- 5211 male and 444 female -- were ordered to undertake
this work, compared with 6115 in 1992.
The total was made up of 4745 offenders given community service orders
and 910 placed on probation with community work as a condition.
The length of community service requirement which may be imposed
varies from 40 to 240 hours. The largest number of orders (1637) were in
the 101-150 hours range.
The age distribution of offenders ranged from 16 to more than 41, with
1627 offenders aged 21-25 and 1487 aged 18-20.
A breakdown of the 5655 orders in terms of crimes and offences showed
that the leading categories were dishonesty (2067), motor vehicle
offences (1137), and violence (696).

ANNE ELLIS reports on a display showing the Wright way to design
buildings
AN EXHIBITION being staged at the Design Museum, London, Frank Lloyd
Wright: The Chicago Years, provides a rare opportunity to experience the
work of one of America's architectural giants. A comprehensive survey of
photographs, drawings, paintings, stained glass, and furnishings from
the innovative Prairie houses to the imposing and substantial 1915
Imperial Hotel, Tokyo -- one of the very few structures in that city
built well enough to withstand the great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 --
have been transported across the Atlantic.
The Larkin Administration Building of 1901, an 'industrial cathedral'
dedicated to mass production, is represented by an office desk made of
metal with a chair attached on a swinging arm arrangement which allowed
the office girls to accomplish repetitive tasks as swiftly and with as
little physical effort as possible.
Surprisingly enough, it is an example from the massive hotel in Tokyo
which is used to demonstrate his ability to design on a smaller scale,
an oak stand, less than 2 feet high, framed at the top to accommodate a
Japanese print, and shelved at the bottom to take a delicately arranged
vase of flowers.
The exhibition is full of interesting details which help to explain
the man: photographs of his family include the formidable aunts who ran
his progressive day school, his very ambitious mother who knew from his
time in the womb that her son was going to be a famous architect, and
his uncle's farm where he learned to love nature and where he devised a
way to convert that love into meaningful symbols. Other more
architectural influences are also represented, Sullivan and Adler,
Violet-le Duc who wrote ''the only truly sensible book on
architecture'', Owen Jones' Grammar of Ornament, and Ruskin's Seven
Lamps of Architecture, given to him by the Aunts.
''The reality of the building does not consist of walls and roof but
in the space within''. Chairs and tables reflect the shifting horizontal
planes of the buildings they inhabited: they also represent Wright's
struggle to produce an interior style which responded both to the
demands of form and function. ''My early approach to chairs was
something between contempt and desperation.''
Colourful stained glass panels contradict the notion of austerity. And
a well-illustrated text explains the drama at Taliesin when a crazed
servant set fire to the building after axing Mamah Cheney and six other
residents.
The undoubted quirkiness of the man is defined, but not so that it
obscures the importance of his designs and their effects, on succeeding
generations. The Design Museum with its changing displays of the
milestones of design history provides an ideal setting. It is also next
door to some of the most interesting and appetising riverside eating
houses.

THE individual character of William McCance has seen him separated
from his Glasgow contemporaries and promoted as ''one of the foremost
modern Scottish artists''. Yet it is only by considering his experiences
as a student of Fra (Francis) Newbery, in Glasgow, his morals as a
conscientious objector, and his involvement in English art, that we can
really understand the art of William McCance.
A work like Portrait of an American (Joseph Brewer) 1925, shows his
interest in form and composition. Concerns shared by his Glasgow Art
School contemporaries, in particular James Cowie, Robert Sivell, John C
Lamont, Archibald A McGlashan, and the sculptor Benno Schotz.
Like his contemporaries, McCance does not deny the human presence of
Brewer, a clue to his humanism, his interest in the three dimensions of
sculpture is shown in this work, and the tubular style is related to
English, not Scottish, stylistic concerns. It is with McCance's art
criticism in the Spectator that we can understand the artistic
connection between him and his contemporaries in Glasgow.
His views on academic and modern art give an insight into the values
gained from his art school training in Glasgow. In an article on Frank
Brangwyn in 1924, McCance identifies the qualities of Brangwyn's art, as
a ''vehement and impressive enough gesture in the theatre of art as it
is constructed today . . . a high water mark of academic art . . .
vigorous naturalistic movement and exuberance of his handling of
brushfuls of colour . . . showing an analysis of Rubens, Tiepolo, Hals,
Tintorretto, Giorgione, Titian, and Whistler . . . ''.
But Brangwyn, adds McCance, is not a great artist ''for it required
more than the exploitation of certain combinations from the past to make
him worthy of distinction'' (June 14, 1924).
He applies the same rigorous standards in his criticism of the
moderns. He does find value in the way Cezanne ''communicates his
conceptions'' (July 18, 1925). In Picasso he identifies ''if not a new
way of looking at nature, at least a fresh outlook on art'' (February
13, 1926). He finds much wrong with the new fashions and is very
critical of followers of Cezanne and Picasso ''who pick the bones of
Cezanne's technique to provide a covering for their own sterility of
conception'' (July 12, 1925).
McCance pulls no punches when he describes Matisse as a ''devastating
and evil influence on modern art, whose contribution to art undermines
the craftmanship of the masters . . . when in doubt introduce a
meandering line'' (January 23, 1926).
These criticisms must be set in the context of McCance's own art
training, where art was judged by the form and composition of the Old
Masters. Later he grew to appreciate Matisse.
Although ruthlessly critical, McCance does set a standard in art.
''Brangwyn's academic art, however successful its applied technique,
lacks vision.'' By that he meant ''the picture nobly conceived and
painfully brought to light, will always remain more vital than the mere
irresolute sally in manipulation'' (June 14, 1924).
McCance warns that the modernists ''merely bring to art a number of
futile tricks of the trade'' so involved in technique that they ''may
have forgotten what it was they wanted to say'' (June 14, 1924).
Technique and design do not on their own create a work of art.
McCance points out the need for conception, vision, and nobility of
subject which an artist can only achieve ''once an artist has learned
how to draw accurately and well and is ready to compose and construct''.
These skills then ''mellowed, co-ordinated and defined in his mind are
used on a subject matter that has been nobly enough felt for it to
penetrate beyond the bounds of personal prejudice into the deeper and
more universalised springs of pure emotion'' (December 20, 1924).
The artist had to be contemplative, sensitive, and objective with
an understanding of the importance of design and construction. These are
the values that McCance shared with his contemporaries from Glasgow.
These views are for me the starting point of a critical revision of
McCance and his contemporaries' values. Values which will reveal a
distinct quality to Scottish art.

University of Aberdeen. This is a reply to a Weekender article by
Patrick Elliot on William McCance published on May 27.

Actor Tam Dean Burn's search for a new audience is taking him
off-stage, writes John Linklater, and includes a performance at an
Edinburgh night club.
TAM suits him, though he was christened Thomas, got Tom at primary
school, and Wee Tommy at home. For an actor, the Dean Burn parts of the
family name turned out to be a gift, even if they flaunted his youthful
hero-worship of James Dean, and borrowed a ring from screen star Harry
Dean Stanton. Put it all together, though, as he first did at drama
school, and Tam Dean Burn has a singular strength of its own.
He had experimented with every other variation, which might suggest a
narcissism that is out of character, but he remains a searching kind of
artist. His development of a character for performance can take a long
time, but once he finds it he takes big leaps. It has been the same with
the kind of theatre he wants to make. When people are asked to describe
what it is like to work with him, the word ''commitment'' always comes
up. Yet his career has been so diverse, from the Royal National Theatre
to improvising blind with the traffic on the streets of Edinburgh, that
it is difficult to isolate a motivating goal.
Perhaps one is emerging in the three latest projects with which he is
involved. The common thread is that both are devised to take theatre out
of itself. The first, Hill, a further outing for his James Joyce persona
with director Kenny Davidson, is out in the Big Wood at Cathkin Braes on
midsummer's night, and the audience will be bused in free. The second,
Stormy Waters, with director Kenny Farquhar, will be seen beside the
cranes of Govan Shipyard on the banks of the Clyde on July 21 and 22,
with part of the audience participating through the internet. The third,
Come On, with director John Paul McGroarty, will be in an Edinburgh
night club at the heart of the techno and house music scene during the
Festival, and the audience will be mainly clubbers and members of the
E-generation.
For a man about to turn 37, an age when members of his profession
begin to seek security, he is manoeuvring around and beyond the
mainstream. This reflects an apparent infidelity with the kind of
theatre that could keep him in a comfortable living, though he has drawn
ample experience from it, and has never been known to sell himself short
because he accepted a part at the Royal Lyceum (where he is still a
regular) or Perth (where he started out). In fact he has worked at one
time or another with most of the established companies in Scotland, only
to slip away again.
He summarises it as a search for a new audience, one with which he
finds it easier to relate on a personal basis. ''It comes back to the
question of, would my friends get anything from it?'' he reflects.
''It's the whole social layer I'm involved with, mix with, and club
with. They don't go to theatre. So, we're grappling with something that
is theatre-based but appeals to people who know that theatre is not for
them, involving them either as an audience or as participating
performers. It's as much about unleashing the talents and abilities of
the people we live amongst, as about expressing ourselves as artists.''
McGroarty, his collaborator in the Come On project for Damage
Productions, says: ''If there's to continue to be a fringe movement in
this country it will come outwith the buildings and institutions. This
is not fringe anymore. It is underground, but it is also moving into the
wider cultural sphere. And if Scottish theatre is going to mean anything
in the next 10 years it is going to need actors like Tam Dean Burn.''
As an actor who has worked closely with Steven Berkoff (on Sink the
Belgrano, after acting in the Scottish premieres of East and Greek for
TAG), with James Kelman (in Hardie and Baird: The Last Days) and with
Irvine Welsh (on Headstates), Burn has no reason to be particularly
overawed or over-flattered by the attentions of young Scottish
directors. Yet it is to them that he is quickest to respond.
Kenny Davidson approached him for what has become a series of
enterprising adaptations from Finnegans Wake for Process (Ten28),
performed in Glasgow, Transylvania and Ohio. Primarily he wanted an
actor who would look like James Joyce, and Tam Dean Burn's shaved head
and lean features are something of a blank canvas. He also needed an
actor prepared to take risks. He warned that the role would involve
shattering mirrors and ladders. ''I'm not superstitious,'' responded Tam
Dean Burn. ''I'm a dialectical materialist.'' He accepted.
There has been an attempt sometimes to portray his politics as just
another acting role in the Tam Dean Burn repertoire. This would be
wrong. He has stood as a candidate for the Communist Party of Great
Britain in the last General Election, at Glasgow Central, and in the
regional elections, in Tayside. He has also acted as campaign agent for
other candidates in Dundee in district and European elections. A member
of the Provisional Central Committee which revived the name of the party
after its official disbanding in 1993, he admits he is less active now
in Edinburgh than he was in London, with the Glasgow Miners' Support
Group and in the Timex dispute in Dundee.
Members of the Leninist Tendency of the Communist Party persuaded him
to stay in acting when he considered abandoning it after his 18-month
stint at the Royal National Theatre. He had also become involved as a
director with the Workers Theatre Movement, reviving 1930s sketches in
street theatre taken around the country. A member of the core group that
formed around Tam Dean Burn was John Hannah. ''The piece he was working
on then was called Three Frames And Two Pictures,'' he recalls with one
of his ready chuckles. ''He's gone on to Three Weddings And A Funeral.''
He says that the Edinburgh rave scene, with which he is involved on a
level far beyond rehearsing roles for Headstates and Come On, has been a
liberating experience, a freshening of the batteries. How does that
equate with his politics? ''Energy that bubbles up there can still
become more directly political,'' he replies. ''Yes, it's very difficult
to convince people that communism is the answer at the moment, or that
any party is the answer, because they look at all that as part of the
problem. It's a much more anarchistic approach. A lot of people have
moved away from direct party politics into cultural areas.''
It is another aspect of the search, and of that same chameleon quality
that distinguishes his acting. He may have found a name, but he
continues to exhibit that same ambivalence towards theatre that he has
shown in earlier careers that have taken him from punk band singer, a
service department clerk in a dreary office, and a darkroom assistant at
Lothian &amp; Borders Police headquarters. He seems to be most positive with
acting when he is out of a theatre altogether, whether on a hill, in a
night club or on the banks of the Clyde. Perhaps that provides a lead
for the direction Scottish theatre could be heading.

Behold, the hour-glass silhouette is back and fashion's grip, with its
bodices in silk or lace, is exposed once again, as Anne Simpson
discovers.
SUCH clenched, little bodices are sprouting this summer, there
scarcely seems room enough inside them for a throbbing heart. Yet the
history of clothes suggests that the heart throb and the corset are
indissoluble. And however much this may discomfort Germaine Greer, the
truth is that women are again increasingly subjecting themselves to the
midriff squeeze to make the decolletage look chubby.
Towards the end of the last century Toulouse-Lautrec gave us similar
evidence in all those demi-monde lithographs of worshipped and exploited
dancers at the Moulin Rouge. Forced to shed innocence for monetary
favour, these coquettes learned quickly how to drive old barons mad with
leering passion: the cancan was their revenge on the hypocrisy of the
bourgeoisie. Fierce with moral rectitude by day, these men would drool
and hoot over their pink vodkas by night as the girls, in a dance of
wild, ungainly naughtiness, shook whaleboned hips and buttressed bosoms,
plump and glistening.
But, alas, it was the coquettes who paid most dearly for the cabaret,
their sufferings beginning immediately they retreated to the theatre's
wings where they would collapse from all that bone, busk, and batiste
pressing inwards to crush the kidneys and contort the spine.
Now, as this century draws to a close, fashion's grip is out in the
open once again. Greer's contempt for the fat cleavage is really
nobody's problem but her own, yet it is still strange that the corset --
a piece of torture for so many -- should find favour just when women are
proud to consider themselves free spirits and not the toys of moneyed
men.
However there it is, underlined, haltered, trussed, and sometimes
buckled, or else passing itself off as something more tender: the
bustier may have a gentler sound and touch to it, but in effect it's
still a clamp. Is this how women punish themselves after all those years
of baggy clothing when the waist gained hidden inches by roaming wide?
Or, more pertinently, is this the vengeance of the male designer who,
seeing no future in long-term shapelessness, proclaims the return of the
curve? For behold, the hour-glass silhouette is back, its bodices in
silk or lace, or shaped from slithery satin or no more than a clingy
band of diamante.
In fact, over recent seasons, the bust has been worked on for all
sorts of angles. Saint Laurent squashed it into tight black bustiers as
a result of his obsession with Carmen. John Galliano allowed the breasts
to bounce free under chiffon veils, while the aesthetic Japanese, like
Yamamoto and Comme des Garcons, pressed them downwards into obscurity.
By contrast Jean-Paul Gaultier gave them outrageous definition, pointing
them upwards, like land-to-air missiles on his erstwhile muse, the
wanton Madonna. Meanwhile Versace, Lagerfeld, and Lacroix roundly pushed
them outwards, offering them up, like a pair of pulsating marshmallows
on a plate.
It is no wonder then that the mammary fetishes of many men owe nothing
to reality. Which may be why sales research shows that on those rare
occasions when British husbands embark on purchasing intimate apparel
for their wives they overdo the bra measurements. Not so the French and
the Italians who, it seems, are far more knowing in such matters. When
they buy a bra for a woman it fits with impeccable precision. Here,
though, 31% of husbands believe their spouses are about two inches
bigger about the bust than fact, and two inches smaller at the waist.
But unlike the corset, the brassiere, during most of its history, has
served women as a trusty friend, although its purchase by the wrong
hands obviously allows it the power to wreck its wearer's image. Few
things these days are considered ill-mannered, but the sight of a woman
delving inside her shirt-front to yank an errant strap remains utterly
declasse. For this reason alone men might do us all a favour and get
those damned statistics right.
But if the bella figura lives in male minds, it is comfort and
efficiency which govern female priorities in bra buying. Men may dream
of black Chantilly lace but the consumer trends of women show they much
prefer all-purpose white, leading to the suspicion that when women
harness themselves up for the day, eroticism is the last thing on their
minds. Which may, or may not, say much about their partners.

GLENROTHES Development Corporation has completed a #2.8m environmental
project, transforming the drab, grey housing area of Macedonia into a
colourful, attractive place. The involvement of residents, a mix of
tenants and owner-occupiers, was made paramount. Many owners took
advantage of the opportunity to participate in the upgrade which has not
only contributed to the overall impact of the project but has probably

being offered a contract. The club's manager, Mr Allan McGraw, said:
''David was very fit, about 6ft tall, and as strong as an ox, so we just

<TEXT>
A MAJOR row rocked the Church of England last night after Church
advisers claimed: It's no sin to live in sin.
Traditionalists and evangelicals condemned the groundbreaking report
from the Church's Board for Social Responsibility -- and claimed the
Church had delivered an obit on the traditional family.
The furore intensified later when it emerged that a member of the
working party that produced the report resigned, in protest at the
''liberal outlook''.
Mr Alan Storkey, a lecturer at London's Oak Hill theological college,
claimed the report's tone was not sufficiently Christian.
It called for the phrase ''living in sin'' to be dropped, as soaring
numbers of people choose to cohabit.
Instead, the report said the Church should welcome cohabitees into the
fold -- and estimated that by the year 2000 four in five couples will
live together before marrying.
The report also urged a ''ready welcome'' in the Church for gay men
and women -- saying many have high-quality loving relationships.
It urged the Church to support families in all their diversity and
help people build strong, committed, faithful relationships.
Churchgoers had in the past been ''too censorious'' and quick to
condemn cohabitation as ''fornication,'' said the report, which stressed
that marriage is still central to the Christian tradition of family
life.

COUNCILLORS in Central region did a U-turn yesterday in the face of
parental opposition to plans to close a 45-pupil school for children
with special needs. Dawson Park Primary School in Falkirk, which had
been due to shut at the end of term, will stay now open indefinitely,
the region's education committee decided.
The council had planned to move pupils from Dawson Park to units in
two mainstream schools as part of a move to ''integrate'' the children
with special difficulties, such as Down's Syndrome. Under the new plans,
existing pupils will stay at Dawson Park. Parents of new pupils will be
able to choose between Dawson Park and a unit to be opened at the
mainstream Langlees Primary School.

IT was good luck and police intuition which led to the callous killers
of Stuart Nicol.
After killing Mr Nicol on his own doorstep, Muir Middler, 26, and
Jason Simpson, 21, left the scene, removed their incriminating clothing,
and buried it in woods near their homes. Then they returned to the
murder spot as the police inquiries got under way.
Simpson and Middler played the roles of concerned family friends but
their interest appears to have been solely with Mrs Nicol, originally
from Quatar, who, Simpson claimed in court, became his mistress just
three days before the killing.
At their trial last October, the Crown told the jury that the affair
between Simpson and Mrs Nicol was a highly significant factor in the
murder and that there was ample evidence from which it could be inferred
that Simpson wanted to get rid of Mr Nicol so he could have ''a clear
field with Nawal''.
Last year's court hearing was told that the murder had been planned
for weeks, possibly months, by Middler and Simpson. Mrs Nicol was said
to have been having an affair with Simpson, and at least one witness
suggested there may also have been a liaison between her and Middler.
There was evidence led that Middler told police that Mrs Nicol had
offered them #25,000 each to get rid of her husband, and added: ''And
Jason got her as well.''
The two men were said to have told police that Nawal Nicol had urged
them to take her husband to the rocks at Cruden Bay, have a smoke, then
club him to death.
However, Mr Nicol had not wanted to go with them and they then
allegedly hatched a plot whereby the two men pretended to be burglars.
It was intended that Stuart Nicol should disturb the men and that they
should then stab him to death.
Weeks before his death, Mr Nicol had apparently become suspicious.
Some of the most compelling testimony at the trial of Simpson and
Middler came from Mr Nicol's work colleague, Mr Simon Tees, who said he
thought Nawal Nicol was ''deranged''.
Mr Tees told the court that, three weeks before the murder, Mr Nicol
had been at his home in Portlethen, south of Aberdeen, and had burst
into tears.
He told Mr Tees his wife was up to something behind his back and, when
pressed on what he meant, replied: ''You would not believe me if I told
you.''
As he left the house, he turned to his friend and said: ''Whatever
happens, make sure my mum gets Damien.''
Mr Tees said Mr Nicol was devoted to Damien, his two-year-old son.
Mr Nicol spent many weekends with his wife in the company of the men
who were to murder him, drinking in the Ellon pub Raffles, although
unlike Middler and Simpson, who claimed to have devoured #160 worth of
drink on the day leading up to the killing, he was no big drinker.
He was a quiet man, a salesman for Canon photocopiers.
Simpson and Middler have offered no motive for the killing of a man
they claimed was ''a mate'', although both may have been infatuated with
Mrs Nicol. In court, Middler said the only reason he could offer was
''the drink'', and Simpson offered no explanation.
Several plots were hatched but the two pub bouncers, who were of
previous good character, could not summon the courage to carry out the
killing.
Even on the night of the murder, their nerves failed them. After their
day of drinking, they went back to the Nicols' house but left an hour
later after watching a video, without carrying out the plan to kill Mr
Nicol.
However, they had a change of mind after they had left, returned, and
rang the door bell. Mr Nicol answered the door, Simpson grabbed him, and
Middler stabbed him repeatedly.
Simpson and Middler returned to Simpson's house where they washed,
changed, and packed their clothes and the rubber gloves they both wore
into plastic bags, and buried them in nearby woods.
They returned to the murder house to ''comfort'' Mrs Nicol and, when
police interviewed them they were calm and aroused no suspicion.
The police, however, had doubts. Then one witness who had seen Simpson
and Middler with the Nicols at Raffles hours before the murder described
what the two men were wearing. It was not what they were wearing a few
hours later.
It took the officers very little time to break down the stories of the
two killers and they confessed.

A CASE about a Scrabble tournament was moved by the judge to a larger
courtroom yesterday because of the numbers of the game's aficionados
attending.
Mike Goldman, 62, a solicitor from Maida Vale who is a former Scrabble
champion, is suing three tournament officials for #5000 aggravated
damages. He claims that playing time deducted when he was at the
lavatory cost him a possible prize.
One defendant, Graeme Thomas, chairman of the Association of Premier
Scrabble Players, told Central London County Court it was ''quite
reasonable'' to expect a participant's bladder to cope with three hours
of play. Such anatomical references recurred. It was ''not necessary''
to have timetabled breaks. Schedules were too tight to offer such
conveniences.
The tournament was in 1990 at the Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent.
Mr Goldman had no choice but to go to the lavatory between the second
and third game of the Saturday morning session.
When he came back after struggling through a convention of cowboys and
cowgirls he discovered that a time clock had been started in his absence
and he had lost four minutes.
But for that, he believed his ''superior skill'' would have enabled
him to ''very probably win'' the game.
Mr Thomas, a computer programmer, said it would have been a
''reasonable assumption'' that those taking part would have realised
matches were being organised back-to-back.
Mr Michael Duggan, Mr Goldman's barrister, said: ''I suggest that is
not true. You had three-and-a-half hours to play three games of 50
minutes.''
Not so, replied Mr Thomas. There was a difference between playing a
game on a 50-minute schedule and playing time of 50 minutes. Games, he
explained, could be interrupted by challenges.
Mr Duggan asked: ''You would accept that participants could be placed
in a position where there simply would not be time to go to the toilet
between games?''
''Correct'', Mr Thomas responded. ''Neither is there the necessity. It
is perfectly reasonable for people to last three hours.''
Earlier the Scrabble association's director, Mr Terrence Hollington,
said he had made it clear that if players were not at their seats on
time a game could start without them.
When Mr Goldman asked if that could happen if he was going to the
lavatory, he told him that it might.
He rejected a suggestion from Mr Duggan that no such conversation took
place.
''Sir,'' replied Mr Hollington, ''I am giving my evidence on oath. I
am surprised that that accusation should be made of me.''
The case continues.

SKILLS and qualities which will help teenagers secure a job are more
important for schools to develop than traditional curriculum subjects,
according to a survey of the Scottish public and employers.
The public rates personal, social, and vocational qualities higher
than these subjects.
Parents and adults believe the priorities for schools should be
developing job-related skills and knowledge, and giving pupils
self-confidence. However, the public accepts that schools should not
shoulder the responsibility on their own: nearly 80% believe the home
and school should work together for the personal and social development
of young people.
Being a good citizen and learning to live among other people from
different backgrounds was also rated highly.
The findings were released yesterday in a Scottish Office Education
Department survey concerning the third and fourth years of secondary
schooling.
Although both public and employers rate qualities such as
self-confidence very highly, neither is particularly satisfied with the
way such aptitudes are taught in schools.
Among the public, 70% are happy about the teaching of traditional
subjects such as English and Maths but only 48% express confidence about
the way personal and social skills are developed.
The survey involved a random sample of about 650 members of the public
and 300 employers.
For the public, mathematics and English are the priorities, followed
by science, information technology, and foreign languages.
Employers agree that maths and English are the priorities and that the
arts are the least important but they give information technology a
higher rating than parents.
Teachers rate highly among members of the public, nearly two-thirds of
whom feel they are very or fairly respected.
0 The survey also questioned both groups about where they would like
to see the greatest investment of energy and resources in Scottish
schools.
Helping with difficulties in learning came out top for the public,
followed by maintaining discipline, careers advice, and keeping parents
informed and involved.
0 Mr Archie McGlynn, director of the SOED audit unit said: ''Scottish
teachers can take great encouragement from these figures.''
He added: ''The report gives a clear signal from employers to young
people entering the job market and adults retraining that yes, we are
looking for people with the basic skills of reading, counting, writing,
and problem solving but coming up fast to join them are skills in
information technology and foreign languages.''
Educationalists are confident that the programme for five to
14-year-olds and the reform of upper secondary schooling will develop
pupils' wider skills.

ENGLISH pits owned by RJB Mining face prolonged disruption following a
decision of the NUM executive to hold a series of one-day strikes over
pay.
The 24-member executive, meeting in Barnsley yesterday, called for a
24-hour stoppage next Tuesday -- in line with the law requiring seven
days' notice -- and Friday. Thereafter, strikes would be held every
Monday and Friday until thechief executive, Mr Richard Budge, agrees to
negotiate.
Mr Budge, following a 23% increase, is on #290,000 a year, which could
be doubled under the terms of a performance-related bonus arrangement.
He first sought a three-year pay freeze before agreeing to a possible
pay review at the end of the year.
However, NUM members, who form the bulk of his 8000 work-force, have
voted by more than 80% for industrial action to force him to the
negotiation table after receiving no basic rate increase for several
years.
Up to 17 pits could be hit, with the Selby complex in north Yorkshire
looking the most vulnerable. Mr Budge hopes to be able to maintain
production at some pits, especially those manned by members of the rival
Union of Democratic Mineworkers.
The NUM strikes will be the first meaningful industrial action by the
union since the bitter, year-long 1984-5 miners' strike.

A NEW chief executive has been appointed to Moray Health Services. Mr
George Buchanan, chief executive of the Wick-based Caithness and
Sutherland NHS Trust, will take over the #53,500 post in August.
The move follows the resignation of Mrs Elizabeth Hogg earlier this
year which also resulted in the resignation of two non-executive
directors.
It has been suggested that Mrs Hogg's departure followed disagreements
between her and the senior medical team.
Mr Buchanan was born and educated in Edinburgh, where he trained as a
nurse. He qualified as a registered mental care nurse, registered
general nurse, district nurse, and a practical work teacher.
He held a variety of nursing positions in Edinburgh before becoming
director of Community Nursing Services in Dumbarton in 1987.
In 1989, Mr Buchanan, who is married with two children, moved to Wick
as general manager of the Northern Unit of Highland Health Board before
being appointed chief executive when it achieved trust status.
Moray trust chairman James Snedden, who was called to Edinburgh to
explain Mrs Hogg's departure to Mr Geoff Scaife, NHS chief executive in
Scotland, said yesterday he was pleased the position had been filled.

Tokyo, Tuesday
PUBLIC prosecutors in Japan today formally accused the guru of a
Japanese doomsday cult of masterminding the March 20 nerve gas attacks
on Tokyo subways, indicting him and six followers on murder charges.
Prosecutors also announced the indictment of nine other members of
Shoko Asahara's Aum Shinri Kyo (Aum Supreme Truth Sect) on charges of
murder preparation by producing sarin, the deadly nerve gas unleashed
during the attack on five subway stations.
''We have determined that Asahara was the mastermind behind this
unprecedented case,'' said Deputy Chief Prosecutor Tatsuo Kainaka.
Prosecutors were expected to indict several other Aum followers later
this week. Police have arrested 34 of 41 suspects.
The indictment said Asahara and his followers had killed 11 people
while more than 5500 were taken ill. A twelfth person later died but
prosecutors said they could not establish a direct link to the death.
Two of those taken to hospital are still comatose, linked to
artificial respirators. The indictment listed all the estimated 5500
victims.
Asahara, 40, has denied the charges and refused to respond to
questions.--AP/Reuter.

Washington, Tuesday
ELECTRONIC beacon signals, which might have been transmitted by a
downed US fighter pilot in Bosnia, are no longer being received by
searchers in the area.
The announcement by the US Defence Department jolted dim hopes that
the pilot of the US F-16 fighter jet, shot down last Friday by a Bosnian
Serb anti-aircraft missile over northern Bosnia, might have survived the
crash.
Cable News Network reported from Bosnia that the Serbs had not
captured the pilot despite earlier claims.
''Unfortunately, the beacon signal has not been picked up today,''
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters.
General Ronald Fogelman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, said yesterday
that faint electronic beeper signals, possibly from a pilot's emergency
beacon, had been received by searchers over northern Bosnia.
Another senior defence official also said that the signals had been
received ''for the last 20 to 24 hours, which is encouraging''.
Today, however, Bacon said that ''there was always reason to doubt
this signal . . . there are a lot of beacons around.''--Reuter.

PHILIPPINES investigators said today they had no evidence against a
British tour operator accused in a television report of supplying
Filipino children for sex with paedophiles.
Mamerto Espartero of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said
Michael Clarke was invited to headquarters to clarify reports about
foreign paedophiles supposedly enjoying NBI protection.
''We don't have any evidence against him and we cannot charge him
criminally,'' Espartero told reporters.
Mr Clarke said a recent British television news programme linking him
to child sex tours had been ''doctored''.
''I deny all allegations made against me,'' said Mr Clarke, 48, of
Eastbourne in Sussex. ''I swear to God and on my only daughter's life
that I am telling the truth.''
Philippine Senator Ernesto Herrera called yesterday for an
investigation of a syndicate alleged to sell Filipino children to
paedophiles in Britain and charges some NBI personnel were protecting
the group.
The children were reported to be under the age of 14.
There are an estimated 85,000 street children and 20,000 child
prostitutes in the Philippines, most of them in Manila, according to
government studies.--Reuter.

Johannesburg, Tuesday
SOUTH Africa today abolished the death penalty in a move greeted by
President Nelson Mandela as civilised but criticised by others as
sending the wrong message to a country riddled by violent crime.
The scrapping of the noose was contained in a ruling by the country's
Constitutional Court which lifts the threat of execution from 453
prisoners on death row.
''Everyone, including the most abominable of human beings, has the
right to life and capital punishment is therefore unconstitutional,''
ruled court president Judge Arthur Chaskalson.
He said the court's 11 judges had ruled unanimously against capital
punishment. The death penalty was last carried out in 1989 and
then-President F W de Klerk suspended it a year later.
Mandela said today that the decision finally to abolish the death
penalty was in line with civilised norms and would have no bearing on
his government's commitment to tackle crime.
Advocates of the death penalty had argued that abolishing it would
send the wrong signal to criminals in South Africa, where on average
more than 50 murders are committed every day. Forty-two people were
murdered in Johannesburg alone last weekend.
However Mandela's African National Congress said: ''Never, never, and
never again must citizens of our country be subjected to the barbaric
practices of capital punishment.''
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said he was thrilled. ''It's such
nonsense and hardly anywhere in the world has it shown to be an
effective deterrent, so I'm thrilled for our country.''
However Danie Schutte, justice spokesman for the former ruling
National Party, was disappointed.
''We feel it gives out the wrong signal in a country where the crime
rate is the highest in the world for a country not at war,'' he said.
During the Constitutional Court debate on the issue, outgoing
Witwatersrand attorney-general Klaus von Lieres had claimed people would
resort to lynch law if the death penalty was taken off the statute
books.
Most of those on death row are black men, but others include
right-wing white politician Clive Derby-Lewis and Polish migrant Janusz
Walus, both sentenced to death for the 1993 murder of Communist Party
chief Chris Hani.--Reuter.

Tokyo, Tuesday
THE Japanese Government finally agreed today on the words it will use
to say sorry for the Second World War.
A planned parliamentary resolution to mark the 50th anniversary of the
end of the war will contain an expression of ''deep remorse'' for
Japan's wartime actions.
The hotly-contested wording says Japan ''recognises'' that it
colonised other countries and committed aggressive acts.
A deal on the words to be used was only reached after hours of
last-ditch talks between top officials of the three parties in the
government coalition.
Hard-liners in the Liberal Democatic Party bitterly opposed any
unilateral apology for the war by Japan. They said such a move would
dishonour Japan's war dead and insisted Japan fought the war to help
Asians free themselves from Western colonialism.
However officials from Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's Socialist
Party said Japan must finally apologise for its actions and had
threatened to break up the coalition if the LDP did not give in.
Murayama had indirectly threatened to quit if no resolution was agreed
by the end of Parliament's current session in 12 days' time.
Talks inside the coalition broke down last week when the conservative
LDP, the biggest group in the coalition, presented a draft that depicted
the war as one fought by Japanese for noble causes.
The key sentence of the planned resolution reads: ''While giving
thought to the many acts of colonial control and aggression that have
occurred in modern world history, we recognise the acts of this kind
carried out by our country in the past and the suffering that we caused
the people of other countries, especially those of Asia, and we express
our feeling of deep remorse.''
It does not use the word ''apology'' and its somewhat ambiguous
phrasing is unlikely to fully satisfy Asian war victims and former
Allied soldiers who have been watching the debate in Japan and
criticising its reluctance to issue an unmistakable admission of guilt.
But a leader of the socialists in Japan's coalition government, party
secretary-general Wataru Kubo, said the text ''captures the spirit of
what we have been aiming for''.

Paris, Tuesday
NEW French President Jacques Chirac was under growing pressure today
after a leaked report said experts led by Chief of Staff Admiral Jacques
Lanxade had called for nuclear weapons tests to be restarted.
Defence Minister Charles Millon confirmed that military officials were
recommending new tests to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent.
New Zealand immediately said it would be deeply concerned by fresh
nuclear blasts.
''The government has made clear at the highest level the very deep
concern that would be felt in New Zealand at any resumption of testing
in the South Pacific,'' said Foreign Minister Don McKinnon.
Greenpeace said it was sending its ship Rainbow Warrior II from New
Zealand to the test site at Mururoa Atoll in French Polynesia. Ten years
ago French secret agents sank the original Rainbow Warrior in New
Zealand's Auckland harbour, killing one person.
Chirac took office last month with a declaration that the credibility
of France's nuclear deterrent had absolute priority. He has said he will
decide whether or not to resume tests, frozen by his predecessor
Francois Mitterrand in 1992, after consulting experts.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe's office today released a letter from Juppe
to Millon last week, instructing him to ''prepare without delay for the
head of state all necessary elements for a decision on the question of
nuclear tests''.
A 1993 report argued that more tests were needed to validate a new
warhead for France's submarine-launched missiles and perfect computer
simulation techniques to make future testing unnecessary.
Mitterrand overruled the top brass at the time.
The newspaper Le Monde said today that Lanxade's panel had now updated
the report for the new president.
The military was said to be pressing for a rapid resumption of testing
precisely because the nuclear powers have pledged to sign a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty next year.
Only China has continued nuclear testing since 1992, drawing
widespread condemnation.--Reuter.

Jerusalem and listened to a memorial prayer for the six million Jews
killed by the Nazis.
Kohl walked through the dark hall of the Children's Memorial, where
pinpoints of light commemorate the 1.5 million young Jews killed in the
Holocaust and a sombre voice reads the names and ages of the victims.
''This awakens horrible memories and I can only be full of shame about
what has been done in the name of Germany,'' Kohl told journalists as he
left the hall.
The German leader, making his second visit as chancellor to the
memorial, walked through the ''Valley of the Destroyed Communities'' --
stones marked with the names of towns whose Jewish populations were
annihilated during the Second World War.
He said aloud the names of communities near his birthplace of
Ludwigshaven.
Kohl, who is on a four-day visit to Israel, later held talks with
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and told reporters they both ''underlined
how important we consider the completion of the (Arab-Israeli) peace
process to be''.
Kohl also voiced confidence that Israel and the EU could overcome
difficulties holding up a trade accord granting Israel easier access to
European markets and research and development funds.
Tomorrow he travels to Palestinian-ruled Jericho, in the West Bank,
for talks with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. Kohl is the second Western
leader after US Vice-President Al Gore to visit Jericho since
Palestinian self-rule began last year.
* Chancellor Kohl's wife Hannelore suffered whiplash injury in a
five-car pile-up on a rain-slicked autobahn, prompting her to cancel 10
days of appointments and remain at home.
Mrs Kohl's Audi triggered the crash by slamming into another car on
the A61 near Hockenheim last night. No-one was injured but Mrs Kohl, 62,
complained of neck pain after police drove her home.
Her husband returns home from the Middle East tomorrow.--AP/Reuter.

Hong Kong, Tuesday
HONG KONG'S attempt to censor an Elisabeth Frink sculpture of a male
nude by fixing a cardboard fig-leaf over the genitals appeared to have
backfired today.
The cardboard cut-out served to titillate rather than dampen interest,
attracting a steady stream of visitors who lifted the fake fig leaf for
a quick peep underneath.
The cover-up of New Man, the work by the British artist, followed a
June 1 ruling by the Obscene Articles Tribunal.
''On the one hand it's unbelievable, it's so silly,'' said Oscar Ho,
exhibition director at the Hong Kong Arts Centre, who feared the ruling
may lead to further curbs on artistic expression.
''The scary part is that we appear to be making moral assumptions
based on the view that certain parts of the body are indecent.''
The bronze of a standing nude male is owned by Hong Kong businessman
Woo Po-shing who put it on display in the lobby of a building in the
Central business district.
The tribunal made its ruling following an anonymous complaint.
An exhibition of Frink's male nudes was exhibited uneventfully six
years ago at the upscale Exchange Square building in Central, which
houses the stock exchange.
Another of her bronzes, a finely detailed study of a pair of water
buffaloes, is on show there.--Reuter.

THE Chief Inquiry Reporter into the planning application for a #70m
coastal superquarry at Lingerbay in Harris decided last night to close
the eight-month public inquiry.
The investigation has cost #2m and has been the longest-running public
inquiry in Scotland. Its conclusion comes after a last-minute decision
by the Western Islands Council to withdraw its support for the
superquarry project.
It was also revealed at the close of the inquiry at Leverburgh in
Harris that the applicant, Redland Aggregates Ltd, is actively
considering to seek expenses against the principal objectors, Scottish
Natural Heritage.
Earlier there had been submissions that the agency had acted outwith
its remit.
In June, 1993, the Western Islands Council decided by 24 votes to
three to approve the proposals by Redland to extract 600 million tonnes
of anorthosite over 60 years from Lingerbay, which is in a National
Scenic Area.
However, on Monday night the council, which includes many new members
since the 1994 elections, decided by 21 votes to eight to withdraw its
support for the development.
This followed a recent referendum by the people of Harris who voted
2-1 against the project, although two years ago 62% had voted in favour.
Dr Robert Reed, QC, for the council, told the Reporter, Miss Gillian M
Pain, he had received instructions to inform her of the council's
resolution on Monday night that it was no longer supporting the quarry,
and that the Secretary of State would be informed in writing.
He said he had clear instructions from the council that it did not
wish to withdraw any of its evidence which had come before the inquiry.
Neither did it wish to amend any submissions, nor to make new ones.
Yesterday, Miss Pain warned the parties that it was open to the
Secretary of State to require that the inquiry be reopened if necessary.
Mrs Lynda Towers, for Scottish Natural Heritage, submitted that the
decision was a material consideration that the council, at the end of
its evidence, had reversed its view.
She said that was innconsistent with Dr Reed's closing submission
asking the Secretary of State to grant planning permission. It affected
the status of the evidence from the council as local planning authority.
She submitted that Dr Reed's instructions were going to cause some
difficulty to the Secretary of State and to the Reporter in drawing up
her recommendations. She felt there was a need for clarification before
the inquiry closed.
Mr Lloyd Austin, of the Link group of environmental organisations,
also submitted that the council's resolution was inconsistent with the
closing submission by Dr Reed.
However, Mr Roy Martin, QC, for Redland, said the SNH submission was
another attempt by the agency to try, at any cost, to prevent the
application being approved.
He said the answer to the problem was quite simple. The decision taken
by the council on June 24, 1993, was the decision of the planning
authority. The authority's function ceased when the application was
called in by the Secretary of State.
Mr Martin said the fact the council had passed a resolution stating it
was no longer minded to grant the application was neither here nor
there. The application was to be determined by the Secretary of State.
After allowing an adjournment to seek clarification on certain points,
the Chief Inquiry Reporter ruled she would close the inquiry.
Mr Martin then intimated that the question of expenses was under
active consideration by the applicants as to whether there should be a
motion in respect of SNH.
Before closing the inquiry about 7pm, Miss Pain said she believed it
had been the longest planning inquiry to be held in Scotland. She
expressed her thanks to everyone involved, including the islanders, for
the courtesy extended to her.
As the sheep continued to bleat outside the village hall she remarked:
''It looks as if the sheep will have the last word.''
Mr John Leiveres, director of lands and planning for Redlands, said
later: ''The council's decision was entirely expected, bearing in mind
the opinion expressed by the local referendum.
''In fact nothing has changed as far as the application is concerned,
except for the improvements to the security brought about by the Section
50 agreement accepted by the council and ourselves.
''Benefits still remain, jobs will be created, and there is nothing so
far that we have seen at this inquiry or elsewhere that can offer the
same benefit.''

THE Government was challenged yesterday to respond positively to a
plan published by the housing charity, Shelter, calling for a programme
of house building over a five-year period which could provide up to
33,000 jobs annually.
Its report, Building Scotland's Future, has been published as part of
National Housing Week.
Shelter thinks that over each of the next five years 56,000 new homes
are needed, with investment of #580m each year. It estimates that 1000
people are sleeping on the streets every night in Scotland.
Depute director Kate Caskie said in Edinburgh that homelessness was at
record levels. ''This report shows that investing in housing makes
social sense and it makes economic sense too.
''It is a compelling case and Shelter is demanding the Government
responds positively to it.''
Shelter's report states that the total resources of #580m a year to
support such a programme would add around 2.5% to the current budget
responsibility of the Scottish Secretary.
However, it claims that such an investment in house building and the
creation of thousands of new jobs would produce spin-off savings such as
higher tax yields from those in work and a reduction in benefit
payments.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said the Shelter report was a useful
contribution to the debate on housing.
UCATT welcomed the report as good for the contruction industry and
good for the wider Scottish economy.
Mr Alan Ritchie of UCATT -- the Union of Construction and Allied
Trades and Technicians -- said 30,000 jobs had been lost in the
construction industry during the 1989-93 recession.
Shelter publicised the report by having a building brick handed in at
the Scottish Office in Edinburgh.
The brick was delivered by Mr Tommy Tosh, 62, an unemployed building
worker from Dundee.
Mr Tosh, a joiner, who has been without work for a year, said: ''I am
one of the statistics. It is near-impossible to get a job and, at my
age, it is hopeless. I've been more than 40 years in the building
trade.''

A product of Inverness Royal Academy, Mr Ewen graduated from Aberdeen
University in 1961 and after three years in industry returned to an
administrative post in 1964.
He occupied several posts before his appointment as deputy secretary
in 1979. As a Lt Colonel in the Royal Engineers he was joint service
liaison officer for Grampian region. He was awarded the Territorial
Decoration in 1979 and the OBE in 1983.
''Robbie'' Ewen masked skills in penetrating analysis and effective
administration behind a diffident manner and kindly humour. His care for
Glasgow University was reflected in everything he did.
He is survived by his widow, son, and daughter.

IT is a racy tale that would grace the pages of any popular fiction.
The plot, however, which pitches a former Scots champion racing driver
headlong into a battle with breast cancer and a fight to break a
70-year-old record, is pure fact.
Yesterday, Mrs June Henderson-Laird, who retired from professional
racing in 1987 with the British Empire Medal and the Italian Legion of
Merit, revealed she had won her battle against breast cancer.
She said: ''The fight against cancer was more awesome than anything I
have ever encountered on the track. Now that I am all clear, I want to
inspire others and raise a healthy sum for charity.''
As an inspiration ''to those going through the same nightmare'', she
intends to break the Royal Scottish Automobile Club's Scottish coastline
record, which involves driving non-stop round the rugged edges of
Scotland.
The record was established in 1923 by the Scottish car manufacturer
Arrol Johnson of Kirkcudbright and Renfrew and has stood unchallenged
since then. It took the driver six days, 15 hours, and 14 minutes to
cover the coastline from Wemyss Bay -- to Wemyss Bay.
This time, Mrs Henderson-Laird, with her husband James, who will act
as navigator, hopes to complete the journey in a somewhat shorter time
in her modified 2-litre Opel Manta GTE.
They will set out on June 16 from the RSAC Club in Glasgow. The
Glasgow start and finish is in deference to the RSAC's agreement to
reinstate the challenge subject to a number of stringent regulations.
The record will be undertaken on metalled roads only and will follow
as closely as practicable the coastline and original route. Certain
points will be verified by a databack camera while there will be
observers at one third and two thirds distance. Speed limits will be
monitored.
Mrs Henderson-Laird said: ''We are unable to give an estimate of the
distance or time since these form part of a fund-raising competition
which we are running.''
The two charities which will benefit from the record breaking attempt
are the Cancer Relief MacMillan Fund and Enable, the Scottish
organisation which represents people with learning difficulties.
Competition forms are available by telephoning 01368 865 306.
The racing career of Mrs Henderson-Laird, a Glaswegian, spanned four
decades and culminated in 1986 when she was awarded the BEM for her
services to sport. She won the Judy Anderson Trophy and the Halliday
Trophy.

TORY Opposition claims of impropriety and a possible conflict of
interest over plans to combine transportation, economic development, and
planning under one department in the unitary Edinburgh Council were
swept aside yesterday by the Labour administration.
The row broke out at a council meeting yesterday which considered the
proposed new organisational structure put forward by chief executive Tom
Aitchison.
A structure of 10 departments is planned, one of which would combine
transport, economic development, and planning.
Opposing the merger move, Tory group leader Daphne Sleigh claimed it
was ''improper'' that the council should operate as a developer which
gave itself planning consents and also regulated traffic matters. It
would be difficult to convince the public that there was not a conflict
of interest.
The Conservatives did not believe the authority should act as a
''hands-on'' developer but should be an enabler, helping economic
development by others to take place. It should not intervene in the
market place in this way.
Shops and businesses in Edinburgh for example could claim that traffic
schemes were favouring the council's own economic development policies
toward out-of-town shopping. She also raised the question of planning
applications by council-owned companies.
Labour councillors angrily refuted any suggestion of impropriety about
the new arrangements.
Council leader Keith Geddes said they believed there were plenty of
safeguards built into the system which, for example, proposed a separate
planning committee. A growing number of councils in England and Scotland
were adopting similar arrangements.
Other Labour members insisted that planning applications put forward
by the district council had often been given a very rough ride by
officials and councillors.
Councillor Geddes said the new structure would mean the loss of around
30 posts compared to the number of officials in the present regional and
district councils. The savings of #1.5m would be available for
grass-roots services.

A PACKAGE, including #80m of National Lottery cash, to help the
British film industry over the next five years was announced yesterday
in the Commons by National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell.
The money, which will be distributed through the Arts Council of
England, consists of about #70m to fund film-making and #10m to be spent
on promoting British films. The latter could, for instance, be used to
fund additional prints since lack of prints often limits a film's
distribution.
The package of measures also will mean the reopening of the famous
Ealing studios, in London.
As far as Scotland is concerned, film-makers are already applying to
the Scottish Arts Council for help. Guidelines for film-makers were
issued last November, along with those for other applicants seeking a
share of the money Scotland gets from the lottery. The Scottish Film
Production Fund advises the SAC on the applications.
England gets about 83% of the arts lottery money, which is expected to
be about #150m a year; Scotland gets 9%, expected to be about #15m-#20m.
Although Mr Dorrell has identified a specific sum of arts lottery
money in England for film, the policy in Scotland is different.
The SAC has no intention of allocating a sum from the lottery money to
films. Arts applications will be treated on the basis of how they meet
the relevant criteria, but this is not seen as acting to the
disadvantage of Scottish film- makers when it comes to getting a fair
share.
The different position in Scotland, where the SAC can claim to have
been ahead of the game, meets some of the complaints raised yesterday in
the Commons by Scottish MPs after Mr Dorrell had made his statement --
the first major policy pronouncement on the film industry for over a
decade.
Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat MP for Caithness and Sutherland,
accused him of favouring London at the expense of the regions, and there
was much in Scotland, the provinces, Wales and Northern Ireland, which
could be exploited for making British films.
Mr Dorrell said his aim was not to create a metropolitan bias. It was
important to develop London as an important part of the film-making
jigsaw.
''I am also interested that the growth of the British film industry
sees British films being shown around the rest of the country as well,
and that is why I welcome moves to increase the number of prints and the
promotion budgets of British films so that they are shown outside the
metropolitan areas,'' he added.
SNP leader Alex Salmond asked Mr Dorrell for concrete proposals to
help film production as well as distribution in the regions.
Mr Dorrell said it was important that films once made should be shown,
which was why he was placing an emphasis on distribution.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith said aspects of the statement
were welcome, but none of it amounted to very much. ''As Rick Blaine
would have said, it doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy
world,'' he added, referring to the hero of Casablanca.
There was no evidence that the Government was taking seriously the
potential for helping the film industry with tax breaks, he added.
''This report adds up to #16m a year extra from the lottery, #2m for
Ealing studios from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, nothing for
Channel 4, a token amount for the London Film Commission, #180,000 for
Cinema 100 and a new committee, and that's about it,'' he added.
Then he quoted another film, The Third Man, and Orson Welles's famous
contribution to the script -- ''Five hundred years of democracy in
Switzerland have produced nothing but the cuckoo clock.''
Sixteen years of Tory Government, a series of Downing Street seminars
and Mr Dorrell's visit to the Cannes Film festival last month had
produced nothing but a disappointing set of assertions and virtually no
real action to support the industry, he said.
Mr Dorrell said to describe that reaction as churlish would be an
understatement, and the support announced for production and extra
prints were ''important steps forward.''
The rest of his package consisted of announcing:
* The National Film and Television School is to take over Ealing
studios.
* Plans to examine ideas for a West End showcase cinema dedicated to
showing new British films.
* Pump-priming support for the establishment of a London Film
Commission.
* A pledge that Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke would
''carefully consider'' the select committee's proposals on tax breaks.

TORY MPs warned last night that Sir Nicholas Scott's reprieve may be
only temporary after his local party yesterday resisted calls for him to
step down at the General Election.
The former Minister's backbench colleagues fear he will be dropped
when a new association chooses its candidate for a merged seat in the
autumn.
They believe the latest controversy is just one in a series which will
prompt party activists to terminate his political career.
Sir Nicholas, 61, had been expected to offer to step down over
allegations that he left the scene of a London car accident after which
a three-year-old child was treated for shock. He is currently on police
bail.
He seemed determined yesterday to stay on, and told Mr John
Corbet-Singleton, chairman of his Chelsea constituency association in
south-west London, that he wanted to stand at the next election.
The pair held a brief meeting following Sir Nicholas's four-day
silence over the affair.
A statement issued by the constituency said the MP wanted to be
considered as a prospective candidate for the new enlarged seat of
Kensington and Chelsea.
''This will be a matter for the future Kensington and Chelsea
association when this is formed,'' it said. ''It is likely to be the
autumn before any selection process gets under way.''
Several Chelsea Tories have let it be known they strongly disapprove
of the reported behaviour of their MP, who allegedly abandoned his Volvo
car following the incident. He was later arrested and breath-tested.
Conservative MPs indicated last night that there was widespread
disillusion with Sir Nicholas's alleged behaviour last week.
Last year he faced calls for his resignation as Social Security
Minister and a public attack from his daughter amid claims his
department helped draft wrecking amendments to block a Bill to improve
rights for the disabled.
Publicly, Tory MPs last night were reluctant to do anything but praise
Sir Nicholas and wish him well. However, privately, they warned that his
days looked numbered.
The first signs of the soft line being adopted by the local party came
earlier yesterday when his agent, Mrs Barbara Lord, said the incident
was ''blown out of all proportion''.
Mrs Lord claimed she received a letter from a couple asking why the
child's parents ''had not been had up for not using a zebra crossing''.

THE Prime Minster is getting desperate. Who can blame him? The symptom
yesterday was an angry complaint that Labour prefers myths to facts.
He has, of course, been a politician long enough to know that
politicians of all colours prefer myths. They are less complex things
than facts, more easily handled in a platform speech and are more easily
assimilated by the electorate.
Mr Major was tackling the latest myth -- that he recently accused
those suffering from negative equity of being responsible for their own
plight. This was rather along the lines of the famous Callaghan myth
that, returning to a strike-ravaged Britain from the sunny Caribbean he
exclaimed: ''Crisis? What crisis?'' He did not utter the words. They
were a sub-editor's headline.
Similarly, Mr Major did not say ''They are responsible for their own
plight.'' The Shadow Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, said that was what he
did say meant. Sometimes, though, the myth can seem to the public to
accurately encapsulate the facts; in the Callaghan case that there was
really a first-rate crisis which the Government was unwilling to
acknowledge.
Mr Major waxed suitably indignant accusing the Opposition of a
willingness ''to smear again and again and again and again'' -- really,
on a regular basis he seemed to mean. However, he should adopt a rule,
as should all politicians, never to use the defence ''I was quoted out
of context''. The public usually and the media always then assume that
you meant what you are denying you meant.
Most disconcerting, though, for the Prime Minister, was the sullen
silence with which his apologia was heard on the benches behind -- the
trouble is that quite a lot of his back benchers have come to believe
that what he calls an Opposition myth that he is a gaffe-prone leader is
a fact, or a political fact anyway, which is nearly the same thing.
This combined with his record of setting up committees which proceed
to make life extremely uncomfortable for his own side is running up an
unnerving amount of ill-will within a party which will have to decide in
six months whether they want to keep him on as leader.
Craftier Prime Ministers have known that, just as a barrister should
not ask a witness a question to which he does not already know the
answer, so should a Prime Minster not appoint an inquiry unless he is
pretty certain what its findings will be.
With Mr William Waldegrave in the dock -- sorry, on the Treasury bench
-- beside him, Mr Major performed the rather unusual constitutional
manoeuvre of refusing to admit he would sack any minister found by the
Scott Inquiry -- or presumably anybody else -- to have lied to the House
of Commons.
He and some of his colleagues are clearly braced for a report finding
that some of them lied to or at least misled the House and used or
misused ministerial certificates to the court in a way that could have
sent innocent men in the Matrix-Churchill case to prison l if the judge
had not had the nerve to overrule them.
From the deeply defensive nature of his replies, it looked as though
several Ministers, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer who said he
would, are already working out reasons for not resigning if criticised
by the bicycling judge whom some Tories -- who still believe that
Governments should ''manage'' these things -- can hardly credit was
actually given the job by their own side.
A bit later on, Mr Major was offered the opportunity to say what he
was most proud of in his period of office. The strongest economic
recovery with low inflation in Western Europe, he said, and produced the
statistics which are really quite creditable.
The Opposition Front Bench was a study. They sat grinning. It is no
good, the smiles said, you've had it. If the Angel Gabriel went on
television and told the nation, ''This is a good government'' they
wouldn't believe him. And, in the serried ranks of the Opposition there
could well be persons willing, to paraphrase Hugh Gaitskell, to ''smear
and smear and smear again to win for the party we love.''

AROUND 300 private-sector managers recruited to commercialise the NHS
have negotiated redundancy packages of up to #250,000 in the event of
their being forced out by any future Labour Government.
However, the managers, some of whom earn more than #100,000 a year,
could be in for a surprise: Labour has decided it would expect them to
work out their contracts, possibly on reduced salaries.
Shadow health spokesman Nick Brown estimates it would cost in the
region of #300m, roughly equivalent to abolishing prescription charges,
to buy out these ''Tory idealogues''.
Excessive salaries would be reviewed and the Conservative conscripts
would not be allowed to hold the NHS to ransom he said, adding that
''there will be no big pay-offs under Labour''.
Some NHS managers had hoped to keep the redundancy arrangements secret
by pleading ''commercial confidence'' but they were revealed by Labour
supporters.
These events come in a week which has seen the Government confirm that
NHS costs had risen by more than #1000m over the past two years largely
as a result of the recruitment of additional managers to implement
Government reforms aimed at introducing a market system into the NHS.
Next weekend, Labour's national policy forum meets in Reading and is
expected to endorse policies for the NHS, including moves to restore
centralised pay bargaining. Moves towards local bargaining are at the
heart of the present NHS dispute.

to a rapid increase in rodents, according to the experts.
Pest control giant Rentokil yesterday said that a reported rise in the
rodent population was caused by householders ignoring infestation or
taking action themselves . . . and often increasing the problem.
The company was reacting to a report by the Chartered Institute of
Environmental Health (CIEH) which showed a 39% rise in rat infestations
in homes since 1979.
However, Rentokil's Tony Stephens, former president of the British
Pest Control Association, said mice were a greater health threat,
despite the rat's disease-ridden image, as they lived closer to us.
''One mouse in the kitchen is a greater threat to health than a rat
under the garden shed,'' he said.
The CIEH report said one Government department should be responsible
for controlling rodents and called for a post of national rat catcher.
Pest control is currently shared by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries, and Food, the Department of Health, the Department of
Environment, local authorities, and water companies.
Researchers believe some rats have become resistant to poisons while
more fast food litter has helped them thrive.
Mr Stephens claimed the report was ''misguided''.
He said the rodent increase was concentrated almost entirely in
domestic premises and rural areas, where many left the problem
untreated.
A spokesman for the British Pest Control Association said: ''There is
no rodent problem that cannot be controlled.''

MINISTERS are under pressure to introduce tough new rules for the
fast-expanding private security industry.
MPs on the all-party Home Affairs Committee are expected today to
demand the setting up of a new agency to vet and license security guards
and companies.
Their report is also likely to demand legislation making it an offence
for unlicensed individuals and firms to take on manned guarding
contracts.
The report will be broadly welcomed by senior police officers and
major industry representatives who have long been concerned at the way
''cowboy'' operators have be able to infiltrate a sector which employs
up to 300,000 people, according to one estimate.
The industry currently relies on voluntary self-regulation and most of
the big firms accept this has failed to weed out operators willing to
ignore the rules, shun the main trade bodies, put convicted criminals on
the payroll and pay as little as #1-an-hour.
Calls for action have been fuelled by numerous stories about firms
employing convicted criminals and even using intimidation tactics
against the people they were meant to be guarding.
Like the police, MPs on the Tory-dominated committee are concerned at
what they see as the ineffectiveness of present regulations in a sector
whose influence is creeping into areas such as street patrolling, which
was once the exclusive domain of police.
However, their report is expected to stop short of recommending the
new regulatory system for all sectors of the industry, which covers
everything from manned guarding to bouncers, private investigators and
alarm fitters.
The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, claims
the whole industry urgently needs regulating to protect the public from
unscrupulous operators.
However, the committee is thought to have concluded that only the area
of manned contract guarding needs immediate attention.
The Government is generally opposed to increasing regulations in the
private sector and in 1991 the then Home Secretary Kenneth Baker claimed
there was no need for an ''inevitably expensive and bureaucratic
licensing system'' in the security industry.
However, more recently Ministers have indicated that that position was
under review, and the new report will add urgency to the review.

<TEXT>
PEERS yesterday backed the Government's plans to ensure competition in
gas supply to domestic consumers.
During the debate on the Gas Bill -- , which ends British Gas's
150-year-old monopoly in providing gas to homes -- Trade and Industry
Minister of State Earl Ferrers said the legislation would bring lower
gas prices, improved energy efficiency and a better level of service for
customers.
He called on Labour peers to welcome the Bill now they had ''done away
with Clause 4 and all that jazz''. The original Clause 4 of Labour's
constitution, now replaced, had committed the party to nationalisation.
However, Lord Peston, for the Opposition, warned Ministers their
proposals should not be at the expense of the consumer.
He cited fears that customers in remote areas would have to pay more
for their gas and that safety and special services for consumers would
be reduced as a result of the legislation.
The Bill increased the scope for competition, which would be ''to the
advantage to most consumers'', said Lord Peston.
Tory the Earl of Caithness voiced ''unease'' about the Bill, warning
it would reduce the market price for British Gas which would be
''detrimental to UK Ltd''.
He said weakening British Gas's domestic strength would affect the
firm's ability to compete in the international market and gain gas
supply contracts abroad.
Tory Lord Skelmersdale, an adviser to British Gas, said he was
concerned about the financial standing of new entrants into the gas
supply business.
The regulator should refuse licences if there was any doubt about
their status, he said.

<HEADLINE>Scotland misses out on extraseats in boundary changes</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND is the only part of the United Kingdom to gain no additional
seats in the House of Commons under boundary changes proposed to
Parliament yesterday.
England gains five more for a total of 529, Wales goes up by two to
40, Northern Ireland gains one to 18 while Scotland retains its current
72. The total number of MPs will increase from 651 to 659.
The Tories are predicted to gain just a handful of seats through the
boundary changes -- compared with initial forecasts of about 20. In
addition, a number of Ministers are threatened by the plans to redraw
the political map.
When this latest review of boundaries was launched, to deal with
shifts in population, the Conservative Party was expected to be the main
beneficiary.
However, the preliminary results of a study commissioned jointly by PA
News, the BBC, ITN and Sky News suggests that if the changes had been in
operation in the 1992 General Election the Conservatives would have
gained just seven extra seats.
Labour would have picked up two extra, while the Liberal Democrats
would have dropped two seats.
The study -- conducted by election experts Dr Colin Rallings and Dr
Michael Thrasher from Plymouth University -- says Labour now needs a
swing of 4.5% from the Tories to gain an overall majority.
For a 50-plus majority, Labour would need a voting swing of 7.2%.
Before the changes, the necessary swing would have been 6%.
The plans are expected to be approved by the Commons and Lords before
the summer recess and come into force at the next General Election --
whenever that happens.
A leading casualty in England is former Chancellor Norman Lamont,
whose Kinston-upon-Thames seat would split between two of its
neighbours.
Ministers who face hunting for a new base because their constituencies
are being abolished include Treasury Financial Secretary Sir George
Young (Ealing Acton), Northern Ireland Minister of State Sir John
Wheeler (Westminster North) and junior Social Security Minister James
Arbuthnot (Wanstead and Woodford).
Deputy Speaker Dame Janet Fookes faces the abolition of her Plymouth
Drake seat.
Some Government members would find their constituencies more marginal.
Those affected include National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell
(Lougborough), Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames (Crawley) and
Solicitor General Sir Derek Spencer (Brighton Pavilion).
Senior Labour MPs who could be affected by the demise of depopulated
inner city seats include Tony Banks (Newham North-West), John Fraser
(Norwood) and Education spokesman Bryan Davies (Oldham Central and
Royton).
The biggest Liberal Democrat loser looks like being Mr David Alton,
whose Mossley Hill seat goes in a reduction of Liverpool's
representation.
However, the Liberal Democrats have been relieved by the reversal of
proposals to scrap the Tweedale, Ettrick and Lauderdale constituency of
former Liberal leader Sir David Steel, who is standing down at the next
election.

THE Marquis of Blandford told magistrates yesterday he had
''completely forgotten'' he was due in court the previous day because of
a depressive illness.
After he failed to appear at a London court, accused of driving
offences, a warrant was issued for his arrest. The 39-year-old Marquis
was detained and taken to Brixton police station before his appearance
yesterday.
Dressed in sweatshirt and jeans, he handed the court a fax from his
doctor stating that he was an in-patient at a London drugs clinic and
had been for three weeks.
He said: ''The court hearing had completely slipped my mind, I'm
afraid. All I can say is from what my doctor said I have been under
great anxiety and depression recently and I don't think I am responsible
for making those decisions.''
He is accused of overtaking on a zebra crossing while riding his
scooter;of failing to accord precedence on the crossing; having no
helmet, no insurance and no test certificate; failing to produce
insurance; and failing to produce a test certificate.
He was further charged with failing to surrender to bail and remanded
on unconditional bail until July 31.

<RECORDNO>978010388</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ROBERT Maxwell was a tough boss with his staff but demanded even more
from his sons Kevin and Ian, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.
Former pensions administrator Trevor Cook, the first witness in the
trial of Ian and Kevin Maxwell and two former Maxwell financial
advisers, was asked to describe life working for the newspaper
publisher.
Mr Alan Suckling, QC, prosecuting, asked Mr Cook what part Maxwell's
youngest sons played in the companies at the beginning.
''As far as I could see, a very small part, if any,'' replied Mr Cook.
He said the position gradually changed as the brothers took on more
important executive roles.
Mr Suckling asked him what sort of boss Robert Maxwell was to work
for.
''An extremely demanding person but at least I felt you knew where you
stood. He was going to take the very important decisions . . . but
allowed one to run the administration affairs as one needed to.''
Mr Cook said: ''He was extremely demanding to all employees but doubly
so to Kevin and Ian.''
By 1991, Mr Kevin Maxwell had taken on the role of second-in-command
and had an office with inter-connecting doors next to his father's.
They were seen regularly in each other's offices and information was
shared readily between them.
Mr Cook went on to explain that Robert Maxwell regularly took
decisions without reference to Kevin. He got the impression that Kevin
shared more information with his father than was shared with him.
Mr Suckling asked Mr Cook how Robert Maxwell appeared in 1991 and was
told: ''In general, perhaps even busier than he had been before but I
suppose as he got older, with slightly less of a grip on things, he
became more of an ordinary man than what one would describe as a
superman.''
Mr Cook said that, in 1991, Kevin was directly concerned with
investments while his father was more involved in pension scheme
benefits.
Mr Ian Maxwell's position was slightly different and he was much less
involved in the pension scheme and financial matters.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, of Oxfordshire, denies conspiring with his
father in the months before his death in November 1991 to defraud the
trustees and beneficiaries of the pension fund by misusing #100m worth
of shares in the Israeli company Scitex to pay the debts of private
Maxwell companies.
Mr Maxwell, his brother Ian, 38, of Westminster, former company
accountant Robert Bunn, 47, of Hertfordshire, and ex-financial adviser
Larry Trachtenberg, 42, of Hampstead, north-west London, deny a similar
charge involving #22m worth of shares in another Israeli company, Teva,
in an attempt to save the Maxwell empire from collapse after Robert
Maxwell's death.
Mr Cook has told the court how Kevin told a meeting of Bishopsgate
Investment Management (BIM), which managed the pension funds, that he
was expecting a large injection of equity and priority would be given to
repaying BIM.
Kevin, who revealed this soon after his father's death, asked Mr Cook
to keep the source of the money -- Israel -- confidential. Mr Cook said
the money never arrived.
Mr Cook was particularly concerned that BIM had not received proceeds
of around #100m due from the sale of Scitex shares. He also was
concerned to track down the exact whereabouts of the Teva shares.
Eventually, he discovered they had been pledged to banks in return for
loans.
Mr Cook, cross-examined by Mr Alun Jones, QC, for Mr Kevin Maxwell,
agreed that Robert Maxwell had become ''a one-man investment manager'',
buying and selling shares as he thought fit.
The trial continues.

LEGAL action aimed at recovering up to #5000m for one million workers
who were given bad advice on pensions in the late eighties was launched
yesterday by the GMB union.
Writs were issued against seven of Britain's biggest insurance
companies in the first batch of test cases, one of which involves a
Glasgow school janitor. They concern individuals who were advised to
leave occupational schemes and join inferior private personal pension
plans in the late 80s.
Prudential, Norwich Union, General Portfolio, the TSB, Abbey Life,
Albany Life, and Manufacturer's Life Insurance are the first targets but
many other cases against other companies are in the pipeline.
The GMB, which is pressing the Serious Fraud Office to investigate
what it sees as a #5000m scandal, believes the sums involved could be on
the scale of the multi-billion dollar cases taken against US asbestos
companies.
Mr John Edmonds, the GMB general secretary, accused the City of trying
to play down the importance of the personal pensions scandal and
declared it was the union's job to ensure justice was done and
compensation won.
''We will hound these companies like terriers until our members have
their money back,'' he said. ''Ordinary people should not have to suffer
a hangover in the 90s by the binge of the finance companies in the
80s.''
He emphasised the pensions rip-off went far deeper than a few rogue
salesmen and that perhaps the Serious Fraud Office should ''feel a few
collars'' in boardrooms. A meeting has been arranged with Mr George
Staple, the SFO director.
Mr Bill Day, the GMB pension officer, said guidelines laid down by the
Personal Investment Authority were inadequate in that they left the
insurance industry as its own judge, jury, and executioner. The union
wants the High Court to decide on compensation levels to cover all
losses and levy exemplary damages.
The GMB estimates that up to one million people could have lost out by
amounts averaging between #25,000 and #30,000 and that twice that number
suffered as a result of being encouraged out of the State Earnings
Related Pension Scheme.
a 50-year-old Glasgow school janitor who was advised by a General
Portfolio sales representative that it would be beneficial for him to
shun the Strathclyde superannuation scheme in favour of a personal
pension plan. He was forced to withdraw from that plan when initial
payments of #80 a month increased progressively to an unaffordable #100
a month.
A spokeswoman for Prudential, which was singled as being ''far and
away the biggest culprit'', last night said it had not received a writ
although 21 cases had been raised with them. These would be reviewed in
line with the guidelines and compensation paid if appropriate.

THE future of the renowned food science laboratory at Torry in
Aberdeen was last night hanging by the narrowest of threads.
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave told the Commons in a written
answer that, as widely rumoured, the research centre was to be closed
and transferred to York.
He said it would operate at a loss in 1995-96. It had high overheads
and had not been able to compete in the research and development market.
However, he also gave the 100 staff a temporary stay of execution,
asking them and the research community in Aberdeen to devise an
alternative proposal within 30 days.
There was confusion last night over the implications of Mr
Waldegrave's statements but sources suggested that, while Torry would
probably close, its functions could remain in the city.
The Aberdeen Research Consortium (Aberdeen University and eight other
scientific institutions in the city) might be able to take over the
laboratory work and still make the savings required.
Mr Waldegrave's offer of breathing space came in a meeting at
Westminster with three Grampian MPs, Labour's Bob Hughes, Tory Raymond
Robertson, and Liberal Democrat Malcolm Bruce.
Mr Bruce said later: ''Mr Waldegrave started off by saying that Torry
was unviable and that he was going to announce its closure. But after
some robust exchanges, he adjourned the meeting and then came back and
admitted that it would be churlish not to consider options other than
closure.''
Mr Robertson said: ''We batted hard today for the laboratory, and we
achieved a 30-day breathing space. It is up to the scientific community
to see if they can come up with a package we can persuade Mr Waldegrave
to accept.''
Mr Hughes said: ''We have not got much time, but we have managed to
get the opportunity for alternatives to be considered. We have been
assured by the research community that the work done at Torry is
valuable and needs to be maintained. It is now a challenge for them --
we have done what we can.''
Members of Aberdeen's business, industrial, political, and academic
communities will do everything in their power to ensure that the lab --
the only one in Scotland specialising in food safety -- does not close.
Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang announced yesterday that he had
arranged for important fisheries and hydrocarbon research to be retained
in Aberdeen. It will transfer from the food science laboratory to the
nearby Marine Laboratory, controlled by the Scottish Office.

The circumstances surrounding the drowning tragedy in the former
Soviet state of Belarus, which has left Aberdeen District Council
mourning the loss of two of its most senior officials, are still not
known.
Deputy chief executive Ms Ann Hughes, 44, and principal environmental
health officer Mr Iain McDonald, 36, who became a father for the second
time only five weeks ago, are said to have drowned after being struck by
a boat while swimming in a river at Gomel, Aberdeen's twin city.
They were part of a delegation of 41 from Aberdeen who flew to Gomel
last week.
Ms Hughes, who has a 24-year-old daughter, and Mr McDonald, who is
survived by his wife, Louise, and his children, Katie, 4, and baby Jon,
were members of an environmental project team looking at ways of helping
Gomel, which is in the area most affected by the Chernobyl disaster.
Officials were having a rest day on Sunday and were taken by their
hosts to a beach by a major river in Gomel, where thousands of people
were enjoying temperatures in the 80s and 90s.
It appears the two officials were swimming when they were struck by a
boat but apparently no-one was aware of the incident for some time and
their bodies may not yet have been recovered.
Last night, a Foreign Office spokesman said that, having spoken to the
British Embassy in Minsk, the Belarus authorities had confirmed the two
''were killed by a passing boat at 21.30 on Sunday, June 4''.
The spokesman said it was not clear if the bodies had been found but
it was possible that they had because of the official confirmation of
the names.
Last night, Aberdeen City Council international officer Alison
Cameron, who speaks Russian, flew to Gomel to assist.
The environmental project team was due to arrive back in Aberdeen
today but it is not clear what arrangements will now be made.
A major investigation has been launched by the Gomel authorities.
Aberdeen District Council staff are reported to be shocked by the
tragedy. Chief executive Anne Mearns said there was a stunned silence in
the council headquarters.
Ms Mearns said: ''I, and the management team, and all staff, are
absolutely devastated by the news. I enjoyed and benefited from Ann's
quick wit and we enjoyed sparking ideas off each other. It's difficult
to imagine the council without her -- she was a prodigious worker who
will be difficult to replace.
''Iain will be remembered for his great willingness to listen to
others' points of view. He was always keen to develop his own
professional knowledge as well as serving others as a trade union
representative.
''It will be some time before we all come to terms with what has
happened.''
Ms Hughes joined Aberdeen District Council in 1992 from Tayside
Regional Council, where she was principal solicitor. Before that she
worked for Fife Regional Council.
She led the council through the traumatic period following the
resignation in disgrace of chief executive Mr Donald Macdonald.
Mr McDonald had worked for the council for 16 years and lived in
Kingswells outside Aberdeen.
Lord Provost James Wyness said: ''My wife and I are both personally
devastated -- as is everyone working on the council. It is a terrible
tragedy and my first thoughts go out to the families of both council
officials.
''We still haven't had all the information we need but what we have
been told is that two senior council officials died in a very tragic
accident.
''On behalf of the city, may I send my sincere condolences and
sympathies to the two families. Both officials were well respected and
highly skilled professionals.
''To be honest, the enormity of it all hasn't really sunk in.''
Policy convener Councillor Margaret Farquhar said: ''We are all
devastated. It really is a terrible blow.''
Aberdeen was twinned with Gomel five years ago and several projects
were being carried out by the delegation. Many of the team were staying
as guests of Gomel residents and it is understood there was some
difficulty contacting them all to inform them of the tragedy.

THE top woman in Scotland's prison service, Mrs Kate Donegan, deputy
governor of Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow, is to move to the Scottish
Prisons Inspectorate after only a year in the post.
Mrs Donegan, a mother of two sons, has been widely tipped to become
the first female governor of a major prison in what is traditionally a
male world. However, insiders said yesterday that what is seen as a
career move is likely to speed her progress rather than hinder it.
The role of the prisons inspectorate is being strengthened, much as
the role of the police inspectorate has in recent years, on both sides
of the Border.
Mrs Donegan, 42, will join the inspectorate as number three behind the
independent chief inspector, Mr Clive Fairweather, and his deputy, Mr
Ron Kite, also a prison governor.
She said yesterday: ''This is a tremendous opportunity. I still retain
an avid interest in the whole business of the Scottish Prison Service.
The dynamics of the relationship between the custodians and the prisoner
continues to fascinate me.''
She added that the opportunity to join the inspectorate will, to some
extent, assuage her curiosity by giving her an opportunity to visit
other establishments, in England as well as Scotland, to see how others
go about the business of prisons.
Mrs Donegan began her career 18 years ago, working in jails such as
Cornton Vale, Glenochil and Perth. Before becoming deputy governor of
Barlinnie, she worked at SPS headquarters as head of manpower planning
between 1991 and 1994.
She then became a key member of the SPS staffing structure review
which produced a slimmer, harder organisation designed to face up to the
challenges of growing private sector involvement in prisons.

TWO rapists who subjected a schoolgirl to a brutal attack were given
detention sentences at the High Court in Perth last night.
Edward Townsley, 21, who also assaulted a second girl, was jailed for
seven years. William McIntyre, 17, was sent to a young offenders
institution for five years.
The pair, both of Perth, were convicted of assaulting a 15-year-old
girl in the centre of Perth, repeatedly striking her head against the
wall and ground in a tenement close, knocking her unconscious, and
repeatedly raping her.
They denied committing the crime on a Saturday evening last February
but, following a five-day trial, the jury returned a majority verdict of
guilty in respect of both.
The jury also unanimously convicted Townsley of indecently assaulting
a second girl on the same occasion with intent to rape her.
The girls, who were on a night out to celebrate the end of school
exams, said their ordeal started when six males surrounded a telephone
kiosk as they were about to call a friend.
The rape victim, until then a virgin, said she was knocked unconscious
and came round to find a man having intercourse with her.
She said that after being knocked out a second time she awoke to find
a second man on top of her.

DOMESTIC electricity prices in Scotland fell by about 4% in real terms
in the past five years, according to Professor Stephen Littlechild,
director general of electricity supply, in his annual report published
yesterday.
They were now about 4% lower than the average in England and Wales, he
said.
Professor Littlechild said customers above 100kw maximum demand had
been able to choose their supplier since April 1994. Evidence suggested
this opening up of the market had brought price reductions of up to 20%.
The 6000 sites in the competitive market consumed about half of the
total electricity used in Scotland. However, few customers, about 5%,
had changed to a second-tier supplier.

A SERIES of demonstrations is planned at hospitals throughout Scotland

offers being made around the country pitting trust against trust. In
some cases the offers actually cut the earning power of health service
workers by imposing totally unacceptable strings.''
The Royal College of Nursing has called a meeting of all unions in
Scotland to preserve the united front against the Government. This was
broken two weeks ago when Unison criticised the RCN's stance and failure
to attend a UK meeting of unions.
Last night, it seemed unlikely Unison would send a representative to
the RCN meeting in Edinburgh to which midwives, health visitors, and
community and district nurse delegates have also been invited.

A NEW computer software centre opened in East Kilbride yesterday with
the promise that it would help to create jobs and stimulate economic
development.
Mr Crawford Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise,
officially opened the Strathclyde Software Innovation Centre (SSIC) in
the town's Technology Park. It will provide premises for new and
existing businesses.
Mr Beveridge said: ''By the end of this century information technology
will be the world's largest industry accounting for one quarter of the
world's gross national product. Information technology represents a
bigger opportunity than possibly any previous market in history.
''Our experience is that each time we have set up an environment like
this it has filled up very quickly. There are 10 companies in this
centre already and it provides a tremendous opportunity for others.''
He said the centre would create jobs and encourage economic
development, helping Scotland to compete effectively in the worldwide
software community.
The SSIC is the sixth of its kind in Scotland. A competition to mark
its opening will award #10,000 to the winner of the newly created
Scottish Software Innovation of the Year Award.
The winner will be a business person setting up a firm for the first
time with the creation of an innovative software product or service. It
will be required to locate in the SSIC and will be given one year's
premises rent free, plus #6000 for the development and marketing of the
product.

THE St Enoch Centre ice rink in Glasgow was closed yesterday by its
English owners because of what they claimed was a ''lack of public
support''.
The joint owners, the Church of England Commissioners and Sears, said
they had concluded that the rink, which opened five years ago, could not
continue as a viable proposition and that the way forward lay with a
retail development.
Mr George Ritchie, manager of the St Enoch Centre, Glasgow's biggest
shopping centre, said: ''We believe the best way forward is to respond
to the current high demand for prime retail space in the city centre.
''The closure releases valuable space which could attract major retail
investment new to Scotland which would strengthen the city centre's
ability to compete with out-of-town developments.''
However, while they are entitled to close the rink the owners will
have to secure change of use permission from Glasgow District Council --
permission they have tried unsuccessfully to win in the past.
A council spokesman said last night: ''The owners have applied for
change of use on several occasions and have been refused because the
original agreement was to have a rink. Councillors are still keen that
the rink be maintained. I think they will feel a little let down.''
This was echoed by Councillor Pat Lally, Labour leader of Glasgow
District Council, who said: ''It was a condition of planning that there
was a leisure facility. They are reneging on their commitment to the
city and I don't think they can reasonably do that.
''With proper marketing there is no reason the rink can't be a
success.''
Councillor Bill Aitken, the council's Tory group leader, said he would
be against further retail use.
Mr Ritchie said the decision to close the rink was regrettable but
unavoidable.
During 1990, the first year the rink had been in operation, attendance
had averaged 5000 a week, he said. However, it had witnessed a steady
decrease in skaters from 1991. By 1992, the average weekly attendance
had plunged to 2000 and had continued to fall to a point well below the
numbers needed to allow it to remain open.
In 1993 a skating club was formed to encourage experienced skaters. It
had proved successful but had not added to the regular customer base for
general skating sessions.
''We are doing all we can to ensure that our regular skaters are
accommodated at other rinks at East Kilbride and Coatbridge,'' said Mr
Ritchie.
The landlords are confident a further retail development would create
extra jobs. Ice rink staff -- four full-time and nine part-time -- will
be given the chance to find alternative jobs in the St Enoch Centre.

A REVIEW board will decide soon whether Paratrooper Lee Clegg, serving
a life term for the murder of a teenager in Northern Ireland, will be
freed.
The Northern Ireland Life Sentence Review Board yesterday considered
his case and will pass a recommendation to Northern Ireland Secretary
Sir Patrick Mayhew.
Clegg, 26, was jailed for life for the murder of 17-year-old Karen
Reilly, shot dead in the passenger seat of a stolen car in West Belfast
in September 1990. He is serving his term in Wakefield Prison.
If the board recommends his release, Sir Patrick will consult the
trial judge and the Northern Ireland Lord Chief Justice before
announcing his decision.
It could be anything from two days to four weeks before Clegg is told
his fate.
However, because of the huge public interest in the case, Sir Patrick
is expected to act quickly to reach a decision.
Clegg's lawyer, Mr Simon McKay, said the board's recommendation was
being passed to Sir Patrick ''with all due haste''.
However, he attacked the decision to refuse to inform his client of
the recommendation.
The 12-member review board met at Stormont for three-and-a-half hours
to consider the case of Clegg and 10 other cases, including several
loyalist and republican prisoners.
All the others have served at least 10 years of their life sentences
-- the normal minimum period before a release is considered. However,
the Clegg case was reviewed early because of what the prison service
called ''mitigating factors''.
He has served just three years of his sentence for murdering Miss
Reilly, who was shot beside convicted car thief Martin Peake, the
vehicle's driver, who also died.
Sinn Fein, which has called for the release of all prisoners jailed as
a result of the conflict in Northern Ireland, has warned that freeing
Clegg in isolation could damage the peace process.

TWO veteran rockers were yesterday honoured at a lunch which raised
money for the music industry's favourite charity.
Midge Ure and Jack Bruce received awards at the event in aid of the
Nordoff Robbins charity, which helps disabled people communicate through
music.
The charity's first unit north of the Border, at St Joseph's in the
Rosewell area of Edinburgh, opened two weeks ago.
Ure, 41, who has found success with Slik, the Rich Kids, Ultravox, and
as a solo artist had flown from Los Angeles to pick up the Silver Clef
award for outstanding achievement at the ceremony at the Roxburghe
Hotel, Edinburgh.
He arrived accompanied by actress Sheridan Forbes.
He said: ''I'm very proud to be a musician. I am humbled to think that
music can actually do something beyond putting a smile on your face, and
I'm proud to be associated with Nordoff Robbins which is a wonderful
organisation.''
Jack Bruce, who was part of the supergroup Cream, received a special
achievement award from Radio Forth DJ Jay Crawford.
He said he had long been aware of the therapeutic qualities of music
-- ''after all, I'm still alive''.
Yesterday's was the first time the two Scottish rockers had met,
although Ure said he used to try and copy Bruce's guitar playing.
''Cream were a great band. The only way you could learn to play guitar
was to sit down and analyse what Jack Bruce did, and that's what I did
when I bought my first electric guitar when I was 15.''
Other guests at the event included footballer Charlie Nicholas and
Stuart Adamson from Big Country.
Pop and rock stars from Scotland donated a number of items which were
auctioned after the ceremony to raise money for the organisation to
train more music therapists.
These included a guitar signed by Jack Bruce and a platinum disc given
by Rod Stewart.
Nordoff Robbins has long been one of the industy's favourite causes,
because of the use of music in the therapy.
Top names in the business, including Elton John, George Michael, Paul
McCartney, Pink Floyd and Wet Wet Wet have all worked for the
organisation.

<HEADLINE>Attack on Bosnia statue at refugee centre</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A STATUE entitled Bosnian Cry has been attacked within days of being
positioned in the grounds of a refugee centre in North Berwick.
An arm of the 5 ft high work, showing a woman holding a baby, has been
ripped off.
The damage, which follows opposition to the statue in the East Lothian
town, has been given a temporary repair by artist Mr David Hunwick.
The incident left the local community council in a quandary over
whether to hold a small, quiet ceremony to mark the siting of the statue
or make a big splash of it at a later date. However, the council set a
provisional date for a small ceremony for June 16. And it intends to
invite some of the Bosnian refugees now settled in Scotland.
Members were told at a meeting last night that a number of people in
the town had expressed serious concern about the statue because of the
current UN troops hostage situation in the former Yugoslavia.
Several people were said to be very unhappy about holding any official
opening ceremony to mark the siting of the statue. It was described as
being a ''sensitive'' situation.
Community council chairwoman Ms Elma Banks described the damage to the
statue as ''very sad''.
The statue will be marked with a simple plaque. In two years a more
detailed explanatory plaque will be placed.
Plans to erect the statue caused a storm last month. Community leaders
accepted an offer of a sculpture given free of charge. And East Lothian
District Council agreed to maintain and insure the sculpture.
However, critics of the scheme claimed that 170 Bosnian refugees who
fled to the safe haven of North Berwick had left the refugee centre in a
mess.
In defence, the Scottish Refugee Council said that the language
barrier posed problems for the new arrivals. Many of the Bosnians had
been in concentration camps, lost all their worldly goods, and seen
relatives killed.
The refugee centre closed more than a year ago.

HAROLD WILSON, the Prime Minister who is said to have burned himself
out for Britain, was buried yesterday on the Isles of Scilly in a grave
overlooking one of the unspoilt bays he loved so much.
Former Labour Premier Lord Callaghan and the party's current leader
Tony Blair joined hundreds of islanders and holidaymakers in a final
farewell.
Lord Wilson, who died on May 24, aged 79, had a 35-year love affair
with the remote island of St Mary's, 28 miles west of Land's End. And he
was given the islander's funeral that his widow, Lady Wilson, had wished
for him.
First there was the hour-long service in the 160-year-old parish
church of St Mary the Virgin in Hugh Town, where Lord Wilson had
worshipped. Then the oak coffin was carried in a slow procession to a
tiny, 900-year-old church, St Mary's, for burial -- an island tradition.
Lady Wilson and the other mourners filed slowly past the front gate of
Lowenva, the modest bungalow she and Lord Wilson built on the island in
the 1960s.
The man who built it, former Scillies council chairman Sam Ellis, said
after the ceremony: ''It was the biggest funeral on Scilly this century.
Everyone will miss him.''
Methodist minister the Rev Brian Mavers, who gave a short address at
the service, said afterwards: ''It was a great Scillonian affair.''
Lord Wilson regularly escaped to the Scillies when in power to get
away from the pressures of political life and he valued the solitude of
the uninhabited outer islands.
He was regarded almost as an islander, and Scillonians packed the
parish church to say goodbye.
Members of the Labour hierarchy, past and present, flew to the
sundrenched islands to pay their last respects. They included former
Cabinet Minister Baroness Castle, ''kitchen cabinet'' member Gerald
Kaufman, and Lord Wilson's Cabinet secretary Lady Falkender.
Lady Wilson herself was accompanied by her two sons, Dr Robin Wilson
and his family, and Giles Wilson.
The Prime Minister was represented by St Ives Conservative MP David
Harris, whose constituency includes the Scillies. He said the Scillies
was the place Lord and Lady Wilson ''loved above all others''.
Among the two dozen wreaths were flowers from Mr Major and his wife
and the Prince's Council of the Duchy of Cornwall, which owns the
islands.
There were also wreaths from colleagues in the House of Lords and from
local organisations, including the St Mary's Boatmen's Association and
the lifeboat crew.
In his address, Lord Tonypandy, who as George Thomas was Speaker of
the House of Commons, said: ''We thank God for a wonderful life. We
thank God for the life and achievements of one who burned himself out
for Britain. History is certain to place Lord Wilson among its
parliamentary giants.''
The island's two-man police force was expanded to 10 for the funeral.
And they ensured a smooth path for the slow, 35-minute procession,
during which relays of lifeboatmen, firemen, and gig racers carried the
coffin along the narrow island road to the picturesque, palm-shaded
graveyard.
The coffin, draped in the flag of Trinity House, of which Lord Wilson
was an honorary member, was laid to rest in the flower-scented graveyard
overlooking the tiny, crescent-shaped Old Town Bay.

A PROPOSED transfer of 3500 council houses from Wigtown District
Council to a private association has been criticised by independent
advisers.
A report to the council by Glasgow-based Thenew Housing Association --
which was appointed the official tenants' adviser -- said the deal had
been pushed ahead too quickly and tenants had not been supplied with the
full facts.
In a separate development, the Wigtown Tenants' Liaison/Monitoring
Group has withdrawn its support for the deal and some members will now
actively campaign against the transfer.
The #36m sale has also attracted criticism from Labour MPs for alleged
breaches of Scottish Office guidelines.
The critical report, which was discussed by Wigtown councillors at a
special housing committee meeting this week, said: ''Consultation with
tenants and the provision of information to them has been limited by the
overall timescale involved in the transfer process to date, the lack of
information about specific aspects of the proposal until the last two
weeks, and the absence of a business plan and related financial
information.''
It added that Thenew had not been able to fulfil certain aspects of
its brief, such as giving comprehensive advice to tenants and carrying
out proper negotiations with the prospective landlord.
The advisers first said a ballot, due to take place next month, should
be postponed because of the ''disappointing lack of material to
substantiate the financial and technical aspects of the proposal''.
However, more information was provided and now Thenew, despite
maintaining some reservations, has said that if the vote goes ahead,
tenants should at least be provided with certain safeguards to ensure
they will be properly represented and protected.

<TEXT>
THE chairman of the telecommunications firm, Cable &amp; Wireless, has
taken a pay cut of almost #300,000, it was revealed yesterday.
Lord Young, the former Employment Minister, reduced his salary because
of the fall of #244m in the company's pre-tax profits.
The news is in sharp contrast to recent executive pay increases,
including the 75% rise for British Gas chief executive Mr Cedric Brown.
Lord Young, who still took home #479,247 compared to #777,163 the year
before, was frank about the reasons for his cut.
''The terms of our compensation scheme are rigorous. No growth, no
bonus,'' he said in his annual report.
Profits fell from #1088m to #844m because of costs in restructuring
C&amp;W's Mercury network and provision for goodwill gestures to businesses
to be disposed of.
Lord Young was mindful of stories focusing on the so-called ''fat
cat'' salary rises.
He said: ''There's been substantial discussion over recent months of
directors' pay. Although this debate is welcome, the tone of some of the
debate is not helpful to the future prosperity of our economy.''

THE chairman of the Scottish Sports Council yesterday welcomed a cash
bonanza for sport in Scotland, with 13 projects being awarded almost #3m
from the Lottery Sports Fund.
Mr Graeme Simmers said, however, that he believed the percentage that
went to good causes should be ''adjusted''.
''Sport would, therefore, automatically get an increased share as well
as the others,'' he said in Stirlingshire in the wake of an announcement
of National Lottery organisers Camelot's multi-million pound profits.
Yesterday's #2.9m hand-out by the Sports Council was the largest
Scottish announcement to date. The awards from Lottery profits are part
of a series of monthly grants which look set to reach up to #20m by the
end of the year. More than #5m has now been distributed to all types of
sports projects.
Mr Simmers, speaking at Grangemouth Athletics Stadium, said the impact
of the Lottery's cash injection into sport could not be under-estimated.
Top Scots athlete Tom McKean said the cash was marvellous for Scottish
sport.
''We can't compete with the English because of numbers of
population,'' he said. ''And athletes like Yvonne Murray, Liz McColgan,
and myself are not getting any younger. I hope these facilities will
entice young people to sport.''
The largest of yesterday's awards -- #750,000 -- has gone to the
Atlantis Leisure in Oban to help develop a regional sports hall. Falkirk
District Council has been awarded #520,000 towards the development of a
national indoor training facility -- the first in Central region.

<HEADLINE>Forces' gays await test case ruling</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978010406</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FOUR homosexuals who were discharged from the armed forces regardless
of their ''exemplary'' service records, will hear today if they have won
their High Court test case.
Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Curtis will deliver their
judgment in the cases of the four who were ''administratively
discharged'' from the services because they were gay.
Counsel for the four, Mr David Pannick, QC, has accused the Ministry
of Defence of ''pandering to irrational prejudice and intolerance'' by
maintaining an anti-gay policy.
Their homosexuality had in no way interfered with their duties or
service discipline and, by its own policy, the Ministry was robbing
itself of the dedication and skill which members of the gay community
could bring to the armed forces, he told the court.
Ministry claims that there are ''special reasons why a disciplined
force needs to exclude all homosexuals'' did not ''begin to withstand
objective scrutiny''.
Mr Pannick claimed that the ''irrational'' policy flew in the face of
both domestic and European Community law principles.
The Ministry had failed to give one single example of homosexuality
causing discipline problems and, if there was a risk that gays in the
forces might be open to blackmail, that was a direct result of the
policy itself, he added.
But Mr Stephen Richards, for the Ministry of Defence, insisted that
the policy was justified on ''national security'' grounds, and was
essential to maintain service discipline and morale.
Mr Richards claimed the policy had ''always been the province of the
royal prerogative'' with which the High Court had no power to interfere.
The four homosexuals involved in the case are: former Royal Navy
rating John Beckett, 26, of Westfield, Sheffield, who was discharged
from the service in June 1993 after informing his superiors of his
homosexuality on the advice of a naval chaplain.
Former RAF enrolled nurse and senior aircraft woman Jeanette Smith,
28, of Leith, Edinburgh, who was discharged in September 1994 over her
stable lesbian relationship with a civilian.
Former Royal Navy Lieutenant-Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, 36, from
Southfields, London, who was discharged as ''unsuitable'' at the end of
last year just months after being commended by his commanding officer.
And former RAF sergeant Graeme Grady, 32, of West Hampstead, London,
who was also discharged solely because of his homosexuality and despite
his exemplary service record.
If the four are granted a declaration that the policy to
administratively discharge all gays from the armed forces is unlawful,
they are expected to pursue damages claims for unfair dismissal.

A HIGH Court jury was yesterday asked to award ''massive'' libel
damages to former Rangers and Liverpool manager Graeme Souness over a
newspaper story which described him as him a ''dirty rat''.
Lord Williams, QC, for Souness, who is about to take up a post with
Turkish club Galatasaray, said the May 1993 story in the People was the
cruellest libel possible for a man who was so fond of his family.
He told Mr Justice Morland and a jury of 10 men and two women that the
Sunday Souness saw the exclusive interview with his ex-wife, Danielle,
was one he would never forget and from which he had still not recovered.
''He felt completely numb. He couldn't believe it.''
Headed ''You're a dirty rat Souness'', the front-page splash alleged
he had ordered her and their children to leave their Surrey farmhouse
home by the previous Christmas Eve and had refused to pay school fees
for their sons, Frazer and Jordan, then aged 12 and eight.
It claimed that Danielle was living on hand-outs from her parents, and
that even before the ''eviction'' she had to grovel to Souness for cash
to feed and clothe the children.
Souness, 42, and his second wife, Karen, sat yards from Danielle, 39,
as Lord Williams told the court: ''When Judas betrayed Jesus he got 30
pieces of silver. She (Danielle) got #15,000.''
The story was ''vicious, savage, and untrue'' and was published
without anyone from the paper contacting Souness. The jury should award
him ''massive'' damages.
Publishers MGN Ltd deny libel and say the story is true.
Lord Williams said Souness married Danielle, who came from a wealthy
family, in 1980. He adopted Chantelle, the daughter of her first
marriage, and doted on the couple's two sons.
''Apart from his current wife, they are the most important thing in
his life''.
After Danielle left him in the autumn of 1988, the couple signed an
agreement in which he promised to pay for the children's education in
the UK -- which at the time was costing #10,000 each.
He also gave Danielle a cash sum of #560,000 and land in Majorca worth
another #500,000.
Souness bought her and the children a farmhouse in Surrey and spent
#250,000 doing it up.
Lord Williams said Danielle refused to sign any agreement stopping her
from living at the farm forever, or committing her to a contribution
towards its purchase price or a rent of #100 per month.
At the end of 1992, after Souness had survived open-heart surgery and
had met Karen, he began to think about his own future and his solicitors
gave Danielle 28 days notice to quit.
But it was never enforced and Souness never turned the family out.
Danielle stayed in the house until February 1993 when she took the
children to Majorca.
Lord Williams said Souness stopped paying school fees because he was
not satisfied the children -- one of whom was dyslexic -- would be
properly taught outside the UK.
He said that the People ran the story that weekend because it thought
that Souness was going to be sacked from Liverpool and was already ''on
his knees''. In fact, he stayed until the next spring when he resigned.
Giving evidence, Souness choked back tears as Lord Williams asked him:
''Have you ever treated your sons or Chantelle in such a way as to
deserve being called a dirty rat?''
''Never,'' he said. ''Because of the job I had, I experienced great
emotional highs, but when you have a child it eclipses everything else.
''I think I am like most fathers -- your children are the most
important thing on this planet.''
Lord Williams asked if Danielle had ever had to ''grovel''.
''Never,'' said Souness. ''She knew if there was ever a problem, if
she needed anything for the children, it was only a phone call.''
He had adopted Chantelle because ''I didn't feel we would be a
complete family if she wasn't mine''.
Souness, youngest of three sons of an Edinburgh glazier, said his
success had made him wealthy, but he and Danielle had come from
''enormously different'' backgrounds.
She had stood to inherit money when she was 30 and, for tax reasons,
she and her family had to leave the UK for Majorca.
He went with them on a three-year contract with Italian club Sampdoria
but returned after two years to become player-manager of Rangers.
''My wife did not like Scotland. It was too wet and too cold for
her.''
He stayed in Glasgow for five years, visiting his family by plane, but
eventually he and Danielle parted.
''She was happy living in Majorca. Her ideal was for me to go there
and do nothing. But I had always wanted to work. That was the way I had
been brought up,'' Souness said.
Souness was capped 54 times for Scotland and led Liverpool at the peak
of their success in the 1980s.
The case continues.

THE furore surrounding the leaked draft report of the Scott inquiry
continued at Westminster yesterday, with Mr Major launching an attack on
Labour ''smears'', and Baroness Thatcher reportedly also criticised over
the affair.
Mr William Waldegrave, the Agriculture Minister, accused in the draft
report of giving false information to MPs, said he had no intention of
resigning and had written a rebuttal of the findings which he was
confident would alter the final report.
Some Ministers may reject the findings of the inquiry into the
arms-to-Iraq affair when this final report eventually appears. Several
are understood to have taken issue with Sir Richard Scott's findings in
the draft report, of which they received copies last week.
The Prime Minister made it clear in the Commons he does not feel bound
to accept the report in its entirety: he would study it and reach a
conclusion. Mr Major angrily condemned the ''malicious'' leak and
accused Opposition parties of launching a smear campaign.
Baroness Thatcher is allegedly criticised by Sir Richard for making
''inaccurate'' statements on her Government's policy on arms sales to
Iraq in a further alleged leak. She is accused of writing a letter in
1989 saying Government policy on arms sales to the Baghdad regime had
not changed, even though she had read a Ministry of Defence document
which said there had been a shift.
The fresh allegations are made in the Independent newspaper which
claims to have another extract of the draft report.
Mr Major has also written to Sir Richard replying to the preliminary
finding that as Foreign Secretary he signed ''inaccurate'' letters but
was not properly briefed.
Labour's deputy leader John Prescott pressed the Prime Minister to
make it clear that any Minister who the inquiry found had misled the
Commons would be asked to resign. Mr Major replied: ''I am making no
judgments on what might be in the report until the report is
published.''
Ministers whose role in the provision of arms to Iraq are likely to be
questioned by the report include the Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who has
said he would resign if criticised.
Ministers were said to be involved in either the arms sales or the
signing of ''gagging'' certificates to block evidence in the
Matrix-Churchill trial which involved executives of the firm accused of
breaching the arms embargo.
The leak to the BBC of the preliminary draft, copies of which have
been sent to around 30 people criticised by the judge, was attacked
fiercely by Conservative MPs.
Mr Major was equally scathing, especially of the role of shadow
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who, he said, had taken a partial extract
of an incomplete report before it had been responded to and ''appeared
in every studio in the land to smear someone''.
Opinion was divided at Westminster about whether the leak was more
damaging to the Government or the inquiry itself.
Mr Waldegrave's Parliamentary Private Secretary, Mr Oliver Heald, said
the draft had alleged facts which were wrong.
In a statement, Mr Waldegrave defiantly maintained his innocence.
''There is no plausible reason why my officials should have encouraged
or permitted me to mislead Parliament. I did not.
''There is no conceivable reason why I should wish to have taken the
absurd risk of consciously misleading Parliament for personal or
political gain.''
There was also criticism of Sir Richard for not taking out an
injunction to prevent the BBC broadcasting the leak, although he wrote
to the Corporation an hour before the Nine O'Clock News bulletin went
out asking for it not to be used.
Sir Richard said the leak amounted to ''improper use of confidential
material'' and pledged to publish his final report as soon as possible.
At the moment, it has been delayed until September.

SEVENTEEN British soldiers held hostage by Bosnian Serbs were reported
to have been freed early today amongst a party of 108 UN peacekeepers.
Those released also included 60 Ukrainians, 20 French and a Spanish
soldier, a Serbian official said.
Mr Jovica Stanisic, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's state
security chief who accompanied the hostages out of Bosnia, said he
expected the remaining hostages still held by the Bosnian Serbs to be
released ''very soon''.
''We now have with us 108 UN personnel. We hope in due course other
members of the UN will be released.''
Asked when that might be, he said: ''We expect it very soon.''
Six Britons still remain hostage.
Some 22 Royal Welch Fusiliers and a British military observer were
held before today's release.
Two buses carrying the 108 crossed into Serbia early today, it was
reported.
The first busload contained 58 peacekeepers: 43 Ukrainians, 14
Frenchmen and one Spaniard. It had been reported on the Bosnian Serb
side of the Drina river border hours earlier.
The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said they had to wait for more
peacekeepers to come and join the convoy.
Stanisic arrived at 1am local time across the border with a
double-decker bus and a coach containing the peacekeepers, accompanied
by scores of police cars. Curtains were drawn across the windows of the
buses.
''We have been continuing our mission for releasing members of the
United Nations,'' he said at the Mali Zvornik border post.
''We are convinced that among the leadership of Republika Srpska (the
self-styled Bosnian Serb republic) there is a positive atmosphere
concerning the international community.''
With today's release, just under 150 peackeepers remained in Bosnian
Serb hands.
A first group of 121 was released on Friday after pressure from
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on the Bosnian Serb leadership.
The Bosnian Serbs seized hundreds of UN hostages after two Nato air
raids on their ammunition dumps and demanded guarantees of no more Nato
airstrikes before agreeing to release any of them.
The release of more hostages had appeared imminent on Monday when
Milosevic sent Stanisic to the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled capital Pale
for talks with leader Radovan Karadzic.
Stanisic was the man who oversaw the transfer of the first batch of
peacekeepers last week.
Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Defence Minister
Gerasimos Arsenis came out optimistic from a meeting with Milosevic in
Belgrade yesterday afternoon after holding six hours of talks last night
with the Bosnian Serb leadership in Pale.
Earlier, French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said during an emergency
debate in the French Parliament that the Bosnian Serbs were heading down
a suicidal path if they failed to free the hostages.
At the same time, the American Army command in Europe announced that
up to 1500 US soliders would join 2000 others already stationed in
northern Italy for training exercises called ''Mountain Shield''.
The troop movement follows a US statement on Monday that it would move
3500 troops and about 100 helicopters to Italy to support any UN
withdrawal from Bosnia.
However, pressure built in Washington for President Clinton's
administration to clarify what role American troops might play in the
region. Republicans complained that Congress was not being consulted.
''I've read more press references to consultation and had less
consultations than at any time I can remember,'' House Speaker Newt
Gingrich said.
Defense Secretary William Perry and General John Shalikashvili,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are to appear before the Senate
Armed Services Committee today to explain Bosnian policy.
'I want to bring out the danger of our getting bogged down in
Bosnia,'' said Senator Strom Thurmond, a Republican from South Carolina
and committee chairman. ''It's a quagmire.''
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said he would introduce a resolution
limiting any US ground action in Bosnia to assisting in a complete UN
withdrawal. He criticised plans to beef up the peacekeeping force.
Nato sources said the Alliance had accelerated its plans for a
possible pull-out of UN troops from Bosnia if attempts to bolster the
mission prove unsuccessful.
The latest Bosnian Serb blockade of aid deliveries to Sarajevo and
other besieged Muslim enclaves is causing increasing humanitarian
problems.
''The situation now is pretty much as serious as it's ever been,'' UN
High Commissioner for Refugees official Mark Cutts said.
''The UNHCR airlift into Sarajevo has now been suspended for two
months, and we've had no convoys into Sarajevo or any of the other
enclaves for two weeks.''
Two civilians were killed and a third injured yesterday when five
shells slammed into Bihac town, one of the UN-ordered ''safe areas''.
The eastern Bosnian enclave of Gorazde also came under shell fire,
with two 82mm mortar bombs landing near the UN base.
Heavy sniper fire in the Bosnian capital sent civilians sprinting
across a major crossroads near the battered presidency building as UN
anti-sniping squads scoured surrounding hills for firing points.
Elsewhere, a British soldier suffered a head injury in a traffic
accident near the town of Konjic. He was taken to the British base in
Gornji Vakuf for treatment.--Reuter.

A YEAR to the day after a young Aberdeenshire father was brutally
stabbed to death in the early hours of the morning in his own home, his
wife has been cleared of his murder.
The trial of Mrs Nawal Nicol, previously al-Kowarri, at Forfar High
Court ended when, after only four witnesses, the Crown announced it was
dropping the charges, which included inciting two men to kill her
husband Stuart on the promise of #25,000.
Jason Simpson, 21, who said in evidence he was her lover, and Muir
Middler, who admitted plunging a six-inch knife into the 29-year-old
salesman whose two-year-old son was asleep upstairs, are serving life
sentences for the murder of Nicol.
They were found guilty after a trial in Aberdeen last October but no
details of the case were allowed to be reported to avoid prejudicing
proceedings which were to be taken against Mrs Nicol.
The Crown had alleged that Mrs Nicol had conspired with Simpson and
Muir to murder her husband and that one plot was to take him to Slains
Castle, drug him, and throw him over the cliffs.
Simpson said in evidence on the first day of her trial that she had
not offered money but had asked him and Middler to kill her husband and
suggested that they could pretend to be burglars who killed him when he
discovered them in their home at Ellon.
He claimed they followed her plan except they were going to tell him
of the murder plot instead of killing him. He said Middler pulled a
knife and stabbed him without warning.
The Crown case collapsed after evidence yesterday morning by a friend
of the Nicol family, Mr Simon Tees, 29, from Portlethen, near Aberdeen.
He said that three weeks before his death, Mr Nicol had broken down in
tears at his house and had claimed his wife was ''up to something''.
''He was petrified. I have never seen anyone so scared,'' said Mr
Tees.
Advocate-depute James Campbell asked Mr Tees what had scared Mr Nicol.
He replied that his greatest fear was his wife would go to the Middle
East to see her father and take the couple's young son, Damien, with
her.
After Mr Tees had given his evidence Mr Campbell told the court that,
in light of the evidence heard so far, he did not intend to proceed
further with the charge.
He told Lord Johnston he had discussed the matter with the Lord
Advocate.
Mrs Nicol, 30, who throughout the trial had sat with her head bowed
sobbing occasionally looked bewildered until she realised she was free.
She was driven from the court by her mother, Hazel, and declined to
say anything.
Her defence counsel, Mr Donald Findlay QC said: ''Mrs Nicol is away to
get on with the rest of her life. She is relieved it is all over.''
Asked if he was surprised at the speed at which the Crown case
collapsed he replied: ''I have long given up being surprised at anything
in the law.''
Stuart Nicol's mother Dorothy also left the court without commenting.
She was driven away by Mr Tees.

THE Herald has successfully challenged a court ban on publishing
pictures of the wife of Safeway poisoner Dr Paul Agutter. Lord Hope, the
Lord Justice General, ruled yesterday that the ban, which The Herald
challenged on a point of principle, was incompetent.
Agutter, 48, was jailed for 12 years at the High Court in Edinburgh in
February for attempting to murder his wife, Alex, at their East Lothian
home by spiking her gin and tonic with atropine, a deadly poison. He was
also convicted of placing tonic bottles laced with atropine on the
shelves of a Safeway supermarket in Edinburgh in an attempt to cover his
tracks.
At the start of the trial, Lord Morison confirmed that the media could
not publish pictures of an 11-year-old girl who had originally featured
in the attempted murder charge.
Section 169 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act prohibits
newspapers from publishing pictures of anyone under 16 concerned in
court proceedings. The judge went on to ban the media from using
pictures of Mrs Agutter, taking the view this would help protect the
identity of the girl.
Caledonian Newspapers, publishers of The Herald, argued at the Court
of Criminal Appeal that the ban on the use of Mrs Agutter's picture was
incompetent because it went further than the 1975 Act allowed.
Miss Leeona Dorrian, QC, for The Herald, made it clear there was no
intention of publishing any pictures of the 11-year-old girl but pointed
out there was a legitimate public interest in reporting court
proceedings. Any restriction on reporting was an exception to the
general rule.
Lord Hope, who heard The Herald's appeal, said the trial judge had
been trying to balance the legitimate public interest against the risk
of causing further distress to the 11-year-old child.
Lord Hope said: ''The order which the trial judge made was incompetent
to the extent that it prohibited, in absolute terms, the publication of
Mrs Agutter's photograph. The only absolute prohibition on the
publication of pictures which section 169 contains is against the
publication of a picture which is, or includes, a picture of the
child.''
The court could not impose prohibitions or conditions which increased
restrictions on reports of proceedings involving people under 16.
Mr George McKechnie, the editor of The Herald, said last night: ''I am
delighted that the Court of Criminal Appeal has concurred with our view
that Lord Morison's original order was incompetent.
''It is important that the media should be allowed to print full and
factual accounts of court cases and to use photographs as long as these
photographs do not constitute unlawful publication.
''Had the order stood it could be argued that in almost every court
case prohibition of a photograph could be ordered on the basis that it
might somehow, in some unforeseen situation, identify someone who
legally should not be indentified. This was not the purpose of Section
169 of the Act.''.

THE SNP has called on BBC Scotland to give an assurance that staff at
its Outside Broadcast unit will not be made redundant and that full
Scottish broadcasting facilities will be maintained.
Mr Paul Scott, the SNP spokesman for the arts and broadcasting, has
written to the Controller of BBC Scotland, Mr John McCormick, claiming
that there are ''alarming'' reports that more than 40 staff were to be
made redundant.
Mr Scott said there were suggestions that BBC Scotland's OB unit had
been staffed from London during the Perth and Kinross by-election.
Mr Colin Cameron, head of television at BBC Scotland, confirmed
yesterday that some staff from London were used but stressed that this
was because the Scottish OB unit staff were ''working flat out''.

TWO Labour members of Glasgow District Council are set to go on an
all-expenses paid trip to America only months before they cease to be
councillors.
The leader of the Tory group on Glasgow District Council, Mr John
Young, yesterday questioned what good the council would get out of the
trip, given that the councillors resign next April and have not been
elected to the new unitary council which takes over.
Mr John Gaffney and Mr Tony McCartney were de-selected by the Labour
Party and could not stand for the new unitary authority.
However, the council's building and properties committee voted last
week that they should attend the World Union of Wholesale Markets
biennial conference in Baltimore, USA, for four days in September.
Conference fees alone for the two councillors and one official will
cost the council about #1000, with travel and subsistence costs to be
added.
Glasgow District Council has not been affiliated to the wholesale
markets union for nearly 10 years. It pulled out because of a row over
South Africa's involvement, only rejoining when South Africa embraced
democracy.
The decision has to be ratified by the Labour group, and indeed the
full council, so the delegation may be changed.
Conservative group leader, Mr Young, said yesterday: ''I don't know
what will be learned from such a trip but if there is something to be
learned it won't be from two people who have not long to go as
councillors.''
The trip was also questioned by Militant councillor, Mr Tommy
Sheridan, who said last night: ''I'll definitely be raising questions on
this latest escapade.
''Here are two men not good enough for the Labour Party but apparently
good enough to represent the city abroad at taxpayers' expense.''
0 Mr McCartney said yesterday: ''This is going to be decided by the
council and not by me. Personally, if the council thinks it's okay then
it's okay by me.''
Mr Gaffney said: ''The committee took the decision it should be
represented at the conference by the chair, the vice-chair, and an
officer. But that's only a recommendation. The council at the end of the
day decides.''
Glasgow District Council runs Scotland's only wholesale fruit and
vegetable market and the only inland fish market, which is why it is
interested in the American trip.
Mr Gaffney has not had his problems to seek within his own Labour
branch in Maryhill, which suspended him for a year.
He also earned publicity recently for applying for a council house,
claiming he was homeless, when a newspaper pointed out he was still
living with his wife.
Mr McCartney was deselected after being fined #75 for assault.

SINN Fein president Gerry Adams last night had his first public
handshake with a British Government Minister, Mr Michael Ancram.
It was a fitting setting, an international peace and reconciliation
conference at a Belfast hotel. Mr Ancram, Northern Ireland political
development Minister, hosted the reception for the conference.
The handshake before the cameras came almost two weeks after the Sinn
Fein leader shook hands with Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew behind closed doors in Washington.
The Minister and Sinn Fein leader met in a scrum of TV cameras,
photographers, and journalists.
Mr Adams said to Mr Ancram: ''We can move forward to all-party talks,
I think it is very important. I am glad to see you. Good luck.''
Mr Ancram, who also shook hands with Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin
McGuinness, said afterwards: ''I am at a reception hosted by the British
Government and obviously I wished to shake hands when he came in.''
The three-day conference in the Europa Hotel has brought together
Government officials, former terrorists and peace negotiators from
around the world.

NATIONAL Lottery chiefs last night were embroiled in a new row over
top people's pay after a report disclosed they had received a
substantial bonus for meeting the November launch targets but had failed
to meet targets for money allocated to good causes.
Lottery operator Camelot is taking #300,000 a week in profits and the
company's five executive directors, who all earn at least #100,000 a
year, have received a 50%-of-salary bonus, with more to come, it was
disclosed yesterday.
Chief executive Mr Tim Holley has collected #120,000 on top of his
#240,000 annual salary and could pick up a similar sum later this year
if more cash targets are met. He is also in line for a 1997 bonus of
more than #330,000 -- 140% of salary. Camelot staff are getting bonuses
for good work but their payouts average only 10% -- between #2000 and
#3000.
The group's first financial performance report shows the Lottery
generated nearly #1200m by March 31, with nearly #34m coming from
scratchcards. Good causes collected #317m, #562m went in prizes, #142.9m
in Government duty, #101.7m in capital investment, #88.7m in operating
costs, and #60.7m in ticket sellers' commission.
Camelot said it would take, on average, 5% of income in operating
costs and profit over the seven years of its licence period, with 28%
going to good causes. However, the report showed the consortium has been
taking 7.5% for operating costs and 0.5% profit, with 26.6% going to
good causes. Camelot chiefs said those percentages would even out.
Virgin airline chief Richard Branson called on Camelot to give part of
its profits to struggling small charities. Mr Branson, whose bid to run
a non profit-making lottery was turned down, accused the consortium of
underplaying the Lottery's potential and said it had ''a licence to
print money''.
Camelot, however, denied the allegation and hinted there was the smell
of sour grapes about Mr Branson's attack.
National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell defended the awarding of
the contract to Camelot. In a letter to MPs to mark the Lottery's
six-month anniversary, he said claims by some medical charities that
they were being denied benefits from the Lottery were ''untrue''.
Labour heritage spokesman Mr Chris Smith said: ''It is an absolutely
astonishing arrangement. It is obviously one law for the bosses and
another for the ordinary workers. They are getting these payouts for
meeting targets they set and know they are likely to meet. And many
people will be wondering why some of this money cannot go to good
causes.''
The Liberal Democrats' heritage spokesman Mr Robert Maclennan said the
Camelot directors should rename the company Cash-a-lot: ''This grubby
dash for cash is particularly distasteful when Camelot failed to meet
its targets for money allocated to good causes.''
The SNP business spokesman Mr Fergus Ewing said: ''Never mind scratch
cards or lucky numbers, it seems that the sure-fire way of hitting the
salary jackpot in this country is to become chief executive of a private
company whose foundations have been established by taxpayers' money and
whose market position is effectively monopolistic.''
Camelot defended the bonuses, saying directors had no share options
and were not well paid in comparison with similar executives. Mr Holley
said they would have suffered heavy cash penalties had they failed to
meet deadlines.
He said the cash given to directors in no way affected the amount
going to good causes and added that the important point was that the
Lottery had raised #90m more than forecast for good causes.
