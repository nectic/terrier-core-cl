THE family of a woman who apparently contracted cancer from her husband's
asbestos-covered overalls yesterday announced legal action against Scottish
Nuclear.
Mrs Janice Hughes became ill 30 years after her first husband spent 18 months
supervising construction work at the Hunterston power station in Ayrshire.
At the time, she regularly shook out his work overalls and is thought to have
inhaled dust from white asbestos fibres, leading to mesothelioma cancer.
Mrs Hughes' first husband, Mr David Cozens, an electrical engineer, died from a
brain tumour in 1966. He came into contact with the asbestos dust while mixing
powder to form pipe lagging.
The fight for compensation is being led by her second husband, Mr John Hughes,
of Clywd in North Wales, after a coroner recorded a verdict of death from an
industrial disease.
At an inquest on Thursday, East Clwyd coroner David Jones said: ``There was a
30-year time lag before the onset of the illness but I am told by doctors this
is not unusual. I consider that it is more likely than not that the
mesothelioma was caused by exposure to asbestos.''
Mr Hughes said his wife, who was 56 when she died last November, had been
forced to leave her job as a nurse in Liverpool after contracting the illness.
His solicitors said yesterday they would be serving a writ for compensation on
Scottish Nuclear, which took over Hunterston from its former owner, the South
of Scotland Electricity Board.
Ms Lavinia Houghton, of Bullock Worthington and Jackson in Manchester, said the
coroner's verdict strengthened their case.
A Scottish Nuclear spokesman said officials were awaiting details of the
inquest and any legal claim, which would be given full consideration.
He said the company placed the highest possible emphasis on the safety of both
its staff and the public.

THE law has stepped in to investigate an alleged behind-the-scenes clash
between two of Scotland's leading ballet dancers.
According to insiders, Scottish Ballet ballerina Catarina Lappin claims she was
assaulted by male principal dancer Robert Hampton in a backstage flare-up
during a performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream in Edinburgh's Festival
Theatre last month.
The pair, both long-servers with the company, were playing the roles of the
fairy king and queen, Oberon and Titania.
Police confirmed yesterday that they were investigating a 25-year-old woman's
complaint that she was assaulted in the theatre on October 6.
A spokeswoman for Scottish Ballet said the company had not been made aware
officially of police involvement but confirmed that it had held its own
internal investigation into a complaint by Catarina Lappin about an alleged
incident involving Robert Hampton.
Refusing to disclose the outcome, she said: ``Catarina Lappin has lodged an
appeal, so it is still under investigation by the company. It is an internal
matter''
One insider said: ``From what I have heard, there was a disciplinary meeting
and both were told off and Catarina was unhappy and felt she had been dealt
with unfairly.''

A MAN has been arrested on suspicion of drugs-related offences at Eton College.
Police were called to the school on Thursday evening, where they arrested a
19-year-old man.
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police last night confirmed that the man was in
custody at Slough being questioned over drugs-related offences at the school
where Prince William is a pupil. He refused to say whether the alleged offences
involved attempts to supply drugs to pupils at the #12,400-a-year Berkshire
public school or what drugs were allegedly involved.
No-one at Eton was available for comment last night.
There has been a series of drug scandals involving Eton boys this year.
In March, four were suspended after being arrested outside a London nightclub
on suspicion of having ecstasy, amphetamines, and cannabis.
Later that month, a 17-year-old was expelled after cannabis was found in his
traditional tail-coat.
In June, a boy was expelled for possessing cannabis and six others were
arrested outside the school on suspicion of having drugs.

<HEADLINE>Labour attacks `rationing' of health care</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975323140</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE row over the future of the NHS was reignited yesterday when a leading
professor said a health authority had referred 15 patients to an NHS hospital
for fertility treatment - and then refused to pay the #10,000 bill.
The cost of in-vitro fertilisation was eventually met by a charitable trust of
which Professor Robert Winston is a trustee.
The professor of reproductive medicine at Hammersmith Hospital, west London,
said: ``That's a typical example of what is happening in some health
authorities in this country.'' It was a ``form of rationing'', he said.
At the same time, Labour claimed health care was becoming a lottery depending
on where people lived.
Professor Winston intervened during a news conference where Shadow Health
Minister Alan Milburn said one in three health authorities had started
restricting or scrapping certain treatments.
The professor said Portsmouth and South East Hampshire Health Authority
referred the fertility treatment patients to him last year.
``Once they were on the waiting list and accepted for treatment, the health
authority refused to pay the bill, and left me to pay the bill,'' he said.
Mr John Henly, director of health care purchasing for Portsmouth and South East
Hampshire Health Commission, said later he would need to examine the case.
``Our normal practice is to commit ourselves to patients admitted on a waiting
list for treatment.
``If there is a change in our policy, then any patient previously on a waiting
list for that treatment would normally be funded.
He added: ``Obviously, after that policy had been agreed, it would be expected
that no further patients would be accepted on a waiting list.''
Labour published a national map of where treatments were being ``rationed'',
and claimed 40 of the 129 health authorities in England, Wales, and Scotland
had stated that they were either not buying certain categories of care, or
limiting it.
Shadow Health Secretary Harriet Harman said that as well as treatments being
excluded from the NHS, preventive services, such as routine ultrasound tests in
pregnancy and screening for certain forms of cancer, were being excluded.
``This is the thin edge of the wedge,'' she said. ``Yesterday, it was fertility
treatment and sterilisation. Today it is varicose veins. Tomorrow it will be
hernias and hip replacements.''
The Health Department keeps no record of the treatments offered by different
authorities.
The survey published by Labour was compiled privately by Blackwell Masters, a
consultancy based in Leyburn, North Yorkshire, by pulling together the annual
purchasing plans of each authority.
Ms Harman said: ``Forty health authorities are now admitting in their
purchasing plans to restricting or excluding certain treatments.
``Ten have targeted varicose veins, 23 have targeted ear grommets, eight have
targeted screening for osteoporosis, eight have targeted fertility treatment.''
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell said the evidence did ``not remotely justify''
the charges Ms Harman was making.
``What the evidence from the health authorities which Ms Harman quotes shows
quite clearly is that health authorities are consulting clinical opinion about
which treatments reflect good value and latest clinical practice,'' he said.
``The question to Ms Harman is why she criticises health authorities for using
clinical evidence to ensure NHS resources are targeted on real need.
``Let me make the Government's commitment to the NHS clear. Health care is
available to those who need it without asking whether they can pay for it.''
He said the NHS would not undermine doctors' freedom to do what they thought
was in their patients' best interests.
Meanwhile, health service professionals in Fife yesterday expressed concern and
surprise that the region had been ``wrongly singled out'' in the Labour Party
study.
Fife Health Board, which is responsible for a population of 350,000, was the
only one of 15 Scottish health authorities listed among 40 in Britain which
Labour said had begun the explicit rationing of NHS treatments.
Fife was claimed to be limiting the number of ear operations it carries out.
Fife Health Board denied that it was limiting services. Ms Pat Frost, the
board's general manager, said yesterday: ``This report is simply not correct.
Grommets (ear operations) have not been, and never will be, excluded in Fife.''
Dr Eric Baijal, Fife's acting director of public health, said: ``Fifers can be
assured that no treatment is excluded from the range of services purchased on
their behalf.''

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975323141</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WOMAN told a court yesterday that a friend of her former lover had thrown a
horse's severed ear at her.
Mrs Anne McConnell, 33, said the ear came from her thoroughbred mare called
Fallon.
She told Glasgow Sheriff Court she had driven with her three-year-old son to a
small-holding owned by Mr Frank Carberry, 33, after she had received a
telephone call telling her the horse was dead.
She believed she was to collect a vet's death certificate but as she arrived at
Carberry's driveway, Mr Carberry had walked towards her carrying a polythene
bag.
``He said `Here's your f******g documentation', put his hand in the bag, took
something out and threw it at me,'' Mrs McConnell told the court.
Mrs McConnell claimed Mr Carberry then told her: ``You'll get the rest of the
horse through the post.''
She said she picked up the ear and had wanted to throw it back at Mr Carberry.
But as she raised it above her head her friend, Ms Carol Tracy, had grabbed her
arm and prevented her.
Mrs McConnell told the court that she took the ear to the police and was so
upset it was two hours before she could compose herself enough to give them a
statement.
She claimed that in the police station she received a call on her mobile from
Mr Carberry who told her to check all her other horses' ears.
Mr Carberry, of The Holdings, Wester Boghead Road, Lenzie, denies maliciously
damaging a horse last June by removing its ear, assaulting Mrs McConnell by
throwing an ear at her, and committing a breach of the peace.
Mrs McConnell said that Mr Carberry was a friend of her ex-boyfriend Mr Charles
Swan who had a farm outside Kilsyth.
She worked for her friend Ms Carol Tracy who ran a horse trekking business from
Mr Swan's farm.
They quit the business because the rent had increased and there was a legal
dispute over a debt.
Nine of the 10 horses were moved out of the farm despite a court order and Mrs
McConnell admitted she was brought before a sheriff for contempt of court but
admonished.
Fallon, however, remained at the farm and the next time she saw her she was
lying dead in a field near Cumbernauld with her ears removed.
Defence lawyer David Hunter suggested to Mrs McConnell that the incident never
happened, a claim she denied. She also denied that she owed Mr Carberry money
for horse feed.
Ms Tracy told the court : ``Fallon was my father's horse and I was very
attached to her, but Anne was more attached because she looked after her.''
The trial continues.

<TEXT>
PERMISSION for a hospital to withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a man who
has been in a persistent vegetative state since suffering brain damage during a
dental operation was given by a High Court judge yesterday.
The 27-year-old man, known for legal reasons only as C, has been in the same
state since his heart stopped while his wisdom teeth were being removed under
general anaesthetic in February 1991.
Mr Justice Johnson said he was sure that C had no glimmer of awareness and that
his interests required the court to make the order withdrawing the
administration of nutrients and hydration by artificial means.
He also ordered medical staff to ensure that the man suffered the least
distress and maintained the greatest dignity until such time as his life might
come to an end.
The application was brought by the local NHS Trust at the initiative of the
man's parents.
The judge made an order preventing the publication of anything which would
identify the man, his family or the hospital caring for him.
A consultant at the hospital, who also cannot be named, said the man's
condition was very severe indeed and there was no prospect of any improvement.
If the present ``exemplary'' standard of medical care was maintained, he might
live for a further 30 years.
The judge said that, every day, C was turned, lifted, and strapped into a
wheelchair. He showed no recognition of those around him and there was nothing
to indicate he could see. His body would jerk in response to loud sound. He was
mute, although he could cough, choke, and sometimes sneeze quite violently. On
occasions, he would vomit.
The man made no voluntary movement of his limbs, which were stiff, and his
facial expression had at times exhibited distress or anguish.
The judge said the decision was supported by the hospital, the doctors, and by
the Official Solicitor, who has been appointed by the court to represent C's
interests.
The judge said C's parents had explained that he had always been a private and
gentle person whose biggest fear was losing control.
They felt he would not have been able to bear being in his present state and
that he would want to die if he was able to make the decision.
They explained that they had put him first in reaching their conclusion in
February 1994. The judge said that C's family and the staff caring for him
would need professional counselling and it would be made available to them.
q SCOTLAND'S first ``right to die'' case is due to be heard later this month at
the Court of Session. Mrs Janet Johnston has been in a persistent vegetative
state at Law Hospital, Carluke, for more than three years and is being kept
alive by artificial feeding.
The hospital trust, with the support of Mrs Johnston's husband and daughter, is
petitioning the court to be allowed to withdraw feeding. The hearing has been
set down for November 29.

LABOUR's deputy leader, Mr John Prescott, last night lodged a formal complaint
with Parliament's new sleaze-finder general, Sir Gordon Downey, over the
conduct of Tory MP Patrick Nicholls.
Mr Nicholls, MP for Teignbridge, in Devon, who is a former Minister, is alleged
to have offered to use his influence in Whitehall to act for a private company
in return for shares.
The allegations were made last weekend. Mr Nicholls has consistently claimed he
had acted absolutely in accordance with the rules governing Members' interests.
Mr Prescott said at the time that any ``shares for influence'' deal was just as
bad as the ``cash for questions'' row which led to the Nolan inquiry into
standards in public life.
Last night, Mr Prescott said: ``I have today formally submitted a complaint to
Sir Gordon Downey, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, about the conduct
of Patrick Nicholls and forwarded all the evidence we have received.
``I believe Mr Nicholls has breached the rules of the House and I remain
concerned about this matter.''
Mr Nicholls was reported to have agreed to take a 5% shareholding in a water
equipment firm in return for trying to persuade the Government to buy its
products.

<HEADLINE>Couple fail in bank battle Judge's ruling could spell ruin for pair who claim Barclays wrecked their business</HEADLINE>

THE latest high-profile legal battle between consumers and the banks ended in
disaster yesterday for a couple who claimed their businesses were wrecked when
Barclays Bank called in their overdraft.
Nigel Green and Yvonne Challis could face ruin after their compensation bid
failed, leaving them to pick up a bill of #350,000 for taking on one of
Britain's biggest High Street banks.
The pair started the legal fight when a replacement manager at their branch saw
they had a huge business overdraft and immediately called in the debt.
However, a judge at the High Court in Cardiff yesterday rejected their
compensation claim and ordered them to pay a total of #311,000 in overdraft,
loans, and interest. They were also told to pay the costs of the hearing,
estimated at #30,000.
Banking pressure groups last night said the defeat would not derail their
campaign for laws to regulate the banking industry more tightly.
Mr Green, 42, and 41-year-old Miss Challis, of Clymelyn Farm, Llanllwni, Dyfed,
had sought #1m in compensation, claiming that their riding school and haulage
businesses were wrecked by the bank's decision to demand repayment.
However, Judge Michael Gibbon ruled that the bank was entitled to call in its
overdrafts.
``They took the view that further funding of the business would be throwing
good money after bad,'' he said, ruling that Mr Green should pay #207,000 and
Miss Challis #104,000, with both sums including interest.
The couple, who moved to the tiny village in West Wales from Kent, said: ``Our
dreams are wrecked.''
Mr Green added: ``We are completely gutted. We had complete and utter trust in
the bank manager, we feel badly let down.
``We knew we were tackling a giant when we took on the bank but we felt
confident in the justice of our case.''
However, they said they had issued writs against Barclays claiming they were
given bad advice by the bank manager.
A Barclays spokesman said: ``We are pleased with the judgment but regret we had
to bring the case at all.
``Legal action followed a number of attempts over the past three years by the
bank to resolve the dispute and recover the outstanding sums.''
The High Court ruling came as Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley intervened
on behalf of two constituents whose Legal Aid was withdrawn just two working
days before their court battle to save their home from repossession by Lloyds
Bank.
Mrs Bottomley wrote to the Legal Aid Board after it withdrew the certificate on
Wednesday because Mrs Yvonne Wright, who is fighting the case with her husband
Bill, had turned 60 and was entitled to a pension.
Mrs Wright, of Dockenfield, near Farnham, Surrey, is still waiting to hear if
she will have Legal Aid when she appears in court on Monday after Mrs Bottomley
wrote to Legal Aid Board chief executive Stephen Orchard asking him to
``carefully re-examine the case''.
The Legal Aid Board said it it was unable to comment.
The case involves a joint venture property partnership which the Wrights
entered into with another couple, who are Lloyds Bank customers and who
allegedly gave a legal charge over the property to cover their personal debts.
Both cases follow a string of other bitter fights between the banks and their
customers.
q In September, Ms Julia Verity, 55, and Mr Richard Spindler, 36, were awarded
#77,500 by a court in a landmark legal victory after their Lloyds branch
manager was found to have given them bad advice.
q Last week, there was outrage when NatWest Bank charged businessman Colin
Crosby, of Dewsberry, Oxfordshire, #8000 for a #2000 overdraft. The bank agreed
to repay the #8000 after admitting ``not following procedures''.
q Earlier this month, banking watchdog Audit UK said that, out of 4000 cases it
had investigated in four years, around 82% had been overcharged.
Last night, Ms Pat Griffiths of the independent Banking Action Group, called
for the Government to clear up the law.
``I think there have been big changes in the last three years and I think
people are fighting back hence we are seeing all these court cases.
``There used to be huge trust for the bank managers, who were regarded like
doctors, but it has now been exposed that the banks are not acting in a
professional way towards their customers.
``It seems the Government is allowing this to go on,'' she said.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce,
said banks were providing an ``increasingly good service'' and said managers
should not be prevented from being able to call in loans.
However, commenting on yesterday's case, he added: ``We deplore any lender who
does not exercise discretion and acts with intemperate expedience without
offering alternative solutions.''

A SHERIFF Court is set to move 20 miles to catch up with a backlog of trials.
However, the proposal to cram in almost 300 trials due at Linlithgow Sheriff
Court into nine days at Edinburgh Sheriff Court has been criticised by the
Lothian and Borders branch of the Scottish Police Federation.
The federation fears with so many police witnesses having to move out of West
Lothian in March and April there will be a lack of police cover during that
period.
Spokesman Norman Macleod said yesterday: ``No matter how carefully they try to
reduce the number of police witnesses, they will still have a minimum two
officers per trial and they plan to hold 40 trials a day.
``That's 80 officers off the streets and cover will have to be maintained. The
only way is for the force to bring in other officers on overtime and the bill
for that could be substantial.''
The reason for the backlog of trials at Linlithgow has been blamed on a lack of
accommodation at the court and a series of long trials.
The Scottish Office says trials should be dealt with no later than 12 weeks
from the date they are fixed. However, at Linlithgow it has taken 30 weeks for
some trials to come to court.
Linlithgow's difficulties were highlighted when Rangers goalkeeper Andy Goram
was told he would have to wait until July for trial on a drink-driving charge.
Mr Goram is just one of 1044 people awaiting trial at the court, with more than
two-thirds waiting more than three months.
The Sheriff Courts Administration Service proposes to use five courts in
Edinburgh for six days in March, with a target of clearing eight trials a day -
to dispose of 240 trials. Another 72 trials are expected to be heard over three
days set aside in April.
Linlithgow Sheriff Clerk, Mr Roy Sinclair, said: ``If we succeed, then we
should make a considerable dent in our backlog, which has occurred for a number
of reasons. But the main problem is the lack of space here at Linlithgow. We
just can't keep up with the number of cases coming in here.
``We will continue as normal at Linlithgow while the trials are cleared at
Edinburgh. It is not in the interests of justice for this situation to carry
on.''
Lothian and Borders Sheriff Principal Gordon Nicholson said: ``It is not an
unusual problem for courts to have a build-up of cases. But in other areas
there is the facility to convene extra courts in the same building to catch up.
``We don't have the accommodation in Linlithgow and hence our plan to involve
Edinburgh in the process. But we recognise there will be disadvantages to
police and the public. We are attempting to minimise that inconvenience and a
number of agencies are working closely together to try and ensure this exercise
will be successful.
``There may still be problems for the police in maintaining cover, but we have
their fullest co-operation.''
In the longer term, the Sheriff Courts Administration Service is negotiating
with West Lothian District Council to lease part of its Livingston headquarters
for use as a permanent Court annexe to Linlithgow.
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Constabulary said yesterday: ``It will
certainly have an effect on us but, overall, the merit to the justice system is
worth the disruption. We will have to look at our resources but it will not
mean that West Lothian won't be policed.''

<TEXT>
THE top-secret 4500-acre firing range at Dundrennan, near Kirkcudbright, is set
to become an infantry training range, with up to 40 jobs for civilians.
The Ministry of Defence will spend up to #9m building barracks and improving
the ranges for some of the 12 battalions of 500 men each that will use the
facilities during six months in the summer.
In the winter, it is planned to use the range, overlooking the Solway Firth,
for training infantry recruits from Catterick.
An official announcement is expected before Christmas by the Government but at
a top-level meeting at the range yesterday, Mr James Arbuthnot, Minister for
Defence Procurement, and the Army's top Land Command officer said they were
highly optimistic about its future.
They were talking to councillors, management, staff, and union representatives
at the range, which is due to close by the end of 1997 with the loss of all 120
jobs, 30 of whom have already gone.
For 13 years, depleted uranium shells were developed and tested at Dundrennan
before being used for the first time in the Gulf war. Despite repeated
attempts, none of the shells has been recovered from the Solway.
Mr Arbuthnot said it was expected that 40 civilians would be required, once a
final decision had been made, as well as a large number of troops coming into
the area and spending their money there.
Colonel Finlay Maclean, from HQ Land Command, Salisbury, who is in charge of
the Army's ranges, said he was delighted with Dundrennan.
He said that 78% of the 120,000-strong British Army was now based at home,
compared with 49% of a 150,000-strong army before the end of the Cold War, and
they needed more ranges, with Kirkcudbright being ideal.
He added: ``I expect an announcement in the next couple of weeks. The people
are keen on it and there is no opposition here.''
The news of the possible 40 jobs was welcomed by councillors and workers and Mr
John Morris, a Stewartry District councillor from Kirkcudbright, said it looked
as if the future of the range was assured for many years to come.
``The 40 jobs will be welcome and we would have liked more, but in these
economic times it isn't possible,'' he added.
Mr Denis McGarrie, the Transport and General Workers' Union representative,
said the workers would be able to apply for the jobs which would not be
skilled, when the Army took over.

THE presence on the Scottish music scene of Chinese composer Tan Dun, who made
his official debut on Thursday night as associate composer/ conductor of the
BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, in one of their Cutting Edge series of
concerts, has several implications.
First, Tan's extraordinary mix - an authentic and original blend - of cultures
adds a new dimension to Scotland's music. In its own way, his music is radical.
There's nothing original in a composer creating a collaboration between ethnic
and modern idioms - they've been at it for years.
But Tan Dun's two Orchestral Theatre works - the second receiving its UK
premiere on Thursday - are something else: they are a homogeneous mix of the
ancient and the avant garde, of West and East, in an integrated unit.
The other implication is that we're going to have to find some way of
describing this astonishing music. Orchestral Theatre II is pure performance
art. Two conductors - Tan and Jerzy Maksymiuk - directed the SSO, whose
woodwinds were stationed around and above the audience, and the audience itself
(which joined full-throatedly in the chanting) in an amazing performance of
what was nothing less than ritual art.
Written entirely on one note, with the conductors themselves involved in
shouting, chanting, miming in silence (God knows what the Radio 3 listeners
made of that), with a staggering range of orchestral sounds embracing haunting
woodwind, baying brass and a terrifying crescendo on basses that was like a
fleet of approaching bombers, and bass Stephen Richardson intoning and yelling
like a demented Tibetan monk, the whole thing was awesome in its primal effect.
Jerzy Maksymiuk conducted the rest of the superb programme, including
high-energy performances of Messiaen's Oiseaux Exotiques (with pianist Rolf
Hind) and Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements.

She began as little more than a twinkle in Woody Allen's eye and her image is
manufactured from very little. Even the star herself admits to that. So why,
asks Jane Scott , is Sharon Stone such a highly-marketable phenomenon?
THERE are perhaps four things you should know about Sharon Stone before
dismissing her as a Hollywood publicity monster who shows rather too much skin
to be taken seriously.
The first is that in 1980, director Woody Allen cast her as his fantasy woman
in his black and white film Stardust Memories - her movie debut. It makes one
snigger now, but: ``I looked at her and thought I would really like her to kiss
me!'' he is reported as saying.
Stone protested when they put her in a ``bombshell dress'' for the brief clip,
where she kisses him.
``I said: `Wait. Let me explain something - I'm not a bombshell.' They didn't
see it my way. I played Woody's fantasy. And that was the beginning of the
end.''
Ten years later she posed nude for Playboy, proving that at 32 and with a
decade of truly awful potboilers behind her there was not so much a serious
actress waiting to get out as a woman determined to get noticed.
A year later she uncrossed her legs in Basic Instinct; the Sharon Stone package
was revealed, heralding the writhing skin scenes so familiar to those of us who
have yawned our way through the ludicrous plots and moderate box office success
of The Specialist and Sliver.
And in the last two years, it has paid off; more important than taking the
leading role in The Quick and the Dead, last year's female shoot-em-up cowboy
movie, she was the co-producer and chose the director.
This year she finished shooting Casino, playing mobster Robert de Niro's
unfaithful wife. Martin Scorsese, the director's director, chose her for the
role, which is perhaps the only really important thing you need to know about
Sharon Stone at all; as part of Hollywood's elite, she is all future, and the
past doesn't figure at all.
Not that the past necessarily bothers her. She is variously reported as saying
in Basic Ambition, a new biography by journalist Douglas Thompson out this
month:
On the 10-page Playboy spread: ``One, I wanted to be seen. Leading ladies my
age are typed and you need to be sexually appealing for parts in the movies you
might be right for. It's a man's world and when you look like I look, that's
what it is.''
On Basic Instinct: ``Once I realised that was what the guys wanted, I thought:
`Oh, I get it. No matter how he touches her or where he touches her or what
else he does to her, it`s the most, it's the best, it's the sexiest'.''
On Sharon Stone: ``My image is manufactured from very little . . . I realised I
could create an event - this more attractive woman.'' She has maintained she
was ``betrayed'' on the Basic Instinct interrogation scene by director Paul
Verhoeven, who told her to take off her white knickers because they were
reflecting the light, assuring her the shadows were too dark to show anything
very significant. She has subsequently vetted all nude scenes before release.
And Stone and her fans drearily insist that the part of sex killer Catherine
Tramell in Basic Instinct changed Hollywood values for good. This, remember, is
the movie that gave us perhaps the most offensive line in film history: ``I
think she's the f*** of the century.''
``So many female characters are written the way men experience women or would
like to experience women. But that's not the way women really are . . . I think
Basic Instinct showed both men and women in the trenches pitted against one
another,'' says Stone. It is true that Tramell more than matched Michael
Douglas's testosterone-stuffed detective Nick Curran, unlike the sad obsessive
played by Glenn Close in his previous rip-em-off movie Fatal Attraction, but
Stone claims too much here; what is ``the f*** of the century'' but Woody
Allen's dream girl made flesh?
Stone's movies have almost all been written, directed and produced by men, and
until The Quick and the Dead (with the possible exception of Sliver) she has
never carried the film; her role was the main character's love interest.
So forget about the films, which ain't going to change anything; concentrate on
what she does with her stardom.
Vicki Patterson, assistant education officer at the Edinburgh Filmhouse, says:
``She is a phenomenon, and she is interesting; she has created controversy, and
she is determined - I admire her for getting in a position where she
co-financed The Quick and the Dead; it is unusual, especially for women, who
are constantly fighting among themselves for a decreasing number of parts. It
takes guts to put one's reputation on the line.''
Thompson's biography has the precocious Stone telling schoolfriends in rural
Pennsylvania that she would be the new Marilyn Monroe. She escaped home via
modelling, and then to Hollywood, where she appeared in slasher flicks (Deadly
Blessing), creaking adventure pictures (King Solomon's Mines, Allan Quartermain
and the Lost City of Gold), and the execrable Police Academy 4 before losing a
truly career-sapping bad perm and hitting the big time as Arnold
Schwarzenegger's wife in Total Recall in 1990.
The recurring word in interviews is control. On the way she has ditched a
husband and a long-term lover - both film producers - at least two agents, had
a Hello! at home shoot (which caused controversy when it was divulged she had
borrowed someone else's home to do it with), gained a lover 10 years younger
than herself and, most recently, been awarded France's highest mark of esteem
in the arts - the Chevalier of Arts.
Patterson says: ``If Casino goes well that will improve her record at the box
office and guarantee her work in the future.
``Hopefully, she is going to continue to get involved in production. It will
mean more roles for women and better roles and hopefully they can perhaps
champion directors of their choice, maybe directors who are a lot more
sympathetic to female roles.
``I think we should take her seriously, and the French obviously do. Maybe
we're missing something.''

AGAINST all odds, and at great personal risk, young - puerile-sounding anyway -
intrepid Ed Marriot, hearing of a lost tribe in a hugely inaccessible part of
Papua New Guinea, decides to go meet the Liawep people who live on the mountain
they worship as their god.
Nobody wants to help him and anthropologists try to dissuade him, gently at
first and then they come clean and suggest that he is nuts and liable to be
eaten. But does he listen? Not Ed. I must come clean myself here because when I
started listening to Our Father the Mountain (R4) I stopped the tape and gave
myself a little talking to. It went like this.
``Critic, put aside your prejudices about that voice. Remember that your
dislike of that kind of voice - no, that character-voice - has been recently
activated by last night's viewing of Four Weddings and a Funeral. Just because
he sounds like Hugh Grant in the jungle (I mean, of course, the Grant persona,
all terribly gosh and upper-class tic) does not mean the result of Ed's awfully
big adventure will be risible, deeply patronising and rather sick. You don't
yet know if it will be Numpty gets Pretty Scared in Bongo Land.'' So I deleted
my bias and rewound.
First of all we had to hear about the drugs and jags he needed to make his
actually illegal journey into primitivism. He is warned about the fatal bite of
some bug or snake (I'm sorry, I was laughing a bit here but it was one or the
other) he might encounter. A female bite of the species would be fatal, so he
asks how he is meant to tell the difference. Things were getting complicated
for Ed and he hadn't even reached the mountain yet.
With his guide Dunstan, Ed reaches the tribe, some of whom immediately scatter
into the nearest bit of denser jungle. Ed notes and ponders this. Things get
worse, and with an analytic grasp of the situation he says it's ``because I'm
basically here, isn't it?''
Yes, I murmured, yes! And as if he had heard me, Ed went on to describe how
suggestions had been made that there might be something colonialist and dubious
about going into a place he had no idea about, with no ideas whatsoever. The
head of the tribe was called Herod and not unsurprisingly, given his name, was
pretty het up about Christianity, de-manding that Ed profess his faith. Well,
he did this pretty reluctantly, he admitted, but you see, he didn't want to
offend, did he?
Herod was getting pretty hostile by this time but I suppose, not having seen
Four Weddings, he probably didn't get the joke. In the middle of this
tragi-comic nightmare, with lots of noise in the background, our reporter
whispers to Dunstan: ``Would it help if I came round to say hello?'' No, I
shouted, but this time he did not seem to hear me because things, astoundingly
in the face of his anthropological sensitivity, got worse.
The mountain got angry, Herod threw a fit, and four children died. Dunstan
rushed into Ed's room suggesting they better get out of there fast. Very fast,
so fast, in fact, that Ed fascinatingly cogitated on the fact that it had taken
them five days to get there, but only three days to get back.
Then once he had got his breath back, and explaining to us that it would have
been inopportune to hang around talking to his little machine in the middle of
the mayhem, Ed finished off his extraordinary contribution to global knowledge
by telling a little garbled nugget which involved 7th Day Adventists and gold
consortiums.
There is certainly a story to be told there, but next time I know exactly who
the producer should send. It came to me while listening to Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes (R4). Lorelei was given a diary; she was confused at first, because it
was a book without words, but once she grasped the diary concept, she warmed to
the idea - although she wondered, given that she thought all the time, how many
books she would need.
I still think that if Radio 4 had given her a cute little recording machine,
like they had given to Ed, she would have produced a better programme, and hit
it off with Herod.

THE inevitable was confirmed last night when the Post Office accepted a bid
from Glasgow Development Agency for its premises in the city's George Square.
It is understood the GDA, acting on behalf of trustees who want the building
for a National Gallery of Scottish Art and Design, paid #3m, which is reputedly
half the figure offered by an Aberdeen-based property developer.
Under the deal, the National Galleries of Scotland now has a 12-month option on
the premises.
Mr Kenneth Graham, chairman of the Scottish Post Office Board, denied that the
goalposts were changed to favour any bidder during the controversial sale
process.
Glasgow District Council leader Pat Lally, who supports the gallery plan, also
dismissed suggestions that the PO was pushed into accepting a lower tender.
``I do not accept that,'' he said, arguing that it was probable too many
conditions had been attached to any other offers.
He said: ``If the Post Office wanted to realise the asset at an early date,
then clearly the best bid was that which offered a speedy return. It is better
to have money in the hand than not at all.''
The PO 11th-hour decision to seek fresh bids last month led commercial
developer Jarlaw to call on the Scottish Office to intervene.
It had offered #4.5m, compared with the GDA's #3m, but the PO not only rejected
the bid, but announced new stipulations. These reduced retail and office floor
space by 20,000sq ft, slashing the commercial value, and included the
successful bidder having to provide a philatelic museum.
Jarlaw said then it would consider legal action against the Post Office,
arguing it treated unfairly.
Mr Graham, announcing the winner in Edinburgh, said the idea of a collaborative
venture was raised by the National Galleries' trustees during the evaluation
process, and went on: ``We decided to be even-handed to enable all interested
parties to develop their propositions.
``The best way forward was to give the opportunity to bidders to re-tender. The
goalposts were changed similarly for everybody.''
He insisted there was no pressure brought to bear by politicians in Glasgow,
adding: ``We would not accept any pressure and there is no way we would
tolerate bullying from anybody.''
Mr Graham declined to say how many bids were received, or give any details
about them.
The key issue had been the attractiveness of the GDA proposal. The Post Office
was not in the business of providing art galleries, and it had offered the
building for sale on commercial criteria.
``We have operated to those commerical criteria,'' said Mr Graham, who said
considerable thought was given to all bids. ``There is no doubt whatsoever in
our minds that the GDA's bid offered the best commercial package.''
Councillor Lally denied the PO had little choice but to accept a lower bid
because of fears that Jarlaw would not receive planning permission from Glasgow
District for its mainly retail and office development.
He said the firm, if it had won, would have been treated fairly by the local
authority, and been subjected only to planning regulations.
Councillor Lally said he was ``absolutely confident'' that the galleries will
be open in time for Glasgow's reign as City of Architecture and Design in 1999.
It is understood only two bids were received, with a second commercial
developer having dropped out after considering a bid of at least #5m.
GDA chief executive Stuart Gulliver said the decision was ``excellent news for
Glasgow and for Scotland''.
The PO, with a long tradition of supporting the arts, had taken an enlightened
and publicly-responsible view in respect of the sale of an important listed
building.
Mr Gulliver added the decision showed the PO recognised the importance for
Scotland of the creation of a national gallery, which would have a major impact
on the economy.
It is expected to attract 850,000 visitors a year, plough #17m into the
economy, and create up to 400 jobs.
Mr Angus Grossart, chairman of the Trustees of the National Galleries of
Scotland, said the decision was ``a significant step towards creating a
National Gallery in Glasgow by the new millenium.''
The GDA, to allow the proposals to proceed, has offered the building to the
trustees on a 12-month option.
Mr Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, conceded
that the project was still a long way from completion, but added: ``Securing
the preferred building is a major step forward.''
Directors of Jarlaw were unavailable for comment last night. In their protest
to Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch, it was argued the original sale
process had been ``in a manner not normally associated with the disposal of
surplus Government property''.
The PO said the agreement will allow the transfer of most of its #500m
philatelic collection and museum of postal history from cramped conditions in
London to Glasgow.

AN investment of #160m which will create 235 jobs over four years was announced
yesterday by Shin-Etsu Handotai Europe Ltd when it signalled the start of the
third phase of its factory at Livingston, West Lothian.
The company, the world's largest producer of semi-conductor silicon wafers,
arrived at Livingston in 1984 and employs 300 people. The new project will
bring the total workforce to 540. The additional jobs will be mainly for
process operators, technicians, and engineers.
The new project involves the construction of a 14,000sq m plant next to the
present plant.
The European semi-conductor market had grown dramatically, not only because of
the computer business but also due to a great upsurge in telecommunications and
automotive applications.
Mr George Kynoch, Scottish Industry Minister, said Shin-Etsu's announcement
came at the end of what was possibly the best week so far for good news in the
Scottish electronics industry.
After the announcements on Monday at Motorola in East Kilbride and the Chunghwa
announcement in Glasgow on Tuesday, it showed how, not bad news, but good news
came in threes, reversing old folk beliefs.
He said: ``More and more, our businesses are committing themselves to training
and to re-investment and this in turn creates an improved business confidence,
and re-affirms the correctness of choosing Scotland as a business location.'

THE Prime Minister will attempt to relaunch the Ulster peace process this
weekend.
He will present fresh proposals to Irish Prime Minister John Bruton aimed at
breaking the deadlock over IRA arms decommissioning.
Mr Major will speak to Mr Bruton next week and hopes to set a date for a
UK-Irish summit, to replace the one that was abruptly cancelled by Mr Bruton
two months ago.
Britain proposes to revive the ``twin-track'' approach, which would see the
appointment of an international commission to examine the weapons issue, while
allowing preparatory talks with the Ulster parties in advance of all-party
talks.
The same proposals were on the table for the September summit, but the Irish
Government declined to participate after Sinn Fein warned the plan would be
unacceptable. The Republicans reject the British demand that the IRA give up
weapons before all-party talks can begin.
Mr Major said yesterday: ``I will put these proposals to Mr Bruton. We will
then look for an early summit date.'' He reiterated his insistence that Sinn
Fein would have to compromise on weapons.
``Sinn Fein have been taking a very hard line on negotiations for some time.
What Sinn Fein have been saying about seeking peace I very much hope they mean,
but they still have a long way to go,'' he said.
``I hope we will be able to get Sinn Fein into talks with the other parties.
That has been the intention from the beginning. But Sinn Fein have to accept
that they have to make concessions.
``It is not possible to enter into negotiations with a private army at your
back. They must realise that that isn't the way to get into democratic
politics.''
Downing Street emphasised that Sinn Fein should not be allowed to have a veto
over the peace process. Britain's proposals, a Government source said, were
``extremely reasonable''.
However, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams warned that the process could collapse
through British refusal to allow all-party talks, and that the conflict could
``re-occur'' after 15 months of uninterrupted ceasefire.
``I think it is patently clear that the British succeeded in making the peace
process a high-wire act. That high-wire is now stretched like elastic,'' he
said.
The Government was last night under pressure to quicken the pace of prisoner
releases in Northern Ireland. Loyalist prisoner pressure groups warned that
there would be no political settlement until all the jailed paramilitaries were
out.
Eighty men and three women at the top security Maze and two other jails were
yesterday freed early under a revised 50% remission scheme introduced to try to
develop the peace process.
John Heaney, from Armagh, who served six-and-a-half years for a terrorist
offence, was the first to walk out. He embraced his wife and young daughter but
would not comment.
Outside the gates, banner-waving relatives and friends of opposing factions
stood only yards apart to cheer and hug prisoners as they walked free.
The 200 lifers do not qualify. Around 850 men and women with paramilitary links
are still in prison.
The Irish Government welcomed the releases, but the Democratic Unionist leader,
Dr Ian Paisley, claimed it was a move by the Government to keep the IRA and
loyalist ceasefires in place.
He told a meeting in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh: ``They have embarked upon a
policy of the most cunning evil to deprive the people of Northern Ireland of
their British rights, heritage, and way of life.''
q A man who was beaten and abducted by an armed gang said yesterday that he was
roped to a tree for 24 hours and questioned repeatedly. John Hegarty, 19, from
Strabane, County Tyrone, said he escaped after struggling free from his bonds.
It is believed the Provisionals wanted to know if he had any part in an armed
raid at a church community centre when #17,000 in Christmas savings was stolen
at the end of last month.

IT'S difficult to imagine Diana Moran as old. She of the famous green leotard,
flawless complexion and ever-youthful charm becoming stooped, wrinkled and
doddery. Well that's what old ladies are like isn't it?
Happily, Moran is still in her prime, but by current standards at 56 years old
she is positively geriatric to be a model fronting an international campaign
for a beauty product.
Having survived breast cancer and a double mastectomy and endured depression
after her new husband left her for a younger woman, she's come out on top.
Despite her trials, in a way she's lucky. Lucky to have been born when she was,
one of the first baby boomers, a generation now in their 40s and 50s.
Growing up in a time of unprecedented economic growth, those baby boomers
became the first real teenagers, the rebels who invented rock'n'roll and later
thrilled at the outrage their short skirts, long hair and free love caused
their parents.
Those first teenagers are now middle-aged and because of their sheer numbers
and relative affluence, they represent a vital market for consumer products and
services.
``The choice of a woman in her fifties to sell a beauty product is
ground-breaking,'' says Moran. Television viewers see a radiant woman of a
certain age explaining how Ulay's Pro-vital keeps her skin fresh and vibrant -
not young-looking - and yes, there are visible lines ascending from her lips
and a soft-focus camera lens does not try to hide them.
A survey of 50-plus women for the cosmetics industry revealed that mature women
are fed up of seeing images of flawless youth selling consumer products for
mature women. They want models of their own age portraying mature beauty.
``It's a massive international campaign and the reaction of women on the street
everywhere has been tremendous,'' says Moran, brimming with delight at her good
luck.
Moran is up there in the vanguard along with Catherine Deneuve and Lauren
Hutton, creating role models of mature beauty to assure that vast middle-aged
market that you don't have to be young to be desirable.
Mike Hepworth knows nothing of face creams. As a leading expert in the field of
ageing and sociologist at the University of Aberdeen, he knows about the
demographics and economics of the world's ageing population. ``These new
mid-lifers are not going to grow old in the way their parents did. They have a
more vigorous attitude towards ageing, they have more resources and higher
expectations and they won't be content to sit back and grow old gracefully and
disengage from society.
``What's happening now is there are fewer younger people and generally they
have less money to spend and the balance of consumer power is shifting.
Increasingly, people who make consumer products and provide services see the
middle-aged as an important group to target. In fact, it's now argued in the US
that unless firms target that middle-aged market, they won't survive.''
All very well for the Jollies (Jetset Oldies with Lots of Loot) in this brave
new world, but what about the rest, grimly brave at the prospect of growing old
in the youth culture they created. Those in work are warily looking over their
shoulders at ``wunderkind'' ready to jump into their jobs at the next round of
redundancies. Those sixties rebels who bandied the slogan ``Never trust anyone
over 30'' are now haunted by the spectre of ageism.
Always difficult to prove, ageism today is rife. A survey by Gallup for the
Brook Street Bureau found that up to 90% of employers discriminate against the
over-35s. The Carnegie Trust, which researches into aspects of ageing, says
employer prejudice is holding back Britain's economic recovery. Mike Hepworth
cautions: ``If the prime market for consumer goods and services becomes too
insecure to spend, recovery could be a long time coming.
``Because of the way the population is changing, we need older people as a
resource more than ever before, but we haven't got rid of the age prejudice
that comes out of this youth culture.
``Age prejudice is based on a belief that as people get older they lose the
ability to perform tasks; they become less flexible; they can't learn new
things. All this is a myth deeply embedded in society, especially in a time of
rapid technological change. Research shows over and over again that older
people are perfectly capable of adapting and learning throughout the entire
life course.''
Some far-sighted companies, seeing the future shortfall in potential employees
and the advantages in available labour, have adopted policies of employing
older people, and not just to stack shelves. B&amp;Q's chairman, Jim Hodkinson,
himself now 51, has recently extended his company's policy of hiring over-50s
to retail management.
While we wait to see what happens at the sharp end of the generation
battlefield, Moran, now a female icon for that not-so-wrinkly baby-boomer
generation is defiant.
``Ageing is more a problem for the young than the middle-aged. It's youth's
perception of old age that's all wrong. They see only the things that we appear
to be losing. They think that 60 is way over-the-hill and that we are flabby
wrinklies who are losing our memories, our energy and even our interest in sex.
``In three and a half years I'll be 60 and I can assure you that I will not be
written off. For my generation, so long as we keep our health and fitness and
we have some disposable income, the world is still there for us. We have more
time for ourselves to do at last the things we really want to do. And those
youngsters don't know about the surge of energy a woman gets after 50.
``Another hidden bonus that maturity brings is a new-found confidence. The
older you are, the stronger you become. It's a wonderful time of life. We must
change the pathetic image to match the reality.''
Can't you just imagine what she might have been like in the sixties? Afghan
coat and jockey cap waving a placard and railing against social injustice, the
bomb, the war or out-dated values of an old-fashioned, fuddy-duddy regime?
Today Moran is a defiant spokesperson for Age Power, a soon-to-be-launched
national network of clubs for anyone over 49.
``There'll be no upper age limit, and mature people will come together to learn
about health, fitness, finance, the arts, computers, everything we need to keep
in touch and buzzing and bring more quality to our lives after 49,'' Moran
enthuses, no doubt sure there'll be a few whinges about the younger generation.
Hepworth, himself a few years older and no doubt wiser than those first
teenagers adds: ``The baby boomers are once again causing a stir. They're
re-inventing middle-age and demanding a more positive attitude to ageing.
``They've always been a loud and visible group with high expectations and the
power to change what they don't like. They are already changing attitudes
towards later life and helping to improve the quality of it.''

In Berlin lunch is delightful. The city exudes a sense of the risqu, a
Bohemian permissiveness. But the restaurants are elegant, the food surprisingly
adventurous and the wine list so extensive you can effortlessly avoid polluting
your taste buds with the sickly or insipid German variety.
Also German professionals seem more interesting than those at home. I am sure
they care about where Borussia Dortmund is lying in the league or the problems
of their golf handicap but, thankfully, they tend to keep these concerns to
themselves. They would much rather discuss the single currency or their
country's place in Europe. I know this attitude would disqualify them from
appearing on any programme out of Cowcaddens but it makes a refreshing change
from 100 women discussing the menopause.
What is uncomfortable, however, is the growing Anglophobia. In short, we Brits
are not popular.
For those who wondered what the Germans were obsessed with, when not on holiday
skulking around to place their towels next to the swimming pool, I can tell
you. It is Perfidious Albion.
I arrived at a bad time, mind you. The papers were full of Germans, worried
about the future of the Deutschmark, secreting money in Swiss bonds. There has
not been such vigorous cross-border activity since the Nazis plundered Europe's
treasures for posterity or their pension plan, which ever came first.
Then there was the news that billions of marks were making another exodus, this
time to UK shores for investing in industry. Hard on their heels whole
companies were preparing a flit to take advantage of our low labour costs.
Furthermore, John Major has been colluding with Jacques Chirac to undermine the
Fourth Reich, currently operating under the guise of the European Union.
Neither wants a federalist Europe so they have been chummy, and are prepared to
stick the stiletto in Chancellor Kohl at the appropriate time.
All of which makes you rather proud to be British. I haven't felt this way
since Margaret Thatcher bestrode the globe and we were all able to command
large sums of currency from foreign banks in exchange for a few dog-eared pound
notes.
My lunchtime companions were an economist, a lawyer - both women - and a trade
unionist who could not eat his meal because he was so upset. It was ``unfair'',
they chanted, that we were taking das Brot from their mouths when they had the
problems of unification with the East, were Europe's biggest paymasters and
were doing their best to make the EU uberglucklich, which may sound
uncomfortable but actually means blissfully happy.
(I hadn't the heart to tell them we were uberglucklich already after hearing
that Chunghwa, the Taiwanese company, was bringing 3300 jobs to Mossend because
of lower labour costs, skilled workers and an excellent infrastructure).
It seemed the wrong thing to say that we must be doing something right if we
are able to put one over on the strongest economy in Europe but I said it
anyway. The reaction was similar to Arthur Scargill turning up to a cheese and
wine party at the Blairs.
``Nein, nein,'' was the anguished cry. This was the equivalent, they said, if I
may loosely translate, of robbing Helmut to pay Fritz.
We were all in a sinking tub together and the only way to patch it up was a
stability pact, something dreamt up by Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, and Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank President. It is a real wheeze.
The plan is to punish with fines those countries which do not run their
economies properly and pile up budget deficits after they have joined the
single currency.
It would mean we would lose all sovereignty over taxation, fiscal policy,
spending and borrowing. They smugly announced this will be presented at the
Euro Summit in Madrid next month. (As my trade union friend played with his
bratwurst my thoughts wandered to Alex Salmond and his contention that we would
all be better off with independence in Europe.)
Of course, this passion for closer union has little to do with providing more
jobs in Drumchapel, more to do with the Deutschmark. They are paranoid about
it. Maybe they have reason after the inflationary excess of the thirties which
made the 27% rate achieved by the last Labour government - almost as distant a
memory - seem prudent.
Opinion polls show overwhelmingly that the majority of Germans are reluctant to
exchange the Deutschmark for a single currency. Now the opposition Social
Democrats are exploiting the formerly taboo subject of the European Monetary
System for political ends.
But this will do nothing for the unemployment which bedevils their continent
with one in 10 out of work - one in five if you are under 25, although to be
fair they don't have a Gordon Brown to propose starving youngsters into a job.
Nevertheless in America unemployment is lower than 6% and just more than 3% in
Japan.
When will they ever learn the problem is that labour is taxed too heavily in
Europe? In America and Japan taxes and social security contributions add up to
about 30% of GDP. In the EU it is more than 40% ranging from Britain - with the
lowest at 33% - to Denmark with 52%. Add to that the regulations which bind
business and it is obvious that Europe's problems are structural, not cyclical.
Meddling economics are the bane of every nation's life. If we had an
independent bank like the Bundesbank, Eddie George would have raised interest
rates months ago. It would have spelled disaster and everyone now recognises
these should be cut. Economists yesterday expressed surprise at the healthier
state of the UK's public sector borrowing requirement. What baloney. Don't they
know that corporation tax is usually paid in October and that the sum would be
significant because of high growth last year? And because borrowing is down the
Chancellor is now able to leave more of our pay in our pockets. Now there's a
further surprise.
Cut taxes. Cut interest rates. Cut public borrowing. Pass me a glass of
Riesling.

THE REFEREE
THE ROOM was dimly lit, feet shuffled embarrassingly, an awkward silence
gradually pervaded the air. Eventually, one man stood up, head bowed, and
blurted out ``I admit it: I am a referee'', and sat down to warm applause.
Fantasy, of course, but Referees Anonymous might not be such a bad notion for a
group of men whose fondness for the traumas of football arbitration sets them
as a race apart, a kind of masochistic order whose inner workings will forever
remain impenetrable.
They are a motley collection of architects, lawyers, builders, plumbers and
social workers who discard their rational personnae on a Saturday afternoon to
perform the modern version of the Christians having a day out at the Colosseum.
Unlike the Christians, however, they volunteer. They do get paid, a princely
#130 for League matches, more for Cup games, but the verbal assault they endure
would persuade very few sane adults to work for that money.
Who would be a referee? The answer seems to be failed players or, at least,
young men who had the honesty to recognise they were never going to be good
enough to earn a living playing the game. No matter how many you talk to, you
will discover a common denominator - the desire to be involved in football,
somehow.
``It is really just love of football,'' was how Kenny Hope, former top ref and
now one of the referee supervisors employed by the SFA, put it. ``And no matter
how many people mock that ideal, it is the truth. Football is in their blood
and they want to take part, to give something to it.
``You may have to be a born referee, to have the grit and guts to face up to
the life. They have to put up with a lot but they would tell you it is worth
it.'' That ``lot'' can vary from experience to experience but most of the
referees who make it to Grade 1 status have had some hairy moments in their
early days.
One current premier ref, who prefers to remain anonymous in the current glare
of publicity following last weekend's controversy at Ibrox, recalls his early
times with a shudder, particularly trying to cope with amateur football.
``It can be quite terrifying sometimes,'' he said, ``and funny in hindsight.
``For example, I was not alone in having to dodge a car trying to run me over
in the carpark after a game but one of the funniest incidents, although not at
the time, happened after one amateur game when there had been problems on the
park.
``After the game the secretary came to pay me. When I opened the door, standing
in my spruce blazer and flannels, a bucket of water went over me. I wasn't
laughing at the time, I can tell you.''
He also remembered one match in Glasgow during which he genuinely did not
believe he was going to get out alive and sent out a message for police help
before the game was ended.
Is the love of the game worth all of this? His own view would suggest that the
camaraderie among the refs themselves is one good reason for sticking with it.
``The fun comes in the togetherness we feel as a society, a fraternity. We are
a close-knit bunch, you know. Anyway, the truth is that people don't like us,
but only for 90 minutes. When we bump into fans off the field we find that they
just want to talk about the game. The hatred is gone.'' There may have been a
touch of self-comfort in those remarks, even self-delusion, but in his position
you might seek some solace beyond #130.
Kenny Hope has been luckier than most of his peers, not having experienced some
of the excesses that even Grade 1 men suffer.
Davie Syme, for example, was locked in his dressing room at Tynecastle after
one game during which he did not seem to endear himself to the home
aficionados. Much play was made of rumours that a director had been the turnkey
but the mystery, if it was such, never was officially unravelled.
Another leading light had to stand by while his door was kicked in at half time
by a prominent manager demanding answers to questions. The man's team was
winning 3-0 at the time, too.
Stories of severe intimidation by the most renowned managers are part of the
game's folklore and, if some are apocryphal, others are unquestionably true.
Another well-known ref can recall once when one manager awaited him at the edge
of the tunnel after a major game in which there had been a few controversial
happenings.
``I knew what he was waiting for, all right, but I stood still and waited for
him to move. When he moved I moved until we got to my dressing room. Before he
could say anything I said: ``If you want to speak to me *!*! off! and shut the
door. He cooled down and actually thanked me later on.''
Tales of threatened muggings are pretty normal in their bizarre world but one
man in the middle has a rather unusual recollection of such an instance. ``It
was in the Emirates, I ordered a player off but he refused to go, saying `My
father is a sheikh'. I told him I didn't care if his father was the Archbishop
of Canterbury, he was going off.
``When we were leaving the field he was waiting for me, dressed in all his
glory. But I spotted the open-toed sandals and unfortunately slipped and stood
on his foot in my boots. I never saw him again.''
Supervisor Kenny Hope is at pains to point out that his job now is not to
``crucify'' referees from his perch in the stand. ``We are there to help him. I
tell you this, I feel a great deal of sympathy for the lads nowadays, with the
scrutiny they come under, bearing in mind there are TV cameras at every corner
of the ground, taking in every incident, on and off the ball. The referee still
has to make his mind up immediately, whereas people like yourself can study
tapes as many times as you like before offering an opinion. I don't believe the
public would want a game held up to see TV replays, like American football. It
would lose its momentum.
``The referee gives his decision honestly, right or wrong. Personally, I would
like to stay with that.''
Yet one of his own roles is to fill in a form after each match, pointing out
any errors made by the officials. He would argue that this is so that the
referee can learn from mistakes. The supervisor would also include incidents,
such as violence, that the referee had missed in his report. ``That is not done
to persecute a player but as a normal section of the report. I have never been
asked by the SFA to put in a special report on any incident.''
If the major battle any referee always fights is against criticism, he also has
to be staunchly principled, particularly abroad. It is not unknown for
chicanery to be afoot when the man in the middle plays such an influential part
in any game. Currently, a Dutch referee is suspended pending investigation of
alleged betting irregularities which supposedly involved his having bets on
games he refereed.
Others have taken substantial bribes, sometimes in kind rather than cash, and
if you imagine corruption has been entirely erased listen to the recent tale of
one Scot who, understandably, also wishes to be anonymous.
``Only once in my time have I had to face up to that kind of persuasion and
that was abroad. The chairman of the club concerned made it quite clear that
there would be substantial reward if the result went the way he wanted. In
effect, he asked me to cheat.
``When the result turned out to be different from what he requested, neither he
nor his fellow officials turned up at the after-match dinner they had arranged
for us. I think he took the huff.''
Jim McCluskey, who has been one of the leading lights in Scotland, is one of
the few referees who played the game at senior level. McCluskey was an Airdrie
signing but had to give up the game when he was 26 because of injury. ``I
suppose the next best thing was refereeing, but it is a long way behind
playing,'' he says.
Players past and present have had an ambivalent relationship with the man in
the middle, but Tony Higgins, secretary of the Scottish Professional Players'
Association, believes that, in the end, they will all ask only that referees be
honest.
``There is immense presure on them now, more than ever before because of the
sophisticated cameras that cover games and all they can do is to act honestly.''
Higgins, who was one of the original gentle giants as a player, recalls one of
the six times he was booked in his 17-year career and still has a chuckle.
``I was getting a wee bit thicker round the waist by then. The referee gave a
foul against me during a game with Stranraer against Albion Rovers but it was
so obvious the decision should have been the other way that I started slapping
my thighs with laughter.
``You can't be serious,'' I said, but he threatened to send me off if I didn't
stop. I replied: ``If you do you'll have to tell the SFA you ordered me off for
laughing. I think he saw what I meant.''
Finally, if there is anyone left out there who wishes to enter the profession,
here is the official supporters guide to the perfect credentials:
n Birth details: parents unknown.
n Religion: Bluenose/fenian.
n IQ: Chimpanzee status.
n Identifying features: Poor vision, autocratic bearing, orange streak down one
arm, green down the other.
n Favourite author: Marquis de Sade.
n Role model: Willie Miller.
n Clothes: Hair-shirt.
n Food: Lemon or orange sorbet.
Laugh we may, but without them there is no ball game.

<HEADLINE>Missing bones may remain a mystery, judge tells jury</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975323157</RECORDNO>

JURORS trying Rosemary West on 10 counts of murder were told yesterday that the
mystery of the missing bones might never be resolved.
``It is one of these holes in the case that will never be filled,'' Mr Justice
Mantell declared, continuing his summing up.
Winchester Crown Court has been told that the bodies of young girls and women
were mutilated and, when their remains were unearthed at 25 Cromwell Street,
Gloucester, many bones were missing.
The judge said yesterday the jury might think they were removed routinely -
``for what reason, who knows?'' Frequently, one or both kneecaps were not
there. In some cases, the great majority of wrist, ankle, finger, and toe bones
were missing.
The judge has told the jury that they might just have been able to understand
the horrific proposition that the feet and hands had been removed in their
entirety.
However, that could not be the case, as not all bones from the feet and hands
were missing. This could only have been the result of deliberate mutilation,
said Mr Justice Mantell.
``To what end was it done?'' he asked. ``Was it before or after death. Who
knows? Perhaps, like me, you would prefer to believe it was after death.''
There was no evidence as to why the bones were missing. The only fact was that
they were.
In that case, the jury would have to consider the length of time involved and
what preparation had to be made in advance and what steps had to be taken
afterwards.
The Crown alleges that the killings and mutilations at 25 Cromwell Street could
not have happened without the knowledge of Mrs West.
Mrs West pleads not guilty to 10 counts of murder, including that of her
daughter, Heather, who disappeared, aged 16, and her stepdaughter, Charmaine,
who was aged eight when she went missing.
Continuing his summing up in chronological order, Mr Justice Mantell said
Frederick West attended Gloucester Royal Hospital for treatment to a hand
laceration on January 3, 1974. The judge pointed out that one of the victims,
Ms Lucy Partington, disappeared on December 27, 1973.
The prosecution suggests, he said, it was not coincidental that West required
hospital treatment a few days after her disappearance. A knife was found along
with her remains. Mr Justice Mantell told the jury he was afraid that the
assumption involved the grisly conclusion, one that the jury would have to
consider, that Ms Partington had been kept alive for a period of time before
being killed.
Alternatively, her body had been kept for some days before it was mutilated.
Either way, the Crown contended it would be quite impossible for Mrs West not
to have known of her presence.
Alternatively, the defence point out that her stepdaughter, Mrs Anne Marie
Davis, had lived at 25 Cromwell Street for most of the time and she had known
nothing.
The judge said the taped police interview by West would seem to contain a
number of lies. The Crown had stated that his story that he had known Ms
Partington for some months before killing her was clearly untrue.
The jury would have to consider that, if West was solely responsible for
killing Partington, as he claimed, why was it necessary to rewrite the script.
``Unless, say the prosecution, he was trying to wipe out the part played by
Rosemary West,'' the judge said. Even if West had lied, it did not take the
jury the full distance. He said the prosecution had to make them sure Mrs West
did participate in the killings.
The judge told the jury that, while Mrs West had latterly chosen not to respond
to police questions, they should draw no adverse conclusions from that. ``She
is perfectly entitled to do that,'' he said.
Dealing with the murder of Heather, found decapitated and dismembered, he
referred the jury to Mrs West's reaction when told her husband had confessed.
Defence counsel had described the response as that of a woman greatly
distressed, while the prosecution said it was an ``Oscar-winning performance'',
as were the tears the jury had seen cried by Mrs West from time to time at the
mention of Heather.
The seven-week trial was adjourned until Monday morning, when the judge will
complete his summing up and send out the jury to consider its verdicts.
The jury have been told to bring overnight suitcases.

n.NOT that we'd blame those doom-laden RAC adverts, where the super chic female
doctor gets stranded on an evil stretch of dockland obviously left over from
the set of Blade Runner, helplessly waiting to be rescued by the dashing
mechanic on the motorbike, but we are at a stage where six out of seven women
say they would fear for their safety if their cars did break down.
This is according to research by Autoglass, which has teamed up with the Suzy
Lamplugh Trust to offer a safety checklist for female motorists. They also
pledge to treat lone women callers as a priority; they will be along within 90
minutes to fit a new windscreen. Suzy Lamplugh Trust, the charity for personal
safety, is on 0181 392 1839.
n.A HEARTFELT plea from Maggie Fulton, old girl of Notre Dame High School in
Dowanhill, Glasgow, alma mater of such as Maria Fyfe MP and opera singer
Josephine McQueen, now the only local authority all-girls school in
Strathclyde, and fast approaching its centenary in 1997.
If details of the celebrations have been hush-hush up to now it may be because
such loyal graft as Fulton's, who is putting together a centenary book, often
goes unnoticed, in life as in newspapers. However, events include a Centenary
Mass, celebrated by Cardinal Winning; City Chambers civic reception; concert;
open day; time capsule; and a slap-up dinner at the Moat House. Maggie Fulton
would like to hear from past pupils with stories for the book. Contact her on
0141 632 8810.
n.SHAME on publishers Routledge, whose impenetrable press release advertising
its sparky new publication, Working with Men: Feminism and Social Work,
contains some horrendous spelling errors - it's writeen (sic) by feminists,
understaking (sic) to overturn the view that men are responsible for their own
recontruction (sic) and yet manages to keep a straight face while stating:
``The contributors conclude that direct work with men is a legitimate feminist
activity.'' Well, that's a relief. I thought I'd never be able to set foot in
the office again.
n.FOR those of you who thought hosting a party meant nipping down to Marks &amp;
Sparks and stocking up on the salmon roulade bites, or down to the offie for a
12-pack of Tennents, comes good news in the shape of ``top party designer and
caterer'' Johnny Roxburgh. He arrives highly recommended in the form of a press
release from posh people's magazine Tatler, and just happens to be popping in
to Frasers in Glasgow next Wednesday, 1.30pm to 4pm.
A cheery soul, Johnny ``will charm even the most party shy into holding the
event of the year'' with such advice as: ``DON'T have paper napkins''; ``DO
have great soap and lots of loo paper and towels''; ``DO have serious ice'' (as
opposed to the frivolous sort, always cracking up, I suppose) and, amazingly,
``Invite good friends''.
n.SPOTLIGHT on la femme francaise in the French Film Festival showing at the

<TEXT>
A HIGH stakes test of strength between President Clinton and Congress showed
signs of easing tonight, even as the President prepared to veto the latest
Republican plan to end a budget crisis and instead came up with a plan of his
own.
Repeating his vow to veto a second temporary funding Bill drawn up by the
Republicans, Clinton sent Congress his own stopgap measure aimed at ending a
four-day government shutdown.
``I urge the Congress to act on this legislation promptly and to return it to
me for signing,'' he said in a message to Congress.
The first breath of compromise came earlier from Senate Democratic leader Tom
Daschle, who said the President might be willing to back off demands for a
funding law free of any of the strings demanded by Republican leaders.
He predicted that ``a middle ground'' would be found, with Clinton backing off
his demand for a ``clean'' Bill and the Republicans moving away from their
``hardcore, hardline'' demand that the US budget be balanced within seven years.
However the White House today stuck to the decision to veto the funding law
passed on Thursday. ``We expect the Bill will arrive sometime today, we don't
know when. When it does the President, having announced yesterday he will veto
the legislation, will veto the legislation,'' said White House spokesman Mike
McCurry.-Reuter

<HEADLINE>Armed killers captured on camera repaired by victim</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975323160</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THREE armed robbers were jailed for life yesterday for the murder of a repair
man shot in the back while he lay on the ground during a jewellery shop raid.
Mr Leyland Hoppie, 46, had been repairing a security camera minutes before the
shooting. A video tape recovered from the camera helped capture his killers.
``It is a fortunate irony in the murder of Mr Hoppie that it was his work in
the shop that day which helped to bring these three defendants to justice,''
prosecutor Nigel Sweeney told the Old Bailey in London.
After the shooting in September last year, Shiraz Bhayat, 21, Neville Andrews,
27, and Junior Willis, 27, ran off with jewels worth more than #15,000 and a
security camera - but not the one Mr Hoppie had just repaired.
It recorded the trio bursting into RSA Jewellers in Green Lanes, Ilford.
Mr Hoppie, from Wisbech, Cambridge, was forced to the ground at gunpoint.
``He was shot in the back at close range as he lay on the ground defenceless,''
Mr Sweeney said. The pellets entered his back to a depth of almost 14cms -
severing his spine. He died soon after despite the efforts of a doctor and
paramedics flown to the scene by helicopter to save him.
During the trial, the jury was shown a double-barrelled sawn-off shotgun, said
to be the murder weapon carried by Willis, and also a .38 Smith and Wesson
revolver, carried by Bhayat.
Bhayat, of Bouverie Road, and Andrews, of Glenmar Road, both Stoke Newington,
north London, and Willis, of Mulberry Court, Leyton, east London, had denied
murder, robbery, and firearms offences. They showed no emotion as the jury,
reduced to 11 by illness, returned its verdicts after two-days of deliberations.
As they were led to the cells, people in the gallery of the court shouted abuse
and cried ``racist.'' All three defendants are coloured and their victim was
black.
The Common Serjeant of London, Judge Neil Denison, apologised to the jurors for
the outburst and advised them to leave the Old Bailey by the rear entrance in
case there was any trouble.
After their verdicts, the jury heard that all three men had convictions for
robberies and in Bhayat's case his record included two knifepoint robberies on
jewellers.
Bhayat claimed in the witness box that he had not been on the robbery and had
spent the day at home. The other two did not give evidence.
After the verdicts, the victim's brother, Mr Stephen Hoppie, said: ``I would
like to remember him as he was, somebody caring, somebody who was kind and who
thought about other people.''

<HEADLINE>Home growers of cannabis</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975323161</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
I WOULD like to thank all those friends and associates who have given us their
unreserved support over the past year and who are baffled at what purpose can
be served by the the sentence of 18 months' imprisonment imposed on my wife
Rosalind for growing cannabis for her own use.
The courts maintain that the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971,
compel them to treat this offence seriously and to show no mercy to cannabis
growers.
Clearly one result of the sentence is that it has stopped Rosalind growing and
using the drug but this could have been achieved at minimal public expense by a
police warning as would have happened had the offence been committed in many
parts of England.
It is unlikely to have any effect on the general level of cannabis usage when
considered along with the approach adopted by the Scottish police who told the
Scottish Affairs Committee last year that they targeted dealers but simple
possession cases came to light as a result of the investigation of other
offences such as burglary (sic) or breach of the peace, when the offender in
question happened also to be in possession of cannabis.
Given the provisions of the Act the sentence was specifically directed at
deterring home growers of cannabis. No doubt it will make cannabis users who
are contemplating growing it think twice. Users who already grow their own may
well cease doing so and return to the black market for their supply.
In effect the courts have found themselves compelled to protect the illicit
cannabis market, a consequence which must have been far from the minds of those
who drafted the legislation.
There are similar statutory provisions against the home production of whisky.
This analogy was drawn on by Bill Walker, MP, in a futile attempt to justify
the sentence.
The licensed manufacture of whisky is a legitimate business providing
considerable revenue to the state which it is entitled to protect. The cannabis
market, estimated to gross some #2.2billion in the United Kingdom annually,
only lines the pockets of organised crime.
Worldwide other countries are reappraising policy on cannabis. In Europe states
which have adopted a more pragmatic approach to the problem such as Italy,
Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and parts of Germany have recognised the
absurdity of relaxing the law against cannabis users while protecting the
dealers' market by prohibiting home growing and have made provision for
grower/users to be treated in the same way as users.
The court's hands are tied by the provisions of the Act. Clearly it is contrary
to any conceivable drugs policy to provide statutory protection for the illicit
market. This unforeseen anomaly demands the urgent attention of Parliament.

Ken Cowan, Aids activist; born February 23, 1955, died November 11, 1995
KEN Cowan, one of the foremost Aids activists in the West of Scotland, has
died, aged 40. He was a major force in the development of Body Positive
(Strathclyde), the self-help agency for those living with HIV, and in November
1994 he became founder/director of Phace West, the project for HIV and Aids
education in the West of Scotland.
During his student years, Ken Cowan became well known as an activist in
left-wing political circles and was a founder member of the Scottish Labour
Party.
Later, his involvement with gay rights led to his becoming a founder member in
the late seventies of the influential Scottish Homosexual Rights Group, a
platform from which he staunchly campaigned for equal rights for the community
to which he belonged.
His HIV diagnosis in 1991 was a major personal challenge which he met with
great courage. However, he was equally challenged by the many unanswered
questions surrounding the whole issue of HIV and Aids and his scepticism about
medical knowledge in the field is well known. (His faith in his specialist at
Glasgow's Ruchill Hospital, Dr Dermot Kennedy, was, however, complete until the
end.)
Ken was a charismatic man who tenaciously held his opinions, but he thrived on
the challenge of spirited debate. He passionately pursued his knowledge of the
complicated issues surrounding HIV and was particularly skilful in fighting
against the prejudice, and dispelling the myths, surrounding the virus. His
eloquence on the subject was always compelling, whether he was teaching school
children, or convincing politicians and health board funders.
His determination ultimately brought about key policy changes which in turn
have radically affected HIV services in the West of Scotland. At Ruchill
Hospital, for example, he insisted patients be invited on to the carers'
sub-committee and that became a reality.
He was responsible for highlighting the relative underemphasis on HIV
prevention initiatives for gay men and this ultimately led to the West of
Scotland's success in an awareness strategy. He was also very interested in
breaking down barriers which separated the Catholic Church and issues of
sexuality.
His legacy is today positively benefiting those people affected by HIV and
helping to protect future generations from it.

IT is one thing for Anne Evans to tell all us firework people to go to the park
(Death of a dog, November 14), but you can well imagine my face when I returned
not to a Roman Candle but a Fido Pooh in my garden on November 5.
Surely people who love dogs should love our environment which extends to nice

LET us for a moment play Desert Island discs with the Bible. You are about to
be shipwrecked in the Pacific Ocean (for the purposes of this wheeze it is
warmer and there are more islands to provide shelter). You are carrying a set
of scrolls and a book of the Bible is written upon each, just as it was with
the originals which were written and assembled at different times and
situations.
However, the snag is that you can take only three scrolls with you since the
weight of more would sink the flimsy raft upon which you are hoping to reach
the shore. Which three scrolls would you take? I have no doubts about my choice.
My three would consist of an Old Testament book, an epistle, and a gospel, not
necessarily for liturgical reasons but it would be a nice balance. These would
be the book of Ecclesiastes, the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and the
gospel of Mark. I am now trying to discern why I made these choices.
The choice of Mark is easy to explain. It is generally thought to be the
earliest gospel and therefore closest to the events it describes, unadorned by
retrospective theologising.
It presents a very human Jesus and tells the gospel story dramatically but
concisely (as the actor Alec McOwen demonstrated when he rendered it as a
one-man play). First Corinthians is also easy to explain. It packs into its 16
chapters reflections on death, love, and practical advice about how to deal
with the quarrels which seem to be integral to church life then and now.
The passages on death and love are among the finest Paul ever penned and
especially so when read in the English translation made by William Tyndale in
the early 1500s and poached by the compilers of the King James Bible nearly a
century later. ``O Death where is thy sting?...... Charity suffereth long and
is kind......''
My third choice is probably a less popular one, but if ever there was a book
for our age, Ecclesiastes is it. Some people consider it is ``not Christian''
but that seems to me a bit silly since it belongs to the Jewish canon and a bit
impudent to imagine it ever would be.
When I get especially exasperated with fundamentalists or revisionist zealots
who want a gay gospel or to rewrite the Ten Commandments as a charter of animal
rights, I turn to Ecclesiastes. His world-weary cynicism is a perfect antidote
to these fanatics and their silly obsessions. ``Vanity, vanity - all is
vanity,'' he observes.
The preacher/teacher who is the author of Ecclesiastes is a sane voice amid
fanaticism, a balanced view and a pragmatist who prefers wisdom to folly, but
is wise enough to know the limits of his wisdom. He lives for the present and
does not expect too much from either God or his fellow creatures.
He is far from politically correct (for example ``the heart of the wise
inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left'' 10v2). His
ability with sound bites and one-liners is much sharper than the book of
Proverbs which it follows in the biblical canon. ``If the axe is dull and its
edge unsharpened, more strength is needed. But skill will bring success.''
Some modern translations render ``vanity'' as meaninglessness which, in my
view, makes the preacher into a nihilist. Perhaps vanity is not the best word,
but it conveys the sense of pretension and pomposity which I am certain is
intended. If ever there was a book to speak to our times it is this. To those
who think their religion or their atheism has all the answers: ``No man knows
whether love or hate awaits him...... as it is with those who take oaths, so it
is with those who are afraid to take them.''
To those who could not care less about the consequences of their actions is
there a better motto for conservationists than: ``as dead flies give perfume a
bad smell so a little folly outweighs wisdom.''
He has sensible advice for those who care too much about their cause or
campaign, what Richard Holloway in his excellent lecture this week on the
follies of fundamentalism identified as ``the provisionality of all systems,
symbols, and instruments''. He pointed out that this leads to a kind of
idolatry in which things which are relative are treated as if they are
absolutes.
There is much of Ecclesiastes about Bishop Holloway, the Episcopal Church's top
ecclesiastic. His thinking about the Bible - that it is a creature of its times
and its truths provisional - is in direct opposition to fundamentalism.
Does that mean that we must consign the Bible to the status of a ``historic
statement'' with increasingly less relevance to our fast-changing world? I
think not, and it is Ecclesiastes who helps me to think thus. He encourages me
to be sceptical about new gurus, cynical about those who claim to be able to
eliminate the ills of the world, gently content with the wisdom which has
proved itself through the years, and that it is right and proper to eat, drink,
and enjoy oneself ``under the sun''.
Come to think of it, there cannot be many better mottos for living on a desert
island - which was the point of taking my copy of Ecclesiastes in the first
place. And it even gives me practical advice on how to get off the island which
does not require me to rely upon a miracle. ``Cast your bread upon the waters
and it will return to you after many days'', he tells me in chapter 11, verse
one. Presumably that applies to putting a message in a bottle and waiting to be
rescued.

THE latest antics of the Russian politician Zhirinovsky, remind us of the eerie
similarity between him and the late Nazi leader Hitler.
Both men came out of obscurity. Both wrote of an unhappy, troubled childhood.
Hitler was anti-Semitic, so is Zhirinovsky.
Hitler came to power through the democratic process. Barring a successful
assassination attempt, the overwhelming likelihood is that Zhirinovsky will win
the 1996 Russian presidential elections.
Indeed, the situation in Russia today is reminiscent of conditions in Weimar
Germany prior to Hitler coming to power - chaos, disillusionment, and despair.
These are the conditions ripe for a dictatorship.
Hitler had an electrifying effect on the German people unmatched by any other
politician. The same can be said of Zhirinovsky among Russians.
Before and after Hitler came to power, the international press today tends to
dismiss Zhirinovsky as ``the clown prince'', a ``political jester'', a
``buffoon'' etc, much as they reacted to Hitler.
This will prove to be a great mistake. Zhirinovsky is a man of destiny.

<HEADLINE>Drugged rioters spark scenes from hell in Athens jail chaos Athens, Friday</HEADLINE>

PRISONERS high on drugs stolen from the jail pharmacy, fires, cries of agony
and stabbings combined today to create scenes from hell in a revolt by more
than 1000 inmates at an Athens prison.
``I was raped. Please get me out of here. I just stole a car,'' cried one
16-year-old boy as police rushed him and other juveniles to the top security
prison's management building in a bid to protect them.
The air was thick with the smell of teargas fired by riot police struggling to
keep prisoners from fleeing the prison grounds. Ambulances with sirens wailing
collected the injured while relatives pleaded for information.
Maria Papoutsaki, the mother of an inmate, grabbed a journalist's arm and said
in a trembling voice: ``I beg you, tell me if my son is alive. He is a drug
addict . . . you can find out.''
At least 36 prisoners have been injured since Tuesday in the rampage through
the overcrowded Korydallos prison on the western outskirts of Athens.
Four convicts are known to have died, three from drug overdoses on pills looted
from the prison hospital.
The fourth, a foreigner, was hanged by other inmates. ``They threw the charred
body into the prison yard,'' said a senior police officer. ``There are many
unsettled feuds among Greek and foreign inmates and now that they control the
prison they try to get even.''
Police said they could see the slumped figures of 10 to 15 more prisoners
around the compound but did not not know whether they were dead or in a
drug-induced stupor.
``We are afraid we will see more victims,'' said Thanasis Georgantas, leader of
the prison staff union. ``The prisoners raided the pharmacy and took 2500
syringes and 27,000 pills. We had just got in new supplies.''
The rioters have burned and wrecked everything in sight.
Frightened Korydallos residents, whose homes are on the prison's perimeter,
spent much of the night outside ready to flee if the prisoners managed to break
out. All schools in the area are closed.
The inmates today roamed freely, armed with knives from the prison kitchen,
iron bars and shards of broken glass. They have poured petrol in the prison's
four main blocks and are threatening to set them on fire if police storm
in.-Reuter

THERE are an awful lot of them about. Streets full of them. Offices bursting
with them. Public houses spilling them over and out. The nation's sporting
stadia positively awash with them. It's not as if men are some strange alien
presence newly disembarked from inter-planetary craft and thrust for the first
time into our vision and our ken. We work with them, and play with them and
sleep with them and an extraordinary number of us still choose to enter into
the kind of long-term domestic contract with them now rarely available in any
other sphere of living. So how can it be that women know so little of them? Not
aliens but certainly still strangers.
And here is another paradox; the women who nurtured them, who shaped much of
their early conditioning, who formed their most ubiquitous adult role model in
their formative pre-school years - their mothers - don't understand them either.
Curiouser still, the mothers see no ambivalence in railing against unacceptable
masculine behaviour in husbands, fathers and lovers yet apparently conniving in
the production of a clone in the person of their own son. Women help to make
boys into the kind of men they can't understand, probably don't much like, and
are sometimes afraid of. Frogs and snails and puppy dog's tails probably don't
have much going for them as ingredients for a rounded human being. But neither
do the kind of qualities we still seem set on instilling in them making vices
from obvious virtues like the honest expression of emotion.
There are of course differences in the basic raw material parents have to deal
with concerning their sons and their daughters. Periodic research confirms that
men are usually stronger and faster with a truer aim whether they're hurling
Olympic javelins or pub darts. The women you see whizzing round the 400-metre
track poured into lycra and clocking up record times may have sexy hair,
earrings and fingernails the colour of blood. What they don't have is much in
the boobs and buttocks department. They're not like men, of course, but they're
built along more similar lines than their well-endowed sisters.
You don't need to be conversant with the basic laws of aerodynamics to deduce
that Dolly Parton wasn't constructed with the Fosbury flop in mind. But the
problem that men have now is that strength and speed are not commodities in
quite the same demand in a modern society and more particularly in a modern
economy. Women, who tend to score more highly in the dexterity stakes, are
arguably more natural users of a keyboard despite the fact that the information
superhighway seems positively jammed with male traffic, much of which would
seem to have broken down in some fashion and be in urgent need of professional
help.
And as the heavier industries are increasingly replaced by the electronic and
service varieties, strength is largely an irrelevant component for employers.
There are other areas, it's true, where male skills have traditionally had a
stronger profile. Men are generally supposed to have more analytical minds and
be more adept at the business of problem solving. Or so much of the published
evidence would have us believe. It would explain perhaps why little boys are
apparently more fascinated with construction toys like Lego just as their
grandfathers were with Meccano sets. This trait survives into later life in a
fascination with moving parts which is overwhelmingly masculine.
A woman at an evening class in car maintenance is there because the last bill
from the garage persuaded her that some DIY might stave off bankruptcy next
time the cylinder head gasket shuffled off its mechanical coil. Some men may be
there for similar reasons. Most seem to get a kick out of figuring out how
things work. I have yet to meet a woman whose idea of a fun Saturday afternoon
is stripping down the insides of a motor which was not sick in order to
reassemble it later that same day.
Other qualities often presupposed to be if not peculiarly masculine then
certainly preponderantly so, are traits like assertiveness, toughness,
combativeness and self reliance. Interestingly, women are usually checked off
against a different list. For assertive, read bossy. For toughness, read butch.
For self reliance read vanity.
In return, men who appear to have ``feminine'' qualities such as intuition and
a readiness to express their emotions openly are similarly rewarded with a hard
time. It wasn't women but other men who coined the term ``wimp'', who got into
bed with all that transatlantic psycho-babble about real men not eating quiche
and indeed only satisfied by red raw steak and beer straight from the neck of
the bottle. The problem with which, for men, is that ``real men'' as
constructed by the Marlboro ads, university beer bars, football supporters'
terracings, rugby club stag dinners, boxing matches and blood sports have
remarkably little appeal to women.
There is a mating ritual which has changed little over the years from the dance
hall to the disco, though perhaps excluding the rave. In order to summon the
necessary courage for the rigours ahead the male of the species takes to drink.
This gives him (literally) the bottle to approach strange women at the
preferred place of entertainment and to have the resilience to cope with
possible rejection.
The difficulty with this scenario is that our intrepid Lothario will consider
himself sexy and irresistible in a direct co-relation with the amount of Dutch
courage consumed. Sadly, this is a counter-productive tactic. The drunker they
are, the less desirable they are and the less likely they are to do anything
about any woman they persuade into their bed. It's a bummer chaps, but who said
life was fair?
Women have this strange inability to discern the attraction of being made
offers by drunks. It may be that we lack the necessary imagination. We
certainly lack the imagination to understand the attraction of that other
cherished male ritual the night out with the boys.
Certainly girls have nights out with the girls ..... but these are rather
different in intent, tone and style. As a special favour I am prepared to
reveal some of what goes on when women foregather in the company of their own
sex in exchange for some straight answers to some straight questions which
follow in due course.
There are women's office or factory nights out. These are characterised by
women getting dressed at least to maim, and joining their workmates for a meal
with a generous drinks kitty. The only men present will be the waiting staff
and perhaps some luckless soul who has persuaded himself that a small but
perfectly formed fee in used tenners is worth the ritual humiliation of
moonlighting from his studies/career as a male stripper. An updated variation
on this theme is the mob-handed outing to the Chippendales, though personally
I'm more of a Tap Dogs woman.
A more modest alternative is a group of female friends meeting for a meal or a
few drinks. The attraction of this is simple: women in the company of women are
prone to great frankness, especially where their male partners (shortcomings
thereof) are concerned. The occasions also guarantee the kind of belly laughter
not usually available in mixed company where there is considerable inhibition
on both sides of the gender divide. But outside of having a bit of a giggle
these occasions can also be invaluable as a kind of informal group therapy;
especially if one of the number is dealing with some kind of emotional,
maternal or medical crisis.
In contrast, from what little I have managed to deduce from interviewees, men
friends, and my own partner, men seem singularly reluctant to use their all
boys together events to discuss anything of any moment. Their lives may be
falling apart, redundancy or divorce may be looming, they may be in despair for
all manner of reasons but they don't seem able or willing to share their
burdens with their closest friends.
So what, gentlemen, is all this time honoured male bonding about? What do you
get from it outside of a guaranteed hangover? Honestly, I really, really want
to know. And I want to know because your apparent reticence is bad for your
health.
Men have a very poor record of taking care of their health or of seeking
medical attention until such time as pain or disability finally propels them to
the surgery.
Men die sooner and get sicker than women. There's also more likelihood of men,
especially young men, committing suicide, becoming homeless and down and out. A
terrifying waste. And you have to wonder how much of that is bound up in men's
seeming inability to voice their distress or seek solace from friends and
partners. Why can't a man be more like a woman!
But there is another great divide which is even more contentious. The other
morning I heard a radio colleague, Alex Bell, wonder aloud what it was we did
to 49 per cent of the population to make them do such horrible things. His
comments came on the back of a new Barnardo's report on abuse and violence,
especially against young people coming out from care with all the added
vulnerability that implies.
It is a fair question. All but a relative handful of prison inmates are male,
97 per cent of sexual abuse occurs by males against females. Men are
responsible for most violence both domestically and in society at large. You
could enlarge on that to suggest that most wars are caused by men, though the
tribal prejudices which prompt conflict are often shared by the women even if
they choose to pursue vendettas in different and less final ways.
Geneticists point out that boy babies are in receipt of the male hormone
testosterone from the seventh week after conception. By the age of 20 they have
enough of the stuff pumping around to make them feel pretty immortal if not
downright invincible though perhaps not that wise. But many men, most men,
deploy that raw sexual and physical energy in acceptable ways. Why do others
misuse their power to abuse their womenfolk or mutilate perfect strangers? And
why is it that marauding packs of young men can connive in the kind of
primitive, brutal behaviour that many of them would find appalling and
completely beyond the pale if they were on their own?
It's a conundrum sociologists, psychologists and assorted penal reformers have
long pondered. But common to their deliberations seems to be a belief that
children who are used violently are more likely to employ violent means as an
adult. Children who are given no sense of self worth have no particular esteem
for others or respect for their freedoms. Children who are taught hate and fear
have no template for the benefits of love and compassion.
It's not just small boys in dysfunctional homes who are treated badly of
course. But they do tend to bear the brunt of violent reprisals. It may not
excuse their graduating into hooliganism in their own right, but it perhaps
helps to explain it. It certainly makes it worthwhile expending time and effort
unpicking the motives of regular abusers as well as trying to heal their
victims. Not least because it is in the victims' and potential victims' best
interests.
The pessimist will point to the fact that most psychopaths are male, that
serial killers are almost always men, that ``bad'' women are often in a
manipulative relationship with wicked men. The optimist might prefer to
conclude that there are numerous examples of ``headbangers'' who have been
persuaded to confront the bankruptcy of their behaviour and construct a
meaningful non-violent life for themselves.
I started by suggesting that men were not an alien, but certainly a strange
species. Perhaps that still remains because as well as finding it difficult to
be entirely honest with each other ..... there is a real dearth of honesty with
the other sex. Ask any woman how problematical it is to have a real no holds
barred discussion with their partner. Very few will tell you that they have the
kind of frankness and verbal intimacy they hoped for.
So many topics fall off the agenda because men are too embarrassed to discuss
them. Perhaps too afraid what they'll see if they look at their relationship
too closely.
Perhaps conditioned to feel that talk of love and lack of romance and child
rearing is ``women's talk''. For very many years now we've heard talk of a
creature called ``new man''. From time to time there have even been sightings,
though verification has proved as difficult as with all other forms of UFO. But
I have faith that new man will eventually turn up in significant numbers.
Faith in men already visible with their babies strapped to their heartbeat in
papoose style carriers, in men who see tears as proof of their humanity rather
than an undermining of their masculinity, in men who see parenthood as a
partnership and employment opportunities as a matter for mutual discussion and
compromise within a relationship.
Such men are not scared of feminism. Such men are feminists themselves. They
realise that equality of opportunity doesn't just mean women expanding into
realms from which tradition and childbearing and sheer prejudice have excluded
them. They see the incomparable benefits of being freed from the tedious
business of being cast in all kinds of roles they don't fancy and for which, as
individuals, many may be altogether unsuited. They see an opportunity to have
real meaningful relationships with their children and be given real emotional
support by their partners. Put another way, let's hear it for men's liberation.

Eve Perrick Journalist; born December 21, 1916, died November 15, 1995
EVE Perrick, the famous Fleet Street columnist of the fifties, who died on
Tuesday at the age of 78, was my friend - and she also helped to change the
course of my life.
Countless readers of the Daily Express in its heyday will remember with
affectionate pleasure her witty and often vitriolic pen, and her wickedly
accurate debunking of human foibles and frailties (mainly among the rich and
famous of fashionable London).
But frequently, to howls of dismay and outrage, she would cast her gimlet dark
eye farther afield and poke not-quite-gentle fun at the quaintness of us
ordinary mortals who had the misfortune to live our lives so far from the
civilising challenges of her beloved London. She wisecracked like Hermione
Gingold and secretly loved to be likened to Dorothy Parker.
I think her first visit to Scotland was for the journalistic jamboree which
gathered at Deeside for Princess Margaret's 21st birthday, which was being
celebrated at Balmoral.
As a lesser luminary of the Scottish Daily Express I was assigned to act as
leg-woman to the great Perrick, feeding her with local colour and titbits of
news for her weekly column a column, I may say, which infuriated all Deeside
with its outrageously exaggerated descriptions of tartan-swathed matrons living
in turreted mini-mansions.
It was vintage Perrick and brought in gratifying sackfuls of indignant letters
to warm the heart of the paper's legendary editor, Arthur Christiansen, who
ranked Eve Perrick and her stable-mate Anne Edwards, the fashion editor, as
``the two best women columnists in Fleet Street''.
Eve, for all her cracks about women who did nothing but stay at home all day,
was a devoted wife and mother, and I have always regretted the faux pas I made
on my first visit when I asked Eve, in front of her daughter Penny, on which
day Eve would be leaving to cover a royal visit to Canada; I wasn't to know
that she hadn't got round to breaking the news of her imminent departure to the
child, and there were tearful scenes before I managed to make my escape.
After the first visit to London, Eve privily arranged for me to be summoned
back to be given my ``big chance'' in Fleet Street. It was a fascinating time.
After a few months I was offered a permanent job, a house and a mind-boggling
salary by the great Christiansen.
The talk of the watering-holes was that I had been brought to London to keep
the great Perrick up to scratch - or as one fellow-hack put it to me: ``You'll
be the girl that's here to put Perrick's nose out of joint.''
It was all too typical of the fevered, back-stabbing atmosphere of Fleet
Street. I declined the offer, the pull of Scotland was far too strong for me.
Eve understood perfectly, even if Christiansen didn't. We remained friends from
then on.
Some of her successors even vied for the title of Leading Bitch of Fleet
Street. But not Eve. She had a magnanimity and goodness of heart which made
her, quite simply, the First Lady.

BISHOP Holloway's lecture, largely agreed with by Father Tom Connelly, is not
the view of all Christians as your leader correctly avers (November 15). The
Rev Peter White's succinct comment is one which many believers would uphold and
agree with.
Paul, writing to Timothy, advises him (and us) of the soundness of scripture
and goes on to posit that men will turn from sound doctrine to myths.
And what else can we expect when lame or limp excuses are proffered up to
inform the sinner that there is no sin?
The Bible speaks plainly of sin and of its consequence, and it is not a
departure from the teaching of scripture we need, for we have already gone too
far. Rather we need a return to the teaching of scripture to posit clear moral
values before people.
If Bishop Holloway and his friends pursue the path they are on, then those who
uphold the Doctrines of Grace must depart from them because scripture cannot be
compromised.

THE last time a peace conference was held in the United States was in September
1978, and that was the turning point in the history of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. The President of Egypt, Anwar Sadat, and the Prime Minister of
Israel, Menachem Begin, were closeted in Camp David for 10 days to settle the
outline of the first peace agreement between Israel and one of her neighbours.
President Carter and his secretary of state, Cyrus Vance, were midwives for the
occasion and spent the entire time working on the two obdurate and difficult
statesmen, to persuade them to accept the deal. It was the high point of Jimmy
Carter's presidency.
Camp David was chosen because it was close to Washington and because the press
could be kept out. The President was to preside over the deliberations so he
needed to be within striking distance of the White House.
Camp David is in the hills north of Washington and is a Navy base. Presidents
have used it as a weekend retreat since Roosevelt, and there are comfortable
cabins for his guests and their hangers-on. During the conference, the press
camped out at a small town nearby. One TV network had a balloon floating
overhead to carry an aerial to ensure live transmission back to base, and the
place swarmed with reporters.
None of them got a story. When the press was summoned to hear the results
announced by the President's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, in
an office building next to the White House on September 17, no-one had the
faintest idea of what to expect. It was all very dramatic, and then there was
the signing, on live television, in the White House itself.
It was very satisfactory, for the American managers. It was also a great
nuisance for British newspapers which had to remake their front pages at three
in the morning.
This time, the Bosnian negotiators have been banished to an Air Force base in
Ohio. There is less press interest, and more access. We discovered, in 1978,
that Israelis and Egyptians can be exceedingly tight-lipped when they want. So
far, there has been a steady stream of leaks out of the Dayton talks, as
``sources'' slip out of the compound to talk to reporters.
All the same, as conferences go, it is fairly secure. The leaks are not always
reliable and there are still surprises: the Croat-Serbian agreement on Sunday
was not leaked in Dayton.
The three delegations are all housed in a rather low-rent hotel on the base and
have offices next to each other in a military building. Originally, these were
to be ``proximity talks''. The principals were not to negotiate with each
other, but with mediators, chiefly Americans, who would shuttle between them.
This system broke down immediately, and now the mediators are much encouraged,
we are told, to see Croats, Serbs and Muslims in intense discussion with each
other. There are now formal sessions every day, morning and afternoon.
The talks are at Wright-Patterson AFB near Dayton. The town is celebrated for
two historical reasons. Before the interstate highways were built, the main
inland north-south road and the east-west road intersected there. More
interesting, Dayton was where the Wright brothers had their bicycle shop.
There are still plenty of people who remember those two most celebrated of all
American inventors (they flew their first plane on the coast of North Carolina,
to take advantage of favourable winds). The air base is named after them.
Ohio is still part of the industrial heartland of America, the area around the
Great Lakes known rather derisively as the Rust Belt. Cleveland, on Lake Erie
to the north, is where John D Rockefeller had a hardware store and then went
into the oil business. It is still a major industrial town, and now boasts that
it is once again prosperous, after a long and difficult adaptation to modern
times.
Dayton, and the huge air base, are also part and parcel of industrial America,
but without the racial tensions, pollution and, be it said, romance of
Cleveland. There is a symphony orchestra, a museum, and the wheat fields
stretch away from the suburbs and factories.
The base was chosen for the talks to keep the participants away from the
fleshpots and media temptations of eastern cities.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, who has lived in New York,
protested at the choice. ``Do they think I'm a monk?'' he complained.
Local people, reportedly, were flattered at having an important diplomatic
event on their doorstep and displeased at the assumption by the rest of the
country that Dayton was a rural backwater where nothing ever happened.
The American calculation was that bringing the leaders together was the only
way of making progress. Indeed, the latest agreement, that the Serbs and Croats
have settled the future of Eastern Slavonia, was clearly a deal cut by
Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, in Dayton, even though the
announcement was made by lesser officials on the spot.
That is the Camp David principle. Sadat and Begin, when the Americans pushed
them hard enough, could make the decisions and guarantee that their governments
would accept them. The same goes for Milosevic and Tudjman (it is not so clear
that President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia has similar authority).
The difference is that the announcement of a peace agreement, if one is
reached, will be made on CNN instead of in the White House. CNN did not exist
in 1978 and reporters then had to camp out in Camp David - and then rush back
to Washington for the signing.
Now we can sit in our offices and follow it all just as closely as those who
have spent the past three weeks in Ohio.

Margaret Vaughan examines why the new head of the Forestry Commission has
created alarm among champions of the environment
THE roots of dismay among environmentalists at the choice of David Bills to
head the Forestry Commission lie faraway in the tangled forests of a ruggedly
beautiful island off mainland Australia.
Tasmania broke into the public consciousness in 1983 when British botanist
David Bellamy was arrested leading a protest, and thrown into jail. He claimed
its unique wilderness areas and virgin rainforests were under threat from dam
projects and tree felling.
With his almost messianic compulsion to protect the natural world from what he
perceives as the ravages of commercial enterprise it is hardly surprising that
he should be horrified to find an old adversary crossing the world to take over
the helm of the Forestry Commission, from it's Edinburgh headquarters.
David Bills began his career with the Australian company North Forest Products
Ltd in 1979, rising to become general manager in 1986. It was his company which
became the focus for the ire of environmental campaigners.
The firm is Australia's biggest exporter of wood chip to Japan. Much of its raw
products derive from clear felling of ancient forests in Tasmania where the
company owns three of the state's four woodchip mills.
Chief among its critics is Geoff Law, of Tasmania's Wilderness Society. It is,
he says, ``number one among Australia's destroyers of old growth forests''.
Bellamy says he is appalled at the decision to appoint Bills to the sensitive
forestry post: ``The only good thing about it is to get him off the backs of
forests in Australia, but it can't be any good for us.''
Strong words from a man who has been at the forefront of support for the
Forestry Commission's championing of multi-purpose forestry, which he says,
leads the world.
Much of the environmentalists' concern is that the commission's policy, under
which woodlands are managed to yield not just economic but environmental and
social values, will now shift towards commercial objectives.
Martin Mather of the World-Wide Fund for Nature in Scotland said: ``We will be
looking very quickly for Mr Bills to show that the leopard can change its
spots. He won't be in for an easy time.''
Friends of the Earth's habitats campaigner, Tony Juniper, said his
organisation's dismay stemmed from the appointment of someone with a background
in the resource exploitation sector: ``Especially when he is entering an
institution which, we are told, is going into a new phase of enlightenment,
encouraging the social value of forestry. He comes from the old
log-it-and-build-approach to forestry.''
When Bills's appointment was announced, the chairman of the Forestry
Commission, Sir Peter Hutchison, said he came with an impressive reputation as
manager of a large forestry operation supplying timber to Australian and
international markets. He was confident Bills would steer the commission's
future in line with government policies to manage forests in a sustainable way.
Bills began his forestry career as a scientist at the Australian Forest
Research Institute. Educated at the University of Tasmania, where he got a BSc
in forestry, he undertook forestry research in Norway for a time and studied at
the management school in Massachusetts.
In an article in industry magazine, Forestry &amp; British Timber, Bills answered
criticism by acknowledging that issues of old growth and wilderness value had
been debated passionately in Australia. But the debate there was different to
that in the UK, he said.
In Australia, a large component of the industry was still dependent upon native
or natural eucalyptus forests. The debate there was over whether or not to
harvest, rather than in the UK where issues of access, forest design and how to
harvest are more prominent.
He believed he had been a voice of reason in the debate and had a positive
influence in achieving some compromises in difficult circumstances: ``I have
had the opportunity to learn of the importance of the UK's remaining native
woodlands and from a personal and professional viewpoint cannot think of any
circumstances which would cause me to advocate, or even support, a change in
current UK policy towards these forests.''

THE man appointed director general of the Forestry Commission was a figure of
controversy among environmentalists who campaigned against the destruction of
rain forests in Tasmania.
Mr David Bills, who takes up his post on December 4, was general manager of
North Forest Products Ltd, which became the focus for protests over its plans
to fell virgin forests on the island.
Concern at the threat to the ancient forests sparked international protests.
Campaigners eventually had one of the areas at the centre of the dispute
designated a UN World Heritage Site.
Mr Bills also clashed with environmentalists, notably the World Wide Fund for
Nature, in his role as spokesman for the Australian forestry and timber
industry.
He was a vociferous campaigner, as president of the National Association of
Forest Industries, against a WWF scheme to bring consumer power to bear by
encouraging forestry owners and timber producers to have independent vetting of
management standards.
The environmentalists' concerns centre on Mr Bills's commercial background. It
is feared that the social and environmental aspects of forestry in the UK will
be lost in the race for profits.
The loudest criticism of the appointment has come from broadcaster and
environmental campaigner David Bellamy, who has led environmental protests to
protect the Tasmanian wilderness and its rainforests for more than a decade.
``It is horrendous that the powers-that-be have appointed him. What the devil
did we do to get someone like this in the world's leading forest service?''
Professor Bellamy warned: ``I hope the conservation movement will be able to
work with him to show what the benefits of multi-purpose forestry are on our
overcrowded island, or he will be up against some of the longest picket lines
the world has ever seen.''
When Mr Bills's appointment was announced by the Forestry Commission in
September, he was quoted as foreseeing an exciting economic future for the
forest industry in Britain.
His priority, he stressed, would be to develop focus and processes to ensure
commercial outcomes in line with Government expectations.
A spokesman for the Forestry Commission yesterday said it was unfair to
criticise a man who had not yet arrived to start the job.
Mr Bills, he said, had made his reputation for calm and successful dealings
with high-profile environmental issues in both Australia and Tasmania.

GUERRILLAS holding two Britons and two other Westerners hostage in Kashmir said
today one of the captives could die ``any time'' and urged his relatives to go
to the Himalayan region as soon as possible, the Press Trust of India reported.
The news agency said Al-Faran militants did not name the ailing hostage. The
militants released the statement in Srinagar, the summer capital of India's
Jammu and Kashmir state.
Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells have been held hostage in the mountains of
Kashmir for four months by extremists fighting for independence from India.
Al-Faran said the condition of the ailing hostage had deteriorated since
Tuesday, when it released a statement saying he was ``struggling for life''.
The shadowy guerrilla group said the Indian Government had been told about the
hostage's condition but was not interested in his recovery and would be held
responsible if he died.
American Donald Hutchings, German Dirk Hasert, and the two Britons were
kidnapped in early July.
Officials have said Hutchings was believed to be in poor condition, suffering
from chilblains and other ailments.-Reuter

THERE are perhaps four things you should know about Sharon Stone before
dismissing her as a Hollywood publicity monster who shows rather too much skin
to be taken seriously.
The first is that in 1980, director Woody Allen cast her as his fantasy woman
in his black and white film Stardust Memories - her movie debut. It makes one
snigger now, but: ``I looked at her and thought I would really like her to kiss
me!'' he is reported as saying.
Stone protested when they put her in a ``bombshell dress'' for the brief clip,
where she kisses him.
``I said: `Wait. Let me explain something - I'm not a bombshell.' They didn't
see it my way. I played Woody's fantasy. And that was the beginning of the
end.''
Ten years later she posed nude for Playboy, proving that at 32 and with a
decade of truly awful potboilers behind her there was not so much a serious
actress waiting to get out as a woman determined to get noticed.
A year later she uncrossed her legs in Basic Instinct; the Sharon Stone package
was revealed, heralding the writhing skin scenes so familiar to those of us who
have yawned our way through the ludicrous plots and moderate box office success
of The Specialist and Sliver.
And in the last two years, it has paid off; more important than taking the
leading role in The Quick and the Dead, last year's female shoot-em-up cowboy
movie, she was the co-producer and chose the director.
This year she finished shooting Casino, playing mobster Robert de Niro's
unfaithful wife. Martin Scorsese, the director's director, chose her for the
role, which is perhaps the only really important thing you need to know about
Sharon Stone at all; as part of Hollywood's elite, she is all future, and the
past doesn't figure at all.
Not that the past necessarily bothers her. She is variously reported as saying
in Basic Ambition, a new biography by journalist Douglas Thompson out this
month:
On the 10-page Playboy spread: ``One, I wanted to be seen. Leading ladies my
age are typed and you need to be sexually appealing for parts in the movies you
might be right for. It's a man's world and when you look like I look, that's
what it is.''
On Basic Instinct: ``Once I realised that was what the guys wanted, I thought:
`Oh, I get it. No matter how he touches her or where he touches her or what
else he does to her, it`s the most, it's the best, it's the sexiest'.''
On Sharon Stone: ``My image is manufactured from very little . . . I realised I
could create an event - this more attractive woman.'' She has maintained she
was ``betrayed'' on the Basic Instinct interrogation scene by director Paul
Verhoeven, who told her to take off her white knickers because they were
reflecting the light, assuring her the shadows were too dark to show anything
very significant. She has subsequently vetted all nude scenes before release.
And Stone and her fans drearily insist that the part of sex killer Catherine
Tramell in Basic Instinct changed Hollywood values for good. This, remember, is
the movie that gave us perhaps the most offensive line in film history: ``I
think she's the f*** of the century.''
``So many female characters are written the way men experience women or would
like to experience women. But that's not the way women really are . . . I think
Basic Instinct showed both men and women in the trenches pitted against one
another,'' says Stone. It is true that Tramell more than matched Michael
Douglas's testosterone-stuffed detective Nick Curran, unlike the sad obsessive
played by Glenn Close in his previous rip-em-off movie Fatal Attraction, but
Stone claims too much here; what is ``the f*** of the century'' but Woody
Allen's dream girl made flesh?
Stone's movies have almost all been written, directed and produced by men, and
until The Quick and the Dead (with the possible exception of Sliver) she has
never carried the film; her role was the main character's love interest.
So forget about the films, which ain't going to change anything; concentrate on
what she does with her stardom.
Vicki Patterson, assistant education officer at the Edinburgh Filmhouse, says:
``She is a phenomenon, and she is interesting; she has created controversy, and
she is determined - I admire her for getting in a position where she
co-financed The Quick and the Dead; it is unusual, especially for women, who
are constantly fighting among themselves for a decreasing number of parts. It
takes guts to put one's reputation on the line.''
Thompson's biography has the precocious Stone telling schoolfriends in rural
Pennsylvania that she would be the new Marilyn Monroe. She escaped home via
modelling, and then to Hollywood, where she appeared in slasher flicks (Deadly
Blessing), creaking adventure pictures (King Solomon's Mines, Allan Quartermain
and the Lost City of Gold), and the execrable Police Academy 4 before losing a
truly career-sapping bad perm and hitting the big time as Arnold
Schwarzenegger's wife in Total Recall in 1990.
The recurring word in interviews is control. On the way she has ditched a
husband and a long-term lover - both film producers - at least two agents, had
a Hello! at home shoot (which caused controversy when it was divulged she had
borrowed someone else's home to do it with), gained a lover 10 years younger
than herself and, most recently, been awarded France's highest mark of esteem
in the arts - the Chevalier of Arts.
Patterson says: ``If Casino goes well that will improve her record at the box
office and guarantee her work in the future.
``Hopefully, she is going to continue to get involved in production. It will
mean more roles for women and better roles and hopefully they can perhaps
champion directors of their choice, maybe directors who are a lot more
sympathetic to female roles.
``I think we should take her seriously, and the French obviously do. Maybe
we're missing something.''
She began as little more than a twinkle in Woody Allen's eye and her image is
manufactured from very little. Even the star herself admits to that. So why,
asks Jane Scott , is Sharon Stone such a highly-marketable phenomenon?

James Harold Large, evangelist; born June 26, 1903, died November 11, 1995
THE evangelist and Bible teacher James Large has died at the age of 92. Though
not a Scot, he had latterly pursued his religious calling in Scotland, and had
lived for 13 or 14 years in Auchlochan House retirement home, Lesmahagow, a
community for evangelicals of every persuasion.
Mr Large started his career as an insurance clerk and became a insurance claims
inspector in Cardiff.
After he experienced a call to be a missionary in his late twenties, he devoted
his subsequent life to this. He belonged to the Open Brethren and worked,
without payment, in the thirties and forties, travelling in a tent or caravan
and conducting services in rural Devon. In this he had the enthusiastic support
of his wife, Hilda. His son recalls that when the last penny went, he would say
that God would provide - and indeed there was always money in the post the next
day.
Later, he served the dozens of Open Brethren chapels in north Devon into the
postwar period. He then performed the same functions in south Devon and Dorset
before moving to north, then east, London. During his London years he did a
great deal of Bible teaching at Open Brethren meetings.
After the war he also assumed a wider role, travelling the country as an
itinerant Bible teacher. He was one of the editors of the magazine Precious
Seed and was also the author of several books on religious subjects. He became
very well known in Scotland in religious circles through conferences. As a
teacher, he had the reputation for dealing with profound matters in very simple
terms.
As far as his Scottish years are concerned, he had a roving commission through
the country, teaching and holding Bible study meetings. Eventually in his later
days he restricted his travels to the Hamilton, Glasgow, and Edinburgh areas.
His old friend Mr Stewart Brown, of Auchlochan, says of Mr Large that ``he
certainly had an aura, a presence. He was a very dignified, unassuming man.''
Mr Large leaves a son, Peter, a former journalist with the Guardian newspaper.

Arthur Thomas John Maclagan, laywer; born on January 6, 1906, died November 15,
1995
BUTE lawyer Arthur Thomas John Maclagan was educated at Edinburgh University
where he studied law, but a break to serve in the Far East with the Malaysia
Defence Force between 1926-36 saw him return to complete his studies at Glasgow
University.
He joined his father's firm of solicitors, MacBeth and Maclagan, in Rothesay in
1937 but had practised for only 18 months before he was called to serve his
country, yet again.
During the Second World War, he reached the rank of major, commanding the 2nd
Bute Battery and served as Military Registrar at Stracathro near Brechin. He
was posted to active duty in India and Malaysia. On being demobbed in 1947 he
rejoined the family practice, which has now served the people of Bute for more
than 140 years.
He was also an Hononary Sheriff of North Strathclyde and served as secretary to
the board of management of the Bute and Cumbraes Hospital.
Mr Maclagan, who will be fondly remembered by those in the legal profession,
retired from his law practice in 1974 at the age of 68. He was followed into
the firm by his son Ian who joined the practice in 1968.
A true Brandane (one born on Bute), Mr Maclagan was an active member of
Rothesay High Kirk where he was an elder and session clerk for many years. He
played an active role in the church and in the Bute community.
Mr Maclagan's wife Margaret died in 1982. He is survived by sons Donald and Ian
and three grandchildren.

FOR a man desperately in need of a fillip, it was a triumph. On Wednesday,
Prime Minister Alain Jupp outlined in the National Assembly the first thorough
overhaul of France's welfare system in its 50-year history, and one that even
cautious observers have qualified as a ``revolution''.
The Premier's speech, well modelled and passionately delivered, had all the
conservative politicians in the House - that is to say the immense majority of
them - on their feet and applauding.
Earlier carping by friends of President's Chirac's right-wing election rival,
Edouard Balladur, failed to turn into anything resembling serious criticism,
and Mr Jupp had his day.
A predominant feeling among many politicians was one of relief at seeing the
Government daring at last to grasp the nettle of a debt-ridden system.
The deficit of national welfare accumulated since 1992 is #80 billion, a
staggering sum which has led to all sorts of recent alarmist rumours about the
collapse, among other things, of the pension system.
At the expense of going back yet again on a major Chirac promise not to raise
taxes, Mr Jupp has described the means both to mop up the overdraft and
restrict spending, reducing next year's deficit, for example, from an estimated
#8000m to #2000m.
Mr Jupp's plan is the nineteenth in the past 20 years. But all his supporters
agree that this one will work.
Its great virtue is that of imposing sacrifices on everybody. Tax on income as
a whole will be raised by 0.5% for a period of 13 years, deemed necessary to
absorb the overall deficit.
A special welfare system tax on wages, CSG, introduced by the socialists in
1991 and fiercely criticised by Mr Jupp himself then and later, will be
extended to all incomes, to bring in an extra #3000m a year.
An additional and very similar tax, called the RDS (Reimbursement of the Social
Debt), will be introduced on virtually all incomes, including pensions.
Civil servants will have to contribute for 40 years, like people in the private
sector, instead of 37, to qualify for a full pension.
Family allowances will become taxable in 1997.
Pensioners and people on unemployment benefit will pay higher health
contributions.
Medical fees are to be frozen for a year and the increase in hospital spending
restricted to 2.1% in 1996, the expected rate of inflation. And so on.
Mr Jupp's research, nothing if not thorough, even takes into account the
reduction of maternity leave payment, from 106% of salary to a more sensible
round figure of 100%.
The reform of pensions, first mooted by the Government's very liberal Minister
of Economics, Alain Madelin, sacked two months ago for stepping out of line on
policy, has particularly angered Civil Service unions.
Placed before the fait accompli instead of being consulted as they had hoped,
they have called for a general strike next Friday.
Another stoppage, to protest at the whole of the reforms, is being organised by
other unions, excepting the socialist-leaning CFDT, on November 28.
But what had the unions almost voiceless with rage was Mr Jupp's plan to put
health care under direct control of Parliament.
For with all their #240 billion annual budgets France's health, pension, and
family allowance schemes are run by bodies independent of direct parliamentary
control in which trade unions, and especially Force Ouvriere, play a major role.
The make-up of the administrative boards in charge of various welfare
departments will now be modified, tipping the balance more in favour of
management and government representatives.
For Louis Viannet, general secretary of the communist-sympathising CGT union,
the Jupp scheme is ``a veritable plan of devastation.
``No Government in 30 years has gone so far in its aggression against our
system of social protection and setting up of medical rationing,'' he said.
In the opinion of Force Ouvreire the Government has simply seized control of
the welfare system with a view to privatising it in the long term. The
management union, the CNPF, just like Mr Jupp's political colleagues, approved
the plan unreservidly.

85-year-old nun said victims would get ``much needed'' love at her centre
devoted to women and children.

LABOUR MP Helen Liddell said yesterday that accusations about Monklands members
running a ``jobs for the boys'' council were a daily complaint from her
constituents.
She said she had no concrete evidence to give day five of the statutory inquiry
in Coatbridge into the allegations.
The Monklands East MP said she was well aware of complaints that council jobs
were being found by councillors for their relatives or friends.
She said: ``That is repeated in various hostelries in Monklands, where it's
said so and so can get you a job on the council because so and so drinks at
such and such a bar. But they are never referred to by name.
``Seldom a day passes that complaints on this issue are not made by my
constituents. They allege not only nepotism but also cronyism.''
She told the inquiry chairman, Mr William Nimmo-Smith, QC, that she was unsure
how much of that was fired by constant rumours and speculation.
She told him that Monklands was not a homogenous community but a marriage of
the two former independent town council areas of Airdrie and Coatbridge.
She said: ``That was not a marriage made in heaven. There have been accusations
on council conduct since the reform of local government in 1975.''
She said she welcomed the inquiry - and so would have the late Labour leader
John Smith she said - because it gave the chance once and for all for those
with evidence of corruption to speak out.
Mrs Liddell hit out at former Scottish Local Government Minister Allan Stewart
for suggesting during campaigning in the 1994 Monklands East by-election that
sectarianism played a part in the running of the council.
She said she had demanded Mr Stewart and the Secretary of State for Scotland
hold an inquiry into allegations against Monklands.
On religious bias in council jobs, she said she could find no evidence. She
said it was ``insensitive and not well advised'' for the council to ask job
applicants to specify their Christian religion in an Equal Opportunities form -
even if that was a voluntary form.
On whether membership of the Labour Party played an influential part in getting
a job, Mrs Liddell said: ``I have nothing to suggest it is true but nothing to
suggest it is not true.''
Meanwhile, a decision by two Monklands councillors to give a pay rise to the
son of Labour group leader Jim Brooks came under fire yesterday from party
chief Jack McConnell.
Mr McConnell, 35, Scots general secretary, told the inquiry that their decision
was just not sensible. He told Mr William Nimmo-Smith this was the only
incident in the past 18 months that had concerned him at Monklands.
He was referring back to the changes in job interview procedures implemented at
the council following an internal Labour party committee in 1992.
That led to the abolition of the staffing rota committee, where between four
and six councillors interviewed all job applicants.
Asked by Mr Nimmo-Smith if there was anything since then that concerned the
Scottish Labour party, Mr McConnell referred to the upgrading of Mr Stephen
Brooks.
The inquiry had heard earlier in the week how councillors Betty Leitch and Hugh
Lucas had upgraded Mr Brooks against the recommendations of officials.
Mr McConnell said: ``It was not sensible for them to do that.''
He said all local authorities should be careful about becoming involved in
staff regrading and that it was better left to officials.
He said it was obvious in any analysis of what happened at Monklands that the
two councillors knew exactly who they were upgrading.
Even if they were technically correct the public perception might be different.

SANDY SMITH of Millhousebridge, Lockerbie, raises the question of BBC2 Scotland
transmission coverage in the South-west (November 14). I will try to clarify
the matter.
BBC2 Scotland was extended to serve the South-west in April 1992, from the
Sandale transmitter in Cumbria. The 15 relay stations in the South-west were
converted to radiate BBC2 at the same time. However, when we came to plan the
service it became clear that there was a significant shortage of clear
television channels which could be used without causing interference.
As a result it was necessary to restrict the power of the new BBC2 service to
20kW (compared with the 500kW of the existing services). In addition, it was
necessary to transmit on Channel 67, which is at the other end of the TV band
from the existing services.
The BBC could not influence either the channel or power allocation and we
implemented the only technical solution available.
We were aware that the higher channel and lower power would cause difficulty
and that viewers who received their signals from the main stations in Cumbria
would require to make alterations to their aerial systems or install additional
aerials to receive the signal either from Sandale or from one of the relays.
Some people, however, have not made adequate alterations. We are more than
willing to provide advice to viewers on the best way to receive a BBC2 Scotland
signal. In addition we will be glad to talk further to people at a public
screening of the Lockerbie programme, America's Memorial to Lockerbie on
November 28 at 7pm in Lockerbie Town Hall. Furthermore, the programme will be
transmitted on BBC1 on the anniversary of the disaster on December 21.

FOR the precise details of John Major's latest attempt to appease home rule
sentiment in Scotland, we must await Michael Forsyth's St Andrew's Day lecture.
Given the tinkering with the functions of the Scottish Grand Committee which
was the main fruit of Taking Stock phase one, it is hard to see what further
procedural innovations, within the conventions of Westminster, can ignite
Scottish opinion and quench the majority desire in Scotland for some measure of
home rule. The one significant move left in that gambit is to give the Grand
Committee untrammelled voting powers over purely Scottish legislation. But, as
Ian Lang told The Herald in January, ``the Government has to be able to command
a majority for its legislation, otherwise Parliament cannot operate''. To give
the Scottish Grand Committee the power to vote on the principle of Scottish
Bills at second reading would ensure that the legislation on vouchers for
nursery education, promised in this week's Queen's Speech, would never see the
light of day.
We cannot believe that Mr Forsyth, even in his emollient, listening mode, has
gone soft and persuaded the Prime Minister to go down that revisionist road. So
we must assume that the bold new package being trailed yesterday will look a
lot less impressive when the Scottish Secretary finally gets up to deliver his
Dick Stewart Memorial Lecture. There could be voting, of course. But subject to
the Grand Committee being made less Scottish, and packed with the Tory payroll
vote. Or votes in Edinburgh or wherever could be subject to confirmation by
votes of all MPs back in Westminster. But none of that would take us much
further forward than we were, a year ago, when the Grand Committee met in
Edinburgh to debate the second reading of the Children (Scotland) Bill or when
it met, in chaotic circumstances in Westminster for the first time this
February, for a new-style question time and debate session. We were told, in
his interview in The Independent yesterday, that the Prime Minister now
understands why most Scots feel cut off from centralised Westminster power. Mr
Major was in Scotland when the Constitutional Convention published its detailed
plans for a parliament in Edinburgh. The Prime Minister rejects the whole
premise of these plans but, to his credit, recognises that the document marked
a very important stage in the constitutional debate north of the Border. Yet,
as he puts it himself: ``The London press virtually failed to cover it.'' But,
while the Prime Minister says he understands Scotland's sense of alienation in
an intensely metropolitan United Kingdom, he is powerless to deliver the very
thing which would assuage that feeling: a forum which delivers to Scots the
policies and programmes most of them vote for at the ballot box.
He says a separate Scottish nation is perfectly credible. And as a statement of
fact that is perfectly true. Like Finland, Estonia, or Luxembourg, an
independent Scotland could stand on its own. But, to date, only a minority of
Scots and an even smaller minority of MPs want that to happen. Most Scots, and
the vast majority of Scottish MPs, still subscribe to UK membership but want a
parliament in Edinburgh to decide Scottish priorities on the issues which
affect their daily lives. There is evidence - despite what looks like a badly
botched Scottish Chambers of Commerce survey, which didn't even get round to
asking members their own constitutional preferences - that business opinion is
less hostile to home rule than it was in 1979. Perhaps Mr Forsyth will surprise
us. But if he unwraps another tartan mouse on November 30, there will be
nowhere left to hide.

PHOTOGRAPHS of the appalling condition of schools at Lochaber and Portree
clearly show a failure to maintain these buildings properly. It may no doubt be
convenient to say that the buildings have been found out by the flat roofs and
80 inches of rain per year, but the reality is that the buildings display no
signs of regular maintenance.
Statistically, those in charge of public buildings own motor cars, which they
have serviced at regular intervals. Perhaps there should be a similar test for
buildings.

READERS of The Glasgow Herald in November 1833 were summoned to a ``Grand
Bazaar in aid of liquidation of debt and erection of spire of St Mary's Church,
Great Western Road, Glasgow''.
And as the church magazine later reported, despite ``terribly unpropitious''
weather on the opening day, the event was ``a decided success''. There had been
misgivings that few would attend beyond the congregation and their immediate
circle but on the day a large crowd flocked to the Victoria Halls in West
Regent Street to browse at Lady Campbell's silver stall, purchase raffle
tickets for a silver-plated tricycle, and fall victim ``to the grosser
attractions of Mrs Richardson's plump pheasants and excellent mince pies''.
The event raised #2200, which ``happily annihilated'' the debt and presumably
allowed the erection to go ahead as well, as Gilbert Scott's massive spire
still dominates the eastern end of Great Western Road.
Next Friday and Saturday, exactly 112 years later, supporters of St Mary's (now
St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral), hope to recreate the atmosphere of the original
event at a Grand Victorian Bazaar in Glasgow City Chambers. The ravages of time
and the weather have necessitated a major renovation programme for the
cathedral and its Synod Hall, both Grade A listed buildings. Alas, the Countess
of Aberdeen and Mrs Richardson won't be there to peddle their silver and
pheasants. In their place you can expect a range of stalls including crafts,
hampers, gifts, and Victoriana.
Back in 1883 we are told Captain Savage, with an upmarket-sounding backing
group, entertained the crowd while Punch ``apostrophised (sic) his undutiful
Judy'' for the children. Next week their places will be taken by the Cathedral
Singers, a Barber Shop quintet, and Bella McNab's Ceilidh Band.
On Friday you are invited to rifle your attic for suitable garb for a ``Parlour
and Promenade'' Victorian entertainment. There's also an exhibition about
Victorian life in Glasgow.
The target this time is, well, something rather in excess of #2200. So roll up,
roll up.
n.Grand Victorian Bazaar at Glasgow City Chambers. Friday, November 24: Bazaar,
noon to 5pm; Victorian entertainment, 7.30pm. Saturday, November 25: Bazaar,
10am to 3.30pm; Ceilidh, 7.30pm. Contact Pippy McEwan, 0141 649 1537.

A SEX attacker who pounced on a six-months pregnant woman in a late-night
attack was jailed for three years at the High Court in Edinburgh, yesterday.
The victim was saved after her five-year-old niece told a passer-by: ``Someone
is raping my auntie.'' Mr Colin Anderson chased George Brown, 24, and held him
until police arrived.
Brown, of Restalrig Road, Edinburgh, admitted indecently assaulting the
20-year-old woman and threatening her niece with violence on June 29 this year,
at a footpath on Leith Links.
He was originally charged with attempted rape but the Crown accepted his not
guilty plea to that part of the charge.
Lord Clyde was told the woman was taking a shortcut across the park with her
niece about 11.30pm, after visiting a friend. She became aware of footsteps and
realised a man was following her.
Brown grabbed her from behind, put his hands over her mouth, and forced her to
the ground, repeatedly shouting: ``I want to make love to you.''
The screaming woman was repeatedly punched on the face and warned to stop
calling out but she managed to tell her distressed niece to run for help.
Brown got on top of the woman and tried to make her perform a sex act. She kept
telling him that she was six months pregnant but he appeared not to care. He
opened her clothing but when he realised that Mr Anderson was arriving on the
scene, tried to escape.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, urged Lord Clyde to place Brown, who suffers
from a mental handicap, on probation on condition that he sought treatment.
However, the judge, who had deferred sentence for reports, rejected that option.

IN politics the end often, although not always, justifies the means. The
release yesterday under the 1995 Northern Ireland Remission of Sentences Act
from Northern Ireland jails of 83 Republican and Loyalist prisoners is a case
in point. The means are legal, the release an attempt by the Government to inch
the stalled peace process, which needs all the encouragement it can get, a
little further along the road towards a settlement. It is an end everyone prays
will be achieved, and for that reason, because they should help, we welcome the
releases. As Mr Joe Hendron of the nationalist SDLP said, the important thing
was to show generosity to prisoners from both communities so that the all-party
talks could be started as soon as possible. That generosity was shown, those
released being more or less equally divided between the Republican and Loyalist
factions.
The Government's action is not, as Sinn Fein said, derisory. Nor are there
grounds at the moment for the immediate release of all so-called political
prisoners, as it demanded. It is not ``too little too late,'' as one of the
released prisoners claimed, but a first step towards the eventual release of
more prisoners. Mrs Sandra Peacock, the widow of the prison officer murdered
two years ago by Loyalists, who called the Government's action a disgrace,
deserves every sympathy. Like many before her, and it is no comfort for her, or
others like her, she is the victim of real politik. Her anger, and the anger of
all who have suffered from the actions of terrorists on both sides at seeing
men go free whom they perceive to be guilty in general, and know in some cases
were responsible for the hurt they suffered, is understandable. But that is
life. To reach a peace settlement in Cyprus and Rhodesia, to mention only two
instances, the British Governments of the day had to negotiate with people
branded as terrorists, some with blood on their hands, many of whom went on to
become respected Commonwealth statesmen, men of violence transformed into men
of peace. We must hope that is happening today in Northern Ireland.
The 1995 Act does not apply to those serving life sentences and if the peace
process shows signs of succeeding there will be a case for reviewing their
situation because one should never say never in politics. Yesterday's releases
are only the first in a phased programme and more will follow next year and the
year after that. The hope is they will contribute to recreating normality in
Northern Ireland, although the latest punishment beatings and abductions
carried out by the IRA do not help. All the same, there are once again some
grounds for optimism, although they could disappear at any moment as has
happened so often before. The differences between the Prime Minister and the
Taoiseach, Mr John Bruton, which surfaced while Mr Major was at the
Commonwealth Conference in New Zealand, have thankfully been resolved and the
much delayed Anglo-Irish summit, which should have been held in September, is
back on the ``coming-shortly'' agenda.
The squabble with Dublin erupted after Mr Bruton effectively accused Britain of
foot dragging on the arms issue last weekend. Once back in London Mr Major
wrote to him setting out the British position. The last thing either Government
wanted was for the long-distance slanging match between the two men to gather
momentum hence his clarifications. Dublin indicated it was satisfied that Mr
Major's letter meant the twin-track procedure, under which preliminary talks
take place alongside the commission which will look at disarming the
para-militaries, could be achieved. The Prime Minister sent a second letter to
Mr Bruton on Thursday, will be writing to him again this weekend and, it is
said, discussing their contents with the Taoiseach on the telephone next week.
The peace process may no longer stick in the mud.

THE American tobacco industry, which has used its enormous legal war chest to
win most lawsuits on smoking issues, has begun to use the threat of litigation
to undermine controversial news reports as well, lawyers say.
They warn the chilling effect from this threat has spread to medium-size and
smaller news organisations that are afraid to run sensitive stories because
they risk millions of dollars in legal fees.
``This is driven by the financial bottom line,'' said Bruce Ennis, a prominent
First Amendment lawyer in the Washington office of Jenner and Block.
``Regardless of who is likely to win or lose, the enormous expense of defending
suits is exerting a chilling effect on journalists and the media.''
Last Sunday, Mike Wallace, the veteran correspondent for the CBS news programme
60 Minutes, informed viewers that an interview with a former tobacco executive
criticising the industry was cut because lawyers feared an expensive lawsuit.
The programme has been widely criticised for ``caving in'' to the tobacco
industry even though no suit was threatened. But several newspapers reported
CBS had good reason to fear a suit because agreements it made with the unnamed
source exposed the show to legal liability.
A spokesman for 60 Minutes would not comment.
Experts familiar with press issues say the current climate, while tough for the
titans of communications, is even worse for small news outlets.
``If big news organisations are not prepared to take the risk to defend
themselves . . . why in the world would a much smaller organisation with much
fewer resources take the risk?'' said Jane Kirtley, executive director of
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.
The committee counsels journalists on legal issues, and Kirtley said there had
been a sharp rise in the number of calls from reporters fearing their stories
would be killed by their own lawyers because of fear of legal action.
Free-press advocates say these pressures have come even when no legal action
was threatened by the subjects of such stories.
The CBS action follows ABC's decision in August to settle a $10 billion libel
suit brought by Philip Morris over a story about nicotine addiction. Legal
sources said ABC paid some $15m to cover Philip Morris's legal fees.
``I see this as a related series of events and the weakening of the will of the
owners and the executives of news organisations to go to the wall for the right
of journalists to prove the truth,'' said Joan Konner, dean of Columbia
University's Graduate School of Journalism.
Steve Weinberg, former executive director of the group Investigative Reporters
and Editors, said self-censorship was growing as news organisations were
purchased by other entities.
The 60 Minutes decision was announced a week before CBS stockholders approved a
$5400m takeover by Westinghouse Electric Corp. ABC settled its suit shortly
after an announced takeover by Walt Disney Co, but both networks denied any
link.-Reuter

AGAINST all odds, and at great personal risk, young - puerile-sounding anyway -
intrepid Ed Marriot, hearing of a lost tribe in a hugely inaccessible part of
Papua New Guinea, decides to go meet the Liawep people who live on the mountain
they worship as their god.
Nobody wants to help him and anthropologists try to dissuade him, gently at
first and then they come clean and suggest that he is nuts and liable to be
eaten. But does he listen? Not Ed. I must come clean myself here because when I
started listening to Our Father the Mountain (R4) I stopped the tape and gave
myself a little talking to. It went like this.
``Critic, put aside your prejudices about that voice. Remember that your
dislike of that kind of voice - no, that character-voice - has been recently
activated by last night's viewing of Four Weddings and a Funeral. Just because
he sounds like Hugh Grant in the jungle (I mean, of course, the Grant persona,
all terribly gosh and upper-class tic) does not mean the result of Ed's awfully
big adventure will be risible, deeply patronising and rather sick. You don't
yet know if it will be Numpty gets Pretty Scared in Bongo Land.'' So I deleted
my bias and rewound.
First of all we had to hear about the drugs and jags he needed to make his
actually illegal journey into primitivism. He is warned about the fatal bite of
some bug or snake (I'm sorry, I was laughing a bit here but it was one or the
other) he might encounter. A female bite of the species would be fatal, so he
asks how he is meant to tell the difference. Things were getting complicated
for Ed and he hadn't even reached the mountain yet.
With his guide Dunstan, Ed reaches the tribe, some of whom immediately scatter
into the nearest bit of denser jungle. Ed notes and ponders this. Things get
worse, and with an analytic grasp of the situation he says it's ``because I'm
basically here, isn't it?''
Yes, I murmured, yes! And as if he had heard me, Ed went on to describe how
suggestions had been made that there might be something colonialist and dubious
about going into a place he had no idea about, with no ideas whatsoever. The
head of the tribe was called Herod and not unsurprisingly, given his name, was
pretty het up about Christianity, de-manding that Ed profess his faith. Well,
he did this pretty reluctantly, he admitted, but you see, he didn't want to
offend, did he?
Herod was getting pretty hostile by this time but I suppose, not having seen
Four Weddings, he probably didn't get the joke. In the middle of this
tragi-comic nightmare, with lots of noise in the background, our reporter
whispers to Dunstan: ``Would it help if I came round to say hello?'' No, I
shouted, but this time he did not seem to hear me because things, astoundingly
in the face of his anthropological sensitivity, got worse.
The mountain got angry, Herod threw a fit, and four children died. Dunstan
rushed into Ed's room suggesting they better get out of there fast. Very fast,
so fast, in fact, that Ed fascinatingly cogitated on the fact that it had taken
them five days to get there, but only three days to get back.
Then once he had got his breath back, and explaining to us that it would have
been inopportune to hang around talking to his little machine in the middle of
the mayhem, Ed finished off his extraordinary contribution to global knowledge
by telling a little garbled nugget which involved 7th Day Adventists and gold
consortiums.
There is certainly a story to be told there, but next time I know exactly who
the producer should send. It came to me while listening to Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes (R4). Lorelei was given a diary; she was confused at first, because it
was a book without words, but once she grasped the diary concept, she warmed to
the idea - although she wondered, given that she thought all the time, how many
books she would need.
I still think that if Radio 4 had given her a cute little recording machine,
like they had given to Ed, she would have produced a better programme, and hit
it off with Herod.

Lt-Col P S Sandilands, DSO RSF, born November 1911, died August 29, 1995.
LT-COL Pat Sandilands - who was awarded a DSO in 1945 when serving with the 2nd
Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers - has died after several months of illness.
The son of of Col Prescott Sandilands, Royal Marines, Pat Sandilands was
educated at Wellington and Sandhurst and was commissioned in August 1931. His
family is descended from Sir James Sandilands, who was granted the lands of
Calder in 1346, and played a notable part in Scottish history.
In the early thirties Pat Sandilands served with the 1st Battalion the Royal
Scots Fusiliers in Palestine and Egypt, subsequently being seconded for three
years to the King's African Rifles on the Kenya/Abyssinia frontier. He rejoined
the 2nd battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers, in Edinburgh in 1938 and was with the
Royal Guard at Balmoral the following year.
He went to France in 1939, but was recalled to England to attend the Staff
College, Camberley. Subsequently he held various jobs with the Home Forces.
These included planning ``butcher and bolt'' raids on the Continent with HQ 110
Force in Glasgow.
From November 1942 to May 1943 Sandilands was with the 1st Army in North Africa
and from June to August 1943 was a company commander with 8th Battalion, the
Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, taking part in the Sicilian campaign, where
the Argylls fought with exceptional gallantry and determination.
Pat Sandilands was second-in-command of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Scots
Fusiliers, throughout the battalion's participation in the Italian campaign,
from the landing in Calabria to the fall of Rome, and its subsequent move to
Germany.
His fellow officer David Coutts recalls: ``To serve with Pat Sandilands
throughout the Italian campaign was an object lesson in discipline, patience,
courage, and total dedication.
``His primary role as second-in-command was to preserve himself within reason
for any eventuality. But the frustrations he endured on the many occasions when
the battalion split into `forward' and `back' were understandable. Given the
slightest excuse he would appear at battalion headquarters and company
positions, keeping himself in touch and displaying encouragement and infectious
humour.
``In periods of close fighting and against a determined enemy it was
predictable that this state of readiness was crucial and in January 1944, after
the successful crossing of the River Garigliano, tragedy struck when the
commanding officer was killed and Pat wounded virtually at the same time.
``Although evacuated he refused to stay away and returned to take command in
the line. Only when the situation eased would he agree to enter hospital and
have his wounds attended to.
``Some weeks later he rejoined the battalion in Anzio and again assumed command
when the commanding officer and adjutant were wounded. The leadership he
displayed and respect he engendered carried on when the battalion moved into
north-west Europe in 1945 for the River Elbe crossing and advance to Lubeck. He
was a soldier from the topmost drawer.''
Pat Sandilands's postwar career included stints as commanding officer of 5th
(Scottish) Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, 1947-49, assistant quartermaster

THE exiled leader of the Saudi Arabian opposition said yesterday in Glasgow
that he feared the door to bloodshed had been opened in his country by Monday's
bomb near Riyadh which killed six people, including four US soldiers.
Professor Muhammad Al Massari, the leader of the Committee for the Defence of
Legitimate Rights, was speaking at the start of a UK tour which aims to expose
the regime as corrupt and hypocritical despots clinging to power.
While they as a peaceful coalition had no part in the violence, they were not
surprised by it and were sure that it would escalate.
``If you open that door to bloodshed, who is going to close it? You have to
have rational politicians and they are not allowed to do anything to solve the
current social and political crisis,'' Professor Massari said.
He was supported by Labour MP George Galloway, who has conducted a virtual
one-man crusade against the Saudi regime in the Commons.
Mr Galloway said: ``A regime which says we took this country by the sword is
inviting its opponents to put them to death by the sword.''
Professor Massari, a leading scientist, fled to Britain last year after being
imprisoned and tortured in Saudi Arabia. From his home in London, he now
bombards his native country with faxes denouncing its royal family.
It was difficult to estimate the size of the opposition in his country, he
said. ``We feel there are tens of thousands who are participating actively
against the regime while there are silent millions who are fed up with it.''
The regime, Mr Galloway said, had literally looted its own country.
``They have lifted thousands of millions out and into the casinos of London and
into investments in real estate in Manhattan. It is grand larceny on a scale
the world has never seen before. It makes Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos look like
poor people.''
He hoped that Britain would not repeat the mistakes it had made with the Shah
of Iran. By backing him when the people were already on the streets, Britain
had contributed to the alienation of the Iraqi people from all things Western.

THE Dayton conference on Bosnia is on the verge of success, or failure. The
Americans believe that they have all the details of an acceptable peace
agreement ready to be initialled this weekend, probably in the presence of
President Clinton.
The last effort to bring the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims to accept the proposal
as the best they will get will be made this evening by the Secretary of State,
Warren Christopher, who is flying back from Japan.
If all goes well, Nato will start moving headquarters staff and advance teams
into the region immediately.
The Secretary of Defence, William Perry, and the American commander of Nato,
Gen George Joulwan, went to Dayton today to oversee the last details, which
involve the exact lines on the map dividing the parties and the disposition of
the 60,000 Nato troops who will monitor the peace.
Once these matters have been settled and the agreement is initialled, the
President and his administration will try to persuade Congress that it is in
the national interest to send 20,000 American soldiers to Bosnia. It will not
be easy.
The plan is that the 1st Armoured Division, which was the backbone of the
allied forces in the Gulf war, will be sent to Bosnia. Its advanced
headquarters will be in Pecs, Hungary, and advance elements will fly there next
week.
The division will follow overland. Permission will be needed from the Czech
Republic and, perhaps, Austria, for the movement of a major American unit
across what was once the Iron Curtain.
The Serb, Croat, and Muslim leaders are being told that this is their last
chance for a settlement. If the talks fail, Bosnia would face the prospect of
another horrible winter, and possibly an immediate resumption of the war.
The State Department spokesman said this morning that the parties were still
separated on several major issues, but that the US hoped that a comprehensive
peace agreement was within reach.
Serbs and Muslims are still obdurate on the territorial issue.
Neither side will give up any land it now controls and each insists that it
must have more. The Serbs want to take possession of Gorazde, the last Muslim
town in eastern Bosnia, so that they will completely control that region which
is contiguous to Serbia itself.
They clearly hope that in a few years' time they could simply annex it. For
this very reason, the Muslims refuse to give up the town, and furthermore
demand the return of Srebrenica and Zepa, which the Serbs captured this past
summer.
In the west, the Serbs are demanding the return of some of the territory they
lost to the Croatian-Muslim offensive in September and October, while the
Croats demand a strip of territory they lost in 1992 and did not recover last
summer.
The Sarajevo question, also, is unresolved, despite Mr Christopher's best
efforts over a 14-hour session on Tuesday.
The Americans and their allies have hinted that if the two most prominent
leaders of the Bosnian Serbs, Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, retire to
Belgrade, they will not then be pursued too vigorously.
However, this clemency is not supported by the war crimes tribunal. The chief
prosecutor, Judge Richard Goldstone, was in Washington this week urging the
Americans to insist those accused of war crimes must be handed over to the
tribunal.
So far, the President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, has refused to agree
that Mladic and Karadzic must be removed from office immediately.Similarly, the
President of Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, is refusing to allow Croatians who have
been indicted to be arrested. He promoted one of them to a senior post in the
Croatian army the day after he was indicted, and so far has declined to rescind
the promotion.

SPILLERS pet food company is to shed 65 people from its 352 workforce at
Barrhead in the new year.
A spokesman for the company said the cuts were being made to give the Crossmill
factory ``a competitive edge'' to play a leading role in the company's European
network.
However, a spokesman for the shopworkers' union USDAW said the announcement had
come as a shock, as the Barrhead factory produced pet food at the most
competitive rate of all Spillers' sites.
``I understand that the redundancies will not take place until into the New
Year, but it is bad news for our members going through the festive period with
this hanging over them,'' said Mr Ian Fraser, area organiser for USDAW.
Early this year, Spillers' parent company Dalgety, which makes Arthur's,
Choosy, and Prime pet foods, bought Quaker Oats' European pet food business,
making it the second market leader in Europe behind Mar's Pedigree brand.
Mr Jon Delap, a spokesman for Spillers, said the factory would maintain its
production capacity of about 50m tins of pet food a month but would be changing
certain working practices. Factory manager Graham Martin said: ``We have a
modern factory here in Barrhead and we will maintain our existing production
capability. We are taking these steps to ensure we have the competitive edge
that is essential to our future success. All those employees who are affected
have my personal sympathy and we will provide them with a support programme,
including independent help in finding new employment.''
Spillers' has no planned job cuts for its two other factories in England or a
number of others in Europe.

<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>14</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975323194</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Episcopal Bishop of Edinburgh in his lecture at Strathclyde University
fails to distinguish between the three categories of Old Testament law - the
ceremonial, the civil, and the moral (November 15).
The ceremonial law involved Israel's worship of God. Christians are no longer
bound by the ceremonial law after Jesus's death and resurrection because Jesus
was the ultimate perfect sacrifice - the Passover Lamb who took away the sins
of the world once and for all for those who believe in Him.
The civil law applied to daily living in Israel. Because our world is so
radically different the civil law cannot be rigidly applied to our society. The
principles behind the civil law can, however, be applied today - fairness,
compassion, mercy, and justice.
Moral law, such as the Ten Commandments, is the direct command of God and
reveals the nature and will of God. It is timeless in its application.
Difficulties arise among genuine and responsible Christians when there is
confusion between the civil and the moral law.
So how do we tell what is God's moral law, and therefore immutable, and what is
civil law and therefore, in its detail, culturally based?
We have to look to Jesus because as the son of God He understands the heart and
nature of God. In Matthew 22, 37:40 Jesus said, ``Love the Lord your God with
all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first
and greatest commandment, and the second is like it: Love your neighbour as
yourself. All the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments''.
So any particular moral issue for the Christian must be judged against these
two great commandments. If a particular view or moral stance causes us to
workship something or someone (including ourselves) other than God, that is
wrong.
If it causes us to oppress, hate, ridicule, or hurt other people that is also
wrong.
How are Christians to view homosexuality by biblical standards? The Bible is
quite clear. In Leviticus 18:22 it lays down ``do not lie with a man as one
lies with a woman; that is detestable''.
It is difficult to see this as anything other than moral law rather than civil
law which is culturally based. So why would God proscribe homosexual acts?
It must be because it gets in the way between man and God and, therefore, stops
the homosexual from fully worshipping God with all his heart, soul, and mind.
But the second great commandment teaches us that we must respond to the
homosexual with love, compassion, and understanding. We are all sinners. Jesus
teaches us to hate the sin, but love the sinner.
To practising homosexuals Christ says that you are sinning, but that He loves
you and wants you to stop sinning.
In this life you are not promised that it will be easy, because God disciplines
those He loves; but you will experience real joy and fulfilment and purpose.
You will experience the love of God, which will set you free.

Tristram Jellinek, actor; born August 28, 1933, died November 4, 1995
TRISTRAM Jellinek, the actor and antique dealer, has died in London at the age
of 62. Some of his outstanding stage performances were with the Glasgow
Citizens' Theatre.
Born in London to a father of Czech origin and an English mother, he was
brought up mainly in the home counties, and after two years' service with the
RAF won a scholarship to RADA. His first jobs were in repertory in Harrogate
and Eastbourne and he later appeared in a variety of plays at Richmond,
Leatherhead, and Hornchurch, playing everything from a Japanese denizen of The
Teahouse of the August Moon to Simple Simon in Mother Goose.
In 1959 he appeared in the West End in The Visit, directed by Peter Brook, and
in 1964 in Oblomov with Spike Milligan and Joan Greenwood. Despite such
successes and regular television work, he was diverted by his early fascination
with antiques. His shop in Kensington was a favourite haunt of collectors.
His Scottish connection was through the Citizens' Theatre, for whom he played
many roles over the past nine years on his return to acting. These included the
upright but dull husband Karenin in Anna Karenina in 1987 and Pawnie in Noel
Coward's The Vortex in 1988 (this production transferred to the Garrick
Theatre, London, in 1990).
The same year he played the Chaplain in Mother Courage, with Glenda Jackson in
the title role. The following year he was Sir Anthony Absolute in the Citizens'
highly successful production of The Rivals.
His last role with the company was as the Grand Inquisitor in Don Carlos. He
appeared in this at this year's Edinburgh Festival in August and at the
Citizens' the following month. In keeping with the courage with which he faced
his last illness, he missed only two performances, playing the part till six
weeks before he died.
Giles Havergal, director of the Citizens', singles out two qualities in
Jellinek's work: ``Whether in comedy or much more serious stuff he was always
extraordinary clear; nothing was fudged. The other thing was his fantastic
timing.'' He recalls Jellinek as a great character, ``very waspish and funny,
but with a tremendously kind heart.''

THE Government sought to polarise the constitutional debate yesterday, talking
up the threat of independence while attempting to ensnare Labour in more modest
proposals involving the Scottish Grand Committee.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is seeking Labour approval for an extended
series of meetings of the Grand Committee throughout Scotland and the taking of
evidence from the public on proposed legislation, in a clear attempt to draw
attention from Opposition plans for a Scottish parliament.
Following the Prime Minister's surprising comment to a London newspaper that
``no one should doubt that Scotland could be a separate nation'', Mr Forsyth
asserted yesterday: ``There is only one party that is entitled to argue for all
decision-making to be made in Scotland and that is the SNP.''
Later, in an interview with The Herald, Mr Forsyth refused to comment on
predictions that he will strengthen the Scottish Grand Committee and enhance
the role of Scottish Questions in the Commons, but added: ``They certainly
haven't identified what I'm going to do, and some of what they've identified is
not correct.''
He said: ``I will in the next few days seek agreement from Mr Robertson for a
programme for the whole year ahead of meetings of the Scottish Grand Committee.
I will be expecting very regular meetings.''
Asked if sessions could be held in more remote parts of Scotland, Mr Forsyth
said: ``If the House authorities can find premises to meet the standards
required, and people are willing to host the Grand Committee, why shouldn't it
get round Scotland?''
Mr Forsyth wants people to know in advance where and when the committee will
sit to increase the public awareness of its activities.
While careful to avoid rebuffing this particular move, Labour made it clear
that this was not seen as heavy armour in the fight over the Scottish
Constitutional Convention's plans for a Scottish parliament, to be announced on
the same day, November 30.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson was convinced that the Prime
Minister had scored an own goal in conceding that there was a democratic
deficit. ``He is admitting that what Labour has been saying for the last 16
years, that change is needed, is absolutely correct.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond was delighted by the apparent endorsement of the
viability of his party's case by the Prime Minister, saying: ``Sooner, rather
than later, the Tory Party will have to come to terms with the fact that
Scotland requires real change in the form of an independent parliament, not
more cosmetic tinkering with the Westminster system.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said the latest stocktaking
proposals ``did not amount to a row of beans,'
' adding: ``Mr Major's ideas have no real substance and fail to address
Scotland's democratic deficit.''
Mr Forsyth's current sensitivity to the way the constitutional debate is
running was shown in two ways yesterday. He confirmed the appointment of a new
``spin doctor'' as a special adviser.
Ms Jacqui Low, head of media and communications at Scottish Tory Central Office
for the past two years, takes up her post on Monday. Political opponents argue
this appointment has blurred the distinction between Government and party
affairs.
The Scottish Office also put pressure on the Fraser of Allander Institute
yesterday to release data on a survey to be published next Tuesday of the
attitude of members of Chambers of Commerce to constitutional change.
Having received the findings, Mr Forsyth said: ``I am greatly looking forward
to Tuesday, when those who have pontificated about a survey they have not seen
will undoubtedly have egg on their faces.''
The Herald understands that the survey's findings are complex enough for
different sides to make different interpretations, but they are believed to
show a clear shift in opinion in the business community towards being less
hostile to constitutional change.
In his interview with The Herald last night, Mr Forsyth gave an indication of
how far he was prepared to go to prove that the Government listens. He
suggested he would agree to change ``radically'' legislation to licence raves
based on the views of Scotland's young people.
He denied his proposals on St Andrew's Day will amount to no more than creating
a talking shop. ``When I was appointed I made a promise to look at ways of
improving Government in Scotland, of improving accountability, of involving
people more.''
As an example of the sort of initiatives he is prepared to consider following
his consultations, Mr Forsyth cited the plan to transfer to crofters lands
owned by the Scottish Office.

YOUR news report (Dismay at Vatican ban on schools HIV pack, November 13)
showed that, even with a liberal Roman administration, the dogma of Papal
infallibility still shines through.
The Roman Catholic Church cannot and will not at any time sanction artificial
contraception, homosexual activity, abortion, or any other kind of perversity
no matter how many archbishops give their consent.
The fact that the church continues to condemn any departure from its moral
teaching, as in the case of Archbishop Keith O'Brien, at a time when it is
itself infected with liberalism enhances this dogmatic truth.
It is an article of the Catholic faith that Papal infallibility involves the
direct guidance of God, so that in pronouncing universally on matters of faith
and morals the Pope cannot err.
Archbishop O'Brien was fully aware of this when he gave his imprimatur to a sex
education pack, HIV Prevention - A Christian Response, which is opposed to the
moral teaching of the church. By doing so he helped to promote promiscuity (the
cause of HIV) thereby endangering the souls under his care.
The Vatican ordered the removal of the Archbishop's imprimatur from this
scandalous pack, as well as the removal of the pack itself from Catholic
schools. It is a pity that it did not also order the removal of the Archbishop
from his office.
Sadly, however, there are many other Catholic clerics around the world
rebelling in one form or another against the faith. Such is the price of the
ecumenical revolution of Vatican Council II.

SURELY Allan Stewart's proposal for progressing the trial of those accused of
the Pan Am/Lockerbie bomb must be considered. It is now several months since he
first stated his support for a trial in a neutral country and, given the lack
of advance since he did so, this may be the only feasible course of action.
There will be those who dismiss the suggestion of a trial outwith Scotland, the
United Kingdom, or the United States. However, I believe a trial in a neutral
country would be infinitely better than no trial at all as it seems destined to
be under the current policy.
Unless they are to be tried in a neutral country, Colonel Gaddafi is not going
to hand over the two suspects no matter how many United Nations resolutions he
is subjected to, no matter how loud the international condemnation is.
The most important concern is not where the trial takes place but that it does
take place. The murderers of the 270 must be brought to justice, a conclusion
which will be unapproachable never mind unachievable if the prime suspects'
participation is denied.

ALGERIA'S military-backed leader Liamine Zeroual was today officially declared
the outright winner of yesterday's high-security presidential election.
Zeroual, a former general who was appointed to run the wartorn country in
January 1994, won 61.34% of the vote, Interior Minister Mustapha Ben Mensour
said in the capital, Algiers.
He put the turnout at 74.92%, a figure quickly disputed by the outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front, which claimed it was really less than half that amount.
The FIS, barred from taking part in the poll, had called for a boycott and
armed Islamic groups had threatened to kill voters. But in the event the
election was generally peaceful, with an estimated 200,000 members of the
security forces on alert to guard against trouble.
The runner-up to Zeroual at once accused the authorities of rigging the result.
``Votes and ballot boxes were hijacked,'' Islamic leader Mahfoud Nahnah told
his supporters.
According to official results he took 25.38% of the votes, with anti-Islamic
candidate Said Saadi on 9.29% and a fourth candidate trailing with 3.78%.
It was the first election since late 1991 when the FIS convincingly won a first
round in parliamentary polls. The following January the Government cancelled
the second round and more than 50,000 people have since died in political
violence.
Zeroual, 54, today called the elections ``a victory to the sovereignty of the
people and true democracy in our country and a lesson to its enemies inside and
outside Algeria''.
In the streets of Algiers hundreds of his supporters waved Algerian flags and
hooted car horns. Security forces, deployed to guard voters yesterday and still
on high alert, unleashed celebratory barrages of gunfire into the air.
Zeroual, who has cracked down on Muslim rebels while trying to negotiate with
arrested fundamentalist leaders, has pledged to pursue dialogue with the
opposition and create a democracy.
Algeria's former colonial ruler France, which has been hit by a deadly wave of
bombings blamed on Algerian rebels, said it hoped Zeroual's victory would lead
to talks with the opposition and to fresh parliamentary elections.
Early reaction from exiled FIS members did not bode well.
``We still consider that an illegitimate regime is in place in Algeria,'' said
Anouar Haddam, an FIS leader living in the United States.-Reuter

WHEELCHAIR-bound Lawrence Harrison used his disability to disguise his double
life as a drug dealer. Confined to a wheelchair following a stroke, he sold
supplies of controversial temgesic tablets, Paisley Sheriff Court was told.
Fining the 62-year-old, from Greenhill Road, Ferguslie Park, #400, Sheriff
Ronald Smith said he would normally have jailed anyone concerned in supplying
others with drugs.
However, after studying social enquiry reports and a community service
assessment, he said there would be nothing to gain from sending the accused to
prison.
The sheriff had earlier heard how Harrison was found out after police saw him
acting suspiciously at the town's St James's railway station.
He was searched and found to be carrying 300 of the tablets - known to users as
Tems - in his possession.
The court was told how he regularly travelled as far afield as Liverpool and
Derry to get supplies after the painkillers - misused by addicts in the same
way as Temazepam - were outlawed.
Harrison denied being involved in the supply of the drug and claimed instead
that he was forced to find alternative supplies for his own use when doctors
refused to prescribe them.
The sheriff found him guilty after trial and, when Harrison appeared for
sentence yesterday, told him: ``It seems clear to me that you have been using
your disability as camouflage for your wicked practices. It is difficult to
accept that a person with such disabilities would visit these places on a
regular basis except for nefarious practices.''

A WIDOW has won an unfair sacking claim on behalf of her late husband.
Mr Gordon Tosh had claimed he was dismissed unfairly when he was made redundant
from his job as business development manager with a Glasgow company.
However, he died five months after he lost his job and before an industrial
tribunal heard his unfair sacking claim against Crouch Hogg Waterman Ltd of The
Octagon, Baird Street.
His widow and executrix, Mrs Maureen Tosh, continued the fight and the tribunal
in Glasgow ruled he had been unfairly dismissed and awarded #1000 compensation.
The tribunal heard Mr Tosh, 57, of Fotheringay Road, Glasgow, was made
redundant on February 1 but died in July.
The company said there was a marked downturn in business due to the recession.
There was no question of Mr Tosh's ability and it was simply a matter of the
business not being there.
They had also failed to win a major contract and decided late last year that
redundancies would have to be made but did not wish to announce these before
Christmas.
Mr Tosh was not given any warning about his redundancy until the date of his
dismissal.
The company claimed he was aware of the general adverse position of the company
but the tribunal said that was not the same thing as giving specific warning
about the possibility of his redundancy.
The tribunal heard that a redundancy letter was prepared in advance and handed
to him. While there was some discussion about his position, there seemed little
doubt that a decision had already been taken to make him redundant.
The tribunal found that there had been little, if anything, in the way of
adequate consultation and warning and ruled his dismissal was unfair because of
inadequate procedures.
However, the tribunal accepted that given the genuine redundancy situation
which existed, it was fairly clear that Mr Tosh would eventually have been
dismissed by reason of redundancy. Further warning or consultaion would have
been unlikely to have produced any different result.
The tribunal therefore awarded compensation for the likely period of
consultation and awarded #1000 compensation.

<TEXT>
THERE are a number of points arising from the article, These woods were made
for walking (November 15), which should be made to put in perspective the
concerns about restrictions on public access to woods sold by the Forestry
Commission.
The fact that in these circumstances apparently only one access agreement has
been struck with a local authority in Scotland does not in itself mean that
access will not be provided by the new owners, usually on an informal basis.
Most of the woods sold are in fact small, purely commercial plantations which
the public have shown no interest in visiting. In such cases there is not in
fact a loss of public access as a result of a sale.
It also has to be realised that these woodlands are often some distance from
the public road and as the commission's title will normally only permit access
for forestry purposes the commission does not always have the legal power to
confer a right of access to the public.
The Scottish Landowners' Federation supported the Government's policy to offer
local authorities the chance to enter into access agreements.
However, there is no doubt in my mind that the lack of interest by local
authorities in entering into access agreements for woodland demonstrates yet
again the regrettable lack of interest in this issue by local authorities
which, with honourable exceptions, do not devote nearly enough resources to an
issue which is of great significance in the countryside and are failing to
provide the benefits which the public expect.

HAVING to write this every week can really do your head in. Things get out of
hand when you end up doing things not because you enjoy them, but because it
might spin out into the right number of words. That was my excuse for going to
see the musical Fame in London's Cambridge Theatre on Saturday night.
I had to resort to subterfuge. After a while because of the abuse, I was as
vague as possible. People mocked the musical so much because their only
experience of the Fame concept is the TV series. I remember further back.
On a 1980 Glasgow Sunday night we went to see the film, not knowing a thing
about it. Alan Parker did a great job of catching a moody, backlit, and above
all realistic tale of doomed ambition and I loved every minute of it.
Unfortunately, along came the soft cream cake of a TV series, and the rest was
leotard dressed history. It ruined it all, and the word Fame was synonymous
with a crappy teen soap with a moral at the end of every episode, and a hit
record every six weeks.
Those of you who would expect the show to be nothing but a group of teenagers
singing and dancing for two hours would be wrong. It was more, actually being a
group of teenagers singing suprisingly badly. Given that they were untramelled
by anything as trifling as melody or harmony, you would think that they could
have at least managed to be loud. There are few things I can get worked up
about, the majority involving 11 men in shorts kicking a ball. I can't see the
appeal of the type of shallow tosh that forgoes any degree of character
development in order to allow, among other things, a five-minute song and dance
routine about the physical effects of male teenage lust. (Is this subtle
enough?) (Surprisingly, yes - Ed).
Watching the audience, you'd have thought they were witnessing John Lennon
duetting with Elvis. The girls next to me absolutely loved it, and they were on
their feet at the end of every song.
By the time the finale arrived (``finale''. Italian: meaning interminably
stupid song), I'd just about had enough. It was the artistic equivalent of the
car crash, and I just couldn't help watching. When a cardboard taxi is wheeled
on, even the fat baldy bloke who played the teacher had obeyed the call to
``pardy on''.
I got out quickly. It was our turn to ``pardy on''. Some stupid bugger had
decided to hire Madame Tussaud's for a party. Now I've been to a few good
nights, but I've never been to one like this. It was superb. I'd always been of
the opinion that if you've seen one stupid dummy, you've probably been watching
Late Edition, er ..... I mean, you've seen them all. I was wrong. Maybe it was
just the beer, but I was quite taken by the whole experience. It's nice to see
that Tussaud's has kept up with the times, as Mr T still figures heavily. The
Paul Daniels dummy looked like an annoying wee pratt - so it was probably an
uncanny likeness, but why anyone would want to see a wax effigy of Will
Carling, never mind Will Carling himself is beyond me.
The Chamber of Horrors is the most famous part of Tussaud's, and as the night
neared it's end I had to walk through it on my way out on my own. Some bright
spark had the idea of dressing up as Dracula so he could jump out to
``surprise'' people from the dark alleys         of the Jack the Ripper set. At
two on a Tuesday afternoon that might be amusing. At midnight on Saturday, it
somehow doesn't seem quite so clever.
The last part of the chamber was quite horrific in its ordinariness. It was a
brightly lit prison hall, with a collection of surprisingly short, bland
looking men all around, with a summary of their various crimes pinned to the
walls behind them. With the West trial proceeding, it was interesting to see
that the existence of perverts and psychopaths is not unique to the late
twentieth century. I was alone in the hall, and it was quite unnerving. The
sound of echoing warders' feet mixed with the screams from the next room. With
a shiver, I turned and hurried out.
It was almost midnight, and I had arranged to see Fred MacCaulay at The Comedy
Store late show. Fred was the night's compere, and it was a pleasure to see
him, in better form than ever, looking so at home in the best known comedy club
in Britain.
By the end of the night, I was several beers down the line, sauntering back to
the hotel in good spirits. I was glad I went to the Store, as it helped me
forget the horror of those insane bloodcurdling screams. Yup, that Fame finale
was pretty horrible.

PROPOSALS for a #17m redevelopment of the Cairngorm ski resort, including
establishment of Britain's first funicular railway, may, even now, be running
out of time for crucial funding from the European Objective One Programme,
which is not due to finish until the end of the century.
This is the fear of the Cairngorm Chairlift Company chief excutive Tim
Whittome, who had hoped to have received planning permission a year ago.
With the first real snow of the year yesterday, the company was preparing for
some serious skiing this weekend but Mr Whittome was looking further ahead, at
the timescale for the EU funding which would be a crucial, but so far
unsecured, element in the whole project.
The plans for a railway to replace the chairlift, which is more than 30 years
old, were first unveiled two and a half years ago but almost immediately ran
into opposition from environmental groups.
Now, visitor management seems to be the last outstanding issue. If the company
can persuade Scottish Natural Heritage on that issue, it might yet get planning
permission.
Mr Whittome is not sure it will be in time: ``Things are getting tight. I think
it is now impossible that there could be a decision at the December meeting of
Highland Regional Council's planning committee. We had hoped to make that.
``The committee's next meeting is in February and then we get into the
change-over at the end of March to the new Highland Council. Also in March, we
have a deadline for submissions for Objective One, for which we need planning
agreement, at least in principle. After that we would have to wait another six
months.
``If everything goes according to plan, we get the approval in February, the
application for Objective One is submitted in March, and we will know sometime
in July or August whether we have got it. So we could then start work on the
railway in May 1997.''
He said the project could be completed by the end of 1999.
He is convinced that if there is any delay in that timetable, if the matter
goes to a public inquiry - which could take two years - the Objective One money
for tourism would have long since been committed.
To have any hope, SNH, which has lodged an official objection to the planning
application, must be convinced that the company's plans for visitor management
are equal to the increased visitor numbers which may be attracted by the new
railway.
Timely agreement may yet be possible, however, SNH's Cairngorm area officer, Mr
Jonathan Stacey, told The Herald yesterday: ``SNH has come in for some
criticism for apparently dragging its feet on this one. That is not the case.
We are not opposed to development in Coire Cas, this is not a Lurchers
Gully-type dispute. We recognise the system that is there is outdated and needs
replaced.
``We recognise the March deadline for European funding, and SNH, along with
Highlands Regional Council and the chairlift company, are working towards that
date.''
A spokesman for Highland Regional Council's planning department said the matter
was progressing and there is to be a meeting with the chairlift company on
Monday. The very earliest it will be considered by the planning committee,
however, will be February.

<HEADLINE>Warning that Calton Athletic's former addicts may `convey wrong message' to pupils Schools `ban' for drugs group</HEADLINE>

Exclusive
ONE of Scotland's leading drug rehabilitation groups, Glasgow-based Calton
Athletic, claims it has been prevented from giving talks on the dangers of
drugs to pupils in Strathclyde secondary schools.
The controversy has angered those who say the group's tough approach to drugs
and its ex-addict members' first-hand experience of the devastating effects,
are invaluable in the fight against drugs abuse among young people.
Yesterday, the group's project leader, Mr David Bryce, claimed a series of
talks, this month, to pupils at Hillpark Secondary and St Andrew's Secondary
schools in Glasgow, had been cancelled on the advice of a Strathclyde Regional
Council official.
However, the official concerned, the council's regional adviser in health
education, Mr Alistair Ramsay, denied he had ever singled out Calton Athletic.
He said that, on the basis of independent research and advice from the Home
Office, Scottish Office, and the Scottish Affairs Select Committee on drugs, he
advised schools to be aware that ex-addicts could give conflicting messages to
pupils, suggesting that it was possible to be an addict and survive.
He confirmed he had spoken to a teacher at Hillpark Secondary but said his role
was purely advisory and that, ultimately, any decision on bringing in outside
groups to speak to pupils rested with a head teacher.
``In the face of the evidence given by the select committee and the Home
Office, it would be highly irresponsible for us to ignore that advice. If a
head teacher is seeking advice, it is irresponsible not to give it.''
However, in a letter to the region's deputy director of education, Mr David
Alexander, Mr Bryce has demanded clarification of the council's policy towards
drug education in schools. In the letter, he writes: ``I am now staggered to
find that Mr Ramsay is instructing your schools not to allow Calton Athletic's
work to continue as `the Scottish Office does not approve'. It is really quite
appalling that a voluntary group's efforts are being stopped.''
This summer, the group, which receives #200,000 in local authority and health
board funding for its recovery work, received a grant of #80,000 from the
private Robertson Trust for its schools education programme.
Mr Bryce said the group had refined its schools programme over the three years
its members had been giving talks to pupils, and had received praise from
pupils, teachers, and parents. Since March, the group had given talks in 15
schools in Strathclyde and the Borders.
He said he had also demanded an explanation from Scottish Office Education
Minister Raymond Robertson. Last month, the Minister announced three different
drugs programmes aimed at primary and secondary schools.
Labour MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, Mr William McKelvey, who chaired the
select committee, said that while drugs programmes in schools had to be looked
at carefully, he had heard only favourable reports of the work done by Calton
Athletic.
``I think the people who work for Calton Athletic do a great job. I see no
reason why Calton Athletic, provided the head teacher agrees, cannot go into
school to talk about drugs.''
Hillpark secondary's guidance teacher, Mr John Philbin, confirmed that Calton
Athletic had been due to give a series of talks which had subsequently been
cancelled.
St Andrew's secondary's deputy head teacher, Mr Frank Lennon, also confirmed
the group had been due to speak to pupils. He said the talks had been cancelled
as they did not fit in with the school's own anti-drugs programme.

<TEXT>
THE snail's pace progress towards Home Rule has been the subject of much
derision, but while everyone can find something to take issue with in the plans
finally agreed by the Scottish Constitutional Convention, most accept that
there is much in the scheme that is decent and good.
You can exclude diehard Unionists from that analysis, and write off strong
proponents of independence. But among the citizenry well-disposed to the scheme
, who harbour the broad belief that Scotland can be better run from within
rather than without, there is a consensus that the convention plans are a
decent stab at squaring a host of constitutional circles.
The unaligned, non-partisan voter with an insistent but unstrident self-image
of Scottishness has taken to the simple idea of a Scottish Parliament to frame
Scottish laws, while leaving the British strand of their identity intact.
In a sense, this is a question of leaving the tougher options open. Such Scots
can feel proud and to a large extent committed, without taking what some will
instinctively feel is a reckless step into the unknown.
They might be labelled by Nationalists as fainthearts, but their beliefs remain
consistent, according to our polls. What is less certain, is whether the
limited autonomy of Home Rule is seen as a finite end in itself, or whether
people will accept it as a process which may ultimately lead to greater
independence.
The early steps are relatively simple, however. At the next General Election if
the British electorate places its trust in Labour, the party will legislate for
a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly within their first year's legislative
programme.
Doubts have been cast on this in some quarters, even some close to home within
the Labour-Liberal Democrat pact that forms the backbone of the convention.
Chief Whip Archy Kirkwood suggested recently that this legislative programme
would be impossible to deliver, in the face of a concerted attack on the floor
of the House by determined Tories.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson has been bullish in his dismissal of
this, pointing out that the Conservatives have been able to push through
controversial European legislation in the House of Commons.
There is no indication that the SNP would seek to sabotage the passage of such
a Bill.
The reasoning behind this is twofold. One is that the proposed body in
Edinburgh would be better than none at all and could be used as a focus of
dissent, creating the ``slippery slope to independence'' feared by Unionists.
The second is that the Scottish electorate would punish them for a
fundamentalist stance.
As a result, the convention scheme is by far the most likely future scenario
for our future.
Under Mr Blair a Scottish Parliament would take over the existing Scottish
Office control of law, education, health, local government, transport,
planning, industry ,and the environment.
The budget would continue to be a formula agreed with Westminster, but with the
additional power to raise or lower the standard rate of income tax by 3p.
There will be 73 constituencies, based on the existing boundaries but with
Orkney and Shetland receiving one each in recognition of their geographical
need. In addition, in each of our eight current European constituencies, seven
additional members will be returned.
These candidates will be chosen locally by parties under standard selection
procedures, and elected according to a second ``party'' vote. A pact between
parties will also allow this corrective process to be used to get greater
numbers of women into the Parliament.
The 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament will meet during office hours in the
former Royal High School building in Edinburgh. They will will also meet at
committee meetings throughout Scotland.
Beyond then, the great imponderable is whether these MSPs will be happy to
accept the in-built limitations of the devolution scheme denying them powers on
defence, foreign affairs, immigration, social security policy, and
macro-economic policies.
Only this week, a report argued that the Home Rule Parliament must stake a
claim to a say in foreign affairs if it was to have any firm purpose. With
controversies such as nuclear weapons, naval base closures, and the disbandment
of Scottish regiments, it would be easy to see the Parliament in Edinburgh
taking a view.
Where then does the process stop. The line between legitimate interest and the
slide towards independence may then become blurred. What began as a sop to
Scottish opinion could become an instrument of increasing demand.

THE only ``Scottish'' working life peer among 11 named yesterday is Professor
John Sewel, who has been instrumental in guiding the preparations for the
Scottish Devolution Bill should Labour win the next election.
He was brought up in Bradford but describes himself as a Scottish politician,
having spent his entire political life and all except two years of his
professional life in Scotland. He moved to Aberdeen in 1969.
Professor Sewel, 59, is a Vice Principal of Aberdeen University and dean of the
faculty of social sciences and law.
He has been a member of the Labour Party for 25 years. For a decade, he was a
member of Aberdeen City Council and for three of those years he was its leader.
From 1982 to 1984, he was president of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities.
He said: ``It is obviously a challenging opportunity coming as it does at a
particularly interesting time in Scottish politics. I look forward to being a
full and active member of the House of Lords and doing what I can to secure the
return of a Labour Government.
``I would hope to play an active part to secure that Labour Government's
legislative programme and, in particular, securing a Bill establishing a
parliament for Scotland.''
Sir Gordon Borrie, 64, the man who chaired Labour's inquiry into shaking up the
welfare state, is another new working peer. Downing Street announced five new
Conservative peers, four new Labour ones, and two new Liberal Democrats.
New Tory peers include Lady Wilcox, chairman of the National Consumer Council,
who is also a member of the advisory panel on the Citizen's Charter and
chairman of the charter's complaints task force.
Mrs Helene Hayman, 46, a former MP who represented Welwyn and Hatfield from
1974-79, is a new Labour peer.
Professor Robert Winston, 55, professor of fertility studies at the Royal
Postgraduate Medical School, London University, has been named a Labour peer.
Mr Tom McNally, 52, a former Labour MP who defected to the SDP in 1981, has
been named a Liberal Democrat peer.
The other new Liberal Democrat peer is Dr William Wallace, 54, reader in
international relations at the London School of Economics.
Other new Tory peers are:
Sir Peter Bowness, 52, who was leader of Croydon Council from 1976 until it was
won by Labour last year and who now leads the Tory opposition on the council;
Canon Peter Pilkington, 62, chairman of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission
and honorary canon of Canterbury Cathedral from 1975-90;
Sir Basil Feldman, 69, chairman of the National Union of the Conservative
Party; and
Sir Philip Harris, 53, chairman of Carpetright plc, Harris Ventures, C.W Harris
Properties, and deputy chairman of the Conservative Party treasurers.

THE slice of tee-off times at the Old Course, negotiated by a London company
which is advertising #1390 holiday packages at St Andrews, provoked further
debate yesterday.
The Links Trust responsible for managing the golf course revealed it is to
contact British tourism offices worldwide in a bid to counter criticism of
costs and reduced access which, it is claimed, may damage tourism.
The decision follows revelations in The Herald that US tourists have cancelled
holidays and switched to cheaper venues such as Ireland.
Mr Peter Mason, external relations manager for the trust, insisted yesterday
that corporate packages costing #1390 would be used by only 14% of players who
tee off at the Old Course next year. ``The other 86% of times will be available
at the standard green fee (#60) next summer, a level which we believe is
affordable to most golfers,'' said Mr Mason.
Criticism was sparked by an agreement between the trust, the Keith Prowse
Agency, and a US enterprise, Pensus, which will earn the trust #5m over 10
years in return for the exclusive right to provide corporate packages.
The Scottish Incoming Golf Tour Operators' Association challenges the trust's
figures. Although 86% of players will pay the normal price, the association
points out that only 2500 tee-off times (10,000 players) representing a quarter
of those available all year, are bookable in advance by visitors.
The new deal means that 1040 of these 2500 advance reservations are controlled
by Keith Prowse and Pensus, representing 40% of the advance bookable play. The
restriction on times available to visitors, claims the association, may inhibit
tourism.
Scottish-based tour companies have been offered approximately 150 tee-off
times, the same as last year. The St Andrews Hotels and Guest Houses
Association, whose members will receive 225 times next year, has declined to
accommodate Keith Prowse clients.

THE Scottish Office has finally given the go-ahead to an #11m new dental
hospital and day surgery centre in Edinburgh.
Proposals to relocate the dental hospital at the refurbished Lauriston Building
at the city's Royal Infirmary were approved by Scottish Health Minister Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton.
The deal will also allow the hospital to take on thoracic surgery patients from
City Hospital and extend day surgery cases.
The transfer from City Hospital is part of a strategy to run down services at
the hospital, leading to eventual closure.
Lord James said: ``I am sure that many in the dental profession and the public
at large will welcome the news that the dental hospital is to be replaced by a
modern and much improved clinical facility, providing services for dental
patients into the twenty-first century.''
British Dental Association spokesman Hew Mathewson, chairman of the Scottish
general dental services committee, said: ``The new hospital is long overdue but
the association is delighted with the news.
``Dentistry is moving on rapidly. The existing hospital building is not
suitable for carrying that.''
A spokesman for Edinburgh University, which has campaigned vigorously for a new
hospital, said: ``Naturally, the university will be in discussion with the
Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh Trust about how this will mesh in with the
university's own plans for continuing education for dental practitioners.''
Edinburgh Central MP Alistair Darling said he was ``very pleased'' by the news
but pointed out that a new dental hospital had first been promised in 1985.
``Despite the delay, it is clearly a very welcome development.''
Dr John Baynham, chairman of Lothian Health, and Professor Cairns Aitken,
chairman of the hospital NHS trust, warmly welcomed the decision on the dental
hospital.
Dental hospital consultant and clinical director Robert Brown said he was
``very pleased'' and staff in the existing hospital looked forward to providing
a quality service in the new facility.
Lothian Health initially approved the dental hospital plans in January 1994,
ending a long-running battle, spanning nearly five years, over the future of
the dilapidated Edinburgh Dental Hospital.
In 1989, a working party chaired by Sir Donald McCallum recommended the closure
of the dental school and the building of a new hospital and post-graduate
institute.
The Government's handling of the issue prompted a sometimes acromonious war of
words between Edinburgh University and the then Scottish Secretaries Malcolm
Rifkind and Ian Lang.
Funding for the project has come from joint public and private funding, with
#8m contributed from the public purse.

BRITISH dog lovers have made an appeal to Thai Government officials to enforce
laws banning cruelty to animals, after protesting to the embassy in London over
the treatment of dogs that are being slaughtered for golfing gloves and
drumskins . . . and barbecues.
The provincial government of Sakhon Nakhon, in North-east Thailand, said
yesterday it would take action to see that the dogs were treated in a humane
way before being killed. But the slaughter would still go on, as it is not
illegal to kill dogs in Thailand.
The dogs are killed for their meat by families of Vietnamese origin. The skins
are sold for export to Japan, where they are used to make drumskins and golfing
gloves.
Sakhon Nakhon Deputy Governor Chanin Buaprasert said yesterday he was concerned
at the protests made in London by the Canine Defence League, which had been
brought to his attention by the Thai Foreign Ministry.
``We cannot stop the slaughter, because it is not illegal to kill stray dogs.
But we can try and make sure the process is done as humanely as possible,'' he
said.
Dog meat is considered a delicacy by families of Vietnamese extraction and can
easily be bought in the local market at Tha Rae for between 70p and 80p a kilo.
The Canine Defence League, however, claimed the way the dogs were being killed
was horrific.
The dogs are picked up at night by the catchers, who operate in trucks with
torches. They are piled on top of each other in pens and may be kept for three
days without food and water before being clubbed to death in slaughterhouses,
which only operate in the hours of darkness.

Bangkok  A SCOT charged with drugs offences in Bangkok has claimed he was
betrayed by his best friend.
Mr Justin Jackson, the fourth Scot now in a Thai jail on drugs charges, is
accused by police of running a factory producing ecstasy. Mr Jackson, the son
of a Perth antiques dealer, faces five years to life if convicted.
Thai police said Mr Jackson, 25, admitted drugs offences after a friend led
police to his apartment.
Mr Jackson was arrested with another Briton and an American. All were said to
be producing the drugs on the holiday island of Ko Pha-ngan.
British consul staff have visited Mr Jackson, who is now waiting for a trial
date to be fixed.
His father, Mr James Jackson, who has flown to Thailand, said last night: ``The
charges do not relate to heroin but to ecstasy. He told me he had ecstasy
tablets in his flat.'' Mr Jackson, who is to return to his shop in Kintoull
Street, Perth, next week, added: ``Justin said he used them to help him stay
awake at his work. He helped run nightclubs in Thailand.''
Mr Jackson claimed his son had been charged only with possession of the drug.
Sources in Thailand said, however, that the charges involved production of the
drug.
Mr Jackson said his son was suffering from the strain of imprisonment.
``Justin's morale is not particularly good.''
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ``Justin Jackson is currently in jail in
Bangkok on drugs-related charges. No trial date has been set but his father has
appointed a lawyer. There is no timescale of when he might go to trial.''
Mr Carl Parker from Bristol, a friend of Mr Jackson, was arrested first and led
police to Mr Jackson's apartment.
The arrests were made after a police surveillance operation in the Patpong area
of Bangkok.
Mr Parker, 28, had been living in Thailand for three years, most of them
working as a disc jockey. Mr Jackson, a former pupil of Perth Academy, had
taught English for employees of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand. Both,
however, gave up their jobs several months ago, said police.
Lieutenant Colonel Vichai Sangprapai said Mr Jackson was carrying 349 ecstasy
tablets at the time of his arrest. The arrests were made simultaneously in
different apartments in Bangkok.
The charge against Mr Parker, who has been released on bail of #7000, has
apparently been reduced to possession of five tablets of ecstasy. This offence
is punishable by a fine.
A friend of Mr Jackson, who asked not to be named, said last night, said:
``Justin is furious. Parker has turned him in to save his own backside.''
Mr Parker last night admitted leading police to his friend's apartment. ``I had
no choice,'' he said. ``I admitted everything and told the others to admit it
too, to play the game the Thai way. Because I have co-operated, the Thais are
treating me well.''
Mr Jackson is the fourth Scot to be held in Thailand on drugs charges. Earlier
this month, deep sea diver Brent Stirling, 26, was jailed for life on drug
offences.
Scots teacher Sandra Gregory, 30, has spent two years in Klongpen prison
awaiting sentence for drug offences that she has admitted. She has been told
not to expect anything less than 25 years. Her parents live in Pitcaple,
Aberdeenshire.
Another Scot, James Callender, 58, could end his days in a Thai jail after he
was arrested having swallowed a condom containing 178 grammes of pure heroin.
Callender, from Larkfield in Greenock, has admitted the smuggling charges. He
is awaiting trial and is expecting a life sentence.

EDINBURGH'S business community was criticised yesterday for its lack of support
for the city's Hogmanay entertainment programme.
Launching five days of events for New Year, Edinburgh District Council leader
Leslie Hinds appealed to the private sector to support public-sector partners -
the council, Lothian region, and Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited
(Leel) - because of the benefits to business from an influx of visitors.
Mr David Crichton, for Leel, said it was estimated last year's three-day event
had generated an extra #5m for the capital. A visitors' survey conducted by
System.3 found one in five had not been in Edinburgh before and two-thirds of
those had come to the city because of the Hogmanay celebrations. This
achievement has been recognised with an award for the city from the Scottish
Tourist Board for attracting low-season business.
The public sector input to this year's programme has increased by #25,000, with
Leel contributing #75,000, Edinburgh #55,000, and Lothian #50,000. The
remainder of the #600,000 budget is met from box office and sponsorship, which
this year includes the Bank of Scotland's support of the Hogmanay candelit
concert in St.Giles' Cathedral with the BT Scottish Ensemble, and Scandic Crown
Hotel's sponsorship of the torchlit procession on the same night.
Mr Norman Ireland, corporate projects manager for Lothian region, said there
was still not significant support of the programme by the business community.
``They are making money on the back of Edinburgh's Hogmanay but they have not
stepped forward to make a contribution to events. The benefits do not accrue to
the district, the region, or Leel but to shops, restaurants, and bars,'' said
Mr Ireland.
Mr Peter Irvine, of Unique Events, which plans the Hogmanay programme, said the
company had faced difficulty finding accommodation for artists performing
during the period because hotels and guest houses in the city were already
full, with many hotels obliging customers to stay for a period of three days.
It is estimated that the public attendance at the free street party on Princes
Street at Hogmanay, put at 160,000 last year, could reach 250,000. Tickets for
the Hogmanay Ball in the City Chambers are priced at #95, with proceeds going
to Oxfam.
This year's programme begins on December 30, when the emphasis is on
entertainment for children. Gary Glitter will also be performing in Princes
Street Gardens.
There will be a food festival in the Assembly Rooms and tenfold increase in the
number of restaurants which will be open over the New Year period.

DRILLING began yesterday at a playing field in Sheddocksley, Aberdeen, in a bid
to detect the source of a toxic gas which is affecting areas of the city.
Eight council workmen have been affected in two separate incidents - two are
still off work with breathing difficulties after more than a year. Two more,
affected in the latest incident in October, are also still off work.
Yesterday, however, it was stressed that those affected had been working in a
confined area within sewers in the city and there was not thought to be any
risk to the public.
The gas is understood to be carried in the city's drainage system but
Councillor Rhona Kemp, convener of the region's policy and resources committee,
said the possibility it was being caused by the sewers had been ruled out.
The drilling operation is being carried out at a former landfill site for
household waste, which was dumped in a former quarry. The first samples taken
did not suggest anything out of the ordinary.
Drilling will also be carried out at a second site where around 1000 cattle -
which died during a foot and mouth outbreak more than 30 years ago - are buried.
The operation is being carried out because the sites sit between an area of
Northfield - where there has been a chronic problem with an unidentified odour
for more than 15 years - and Mastrick, where, in October, people reported a
smell of gas and a leak was ruled out by British Gas.

A LAWYER whose 10-year-old son fought off a stranger who tried to drag him into
a car appealed for help yesterday to catch the would-be abductor before he
strikes again.
The worried father said his son had lashed out and wriggled free as the man
tried to drag him into his car as he walked home from school. The frightened
boy ran home and raised the alarm.
His father added: ``What worries me is this happened about 4pm, when it was
still light and in the middle of a housing estate, in our street.''
The boy returned to school yesterday.
Police praised the boy for his bravery in escaping from the man who pounced in
Silverknowes Court, Edinburgh, on Wednesday.
The man, said to be aged between 30 and 40, tried to persuade the boy to climb
into his dark-green saloon car. Frightened, the boy ran into Silverknowes Road
East but was chased and caught by the man before managing to break free.
Police said the man is between 5ft 8in and 6ft tall, of medium build with swept
back collar-length hair, and was wearing a gold-stud earring. He may have been
wearing a bomber jacket and jeans with a torn knee.

A LAUGHING hitman, hired by a secretary to teach an imagined office love rival
a lesson, was behind bars last night after being convicted of a ``catastrophic
and tragic'' attack.
Just because Terese Dorne smiled at the wrong person at the wrong time, she was
subjected to a ``nightmare'' of violence which began with CS gas being sprayed
into her face. As she screamed in pain, either Raymond Johnson or his as yet
unidentified accomplice, then slashed her forehead.
The gaping wound was so large a cascade of blood ``rinsed'' the gas from her
eyes.
Her attackers then cut her throat twice before running off laughing in a
display of ``true callousness''.
Mrs Dorne, 36, an accountant, was later taken to hospital and underwent a
series of operations. More than 60 external stitches were used to treat her
injuries.
Johnson, 25, of Deacon Way, Walworth, south-east London, was found guilty of
conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm.
Judge David Pitman remanded him in custody and said he would deal with him on a
date to be fixed after pre-sentence reports had been prepared.
Diana Lewis, 24, of Matlock Road, Leyton, East London, the secretary who hired
him and admitted the conspiracy charge, will be sentenced on the same occasion.
The Snaresbrook Crown Court trial heard how Mrs Dorne's ordeal began when she
started working for a firm of accountants in north London.
Also working there was Lewis, who was having an affair with businessman Ian
French, who worked in the building but not for the same firm. Lewis became
convinced that Mrs Dorne had designs on her lover.

IN MANY ways there are remarkable similarities between the parliamentary plans
proposed by devolution and independence activists in Scotland in terms of size,
composition, and electoral system.
The key difference, however, is that while Home Rule would provide autonomy
within the UK, the Scottish National Party plan envisages Scotland taking its
place among the nations of the world as the 16th member of the European Union
and the 186th member of the United Nations.
Under the SNP plan, Scotland would have 133 single member constituencies, with
MPs elected by the alternative vote system of proportional representation. A
further 67 members would be elected from lists under the additional member
system.
This is not dissimilar to the Convention system (although the latter elects its
constituency MPs by first-past-the-post), and like that plan it would involve a
single-chamber Parliament serving for a fixed four-year term.
The Scottish age of majority and of consent would be set at 16.
Any person whose principle residence was in Scotland, or whose place of birth
was Scotland, would be deemed a Scots citizen unless this was renounced.
An independent Scotland, which under current SNP plans would retain the Queen
as head of state, would adopt a Bill of Rights and a written constitution.
The SNP maintains that victory in Westminster or Edinburgh elections would only
be a mandate for a start toindependence negotiations.
This process would still have to culminate in a referendum before the Act of
Union would be dissolved.
This process is broadly accepted as being relatively straightforward under
international law, but what about the economic aftermath? Labour claims that
the turmoil of separation would cause irreparable damage to Scotland.
The SNP budget published earlier this week cited Norway's growth rate in recent
years of 2.9% in comparison with British growth of 2%. If Scotland, with
comparable wealth in oil and other natural resources, could achieve 2.5% that
modest economic growth could create jobs and better social services, they argue.
On this week's figures, over a four-year term in office an SNP Government would
plan to raise #6.3bn through economic growth. In turn, they would spend #5.5bn
on jobs measures and welfare improvements.
The figures can be argued over but the SNP now has the Prime Minister
confirming that there is nothing to stop Scotland going it alone.
A key SNP argument has been the concept known on the Continent as the ``tyrrany
of the tiny'', whereby smaller countries such as the Benelux nations have been
able to do well.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell points out: ``It could be the making of
England if they reassess their role and become a modern European nation instead
of clinging to a colonial past.''
So Scotland wins, England wins, Europe wins. A perfect politician's solution.

SCOTLAND'S third biggest university has unveiled a programme of ceremonial,
academic, cultural, and social events to mark its bicentenary next year.
Strathclyde University, Glasgow, began its academic existence in 1796 when, as
Anderson's Institute, it offered lectures to about 1000 students, about half of
whom were women.
Today, it has about 14,000 students, 3500 staff, and about 40,000 people who
attend adult classes and professional development courses.
It has also secured a top-10 ranking of universities worldwide for royalty
income from its inventions, while the quality of its teaching and research have
had consistently high ratings.
Writing in the programme of events for the forthcoming year, Strathclyde's
chancellor, Lord Tombs of Brailes, and its principal, Professor John
Arbuthnott, wonder if even a man of such vision as the university's founder,
the academic John Anderson, would have found it difficult to believe the
progress it had made.
When he died in January 1796, he left instructions for a new kind of university
for Glasgow which opened higher education up to people in employment and made
it more useful to them in their work.
Within five months, his executors had secured permission for its establishment.
Classes began in the Trades House of Glasgow but it was not until 1964 that the
institution, by then named the Royal College of Science and Technology,
achieved university status, when it merged with the Scottish College of
Commerce.
Professor Arbuthnott said it was now more important than ever for the
university to develop its close links with Glasgow.
``We are entering a period of increasing financial restrictions on
universities. Strathclyde will need to draw more than ever upon its partnership
with the city and with the citizens who study here to ensure the continued
fulfilment of our community-based mission.
``We have to be able to convince companies in and around Glasgow that, by joint
efforts and by linking into the university, we will create a training,
learning, and research base which will enable them to extend their businesses
successfully,'' he said.
The university's programme of events will include an international gathering of
Robert Burns' scholars, the bicentenary of whose death also falls next year;
conferences which will attract more than 8000 scholars; lectures and addresses
from a variety of speakers including Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, the
President of Ireland Mary Robinson, and explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes; and the
publication of three books about the institution.

A MAN acquitted by a jury's not proven verdict of murdering a taxi driver is
asking for a second jury if a #100,000 damages action by the dead man's widow
and family is allowed to go ahead.
Mr David Anderson, 24, was charged with the murder of Mr Raymond Mullan by
stabbing him through the heart with a hunting knife during an early morning
taxi ride from Gourock to Greenock in February 1990.
In May that year, a jury at the High Court at Paisley found the charge against
Mr Anderson, of Nelson Road, Gourock, not proven.
Mrs Margaret Mullan is now suing him for #40,000 in a civil action in the Court
of Session and her three children, aged 21, 19, and 16, are claiming #20,000
each.
The family alleges that Mr Anderson stabbed Mr Mullan, 38, deliberately or
negligently. Mr Anderson maintains that contact between the taxi driver and the
knife was accidental.
Mr Anderson is asking temporary judge Gordon Coutts to dismiss the action
because the true motive behind it is not to recover damages but to have him
branded as a killer.
Miss Leeona Dorrian QC, senior counsel for Mr Anderson, submitted yesterday
that the Mullan family's purpose in raising the action was to seek to have the
court declare that Mr Anderson had murdered or otherwise unlawfully killed Mr
Mullan.
``If Mr Anderson is correct about that, they should not be entitled to decree
on the merits of the issue because the court should not allow the civil process
to be used for these ends.''
Miss Dorrian added that if the case got to the stage of evidence being heard,
Mr Anderson's position was that he would wish the case to go to a jury.
Miss Dorrian said that normally the issue of motivation did not arise but this
was only the second case of its kind in Scotland and the first that had been
defended, so the circumstances were highly unusual.
Mr Ronald Mackay QC, for the Mullan family, said they were not alleging murder
but rather an assault which brought about death.
He was unaware of any case in which it had been said that the motive of the
pursuer was of any relevancy in deciding whether the action should be allowed
to proceed.
Some pursuers might be motivated by the simple desire to obtain money; others
might wish the defender to be held responsible for the consequences of his
actions.
Mr Mackay is asking the court to hold Mr Anderson liable for the death of Mr
Mullan and to restrict any future hearing to how much should be paid in damages
to the family.
The judge will issue a written decision later.
A jury in a Court of Session action consists of 12 compared with 15 in a
criminal trial. They would also be asked to decide the case on a lesser
standard of proof - a balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable
doubt.

SCOTTISH Local Government Minister George Kynoch yesterday raised the spectre
of a ``local tartan tax'' on top of the national ``tartan tax'' that Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth has claimed would be levied by a Scottish parliament.
Mr Kynoch was referring to the latest call by the Labour Party in Scotland to
return councils' power to set business rates.
The call came from Cosla president Rosemary McKenna, who said councils should
control more of their own income.
The Minister, speaking after a visit to Livingston, claimed that on past
experience such a policy would be a recipe for higher local taxes.
Business people, he said, had been enthusiastic about the move to a Uniform
Business Rate set by the Government.
Mr Kynoch has emerged recently as the man many new council leaders love to hate
following a series of high profile attacks on them for allegedly employing too
many highly paid staff, and creating top heavy committee structures in order to
spread special payments as widely as possible.
``A move to raise more tax locally would take the pressure off councils - which
is being exerted by Government - to be more cost effective and efficient,'' Mr
Kynoch claimed.
``I intend to ensure as I am responsible for a large amount of taxpayers' funds
that those funds are used wisely and I will continue to highlight areas where I
think there is wastage and where funds are being diverted away from the
provision of good frontline services into top-heavy bureaucracies.''

<TEXT>
A LAWYER who stole #2.5m from his clients was the victim of an international
fraud, a court was told yesterday.
Giles Davies believed all the money he gave to a Mr X - a man who cannot be
named for legal reasons, allegedly behind the fraud - would be returned with
interest, the High Court in Glasgow heard.
Davies, 42, embezzled the money for a ``hare-brained scheme after being conned
completely,'' defence counsel Mr Neville Shaffer, QC, said.
Davies took the money from clients of the 100-year-old legal firm, McCormick
and Nicholson, in Newton Stewart, Wigtownshire, driving it into bankruptcy.
His crime was discovered by a bank manager after the firm had run up an
overdraft and Davies, of Barrhill, Ayrshire, had run off. For nine days after
he disappeared, Davies wrote several letters of apology.
He told his partners: ``I have destroyed everything. I don't understand why.
The Law Society should know that you did not know anything about the mess. I
was conned completely.''
Advocate-depute Alan Turnbull said Davies was charged with embezzlement instead
of fraud because the Crown accepted he believed the scheme to be genuine.
Judge Robin McEwan, QC, asked why Davies' legal partners did not know he was
involved in an international fraud from their offices.
Mr Shaffer said: ``This hare-brained scheme might have been brought to an end
sooner if the partners had taken a greater interest in the affairs of the
firm.''
Mr Turnbull said the partners had their practising certificates suspended after
the collapse of the firm and were now all working for other firms.
Mr X - believed to be English - allegedly made more than #500,000 from the
fraud. He faces court proceedings, said Mr Turnbull.
Davies is expected to be sentenced on Monday. He has been in Barlinnie Prison
since his bail was withdrawn on Wednesday.

NOTHING in the history of the Tory response to Scottish demands for
self-governance suggests that the latest outburst of concern from the Prime
Minister and his proconsul will produce what scholars of devolution insist
matters most: the end of Westminister's right to say no.
One has only to read the words from Michael Forsyth's flurry of media
interviews yesterday, in the wake of the Prime Minister's intervention, to
appreciate how unlikely constitutional change of the sort championed by the
opposition parties is.
Would he give Scotland the right to settle its own affairs free of Westminster
interference? ``Having Scottish MPs vote on Scottish issues without an
involvement for Westminster is Alex Sal-mond's policy - that's independence,''
he told the BBC. Translation: we are committed to the sovereignty of the
Westminster Parliament, and that's that.
In December last year, in a BBC New Year's interview, Mr John Major identified
the problem. ``What happens when there is a conflict between the Scottish
Parliament, if it was established, and the Westminster Parliament? Who is
supreme?'' Devolution, he said, ``is one of the most dangerous propositions
that has ever been put before the British nation''.
The difficulty for the Government, after 16!s years of rule, has increasingly
been to justify the logic of a political system that leaves Scotland governed
by the party it has determinedly refused to vote for over four consecutive
General Elections.
Mr Major has made his passion for the Union a personal thing. He preached its
virtues from his soapbox in the 1992 General Election and has returned to the
theme on a regular basis, most recently in yesterday's interview. Although the
subject was bound to come up in any conversation led by the Independent's
resident Scot Andrew Marr, Central Office sources insist it was Mr Major who
raised it to reinforce what Mr Forsyth is preparing to spring on the Scottish
public.
In 1993, a year after promising to ``take stock'' of Scotland's complaints in
the run-up to the 1992 election, the Government published a White Paper
entitled Scotland in the Union: A Partnership for Good.
A central inquiry unit was set up, with an information line for the public; the
Department of Trade and Industry's oil and gas division moved to Aberdeen with
60 staff; five of the UK's 24 seats (20%) on the new European Committee of the
Regions were allocated to Scotland; responsibility for Scotland's training
budget was handed to the Secretary of State.
However, the most visible results were the new procedures agreed by the House
of Commons at the beginning of the last parliamentary year. These extended the
role of the Scottish Grand Committee, made up of all 72 Scottish MPs, to allow
it to debate and vote on Scottish legislation, to question and take statements
from Ministers, and to hold general debates, some suggested by the Opposition.
To make proceedings more immediate, the committee has taken to sitting in
Scotland. At a recent session in Aberdeen, only 17 out of 49 Labour MPs turned
up.
The Children (Scotland) Bill was the first measure to be handled under the new
rules but only after Labour had given assurances to Government whips that it
would not block the legislation. The expectation now is that Mr Forsyth will,
in his St Andrew's Day speech, announce even greater legislative powers for the
Scottish Grand Committee.
However, no-one believes the Government is about to start accepting the verdict
of its Labour majority on contentious legislation, like nursery vouchers.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson declared yesterday: ``The acid test
will be the Education (Scotland) Bill, announced in the Queen's Speech. Since
it's going to be voted down in the committee, will they accept that?''
Look back at the Tories' previous flirtations with devolution and the primacy
of the status quo of parliamentary sovereignty is clear. In 1967, the Thistle
Group, a Scottish Tory think-tank whose members included Michael Ancram, Peter
- now Lord - Fraser, and Malcolm Rifkind, published a pamphlet suggesting
devolution was essential to Scotland. A year later, Tory leader Edward Heath
made the Declaration of Perth, which promised the people of Scotland ``genuine
participation in the making of all decisions that affect them and to do this
within the historic unity of the United Kingdom''. The result was a Tory
proposal for a 125 member Scottish Convention that was promptly dropped once
the Tories were elected.
The Conservative manifesto in the October 1974 election posited the complete
reverse of what Mr Major is concerned about now. ``Devolution is our policy,''
it proclaimed.
Even Margaret Thatcher backed devolution when it suited her. In 1975, in
Edinburgh, she declared the establishment of an assembly to be a ``top
priority''. She was backed by Mr Ian Lang, Mr Rifkind, and the current Scottish
Tory chairman Michael Hirst.
Twenty years later and the Tories continue to whisper sweet nothings into
Scotland's ear. That the Tories have given the Scottish Office and its supreme
head more devolved powers and greater autonomy than previous Scottish
Secretaries would ever have dreamed of has not been enough to persuade the
Scottish electorate that the Tories do care.
Mr Major admitted as much in yesterday's interview, when he accepted the
possibility that Scotland might just be strong enough to stand alone.
The only way left for the Tories to counter this logic is by reducing the
constitutional debate to an all or nothing simplicity. A Scottish parliament,
with its ``tartan tax'', Mr Major and Mr Forsyth warn, will lead to the
break-up of the United Kingdom, by giving the SNP a chance to work for a
mandate for independence. Devolution, they insist, means separatism - unlike
the 1974 manifesto, which described devolution as the very opposite.
Whatever warm words Mr Major may have for Scotland, he is a parliamentary
sovereignist at heart. He may eventually accept the political necessity of
setting up some sort of super Scottish quango, a talking shop where the Scots
can vent their surfeit of spleen. It might even be the Scottish Grand
Committee. However, give up Westminster's reins on Scotland? Never.

THE ink was barely dry on the Hansard report on the outcome of the Commons
debate on Nolan when MPs were bombarded with information from PR companies
wanting to help them.
One such missive said: ``You will be aware of the motions passed by the House
earlier this week banning advocacy and requiring, in relation to permitted
parliamentary services, a written agreement to be drawn up and made available
for public inspection.
``By reason of the nature of our practice and having followed the proceedings
of the Nolan Committee closely, we believe we are well placed to advise members
on the appropriate form of agreements and are happy to accept instructions for
that purpose. If we can assist you please contact *.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*''
What was that phrase about an ill wind?
Gas mark
MUCH more intelligence is reaching us about the great Charter Mark saga
involving British Gas. Judges, apparently, will continue to take a tough line
with Charter Mark-winning organisations which fail to live up to the award's
high standards.
Desperately trying to rescue the thing, Public Service Minister Roger Freeman
insists that the Charter Mark is ``a seal of approval, a recognition of
excellent quality service, and if organisations are not serving the public
properly they do not deserve to keep the mark''.
Stoically, Mr Freeman says that he regrets British Gas felt they had no
alternative but to surrender their Charter Mark which, apparently, is ``not won
easily and not retained automatically''.
He would have us believe that that is why it is so prized by the 227 public
services who have won it so far and by ``the many thousands of people -
parents, patients, and many others - whom they serve''. Oh aye.
Please ignore
THE Department of Irrelevant Information: This week's prize goes to the
Department of the Environment, which put out a five-page press release on new
scrutiny of the paperwork imposed by local government finance systems.
It gets worse. Environment Secretary John Gummer said: ``I propose that my
department undertake a scrutiny in the field of local government finance. The
scrutiny will focus on information flows in relation to systems for financing
local authority spending - chiefly the information central government collects
from local authorities but also the information it feeds back to them.
``This scrutiny will investigate the demands generated by financial systems and
recommend means of reducing unduly onerous administrative burdens,
rationalising central government requirements for information, and improving
Government's efficiency in managing and handling that information.''
Lady Luck
WELL, at least we now know the truth about the National Lottery. Heritage
Secretary Virginia Bottomley has strongly defended it and admitted that the
family syndicate has played every week since the first draw. ``One year on, I
still haven't won a penny,'' she admits. ``This, apparently, makes me a
statistical anomaly. I couldn't possibly comment.''
She may, of course, wish to comment on a remark by husband Peter, Tory MP for
Eltham, who said the other day that his marriage was much more likely to end in
murder than divorce.
Transported
CONGRATULATIONS to Nigel Evans, Tory MP for Ribble Valley, for asking the
Secretary of State for Transport this week ``how merry passengers used the West
Coast main line in 1994.'' Some mistake, surely.
On impulse
A FEW MPs were spotted this week at a bash for the New London Orchestra at St
John's, Smith Square, London. One of the programme notes, for a clarinet
concerto by Finzi, talked about the clash between the clarinet and the string
section. At the close, it says, both parties are in ``lively and impulsive
mood.'' Yes, indeed.

<HEADLINE>Inquest hears of drowning at Greek holiday island MP tells of bid to revive his wife</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975323225</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TORY MP Tony Marlow yesterday described his desperate attempts to revive his
wife after he found her floating face-down in the sea during a Greek island
holiday.
Mrs Catherine Marlow drowned the morning after a night spent drinking wine with
her husband in her favourite holiday spot ``in the whole of the world'' on the
island of Zante, an inquest was told.
Mr Marlow described the moment he saw his wife's body: ``I realised it was
Catherine, floating face down in the water. She was by some rocks. I turned her
on her back and froth was coming out of her mouth.
``I got her to some rocks. I tried to give her mouth-to-mouth. I knew she was
not alive.''
The court was told that Mr Marlow found the body at noon. The couple had gone
swimming at 10am and had spent 20 minutes together.
The couple, who were staying in Mrs Marlow's sister's villa, drank a bottle of
``some sort of Greek wine concoction'' the night before, he said.
Next morning, Mrs Marlow, 54, ate a breakfast of coffee, bread, tomatoes, green
peppers, and feta cheese in olive oil.
About 10 to 20 minutes later, around 10am, she went swimming with Mr Marlow,
55, but, the court was told, got into difficulty while snorkelling off the
island's craggy coast.
A post-mortem examination carried out by the Greek authorities revealed there
was still enough alcohol in her system to push the level to just under half the
British drink-driving limit.
Coroner Anne Pember recorded a verdict of accidental death after the inquest at
Northampton General Hospital.
Mr Marlow, MP for Northampton North, was speaking publicly for the first time
about the couple's last night together.
Dressed in a grey suit, smiling, and looking relaxed, he told the court: ``We
had a bottle of some sort of Greek wine concoction the night before.
``It was something like wine. It was in a wine bottle but there were other
flavours as well as wine. It had been left by her sister. It was not labelled.''
Mr Marlow described how he and his wife had gone swimming together at a nearby
beach the next morning, October 2, 1994, three days into their holiday.
He said: ``Catherine was a keen and able swimmer. We went off together and
spent some time swimming together.
``We went round a point. I was trying to keep fit. I went off to do some more
aggressive swimming and left Catherine snorkelling.''
Mr Marlow later swam back past the point where he had left his wife. When he
did not see her, he assumed she had got out of the water.
He told the court: ``At first, I wasn't concerned. I got out of the water. I
thought she had gone off to buy some lunch or for a walk.''
He added: ``I did various things. I put out a fishing line. Then I thought,
`This is ridiculous.' I retraced where we had been swimming.''
Home Office pathologist Dr Clive Bouch carried out a second post-mortem
examination in Britain after the body had been flown back to England.
He told the inquest: ``I have been told by the Greek authorities that the cause
of death was drowning. I have no way of disagreeing with that.''
Mr Marlow, a former Army captain, was educated at Wellington College, Sandhurst
and Cambridge. He married in 1962.
The couple lived at a farm at Willoughby, Warwickshire, and had five children:
Edward, 31; Boris, 30; Emily, 27; Oliver, 24; and 23-year-old Alice. For the 10
years before his wife's death, Mr Marlow divided his time between her and his
secretary.
He spent weekends with his wife and in his constituency home and the working
week with Jill Chambers, with whom he has four children.

Sarah Vincent
on the latest
development in
an increasingly
sophisticated
space age
CAPTAIN'S Log, star date 17.11.95. A thermos flask so effective that boiling
coffee placed inside it would take more than five years to cool to a drinkable
temperature.
Its mission: to coolly go where no thermos has gone before.
No, it's not another episode of Star Trek. It is the Infrared Space Observer,
launched yesterday by the European Space Agency.
The ISO - said to be the Swiss army knife of satellites - is so sensitive it
can detect the heat from an ice-cube 100km away.
It will spend the next two years delving into the coldest depths of the
universe by observing faint heat from distant stars that could tell us about
their formation, evolution, and death, and perhaps even indicate what happened
at the beginning of time.
The ISO represents the latest development in a space age that makes the
equipment which took Neil Armstrong to the moon in 1969 look like Technical
Lego.
In the last 25 years since the great astronomical revolution began, our
knowledge of the universe has mushroomed.
We have sent probes to land on Mars, to investigate planets in our solar system
and into the tail of Halley's comet.
Dr Jacqueline Mitton, spokesperson for the Royal Astronomical Society, says:
``There has been a real explosion in the amount of astronomical detail and data
of every kind of astronomical object.
``Technological developments have revealed a completely different picture of
the universe which we didn't know was there.''
One change is that photographic plates are barely used these days, and in their
place are electronic devices which are so sensitive they can register a single
photon of light - the smallest measure of light possible.
The advances in astronomy have been almost entirely due to computers which
enable scientists to achieve what was previously thought impossible.
For example, new telescopes are being built with eight meter diameter mirrors
which can see further into space than ever before.
``This is only possible because of the technology for making thin glass mirrors
which can hold their shape,'' says Mitton.
``These new mirrors do not have to be rigid because they have computer supports
behind them.''
The largest telescope currently in use is the Keck, at the W M Keck Observatory
in Mauna Kea. When its twin is built beside it they will be able to distinguish
the separate headlights on a car 25,000km away - the most powerful pair of
binoculars known to man.
``Not only have things been revolutionised, but they are about to be
revoutionised again with the huge new telescopes,'' enthuses Mitton.
Another leap forward has been the possibility of observing the universe from
space, where rays from outer space are unaffected by the Earth's atmosphere.
This is the aim of the famous Hubble telescope, which is orbiting the Earth and
picking up non-visible radiation, such as X-rays, gamma-rays, ultra-violet and
infrared radiation.
Virtually all objects, whether stars, planets, or the dust between stars, give
off radiation of some kind, and by studying it scientists can tell what the
object is made of, how fast it is travelling, and potentially how old it is.
As a result of the new data, astronomers have convincing evidence for the
existence of black holes - incredibly dense regions of space which have such a
strong gravitational pull that they suck everything nearby, including light,
into them.
They have also become aware of new regions of stars, new stellar objects and
know much more about the composition and life of stars.
One of the eternal enigmas facing astronomers is how the universe began. Recent
evidence points more and more towards the Big Bang theory - the idea that 15
billion years ago the universe exploded out of a single point, and is still
expanding today.
And data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), launched by Nasa in 1989,
showed a background microwave radiation which was consistent with a rapidly
expanding universe, suggesting that at some time in the past all matter was at
a single point.
Mitton doesn't think there is much of a scientific future for humans to be sent
into space.
``The space race has perhaps done the opposite. There is so much one can do by
remotely observing from Earth that the incentive for sending astronauts are
much reduced.
``The reason for wanting to send people into space is now human adventure.''
But the biggest question of all must be - is there anybody else out there?
Mitton says: ``With the ISO we would have hopes of being able to see if there
are other planets orbiting other suns in solar systems like our own, because
that would be the first step in locating somewhere that looks plausible for
life.''
So far no-one has conclusive evidence for any other solar systems - a planet
orbiting a sun where the conditions for life would be fulfilled. But there are
indications that such systems do exist.
One thing is clear. The cleverer we become, the more advanced our technology is
and the further we venture into space, the more we will realise our own
insignificance in this vast cosmos.

SCOTLAND suffered the first cold snap of the winter yesterday, with snow
falling across the north and east of the country.
As if to confirm winter had arrived, Grampian Police said the notorious A939
Cockbridge to Tomintoul road was one of three blocked by snow yesterday. The
A974 and the B976 were also affected.
A spokesman said: ``If any roads are going to block, these are the ones.''
Nethybridge on Speyside was one of many locations where ploughs and gritters
were called out to deal with the first serious fall of snow. More than an inch
fell at Aviemore, but the main Scottish ski resorts were left praying for more.
Snow was reported along the east coast as far south as Berwick, and Glasgow
Weather Centre said that over the weekend temperatures should rise slightly,
with further wintry downpours next week.
In England and Wales, North Yorkshire and Northumberland were worst hit, with
villages isolated by snow-blocked roads for the first time this year.
A huge queue of traffic was halted for several hours on the A169 in North
Yorkshire, between Pickering and Whitby, when lorries failed to climb a snowy,
icebound hill. Flights were cancelled at Newcastle Airport and the city's Metro
system ground to a halt because of frozen points.
A race meeting at Sedgefield became the season's first sporting casualty -
abandoned due to snow. Meanwhile, Ladbroke's odds on a white Christmas fell
from 10-1 to 7-1.
Abroad, snow and wind lashed Scandinavia during one of the worst early winter
snowstorms in memory. One man died in a snowdrift, and Gothenburg Airport was
closed and the city left paralysed.
The weather cast a cold shadow over today's wedding of Danish Prince Joachim,
to Hong Kong economist Alexandra Manley, and royal guards parading outside
Amalienborg Palace had to contend with strong flurries of snow.

CELTIC yesterday were given a sharp rebuke for selling too many tickets for the
club's European tie against Paris St Germain earlier this month.
The disciplinary action, which followed a computer fault at Parkhead, came from
Strathclyde Regional Council's sports grounds safety sub-committee.
Its members decided to give the club a severe warning after complaints from
some of the fans who were forced to watch the match from stadium stairways
because duplicate tickets had been issued for hundreds of seats.
Club officials yesterday met councillors to explain how the mistake occurred in
Celtic's new #120,000 computerised ticket system.
Councillor David Sanderson, who chairs the sub-committee, said: ``This has been
a very serious breach of the club's safety certificate and we are very
concerned.
``The safety of fans is our main priority and we were seeking confirmation from
the club that their new system will prevent the possibility of over-issuing
happening again. The club gave that assurance.''
Celtic have been told that, if the problem recurs, the committee will meet
again and consider ordering a prohibition which would effectively reduce the
capacity at Parkhead.
A club spokesman said later that they regarded the matter as concluded. He said
only a handful of fans had complained to the club, each of whom had received an
apology and a complimentary ticket for another match.

A SCOTTISH public school broke up a day early for its weekend leave yesterday
in tribute to a sixth former who collapsed while watching a school rugby match
and later died in hospital.
Loretto School, in Musselburgh, East Lothian, arranged the early closure as a
mark of respect for John Kelsey, 17, on the day following the tragedy, which a
spokesman said had left the whole school community ``in a state of shock''.
Yesterday, his housemaster, Mr Hector MacLean, said: ``John gave 100%. He was a
fine young man who always had a smile on his face.''
John, a boarder from Aberdeen, was described as extremely popular and a notable
1st XV rugby player.
He was an NCO in the school cadet corps and served as a house prefect.
He was intending to study engineering design at university from next October.
John's parents, Peter and Stephanie Kelsey, travelled to the school after being
informed of the tragedy and returned home yesterday.
A post-mortem examination has been called for by the fiscal at Haddington as a
matter of routine.

A STEN gun which Winston Churchill kept at home during the Second World War was
sold for #10,125 yesterday.
The 9mm sub-machine gun was part of a cache of weapons the wartime leader kept
at Chartwell, in Kent, in case of attack by German paratroopers.
Mr Martin Long, 45, the chairman of Churchill Insurance bought the gun. He
already owns several other pieces of Churchilliana including a wartime map. His
personal assistant, Ms Karen Sharpe, bid for the lot at Christie's in South
Kensington before taking her prize back to head office in Bromley by Tube and
train wrapped in paper and auction house carrier bags.
Sten guns originally cost 7s 6d each - 37.5p in modern money. They were issued
to troops to provide rapid automatic fire and were an alternative to the
American Thompson .45 sub-machine gun.
The Sten gun will be kept at Mr Long's Bromley office.

MY 13-year-old daughter wants a monthly allowance. She says she is fed up with
getting her pocket money weekly in cash because she simply spends it.
Thirteen-year olds can be very persuasive. She argues that if her allowance was
paid into a bank account, it would help her budget and she wouldn't blow the
lot the moment it hit her account.
Well, I will believe that when I see it. However, I am convinced that children
should be encouraged to look after their own money and that today's teenagers
need to learn about banks, cash machines and rates of interest. And a freshly
opened bank account with a shiny new cash card will make a good Christmas
present.
The question is which bank or building society? My daughter arrived home from
school with a pile of bank literature picked up in the local high street. All
seem to be wooing children like her with offers of free cinema tickets or
record tokens. The children find it very seductive. I, wagging my finger,
pointed out that she should be looking at rates of interest.
My daughter's needs are simple. She wants a cash card which she can use to get
at her money in the high street while she waits for the bus on the way back
from school. I suspect she will be making lots of small withdrawals, a fiver
here, an odd #15 there when she is planning a shopping trip with her friends.
At this stage she doesn't need anything more complicated. Cheque books and
credit cards are obviously out of the question.
I am hoping there will often be at least #50 saved in this account, but which
bank or building society pays the highest rate of interest on amounts as small
as this and which will give her instant access to her money?
All the major cash withdrawal networks are available to her, so I can set up a
standing order with any bank or building society account which offers instant
access through a cash card. But high interest won't be of any use if the bank
or building society that we choose charges a fee if she puts her card in a
competitor's cash dispenser.
According to MoneyFacts, children should aim to find an account paying more
than 3.5% gross. Best buy is the Halifax Quest Club which pays 3.9%, followed
by Britannia Ltd which pays 3.8%. Others worth considering are the Nationwide
Smart account and TSB Firstsave which pay 3.5%. The Royal Bank of Scotland
Route 17 and Dunfermline Headstart also pay 3.5% but only give cash cards to
children from age 14.
The Halifax, Britannia, Dunfermline, Nationwide and TSB all use the Link
network of cash dispensers. There are now more than 8500 Link machines.
However, the Halifax charges 60p for each withdrawal made from machines other
than its own. This restricts the number available to 1600.
The Britannia, which has only 43 cash dispensers of its own, allows free
withdrawals from both the Link and Midland Bank networks which total 10,700
machines. The Dunfermline, with 33 branches, has only five cash machines and
makes no charge for withdrawals made from Link machines. Nor does the
Nationwide on children's accounts or the TSB.
The Royal Bank of Scotland allows free withdrawals from Bank of Scotland,
Barclays, Lloyds or Midland cash machines, a total of just under 9000.
All these accounts deduct tax at source from the interest paid. However,
children are allowed to receive up to #100 a year in interest tax free from
money given to them by a parent, #200 a year if both parents give. To get the
interest paid gross, parents need to fill in form R85 which bank and building
societies can provide.
Tax always trips up parents who want to give money to their off-spring.
Children have their own personal tax allowance from the day they are born. Any
money which is given to them by, say, grandparents or godparents can then grow
tax free so long as the interest doesn't exceed their personal allowance (#3525
in the 1995-96 tax year). This doesn't apply to money given by parents, which
the Revenue treats as still belonging to them.
One of the best ways parents can give money to children is to use National
Savings Children's Bonus Bonds which pay 7.5% if they are kept for the full
five years. Each child can have up to #1000 in Issue G, so if they already own
other issues their savings can be topped up. If you want to give Children's
Bonus Bonds for Christmas, the application form must be in by Monday, November
20.
MoneyFacts publishes a monthly guide to savings and mortgage rates. It costs
#48.50 a year, but it is offering a free copy to Herald readers who ring 01692
500765.

ROBERT POWELL
WHISKY distiller Robertson &amp; Baxter has sold its loss-making Paterson Arran
fine foods subsidiary to a management buy-out team, but has retained a minority
stake in the company.
The price paid to the distiller of Lang's blended whisky and Glengoyne malt,
has not been disclosed. Neither has the size of Robertson &amp; Baxter's remaining
stake in the company.
The MBO, led by managing director Alan Hardie and finance director Ian
Appleton, was supported by more than #1m of loans from the Bank of Scotland.
Mr Hardie said it marked the final stage of a year-long restructuring process
aimed at restoring Paterson Arran to financial health.
The company manufactures preserves such as whisky-flavoured mustard at a small
plant on the island of Arran and biscuits and shortbread at its main factory in
Livingston.
It lost about #1m last year on turnover of #12m and is expecting a similar loss
in 1995, but Mr Hardie predicts that it will return to profit in 1996.
The staff is being cut back to 170 from 220 to improve efficiency, with 21 jobs
still to go at Livingston before Christmas. Heavy spending on marketing and
packaging has also been reduced.
``We are just about down to fighting weight,'' Mr Hardie said.
A large plank of Paterson Arran's recovery programme is to expand sales of own
label-foods on behalf of other firms. The company already makes and packages
salad dressing for British Airways and biscuits for diabetics for Boots the
Chemist.
Paterson Arran plans to expand by acquisition, but Mr Hardie said that will not
be for a year or so.

PAUL Weir is determined to keep his dream alive when he defends the World
Boxing Organisation light-flyweight title against South Africa's Baby Jake
Matlala at Glasgow's Kelvin Hall tonight - a dream in which he sees himself as
the only Scot to win world titles at three different weights.
The little man from Irvine is already the only Scot to win two titles, but will
not be satisfied until he has added the flyweight title to the straw and
light-fly championship belts he has already won.
To keep on course, however, he must triumph in what he regards as the toughest
test of his professional career, against the tiny Matlala, the man who came to
Glasgow and wrenched the world flyweight title from Croy's Pat Clinton. After
three successful defences, Matlala lost that crown to Mexico's Alberto Jiminez,
and that put Weir's ambition on hold.
Explained the 28-year-old Scot, who will be having his sixth world title fight
in just 12 contests: ``The plan was that I would challenge Baby Jake for his
flyweight belt, but Jiminez put paid to that. I am now making a voluntary
defence of my title and have decided to give Baby Jake a shot at it. I wouldn't
have given him his chance if I thought he could beat me.
``I have a great admiration for what he has achieved in the ring, but I am
convinced I'll keep the championship in Scotland, and beating someone like Baby
Jake will put me on the road to even bigger things. I'm still determined to be
a world champion at three different weights.''
As you will have gathered, there is no feeling of inferiority in the Scot, but
he does recognise just how dangerous the 33-year-old South African can be.
Matlala puts his views of the fight in simple terms. ``It really is make or
break time for me,'' he said. ``I have to win and I believe I will win.''
Matlala, the smallest professional fighter in the world at 4ft 10in, doesn't
present much of a target and his aggression and powerful combination punches
have worn down more experienced opponents than Weir.
This is a genuine even-money fight, but I go for Weir. The Scot will not stand
still for Matlala to swarm all over him and he should be able to build up a
convincing lead early in the fight.
The undercard for the show hit a snag yesterday when flu ruled out Denver's
Benji Marquez, who was due to have met Glasgow's Gary Jacobs. The Scot, who is
building up to another world welterweight title fight, will now face London's
Lee Wicks.
The main support, however, will see Tranent's Willie ``The Mighty'' Quinn make
his first defence of the WBO Continental middleweight title. The challenger is
Hull's Peter Waudby, who recently won the Central Area title, and he provides
yet another step up in class for Quinn.
The rest of the bill is:
Cruiserweight - Colin Brown (Glasgow) v David Flowers (Canning Town). Welter -
Joe Townsley (Cleland) v Kevin Toomey (Hull). Light-welter - Mark Breslin
(Barrhead) v Paul Scott (Newbiggin). Super-feather - Hugh Collins (Stirling) v
J T Kelly (West Hartlepool). Feather - Peter Buckley (Birmingham) v Lehlohonolo
Ledbawa (South Africa).

<HEADLINE>Lambie overcomes resistance on return to Brockville Straight talker is back at his roots</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAN PAUL</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975323249</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IT IS 36 years since a fresh-faced, enthusiastic, naive teenager called John
Lambie walked through the front door at Brockville to sign for Falkirk. Last
summer, he completed the circle by becoming the team manager, by which time the
naivete had been long since erased, the enthusiasm undiminished.
In a sense Lambie, although very much regarded as a Partick Thistle man or,
alternatively, a Hamilton Accies son, went back to his roots when he agreed to
join his old friend, chairman George Fulston, at Brockville.
It was the presence of Fulston - and, no doubt, the pay rise - but, perhaps
most of all, his own sense of destiny that combined to persuade him to leave
Firhill, where he had not only become a director but a fixture.
However, if you probe gently, you might also discover that within a few days he
wondered if he had done the right thing.
``Of course, that happens when you move clubs, especially to a place like
Falkirk, where Jim Jefferies was so highly regarded. I am a different kettle of
fish altogether to Jim, so it was difficult to begin with,'' says Lambie.
He recalls when there were only three days before a Coca-Cola Cup game with
Queen of the South, he had five players out injured, and he wondered what he
had let himself in for.
In that patently honest fashion that endears him to interviewers, Lambie
concedes that there was resistance to him within the club as a consequence of
the loyalty to Jefferies and the disappointment that he had left for Hearts.
``That wee bit of resentment is bound to be there when you take over at a club,
but it is up to you to weigh up your players, change faces, get players round
to your way of thinking. Do your own thing.''
He firmly believes that, if he had started in the pre-season, a lot of the
initial problems could have been avoided, but adds: ``I said after just three
days here we faced a very big job. I think the chairman and directors knew
that. We are starting to make progress.''
Lambie acknowledges that players were set in their ways, set in Jefferies'
ways, as is always the case at a club. In fact, Lambie's first plan was to let
well alone. ``I came into the job and didn't upset anything. I left things the
way they were. They had done well the previous season - why should I come in
and change things? But as the weeks progressed, I had a look and felt it was
time to do it my way.''
He believes he has brought the club round to his way, but adds cryptically:
``As far as that is concerned, I think I have only one thing to do and we will
be off and running.'' The one thing remained his secret, but perhaps we will be
able to guess in due course. ``Players have got to start to have self-pride,
play for the jersey. A football club is bigger than any player or any manager.''
At 54, Lambie is by far the oldest premier-division manager, an example of how
hard work, complete application, and self-belief can win even in the most
volatile of occupations. He would say that one of his unshakable tenets in
dealing with footballers is to be honest.
``You can't kid players. Telling them the truth might hurt, but in the end they
will respect you for it. If you lie to them, you will end up in a no-win
situation.''
He can take some straight talking himself, as he illustrated when he talked
about Falkirk fans, among whom there was also distinct resistance to his
appointment. He went to a supporters' meeting at which one fan, whose bravery
deserves a mention in dispatches, told him: ``I didn't want you here in the
first place. You were defensive-minded with Partick Thistle and we don't want
that.''
The image that he formed a pattern, an attitude at Firhill, which was designed
to halt the opposition rather than inflict punishment of its own, may have been
the biggest obstacle that Lambie has had to overcome at Falkirk, but his reply
to the fan is his reply to any other sceptic: ``I told him if any fan wants to
ask any player here whether I talk defensive football, he is free to do so. I
have never been a champion of defensive football and never will be.
``I know a lot more think that, but the only way I can satisfy them is by
winning games. I was here as a player for 10 years, so I know what the Falkirk
fans want.''
The relationship between him and Fulston is already notorious, the tales of him
being thrown out of his own home by the chairman when they were together at
Hamilton being confirmed by Lambie's recollection that they didn't talk to each
other for nine months.
``He didn't bring me here because we are friends. He brought me here because he
knows that I took Hamilton twice to the premier division, from second-bottom of
the first division, and I took Partick Thistle from second-bottom of the first
division into the premier, and kept them there for three years.''
He retains a soft spot for both Hamilton and Thistle and was depressed to hear
of the sit-in at Firhill by fans last weekend. ``I understand how supporters
feel at times and I think the money they have to spend to watch these days
allows them to have their opinions. But the chairman, Jim Oliver, was superb to
me.''
In that context, Lambie, maybe uniquely, readily admits that all the chairmen
he has worked for have been ``brilliant.'' They include Jan Stepek, when he was
in charge at Douglas Park, and about whom Lambie tells one particular tale
against himself.
``I asked to speak to the chairman, who invited me up to his house. His wife
poured me a coffee, left us, and I sat down. I asked him for 60 grand to buy a
player. He looked at me, asked me to stand up and turn round, booted me up the
backside and told me he didn't have 60 grand. You knew where you stood then.''
He has never had much cash to spend with any of his clubs and, in fact, set a
pesonal record when he paid #200,000 for Derek Ferguson a few weeks ago. He may
retain a liking for his old clubs, but no-one is more committed to his current
club. ``I am interested in only one thing now, and that is Falkirk Football
Club. There is a difference between here and Firhill, but there are diferences
with every club. I came here when they had finished fifth, and fans are looking
for no less than that this time. In the past I went to clubs who were in dire
straights. Falkirk were having a hard time for a while last season, then
brought in fresh faces and got it going.
``It is one of these strange things that newly promoted clubs into this league
seem to be relaxed and do well. Obviously, the first target for us is to make
sure we stay in this league, but ultimately I would like to take this club into
Europe and also win a trophy.
``To do that we will need quality players. There are some here and I brought in
one in Ferguson. I have been trying to sign another one for the past three
weeks.''
He is a fan of Maurice Johnston, who again has begun to get goals, for the
Brockville club. ``I said to him that everybody knows about his work-rate and
skill, but it was time he was getting into the box and scoring again. He is
doing that. ``Maurice is a real professional who looks after his body. He
doesn't get injured often and that is probably because he keeps himself so
fit.''
Lambie has always believed that any new manager, even one called Technical
Director, needs three years to get his game plan fully operational, but his own
self-appraisal would not allow him to overstay his welcome. ``If I didn't think
I was doing the right job for Falkirk, I would walk away. There is no way I
would embarrass George Fulston.''
He is not one of the mega-rich members of the managerial club - ``I like to
enjoy myself'' - and recalls starting in management as a part-time, #60-a-week
man.
He gave up his share of the bookmaking business, a good deal more lucrative
than his football earnings, to go full-time at Hamilton. He had been asked to
take on the job part-time while Bertie (Auld) was still there, but refused -
``I had too many good times with Bertie.''
Eventually, when he was asked to take over the following season, he was
persuaded by his wife Mamie - ``Remember, I have got to live with you,'' she
said - to give it a try. He has been on the circuit ever since.
``I would like to give it a go for another two or three years, because I
believe this is a young man's game. But I would like to stay involved somehow.
I love football and it is my life.''
Apart from home and family, only one other love competes for his attention -
pigeon racing, although golf is making a bid. The doos are John Lambie's
relaxation. If and when he talks to them, you can be sure there will be no
prevarication. He is not a man for ``flannel.''

<HEADLINE>POWER GENERATION Hydro-Electric still in battle for pump storage business</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric is through to the final round of bidding for National
Grid's pump storage business in North Wales, company officials said yesterday.
The two hydro-electric dams at Dinorwic and Ffestiniog open their sluices at
peak periods to shove up to 2300 megawatts of extra power into the English and
Welsh electricity pool for up to four hours at a time.
They later draw electricity from the grid during off-peak periods to pump water
back uphill to their main reservoirs.
The pump storage business, which is being privatised separately from the rest
of National Grid, is expected to sell for between #300m and #400m.
Historically it has made an annual profit of around #50m.
Eleven companies submitted preliminary bids when the pump storage business was
put up for sale in September, but only three have qualified for the final round
of bidding, which closes on December 15.
An official announcement of who the three finalists will be is expected on
Monday. Last night Hydro-Electric still did not know the identity of its two
rivals.
Other firms known to be interested in pump storage include Eastern Electricity,
which was recently taken over by the Hanson group and has just bought two
coal-fired power stations from PowerGen for #450m.
A pump storage management buy-out group, the French state power company
Electricite de France and several US utilities were also thought to be
interested.
If Hydro-Electric wins control of the pump storage business, it will be the
company's biggest investment south of the Border.
Its biggest investment outside Scotland to date is a #280m half-share in a
680-megawatt gas-powered power station at Keadby on Humberside, which is due to
come on stream next month. Hydro-Electric's partner in that deal is the English
regional electricity company Norweb.
A key attraction of the Welsh pump storage business is that Hydro-Electric
already has expertise in running this type of operation.
About 20% of its power comes from hydro-electric dams in the north of Scotland
and the company already operates a 300-megawatt pump storage scheme at Foyers
on the shores of Loch Ness.
Hydro-Electric would have to call an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to
endorse the purchase of the Welsh pump storage if its bid proved successful.
But company spokesman Mike Keohane said the acquisition would be financed from
borrowings without recourse to a rights issue.
Hydro-Electric has gearing of 30%, but Mr Keohane said there should be no
problem raising this to 80% if necessary to finance new investments.
This would allow the Perth-based company to go ahead with a project to build a
700-megawatt gas-powered power station at Avonmouth near Bristol as well as
buying the pump storage business, he noted.
Hydro-Electric has held exploratory talks with British Gas on taking a half
share in the Avonmouth project. This would involve it in further investment of
about #150m, but there has been no decision yet to go ahead with the venture.
Hydro-Electric is taking a different path to expansion in England and Wales to
its south of Scotland rival ScottishPower which recently bought Manweb, an
electricity distribution company, for #1130m.
Hydro-Electric prefers to invest directly in generation and supply without
taking on responsibility for more power cables than it already has to maintain
in the north of Scotland.

THINGS got mighty serious last night. After all, Ms Harris and her current
accomplice, every earnest musician's earnest musician, Daniel Lanois, were
engaged in forging a brand new genre-busting musical form -
ambient-country-gospel-rock might be the most accurate label - as well as
seeking to span the American ethno-musicological divide from New Orleans funky
funeral-march to Apalachian folkabilly four-step.
Good-time whoop-di-do was absent from the menu, perhaps in part due to
Emmylou's voice being afflicted with a jet-lagged huskiness. Nevertheless Ms
Harris sang to her usual intent: with ragged defiance in the face of the void
which awaits us all.
Similarly, despite his being jokily attired in a Motorhead t-shirt, Mr Lanois
coaxed sonic textures from his guitar with grave delicacy. No mindless
headbanging.
Deeper Well, from Emmylou's current album, Wrecking Ball, is a good example of
where she and Mr Lanois might be headed.
It's a song which Bo Diddley and Hank Williams could have co-written. But only
if they'd gotten into New Age crystal therapy, looking to find water inside
some deeper well, and each hoping that their inner child hasn't drowned down
there.
There were many gorgeous moments last night - ah, the heartbroken recrimination
which Emmylou brought to Lucinda Williams' Sweet Old World - but only if you
knew Wrecking Ball, and were prepared to forget most of Emmylou's other albums.
Yet there was a one-paced air to the proceedings, too.
A small price to pay for seriously good artists taking their art seriously?

THE presence on the Scottish music scene of Chinese composer Tan Dun, who made
his official debut on Thursday night as associate composer/ conductor of the
BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, in one of their Cutting Edge series of
concerts, has several implications.
First, Tan's extraordinary mix - an authentic and original blend - of cultures
adds a new dimension to Scotland's music. In its own way, his music is radical.
There's nothing original in a composer creating a collaboration between ethnic
and modern idioms - they've been at it for years.
But Tan Dun's two Orchestral Theatre works - the second receiving its UK
premiere on Thursday - are something else: they are a homogeneous mix of the
ancient and the avant garde, of West and East, in an integrated unit.
The other implication is that we're going to have to find some way of
describing this astonishing music. Orchestral Theatre II is pure performance
art. Two conductors - Tan and Jerzy Maksymiuk - directed the SSO, whose
woodwinds were stationed around and above the audience, and the audience itself
(which joined full-throatedly in the chanting) in an amazing performance of
what was nothing less than ritual art.
Written entirely on one note, with the conductors themselves involved in
shouting, chanting, miming in silence (God knows what the Radio 3 listeners
made of that), with a staggering range of orchestral sounds embracing haunting
woodwind, baying brass and a terrifying crescendo on basses that was like a
fleet of approaching bombers, and bass Stephen Richardson intoning and yelling
like a demented Tibetan monk, the whole thing was awesome in its primal effect.
Jerzy Maksymiuk conducted the rest of the superb programme, including
high-energy performances of Messiaen's Oiseaux Exotiques (with pianist Rolf
Hind) and Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements.

HEWLETT-Packard, the US computer and communications company which owns a large
factory at South Queensferry, yesterday announced a 52% increase in net
earnings to $2400m for the year to October 31.
The company, based at Palo Alto in California, announced it would share 11.46%
of its second-half profits with employees, the highest proportion since the
scheme began in 1962.
Hewlett-Packard's 5000 UK employees will share #6.8m from this bonus. The
company has factories at Ipswich and Bristol as well as South Queensferry.
Net revenue rose 26% to $31.5bn. The US accounted for $14bn of that revenue,
with the remaining $17.5bn coming from foreign subsidiaries.
Earnings per share jumped from $3.07 to $4.63.
Wall Street investors turned the company's year-end news to their advantage by
taking profits on Hewlett-Packard stock, which gave up $4.50 to close at
$88.50.
Hewlett-Packard's UK operations improved in line with the company's overall
performance, increasing turnover to #1700m from #1314m in the previous year.
Exports were also up, rising by 59% to #700m.
The company's South Queensferry site, which employs 1250 people, specialises in
the design and manufacture of test equipment and network management systems for
telecommunications, mobile radio, cable television and general radio frequency
measurements.
The site, which is home to a microwave, telecom and telecommunications
division, saw its combined turnover increase by 37.5% over the previous year.
``Hewlett-Packard's operations in Scotland are extremely good performers,
relative even to the company as a whole, which has done very well,'' marketing
communications director Hugh Walker said.
He added that the prospects were good for future investment and expansion at
the South Queensferry site.
At Hewlett-Packard headquarters, chief executive Lewis E Platt thanked
employees worldwide for their contributions to the company's success. ``We're
pleased with the consistency of our performance throughout the year and with
the balanced contribution of our businesses and geographies to these results,''
he said.
``Again this year, Hewlett-Packard people around the world have shown energy
and ingenuity in delivering what customers are looking for.''

SCOTTISH home owners may have escaped the worst problems that have afflicted
the UK housing market in recent years but they have not been completely immune.
Figures from the Halifax Building Society show that house prices on this side
of the Border fell by 2.2% during the third quarter this year. The number of
households suffering negative equity is also increasing. Latest figures reveal
that more than 13,000 in Scotland are now affected.
Mortgage lenders would like the Government to use this month's Budget to
introduce measures to stimulate the housing market. Top of their wish list is
the abolition of stamp duty, but extra help targeted at first-time buyers has
also been suggested. Additional tax relief and grant type incentives for
first-time buyers are among the measures recommended.
Many potential first-time buyers are delaying property purchase and choosing
rented accommodation instead, despite the attractive mortgages being offered by
lenders. In an effort to convince home makers of the advantages of ownership,
Abbey National has just published a survey showing that in every major city
around Britain the cost of renting a property is higher than buying.
The survey compared the overall cost of buying and renting houses over a
25-year period. It calculated the amount of money spent on buying a property
with a 90% repayment mortgage at a fixed rate of 7.99%, including maintenance
costs, and compared it to the cost of renting somewhere similar - assuming 3% a
year inflation on the rent.
According to the Abbey National, the West of Scotland is the fourth most
expensive area in which to rent in the whole of the UK. It states that a
three-bedroomed semi-detached house in Glasgow will cost more than twice as
much to rent as to buy. Over 25 years, the cost of renting such a house would
be #302,400, whereas buying a similar property would cost #135,556. ``That's a
massive saving of #166,844,'' Abbey National points out.
Its calculations show that savings of more than #100,000 can also be made when
buying rather than renting other types of property in the area.
However, Abbey National seems to have missed the point about why people are not
buying. A recent survey by the Council of Mortgage Lenders into why the housing
market is not moving found that cost was not the major deterrent. Less than 10%
felt mortgage rates were unattractive.
By far the most important reasons given by 25 to 34-year olds for their
reluctance to enter the market was that their employment situation was not
conducive to buying (41%) and that they were unable or unwilling to take on
debt (38%). Other main reasons were that they were saving or still had to save
for a deposit (33%) or were worried that they would find it difficult to keep
up their mortgage repayments (27%).
So the major problem seems to be that people lack confidence in their own
financial position and their ability to service their mortgage and are,
therefore, delaying a decision about buying a house. Practical considerations
about mobility also enter into it. There is a fear of not being able to resell
a property when necessary (13%) and a feeling that renting is more flexible
(18%).
Another survey by the Household Mortgage Corporation also found that the major
worry among prospective house buyers was job security followed by a fear that
interest rates would rise again. HMC also asked existing customers what advice
they would give to their children.
According to HMC's Jeff Wagland, writing in MoneyFacts: ``Young people are
being advised to rent until they are absolutely sure that they have found the
place they want to settle down, and the person they want to settle down with.
They are being told to save up as large a deposit as they can before even
thinking about a mortgage, and to treat home ownership as a very long-term
game.''
Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders and HMC found home ownership was still the
aim of most people. Asked by the CML where they would hope to be living in 10
years, 84% said they would like to own a house.
Thus, renting is mainly seen as a short-term option, which makes Abbey
National's 25-year comparisons rather misleading. Indeed, a more limited
exercise carried out by the Woolwich Building Society comparing renting and
buying over a two-year period established that renting was a cheaper option.
Still, in one respect Abbey National is right. Interest rates are low and, for
those who are ready to settle down, home buying is a cheap option. Mortgage
protection policies are now freely available from companies such as General
Accident to cover your mortgage payments if you become unemployed or sick and
unable to work.
Competitive mortgage offers abound. According to MoneyFacts, Bradford &amp;
Bingley, for example, is offering a first-time buyers' loan at just 1.89% fixed
for the first year with a free valuation thrown in. Mortgages of up to 95% are
available.
For borrowers concerned about future rises in interest rates, a fixed-rate
mortgage may give peace of mind. The Royal Bank of Scotland has recently shaved
the rates on its range and borrowers can lock into a 95% mortgage at 8.75% for
the next 10 years. If you want a 100% loan the rate increases to 9.75%.

THE exciting thing to do in the stock market recently has been to dance nimble
footed with the Scotias, Unipalms, Cortecs and other win-or-bust pharmaceutical
or computing specialists working in the ``leading edge'' areas. Rising hopes
have given a dozen or so of them high ratings and provided good Christmas
dinners for the brave investor.
Back in the safer world of investment trusts, inhabited by investors who like
to spread their risks, Philip Middleton of broking firm Merill Lynch has been
getting a little warmer towards his specialist sector than he has been of late.
In the firm's latest quarterly report he and colleague Charles Cade confess:
``We are becoming more bullish.''ddddd
They are not yet rampantly so. It would take a bear market they say to depress
the discounts at which the prices of trust shares trade compared with the value
of their underlying assets to make them that enthusiastic, and they are not
expecting that sort of fall. But they do say: ``Trusts are getting cheaper and
this is allowing some proper value to come through.''
Although the average discount over the sector as a whole has not moved
dramatically in the last three months, they say there are ``individual
situations which offer very good value''.
If you like the UK market, for instance, they have been running their
calculators over the relationships between discounts, UK content, yields and so
on, and come to the conclusion that Edinburgh Investment Trust is the one they
like best for taking the investor into mainstream UK shares.
Repeating that they are ``not suggesting a raging level of optimism'' but see
more reason for buying than they have done for some time, they suggest the
largest trusts which seem the cheapest to buy are the two European
privatisation trusts, Kleinwort and Mercury, together with Kleinwort's Charter,
Edinburgh, American Trust, Mercury World Mining and Scottish Mortgage, which
they comment is a well-managed general trust at the wide end of its trading
range.
The discounts on Fleming Overseas and Anglo and Overseas have now narrowed to
near their trend lines but have been ``very cheap recently'' they add. Perhaps
these two are also worth keeping an eye on, particularly as Anglo and Overseas
does seem to wander into cheap territory from time to time.
In general, the brokers comment that trusts investing in Europe and North
America seem ``very cheap'', while those investing in general overseas shares
are also ``attractive''.
So far as American Trust is concerned, they suggest its rating has been
affected by the surprising problem faced by Fleming American Trust. As this
traces its ancestry back to what was a railway company, a business it quit in
the early years of this century, it has come up against the US Environmental
Protection Agency.
The agency can demand payments for cleaning up pollution caused in previous
years and the old railway company is accused of letting creosote leak into a
lake. The trust's share of the costs might, the brokers suggest, be ``a few
million dollars'' but until the uncertainties over how much, if anything, it
will have to pay are resolved, it will trade on a rating reflecting this.
So far as they are aware, American Trust is not tarred with the same brush but
it has also been derated, presenting investors with ``a clear
opportunity''.fffff
Interest rates appear to have an effect on investment trust discounts.
Certainly the drop in rates seemed to prompt a big switch from cash deposits in
banks and building societies into shares, bringing strong demand for investment
trusts in 1993.dddddddddd
The men from Merill Lynch say they think the UK interest rate cycle has peaked
and are also ``very bullish of US interest rates''. This is an extremely
positive background for investment trusts as, logically, falling rates should
improve demand for their shares, although the potential reductions in rates are
tiny compared with those a couple of years or so ago.
Interest rates get a lot of publicity as politicians, bankers, economists and
industrialists argue over what should be the correct level. Yet a lot of people
do not realise just where they stand.
Unit trust group Save &amp; Prosper researches this from time to time and its
latest findings are that ``interest rate perceptions are still too high''.
A survey carried out last month showed that nearly half the people with instant
access building society accounts thought they were getting more than they
really were. While interest on #1000 net of tax is around 2.8%, 40% thought
they were receiving more than this and almost 40% confessed they did not know
what they were getting.
Amanda Webster, the group's product development director, says: ``With
inflation running at 3.2% many building society investors are losing out in
real terms from their savings and they are not realising it. The position is
even worse for higher rate taxpayers where they are taxed even further on the
interest earned from most building society accounts.''
Her group's Extra Income Fund, a UK unit trust investing in blue-chip shares
and fixed-interest securities to give a mixture of income and growth, currently
yields 5.6% gross, although part or all of its management charge may be debited
to capital. The fund, launched in October last year, has so far given a total
return of 12.4% if net income was reinvested.

She began as little more than a twinkle in Woody Allen's eye and her image is
manufactured from very little. Even the star herself admits to that. So why,
asks Jane Scott , is Sharon Stone such a highly-marketable phenomenon?
THERE are perhaps four things you should know about Sharon Stone before
dismissing her as a Hollywood publicity monster who shows rather too much skin
to be taken seriously.
The first is that in 1980, director Woody Allen cast her as his fantasy woman
in his black and white film Stardust Memories - her movie debut. It makes one
snigger now, but: ``I looked at her and thought I would really like her to kiss
me!'' he is reported as saying.
Stone protested when they put her in a ``bombshell dress'' for the brief clip,
where she kisses him.
``I said: `Wait. Let me explain something - I'm not a bombshell.' They didn't
see it my way. I played Woody's fantasy. And that was the beginning of the
end.''
Ten years later she posed nude for Playboy, proving that at 32 and with a
decade of truly awful potboilers behind her there was not so much a serious
actress waiting to get out as a woman determined to get noticed.
A year later she uncrossed her legs in Basic Instinct; the Sharon Stone package
was revealed, heralding the writhing skin scenes so familiar to those of us who
have yawned our way through the ludicrous plots and moderate box office success
of The Specialist and Sliver.
And in the past two years, it has paid off; more important than taking the
leading role in The Quick and the Dead, last year's female shoot-em-up cowboy
movie, she was the co-producer and chose the director.
This year she finished shooting Casino, playing mobster Robert de Niro's
unfaithful wife. Martin Scorsese, the director's director, chose her for the
role, which is perhaps the only really important thing you need to know about
Sharon Stone at all; as part of Hollywood's elite, she is all future, and the
past doesn't figure at all. Not that the past necessarily bothers her. She is
variously reported as saying in Basic Ambition, a new biography by journalist
Douglas Thompson out this month:
n On the 10-page Playboy spread: ``One, I wanted to be seen. Leading ladies my
age are typed and you need to be sexually appealing for parts in the movies you
might be right for. It's a man's world and when you look like I look, that's
what it is.''
n On Basic Instinct: ``Once I realised that was what the guys wanted, I
thought: `Oh, I get it. No matter how he touches her or where he touches her or
what else he does to her, it`s the most, it's the best, it's the sexiest'.''
n On Sharon Stone: ``My image is manufactured from very little . . . I realised
I could create an event - this more attractive woman.'' She has maintained she
was ``betrayed'' on the Basic Instinct interrogation scene by director Paul
Verhoeven, who told her to take off her white knickers because they were
reflecting the light, assuring her the shadows were too dark to show anything
very significant. She has subsequently vetted all nude scenes before release.
AND Stone and her fans drearily insist that the part of sex killer Catherine
Tramell in Basic Instinct changed Hollywood values for good. This, remember, is
the movie that gave us perhaps the most offensive line in film history: ``I
think she's the f*** of the century.''
``So many female characters are written the way men experience women or would
like to experience women. But that's not the way women really are . . . I think
Basic Instinct showed both men and women in the trenches pitted against one
another,'' says Stone. It is true that Tramell more than matched Michael
Douglas's testosterone-stuffed detective Nick Curran, unlike the sad obsessive
played by Glenn Close in his previous rip-em-off movie Fatal Attraction, but
Stone claims too much here; what is ``the f*** of the century'' but Woody
Allen's dream girl made flesh?
Stone's movies have almost all been written, directed and produced by men, and
until The Quick and the Dead (with the possible exception of Sliver) she has
never carried the film; her role was the main character's love interest.
So forget about the films, which ain't going to change anything; concentrate on
what she does with her stardom.
Vicki Patterson, assistant education officer at the Edinburgh Filmhouse, says:
``She is a phenomenon, and she is interesting; she has created controversy, and
she is determined - I admire her for getting in a position where she
co-financed The Quick and the Dead; it is unusual, especially for women, who
are constantly fighting among themselves for a decreasing number of parts. It
takes guts to put one's reputation on the line.''
Thompson's biography has the precocious Stone telling schoolfriends in rural
Pennsylvania that she would be the new Marilyn Monroe.
She escaped home via modelling, and then to Hollywood, where she appeared in
slasher flicks (Deadly Blessing), creaking adventure pictures (King Solomon's
Mines, Allan Quartermain and the Lost City of Gold), and the execrable Police
Academy 4 before losing a truly career-sapping bad perm and hitting the big
time as Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife in Total Recall in 1990.
The recurring word in interviews is control. On the way she has ditched a
husband and a long-term lover - both film producers - at least two agents, had
a Hello! at home shoot (which caused controversy when it was divulged she had
borrowed someone else's home to do it with), gained a lover 10 years younger
than herself and, most recently, been awarded France's highest mark of esteem
in the arts - the Chevalier of Arts.
Patterson says: ``If Casino goes well that will improve her record at the box
office and guarantee her work in the future.
``Hopefully, she is going to continue to get involved in production. It will
mean more roles for women and better roles and hopefully they can perhaps
champion directors of their choice, maybe directors who are a lot more
sympathetic to female roles.
``I think we should take her seriously, and the French obviously do. Maybe
we're missing something.''

SHAREHOLDERS of London Electricity are in for a Christmas bonus as the group
revealed a cash handout which the stock market saw as an attempt to dissuade a
predator from pouncing.
They will receive a special dividend of 100p a share net of standard rate tax
and a 20% increase in this year's normal dividends to 34.8p. This follows a 29%
rise for 1994-95.
The special amount will be paid at the same time as the interim for 1995-96 at
the end of January.
London Electricity chairman Sir Bob Reid said that after the current year they
expected to continue increasing dividends in real terms. He commented: ``These
proposals are in line with our strategy of returning value to our shareholders.
``Last year we completed a successful share buy-back and next month we expect
that shareholders will be invited to approve our proposals for the demerger of
the National Grid. This special dividend delivers value to shareholders while
maintaining the company's ability to invest in and develop the business.''
The share buy-back reduced the number of shares in issue by nearly a tenth and
the special payout will cost #198m. It is subject to approval by shareholders
at a meeting scheduled for mid-January. It is also proposed to consolidate the
existing Ordinary shares into new Ordinary shares.
The payout plan will have to be partly financed through higher borrowings,
raising gearing to around half shareholders' funds and follows similar moves by
other electricity companies as they tried to escape predators.
There are now just four regional electricity companies retaining their
independence following the takeover boom and the rest are expected to be
snapped up eventually.
Analysts did not think the latest move will make London less vulnerable. One
commented: ``It will make it a bit more difficult, a bit more expensive but I
doubt it would stop someone from making a bid.''
The group could afford to take more aggressive steps to retain independence as
it could raise its gearing significantly further. But its shares, up 19p at
933p, valuing the group at #1900m, are partly discounting a successful bid.

PAUL Hindemith, whose centenary is marked by the first professional British
staging of his medieval allegory Mathis der Maler, was labelled a degenerate by
the Nazis shortly after the piece was premiered. He eventually fled Germany,
and history proves his prescience: ``Where there's blood and violence, art
cannot thrive.''
The Royal Opera rather bravely handed responsibility for the production to
opera's enfant terrible, Peter Sellars, whose American freeway version of the
Magic Flute still causes shudders among more conservative opera goers. On the
first night of this effort there were a few token boos, but Sellars provided
few causes for dismay.
Hindemith set his story in the sixteenth-century German peasants' revolt, but
Sellars has made explicit the composer's attack on the tyranny of his time. The
setting is apocalyptic modern, full of cruel men in suits, machine guns, and
disinfectant engineers. The steeply raked glass set is dominated by a
continuous-loop television picture of a mysterious silent head.
Led by a passionate Esa-Pekka Salonen in the pit, and an exciting set of
soloists, the production made the most of Hindemith's tense, sometimes soaring
score. Of note, Alan Titus as the tortured, visionary painter Mathis gives a
raw edge to a superb voice. Stig Andersen is a moving Cardinal Albrecht. German
soprano Christiane Oelze is a promising find as Regina, daughter of the rebel
Schwalb, sung by the strong Thomas Young.
The revelation, though, is the Danish soprano Inga Nielsen, a pure,
terrifyingly exciting voice as Ursula.
Hindemith's ideas on art and power are best left to the purity of the music and
the voices. Sellars often obscures them with too much visual PC clutter,
forgetting that less is always more.

GENERALLY speaking, I'm a big fan of Boris Berezovsky. He's an unlikely
virtuoso pianist: a big, sleepy-looking lad who looks as though he's just got
up and forgot to comb his hair. Pianistically, he's down to earth, unaffected,
with his interpretations free of posture and pretension.
I suppose that some of those qualities could be perceived in his solo lunchtime
recital at the RSAMD, yesterday, where the programme was devoted to
Mussorgksy's Night on a Bare Mountain and Pictures at an Exhibition (both more
familiar from their orchestrated versions, but with a different sort of
effectiveness in their original keyboard format).
The trouble was that Berezovsky's playing veered slightly left of naturalness
towards something suggestive of casual indifference, or a preoccupation with
something else. That probably sounds insulting, and isn't meant to be. The best
way to describe his performance yesterday is by analogy.
Mussorgsky's Pictures, for those who don't know the work, is a set of musical
portraits separated by a recurring theme entitled Promenade, and intended to
portray the listener/viewer wandering from picture to picture in a gallery.
Imagine a visitor to the gallery who's merely passing through, taking a short
cut, heading somewhere else.
This was Berezovsky yesterday, striding through the Promenade, passing by most
of the portraits at a rate of knots, getting a general impression, but taking
little attention to detail, dynamic, or colour contrast. Brusque and
disappointing.

STERLING was still on the rack yesterday as it has been all week. Its
trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies finally closed at 82.3,
beating the previous closing low of 82.5 established on Wednesday.
Against the German mark, it slid to 2.1725 at one stage, before recovering
slightly to 2.1751, down 1.85, and still under its previous record low of
2.1755 seen in May this year.
There are various factors adversely impacting on the pound, not least the
softness of the US dollar as the stand-off between President Clinton and White
House leader Newt Gingrich continues over the US budget. But the pound even
finished 0.39 lower on the dollar at $1.5523.
``Sterling is doing what it does best, going down,'' said one dealer.
Speculation about interest rate cuts, worries about possible imprudent tax
reductions in the Budget and general political uncertainty were also
influencing factors in the UK currency's travails.
Howard Davies, deputy governor of the Bank of England, meanwhile, speaking
after the close of London trading, added his contribution to the interest rates
debate, stating that the Bank of England will change its advice and recommend
an interest rate cut if there are clear signs that final demand is weakening.
But he said the Bank's view of inflation was based on an assessment of the
probabilities. ``We are not yet persuaded that inflation is dead nor indeed
that the Government can achieve its inflation target of 2.5% or less - though
yesterday's figure was certainly encouraging.''
In an address to the Oil Industries Club, he said that, ``if there were clear
signs that final demand has weakened substantially, that would be likely to
affect our assessment of inflationary pressures, and our advice would change''.
He stressed that changing one's mind when the facts change is not a sign of
``dizziness'', rather the reverse. But it is important not to react to one good
number or indeed one bad one.
The deputy governor said the Bank hoped steady growth would continue. ``Our
central assessment is that it will and that the underlying condition of the
economy is healthy,'' he added.
Thursday's inflation data for October showed UK retail prices fell 0.5% on the
month, reducing the year-on-year headline rate to 3.2%.

AGAINST all odds, and at great personal risk, young - puerile-sounding anyway -
intrepid Ed Marriot, hearing of a lost tribe in a hugely inaccessible part of
Papua New Guinea, decides to go meet the Liawep people who live on the mountain
they worship as their god.
Nobody wants to help him and anthropologists try to dissuade him, gently at
first and then they come clean and suggest that he is nuts and liable to be
eaten. But does he listen? Not Ed. I must come clean myself here because when I
started listening to Our Father the Mountain (R4) I stopped the tape and gave
myself a little talking to. It went like this.
``Critic, put aside your prejudices about that voice. Remember that your
dislike of that kind of voice - no, that character-voice - has been recently
activated by last night's viewing of Four Weddings and a Funeral. Just because
he sounds like Hugh Grant in the jungle (I mean, of course, the Grant persona,
all terribly gosh and upper-class tic) does not mean the result of Ed's awfully
big adventure will be risible, deeply patronising and rather sick. You don't
yet know if it will be Numpty gets Pretty Scared in Bongo Land.'' So I deleted
my bias and rewound.
First of all we had to hear about the drugs and jags he needed to make his
actually illegal journey into primitivism. He is warned about the fatal bite of
some bug or snake (I'm sorry, I was laughing a bit here but it was one or the
other) he might encounter. A female bite of the species would be fatal, so he
asks how he is meant to tell the difference. Things were getting complicated
for Ed and he hadn't even reached the mountain yet.
With his guide Dunstan, Ed reaches the tribe, some of whom immediately scatter
into the nearest bit of denser jungle. Ed notes and ponders this. Things get
worse, and with an analytic grasp of the situation he says it's ``because I'm
basically here, isn't it?''
Yes, I murmured, yes! And as if he had heard me, Ed went on to describe how
suggestions had been made that there might be something colonialist and dubious
about going into a place he had no idea about, with no ideas whatsoever. The
head of the tribe was called Herod and not unsurprisingly, given his name, was
pretty het up about Christianity, de-manding that Ed profess his faith. Well,
he did this pretty reluctantly, he admitted, but you see, he didn't want to
offend, did he?
HEROD was getting pretty hostile by this time but I suppose, not having seen
Four Weddings, he probably didn't get the joke. In the middle of this
tragi-comic nightmare, with lots of noise in the background, our reporter
whispers to Dunstan: ``Would it help if I came round to say hello?'' No, I
shouted, but this time he did not seem to hear me because things, astoundingly
in the face of his anthropological sensitivity, got worse.
The mountain got angry, Herod threw a fit, and four children died. Dunstan
rushed into Ed's room suggesting they better get out of there fast. Very fast,
so fast, in fact, that Ed fascinatingly cogitated on the fact that it had taken
them five days to get there, but only three days to get back.
Then once he had got his breath back, and explaining to us that it would have
been inopportune to hang around talking to his little machine in the middle of
the mayhem, Ed finished off his extraordinary contribution to global knowledge
by telling a little garbled nugget which involved 7th Day Adventists and gold
consortiums.
There is certainly a story to be told there, but next time I know exactly who
the producer should send. It came to me while listening to Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes (R4). Lorelei was given a diary; she was confused at first, because it
was a book without words, but once she grasped the diary concept, she warmed to
the idea - although she wondered, given that she thought all the time, how many
books she would need.
I still think that if Radio 4 had given her a cute little recording machine,
like they had given to Ed, she would have produced a better programme, and hit
it off with Herod.

AFTER more than three weeks' training at an altitude of 8500 feet, Liz McColgan
and her husband, Peter, climbed into a truck to take them the hour's drive back
down through the polluted, rarified air to catch their flight out of Mexico
City.
With them, went their host, German Silva, with whom McColgan had done several
training sessions. They bade one another farewell at the departure gate, Silva
bound for New York, the McColgans for tomorrow's Tokyo Marathon. ``I knew
German was in shape to win his race, and that I was on course for mine,'' said
Liz.
Half of the prediction has already been fulfilled - Silva retained the New York
Marathon crown last weekend, while tomorrow, McColgan lines up for the most
vital race of her career, and after the toughest sacrifice she has ever made.
It is five weeks since they last saw their daughter, Eilish, but Liz has risen
at 5am every day, phoning Carnoustie to chat to the four-year-old before
grannie, Betty, took her off to school.
It was the worst possible time to be away, for during it Eilish went to school
all day for the first time. ``I have missed her terribly, but it's just as well
she stayed behind,'' confides Liz.
``Mexico was good for training, but primitive. The house itself was fine - four
bedrooms, rented out to runners. It was owned by German, and his brother,
Rudolpho, who drove us to all the various training venues. But there were dogs,
roaming wild in packs. A couple of times I was chased, and they set on one
runner.
``Hygiene-wise, it was safer to stay home and do our own cooking. We used
bottled water for cooking and even brushing teeth. Despite being very careful,
I had a stomach bug - could not last 20 minutes without going to the toilet,
and needed antibiotics.
``Later a storm cut off the phone and electricity for a week. It was so cold,
we had to order wood for a fire. It arrived strapped to the back of a donkey.
``Basic? Yes, but if it works, we'll be back next March, to test it again
before doing it for the Olympics. If things don't go well, we will modify the
timing.
``This is an experiment, to see how I respond to altitude - planned
meticulously, coming down exactly the same number of days before Tokyo as I
will for the Olympics. I know I'm in my best-ever shape for a marathon, and
will be disappointed if I don't break 2hr 27min, assuming conditions are okay.''
The background may be alien as McColgan runs between towering glass
skyscrapers, bristling with the antennae of Japan's high-tech communications
industry, towering over tiny pavement restaurants - six or eight fold-down
seats ingeniously hinged around rickshaws parked on the pavement with all
cooking equipment on board, and serving freshly cooked sea slugs - past the
frantically jangling pachinko parlours where pinball-crazed housewifes enact a
scene identical to that in the casinos of Las Vegas or Atlantic City.
But as the Dundee Hawkhill Harrier tackles her final work-outs, she is right at
home. Japan was where she tackled her first-ever major championship, in 1985,
before almost any Scot had ever heard of her. At the World Student Games in
Kobe she finished fifth in the 3000m, and fourth in the 10,000m - the last time
she was beaten in the Land of the Rising Sun.
Subsequent victories include the Fukuoka cross-country, less than three months
after Eilish's birth, a world record in the Tokyo half-marathon, and another
win in the Tokyo Marathon, plus her world 10,000m triumph on a typhoon-lashed
night in 1991.
Tomorrow she faces a tougher field than any previous marathon: Valentina
Yegor-ova, Russia's Olympic champion bidding for her third succcessive win in
the race; double Commonwealth champion Lisa Ondieki, who has never forgiven
McColgan for making her squirm in New York; and Junko Asari, the 1993 world
champion from Japan, who will have two sub 2-27 compatriots for company, as
this is their Olympic trial.
For McColgan, who has been in daily phone contact with coach Grete Waitz as
well as her daughter, her time - rather than the place - tomorrow will tell
whether she can again scale the Olympic heights after a three-year injury
nightmare.

LESLIE Deans Racing Club will not only be chasing a chapter in Scottish
athletics history tomorrow in the eight-stage, 45!s-mile Edinburgh to Glasgow
road relay, but also to secure their own future, writes Doug Gillon.
If they win the Barr-sponsored event, it will not only gain consolation
silverware for their sponsor, Edinburgh solicitor Leslie Deans whose football
team, Hearts, seem incapable of stocking his trophy cabinet, but Racing would
join Victoria Park as the only club ever to win in five successive years.
Club founder Alan Robson confirmed that talks are in the pipeline for a new
backer - Deans has never stood in the way of their securing support on a
grander scale. ``Clearly, victory would do these talks no harm at all,'' said
Robson.
Racing will field Ken Chapman, Tom Hanlon, Davie Ross, John Robson, Frank
McGowan, Brian Kirkwood, Glen Stewart, and Scott Cohen. All but the last two
were in last year's octet, and the addition of Stewart, outstanding road man of
the current season, and Cohen, in fine form, suggest they will achieve their
goal.
Shettleston also field six survivors from last year's runners-up squad: Dave
Cameron, Billy Coyle, Dermot McGonigle, Graeme Wight, John Mackay, and Andy
Little, plus Brian Sally and Adrian Callan, who can only strengthen that
line-up.
Cambuslang have one or two injury niggles and problems to resolve today, but
the team which took bronze at the national cross-country relay championships -
Alex Robertson, Graeme Croll, Charlie Thompson, and Steven Wylie - are all
available. British internationalist Keith Anderson and hill-running ace Colin
Donnelly are not.

Welsh Water
marks time
WELSH Water, a potential bidder for South Wales Electricity, yesterday pulled
back from elaborating on possible terms when the two companies met. Swalec said
later that it was ``very disappointed'' that Welsh Water had still not
clarified whether it intended to make a bid for the company and voiced concern
at what it called the uncertainty being created.
Welsh Water made clear that it was continuing to examine the possibility of
making an offer for Swalec and if it went ahead would seek the backing of that
company's board. But any offer would not include Swalec's stake in the National
Grid. On this basis, no firm price will be put on the company until a market
value for the National Grid could be established.
The two companies have agreed to meet again after this. The demerger involves
distributing most of the shares of the National Grid to the shareholders of the
regional electricity companies, which are its owners.
A prospectus for the National Grid is due to be published on November 22.
Trading is due to start on December 11.
Zantac sales fall
THE decline in sales of Zantac, the anti-ulcer product, has hit the overall
growth of Glaxo Wellcome. Group chairman Sir Colin Corness told shareholders at
the annual meeting yesterday that sales of Glaxo and Wellcome products for the
10 months to October 31, 1995, when compared to the sales of both companies for
the same period of 1994, grew by 4% in sterling terms, 5% at constant exchange
rates. Excluding Zantac, sales are growing 8% at constant exchange rates, ``a
credible performance given the impact that the bid and integration process have
inevitably had on the sales forces of both Glaxo and Wellcome''.
Boost for Fife firm
HUGHES Microelectronics Europa announced yesterday it had secured a #2m
contract for the production of approximately 200 of the electronic guidance
systems used in Tomahawk missiles. The Glenrothes-based manufacturer will
assemble the control module guidance systems and relay boxes for Tomahawk
missiles built in the US by Hughes Aircraft Company.
Devine resigns
ANNE Devine has resigned as finance director of the Glasgow-based specialist
engineering company Clyde Blowers after two years in the post. The company said
she had resigned for personal reasons to pursue a new career and she was
leaving with the board's best wishes. Company secretary and group financial
controller Alex Stewart will take over her responsibilities while a new
permanent finance director is sought.

OFFICIALLY, Scotland will be one of 12 countries thrown into an all-in draw,
minus four seeds, for the European Championships in England next summer. UEFA
yesterday named the quartet of privileged sides, who will not meet each other
at the group stage, as hosts England, holders Denmark, Spain, and Germany.
Spain and Germany have been given their seedings based on records from
qualifying results for last year's World Cup and the European Championship
qualifying matches. All the rest are to be distributed at the draw in
Birmingham on December 17, which means that in theory Scotland could be put in
the same section as England, and another fine mess that would get UEFA into.
However, the grapevine has it that, somehow, in this draw yet to be made, the
Scots will be kept apart from their near neighbours, as far apart as Newcastle
and London, but until December 17 we will have to wait and see.
England have been placed in Group A, which will be contested in London and
Birmingham, although the hosts will play their games at Wembley, but the other
three seeds will know their venues next month. Group B matches will be played
at Elland Road, Leeds, and St James' Park, Newcastle, Group C teams play at Old
Trafford, Manchester, and Anfield, Liverpool, and Group D sides are based at
Hillsborough, Sheffield, and the City Ground, Nottingham.
UEFA also announced that the Republic of Ireland's qualifying play-off with
Holland at Anfield on December 13 will incorporate the `golden goal' rule. That
means if the two teams are level after 90 minutes, 30 minutes extra time will
be played, with the tie being settled by the first goal scored. A penalty
shoot-out will be used if the teams fail to score during extra time.

<RECORDNO>975323266</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LEEDS manager Howard Wilkinson finally got his man yesterday when Swedish World
Cup star Tomas Brolin signed from Parma for a reported club record fee of #4.5m.
The capture of 25-year-old Brolin ended 10 days of ``will he or won't he''
speculation and months of searching for a top class partner for Ghanaian
striker Tony Yeboah.
Brolin appeared alongside Wilkinson at an Elland Road news conference yesterday
and could make his debut in today's home match against Chelsea.
Wilkinson, who would not discuss Brolin's fee, revealed that the main hurdle in
the signing had been an agreement that the player could leave at the end of
this season.
``Agreement took place four or five days ago,'' said Wilkinson. ``There was
only one sticking point. Tomas wanted an option where if he couldn't deal with
the country he wanted to be able to get out. It's a contract not a prison
sentence.''

PRETORIA on a balmy Sunday in June, when Scotland lost to New Zealand and
exited the World Cup, seems now like a smudgy snapshot from another era.
Today, against Western Samoa at Murrayfield, the action moves back into sharp
focus and a Scottish side containing just eight individuals who wore the
Scotland shirt on that last outing against the All Blacks is charged with the
responsiblity of flying the flag on home territory for the first time since the
spring and of ending the November blight of the past two seasons when New
Zealanders and South Africans contrived to spoil the party.
The first point is that the Samoans may have been World Cup quarter-finalists,
but if Scotland cannot beat the Pacific islanders at Murrayfield - and the
weather is a chilly ally - then the brave, new world of professionalism, even
though the Scottish contracts are not yet signed, will have a hollow ring.
But it will not necessarily be easy. Scotland are without Gavin Hastings, Craig
Joiner, Scott Hastings, Iain Morrison, Eric Peters, Peter Wright, and Kenny
Milne.
Yesterday, the Scottish High Command in the shape of coaching director Jim
Telfer, coaches Richie Dixon and David Johnston and the new captain Rob
Wainwright, were stressing that, even with a much changed line-up, the aim is
to present a continuation of the style of play which took Scotland successfully
through the Five Nations' tournament and, up to a point with success, through
the World Cup campaign.
Telfer noted that, against the Tongans during the World Cup, Scotland had been
faced with the same kind of South Seas aggressive defence and the ability to
conjure something from nothing which will be on show from the Samoans.
The Samoans, though, are better than Tonga whom Scotland disposed of 41-5 in a
bruising encounter in Pretoria. They play hard, intelligent rugby as befits a
side of which the core is schooled in the New Zealand provincial system. They
beat Scotland in Apia two years ago but were defeated by the Scots at
Murrayfield during the 1991 World Cup quarter-final.
On this trip they have lost to North and Midlands but have defeated Edinburgh,
and more significantly, Scotland A. That performance against the Scottish
shadow side indicated what the Samoans are capable of, but the tactical manner
in which North and Midlands disposed of the Samoan second-string was even more
noteworthy from a Scottish viewpoint in that it points the way for Scotland
today.
Yesterday, Wainwright said his side would learn from the general framework of
the North and Midlands victory, basically ensuring that the work was done
properly in first and, just as importantly, second and subsequent phases with
the opposition well tied in before setting the backs off on sallies for the
line.
With Graham Shiel and the mercurial Gregor Townsend in the centre and finishers
like Kenny Logan and Michael Dods (who will be front-line goal-kicker) out
wide, and cap debutant Rowen Shepherd behind, the capacity is there for
devastating attack. Bryan Redpath and Craig Chalmers will not want to waste the
attacking potential outside them.
But with no Ian Jardine or Scott Hastings to provide the defensive power in
midfield should Scotland struggle for possession, as did Scotland A at
Mansfield, then the centre combination who have never played together at this
level before and the back-row cavalry will have to be at their defensive best.
The devastating angles of attack employed by the Samoans are so much more
profitable than those witnessed on the Scottish club scene each weekend and in
this regard, at least, Scotland can look and learn, but hopefully not today.
Backs' coach Johnston indicated yesterday that the Scots will, indeed, be
offensively inclined when he was asked whether the comparative defensive
frailty in midfield - compared that is to the heavy-hitting Samoan attack and
the proven defensive record of Ian Jardine and the non-available Scott Hastings
- caused him to be overly concerned.
``If we picked the best defenders at our disposal then I don't think that we
would win. What we are looking for is balance,'' he declared.
This is a crucially important tour for the Western Samoans. They have lost half
a dozen of their World Cup squad to rugby league and have been frozen out of
the Southern Hemisphere's International Provincial Competition by their
fair-weather friends in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa.
Their coach, the former All Black wing Bryan Williams, said when they arrived
that it was essential they did well so that they could maintain their
hard-earned status as one of the world's top eight sides.
With three new caps in Shepherd, Stuart Reid, and Jim Hay, a new captain in Rob
Wainwright and seven fresh faces from Scotland's last outing in South Africa,
today's match represents something akin to the start of a new era. But that old
imperative of a convincing victory remains top of the agenda.

EARTH, the dictionary says, is ``our planet, home''. Ward is linked to
``guardianship, a sense of care, and also a direction''. These definitions
express precisely the philosophical soil in which Earthward is rooted. It is an
ecological consultancy with environmental purpose. And it is a flourishing
example of how this type of land husbandry can prosper in fertile soil - in
this case in the Borders.
Graham Bell, Earthward's director, is blazing a radical new trail in his
approach to agriculture and the environment, a trail which he believes offers
the only long-term method for managing of the earth's resources. This, he says,
is permaculture.
It is, he explains, a way of designing and creating sustainable environments
and systems. These apply everywhere - from farms and gardens to economic
systems, from community development to energy efficient construction.
The Earthward consultancy was established 18 months ago at Tweed Horizons
Centre for Sustainable Technology at Newtown St Boswells in the Borders, and
here, on the 25-acre site, Bell is practising what he preaches.
There are, he says, 3000 edible plants in the UK, yet only a fraction of them
are cultivated for culinary use. Scotland has vast areas of what could be
described as wet upland desert, yet these impoverished acres could easily be
productive.
Earthward is taking fresh stock of how we look at the environment. Any part of
it can be seen either as a liability or as an asset. Animal waste, for example,
can be a pollutant, or it can increase the soil's fertility; the impoverished
hills and bogs of Scotland can be transformed into productive agro-forests
where the trees improve the soil as well as providing a marketable product.
Bell's vision is of a Scotland regenerated by myriad small, self-sustaining
communities whose inhabitants, like those of Denmark's villages, combine
agricultural as well as industrial functions. And at Earthward, his mission is
to prove it is attainable.
When he took over the grounds at Tweed Horizons they were neglected and
unproductive. Already there has been a transformation. This has been achieved
neither by spending large sums on diggers and other machinery, nor by employing
armies of gardeners.
By covering the ground with biodegradable waste material, and then with a thick
layer of manure, Bell has got the earthworm to do the work for him. The worms
have created a new water-retentive fertile soil structure. And in this
regenerated land Earthward grows a vast range of trial crops.
For, having shown how to re-create productive soil, his next mission is to
prove how many plants, until now considered unsuitable, can be viable and of
economic value. In his mulched beds he is trying out all kinds of fruits and
vegetables, from the almost forgotten Elizabethan medlars, to new and unusual
combinations of grafted fruits and berries - Arctic raspberries, jostaberries,
thornless blackberries and so on - perennial herbs, different kinds of walnuts,
apples, pears and dozens of vegetables.
Finally, he is establishing an agro-forest on a five-acre field. This he hopes
will improve soil fertility as well as provide valuable shelter. Not every
trial plot succeeds. But many do, and valuable lessons are learned from every
experiment.
These trial beds and woodlands are practical demonstrations, scientifically
monitored, of the permaculture philosophy, and Earthward is now able to exploit
them commercially. Bell runs demonstration courses and acts as consultant to
all kinds of organisations which are interested in rural, self-sustaining
regeneration as well as to individuals in need of advice.
He runs training courses in specific skills, such as apple tree grafting, and
students come from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen and the Borders College
to learn the value of the permaculture approach. Earthward is also establishing
links with agricultural colleges in Europe.
In this way, his trailblazing ideas on the benefits of rural regeneration are
already spreading far beyond the Scottish Border. And his solid confidence in
the global significance of permaculture looks like ensuring Earthward will go
from strength to strength.

High-flier is
not guilty party
THE organisational abilities of ScottishPower's publicity services executive
Rachel Sherrard have impressed many since she joined the company earlier this
year. Not only has she coped with a demanding work schedule but she has also
found time to complete an MBA at Strathclyde University. in addition, our
high-flying publicity executive is just seven hours and a written test away
from gaining her pilot's licence.
As if that were not enough, it seems she also pursues a career as a part-time
model. She is, for example, the ``mystery'' professional who appears in posters
and leaflets advertising ScotRail's new Executive Ticket service.
Business Diary readers may recall a little tale we recounted some weeks ago
about ScottishPower's jumbo public relations executive Gordon Laidlaw, who on a
flight between Belfast and Glasgow was requested to shift his then 18st ballast
to aid take off.
We always keep our sources confidential but it appears some people believe
Sherrard, who was Laidlaw's travelling companion at the time, was the guilty
party, which may explain why I received a note during the week about the travel
arrangements she made for friends from all over the UK to join her at a
ScottishPower ceilidh in Glasgow. They arrived early - by a full week! I am
also told many travelled by ScotRail.
Revenge is sweet. Trouble is, I could have sworn it was a male voice who
recounted the Belfast-to-Glasgow weight problem story to me.
A wife's work
is never done
THE cliche that behind every successful man there is a woman may be true, at
least as far as BDO Stoy Hayward is concerned. When it held its annual UK
partners' conference in Brussels last week around 150 partners and their wives
attended, among them eight from Scotland.
The wives joined the partners on a session about the firm's strategy, acting as
expert advisers to the growing business. In addition, the women had a two-hour
session on their own to discuss how BDO should be marketed.
Ian Valentine, the firm's Ayr-based Scottish managing partner, told Business
Diary: ``It was certainly different but all the indications are that they
enjoyed it. Our wives are a very important part of the business - they can help
create the right impression about the company and help with the marketing
effort.''
Painful case
for the defence
IT certainly was not MacRoberts' night when the law firm took part in a
five-a-side football tournament at The Pitz in Townhead, Glasgow, in aid of the
Beatson Institute. The team lost every game, and goalkeeper Craig Turnbull was
so determined to keep the opposition from going into double figures that he
dislocated his shoulder making what colleague Allan Taylor described as a
``brave save''.
The Old Boys Network team belied their name and won the 10-team tournament
beating John Watson, the printing firm, 6-2 in the final. Motherwell star Chris
McHart presented the prizes, and our readers will be glad to know Turnbull is
back at work. He was last heard muttering something about the defence needing
to be tightened up.
Sixties soiree
to help hospice
A GROUP of French tourists admiring the shops in the Buchanan Street precinct
in Glasgow during the week were rather taken aback when confronted by TV travel
man Bryan Burnett dressed as one of their countrymen.
Kitted out in French-style gear and Hercule Poirot moustache, he was
publicising a sixties soiree being held in aid of the Prince &amp; Princess of
Wales Hospice at the Glasgow Moat House Hotel on December 8. The hospice
recently launched an appeal to raise #1.4m to boost its day and home care
provision.
For more details of the soiree, contact Julie Hanson on 0141 429 5599. Palace
sources have assured me that the Princess of Wales will not be trying to sell
the #25 tickets when she appears on Panorama on Monday evening.
Women get into
the network
TWO hundred women turned up for the launch of Lanarkshire Development Agency's
Women into the Network programme, and 100 signed up for the first series of
women-only seminars at the Scottish Enterprise Technology Park in East Kilbride.
The programme was drawn up after the Scottish Enterprise Foundation at Stirling
University carried out a survey to assess women's views of what they needed to
help them into business and what they saw as missing from existing business
start-up programmes. Among the subjects they asked to be included were
assertiveness and motivation.
If you would like more information on Women into the Network, give Lynn
Wilkinson of the LDA a call on 01698 745454.
Argument over
strong words
PR and former Glasgow Lord Provost Michael Kelly has reappeared on the
political scene although this time with a small p. He has been appointed
secretary of the Scottish Industry Forum, a grouping of business people who
support Labour.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson addressed the meeting in the Glasgow
Trades House at which Kelly took up his new duties, and tackled the question of
Labour's plans for a Scottish parliament.
Some wags at the meeting spotted that Roberston was speaking under the Trades
House crest which carries the motto ``Unity is Strength'', and were heard to
suggest that this was rather ironic. However, as any ``old'' Labour supporter
would have told them, this phrase was also a popular slogan of the Labour
movement. In any event, Robertson would argue that by devolving power to
Scotland, the House of Commons would indeed be strengthening the Union.
Worried on a
different score
THE reason I am told that Malcolm McPherson, managing partner of Henderson Boyd
Jackson, is not looking too happy in this photograph is to do not with the
words Sioux Me painted above his head but with the fact that he had just been
told the latest Hibernian score. I'm not exactly certain for which game but his
expression fits what most Hibee fans must have looked like after being beaten
2-0 by Falkirk.

IT WOULD be wrong to compare the career of our own Prince of Wales with the
brief, blighted reign of Edward VIII. Wrong, petty, insensitive, even cruel -
but fun. After all, a family that has prospered so thoroughly from the
fascistic notion of ``breeding'' surely deserves to have its funny little
genetic affinities (not to mention its flirtations with fascism) held up to the
light.
The pity is that the Secret Lives evisceration of the reputation of the Duke of
Windsor (Channel 4, Thursday) was overshadowed by news of Panorama's
participation in Diana's divorce negotiations (``Another ten mil or I really
spill the beans.''). The story of a self-obsessed, morally frail, sexually
rapacious princeling with many political interests and no political sense was
of more import than anything the Frock might have to say, and certainly more
relevant to the monarchy.
The Traitor King stitched Eddie up a treat, nevertheless. Little of it was as
new as some reports would have had you believe - did anyone really believe
Britain's numerous Nazi sympathisers simply repented in 1939? - but the story
was told in such a cool, merciless style that you had to laugh. All those lies,
all that fantasy, all those deeply silly costumes . . .
In brief, the charge was simply that the duke, a fascist by instinct and by
choice, was prepared to sell out his country to Hitler in exchange for the
throne. Because it suited his own book he bought the preposterous Nazi
proposition that Germany should have the run of Europe while Britain retained
its empire. In the process, he probably gave away state secrets and certainly
failed in his duty, such of it as he was capable of recognising.
So far, so predictable.
The flaw in the piece was its casual use and limited understanding of the word
``establishment''. Never properly identified, this vague entity was said to
have decided from the beginning that Wallis Simpson, far from being a nuisance,
would actually be useful in the unseating of Edward, whose pro-German
sympathies and lack of self-discipline were deemed dangerous to the state.
Thus the editor of the Times, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Government
were described as participating in a conspiracy against the King.
Yet the Times, in the thirties, was at least as enthusiastic for fascism as
Edward. The Nazi peace deal he espoused was later put to the war Cabinet and
only rebuffed by Churchill with the support of Attlee's Labour Party -
prominent Tories, some of whom still bewail its rejection, would have accepted
it happily. In other words, ``the establishment'' was never a unity.
Other, smaller details were equally troubling. Pre-Wallis, Edward toured the
colonies bedding squads of district commissioners' wives and, by all accounts,
any other married woman he could lay his hands on. Yet we were also told
(another old story) that Mrs Simpson owed her ability to snare the underendowed
royal to exotic techniques she had picked up in Chinese brothels. At one
moment, in other words, Eddie was a sexual athlete; at the next a sexual
inadequate.
All that said (and we could have done with some comment on the vindictiveness
of the dear old Queen Mum - or are some things still taboo?) this was a damning
essay on Anglo-Saxon attitudes.
It was not Edward who failed but the royal house itself, and by extension a
weird constitutional process that hinges on thick, pompous princes and monarchs
whose only loyalty is to their own survival. Ring any bells? But enough of
sheer nonsense.
Isn't it about time this review put in a word for Due South (BBC1, Tuesday),
the oddly-engaging fable of the Canadian Mountie and the Chicago cop? Certainly
it is, not least in recognition of the fact that the house nine-year-old was
right all along about a show that seemed, at first glance, too wacky for its
own good.
This week's instalment, a ``feature-length'' offering, displayed to advantage a
curious mixture of elements that shouldn't work but somehow does. A comedy
thriller with a solid emotional core, a preposterous hero (Constable Fraser
never tells a lie and always does the Decent Thing) more realistic than the
stock cast of ``realistic cops'', a pet wolf with more brains than Lassie, a
flamboyantly wicked woman, and an Italian-American sidekick who acts as though
he's waiting for the call from Scorsese: how many eggs does a pudding need?
Yet this week Due South attempted a difficult theme - that love is mad, not
blind - while delivering a decent little plot about diamonds and good men
wronged. Well-paced, expertly-shot, and above all strikingly well acted, it put
ITV's The Bill (when will someone summon the nerve to despatch this tired
show?) to shame. It had the courage of its daft convictions, something the
opposition long ago lost.
THE word "lost" also springs to mind when contemplating Rowan Atkinson in The
Thin Blue Line (BBC1, Monday), Ben Elton's lamentable attempt to write a
``classic'' prime-time sit-com. This was Mr Bean Speaks rather than Blackadder
Returns and it was almost partonisingly bad, as though Elton, clever chap that
he is, had decided not to test the audience by offering them anything
resembling a script.
As the commanding officer of a small town police station, Atkinson might have
been expected to play the part with the sort of toughness and sarcasm
appropriate to policemen (and Blackadder). Instead, he preferred to bumble, and
there is nothing, nothing at all, worse in this world than a comic who bumbles.
It becomes like an itch you can't scratch, an irritation that won't pass, an
inducement to scream ``Get on with it!'' at the set.
To be fair, Elton (here sans Richard Curtis, and it showed) gave the star
little to work with. The sight gag and the double entendre have their place,
but comedy does not live by fart jokes alone. Thus Atkinson was reduced to his
funny faces, and if there is one thing the television audience has seen too
much of it is the Atkinson funny face. Still, at least this turkey will give a
hitherto fawning media the chance to realise that Elton isn't as funny as he
thinks we think he is.
Cracking Stories (BBC1, Wednesday) offered a wry, funnyish look behind the
scenes at Edinburgh's Jenners store that became, by extension, a portrait of
the Edinburgh bourgeoisie, their ancient self-regard, their
snobbery-in-mothballs, and their absolute immunity to anything resembling
taste. It was done gently and well, though it overlooked a question: does the
``Harrods of the North'' still subject staff to the humiliation of bag searches
at the end of each working day?

BOB Champion, who rode Aldaniti to success in the 1981 Grand National, made an
emotional return to the winners' enclosure at Aintree yesterday with his first
winner as a trainer at the course.
Pats Minstrel comfortably won the memorial chase from De Jordaan when Clay
County, the odds-on favourite, came to grief at the fourth.
Champion's Pats Minstrel, third three days ago at Wetherby, led from the sixth,
jumped well at Becher's Brook, and left De Jordaan flat footed from the last.
``It has been an ambition - something special to have a winner at Aintree,''
said the trainer.
Kilcolgan, trained in the Borders by Dawn Goodfellow, has his first crack at
the unique Aintree fences today when he lines up in the Becher Chase.
The eight-year-old, successful at Kelso a month ago before finishing fourth to
Emerald Charm two weeks later, is not without a chance in the field of 10.

CRICKET
UMPIRE Cyril Mitchley halted play on day two of the first Test as a spectacular
electrical storm moved ever closer to Centurion Park in Pretoria.
Batsmen Jack Russell and Angus Fraser had been willing to carry on in the murky
light before torrential rain arrived, but Mitchley took the law into his own
hands. As he explained later: ``I've lost two friends to lightning strikes. One
of them was killed on a golf course and the other while playing in a local
league cricket match. I didn't want it to happen again.''
Mitchley had no rule to back him up. But he added: ``I acted under Law 43
(non-existent) - common sense.''
But England were not complaining. ``The umpires were worried, and that's fair
enough,'' commented Russell, whose half-century led the tourists to 381 for
nine.
Ten minutes later, an electrical storm of incredible violence broke over the
ground. Forks of lightning lit up the black sky and the outfield was turned
into a lake almost instantly.
One spectator, armed with an inflatable surf board, skimmed across what had
been grass while others, for reasons best known to themselves, slid for yards
over the plastic covering sheets.
But the upshot was that England had lost two hours' valuable playing time. At
one stage they threatened to waste some of Graeme Hick's superb work, slipping
from 320 for five to 359 for nine, but Russell, in the best batting form of his
life, simply would not let South Africa's bowlers have the last word.
Earlier, Robin Smith's new protective visor, worn following last summer's
facial injury sustained during the Old Trafford Test, was given an early
examination by a wicked Shaun Pollock bouncer. But he had hit one 6 and six 4s
by the time Brian McMillan knocked back his off stump.
Hick's fourth Test century finally ended after lunch on 141 with the
persevering Pollock winning an lbw decision, and Dominic Cork (pulling to
backward square leg), Darren Gough (missing a straight one) and Richard
Illingworth (yorked) followed in quick succession.
McMillan did most of the damage, filling in admirably for Brett Schultz, who
may play no further part in this game because of injury.
Russell, though, would not be shifted - until umpire Mitchley pointed him to
the pavilion for his own safety.

ANOTHER weekend, another big match, another chance for the fiscal? Or are we
getting a touch cynical ? For sure, football people will heave a collective
sigh of relief if the latest high-profile games pass without serious
controversy at Ibrox, where Rangers meet Celtic, and Tynecastle, where Hearts
meet Hibs.
Both of tomorrow's derbies will get the full, high-tech live TV treatment which
can be both blessing and curse but which is not going to disappear. The four
teams are well used to the exposure that entails and certainly, after last
Saturday's happenings, know full well the consequences of stepping out of line.
Neither Old Firm manager appeared too concerned about the possibilities of
misbehaviour. In tandem, Tommy Burns, of Celtic, and Rangers' Walter Smith
pointed out that there has been very little bother at their derbies in the last
few years.
``These games have been notable for their football, nothing else,'' said Smith,
who dismissed reports that Paul Gascoigne was to be sold with Chelsea the
likley buyers, while Burns added: ``Both sets of players are well aware of
their responsibilities but there have been no problems for the last three or
four years.''
Burns added that both clubs understand the pressures they live under,
especially the way it is in Glasgow. He also believes that as the teams play
each other so often this has reduced the ferocity of the rivalry compared to
times past.
For the Celtic manager, the first goal will be vital, but he would like to
think that the advantage the away side seems to have these days will continue.
Smith, naturally, would like the trend to end tomorrow.
Smith will have Brian Laudrup and David Robertson back after lengthy absences,
while Andy Goram also could be in his goalkeeping place again, but he and
Stuart McCall will be checked out this morning. Other news is that Charlie
Miller also will be in the running.
Celtic, too, are in good fettle, with Paul McStay fit again and, after their
victory over Partick Thistle, are within four points of the champions.
Smith said that Gascoigne is fit and available after his midweek game for
England and indicated that new boy Derek McInnes could be in line for a place
on the bench, or even better, depending on fitness checks.
Celtic were off to Seamill, their regular pre-match haunt, but before he left,
Burns once again praised Rangers for the ``phenomenal'' start they had made in
the championship. ``With both teams going well the chances are good that they
will put on a show that gives people what they pay money to watch, good
football.''
That has not been predominant in Edinburgh derbies of recent years but maybe
this will be the one to change it all. Hearts would have looked outsiders by a
long shot a few weeks ago but they have revived with the advent of French
keeper Gilles Rousset, as well as Italian defender Pasquale Bruno and Swedish
striker Hans Eskillsson.
The latter pair have signed until the end of the season. All three will have
had a real indication of what they have let themselves in for by the time the
derby is over, although Hibs are badly hampered by injury.
Keith Wright is out with a hamstring injury and Kevin Harper is almost certain
to miss out because of a shoulder knock. However, Michael O'Neill does not
accept that his team's failure at Falkirk after a good run is an illustration
of the same old failing. ``I wasn't at Falkirk so I don't now what went wrong
but there are too many good players here for it to become a regular habit,'' he
said. ``We have shown that we can bounce back from a disappointment and a derby
would be an ideal time to do it.''
All three of the games scheduled for this afternoon look like tight contests.
Falkirk v Partick Thistle could be a rollicking old tussle at Brockville where
former Thistle manager John Lambie, who tried in vain to persuade Paul Kane to
leave Aberdeen for Falkirk, insists that even if Derek Ferguson, his biggest
buy, had been fit he would not have changed the side that did so well to beat
Hibs.
Thistle, athough beaten, did a lot to please their manager, Murdo MacLeod,
against Celtic but despite this the Firhill manager yesterday moved to add to
his player pool with a #50,000 offer to the Parkhead side for reserve defender
Malky MacKay.
Aberdeen players will know that their Coca-Cola Cup final places will be in
jeopardy if they fall below standards at Stark's Park, which is not the easiest
of places to secure reputations.
Keeper Theo Snelders did well against Rangers last week and seems sure to keep
his place, while Stewart McKimmie and Stephen Glass are fit for selection.
Motherwell travel to Rugby Park on the back of more bad news than good. Four
unnamed players are missing with flu.

IT never rains but it pours for Dunfermline these days, and yesterday another
four players - Brian Rice, Greg Shaw, Norrie McCathie, and Neale Cooper - were
added to the clubs' catalogue of injuries.
Of course, today's opponents, St Johnstone, coming off back-to-back victories,
may be unimpressed by news from East End Park, but Dunfermline manager Bert
Paton was not his usual cheerful self yesterday.
Two Junior players plus a trialist are called into his pool - Stephen Ferguson,
from Rosyth, and John Fraser, from Oakley, as well as 19-year-old Ryan Hegarty,
nephew of Paul. Paton hopes that Finnish internationalist Kari Rissannen will
be available. That may bring a smile to his face.
The big game of the day is the Dundee derby. Jim Duffy's men will wander along
the few hundred yards of Tannadice Street to the opposition's patch.
The only team problem is on the United side, with player-coach Maurice Malpas
facing a fitness test this morning on a groin strain.
Morton manager Allan McGraw is confident that there is life after recent
Rangers signing Derek McInnes, and McGraw could give Craig McPherson the chance
to fill the gap as the Greenock side play hosts to a St Mirren side that is
finally fulfilling the potential claimed by manager Jimmy Bone.
``We are happy the way things are going,'' he said. ``I've always said it would
take time, and now we are beginning to deliver the goods.''
McGraw's big problem is whether or not to alter a defensive midfield set-up
which has lost only one goal - from a penalty - in five games. ``I'll think
about it overnight.''
Bottom club Hamilton must try to gain ground at Firhill against an Airdrie side
who have not been setting the first division heather on fire, while Clydebank
travel to Boghead to try to forget last week's drubbing by Dunfermline.
That defeat may see positional and personnel changes by the Bankies, for whom
striker Ken Eadie should return.

GOLF
FOR a man with money on his mind, the Australian Peter Senior played carefree
golf yesterday in the second round of the Dunlop Phoenix tournament in Japan,
writes Margaret McMaster.
He scorched round in 64, equalling the course record, with six birdies, an
eagle and only one bogey. It gave him a 133 aggregate, nine under par, and left
him two clear of Robert Gamez and three ahead of eight players, including
holder Jumbo Ozaki, Barry Lane, and Tom Watson. ``That's the best I've putted
all year,'' said Senior, who uses a broomhandle job. ``I had only 27 putts and
they were all uphill.''
A bit of a wheeler-dealer in between golf, Senior has a sound business sense.
on Monday a company called Cash Converters, in which the Australian has a
sizeable interest, goes public. Senior was looking forward to being paid a sum
not far short of seven figures in US dollars. Not bad for an initial investment
of around #150,000. Leading scores (Japanese unless stated):
133 - P Senior (Australia) 69, 64.
135 - R Gamez (USA) 66, 69.
136 - H Sasaki 69,67; N Serizawa 69, 67; B Jobe (USA) 69, 67; M Kuramoto 68,
68; L Nelson (USA) 68, 68; T Watson (USA) 66, 70; M Ozaki 65, 71; B Lane
(England) 64, 72.
Other scores included: 137 - L Mize (USA) 66, 71. 138 - V Singh (Fiji) 68, 70.
139 - C Parry (Australia) 69, 70. 141 - M Campbell (New Zealand) 72, 69; M A
Jimenez (Spain) 70, 71; E Els (S Africa) 68, 73.
q SAM Torrance shot four birdies on the back nine for a two-under-par 69 in the
Hong Kong Open yesterday when he was in danger of missing a cut for only the
second time this year. The Scot has a halfway total of 140, eight behind leader
Rafael Alarcon of Mexico. ``If you knew how bad it feels to miss a cut you
would realise that the impetus (to play better) is easy,'' said Torrance. ``To
win now I'll have to shoot successive 66s.''
Alarcon added a 67 to his first-round 65 for a three-shot lead over Taiwan's
Yeh Chang-ting. Leading scores:
132 - R Alarcon (Mexico) 65, 67.
135 - Y Chang-ting (Taiwan) 67, 68.
136 - F Casas (Philippines) 72, 64; A Cruse (S Africa) 69, 67.
Other score: 140 - S Torrance (Scotland) 71, 69.
q LAURA Davies again struggled as Sweden's Annika Sorenstam opened up a
three-shot lead yesterday in the second round of the Australian Masters at the
Royal Pines on the Gold Coast.
Davies, bidding to win the event for the third year in a row, followed her
opening 72 with a 70 to trail Sorenstam by eight. Leading scores (Australians
unless stated):
134 - A Sorenstam (Sweden) 66, 68.
137 - S Williams 68, 69.
138 - L Neumann (Sweden) 66, 72; A Nicholas (England) 68, 70.
139 - C Nilsmark (Sweden) 69, 70.
140 - K Webb 68, 72.
Other scores included: 141 - K Orum (Denmark) 68, 73. 142 - M Madill (Ireland)
70, 72; C Hjalmarsson (Sweden) 70, 72; K Lunn 67, 75; L Davies (England) 72, 70.
q TOM Kite and partner Jay Haas and Mark Calcavecchia and Steve Elkington both
shot eight-under-par 64s to share the lead after the first round of the
#730,000 Shark Shootout at Thousand Oaks, California. The 54-hole tournament
features 10 two-man teams using a different format each day. The first round
was played under a modified alternate shot format, the second will be better
ball, and the third a scramble. Scores (American unless stated):
64 - T Kite and J Haas, M Calcavecchia and S Elkington (Australia).
65 - G Norman (Australia) and R Floyd, L Janzen and C Beck.
66 - P Jacobsen and A Palmer, T Lehman and D Duval.
67 - H Irwin and B Lietzke.
68 - F Couples and B Faxon.
69 - F Zoeller and J Daly, C Strange and M O'Meara.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
CLACH, who play Elgin today, have won the race to sign striker Norman
MacMillan.
They are believed to have payed Caledonian Thistle #5000 for the youngster,
nicknamed Stormin' Norman because of his pace.
Forres travel to play Wick Academy, who are adopting an air of invincibility on
their home territory.
Recent form has pushed the club into seventh place in the league, and none of
their rivals relish the long trip north.
In contrast, Forres are propping up the table with Nairn on six points. With
County entertaining Huntly little change can be expected.
Cove Rangers must overcome on-form Deveronvale, while Keith, beaten Qualifying
Cup finalists, face Lossiemouth with both teams tied in fourth place on 20
points. Peterhead will stay third if they can beat Buckie Thistle away from

SOUND Man looks the sound choice for the First National Gold Cup at Ascot this
afternoon.
This race has been won six out of nine times by a horse with a previous run,
which gives him an edge over rivals who nearly all make their seasonal debut.
The Irish raider proved his class with a close second in the Arkle Chase when
Camitrov, Dancing Paddy, and Morceli finished well behind.
The form of that run was confirmed on Thursday, when the winner, Klairon
Davies, scored on his reappearance, and Sound Man can give it another boost
today.
Bas de Laine would have won at Wincanton had that race been over today's trip,
and was unlucky to be caught in the closing strides that day.
He has now turned in two impressive second places since returning from a long
lay-off, and should go one better in the Gardner Merchant Chase.
On past form, Garrison Savannah and Sibton Abbey will need this run, the first
of their seasons, but Run Up The Flag is a danger. He won over course and
distance at this meeting last year and had a creditable prep-run a fortnight
ago.
Young Hustler was well fancied for each of the last two Grand Nationals but
failed to complete on either occasion.
That was hardly his fault, however, as he was brought down last year, while
this year his unfortunate jockey was unseated by a fractional jumping error.
Given better luck, Young Hustler, whose jumping is usually faultless, can
outclass his rivals in Aintree's Becher Chase over the national course.
The ground should be just right for him and he is used to the kind of burden
which he is set to carry here.
Sue Bramall's Veleda can chase him home.
Mister Drum appeals as the value in the Stanley Leisure Hurdle.
After a cosy win in a competitive Cheltenham Handicap last December, the grey
was highly tried without success for the rest of the season.
He should be the better for a promising reappearance behind Silver Groom,
whereas Keep Your Distance runs well when fresh and will not be helped by his
recent run.

THAT American aptitude for the felicitous phrase became clear once again the
other evening as a collection of the well-heeled and influential gathered in
the fashionable heart of New York for what that energetic nation calls a Power
Party.
The connotation is one of raising money and spreading the news - and the
beneficiary on this splendid occasion was none other than the image of Scotland
and the part this modest-sized nation played in the early development of a vast
continent.
The story of Scotland and the Americas is such a neglected one that the famous
John Carter Brown Library of Rhode Island decided to do something about it.
It mounted an exhibition, published a book, and arranged a series of gala
receptions and lectures with the intention of giving the Scots, as a distinct
nation, due credit for the quite remarkable role they played in the Atlantic
culture of the period between 1600 and 1800.
In this spirit of goodwill and recognition of a small country, we had come to
the prestigious Forbes Magazine Gallery on Fifth Avenue, itself the home of
treasures which include the priceless Faberge Eggs, and marvelled at the vast
array of books, maps, and prints which have been preserved by the John Carter
Brown Library.
When the exhibition had been sampled through an hour of cocktails, I joined in
a sponsors' dinner (the guests had coughed up no less than $250 per head),
feeling rather moved that the historians of a nation which can sometimes
overlook the rest of the world had bothered to pay this tribute to Scotland.
The fact that the Royal Bank of Scotland now owns a major bank in Rhode Island
would not have discouraged the enterprise - but this was no time for cynicism.
Around me were influential figures of American life whose very presence lent
weight to the occasion. At my elbow, for example, was the fabulously wealthy
Mrs Drue Heinz, who was just one of 57 or more varieties.
On my other side was the charming Anne Cox, whose Scottish family became huge
landowners in America and whose lawyer son is married to Tricia Nixon, daugher
of the former President ``We all spent a wonderful Christmas at the White
House,'' she told me.
John Carter Brown, namesake and great-grandson of the library founder, was also
there and the rest of the company included Scots-born Manhattan lawyer Alan
Bain, president of the American-Scottish Foundation; Mimi Mead, stepdaughter of
the late Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton, once a prominent New York Scot; Peter
Innes, director of British Information Services in New York; and Candy van
Allen, whose late husband, James, was not only a member of the Vanderbilt
family but found a solution to the over-long tennis match by introducing the
tie-break.
The dinner was being hosted by two of the Forbes brothers, Timothy and Bobby.
And all of this, in a strange way, was to symbolise a drift of good fortune
towards the name of Scotland.
The John Carter Brown director and librarian, Norman Fiering, confessed that,
when they started planning the exhibition in 1992, they were unaware of certain
factors which would prove more than helpful to the image of Scotland.
For example, they knew nothing of the forthcoming films, Rob Roy and
Braveheart, which have done so much for Scotland's name in America. And, though
they had planned to stage the exhibition in the Forbes Galleries, they could
not have guessed that the head of that Scottish family enterprise, Stephen
Forbes, would be seeking the Republican nomination for the 1996 Presidential
Election.
For once, it seemed, the fates were conspiring to give Scotland a much-needed
break, in a land where the power of the vast Irish lobby is hard to match.
Fiering and his staff had already arranged a series of gala receptions, at
which American audiences have had a chance to learn about the Scottish
involvement in the colonial period of America. They have been listening, for
example, to distinguished academics on subjects like ``The Cult of the Celt and
the Kilt in Scotland'' and ``The Highland Warrior in American Colonial Wars''.
The Director of the National Galleries of Scotland, Timothy Clifford, is in New
York this week talking about Scottish art. By coincidence, the pipes and drums
of the Black Watch were joining the massed bands of the Household Cavalry in a
musical spectacular at Madison Square Garden, marking the 50th anniversary of
the Second World War coming to an end.
Intertwined in all this, the American-Scottish Foundation was preparing for its
St Andrew's Day reception, at which the guest-of-honour will be Scots author
Roddy Martine.
And, as it happened, it was also staging an inaugural American showing of my
own documentary film about that great Cunarder, the Queen Mary, which gave me
the chance to face an audience full of enthusiasm for the story of Clydeside
and the great ships it once built for the world.
Yet again by coincidence, however, it was another Herald writer, Michael Fry,
who set the ball a-rolling for that celebration of Scotland's role in the
development of America.
As well as writing his column in this newspaper, the Oxford-educated Fry is a
distinguished historian, much admired in the United States. He became involved
in the current project during his time as a visiting scholar at the John Carter
Brown Library, which is based on the campus of Brown University at Rhode Island
and has a long record of collecting primary historical sources about America
before 1825.
It fell to Fry to write the introduction and one of the chapters in the new
book on Scotland and the Americas - and to address that distinguished gathering
at the Forbes Galleries.
So what is this story which stirred a leading academic institution to the point
of a major American exhibition? For a start, as we know well, the Scots had a
reputation as tradesmen and merchants, educators and religious leaders,
political administrators and agricultural immigrants and, most famously in the
mid-eighteenth century, we had a brilliant intellectual elite in Glasgow and
Edinburgh which included those giants of our history, David Hume and Adam Smith.
Every political or religious crisis in Scotland through the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries sparked off an emigration to America. Scottish settlements
in Nova Scotia and New Jersey are perhaps the best-known communities and the
presence of the Scottish tobacco traders in the region of Chesapeake Bay is
also well documented.
However, the scholars of today are now giving more attention to the
significance of the Scots in places like Georgia and the Carolinas, Florida,
Jamaica, and Barbados. There they could be found as planters, clergymen,
officials, merchants, soldiers, and in many other roles.
At least seven colonial governors were Scottish - Virginia's Spotswood,
Dinwiddie, and Dunmore were most notable - and our race was serving as
foot-soldiers and officers in the French and Indian War as well as on both
sides during the War for Independence.
The Americans are being reminded more and more about the Scottish influence on
their education. On a personality level, Thomas Jefferson was just one of their
famous sons to be educated by a Scottish tutor.
Graduates of our universities were prominent in the early establishment of many
American colleges, including Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, and
many distinguished American physicians of the time went to Edinburgh for their
training.
With the settlement of Virginia and the need for a college there, it fell to
Aberdeen graduates, headed by James Blair, a clergyman and graduate of
Marischal College, to lead in the formation of what became the highly
prestigious College of William and Mary at Williamsburg.
That debt was widely acknowledged this year when the current principal of
Aberdeen University was accorded an honorary degree, appropriately at a time
when Aberdeen was celebrating the 500th anniversary of its university.
When Michael Fry worked at the John Carter Brown Library in 1993-94, he was
astonished and delighted to find the richness of the library's holdings in that
field of early Scottish-American relations.
He put his audience right on certain matters: ``When Americans think of
Scotland today, they probably think first of colourful traditions, chiefs and
clans, kilts and tartans, dancing and bagpipes, the things they are likely to
see at any Highland Games in the United States.
``These actually form only a small part of our national life, and historically
not a very authentic part: most are the products of Victorian romanticism.
While enjoyable enough, they have unfortunately tended to obscure more serious
aspects of Scottish history and the deeper connection between our small country
and the great continents of the New World.
``To appreciate these, we must step back in time, to the centuries before
anyone thought of inventing synthetic heritages, when America was still being
formed and when Scotland's genuine traditions vigorously flourished.''
Fry recalled that the Scots and Americans spent almost three-quarters of a
century together as members of the British Empire, from the Union of 1707 till
the Revolutionary War.
They had much in common as imperial provinces trying to define their
relationship to the English metropolis. Nevertheless, their experience produced
opposite results.
Though most Scots originally opposed the Union, they became steadily more
attached to it, especially to the economic system in which it placed them. The
Americans, though for long sharing a pride in British expansion, grew away from
the mother country till they decided to sever their connection with it.
``It is in the light of this paradox,'' said Fry, ``that Scottish reaction to
the American Revolution must be judged.''
Most Scots thought the Americans were in the wrong but, in private, our two
leading philosophers, David Hume and Adam Smith, sympathised with their
grievances.
To Hume it was clear that the colonies, since their foundation, had developed
into moral communities, bound to take a course of their own no longer amenable
to control from England. Since it was best to accept this reality, he wrote in
a letter to a friend: ``I am an American in my principles.''
The great Adam Smith was not so forthright but did make his position clear when
the crisis of Anglo-American relations broke just as he was about to bring out
his famous work, The Wealth of Nations, in 1776.
In that, he said the Americans should either be fully integrated into the
British political system with representation in Parliament - in which case the
seat of the Empire might in time be transferred across the Atlantic - or they
should be set free altogether.
No mention of Scottish involvement in the Americas can overlook the Darien
scheme of 1698-1700 when we attempted to establish a colony and trading-base on
the isthmus of Panama.
This was the brainchild of William Paterson from Dumfriesshire, better known as
the intellectual godfather of the Bank of England, who regarded the Darien
scheme as the most important project of his life.
However, it ran into opposition from both England and Spain and illustrated
Scotland's difficulties after the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when she became
increasingly subordinated to her larger neighbour.
The Darien scheme ended in disaster, costing Scots investors the huge sum of
#400,000 and almost bankrupting the country. It also played a large part in
ending Scottish independence, brought about by the Union of Parliaments in 1707.
So the highly significant role of the Scots in the making of America is being
trumpeted across that continent. And one man who is delighted is 59-year-old
Alan Bain, Manhattan corporate lawyer, businessman, and patriotic exile who is
president of the American-Scottish Foundation.
The foundation, created in 1956 by Lord and Lady Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton,
promotes contact between the two countries on a broad base and Bain gives much
of his time to fostering its activities.
``One of my aims,'' he said, ``is to revive the Wallace Award, which fell into
abeyance but used to honour Americans of Scottish descent who had made a
significant contribution to society.
``The Scots are a fair-minded people who integrated well into American society.
I think it is important to raise the Scottish profile in America. After all, it
is not a bad profile to raise, is it?''

THE Queen Mother was on her feet yesterday for the first time since undergoing
a hip replacement operation on Thursday.
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ``We understand that she took a couple of
steps this morning.''
Earlier, the palace said the Queen Mother, 95, would be having a quiet day
following the operation, and not seeing visitors for the time being.
But it was thought she might be able to attempt one or two steps near her bed.
This is normal procedure for hip replacement patients, who need to be mobile as
quickly as possible to avoid complications.
A bulletin released by Buckingham Palace yesterday, said: ``Queen Elizabeth The
Queen Mother had a good night and has been seen by doctors this morning.
``It is hoped that Queen Elizabeth will sit up in bed for a short time and
possibly take a few steps today.
``On doctors' advice the Queen Mother is having another quiet day of rest and
recuperation, and will not be receiving visitors for the time being.''
The hospital has been inundated with flowers and goodwill messages for the
Queen Mother, who is one of the oldest patients ever to have undergone the
operation.
Meanwhile, the BBC yesterday performed a quick about-turn over plans to rush
release Panorama's Princess of Wales interview as a Christmas video.
BBC Worldwide Enterprises managing director, Mr Nicholas Chapman, said no
decision about release had been made - just three hours after a #12.99 video
had been announced by other members of his staff.
Corporation video chiefs had been unable to view the programme - which is under
lock and key amid unprecedented security to prevent leaks. Until they have seen
it, no decision could be taken, Mr Chapman said.
Only eight people, among them director general John Birt, have seen the
interview tape, which is being edited into a one-hour programme by reporter
Martin Bashir. BBC Video staff will see the eagerly awaited interview on Monday
night with everybody else.
Whether or not a video is eventually produced, the BBC stands to make
considerably more than #1m through overseas sales alone. ABC News has paid an
unconfirmed one million dollars, or #642,000, for first screening rights in the
US, and deals have been clinched with more than a dozen other countries.
But the BBC has scotched suggestions that some of the programme proceeds should
go to charity. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: ``The programme has been
financed by BBC licence payers, and it is only fair they should get the
benefit.''
A Panorama spokeswoman confirmed that no money had been offered to any of the
Princess's charitable causes for the interview. ``We did not pay either the
Princess or charity any money,'' she said.
A spokeswoman for Carlton said all profits after costs of its Prince of Wales
documentary, carried out by Jonathan Dimbleby last year, were given to the
Prince of Wales Charities Trust.

A DRAW is a common, and often acceptable, result for a local derby, but the men
in charge of the home sides will not be thinking that way today - least of all
Stranraer manager Alex McAnespie.
He has seen his men draw seven of their 13 league fixtures, a habit which could
scupper their promotion hopes. Stranraer were relegated with Ayr last season
and, of the two, have better prospects of a quick return.
``We did well against Ayr last season,'' said McAnespie, who has stability in
his team. Ayr's Gordon Dalziel, in contrast, is still tearing his hair out as
he tries to build up his playing strength.
Leaders East Fife, surprisingly, have begun to draw their home matches, but for
which they would be even further ahead. Today they are hosts to Stenhousemuir,
and can expect to have to work hard.
Berwick entertain lowly Queen of the South. Home manager Tom Hendrie would have
pencilled this in as a possible three-pointer - until the plague of injuries
which has hit his club, while Clyde's meeting with Stirling Albion at Broadwood
could be the most entertaining match in the second division. Forfar will hope
to keep neighbours, Montrose, still winless after their visit to Links Park.
Ross County have signed Clach's Stuart Golabeck in time for the Highland derby
at Dingwall against Caley Thistle, a fixture that would have been expected to
attract the largest crowd of the 10 games in the third division.
However, that gate may be surpassed by another contest in the basement, that
between leaders, Livingston and Cowdenbeath.
Almondvale Stadium was overflowing last week and another capacity crowd of 4000
is expected for today's official opening against the Fifers.
The 'Shire visit Alloa, Arbroath entertain Brechin in the Angus derby, and
Albion Rovers will be trying not to add to their tally of six red cards so far
when they visit Queen's Park at Hampden.

SCOTRAIL managers are close to breaking point over their inability to run
trains as scheduled because of the Government's drive towards rail
privatisation.
They are furious that Railtrack equipment failures, outwith ScotRail's control,
led to delays of up to three hours for rush-hour passengers on two of
Scotland's main commuter routes - Glasgow-Edinburgh and Edinburgh-Dunblane - on
Thursday.
ScotRail director John Ellis apologised in a letter issued to customers
yesterday for the ``havoc'' caused by power and signalling faults at Polmont,
near Falkirk.
However, senior colleagues in the train operating company expressed outrage
that ScotRail was being pilloried by customers for the delays. They are
questioning whether Railtrack is worth the #175m a year paid for access to
lines.
The ScotRail officials fear its money is not going towards maintaining track
equipment to the levels required to keep the railway system fully operational.
They also suspect Railtrack did not react as quickly as it should to the
breakdowns because ScotRail had paid for services in advance, and expressed
concern over alleged delays in letting controllers know about the faults.
Chains of command have been altered since ScotRail and Railtrack became
separate entities under BR's break-up.
ScotRail is likely to seek compensation for delays to 24 trains during
Thursday's rush hour, on grounds that the service paid for was not supplied.
One source said of its increasingly fraught relationship with Railtrack: ``As
the train operator, we are its customer, in the same way that the passenger on
the platform is ours.
``You would be miffed if driving to work you found the roads were full of
potholes or closed because they had not been gritted.
``But our customers only see `the railways' and are not interested in who is
responsible for delays. Our members took it on the chin from them.''
Ironically, the equipment failures coincided with the Rail Users' Consultative
Committee for Scotland (RUCCS) declaring in its annual report that the split
between ScotRail and Railtrack was diverting money, time, and effort away from
improving services and infrastructure.
Yesterday, the committee called on Railtrack to institute ``the most searching
inquiry'' into what happened on Thursday and claimed passengers were not only
delayed but found it difficult to get information about what was happening.
ScotRail director Mr Ellis said in his letter to passengers that the delays
were caused by a fault in the external power supply to Polmont signalling
centre and the failure of the railway's back-up supply.
One train was held up for 178 minutes, while the Glasgow to Edinburgh train was
175 minutes late, despite Railtrack's ``strenuous endeavours'' to restore the
signalling system.
Mr Ellis said these delays were ``totally unacceptable'' to ScotRail, as they
were to its customers.
Railtrack said a full investigation into the cause of the disruption would
start on Monday, with British Rail being asked to participate as the scope of
the inquiry would include all aspects of how the situation was handled.
Railtrack said it was not known if the signalling power failure at Polmont was
directly related to a ScottishPower supply failure minutes earlier but this
would form an important part of the investigation.
Railtrack Scotland's director, Mr Paul Prescott, who also apologised to
affected travellers, said the power failure occurred at the very worst time of
day adding that, at one point, 10 trains were trapped on the Glasgow-Edinburgh
line.
A Railtrack spokeswoman later rejected suggestions that the infrastructure was
not being properly maintained and said: ``We are doing our very best to keep
Britain's rail network in good shape.''
She added: ``The money that ScotRail pay is pre-agreed and covers what we
agreed it costs to have the railway for that period.
``But it is important to remember that you don't pay for what you don't get -
ie, the variable costs, the actual trains you run. If you don't get the trains,
you don't pay.''
She also dismissed allegations of delays in Railtrack informing ScotRail of the
problems and said such delays were impossible because controllers from
Railtrack and ScotRail sat next to each other in the rail control room in
Glasgow.
Ms Helen Millar, the RUCCS's new chairman, said yesterday that the problems
reinforced the need for a ``compact integrated organisation'' to run Scotland's
railways and the need for investment.
Labour's Shadow Transport Minister Brian Wilson said it was ``absolutely
outrageous'' that delays of this scale were occurring.
He said: ``There appears to have been a complete breakdown of communication,
which is what happens in a fragmented railway.
``The uncertainty of privatisation has created a blight in investment
throughout the railway network and, if Railtrack was sold off, there would
still be no incentive for them to invest.''

TODAY
A WEEK IN POLITICS (C4) - A Saturday night politics programme that runs head to
head against Noel's House Party and Blind Date, who'll give me an audience of
20?  No. 15? OK, 10? Done! Sold to the woman with the blue suit who used to run
the country. It's worthwhile tuning in to Vincent Hanna and Andrew Rawnsley's
``witty irreverent'' look at the political classes just to join such a select,
exclusive (and small) band of viewers. No doubt, politicians with no family
life will demonstrate their inability to govern, while offering parents an
opportunity to spite their kids. ``No Sally, you watched Cilla, last week.''
CASUALTY (BBC1) - The programme for people who abhor violence on television but
dig patients having fits, bleeding to death, and those pornographic minutes
while an accident just waits to happen. This week travellers Evie and Jim are
devastated when their baby daughter breaks her leg. Yet, once in casualty, Evie
discovers that her own condition is a great deal more serious, something she
has kept a secret. Watch and weep.
PRIEST (BBC2) - Brilliant. A Catholic priest (Linus Roache) arrives to work in
Liverpool. He must cope with his own homosexuality and the impotent knowledge,
obtained in the confessional that a young girl is being sexually abused by her
father. And it is a combination which will crack him.
Jimmy McGovern's film is a masterpiece to move you to tears; compassionate,
questioning and ultimately uplifting. Mass, the following morning, for members
of the faith, will take on a deeper meaning and for its practitioners, a
greater respect.
TOMORROW
WITNESS: THE LIE DETECTORS (C4) - Lies in all their shades and sizes are
explored by three private investigators. The doyennes of fibs include
74-year-old Zena Scott Archer who compares the death's-head hawk moth - which
tricks its way into a bee hive to steal honey - with humans. A second detective
explores matrimonial deception and how to exact a fitting revenge. ``There's a
certain very mean pleasure that comes with telling a lie and getting away with
it.'' While former MI5 operative Gary Murray explores the daily deception of
Britain's secret services. I suppose, they could tell us the truth, but what if
they then had to kill us?
THE CLOTHES SHOW (BBC1) - The Bride of the Year is chosen, but will she wear
white? Purity isn't actually on the list of criteria to be weighed up by Caryn
Franklin and her team of judges as they work out who'll get the freebie. My bet
will be on the best looker or the one in the wheelchair. Elsewhere, Jeff Banks
wanders around then talks excitedly about charity buys, while Ms Franklin
reappears to quiz weather-girl Sian Lloyd on her collection of macs and
umbrellas; as predictable as rain on the Fair fortnight.
MONDAY
Film 95 (BBC1) - What does Barry think of the new Bond movie? Bazza's face may
now resemble one of his crumpled pullovers, but his critical skills remain as
sharp as a Bupa surgeon's scalpel. Steady with the first incision, Barry, the
patient must pull through! Will Goldeneye come up with the carats or will Barry
do what Blowfeld never could? Also under the knife is Basketball Diaries
starring Leonardo Di-Caprio while director Rob Reiner talks about The American
President - the movie. Nobody wants to be seen with the real thing!
Cracker (STV) - Fitz starts getting anonymous love letters from a woman who
thinks he is perfect. Simple enough to solve. To the blind asylum, Penhaligan,
and don't spare the blue flashing lights! Yet the most popular telly programme
today has never been about whodunnit, but whytheydidit. But as this is the last
ever story in a popular cop show which has already killed two lead characters,
the question has to be - just who is next!
PORKPIE (C4) - It could be you! It could be Porkpie Grant! In fact it was. The
penniless pensioner, lollipop man and former regular at Desmond's barbershop is
the lucky man with the six magical numbers. But just how can he cope with
spending his new - found wealth? The death last year of Desmond's star Norman
Beaton plunged fans into mourning, Ram John Holder as Porkpie might just bring
them back.
TUESDAY
NAKED (C4) - The kind of film that leaves you to crawl to bed on your belly.
Bleak, depressing, but shot through with a bizarre humour which can only come
from the magic tricks of director Mike Leigh. Johnny (David Thewlis) is the
homeless anti-hero, a monster with a heart which beats but occasionally, as he
prowls the streets of London. One scene in which he meets a drugged up young
Scots lad looking for his girlfriend, is simply breathtaking.
THE ART MARATHON (BBC2) - Just who the hell is all this art being created for?
The Derry group seek answers to this important question as they quiz the artist
Anthony Gormley who plans to erect a monumental steel angel over a hill outside
Gateshead, but hasn't asked the public what they think. ``You're saying it's
not a collective work in so far as people who live here haven't had a say in
what it looks like - well, quite right they haven't,'' said Mr Gormley. Oh,
charming!
SOLDIER, SOLDIER (STV) - The King's Own Fusiliers are being shipped out to
South Africa, so after Colette wins at bingo she persuades Joe that Cape Horn
would be the setting for their wedding and asks Donna to be her bridesmaid. Can
she make it? What about the offer as a backing dancer on TOTP to promote the
lads' best-selling single? We haven't seen so much drama since Manuel left
Fawlty Towers to ask ``Whatzamatter You!''
WEDNESDAY
THE HUNGER ARTIST (C4) - It may be tucked away deep in the darkness of the
graveyard shift but Bernard Rudin's wonderful short film is well worth the
wait. Adapted from a Kafka short story, a journalist goes in search of a
professional faster, an artist who starves himself to earn a living. The
50-minute film was critically acclaimed at this year's Edinburgh Film Festival
(winning a coveted Herald Angel) and this showing marks its television
premiere. Another Scottish triumph.
n.007.......The Return (STV) - Bond is back! All hail the tuxedoed one! You
could waste 100 words on ``shaken not stirred'' descriptions of Pierce
Brosnan's reinvention of the world's most famous spy in Goldeneye. Or explain
how it was a life-long ambition to drive an Aston Martin in a high-speed chase.
But it is a lot nicer to simply say: ``Welcome back!'' Mariella Frostrup does
just that at the British premier, showing teasing clips from the new cracker
and the classics it should live up to.
MODERN TIMES: MAN SEEKS WOMAN (BBC2) - It was always said that a woman over the
age of 40 had more chance of being killed by a terrorist than finding marriage.
It wasn't true. But it felt true. However in Britain today it's the single men
who have the problems. Susanna White's film follows three men and their
fortunes on a string of dates. Pete aka The Italian Stallion lives in a bed-sit
in Slough but owns a Ferrari, Porsche, and TVR in a bid to woo the women. Sad,
sad, man!
THURSDAY
SECRET LIVES: EDWARD VIII - THE TRAITOR KING (C4) - Royalties dirty laundry
chokes up drain as a documentary crew continue their investigations into the
shameful truth about Edward, Duke of Windsor, a renowned supporter of fascism.
This week's programme answers the following intriguing questions: Was he guilty
of treason? What was his relationship to Hitler and how was he involved in the
fall of France? The case for republicanism rises from this programme like a
prime-time advert.
THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE (STV) -- Superb slasher movie which casts
Rebecca De Mornay as the nanny from hell. A gynaecologist commits suicide after
he is accused of sexual abuse by his patients. His young widow decides to track
down and destroy the woman who was his first accuser, working her way into
their lives as the nanny. See, money doesn't make you happy, that'll teach them
to look after their own weans.
n.REDCAPS: BLOOD, BEER AND TEARS (BBC1) - The adventures of the Royal Military
Police take a nasty turn when two soldiers and a civilian are attacked by a
group of young men and ``glassed''. Cpl Horne staggers to the nearby medical
centre literally holding his face back on. Question: what was the TV crew doing
at this point? Answer: Running after him, salivating. Still, all makes good
telly, doesn't it?
FRIDAY
CHILDREN IN NEED (BBC1) - THE BBC's Children in Need returns for its 16th
television marathon and Terry Wogan has been exercising his vocal chords in
preparation for seven hours of live music, entertainment and fund raising for
the BBC's own charity. Joining him on the show will be, for the first time,
Gaby Roslin from The Big Breakfast. While stalwarts such as Rolf Harris, Frank
Bruno and Annabel Giles lend a hand.
The music this year includes Wet, Wet, Wet (Am I legally allowed to say that?),
Chris De Burgh, Supergrass and Tucker and Garvey from Soldier, Soldier. Even
our Tel will be performing a version of his 1978 hit, The Floral Dance, oh, we
can hardly wait. Still it's nice to be nice, so dig out your wallets and
pledge, pledge, pledge. Excuses such as: ``We already buy lottery tickets''
will not be accepted. Especially not from Anthea Turner.
NOT THE NINE O'CLOCK NEWS (BBC2) - A chance to see the best sketches from the
sharp-edged satirical show which launched the careers of Rowan Atkinson, Griff
Rhys Jones, Mel Smith and Pamela Stephenson. Hang on, Pamela Stephenson, what
career? Being Mrs Billy Connelly doesn't count. This should be a novelty for
all the students of comedy who were kids in 1979 and so were sent to bed before
the show even started. Well, what goes around, comes around and those great
gags have been recycled ever since.
EUROTRASH (C4) - The Word is dead! Long live Eurotrash! Just when you thought
bad taste had been skelped on the bottom by the ITC and send to bed without any
supper, those lovable masters of dirty nonsense and the most French men you
will ever meet return. Antoine De Caunes and Jean-Paul Gaultier ignore all
their salacious views of European porn starlets to travel to Japan as part of
world tour. Here they encounter a restaurant that specialises in aphrodisiacal
dishes made from animal genitals and meet the weather girl who gives the
forecast wearing a metal bikini and bunny ears. Now that's what I call
television.

THE last time Mrs Carol Wardell was seen alive by her building society
colleagues was on the doorstep of her house standing with her arms around her
husband, who is now accused of her killing.
Mr Gordon Wardell, 42, of Bonneville Close, Meriden, Warwickshire, denies
murdering the 39-year-old Woolwich mangeress at their home and then faking a
robbery at the branch where she worked in September last year.
Colleague and close friend June O'Connell told Oxford Crown Court she and her
husband last saw Mrs Wardell when they left the couple's home after a small
dinner party on the night before she was allegedly killed.
She said the foursome had spent an enjoyable evening and there was no obvious
friction between the Wardells.
She said: ``We left around 11pm. Carol and Gordon stood together at the front
door with their arms around one another.''
It was not until the Monday morning that Mrs Wardell's body was found in a
lay-by on the A444, two miles from Nuneaton.
Motorists told police they did not stop because they thought the body was a
shop window dummy. Mr Peter Beard told the court he initially thought the same
but after pulling into the lay-by he realised it was a body.
Police and ambulance crews were alerted and leading paramedic Andrew Golds said
rigor mortis had already set in.
A police officer at the scene, Inspector Roger Price, noticed a sling-back
sandal near Mrs Wardell's left foot. When he was later called to the suspected
bank raid, he noticed the matching sandal in the branch and made the connection
between the two scenes.
The prosecution claim Wardell planted the sandal.
The trial continues.

n WITHOUT a doubt it's an RAC ET phone home emergency mobile phone. I do quite
a bit of driving on my own and I used to drive quite an old Volvo with a dodgy
carburettor, so it's been invaluable. It has a special RAC button that puts you
right through and a 999 button for other emergencies. For someone like me who
drives to Bracknell where the Met Office is based and who has broken down more
than once , it's the most valuable thing I've ever bought.
n THIS was a train ticket in Sri Lanka which turned out to be the nightmare
trip of my life. There were hundreds of people in the train, on top of the
train, and holding on to the train. It took two hours of standing in
temperatures of 110 degrees with no air-conditioning. I have never been so hot
in my life because with so many people the temperature seemed to soar even
higher. I've still got the ticket as a memento.

NEW Zealand have named a new-look team as they attempt to avoid a fourth
consecutive defeat against France in today's second Test at the Parc des
Princes.
France, who won a Test series 2-0 in New Zealand last year, retained the side
which won last Saturday's first Test 22-15 in Toulouse.
All Blacks coach Laurie Mains has made three changes and called up two uncapped
players, flanker Liam Barry and scrum half Justin Marshall, while Jeff Wilson,
who is suffering with a shoulder injury, gives up his full-back berth to Glen
Osborne.
French coach Jean-Claude Skrela is expecting a fierce battle from the All
Blacks. ``They'll want to prove that they are still a great side,'' he said.
All Blacks captain Sean Fitzpatrick admitted: ``That first Test was a real
disappointment. France played great rugby but we certainly didn't. We want to
prove that we can do much better. We want a win and we want it badly.''

I'M always put on my guard the moment the call comes through. They plough their
way through the phone book, these poor cold-callers, and our phone is listed
under my wife's name, not mine. So when they ask me, `is that Mr Ellis?', I
don't try and explain, I just put on my not-very-interested voice, let them
ramble on a bit (it's a miserable job, so I let them feel they've tried) and
then tell them no, I don't want their fitted bathroom, demonstration
kitchenware, or their chance-in-a-lifetime luxury patio extension.
Most are happy to take no for an answer, though you do get the odd plucky one
who, either in novice enthusiasm or old-hand desperation, tries to put up a bit
of a fight. But they know you can always slam down the receiver. Sometimes they
make a feeble attempt at conversation, hoping to lure you into their amazing
world of household improvements and easy-credit terms, such as the one who said
to me after I'd turned her down: ``So you've got all the windows and doors you
need, then?''
And I wished I could have thought of something witty to say. Because my flat
does indeed have just the right number of windows and doors. They fill the
holes in the walls. I'd be lost without them. But sarcasm failed me.
One of these days, I suppose, someone will phone up and offer me something I
actually want. Marketing research will eventually become so sophisticated that
at the very moment a hunger-pang strikes they'll call up and offer me a pizza
fungi. I'll only have to daydream about a new pair of shoes and immediately
that phone will ring. But until that time, the answer must always be no.
Except the other week I was intrigued. Some time previously I'd had someone
call up and ask me a load of questions about holidays. How often did I go, what
countries had I visited, did I go self-catering, was I between the ages of 28
and 45, did I earn more than #13,000, was I still listening?
I answered tersely and thought nothing more of it. But something I'd said in my
half-attentive way must have given them the profile they were looking for,
because 10 days later I got a call telling me I'd won a holiday for two - just
like that!
Now anyone who's grown up watching Esther Rantzen on That's Life! knows that
people don't just call up and give you a holiday for the hell of it. Like
sleight-of-hand magicians, they'll appear to give you a holiday while duping
you into doing something else. You know there'll be a catch. Such as the friend
of mine who was told he'd won a catamaran. Straight up. Strangely they forgot
to mention it was only an inflatable catamaran and he'd have to stump up a #75
postage fee to get it.
So to claim my free holiday all I had to do was turn up with my wife one
afternoon the following week at a rural leisure complex in the Borders and
listen to a two-hour talk.
``We do emphasise that in order to claim your free holiday there is no
obligation to buy any products you might be offered,'' rattled out the voice on
the phone, bringing me glad tidings from her prepared script. ``All we ask is
that you listen to the talk and, if you are impressed, that you tell your
family and friends about it, because we believe that personal recommendation is
the best form of advertising.''
Exactly what these products actually were remained a tad vague, though the
combination of holidays and leisure facilities seemed to suggest timeshares.But
we reckoned as long as we headed down with a steely resolve not to commit
ourselves to anything, we'd come away with our fabulous prize and might even
have a bit of a laugh in the process.
To tempt us further, they said they'd bought 100 lottery tickets and, if one of
them hit the jackpot, all that week's customers would get a share of the
winnings.
So off we went to a little corner of Northumberland called Akeld where there's
a complex of low-built farm cottages in the grounds of an old white manor house.
There was us and five other couples, ordinary-looking folk between those
statistically significant ages of 28 and 45, and each of us was assigned to a
sales rep. I'd rather hoped to get one of the identikit salesmen, all forced
sincerity, desperate jollity and cheap suits, but we were given a perfectly
pleasant, unpushy woman called Louise who had a German accent, a white
bouffant, and a bad back.
This was the deal. Imagine for the next 10 years that you and your family will
spend #400 once a year on a single week's holiday expenses (not including
flights). In a decade you'll have spent #4000. Now imagine instead of doing
that, you sink #4000 straight away into a week of - you guessed it - timeshare
in Akeld.
For the next 80 years you'd have no further holiday accommodation costs bar the
odd maintenance charge. Of course, you'd also be lumbered with having to take
February holidays in the Borders for the rest of your life, so the clever bit -
and here's the incentive - is that timeshare ownership would let you into an
international holiday exchange system, giving you the chance to stay in someone
else's timeshare property almost anywhere in the world for a dirt-cheap rate.
They're not stupid, these people. They know we've all grown wary of hard-sell
techniques. They know we've heard about disastrous deals struck between
unscrupulous operators and dreamy holidaymakers in Spanish beach resorts. They
know we're only here to claim the prize and won't stand for any heavy-handed,
arm-twisting stuff.
And they also know that the deal they're offering isn't all that bad. With a
nice human touch, Louise even revealed she had a timeshare option of her own,
and only this year had been living it up in some exclusive Swiss resort for
hardly more than #50. Their style is to be as reasonable as possible, offer you
an extra discount if you sign up straight away and - in as gentle a way as
possible - make you believe you'd be behaving irrationally (think of the #4000
just thrown away, never to be seen again!) if you didn't whip out your cheque
book immediately.
And the frightening thing about sitting through two hours of this reasonable,
logical, oh-so-sensible sales patter (plus slick video) is that you do find
yourself being persuaded.
Stuck in a room miles from home, surrounded by glossy brochures and people
being pleasant to you, it's easy to forget that when you woke up that morning
the idea of paying for a holiday, timeshare or otherwise, had not crossed your
mind. ``Doesn't it seem stupid to pay for your holiday every year when you
could be saving money with this method?'' asks Louise, and you can only agree
that, come to think of it, yes it does.
And the more you say ``yes'' to this kind of question, the closer you come to
being seduced by the whole package. As far as I can tell, there's nothing
implicitly wrong with the deal - I'm sure there are many who have signed up and
it suits them fine - but in what other circumstance would you commit #4000 on
the strength of a two-hour chat, without even checking out the competition?
What other product would you buy not because you ever thought you wanted it but
because someone phoned you up and all but bribed you to come and see it? Yet
it's dead easy to lose sight of what should be your natural scepticism. Even
the Geordie couple we spoke to on our way out, who quite plainly weren't into
the idea at all, even if they could have afforded the initial outlay, were
still giving the matter their serious attention.
And two things are really significant. The first is that the moment you make
your excuses and wriggle your way back to the outside world, all the smooth
arguments that seemed so persuasive five minutes earlier just vanish. It's
already hard to believe that you almost fell for it.
The second thing, as if to confirm this, is that even after you've promised to
go home and think about it, they give you no paperwork, no fancy brochures, not
even a copy of your original invitation to take away. I expected to be
inundated with pushy phone calls, pleading with me to see sense, but so far -
four months on - there's been nothing. It's as if they know that once you're
out of their clutches you're a lost cause. And you have to wonder why, if it's
such a good offer, you can't buy it without travelling 100 miles and listening
to two hours of guff.
And what of our fabulous free holiday? Well, it could work out, just as long as
we each pay #34 for the privilege of going to a destination of their choice
with as little as a fortnight's notice. Or else we can go for one of five
``exciting leisure options'' to suit our ``lifestyle and personal preference''.
Such excitement includes being given the air tickets but having to pay for the
accommodation, and getting the accommodation but having to pay for the food. I
can hardly contain myself.
And as a salutary note to all those weekly gamblers among us, out of the
#100-worth of Lottery tickets they bought on our behalf, only one produced as
much as a #10 prize.

BREAKFAST is unvarying and consists of grapefruit juice, eggs and bacon,
coffee, toast, butter and marmalade - with the occasional kipper.
I don't eat between then and lunch which will be something such as liver and
bacon, or rice, spaghetti, or macaroni - I like pasta - followed by biscuits
and French cheeses like Camembert or Bresse Bleu.
I never take tea in the afternoon and my lunch lasts me until dinner which is
at 8.15pm. I will have something like potted shrimp or pate, then grouse or
pheasant, either roast or casseroled, which I might have caught on the estate -
theoretically, I will have done, although not always practically.
Or I'll have fish, or a course with meat from the local butcher, MacDonald and
Campbell. I drink claret or white wine with dinner according to what I am
eating. I never have a pudding as I don't like sweet things, but will sometimes
have a savoury of Scotch Woodcock.
Salads and vegetables I don't much care for - except for parsnips. In London I
eat at White's Club, and in Scotland I eat in the dining room of the private
apartments.
I can't think what my favourite dish might be. That's difficult. I can't
actually do it, although food is a source of pleasure.

CRAIGENDARROCH, at the start of its second decade, remains a good reason for
visiting Ballater. Fine autumn weather, setting the Deeside scenery aglow, is
another. On such a day, amid the hills and forests, you could imagine yourself
in the remoter reaches of Alsace - not necessarily more beautiful, but with
food and wine of a consistent excellence difficult to find in Scotland.
It is a link that Craigendarroch's French chef, Eric Faussurier, seems
instinctively to have recognised, and to have underlined in cuisine which is
simultaneously rustic and sophisticated.
Faussurier in fact, hails from St Etienne, which lies south of Alsace, quite
close to Lyon, and his adept Scottish assistant, Paul Moran, is from East
Kilbride.
Between them they have transformed the Oaks Restaurant, as the gourmet portion
of the hotel's multi-sided operation is called, into a place with a resourceful
range of Franco-Scottish ideas.
Earlier this month, in the head chef's temporary absence, the kitchen turned
its hand to Jacobean banquetry, though anyone unexcited by the thought of
partan bree or oatmeal pudding had no need to despair. The absent Faussurier's
modern French menu was also on offer, and for a fixed price of #25 you could
opt for one or the other, or even switch dishes between them.
However, since the Jacobean banquet was conceived as an entity, switching would
have marred its effect. Moreover, since the French menu was riddled with
supplementary charges - #4.50 extra for game terrine, #6.50 extra for medalions
of beef - this was a minefield it seemed sensible to steer clear of. Even by
French standards, mark-ups on 10 dishes out of a total of 18 seemed a record,
and the restaurant has wisely decided to revamp this unendearing policy.
Aside from that, which menu was better? As an autumn offer, and as an
off-season promotion in which Ballater's other hotels and restaurants took
part, the Jacobean package was clearly good value, especially for anyone
addicted to oatmeal. On the other hand, the standard menu's starter portion of
warm avocado and artichoke with pine nuts and breadcrumbs possessed a very
French seductiveness, scoring in terms of colour, texture, and integration of
ingredients.
Not all the differences between the menus, however, were quite so marked. The
baked saddle of Deeside venison, with its parsnips, cherry brandy, cranberries,
and Poire William, was obviously French in its inspiration and elaboration, but
were the simpler collops of venison with their claret sauce recognisably
Jacobean? And in today's kindness-to-calves climate, who would expect the baked
veal and mushroom pie to count as Jacobean rather than French?
In fact, the Auld Alliance in one form or another characterises most of
Craigendarroch's cooking - game terrine appeared on both menus and only the
steamed marmalade pudding seemed indisputably Scottish.
Rejecting this, as I did, in favour of crepes Suzette proved a blunder. Cooked
at the table, these were piled in a chewy heap, reminiscent of pub-lunch
lasagne, with so much garnish (berries, ice-cream) that the dish lost focus.
Garnish, as in many another British restaurants, is a major industry at
Craigendarroch. The bowls of mixed vegetables likewise did little for the
dishes they accompanied.
Most of what the Oaks Restaurant does, however, it does very well, using good
ingredients and treating them with flair, even if some of the combinations
(roast duck, honey, and whisky consomme) look contrived, and some of the names
(``mirages'' of seasonal vegetables, ``sentries'' of scallops and sole)
pretentious. The high-powered, mostly French, wine list contains little of
interest below #20 but some really good things, including a first-class Rully
not much dearer than that.
A second restaurant, the simpler and cheaper Club Room forms one of the added
features - time-share chalets, two swimming-pools, fitness rooms, squash court,
dry-ski slope, children's creche - that have increasingly enveloped the red
stone Victorian mansion that was the hotel's starting point 10 years ago.
In comparison, Glasgow's Town House Hotel, a few steps from Queen Street
Station, seems quite austere, though in calling itself a ``quiet retreat'' it
shares the aims of most country-house hotels.
Lunch one recent Monday was certainly quiet. The building, another redstone
edifice, once housed the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, but no
longer rings with music and bustle. Now Beethoven's bust at the top of the
stairs frowns into space. The ornate old recital hall, transformed into a
functions area, looks like a haunted ballroom. The so-called Symphonies
Restaurant plays subliminal baroque music from hidden speakers. A soft-footed
waiter discloses a pair of set menus, ranging from #16 to #24 depending on
what, and on how many courses, you order.
The food, cooked by John Shields, is of the same Franco-Scottish sort as
Craigendarroch's. Collops of venison, paupiettes of chicken, parcels of trout
loom large. My stir-fried wood pigeon in its pool of soya sauce, had flavour.
My salmon escalope, reposing on top of three scallops, had not. A small
side-dish held seven different vegetables. The wine list, all this and that,
stays mostly on the right side of #20. The house wine, from Carcassonne,
suffices, the red rather more so than the white.

n.THE next best thing to being in a garden at the height of its spring or
summer perfection may be to see it on screen. A series of videos offers this
possibility.
The list includes Brilliant Gardens (showing eight of Britain's botanic
gardens, Glasgow's and Edinburgh's among them) and Treasure Gardens (eight
great English gardens, ranging from Chatsworth's to Woburn Abbey's). Peeps into
Secret Gardens and More Secret Gardens are also offered, as is the official
souvenir video of the 1995 Chelsea Flower Show. The videos can be acquired at
branches of W.H Smith or via mail order at #12.99 each from Tadpole Lane
Productions, 13 Winnall Valley Road, Winchester, Hampshire, SO23 8LU; tel 01962
841 100.
n.City parks and suburban gardens alike are knee-deep in leaves just now. The
business of brushing them up is a Sisyphean labour, for no sooner are paths
cleared and the detritus bagged, than another lot of leaves fall.
Now this seasonal labour can be made simpler by the use of a self-powered leaf
blower with an optional vacuum collection attachment. As a blower the gadget is
designed to clear out leaves and debris from under bushes and shrubs, street
furniture, and stadium seating as well as clearing grassed and paved areas of
fallen leaves (and litter).
An optional vacuum attachment transforms the blower into a suction unit feeding
a vertically mounted collection bag.
The Allman M88BL leaf blower is priced at #350 plus vat. Local Strathclyde
suppliers are Hamilton Brothers of Bishopton, Renfewshire.
n.Leaves disposed of, it's time to prepare your garden for the winter and to
finish planting the bulbs whose spring flourish will cheer you in a few months.
This year, because of the prolonged hot summer, it's more important than ever
to repair damage to the soil structure, while winter rains bring their own
hazards of ``packing'' soil or washing it away. By adding lots of organic
matter, along with nutrients, you will help to open up the soil structure once
again and boost its fertility.
There is virtually no limit to the amount of humus a soil can take. Steaming
heaps of ordinary manure have their virtues but pleasant handling is not one of
them. An alternative is a 100% natural fertiliser such as Organic Concentrates'
6X. This, claim the manufacturers, is six to eight times richer than ordinary
manure and therefore can be applied in handfuls, rather than barrowloads. The
product has also been heat sterilised, so contains none of the weed seeds that
can cause problems with manure. For details of your nearest stockist or free

n.Once the soil is in tip-top shape what to put in it? Johnsons of Boston (the
Lincolnshire one) are marking their 175th anniversary with their biggest-ever
mail order catalogue. It is packed with more than 900 varieties of flowers and
vegetables, many of which are exclusive or new to Johnsons. The new catalogue
is backed by a daily freephone order line (0800 614323) and a free packaging
and delivery service.
n.Geranium specialists Vernon's have more than 50,000 sq.ft of greenhouse in
which they grow more than 1000 varieties of geranium and almost 200 species of
fuchsia. Among the delectable collection of geraniums, the new PAC Harmony will
bloom almost through the four seasons. Free catalogue from The Vernon Geranium

Ruling Britannia: The Failure and Future of British Democracy
Andrew Marr
Michael Joseph, #16.99
ANDREW Marr is a native of Dundee, and yet another in the long line of Scots
who have found fame and fortune as a political correspondent in London. And
he's still only 36.
His last book, The Battle for Scotland, was one of many projects born on the
tide of home-rule certainty that preceded the 1992 General Election. This is a
much more substantial work, taking a cool look at our institutions of power and
the nature of British governance.
A sustained note of warning runs through the text. Marr is troubled by the
continuing evisceration of local government. He attributes this partly to the
mass-media - whose obsession with Westminster encourages voters to treat every
local poll as a referendum on the Government, thus inciting our statesmen to
excessive meddling in the town hall - and, too, to a decline of British power
abroad. As Whitehall has lost an empire, so it justifies its existence by
scooping up responsibility from below.
Marr is also troubled by Europe. He sensibly defines ``sovereignty'' as nothing
more than the power of veto, or secession, invested in a member-state's
electorate. However, he thinks this power should be acknowledged by European
institutions.
He wants greater internal democracy in the European Union, and warns of the
dangers of ``mystification'', citing the Maastricht Treaty.
Marr's solution for Europe is what he calls ``minimalist federalism'', with
balance of powers and a two-tier centre - the Council of Ministers, as an open
senate rather than a cosy cuddle between statesmen, and the Strasbourg
Parliament. The right of a member state to leave the Union should be clearly
declared.
He resents quangoes, and certain privatised utilities, and is concerned by the
amount of power now slipping from public scrutiny and elected control. He
dislikes the rising influence of lobbyists in Britain. He says the job of the
Prime Minister, in this day and age, is frankly impossible; and by the time he
has outlined the impossible physical and mental burdens laid upon the Chief
Secretary, and the paucity of the direct staffing and resources at No 10, you
feel new admiration for John Major.
It's a big book, a stimulating book, but not the easiest of reading, despite
Marr's irritating penchant for moments of levity. It is short on colour and big
on involved descriptions of agencies and institutions.
The book is informative in its detail, keen in its analyses, and good reading
for those with an intense interest in constitutional politics. However, Marr
failed to persuade me that structural reform could, at the end of the day, make
any real difference to ordinary lives.

SAMANTHA Smith's impressive run in the Texaco Challenger event in Edinburgh
ended yesterday, when she lost in straight sets to Seda Noorlander in the last
four, writes Judy Murray.
Smith broke serve in the second game, but after failing to convert three break
points in the fourth, she won just seven more points as the sixth seed pocketed
the first set 6-2.
In the second set, Smith could not disrupt her opponent's relentless baseline
driving and was frequently caught out by some spectacular angles as the Dutch
player went on to take the set 6-4.
In today's final, Noorlander's opponent will be Russian teenager Julia Lutrova,
who outlasted Marion Maruska, of Austria, 7-6, 3-6, 6-2.
q.BORIS Becker needed the benefit of some complex mathematics to secure his
passage to the semi-finals of the ATP Tour World championship in Frankfurt.
Becker, who beat Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-4, 7-5 yesterday, finished with
the same record of two matches won and one lost in his section as American Pete
Sampras and South African Wayne Ferreira. But Ferreira was edged out because he
had the marginally weakest record of sets won and lost.
Sampras now meets Michael Chang while Becker takes on Sweden's Thomas Enqvist.

7-3, 7-5 against Rita Jones from Wales. However, last night she surrendered a
2-1 lead against Jersey's Val Stead, losing in five sets.
The other Scottish win came in the men's singles, where Graham Robertson edged
Jersey's David Le Marquand in a five-setter that ended on the
three-and-three-quarter-hour time rule, with the Scot 3-2 up in the decider.
Scotland lost all three fours matches played yesterday. Results:
Women. Singles - J Lindores (Scotland) beat R Jones (Wales) 7-2, 7-3, 7-5; A

STEPHEN Hendry and John Higgins, who contested the final of the last ranking
event in Sunderland, produced explosive starts to the 1995 Royal Liver
Assurance UK championship at Preston yesterday.
Both Scots potted their way into 6-2 first-session leads, with title-holder
Hendry going on to complete a 9-3 victory last night over young fellow Scot
Jamie Burnett, whereas Higgins resumes this after-noon.
Hendry compiled a magnificent 133 break in the second frame. He went on to
compile further efforts of 60, 53, 61, 55, 54, 60, 52, 64, and 92.
Provisional world No.2 Higgins, defeated by Peter Ebdon in a final in Malta
since his loss to Hendry, produced back-to-back breaks of 123 and 101 against
King.
Another Scot, Chris Small, caused the first upset. The Edinburgh professional
won 9-7 against world No.16 David Roe from Derby. All the first-round results
and positions:
D Taylor (N Ire) beat J Michie (Eng) 9-2; S Hendry (Sco) beat J Burnett (Scot)
9-3; A Hamilton (Eng) beat S Pettman (Eng) 9-3; C Small (Sco) beat D Roe (Eng)
9-7.
To finish this afternoon: B Morgan (Eng) leads S Reardon (Eng) 5-3; J Higgins
(Sco) leads M King (Eng) 6-2; G Wilkinson (Eng) leads J Prince (N Ire) 7-1; T
Griffiths (Wal) leads D Leary (N Ire) 5-3.
To finish tonight: K Broughton (Eng) and J Ferguson (Eng) level 4-4; D Henry
(Sco) leads K Doherty (Rep of Ire) 5-3; A Robidoux (Can) leads K Payne (Eng)
7-1; J White (Eng) leads M Wilson (Eng) 5-3.

I HEAR from a spy in the camp that the Western Samoans have hardly practised
scrums or lineouts during their stay in Scotland. Maybe it's just been too damn
wet and cold, but more probably they see themselves as acceptable scrummagers
and lineout workers already. Which is true.
Whatever, it gives a flash of insight into the mentality of one of the world's
most under-rated teams in that they see continuity as the cornerstone of their
game. Western Samoans view glorious passing movements as beautiful in
themselves, but pretty handy, too, when it comes to putting points up on the
board.
So how to go about beating them? What needs to be done? Well, the starting
point for Telfer, Dixon, and Johnston will have been in trying to figure out
what the Samoans do. All this talk about only thinking about our own game is
baloney. You can't design your own style until you know how the opposition is
to play.
And I mean exactly what they do. I phoned Roy Laidlaw up the other day and when
the call was put through to him, he was busy editing bits of video for
examination, and there will have been some in-depth analysis of video-tape to
see just what the Samoans are up to in every different department of play.
For instance, when they arrive at rucks does the first man drive over, or does
he get his hands on the ball and pass it back? How do their mauls work? How far
away are they when they launch their tackles? And how high? What's their
defensive line-up at each phase of play, and what are their attacking ones?
What have they done each time they have received the ball? Honest to goodness,
you'd want to be a chess master nowadays before the SRU gave you a job.
I figure the game will rest on a couple of things today. The first is that, for
one of the few occasions in Scottish rugby history, we will be more at ease
about kicking the ball out of play than they will. There are going to be
occasions when the Scots find themselves under so much pressure that they have
to play for the refuge of the touchlines, and they can probably do so in
relative comfort, but I wonder if Craig Chalmers will be told that gaining
ground with a touch-find is on if he wants to.
So getting the ball in the first place, and stopping theirs at source, is today
- as always, frankly - the main name of the game.
The second is the use the Scots can make of the possession they receive, and
their ability to stop the Samoans in their tracks when the Scots don't have the
ball.
You see, what the Samoans do with the ball in hand that is different, and they
showed it against Scotland A last weekend, is that the man on the ball tries to
beat a man to get over the imaginary gain-line, and then supporting runners
take the ball on, now behind the defenders. It's very rugby league, nosing
through gaps and giving quick passes. It's not so much a test of defensive
alignment, more a question of defensive awareness and tackling ability.
They don't do that much in front of the defence, unlike Five Nations' teams,
and they leave their actions very late. Stopping the Samoans this afternoon
will be fun and games, and I fancy that there is a great, big game of bluff and
double bluff about to be enacted when the Samoans have the ball, because so far
they have run most of the possession that has come their way. Therefore the
Scots will feel entitled to go up flat, and quickly, to stop them making
ground. If you were a Samoan, you would want to question that Scottish
assumption straight away by getting some of your hard-won ball as high over
Rowen Shepherd as possible.
It would certainly make Chalmers and company think twice the next time about
rushing up in defence. Makes you think, doesn't it? And what was that about
Townsend and Shiel having shoulder injuries?
A harem-scarem game later today doesn't do Scotland any good, and they will
need control. A kicking game would, as Jim Aitken used to say, ``bore them to
death.''
The Samoans have won a PR battle so far. The big hits of the Edinburgh game
have been absent ever since. If I were a Samoan, I'd bring the flaming things
right back today to give those little Scots boys a darned good fright.
Which leaves the Scots with the question of what to do when they go into
contact. Run at the individual tacklers - like Big Gav did in 1991? Run away
from the tackle? Run to the shoulder? Run at those rather nice, swinging arms
of the Samoans as they tackle and change direction sharply just before the hit?
Again, bluff and double bluff.
The Samoans expect the Scots to run at them, just like 1991, and like the North
and Midlands on Tuesday. Which affords Chalmers and his merry band the
opportunity of swerving, side-stepping, and chip-kicking to take them by
surprise. Ah, the joys of inventing a game plan.
The easy way to win, of course, is just to score more points. I'm a confused
man.
Good luck to the new caps - it'll be the shortest 80 minutes of your lives,
boys.

T  CORAGHESSAN BOYLE is perhaps best known as author of The Road to Wellville,
a desperate satire on the American obsession with self awareness and
immortality, personified by the inventor of the cornflake.
Here he turns to another America, a society which developed alongside the
cornflake, a community too tragic for satire, whose condition is partly
explained in the epigraph from The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck: ``They
ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't
stand it to be so dirty and miserable.''
In contemporary California, Boyle finds a society at variance with the state's
popular image of conspicuous wealth. The Great Depression has sunk into a
collective American dreamstate where the misery has been emulsified and
revisionist historians say it wasn't all bad. A generation ago, migrant workers
were championed by writers as diverse as Steinbeck and Woody Guthrie.
Now Boyle shows that the system is intact; migrant workers are still exploited.
His obvious intentions are saved by the fact that he is a great stylist,
capable of wild and imaginative feats of language and diversion, using irony
and humour in a way that suggests nothing is capable of surviving his
coruscating wit.
He implies that California's wealth and collective liberal conscience is
supported by illegal immigration. He underlines this with a more obvious aspect
of Californian life, and even though the symbolism is heavily signalled, it
still manages to convey the friability of West Coast existence. Nothing is
fixed, and for all that one side of Californian life continually sanitises
itself from the other, their common denominator is the fact that the ground can
literally shift beneath them at any minute.
Delaney Mossbacher, a liberal humanist with an unblemished driving record, a
freshly waxed Japanese car and personalised plates, is driving up the canyon
from his home in Arroyo Blanco Estates when he hits an illegal immigrant.
His first thought is for the car, but rather than take Candido Rincon to
hospital, or even report the accident, he responds to the man's request, gives
$20 and leaves him to limp back to his 17-year-old pregnant wife, whose name is
America.
While Mossbacher writes a weekly newspaper column, Wide Open Spaces, on the
joys of rural California from behind the seven foot fence he has built to keep
wildlife and immigrants off his land, Candido and America make do in Topanga
Canyon, struggling each day for casual labour, dreaming of a house in a
friendly neighbourhood and trying to avoid the immigration authorities. Boyle
moves between Mossbacher's antiseptic world, where he buys and sells real
estate and his son fights Space Invaders, and existence on the canyon, where
cheap booze makes Candido's life bearable and his wife comes to detest him for
removing her from her family and friends in pursuit of a dream.
For most of the novel, America's pregnant. Her daughter is born on the earth to
the sound of bombers spilling water over a forest fire and though life is short
the birth is a catalyst, bringing a conclusion that is both natural and
relentless. The land destroys them, leaving Candido with his pride and broken
wife, almost sobbing.
``But men didn't sob, men endured; they worked for three dollars a day.  they
worked till there was no more work left in them.''

SCOTTISH Schools, who face French School in five weeks' time, were given a hard
work-out last night at Meggetland, where the youth side's forward strength told.
The Under-18s' three first-half tries came from left wing Steve McKerrow, prop
Alistair Milne, and right wing Ross Lothian for a 15-9 half-time lead, while
Gordon Ross kicked a drop goal and two penalties to keep the Schools in the
game.
In the second half Graeme Kiddie's drop goal was scant reward for almost total
domination of possession by the Under-18s.

ROWEN Shepherd fulfils a life-time ambition when he pulls on the Scotland No.15
shirt for the first time against the Western Samoans at Murrayfield this
afternoon.
Shepherd, 24, a rugby development officer with Dunfermline District Council,
who has enlisted with Melrose after a spell with Edinburgh Academicals at
Raeburn Place, faces the most daunting mission possible as he steps into Gavin
Hastings' still-warm boots, but it does not end there. At full back this
afternoon, Shepherd joins an elite group whose exploits are now part of the
folklore of the Scottish game.
It is an astonishing fact that since Andy Irvine made his debut against New
Zealand in December, 1972, with a performance that had the late, great Lions'
coach Carwyn James purring with pleasure, Scotland have had just three
first-choice full backs.
Irvine (1972-1982), Peter Dods (1983-1991), and Hastings (1986-1995) - with
cameo appearances from Bruce Hay, Kenny Logan, and Michael Dods - are the great
triumvirate whose reign spanned more than 20 years and who appeared,
collectively, at full back on no fewer than 129 occasions.
The bare statistics tell their own tale of magnificent achievement, and during
this period nearly half of Scotland's points came from those three individuals.
Their points tally includes 29 tries, which, compared to their predecessors -
two tries in 304 internationals over 101 years - is truly remarkable.
The game and the laws have changed, and more tries are being scored - often
against weaker opposition than in days of yore - but a strike-rate of one try
in every five internationals, against one try in every 152, is a statistic
which speaks for itself.
Irvine and Hastings, in particular, brought an attacking menace, infectious
enthusiasm, leadership, and sheer presence on to the international pitch which
opponents found difficult to counter.
But we should not belittle the contribution of Peter Dods. The Gala man
averaged more than 10 points a game for Scotland and, undoubtedly, he was
supremely unlucky to arrive on the scene between Irvine and Hastings, who, in
addition to setting points-scoring records galore, went on five of the six
Lions tours between 1974-1993, appearing in 15 of a possible 17 Tests.
In almost every other Test-playing nation in the world Dods would have been the
No.1 choice and his misfortune was never better illustrated than when he was
selected for the 1989 Lions tour to Australia. After an impressive Five
Nations' campaign, he made it ``Down Under'' only to be relegated to the
back-up slot, once again, by Gavin Hastings.
Scotland have, indeed, been fortunate to have unearthed these three world-class
performers since 1972 and today Shepherd has much to live up to. It would be
folly to expect too much, too soon, but Shepherd has been on the national scene
for a few seasons, winning five A caps in the process.
Today, he has the opportunity to join Scotland's elite corps of full backs.
Success would mean that he could continue Scottish rugby's remarkable full back
story well into the next century. Only time will tell.

Frank Sinatra:
An American Legend
Nancy Sinatra
Virgin Books, #25
MILESTONES gain in significance the longer the journey lasts: more experience
gained, less time to go. So it is with Frank Sinatra, surely the greatest
entertainer the world has ever known, who will complete his 80 years on
December 12.
Daughter Nancy, herself no mean singer, wrote a loving book for his 70th
birthday and has now updated the story, this time in the rather different form
of a month-by-month diary, with a patchwork splattering of pictures and quotes
which makes it look a bit like a family album.
It is, of course, the very subjective view of Sinatra's adoring daughter but,
considering the singer's longstanding conviction that he would never write his
own story, this is the closest we are likely to come to an autobiography.
To her credit, Nancy does not gloss over the allegations that Sinatra had Mafia
connections, albeit if only to mount a defence against the rumour-mongering for
which she blames a succession of journalists.
There was at least one occasion, however, where her father could have shown
more sense. She tells the story of how Frank Sinatra played a vital role in
putting John F Kennedy in the White House.
Needless to say, it began with the future President's father, the ruthless and
despicable Joseph Kennedy, who would stop at nothing. If he were to gain the
Democratic nomination, John F Kennedy simply had to win the primary election in
West Virginia. So crooked old Joe approached Sinatra and suggested he should
seek the co-operation of notorious mobster Sam Giancana. And that's what
Sinatra did. Sam sent one of his henchmen to ensure that local sheriffs and
powerful coal-mining unions would deliver the necessary 120,000 votes for
Kennedy. However, deeds come back to haunt you. Kennedy eventually shunned
Sinatra. And if the great singer was having his own private thoughts at the
time of the 1963 assasination, he didn't have long to dwell on them.
Two weeks later, he was caught up in the personal crisis of his own son, Frank
jr, being kidnapped. After the ransom was paid, young Sinatra was released and
two men given life sentences.
Darker incidents should not, however, detract from the warmth and compassion
which are so much at the heart of Sinatra's character. And he does, after all,
remain the most popular single artiste the world of entertainment has ever
known.
It has been a remarkable career, all the way from Hoboken to Hollywood - the
working-class home in Hoboken, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan,
where his Italian father Marty was a prize-fighter and dock labourer before
working for the local fire department.
Sinatra himself worked in the shipyard but sang at school and liked the
applause. His early heroes were Russ Columbo (killed in a 1934 shooting
accident) and Bing Crosby. It was when he took his girlfriend Nancy to hear
Bing in downtown Jersey City that he decided, there and then, he was going to
be a singer.
He formed the Hoboken Four, later gained a radio spot with another promising
youngster, Dinah Shore, and finally got the break of an engagement with that
great band-leading trumpeter, Harry James. In 1939, the year he married Nancy,
he cut his first record, From the Bottom of My Heart. The career, now well
documented, took him on to the orchestra of Tommy Dorsey, with whom he
eventually fell out, and thereafter towards the heights of show business.
Here was The Voice, the man with expressive hands, soft speaking tones and that
hungry and vulnerable look which stirred the girls, by now bereft of their boys
at war, to swoon over him, to want to take care of him, make love to him.
Ironically, that wonderfully musical ear was a perforated one, damaged at a
forceps birth, which was to keep him out of the forces.
It didn't stop him becoming a film star with MGM, appearing in Anchors Aweigh
with Gene Kelly, who taught him how to move. He would win an Oscar for his part
in From Here to Eternity but felt he had given his best performance in The Man
With the Golden Arm.
Meanwhile, he and Nancy were divorced and his magnificent obsession with Ava
Gardner led to marriage in 1951, Ava having already been married to Mickey
Rooney and bandleader Artie Shaw. In that immediate post-war period, the
unknown name of Las Vegas burst upon public consciousness as the dream of
mobster Bugsy Siegel to make it the mecca of the gamblers' world. In helping to
shape its reputation, Sinatra became King of The Strip and has never lost that
sense of belonging there.
Daughter Nancy traces her father's ups and downs from the wild days of the Rat
Pack, through his marriages to Mia Farrow and Barbara Marx (Zeppo's widow) to
those sadder moments when his contemporaries began to melt away.
The name of Nelson Riddle will forever represent the greatest orchestra to
bring out the best in Sinatra. Yet, on the day of Riddle's funeral in 1985,
Frank was attending the New York funeral of that other friend, Yul Brynner.
Frank junior did the honours in California.
And on that very same day, the death was also announced of one of the singer's
closest buddies, the great Orson Welles.
Nancy's book, incidentally, includes a compact disc covering some rare moments
in her father's life.
Inevitably, there would be other books to mark Sinatra's 80th birthday. Ray
Coleman, who specialises in showbiz biographies, has come up with Sinatra:
Portrait of The Artist (Pavilion Books, #19.99).
This is a more coherent narrative from a professional writer, again lavishly
illustrated and doing full justice to the man who has won his way to so many
hearts - the legend we know as Ol' Blue Eyes.

ENGLAND could today discover the full cost of Mike Catt's unfortunate comments
regarding World Cup-winning captain Francois Pienaar.
When fly-half Catt described Pienaar as an average player, he handed South
Africa all the ammunition needed to ensure a thunderous occasion at #60m
new-look Twickenham.
Referring to potential problem areas, coach Kitch Christie commented: ``We have
a new front row which is a slight problem - and in another area we have a very
average player. We are working on him, but we haven't got that right yet!''
Looking at Pienaar, who was sitting beside him, Christie added: ``He's got a
nickname now. They call him `average'!''
South Africa arrive having won 13 games on the spin, although last weekend's
40-21 victory over Italy in Rome was clearly not one of their best.
Regarding today's opposition, Christie said: ``They have strengths and
weaknesses like all sides, but if you asked me to pinpoint one thing that
worries me I'd say the lineouts - they must have the best lineout barricade in
the world. One guy is a skyscraper and we'll need to take out some step-ladders!
``I think they are a good side. They've got rid of their two pit-bulls in Moore
and Richards, so we'll see if the new guys can take their place.''
Andy Robinson has broken the recent pattern of England selection by winning a
recall from a previous rugby age to face South Africa.The Bath flanker wears
the white shirt well over six years after his last appearance.
As important as any of the six Bath players in the line-up is Ben Clarke, who
has been shifted back to his position at No.8 and has won the race to be pack
leader. ``My job is to get the pack in the right frame of mind and then take
the right decisions on the field,'' said Clarke.
q.SALE scrum-half Chris Saverimutto has been handed a key role on his
international debut for Ireland against Fiji at Lansdowne Road today.
The swift-passing, sturdy 24-year-old from Manchester has impressed in training
and his selection suggests Ireland will opt for an expansive game, aiming to
bring in attacking backs like Jonathan Bell, Simon Geoghegan, and Jim Staples.

WAINWRIGHT: the biography
Hunter Davies
Michael Joseph, #16.99
In common with so many others, I have spent days walking the Lakeland Fells
with one of Wainwright's guides in my backpack, stopping to consult his
hand-drawn maps and reading his directions on vantage points and footpaths.
No one is better equipped than Hunter Davies to write Wainwright's biography.
He lives half the year in the Lake District, and has written several books
about the area and its literary associations, and his narrative style is as
down-to-earth as Wainwright appeared to be, despite having spent so much time
among the clouds.
Born in Blackburn in 1907, Alfred Wainwright joined the borough council at the
age of 13, and by dint of assiduous study in accountancy became borough
treasurer of Kendal. Living there gave him easy access to the Lake District,
and most weekends he set off by bus to walk the fells. The big man only had to
appear in the doorway of the cafe in Keswick for the waitress to shout: ``one
plaice and chips!'' It sounds like a bachelor existence, but Wainwright had
married Ruth Holden, a cotton weaver, in 1931. She had to have his lunch on the
table when he came home from the burgh office at 1pm, and instead of keeping
her company in the winter evenings, he re-created the Lakeland of his summer
walks with bottles of ink, a clutch of pencils and infinite patience.
It is claimed that Wainwright's constant absences on the fells caused the
breakdown of his marriage, but Davies shows that the opposite is true: it was
the failure of Wainwright's marriage in the first place that sent him out on to
the fells. His son Peter, born in 1931, accompanied his father in his young
years, but later would experience the neglect and indifference that his mother
had had to endure.
In 1942 the man who disappeared whenever relatives came to call predicted that
``my life's blood will be Wainwright's Guide to the Fells, and will be my
memorial.'' In 1955 he brought out his first book, The Eastern Fells, on a
self-publishing basis, but the first 2000 copies were soon sold.
His seven pictorial guides to the Lakes were really his illuminated books,
though he liked to work in black and white. Pounding off the presses, the
guides kept the Westmorland Gazette in business. Davies estimates that by 1985
the total revenue was more than #2 million, and that did not include the 40
other books he had written by then.
It was only in guide number seven that Wainwright revealed he was married and
thanked ``All Who Have Helped Me'', including ``my wife, for not standing in my
way.'' They separated in 1966, and there were disputes over money. He gave away
most of his earnings to animal causes, principally Animal Rescue in Cumbria.
In 1957 the borough treasurer of Kendal had written a letter to Betty McNally,
demanding 10 shillings for an extended booking of a hall. After his divorce
from Ruth he married Betty and found the happiness that had been denied him for
so many years.
Wainwright was a unique author and illustrator, his work as much a part of
Lakeland as Wordsworth's. He could be rude, withdrawn, intolerant, condemning
the walkers that his books had brought to the fells and hiding from them behind
cairns. His feast was a pancake in a Little Chef, preferably after coming down
from a day on the fells, but he loved Scotland also, and made television
programmes about it as well as the Lakes. Like his guides, you cannot put down
this biography.

Mikhail Pietranek has succeeded in giving the world's most memorable cloth a
contemporary look with his palette of subtle colours. Clare Henry profiles a
businessman who is taking his unique style of textiles around the world
WITH a name like Mikhail Pietranek, why would you be promoting tartan around
the world? Pietranek is quick to explain. ``My father was a Polish Russian
tailor who made kilts in Aberdeen. He married a girl called Jean Macdonald
Munro McLean.''
Now 34 and on his fifth job, Pietranek's tartan textiles are taking the United
States by storm.
``Most of my fabric is exported. Films like Braveheart and Highlander have
sparked off a lot of interest. It's the right place at the right time. The
Americans are going wild for my tartan.''
In fact, he only started in interior design by chance, opening his Aberdeen
shop, Ambiance, in 1991. He started his tartan wool fabric business a mere
three years ago when he found it difficult to get the right weight of tartan he
wanted for upholstering purposes.
Since then, he's moved to designing tartans, subtly altering the colourways,
some paler in hue; others richer in tone and changing the scale of the set to
make it more suitable for chairs, sofas or jackets.
At the beginning of October his fabrics appeared at London's prestigious
Decorex trade Fair at Syon Park on classic Whytock &amp; Reid furniture. Whytock &amp;
Reid were established in 1807 and are Scotland's most distinguished interior
designers, and are decorators and furnishers by appointment to the Queen. They
have almost 200 years history.
It's very early days for Pietranek, but already he has given the world's most
memorable fabric a contemporary look with his subtle colour palette and his
fabrics already adorn one Lear Jet and several notable homes, including the
refurbished Haddo House, opened by the Queen and Prince Edward. Who knows what
will be next?
Pietranek admits to being ambitious. ``I always throw myself into my work. I
began as a draughtsman, then worked at Aberdeen airport. I ended up in a
transport firm, importing bits of Piper Alpha. Then I was promoted and moved to
Birmingham. The firm amalgamated, my wife was unhappy down south and we wanted
to move back to Scotland for the sake of the three kids.
``When we got back I did up the interior our new house myself. It was easy. I
had the right skills and background.
``As a child, because of my father's job, our house was always draped in
tartan. As an engineering draughtsman I knew how to construct things. Friends
liked my work. Gradually, I was asked to do more.
``My new job didn't work out, so I considered setting up professionally as an
interior designer. Friends said to go for it! So I did. But the shop I leased
had dry rot. The day I got the keys I thought, My God! What have I done?''
In fact, he'd found a gap in the market. Four years later Pietranek's fabric
range is being handled worldwide by a leader of the fabric trade: Colefax and
Fowler. Selling Scotland is big business and Pietranek does it well.
Pietranek began with just four fabrics. With Maclean of Duart, (named after his
mother's family), he merely played around with the colours, to soften them.
That was followed by two based on the ancient Macmillan and Macpherson tartans
which he mixed with Colefax and Fowler flowery chintz in pinks and blues -
which works surprisingly well.
From that it was but a short step to Clan Rotal, Royal Lomond (``Our best
seller''), Highlander and Wallace Rose (``God bless the film industry!'') and a
dark blue/red Drummond of Perth (``I always liked rich colours'') plus a
classic Black Watch enlarged to a scale suitable for jackets, which Pietranek,
six foot four in his socks, wears with style.
``I was determined to bring the furnishing side of tartan into the 21st
century.''
To do this he used a computer, so that via computer aided design (or CAD), he
can fine-tune his palette electronically. Traditionalists will, no doubt, be
horrified at his ``messing about'' with ancient plaids and names, but this
entrepreneur is unperturbed.
``It's a totally Scottish company. All the fabrics are 100% wool, and woven in
the Borders. I can now create my own look. After all, I give them all totally
fictitious titles. Glen Louis is named after my eight-year-old son.''
Originally, Pietranek adapted his tartans to pick up the colours in Colefax and
Fowler's fabrics. Now he draws up his own floral, rather William Morris
designs. However, lengths of 120 metres, be it tartan or patterned, made
supplies difficult.
``In 1994 I took the bull by the horns, made appointments and went to London. I
started at the top with Colefax and Fowler and two well-known interior
designers who often work in New York.
``They loved my tartans and now sell my Baronial Home Collection of fabric,
cushions, throws and bedspreads for me in New York, Chicago, and 11 other
outlets across the States. Prices are around #30 to #45 a metre.''
Last year, with rapid expansion, there came the usual problem of finance. ``I
knew I was onto something big, so I approached all the Grampian and Aberdeen
Enterprise people. No luck. In the end, I just got a small bank loan.'' This
enabled him to diversify into Glen Checks, cotton checks, (woven in Dundee),
then Glen Lomond Rose, a lovely heavy jacquard tapestry weave with an almost
imperceptible rose woven into the check, rather like a shadow. This is his most
expensive cloth and retails at #54 a metre.
Trefoils came next which sell well in France and tartan wallpaper follows on
his list.
``It will be available by the middle of next year,'' he says. ``I'm responding
to the market. Already the demands abroad are extensive.'' And will doubtless
increase after London's Decorex trade fair.
Here the combination of his new Glen Lomond tartans with the age-old elegance
of Whytock &amp; Reid's hand made Dalmeny Lug Chair and their Forsyth sofa covered
in the dramatic, predominantly red and blue Wallace Rose tartan will certainly
wow the clients.
I left Pietranek waiting for Red Star to deliver his lastest tartan so that
Alistair Milne, one of Whytock &amp; Reid's upholsterers, could finish his task.
``It's always last minute if you want to move fast with brand new items,'' said
Pietranek cheerfully. ``I guess I'll be making up the pattern books the night
before!''

ARGENTINA and Germany go into their weekend games in the Olympic qualifying
tournament in Cape Town as the only sides with maximum points, and they will
start favourites to be in a similar position come tomorrow night.
Meanwhile, Holland, the European champions, yesterday picked up their first
points. They beat their hosts South Africa 3-2, with their goals coming from
their captain Wietske De Ruiter, Marlies Vossen, and Ellen Kuipers.
China, too, scored their first success, overcoming Canada 1-0, with Ying Lin
scoring their first goal of the tournament in the thirty-sixth minute.
Great Britain had a rest day following their 1-1 draw with Canada on Thursday
but they have two games in the course of the weekend, against Germany and
China, which could give an insight as to their prospects.
They will be looking to take at least two points from these games in order to
give their challenge momentum. Results:
South Africa 2, Holland 3; China 1, Canada 0.
Today's games: Argentina v South Africa; Great Britain v Germany; Korea v
Holland. Tomorrow: China v Great Britain; Canada v Germany.

COLIN McRae and team-mate Carlos Sainz set out from Chester tomorrow morning in
the Network Q RAC Rally and the major prize that victory will bring, the World
Rally Championship title.
The Scot and the Spaniard, driving identical Subaru Imprezas, start the
four-day, 1445-mile rally equal on points and unimpeded by the team orders in
the previous round in Spain, which saw McRae win on stage times but pressured
into incurring a time penalty to allow local hero Sainz to take victory.
``Carlos may be my team-mate, but it's a straight head-to-head fight for the
title,'' said McRae. ``He will be as determined as I am to win, but that
doesn't worry me. This is my event, on home soil, in front of a home crowd. I
won it last year and can do so again.''
On recent form, Andrew Cowan's Mitsubishi Lancer team could well win the RAC
Rally and the manufacturers' world championship.
The rally, which tackles Northumberland's Kielder Forest on Monday, finishes
back in Chester on Wednesday afternoon.

THE sign outside the disused church in Glasgow's Church Street is intriguing:
``World's End,'' it announces in letters around the top of a globe. ``One day
all antique stores will be like this . . .'' Underneath it adds: ``TV and film
props for sale and hire''.
I'm drawn inside the portals, up a carved staircase and through a narrow door
that looks down on a U-shaped balcony.
There's something about a balcony - perhaps it's our descent from tree-dwellers
that gives such a thrill at rediscovering the height and perspective.
This balcony is furnished like no other: 1950s lamps and tables line the
seating tiers, a 10ft papier-mache cactus sprouts from the floor, and a giant
CD-playing Cola can sends music round the vaulted ceiling. Rony Bridges, who
runs World's End, certainly knows how to achieve a theatrical effect.
Yet there was a time when he sold traditional antiques. ``Jeelly pans and
grandfather clocks - I was bored witless,'' he says. ``Anyway, the bottom's
fallen out of the antiques market. You can't get the stuff. People are too
aware.''
And what's made them aware? ``Television programmes like Going for a Song,
Lovejoy, Antiques Roadshow . . . '' Bridges gives a shrug. ``There are more
people at auctions bidding against dealers. And if someone calls you to view a
piece, they expect to make a fortune from it. If you don't offer what they
want, they get scared and say `we'll just hang on to it'.
``I'm sick of hearing people in the trade saying business is awful. But they
won't move because it's safe - what they sell has a recognised value at
auction. This is dangerous: you have to create an environment where people can
see an object's potential. That's why it says on the sign, `One day all antique
shops will be like this'. I can buy something for 50p at auction and sell it
here for #15.''
That may sound like robbery but, in fact, it's marketing. Ultimately, Bridges
aims to find bigger premises and charge an entrance fee. It's easy to see why.
Already browsers call to each other across the tiers:
``Hey, check this!''
``Wow!''
``Do you think it's too much for the living-room?''
``Could be.''
For me, a child of the fifties, it's like a Museum of My Youth. The
pastel-coloured uplighter lamps evoke the very quality of light. The great
glass ornaments - fish and cockerels - are giant versions of the birthday gifts
I gave my mother. Every few feet I pause, caught up in strands of memory. For a
child, that era was visually rich - every surface textured, coloured, or
embossed. But could I bear to live with such over-decoration now?
Bridges tells of one customer, the comedian Bruce Morton, who bought a cocktail
bar with matching stools. ``It was covered in tiger skin. He had to have it. It
was so awful it was great.''
What then are the hallmarks of the fifties, sixties, and seventies gear Bridges
sells? ``The main thing is it was very trendy in a given period . . . maybe
only for a couple of months. The furniture then was the same as the clothes.
Everything was very transitional. But most of the stuff here was expensive
enough in its time. People may remember the style of a table or a lamp, but
probably not in their mum's house. Chances are they saw it in the shops. ``Even
so, this is not the kind of stuff you pass on to your grandchildren. Folk throw
it out. They smash it up and sneak it out so the neighbours won't see. It's as
hard to get as Chippendale.''
I ask if we really had such bad taste then. Bridges answers with a parable:
``See that standing lamp - the orange cylinder? That was in Rab C Nesbitt in
Mary-doll's house. But it was part of the set on NB, the arts programme, too.''
The artefacts have appeared in productions such as Hamish MacBeth and Shallow
Grave. And he constructs props, too. ``My background is in design. I wanted to
go to art school when I was young, but my parents said: `No, you'll look for a
job.' So I started making things - wacky mirrors and the like.
``People saw them in hairdressers and asked me to do stuff for them. I did the
Trading Post restaurants, Ichi-Ni-San, and upstairs in Nico's in Sauchiehall
Street. But it's almost impossible to be a designer in Glasgow. It's like
everything else. You have to go to London to make it.''
During July, Bridges went to Millport instead. ``These guys there were worried
about the number of businesses closing down, and decided they had to attract
people to the island. They came up with the idea of holding a Country and
Western Festival, then went to the BBC for props, and the BBC put them on to
me.''
Bridges spent every spare moment building false shop-fronts for the event which
was held in August. A local pub became the Tombstone Saloon complete with the
sign of a noose. The newsagent's became the Nashville Gazette. ``The enthusiasm
of the people carried me along,'' says Rony. ``But you do get the odd one.
Sometimes I'm was a ladder hammering and I heard this ``Tut-tut'' behind me and
I felt like turning round and saying: ``Look, do you want to be able to buy a
pint of milk on this island?''
But you can't please everyone.
Down in the body of the kirk, the sedate business of selling pine goes on. How
does the pine seller like his neighbour? ``Oh, he thinks I bring life to the
place,'' says Rony. ``Because it's a church people used to whisper - `How much
is a chest of drawers?' Now I have the Stones playing and he picks up custom
from people who come in to see me.''
According to Rony the minister of the church was the original for Rikki
Fulton's Reverend Jolly. ``He still comes in and asks where his pulpit has
gone. He's none too pleased when he hears it's in a restaurant in Italy.''

q In 1993 I decided to top up my pension contributions and on the
recommendation of a friend (I am a schoolteacher) saw a representative from
Laurentian Life. He advised me to take out a policy with contributions of #25
per month. Six months ago Laurentian merged with Lincoln. In the meantime I
discovered it would have been possible for me to increase my contributions to
my main policy by taking out AVCs.
This was not explained to me by the Laurentian representative and in a
subsequent questionnaire which Lincoln sent out I stated this. Lincoln says
that this is not an area it is looking at since I did not give up my teachers'
pension scheme.
I stopped making monthly payments three months ago and Lincoln has now sent a
transfer form. The amount seems incredibly low considering my #25 per month
premiums for more than two years. Should I agree to this settlement?
n This is the sort of thing which has given the pensions industry a bad name.
The transfer value is so low because the costs of setting up the policy,
including commission paid to the salesman, were taken at the start of the
contract. So most of your premiums have gone towards this. Only from this year
has the industry had to spell out exactly what the costs are as a matter of
course.
Your only options are to take the transfer amount and put it into an AVC or to
leave the policy paid up. The amount is so small you may as well take the
transfer value. The Scottish teachers' superannuation scheme has an AVC with
Prudential and, with hindsight, this would have been the best option for you.
q I need to be clear on the inheritance tax position on assets passing between
husband and wife before I finalise details of a term assurance policy being
taken on my own life. Can you confirm that on first death there is no
inheritance tax payable on the estate passing to the remaining spouse?
It has been suggested to me that the new policy should be written in trust for
my wife but I cannot see the benefit in this if no tax is payable.
n Transfers between spouses either during lifetime or on death are exempt from
inheritance tax. This applies whether the assets are left direct or in trust.
Life policies written in trust are commonly used in inheritance tax planning
for beneficiaries other than a spouse where the proceeds of a policy can be
omitted from the rest of the estate.
There is no inheritance tax benefit in writing the term policy in trust for
your wife, but there can be a cash flow advantage as it is likely that the
proceeds of the policy will be paid to her quicker. In the case of a policy
written in trust it is not necessary to await confirmation of your estate
before obtaining payment of the proceeds. This will be made on production of
the death certificate.
q I read earlier in the year that moves were afoot to allow the trading of
British investment trust shares on the US stock market. If such a move does
come about what type of investment trust is likely to benefit from it?
I hold a mixture of three UK income trusts and three international income
trusts with a view to boosting my retirement funds in some 15 years time and
would like to hear your opinion before investing further.
n A US listing is only practical for the larger trusts and is likely to appeal
only to those trusts investing internationally. Greater exposure to US
investors may possibly increase demand for the shares concerned, but as far as
you are concerned an American listing has little relevance.
q I am aged 72 and my wife is 62 (both retired) and we are still living in our
family house which is valued at about #150,000. We have no mortgage and no
dependent relatives. My company pension is index-linked and together with our
state pensions amounts to about #20,000 per annum.
We have Norwich Union Asset Management Funds with a current value of #57,000
which have shown an excellent return since we bought them in 1983. We also have
a Provident Mutual Life Managed Fund, worth #46,000, which shows good gains
since we bought the first issue in 1983.
Norwich Union may go public and Provident Mutual is being taken over by General
Accident. We have #4250 in a Halifax 90-day extra account and #2250 in premium
bonds. In view of the pending changes within Norwich Union and Provident
Mutual, should we change our investment portfolio?
n Neither of the two events of itself suggests the need for changes in your
portfolio, but there are other more serious considerations. It seems to us to
be tempting providence to have more than #100,000 tied up in just two products,
however well you make think they have served you.
Given the capital at your disposal you should have a broad spread of
investments, and you would be wise to seek the advice of a good stockbroker to
see how best you could work towards such an objective. You seem well served by
your pensions, and the capital is there to provide the icing on the cake.
q Last year I set up my own business and I understand that in some
circumstances it is not necessary to provide the tax office with a full-scale
set of accounts. If this is the case, can you give me details of the rules for
this concession?
n A simplified system of return of profits for small businesses was first
introduced for the tax year ended April 5, 1990, and it applied where annual
turnover before expenses was less than #10,000. This limit applied up to April
5, 1992, when it was increased to #15,000 for accounts submitted after that
date. The Inland Revenue will accept from such businesses a simple three-line
summary of profits, that is total turnover less total expenses equals net
profit.
This simplified system does not do away with the necessity of maintaining
business records, as the Inspector may require more detailed information in
some cases, and it is important that records of income and expenditure are
available.
There is a helpful leaflet issued by the Revenue, number IR104, which explains
the system and provides information on the type of expenditure allowable and
how to claim allowances for capital items.
q I am 66 and have an annual gross income of approximately #14,500 which
includes state pension of #6268, a small private pension and earnings from
part-time employment. My wife is in full-time pensionable employment and her
income is about #22,000 per annum. She will retire in three-and-a-half years.
I have a pension fund of #45,000 and would now like to benefit from the
tax-free sum of some #11,000. To do this I would require to commit myself to
full pension when this is not actually needed. On the other hand, my part-time
employment could end at any time.
My adviser believes that current interest rates are particularly low and that I
am still a little young to purchase a life-time annuity. He, therefore,
suggests a ``drawdown plan'' which allows for flexibility in drawing pension
from the fund as required.
He has made abundantly clear to me the disadvantages as well as the advantages
of the scheme. He has also advised that the cost will be just under #3000 and
various other charges including 0.03% per month of the fund value will be
incurred.
The dilemma is whether to take the lump sum and full pension now, albeit at low
interest rates, or enter the drawdown plan with its high charges and the risk
of my having to take full pension from it, sooner rather than later.
n Most companies offering personal pension income withdrawal plans specify a
minimum fund size of at least #50,000, indeed many specify #100,000. Your fund
of #34,000 after allowing for the lump sum is really too small for the plan
taking account of charges. Even the full #45,000 is barely viable.
The return from the fund has to be equivalent to the annuity you could buy and
once charges are added it is quite likely the capital would be gradually
eroded. Once the fund falls too far you have to convert to an annuity. How the
fund was performing would be a constant worry. It would be safer in the long
run to buy an annuity from the outset and save the income until you need it.

<HEADLINE>EU animal welfare proposals condemned as `unworkable'</HEADLINE>

THERE has been widespread condemnation throughout South-west Scotland of a
consultation document which is aimed at tightening up regulations on the
transport of animals.
Farmers, auction markets, livestock hauliers and the Road Hauliers' Association
rejected the proposals which were discussed at a well-attended meeting in
Castle Douglas.
The controversial changes are contained in a European Union consultation
document. The deadline for comments is December 15.
It is recommended that the maximum journey time available for animals is eight
hours, followed by a rest period of 24 hours.
This would apply to all livestock transported over a distance greater than 50km
or 31 miles.
The time starts when an animal leaves the farm and includes waiting time at the
market and the journey to its destination.
If this cannot be completed the market would have to provide accommodation,
food and drink for the animals.
Extended times would be available for certain animals and there are options for
markets and hauliers to upgrade to EU standards which could prove costly.
At the meeting at Wallets Marts it was agreed that strong representations
should be made against the implementation of the directive because of its
detrimental effect on farmers and allied industries in rural areas.
Robin Anderson, manager of Wallets Marts at Castle Douglas, said: ``The
directive in its present form is impracticable and unworkable as far as auction
marts are concerned and the institute is sending a delegation to the Ministry
to make this clear.
``Markets would have to provide lairage for the animals for 24 hours if they
could not be transported in time. At our biggest sale we have 18,000 sheep and
you can see just how impracticable it would be. Like many markets our buyers
and sellers come from all over the country and it would just not be possible
for most to get the animals home within the space of the eight hours.''
Robert Hamilton, manager of Harrison &amp; Hetherington at Lockerbie, also said it
would be detrimental to the livestock trade.
``If an animal left the farm at 6am for a sale which started at 10am it could
be several hours before it is sold which would leave little time for it to be
taken to its destination.
``What they are talking about is just not workable and whoever drafted it has
not given any consideration for the commercial implications to what they are
doing'', he said.
John Thomson, a director of Thomson Roddick &amp; Laurie, added: ``There is a
misunderstanding of the welfare side of this and it should be kicked into
touch. It is our livelihood and we are not out to cause ill-heath and cruelty.''

The Herald's regular team of reviewers listens to
the best of the latest sounds
Loads and Loads More, Happy Mondays (London)
q.Instead of saying ``London'' on its sleeve, this should really be on the
Manchester label, man, shouldn't it? Self-determination and all that. But
that's these smarmy metropolitans for you. Too organised, they are. Us Northern
primitives come up with the art, and all these Cockney barrow-boys fill their
pockets by taking care of the business. Poor old Mondays. They did not sit up
straight at the back and pay attention. That's what gave their hits their
unravelled charm. And that's what sank their Mancunian record label. Remember
them this way, via 16 original singles and seven essential re-mixes. Wrote For
Luck, Step On, Kinky Afro, Loose Fit, Lazyitis: for these we salute you by
spitting vehemently towards London, Mondays.
Made In Heaven, Queen (EMI)
q.Dead Freddie bellows in histrionic fashion from the vale of the undead. His
accomplices apply fresh paint to his gravestone. Queen fans are happy. But then
they always were easily pleased. This posthumous album ends with 22 minutes of
ambient tosh. Elsewhere there are the lines: ``Ba ba ba ba bap bap ba baah/ La
la la la la lah/ You don't fool me/ You don't fool me.'' You have been warned.
Mara, Runrig (Chrysalis)
q.Ochone. Ochone. Tattie scone. A further instalment of yon old-fangled stuff
from the bloke with the sucked-in cheekbones, and the other blokes who've
listened to too many Gentle Giant albums. Place this on your stereogram and you
can engage in much listless and melancholic hand-wringing. Ideal for folk who
don't much like music, but they do like a good listless hand-wring and a
melancholy hokey-cokey. But never mind Mara, gie' us a new album of the laconic
Caledonian funkateering of Michael Marra.
DAVID BELCHER
Prokofiev/Ravel: Piano Concertos, Martha Argerich (Deutsche Grammophon)
q.Collectors' item. It's exactly 30 years since Martha Argerich, then a
24-year-old unknown from Buenos Aires, exploded on to the music scene after
winning the Chopin Competition in Warsaw. Within two years she made her
recording debut on Deutsche Grammophon's famous yellow label with a pair of
concertos that had critics reaching for the word ``definitive''. These -
Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto and Ravel's G Major - are now re-issued on
DG's splendid ``Originals'' series, where the disc is blacked up to resemble a
mini-vinyl. The recordings, with the Berlin Phil conducted by Claudio Abbado
(who was also making his DG debut) are as stunning today as three decades ago.
Nobody has matched Argerich's sheer fire in the Prokofiev or sparkle in the
Ravel. They were one-offs from a pianist who was to become a rare and elusive
bird. The chance to have them again, in this form, should be snatched.
A Life in Music, Isaac Stern (Sony)
q.Bumper collection of concertos from wee Isaac Stern, whose sound, with its
sweetness (too saccharine for some) and lyrical intensity, is one of the most
genuinely individual and instantly recognisable in the business. Brahms and
Beethoven feature on this double CD set. In the violin concertos by both
composers, Stern is accompanied by the New York Phil with conductors Zubin
Mehta and Daniel Barenboim respectively.
In Brahms's Double Concerto, Stern is joined by his old compadre Leonard Rose
on cello with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, while in
Beethoven's Triple Concerto the full Stern gang - the wee man, cellist Rose and
pianist Eugene Istomin - give a rattlingly extrovert performance that always
made this recording (from 1964) one of the best, and recalls too their old,
classic CBS recordings of Beethoven's Piano Trios. An excellent testament for
Stern fans.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
High Life, Wayne Shorter (Verve)
q.Nine years on from his previous album, Joy Rider, Shorter returns with his
keen ear for melody intact. The characteristically forlorn soprano and more
robust tenor saxophone styles are to the fore in a lushly orchestrated set that
evokes Bolero-ish romanticism, recalls Weather Report's more elegant jazz/rock
passages and, inevitably with producer Marcus Miller's bass aboard, kicks the
occasional ass in a thoroughly agreeable fashion.
Big Girl, Candy Dulfer (BMG)
q.With a little help from her main mentor David Sanborn, in person and
alongside other sampled stars, the Dutch alto saxophonist adds rap, hip-hop,
Latin grooves and soul balladeering to her usual funky rhythm and blues stew.
Capably played and sung, and not without its excitements (take a bow, trumpeter
David Rockefeller), but on balance more the sort of jazz fusion you do aerobics
to than turn cartwheels over.

IN the special schools category, Russell Landscapes Ltd won an award for work
carried out at Blackfriars Primary School for Glasgow Development Agency. The
school itself was involved in the design of the project, which involves themed
landscaping around the school, including a rainforest area, wildlife garden and
adventure playground.
In transforming the site, paths, pond, a grassed area and wildflower meadow
were created and a log pile from felled trees made an ideal place for seating.
The Wildlife Garden project has not only transformed the land at the school,
improving the environment, but it has also provided a valuable educational
facility by creating an outdoor classroom demonstrating the ecology of the land.
The project was run as a Glasgow Works exercise with Glasgow Workers employed
by Russell Landscapes, who selected the candidates at interview and then put a
training programme in place. Gorbals Initiative provided guidance, counselling
support and training for the Glasgow Workers.
The fact that the project has picked up such a prestigious award also
emphasises a key point in Glasgow Works - that long-term unemployed people are
capable of doing a quality job of importance to the city.
Ken Wardrop of the Glasgow Development Agency said: ``Scottish Natural
Heritage, Scottish Enterprise and BALI have all recognised the quality and
importance of the work involved in this project and it reinforces the message,
particularly to employers, that a lengthy period out of work should not
necessarily act as a barrier to an individual getting employment.''
Ian Russell, director of Russell Landscapes, who had 12 Glasgow Workers on two
separate projects, said: ``When these men came on to the project they had been
out of work for more than 12 months and not one of them had experience of the
landscape industry.''
During this period the men worked with the company three days a week and
attended Langside College where they went through a personal development
programme.
The Blackfriars School project was jointly funded by the SRC and GDA, with a
significant amount of private sector sponsorship as well, including #15,000
from the Junior Chamber of Commerce and financial assistance from the European
Social Fund.
The project also picked up a commendation at the Environmental Regeneration
Awards, given annually by Scottish Natural Heritage and Scottish Enterprise.

Born Fi' Dead
Laurie Gunst
Payback Press, CanongateBooks Ltd, #9.99
WESLEY picks me up at the airport and guns the car along Hope Road with the sun
slipping behind the Grand Ridge of the Blue Mountains. At Papine the wooden
doors of rumshops are wide open and the boom-boxes send waves of music over the
heads of those trudging up into the foohills. A bus jerks out ahead of us,
bodies hanging from the windows, spilling out the door and we judder to a halt.
Wesley, wary as I've never known him, cusses and touches the snub black gun in
his waistband. He is angry.
``Dawta, why ya come back now, huh? Me no waant to say, but me t'ink dis time
fe Jamaica alone . . . yunno? Jes dis week a white writer get mash-up bad. Dey
bad-bwoys just box'im in him head and kick'im batty. 'Im lucky him not kapoomed
with a bullet, ya know.''
It was a good question and I had no good answer. This was 1980. Jamaica was in
the midst of the undeclared civil war of its bloodiest ever general election,
and here I was coming back. Again.
Journalists from around the world were coralled in the Pegasus Hotel, the
grounds patrolled by armed guards. What was I: foolhardy, stupid? Fear seeped
in with the soft night winds.
There were 891 murders that year in an island of three million souls. Most
stemmed from political warfare. Jamaica's experiment in democratic socialism
under Michael Manley's People's National Party was ending in what Manley called
a hail of bullets and a river of blood. Destabilized by the US, demoralised by
food shortages, the gunmen were in control.
What drew me back again and again to an island of dream-like landscapes and
nightmare visions remains for me still something of a mystery. The fairest
island that eyes have beheld, Columbus said, where the land seems to touch the
sky. The paradox of an island so heart-achingly beautiful and so violently
tormented.
Yet a place where a piratical, rebellious spirit remains alive in a country
with a history which gives it no spiritual right to beauty. It is heaven and
hell.
So I couldn't tell Wesley why I was back. Whatever drew me there worked its
magic too on Laurie Gunst. Except that while she cannot name the mystery she
has penetrated some of its darkest secret corners. An American journalist and
Harvard history scholar, she has written the definitive story of Jamaica's
political gangs, tracing their roots and legacy.
In 1984, after researching the slave trade from West Africa to the Spanish
Caribbean, she went back to the island she had grown to love, this time to
work. She had a post at the University of the West Indies. But her true reason
for being there was to take a journey, brave or foolish, through the Jamaican
posse underworld.
Her story begins in the ghettos of Kingston, a chessboard of war zones with
human pieces. For as long as Jamaicans can remember, politicians have armed and
paid Kingston's gunmen to enforce their rule and power in the slums. Gunst
traces the history of the posses, from the corrupt racketeering of fledgling
politicians in the run-up to independence in 1962 to the drugs-running in the
US that is its legacy. This is the untold story of tribal gunmen who fought for
Manley's PNP and his archrival Edward Seaga's Jamaican Labour Party.
As she sat in rumshops and tenement yards, watching men light glass pipes of
crack instead of the ganja they would have smoked in mellower times, she heard
the first rumours of the outlaw exodus to the US that was the aftermath of that
bloody 1980 election.
The rankings who controlled Kingston, divvied it up for political masters, were
leaving the ghettos for the cities of the US, transforming their island gangs
into mainland drug posses. The money they made from the drug trade snapped the
leash that once bound them to their political patrons who were faced with an
outlaw underworld they could no longer control. So they turned the police loose
to execute their former paladins. The posse men fled to become indispensable to
the Colombians, Cubans and Panamanians who control the cocaine trade and needed
street dealers to sell crack.
Gunst crossed the line of demarcation, the us and them, to become a trusted ear
and voice for the ``sufferers'' - the poorest of Jamaica's dirt poor. The oral
sources come she believes from the same tradition as the griot of West Africa,
the storyteller historians who preserve the legends of a people.
With a meld of scholarly research and sharp journalistic observation she traces
the roots of the gangster culture from slavery, with the street dons and
politicians taking on the mantle of slave overseers and owners, onto the rubbly
streets of Kinsgton now. She follows the posse members to the US, onto the
meanest streets and into the prisons and crack houses where many ended up. She
traces too the roots of the cocaine trade, from its first appearance in the
pockets, up the noses, of JLP gunmen in 1980.
This book is a fine piece of investigative journalism, jettisoning any pretence
at objectivity, distilling dispassion and compassion in equal measure. The
seeds of the bitter harvest sewn by the slave trade, nourished by colonialism,
is reaped now in the blank-eyed crack culture. It holds other lessons too, not
least the terrifying legacy of hopeless deprivation. As the twig is broken, so
the tree is bent.

Ken Gallacher previews what could be one of the hottest nights of the year for
cornet fans
OVER the years I have listened to most of the top trumpet - or cornet players -
in the jazz world and Louis Armstrong apart, and he is always apart, there have
been few who have excited me as much as Warren Vache.
The 44-year-old cornettist from New Jersey will be the Jazz Co-Operative's
second star billing of their season when he appears at the Moir Hall on
November 28 and it's safe to say that those devotees of his playing will not be
disappointed.
Vache seems sometimes to have been born out of his time. He should have been
around for the cutting contests in the thirties because his approach to the
music contains the aggression and competitiveness which were the trademarks of
such swing era players as Roy Eldridge and Charlie Shavers.
Vache may have missed Shavers in person but he knew Eldridge and he learned a
valuable lesson from the man who was dubbed ``Little Jazz''. It happened when
Vache was playing at the later Eddie Condon's Club - the one on 54th Street in
Manhattan, which was next door to the ``second'' Jimmy Ryan's after it had been
forcibly moved from 52nd Street.
A few years back, on one of his visits to Glasgow, we were standing after the
concert while Warren indulged his taste for malt whiskies and Jimmy Reid opined
that the cutting contests of the thirties were something which he had deplored.
Warren disagreed. He had missed the best of these competitions but he still
spoke of how Eldridge had shown him how things used to be.
``I walked out of Condon's one night,'' he recalled, ``and it used to be that
when the band was onstage in Condon's then the band in Ryan's was off.
``We finished earlier in Condon's and so when I came out there was Roy and he
asked me if I could help him out. He said he was kinda juiced and he needed
help from a younger guy and so I got the horn out again, went into Ryan's and
took the stand with him and his group.
``Well, I played first and then, wouldn't you know Roy came in and he played
left-handed and jingled his coins in his pocket with his right hand and he blew
me off that stand. I looked at him and he just kinda laughed.''
``He was old then but he could blow, especially if he thought some young cat
might steal his thunder. I learned from that. It has stayed with me through all
these years...... ''
What that may have done is give Vache that cutting edge to his tone, that love
of taking chances which mark his playing, and that sense of tradition which has
made him one of the greats.
He also had Pee Wee Erwin as a teacher, of course, and that helped him too. He
will enthuse over Armstrong above all others but will add the names of Billy
Butterfield and Bobby Hackett, Jack Sheldon and Don Fagerquist, Clifford Brown
and Blue Mitchell and, also Erwin who taught him so well over a dozen of his
formative years.
He will tell you: ``Pee Wee was one of the most underestimated musicians of all
time. No-one knows how good a trumpeter that man was. He had me playing
classical music too, Charlier Etudes, for instance. One day I was playing one
of these for him and I messed up. He sat there and he played it from memory,
without the music, and he was note perfect. He was special, very special.''
Three weeks after Erwin's death in l981 Vache recorded Buddy Bolden's Blues as
a tribute to his teacher. He resisted all requests for that song after that
time at the North Sea Jazz Festival in Holland because Erwin had meant so much
to him.
Eighteen months ago he recorded it again in a duet with the bass player Michael
Moore. It was as emotional as the first version, played straight from the
heart, and if we're lucky he might do it again on Tuesday week.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Frank Gilroy summed him up neatly when he
wrote recently: ``He soars. He dares. He works without a net.''
That's Warren Vache. Come. Listen. You won't be disappointed.

Wise Enough to Play the Fool: A Biography ofDuncan Macrae
Priscilla Barlow
John Donald, Edinburgh, #14.95
YOU might wait years for a theatrical production when absolutely everything
works. When all the sweat, the training, the rehearsals blend together with the
right script at the right time to create a moment of magic.
I experienced it on my first non-panto theatre visit, seeing Duncan Macrae in
Let Wives Tak Tent, the Scots adaptation from Moliere by Robert Kemp.
I had never heard of Macrae or the beautiful young Gudrun Ure who appeared with
him. The lasting image is of Macrae's extravagantly exaggerated bows, the
sweeps of his plumed hat as the curtain calls went on and on.
He had taken London by storm and I went out into the night with a love of the
theatre which has never gone away.
Priscilla Barlow's biography does not go overboard on this kind of euphoria. It
is not smell of the grease paint, roar of the crowd stuff, but a sound academic
record, produced in association with Theatre Studies Publications of Glasgow
University.
Of particular interest is the account of how Macrae happened upon the scene
which he strutted so well, of how he has become part of theatre folklore.
He was born in Maryhill, Glasgow, in 1905, son of a policeman whose father came
from Sutherland crofting stock, christened John Duncan Graham Macrae. He went
to Allan Glen's fee-paying school and then to Glasgow University with the
intention of becoming an engineer, switched to Jordanhill College of Education,
graduating as a teacher in 1927.
He had a passion for the amateur theatre and some would say that, through a
lack of discipline, he never became a true professional.
To his friends he was always John, or Big John. It was not until 1943 when he
was 38 and understudying Alastair Sim's Mr Bolfry in London that he became
known to the public as Duncan Macrae. Sim suggested it had a more theatrical
ring.
There is a nicely balanced account of Macrae, the actor and the man, with
little to separate the two. A larger-than-life personality, he loved the
limelight to the extent he was frequently accused of stealing it from others.
He did not know how to melt into the background, nor did he want to.
A favourite trick was to smell a stage flower as he lurked at the back, knowing
all eyes were on him. Oddly, although he could get plenty of laughter, he was
mystified as to what caused it.
Being on the scene during what Baxter describes as the Camelot years at the
Citizens', between 1948 and 1952, provided a boost to Macrae's career. He rose
to the heights in several great roles, in Jamie the Saxt, Gog and Magog and as
Oliphant in Let Wives Tak Tent. He was wise enough to play the fool, which
always brings in more money, appearing in pantomime, mainly at the Alhambra and
Empire theatres, Glasgow. These were diversions easily kept in perspective.
He died in March, 1967, having suffered a brain tumour while preparing to play
Long John Silver at the Lyceum, Edinburgh.

AT the British Association of Landscape Industries (BALI) annual awards
ceremony held last night at the Glasgow Hilton, the winners of the best
landscape work in Britain were announced by Lord Lindsay. More than 300 people
from the landscape industry in the UK and abroad attended the function which
was being held in Glasgow for the second year in succession. The overall Grand
Award was won by Lanrec Contracts Ltd of Motherwell for the Provand's Lordship
Garden on behalf of the Glasgow Development Agency.
Scotland fared particularly well this year, not only winning the Grand Award
but also two Principal Awards and six other awards. There were 12 categories
and 35 awards made, plus a Special Schools Award which was presented to Russell
Landscapes Ltd for its work at the Blackfriars Primary School Wild Life garden.
This was a joint project with the schoolchildren who were given an insight into
how a derelict area could be developed for the benefit of all.
Mr Bill Gillespie, chairman of the adjudicators panel, said: ``The awards are
judged on several criteria including presentation of entry material, standard
of workmanship, quality of material, the variety and complexity of the scheme
and the contractors response to any challenges presented. Principal award
winners in each category all scored very high on all counts.''
However, it was Lanrec who impressed the judges and also the GDA. Alan Sproul
of the Glasgow Development Agency, said: ``It needs to be recognised that
landscape construction is a skilled business and Lanrec's work demonstrates
this admirably. The Provand's Lordship Garden should be viewed within the
context of the Cathedral area and as part of a wider #2m initiative that has
been pursued over the past 10 years as an important element in the economic and
physical revival of the historic heart of Glasgow.
``Blackfriars Primary School Wildlife Garden was the joint work of Russell
Landscapes, Donald Edwards Partnership and the schoolchildren themselves who
have had a major educational opportunity to develop an otherwise derelict area.
In its own way this project is equally important as the Provand's Lordship
Garden although its profile is not as high.
Chairman Bill Gillespie, said: ``The Provand's Lordship Garden is an
outstanding example of landscape construction. Lanrec Contracts has met the
exacting requirements of this scheme and the standards of workmanship are of
the highest order. The School Wildlife Garden was a delightful scheme using
readily available materials and involved all the schoolchildren from start to
finish.''
The BALI National Landscape Awards are made annually by the British Association
of Landscape Industries to encourage and foster a high standard of landscape
contracting by its members. The aim of the awards is to bring greater awareness
of the participation of landscape industries in creating an improved
environment and to draw attention to the best contributions made to this aim.
BALI has more than 700 members who represent just over 13,000 employees and
provide #500m turnover per annum.

A NEW farm assurance scheme targeted at the dairy sector is due to come on
stream next month, it was revealed in London yesterday.
The scheme is designed to guarantee quality, product traceability and farm
animal welfare in response to increasing pressure from retailers and consumers.
``In the future there will be a two-tier system for the dairy industry; one for
those that just produce milk and another for those that aim for the top end of
the market,'' said Richard Smith, chairman of the Yorkshire-based Northern Milk
Partnership, in unveiling the group's Star Initiative.
He said the group's strategy was to capture and retain the top 20% of the
market through the partnership between its 1100 producers and Northern Foods
who supply most of the leading supermarkets as well as the Express and Dale
Farm doorstep delivery companies.
Prior to milk deregulation last November traceability of product back to the
farm was virtually impossible because of milk bulking. The partnership's closed
chain system enables tight record-keeping and allows bar codes on the final
product to be used to pinpoint initial source.
The group has also produced tight quality standards and a new award scheme
designed to encourage members to improve quality well beyond the minimum
standards.
The third strand of its strategy is to apply strict farm welfare codes based on
those of the Ministry of Agriculture but buttressed by new rules drawn up and
agreed by NMP producer-directors and members. It will be policed by Northern
Foods farm liaison officers.
``Farm animal welfare is no longer a fringe issue. Consumers increasingly want
to know that the food they buy has been produced in an acceptable way,'' said
producer-director Peter Grice who co-ordinated development of the initiative.
``They want to know it has been produced in the safest possible way as far as
their own health is concerned and in a way which also maximises the health and
well-being of the food producing animals.
``It is a demand which will undoubtedly grow. To such an extent indeed that it
is not hard to envisage a future in which there is little or no market for
foods that do not offer these sorts of assurances.''
The scheme will start on December 1. Initially it will be targeted at retail
and franchisee customers but a consumer initiative at a later date has not been
ruled out.
In Scotland preparations are under way for the introduction of a farm assurance
scheme for milk. The National Farmers' Union of Scotland's milk committee has
drawn up a code of practice in consultation with leading figures in the milk
industry and consumer organisations.
Caroline Lang, commodity director for milk at the NFUS, said that the timing
for developing the draft proposals into a full-blown scheme had not yet been
agreed.

THE Scottish NFU yesterday reaffirmed its opposition to plans by meat plants to
seek a #3.50 levy on cattle to help meet the cost of slaughterhouse precautions
against BSE.
John Ross, president of the Scottish NFU, met the Institute of Auctioneers and
Appraisers in Edinburgh yesterday. He said later: ``The meat trade wouldn't
think much of it if farmers started charging them levies for the costs they
have to bear in complying with Government regulations. There would be no end to
levies if we agreed this principle.''

Her boyfriend is a total dummy. Her I.Q. is even lower than her hip
measurement. And her days are spent posing at the mirror of a garish pink
plastic beauty salon. Who is that girl? No, not a supermodel - although the
similarities are striking - but Barbie, the dazzling superdoll star of our
kinky boot special.
So what makes a boot kinky? Answer: an overactive imagination. Knee-high boots
have too long been lodged in the fashion imagination as regulation footwear for
good-time girls.......girls such as Shirley Maclaine's tart-with-a-heart
character in Sweet Charity. For, in comparison with the fetishistic bondage
gear which has strutted down designer runways over recent years in the guise of
high fashion, don't knee-high boots seem positively demure?
As, at heart, is Barbie. She may bear an uncanny resemblance to the hooker from
hell. But don't be misled by that tousled mane of blonde hair, those dangly
earrings, or her perilously short skirts. She is a thoroughly respectable,
all-American (er, well. . . Malaysian-made) 36-year-old doll.
It's true that she is more brainless than the dizziest bimbo, but at least
Barbie knows a thing or two about fashion. And that is why she has made the
so-called kinky boot her footwear choice for the season.
For such a boot is suddenly the must-have fashion choice for a rather different
type of working girl - the type who may be running a personnel department
rather than a call-girl racket. It is the perfect partner for all those
knee-grazing sleeveless shifts which are fashion's latest contribution to the
executive wardrobe.
So throw away your those power-heeled courts. Sling your stilettos. And forget
those comfy pumps. If you want to get ahead in business, first get the boot.

A TALE with intriguing elements of secrecy and vanity in high places has just
emerged from the saleroom. A paragraph in the report of returns from a sale of
otherwise unremarkable paintings held by Bonhams on September 20 started me off
on its trail because a copy of Graham Sutherland's portrait of Sir Winston
Churchill was recorded as having sold for the astonishing sum of #23,000. This
price took the auction house by surprise because the estimate had been around
#3000.
The name of the artist who painted the copy was given as Peter of Dalkeith and,
thinking that this might be a misprint, I telephoned Bonhams painting
specialist James Olph. He was guarded but confirmed the artist's name, the
price of the picture, and the fact that it had been bought by someone who
insisted on remaining anonymous. Bonhams are not allowed even to reveal the
buyer's name to the artist. Mr Olph also told me that the copy was masterly and
had been copied directly from Sutherland's work, the portrait that Churchill
and his wife so disliked it was destroyed by one or other of them sometime in
the 60s.
Peter of Dalkeith, he said, was still alive but reluctant to talk to the press.
He suggested that I write him a letter requesting an interview which Mr Olph
would forward but he did not hold out a great deal of hope. Within a couple of
days, however, I had a reply giving the artist's address, his telephone number
and agreeing to speak to me. There was one proviso, I was not to question him
about his parents. His mother was Scottish and that was why he had legally
changed his name to the impressive sounding Peter of Dalkeith, where he has
family connections.
The tale he had to tell was fascinating. He is a professional artist, 57years
old now, but as a young art student, he was friendly with Francis Bacon, Henry
Moore, Graham Sutherland, and the famous forger Tom Keating.
In 1954, Sutherland was commissioned by the House of Commons to paint
Churchill's portrait in celebration of his 80th birthday. In 1961, Peter was
copying a Velasquez painting in the National Gallery when he was approached by
Tom Keating who suggested that they co-operate because Keating had difficulty
painting hands. It was Keating who offered Peter ``a very important
commission'' but warned that it had to be kept secret because it was highly
clandestine. The fee was #500, a considerable sum in the early 60s. Keating's
share was to be #100.
Peter was taken, blindfolded, in a taxi to a secret address, a flat or hotel
room in Central London where he was told he had 10 days to make a copy of
Sutherland's masterly portait of Churchill which was standing on an easel in
the centre of the room. The client who wanted the copy, he was told, was a
``merchant banker'' but Keating later let slip this was not true and ``it would
be a real shock if the identity of the client was known''.
When the work was finished, Peter was told his client was very pleased. He was
paid and returned home again by taxi but not blindfolded this time. If he
thought that was the end of the matter, he was mistaken, for some time later
Keating told him he must return the commission fee because the client was
suspicious that some sort of switch had been made and wanted his money back. By
selling a motor bike, Peter raised the money and found himself the possessor of
his copy of the portrait.
It was shown by him to Sutherland in 1965 and the original artist declared that
he was ``stunned'' by its faithfulness to his own work but urged Peter to keep
its existence secret. In 1978, however, in the interests of posterity, he
replied in writing to a questionnaire Peter sent him about the painting and
this list of answers, signed by Sutherland, was included with the portrait in
Bonham's sale.
In it Sutherland says there is no concrete evidence that the original portrait
really was destroyed. He also gives details of his methods of portrait
painting, telling how he made a series of small studies over 10 sittings, with
three extra sittings for details like eyes and ears. He says that Churchill was
not an easy sitter but talked a lot during the sessions, often ``highly
indiscreetly''. Churchill, said Sutherland, did not appear to have physical
vanity but was concerned that the portrait should not denigrate his image
politically. When he heard that the Churchill family had destroyed his work,
Sutherland said he regretted that they did not have the courtesy to offer it
back to him. He was worried about the existence of a copy of his painting,
however, and that was the reason Peter of Dalkeith kept it hidden until all the
people involved in the project with him were dead.
When he recalls painting the copy, he says: ``I gave it my all. The original
was a magnificent work and for anyone to destroy it was an act of iconoclastic
vandalism. When Sutherland saw my portrait, however, he said that unless he was
told it was a copy, even he would not have known it was not his original
canvas. I took trouble to use exactly the same colours and pigments as he had
used - black and yellow ochre mainly. The chief difficulty was that Sutherland
was right-handed and I'm left-handed, so I was painting against his work
really.''
It is a major regret for Peter of Dalkeith that this copy portrait is the only
one of his works that has sold under his legal name. ``I've never sold a
Dalkeith apart from this one,'' he said. He has made his living painting copies
of Old Masters for owners who hang them on their walls and keep the originals
in the bank where thieves cannot get at them, or for clients who commissioned
him through his advertisement in Country Life. He painted copies of famous
pictures for them to hang in their homes and he said one client owns 42 copies
by him. The most popular copies he did were of Impressionist works and the
easiest to do were Old Masters because of the tight technique of the painting.
Sutherland was probably the hardest artist he ever copied because his technique
was much looser and also because of his ``idiosyncrasies''.
Peter of Dalkeith has given up making copies now because his eyesight is
failing but he still paints, doing what he calls his ``music paintings''
interpreting the work of artists like the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. He
hasn't sold any of these canvases but lives in hope.
``One day I know my turn will come. I hope I'm alive when it does. I would love
a major exhibition in Scotland before I die,'' he said.
He doesn't want to go down in art history simply as the man who painted a fine
copy of the most magnificent portrait of an aged statesman defying weakness and
mortality.
MARKET NEWS
ANOTHER item associated with Churchill was sold by Christie's in South
Kensington yesterday - a Sten gun, now deactivated, which he kept at Chartwell
during the war and on which he used to practise in case he had to defend
himself against Nazi invaders. The estimate for the gun was between #6000 and
#10,000.

<HEADLINE>Give us a quiche, but  make it one to savour</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975323421</RECORDNO>

I AM rapidly going off the word quiche. It has been so bastardised by the
purveyors of fast foods, where quiche is synonymous with thick soggy pastry and
a filling consisting of undercooked onion and undercooked poor quality bacon,
both set in a solid rubbery-textured egg filling. A real Quiche Lorraine is,
however, to be found. The best is made by Marks &amp; Spencer, much as it grieves
me to have to admit it! I wish I could say the best Quiche Lorraine was made by
Claire Macdonald, but M &amp; S's quiche just couldn't be bettered.
The trouble is that the very word ``quiche'' has lost its true meaning, and has
become the blanket term for any savoury tart, whatever the filling. I have
always understood a Quiche Lorraine to contain eggs, cream, cheese, and bacon,
but no onion.
On the other hand, there are any number of delicious fillings for a savoury
tart, and such a dish is versatile in that it can be a first course, or a main
course. It can be extremely useful food for a meal when those participating
don't eat meat, and because a savoury tart is fairly filling eating, for most
appetites all that is needed as an accompaniment is a good salad.
The other aspect of a savoury tart is that the pastry must be good, and in many
cases can be flavoured to complement the filling. For instance, in today's
recipe the filling is of onions, well cooked before being put on the cooked
pastry, and the pastry is rich and delicious with quite a high proportion of
grated cheese, and mustard powder, to accentuate the flavour of the cheese.
We make a tart with walnut pastry and a filling of leeks and goat's cheese -
the three flavours of walnuts, goat's cheese, and leeks are a perfect
combination. I also put cheese in the pastry for a smoked haddock and parsley
filling, or flaked almonds and garlic in the pastry for a mushroom filling. You
can experiment to suit your own tastes.
With two exceptions, which I will talk about in a moment, the balance of eggs,
yolks, and either milk or single cream is what makes or mars a savoury tart.
This is where the lower end of the market, ubiquitous quiches fall down so
badly, because they use whole eggs in their fillings, whereas to get the soft
and creamy texture so essential to a really good filling you need yolks and
whole eggs. I use the proportion of two whole eggs and two yolks to half a pint
of milk or single cream.
The filling needs to be cooked in a moderate oven till it barely wobbles when
the dish is shaken gently. This takes about 20 minutes. I find savoury tarts
nicest served warm, not hot and not cold, but somewhere in between. If you
serve them hot, they are almost impossible to slice without the filling
collapsing out at either side.
I mentioned two exceptions to the usual balance of eggs, yolks, and single
cream (or milk). These are tomatoes, or spinach. For a tomato tart I whiz
skinned and deseeded tomatoes (the seeds make the resulting puree too watery)
to a smooth puree, usually with basil leaves, and I use this instead of the
cream or milk. For a spinach tart I whiz the spinach in a processor, adding
cream cheese (such as Philadelphia) or creamy goat's cheese, and adding the
yolks and eggs to the spinach. As the fresh baby spinach cooks it can become
watery, and I find that if extra liquid is added in the form of either cream or
milk it can prove too sloppy for the yolks and eggs to set.
FRENCH ONION TART WITH CHEESE AND MUSTARD PASTRY
Serves 6.
For the pastry:
5oz plain flour
3oz butter, hard from the fridge and cut into bits
3oz cheddar cheese, grated
2 teaspoons mustard powder.
Put all the above ingredients into a food processor and whiz till the mixture
is crumblike in texture. Pat this firmly around the sides and base of a flan
dish approximately eight inches in diameter. Put the dish in the fridge for an
hour, then bake in a moderate oven, 350F, 180c, gas mark four till the pastry
is golden, about 25 minutes. You may need to push the sides of the pastry up
the sides of the dish with the back of a metal spoon during cooking time.
For the filling:
6 onions, skinned and sliced very thinly
3 tablespoons sunflower oil and 2oz butter
1-2 cloves of garlic, skinned and chopped very finely
2 whole eggs beaten well with 2 egg yolks and               !s pint single cream
Salt, freshly ground black pepper.
Heat the oil and melt the butter together in a wide saucepan and cook the
sliced onions over moderate heat for 10-15 minutes - stir from time to time so
that the onions don't stick during cooking. They will collapse in quantity, and
become very soft and turn brown at the edges. Add the chopped garlic towards
the end of the cooking time. Spoon this onion mixture over the cooked pastry,
and then stir the salt and pepper into the cream and egg and yolks mixture and
pour this in with the onions. Bake in a moderate  oven, as for the pastry, till
the custard just sets, about 15-20 minutes. Serve warm.

A SAD little story: last spring our garden blackbird seemed incapable of
settling into a regular, fluent song pattern. There were two hen birds around;
maybe he couldn't decide between them. One morning, as I was pruning the
gooseberries, came a desperate cackling and the two hen blackies shot round the
side of the house, followed by a steely blue blur, which picked one off six
feet from me and dived over the neighbour's bushes.
There stood a sparrowhawk on the grass, ``mantling'' its victim, covering it
with its strong round wings, all striped chest and staring yellow eyes. This
was evolution in action. The next day the cock blackbird relaxed into a full
throated song, his mind made up for him.
Sparrowhawks are hated because they kill garden birds, but really they are
garden birds themselves. Once you learn to recognise the broad wings and long
tail, the deep-chested russet females and the sharp little blue-grey males.
In the sixties, this species was one of the hardest hit by organochlorine
pesticides building up in their bodies at the top of the food chain, thinning
the eggshells and driving them on to the protected species list. Now they are
common. I know that an hour in the garden will always have me seeing one.
In summer it is easy: the scolding of swallows always mark their passage over
the field. With no warning one tears under the arch at the corner of the house,
over the roof of the car as you are opening a door, under the ash tree as you
play with the children. Always they trail excitement, a few seconds' jink and
dash burning on to your eye, setting fire to a morning.

Imagining Characters: Six Conversations About Women Writers
A S Byatt and Ignes Sodre
Chatto &amp; Windus, #16.99.
A DREAM is very different from a work of art . . . and yet, at the most basic
level, it must come from the same "place" in the mind. This is just one idea
thrown up by this unusual book by Byatt, the novelist and critic known
especially for her 1990 Booker prizewinner Possession, and Sodre, a Brazilian
psychoanalyst who has practised in Britain for over 20 years.
Byatt and Sodre first met when both were asked to discuss George Eliot's
Middlemarch at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature in October 1992, a key
theme being psychoanalysis and literature. Their lively encounter sparked off
Imagining Characters.
The novels it considers are Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, Charlotte Bronte's
Villette, George Eliot's Daniel Deronda, The Professor's House by Willa Cather,
Iris Murdoch's An Unofficial Rose, and Toni Morrison's Beloved.
Each chapter concentrates on one novel and opens with a plot summary, useful if
you haven't read the novel or just need your memory jogged. There are also
brief notes at the end of the book, including references and some further
reading.
I admit to having been initially somewhat sceptical about this book. Rebecca
Swift's enthusiastic, if rather vague, preface points out that the chosen
novels are ``six major tests from different periods in history'', but one of
the nagging questions in my mind was: Why these six writers, these particular
texts? Why, for instance, Mansfield Park, perhaps Austen's least popular novel
in which, as Byatt herself admits ``nobody can manage to like the heroine''?
Why Daniel Deronda, and not, say, The Mill on the Floss?
Two of the novels are American, one by a black writer. Is this tokenism? No
rationale is given beyond the taste, personal preference, and interest of the
two conversationalists. These are six novels which Byatt says at one point they
picked ``because they are books that we revisit and revisit so that they become
part of our selves''. No apologies.
Despite my cavils, I was converted once I began reading. I had wondered,
puritanically, if there wasn't something rather self-indulgent about the chosen
form. However, as the preface points out, the dialogue ``was a favourite of
Greek philosophers'', a means ``of making complex debate accessible'' and of
including the ``listener''.
I found this book highly readable and often illuminating. Its approach is
old-fashioned in a way, based on the view that ``we read novels primarily for
the pleasure of being told a story'' and characters are imagined and discussed
``as if they were people we knew''.
At the same time, Imagining Characters is enriched by Byatt's erudition,
intellectual energy and obvious engagement and Sodre's lucidly expressed
insights which draw on her psychoanalytic training. The major point of
reference seems to be Freud rather than the fashionable French, and the book is
largely jargon-free.
Threads linking the six novels emerge. The preface briefly mentions shared
elements such as underlying archetypal structures and there is much fascinating
discussion of the way these novels use or echo fairytales.
There is consideration too, of the novelists' concern with the thwarted
energies of women - a theme which, for Byatt, ``recurs most powerfully in all
the novels we are looking at''.
The fictional representation of place and space is another recurring topic,
``the relations between human beings and the houses that contain them''; and
the intertextual relations between these and other works are explored, often
revealingly.
The reading of Villette was, for this reader, particularly stimulating as was
the final chapter on ``Dreams and Fictions'' which pulls the book together.
Overall, the way in which Byatt draws on her own experience as a novelist also
lends her commentary special immediacy.
I wonder who will be the audience for this book, however. It doesn't seem quite
aimed at the "ordinary reader", and neither is it a standard academic work.
With luck, it may fall into the hands of those who simply love literature or
have questioning minds.

n Singer Carol Laula tells Ann Donald about her late-night reading.
I have been reading a brilliant book by E L Doctorrow called Ragtime which is
set in America of the early 1900s. It's a real patchwork of factual and
fictional characters which focuses on two fictional families and actual
historical characters like Sigmund Freud, Harry Houdini, and Evelyn Nesbit, who
was a Hollywood starlet of the time.
The families have no names but are referred to as ``mother'', ``father'' and
``young boy with a sailor suit'' in the case of the all-American rich family
and, in the case of the Jewish immigrant family, as ``mamie'', ``tatie'' and
``wee girl in a pinafore dress''. The first family are flying the flag for
America and, as far as they're concerned, immigrants will be the downfall of
their country. Unfortunately for the Jewish family, America is their downfall
as they end up living in the squalor of New York and the mother has to sell
herself to her employer to feed the family.
There is one quote from Freud that is the crux of the entire book. He really
gets the best line when he says: ``America is a mistake, a gigantic mistake!''
Doctorrow's description is incredible. Usually I skim books but with this I've
spent the last three days totally devouring it. It's the kind of book you
really want to shout about.
Another book I've been reading is a novella called Rita Hayworth and the
Shawshank Redemption from a book of short stories by Stephen King called
Different Seasons. I saw the film The Shawshank Redemption which I think was
far cleverer than the book. The book tended to focus on the theme of hope being
a dangerous thing if you remember that quote from Morgan Freeman's character
Red, who says: ``I hope for the best but expect the worst.'' I think King is an
under-rated writer to a degree - many people dismiss him as a horror writer but
he writes brilliant thrillers like Misery and Salem's Lot.

CARLISLE, November 18 - Prince Charles Edward Stuart rode in triumph today into
the first English city he has taken, mounted on a white horse and preceded by
his 100 pipers.
But the council of war which followed at his headquarters in Highmoor House was
fraught with tension, as several who were there confirm. Deep divisions emerged
between his inner circle of advisers and the Highland chiefs captaining his
regiments.
Charles insists on the need to keep up the invasion's momentum. The Scots want
to return home and consolidate there, while daring the Government in London to
send forces north and attack. They are convinced that such a move would fail,
that effective French aid would meanwhile arrive and that Scotland would again
become independent under the restored Stuarts.
Tempers rose in the room as the Jacobite commander, Lord George Murray, set out
his case. He cited also the logistical problems of going on. Ever since the
5000 Jacobites left Edinburgh three weeks ago, it has been hard to keep them
together. They march as a modern army, but the clansmen are basically
irregulars.
About 500 deserted as they crossed the Borders. There was no welcome from the
locals, who stole what equipment they could lay their hands on, including all
the tents - in future the army can only be quartered in towns. The weakness of
its artillery, with just 13 guns, is embarrassing.
Charles angrily rejected these arguments, according to the reports from inside
the council. He said delay would only benefit his enemies. The Hanoverian
regime had been woefully unprepared for his challenge, but was now working
feverishly to counter it.
A force under General George Wade was already at Newcastle, and a second one
under General Sir John Ligonier had been sent through the Midlands to intercept
the Jacobites. Their best chance lay in forestalling a junction of these
armies, which could only be done by advancing to fight them one at a time.
The prince was supported by his secretary, John Murray of Broughton, who said a
shortage of money meant that staying put was not an option; only #60 had been
raised in a levy on Carlisle. The matter was clinched when Charles asked the
French envoy accompanying him, the Marquis d'Eguilles, to reveal his
instructions from King Louis XV. They stated France would not commit herself
fully until she could gauge how much English support the Jacobites would win.
The prince said that meant going on into Lancashire, where the large Roman
Catholic population is supposed to be sympathetic. The chiefs were forced to
agree and the council took a decision to continue the invasion. The army will
resume its southward march as soon as possible.
The meeting of the council cast a pall over the Jacobites' easy capture of
Carlisle. But discord had already become evident during the short siege. Lord
George Murray declined to direct it himself, on the grounds that he knew
nothing about this aspect of warfare. The joint commander of the Jacobites, the
Duke of Perth, took charge instead. He flung himself into the task and, amid a
heavy fall of snow, dug trenches in his shirt sleeves along with his men.
The effort proved hardly necessary because, except for two casualties inflicted
by snipers, Carlisle put up next to no resistance. The local militia was called
out and assembled in the city, but most of these untrained farmers ran away as
soon as they saw what they were up against. The crumbling defences were then
manned only by 80 old soldiers who live in retirement in the castle. There was
panic among the townsfolk, who followed the militiamen in climbing over the
walls or forcing their way through the gates to escape.
A white flag was hung out over the ramparts four nights ago, less than a week
after the Jacobites arrived. A message had got through from General Wade saying
he must abandon an attempt to come to Carlisle's relief. Beaten back by snow he
was, after two days' march, no nearer than Hexham. He retired to Newcastle.
The mayor of Carlisle, Alderman Thomas Pattinson, and members of the
corporation then met Perth with an offer to surrender the town but not the
castle. He refused, and they had no choice but to give way.
The next day, November 15, they went out to Brampton, five miles to the east,
where the prince was waiting with most of his army to block Wade's expected
assault across the Pennine Hills. The mayor and magistrates appeared before him
on their knees to deliver up the keys of Carlisle. He returned them in ``a very
obliging manner'', assuring the citizens of his future protection and favour.
Lord George Murray, uninformed about all this, exploded when he learned of it.
He told the prince that Perth should never have been allowed to take the
surrender of the first English town, because his Roman Catholic religion made a
gift to Whig propaganda. Murray resigned his commission and announced he would
from now on serve as just a volunteer. Charles accepted the resignation,
unaware that the clan chieftains were siding with Murray.
Go-betweens then had to persuade the duke, now left as the Jacobites' field
commander, to cede rank to Murray for the good of the cause. Charles was thus
forced to reinstate Lord George, and indeed give him for the first time sole
overall command. But he did so with ill will.
Meanwhile, on November 16, the Corporation of Carlisle attended in state at the
market cross where King James III of England was proclaimed. He assembled again
today to greet the prince on his entry. Most townsfolk stayed at home, however,
apparently for fear of the clansmen.
The small crowd which did turn out was silent and sullen. This does not augur
well for any rising of the English Jacobites, from whose leaders Prince Charles
has yet to hear.

MOUNTAINS have long held a fascination for man. Walking and climbing among them
engenders powerful emotions, and for those whose souls are captured by the lure
of their wildness there is no escape.
The adrenalin rush the climber gets from grappling with a difficult move; a
solo walker's first sight of a remote, lonely corrie - these are addictive
drugs, but without the harm.
For many there is the added attraction of learning more about the natural
environment: the plants and birds they see forming an inextricable link with
their surroundings; dramatic glaciated glens and rock strata laid down over
millions of years.
There is a permanence about it all which puts man in his place, gives us a
sense that the mountains will still be there long after we have departed the
planet. In a human world where rapid change is a dominant feature of everyday
life, the mountain world is an anchor.
Yet there is change here, too. Perhaps not immediately perceptible, it
manifests itself over time, and the consequences for mountain flora and fauna
can be startling. Man, of course, plays a significant part, through
agricultural practices, estate management and recreation. Whether we choose to
recognise it or not, these are all forms of environmental exploitation.
A new book involving a collaboration between one of Scotland's best known
landscape photographers, Colin Baxter, and Dr Des Thompson, head of uplands and
peatlands studies for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a celebration of mountains
in words and pictures, but also brings into focus how the upland natural
heritage can be influenced by human activity.
Baxter needs little introduction as a photographer whose work has been widely
published and acclaimed, and the mountain mood is captured to striking effect
in this large, coffee table format book. Not all the images will make you gasp
in awe, but those who know mountains will recognise the subtle choice of
subject matter, the delicate interplay between light and landscape.
Thompson's writing is better known in academic circles, but here again is a man
who empathises with mountains and can write eloquently and authoritatively
about them. ``I am moved by the beauty and nature of these places, and by the
powerful union of light, land and life. I thrill at the prospect of a new top.
The return to a familiar place is eagerly awaited; the birds and plants, the
views and impressions, that peculiarly intoxicating excitement of reaching the
summit - all contribute to milestone experiences and to the continuation of
life at its best.''
The attraction of Scotland, Land of Mountains is that it is not just another
book of pretty pictures. It sets out to say something about the Scottish
landscape and the changes that have been and are being wrought upon it.
As Magnus Magnusson says in the foreword: ``. . . so many of our wild areas are
inhabited and managed. `Wilderness' is a misnomer. But we do have wild
landscapes, with the natural elements of rock, water, peat and vegetation so
predominant. It is the inhabitation and management (or lack of it) of some of
these areas which has meant that wherever one looks there seem to be conflict
and difficulty. This is a land which gives to all what it can, but receives
sorely little in return.''
Thompson's working life is spent studying and researching the upland
environment, and in a chapter entitled Man and Land Use he describes the major
factors influencing change.
Intensive grazing by sheep and the trampling and browsing effects of large
numbers of deer have stunted the natural regeneration of mountain vegetation.
Huge expanses of heather have disappeared, as has the woolly fringe moss,
characteristic of exposed summit plateaux. Erosion has resulted on steep
slopes, stripped bare of vegetation, where acid rain deposition further
contributes to the loss of globally rare mosses.
Two bird species in particular - the ptarmigan and the dotterel - have had
their breeding habitat squeezed into areas where it will be relatively
unaffected, in the Highlands. Heather, a food source for ptarmigan, has been
decimated in the southern uplands, and attempts to reintroduce the bird have
failed. As a ground nesting bird, the dotterel suffers from nest trampling by
sheep and deer.
Recreation can wreak havoc on the mountain environment. The footpath network
spreads as more people venture into the hills, and erosion can be severe in
steep or boggy areas. Five downhill ski centres in Scotland attract more people
to the tops, and ski paraphernalia such as lifts and fencing itself has a
negative impact.
Says Thompson: ``The battle for our mountains, to protect their biodiversity
and wildness, was started long ago - before the emergence of younger, better
informed generations. But it is they who must rise to the calling of the
mountains.
``It is between sheep and deer, people and their clutter, fire and rifles, and
the ghostly passage of clouds and pollutants that we have to secure a better
balance.
``Many regions of the world have sacred and mystical elements of nature
associated with their mountains. There, one finds degrees of reverence and
protection not found in Scotland. Our mountains have an aura of spirituality,
but not a corresponding degree of sanctity. The mountains deserve our best.''
Scotland, Land of Mountains, by Colin Baxter and Des Thompson, is published by
Colin Baxter Photography, Grantown-on-Spey, and costs #20.

WHEN, after a month of tiresome preliminaries, the last Scottish Parliament got
round to debating the First Article of Union (November 1706) it turned out to
be pure theatre, culminating in a noble lord throwing himself on his knees and
pleading with tear-filled eyes for the preservation of Scottish self-government.
Before the members was the proposal that: ``The two kingdoms should, after 1st
May (1707), be forever after united into one kingdom by the name of Great
Britain, and their heraldic cognizances be conjoined'' (which, to the layman at
least, sounds pretty final). Although it was said that this First Article was
only part of a package and that if the others could not be agreed the first
would fall, no-one doubted that with the First Article approved it would really
only be a matter of fine tuning thereafter. With a majority in Parliament the
Government could already taste victory.
The opening speeches summarise the entire debate - Seton of Pitmedden and Lord
Belhaven (Jock Hamilton to his buddies) put the opposing viewpoints, Pitmedden
stressing the economic disaster which awaited Scotland without the Union and
Lord Belhaven emotionally describing ``a free and independent nation delivering
up what they had fought for since the days of Nimrod''.
Although in recent years suggestions that the motivation among the Scottish
establishment in seeking union was to get in on England's vast trading network
have been largely discredited, and it seems that more selfish motives, bribery,
even military threats, were at work, William Seton of Pitmedden certainly
stressed Scotland's precarious economic position in urging the acceptance of an
incorporating union.
The main thrust of his argument was that Scotland was lagging behind other
European nations in foreign trade and, being poor, could not reap great
advantages until able to share in the trade and enjoy the protection of a
powerful neighbour .
Gazing into his crystal ball Pitmedden predicted that if Scotland continued
under the same sovereign as England but with a separate parliament, the numbers
of the nobility would increase, the commons would be oppressed, the Scots
Parliament would increasingly fall under the influence of England, competing
factions would disrupt the peace, the rich would get richer and the poor
poorer, and emigration would increase.
He continued: ``But above all, my Lord, I think I see our ancient mother
Caledonia, like Caesar, sitting in the midst of our senate, ruefully looking
about her, covering herself with her royal garment, attending the fatal blow
and breathing out her last with a `et tu quoque, mi fili?'.'' Betrayal was his
message.
The First Article was approved. The die was cast. Scotland sent 45 members to
Westminster the following spring, roughly the same number as Cornwall. There
were more English bishops alone in the House of Lords than Scots peers. Has the
Union been merely a 300-year hiccup, or is this a united kingdom for keeps? The
next decade should surely provide the answer.

The letter had reached me from Cafe du Commerce in Lauzerte in the Garonne.
``Having a day off here in a little fortified, hilltop town. Well timed too!
Yesterday it was flooding down with rain and today is dodgy as well, so I have
had a chance to get dried out and to avoid a second soaking. Tomorrow Moissac .
. . ''
The date, April 25 1995, indicated that David Irving was almost four months
into his mammoth walk, which started at his home near Stranraer, and would end
on June 20 in the Great Cathedral Square at Santiago de Compostela. By then,
walking the famous, centuries-old Pilgrim Way through France and Spain, he
would have covered some 2700 miles.
On January 4, he set out from his front door and made for the Southern Upland
Way, just north of Portpatrick. By chance, he had chosen one of the fiercest
winters for many years. The journey divided into three sections: through
Britain to Portsmouth, from Caen in northern France, through Angouleme, to the
Chemin St Jacques, the start of the Pilgrim Way. After that came a heavy mist
over the Pyrenees, when he only knew he was across the border by a sign in
Spanish, then 500 miles to Santiago de Compostela. But this time, he was no
longer an oddity, an eccentric. As he went south, the route began to fill with
fellow walkers.
Irving is well qualified for the rigorous journey. A hill walker since he was a
boy, he had been principal teacher of Biology at Stranraer Academy when he
decided to take early retirement, age 51. ``It's hard to say which came first,
the retirement or the pilgrimage,'' he said. ``But I remember a science meeting
last year. It was going well when it suddenly hit me: `This time next year I'll
not be addressing them, I'll be on the road about the middle of France' - and
it did come true.''
The hardest part of the journey was, without doubt, south through Britain, as
far as possible off the roads. He walked the Southern Upland Way, and the
Pennines, through the Peak District, and later to the Tissington Trail to
Ashbourne, Stratford-upon-Avon, the Cotswolds and the towpath of the Avon
Canal. After the River Test Way to Southampton, it was a day to Portsmouth and
his first main break, a week's rest.
That summary may not sound too difficult. The reality was, with blinding snow
on the northern hills, snowbound minor roads, and once a snowplough operator
who told him the way ahead was closed. But, used to the Galloway Hills, Irving
took out his compass and struggled over the tops. For every pilgrim, as he
found later, the day's most urgent target was to make sure he had somewhere to
stay. He admits to almost a sense of panic when, with dark closing in, he
reached a village and could not find a B&amp;B or a pub. Later, in France and
Spain, with the better weather, like most pilgrims he found it easier to start
very early - 5 or 6am - and stop at a likely village around mid-afternoon.
In France, it was often a campsite: ``Most days, `warm' is changing to `hot'
and shorts are the gear. But, when camping, one must remember on a clear, hot
day, at this time of year, the temperature plummets at night, with the dreaded
early morning frost. I guard against this by wearing every garment I have and
stuff myself with lots of Paris Match or Sud Ouest!'' There were also Gites
d'Etapes (hostels) costing a fiver or so and, by this time, he could use the
special Refuges - Refugios in Spain.
Their standard varied enormously. ``In Spain, the refugios were a bit like the
Old Windmill Theatre. They never closed!'' He remembers one in a Spanish
village dominated by a huge monastery. ``Eighty bunks in tiers, but 120 people!
With the bunks full, there was a huge pile of blankets!'' Usually there was a
kitchen, sometimes without cooking pots. In contrast, the best, at Rabanal near
Santiago, was run by the British Confederation of St James. Staffed by
volunteers, it even provided an ample breakfast.
To qualify for free use of the refugios, walkers need a pilgrim's certificate
handed out on the French side after close questioning by a formidable lady,
Madame Debril. In France, too, they were limited to people arriving on foot,
horseback, or bicycle - the last unpopular with walkers, as they could reach
the refugios so much easier and take the best beds.
Once Irving had reached the Pilgrim Route in France, he had begun to meet
people . . . ``It became a celebration,'' and by Spain he was already a
celebrity . . . ``Walked from Scotland?'' was the astonished greeting. People
met and parted and met again, but many, ticking along around the same speed,
tended to form bands and walk together. He saw a lot of a Dutch couple but lost
touch with them going over the Pyrenees. He neither saw nor heard of anyone
from Scotland until he found a letter of greeting at a pilgrims' drinking
fountain off the Chemin de St Jacques. In French, it was from a Scots couple,
signed Arthur and Margaret. He met a Welsh pilgrim in Le Pui, an Anglican
priest in Spain. But most came from France and Spain. ``There's a great
camaraderie on the road,'' he said, ``Some of us will keep in touch.''
Irving also found fame in Spain as ``the man with the lightest rucksack''. His
worst moment came just before the Spanish border, when the waistband of his
rucksack broke, hurting his back. Watching him hobble, one traveller asked if
he were making the pilgrimage as a penitence! ``That was funny later. But I
feared then I would have to give up.'' Irving said instead, the back improved,
and he was ruthless with his rucksack, pruning it to two pairs of shorts and
underpants, one pair of jeans, two pairs of socks, two pairs of walking socks,
and always, his journal. ``I wrote it every night, usually in a cafe, and
missed only a very few times . . . when my back was bad, or I was terribly
tired . . . or I had had too good a night!'' He sent back each volume as he
finished it, now eight in all.
Prudent with his money, he allowed himself only #20 a day. Meanwhile, at home,
his wife Isy (Isobel) was organising the sponsorship plan that has now raised
more than #6000 for the Multiple Sclerosis Society - an appropriate charity for
Wigtownshire where MS is prevalent. ``Four of my friends have it,'' he said. He
phoned home most nights, and Isy was able to organise cash replenishment and
other practical details, made difficult by fluctuating currency.
The last night, with dozens of others, he spent at a fine building, Monte Gozo,
built for the Pope's visit in 1989. This refugio had cafes and a bar. The next
morning, scrubbed and groomed, after discarding his ragged shorts for the
well-cherished jeans, he teamed up again with Jason from America, another
well-known pilgrim, with an injury that had left him walking in one shoe and
one boot. The pair set off early for the Great Square at the heart of Santiago
for the journey's finest moment. ``It was amazing. We were almost open-mouthed
gazing at the great Cathedral.''
In the Pilgrims' Office, where they filled in forms and declared themselves
either ``spiritual'' or ``cultural'' pilgrims, the face of the priest in charge
fell when he heard Irving select the ``cultural'' role. It was the first time
he had seen a Scottish pilgrim and had hoped for a spiritual journey. The
special pilgrim's mass followed in the Cathedral, underneath the largest censer
in the world. It swung to and fro dispensing incense as the service ended and,
church or not, spontaneous applause broke out.
As a passionate traveller, the sense of achievement at the end of this great
pilgrimage was tremendous for David Irving. But did he gain anything spiritual
from it? ``I think the journey did not so much change people as etch in their
previously held beliefs,'' he said, ``but it did strengthen my views of the
goodness of human nature. So many people have turned themselves upside down to
help me that I'd now say 90% of the world are kind people.

CACTI, fish, cooking, and oil paint do not automatically go together, but
Donald Urquhart, winner of the Scottish Arts Council 1995-6 Amsterdam bursary,
is no ordinary artist. ``I once worked out that housing my 150 cacti - which I
have never painted - takes up a quarter of my studio, and so costs me #500 a
year. Crazy!''
Then there's his fish. The day I was due to go for coffee his new aquarium
burst and 40 gallons of water gushed out. ``There were fish flapping and
gasping all over the floor. What a trauma. I'm sure they'll need counselling!
``Paul Nesbitt, exhibitions director of Inverleith House, was there too. He's
very good at telling you their Latin names - but that was not perhaps the right
moment!''
Luckily Urquhart has a sense of humour as well as a good eye. ``Cacti remind me
of artists. They too need strong defence mechanisms and have to survive in
hostile environments, thriving on next to nothing!'' His interest in cacti
started with one seed he collected off a plant in the Arizona desert on a visit
there in 1988. ``It germinated and started to grow. So I bought it a friend -
then another. I knew nothing about them so I got a couple of books. Pals gave
me their cacti and I found a mail-order firm in Norfolk. The next thing I knew
I had 125 species.
Urquhart says despite living in Glasgow he's a rural boy. He was born in
Perthshire and his current work and last five exhibitions address the theme of
its landscape, its trees, and pollution. Drumbuich Wood is a favourite,
inspirational place in his native Perthshire which he first explored as a child
in the company of his forester grandfather. The woodland is hidden away between
the River Almond as it flows to the Tay and the main A85 to Crieff, not far
from the village of Bankfoot where Urquhart was born in 1959.
A lovely linear etching of a dock plant dated 1925 hangs on his wall. ``It was
in the room in my grandmother's house where I was born - so it's officially the
first piece of visual art I ever saw!''
His last two solo shows, Sylva at Edinburgh's Botanic Gardens and Ptarmigan at
the Dick Institute, Kilmarnock, both take their starting point from Drumbuich
Wood and his interest in natural history. Scots Pine, birch and spruce feature
upside down in photographs which are manipulated in the developer with a brush
and overpainted with pale, ghostly gouache afterwards. Why upside down?
``I was walking through the woods one calm, bright winter's day after heavy
rain and was astonished to see a wonderful sunlit reflection in a forest pool.
It took me more than a year to capture 40 upside-down trees in pools in black
and white. The veils of paint isolate each tree and add an emotive quality. I
call the series The Lost Trees of Drumbuich, a title which refers not just to
the transience of the watery reflection but also to acid rain and a loss of
innocence,'' he explains.
``As a child, nature is magical. There is a wonder about everything. As an
adult I feel a pessimism in the realisation that the landscape is polluted;
trees are bathed in acid rain and radioactivity is on the increase.''
His most recent work, for Kilmarnock, emphasises the dangers to the environment
via the ptarmigan, Britain's most northerly bird which for Urquhart represents
all that is ``wild, beautiful, fragile - and threatened''. Ptarmigans carry
residual traces of radioactivity from Chernobyl, and are retreating higher up
the Scottish mountains as global warming alters our climate. ``The birds now
live above the 1500ft line. It's concrete evidence of pollution; so I use the
ptarmigan as a metaphor for environmental destruction.''
Perthshire flora and fauna also appeared in more straightforward paintings
(seen at Glasgow's Intermedia Galley in 1994) where one of his fine linear
drawings of flowering plants was bought by George Wylie for his wife Daphne.
BBC presenter Alex Bell also owns Urquhart's work including 10 of a series of
20 panels. Bell's sister bought the other half!
Since graduating from Edinburgh College of Art in 1982, itchy feet have also
taken him to America, Paris, Brussels, Madrid, and Barcelona in 1982 courtesy
of the Royal Academy's Richard Ford Award (he was the first Scot to win it); to
Amiens in France as part of Glasgow's 1990 cultural exchange programme; to
Slovenia and Croatia in 1992; now to the Netherlands for a year, after which he
goes to Slovenia to exhibit.
In May 1996 he shows in Boston and Harvard simultaneously. The exhibitions then
tour to New York and Los Angeles in 1996-97 - not forgetting a new show at
Edinburgh's Collective Gallery and Stornoway's An Lanntair in 1997-98.
Funding all this for eight years has been his work as a chef. ``My mother and
grandmother are both amazing cooks. I've always been interested.''
His current cool style, characterised by a ``dreich minimalism'' (his words)
plus monochromatic cream, ochre and grey/brown palette, is actually fairly new.
In the 1980s he was fiercely expressionistic, painting huge heroic canvases of
rearing stallions, battles and crucifixions in gory, shadowing red and black
chiaroscuro.
So why the change? ``I went to India in 1989 and found it impossible to take on
the vivid colours of the Jaipur spice markets or India's complex mythology in
three months. On my return I had my first solo show at Main Fine Art and it
seemed inappropriate to use bright colours in a dreich Scottish climate so I
painted Indian carvings of the Nandi gods in sombre tones. I had time to ask
myself, `What do I really want to paint? Why am I dissatisfied with figurative
work?' I decided I needed to put more intellectual thought into my pictures
rather than rely on spectacle. I filled five notebooks with ideas and writing.
That's when the new work began.''
I left Urquhart amid his spiky green cereus and mammilaria, his grey sedum and
woolly cerhalocereus senilis (from the high Andes) listening to his favourite
jazz. Urquhart has a nice line in irony, demonstrated by his parting shot to me
as I rushed onwards. ``You need something to calm you down,'' he said. ``You
should get a fish tank.''

FROM the depth of a stretched Mercedes, the Lebanese woman emerged, clad from
head to the toes of her very high-heeled shoes in the latest designer Chanel,
and like some haughty, brightly-plumed bird, stalked fastidiously round the
potholes and heaps of rubble before disappearing into a jeweller's shop.
No problem, no despair, no veils either - because we are in Beirut, the city
that's trying to beat all building records to rise, literally, from the dust
and ashes, and so reclaim its former status as the playground of the Eastern
Mediterranean.
And I'm here to evaluate Lebanon's current tourist potential. There are now
three airlines flying regularly from the UK, and Jim Smith, the Glaswegian
owner of Jasmin Tours, has already put the Lebanese capital back in his
brochure to complete his Middle East portfolio.
At first glance, Beirut is hardly the stuff that holiday dreams are made of as
you notch up the shell holes and identify the Holiday Inn, the once famous
Phoenecia Hotel, the hole that was the American Embassy - just some of the
gutted remnants of a vicious civil war that raged for nearly 20 years, killing
150,000 of its citizens. And what the bombs couldn't destroy, the cranes seem
to be finishing off now.
But a closer scrutiny reveals the more human and hopeful face of Beirut; even
in the most blighted areas surrounded by an acreage of rubble, an old man
busily sweeps his shop front, another, seemingly the only occupier of a
derelict building has planted geraniums in old oil-drums, put out dusty chairs
and reopened his cafe.
At the Yacht Club in the shadow of the shelled out hotels, Lebanese girls are
sunbathing in brief bikinis, and in the reopening restaurants along the once
famous Corniche, tables are groaning with 30 and 40 dish Mezzes, all served
with wine, beer, or champagne - there are no Muslim restrictions about alcohol
here!
Even in the dreadfully damaged and aptly named central Martyr's Square, with
the martyr herself pitted with bullet holes, vendors are hustling postcards of
``then'' and ``now'' and ``ancient coins'' from excavations that have revealed
layers of civilisation dating back to the Phoenician era.
Pride of place in the square belongs to a huge tableau and model of the plans
already under way to restore those buildings that can be restored, reconstruct
new parks, promenades, plazas and souks - at #333m, the largest building
project of the 1990s, undertaken by a government-backed, privately financed
development company.
One corner of the square has already sprouted a new Maronite Church, while the
National Museum, situated on the Green Line that divided the city for so many
years, is reopening early next year.
Little wonder that flights from the UK, from Germany, even more from France -
though not yet from the US (which still forbids entry to its citizens) - are
disgorging businessmen, bankers, and constructors eager to sniff out their
share of this once dynamic, and now re-emerging little state.
We arrived in a comfortable four-and-a-half hours with the new British
Mediterranean airline with five flights a week from Heathrow, slightly nervous
at the huge portraits of Syrian President Assad adorning the airport (his
posters outnumber the Ayatollah's by about 20-1 in most of the Lebanon), and
the number of machine gun-toting young soldiers - though the formalities were
somewhat faster than at Heathrow, and, as we are to discover later, at the
checkpoints manned by police, Syrian or Lebanese militia at every crossroad, we
are always waved through.
A great deal more terrifying is the white-knuckle style driving, with every
Beiruti still seemingly determined to dice with death as he emerges from some
of the worst traffic jams I've ever experienced.
In a country as small as Wales, with 17 religious factions, politics and
religion are not issues to be taken lightly, nor is it easy for tourists to
understand the hatreds, the sheer collective insanity of a population which can
cause such mass destruction. Yet a few years later they can welcome visitors in
such a relaxed and urbane fashion.
``Until I was 18,'' says Jocelyn, our young and pretty guide, ``I knew nothing
but war. Yes, we knew that some of us would get killed, lose friends, family,
homes, and livelihood. That was normality. Yet five minutes after the bombs
went off nearby, we'd be off down to the beach.
``Of course there are still tensions, many of them psychological,'' admits
Barid, another of our young escorts, who has returned after five years living
in Canada (two-thirds of all Lebanese live abroad), to work in his country's
fledgling tourist industry.
In Beirut itself, this industry is busy getting its act together. All the big
hotel groups are going back, and about a dozen hotels are operating more or
less normally - ours, the Beau Rivage, hs unfinished wall fittings, an
unpainted dining-room, and the fountain in the lobby is still in its plastic
cover. But at breakfast on the day we leave, even at 4.30am, they can produce a
miraculous spread of eggs, dips, vegetables, tea and coffee.
Realistically, Beirut is as yet worth a day's sightseeing at most, to stroll
along the Corniche where old men are playing backgammon, and the young flaunt
their Armani - most designers' stores never left this lucrative,
fashion-conscious outlet.
Much of the rest of the action is centred round the dusty Hamra district, with
its cramped shops and cinemas, the Mayflower Hotel already building its legend
as the place where the kidnapped hostages enjoyed their last drinks.
Most of the nightlife is based in one long beachfront sprawl in the
neighbouring resort of Jounieh, from discos to belly dancers, where a night out
can cost $100, geared for wealthy Gulf Arabs, for whom Beirut was always the
Paris of the East.
But when the Casino reopens, the locals say that ``we'll really know that
Beirut is really back in business''.
For now though, the highlights of the Lebanon are well outside the city; we hug
the rapidly developing coast, glimpsing golden beaches and picnicking families
in between the skyscrapers and frenetic traffic, and arrive in the oasis which
is Byblos, to browse among even more ancient rubble.
Byblos is the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in the world, and from
its chunky Crusader ramparts the strata of about 7000 years of civilisation can
be clearly identified; the simple dwellings of neolithic man, obelisks from
Egypt, the tombs of early Phoenician royals, a tiny exquisite Roman theatre, a
Romanesque church, each building recycling centuries-old archeological
detritus, so that Roman columns are embedded in Arab walls, Hellenistic remains
packed with prehistoric stones. Byblos claims the first Roman example of the
alphabet on the thirteenth-century BC tomb of King Ahiran (now in the National
Museum).
The town also gave its name to the Bible (the word means ``book''), trading
cedar wood for the Pharaohs' tombs for papyrus from Egypt for its book-making
industry.
The once bustling harbour now dozes virtually undisturbed, bougainvillea and
jasmin ramble over white walls, fishing-nets dry in the sun, a few tourist
boats putter off down the coast. From the souks behind drift those Middle
Eastern smells of spices, bitter coffee, and cardamon. Meanwhile, on the roof
terrace of the Abi Chemou restaurant we linger over tabouleh (wheat salad),
hummus, shawarma (meat balls), baba ghanouj (mashed aubergine), and fresh fish,
and we gaze out across a filigree of Roman porticoes, minarets, and walls.
Byblos is enchanting. On Sundays, most of Lebanon is en fete, and we join much
of Beirut streaming out of the capital to picnic in the mountains. We're
heading for Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley, a Hizbollah stronghold, where until
recently tourists have been advised not to travel independently. As a reminder,
our driver points out the mountain village of Nabi Shit, where Terry Waite was
believed to have been held, but told us we'd need a special permit to visit it.
The valley rolls away peacefully enough, a succession of orchards and wheat
fields, though there are none of the famous cedars of Lebanon - they're further
north of here, and only about 400 of them left.
Nothing prepares you for the shock of Baalbek; the bus rounds the bend of a
typical dusty Arab village, and suddenly out of the bare, bleached hills, six
great golden columns thrust into the sky, and another great temple alongside
appears so complete, so perfect that it could be a film set, the whole site as
daunting and majestic to the twentieth-century traveller as this City of the
Sun, or Heliopolis as it was called, must have been to the subjects of its
dominions 2000 years ago.
Using an already ancient site, the Romans built the great complex to worship
three of their Gods, Jupiter, the Roman name for Baal, Bacchus, and Venus, but
though it took nearly 250 years to build, both its religious and political
message failed.
By 220.AD the Roman Empire was in decline, and Christianity had usurped the old
cults. Baalbek is one of history's most sublime examples of folie de grandeur.
For much of its next 2000 years Baalbek was half buried in the sand, as
graffiti, some as late as 1882, halfway up the columns reveal.
Inevitably statistics dominate. The six columns that remain out of the original
54 from the Temple of Jupiter are 67 feet in height, seven feet in diameter.
The smaller temple to Bacchus alongside is actually larger than the Parthenon.
Although the Romans were not usually subtle builders, there's an almost Semitic
sensuousness in the poppies, grapes and eggs, floral motifs often hanging
lopsidedly from walls and columns, which soften the stern Roman culture.
Virgins, wives, daughters, and prostitutes were offered to strangers in these
temples in this last bastion of the pagan faith, but the Christian Theodosius
smashed their idols and practices, Muslims later hacking out any faces of the
gods that remained, with earthquakes adding their toll.
But the great bulk of Baalbek is still there, almost too awe-inspiring to
tackle, but we're behind 38 coachloads of Sri Lankan housemaids (they earn
about $100 a month) and their boyfriends on a day out run by their priest, and
they have no such inhibitions.
They laugh, chatter, approach the altar and drape themselves round the pillars
like exotic butterflies, bringing the temple to life more than the most erudite
guidebooks.
At the gates of the site where the vendors cluster, the tour buses are parked
under Hizbollah signs in English and Arabic that read ``Islam is the solution
to all problems'', and ``Hizbollah, party of justice, truth and
egalitarianism'', and more sinisterly, in Arabic alone, another showing a large
machine-gun, though whatever the message, there is no hostility towards
visitors; everyone seems determined to enjoy their Sunday.
In the dusty square we consume delicious Baalbek lamb and onion pies, the Sri
Lankans have photos taken on three camels, while a group of Lebanese youths
pose in Arab headdress, and then preen themselves gazing long at their
reflections in the car windows. A young bootblack wanders disconsolately among
trainer-clad feet, a joyful Lebanese wedding party streams across the square as
the old fortune-teller in black at last finds a customer. Nothing could be more
peaceful.
We can't visit the old palace of Beiteddine as planned on our way back from
Baalbek because the Prime Minister is there, apparently having a
kiss-and-make-up session with the Druse leader and the site, and roads are
closed. So we divert to Aanjar instead, an ancient walled city built in the
eighth century by an Ummayad caliph Khalid el Walid, whose powerful influence
once spread from Spain to India.
By comparison with the massive grandeur of Baalbek, the ruined palaces, walls
and slender arches where an eastern court wined and danced, are refined,
delicate, and haunting.
A Lebanese family on an outing are just packing up after their Sunday picnic
under the cypress trees at the entrance, and as usual, the children rush to
greet us and practise their English. With one small boy I gravely discuss Garee
Linayka, his brother clutching a large expensive electronic keyboard; we
finally persuade him to give us a tune, expecting the latest chart-topper.
Instead, we get the strident Arab cadences of an old folk-tune, and as if by
magic, we form a circle, clapping spellbound as our Jocelyn and then the boy's
raven-haired sister, both in their tight western jeans, step into the circle,
and perform their own spontaneous belly dances, eyes flashing, hands
fluttering.
You feel the great Caliph would certainly have approved.

THE most intimate world of Rosamunde Piclher is that of her imagination, from
which she has conjured such best-sellers as The Shell Seekers and now her
latest book, Coming Home. But her world also includes the temporal places where
she was brought up, has lived, and has worked. These permeate her books as the
atmospheric backgrounds to her tales of human emotion.
Reflecting the enormous international interest in her and everything connected
with her, an illustrated volume called The World of Rosamunde Pilcher has just
been published by Hodder and Stoughton. It had its genesis in Germany, where
Pilcher's most British of books enjoy a great vogue. Its sumptuous photography
could be appreciated even without reference to the text, which consists of
biographical snippets and apposite quotes from her work.
In the opening chapter, My Second Home, Pilcher demonstrates the quality of her
writing as she describes her first inauspicious contact with the little
Sutherland town of Dornoch and how later it came to entrance her enough to buy
a flat (above a bank) there.
One spring morning she felt she had returned to the past and sets the scene:
``It was cold, but the first daffodils were beginning to push up through the
rough grass; there was the smell of flowering currant and newly turned earth,
and somebody somewhere had lighted a bonfire.'' The prose is evocative,
familiar.
Sepia photographs illustrate Pilcher's early days: her childhood in Cornwall
(her father was a Royal Navy officer stationed in the Far East); her brief and
boring war-work with the Foreign Office in Woburn Abbey before she joined the
Wrens; her post-war marriage to Graham Pilcher.
The colour pictures of Cornwall are delectable. There is a thatched cottage
with window frames and arched door of cerulean blue (``It was a secret house
and, as well, a house that seemed to slumber in the past,'' goes the matching
text from The Shell Seekers). Pink florabunda roses spill across the foreground
of another picture which shows an old, high-eaved, country house with strapped
walls and tall brick chimneys and a lily pond. And away from the glowing
colours and intimacy of old gardens, the author laughs under a red umbrella on
Cornish rocks, patently at home with the sea.
A painting, it will be recalled, was central to the plot of The Shell Seekers.
A selection of canvases of the period includes one by Laura Knight of a
pigtailed girl staring at rocks and a swirling purple-blue sea. A modern,
abstract study of St Ives is accompanied by another excerpt from the same book,
enthusing about young men with bright visions who will come ``not to paint the
bay and the sea and the boats and the moors, but the warmth of the sun and the
colour of the wind''.
And still on painting, and still from The Shell Seekers, the central character
of the book muses on the thousand different blues of the sea: ``Over sand,
shallow and translucent, it was jade-green, streaked with aquamarine. Over
rocks and seaweed, it darkened to indigo. Far out where a small fishing boat
bucketed its way across the waves, it became a deep Prussian blue......'' The
words are mirrored by a photograph of foaming breakers with Godrevy Lighthouse
on its island beyond.
The bustle of lived-in, homely Cornwall is caught in a double study that shows
swans sailing in the orange and white water-shadows of fishing boats in Looe
Harbour.
London is another favoured setting for Pilcher's books and it yields some
atmospheric pictures - most notably a beautiful garden in the heart of Chelsea,
with a brick wall overhung with pink roses and the remains of afternoon tea on
a blue-checked table-cloth. Pilcher's writing celebrates domestic and civilised
enjoyments - and this intimate view seems to encapsulate the pleasures of house
and garden.
And thence to Scotland. The family scrap-album yields pictures of Graham and
Rosmary Pilcher with their four, now grown-up children; the welcoming house
they built in 1955 and still live in near Dundee; the revelation that the
best-selling author still works with a manual typewriter; and the reflection
from the couple of almost 50 years that ``marriage is like a job. A long
difficult job and both partners have to work harder than ever before''.
The Highland pictures are gorgeously atmospheric with brooding lochs and hills
and sparkling waters. But they are perhaps too familiar in nature to delight as
much as the southern ones. Less predictable is the view of the mini-village of
Crovie on the Moray Firth, its little houses all at characteristic right angles
to the sea. It matches a quote from The Blue Bedroom.
A bird's-eye view of the Royal Caledonian Ball is linked to this conversational
exchange from September about the Reel of the 51st Highland Division:
``Never heard of it.''
``It was devised in a German prison camp during the war.''
``It loooks extremely complicated.''
``Well, why not? They had five-and-a-half years to make the bloody thing up.''
Pilcher's humour - not too common a trait among her best-selling confrres -
had not really been hinted at until this point but it lurks again in the
picture of a black and white spaniel, paws on nose under heraldic emblems. The
caption says: ``Gun dog conserving its energy outside the shooting season in
Scotland.''
It would be nice to think that Pilcher had written that one herself.
n.The World of Rosamunde Pilcher, edited by Siv Bublitz with picture research
by Lieva Reunes, is published by Hodder and Stoughton at #20.

Anvar Khan and photographer Phil Rider spend a night on the road with the
Scottish Ambulance Service and discover that medical traumas are not the only
obstacles the crews have to overcome in an unjust and selfish society
IT'S Friday night, and all is quiet in Temazapam city. Glasgow, after two major
football matches, isn't fully celebrating the weekend. No-one has the energy or
the finance to drink enough to get into a fight. But private trouble is
everywhere. The night before, Peter Robinson, 34, a paramedic with the Scottish
Ambulance Service, had been called to a hanging.
He said his last shift had been a bad one because he had received ``genuine
calls''. Thanks to BT and its call-chasing facility, the number of hoax calls
to the emergency 999 number have dwindled. During the course of an eight-hour
shift, however, the ambulance service are asked to help various people in
varying degrees of danger.
``You wouldn't believe what people call an ambulance for,'' is a staff mantra.
Take the man who's had backache all week, for instance, and then decides on a
Saturday, at 2am, that he needs to go to hospital. And then there's the
consistent demand for service from Govan, where life is cheaper than a
phone-call. But more on that later.
The staff mess room at SAS HQ in Maitland Street has a TV, record player and
kitchen facilities. There's a cupboard full of cans and Mars bars - ``the
shop''. Framed photos of labrador puppies, potential dogs for the blind, sit
cutely on the wall. Here, paramedics and ambulance technicians await calls from
control.
Tonight, the control office is manned by three women. They receive up to 300
calls every 24 hours. It is their responsibility to gain the correct
information to pass on to the paramedic team. This is a challenge. People in a
panic tend to lose what they're sure they know, like their address. ``You can
hear assualts actually taking place,'' says Control Superintendent Denise
MacDonald, 43. ``It's very distressing.''
The public want ambulances because they're safe, but working one isn't. It
turns out that a crew was assaulted on the early shift, by a woman feigning
illness. Both men spent some time holding a somewhat personal item, between
their legs, in pain.
An ambulance is manned by two staff, a technician and a paramedic. Technicians
are on #16,000, paramedics on #17,000. I don't know what else ambulance service
men and women take home, but it can't always be job satisfaction. There is no
such thing as a mere ambulance driver. There's no room for anyone who isn't
trained to act in an emergency.
The paramedic can administer drugs because he must manipulate the status quo.
If a victim has a life-threatening injury, he must stablise them so they arrive
at hospital with a chance of survival.
Richard Kerr, 27, is a trainee technician. Two members of his family are
already in the ambulance service. He enjoys his job. Robinson and Kerr admit to
developing a morbid sense of humour, which even I get a taste of while hanging
around in front of the TV. You compare local knowledge with the time on your
watch and think, ``Someone must have been stabbed by now''.
The SAS is one of the few jobs, like soldiering, where violence ensures the
demand for your service.
A crew is called out to Govan, this happens a lot. Control reports that a
40-something woman in a ``slightly intoxicated'' state has fallen down tenement
stairs and possibly slashed a finger. A neighbour, in another act of melodrama,
has decided to forgo the search for a Band-aid or a cup of sobering tea, and
called for the paramedics. But no-one gets slightly intoxicated in Govan. ``It
doesn't matter how many times you ask them how much they've drunk,'' says
Robinson, as collegues respond to the call by slapping on gloves and a hard hat
(well, she could be a big wummin), ``It's always the standard response - two
pints''. The ambulance team can only hope to give her a plaster and a shunty up
to bed.
Robinson has long hours and a family, and hints at marginalisation when he
says, ``I just fit in with them''. Kerr has a dog called Gizmo, which he
insists on dragging out for walki
Robinson has to give overdose victims a drug called Narcan, which brings them
round ``to lucidity''. They awake sober and get abusive and upset. Why?
Robinson shrugs. ``It's #20 wasted, their trip is ruined.''
Euthanasia is illegal, but it is quite within someone's rights to smoke as much
as they want, or drink as much as they want until they get ill and die. A
victim of any emergency has the choice as to whether he's saved. A paramedic
will stabilise him, then get his signature on a form which entitles the
ambulance to leave, but the victim is allowed to change his mind. Do they ever
feel like just stomping off, when they're in the firing line? The boys nod.
``Frequently.''
What's the worst experience you've ever had? Robinson goes quiet as he offers:
``Cot-deaths are hard. You become a jack-of-all-trades, from trying to
resucitate someone to bereavement counselling.''
In Glasgow, there are 20-30 paramedics and only one is female. All must be
dedicated and professional, all must be responsible. For those who make it to
the grade of qualified ambulance technician, and want to go on to become a
paramedic, they are assessed each quarter. They either pass or fail exams,
there is no percentage mark. Training is interspersed with weeks in hospitals,
in cardiac, accident and emergency wards, and operating theatres. You only get
to be a paramedic when you're good and ready.
At 5.40pm, the crew check their ambulance and its supplies. All vans are kitted
out the same. Apart from drugs, equipment and trolley beds, each has a bottle
of Lucozade for boosting sugar levels. Never mind thieving junkies, with that,
passing athletes might be tempted too.
At 6.20pm we're called out on a non-emergency, our job, to take an old man in a
wheelchair to the Southern General. I follow the two men into a cluster of
sheltered housing in, you guessed it, sweet Govan.
I would call the old man's home a shed with a roof on. From the outside it
looks like a nice, wee council flat. Inside, he's growing orchids, it's
tropically hot. There's a trapeze above his bed, no carpets, no comforts, no
paint or wallpaper on the cardboard walls. He's wearing old black shoes of an
unrecognisable style. He has a sofa you might find on the pavement at a rip-off
merchant's on the South Side, and a record player circa 1970 at thigh-level.
There are gadgets to accommodate his disability, but they are covered in thick
dust. Endless wires are plugged into the sockets. The old man lives in mute
poverty. It's like walking into a brightly-lit collapsable sauna, turned into a
hideout from where he can devise some way of speaking.
As it happens, at the moment, the bent and buckled pensioner with a urinary
tract infection can only communicate through a heartbreakingly basic toy, a
battery-operated Speak and Spell which he clutches like a lifeline. With more
than an average appreciation of the value of communication, he tries to make
conversation in the back of the ambulance.
He tells Kerr he's always lived in Govan. A robotic voice annunciates each
letter the way the BT directory annunciates each number.
Blood and gore is the Hollywood film director's interpretation of horror, but
there are many versions of hell, as individual as the humans who comport each
idea. You don't need riots to be appalled in this job, you just need to see the
conditions in which some people are living. But the paramedics aren't in the
business of improving life, they prolong it. And in this society, that's the
measure of caring.
Talking about caring, the second stop is in the West End of Glasgow. It's
7.30pm, and a nursing home wants the ambulance to take an 80-year old woman
with a fractured femur to the Western. The nursing home don't want the press
inside. I hear the old lady going on about how someone trampled on her leg. A
member of staff tells her to ``stop her haverin' '', and joins us in the back
to accompany her to hospital.
The carer, carrying a can of Diet Coke and chewing gum, doesn't know much about
the old lady and can't answer Kerr's questions about her age or needs. ``My
lips are sticking together,'' the old dame cries, while strapped to the
stretcher. ``Lick yer lips,'' instructs the nurse. ``Put your tongue out and
rub it on your lips.''
The old woman does an impression of an iguana in the desert. ``I can't.''
Later, we pile in the back and wait, stationed at the tradesman's entrance, for
another call. We chat about nursing homes, and their reputations. ``We've been
in some crackers,'' Robinson sighs. In a statement, which to me infers
residential neglect on a wide-scale, he adds: ``You'd be amazed how many old
people we pick up who've fallen.''
At 8.55pm we get a call saying someone's been knocked over by a car in West
Princes Street. Probably a drunk. Amid flashing blue lights and sirens, we fire
through traffic, and at 9pm, another call comes over the radio. The onlooker
has cancelled the request. The street is checked anyway for stray bodies. At
9.03pm, we receive another call, an angina-attack in Knightswood. Such an
attack can be the precursor of a heart attack. The sirens go on again.
I think going to save a life is pretty straightforward, but you'd be amazed as
to how many otherwise sanguine members of the public feel obliged to prolong
the journey. If it was their relative they would be chewing the carpet, for
without conscientious drivers, the disciplined and speedy response of the
ambulance team is worth nothing.
A flash git in black BMW thinks that it's beneath him to pull over and pulls
out instead, thus impeding the ambulance's progress. A couple of dozy women
about to cross a dual carriageway, stop to look at the ambulance blaring
towards them. One stays on the pavement, the other runs out. She makes it but
Robinson has to slam on the brakes. I swear at her.
The 70-year-old lady at home in Knightswood had felt pain for an hour and a
half but didn't want to bother anyone. Her husband, already in hospital,
doesn't have long. Robinson tries to coagulate her, Kerr to calm her, but when
old people get frightened their main arteries contract, and the needle won't
take.
She's not in immediate danger, but the more tense she becomes the more pain she
receives. Her relatives escort the ambulance to the Royal.
Robinson takes the siren off so he doesn't alarm her any further. ``Now you'll
see how many people look in their rear-view mirror,'' he promises. Only the
blue lights are flashing, but I guess some road-abusers think that means the
driver's in a party mood.
We spend a good five minutes behind a line of traffic who do not move over
because they haven't noticed us. They look up, guiltily, when we finally
overtake, but guilt isn't enough. Again and again, cars dawdle. Kerr tells
Robinson to step on it because she's getting worse. I'm inwardly cursing every
apology on four wheels. Let's face it, the dying always have right of way.

HELP! In a showbiz industry which thrives upon hyperbole, it is the greatest
hype of all. It might also turn out to be the saddest. Someone has fooled the
media - who in turn have fooled the public - into believing that The Beatles
are. The truth is that The Beatles were.
And that is why we love them so. They were the greatest pop group ever. No-one
did, no-one does, and no-one ever will surpass them. Forget Elvis. They alone
forged the template for a kind of music which affected a generation . . . and a
generation after that. For a handful of years they made our youthful lives
worthwhile and altered our image for evermore.
It is difficult to contemplate what life would be like today if The Beatles had
never existed. It would be a colourless world, one bereft of what we now call
pop culture. Without their contribution, the swinging sixties - their music,
their art, and their fabulous chaos - would never have happened.
But you must always talk about The Beatles in the past tense. When Mark Chapman
murdered John Lennon outside the Dakota Building in 1980, he took the very
breath away from the group, consigning it to history with a shot from a gun.
The Beatles couldn't be any more. The possibility of re-forming had gone
forever. So let it be.
Other groups were different. They could continue to continue even when death,
an all too common currency in rock music, intervened. The Stones survived when
Brian Jones died. The Who carried on without Keith Moon. The nature of these
bands made it possible simply to replace an individual member. But not so with
The Beatles. They were too intimately connected, each of them too crucial to
the creativity (or, rather, re-creativity) of the whole. And maybe, in a warped
kind of way, it was just as well.
Imagine a world where the once fab four were all still around and sometime,
let's say for the sake of argument the late eighties, they patched up their
differences and decided to re-form. What resulted might have been good; it
might have been very good. Then again, it might have been bad or, worse still,
it might have been simply average. The only certainty is that, whatever form it
took, it would never have held a candle to the work which The Beatles released
between 1963 and 1969. You cannot, after all, improve upon the perfect.
``Liverpool Lads Enlist Rap Star To Help Flagging Career!'' Mercifully not. So
the fact that the greatest pop group in history cannot now come together is a
blessing, surely. Fate has ensured that they can't ruin it for all of us. What
we have is what they left behind. A legacy of beautiful music. Wondrous
memories.
And then some well-intentioned someone comes along
Not until the end of the eighties, when Apple finally settled their business
differences with EMI, did it finally emerge as a serious proposition. For the
past three years, Apple's television production offshoot has painstakingly
searched the world's archives for the rarest and most precious footage of the
group in concert, in the studio, and in conversation. McCartney, Harrison, and
Starr also provided a wealth of personal material - in addition to some frank
and lengthy interviews.
Of the three musicians, it seems it was Harrison who was most anxious to ensure
that the project went ahead. His reasons may have been primarily altruistic but
there was certainly a strong financial element involved. To put it bluntly, he
was the one who most needed the money. The demise of his movie business,
Handmade Films, seriously affected his once-sizable fortune. He should have
little to worry about in the future. The documentary, for which the American TV
rights alone cost the giant ABC network a reputed $20m, should earn Paul,
George, Ringo, and Yoko Ono (the latter on behalf of Lennon's estate) as much
as #70m, particularly when you take into account the massive spin-off in
records and video sales.
What we are promised is a warts-and-all portrait. The real story. Something we
should cherish, for it is unlikely that the three survivors will ever again
involve themselves in such a project.
Now comes the hype. ITV, having paid an estimated #5m to Apple Productions for
the series, naturally wish to make the most of it. So they embark upon this
massive public-awareness campaign. Suddenly there is a media blitz on The
Beatles. It starts with major articles in all the smart glossy magazines. Then
it moves to tabloid overkill. Finally, the quality press take the intellectual
high ground and start trying to analyse The Beatles' popularity. We are in the
middle of a nostalgia frenzy (this article, by its very nature, is part of it).
And there is more. To coincide with the launch of the programme, EMI (which,
like all record companies, is never slow in coming forward when there's a
marketing opportunity available) dusts down its old discarded Beatles tracks
from the vaults and prepares to release them in a blaze of reflected glory. It
already had a dry run last year with The Beatles Live at the BBC, a double-CD
of interesting but essentially inferior tracks from the group's early days,
which nevertheless sold more than five million copies.
The new recordings, also entitled The Beatles Anthology, will be much better.
Of that there can be little doubt. Produced in association with Apple, who
finally came to an agreement with EMI over access to the group's huge back
catalogue of material, it will consist of three double CDs (only the first will
be released this year) combining studio music, live recordings, radio and TV
sessions, and private tapes. Most of it has never been heard before. The
recordings have been carefully remixed by George Martin, appropriately in the
legendary Studio 2 at Abbey Road - using 1960s equipment for the sake of
authenticity - and Paul, George, and Ringo were also heavily involved in the
track selection process.
Among the 40-odd rare tracks on the first album are previously unreleased
versions of such Lennon/McCartney songs as Love Me Do, Please Please Me, and A
Hard Day's Night along with never-heard-before tracks such as In Spite Of All
Danger, an embryonic McCartney composition which was recorded by Lennon's
Quarrymen in 1958, a version of Ray Charles's Hallelujah I Love Her So from
1960, and Leiber and Stoller's Searchin'.
And then there's the big one. Or, to be more precise, the big two. Shortly
before his untimely death, Lennon made some rough recordings in New York of two
new songs, Real Love and Free As A Bird. As part of their involvement in the
anthology project, the three survivors took Lennon's demos and (together with
Martin) reworked them to include their backing vocals and instrumentation. So,
effectively, what we have are two brand new Beatles recordings. Which is rather
wonderful, whichever way you look at it.
Take away these two tracks, however, and what you have is an album of inferior
recordings. Like all bandwagon ``rarity'' recordings, they've been languishing
in the vaults for one good reason. And that is the fact that they probably
weren't very good in the first place. If The Beatles and George Martin had
considered them worthy, then they would have been released at the time. If you
like Love Me Do then you'll already have it; the best of it. Why should you
need it again?
Is this a tad churlish? Well, perhaps. As a true Beatles fan (they really did
influence my life; there was a time when a day never passed without me playing
their records), I look forward to the documentary series. I am genuinely
excited by the prospect. The series, after all, has been made with great love
and care by people of my fortysomething vintage. It affords us the opportunity
to re-create a portion of our youth. Perhaps it will even allow us to finally
persuade our techno-brat children that, without The Beatles, their music would
never have been. The Beatles, it appears, have never been more hip. Oasis are
not the only group to fall under their musical influence; they are merely the
latest. Blur even aped the fab four by playing up on the rooftops, Get Back
style. Clearly, The Beatles have cast a spell over a significant number of
today's guitar-based groups.
So are The Beatles - as were - really worth the hype - as is? Well, try
comparing them to anyone else. The Stones? Queen? Springsteen? Massive, yes.
Maybe even legendary in their own sweet way. But they could never hope to touch
The Beatles.
Part of the reason, of course, is the fact that The Beatles came first - which
gave them a head start. But in their short history, The Beatles quite simply
created the best pop music ever. If there were defining mom-ents during that
golden age of creative expression, the sixties, then it was John, Paul, George,
and Ringo who defined them. With every album, they moved the whole thing
forward. It was then left to everyone else to catch up.
They wrote and performed some of the most enduring music of the twentieth
century. A catalogue of more than 200 Northern Songs. They were witty, they
were dangerous, they were romantic, they were weird . . . they were damned near
everything under the sun. But, above all else, they were the best.
Choose a Beatles song? You can't. Choose half-a-dozen? You still can't. Choose
an album? Well, we've all got our favourite. With me it's Sgt Pepper because it
fondly reminds me of a time and an age. You can argue, but that recording (and
this is obviously a personal view and not a statement of fact) was not only The
Beatles' finest moment but also pop music's greatest achievement. It's a cliche
but it truly was the album by which all future albums would be judged. After
that it was downhill, albeit ever so slowly, for The Beatles. A long and
winding road to the inevitable break-up.
The double White Album was undoubtedly a tour de force but there were tiny,
almost imperceptible, signs of a worrying drop in quality, perhaps even
commitment. It was too long for a start and a few of the tracks (Revolution No.
9, in particular) smacked of self-indulgence. But, like everything else about
The Beatles, it was all relative. It was and still remains a masterpiece.
The White Album, we know now, was where the cracks began to appear. It was too
ambitious a project which took far too long to record. The pressure to create
served to adversely affect relationships. But, despite the hassles, they
soldiered on.
When they recorded the tracks for what would eventually be ``posthumously''
released as the Let It Be album the acrimony, hidden from view until then, was
achingly apparent and (thanks to a film crew's ubiquitous presence) recorded
for posterity. Lennon and McCartney were at each other's throats. Finally, in
the summer of 1969 they recorded Abbey Road and it was over. The Beatles were.
BEATLE-ZANIA
French Interviewer: The French have not made up their minds about the Beatles.
What do you think of them?
John: Oh, we like the Beatles. They're gear.
F.I: Do you like topless bathing suits?
Ringo: We've been wearing them for years.
John in an interview with Maureen Cleave:
Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. We`re more popular than Jesus
now; I don't know which will go first, rock'n'roll or Christianity. Jesus was
all right, but his disciples were thick and ordinary.
American Interviewer: Sorry to interrupt you while you are eating, but what do
you think you'll be doing in five years, when all this is over?
John: Still eating.
American Interviewer: What do you call your haircut?
George: Arthur.
American Interviewer: Do you wear wigs?
John: If we do, they must be the only ones with real dandruff.
British Interviewer (after the Beatles had received their MBEs): What about the
Queen?
Paul: She's lovely, great. She was just like a mum to us.
American Interviewer: One of your hits is Roll Over, Beethoven. What do you
think of Beethoven?
Ringo: He's great. Especially his poems.

THE little insect above looks harmless enough, but it could sour your morning
coffee, and it could drive the price of cappuccino out of sight. It's the
coffee berry borer beetle. It's incestuous, resistant to pesticides, and it is
a problem.
A new strain of the insect, entomologists say, could represent a serious threat
to the international coffee industry because it is resistant to the most
commonly used insecticides.
And because the beetle has a rare and unusual means of reproduction, the gene
that gives it protection from the pesticide may spread through the world
population faster than might be expected with other insects.
Scientists at Purdue University, and the Institut Francais de Recherche
Scientifique in New Caledonia say the bug's unusual sexuality is a threat to
the world's #10bn coffee trade. Females outnumber males by a 10-to-1 ratio. The
few males in the brood are unable to fly and never leave the coffee bean so
they mate with their flighty sisters before they fly off the bean.
This incestuous relationship increases the likelihood that offspring will
receive two doses of the resistance gene. Because of this, the resistance is
likely to spread throughout the population much faster.
Besides being of interest to Java junkies and those interested in the sexual
behaviour of insects, the coffee berry borer is intriguing to scientists
because recent discoveries indicate that the beetle may be an intermediate step
in the evolution of one of nature's genetic mysteries.
Most creatures, including humans, other mammals, birds and insects, have two
sets of chromosomes or genes, each inherited from either parent. However, in
one large class of insects that includes ants, wasps and bees, the males have
only one set of chromosomes, which they inherit from the mother. The coffee
berry borer appears to be an unusual intermediate between the two types. In the
coffee berry borer, the males receive both sets of chromosomes, but they shut
off the set they receive from the father.

SCOTTISH contractors made their mark once again last night following last
year's successful judging when nine entries were nominated for awards. Out of a
total of more than 78 entries, with three from overseas, the panel of judges
commented that winners ``scored high on all accounts''.
In the Domestic Garden Scheme Construction Category, costing more than #10,000,
Lorne Landscapes were principal award winners. Their instruction required the
planning and landscaping of grounds around an old farmhouse that overlooked
Loch Creran.
Trees had to be cleared and farm machinery removed from around the house which
is built on a ridge of gravel. A boggy area behind the house was drained and a
lochan constructed to produce a natural finish. An area of 12 acres was planted
in oaks and 15 varieties of trees and shrubs and a sweeping dry stane dike
measuring 300 yards built.
The design also won an award from Argyll and Bute based on buildings and
landscaping section.
Another principal award winner was Wilkinson Landscapes Ltd of Co Durham. In
the Domestic Garden Scheme Construction category costing less than #10,000 the
award centred on landscaping including the building of patio, steps, rock
retainers and pond at a house in an estate in the village of Newton Aycliffe.
The new de-sign gave a much bigger sitting area in Yorkshire style paving with
gravel and planting areas. A timber pergola helped soften the side utility area
and sandstone was used to build retaining walls for the top garden. A pond with
rock steps was positioned to be visible from the bungalow, and provide access
to the top lawn.
Premier One Tree Services Ltd of Linlithgow has won an award in the Grounds
Maintenance category for its maintenance and general upkeep work carried out at
General Accident's data processing unit in Dundee. Last year the company won an
award in the Soft Landscape Construction category for the same facility.
Designers were Ian White Associates of Stirling. Chairman of the adjudicators,
Bill Gillespie commented: ``An excellent example of good honest workmanship and
planned, directed effort. The result shows exactly why clients should use BALI
contractors for satisfaction and value for money.''
Landscaping takes many forms and is often carried out in a variety of
conditions and locations. Rentokil Tropical Plants of Bath was given the task
of internal planting on the Oriana cruise liner, a design installation that had
to consider the various environments found on board a ship such as the swings
of temperature between pool areas and open decks.
On the face of it the project was not too dissimilar to the design installation
for an office, however, the company had a logistics headache when the liner
instead of docking at Southampton stayed in Germany. And plants, pots and
personnel were packed up for an unexpected journey.
But for their efforts the company won an award in the design and build
category. Its Aberdeen office was also successful in the interior landscape
category with its work carried out at Amereda Hess, an oil company in the
granite city. Particular reference was made to the quality of maintenance and
work in the reception area.
In the Interiors Landscape Installation category at cost over #10,000, Waterers
Landscape Ltd, Windlesham, Surrey appeared winners for work completed in a
Government building in Cheltenham. The company acquired, climatised and
installed the plants in an exotic interior scheme for an atrium created by
adapting a courtyard wrapped round by the existing buildings and relying on the
adjoining office heating.
The scheme has achieved its objective by greatly improving the staffs' working
environment and where they may relax in colourful exotic surroundings amid
Kentia Palms from the Pacific, Zagloul Palms from Egypt, Adonia Palms from
Florida and Peace Lillies from Columbia.
Bromeliads were used for underplanting and although normally tree climbers,
they have been used for their bright and exotic colours over a long flowering
season. Some replicas (silk flowers) have been used in those areas where the
supplementary lighting is insufficient.
The Soft Landscape Construction Scheme, under one hectare, was won by Evergreen
Landscapes of Bristol. The concept of the display garden was to provide a
showcase for its potential clients. The garden is also used by charities for
open fundraising days and as a domestic garden site.
David Stevens was required to design a garden suitable for personal use and
also as a client display garden. It had to reflect quality of work, use
different materials and show a variety of styles yet retain the effect of a
complete garden. The completed garden has a multitude of materials and plants
to create areas with swings of style and mood. Some of the features include
timber and metal arches, shrub borders, rockery, waterfall, lawns and seating
areas.
A Scottish company, New Lands (Contracts) Ltd of East Kilbride won an award in
the Grounds Maintenance (with limited public access) category for its work at
Gap Housing Association, Glasgow.
In this contract the work comprised the reinstatement of overgrown gardens and
open spaces plus regular maintenance. Additional sites are being added to the
contract as new build properties come out of their defects liability period,
and as existing older properties are acquired by the housing association.
The range of properties are quite diverse, ranging from traditional red
sandstone tenement blocks to new purpose-built sheltered housing complexes. The
regional contract currently covers Greater Glasgow, Monklands, Renfrewshire,
Ayrshire and Dunbartonshire.
Last year New Lands (Contracts) won a Principal Award for Grounds Maintenance
for the Northern Development Area, East Kilbride.
Bill Peebles, chairman, welcomes delegates
Following last year's massive success, the British Association of Landscape
Industries has once again brought its national landscape awards ceremony to the
city of Glasgow. But not only that, its annual conference, entitled
Benchmarking - Managing the Process has also been incorporated.
As last year, there are a wide selection of winners, encompassing Scotland's
Bali Contractors, who have won a significant number of awards themselves. This
year, awards have been made to a domestic garden in North-east England, a major
hard landscape site in Glasgow; P&amp;O's flagship cruise liner, Oriana; and an oil
rig in the North Sea. This clearly identifies the work that BALI contractors
undertake and the quality of that work

IT'S been foretold by the techno-wizards who say the television in the corner
will be used just like a computer . . . and vice versa. Well, sooner than
later, this is it, the PCTV, the conjunction of systems.
Made by Fujitsu ICL, it's an all-in-one box that is computer, television, and
CD player, and the makers claim that while it's small, it's big on
entertainment, education, and convenience. Possibly it's ideal for users who
fancy a break and get bored by those interminable screen savers. They can
simply switch to television and enjoy Cell Block H.
The whole thing comes as one unit plus a keyboard, and with only one mains
lead. The first PC to have a built-in fully functioning TV, the picture quality
is said to be very high, even when viewed close up, and it has Nicam
digi-stereo playing through two flush speakers developed from Philips'
ground-breaking Acoustic Horn system.
ICL say their baby explodes the myth that computers are complicated. It's aimed
at the new-user market, people who might find technology a turn-off, but will
find this easy to turn on. It even has a remote control for that very purpose.
PCTV comes with an on-screen tutorial, illustrated by picture images for
instructions in keyboard use, and it has a built-in trackball. The system can
be programmed through Teletext for personal TV listings and will even send a
busy user a screen message to say when a programme is about to start.
Probably ideal for people with little spare space, and an idea that hi-tech
should be low profile. Comes in at #1500 less #1.
GLASGOW has become a dear green place once again, thanks to the big city
clean-up campaign. And this is not good news. The green is caused by algae,
which is causing a sheen on stone buildings. According to Dr Norman Tennent of
the University of Strathclyde's Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, some
chemicals used to clean buildings has made them vulnerable to algae attacks.
Even the City Chambers in George Square has gone down with a dose of the
greens. Dr Tennent organised a recent meeting of scientists working in the
field of art and architectural conservation to address these and other
problems. The major museums and galleries including the V &amp; A, British Museum
and the National Museums of Scotland were represented.
In a city such as Glasgow, the algae problem could have further cultural
effects in the city of culture. If scientists don't find a cure for the greens,
they will probably have to look to the biochemists to develop a blue algae,
just to keep the cultural, if not the ecological, balance.
THE ancients used snow stored in straw-packed boxes. Later, scientists used
the principle of evaporation cooling to invent the refrigerator. Now a group of
Israeli scientists have taken cool a further leap forward. They've invented
``liquid'' ice.
Ontec Ltd in Beersheva has developed a liquid ice generation system which
produces a gel-like slush, based on fresh or sea water and a number of secret
ingredients. The system, they say, not only cools the slush and freezes it more
efficiently than standard ice machines, but it produces a coolant as cold as,
or even colder than, ice. But while it's frigid, it ain't rigid, so this super
coolant will pump to where it's needed.
The firm say they've succeeded in binding the superior heat transfer capacity
of ice to the superior fluid attributes of water. The new development rests
solidly on the laws of physics. The process produces crystals surrounded by a
fluid jacket which prevents the crystals from sticking together the way water
crystals do, which gives them enough fluidity to circulate in cooling systems
which make them work better.
The fluid ice can also be made during the night when power is cheaper and when
the temperature is cooler, making the manufacture cheaper too.
MICROSOFT say they will add support for the digital ISDN telephone service to
their Windows 95 operating system to enable rapid access to information. The
company say ISDN solves the need for higher data transmission speeds, with a
ten-fold increase over traditional analogue modems. The support enables rapid
access to the Internet.

As we continue to coat the planet in plastic,
Joe Donnelly asks if we're laying the foundations
of years of scientific research for our descendants
ABOUT 67 million years ago, the dinosaurs were wiped out. Scientists believe
their extinction may have been triggered by a global catastrophe caused by an
asteroid impact on the earth. This theory is based on the discovery of a layer
of iridium, only a few centimetres deep, which has been found around the world
and has been dated to around the time the big lizards died.
What has this to do with today's technology, you may ask. Here's the answer. In
as many millions of years into the future, scientists, human or otherwise, will
find a thin layer of rare and complex molecules under the earth's surface.
Their tests will date it to the late twentieth century. If they have
sophisticated equipment, they will be able to show the layer was laid down in a
mere 70 years or so, and then suddenly stopped.
This layer will be plastic: complex chains of tough organic polymers, dumped
all over the world by messy humans. The fact that the deposit will suddenly
stop, could be down to the work of one Scotsman.
He is Dr Oliver Peebles, from Slamannan, near Grangemouth, a PhD graduate of
Aberdeen University, now working in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His claim to
fame, and it's a fair claim too, is that he's done some very interesting
recombinant DNA work with bacteria, which makes them do something quite
astounding. They make plastic.
What's more, it's a plastic which breaks down after it's been used, and it's
likely to have a stunning effect on our planet's ecology.
A century ago, plastic was virtually unknown, except as a laboratory curiosity.
Now it's the most ubiquitous substance used by man. Where once plastic bags
were a novelty, now they're stuck in every tree and barbed wire fence. Bottles,
containers, and all sorts of objects made from the stuff litter our beaches and
hedgerows. Future scientists will have no trouble finding it, because it will
still be there, intact, in millions of years. Plastic lasts forever. In
comparison, a diamond is for about ten minutes.
NOW Peebles, who has a BSc in biochemistry and a doctorate in molecular
biology, has married his two fields of expertise to get bugs to make what man
has been looking for - a plastic which is tough enough to last as long as
needed, then breaks down into something environmentally nice. What's more, he's
able to transfer the bacteria genes to get plants to do the same thing on a
huge scale.
``We use recombinant DNA systems to make polymers,'' says Peebles, who has
co-founded the Metabolics Company, next to Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, to develop the system. He came to MIT in 1984 and got involved in
applying molecular biology to industrial problems, a fairly open field as most
of his peers were working on new drugs.
``The first stage was to get bacteria to manufacture types of polymer as a food
store. The next is to use the genetic material from the bacteria to get plants
to do the same thing, and we can then form it into film and plastic bags and
containers.
``The great thing is that when it's used, it can be thrown into a compost heap
and it will simply be eaten by bacteria so that it will be broken down again.
``The system was pioneered in the seventies by ICI, who produced a commercial
product, but it was prohibitively expensive. Now there is a demand for a cheap
plastic which is biodegradable. If you think of all those disposable nappies,
fast-food containers, bottles, and the like, they will be around forever. On
the Continent, some Governments, like Germany's, are really pushing this kind
of development because there is real concern about the ecology. Sooner or
later, we will have to realise the plastic problem will not go away, unless we
develop a plastic that will go away.
``We have developed cutting-edge gene technology for making the stuff, and we
can make it at a cost the market will accept. When you think that the
biodegradable market is about #500m, it's really worthwhile.
``Our gene technique allows us to make the plastic for about $4 a kilo, which
is still high compared to polystyrene. But that price will come down because we
have patented a method of splicing the genes into plants like rapeseed which
can be used as agri-manufacturers to make the plastic for us.
``Already, the world is developing industrial agriculture to manufacture some
goods. Now we have the technology which will allow farms to make vast
quantities of industrial plastic that is truly degradable.
``Our plastic, derived from crops, will break down in the soil, or in the sea.
If you look at the shores around Scotland, littered with plastic, that can only
be a good thing. Plastic itself is a great material and people like it. They
don't want to go back to glass bottles for every liquid, but people don't like
to think we are polluting the world by dumping uncountable millions of tons of
the stuff that will never erode.
``Very soon, there will be a great pressure on industry to use materials which
are much more environmentally friendly. As long as it is cheap enough to
produce, then industry, and therefore the consumer, will welcome it.
``I'll be pleased to have played a part in that. The day is coming when we will
be able to buy as many plastic-wrapped goods as we want, then simply bury the
stuff in our gardens to help plants to grow.
``That's a great deal better than leaving it lying around for millions of
years.''

VINCENT is a reputedly revolutionary new digital video engine from Data
Translation. Data says the single-card engine for Apple's Powermac systems is a
benchmark for digital video power, quality, and simplicity. It augments and
improves on the two-card design to give users higher performance.
HEWLETT-Packard has announced the HP CopyJet printer-copier, the first to
integrate colour printing and digital copying in one unit. Selling at #2139,
the system copies at around 5p a page.
LOGITECH, a frontrunner in pointing devices, has launched the TrackMan Marble,
a thumb-operated trackball with marble sensing technology for tracking ball
movement. The system offers virtually maintenance-free and consistently smooth
operation.
WITH computer theft on the increase and a huge surge evident in black-market
chips, ICL, one of the major suppliers of personal computers in Europe, has
been taking steps to combat the hardware thieves.
ICL computers now come with anti-theft devices which protect them in the same
way as car radios. If the machine is disconnected from mains power, it can only
be used again, once reconnected, after the user has given a pre-specified
password. There's also a password protection, a dual level key word that can be
set to prevent unauthorised start-up after the machine has been switched on.
Without the password, the system software will fail to load.
Data files are also encrypted with a user specific key which prevents them
being read. The protection is built into the normal windows interface and
protects files on fixed and exchangeable media and across networks.
Physically, the internal hardware can be protected, to a degree, with a
mechanical key lock which seals the PC cabinet to prevent unauthorised access
to the works, helping to prevent theft of data and valuable hardware like disc
drives and feature cards.
ICL says all its products carry bar and serial numbers enabling them to be
tracked to commercial users and purchasers. It is examining the most effective
way of registering and tracking all PCs sold to individual purchasers, and is
toying with the idea of including an ultra-violet marking kit with every
computer as a simple, proven, and cost-effective deterrent.
IT'S a brave, interactive and integrated new world, according to Granada, the
TV rental firm, which predicts that by the year 2000 more than half the
households in Britain will have at least one personal computer and will have
gone interactive.
Granada's look at the future paints a rosy virtual picture of computer-control,
with almost everything from voice recognition systems for door entry security
to switching on appliances. PCs will be so sophisticated that home automation
will be the norm, doing almost everything but the vacuum-cleaning. The gadgets
for the new century, according to Granada, include the Plasmotron, the ultimate
Flat Screen television which is only three inches thick and simply hangs on the
wall. Starting prices are expected to be about #7000, but should be affordable
by 2001.
Digital television will have a simple decoder on top of the television with a
tiny antenna to pick up CD quality sound and digital pictures with access to
some 200 channels, making the roof aerial extinct. Interactive television and
video will let viewers choose not only what they watch but also how to end the
film. Granada also predicts that people will soon be able to participate live
in TV games shows. Did we say the future looked rosy?
And there's more. The shape of things to come will also have a face . . . an

one's beck and call to do all those little tasks like setting alarms, doing the
shopping and even, so Granada bravely suggests, phoning one's mother.

PROPAGANDISTS in the Second World War may have been inadvertently telling the
truth when they were telling whoppers.
Trying to disguise the early use of radar, the War Office said that British
pilots were eating carrots, which gave them much-improved night vision.
In fact, Vitamin A, found in high concentrations in carrots, seems to be
successful in combating a rare genetic disorder which causes blindness. The
vitamin is converted by the eye into retinal, a molecule which is used to
detect light. In tests, one patient found his night-blindness had returned
after concentrated doses of Vitamin A. So Bugs Bunny was far-sighted
after all
Los Alamos resear-chers, working with Texas Instruments of Dallas, have
developed a prototype electronic module that allows a huge increase in the
amount of miniaturised circuitry packed into a single package and vastly boosts
its performance. The ``High-Density Interconnect'' multichip module achieves
twice the density of circuit interconnections found in other comparable
technology. The HDI module demonstrates better performance, lower power
consumption, and higher reliability than existing systems, making it ideal for
applications in space systems and just about everything else.
Flatulence from farm animals is thought to be one source of greenhouse gases.
They increase when food animals are fed cereals, and it's a serious and
evil-smelling pollutant in major producing centres. Chemicals firm Rhone
Poulenc has applied for a British patent on a system which curbs all this hot
air by adding glucanaze to the feed. A check on the ammonia levels in a chicken
battery was significantly lower after the diet, tests showed.

MAKE-UP designers are making a big meal of colour co-ordination this Christmas.
They say you should wear red lipstick at fancy dress and office parties. Red,
they enthuse, makes a woman seem vampish and seductive, dangerous and
delicious, brooding and beautiful.
Designers are big on adjectives. I always find it completely outrageous that
anyone should expect a lifetime's mess of emotion to suddenly simplify and
produce a clear-minded and choreographed vixen for the party season, merely by
choosing a more bloody shade of lipstick. I see red often, as it happens, as I
am becoming much more intolerant than I used to be.
I resent time laid aside for dealing with the stupid and the cloying. But
thankfully I see red more often on some silly, insipid wee girl who wants to
appear grown-up and in control.
Celebrities with their own range of make-up, such as Paloma Picasso, have
customised the colour red and parade it as the insignia of a sultry, Latin
temperament, and it works. When the time comes to entertain some kind of
abandon, the wannabee hedonists pull out the Mon Rouge.

THE Cheap and Cheerful Department at Beauty Box Headquarters suggests
handpainting washed out T-shirts with Dylon's range of dyes and fabric paints
in order to give them a new lease of life.
Indeed, Dylon are somewhat fanatical about getting the public to start
painting. This is a mission perhaps, to help us find the creative urge within
the adult, supressed from childhood onwards. The best way, they infer, to deal
with constipation of an artistic nature, is to paint  surreal designs on your
clothes, then you can go around showing them off.
In fact, get enough people to do it and you could sit on the subway and play
spot-the-neurosis. Dylon, the therapists of the future, have even provided a
consumer hotline which will dispense advice, a sort of psychiatrists's chair.
Maybe it backchats with questions such as ``Why do you feel the need to paint
yellow circles and red spots on your Conran shirt? Do you see them often?'' If
only it was so, but I guess it's just a service for helping you find that
particular shade of magenta.

Not quite role models
KNOWING we'll be interested, Options magazine has sent Beauty Box a synopsis of
the contents of the latest issue. Something called The Facts Behind the Figures
- Supermodel Vice Survey. The feature tries to deal the dirt on the true lives
of the models and we have been kindly supplied with a chart for our persual,
which we duly distorted.
What do supermodels drink? 92% drink beer; 8% responded: ``What is drink?''
What do they eat? 85% eat red meat; 15% queried: ``What is eating?''
What vices do they have? 78% smoke and own a push-up bra; 22% are push-ups.
What about their weight? 65% have never dieted; 35% prefer bulimia.
What about stress? 57% bite their nails; 43% marry rock stars.
What about chat? 42% own a cellular phone; 58% confess to not learning how to
converse.
Who do they date? 35% date actors or rock stars; 65% don't understand the
concept.
And ambitions? 14% take acting classes; 86% can't think.
n BRITISH Home Stores ``Lingerie Fortnight'' is an exclusive promotion which
aims to encourage women to pamper themselves. For every #30 spent in the
lingerie, sleepwear, and hosiery departments, Christmas shoppers will receive a
gift voucher worth #5 to use in the same departments plus womenswear.
Intriguingly, BHS tell Beauty Box all about their tempting ``warm, brushed
cotton-pyjamas in a striking tartan'', a wonderful buy at #25, but what about
satin suspenders and stockings and lacy French knickers? I mean, in what way is
buying a romper suit, settling down for the night in purdah, pampering oneself?
No wonder men buy women sexy undies. It's not because they want to humiliate
you, or want a baby doll, they just thought you'd fancy a change.
The BHS `Lingerie Fortnight' voucher offer runs nationwide and ends on
November 26.
Confession of a
sugar plum fairy
UNDER a pelt of tomatoes and accusations of Scrooge, I have to say I hate this
season. It's fun choosing Christmas presents, but I hate the endless round of
parties. It wouldn't matter if I got invited to any interesting ones but I
don't. And after coming out as a crabby prude, I certainly won't be now.
I am not, therefore, at all worried about how I'll look in that bare-backed,
mini-dress with the shoelace straps, as Weightwatchers has kindly pointed out I
might be wearing. The ``Fat Police'' as I call them are doing their rounds,
asking us to grab an inch or a foot or two of food, thoughtfully stored up
during the summer for any cold, starving nights this winter.
Their press release shouts joyfully, like a born-again Christian asking you to
repent, ``Be Fab not Flabby this Christmas''. Oh whoopee! Wouldn't you rather
be fabby than flabby? I love that word-play. Weightwatchers then go on about
how to deal with the shock that you can't do your zips right up to the waist, a
part of your anatomy, of course, which is disappearing altogether under folds
of flesh piled up on top of each other, like blankets in the spare room.
In order to lose weight, they advise, take a look at some of the recipes in
their Merry Christmas Cookbook. There's Golden Stuffed Turkey and Chocolate
Pots with Tia Maria or Chestnut and Vegetable Stir-fry. And if they can't bore
you off food, they have ``real-life experts'' who've drawn up ``a multitude of
cunning ploys to deal with social problem areas''. What? Society has other
social problems apart from fat people?
WW's suggest saying to people who pester you to have a drink, that your glass
of orange juice really contains vodka. That's a good idea - it means you can
cheat while taking part in drinking-each-other-under-the-table competitions. If
you can tear yourself away from a set of scales, that is.
Weightwatchers' Christmas Cookbook is available at meetings throughout the
country. For details of your nearest meetings call 01628 777077.

It was an ordinary night at the theatre when Marcella Evaristi looked back in
anger to confront the phantom sweetie-eater
I WAS at the theatre the other night, in a Dress Circle seat (an expensive
treat from a kind friend), leaning forward on the velvety balcony, riveted by
Stoppard's cat's-cradle of dialogue pulling in and out of itself, when the
first little crackle happened. Directly behind me. My head did a tiny sideways
twitch and I thought ``Bloody hell, a theatre sweetie merchant'', and grudged
the distraction. I hope it's the flavour you loathe, that coffee-and-rum one, I
thought, and you haven't noticed in the dark - our dark - my dark. May it lodge
itself on to your plate like black Blu-Tak so your tongue has to battle with
your dentures till the interval. I thought, please unwrap it quickly will you
so I can forget this tick of distraction ever happened. For after the
unwrapping surely you will pop your stupid sweetie in your stupid mouth (I'm
not at all nice when I'm concentrating).
But this was a seriously selfish crackle. This was no apologetic ``I'm sorry,
I'll unwrap very quickly, I promise I will, I won't try and do it subtly and
slowly - that only prolongs the agony - I will do it rippingly, like an
Elastoplast, to get it over with. I'm sorry, but believe me, it's better this
way. Honestly, I'd be coughing like Steptoe otherwise. And I swear it's not a
crunchy one, it's a silent sookie one. Soon you'll forget it ever happened.''
Oh no.
Behind-Me's crackling was taking too long for that. The noise scrunched
relentlessly towards my head; it stalked nearer and nearer while the whole
stage began drifting further away and down. The generous ticket money was spent
waste now, for suddenly I was sitting in the very back row of the gods. Through
a sickness of vertigo I could barely focus on Sharon Maughan, much less hear
what she was saying. One minute she was explaining how that early
nineteenth-century landscape commonly held to be organically archetypally
English, was in fact a contrived vista whose source was human painters, not
``nature'' at all. Next minute, all I could make out was that she was tilting
her head wryly and lifting a cup. She might as well have been back in her Gold
Blend advert.
I realised no mere sweetie was involved here. It must be a Crunchie. No, it was
even taking too long for that. I missed something major on stage involving
Newton and Byron as I considered the alternatives. Yes, I whisper. Yes. My
friend glances towards me, thinking I have softly endorsed Stoppard's
demolition of dubious academicism. But the ``Yes'' was actually the beginning
of me thinking ``Yes, I've got it. The only confection this can possibly be, to
necessitate this eternity of unwrap, is the giant Toblerone. God, giant
Toblerones, I haven't seen one of those since . . . ''
People were laughing at some rejoinder, laughing not up but down-roariously, so
as not to miss out on the next line. And there was I, squandering my friend's
money, decoding confectioner's crackle, all because of this cretin. He probably
wasn't listening anyway. Probably only there because his wife's doing an
extra-mural class in contemporary drama, which he's delighted about, I bet,
because while she's Pintering away, he's pausing late with his secretary.
The bastard. I am losing out on my first outing in weeks because of a
philandering nerd, a two-faced philistine who probably wankled his ticket on
expenses. (Ed: Don't you mean ``wangled''? Me: I know what I mean.) And I'm
just sitting here, tense in my posh seat, with a surreal sense of sitting in
the worst seat at the King's, Arcadia's plot forever lost to me, wondering what
I will say about the play in the interval. ``I wonder how they got that pretend
tortoise to move in that lifelike way? Wasn't it clever of the author to call
him `Lightning'?''
No. I take a breath, I turn round from the waist, and I stare. Pointedly, is
not the word. The stare is pure acupuncture. And I don't look at his face, I
stare at the crackle source, and then slowly return my back to him. My thoughts
black out, then slowly the lights go up on the realisation that he has nothing
in his hand but a sweetie paper. Sitting there in his suit, looking straight
ahead, rubbing away at a little piece of dark corrugated paper (my eyes have
adjusted by this time).
Not even a toffee of an excuse. The crackling continues. I might as well be
watching The Singing Kettle. In fact The Singing Kettle will be my next big
outing over the next few months. There's a big red star on my impressively
professional year wall planner to prove it. But pusillanimous - a word I learnt
appositely enough from Look Back in Anger when I was 15 - wretch that I am, I
wait till Act Two before I turn round and say, quietly, but with projection,
``Would you stop doing that, please?''
The noise stops, the stage moves towards me, two couples separated by centuries
are waltzing around the same space, and a little later the stage cloth
descends. I will never know how, earlier in this torture, the tortoise got
downstage and where the lettuce came from. Never mind, says the Pollyanna part
of my soul, maybe Behind-Me's wife has met some nice young man at her evening
class, who makes her laugh. Perhaps they go to matinees on Saturday afternoons,
and hold hands instead of wrappers. And maybe this year, she will have a good
secret reason not to mind that predictable marital Christmas present, the huge
shop-wrapped box of chocolates, flat as a pizza carton, wide as a lawnmower,
and personal as a personal ad. For you see, when you're in the wrong seat, you
sometimes have to make up an alternative new play for yourself.
After I had voiced my pathetically postponed objection, I overheard a woman say
to her friend, in a small, relieved voice: ``She's just asked him to stop!'' A
little circle seated around Behind-Me had obviously been suffering silently
too. Everyone had been similarly aggravated and everyone had been waiting for a
braver soul to speak up. This ``you go first'' attitude is deeply ingrained in
our fearful psyches, the fear being that our allies will melt away behind us
should we go forwards.
I remember at a post-performance party at the Edinburgh Festival years ago, a
small group of us were discussing a rather dull Dryden play, and we all agreed
that the actress in the leading role had vastly contributed to the tedium by
hamming it up to a quite baroque extent. When joined by an actor from the show,
we all neutrally discussed the author and honestly complimented his performance
- one poor soul then proceeded to repeat the judgment on the leading lady,
giving a neat synopsis of our shared low opinion of her skill. We weren't
implicated though, she spoke only for herself.
The actor pulled back his shoulders and went all raised-jaw and haughty. ``I
must disagree,'' he said, ``I believe my wife's quite magnificent performance
to be the absolute highlight of the production.'' And off he marched. The poor
woman blushed and stammered and looked like she wanted a trap-door to swallow
her up. But she also looked betrayed, as if we should all have got into
trouble; as if we should have done the decent thing and owned up to the
consensus. And I guiltily couldn't help but sympathise with her. She ``went
first'' while we had studiously inspected our canapes.
Going out on a limb can easily become going out in limbo if you've got dodgy
backers. God is love, said Mae West, but get it in writing. Same thing goes for
being a spokesperson because the conduit for the collective can easily become
perceived as the troublemaker. And, next stage, the scapegoat. So most remain
unconscientious objectors, silently drinking the corked wine, chewing on the
gristle they should have sent back to the kitchen, quietly accepting
aggravation as the price for a quiet life - with ulcers.
One of the satisfactions of writing fiction is that the ``wish I'd said that''
is actually granted. You can go first, say the right thing, delete the
inadequate, and take three hours to come up with an instant rejoinder. It's the
perfect profession for the loud-mouthed coward; sitting in front of the screen
in an empty house you can bravely tap the offender's selfish shoulder, then
confidently insist that he immediately desist. Then you can make yourself a cup
of coffee and rewrite the articulate diatribe. And it's unanswerable, because
that's how you've fixed it.
But I honestly did tell Behind-Me to stop crackling - and he didn't answer. I'm
going to write it on my year wall planner, ``Stoppard's Arcadia - very
daring'', because that's the most courageous thing I've done since I told the
children that their goldfish had died, instead of replacing it while they were
at school. Well, they were only five and I had wanted to postpone the mortality
discussion. The fact that the pet shop didn't have one the same colour had
nothing to do with it.

My favourite Beatles song is Let It Be, because I haven't. My second favourite
is Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, but that cannot be taken as an admission of
anything.
Alex Salmond, SNP
Tomorrow Never Knows from Revolver. This track stands out and it's a sign of
things to come later on Sgt Pepper. The recording techniques are, I'm told,
very advanced for the time and certainly the sound has influenced many current
bands. like Oasis and PM Dawn.
David Campbell,
chief executive, Virgin Radio
FIVE BEATLES SINGLES THAT DIDN'T MAKE No.1
Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever (1967, kept off top slot by Engelbert
Humperdinck's Release Me).
Something/Come Together (1969, No 4).
Let it Be (1970, kept off top slot by Lee Marvin's Wandrin' Star).
Yesterday (No 8 in 1976).
The Long and Winding Road (not released as a single in Britain, although it
made No 1 in America).
It's all beautiful stuff. All those early songs like Love Me Do, I Wanna Hold
Your Hand and She Loves You. They're all very simple love songs, but they are
done with such fresh spontaneity. None of us knew what was happening at the
time, none of us ever realised what a global influence they would have.
Alan Freeman, broadcaster
I saw them when I was 21 in Liverpool in a special show with David Jacobs and I
thought they were the greatest. I've the entire record collection. There is
only Bach, Mozart and The Beatles.
Jeffrey Archer, novelist
As a spry 45 year old I'd hoped to sneak through life without ever being asked
to name my favour-ite Beatles song. I feel like a Chelsea Pensioner being asked
to relive his war experiences.
The only one that still excites me is A Day In The Life because it caught the
feeling that life is a continual fugue of boredom and madness, again a bit like
war.
Maybe when all the old codgers die off they'll be replaced by geriatric Beatles
fans shuffling past the cenotaph to the strains of Sgt Pepper. If so, I hope I
die before I get old(er).
Ian Pattison
The Beatles were always a little too clean-cut for my liking, but I loved I Am
A Walrus and Polythene Pam. They were a lot dirtier than the usual. I remember
listening to them and loving them as a schoolgirl far too long ago.
Pam Hogg, Designer
Eight Days A Week. It was the song that made me fall in love with John Lennon.
I was five when my auntie used to play it to me from the Beatles For Sale
album. It was the first song that made me feel something. People say that they
were too clean but compared to Saint Cliff they were blessed relief.
Elaine C Smith
The song that brings back the biggest wave of nostalgia is Ticket To Ride. For
years I thought it was ``I've got a ticket to Rye'', where maybe there was a
big pop concert going on. I loved the movies too, at that time it would take
films a year to reach Belfast, but Help! and A Hard Day's Night came in just a
week.
