HILDA McLEAN reports on the progress of a young electrical work
trainee who has proved that he can handle responsibility for a #1m
building project
AYOUNG trainee has taken a big step forward in his career as a result
of the Youth Employment and Training Initiative (YETI), sponsored by
Strathclyde Business Development -- the economic development arm of the
regional council.
Twenty-two-year-old Rod McClenaghan is the trainee behind the
electrical work in a lecture theatre recently unveiled at the Western
Infirmary in Glasgow.
Rod, who is employed by consulting engineers Ramsay and Primrose,
through the YETI scheme, was assigned to designing and setting out the
electrical works for the #1m building under the supervision of the
company's chairman, Mr Tony Ownsworth.
Over the past year Rod has worked alongside the mechanical engineers,
architects and contractors to establish ducting and cabling for his
designs for lighting, power supplies, fire detection, security and
hi-tech audio-visual facilities.
Mr Ownsworth said: ''As an electrical contract worth #86,000, it
represents a sizeable element of the contract works but I was very
confident of Rod's abilities successfully to undertake the design.
''While he supervised throughout it was up to him, based on the
company's design policies, to make the initial decisions and to see them
through the construction process and accomplish the project brief at
commissioning and handover.
''During the 80s many companies cut back on training, which led to a
shortage of apprentices coming through in this field. At Ramsay and
Primrose, we have, however, realised that training is integral to the
future success of our firm and the building industry.
''Through YETI we were able to take on Rod and provide him with
training. He has proved to be a credit to our company and to the
scheme.''
Under YETI, Rod was taken on for an initial two years' training --
working four days a week and attending Stow College on the fifth with
Ramsay and Primrose receiving a grant to contribute to his wages and
college fees.
Kathleen Donachie, a training adviser with SBD, said: ''The YETI
scheme was created specifically to increase the amount of high-quality
vocational training for young people between 18 and 24 with a view to
preparing them for real jobs and careers, particularly in areas where
there are skills shortages.''
Councillor Joseph McLean, chair of the region's economic and
industrial development committee, said: ''I am delighted that through
Strathclyde Business Development's YETI scheme and Ramsay and Primrose,
Rod has been given a head start in his career. He has been retained by
the company and we now hope he will go on to become a fully chartered
electrical engineer.''
The lecture theatre, which is a joint project for Glasgow University
and West Glasgow Hospitals University NHS Trust, seats 350 people within
the main auditorium and two separate seminar rooms.
Set to be used for leading international lectures on medical matters,
the theatre also has the latest air conditioning as well as seminar
rooms into which lectures can be relayed.
Originally from Northern Ireland, Rod moved to Scotland to work with a
local building firm until his contract period had finished.
Rod, who recently gained his HNC in electrical installation and
design, said: ''It's quite an achievement for me to be designing
installations rather than carrying out the work from someone else's
design.''

TOMMY Dowens, coach to Scottish men's volleyball champions City of
Glasgow Ragazzi, continues his search for perfection.
Ragazzi, who have not dropped a set this season, advanced to the
semi-finals of the Royal Bank Scottish Cup on Sunday and look
increasingly formidable.
Their 15-0, 15-3, 15-9 cup quarter-final win came just 24 hours after
a 15-0, 15-13, 15-10 win over Dundee in the league, but still Dowens is
not happy.
''We need to be mentally tougher,'' he said. ''We won the first set
against Dundee 15-0 in 10 minutes and then took 25 minutes to win the
next.
''If we are to make progress, we have to sort this out. This was what
went wrong in Europe -- we were physically up to the job but our speed
of thought was not quick enough.''
The concern is such that the club held a meeting of all coaches on
Sunday night to discuss the problem.
The draw for the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup will be made later
this week and it will feature a second division team, MCA Cardinals II,
for the first time in 15 years. Team Blantyre are in the last four for
the first time and the other semi-finalists are Kilmarnock.
Hazlehead did Scottish women's champions MCA Powerhouse Cardinals a
favour on Saturday by beating Rucanor Jets 16-14, 1-15, 15-13, 15-12. It
effectively ended Jets' hopes of the league. MCA can afford another
defeat and still retain the title.

CELTIC hope to sell Paul Byrne to Watford, who want to see him at
close quarters in their own environment next week before closing a deal,
but Tommy Burns may already have his eyes on another winger, Dundee's
under-21 internationalist Neil McCann.
Although Burns recently said he might prefer to spend Celtic's money
on Continental players because they generally provide better value, he
has to keep track of players developing in Scotland, and McCann is one
of the brightest talents on an otherwise barren domestic landscape.
If the 20-year-old continues to impress it would not be surprising to
see Celtic make a move for him at the end of the season, and I believe
they will.
McCann was introduced as a substitute in Scotland's under-21 match
against Greece in Athens last month and turned the European Championship
qualifying tie in his side's favour with his electrifying runs on the
flanks. His is a skill which must interest managers who prefer to see
their teams attack and Burns falls into this category.
The Celtic manager said yesterday that he has not had contact with Jim
Duffy, his counterpart at Dundee, and Burns would not be willing to fuel
speculation which might upset momentum at Dens Park at a time when they
are pushing for promotion from the first division, but McCann has
obvious appeal. He is also one of only a few young Scottish players
proving that he has the skill to go all the way.
Burns, who has Celtic's share option money to spend, already has high
hopes for Brian McLaughlin, who has shown he could make the grade even
though he lacks height and body strength. If given a fair share of the
breaks and protected properly by referees, McLaughlin might just prosper
in the premier division, but Burns added: ''While I think Brian has come
in and been effective I don't think we are looking at a player who would
be used in 55 games in a season.
''However, he links well with Stuart Gray and he has given us an
option, although I hope people will allow him his bad games as he
continues to develop.''
Byrne would have gone south to work out with Watford this week, but
their training ground is flooded and his move has been delayed until
next week. Burns is hoping the Vicarage Road club like what they see.
Mike Galloway crossed the Border last week to begin a month loan
period with Leicester City, but he damaged a hamstring in training and
is returning to have treatment at Celtic Park. However, once restored to
fitness he will travel back down and try again to convince Mark McGhee
that he should be given a long-term contract.
Obviously Burns is working hard to make room for newcomers, but his
endeavours might serve only to strengthen Kilmarnock's claim that they
lost one of the most promising young managers in the business when he
left them in the close season to take over at Celtic Park. Ever since,
the Rugby Park club have been claiming compensation and the stage moved
closer to a conclusion yesterday when both clubs agreed the make-up of
the panel of men who will arbitrate on the row.
The tribunal will be chaired by Lord Ranald McLean, and also sitting
will be former Hearts director Jim Clydesdale and John Wilson, the
former Morton chairman.
Celtic have already been fined a record #100,000 by the Scottish
League, but they continue to claim innocence and do not accept that they
should have to pay Kilmarnock any compensation for the loss of Burns.

JAMES TRAYNORlooks at the spice of rivalry down South
WITHOUT intense rivalry, football wouldn't be the same ball game. It
would be a soft, anaemic sport devoid of excitement and passion, but so
long as Scots continue to have an influence on the British game, there
will be little possibility of losing widespread appeal.
Subtlety and beauty have been lost amid the industry of the premier
division, but in England, skills are to the fore, and at the very top
stand two Scots, Alex Ferguson and Kenny Dalglish.
It would not be unreasonable to assume these two might at least pass
the time of day, but the reality is that neither would manage more than
the slightest of nods to the other if they were to pass in a desert.
Diplomatic relations were probably broken off years ago, around the
time a Scottish squad was preparing to head into the 1986 World Cup
finals in Mexico. Alex Ferguson, who had taken over as manager after
Jock Stein's death in Wales the night Scotland qualified for the finals,
wanted to employ Dalglish's sublime skills and experience, but the
Liverpool player did not want to go to the finals.
Two years after having refused Ferguson, the pair disagreed as
managers of Manchester United and Liverpool at the end of a contentious
match. Ferguson was being interviewed in Anfield's corridors, and as he
walked past, Dalglish allegedly suggested the reporter talk to his baby
daughter. ''You'll get more sense out of her,'' he was quoted as saying.
The pair were at it again inside Old Trafford on Monday night after
Ferguson's side had beaten Dalglish's Blackburn Rovers.
United scored the game's only goal 10 minutes from time and Rovers
thought they had equalised in the closing seconds, but referee Paul
Durkin said Alan Shearer had fouled Roy Keane in setting up the
opportunity.
Blackburn are now only two points clear at the top of the premiership
and competing for the same coveted prize is hardly designed to end this
particular cold war. With Jack Walker's money to entice the best players
to Blackburn's Ewood Park, Dalglish and Ferguson are probably the only
two managers who can buy players for #5m and upwards, and that adds to
their rivalry.
It was like a victory for Rovers when Alan Shearer rejected United and
signed on, and when his striking partner, Chris Sutton, also choose
Blackburn, Dalglish had won again.
However, Roy Keane preferred United and Ferguson obviously believes
that with Andy Cole's arrival, the advantage again has swung in favour
of his side. ''Rivalry? Yes there is rivalry, but there are no grudges.
Life's too short,'' said Ferguson.
Very decent of him to say so, don't you think? It didn't last.
While rightly pointing out that the premiership is now the best
football environment in Europe in terms of excitement, skill, and
variety of styles Ferguson said Blackburn have qualities of toughness
and resilience. ''But we have great ability, and we will show our
trengths in the run in. They (Blackburn) had the chance at Old Trafford
to show they were championship material, but didn't take it.''
Ferguson was proving more than one point when he spent #6m and
sacrificed Keith Gillespie, one of the game's brightest young prospects,
to take Cole from Newcastle and believes time and events will vindicate
his decision to further fuel a market which had already reached levels
of insanity.
''This club needed an injection at the time,'' he explained. ''I had
to show the fans and the players that I wasn't complacent.
''Manchester United are a big club and the league is what they should
be winning. We are good enough to win it and now the players have to
show me they have the desire to do so.''

AFTER the visit of yet another rugby team to Murrayfield bolstered by
shoulder pads -- the South Africans had been similarly attired two
months ago -- the SRU revealed after Scotland's win over Canada that
they have written to the International Board requesting that the laws on
the use of shoulder pads be adhered to worldwide.
''The laws of rugby quite clearly state that they may be used to help
an individual who has shoulder trouble to play a game, and must be made
of a soft material sewn into the jersey,'' said SRU chief executive Bill
Hogg.
''However, we have been watching television footage from overseas, as
well as noting what teams have been wearing at Murrayfield, and that is
quite clearly not the case with the law being flouted by many countries.
If the laws are not to be enforced strictly, then we believe that
shoulder pads should be outlawed completely.''
Hogg said he was concerned that players from some countries might have
an advantage.
Gareth Rees, the Canadian captain who himself wore pads during the
game, said his team had not appeared to gain any advantage. ''Heck, all
they do for me is make me look in proportion, and they didn't help us
put in the big tackles at Murrayfield. They certainly make you look
bigger, and give you a bit of confidence.''
Rees confirmed that the shoulder pads were supplied by their centre,
Christian Stewart, who plays for Western Province in South Africa.
* MARTIN Scott, the Scottish international hooker who became the first
player to receive the red card in England when he was sent off two weeks
ago during Orrell's game against Leicester, is to play for his club
against Bath this Saturday after having had his suspension quashed.
Tony Spreadbury, the international referee from Somerset, dismissed
the Scot for allegedly diving in with both knees on to Oscar Wingham,
the Leicester flanker.
''I didn't go in with both knees,'' the player said. ''The video
clearly showed that.'' He claimed he went down only to pull Wingham off
the ball.

MAYBE he had begun to have misgivings about 1995, considering that he
has not yet played a serious match in the new year, but Mark Hateley,
the 1994 Player of the Year, is ready to resume normal service when he
turns out for Rangers in the club's opening Tennents Scottish Cup-tie
this Saturday against Hamilton at Firhill.
And despite his absence through injury since Boxing Day, Hateley has
not lost much ground in the scoring charts.
In fact, the 14-goal total he left standing before he was forced to
suspend action is still only two behind Motherwell's Tommy Coyne in the
premier division, and it would be reasonable to assume that he again
will chase the top spot.
Hateley had come back for the match with Hibs at Christmas after a
two-match absence because of injury, but he suffered a recurrence of the
groin injury and it looked as if he might need an operation. However,
the medical examination provided better news and after another month's
recuperation he is now set to come back.
Rangers assistant manager Archie Knox said that Ian Ferguson had done
a serviceable job in the front line but he, like every Rangers man, is
aware that Hateley and Gordon Durie, who is 90 per cent certain also to
return, will give the side a proper balance that has been missing.
The one link still out is Ally McCoist but he will need longer still
to reach a level of fitness that will allow him to make a first team
come-back.
* FORMER Scotland midfield player Jim Bett is set to sign another
short-term contract for Hearts, which could allow a further period of
change to take place at Tynecastle.
Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies has tabled a #150,000 bid for the former
Scotland midfield player Gary Mackay, but manager Tommy McLean will need
Bett himself before allowing that move.
There had been talk of Falkirk's Eddie May moving to Tynecastle in an
exchange deal, but Jefferies wants the experienced Mackay, 31 yesterday,
to link up with the former Hibernian player.

Picture: JAMES GALLOWAY
THE Docherty dream became a nightmare at the St Andrew's Sporting Club
in Glasgow last night when Michael Deveney, of Paisley, won the vacant
British featherweight championship on the closest of verdicts.
At the end of 12 rounds, which in the main were disappointing from two
such talented boxers, referee Dave Parris ruled that Wilson Docherty,
younger brother of British bantamweight champion Drew, had lost by
half-a-point -- 117[1/2]-117 -- thus depriving the Condorrat family of
two championship belts in the household.
Deveney was the underdog and had his finest hour in a professional
ring. ''Everyone underestimated me,'' he said. ''But knowing how good
Wilson was, I trained as never before for this one. I proved everyone
wrong and I dedicate the belt to my little daughter, Stacey.
''Now I just want to savour the feeling of being British champion
before thinking about my next move.''
The Docherty dressing room, in contrast, was steeped in gloom and
disbelief. ''How could I have lost that fight?'' asked Wilson. ''I even
held myself back in the last round because I thought I was a clear
winner. I only hope my manager can get me a quick rematch, and then
we'll see who the real champion is.''
Deveney becomes the first Scot to hold this particular title since
Ayrshire's Evan Amstrong more than 20 years ago, but opinion at the
ringside was sharply divided as to who should have got the verdict.
I thought Docherty had done enough to win by a narrow margin but
Deveney produced the performance of his career and never let the
Condorrat man settle. There were so many rounds so close to call, but
referee Parris had to call them one way or the other, and his decision
-- the only one that matters -- went to the Paisley man.
Docherty never got into his stride and was confined mainly to single
punches. Beforehand he had been quite confident that he would stop his
opponent but Deveney used the ring space wisely and made his opponent do
all the chasing.
An early rematch seems a fair course of action to me.
Other results:
Light-middle -- Billy Collins (Stirling) beat Eddie Haley (South
Shield) rsc fourth round.
Light -- Trevor George (Newcastle) outpointed Gary Burrell (Kirkcaldy)
over six rounds.
Fly -- Neil Parry (Middlesbrough) beat Ian Baillie (Corby) rsc third
round.
* ALI Forbes muscled his way to the vacant British super-middleweight
title at York Hall, Bethnal Green, last night.
The physical strength and sheer determination of outsider Forbes
overcame the slicker boxing of Fidal Castro-Smith to take the
championship by the smallest possible margin -- half-a-point.
It was far from being a boxing classic, but Forbes' total endeavour
won him the second half of the bout to take the verdict at the age of 33
-- but after just 13 contests.
The future for Smith does not look encouraging. This was his fifth
defeat in six contests, three of them in British title combat and, at
31, time is not on his side.
A victory would have brought Smith outright ownership of a Lonsdale
belt,
Forbes said: ''Fidal is a very good technical boxer, but I thought I'd
probably done it by a couple of rounds.''

Whether you are selling farm animals or fine art, there is more to
training to become an auctioneer than meets the eye, such as valuations,
surveying and the need to look after the vocal chords.
BAGS of personality, a strong voice and a firm hand are among the top
needs for auctioneers in Scotland.
Alongside the necessary attributes, training is to be re-jigged and
the Agricultural Training Board is now to be called the ATB Landbase.
Leading auctioneers are mainly members of the Institute of Auctioneers
and Appraisers in Scotland (IAAS), which has 145 full members, 102
associates and 64 students.
Membership centres around a number of stages which include:
Student Membership -- the normal educational standard for this is five
O Grade passes, or a comparable exam, i.e., Standard Grade passes at
levels, 3, 2, or 1. Three of the subjects must have been passed at the
same time, and include English language and maths.
Associate Membership: which involves passing a practical exam conductd
by the institute.
Fellow Membership: For this applicants must have satisfactorily
completed the institute's exams and be 23 or over.
Estate agency qualifications are also available to Fellows of the
Institute who have completed exams in certain additional subjects.
Exam subjects include a livestock section covering agriculture,
agricultural valuations, forestry, surveying, law of contract and sale
of goods, law of landlord and tenant, and elementary taxation and
accountancy.
While on the chattels side furniture, silver, ceramics, pictures are
included on the list.
Study can take over as much as seven years but many pupils coming
straight from school can get through the course in two to three years.
Muriel Gordon of the IAAS says that it depends very much on what is
meant by the term auctioneer. ''It is quite easy if you have the gift,
to stand up on a box and shout, but to be a Fellow of the Institute you
have to have a good all-round knowledge of contracts and sale law. You
can, however, be an auctioneer without belonging to the IAAS.
''But we are now in the throes of getting a scheme together where all
staff working in auctions will receive some form of training and
qualification,'' she adds.
But having got the qualifications, one drawback to becoming an
auctioneer is the fact that many lose their voices after two to three
years.
Gordon says: ''This isn't surprising because without the use of a
microphone many end up shouting to be heard, which does cause throat and
voice problems in the longer term.
''They must also be able to get on with people, have bags of
personality and be tough.''
At present the IAAS has only one woman member that has passed her
exams but the institute is now proving a popular option for many women,
with students now working throughout Scotland including some based at
Northern Mart in Aberdeen.
Primrose Dunbar, 26, the first fellow of the IAAS now works for United
Auctions in Stirling selling calves and pigs and thoroughly enjoys her
post.
She started by selling horse tackle and is now applying the spurs on a
fast track to a successful career in auctions.
She applied for a job as a junior on an apprenticeship scheme with
United Auctions after leaving school.
''It gave us the chance to visit all the markets in Stirling, Perth
and Oban for a six-month period. The scheme offered intitially trial
placements, then kept on one of the boys and myself.''
She found travelling round the markets as the only woman apprentice
interesting. ''I just did exactly the same as the boys including
handling the cattle side of the business.''
When she returned to Stirling she finished her exams and now sells
cows and pigs every Thursday.
But, surprisingly, it isn't always a gavel which closes the bidding on
items.
''Auctioneers prefer their own choice of dealing item, and it could be
anything from a shillelagh to the top of a shepherd's crook'' she says.

magazine Der Spiegel alleged by prosecutors to promote separatism.
Prosecutors, speaking to the Anatolian news agency, said they wanted
Kemal to be imprisoned for up to five years.

IAN Pitt-Watson was the son of the Very Rev Professor James
Pitt-Watson, a Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland, Queen's Chaplain, and also professor of practical theology at
Trinity College, Glasgow University.
Ian grew up in his father's manse in Alloa. He was educated at Dollar
Academy and Edinburgh University, where he gained a double first in
philosophy and moral philosophy. Later, at New College, he won a
distinction in systematic theology.
When I was inducted minister of St George's West, Edinburgh, in 1949,
Ian was appointed my first student assistant. From the beginning it was
obvious that he was endowed with exceptional ability. 0Licensed as a
probationer, he was appointed assistant to St Giles'. In 1952 he was
installed as chaplain of Aberdeen University and, in 1958, he was
inducted to the charge of St James, Forfar. He accepted a call to New
Kilpatrick in Bearsden in 1961, where he exercised such a successful
ministry that New Kilpatrick grew to be the largest congregation in
Scotland.
After 12 years there, he returned to Aberdeen as professor of
practical theology. In 1980 he was invited to become professor of
preaching and practical theology in Fuller Seminary, Pasadena,
California, from where he retired recently.
Ian's versatility was truly astonishing. While still an undergraduate,
he took the diploma of the Licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music, and
created a choir which developed into the Edinburgh University singers,
who celebrated their 50th anniversary this year.
He was, moreover, a hymn writer, contributing to the third edition of
the Church Hymnary. One of my favourite hymns is written by him --
''Those all before me Lord, those all behind.''
All this is true, but it was as a preacher that Ian made his greatest
impact. His reputation as a preacher was worldwide. Australia invited
him as the Turnbull Trust preacher three times. Speaking as one who was
a Turnbull Trust preacher, Ian is the only one who received a second and
third invitation.
Those of us who were fortunate to be his friends would unhesitatingly
describe him as a lovable person. Along with his formidable intellectual
ability, he was very human. Endowed with a huge sense of humour, and a
highly developed sense of the absurd and the incongruous, he was also a
superb mimic. I know because I was one of his favourite subjects. He
could do me better than I could do myself, with his mastery of
Gaelic-flavoured Hebridean accent.
Ian's death will be mourned by many who knew him and came under his
influence. I am sure I am speaking for them all when I say we extend our
sympathy to his family, Maggie, Rosemary, and David.
The Rev Professor Murdo Ewan Macdonald

THE workforce of a Scottish engineering company is to be cut as a
direct result of financial problems being faced by a US airline.
Aviall Caledonian engine services, based at Prestwick, is to shed 40
of its 890 workers because of sudden cost reductions by the airline.
While Aviall was remaining coy about the identity of the client for
reasons of commercial sensitivity, The Herald has learned that it is
US-based Continental Airlines which has cut work for the Ayrshire
company.
Continental, in common with other US airlines, is having trouble
coming out of the worst recession in aviation history and is undergoing
its second restructuring programme. This has involved cuts in routes as
well as the grounding of certain aircraft, which means less engine
overhaul and maintenance work for Aviall.
Last year, US-owned Aviall Caledonian enjoyed an increase in orders,
including the first from the lucrative Far East market and, despite
cutting some management jobs, recorded a net increase in the workforce.
Now the axe is to fall on a number of skilled workers and their
colleagues in office administration. Discussions including counselling
and support for those who are to leave will begin at once.
Mr Stephen Henderson, managing director of the company, said: ''In
pure economic terms we could have cut more workers, but there is a
determination in the company that when the situation improves we will be
ready with the core skills to meet the new demands.
''It is obviously a matter of great regret that we have to reduce the
workforce, but it is a necessary step in order to protect the jobs of
our remaining 850 employees.
''We will continue to work hard in marketing Aviall Caledonian
throughout the world, thus obtaining new contracts to add to those
already won during 1994. Every effort is being made to accelerate this
process.''
Mr Henderson has communicated personally with all employees, outlining
the company's position and stating his intention to ''base the criteria
for redundancy on the value that each person has added to the company's
performance''.
Aviall, previously Caledonian Airmotive, has operated on its Prestwick
site since 1979, overhauling jet engines for the world's airlines. This
is the first time it had been forced to reduce the workforce.

FURTHER evidence emerged yesterday that Britain is consolidating its
role as the ''sweatshop of Europe'' and extending working hours that are
already the longest in the European Union.
Data produced by Eurostat, the European Commission's statistical
office in Luxembourg, shows that, on average, men in the UK work 45.1
hours a week, compared to a European average of 41.1 hours, and women
work 40.2 hours a week as against an EU average of 38.7.
The UK is also shown to be the only country in the European Union
where the working week for all employees is increasing -- by one hour
between 1983 and 1992.
Commenting on the Eurostat figures, Shadow Employment Minister Ian
McCartney said that Britain was clearly the sweatshop of Europe, with
British men working on average four hours longer than those elsewhere in
Europe, and British women working at least one-and-a-half hours more
than those in any other European country.
He said: ''Yet again, Tory economic incompetance means British people
have the worst deal in Europe. People in full-time employment have to
work longer, and those in part-time work are having to take two or more
jobs just to make ends meet.''
These figures showed the true face of Tory Britain -- big fat rises
for top executives, and low pay and long hours for everyone else, he
added.
The TUC's general secretary, Mr John Monks, described the report as
shocking. He blamed the Government's seven-year opt-out from the EU
working time directive, and called for it to be implemented as soon as
possible.
Until then, he said, British employers woud be able to squeeze the
most they could out of their workforce, while in many cases also trying
to freeze or cut their workers' pay.

DEFENCE Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was yesterday urged to investigate
claims that two atomic bombs are buried in a 30ft deep concrete-lined
''coffin'' said to lie beneath a country park visited by more than
300,000 people a year.
The claim comes from Mrs Heather Sidrak, daughter of a former worker
at a Royal Ordnance Factory on the outskirts of Llanelli, South Wales.
She said her father, Harry Southall, worked at the factory from 1946
until it closed in 1965.
Shortly before he died at the age of 81, Mrs Sidrak said he told her
that he was part of a team ordered to bury the bombs in the 1950s.
The retired teacher said yesterday: ''I believe what my father told
me. He was the most truthful man I have ever known. He said that he
attended meetings where those present included the factory's chief
scientist, and they were told that two atomic bombs had to be disposed
of.''
The Llanelli Labour MP, Mr Denzil Davies, said: ''I am demanding an
urgent meeting with Mr Rifkind.''
The factory buildings were dismantled and the 600-acre area was
eventually converted into a country park.

Strasbourg, Monday
COUNT Nikolai Tolstoy took his appeal against a British libel case
ruling to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg today arguing
that the finding against him was unfair and the #1.5m fine was
excessive.
Count Tolstoy, a distant relative of Russia's War and Peace author Leo
Tolstoy, became embroiled in the action after he wrote pamphlet accusing
Lord Aldington of war crimes after the Second World War.
In November 1989, the High Court found that his allegation -- that
Lord Aldington handed 70,000 PoWs and Cossack and Yugoslav refugees to
the then-Soviet Red Army and to partisans of Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito
in June 1945 -- constituted a serious libel.
Count Tolstoy lost his bid to overturn the libel damages award on
appeal in May 1992, prompting his move to the Strasbourg court.
Lord Aldington, who is now chairman of the governors of Winchester
College School, was the chief of staff of the British Fifth Corps in
Austria in the summer of 1945.
Count Tolstoy, a British national, argued in his complaint to the
rights court that the British court was wrong to reject his plea that he
could not afford a deposit of #124,900 toward Lord Aldington's legal
costs.
Count Tolstoy also alleged that the British court violated his right
to freedom of expression and that the fine was excessive.
In an interview, Tolstoy said he felt he could not get a fair trial in
Britain because of official hostility to his argument.
''I feel here in an international court, our chances of justice are
very great,'' he told Reuters.
The European Commission of Human Rights, which makes preliminary
studies of potential cases for the Court, upheld Count Tolstoy's claim
that the fine was excessive but rejected his plea that the trial was
unfair.
The court, which is expected to make a final ruling in a year's time,
is under no obligation to follow the Commission's recommendation.
Its ruling is binding on states and the judges may demand that Britain
pay damages to the plaintiff.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
A PARTNER in a firm of surveyors embezzled #103,000 from the company.
David Brydon, 38, admitted taking the money from Peter Shearer
Surveyors, of Rutland Street and Blackford Avenue, Edinburgh.
Depute-fiscal Brian Robertson told Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday
that Brydon sold his company Porsche and put the #19,000 he got for it
back into the firm in a bid to cover his tracks.
But, as it was a company car, the firm kept paying for it until it
found out that it had been sold.
Brydon, of Hainburn Park, Edinburgh, became a partner in the firm in
1988.
He was solely concerned with the accounting side of the business, and
took advantage of this by transferring money from the firm's business
accounts and client accounts into his own, involving more than 175
transactions over four years.
There is still a shortfall of #65,000, and Mr Robertson said that
there was no explanation for where the money had gone other than on
''high living''.
As well as selling the Porsche, Brydon put #5000 of his own money back
into the firm in a bid to cover up his activities.
Clients of Peter Shearer Surveyors which lost out included Eastern
Scottish (#35,000) and Pentland Garage (#8600).
Brydon's former partner also had to use #5000 of his own money to
settle with clients.
Brydon, who is married, is now working as a salesman, said Mr
Robertson.
Sheriff Martin Mitchell deferred sentence until February 13 for
background reports.

<HEADLINE>Former fisherman to sue Lang for #1m over loss of livelihood</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>980205717</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FORMER fisherman Nigel Johnston is preparing to go to court seeking
#1m from Scottish Secretary Ian Lang for the loss of his livelihood.
In March 1991 police confiscated the nets on Mr Johnston's 40ft boat,
Moyallon, whichhe used to fish for turbot and skate west of the
Hebrides.
Mr Johnston, who lives with wife Fiona, his sole crew, and their young
daughter at Arisaig, south of Mallaig, said: ''We were using the nets
for large fish outside the six-mile limit west of the Hebrides.
''But we were prosecuted because it's even illegal to have any
monofilament nets, of whatever mesh size, as they claim they could catch
salmon.
''That is absolute nonsense. The 12in mesh is just too big.'' Salmon
gill nets normally have a five-inch mesh.
Mr Johnston is particularly angry that Spanish vessels can use the
same type of nets without any legal hindrance.
He claimed: ''Although the Spaniards' quota is 1.5 tonnes a month, we
know of one boat that landed 100 tonnes recently.'' He also claims the
Spanish take #50m worth of fish from the Rockall area and UK boats
cannot even get a share.
''We will say that this order is contrary to European law,'' he said.
Despite backing from the Atlantic Salmon Trust, whose patron is Prince
Charles and which was responsible for the monofilament ban, the Scottish
Office refuses to recognise the Johnstons' case.
Its refusal is also despite acceptance at a sheriff court and a High
Court heard that the nets could not catch the protected species.
With help from the Mallaig and North-west Fishermen's Association, Mr
Johnston hopes for a judicial review to look at the law.
Backing has already come from Highland Regional Council and Lochaber
District Council, among others.
Mr Johnston and supporters from around the north and west coast have
offered to prove to fishery officers that the law totally banning
monofilament is unreasonable.
Last month the Johnstons had to face financial reality and sell the
Moyallon.
But Mr Johnston, an architect by training, has no intention of giving
up and has been gathering backing.
To replace the boat would cost #300,000 and loss of earnings and legal
fees could top the million mark.
His solicitor, Dumfries-based Matthew Pumphrey, drew up a draft claim
and presented it to the Scottish Office with a deadline of November 25.
Mr Johnston said: ''They just ignored us. So now we hope to lodge the
writ with the Court of Session soon. We want a judicial review. The law
is wrong.''
Mr Hugh Allan, secretary of Mallaig and North-west Fishermen's
Association, said: ''We were against this law from the beginning. It
works against Scottish fishermen and has ruined this couple's
livelihood.''

THE referee who was branded a disgrace by Blackburn manager Kenny
Dalglish after he disallowed a goal late in their Premiership showdown
at Manchester United stood by his decision yesterday.
Portland's Paul Durkin ruled that striker Alan Shearer had committed a
foul moments before team-mate Tim Sherwood headed home in 87 minutes,
robbing Rovers of a 1-1 draw.
After having watched television replays of the incident, Dalglish
slammed the decision, claiming it could cost Blackburn the title.
But Durkin hit back: ''I know I was right. Alan Shearer pushed Roy
Keane before the ball was placed into the net. I have to be very
careful, but at the end of the day I gave what I saw and I stand by it.
''Kenny Dalglish had a go at me but I was not going to get involved in
a slanging match with anyone over this.''
Dalglish seems likely to escape an FA rap over his comments. FA
spokesman Mike Parry said: ''We haven't received the referee's report of
the match yet, but nobody has complained about what Kenny Dalglish
said.''
THE SFA's plans to introduce small-sided matches into schools football
are meeting with growing disapproval in playgrounds.
Schools football leaders insist the development initiatives have not
been properly thought out, and warn that football at school level could
be killed off.
Baxter Cavan, secretary of Glasgow East Schools FA, claimed: ''The SFA
are in danger of killing schools football. My association held an EGM
last week, and out of 32 schools only four would be prepared to continue
if the new rules are introduced.''
The SFA's blueprint for the future of youth football includes the
widespread introduction of seven-a-sides, restricting the playing season
from mid-April to mid-October, and a requirement that anyone running a
team must have an SFA coaching certificate.
Cavan said this is all unrealistic and added: ''Seven-a-side football
requires special goalposts which cost about #500. Where on earth do the
SFA think primary schools can find that sort of money?''
The schools are entitled to be worried about the cost of goal sets,
and the SFA really must donate them or at least offer substantial
discounts.
Cavan will write to the SFA pointing out his fears and he asks: ''If
there is no school football, where will the game find the players of the
future?''
SFA children's programme director Jim Sinclair said: ''The development
plan is a recommendation only. No-one at the SFA has said these
proposals will become law.
''In fact, I'm surprised at all the confusion because the Scottish
Schools FA is represented on the Youth Committee which drew up the
plan.''

The Archbishop of York has been advocating a reduction in the
frequency of religious observance in English and Welsh schools. Needless
to say, he was quickly rebuffed by the unholy alliance of the Archbishop
of Canterbury and the Government, but there is surely some validity in
his argument that quality is preferable to quantity. What's the position
in Scotland?
The relevant legislation in England is the 1944 Education Act, which
requires schools to conduct a daily act of worship, though research by
Inspectors of Schools suggests that the legal requirement is being
ignored in many places. The Archbishop of York, Dr John Habgood, takes
the view that ''the system is not working'' and that ''poor school
worship has an anti-religious effect''. He has expressed sympathy with
teachers who are not believers and feel hypocritical about conducting
assemblies.
In Scottish schools, religious observance -- as opposed to religious
education, which is a curricular subject -- is obligatory under the
Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Parents have the right to withdraw their
children if they wish and should be informed of this right. Religious
observance is seen by the Scottish Office Education Department as
complementing religious education and making ''an important contribution
to pupils' spiritual development''.
Though the term ''religious observance'' is usually taken to mean
assemblies during which worship takes place, it can also mean
hymn-singing, Bible reading and prayer or presentations on a moral or
spiritual issue. In Roman Catholic schools, it also covers school masses
and sacramental preparation, while in schools serving multi-faith
communities it can involve the celebration of such festivals as Diwali
and Eid. A school chaplain is seen as having a valuable contribution to
offer in all these areas and also in pastoral duties with staff and
pupils.
Interestingly, while the SOED stresses that regularity of religious
observance ''is necessary to ensure an impact on pupils' experience,''
it also maintains that ''the quality of such occasions is of paramount
importance''. It advises that, in primary schools, all pupils should
take part in religious observance ''not less than once a week,'' in
secondary schools ''at least once a month and preferably with greater
frequency''.
I read recently that the flow of schools in England seeking to opt out
of local authority control has dried up. Is this so and, if so, why?
If it has not dried up, it has certainly been reduced to a trickle.
Just over 1000 schools now have grant-maintained status -- a fraction of
the Government's predicted figure.
There are a number of reasons. Firstly, while some opted-out schools
proclaim grant-maintained status (GMS) a great success, others face
financial difficulty or cannot find governors willing to take on the
heavy personal responsibilities.
Secondly, most of the schools embracing GMS were either threatened
with closure or located in Tory areas like Essex or Kent where councils
actively promoted the policy. Tory influence, even in the South-West, is
now somewhat more fragile. In addition, the growing public distaste for
quangos is having an effect on other initiatives which are perceived to
reflect political dogma.
Thirdly, fear of the unknown -- in this case, local government reform
-- was a motivating factor for some schools which were considering the
possibility of adopting GMS. In the event, the report of the Banham
Commission advocates a much less radical reform of local government than
in Scotland and is highly unlikely to propel more schools in the
direction of GMS.
Indeed, some of the existing counties will survive and many of the new
unitary authorities which are proposed will be the size of cities like
Portsmouth and will thus be able to provide services like special
educational needs and transport. There is therefore no incentive to
pursue GMS because of concern over the viability of local authorities.
You have written twice recently about the need to put exam results in
a ''value-added'' context. You describe this as very difficult. Why?
Let's begin with an illustration. The Audit Commission, in a report
called ''Unfinished Business'', looked at 28 schools and applied its own
value-added scale. The school with the top exam results suddenly came
thirteenth, while two schools in the bottom half were upgraded to first
and third. While this demonstrates the need for a value-added (VA)
approach, the fact remains that any other scale than that used by the
Audit Commission would have produced a different outcome.
A VA system has to offer positive messages. There is clear research
evidence, for instance, of a correlation between the incidence of free
school meals and the quality of exam results. However, parents will not
thank you for telling them that their children are performing badly
because they are poor. They will demand not only explanations but
solutions.
It is not difficult to identify factors which need to be built into a
VA framework (for example the social context of the school, the
composition of the household, the education of the parents, the level of
expectations). What is difficult is to quantify the influence of each
one and to weight them one against another.
It seems to me that any VA model finally adopted by the Scottish
Office will have to be based on prior achievement -- in other words, the
level of learning which children have attained as they enter secondary
school will be compared with Standard Grade results. This approach has
the advantage that factors like social deprivation are built in all
along the way. However, learning achievement at age 12 -- measured by
the levels of the 5-14 Programme -- is within broad bands and only gives
a general indication of progress.
It will be even more difficult to define the VA element in primary
schools, where all levels of learning are broad-banded and, in addition,
many primaries have too small rolls for statistically valid conclusions
to be drawn.
I believe that an acceptable VA framework can be devised. Because it
cannot be precise, it should never be used to create value-added league
tables. Schools and parents should also be urged to apply it over a
three-year period, rather than draw possibly misleading conclusions from
one year's experience.

Sarajevo, Monday
UNITED Nations Bosnia commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose,
ended his assignment today by announcing the opening of supply routes
into Sarajevo, bolstering a truce and an international bid for new talks
to end the bloody three-year war.
Rose announced the deal as big power peace envoys, hoping to
capitalise on the truce, embarked on fresh talks with rival factions to
persuade them to join new discussions on a political settlement in
Bosnia.
The new accord between the Muslim-led Bosnian government and Bosnian
Serbs who surround the capital allowed Lt-Gen Rose to go out on a high
note after a difficult year as chief UN peacekeeper in the war-scarred
republic.
The accord would open supply roads, called ''blue routes'', in and out
of the city on February 1 for all international relief agencies, four
Bosnian charities and civilian traffic.
''I have just heard now that both sides have signed up a very
extensive agreement not only for the opening for the Blue Routes but for
many other issues as well,'' he told reporters on leaving for Croatia
where he will hand over command to fellow Briton Lieutenant-General
Rupert Smith.
Referring to a prisoner exchange on Friday and a Serb-Muslim accord to
exchange liaison officers, he added: ''It is all pointing to the fact
that both sides see this opportunity as a very real opportunity for
peace.''
The UN considered the opening of the roads as key to a four-month
ceasefire agreement which went into effect on January 1. Despite
occasional violations, the truce appears, so far, to be the most
effective in 33 months of fighting.
''I think the fact that the cessation of hostilities has lasted as
well as it has shows a very serious intent by both parties to bring
about an end to this war and return their people to proper normalised
living as any European country should do,'' Rose told reporters.
The UN said Bosnia was generally quiet today with only scattered
shooting incidents in Sarajevo, the mainly Muslim Bihac pocket in the
northwest and Ribnica, near the main road between Sarajevo and Tuzla in
the northeast.--Reuter.

THE rights of elderly, blind, and disabled gas customers will have to
be protected under new provisions aimed at increasing competition, the
Government ruled yesterday.
The policy declaration came unexpectedly hours after Labour leaked a
British Gas memo suggesting that the company was preparing cuts in its
#30m-a-year service for vulnerable customers.
Energy Minister Tim Eggar said the competition Bill, to be published
next month, would require all suppliers to offer special treatment,
including home visits for the elderly, blind, and disabled.
In a statement he said: ''I am absolutely determined that all
suppliers of gas will have to offer special services for elderly,
disabled, or blind persons. This was made clear in the consultation
document issued in May 1994.''
On BBC Radio later, however, he refused to guarantee that the services
would continue at the current level offered by British Gas. ''Whether
the precise same terms are followed as British Gas chooses to follow at
the present time is a matter that will have to be carefully examined.''
His statement ruling out any changes in special services pre-empted a
news conference by Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, Mr Nigel
Griffiths, at which he distributed the British Gas document and hailed
''a substantial victory for Labour''.
He said: ''They show massive cuts in services for a million blind,
elderly, disabled and arthritic customers.'' He claimed that although it
was only a discussion paper, some proposals were already being carried
out, notably in Scotland, where home service advisers had been cut from
10 to four.
The leaked report, prepared by British Gas's public gas supply
business unit, says the company could ''reduce the current commitment to
our older or disabled customers, with a view to meeting the minimum
requirements of the Regulator''.
Under the company's GasCare register, one million customers with
special needs receive free home visits to fit equipment such as braille
controls and time-clocks for the blind.
The report, presented last week to a seminar for home service staff in
Birmingham, suggests some free services could be dropped and home visits
might become liable to a #25 charge.
British Gas claimed no changes were planned, but said the company
would face stiff competition once the gas supply market was opened up to
other providers. A spokeswoman said: ''We have no plans to charge for
any of these services, which comprise just a small part of our home
service advisers' work.''
Mr Jim Waller, regional gas officer with Unison, said: ''Mr Eggar has
not said what services the companies will be required to provide, and
whether they will be able to charge for the services that British Gas
now provides for free.''
Ms Barbara Harvey, head of the public interest research group at the
Consumers' Association, said: ''British Gas shouldn't be allowed to
reduce standards at all. It is also vital for current standards to apply
to any new gas supply companies that start operating. If anything, there
should be an upgrading, not a downgrading, in the standards of service
provided.''
The changes being considered by British Gas are set out in five
documents released by Mr Griffiths. The critical one, based on a British
Gas visit to the US last September, states: ''Do less, but maximise
every opportunity for media coverage -- make it sound more.''
Proposals contained in the document include:
* A possible #25 call-out charge for general advice to elderly and
disabled people.
* Cutting home visits ''to the absolute minimum, authorised only''.
* Cutting the Home Advisory Staff from 136 to 78, with plans to scrap
the service in three years.
* Review the provision of handles and adaptors for gas appliances for
the disabled, on the grounds that manufacturers should be responsible
for them.
* Scrap the automatic three-year gas safety check for elderly and
disabled.

DOUGLAS LOWE looks at a Scot making a fair trade with some old tyme
swingers.
BIGGER, more powerful and macho are the requirements of golf clubs
coming on to the modern market, and Colin Montgomerie helped the cause
last week by claiming he could hit the ball further than ever with his
Big Bertha clubs.
However, as courses stretch ever more beyond the 7000-yard mark to
accommodate the effects of these mighty weapons, it is interesting to
note that one manufacturer at least is bucking the trend.
Among clubs bearing the trade marks Big Bang, Ballistic, Whopper,
Blitz, and Wild Thing on display at the Scottish Golf Trade Fair at
Ingliston earlier this month was a lone exhibitor selling a nice line in
hickories.
Yes, the mashie-niblick, the baffie and their cohort, the guttie ball,
are back in business, and therein hangs a tale.
The demand for this hitherto obsolete equipment can be traced to the
Oakhurst Links club in West Virginia, where the nine-hole course which
dates back to 1880 and was abandoned in 1909, has been restored as
nearly as possible as it was.
Use of equipment of that era is compulsory and that is not entirely as
nutty an idea as it might at first seem. Measuring just 1995 yards and
with only one hole more than 300, modern clubs and balls would, after
all, make a mockery of this time-warp zone .
Enter Bill Duff, a Scot now running a golf accessory company in
Washington, who visited the Golf Classics stand at last year's Open
Championship at Turnberry.
Aware of the needs of the soon-to-open Oakhurst, he asked the St
Andrews-based company, who were already making replicas which are
exported to 22 countries, if they could produce the goods for real
action.
Yes they could, and with Duff acting as an intermediary, an order for
25 sets of clubs, each comprising a long-headed play club (driver),
baffie (No.3 wood), mid-iron, mashie-niblick (pitching club), and wooden
putter, plus 120 gutta percha balls was placed.
Millar Low, the managing director, explained: ''We already had the
expertise to make the clubs. The heads of the wooden clubs are made of
beech with horn fitted to the leading edge. These are scared (spliced)
on to the hickory shafts, the wood for which is imported from Tennessee,
and the grips are made of leather. But the balls did give us a
problem.''
Gutties were made from the sap of gum trees, and Low's inquiries
throughout the rubber industry brought the unvarying response that,
short of arranging himself for it to be squeezed out of the trees, this
material is no longer available.
However, a rubber mix with properties similar to gutta percha and used
for interiors of modern solid balls, was obtained. To all intents and
purposes it effectively is the real thing, and they are made one at a
time from an original mould.
''We experimented quite a bit,'' continued Low. ''It is all a question
of heat and pressure and the first ones were not very durable.
Eventually we got it right though, and the word we have had back from
Oakhurst is that they are very pleased with them.''
This Scottish connection with Oakhurst is a happy sequel to the
beginning. Scotsman George Grant had it built for his golfing nephew
Lionel Torrin.
The land is now owned by property developer Lewis Keller, and it was
the legendary Sam Snead, who is attached to the nearby Greenbrier
resort, who alerted him of its golfing history as one of the oldest
courses in America.
The course is contained in 35 acres, about half the needs of a modern
nine-holer, and, who knows, the idea might catch on wherever space is at
a premium.
FACTFILE
* GUTTA percha balls were in vogue from 1848 to 1901, about the same
period as the reign of Queen Victoria.
* THE discovery was credited to William Montgomerie, surgeon to the
East India Company in Malaya. Local gum tree sap was malleable when
immersed in hot water and was used to make handles for daggers.
Montgomerie moulded it into a sphere and, hey presto, he had a golf ball
which consigned expensive featheries, leather covered balls filled with
feathers, to history.
* THE first gutties were smooth and erratic in flight until they
became chipped. So the era of dimpled balls began and aerodynamic
designs are still evolving.
* THE Haskell ball, otherwise known as the Bounding Billy, was
invented by American Coburn Haskell and it spelled the end for the
guttie.
* THIN rubber strips were wound under tension around an elastic core
of the Bounding Billie which is the predecessor of the modern ball.
* UNLIKE the guttie, this new ball bounded along even when poorly
struck and those who first used them were called bounders, a term which
has gone into general usage to describe a person of questionable
morality.
* WALTER Travis was the first celebrated bounder. In 1901, he used the
Haskell to win the US Amateur.
* JAMES Braid, of Scotland, won the first of his five Open
Championships using the guttie. That was in 1901 at Muirfield. He won
his other four between 1905 and 1910 with Bounding Billies.
* MODERN golfing skills are different from those of a century ago as
Jack Nicklaus discovered in 1978. He attempted to play a hole on the Old
Course at St Andrews with hickory and gutty. The man at the peak of his
powers could not get the ball airborne.
* THE role of the hands is considered the main change. Formerly they
had to be used near impact to compensate for torque or twisting of the
hickory shaft, a phenomenon virtually eliminated by modern equipment.
* LONG-headed play clubs with concave faces were superseded by bulger
drivers which arrived in 1885. They had a short, round heads with convex
faces, reducing the degree of slice or hook if the ball was struck off
the heel or toe.

WEST Ham found the cards stacked against them as they lost 2-0 in a
stormy Upton Park clash against Sheffield Wednesday last night.
Referee Paul Danson dealt out cards with the dexterity of a casino
banker as well as sending off Alvin Martin and Tim Breacker.
The Leicester official also handed out five cautions, yet missed
several late second-half challenges by John Moncur that might have
brought a red to go with an earlier yellow.
Danson sent off veteran former England central defender Martin in the
ninth minute for cutting down Mark Bright.
Kevin Pressman, recalled after suspension for Chris Woods, sent a
clearance direct to Bright who slipped past Martin as the big defender
lost his footing. The toppling Martin flung himself at Bright's legs to
up-end his opponent rugby-style.
Although the offence occurred a yard inside the Wednesday half, Mr
Danson plucked out the red card for a professional foul.
Moncur, Hyde, Pearce and Ingesson were booked before Breacker, 17
minutes before the end, leapt into a rash challenge on Hyde after having
previously collected a caution. He could not really complain.
The many unwise challenges obscured the football Wednesday produced as
they moved into seventh place.
Chris Waddle was the architect, taking advantage of a back-peddling
Kenny Brown to curl his shot around Ludek Miklosko and into the corner
via the bar after 32 minutes.
Wednesday made heavy weather of securing their win, until Ian Nolan's
cross bounced free from a defender after 83 minutes, and the ball landed
at the feet of Bright who tapped into an open goal.

AS the PGA European Tour caravan was about to move on from Dubai to
Manila someone looked at a fourth-round leader board which bore greater
resemblance to a major championship equivalent than to what was, when
all was said and done, a routine tournament and posed a slightly awkward
question.
In the hearing of the tour's executive director Ken Schofield, he
asked: ''Why is it not like this every week?'' ''Because,'' another
listener interjected, ''other sponsors can't afford it, that's why.''
Thus the perennially vexed subject of inducements to play in this event
or that rose again.
There must be some sympathy with the rank-and-file professionals' view
that whereas no increase in prize-money for the Dubai Desert Classic was
forthcoming and travel and hotel costs had risen from last year, huge
sums of money had been spent to guarantee the appearance of six of the
world's leading players.
Whatever Price, Norman, Els, Langer, Couples, and Montgomerie
received, rumour did nothing to diminish. Norman's fee was put about at
being $350,000 and, it was said, Price's consideration included the
refuelling of his private jet aircraft. How the other half lives.
Unfortunately for the other ranks, the outcome of the tournament
confirmed that the best players invariably perform at their best when
they are competing directly against one another. That is what
spectators, the media, and, above all, the sponsors want -- not, of
course, that it always happens.
But last week was a justification for the idea of a world tour, on
which the leading players would more often go head to head. Then greater
authority and authenticity would be brought to deciding who are the
world's best professionals than the current arbitrary system can devise.
The European Tour's problem is that, as Colin Montgomerie observed,
the season's start is almost too good for its own good. ''The weather
and the courses in the Gulf and Asia are excellent,'' he pointed out,
''and all the players are treated well, so the next few weeks are an
anti-climax with the big names away most, if not all, of the time.''
As confirmation of that, Montgomerie, after he has played in the
Johnnie Walker Classic, will have a week's holiday with his wife in
Barbados and then spend the three other weeks of February at home,
practising and playing on the variety of good courses near his Surrey
home.
After that break Montgomerie will play in four tournaments in Florida
in preparation for the Masters but he is very mindful that, with Nick
Faldo opting to play more often in America than Europe, ''it's important
that none of our leading players misses out on the Ryder Cup team on
merit because Faldo will be picked and that leaves the captain with only
one other choice''.
Fred Couples is rapidly becoming the chief beneficiary of the
unofficial or post-season black economy -- $580,000 for four first
places in three weeks last November alone (the World Cup team and
individual competitions accounting for two) and almost $1m when others
are taken into account.
Not that Couples was suggesting that his first European Tour victory,
in Dubai, fell into that category and if there was some encouragement to
be taken from an otherwise modest performance by the host tour's native
members -- 10 in the first 21 -- a leavening of youth hinted at
interesting times ahead.
Raymond Burns, aged 22, and another member of the 1993 Walker Cup
team, Stuart Cage, who is 21, were in that leading group, as was the
25-year-old New Zealander Michael Campbell, like them a graduate to the
regular tour from the 1994 Challenge Tour order of merit.

ENGLAND are clinging to the hope that Graeme Hick will not add to
their injury nightmare.
Hick, troubled by sciatica all tour, has spent most of the last 48
hours flat on his back after having scored a century against Victoria.
And he admitted yesterday: ''If my back feels like it does now in two
days' time, I would have to consider very seriously whether I could get
through a Test match. It's as bad at the moment as it has been all
tour.''
Publicly, England are confident their in-form No.3 will be fit to face
Australia at Adelaide Oval for the fourth Test on Thursday.
But if he isn't, they could be forced to use stand-by wicketkeeper
Jack Russell as a specialist batsman, or bring in someone else -- like
all-rounder Chris Lewis or even Allan Lamb, over to commentate for Sky
Television for the fourth Test.
With Hick, Alec Stewart (finger) and Neil Fairbrother (shoulder) all
casualties, England have only five fit batsman.
The best news for Atherton was that Graham Gooch scored 48 yesterday
to suggest his recent run of bad form could be coming to an end.
Even so, England were slammed for failing to chase a victory target of
252 off 55 overs against Victoria. They had reached 139 for one when a
draw was agreed early.
''I thought it was bloody disgraceful,'' said Victoria captain and
former Australian Test batsman Dean Jones when asked to comment on the
tourists' approach.
Meanwhile Australia have called up leg-spinner Peter to partner Shane
Warne. Team (from):
Taylor, Slater, Boon, M Waugh, Blewett, S Waugh, Healy, Warne,
McDermott, McIntyre, Fleming, McGrath.

Kobe, Monday
THE devastated Japanese port of Kobe was rattled by aftershocks today,
but fought on to recover from an earthquake that has killed over 5000
people and shook the foundations of the country's economy.
Schools reopened and roads were jammed with returning workers as the
western city began to recover from last Tuesday's quake.
But three sharp aftershocks, at 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5 on the Richter scale,
shook the battered city, causing buildings to sway and raising fears
more damaged buildings could collapse.
''It was very frightening,'' said a middle-aged woman at a makeshift
refugee centre. ''The building next door started shaking back and
forth.''
The latest police figures put the dead at 5002, with 26,253 people
injured and Kobe's mayor estimated damages would exceed 10 trillion yen
(#6.45 billion) from the quake which measured 7.2 on the open-ended
Richter scale.
The head of the government's relief effort said the economic toll
would be ''huge'', nervous selling drove down prices on the Tokyo Stock
exchange by more than 5% and a senior central bank official predicted
the quake would harm an economy only now emerging from recession.
''This earthquake will have major negative effects on Japan's economic
expansion for quite a long time,'' Tadayo Homma, the Bank of Japan
branch manager in nearby Osaka, told a news conference in Tokyo. But he
said the bank saw no immediate threat of a financial crisis.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama came under steady fire for his
government's handling of the relief effort, prompting US ambassador
Walter Mondale to spring to his defence, saying any government would
have had trouble coping.
The United States, Britain and other nations sent supplies, experts
and technical help to a nation which is the world's biggest aid donor
and which still seems in a state of shock at the scale of the disaster.
There were tearful scenes as schools reopened and children learned of
the death of classmates in the disaster.
Most commuter trains were operating again and the return to work posed
new problems for rescue workers as roads became jammed, slowing
emergency vehicles. It was taking supplies six hours to reach Kobe from
Osaka.
Electric power was restored by late today to most surviving homes.
Water supplies had been restored to about 40% of Kobe, officials said.
Hospitals worried over severe shortages of basic medicines. Doctors
said the number of refugees suffering from illness had risen sharply and
that an influenza epidemic might be imminent.
''Crammed and damaged supply lines are making it very difficult for
hospitals to get hold of adequate medical supplies,'' said Shoji
Nishiyama, deputy head of the Kobe Rehabilitation Hospital.
Shortages were so bad that hospital staff around the city were sifting
through the rubble of hospitals destroyed in the quake in hopes of
finding undamaged supplies, he said.
Nishiyama said shortages were not yet threatening people's lives, but
filthy conditions in refugee camps and the cold could soon trigger
epidemics.
In one refugee camp, 30 of the 250 people were already ill. ''There's
a much greater likelihood of a rapid spread of disease in refugee camps
where people are living on top of one another,'' Nishiyama said.
Small shops in Kobe opened and were doing brisk business.
The wife of a liquor store owner said that they were doing steady
trade since yesterday as her family slowly cleared up their shop which
was covered in broken glass by the quake.--Reuter.

RAIN stopped play between Partick Thistle and Dundee United yesterday
afternoon, 27 hours before kick-off time, but maybe the referee did
everyone a favour when he postponed the rearranged league match because
of waterlogging.
According to the SFA crime count, referee Michael McCurrie has at
least managed to delay the confrontation between the premier division's
two worst disciplined teams.
Thistle and United are among seven senior clubs who have been sent
warnings to clean up their acts or face sanctions.
Up to December 3, Thistle had six men sent off and 29 booked. Not far
behind are United, with three sent off and 38 cautioned. Only Falkirk
(five and 33) are close to them.
Also receiving SFA warnings are Stranraer are Ayr from the first
division, Queen of the South from the second, and Forfar and Albion
Rovers from the basement. Forfar, top of the third division, are the
only team out of the seven who are not battling against relegation.
The overall figures show a marked increase of cautions for the period
to December this season compared with 1994-95, with red cards up from 70
to 98 and yellows from 986 to 1177.
The most severe discipline handed out for misbehaviour was the #10,000
fine imposed on Airdrie after the '92-93 season, which they finished
with nine sendings off and 100 bookings.
The Thistle-United game was rescheduled for February 1, cup-ties
permitting. Meanwhile, both teams will have to take special care if they
are to avoid serious admonishment.
Even that possibility could not dim the ebullience of United manager
Ivan Golac, who had indicated that he would be less verbose for the rest
of the season, at the same time as banning his players from talking in
public.
But he was in specially good form yesterday when he discussed United's
new man, Brazilian forward Sergio. ''I think he will be a superstar very
quickly,'' said Golac. ''It is easy to see he does things that are

Miami, Monday
A FLORIDA teenager accused of being the gunman in the fatal shooting
of a British tourist pleaded guilty today to a reduced charge of
second-degree murder and will face a 40-year prison sentence.
Sixteen-year-old Aundra Akins was accused of firing the shot that
killed Gary Colley, a 34-year-old lorry driver from Wilsden, near
Bradford, West Yorkshire, during a bungled robbery at an interstate rest
stop, casting a shadow on Florida's reputation as an international
holiday spot.
The plea agreement was reached less than an hour before jury selection
was set to begin for Akins trial over the September 1993 shooting.
He also admitted a charge of attempted murder in the wounding of
Colley's companion Margaret Jagger.
''I think it's an adequate decision. I think it's a fair decision,''
said Jefferson County Sheriff Ken Fortune, in Monticello, Florida.
Akins was one of four youths charged with first-degree murder after
the killing of Mr Colley. He becomes the third teenager to plead to
lesser charges.
The first trial of John ''Billy Joe'' Crumitie, 18, ended in a hung
jury in November. As part of Akins' plea bargain, he agreed to testify
against Crumitie at a retrial set for March 20.
Prosecutors say Akins and Crumitie startled Colley and Jagger while
the couple dozed in a rented car during a drive from New Orleans to
South Florida.
When Colley tried to back up the car to escape, both youths opened
fire, hitting him in the neck and wounding Jagger, 36, it was alleged.
Akins was accused of firing the fatal shot.
If convicted, Akins, who was 14 when he was charged, would face life
behind bars. Florida law prohibits the death penalty for anyone under
age 16.
Defence lawyers have said the evidence against him is weak. Police
have yet to recover the guns used.--AP.

GRAND SLAM TENNIS
SECOND seed Andre Agassi yesterday showed no mercy in knocking out
local hero Patrick Rafter to maintain the American charge into the
quarter-finals of the Australian Open Tennis Championships in Melbourne
Agassi became the fifth American to reach the last eight of the year's
first Grand Slam with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 victory in front of a packed
centre court.
Rafter, the only Australian left in the tournament, drew little
inspiration from his vocal supporters' club and could not match the
speed and court craft of the American.
''It certainly seems that every time I step on the court it is getting
better and better,'' said Agassi, who has yet to drop a set in four
matches.
He achieved his victory with nonchalent ease, in contrast to the
protracted demise of No.6 seed, Stefan Edberg, who suffered his earliest
exit for more than a decade at the tournament as unseeded Aaron
Krickstein joined Agassi, Pete Sampras, Jim Courier, and Michael Chang
in the last eight.
Edberg, who has reached at least the last eight in Melbourne on every
visit save his first as a 16-year-old in 1982, won the first two sets
only to see Krickstein conjure a 6-7,
5-7, 6-4, 7-6, 6-4 triumph.
It abruptly ended a brief European fightback led by Russia's Yevgeny
Kafelnikov and Dutchman Jacco Eltingh, who earlier in the day prevented
Todd Martin and Patrick McEnroe from joining an ominous list of American
title contenders.
Meanwhile, two 21-year-olds were giving the last eight of the women's
event a truly multi-national flavour.
Mexico's Angelica Gavaldon brought off the major upset of the fourth
round by ousting third-seed Jana Novotna, who called her 7-5, 6-0
humiliation ''a horrible match.''
Japan's Naoko Sawamatsu was another unexpected winner, beating
eleventh seed Mary Joe Fernandez 6-4, 7-6 to reach her first Grand Slam
quarter-final just days after her family home was destroyed in her
country's earthquake.
Sawamatsu now plays top seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario after the
Spaniard accounted for the Czech Republic's Karina Habsudova in straight
sets, while Gavaldon has an easier match against unseeded American
Marianne Werdel Witmeyer.
But yesterday's spotlight was again on Agassi, who now has to beat
Kafelnikov to stay on track for his second successive Grand Slam after
his dramatic unseeded capture of the US Open title last September.
Agassi said he played ''almost flawlessly'' in the final 21-minute set
against Rafter, during which he conceded only eight points.
''My matches have been rather consistent, but now it's going to shift
a little bit . . . that's when I want to see myself move to another
level,'' he said.
The forty-fifth ranked Krickstein was scarcely expected to occupy a
quarter-final place but his performance against Edberg left him on the
brink of only his second grand slam semi-final appearance. Despite
celebrating his twenty-ninth birthday last week, Edberg was convinced he
could add a seventh Grand Slam title to his collection, and it took a
dubious line-call at a crucial stage in the fourth set to undermine his
challenge.
Krickstein had already fought back from 5-2 down to
5-4 when he sent a lob over the Swede's head which was adjudged in by
the baseline official.
Had the decision gone the other way, Edberg would have had match point
and the world No.7 was uncharacteristically annoyed afterwards.
''I didn't think it was out, I knew it was out,'' said the normally
unflappable Edberg.
''The guy's sitting in sunglasses and the umpire's too afraid to
overrule. You just have to accept it and hope maybe it's in your favour
next time.''
Krickstein will now face Eltingh, ranked 24th in the world, in the
quarter-finals, far removed from the seeding committee's visions of an
Edberg-Boris Becker showdown.

THE death of a young woman whose badly burned body was found in a
railway station bothy in Ayrshire at the weekend is being treated as
murder, police confirmed last night.
Strathclyde Police, who were called in after the remains were found by
two British Transport Police officers on routine patrol in West
Kilbride, have said they believe the body is that of Mrs Yvette Wilson,
27, of the town's Nethermiln Road.
After a post-mortem examination yesterday, police confirmed they were
treating the death as murder although, until the results of dental tests
are known, the identification will not be a formal one.
An incident room has been established at the town's police office,
with a caravan at the scene, and Detective Chief Inspector Jeanette
Joyce has been called in from Dumbarton to head the inquiry.
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder, the local senior detective, is
to concentrate his efforts on two other unsolved murders -- those of Ms
Nan Love in her home at Fleming Terrace, Irvine, last June, and Ms Shona
Stevens, who died as she walked in Bourtreehill Park, also Irvine, last
November.
Mrs Wilson, who separated from her husband Angus two months ago,
worked as a barmaid at the Kip Marina in Inverkip.
She was last seen leaving work last Thursday around 3.15pm, and was
reported missing at lunchtime on Saturday. It is understood that Mr
Wilson contacted police about the disappearance of his estranged wife.
The bothy at West Kilbride station was sealed off yesterday as police
officers carried out a search of the surrounding area. Forensic officers
spent the weekend examining the bothy.
When last seen Mrs Wilson was wearing a black, loose fitting,
three-quarter length leather coat over casual evening wear and knee
length light brown suede boots. She was 5ft 9in and blonde.
Her aunt, Mrs Nancy Adam, of Crawford Avenue, said: ''None of us can
believe this has happened. If she was the kind of girl who ran about the
place you might have expected her to get into trouble, but she lived
quietly. Her parents are shattered.''
Police have appealed for anyone who saw the victim between 3.15pm on
Thursday January 19 and 6pm on Saturday, or who has any information to
contact them.

A RESEARCHER at Dundee University has been called to give evidence to
President Bill Clinton's advisory committee on human radiation
experiments.
In April Ms Sue Roff, of the university's Centre for Medical
Education, will travel to Washington to tell about her discovery of
American plans to subject mentally deficient children to radiation
burns.
She uncovered memos and letters between leading scientists and the US
army, while researching a book on the legacy of the bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki.
In one letter, dated May 1958, Donald Pillsbury, Professor of
Dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania wrote, to the US armed
forces to propose a study of the effect of radiation burns on human
skin.
The subjects he proposed for experimentation were ''idiots and
feeble-minded children'' from a home in New Jersey and prisoners from
Holmesburg Jail. In December Dr Pillsbury wrote again to suggest
experiments on ''mental defectives'' in the Woodbine State Colony, New
Jersey.
In this letter he wrote: ''There would be no concern about the
possible genetic effects. These individuals will never reproduce.''
In her researches, Ms Roff also discovered evidence relating to a
study in February 1959, in which patients at another American hospital
were injected with radium.
Her book, Hotspots: The Legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, will be
published in August on the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombings.
She said: ''I think this sort of experimentation was not necessary to
the advancement of science. It was unnecessary as well as unethical.
There were 200,000 survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, all of whom
were being closely studied.''

I DON'T think it's violent. It's quite a peaceful play,'' said
23-year-old Sarah Kane in the Independent on Sunday, perhaps a touch
disingenuously. British theatre is littered with plays that have set off
a squawk of revulsion when first staged. But not since Mary Whitehouse
tried to take Howard Brenton's Romans in Britain to court for its
explicit acts of homosexuality in the early eighties has there been such
a furore over a new play as has greeted Kane's Blasted, at the Royal
Court, London.
''This disgusting feast of filth'' trumpeted the usually enthusiastic
Jack Tinker in the Daily Mail. Even the Evening Standard's young turk
Nick Curtis called it ''a chamber of horrors''.
Indeed, Kane's story of a tabloid journalist in the terminal stages of
physical and spiritual decay, his relationship with his former young
girlfriend (slightly backward and probably epileptic), and a soldier who
breaks into their hotel room with bestial consequences does have a
disturbing kind of seedy reality about it -- such that this critic for
the first time in a theatre-going career of some 25 years queasily left
before the real mayhem started.
In the ensuing debate the tabloids have predictably had a field day,
and Newsnight and the World at One have also weighed in, followed by the
Sundays with in-depth interviews with Kane and beleaguered director
James Macdonald.
With a story that includes masturbation, fellatio, male rape,
cannibalism, defecation, Kane maintains and is supported by Caryl
Churchill, one of Britain's leading playwrights, that she is simply
''trying to tell the truth about human behaviour as I see it''.
Churchill, who has written a letter of support of Kane, calls it ''a
very tender and redemptive play''.
Macdonald has no regrets: ''I always knew it was going to be a
difficult piece of work for people to receive. I feel it is an extremely
moral play about things that are really important -- about the violence
that is all around us, not just in places like Bosnia.''
Blasted runs at the Royal Court until February 4.

POLICE are hunting for two teenage girls thought to have been
responsible for an attack on an elderly primary school teacher in
Edinburgh in which the woman was set on fire.
The incident happened as the 63-year-old teacher stood at a bus stop
in Ferry Road, near its junction with Newhaven Road, at about 1.15 last
Friday afternoon.
She became aware of two girls standing behind her, laughing, and then
running away. She then realised her headscarf and coat were on fire.
The woman was saved by the prompt action of a passing motorist, Mr
Michael Cull, 40, of Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh, who used his coat to
extinguish the flames. He said yesterday: ''Thankfully I was able to
reach her in time. A few seconds longer and she could have been a
walking torch.''
Her hair was badly singed because of the intensity of the heat when
her headscarf and coat were burned, a police spokesman said yesterday.
''The woman suffered shock but escaped with soreness and redness to
her neck. She could have suffered horrific injuries, and it was only the
prompt action of a passer-by that saved her,'' he said.
Mr Cull was driving from a Newhaven recycling plant, where he works as
a driver, when he spotted her.
He said: ''I couldn't believe it when I saw that the woman was on
fire. Flames around 18 inches high were leaping from halfway down her
coat to her hair.
''I jumped from the car, taking off my jacket as I ran, and managed to
smother them. The lady was like me -- she could not believe that someone
would deliberately do this.''
Mr Cull said the woman appeared resilient, despite her ordeal, and was
given a lift by a woman motorist, who also stopped within minutes of the
incident. He said he saw two girls run away, but could not identify them
because his immediate concern was to help the woman.
It is not thought that any accelerant was used -- only matches or a
cigarette lighter.
Police are asking anyone who can identify the girls, or may have
information about the incident, to contact Drylaw police station on 031
343 3171.
The girls are said to be about 14 or 15 years old. One was 5ft 7in
with long, dark wavy hair, wearing jeans, trainers, and a red, padded
anorak with white markings on the sleeves. She was carrying either a
school bag or a guitar case.
The other was said to have brown hair, possibly tied in a pony tail.
She was wearing a dark jacket and skirt.
The attack victim has not been named.

LANARK'S Colin McRae recorded the fastest time on the first special
stage of the sixty-third Monte Carlo.
But he dropped from the lead to nineteenth place when his Subaru
Impreza slid into a wall of snow midway through the second special
stage, losing two-and-a-half minutes.
Undeterred, 26-year-old McRae was soon matching the pace of leader
Carlos Sainz and by the end of yesterday's first leg had climbed up to
ninth place overall, three minutes 13 seconds down on his team-mate.
Spaniard Sainz, the 32-year-old former world champion, was 44 seconds
in front when the rally halted in Valence last night after six timed
tests.
In second place was last year's winner Francois Delecour. The
Frenchman, driving a Ford Escort, lost almost a minute on the third
timed test where he gambled on an unconventional tyre choice which
proved to be wrong.
Holding third place was Tommi Makinen, making his debut with Andrew
Cowan's Warwickshire-based Mitsubishi Lancer team.
Rally crews face a further six closed road special stages today and
170km of competitive driving before an overnight halt in
Digne-Les-Bains, in the Alps.
The 2600km rally, which attracted 196 starters, finishes in Monte
Carlo on Thursday.
Interim positions after six of 21 special stages:
1, C Sainz (E)/L Moya (E) Subaru Impreza 1hr 53min 11sec; 2, F
Delecour (F)/C Francois (F) Ford Escort 1-53-55; 3, T Makinen (SF)/S

THE Scottish Athletic Federation will complain to the British
federation over the omission of Dundee's Ian Campbell from the UK team
to face Russia on Saturday.
Campbell set a Scottish native record of 3min 45.26secs to win the
Scottish East District 1500m title last weekend, the day before the team
was chosen -- the fastest indoors by a Briton this winter. It is more
than five seconds ahead of either Ian Grimes or Brian Treacy, chosen men
for Birmingham, or Tony Morrell, the reserve.
Bob Greenoak, the SAF secretary, confirmed yesterday that Campbell's
time had been communicated to selection chairman Dave Cropper in advance
of their meeting.
''Cropper tells me he presented Campbell's time, but that he was
over-ruled by his colleagues. It is completely unfair, and I will be
raising the matter with the BAF executive chairman, Peter Radford.''
Grimes won the Birmingham Games 1500m at new year in
3-50.40, Treacy has not run indoors this winter, while Morrell won the
Scottish title on Sunday in 3-52.78. The team was picked on outdoor
form, when Campbell had a virus.
Campbell's coach, John Anderson, was furious. ''There appears to be
some bias,'' he said. ''Last year Campbell finished second at the AAA
indoors, behind a Kenyan, but ahead of all the Brits, yet still had to
prove himself again to win a place in the European indoor team. It is
not right.''
The 23-year-old Campbell, close runner-up to Tom McKean on Sunday for
the Scottish 800m title, said last night: ''They don't believe what I've
done this season -- it's last year all over again. It's frustrating
knowing I can beat all these guys.
''What's more frustrating is that the selectors know it as well, and
are not going to back down and give me the chance to prove them wrong.''
* DIONICIO Ceron (Mexico) and Katrin Dorre (Germany) will defend their
titles in the NutraSweet London Marathon on April 2. This means a
re-match between Dorre, winner for the past three years, and Liz
McColgan, who finished third there two years ago.

Activity in the Primary School
By M V Daniel
THE author offers a timely reminder of the principles of primary
education which feature so strongly in the 5-14 reports covering the
five areas of the curriculum -- language, mathematics, environmental
studies, expressive arts, religious and moral education.
Daniel identifies four main functions of the primary school -- the
development of the physical and mental abilities of the child, the
establishment of social behaviour, the preparation for everyday life,
and the classification of children for education.
An entire chapter is devoted to the difficult area of assessment and
it would be wise to look at Daniel's book and the 5-14 assessment
document together, especially for catering for the widest range of
intelligence and personal interests.
Daniel establishes the point that ability is extremely difficult to
assess as group and national tests are not sufficiently accurate, while
attainment tests cannot really measure social adjustment, physical
co-ordination, and emotional development. It is further argued that a
sound body and alert mind are valueless unless used to contribute to the
good of society in general. Everyday life demands a certain standard of
skill in the basics and primary children will have to earn their own
living in a few years.
The Scottish Office Education Department, transforming education with
its innovative 5-14 recommendations, will find solace and support in
Daniel's book, especially in chapter three. Here we read of the
importance of the child's natural curiosity and the role of experience
in the early stages of reasoning. The child must be given every
opportunity to acquire a wide vocabulary through conversation and
reading, and to express ideas. As if anticipating the 5-14 expressive
arts report, the book concludes that, in aesthetic appreciation, direct
teaching has to be avoided as children should experience beauty for
themselves.
The book also discusses the role of the headteacher and teacher.
Daniel regrets that the headteacher's duty to know individually every
child is proving more difficult to achieve because of the increase in
administrative work, including the provision of meals, supplementary
clothing coupons, and the development of child record cards.
Not so long ago I was in a charity secondhand shop. There I found
Daniel's book, priced 75p. I was amazed to find out that the challenges
of yesterday were identical to those of today.
Daniel was first published in 1947. A whole generation of teachers,
including myself, was trained along his lines. Indeed those were the
''heady'' days of the best educational report this century, the 65
Primary Memo, when we all thought we would improve society, create great
opportunitues for equality in life through access to knowledge for all
children. School was to be the great focus for the community and yet,
all these decades later, the same challenges and problems remain.
Page for page, Daniel reflects the 5-14 reports -- the organisation of
knowledge, planning and balance in the curriculum, the structure of the
learning day, use of ancillary equipment and workload in the profession
all appear to exist today as of yesterday.
It is to be hoped that future generations of teachers do not walk into
the charity shop and find not only Daniel's book but the 5-14 reports as
well, marked in Euro money, not pennies and pence.
Something Old Something New was published by Blackwell -- in 1947, and
reprinted in 1962, price 15/-!

Sara Villiers is a guest of Sharman Macdonald, the Scottish playwright
whose new play, The Winter Guest, is about to open in Leeds
THE foyers and cafe area of the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds have
been taken over by hundreds of pensioners on their weekly arts'n'crafts
mission, and paintboxes, glass vases, and hands of bridge have conquered
every available surface. ''Isn't it wonderful to see a theatre look so
alive,'' gasps Sharman Macdonald.
Macdonald, the Scottish playwright who penned the West End successes
When I was a Girl I used to Scream and Shout and Shades, hopes to
conquer the local audience with her new play The Winter Guest. It
premieres in Leeds before transferring to London's Almeida and is
directed by the actor Alan Rickman.
''Let's sit over there,'' she says, waving vaguely towards the midst
of the bustle. A quick calculation; the noise level here would rival an
amusement arcade in Las Vegas while Macdonald has the softest and,
despite her 43 years, most girlish voice I have ever heard. ''No,'' I
say firmly, ''let's find somewhere quiet.''
Three flights of stairs later we are nestled in the sanctity of a
brightly lit room in the rafters and I'm mopping up a saucerful of
coffee and marvelling at the way Macdonald transported hers without
spilling a drop. Mentally, she's more messy. The press may have tagged
Rickman, who loathes interviews, as ''awkward'' but while Macdonald
doesn't express the irritation or impatience which Rickman commonly
vents on journos she does have a natural reticence which makes her a
difficult interviewee.
Polite to a fault, she would probably be appalled to read that. But
she won't. ''Oh I never read anything about myself. If I did I couldn't
possibly sit here and talk to you now, I mean it would all just sound so
stupid.''
There is a will-o'-the-wisp quality about her which could verge on
affected feyness were it not quite clearly genuine. She can't remember
how she and Rickman met, the name of the lead character from one of her
previous plays, All Things Nice, escapes her, and when I asked this
exiled Scot where she now calls home she says in a panic: ''I forget!''
She actually lives in Teddington, where she has brought up her
children Cal (14) and Keira (9) with her actor husband Will Knightley,
having moved to London with him in 1972.
She winces visibly when reminded of an afternoon appointment with
Radio Leeds. Interviews make her nervous? ''Oh yes, especially on the
radio. I have completely dried on air,'' and she recalls the awful
moment when she and the loquacious Simon Callow, who directed Shades,
which starred Pauline Collins, did a radio interview together and
Macdonald went completely blank. ''There was this dreadful silence.''
But once she relaxes, once she has accepted that this talk won't be
totally torturous, once she has explained her fear of pretentiousness,
her reluctance to psychologise about the playwriting process, then we
start to have some fun and the sharp wit and the self-effacing humour
which characterises much of Macdonald's work makes itself evidence via
giggled asides and constant self-ridicule: ''Keira's name is Gaelic for
dark one. She's blonde,'' she deadpans.
West Yorkshire Playhouse describes The Winter Guest as ''the humorous
portrayal of the lives of four couples in a seaside town on the west
coast of Scotland''. The characters and concerns apparently include the
following: ''A mother and daughter struggle to find the love they once
shared . . . two boys on the beach are full of the exhilaration of youth
. . . a couple of ardent teenagers fumble clumsily towards a
relationship.''
Which all sounds remarkably similar to Macdonald's first play, the
triumphant When I Was a Girl, which is set in a west coast Scottish
seaside town and features a combative relationship between a mother and
daughter, the exhilarating friendship of two young girls, and some
adolescent fumbling on the beach.
Macdonald regrets the Playhouse's wording and absolutely rejects any
comparisons. ''The plays are very different,'' she insists. ''There are
no plot similarities, although possible thematic concerns are carried
on, but there is no past to this play, there are no flashbacks, as there
were in When I was a Girl.''
One obvious link is the appearance of Sheila Reid -- who played the
mother Morag in the original When I was a Girl -- in The Winter Guest.
''I've wanted to work with her again ever since but either she hasn't
been free or it has simply been the wrong time,'' says Macdonald. ''When
I am writing I often think of Sheila's acting energy. Her vitality is
quite inspiring.
She is also effusive in her praise for Rickman -- who was the first
person to read the script for When I was a Girl when he was reading for
the Gate Theatre in London. ''I've never worked with Alan before but he
has been wonderful. His rehearsals are a safe place to be dangerous in.
He has the knack of turning the negative into something positive. When
the rehearsal period was broken up by Christmas and New Year he simply
insisted that that gave everyone the opportunity to reflect on their
character in a rested way.''
Macdonald has written two novels, The Beast and Night Night and a
Channel 4 screenplay, Wild Flowers but prefers playwriting. ''The last
time I tried writing a novel I ended up killing off all the characters
by page 100 when I blew up a cinema,'' she laughs. ''It wasn't as if the
plot led up to it. The cinema just blew up and I had no book left so I
thought okay, I'm obviously not meant to do this.''
An ex-actress herself she still thrills to the stage. ''It's much more
exciting. There's no question about it, you have a captive audience and
there is a more vibrant dialogue between the audience and the piece.''
That dialogue can be so intense that while the audience responds to an
opening will often galvanise her into rewrites she worries what effect
her presence actually has on the reception of the piece. Not that she is
concerned that she will be recognised; even playwrights of Macdonald's
not inconsiderable stature don't exactly have the same tag which a
Hollywood star like Rickman wears like a burden. ''No, smiles Macdonald,
''but I do worry that I sit there sending out waves of anxiety which
might infect the whole theatre.''

<HEADLINE>Steward gives Lewis a mission</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LENNOX Lewis was yesterday put on a mission to become the best
heavyweight boxer since Muhammad Ali.
His new American master, trainer Emanuel Steward, has made it a
personal crusade to see that Lewis regains the WBC world title -- and
mould him into the best fighting machine since those magical days of Ali
in the process.
It is somewhat ironic that Steward was the man who plotted Lewis's
stunning second-round downfall at the hands of Oliver McCall at the
Wembley Arena last September. Now Steward has switched camps in order to
train Lewis exclusively.
Steward, 50, one-time overlord of the famous Kronk gymnasium in
Detroit, said: ''I've always thought Lennox is the most technically
talented heavyweight out there. It's like a challenge to work with him.
''My main concern is to get Lennox back to the heavyweight
championship of the world as quickly as possible.
''We worked together before, a long time ago. It's all about basic
fundamentals. He's got terrific upper-body movement, and the punching
power has always been there. But I will try to diversify him a bit.
''I'll be working to make him a bit more of a flashier, more colourful
type of boxer.
''Boxing is really without a respected champion. The sport in general
doesn't really have a superstar, and it's my aim to develop Lennox into
one.
''There's nobody around with the image of a Mike Tyson or Ali. From
the start, I said Lennox would be a world champion.''
Steward was one of three candidates for the job formerly held by
controversial Puerto Rican Pepe Correa, who lost his job after the
McCall defeat. Widely regarded as one of the best teachers,
conditioners, and tactitions in world boxing, he will also have a
percentage of Lewis's management terms.
Lewis said: ''Emanuel was picked largely because of his technical
ability. There's a kind of chemistry between us, and that's important
between fighter and trainer.''
Lewis's first assignment since the McCall setback will be a
WBC-ordered final eliminator. Big-hitting Lionel Butler was the intended
opponent but his availability is now in doubt and Lewis could face Joe
Hipp, the next man in the WBC lists.

THE reputation of Nairn continues to grow. The northern course has
been chosen to host the 1999 Walker Cup match having hosted last year's
Amateur Championship.
Michael Bonallack, secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, said:
''Last year's Amateur Championship was an outstanding success, and this
further recognition for the club is richly deserved.''
The match between the top amateurs of Great Britain and Ireland and
America will be the thirty-seventh in the biennial series, but Nairn
becomes only the fourth Scottish venue to stage the fixture following St
Andrews (eight times), Muirfield (twice), and Turnberry (once).
America defend the trophy at Porthcawl in Wales on September 9 and 10.
Meanwhile, Gordon Sherry is set to team up with the Englishman who
beat him in the Nairn final last year when they represent Great Britain
and Ireland in next month's two-man World International Team
championships in Argentina.
Sherry, 20, of Kilmarnock, Barassie, will join forces with 22-year-old
Lee James, for the four-day tournament starting on February 22 at Mar
Del Plata golf club near Bueonos Aires. The pair will then fly the
British flag in the Argentinian Amateur championship the following week.

It was a true story, a modern tragedy that had to be told. Carole
Woddis talks to the writers of the play Jordan
MOIRA BUFFINI isn't quite sure what to call herself these days.
Actress and writer, she's just finished two scripts (one for the stage,
the other her first screenplay) but is about to don the actor's habit
again as a single mother who tries to commit suicide, botches it, and
ends up killing the one thing she has loved more than her own life --
her 13-month-old son, Jordan.
A desperate tale, it is based on a true story that writer Anna
Reynolds first heard from a fellow inmate when she herself was in prison
under similarly grim circumstances.
''It was a story that just had to be told,'' insisted Reynolds when
she was released and had begun to exorcise her experiences with a trio
of hard-hitting plays about women inside. Jordan was the first and it
opens at Aberdeen's Lemon Tree on Thursday, going on to Glasgow's Tron
next week.
Buffini's is alone on stage for an hour and a quarter. An emotional
roller coaster, it is, she says, the most rewarding part she's ever
played, and not only does she play the protagonist, she also helped to
write the play.
''I first met Anna when I came out of drama school,'' says Buffini.
Since then she's been a frequent visitor to Scotland, with appearances
in Pitlochry, Glasgow (Paul Selig's Terminal Bar) and Edinburgh (David
Mamet's Speed the Plow).
''I had put on a play called Making the Bad Girls Good about women in
prison which did quite well at the Edinburgh Fringe. We brought it to
London and it needed some rewrites which Anna, who was then working as a
part-time administrator at Clean Break (the theatre company set up by
women ex-prisoners), helped me with.
''We just became good friends, and when she said she had this story
she needed to tell, because I'd had some theatre experience we started
to write the play together.''
The play quickly took off -- partly through Buffini's performance (her
sister Fiona is its director) and partly through the power of the
harrowing, yet immensely touching, story itself. The name of the woman
concerned has, naturally, been changed, but the major incidents remain.
It won Buffini a Time Out Best Performance award in 1992, while the
Writers' Guild gave it a best London Fringe Play award. Revived again
last year, Buffini still finds it ''enormously rewarding, a real
privilege to do''.
''Yes, it is a bit like Ken Loach's recent film Ladybird, Ladybird,''
she agrees. ''Yet another tale of someone at the bottom of the heap. The
greatest compliment though was in Athens when a leading Greek actress
called it 'a modern tragedy'.
''The tragic thing is that she is someone trying desperately hard to
get it right -- and the clumsiness of those who try to help her. The
boyfriend with whom she's had a violent relationship and who is the
child's father, comes back and threatens to gain custody of the child.
''There's the implication that she may be suffering from post-natal
depression, but all she can see is people wanting to take her child away
from her. She gradually goes in on herself to such an extent that death
finally becomes her only chance of freedom.''
Buffini, who has taught drama in Holloway, has strong words for what
she saw there. ''Punishment doesn't work; it just screws lives up
more.''
For all that, Jordan is far from being simply depressing. There's too
much love in it for that, plus a dark kind of humour and fragile
courage. But it is especially the ebullience of Buffini's performance
that constantly rises above the stark realities of the life on show.
* Jordan is at The Lemon Tree, Aberdeen, January 26-28, and the Tron,
Glasgow January 31-February 5.

<HEADLINE>Dutch examine possibility of flying in calves from Canada</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>27</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980205751</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
VEAL calf finishers in the Netherlands are reported to be examining
the possibility of flying in young calves from Canada to counteract the
fall-off in exports from the United Kingdom.
The difficulties in the UK, combined with restrictions on
third-country imports, have combined to leave the veal producers
struggling to find alternative sources of supply.
The move is seen as ''logistically extreme,'' but also as a logical
solution to the problem of maintaining throughput levels now that
British and Irish calves -- on which demand had been focused for the
past two years -- are no longer readily available.
A report by Agra Europe, which monitors the agricultural scene within
the European Community, points out that in addition to British exports
being blocked by animal welfare protestors, supplies are also being
diverted to over-quota dairy farms, where thousands of extra calves are
being reared to use up surplus fresh milk.
This move is designed to reduce the impact of the expected 1994-95
super-levy, which is currently estimated to be at least #40m in the UK.
The outlook for 1995 is for a further reduction in deliveries, as
demand from over-quota milk producers in the first quarter diverts
supplies which might otherwise have gone abroad. Pure-bred dairy bull
calves are also being priced out of the export market by dairy farmer
demand, which is reported to have lifted the average by #40 a head to
about #195.
Holstein-Friesian bull calf prices averaged #100 in Britain last week,
despite the estimated retention of roughly half of those which were
suitable for export. However, from the beginning of the new milk quota
year on April 1, there is expected to be a substantial price drop --
unless regular exports are once again possible.
Recent speculation has centred on the likelihood that the majority of
the 500,000 dairy-bred calves which are normally available for export
each year, will either be finished for veal in the UK, or slaughtered
within 10 days of birth because they have no commercial value.
The early slaughter option has been challenged by the Federation of
Fresh Meat Wholesalers, which argues that its members have the capacity
to process all the animals that have recently been exported live, if
they were grown to commercial weight.
The Meat and Livestock Commission has acknowledged that domestic veal
production in the UK will not provide the answer to the export calf
problem. But it points out that, even a small increase in production
beyond the current level of 10,000 calves a year, would make a
contribution towards countering the problem of absorbing up to 500,000
dairy-bred calves if export deliveries continued to be harassed, or even
banned completely.
The Commission has also dismissed predictions that the majority of
surplus calves will have to be slaughtered at less than 10 days old. It
accepts that there will always be some commercially worthless animals in
the system, but predicts that even if live exports are blocked
completely, almost every male British calf will acquire some value,
because finishers will recognise their ability to qualify for the Beef
Special Premium payment -- worth #85 at the age of 10 months.
As a result of this, the Commission suggests, the majority will be
finished on silage systems, and sold at 16 months weighing at least
600kg liveweight.
The Tesco supermarket group announced yesterday that it proposes to
adopt RSPCA recommendations on animal transport. By the end of this
year, they hope to ensure that no meat delivered to Tesco stores comes
from an animal that has spent more than eight hours in transit.
The company is also planning to introduce its own traceability scheme,
so that all meat products can be tracked back to the farmer producer.
Tesco has already moved to ensure that all veal products in its stores
come from high welfare units in Britain.

<TEXT>
A MAN who raided a sub-post office and then attempted to evade arrest
by hiding in the boot of his getaway car was jailed for five years at
the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday.
The court was told that David McMahon, 21, staged a robbery at a post
office in Links Street, Kirkcaldy, Fife, on May 20 last year. But
instead of fleeing from the scene he climbed into the boot of his car
parked nearby, where police found him with the #1117 from the raid and
the water pistol he used to intimidate a woman employee.
McMahon, of Niven Road, Inverkeithing, Fife, who said he was ''out of
his head'' on drink and drugs at the time of the crime, admitted
assaulting a woman employee at the post office by presenting a bag
containing a water pistol at her, pretending he had a firearm in his
possession, repeatedly demanding money, and robbing her of the cash.
He also pled guilty to assaulting two women at a video shop in High
Street, Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, on September 11, by pretending he
had a gun by presenting a bag and metal tubing at them and attempting to
rob them.
Advocate-depute John Morris told the court that during the first raid
McMahon walked into the sub-post office just before closing time.
One woman went to serve him but McMahon demanded cash from her. The
victim thought he was carrying a gun in the bag and gathered money and
handed it over, but other staff had alerted police to what was going on.
McMahon fled from the scene, but police had also received a report of
someone tampering with a car, and when they went to investigate they
found him lying in the boot, along with a black bag containing the water
pistol and the money from the robbery.
McMahon was arrested and later released on bail. About four months
later, he staged his second robbery bid at the video shop in
Tillicoultry.
The two women in the shop locked themselves in a storeroom after he
demanded cash, fearing that the object he was carrying in a bag was a
gun. When they later emerged from the storeroom they found the raider
had left empty-handed.
Defence counsel Derek Ogg said McMahon had become depressed after
losing his job and began drinking and taking Temazepam. He was under the
influence when he staged the post office raid.
He added that although his client ''made good his escape from the post
office'', he had behaved oddly by getting into the boot of the getaway
car and pulling it shut, instead of driving off.
Lord Morton told McMahon: ''The court has said on many occassions that
people who commit robberies will inevitably get severe
sentences.''McMahon was given a further three months for breaching bail.

THE Scottish presence at Art 95, Britain's contemporary art fair at
the Business Design Centre in Islington which concluded at the weekend,
was particularly impressive. As a whole, the impression was of a
national school with strong traditions and a commitment to a rejuvenated
figurative tradition.
Adrian Wiszniewski, one of those artists associated with the Scottish
return to the object, was chosen by Galerie Fortlaan 17, part of a large
Belgian contingent at the exhibition. His six-foot square Study in
Self-Analysis, painted in 1991, has the nervous intensity of late
Kokoschka with a juicy paint surface.
Steven Campbell was well represented, too, with work from the William
Hardie Gallery and a similar line in titles that veer between the
humorous and the whimsical, as In Defence of Girls Who Like Milk.
His references to the masters abound, and Manet and Cezanne are both
gently teased. His Cezanne's Bathers, Campbell's Bathers is a parody on
the traditional subject matter of the nudes who never get wet.
Campbell's bathers swim in a green sea infested with hammerhead sharks.
The selection of oils by John G Boyd was interesting and diverse --
heavily impasted still lifes and a selection of paintings that treat men
with boats cradled in their arms like children. The Black Boat is a fine
work painted in sombre earth tones enlivened by a small touch of scarlet
and the surface scratched with the end of the brush.
The nautical theme continued in the two paintings by Jock McFadyen at
the Scottish Gallery's stand -- Girl at Leith, and Leith Mermaid. The
small fantastical figure of the mermaid provides a kind of optimism set
against the heavy industries in the background.
The gallery also showed a large stunning mixed media piece by Barbara
Rae titled Evening Farm in dark, rich colours, and superb painterly
qualities: tracks of liquid paint dribbled down its surface. Elizabeth
Blackadder's small exquisite Still Life Nikko is a tabletop assemblage
of objects, compartmentalised into geometric patterns; richly coloured
tissue papers are heightened by watercolour and gold and silver paint.
Over at the Glasgow Print Studio, Blackadder was again represented
with a Japanese theme -- Horyuji and Nara focus on architectural details
reduced to a simple design. A quirky group of prints and paintings by
John Byrne, Boy With Yellow Boots or Wrapt Angel, featured his muse,
Patrick. These are interesting works treated in a bold, figurative way
which blur sexual differences. Patrick is often shown teasingly
semi-nude reclining in a provocative pose, much as one might find a
female nude but disconcerting when applied to Boy With Yellow Boots.
A lithograph by Elspeth Lamb Sunset, Heart and Wings is one of a
series that uses the image of a heart, punning and playing about with
its symbolic connotations. The Compass Gallery showed a particularly
fine collection of them, including Heart and Horn and Heart of
Midlothian. Both use rich leading reds and strong images. Her larger
works The Buried Mirror and Antipodean Milagro carry the same theme
through in screen print, with intense colours and gold and silver.
Like most of the other artists represented at Art 95, her use and
mastery of colour for its emotional impact is particularly marked. It is
however the commitment to figurative tradition -- often underlined by
amusing or allusive titles and an interest in texture even in
printmaking -- which marks out common ground between the Scottish
artists.

DAIRY farmers have to come to terms with the reality of Scottish Pride
plc being an entirely different organisation from its retired parent --
Scottish Pride -- which in effect was virtually synonymous with the old
Scottish Milk Marketing Board, according to the company's chairman Lord
Sanderson of Bowden.
Speaking in Edinburgh yesterday, Lord Sanderson said: ''We are a
commercial company in the real sense, with a responsibility to our
farmer shareholders.''
Lord Sanderson, who was formerly the Minister of State at the Scottish
Office with responsibility for agriculture, is particularly keen to see
farmers appreciate the new world.
''There is an enormous difference between the past and what is now
required, but I do believe there is a good future for Scottish Pride --
though it will take time.''
Getting the message over to farmers is one of Lord Sanderson's leading
priorities, and part of this will involve regular bulletins, as well as
a series of meetings to be held shortly in key areas such as Galloway,
Bute, and Campbeltown.
He openly acknowledges that the dairy industry is highly competitive,
and the days of farmers thinking little about milk prices are gone.
He commented: ''I can see clearly that farmers have an obvious
interest in getting the best possible price for their milk -- mainly
through Scottish Milk. But we, in turn, have to buy milk as effectively
as we can. I am anxious to emphasise that point to farmers. We have to
be commercial.''
In response to the question of whether Scottish Pride might better
serve its own interests by purchasing directly from producers, Lord
Sanderson said: ''I am not anxious to go down that road yet, because we
have so many close historical links with Scottish Milk.''
However, ruling nothing out of the future scenario, he added: ''We
shall judge the situation more fully after at least a year of the
present marketing arrangements. But in the event that we have to source
directly, I have promised John Ross, the president of the NFU, that we
will discuss it fully with the union.''
Supermarkets are a major influence. Lord Sanderson said: ''Bread,
milk, and bananas, are the three products that supermarkets are willing
to sell at a loss to get people through their doors. Cheese is no
easier, and that makes life very difficult for us. We have to
concentrate on the quality aspect of the Scottish products.''
Lord Sanderson admits that he has had to initiate major changes within
Scottish Pride, including shedding some personnel. He added: ''We are
not going to sit still. We intend to progress sensibly, and meet our
budget targets -- which are realistic.
''We are already on the way, and I think that when our report is
published in July, we will show farmers that we are on target.
Thereafter, I expect in the following year we will have something to
shout about.''
Already, Scottish Pride -- with an asset value of #16m, and a turnover
of #169m in 1994 -- has invested #2.2m in new equipment, much of it in
the very latest bottling plant at Govan, which puts milk in 1-litre
plastic containers.
''There's more to come. We are not in the slow lane. We cannot afford
to be,'' said Lord Sanderson.
Taking his strategy a stage further, he said: ''Turnover for its own
sake is not everything. We have to generate a greater return on our
assets, and make sustainable profits which can be passed on to farmers
through our dividend.''
The cheese sector is causing concern to Scottish Pride, as witnessed
by the closure of the Galloway Creamery in Stranraer, which was viewed
as a non-sustainable operation in the longer term.
Lord Sanderson commented: ''There is a very large capacity for cheese
making in the UK, and we don't ever want to get into the situation of
having to write-off cheese stocks.

Grozny, Monday
AN uneasy calm has replaced the relentless violence of the past six
weeks in Grozny and Russian army reinforcements are pouring into the
Chechen capital to consolidate their hold on captured rebel territory.
The city's few remaining residents have used the lull to venture
cautiously from shelters to obtain supplies and bury their dead.
Reuter television producer Gleb Bryansky today saw a column of 150
Russian vehicles move into Grozny from the north, including trucks with
troops, armoured carriers and anti-aircraft guns that can be put to
deadly use in street fighting.
Forty more armoured vehicles and six self-propelled guns arrived on
trucks at a railhead north of the city, he said.
It was unclear whether the Russian reinforcements heralded a new
Russian bid to clear Grozny of remaining Chechen fighters.
In the southern suburb of Aldy, people came out to bury the dead.
Bodies, wrapped in white sheets, were carried on sledges on snow-covered
streets to be buried in graves in a small wood. Some people said they
had been unable to bury victims of the war for 10 days.
Patrols of Chechen fighters picked their way carefully through
rubble-strewn streets in the city centre, pausing as a mortar bomb
exploded in the distance.
In the southern Chernorechye suburb, where two people collecting
drinking water from a reservoir were killed by a mortar round on
Saturday, children played on sledges.
Russian guns have all but ruined Grozny, a city of 400,000 before the
fighting sent refugees fleeing to the countryside.
A senior Russian military official, speaking to Interfax news agency
in the North Ossetian capital Mozdok, said Russian troops were actively
clearing snipers and commandos from Grozny.
But he said resistance from what the Kremlin calls ''illegal armed
formations'' -- Chechen rebels -- was considerably weaker.
Russia sent tanks and troops into largely Muslim Chechnya on December
11 to crush the Caucasus region's independence bid, but its bloody
campaign has faced pressure at home and abroad.
In Brussels, the European Union, worried about driving Moscow into
complete isolation, called today for an end now to the conflict in
Chechnya but refrained from using immediate economic measures to force
the issue.
Germany, Russia's staunchest Western ally and biggest foreign aid
donor, threatened to halt its financial aid to Moscow unless the
bloodshed stopped.
German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe, stunned by Russian defence
minister's recent abuses against a prominent Russian human rights
campaigner, effectively told Pavel Grachev he would not be welcomed in
Germany next month.
Grachev openly branded President Boris Yeltsin's human rights
commissioner Sergei Kovalyov on Friday as an ''enemy of Russia'' and
traitor for his fierce criticism of the Kremlin's military operation in
Chechnya.
Yeltsin's close aide Sergei Filatov defended Kovalyov today saying
that the 64-year-old former dissident had taken up the case of the
prominent human rights campaigner Andrei Sakharov.
''The state should have a man to succeed to Sakharov, though he
(Kovalyov) is not easy to deal with for the government and it's
unpleasant to listen to his words,'' Filatov, Yeltsin's administration
chief, told a news conference.
Meanwhile, a group of Russian women made a dramatic bid today to
penetrate the heart of the embattled Chechen capital.
A busload of about 40 mothers of Russian soldier reached the
southwestern outskirts of Grozny around midday. Their mission: to secure
the release of sons taken prisoner during the drawn-out struggle for the
city.

MARYHILL Careers Office in the north of Glasgow is one of the busiest
in the city. According to the area careers officer, Isobel Millar, about
50 or 60 young people call at the office in an average week and at
certain times of year -- for example school leaving dates -- the figure
is higher.
The Maryhill office caters for a large incidence of youngsters from
black and ethnic minority (BEM) communities -- usually amounting to
about 90 school leavers per year -- and is an obvious focus for the
career service's strategy for supporting these communities.
Under the direction of David Peden, assistant principal careers
officer for Glasgow, nominees from every careers office in the city have
formed a team to implement the BEM strategy -- Kate Hasson, a senior
careers officer, is Maryhill's representative. The whole initiative has
been coordinated for the last two years by another senior careers
officer, Neena Mahal.
In that time many commendable steps have been taken. Leaflets in
minority languages have been produced -- covering such matters as course
and career choices and the system of student grants and loans -- and are
distributed at parents' evenings and community points. A telephone
helpline has been set up, using speakers of Chinese, Urdu, Hindi and
Punjabi.
Kate Hasson explains that fourth-year pupils have the careers service
described to them, complete a questionnaire and agree an individual
''career plan of action''. A continuous tracking exercise identifies
suitable vacancies or training opportunities. Outreach work, especially
with youth groups, is done with those who have left school but not
registered with the service.
Neena Mahal has made a stong impact in her short tenure of office. She
has run information sessions for employers, covering not only ethnic
minority cultures but also the need for sensitivity in such areas as the
respecting of religious festivals. She has taken forward Strathclyde
region's policies on equal opportunities and the tackling of racist
incidents and has initiated an audit of secondary schools to establish
current practice.
Perceptions, she feels, are changing significantly. ''Ethnic minority
families value education highly for reasons which are partly cultural.
The younger generation is aware of its rights and there is a feeling
that, the better educated you are, the more you can handle racism or
discrimination.''
She makes the interesting point that ''the percentage of BEM school
leavers proceeding to further and higher education is now more than
double that in the white population -- 71% against 32%. Moreover, there
are now equal numbers of boys and girls continuing their education as
the traditional place of women in ethnic communities evolves.''
The Glasgow careers service's latest figures for school leaver
destinations are:
Destination.................BEM leavers..............White leavers
Work........................26 (10%)................1139.(24%)
Youth training..............21.(8%).................1072.(23%)
Further and higher ed......187.(71%)................1517.(32%)
Unemployed..................30.(11%)................1009.(21%)
Total.......................264.....................4737
The careers service can be influential in broadening the horizons of
some of its BEM clients, while respecting their family links. Damarra
Lau, interviewed by her school careers officer in fourth year, was
thinking of joining the family business in the traditional manner.
Taking account of Damarra's own aspirations, the careers officer raised
the possibility of business administration, which would offer her a
recognised qualification and still allow her to contribute to the family
business.
By fifth year Damarra was willing to consider alternatives. The
careers service helped to find her a placement on Strathclyde region's
Youth Training Programme. She is now working on a full-time basis as a
clerical officer in the region's department of physical planning. ''The
careers service,'' she says, ''was really helpful in encouraging me to
widen my choices''.

<RECORDNO>980205760</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE body of a missing patient lay undiscovered for a month in the
basement of a large teaching hospital, a revelation which yesterday
brought immediate calls on the Government for an inquiry.
Mr Carlos Padillo, 40, had undergone an operation for a ruptured
appendix two days before he disappeared.
As a nurse was trying to give him an injection, he smashed a glass
door and ran off.
The body of Mr Padillo, who had been ''very depressed'' after the
operation, was found at the weekend in ducting in a machine room at St
Thomas's Hospital in Lambeth, south London.
A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and further tests are
taking place to establish the cause of death. Police said there appeared
to be no suspicious circumstances.
Mr Padillo, who was employed as a porter at the hospital until 1981,
was last seen alive on a fire escape on December 22, two days after his
operation.
His widow, Olga, said she had spent the evening with her husband
shortly before he disappeared.
She told Sky News she was convinced the searches carried out by
hospital security staff and police were not thorough enough.
''If they had done a good search at night I am sure he would have been
found alive.''
Mr Richard Parker, regional officer for Unison in south London, said:
''It is an absolute scandal that a body should be found in a major
London teaching hospital in such circumstances. There should be an
immediate inquiry into security services there, which since the summer
have been operated by a private firm.''
Shadow Health Minister Nick Brown called for a Government statement on
the case.
He said: ''There will have to be an inquiry if there were cost savings
on the security of the building and it was not properly searched.
Clearly, important questions will need answering.''
Mr Padillo, of Camberwell, south London, appears to have used a
service lift to get into the machine room which is locked to members of
the public.
A search by police and hospital security staff failed to trace him.
Scotland Yard said there had been fears for his safety because of his
depressed state.
A spokeswoman for the hospital, which has set up its own internal
inquiry into the death, said he was being treated by a nurse when he
became violent and ran off.
She added: ''The nurse was trying to administer an injection and he
became violent towards her. As she was calling for help, he smashed
through a glass door leading on to the fire escape and got away.''
The hospital said earlier that staff found the body at the weekend
''concealed under ducting pipes''.
A spokesman said: ''He would have had to crawl under them to get to
where he was.''
An inquest will be held later. The Department of Health declined to
comment on the case.

THERE was another anti-climax in Los Angeles yesterday. The television
networks, the rest of the media, and half the country were ready for the
red meat of the O J Simpson trial, the opening statements, but the
lawyers delayed it all again.
The defence launched another attack on one of the prosecution
witnesses, a detective; they produced a list of witnesses they wanted to
call; and on top of that O J himself wanted to address the jury right at
the beginning of the trial. And the prosecution objected to all of it.
Federal lawyers made a request for one week's delay. They wanted
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito to postpone the opening arguments, that
so they could evaluate witnesses and evidence contained in defence
papers handed over at the last minute. The judge eventually put things
off until 10am today, 6pm British time.
It took the opposing teams all of half-an-hour just to agree to look
at a short video the defence had produced, apparently from newsreel
clippings.
Media attention has been intense since just after the killings, when
police hinted that Simpson, 47, might be a suspect. That attention
exploded when an arrest warrant was issued and Simpson eluded the
police.
He was captured during a slow-speed freeway chase that was broadcast
live nationwide and shown across the world.
Simpson has pled not guilty to murdering his ex-wife, Nicole, and her
friend Ronald Goldman.

Jerusalem, Monday
PRIME Minister Yitzhak Rabin said today that Israel would pursue peace
with the Palestinian leadership despite a series of bloody attacks by
Palestinian suicide bombers.
''We shall continue in the path of peace. There is no alternative,''
Rabin told the nation in a special televised message one day after 18
Israeli soldiers and a civilian were killed and 60 people injured in an
attack in central Israel.
Israeli and PLO officials vowed to pursue and punish the Islamic
militants behind the suicide bombing. The Islamic Jihad, a group opposed
to a 1993 Israel-PLO peace accord, said two of its members blew
themselves up in the attack at a bus station.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israel would press PLO leader
Yasser Arafat to take vigorous action against Islamic Jihad and Hamas,
another militant Muslim group opposed to the peace deal.
A PLO security official promised that the Palestinian Authority in
charge of the Gaza Strip would take stronger measures against militants
than it had in previous instances.
''This time we will not randomly arrest leaders and activists of the
groups which carry out attacks against Israelis from Gaza Strip, and
release them after a while,'' said the official, who declined to be
named.
''We are going to nip their activities in the bud, we are going to
foil their plans in advance,'' he told Reuters.
The bloody attack shocked Israelis and strained the fragile peace
accord. Rabin's cabinet resisted popular pressure to suspend peace
talks.
''There are insane people and extremists who want to destroy
everything . . . We cannot let them prevail,'' Peres told reporters.
Hundreds of Gazans streamed to the homes of the two men named by
Islamic Jihad as the bombers.
''The Islamic movement gives its condolences to the hero of the attack
which led to the killing of 20 pigs and the injuring of 60 monkeys,'' an
unidentified man shouted through a loud speaker at one of the wakes.
Israeli troops, enforcing a government order, blocked nearly 60,000
Palestinian labourers in self-ruled Gaza and the occupied West Bank from
entering the Jewish state.
Arafat yesterday condemned the attack, the deadliest in Israel since a
suicide bomber from Hamas killed 22 people on a Tel Aviv bus in October.
But Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said: ''He must do
something much more serious even if it means a more serious
confrontation with his brothers.''
Israeli commentators appeared at a loss over how to deal with the
growing phenomenon of suicide bombers since the Israeli-PLO peace deal
signing in September 1993. At least 110 Israelis and 195 Palestinians
have been killed in the bloodshed since.
Meanwhile, the 15 EU foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, issued a
statement today condemning the suicide bombings and said it hoped
''those in favour of the peace process will continue to take it
forward''.
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the group sent its
condolences to Israeli officials for the ''appalling'' bomb attack ''but
we urged them not to be deflected from the peace process''.
At the United Nations in New York, Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali expressed ''shock and dismay'' at the attack.
The Pope joined the condemnations, while echoing hopes that the
outrage would not derail peace talks.
Thousands attended funerals that began today for the the Israelis
killed.
But the outrage was not condemned everywhere. The Islamic militant
group Hamas today praised Islamic Jihad for what it called ''this heroic
operation'' and lashed out at the Palestinian Authority for condemning
it.
* Israeli soldiers beat two Palestinian youths unconscious and left
them in a ditch outside the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, the
youths claimed today.
The incident came hours after the bombings.--Reuter

OPENING on Sunday night, the Humpff Family inadvertently demonstrated
the worth of maintaining your Celtic connections, ie staying at home in
Glasgow rather than moving to London. For had the Humpffs decamped to
the metropolis earlier in their six-year career, their Caledonian
jug-band cow-punk vigour would surely by now have been sadly dissipated
by a journey through the belly of the rockbiz beast.
Instead, the Humpffs' odd blend of influences -- Doctor Hook meets the
Pogues, early Jefferson Airplane, and John Gordon Sinclair -- continues
to amuse and energise. Pay attention, south Britain.
Having long since forsworn London exile for their native Lanarkshire
heaths, the Silencers have resurrected an auld Franco-Scottish alliance,
being as big in Paris as they are in Partick.
They took a risk on Sunday, unveiling some hitherto-unheard and
somewhat Gallic-accented songs from their forthcoming album, So Be It.
But there was never any serious danger of the Silencers failing to
please. Once again, Jimme has married winsome lyrics to powerful
melodies. Tellingly, one of Jimme's quiet debutants, About The Sea,
earned as much enthusiastic approval as the old party-time stalwarts.
The Silencers' version of Wild Mountain Thyme is an
ambient-trance-rock gem. Pay attention, Runrig. The Silencers: Glasgow's
most tune-laden band, what, what, what?

Channel 4's high-profile campaign for Brookside, which tonight will
feature the Jordache family's attempts to conceal the murder of their
violent father, has once more brought the issue of sexual abuse firmly
into the public domain -- and a major Scottish Office report just
published has debunked many myths about offenders. But, argues Sarah
Nelson, the focusing on the need to categorise the convicted leaves
several key questions unanswered.
THE Scottish Office's major research report on child sexual abusers is
an important and pioneering study. Noted academics Lorraine Waterhouse,
Russell Dobash, and James Carnie have made a huge contribution in
finally shifting the focus of knowledge and understanding where it
should be -- on perpetrators.
The men's frank disclosures and striking lack of empathy for their
victims have debunked many comforting myths about abusers. The new
realism of most professionals who work with particularly intractable and
manipulative offenders was most encouraging. None the less, parts of the
study will still alarm groups who support and campaign for women and
children facing domestic violence and sexual abuse. Why is this?
A major aspect was its attempt to classify abusers into different
groups, based on in-depth interviews with 53 convicted offenders. The
new ''RAPID'' scheme proposed two major groups -- incest offenders, and
exclusively child-oriented paedophiles -- plus two minorities, dangerous
and violent ''random abusers'', and men who denied all charges (some may
indeed have been wrongly convicted).
This is a far more intelligent scheme than many earlier, discredited
classifications, which included alcoholics, imbeciles, and men with
''atrophy of the frontal lobes''. It was part of a serious attempt to
assess degrees of ''dangerousness'' and identify which offenders might
respond to work aimed at changing their attitudes and actions.
But such schemes have many dangers. The time, effort and funding spent
on classification may also be put far more usefully into other child
protection work.
Schemes like this, however careful and qualified, are always
popularised less cautiously. Hard-pressed professional staff seize with
relief on the headline points as a way of organising very hard,
traumatic work, and making some achievements. Who is safer to be
paroled, given contact with their family or even allowed home? The
scheme could, for instance, lead many workers to generalise that incest
offenders are ''safer'' than paedophiles, as are men who express remorse
and empathy -- even if this is not genuine.
There are huge problems in assessing how dangerous -- or safe -- sex
offenders are, and what crimes they have actually committed. Only
survivors know this, and they were not involved in the research; nor
were their accounts compared with the interviewees'. Despite the
latter's surprising frankness on their motivations, experience suggests
many may only have revealed a fraction of their actions. The picture
from survivors so often defies classification: their abuser may at once
have molested children within and beyond the family; been violent to
adult women; made and sold pornography; and taken part in a sex ring.
The researchers admit little information was available about
perpetrators from many of the 500 sexual abuse cases they also studied.
Information also depends greatly on society's existing state of
knowledge (e.g. awareness of sadistic cult abuse or institutional sex
rings has only begun to grow in recent years).
Secondly, if we actually had full information on thousands of abusers
in Scotland alone who are NOT convicted or charged, we might have to
alter considerably a classification scheme based on the backgrounds or
actions of convicted offenders. Again, only survivors know the true
picture.
Thirdly, the vast majority of these convicted men will be released
eventually, whether they are judged very dangerous, moderately
dangerous, or whatever. In that sense, they all urgently need to be
worked with. Likewise, any of the offenders deemed ''safer'' or ''more
amenable'' may offend again at any time. It will always be a lottery.
Thus it may make far more sense to consider all sex offenders
potentially dangerous, and all deserving of intensive work inside and
outside prison; though programmes could certainly be tailored to their
main proclivities (e.g. paedophile) and to personal variations. Victim
awareness should be more central throughout, since most men in the study
were unable to identify with what the children felt.
The ''lottery'' aspect does not mean work with offenders is pointless:
it is overdue. But it does suggest equal or greater emphasis should be
on effective, consistent monitoring when these men return to (or serve
their sentence in) the community. Survivors want to know what resources,
support, credibility and involvement they can expect as of right.
The British Associaton of Social Workers in Scotland responded by
calling again for a register of sex offenders -- (this has its own
problems, which need public debate) but there has been less stress on
the need fully to involve in any programme victims, families, and the
campaign and support groups with detailed knowledge of sexual abuse and
domestic violence. They have a great deal to contribute to the work of
professionals with offenders, including social workers, police and
psychologists, but are often excluded from giving it.
Fourthly, since the central, admirable goal of this research was to
protect children better, the lessons will have very limited impact if
concentrated only on the tiny proportion of convicted offenders.
Of course it's important to improve work with this ''captive sample''.
But a much greater problem is to protect thousands of young people,
present and future, whose abusers may never come to court. That raises
the urgent question: are future resources better spent in refining the
classification of sex offenders, or in applying the lessons of the study
to public education programmes, in communities and schools, which
challenge attitudes to sexual violence?
The only other area of criticism in an excellent study is that many
people will be disappointed the authors concluded against attempting to
counter the move towards concentrating sex offenders in a few jails.
This has had many practical attractions and radical change would face
strong obstacles. But in the long run segregation must be a sterile,
even dangerous, policy.
It gives perfect scope for offenders to swap abusive fantasies and
reinforce beliefs. It prevents them confronting other male prisoners
whose attitudes might constructively challenge theirs. It enables
''ordinary'' prisoners to scapegoat and vilify ''nonces'', instead of
facing up to any unsafe attitudes about women and children they may
share. Some ordinary prisoners, and indeed some staff, will have been
guilty of unrevealed sex crimes themselves.
There can be no ''normalisation'' of sex offenders, nor any major
change in attitudes among all prisoners and prison officers (for the
benefit of children and women) until this segregation between and indeed
within jails is reversed. But that would take an enormous feat of
political will: which organisations will dare to take the lead in asking
for it?

TWO snapshots taken from my memories of the ''festive season''.
Christmas Eve: the brother in law of a friend with whom our family was
asked to celebrate Christmas and to whom we have just been introduced
looks anxiously at his watch as the time approaches for the lottery
numbers to be drawn on television. He has had a premonition that he will
win -- as have around 15 million others. He doesn't; nor do they.
Hogmanay: an elderly woman with a carrier bag is struggling around the
bonnet of an obscenely large, private number-plated car -- illegally
parked, of course -- while its owner is filling its immense boot with
boxes of spirits. He is oblivious to her plight. She struggles on
unaided.
Ours is a society obsessed with the dream of winning a sum of money so
large that nothing else matters. Because, let's face it, when you're
rich you can be as selfish as you like and nobody can put a stop to it.
Parking fines? Why worry when you could buy the local police force?
Getting up for work? Who needs to earn money when you've got #17m?
No one can sensibly claim that the National Lottery has created a
materialistic society. What it has done, however, is provide an
apparently legitimate focus for our materialism and lend respectability
to the ''get rich quick'' pipe dream. And the worst bit of it all is
that Anthea Turner, looking horribly out of place as the obligatory
''vacuous bimbo in charge'' of the draw, is none other than a recent
Blue Peter presenter. I still recall the shock to my adolescent
sensibilities of seeing Valerie Singleton, sans Blue Peter badge,
presenting BBC2's Money Programme some years after her last appearance
with John Noakes and wondering who was looking after Jason the cat.
To say the least, today's children must be confused at the spectacle
of the girl who for millions epitomises wholesome values -- and the
creative use of washing up liquid bottles and sticky-backed plastic --
calling the numbers in a national game of bingo. In the days of Biddy
Baxter you knew that, if BP presenters recommended it, it was OK. She
recognised that, to millions of children, her presenters were more
influential than mum and dad.
So what are the messages which adult society is sending to its
children, particularly with reference to education? The one
justification for education which most parents drum into their offspring
is that, however unpleasant, it is a necessary preparation for getting a
job. Ask any child the point of getting a job and you will be told: ''To
make money.'' In other words, in a society in which amassing money is of
paramount importance, the educational process becomes nothing more than
a means to an end -- getting a job -- which is in itself a means to an
end -- making money.
For most people in our society, ''work'' means drudgery and is
something to be avoided if at all possible. The whole concept of
craftmanship, for example, has been eroded and undermined. A careers
teacher wanted to encourage one of her pupils who was thinking of
becoming a cabinetmaker. ''What would you like to make?'' she asked.
''About twenty thousand a year,'' he replied.
If education is to continue to have an influential place in society
then teachers must present an alternative agenda to the attitudes
engendered by our lottery-crazed culture. We must emphasise quaintly
old-fashioned sounding values like the love of learning for its own sake
and pride in performance as a way of counteracting the persuasive, but
fundamentally flawed, propaganda of materialism.
In the naive, materialistic equation: if money = happiness, then lots
of money = lots of happiness. But excessive wealth does not necessarily
bring excessive happiness. It can bring unwanted publicity, begging
letters, long-lost relations, security fences, isolation, lack of
purpose . . . disillusionment.
There are only two tragedies in life, someone once said, one is never
to get the desire of your heart and the other is to get the desire of
your heart. Perhaps the emptiness experienced by many who can have ''all
that they want'' is all the evidence we need that seeking material
prosperity has its limitations as a foundation on which to build one's
happiness.

CONFIRMATION that the confectionery and soft drinks giant is in
detailed merger talks with Dr Pepper/Seven Up sent Cadbury Schweppes
shares down 12p to 389p yesterday and to a new low for 1994-95.
If the talks are brought to a successful conclusion, then Cadbury
could end up paying about $1750m (#1100m) for the outstanding 77.3% of
the American company's total equity on the basis of an offer of the $33
a share which some analysts are predicting.
It envisages using a mixture of cash and equity and has warned
shareholders that it will raise about #500m through a rights issue.
Cadbury is anxious to assuage investor concerns after the poor share
price performance that it will not pay too much for Dr Pepper and
emphasised that it would only enter any business combination if the
effect on earnings would be no worse than broadly neutral in 1995,
before any reorganisation costs, and positive in 1996 onwards.
Also Cadbury would expect interest payments to be covered by operating
profits before interest charges above 4.5 times.
Dr Pepper is the third-largest soft drinks company in the US with an
11% market share compared with the 5% of Cadbury which increased, in
part, because of its 1993 #218m acquisition of A&amp;W Brands, best known
for root beer.
In 1993, the target achieved pre-tax profits of $96m, then #65m, on
sales of $707m (#478m). The figures for the first nine months of last
year show profits of $99.6m. One problem is that there is a deficit on
shareholder funds equivalent to around #225m which will have to be
charged against the Cadbury balance sheet on completion of the deal
while taking on debt totalling #560m.
Cadbury is expected to have increased its own 1994 full-year profits
from #416m to just under #500m so that the shares are selling at 12
times likely earnings.
In contrast, Dr Pepper appears to be trading at around 28 times
possible 1994 earnings so that the bidder is paying a very substantial
premium. But Cadbury has little choice if its does want to become an
even bigger player in the US market with the prospect of a 16% overall
share as well as the ability to exploit the brand names through its
existing international network.

Patrick Brogan reviews the life of Rose Kennedy, the reclusive
matriarch behind the clan that ruled America.
THERE are two, contradictory public impressions of Rose Kennedy. The
usual one is a likeness of Mother Theresa, a saintly figure, who has
suffered much and is therefore different from the rest of us. In the
other, she was cold and egotistical, wrapped up in her private devotion
to the Church and her public devotion to late Victorian propriety, who
denied her children the love they craved and thus contributed to the
many failures of their personal lives.
The second estimate, part of the general debunking of the Kennedy
legend, is doubtless overstated. After all, those of her children who
survived did well in life and compare very favourably with such
contemporary dynasties as the Churchills or the Windsors.
But there is truth to it, all the same. Nigel Hamilton, in his
biography of John Kennedy, one of the main revisionist texts, says of
her: ''She became devout in the deeply committed manner of her mother,
eschewing -- as had her mother -- the profession of her husband in order
to concentrate on religion and the 'proper' upbringing of her children .
. . She was like Andersen's Ice Maiden, concealing her frozen heart
beneath an exterior of courage and self-control.''
That she was devout is beyond question. She was born to the Boston
Irish, in 1890, when that ethnic group ruled the cities of the United
States as has none other since. Her father, ''Honey'' Fitzgerald, made
himself Congressman and then mayor of the city in a series of vicious
political fights with another Irish boss, Patrick Kennedy.
The Romeo and Juliet romance of Pat Kennedy's son, Joe, and Honey
Fitz's daughter, Rose, was the most independent event of her life: she
defied her father, and got away with it because his political career,
and his family authority, had just been destroyed by the most famous of
all Boston Irish crooks, John Michael Curley. He blackmailed Fitzgerald
out of a race for mayor in 1913 by threatening to reveal his affair with
a lady known as ''Toodles''.
Rose was educated in public life by her father, who used her as his
hostess in Boston and on trips to Europe, and in religious life in a
two-year stint in a convent in Belgium. Years later, she wrote that she
''looked back with thankfulness to God for having granted me the
occasion for shaping a lasting covenant with Him. Freed from all
distractions and from all worldly thoughts, I was able to find in myself
the place that was meant for God.''
Her children were therefore brought up by an authoritarian, bullying
father, and a saintly mother. That, probably, is why they always stuck
so closely together, finding in sibling affection the comfort their
parents never gave them.
The Kennedys and Fitzgeralds were despised by the Boston Brahmins.
Joe's entire life was devoted obsessively to getting even with them, and
repaying the snubs he endured in his youth.
Rose, too, was determined to win acceptance in WASP society, with
mixed success. Even when her son was President, the Palm Beach, Florida,
Social Register did not list the Kennedys, because they were nouveaux
riches, and Irish.
They had nine children, from Joe, born in 1915 to Edward (1933). Three
of the four sons were killed, Joe in the war, Jack and Bobby
assassinated. One of the daughters, Kathleen (Kick), was killed in a
plane crash and the eldest, Rosemary, was born retarded (in 1918) and
was lobotomised at the age of 23 and has lived in an asylum ever since.
Mrs Kennedy suffered further from her husband's ill- treatment. He
bullied her, ignored her, was away constantly and was constantly
unfaithful. In 1920, when she was 30, she left him and moved back with
her family. Joe Kennedy made no effort to win her back: it was her
father who told her she had made her bed and must lie in it, who sent
her home.
Honey Fitz and Pat Kennedy were small-time, local politicians. Joe
Kennedy was different. He was one of the most brilliant, unscrupulous
and (by today's standards) corrupt financiers of his age. He made money
on an enormous scale in the Roaring Twenties (and had the wit to get out
of the stock market before the 1929 crash), and from the start had
national political ambitions.
The Irish were Democrats, of course, and Kennedy used his wealth to
buy influence with the party. He once told Henry Luce, publisher of Time
magazine, that it would be easy to buy a seat in Congress, and was
astonished when Luce replied that he wouldn't know how.
Joe Kennedy knew how. Roosevelt made him chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, where he briskly outlawed many of the methods
that he had used himself to become rich, and then ambassador to London,
in 1938.
It was a brilliant and important position. Rose loved staying at
Windsor and dining at Buckingham Palace: the English aristocracy was not
nearly so snobbish as the American one. The elder children loved it,
too.
Jack, then 22, discovered a life-long interest in foreign affairs, of
both sorts. Kick married the Marquess of Hartington, heir to the Duke of
Devonshire. He was killed on the Western Front four months later and
when she was killed in a plane crash in 1948, she was buried at
Chatsworth.
Rose disapproved bitterly of the marriage, because Hartington was
Protestant and insisted that their children should be brought up in the
Church of England -- and Kick agreed.
But the Kennedys' time in London is memorable because Joe Kennedy was
a convinced appeaser and supporter of Neville Chamberlain. He admired
Hitler and Mussolini, though not at all a fascist: he was an America
First isolationist and was finally fired by an exasperated Roosevelt.
That ended Joe's political aspirations, so he then concentrated on his
sons. The greatest tragedy in his life was the loss of his eldest son,
Joe Jr, killed on a bombing mission in 1944.
The Kennedy family is famous because the second son, Jack, then became
heir to Joe's paternal ambitions. He proved a brilliant politician, as
he had been a genuine war hero, elected to Congress in 1946, to the
Senate in 1950 and the Presidency in 1960. Joe and Rose had a last
moment of glory when JFK was inaugurated, just 34 years ago.
Joe asserted his authority one last time after Jack's victory, when
his son the President and his son the attorney-general (Robert) doubted
the wisdom of putting up their young brother, Edward, to take the family
Senate seat in Massachusetts. It had to be kept warm for him by an old
retainer until he was old enough, and Joe insisted: ''Now it's Teddy's
turn.'' In due course, when he reached 30, Edward Kennedy became senator
(he was re-elected last November).
The Kennedys are the only family in history which has had three
brothers in the Senate. At her death, Rose had one senator, two
congressmen, the lieutenant-governor of Maryland and a state assembly
woman from the same state among her descendants. There are 28 living
grandchildren (one grandson died of a drug overdose) and many
great-grandchildren.
Joe had a stroke that incapacitated him completely in 1961. He died in
1968, after his third son was killed in Los Angeles. When Joe Kennedy
dropped from sight, so did Rose.

Tomorrow evening Scotland's best-known detective will make his final
exit. Taggart, the programme, will return later this year but when it
does Taggart, the character, will be dead. With a little help from Glenn
Chandler, the creator of the series, and a wild stretch of the
imagination, Allan Laing offers an affectionate tribute to the old
curmudgeon.
DETECTIVE Inspector Jim Taggart came to the public's attention on a
winter's night in 1983 when he walked down the stairs of his
semi-detached house, wearing only a towelling dressing gown with the
words ''Big Daddy'' emblazoned on the back. It was the start of a
brilliant career. More than 30 murder cases followed -- and he solved
every one. Some cops would commit murder for that track record.
There are many ironies surrounding the life of Strathclyde's most
famous detective but the greatest is the fact that, in his early years,
he could well have strayed into a life of serious villainy. Indeed, were
it not for the intervention of an old beat copper in the city's East
End, he would probably have ended up in the pokey.
Taggart was born in 1937, the son of a Corporation tram driver. The
family lived in the second floor of a tenement in Springburn, now
demolished, and his mother used to take in washing to supplement the
meagre weekly income.
As a youth growing up in a tough neighbourhood, he fell into bad
company and became something of a tearaway. He got involved in petty
crime -- pinching hub caps from cars and selling them to scrappies,
shoplifting Jimmy Shand records to order from Woolworth's in Dennistoun.
In those days the East End was like a village and it wasn't long
before Taggart's parents were made aware of his nefarious activities.
They engaged the help of a local police constable who took the youngster
aside. ''I've got the very cure for you, my lad,'' he said, grabbing the
boy by the ear and marching him off to the City of Glasgow Police Boxing
Club.
The young Taggart, a small, wiry lad with a chip the size of the Grand
Canyon on his shoulder, was at first reluctant to participate. He wanted
to be out on the streets and up to no good with his pals. But the old
copper persisted and the youngster was eventually persuaded to take to
the ring. He turned out to be a reasonable lightweight with a mean left
hook.
It was through his association with the boxing club that he began to
rub shoulders with police officers. By the time he was 18 he had decided
to join the force. He signed up a year later -- just squeezing past the
5ft 8ins height limit. The young Taggart spent the next three years
pounding a uniform beat, first in Partick, and then in Maryhill.
It was during this period that Jean walked into his life. He met her
at the dancing in the old Plaza Ballroom. And she turned out to be more
than a Saturday night lumber. They started going out together (she came
from Bearsden so she called it courting; he came from Springburn so he
called it winching) and they married within months.
It was the perfect marriage -- she spoke and he didn't -- and a year
later Jean became pregnant. However, while giving birth to their only
child, Allison, she suffered paralysis. This meant that Taggart would
never have the chance to have the son he wanted. Mind you, he doted on
Allison who grew up to become a nurse and was last heard of working as a
sister in a hospital in Manchester.
Jean, of course, had to come to terms with the fact that she would be
confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life. It did not prevent
her getting on in life. She was always a busy woman -- horse-riding for
the disabled and taking parties of disabled people to the theatre. She
stood for election as an MP on the disabled rights platform. She even
wrote a book, Sex Life for the Disabled.
Taggart, meanwhile, threw himself into his police work. He may have
appeared grim, dour, and deeply unpleasant to those who didn't know him
but to his friends he was -- well -- grim, dour, and deeply unpleasant.
These personality traits, of course, made him perfect material for the
CID. He was an old-fashioned copper, the last of a breed. Good, solid,
detective work earned him a reputation for solving difficult cases. He
was promoted first to detective sergeant and then to inspector, always
working from the Maryhill Division.
In 1983 he stepped into the limelight when Scottish Television, like a
fly-on-the-wall, followed the progress of his investigation into the
gruesome murder of a young woman (a running theme through the bulk of
his most celebrated cases).
This coincided with the start of his enduring partnership with
Sergeant Livingston, a po-faced, marbles-in-the-mouth youngster in a car
coat and university scarf. It was hate at first sight for Taggart.
Livingston was everything he was not -- he was young, he was from
Edinburgh, he'd gone to public school and to university, and Taggart
believed he had risen through the ranks because of his degree rather
than any proven ability as a detective.
Livingston was eventually to leave the police force, though he
reappeared some years later as a consultant for a private security firm.
Taggart got on, if not like a house on fire, then at least a wee bit
better with Livingston's eventual replacement, DS Mike Jardine. Though
he lightened up in later years (and even developed something of a sense
of humour) Taggart was always feared by junior officers who were
intimidated by his reputation for being a hard man. Actually, he played
on that image. He became the myth that surrounded him. People came to
expect to be put down by him.
He was an affectionate luddite, a man who scoffed at modern police
methods like ''psychological profiles'' and turned his nose up at events
like Glasgow's Year of Culture
And yet, deep down Jim Taggart was a pussy cat. Inside that hard
copper exterior was a big softie trying to get out. He had a very
compassionate side to him. In the investigation which became known as
The Nest of Vipers case it was disclosed that over many years he had
often returned to see the mother of a murdered girl whose body had never
been recovered.
But it will be his remarkable investigative skills for which he will
best be remembered. No matter how many characters, how many suspects,
how many red herrings entered each case, Jim Taggart was always able to
unravel the mystery and point the finger of guilt at the wee bus driver
who was only in it for a minute during the first episode.
He will be sadly missed.

In the aftermath of the Anderson Country debacle, Ian Bell argues that
the influence of the Radio 4 community is disproportionate to their
numbers.
IN 1988 an 84-year-old woman was arrested in the foyer of Broadcasting
House in London, having committed what many Radio 4 listeners would
pardon as a crime of passion. Provoked beyond reason by mediocre long
wave reception, granny had shot a commissionaire with an air pistol. As
one does.
There are any number of reasons for wanting to put a BBC employee out
of his misery, but the octogenarian hit-matron was demonstrating one of
the abiding truths of British life, learned the hard way by facile
politicians, vogueish producers, windy mandarins, and hapless
presenters: you trifle with the Cult of LW 198kHz, 1515m, at your peril.
Long before the cyberspace generation, radio was the real virtual
community. Its speech, its mores, and that odd, enforced intimacy
conjured out of thin, whispering air bred a national cohesiveness unseen
before or since. People got their news, views, and attitudes, their very
standards of speech, from the BBC. If they said it on the wireless it
must be true.
Reithian broadcasting was a public service for the public's own good.
It sought to inform, to educate, to improve and -- in the best possible
taste -- to entertain. In times of national disaster or rejoicing the
BBC was there, a tribal voice as reassuring as sterling or a force 8
over Dogger. Britain had the best broadcasting service in the world --
the BBC said so.
Not least among the Corporation's achievements was to write the class
system into the schedules. For 40 years it seemed that the Home Counties
bourgeoisie comprised the only gene pool in the land capable of
producing suitable broadcasters. News readers may not actually have worn
full evening dress, but until relatively recently -- and even now on the
World Service -- the mind's eye glimpsed a decent cove laying aside a
briar pipe and taking bulletin in hand amid the susurrations of tweed on
cavalry twill. And that was just the women.
Only a preeningly self-conscious institution could, for example, have
come up with the Advisory Committee on Spoken English and imposed on a
country boiling with linguistic life the zombie speech of ''Southern
Educated Standard'', otherwise RP, spoken by less than 5% of the
population. In the words of the committee's secretary, its task was
nothing less than ''the preservation of mutual intelligibility
throughout the English-speaking world''.
Like the empire, the old BBC has gone, swept away by social change,
''commercial pressures'', and technocratic tinkering, but an odd
phenomenon has taken place in the transition. The Corporation itself may
have disowned its past in the frenzy of Birtism: listeners, or at least
the audience of Radio 4, have not.
It is the people who protect standards now, and they are most wary of
change. Their enemy, paradoxically, is the BBC itself; their greatest
vice a nostalgia for an England which never existed outside the minutes
of the advisory committee. In the endless campaigns, controversies, and
petitions, there is the sense that Radio 4 listeners are intent on
saving the BBC from itself. The silent majority has taken to thundering.
Reith did his work better than he knew.
They want to move 4 to FM? Uproar. Uproot Woman's Hour from its
afternoon slot? Heresy. Mr Birt is infatuated with ''rolling news''? The
stocks. Lose Gardeners' Question Time? A scandal. Atheists on Thought
for the Day? Perdition. Broaden the ''audience base''? Let them eat
Radio 5.
And what's this? Some Irishman is dragging the station downmarket? The
Suburban Yeomanry will fall upon Anderson Country and gouge it from the
schedules.
It isn't a joke. Part of the phenomenon is disagreeable -- Gerry
Anderson's accent was as offensive to some as anything he said -- but
part of it is a wholly honourable refusal to allow the BBC to renege on
its responsibilities. In a world of ''shock jocks'', moronic phone-ins,
and the banalities of Birtism, the Radio 4 community is an island,
albeit somewhat self-regarding, of sanity. As with the old BBC, we have
their word for it.
Their influence is disproportionate to their numbers. It is barely an
exaggeration to say that when the Today presenter Brian Redhead died a
year ago a nation mourned. The millions who had never listened to his
programme learned what a great man he had been. Equally, when the latest
row erupts, the press rushes to cover issues to which it would not, were
any other institution involved, give the time of day.
Yet there is good reason. While Radio 1 flounders, 4 goes from
strength to strength. Its 8.75m listeners, two-thirds of them ABC1s,
comprise the sort of audience advertisers would kill for. Today, pulling
in 1.87m of the educated and (allegedly) opinion-forming between 7 and
9am, outdoes Wogan on 2 (1.6m), was trouncing Steve Wright on 1 (1.56m),
and leaves the rest -- Virgin 1215 (390,000); Atlantic 252 (380,000);
Classic FM (290,000); Radio 5 Live (260,000); and Radio 3 (110,000) --
all but talking to themselves.
In other words, a serious news magazine has wider appeal than any rock
show. Today is simply the most popular breakfast programme in Britain.
Politicians know it and Liz Forgan, poached from Channel 4 by John
Birt to run BBC radio, also knows it. Most of all, Radio 4 listeners
know it.
Rarely have consumers been quite so conscious of their power, or so
quick to use it. They are ''super-served'' and they know it.
Yet Aberdeenshire-raised Jim Naughtie has recalled that when he first
joined the show the mail he attracted because of his accent was not so
different from that which helped destroy Anderson last week. Reviewers
praise the ''personal chemistry'' between Naughtie, penetrating Peter
Hobday, incisive John Humphrys, and eloquent Sue MacGregor, but the
team's real achievement is the grip they maintain over the most
truculent audience anywhere.
There was nothing wrong with Anderson's audience figures, for example,
yet it was another Radio 4 show (Chris Dunkley's Feedback) that
listeners forged into the cannon which blew the award-winning Irishman
away.
Devotees of Radio 4, it often seems, have a clearer idea of what the
station should be than any BBC manager, and no amount of producer choice
flannel will suffice if listeners switch on in the morning and detect
anything whatever is amiss.
The row which broke at the weekend over religious broadcasting was, in
those terms, a classic. Birt -- whose only input into radio thus far has
been support for the ludicrous rolling news ''Scud FM'' concept -- has a
report on his desk which, says the hierarchy, aims to augment his vapid
Extending Choice manifesto. Radio 4's middle-class hardcore don't
believe a word of it, and conclude that the real aim is to marginalise
Christianity.
Thus, when it was announced that Morning Service (with an audience of
one million) is to be suspended for a month for the second year running
to make way for Were You There, the Church of England (Radio 4 at
prayer, as it were) pounded on the decision as a ''serious lapse of
responsibility''.
But responsibility to whom? Four's most dedicated listeners often give
the impression of belonging to a white, Christian, patriotic
preservation society.
Meanwhile, the Rev Ernest Rea, head of religious broadcasting, has
been pondering whether to allow humanists access to that slot, and yet
again there has been an outcry, presumably because humanists don't
think. It is impossible to avoid the thought, on this or any other day,
that the cult of Radio 4 is quintessentially English: it treasures
speech and culture (from Kaleidoscope to a Book at Bedtime); it takes
important issues seriously; and it knows its own mind. The problem is
that its mind is sometimes small and too often parochial.
Yet flick through the schedules and you see evidence of qualities rare
in a raucous, instantly gratified broadcasting world. Radio 4 is worth
preserving because it could not be replaced. Besides, alongside an
audience that knows its own mind there is a BBC hierarchy that appears
to think only rarely, and with difficulty.

NORTHERN Electric yesterday called for the #1200m bid from Trafalgar
House to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as the
best way of safeguarding customers' interests. In its formal defence
letter, it compared its own growth record in share price, earnings and
dividends in stark contrast to Trafalgar. But chairman David Morris and
fellow directors stand to make around #2m if Trafalgar succeeds with its
1048p cash offer because of their options. Some have an exercise price
as low as 175p. However, he insisted that Trafalgar's assertion that the
bid offers full value is wide of the mark. After allowing for 200p, the
estimate of Trafalgar's advisers Swiss Bank Corporation of the worth of
Northern's holding in the National Grid, the residual 848p a share value
of the underwritten cash offer indicates a takeout price of just 10.1
times earnings. But asked why he and other directors had sold Northern
shares in August at no more than 706p, Mr Morris could only answer that
it was done for personal reasons. He said Trafalgar's undertakings for
the future of Northern's distribution business were inadequate. Mr
Morris also said the Offer regulator should not rely on undertakings
which are unenforceable. In reply to Mr Morris, Trafalgar said
Northern's past profitability has little relevance to the future because
its profits will have to be generated in a stricter regulatory
environment.

PRESSURE for a rise in interest rates next week grew stronger
yesterday after a set of robust growth figures added to last week's
inflation concerns.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, could face a demand
for a half-point increase in base rates to 6.75% from the Governor of
the Bank of England, Eddie George, when the two men meet next Thursday.
Gross domestic product grew by 0.8% in the fourth quarter of last
year, the same rate as in the third. Excluding oil and gas, the rate
slowed from 0.8% to 0.7%.
The year-on-year growth rate edged down a fraction from 4.1% in the
third quarter to 4.0% after hitting 4.3% in the second quarter.
For the whole of 1994 the economy grew at 4%, its fastest pace for six
years. The figures were in line with the Budget forecast, and the
Treasury said that growth in the fourth quarter was becoming more
sustainable than in the first half of last year.
But the economy is growing at well beyond its historic trend rate of
2.25% amid clear signs that inflation is starting to pick up at the
factory gate and retail levels.
If the Governor decides that a further rise in rates is needed to
avert over-heating, the Chancellor could upset financial markets if he
rejected the advice. City pundits fear the consequences of a decision to
postpone a rate hike until the Bank of England inflation report is
published on February 8.
City economists had looked for a further slowdown in the pace of
activity between the third and fourth quarters. But it did not
materialise despite mild weather depressing demand for energy and
clothing and footwear.
The GDP figures, which are published by the Central Statistical
Office, are only a preliminary estimate at this stage, and, therefore,
subject to subsequent revision as more detailed information becomes
available.
The CSO said the output of the service sector increased by 0.6%,
similar to the third quarter. The distribution trades sported 0.7%
growth, but there was a slowdown in industrial production.
Signs last week that retail sales were rising despite accelerating
inflation and that unemployment was falling sharply resulted in City
opinion switching in favour of a rate increase in February instead of
waiting until March.
Later today the CBI quarterly trends survey will provide up-to-date
information on manufacturers' price expectations and capacity, the final
piece of the jigsaw before the crucial meeting between the Treasury and
the Bank of England.
British consumers have shaken off their post-Budget gloom and are
feeling better about their household finances, according to a Gallup
survey yesterday day for the European Commission.
They are also more positive about the general economic situation.
However, pessimists still outnumber optimists on both counts.
According to the poll, 19% of those questioned felt their financial
position would get better over the next 12 months against 29% who feared
it would get worse.
The difference between the two figures, minus 10%, compares with minus
22% in December and is only 2% below the highest figure recorded last
year.
The public's view on the general economic situation has shown a
similar reversal with a balance of minus 4% expecting it to deteriorate
compared with 20% last month.
Gallup said the figures showing confidence returning to pre-Budget
levels suggesting last month's poor results were a ''knee-jerk''
reaction to the Chancellor's statement.

CSC, a crop protection company based in Perth, has been bought from
Shell in a management buy-in thought to be worth around #5m.
The purchase, backed by #1.75m in equity finacing from the Glasgow
office of the 3i investment capital company, is led by Arthur Watt who
resigned six months ago from his post as chief executive of James
Wilkes. He left when the Yorkshire mini-conglomerate was taken over by
Suter.
The deal also marks the end of Shell's involvement with
agro-chemicals.
Founded almost 50 years ago by a group of Perthshire farmers, CSC now
supplies herbicides, insecticides and fungicides from 10 depots ranging
from Elgin in the north and Stockton-on-Tees in England.
It is also one of Europe's biggest spraying contractors, providing a
spraying service with 36 mobile units across the country. Turnover last
year totalled #17m.
Mr Watt is returning to his north-eastern roots in taking over the
company which was run by Shell for the past 16 years. His substantial
personal investment and the 3i equity stake are supported by funding
from the Bank of Scotland.
''CSC offers an excellent service and its recent development of a
technical advice side further enhances its dominant market position,''
he said yesterday. ''In particular we plan to continue extending our
product range and expanding our customer base into new market areas.''
Most of the company's business is generated along the east coast and
Mr Watt clearly wants to expand westwards and deeper into England. He
was one of a select band of highly-experienced executives on 3i's books
as a likely candidate -- available and with the necessary capital -- to
head a buy-in of a suitable company.
''Arthur Watt brings considerable experience in growing businesses to
a company which already has a committed management team,'' 3i's George
MacRitchie said.

Tokyo, Monday -- Share prices dived nearly 6% and the yen weakened as
last week's earthquake sent growing shockwaves through the Japanese
economy.
But private economists said investor worries were probably overdone.
The key Nikkei share average plunged 1054, or 5.60%, to 17,785, its
lowest in more than a year.
As shares slid, the yen also fell against the dollar and the mark. The
dollar climbed to around 100.15 yen, its highest level since October
1993.
Analysts said investors had three main fears -- that earthquake damage
would balloon well beyond initial estimates, that the fallout would
cause tremors in Japan's already debt-ridden financial sector, and that
a long-sought economic recovery would not materialise as soon as had
been hoped.
Tadayo Homma, the Bank of Japan branch manager from Kobe's neighbour
city of Osaka, gave an unusually explicit and negative assessment of the
economic impact of the earthquake. ''It is inevitable that negative
effects on Japan's economic recovery will emerge from the earthquake in
many respects,'' he said.
He said the central bank saw no risk, yet, that Japan's financial
system would collapse. ''There has been no major, systemic risk to the
Japanese financial system so far,'' he said.
Foreign investors have become particularly jittery. ''Foreigners are
concerned. They look at the Los Angeles earthquake and remember how
badly everybody got the damage estimatewrong,'' said David Threadgold,
financial analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd (Securities) Japan.
''All the initial estimates were so wide of the mark that . . . people
are just prepared to add another nought on the end of existing
estimates,'' he said.
Economists said last week that the earthquake would dampen economic
growth in the first one or two quarters of the calendar year but was
likely to bolster growth thereafter as demand rose on the back of
reconstruction efforts.
Today, many clung to that general view, although some said it could
take longer before any positive impact emerged.

<HEADLINE>IBM triples its earnings</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980205774</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Armonk (New York), Monday -- International Business Machines
Corporation said it more than tripled its profits in the fourth quarter
to $1200m, providing proof that its restructuring effort has paid off.
However, it cited concerns over weakness in its personal computer
business.
The strong results, which compared with $362m a year earlier, were far
above Wall Street analysts' forecasts and helped IBM to record its first
full-year profit in four years.
IBM chairman Louis Gerstner said the company has completed ''the
bulk'' of the restructuring launched when he took over two years ago.
''We cut expenses by $3500m and we have completed nearly 80% of our
$8000m expense reduction goal. We finished the year with more than $10bn
in cash and our cash flow from operations was strong despite significant
restructuring payments.''
The company's stock dropped $1.50 to $73.875, as Wall Street showed
initial disappointment over the personal computer outlook.
''We enter 1995 with the bulk of our right-sizing behind us,''
Gerstner said in a statement accompanying the results. ''Efforts are
well under way worldwide to re-engineer virtually every part of the
company.''
Fourth-quarter revenue was $19.9bn, an increase of 6.6% from the 1993
period, after adjusting for the sale of the IBM's Federal Systems
Company.
The quarterly earnings, equal to $2.06 a share, surpassed the $1.40 to
$1.93 industry experts had expected.
The strong results boosted IBM's profit for the year to $3000m, or
$4.92 per share, compared with a 1993 loss of $96m, or 25 cents per
share. Both figures exclude the sale of FSC.
Annual revenues climbed 6% to $64.1bn from $60.4bn.
IBM said demand in the quarter was generally strong across its product
line, especially for its mainframe computers and storage products.
However, it said it was disappointed by the weakness in its personal
computer business.
''Actions to improve the competitiveness of this unit are continuing
on an aggressive schedule,'' Mr Gerstner said. ''These actions include
the consolidation of development activities and simplification of our PC
product line.''
IBM said fourth-quarter growth was strongest in its Asian and European
markets.
Revenue from Europe was $7600m in the period, up 8% from a year
earlier.

WESTSCOT Homes, the Glasgow-based assured tenancy company currently
facing a liquidation call from a group of dissident shareholders, is now
on the receiving end of a surprise, rival takeover bid.
The bid, from Neill Clerk Residential, a unit trust vehicle managed by
Neill Clerk Capital, appears to have been triggered by The Herald's
first public airing of the problems at Westscot, on January 15.
The bid offers Westscot's 330 shareholders units in Neill Clerk
equivalent to #1.26 a share. Last night the Westscot board, led by
former Stakis director John Loughray, issued a non-commital statement,
calling the offer ''one of a number of proposals the board is
considering''.
Westscot's shareholders paid #1.25 a share when the company was
launched, under the Business Expansion Scheme, back in 1988. But, under
BES rules, each investor could claim tax relief -- 40% in the case of
top rate taxpayers -- on the cost of their investment, up to a ceiling
of #40,000. Westscot's current net asset value is said to be 132p a
share.
Under the terms of the Neill Clerk bid, Westscot shareholders will be
able to convert their new units into cash within two months of Neill
Clerk gaining 100% control. But, thanks to a series of discount clauses
in the offer, anyone selling their entire holding as quickly as that
would receive only 96p a share.
Neill Clerk points out that the offer is still 6p a share more than
the last recorded matched bargain in Westscot shares, completed last
October at 90p a share. Shareholders wishing to retain their investment,
in the form of the new units, would also be able to do so.
Westscot is already facing a resolution from nine significant
shareholders, controlling about 14% of the shares, to liquidate the
company and sell its 42 residential properties. That resolution, which
is being resisted by the Westscot board, is to be considered at an
extraordinary general meeting on February 3.
The Neill Clerk offer is conditional on that move being rejected.
Neill Clerk Capital's chief executive, Ross Macdonald, met two Westscot
directors, Euan Wallace and Philip Dry, on August 16 last year to
discuss a proposal similar to the bid now tabled.
That preliminary discussion faced two problems. Some Westscot
shareholders had not yet held their shares for the minimum five-year
period needed to qualify for full tax relief. And Neill Clerk Capital's
directors still regarded themselves as being some way from being able to
form the necessary unit trust. There were no subsequent discussions.
In their statement last night the Westscot board said: ''It was one of
a number of proposals we looked at in recent months. But they (Neill
Clerk representatives) did not come back to us as they had not cleared
several technical hurdles.''
Neill Clerk Capital itself spun out of the well-known Greenock and
Glasgow-based legal firm. The company promoted Norcity Homes, the first
assured tenancy BES company launched in the UK in 1988. Many other
similar issues followed.

SCOTTISH Metropolitan has sold a #30m 9.9% first mortgage debenture
stock dated 2020 to the Bank of Scotland. Half was issued yesterday and
the other #15m will be transferred at the end of the financial year on
August 15.
The attraction of the single placing to the property company is that
it saves on charges by avoiding a Stock Exchange listing. There is an
existing #60m 10[1/4]% mortgage stock 2016 outstanding.
Managing director Scott Cairns (above) said the board had been working
furiously to complete the deal as they were anxious to lock in long-term
finance as soon as possible. All the short-term facilities expire in
1996 which could be an election year with all the uncertainty that
entails.
ScotMet has also replaced #57.6m of facilities with six banks, with
#40m of committed lending from the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds
Bank.
The two Scottish banks have also arranged new overdraft facilities of
#10m so that there is now well over #50m available for acquisitions.

desalination plants in Lebanon. The state-run projects, worth #330m to
the Italian-German consortium in charge of construction, are at coastal
sites near Tripoli and Saida. Weir Westgarth, which is organising the
contract for the Glasgow-based company, will provide a range of heating

A FRIEND of a friend, preparing to go to work on Thursday morning,
idly picked up his Herald. There, on the front page, he learned he had
lost his job. Management at Rolls-Royce's East Kilbride plant, an hour
later, failed to explain to him or 599 colleagues why they had been left
to hear their fate from the press. But they were pleasantly informed
that, should they obtain alternative employment before the deadline for
redundancy terms, they would receive not a penny.
Outside the office block of Lewis Offshore Limited, Stornoway, is a
neat tarmacadam car park. But beside it stands a ferocious sign: ''THIS
CAR PARK IS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL ONLY. WORKERS' PARKING IS TO
THE RIGHT.'' And to the right is a large, muddy, waterlogged, pot-holed
area, unmetalled, unlevelled, where most of the men who actually do the
work at Arnish must leave their cars.
For several years now one has seethed at the cynical treatment of
eager graduates by a prominent Scottish broadcasting company. They are
hired on the basis of one-year contracts, worked ferociously for 12
months on grotty pay, and then dumped. The company, under present
employment legislation, needs no excuse to dismiss them and, by the law
of the land, owes them nothing. New graduates, of course, work very hard
and come extremely cheap.
Another prominent Scottish broadcasting company, however, has now
capped this. I am told that this concern happily hires graduates on
one-month contracts. Word has obviously spread of the considerable
economic advantages in treating employees like disposable razors.
We have become a slave state.
British workers now work harder for longer hours, on poorer pay, than
those of any comparable country in the western world. The past 15 years
have seen the abolition of most of the legislation that once protected
employees. To qualify for what were once standard workers' rights --
entitlement to unemployment benefit, the power to take an unfair
dismissal claim to an industrial tribunal -- one must now have worked in
the same job, full time, for a minimum of two years. The idea of a
national minimum wage is a distant memory. Something as simple as a
written contract is now unusual in many walks of life.
Underlying this, of course, is the reality of mass unemployment. The
degree of this is hard to ascertain; when I last heard, the Tory
Government had changed the counting rules no fewer than 24 times, and I
dare say they have improved on that since. But it is now clear that, at
any given time, between three and four million people in Britain are
without work.
There are two things to say about this. First, it demonstrates a major
shift in public polity. Twenty-five years ago, such a jobless figure
would have been unthinkable; more, it would have been politically
unacceptable. (Edward Heath panicked, and reversed major planks of
policy, when unemployment threatened to reach half a million.) Second,
mass unemployment on this scale is a social evil which should never be
minimised.
Mass unemployment condemns an entire generation to despair. It creates
a permanent underclass, increasingly alienated from society as a whole
and accepted community values in particular. It blasts entire tracts of
the nation -- Lanarkshire, Tyneside, Merseyside -- into impoverished,
ugly wasteland. It is unquestionably a factor in rising levels of crime,
illness, suicide, addiction, and family breakdown. Contrary to Tory
perception, a growing class with minimal spending power is bad for the
economy as a whole. And it is very bad news for anyone in work.
The greater the level of unemployment, the more an employer has the
whip-hand. If 200 people are out there slavering for your job in a
meat-packing plant, and he knows it, and you are but an uncontracted
worker -- or a part-time worker, or ''moonlighting'' for him while
simultaneously claiming welfare benefits, or if you have been packing
his chopped and shaped pig for less than two years -- then you are at
his mercy.
Being sacked may be the least of your worries. What if you are a woman
and he decides he likes to grope you now and again? What if the
pay-packet comes a little short each week? What if the deadly
razor-edged machinery comes without guards, the plant is ill-ventilated,
the fire escapes are chained shut against vandals, or your colleagues as
one decide to mock your religion, your speech impediment or the colour
of your skin? Who would make a fuss? Would you?
A friend of mine was sacked from his computer job because he had been
ill a little too long in a post he had held not quite long enough. He
was sacked from his second job, a telesales post with a major financial
institution, as part of a bloc of newly hired employees who had finished
their first month and made the company a great deal of money. (The
company, one suspsects, did this routinely.) He was sacked from his
third job, selling portable computers, because the second-in-command
didn't like his face. He was sacked from his fourth job -- salesman in a
golf shop -- because the boss challenged him, in front of others, to see
who could sell more golf clubs in a week.
My friend won. He was given his cards on the spot by the humiliated
manager.
I mentioned women in the work place. This is a new and chilling
development. There are two aspects to this. One is the very old
tradition of working class ''sweated'' labour. Women from a poor
background have long been willing to accept dirty, hard, underpaid work
to keep body and soul and children together. Happy to work part-time,
especially if they are single parents, and reluctant to make a fuss
(particularly if they have been raised in an environment of drunkenness
and abuse) they are model slaves. They make much nicer, and more
malleable, employees than men.
The new development is that of the white-collar, double-income
household: a typical example would be Tony and Cherie Blair. He is a
high-flying politician; she, one gathers, a high-flying barrister. The
Blairs have a young family but they both work full time. Between them
they gather pots of money and, no doubt, they enjoy a very high standard
of living. But Cherie Blair's happy career -- and here, I am afraid, I
must be very unfashionable -- comes at a cost. The Blair children are
denied the full attention and energy of their mother. And somewhere down
the line, a young male lawyer is denied a job and a family is denied a
breadwinner.
Why, I wonder, should the Blairs occupy two jobs, and wallow in money,
when another family is denied one job and are hard put to make ends
meet? Would it not be wiser for educated, successful middle-class people
to accept a lower standard of living and make do with one income? Then
mother could invest all her formidable gifts in raising happy and
well-adjusted children, and find alternative satisfaction in worthwhile
and non-acquisitive ways -- social involvement, charity work, writing,
the arts.
This is the world of the free market and it is a con into which we
have all, in some ways bought. We demand as a right the freedom to earn
as much money as possible. We never seem able to reach that point when
we think we earn quite enough money. Nor do we seem to realise how, in
burning ourselves out in the work-place, we may be missing out in whole
areas of life more important than earning a living. What is the point in
having children if you are not around to enjoy them?
Worst of all, we expect others to pay the price, the others we crush
in the urban jungle so that we can acquire the second car, the holiday
cottage, the continental vacation and the Filipino nanny. Thus we have
reached this point: untrammelled capitalism, its powers and prerogatives
protected by the machinations of a nasty political elite, and the
agencies protecting the poor and uncapitalised -- such as trades unions
-- out manoeuvred in the High Court and restricted by law.
Capitalism, to continue happily, must be tempered with traditional
Christian values -- a concern for justice, a regard for human dignity, a
sense of fair play. Today these stand at a discount. Six hundred men
must be sacked for the sake of fattening further an already obese profit
margin. Sir Cedric Brown must have his obscene pay rise, even if the
price is mass redundancy below, the trimming of bonuses on the shop
floor and the hiking of gas bills to little old ladies.
Welcome to slave-ship Britain. And watch out for Spartacus.

GLAXO has already secured the backing of the Wellcome Trust for its
blockbuster #9000m bid, Britain's biggest ever, for fellow drugs group
Wellcome.
This means it effectively has 39.5% of the company under its belt
giving it a flying start should the Wellcome board, which was presented
with the offer first thing yesterday morning, decide to fight or seek a
white knight.
Either way, it will almost certainly trigger off fresh activity in the
industry as other international companies react to increased
competition. Up to now vertical integration deals have been more the
format in the industry.
The merger would make the combined group the world's largest in its
field, leapfrogging Merck &amp; Company Inc.
Yesterday, Wellcome was digesting the offer and advised shareholders
to take no action. But the company has been the subject of bid
speculation for some time and Glaxo does look to be in a commanding
position.
Whether the rationale is right only time will tell but certainly there
are massive savings to be made on the research activities by a merger of
two companies. The merged company would be called Glaxo Wellcome and
Wellcome Trust would have a 4.7% stake.
Terms of the offer are #722 cash plus 47 new Glaxo shares for every
100 Wellcome shares, valuing them at just over 1000p each with Glaxo at
599p, down 43[1/2]p. Wellcome shares spurted 273p to 961p. It means that
Wellcome would be bowing out at 23.1 times historical earnings after
excluding exceptional items. Glaxo's #2000m of cash will go and its
level borrowings will increase significantly.
The market perception of the bid was that it was largely about
cost-cutting but there was also some concern yesterday about trends in
sales of top drugs with Glaxo revealing that sales of Zantac declined
slightly in the second half of 1994 and Wellcome's anti-herpes drug
Zovirax runs out of patent in the US in April 1997. But Glaxo chief
executive Sir Richard Sykes stressed yesterday that new products would
be out in the coming years to take up the slack.
Sir Richard described the proposed takeover as ''driven by disease
management''. Glaxo's case for acquiring Wellcome, which added to
Glaxo's 3.9% world market share will take the combined total to 5.1%, is
mostly based on getting rid of duplication and becoming a bigger force
in the market place.
It argues that strong growth in demand for medicines coupled with
public expenditure constraints are leading to pressures on health
budgets and consequential margin pressures for the industry. Growth of
managed healthcare means that patient access to prescription medicines
is becoming more closely controlled by powerful buying groups and
healthcare providers, particularly in the US. Also the growing
importance of investment in cellulor and molecular biological research
is increasing research and development costs.
Glaxo says that what is needed is strong positioning in a
consolidating global industry, breadth of therapeutic coverage, critical
mass in research and development and continuing investment in new
technologies. There is a need infrastructure and resources to maximise
product development efficiency and ensure rapid penetration of products
on an international scale as well as effective cost management and
streamlining of resources.
Few would argue with this assessment in the present climate. But
whether taking it to its logical conclusion means absorbing Wellcome in
particular is the answer will only show up in time. Wellcome has,
though, lost its way somewhat in the past few years and seen a high
turnover of top management.
Glaxo certainly sees it that way. The merged group would, it says,
mean broader therapeutic coverage and product complementarity, potential
for improved access to healthcare providers and patients as disease
management systems develop, and improved innovation prospects in
research and development.
Perhaps the most obvious feature would be the significant
opportunities to achieve operational efficiencies. Glaxo has 45,000
employees. It has manufacturing facilities in 32 countries and research
capabilities in eight. Wellcome employs 17,000 and its main
manufacturing and research and development operation are in the UK and
the US. Substantial redundancies would seem inevitable in the merged
group.
Leaving aside provisions for integration costs, which cannot yet be
predicted, the acquisition is expected to enhance earnings per share as
the enlarged group benefits from improved sales performance and
operational efficiencies.

A BUOYANT retailing performance and tight management helped John
Menzies sail through ''very difficult'' trading conditions to record a
16% increase in interim profits.
The Edinburgh-based group, which is currently coming to terms with
radical changes in the key area of newspaper distribution, reported a 5%
like-for-like increase in retail sales during the Christmas run-up.
Chairman John Menzies also made a relatively bullish forecast of a
satisfactory full-year result. The interim dividend was raised 12% to
4.6p and the shares bucked the trend of plummeting prices, gaining 10p
to 511p.
Of the #1m increase in pre-tax profits to #7.3m, which was achieved on
virtually flat turnover of #575m, some #300,000 came from reduced
interest costs.
Citing cost control and tight cash and working capital management,
group managing director Ranald Noel-Paton said: ''The benefits that are
seen in these results are driven very much by a concentration on the
structural aspects of business management.''
The profits surge came in the face of the continuing newspaper price
war and rail strikes which took their toll during the six months to
October.
Mr Noel-Paton acknowledged that a shake-up of the newspaper
distribution industry, in the wake of a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission inquiry, had created volatility in what is a massive business
for John Menzies.
However, he claimed recent press reports had exaggerated the company's
loss of market share in the renegotiated News International contract,
which he said had only been reduced from 22% to between 19% and 20%. The
company is, however, confident that its market share will grow over the
longer term.
Strong performances came from John Menzies Retail's 259 stores and
particularly from the company's 183 Early Learning Centre outlets, in
spite of sluggish retail conditions. Twelve revamped John Menzies stores
have produced sales growth, at maintained or improved margins. Sales of
Universal Office Supplies were also buoyant.
Predicting any increase in turnover would be ''extremely difficult'',
Mr Noel-Paton said: ''We see in that flat performance the difficulty
that every High Street retailer is experiencing, in that the feel-good
factor continues to be as elusive as ever.''
Record capital investment of more than #14m in the first half, backed
by strong cash flow, has been aimed at further enhancing the
competitiveness and profitability of the businesses. The company
considers this level of investment is necessary for survival in the
current climate.
Jamie Matheson, analyst at Allied Provincial Securities, took heart
from news of an apparently strong retail division and may ultimately
increase his full-year profits forecast of #39m.
Referring to the announcement on Christmas sales, he said: ''I think
that is a pretty clear signal that the results for the full year will
not be disappointing.''

Margaret, a married mother of two, met Liz, 36, at the Glasgow Gay and
Lesbian Association. Margaret had lived with her violent and abusive
husband for 23 years, but when she fell in love with Liz she found the
courage to leave him. She has two children aged 22 and 27. One approves
of her lifestyle and one hasn't spoken to her since her divorce. Liz and
Margaret always knew, deep within themselves, that they were gay. It was
through the most dramatic of circumstances that they managed to build a
life together. This is their story.
LIZ: I moved up to Glasgow from Birmingham to look for Hotel work. I'd
been here a year when I decided to get in touch with the Lesbian and Gay
Association. I knew I was gay from the age of 13. But it wasn't until I
came to Glasgow that I decided to do anything about it. They phoned and
asked me along to one of their meetings. This was six years ago. I
didn't think I was ready but they talked me into it. I was that nervous
I had a whole bottle of wine before I went. By the time I got there I
was rambling so, I don't remember that much except that it was a relief
to talk about my sexuality.
Margaret: I was married at the time, knowing it wasn't really what I
wanted. It had been such a bad marriage, I thought I had relatively few
years left so I might as well be happy. There was a song out at the time
and one of the lines was: ''Dreams are for those who sleep.'' It kept
going through my head and I thought, I'm not going to sleep any longer,
I'm going to do something about how I feel.
The first time I went to the association I found them very friendly,
but what put me off was that out of the number of people there, 95% of
them were 16 or 17-year-old girls with a baby, one-parent families. The
only way they could get a place of their own was subject to having a
kid. After the meeting we all repaired to the pub. I was so unused to
flirting I didn't realise Liz was trying it on. We exchanged phone
numbers.
Liz: The leaders of the Lesbian and Gay Association said I shouldn't
become serious with anyone, to give myself time to get used to being
gay. When I started to see Margaret they were furious, saying ''You
shouldn't have got involved so soon.
Margaret: The first mistake we made on going out was to go to a
straight pub. I desperately wanted to hold Liz's hand but of course you
can't do that in a straight pub so I felt very unreal. This was a
gigantic leap to the moon for me, a married woman, at that time still
responsible for my children. I started thinking ''Why am I here?''. I
took a wobbly right there in the pub. I desperately wanted a hug. We
should have gone to a gay pub where we could touch each other. However,
it couldn't have been that bad a wobbly because I managed to tan a
vegeburger later on. Liz thought I wouldn't phone her after that.
Liz: We started seeing each other twice a week, but it was the last
thing that I expected to happen, that by going to one of those meetings
I would meet someone who was married with all the problems Margaret had.
It was the deceiving, of having an affair that was offputting. It was
all another lie. I still felt I was doing something I shouldn't.
Especially when I had to go to Margaret's house and pretend we were just
friends.
Margaret had said at the meeting that she was married but that she
didn't share a room with her husband, that she was just a housekeeper,
but she was obviously still involved with her husband in the sense that
he wouldn't expect her to have an affair. They were still a couple with
children. When you come out you want your first relationship to be
perfect.
Margaret: But it wasn't an affair, we didn't sleep with each other for
a long while, and there was only a limited emotional bond between my
husband and I. The whole thing was such a flux of emotion; enjoyment,
sexual attraction, I was leading a double life but it was exciting. In
the initial honeymoon period you just want to enjoy yourself, you're so
happy, you've found your true self. Sexuality is such a basic thing that
when you realise what you are it's a relief.
Liz: When you first meet someone and fall in love you want to see them
all the time and I found it hard when Margaret went home and I could
only phone at certain times. After six months we were in the pub one
night and I told Margaret that if she hadn't left her husband within a
year I wouldn't carry on the relationship.
Margaret: It was funny, but it wasn't a decision made by me or Liz in
the end, but by my partner. I hate to say this but it was his actions
which made me make up my mind. He went abroad, and he was angry when he
came back that I hadn't been stood by the phone, waiting for every call.
He got very stroppy. There was no comparison between what I felt for Liz
and the life I'd had with him and what lay in the future. When he hit me
again it was the complete turning point. I was frightened of him and his
violence for a long, long time.
Because you're in love and so happy you don't feel insecure anymore.
So I stood up to him. I said if you hit me again I'm going to call the
police. I'd never said anything like that to him before. He raised his
arm again to hit me and I picked up the phone and dialled 999. He took
it from me and put it down. Those were the two minutes when I decided
that I was going. There was no way I was going to stay with that man,
not when I had happiness waiting for me.
Liz: When Margaret decided to leave it was all pretty quick, within a
couple of days. I didn't really quite believe it. I thought she'd go
back when she'd calmed down. Then she started coming over with cases of
stuff. She was secure, she had a nice house and no worries, and then
there we were in a bedsit.
Margaret: I couldn't have left my husband without Liz's support. If
I'd had to do it on my own I would have been there yet. Men don't take
relationships between women that seriously. My husband thought it was
just a fling and I'd be back. I was the chief cook and bottlewasher. He
told me if I came home he'd let me continue seeing Liz. I was offered
the best of both worlds, an open marriage, but it wasn't right and it
wasn't honest. Just because you are of a certain sexuality doesn't mean
that you have no morals. You are yourself, and there are things you
won't tolerate.
Liz: But it's all been worth it. We've been living together now for
over five years and we're very happy.
Margaret: The one who leaves a marriage, however bad it is, always
feels guilty. I was worried, I still am, that I was a mother and not
necessarily a good role-model. My younger daughter has always had
problems, but the fact that I fell in love with another woman hasn't
helped. For over three years now she's refused to have any contact with
me. It hurts. I keep hoping she'll come round.
Liz: I like kids. But I don't want any. Margaret said she wouldn't
stop me but I don't have any maternal feelings. I'm also gay. I wouldn't
bring a child into the situation we're in. There's enough for them to
contend with out there without that.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry into case of needle left in baby</HEADLINE>

CHILD health experts are to investigate claims that a premature baby
was discharged from hospital with a hypodermic needle inside him --
despite its appearance on an X-ray two weeks earlier.
The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust's decision to hold an independent
inquiry meets the demand of parents Steve Jones, 31, and his wife
Andrea, 24, who are concerned about possible health risks to their first
child, Benjamin.
They claim Benjamin, born six weeks prematurely, came home from
Treliske hospital, Truro, with the one-and-a-half inch needle apparently
under his skin. It came to light during a nappy change.
The trust's chief executive, Mr Brian Milstead, said yesterday they
were ''very concerned'' and he had decided that an independent
investigation would be held, with advice from the South-west Regional
Health Authority.
''We must have the facts before we can take any action,'' said Mr
Milstead.
But he added: ''I am not able to comment on detailed aspects of the
case, such as the X-ray.''
A Cornwall Community Health Council spokesman, Mr Neal Chambers, said
they would be raising the matter today at a meeting with the Royal
Cornwall Hospitals Trust.
Benjamin was born on Christmas Day at Treliske -- where the findings
of a disciplinary hearing into claims that a nurse carried out an
appendix operation are expected this week.
His father, a RN lieutenant working as an air traffic controller at
Culdrose, near Helston, said the child was admitted to the hospital's
baby unit after his birth.
Blood, lumbar puncture, and swab tests were carried out, and the next
day the hospital called to say a small lump had developed on the baby's
stomach.
Mr Jones, who told the hospital he and his wife had not seen the lump
the day before, said: ''They took X-rays and ultrasound of it, and we
were informed there was nothing showing up on those.''
Benjamin was allowed home on January 12, and the lump started to
disappear.
Mrs Jones told how she was changing Benjamin's nappy when she thought
there was something lying on the mat. She grabbed hold of the end of it,
Benjamin turned over in the opposite direction, and a needle ''actually
came out from him''.
It is claimed that on readmission to hospital, a doctor said the lump
had vanished and there had been a needle inside the child.
Mr Jones said he was told the needle was of the type used for taking
blood from premature babies.
He claimed hospital consultant Graham Taylor then told them the needle
showed up on the X-ray taken when the lump first arose.
Mr Jones said the hospital was ''totally apologetic'', but refused his
request to see the X-ray.
Medical injuries specialist Adrian Hickman, a member of Cornwall CHC,
who is representing the family, said there was a claim for compensation
on behalf of Benjamin which should be pursued.

AN EDINBURGH man who tried to kill himself after he said he was being
hounded by the Child Support Agency still plans to press ahead with a
European Court challenge despite yesterday's Government announcement on
changes to the agency.
Mr Clive Parsons, 38, is fighting demands for #127.13p a week
maintenance for his two children, claiming he cannot afford the payment
and arguing that the agency is interfering with a family agreement
reached on his divorce in 1988.
He is off work due to illness but hopes to return to his bakery job
soon when he expects the agency to take up their cash demands again.
His wage is #182 a week. Out of it he has to cope with a #250-a-month
mortgage, a bank loan of #98 monthly, and insurance policy premiums of
#33.
''I'm at my wits' end. There is no way I can afford to pay my ex-wife
that amount of money. I love my children very much, but it just isn't
humanly possible to meet all my financial obligations,'' Mr Parsons said
yesterday.
When he divorced he signed over the matrimonial home in Wales to his
wife and agreed to a small monthly maintenance payment for his sons,
Christopher and Adam.
On top of that he left the house contents and furniture with his
family.
His solicitor, Mr Cameron Fyfe, of Glasgow firm Ross Harper and
Murphy, said: ''This was a legally binding arrangement and it is clearly
unfair that Mr Parsons is being hounded by the CSA for a large sum of
money which he has no means of paying.''
Mr Fyfe said yesterday's announcements were ''helpful'' but could take
months to implement.
''We may have a better chance of having the matter resolved quickly by
applying to the European Court,'' he added.
Mr Fyfe argues the agency is contravening an article of the Human
Rights Convention which states that everyone has the right to respect
for his family life, his home and his correspondence without
interference by a public authority.
Mr Parsons claimed that his battle with the agency had taken an
enormous toll on his health. ''Things got so bad that I tried to take my
own life at Christmas in 1993,'' he said.

THE Higher will remain the ''gold standard'' for entry to university
and college, higher education chiefs predicted yesterday.
Speaking after releasing their response to the Government's Higher
Still blueprint for reforming post-16 education, they said the
market-place would decide how much weight the proposed new Advanced
Higher would carry in relation to university entrance.
But their body, the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals
(Coshep), foresaw a limited role for the Advanced Higher, which will
replace the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
Coshep said the standing of Advanced Highers would depend on the
nature of higher education courses and, in particular, the extent to
which first-year university work could be undertaken in schools and
colleges.
Scottish Office officials concede that the Higher will remain the
normal entry standard, but assume that universities will give the
Advanced Higher separate credit, perhaps by giving exemptions from some
first-year courses.
However, the convener of Coshep, Professor John Arbuthnott, said he
did not envisage a large-scale entrance into the second year of courses.
It would be up to faculties to consider the Higher or Advanced Higher
against their educational aims, and that would determine the length of
courses.
Professor Arbuthnott, Principal of Strathclyde University, speculated
that ''priority'' courses -- such as medicine, law, and accountancy --
might demand the Advanced Higher.
However he did not think there would be a ''mad rush'' in that
direction.
The Higher Still reforms would result in a more complex range of
qualifications for higher education, which placed an obligation on
institutions to make their entry requirements crystal clear to potential
students, he said.
The Higher Still system for fifth and sixth year schooling will build
on the Higher, CSYS, and Scotvec mainly vocational modules.
Modules 40 or 80 hours long will make up Higher courses of 160 hours
and Advanced Highers lasting 320 hours. National Certificate awards will
be linked with Highers and Advanced Highers in a unified system to give
academic and vocational courses equal standing.
Professor Bart McGettrick, the Coshep vice-convener, who has a key
role in the Higher Still development, said more than 500 people were
involved in the initiative.
Draft study programmes for Higher Still courses are likely to be put
out for consultation in April.

Reforms to the widely reviled Child Support Agency were unveiled
yesterday in Parliament. Criticism that some fathers had been left
nearly destitute by high maintenance levels, censure of the agency's
performance by the Parliamentary Ombudsman and shoals of complaints from
MPs lobbied by irate fathers have forced Social Services Secretary Peter
Lilley to introduce changes. Bounty hunters or an attempt to force
absent parents to face up to their responsibilities? Here two sides of
the maintenance divide give their view of the workings of the agency to
Margaret Vaughan
YOU will not have seen Julie Trowell waving a placard on the protest
lines. She was, she says, too busy coping.
When her husband walked out three years ago, she lost her home, a
#15,000 pension, was left to pay his debts, was pursued by creditors and
is still paying them off.
She was alone, penniless, homeless, and with a two-year-old daughter
her husband refused to support.
Don't ask Julie to criticise the Child Support Agency. She says hers
is the story you do not often hear. In the welter of criticism of all
its failings, she is an illustration of why it is needed.
Behind every CSA-bashing demonstration is a truth not universally
acknowledged. Not all fathers accept their duty to support their
children.
Julie's only complaint is of the agency's lack of power to force
defaulters to take financial responsibility for their children. ''Let me
tell you something. The Child Support Agency treated me with nothing but
kindness. They made enormous efforts to get maintenance for us. It was
not their fault that they failed. The problem was they did not have
sufficient enforcement powers.''
The package of changes flagged yesterday by Social Security Secretary
Peter Lilley will do nothing to help Julie and daughter Jenna. Or others
like them.
Her husband has a new family, a comfortable new house, a thriving
business and runs a big car. Julie receives no maintenance for her
daughter.
It is three years since her husband walked out. He is self-employed.
He said he earned only #45 a week. Julie knew it was nonsense. The Child
Support Agency knew it was nonsense. There was nothing they could do to
prove it.
For more than a year the agency attempted to investigate his earnings.
''We couldn't prove his earnings, although the agency tried very hard. I
wasn't dissatisfied with them. Frustrated was the word.''
The agency lacks power to investigate the earnings of the
self-employed as, say, the Inland Revenue might. They must rely on the
absent parent telling the truth and giving accurate figures.
Julie is not alone. Her case is by no means unusual. According to the
Scottish Council for Single Homeless, one-quarter of the cases it has
dealt with since the agency was set up have been of absent fathers who
are self-employed and who use the CSA formula to get their maintenance
cut, or to avoid paying anything at all.
While the attention has focused on those vocal fathers forced to pay
crippling amounts of maintenance, little has been heard of those who use
the CSA to reduce the amount courts have ordered them to pay.
Julie, now, has rebuilt her life. She is a charge nurse at a Fife
hospital and has a rented home in Kirkcaldy. ''I don't feel any rancour
now. It's been a hard three years though. Sometimes, like now when I
talk about it, I think it has been a nightmare and I wonder, did I
really go through all that? Was it really so bad? Yes, it was.
''But I'm stronger now. I'm not speaking out of bitterness. That's
gone. But there's a very important principle here.''
She has scant sympathy for absent fathers griping about levels of
maintenance. ''Look, there are a hell of a lot of them who show a
distinct lack of responsibility, emotional and financial, to provide for
their child. Yes, they may have second families. But my principle is
simple, that the child they left behind is still theirs.
''It's still left to the mothers to provide for them. We don't have
time to hang about on protest lines. We're too busy holding our
children's lives together.''
When her husband left, Julie had to sell their house. One of his
businesses went bankrupt. It was the one he had registered in her name.
The creditors, not unnaturally, came after her and she lost the proceeds
of the sale of her house plus a #15,000 pension.
She had the pain of the break-up to deal with and, more importantly
for her, she had to cope with a toddler who wondered why her daddy had
gone.
''I had to start at the bottom. But I have managed. Now we have a
rented house. I still pay the trustees so I can't buy much, but we have
a good life now.''
The experience, painful as it was, has, she thinks, left her stronger.
It is not, though, an experience she would wish on others. ''I've
wondered about those men who committed suicide because their maintenance
levels were set too high. Mothers can't commit suicide. We don't have
the luxury. Who will look after the children? We are left with the
responsibility.
''All this publicity attaching to absent fathers, it's so very
one-sided. Mothers have a raw deal.'' She remembers the depressing
visits to benefits offices. ''You go to these places, and it's
humiliating. There you are, over an open-plan desk, discussing all the
details of your personal life. It's sordid.
''Then I went to the Child Support Agency. I was taken into an office,
dealt with quietly and kindly. I cannot fault them. It certainly wasn't
their fault they couldn't get money for me. They did as much as they
could.
''I lived with my husband for 10 years. I know what his company makes
in profits. Everybody knows. How do you prove it? He still can't look me
in the eye.
''I don't want him ripped off. I just believe that if fathers have a
second family, your child is entitled to the same.'' Julie points out
that when she was on benefit, even if her husband had been made to pay
#100 a week for her daughter she would not have seen any of it.
''It would have been deducted from my benefits. Whatever money is
awarded, you lose it from your benefits. But don't blame the Child
Support Agency. They are trying to do a job they were asked to do.
There's something wrong, something very wrong, with the way it works.
That's not their fault.
''It just seems to me they are taking the flak for all the fathers who
fail to do right by their child, and by the distinct lack of powers they
have. ''They tried so hard to help me. They were kind to me. They did
everything in their power. I feel sorry that they are taking the brunt
of the blame when at the end of the day the faults do not lie with
them.''
Tinkering that will cause even more chaos
* KERRY FERGUSON's husband has no contact with the child he fathered
before his marriage. He used to make voluntary payments of #100 a month
to his former girlfriend. Then last year the Child Support Agency
contacted him.
The couple, who live near Kinloss, were told they would have to pay
about #300 a month for the boy.
The mother of the child was, it seems, on income support. Kerry feels
she and her husband are being penalised to support someone else's
irresponsibility.
It was, says Kerry, a terrible financial burden for her family to
bear. She was infuriated to discover that the interest from her
daughter's building society account would be taken into formulations of
maintenance levels by the CSA.
The couple have two small children of their own, Alex and baby Amy.
''I have no quibble with the idea of paying maintenance but it should
be a reasonable amount.'' Since the birth of baby Amy, the couple have
applied for a review of their payments: ''It is six months since we put
in for a change of circumstances. We are still waiting to hear. Now we
will have to apply again for another change of circumstance, because our
mortgage has gone up and tax changes have affected our income. We're #40
a month worse off because of that.''
Kerry, who helped set up the Campaign for Fair Maintenance in
Scotland, believes such changes in people's circumstances are causing
the Child Support Agency to be buried under a blizzard of paperwork. The
changes proposed in yesterday's White Paper, she says, will make an
already chaotic situation even worse. ''It is going to cause a lot more
chaos. It will be another mess they cannot deal with.
''They are simply tinkering with a system instead of doing what should
be done. In my view they should scrap the whole thing and start again.''
Kerry says the allowance for absent parents travelling to see their
child will be welcome, especially in the Services' community, of which
she and her husband are members. ''A very high number of Servicemen are
affected, partly because there is a high rate of marriage breakdown, but
the general problems of men living apart from their children are
compounded in their case by the long distances they have to travel to
see their children.
''There are many stationed in the north of Scotland whose children are
in the very south of England'' -- to say nothing, she points out, of the
difficulties of someone posted to Germany whose children are in Britain.
However, she says merely fiddling with some of the injustices is not
enough. ''Tinkering with the legislation does not tackle the fundamental
problems. No new cases should be taken on. The CSA cannot cope with
those it has.''

A JUDGE attacked the ''scourge of drugs'' as he sentenced a teenager
to life yesterday for stabbing a young soldier to death.
Daniel Crawford, 19, had taken Temazepam and alcohol on the night of
the murder.
The High Court in Glasgow heard he mistook Royal Highland Fusilier
David Morrison, 22, for someone else.
The soldier was home on leave from Germany, staying with his parents
in Hermiston Road, Springboig, Glasgow, when he was attacked in
Edinburgh Road last August.
After Crawford, of Wellhouse Crescent, Easterhouse, who had only minor
convictions, was found guilty, Lord Cullen told him: ''I would like to
underline as strongly as I can what the Advocate-depute said about the
dreadful consequences for those who use drugs like these.
''They are a scourge and cause untold trouble and misery in our
community.''
The court heard Crawford had slipped out of the house without his
mother seeing him after hearing there had been a gang fight.
The accused saw the victim in Langbar Crescent and was seen walking up
behind him to stab him.
Then Crawford chased the injured man across Edinburgh Road and
attacked him again.
Pathologists told the court that one knife blow to the chest went
downwards and damaged the liver. Another stab wound to the back had gone
through the heart and lungs, and a third cut his arm.
There was evidence that Crawford then realised he had stabbed the
wrong man and pleaded: ''Don't grass me. I thought you were someone
else.''
His mother later said her son had become addicted a few weeks after
first taking the tranquillisers. ''The real murderer is the person who
supplied these drugs to my son,'' she said.

THE man cleared of murdering Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common
appeared in court yesterday charged with assault and carrying a weapon.
Mr Colin Stagg, 31, was jointly accused with his fiancee, Ms Diane
Beddoes, 26, of possessing an offensive weapon, affray, and actual
bodily harm.
They appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court after being arrested
following an incident on Wimbledon Common, south-west London, involving
a man in his thirties and his 11-year-old son. Mr Stagg, of Ibsley
Gardens, Roehampton, south- west London, and Ms Beddoes were remanded on
bail until February 6 on condition they avoid Wimbledon Common and do
not contact witnesses.

THE mother of six-year-old Rikki Neave, whose body was found in
woodland 500 yards from his home, was yesterday charged with assaulting
him. Ms Ruth Neave, 26, was remanded in custody for a week. An
application for bail was refused by Peterborough magistrates. She was
charged with wilfully assaulting, ill treating, and neglecting the boy
between January 1 and November 29 last year. She faced similar charges
concerning a three-year-old girl who cannot be named for legal reasons.
She was also charged with assaulting Detective Constable Heather
Thompson on January 19 this year.

AS we enter the final run-in of commemorating the Second World War,
there will be ceremonies to mark VE-Day on May 8 and the last parade of
them all in August, when the victory over Japan will set it all to rest.
The 50th anniversaries have been running since 1989, marking the
outbreak of that most global of wars, but apart from the Armistice Day
remembrance it is generally accepted that, from now on, the remembering
will be on a much more private basis, left to silent hearts.
Across the battlefields of Europe the simple headstones and little
white crosses tell their own story and, as I viewed them in France last
year, I wondered how much the sacrifice meant to those people who live
nearby.
If I harboured any doubts they seem to have been unfounded, as witness
the call which has come to me from the mayor of a small town in France,
where the local people are planning a memorial service for the British
airmen who were shot down in their parish on the night of June 30/July
1, 1944.
On that summer's night, just three weeks after the Normandy landings,
the RAF was bombing the railway marshalling yards at Vierzon in an
attempt to prevent the Germans bringing up troops and supplies to back
up their forces.
Young Scots were among the crews who plunged to their deaths in
surrounding villages and were given a decent burial in civilian
cemeteries, their graves looked after by local people.
But there was one young lad from Glasgow with whose family there seems
to have been no contact.
Sergeant air gunner William Robertson Cowan was a member of the famous
101 Squadron, taking part in the raid that night. There is no address
and the mayor of the town of Massay, where the plane crashed, has no
information, except that Sergean Cowan was born in 1923 and was the son
of John and Margaret Cowan.
The man himself would now be 72 but can anyone out there help to trace
any family of this forgotten Scot? If so, the relatives will be invited
to the memorial service which is planned for March.
The mayor's plea has been brought to me by Mrs Margaret MacPherson
from Stonehaven, whose brother, Pilot Officer Archie Orr from Fife, was
killed in the same raid.
While many relatives could not bring themselves to visit the graves
after the war -- and never did so -- Margaret MacPherson represents the
other side of that story.
Since 1946 she has been going to the Vierzon area two or three times a
year and has established such a rapport with the local community as to
be regarded as the representative of the bereaved families.
With her own husband serving in the Navy, Margaret was staying with
her father and mother at Methil in 1944.
''There was just Archie and myself in the family and we were very
close,'' she explained. ''He joined the RAF as a boy in 1937 and had
been home on leave on the week before the raid. But of course there was
no mention of it when he was home. He went off back and on the following
week I answered the door when the telegram came.''
As soon as was possible after the war, she and her father went to
France, at the beginning of a pilgrimage which has now taken her there
more than 100 times and will last for as long as she is able to travel.
Margaret MacPherson found not only her brother's grave but the family
in whose garden the wing of his Lancaster bomber came to rest. The
daughter-in-law of that house, the widowed Simone Ameline, looks after
Archie's grave to this day.
That raid, in which 1550 bombs were dropped in 17 minutes, inspired
local author Bernard Staels to write a book about it, dedicated to
Archie Orr. And there is a special reason why the young Scots pilot has
come to be held in such high regard.
When his Lancaster was fatally struck, his bomb-load was still on
board. He shouted to his crew to jump -- and three of them survived to
tell the tale. What became obvious thereafter was that Archie Orr was
doing his damnedest to avoid civilian casualties, aiming his plane at a
pond on the outskirts of the village.
Thus he became a local hero, whose story has been passed on to younger
people in the community. When Margaret MacPherson attended a ceremony
there last year she was deeply moved by the speech of a schoolgirl, who
made it plain that her generation, too, would never forget.
The engine from Archie Orr's plane lay untouched in its crater for
half a century and was removed only last year. Now there is a cross to
mark the spot -- and on his gravestone the inscription that ''At the
going down of the sun and in the morning . . .'' His sister has also
paid for a row of trees on the approach to the cemetery.
Now the people of Massay would like to do justice to the seven members
of that other crew which perished on the same night. That is why they
are so anxious to find anyone who might be connected with air gunner No
1348489 -- William Cowan from Glasgow.

News of the pending heavy cuts in the design staff at Rolls-Royce,
East Kilbride, is distressing to me, as a retired, pensioned
ex-employee. It is beyond doubt a tragedy for Scotland (January 19).
It reminds me of events soon after the end of the Second World War
when the Derby management were intent on closing down the Scottish
factories. At that time Willie Miller was general manager in Scotland.
He fought nobly against the Derby proposition and won.
The basis of his victory was that Scotland, with its own design
capability, could be an integrated group in respect of certain nominated
engines. It has continued in this way until now. Engine designers were
crucial to his concept.
As soon as they are removed the edifice is liable to fall.
Conditions are surely different today, but there is a challenge to the
Scottish management to prove that the Scottish plant can play a full
part in the forward plans of this great company.

We should be grateful to Alasdair Marshall for revealing the axing by
BBC London of the television adaptations of Swing Hammer Swing and The
Negotiator (January 21). This is the sort of thing we have to expect as
long as London exercises centralised control.
The only solution is for BBC Scotland to become fully autonomous and
financed by the entire proceeds (not only a fraction as at present) of
Scottish licences.
The SNP has advocated this policy for years. It would be achieved very
soon if all parties in Scotland pressed for it in the forthcoming
revision of the BBC Charter.
After all, even the Conservatives have recognised Scotland's need to
make its own decisions on cultural matters both in theory in the White
Paper on ''taking stock'' and in practice towards university funding and
the Scottish Arts Council. This is a test case of the sincerity of all
parties in their attitudes towards Scottish needs and aspirations.

John Linklater speculates that Tam Dalyell now finds the West Lothian
Question easier to deal with (January 18). As Tam and I have known each
other since our seven election contents in West Lothian, I speculate on
when he will do the Big One, the Big U-Turn, and join the Scottish
National Party.
It is quite within his logic and his track record; and he would be
very welcome.
There are long-time members of the SNP who committed themselves to
supporting self-government for Scotland while at Bo'ness Academy,
influenced, they have told me, by Mr Dalyell as their teacher.
And in a conversation with him in 1963 he told me: ''I'd be with you
all the way, Billy, if you could convince me of the economics of
independence.'' I did my best over the years, but presumably he is not
yet convinced.
However, the time may come. His perception that the real choice for
the Scottish people is between continuing the Union with England or
moving to independence in Europe cannot be challenged.
I will be happy to sponsor Tam Dalyell's application for membership of
the SNP at any time.

I am sure that most, if not all, Scots are mourning the untimely death
of Sir Alexander Gibson. May I say that there are many of the English
who do so as well.
I was privileged to work in Glasgow for 12 years in the sixties and
seventies, which some are now writing about as a golden age in the
musical life of Scotland and which contributed to the great renaissance
of the city of culture. I knew him then.
Having mainly known Glasgow from a distance for a long time now, I
should like to pose a question and offer an analogy. Is it yet realised
just how great a man Sir Alex was, in all that he did for Scotland?
Without entering the political or the national debate I would like to
suggest a scenario. Suppose it's within the bounds of possibility that
Scotland, in the not too distant future, chooses to be a republic within
the European Union and the Commonwealth. Such a country would need a
president.
I'm sure that a few years ago, in another small European state, there
were those who thought that the very idea of having a mere author as
president was quite ludicrous, just as there would be those who'd think
that having a musician as president would be absurd. However, there are
many people throughout the world who think Vaclav Havel has done pretty
well for the Czech Republic.
In a similar role in his beloved Scotland, Sir Alex woul have done as
well. That's how great he was. He was a man of vision and integrity. Of
course, he'd have thought the very idea more absurd than anyone. But
isn't that one of the very reasons he would have been so great?
Even without such flights of fancy his achievements and his legacy are
unique. He will be much mourned. He will be long remembered with love
and gratitude.

I thought that Michael Tumelty's article on the late Sir Alexander
Gibson was excellent, but I was surprised to see reference to his
musical ability being noted at Dalziel High School as having only a
''good ear'' (January 16).
I have an everlasting memory of being present at a performance of The
Gondoliers in which he played one of the leading roles.
At the end of the evening the then head teacher, in winding up the
proceedings, made a very firm prediction that Alex would make his mark
in music in a big way, saying: ''You mark my words tonight. You will be
hearing a lot more of Alex in the near future.''
But even he could never have predicted the amount of contribution and
achievement that Sir Alex was to bring to Scottish Opera and the SNO.

In his Department of Useless Information Jack McLean displays an
ignorance which is a lack of that quality which the French call culture
generale and a lack of good manners in his attitude to readers who take
the trouble to write to him.
His column with its flippantly insolent treatment of M Jean-Paul Sadie
was no exception (January 14). M Sadie was correct when he informed Jack
McLean that the tune to which we sing For He's a Jolly Good Fellow was
originally the French song Malbrouk s'en va-t-en guerre, which is said
to date from 1709, the time of the first Duke of Marlborough's
victorious campaign in Flanders.
It did not become really popular in France until 1758 when the third
Duke of Marlborough failed in his campaign against Cherbourg. Two other
factors ensured the tune's popularity: it became a favourite of Marie
Antoinette, who heard a nursemaid sing it to one of her children as a
lullaby, and Beaumarchais included it in his play The Marriage of
Figaro.
In keeping with the spirit of a column of useless information, I
should like to add that Chateaubriand writes of the traditionally held
belief that the song originated with the Arabs and it celebrates the
legend of Mambron, a crusader.

There seems to be an inconsistency in your editorial on the plans to
celebrate VE and VJ days (January 12).
In the case of VE-Day you state that Germany will be invited and that
Chancellor Kohl is expected to attend. In the case of VJ-Day, however,
you state that the Japanese have not been invited ''because of the
peculiar delicacy of wartime recollections of the Far East conflict and
it is right that they should not be invited.''
What is the ''peculiar delicacy'' to which you refer? Is it worse than
the iniquitous crimes committed by the Germans?
No-one will deny the sadistic treatment meted out by the Japanese to
captured British and Allied forces. But it cannot be overlooked that the
wartime behaviour of Germany was anything other than cruel and barbaric
to a degree and to an extent previously unknown to history.
The seeking out for destruction of the Jews, from infant to aged, the
starvation, slave labour, torture, and extermination in the gas chambers
was a depravity, the victims of which were not even combatants but
ordinary civilians.
The paradox of it all, both in Europe and the Far East, is that the
guilty nations now economically rule the roost in both areas. We ought
not to deny the dark past of Germany merely because the Bundesbank
appears to call the tune in the European Union.

When I left home today at 08.30 it was still dark enough for the
street lights to be on and for dipped headlights to be required.
It is therefore a simple matter of arithmetic to conclude that, if
European time were in use, the same amount of daylight would then occur
at 09.30 and that it would be totally dark at 08.30.
During the last bout of summertime madness accident rates in the
mornings increased dramatically -- the greatest part of the increase
involving children (they return from school before evening traffic
build-up). I cannot see the logic in increasing the danger to young
children simply to co-ordinate UK working times with Europe.
The multiplicity of time zones in the US does not appear to hinder
their business ability so why does a difference of one hour in
comparison with central Europe hinder the business ability of the UK?
As the UK does the bulk of its trade with the US and the Pacific
Basin, the logical conclusion to the pro-European time argument is that
there should be a single world time.
This would enable the wealth-makers in London, New York, Tokyo, and
other world centres to co-ordinate breakfast, lunch, and dinner, thereby
making the entire business world much more efficient.
Businesses that deal with others in different time zones should alter
their working time to suit, not the time of everyone else.
One consequence of this would be to spread both the morning and
evening rush hour over a longer period, thereby cutting both traffic
congestion and accident rates.

Voluntary organisations that are funded by central and local
government to cover their running costs, and are recognised by the
Inland Revenue as having charitable status, are required by
ScottishPower to pay for electricity at the industrial rate, which is
roughly twice the domestic rate.
One cannot imagine that ScottishPower would incur a significant loss
of income by allowing charities the benefit of the domestic rate. This
would also remove a disincentive from those who offer their services
gratis to charities.

CHOOSING your lottery numbers is the easiest part of the transaction,
I would have thought. Finding a shop or petrol station on a Saturday
evening which is not queued out with sullen-faced punters who seem
incapable of filling out the ticket properly is far more difficult. But
just in case picking six numbers strikes you as a Herculean task, the
newspaper Goldrush, which describes itself as ''Lottery info for the
serious player'', believes it has the answer.
It is selling -- exclusively to its readers -- computer software for a
mere #24.95 which will pick six numbers for you. Too expensive? Well,
for only #17.99 you can purchase a water-resistant Lottowatch which, at
a press of a button, will randomly select six numbers from the 49 on its
face.
Still too much? For only #3, then, there is a plastic pen with a large
plastic globe at the end containing 49 tiny balls. You shake it, and six
of them fall through the bottom into the body of the pen. Called the
Number Crunching Lottery Pen, for some reason the order form limits
purchases to four per household. No doubt that's all the excitement one
household can stand.
But perhaps there is more fun in choosing your own numbers. Goldrush
claims that a woman from High Wycombe used her 38 bra size as one of her
numbers and picked up a #1595 prize. I wonder if any male winner will
tell us why he picked the number six in Saturday's winning combination.
Di laughing
WORD has reached the Diary on why Princess Diana was laughing to
herself during her recent low-key trip to visit patients at the state
mental hospital at Carstairs. She was heard to say to at least two of
the patients: ''And what makes you think you'll be king one day?''
Motivational visit
CHILDREN at a primary school in Grampian seemed suspiciously excited
when their teachers said that the Church of Scotland's Moderator was
coming to visit them just before he left for a trip to Malawi. Sadly
their faces fell when the Rt Rev James Simpson walked in. The pupils had
thought that breakfast television's manic exercise chappie Mr Motivator
was going to be the star guest.
Alas, the only thing Mr M and Mr S have in common is that they both
wear outrageous outfits.
School for scoundrels
YOU could almost feel the excitement when Michael Laing, the managing
director of Laing the Jeweller in Glasgow, opened his mail to find a
letter from the European Academy of Economics, headquartered in Paris,
telling him that his company had won a ''European Performance Award''.
The letter explained: ''This high distinction is awarded by the
academy as a recompense for companies which have achieved the best
economic performance and displayed exemplary progress.''
The bronze trophy, made by master metal craftsmen in Paris, would be
despatched once Mr Laing had filled in the validation form.
Alas as he enthusiastically filled it in, his eyes alighted on the
final sentence, which said there was the small matter of a #475 fee for
participation costs and shipping expenses. Now that is indeed an academy
of economics.
Showroom hates
NEW importer of Korean cars to Britain, Daewoo, advertised for people
to tell them the three things they hate most about buying a new car. Not
surprisingly, salesmen came top of the list. The most enjoyable reply
came from an elderly female driver who listed the three best ways to
improve sales.
She told them: ''When I take my old car in for a service, there is
nothing I'd like more than a lovely mug of coffee. Not too milky, and

don't need to be chocolate-covered, as long as jam makes an appearance.
''Secondly, I'd rather not have greasy marks all over my log book.
Haven't car men heard of Swarfega? It's green, comes in a jar and is, I
am sure, available locally quite easily.
''Thirdly, on the subject of overalls, I think they should be
obligatory. I cannot tell you how many times I have been inadvertently

Daewoo says it will be launching its range of Swarfega, biscuits, and
overalls in the spring.

THE Diary is wondering whether it has discovered the first male and
female version of the same joke. As Rangers fans continue to chortle at
Celtic's Coca-Cola Cup disaster, one of them asks: ''Did you hear about
the new perfume being sold at the Celtic Shop? McStay Mist.''
It's just that the following day, the same answer was given to a
question about the Celtic Shop selling a special Islay malt whisky.
Celtic fans tell me quite forcefully that both products are now well
past their sell-by dates.

THE principles which lie behind the work of the Child Support Agency
are exemplary. Absent fathers should be responsible for a fair share of
the upkeep of their children and mothers should not be made to struggle
on inadequate benefits. Nevertheless, the system imposed on the CSA by
hasty and ill-considered legislation, compounded by Treasury rapacity
and an administrative system which seemed wilfully designed to fail, has
forced the Government into a major policy change. The new measures
announced in the House of Commons yesterday by Mr Peter Lilley are
welcome but woefully late. They go some way to meet the complaints and
objections of a number of the critical reports on the CSA, and in some
cases go even further, but the danger facing Mr Lilley and those charged
with making the CSA work in the future is that the agency has been
hopelessly tainted by its past failures.
These are many and manifest. A majority of the maintenance assessments
made on absent parents in the first year of the agency's work were
discovered to be wrong. An independent survey raised questions against
almost three-quarters of all maintenance cases and the Parliamentary
Ombudsman, Mr William Reid, concluded that the agency was bungling,
insensitive, and slipshod. Against this appalling background the
Government has moved effectively, if tardily. Particularly welcome is
the establishment of an independent appeal system which will enable
those unhappy about their assessment to have some confidence that their
objections will be dealt with in a fair manner. Changes in the formula
governing clean-break settlements are long overdue, although Mr Lilley
is correct in insisting that the implication of finality in a
clean-break settlement is misleading. The prospect of assessments taking
ridiculously large proportions of income has done great harm to the
stability of second families, a prospect which runs against the grain of
what the CSA is supposed to be achieving. The capping of assessment at
30% of normal income is a sensible level, especially when taken together
with the new appeals system, and the damaging arrears demanded from
some, simply because of inefficiency within the CSA, are rightly to be
held to a maximum of six months.
Nevertheless, Mr Lilley cannot be wholeheartedly congratulated.
Mothers on benefit will have their position improved by receiving extra
money, but why this sensible and humane measure should be delayed until
1997, unlike all the other improvements, is inexplicable. Offering a
lump sum on return to work is clearly a significant encouragement, but
pressure groups are right to point out that single women who return to
work need help to enable them to stay in work. Two worries remain. The
history of the CSA has been dreadful precisely because the legislation
establishing it was written hastily and badly. The Governments of the
past decade have passed large amounts of legislation, much of it shoddy.
This suggests time-bombs in the future and an urgent need to be more
careful when contemplating legislation. Secondly, the CSA is on its last
chance. It must be made to work this time, and if it does not it must be
replaced by a system that will.

SCOTTISH time will go on trial next month when two advocates put the
arguments for and against changing our clocks to Central European Time.
The ''trial'' is being staged by the Royal Scottish Geographical
Society in the Burgh Court Hall, John Street, Glasgow, on Friday,
February 17.
The case for the pursuers will be led by advocate Vincent Connor and
Mr Angus Crichton-Miller, chairman of the Daylight Extra Now pressure
group.
The defenders, for the status quo, will be led by advocate James
Taylor and Mr Tony Connell, director of administration with Grampian
region.
Switching to the continental clock, by transferring one hour of
daylight from morning to evening would, supporters believe, lead to a
reduction in road accidents and a fall in opportunist crimes committed
in the dark. It would also increase tourism and help business.
Supporters include the Police Federation, the Confederation of British
Industry, and the British Medical Association.
According to the RAC, switching to Central European Time would save
165 lives and avoid 628 serious injuries on the roads in Britain each
year, because there would be more light in the early evening when most
accidents happen.
The argument against says that the longer period of darkness in the
morning would mean more accidents, force children to travel to school in
the dark and pose difficulties for postmen, milkmen, construction
workers and farmers.
The case will be decided by a jury of RSGS members.
* An opinion poll in 1992 showed 50% support among Scots for bringing
clocks in line with continental Europe.

GLAXO'S proposed take-over of its fellow pharmaceuticals giant,
Wellcome, will in one move create the largest company in the United
Kingdom and either the largest or second-largest drugs company in the
world. Outcomes of such dimension normally evoke the interest of the
Monopolies Commission, but that may not follow in this case because the
drugs industry is international in scope and necessarily very large
because of the huge research budgets required to sustain the long and
costly processes of drug development. This merger ought to produce more
effective research since it will unite two teams already possessed of
appropriate funding. It ought also to produce economies leading to lower
costs to purchasers of their drugs, mainly governments, the biggest
buyers of drug-based therapies for the beneficiaries of public health
services. Both companies, but particularly Wellcome, are also large in
the sale of over-the-counter medicines (that is, preparations available
without prescription) and cost benefits of a union should help each
there.
Governments, because they are such big buyers, are always suspicious
of the international drug companies and, from time to time, have taken
measures to ensure that they are not ripped off. Since nearly all, and
certainly the US and UK, have specialised agencies of their own to
assess the efficacy (and potential toxicity) of new drugs, they are also
well placed to say what is a fair price, and should use their buying
clout to get it. Companies are also disciplined by their awareness of
the fact that expiry of patents (especially of best-selling products)
can leave them vulnerable to mass producers of generics. Glaxo faces
precisely that sort of challenge with Zantac, its best-selling
anti-ulcer treatment, whose patent protection is set to expire soon; and
Wellcome is similarly placed in relation to Zovirex, its herpes
preparation. In some ways this is a defensive take-over for both
partners.
As well as protecting each other from the worst consequences of these
trends, the partners seem well placed to refinforce their anti-viral
efforts. This was a Wellcome speciality and its anti-Aids preparation,
Retrovir, was initially greeted with great enthusiasm. That mood has
evaporated, and many thought Wellcome had lost its edge in anti-viral
products generally. Retrovir still has a role to play in Aids treatment,
though it is now thought that the best strategy is to use it as part of
a ''cocktail'' of drugs hostile to or inhibitory of the
immuno-deficiency virus. One of the most promising elements of such a
cocktail has already been developed independently by Glaxo, and the two
companies were collaborating. Their merger may give a new impetus to
research in an area where professional opinion has become very
pessimistic, but where new evidence has just been emerging to encourage
hope.
The major financial beneficiary of the move will be the Wellcome
Foundation, which still owns 40% of the Wellcome company. It seems to
have endorsed the Glaxo approach (for it will increase its income) and
that may be enough to ensure its success. That will be another fillip
for medical research and charity for the foundation devotes all its
income to these ends: God and Mammon in symbiotic relationship.

GLAXO's bid for Wellcome marks a new era for the company which has
traditionally preferred to plough a lone furrow. That the bid has been
made at all reflects the difference in style and approach of the current
chief executive and acting chairman, Sir Richard Sykes.
Sir Richard, a former research and development director at Glaxo, was
appointed chief executive in March 1993 following the shock resignation
of Dr Ernest Mario. Dr Mario, an outgoing American, cited ''differences
of opinion'' with his fellow directors.
This was widely taken to mean a difference of approach to Sir Paul
Girolami, who was chairman of Glaxo until his retirement last June. A
previous chief executive, Bernard Taylor, also parted company with Glaxo
following clashes with Sir Paul and is now chairman of Medeva, the
fast-growing pharmaceuticals company.
Dr Mario had recognised the way the pharmaceutical wind was blowing,
and was keen for Glaxo to move into the over-the-counter market via an
acquisition. Sir Paul had a more conservative management style, and
favoured Glaxo relying on its traditional path of increasing its
earnings organically by in-house research and development of innovative
products.
Sir Paul, knighted in 1988, spent a quarter of a century on the board,
the last nine years as chairman. He presided over the explosive growth
of Glaxo to become Europe's biggest drug company and number two in the
world, with sales last year of #5600m. When he joined the company in
1966, Glaxo's stock market value was #74m, with interests in a highly
diversified range of products and activities, from hospital furniture
and baby foods to pomegranate juice. By the time of his retirement,
Glaxo had become a highly focused prescription pharmaceutical group with
a stock market value of #18bn.
Sir Paul became Glaxo's chief executive in 1980, a year before the
launch of the ulcer treatment Zantac which, through judicious marketing,
is now the world's biggest-selling drug. Last year, despite competition
in the market, its sales grew by 7% to #2400m and accounted for 35% of
the world market for ulcer treatments.
Before this, in the late 1970s, Glaxo had been in the slow lane of the
pharmaceutical industry. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the company's
research and development efforts were strengthened and a number of key
products introduced, particularly for asthma and bacterial and skin
infections.
Sir Paul presided over the expansion of Glaxo overseas, notably in the
US and Japan. More recently, Glaxo subsidiaries have been established in
the emerging markets of Indonesia and Russia.
It is all a far cry from its humble origins more than 100 years ago.
From a general trading company created in New Zealand in 1873, it
developed a UK business, mainly for imported dairy products, and formed
a London-based company in 1899. It introduced a powdered infant food
which, in 1906, was given the name Glaxo.
This was the company's main product until 1924, when an American
process for extracting vitamin D from fish-liver oil was utilised to
produce the company's first medical product. In 1935, the company itself
took the Glaxo name and built new offices and a factory at Greenford
near London, which now houses the headquarters staff of Glaxo Holdings.

Nicola Reeves on the pressures which led to takeover move.
THE announcement yesterday of Glaxo's hostile #9000m bid for Wellcome
which, if it succeeds, will make it the world's biggest drug firm and
the UK's largest company by stockmarket value, was not a surprise to
industry watchers who had been forecasting the takeover of Wellcome for
the past few months.
Sir Richard Sykes, deputy chairman and chief executive of Glaxo, has
recently warned of a shake-out to come in the industry, and yesterday
said that the Glaxo bid was ''driven by disease management''.
Compared with other technology-based industries, pharmaceuticals is
extremely fragmented. Less than 20% of the industry is in the hands of
the top five companies, compared with the car industry where that figure
is 50%, and in civil aviation it is even higher.
The primary factor behind the rationalisation in the industry is the
pressure on drug company profit margins as government's of the
industrialised nations seek to rein in their burgeoning healthcare
budgets.
In the US, healthcare as a percentage of US gross domestic product has
risen inexorably from 10% in 1981, to around 14% today. Healthcare
spending in the UK accounts for about 7% of overall Government spending.
Until recently, drug companies have been able effectively to charge
what they like, and have not been subjected to the market pressures to
be lean and mean seen in other industries.
The healthcare reforms in the US, the world's largest pharmaceutical
market, have changed the operating environment for drug companies. An
important change in the US has been the move towards fixed-price
contracts between health management organisations (HMOs) and drug
providers. The UK's Department of Health promotes a list of cheaper
alternatives to traditionally expensive pharmaceutical compounds.
Given the pressures facing the industry, biggest is definitely seen to
be best. This is why there has been a steady stream of takeovers in the
past year, as companies seek to amalgamate activities and in so doing
become better able to serve customer groups such as GP fund holders and
purchasing authorities in the UK and HMOs in the US.
Despite having market-leading drugs in therapeutic categories,
earnings growth at both Glaxo and Wellcome has been coming under
pressure. Both companies are thought to be too reliant on the sales of
blockbuster drugs in their portfolios.
Glaxo has the anti-ulcer treatment Zantac, the world's best-selling
drug. Wellcome has Retrovir, marketed as AZT for the treatment of HIV
infection and Zovirax, its biggest-selling drug, for herpes infection.
Both Zantac and Zovirax are facing increased competition from cheaper
imitation drugs known as generics, a situation set to accelerate as
patent protection on both these compounds expires within the next few
years.
A combination of the two companies would provide a complementary drugs
portfolio with Wellcome's strength in anti-viral products sitting
comfortably alongside Glaxo's anti-ulcer, respiratory, and antibiotics
portfolio. The two companies have collaborated in a number of areas
already.
Last November, Glaxo announced it had decided to develop and
eventually market the anti-Aids drug known as 3TC, following encouraging
clinical results. Earlier in the year it had agreed to give Wellcome an
option to develop and market 3TC for HIV treatment. Data published at an
international congress on Aids therapy in Glasgow showed that 3TC
produced promising results when used in combination with Wellcome's AZT.
The corporate culture of both companies is very similar, with a heavy
emphasis placed on in-house research and development of innovative
products.
However, this does not come cheap. Wellcome expects to have spent
around #350m in its 1994 financial year. It continues to research the
effects of AZT and other drugs on HIV. It has three other anti-HIV
compounds at an early stage of development.
Wellcome has focused on anti-viral treatments, but it is widening its
remit with the development of a new migraine drug which has the
potential to overcome some of the undesirable side-effects on the heart
of some existing treatments.
Glaxo is close to completing the construction of a #700m new Medicines
Research Centre at Stevenage, in Hertfordshire. The 95-acre site will be
at the heart of the group's drive to bring forward innovative medicines,
which will make significant contributions to better healthcare.
The company's expenditure on research and development amounted to
#858m, representing 15% of sales in the financial year ended June 30,
1994. In the current financial year it expects to spend about #900m.
Glaxo has one of the best research and development drug portfolios
within the pharmaceutical industry. A number of innovative products are
still in the roll-out phase, but are showing double digit sales growth.
These include Imigran used to treat migraine, and the asthma treatment
Serevent.
In December, Glaxo announced that it would jointly fund with
Government agencies the Jenner Institute, Britain's first all-round
vaccine research centre. Glaxo will pay #10m to build and equip the
centre alongside the Institute for Animal Health at Compton, Berkshire.
Given the downward pressure on drug prices in the market, companies
such as Glaxo and Wellcome that provide innovative treatments for
chronic illnesses such as cancer, Aids, and mental illness -- which are
currently not well served by medicine -- are more able to command
premium prices.
Both companies are trying to extend the life of their most profitable
prescription drugs by making them available over-the-counter.
Earlier this month, Glaxo won approval in the UK for a
non-prescription version of Zantac. It is being marketed as a heartburn
treatment by Warner Wellcome, the OTC joint venture between Warner
Lambert of the US and Wellcome.
Zovirax has successfully been launched OTC in a number of markets
including the UK, as a cold sore remedy. However, the company recently
suffered a setback with two recommendations from advisory committees
that the US Food and Drug Administration, the licensing authority for
pharmaceutical companies operating in the US, should not license OTC
Zovirax.
Glaxo does not expect its bid for Wellcome to come in for scrutiny on
monopoly grounds. Indeed, there do not appear to be any grounds for
concern given that Glaxo has 3.9% share of the world pharmaceuticals
market and Wellcome has just 1.2% market share.
This deal is unlikely to be the last in the UK pharmaceuticals
industry, with Fisons famous for its Intal asthma drug, and Zeneca, the
pharmaceutical and agrochemicals businesses demerged from ICI and
producer of Tenormin, the world's leading beta-blocker heart drug, both
expected to enter the fray.

THE Labour Party has tabled a clause to the Children (Scotland) Bill
which would set limits to the punishment parents can legally mete out to
their children.
The clause would not, for example, ban a parent's right to smack a
child with an open hand, but would prevent parents from claiming they
were simply exercising parental rights when they chastised their
children in certain circumstances.
Labour's clause provides that: ''In any proceedings . . . against a
person for striking a child, it should not be a defence that the person
struck the child in the purported exercise of any parental right if he
or she struck the child (i) with a stick, belt or other object, or (ii)
in such a way as to cause, or to risk causing, injury, or (iii) in such
a way as to cause or to risk causing, pain or discomfort lasting more
than a very short time.''
In essence, the proposed change to the legislation does not go so far
as creating an offence as such, but does remove a defence that has been
used by some parents in legal proceedings.
Mrs Maria Fyfe, Labour's spokesperson on children, said: ''The current
provisions in the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1937 are too
loose and allow for ''reasonable chastisement.
''It is then left to the courts to interpret this and we have seen in
recent years parents acquitted who have admitted to beating their
children with belts and canes, causing serious bruising.''
She added: ''Austria, Sweden, Finalnd, Denmark and Norway have
prohibited all physical punishment and in Germany and Poland legislation
is under consideration. In Ireland, the Law Reform Commission has
recommended similar action.
''The Government is out of step and has shown no willingness to take
these concerns on board. They seem content to dodge this difficult area
but a central plank of this Bill must be the aim of defending and
protecting our children.''
Labour's clause is very similar to a recommendation made in the
Scottish Law Commission's Report on Family Law in 1992 which sought to
limit the physical chastisement of children.
The Government did not take up that recommendation and yesterday, a
spokesman for the Scottish Office said that when drawing up the Children
(Scotland) Bill, the Government had taken the decision not to include
such a clause because Scots law already had provision for assessing
whether a parent was using reasonable force.
He added that Labour's proposal would now be considered by the
Standing Committee of the House of Commons that is due to deal with the
bill later this session.
Dr Eric Clive, a member of the Scottish Law Commission who was
involved in drawing up the Family Law report, said: ''The basic problem
as we see it is that the existing law left parents and those advising
parents and children in a state of uncertainty.
''Certain strikings of children would be assault under the existing
law, but the existing law is applied after the event and everything
depends on whether a judge after the event thought that what the parents
did was in the bounds of what was moderate and reasonable. Judges can
differ quite widely on that.''
Mr Donald Stewart, business development officer with the Scottish
Child Law Centre, said that a clause such as that proposed by Labour
would ''allow a narrowing of where the limits are''.

THE Government was attacked in the Commons yesterday for its delay in
introducing changes to the way the Child Support Agency is run, although
Opposition MPs welcomed the broad thrust of the changes.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar accused the Government
of complaceny and criticised Ministers for having failed to act earlier
in the face of public anger.
He said: ''These tardy moves reflect pressure from every part of the
House which the Government has long resisted.
''The tragedy is that reforms that might have made an impact 18 months
ago will now have to contend with the bitterness that has built up in
the system.''
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley said that people who had
already had assessments made would be able to benefit from the changes
announced.
Mr Lilley acknowledged ''growing concerns about the practical
application'' of the CSA's principles and operations, which had
convinced him that ''significant change'' was now required.
He said the Government's White Paper proposals would enable the system
to achieve its original purpose.
''They will make maintenance assessments fairer, improve the service
offered by the Agency and ensure that maintenance assessed becomes
maintenance paid.''
Mrs Margaret Ewing, SNP parliamentary leader, said the formula for
dealing with capital or property settlements made before an Agency
assessment was flawed and would cause unfairness and confusion.
''The failure to provide a disregard for maintenance payments in the
calculation of income support will disadvantage the most needy,'' she
said.
Dr Norman Godman (Greenock and Port Glasgow -- Lab.) called for
employers of absent parents to be compelled to co-operate in deducting
maintenance from pay. Even firms that did so and often took a long time
to transfer the money to the Agency.''This is causing a great degree of
distress to mothers in my constituency,'' he said.
Mr Robert Hughes (Aberdeen North -- Lab) said there would be ''great
dismay and anger that none of the changes would apply retrospectively to
those whose asssements had already been made. He said the Agency was
rightly called 'the Chancellor's Support Agency.''
Mr Lilley said changes in assessments could apply from dates specified
in the forthcoming legislation.
Ms Liz Lynne, for the Liberal Democrats, complained that a parent on
Income Support was still to have the value of the maintenance received
withdrawn pound for pound from that allowance, and called for a
disregard of up to #15 to be allowed.
Mr Lilley told her that Liberal Treasury spokesman Mr Malcom Bruce
(Gordon) had just been castigating Labour for making spending pledges
without saying how they were to be paid for. Her suggestion would cost
about #340m. The Government would not throw taxpayers money about ''like
confetti.''
He told Labour MPs who made the same complaint that to do what they
suggested would be a disincentive to a parent to accept work if it
became available.
Sir David Madel (South-West Bedfordshire -- Con.) said many of his
commuting constituents would welcome the improvement in travel-to-work
costs in assessing maintenance.
Mr Frank Field (Birkenhead -- Lab.) -- chairman of the Social Secuirty
Select Committee, which made many recommendations for improvement in the
work of the CSA -- said the cost to the state of making up maintenance
payments was between 2p and 3p on the standard rate of income tax. He
asked if the Agency was performing its task more efficiently than the
system it replaced.
Mr Lilley said it had achieved savings of about #280m in the first
eight months of this financial year, compared with #180m in the same
period last year.
Mr Peter Thurnham (Bolton North East -- Con) welcomed Mr Lilley's
continued pursuit of ''feckless fathers'' and urged that
''fecklessness'' in the CSA should be tackled by contracting its work
out to the private sector where possible.
Mr Anthony Steen (South Hams -- Con) said the statement showed that
the Government not only listened to what the public said ''but acts on
what it hears.''
Mr Lilley said '' We have tried to listen to the experience and the
concerns that have arisen over the first 18 months of theperation of the
Agency.''

TREASURY Minister Sir George Young is treating his morning cuppa with

Sir George almost found himself in intensive care after a new

The mistake was spotted moments before Sir George lifted the cup to
his lips.
The Financial Secretary to the Treasury usually has his tea prepared
by a departmental messenger, but his new secretary, Marion
Holden-Murphy, volunteered to do it.
She is believed to have picked up a carafe apparently containing water
-- but which had been left soaking in bleach -- and tipped its contents

<HEADLINE>Residency test denies benefit to thousands</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>980205812</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of people have had their applications for social security
benefits rejected under new rules requiring claimants to show they are
chiefly resident in the UK, Ministers disclosed yesterday.
The Commons was told that 12,571 were refused income support following
the introduction of the habitual residency test on August 1. The
unsuccessful applicants included 1633 British citizens.
However, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley rejected a call from
Labour MP Max Madden (Bradford West) for the test to be abolished.
Mr Madden accused him of failing to reveal the test would be applied
to British citizens when he first announced it at a Tory Party
conference.
''It should be scrapped before any more British citizens are denied
the benefits to which they are fully entitled.''
However, Mr Lilley replied: ''It is perfectly reasonable that those
who have made their lives elsewhere in the world -- who were originally
British citizens or who can claim patrial citizenship -- should be
subject to this test.''
To Tory cheers, he demanded: ''Why should somebody who is coming over
here on a backpacking holiday from Canada, and who happens to have two
British grandparents, have the right to top up their income while on
holiday with income support?''
Mr Nigel Evans, Tory MP for Ribble Valley, insisted that if the rules

A MAJOR change in the operation of the child support system will
introduce limited discretion to alter an initial maintenance assessment
''to provide a safety valve for the genuine hardship cases.''
It will require legislation and come into effect in the financial year
1996-97.
The initial decision will be taken by the Agency but dissatisfied
clients will be able to ask for fresh consideration by an independent
Child Support Appeal Tribunal.
Both absent parents and parents with care will be able to seek a
departure from the maintenance formula under specified circumstances.
These are likely to include travel-to-work costs, high costs of travel
to maintain contact; expenses arising form long-term illness; the cost
of caring for stepchildren and any debts accrued from the former
relationship between the parents.
A departure will only be made if it is fair to both parents. Mothers
may also apply if they feel an assessment is unrealistically low, or a
former partner has deliberately created excessive costs to escape
obligations.
The changes include:
* Limits to the CSA's role. Plans due to come into effect next year to
allow separated parents not on benefit to use the agency have been
shelved indefinitely.
* Allowance to be made of property or capital settlements made before
April 1993. This will assume that ex-partners were entitled to half of
any equity worth more than #5000. This is expected to ease the burden on
about 50,000 men on middle incomes, who believed they had settled with
their partners by handing over property in lieu of future maintenance.
* Help with high travel-to- work costs. Allowances of 10p a mile will
be paid where people have to travel more than 15 miles to get to work.
* Changes to the formula to guarantee that an absent parent is left
with at least 70% of their net income after paying maintenance. Figures
last year showed 40,000 men had been left with less than this.
* Full allowance for housing costs for new partners and stepchildren.
At present, the amount allowed for housing costs is reduced in cases
where a parent has a new partner or stepchildren.
* Changes to the mathematical formula used to calculate maintenance.
This will soften the impact on better-off parents who at the moment can
be faced with bills of #400-plus a week for three teenage children. They
would now pay a maximum of #250.
* Higher rate interim assessments. Currently interim assessments are
made when an absent parent fails to provide sufficient information for
an assessment to be completed. Wealthier parents, who may pay less under
an interim assessment, have exploited these.
* Maintenance credit to be paid to parents with care when they come
off income support. This will enable them to build up a credit of up to
#1000, payable when they start work of 16 hours a week or more.
* Where the agency has contributed significantly to a parent running
up arrears of maintenance, not more than six months will be enforced and
the Government will compensate the parent with care.

<HEADLINE>Labour and SNP in bitter clash over cut in VAT on fuel</HEADLINE>

LABOUR and the SNP were involved in a new row at Westminster last
night after Labour Front Bench spokesman Alistair Darling launched a
ferocious attack on the Nationalists.
At issue was an SNP plan to cut the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel
to 5% instead of the Government's planned 8%. Labour claimed that while
it opposed VAT on fuel bills the 8% had to be put through as a
technicality.
The SNP's move to reduce it to 5% was described by Labour as ''not
serious politics'' and as a cynical move by a party desperate to make an
impact.
However, the SNP stance attracted some support from hard-left Labour
MPs. Seven voted with the SNP when the matter came to the vote, although
the Government won by a huge majority.
Mr Darling, MP for Edinburgh Central, told the House: ''It is
unfortunate that, as in other matters, the Nationalists insist on seeing
the matter before us as a fight between Scotland and England and that,
somehow, the tax is being imposed on Scotland but not England.
''To Labour members, the battle is not and never will be between
Scotland and England. In this case, the battle was between the Tories
and the rest of the country, and on this occasion the rest of the
country won and the Tories lost.
''I find it deeply distasteful that yet again a nasty element is
introduced that, somehow, the measure is being imposed on Scotland by
another country. I find that repulsive as a patriotic Scotsman.
''I wish the Nationalists would not insist on introducing that
unpleasant element into Scottish politics time and time again. Coldness
knows no political or geographical boundaries.
''Of course, it is generally colder in Scotland than it is in England,
but it is cold in England as well, as any pensioner who, even as we
speak is freezing because they cannot afford to heat their house, will
testify.''
The Deputy Speaker, Mr Geoffrey Lofthouse, had to intervene as the SNP
tried to hit back at Mr Darling's comments, described at one stage by
the SNP's parliamentary leader Mrs Margaret Ewing as ''hysterical.''
Mrs Ewing said: ''We are trying to ensure there is a reduction in VAT
on domestic fuel as far as is allowed under legislation. The Labour
Party simply is miffed that it did not put down such an amendment.''
As tempers frayed, SNP leader Alex Salmond told Mr Darling: ''You had
better explain to your constituents and supporters north and south of
the Border why Labour is not prepared to vote for five per cent VAT on
fuel in Scotland and England.''
A number of Labour MPs expressed sympathy with the SNP's point of
view, but in the end only seven voted with the SNP. They were: Harry
Barnes (Derbyshire North East), Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West), Jeremy
Corbyn (Islington North), Alice Mahon (Halifax), Dr John Marek
(Wrexham), James Marshall (Leicester South) and Mr Dennis Skinner
(Bolsover).
Mr Malcolm Bruce, for the Liberal Democrats, said there was a strong
case for reducing VAT to 5% and to offset the cost with a carbon energy
tax.
Labour's Thomas Graham (Renfrew West and Inverclyde) said some people
in his area had been found dead ''behind a door'' because of
hypothermia. VAT would make it ''extremely difficult'' for people in a
really bad winter.
Last night, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson accused the SNP
of ''posturing,'' and pointed out that not only had they failed to get
all their own MPs present at the House but had not secured support from
the Welsh Nationalists, Plaid Cymru.
However, Mr Salmond accused the Labour Front Bench of scoring ''an
astonishing own goal,'' and stated: ''It beggars belief that the Labour
Front Bench sat on their hands in this crunch vote. The convoluted
reasoning and hysterical anti-SNP outbursts of Alistair Darling cut no
ice with those suffering from fuel-poverty across the country.''
For the Government, Paymaster General David Heathcoat-Amory said that
at least the SNP had been consistent on the matter and he accused Labour
of ''wriggling.''
He said the SNP's bid to reduce the rate to 5% would cost #500m --
money that would have to be made up by further spending cuts or
increased tax.
The House later debated amendments aimed at attempting to lower the
duty on whisky by 10% in order to help the industry. However, the
Government's proposals for rises in the cost of drink went through by
290 votes to 251, a majority of 39.
0 Mrs Ewing said the Scotch whisky industry was ''furious'' about the
extra duty, ''because they are working extremely hard to promote their
product''.
Mr Bruce accused the Chancellor of proposing the drink increases in a
fit of ''political pique''.
On taxes on petrol and other carbon fuels, Mr Heathcoat-Amory said Mr
Clarke's reaffirmation that road fuel duties would rise in real terms by
at least 5% a year ''sends a clear signal to manufacturers to build more
fuel-efficient vehicles, and to customers, who should buy them''.
For the Opposition, Ms DawnPrimarolo said the increase would impose an
extra #51 tax on the average motorist.
''These increases must not be seen as a contribution to a strategy on
the environment,'' she insisted.
The petrol duty increases were approved without a vote, as were rises
in tobacco duty..
Mr Heathcoat-Amory said the rise of 10p on a packet of 20 cigarettes
was in line with the Government's commitment to increase tobacco duty
each year by at least 3% in real terms.
However, Ms Primarolo warned the increase hit low-income groups
hardest as they were more inclined to smoke.

THE Prime Minister sent out further reassuring signals yesterday to
Ulster Unionists about London-Dublin negotiations to further the peace
process. The result will be judged by the politicians and people of
Northern Ireland, he said.
He repeated his promise that there will be no attempt to impose joint
cross-border institutions.
''When the proposals are published, you will find no provision for the
British and Irish Governments to exercise joint authority over the
affairs of Northern Ireland. That has never been our intention, and that
will not be our proposal,'' he said.
Mr Major used a meeting at No. 10 with representatives of Northern
Ireland district councils to try to calm Unionist fears about joint
institutions, releasing his opening remarks to the media.
Before the meeting on economic progress, he called in Ulster Unionist
leader James Molyneaux for an hour's private talk which was described as
''good'' by both sides.
Mr Molyneaux had warned on Saturday that the British and Irish
Governments were conspiring to introduce British-Irish authority over
the Province.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring are to try to clinch a deal on a joint framework
document when they meet in London on Thursday.
However, both Governments will need more time to consider an agreement
and when to publish it.
Mr Major told mayors, chairmen and chief executives of Northern
Ireland District Councils: ''The document has only one purpose, which is
to help the political parties themselves to find an agreed way forward
in the talks process. But, as we have repeatedly said, there will be no
question of the two Governments imposing a blueprint on the parties.
These will be proposals for negotiation.''
He said he wanted the document completed as soon as possible. The
people would then be able to consider all suggestions, including the
joint framework proposals.
''The need for consent remains paramount. Any agreed outcome will
finally be put to the people of Northern Ireland in a referendum. The
voice of the people will decide these matters,'' he said.
British Government sources said there was ''no question of sovereignty
being pooled'' between Dublin and London.
However, it it was pointed out: ''That is different in kind from
structures and decisions which are taken for example by a new Northern
Ireland assembly on the basis of a democratic decision taken by the
people of Northern Ireland and by the main political parties there.''
Mr Major said Northern Ireland councils will be allowed to double what
they spend from their rates to 4p in the pound. Resource element in the
general grant is to be increased by #2m to #20m. Community regeneration
is to get another #5m to exploit economic prospects arising from the
ceasefire.
Sinn Fein -- which does not currently chair any council -- complained
it had been excluded from the meeting, claiming this was a further sign
of economic discrimination against nationalists.
When some of its councillors attended Mr Major's economic investment
conference in Belfast in December, they walked out within minutes of the
opening.
They complained that party leader Gerry Adams was not invited -- even
though he is not an elected representative.
Meanwhile, Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
was begining a series of meetings with leading political figures in
Washington.

EDINBURGH-born Admiral Sir Jock Slater, currently Vice-Chief of the
Defence Staff, is to become the next Chief of Naval Staff and First Sea
Lord.
Sir Jock, a no-nonsense and jackets-off seaman, becomes ruler of the
Queen's Navy at a particularly hard time after the defence cuts.
He was one of those intimately involved in the decisions that caused
huge concern in Scotland -- not least the one that saw Trident refits
going to Plymouth instead of Scotland and the subsequent one to close
Rosyth as a naval base.
Sir Jock will succeed Sir Ben Bathurst as First Sea Lord in July.
He was a former pupil of Edinburgh Academy and Sedbergh. He entered
the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth in 1956, passing out two years
later with the Sword of Honour and the Queen's Telescope.
He had joined the Navy as John Cunningham Kirkwood Slater, but soon
became known to one and all in the service as Jock.
As a lieutenant at the turn of the sixties, he served on board the
royal yacht Britannia, and was Equerry to the Queen for three years.
In 1982, he became the first captain of HMS Illustrious, one of
Britain's three aircraft carriers.
As vice-admiral, he became Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland
in 1987.
In 1991, he was promoted to admiral when he became Commander-in-Chief
Fleet. In this job it was he who had to make recommendations over which
base would refit the Trident missile. Up until then, there had been no
doubt the submarine would go to Rosyth, but the Devonport alternative
eventually triumphed.

<TEXT>
THE Prince of Wales's personal valet last night resigned after
admitting ''gross misconduct'' by betraying his master's trust.
Mr Ken Stronach's 16 years of service in the Prince's household ended
in disgrace after he admitted he took sneak photographs at Charles's
Highgrove home in Gloucestershire, and talked to a Sunday newspaper.
St James's Palace also acted to gag Mrs Wendy Berry, a former
Highgrove housekeeper, who was allegedly trying to sell more bedtime
secrets from the Prince's household.
An injunction banning her from making further revelations was obtained
by Prince Charles's lawyers in the High Court yesterday, said Mr Henry
Boyd-Carpenter of Farrer and Co, acting for the Prince.
Mrs Berry was also ordered by the court to surrender all diaries and
other manuscripts in her possession to the Prince's solicitors.
She was reported to have kept diaries of her nine years as housekeeper
at Highgrove, whichincluded intimate details of the lives of the Prince
and Princess of Wales.
The News of the World said she planned to publish the diaries and
claimed the Princess slept at Highgrove with James Hewitt while the
Prince was away. Mr Hewitt has said he had a five-year affair with the
Princess.
Royal employees are forbidden from disclosing details of their years
of service and speaking to the media by their contracts.
Mr Stronach, 50, loses his #12,000-a-year job, his grace and favour
home in south London, and his car.
In a statement, Mr Boyd-Carpenter said: ''Disciplinary procedures
against Mr Stronach have proved unnecessary. Mr Stronach has accepted
that his actions, with respect to the articles in the News of the World
of 15th January, constituted gross misconduct under the terms of his
contract.
''In view of his 16 years of previously unblemished loyal service, his
resignation has been accepted.
''Mr Stronach has made a full apology to the Prince of Wales and has
reiterated that he has received no payment whatsoever from the
newspaper.
''Mr Stronach and Mr Ken Stronach Jr have agreed to give perpetual
undertakings to the court not to commit any further breaches of Mr
Stronach's confidentiality undertaking, and to account for any money
they may receive.
''The matter is now closed,'' the statement said.
With regard to Mrs Berry, it added: ''An interim court order has been
made against Mrs Wendy Berry restraining her from any further discussion
of her employment within the household of the Prince and Princess of
Wales.
''Mrs Berry has been ordered by the court to surrender all diaries and
other manuscripts in her possession to the Prince's solicitors. In
addition an order will be sought requiring her to account for any money
she may have received.''

PRIVATE Lee Clegg, a paratrooper serving a murder sentence for killing
a joyrider at a Northern Ireland checkpoint, was given new hope last
night of release from prison.
Private Clegg's appeal failed in the House of Lords last week -- but a
statement issued by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary,
indicated that the case could be reconsidered by Northern Ireland
courts.
This could happen if Sir Patrick considered ''there is new evidence,
or any other consideration of substance, tending to render the
conviction unsafe and unsatisfactory. If that power were exercised the
Court of Appeal would consider the whole case afresh, treating the
proceedings for all purposes as an appeal''.
Despite the failure of Private Clegg's appeals on the mainland, Sir
Patrick emphasised last night that the Court of Appeal in Northern
Ireland could look at his case again, as public pressure built up for
him to have the Paratrooper's life sentence changed.
Even if an appeal in Northern Ireland fails, Sir Patrick, after
consultation with the Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland and the
original trial judge, still has the power to order Private Clegg's
release from prison on licence.
A statement from the Northern Ireland Office last night said that Sir
Patrick had the power to review ''all the circumstances of the case,
including the time already spent by Private Clegg in custody''.

AN AMERICAN lawyer has accused Shell and Esso of an ''unprecedented
attack against defenceless widows, orphans, and injured men'' in their
responses so far to claims arising from the Cormorant Alpha helicopter
tragedy.
The corporations' immediate counter was to take legal action -- again
-- effectively blocking the families from continuing to pursue
compensation claims in Texan courts, where awards are generally 20 times
higher than those in Britain.
Both firms confirmed last night that they had been to the Court of
Session for extensions to interdicts preventing the plaintiffs from any
further actions.
The companies say the compensation process must not go ahead until the
question of jurisdiction is resolved, and are pledged to carry forward
arguments ''through every possible legal process''.
Their Court of Session move came within 24 hours of American lawyer
Robert Keaty formally filing for sanctions and fees against Shell UK and
Esso Exploration and Production UK Ltd in a court in Texas.
His submission follows a Texan judge last month highlighting factual
inaccuracies and contradictions in the companies' affidavits on the
North Sea helicopter tragedy.
Judge Neil Caldwell not only found that Shell and Esso had business
links in Texas, but had undertaken a series of deliberate, calculated
manoeuvres to obstruct and impede the families and survivors, to their
severe disadvantage. He ruled their compensation claims could be heard
in Texas.
Awards in UK courts to the family of a victim would be limited to
#75,000 and to #10,000 for survivors. In America, a family could expect
to receive $1.5m.
Eleven men died when a Bristow-owned Super Puma crashed seconds after
taking off from Shell's Cormorant Alpha platform in appalling conditions
en route to a nearby accommodation platform in March 1992. Six,
including the pilot, survived.
Mr Keaty's motion alleges the firms have made ''bad faith assertions''
in courts in Scotland, England, and the US in a long-running battle
aimed at stopping the compensation cases being heard in America.
Mr Keaty asks that the companies be found in contempt of court; for an
award of sanctions and fees; and for whatever other relief the court
deems appropriate.
If successful, the motion could result in hundreds of thousands of
dollars being paid out over and above the compensation case, which could
run to millions of dollars if heard in the US.
However, Shell and Esso will seek the Texan equivalent of a judicial
review of the judge's findings. They also confirmed that the families'
actions had been effectively halted at least until a further Court of
Session hearing in February.
Mr Keaty's motion to the Texan court underlines examples of the
companies' alleged violation of Texan rules of civil procedure, with
particular references against Shell UK secretary Richard Wiseman and
EEPUK lawyer Julian Armstrong.
His document also refers to previous injuctions in British courts
against the families, who faced jail for contempt if they continued to
pursue compensation claims in the US.
It states: ''Such an unprecedented attack by such multinational
corporations against defenceless widows, orphans and injured men,
threatening them with bodily imprisonment . . . must be discouraged.''
A date for the hearing has still to be set, but is likely to be within
days.
Mr Keaty, representing claims arising from 10 deaths and three
personal injuries, filed his motion after that demanding the companies,
in light of Judge Caldwell's findings, drop actions in the Texas State
Court and proceedings in the Court of Session and England aimed at
preventing claims being heard in Texas.
He alleges the companies, in earlier UK proceedings, tried to
''wrongfully delay and impose financial and logistical hardships'' on
the claimaints who either lost their husband or father or their own
ability to make a living.
In a statement to The Herald, Shell and Esso stood by the veracity of
evidence given by Mr Wiseman and Mr Armstrong, and strenuously denied
any suggestions of unreliability in their affidavits.
However, the firms, in giving notice of appeal on Judge Caldwell's
ruling, acknowledged they believed Scotland to be the appropriate and
only forum for resolving the issues.
The statement said that clarity on the matter of jurisdiction was of
great importance, and consequently ''the companies have no alternative
but to carry forward their argument through every possible legal
process''.

BRITAIN claimed a diplomatic breakthrough in the fight to ban veal
calf crates last night. Mr William Waldegrave, Agricultural Minister,
said after meeting other EU Farm Ministers that the practice of crating
calves was now ''doomed''.
He said: ''Farmers should get out of this business now. If they do,
they will be ahead of the market.''
Mr Waldegrave said he found widespread support for Britain on the
issue, especially from the three new member states of Austria, Sweden,
and Denmark. The French, he reported, did not speak against although
they are big importers of calves for crates and French farmers are
opposed to crating being banned.
''Progress has been much better than I dared to hope. No voice was
raised in favour -- no voice at all,'' he said.
After four hours of talks, Mr Waldegrave told reporters he welcomed a
move by the commission to speed up a review of the practice of using
crates to rear veal calves.
The practice, banned since 1987 in the UK as unnecessarily cruel, has
attracted huge demonstrations by animal welfare groups in the South of
England at ports where 500,000 calves are exported annually, many of
them destined for crates on the Continent.
Only two member states, not mentioned by Mr Waldegrave but probably
Italy and Spain, failed to contribute to the discussion. Otherwise, said
the Minister, there was support from all round the table, especially
from the Danes, Dutch, Germans, Austrians, Swedes, Finns, and Irish.
The new EU Farm Commissioner, Mr Franz Fischler, agreed to set up a
committee of scientists and veterinarians to review the crating of
calves now instead of sometime before 1997.
''This is very encouraging,'' Mr Waldegrave said, ''because it sends a
signal to the industry that the days of veal crates are numbered and
people who have invested in this had better get out of this business
now.''
He announced that journey times for the transport of animals would
also be reviewed.
Mr Waldegrave expects crates to be banned within two to four months.
''We must press very hard not to allow a delay to take place,'' he said.
* Mr Ernest Oliver, owner of a private dock targeted by animal rights
protesters, has been given police protection following an attack at his
home.
Mr Oliver, who has a six-month contract to export live animals to the
continent from the Essex port of Brightlingsea, discharged a shotgun
into the air when hunt saboteurs tried to break into the grounds of his
home near Clacton on Saturday.
Yesterday Geoffrey Markham, assistant chief constable of Essex, said
he believed militant activists might physically attack Mr Oliver.
''I have taken certain steps to protect him as I consider him to be a
person at risk,'' he said. ''There are a number of persons in this
county who are at risk and we have decided to protect him.''

<HEADLINE>Koresh brainwashed Waco cult, inquiry told</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A MAN who lost his wife and five grown-up children in the Waco siege
inferno told an inquest yesterday how his family was brainwashed by the
''devil- motivated'' David Koresh.
Sam Henry, 58, told the hearing that he had warned the US authorities
in a letter nine months before the Texas tragedy, in which 75 members of
the Branch Davidian cult died, that Koresh was dangerous.
A top British detective told the inquest in Manchester into the 23
Britons who died at Waco that the raid by special agents from the US
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which led to the 51-day
stand-off at the Mount Carmel Centre, was doomed to failure from the
outset.
Detective Chief Superintendent Albert Yates, who led an investigation
into the tragedy on behalf of Manchester coroner Leonard Gorodkin, said
the victims were ''ensnared, trapped, seduced'' by Koresh and his
interpretation of the scriptures.
In his evidence, Mr Henry said his daughter Diana, 27, a graduate
studying for a master's degree, became embroiled in the cult.
His wife Zilla, 56, and the rest of the family later left him without
warning to go to Texas and join Koresh.
He and his wife had brought up their children in the mainstream
Seventh Day Adventist Church, but he had been the only one who refused
Koresh's attempts to convert him, when he had visited Diana in Texas.
''I felt he was trying to brainwash me,'' said Mr Henry, of Old
Trafford, Manchester, said. ''He became almost hysterical and actually
threatened to whip me''
His last contact with his family was a telephone conversation with his
son Phillip, 22, five weeks before the federal agents raided the camp.
''I said, 'You have called me a fool for not joining you, but sooner
or later you will realise that your father is not a fool as you all made
me out to be'.
''They alienated me because I didn't join them. David Koresh gave the
impression that I didn't love them because if I loved them I would have
joined them. They were so brainwashed that anything he told them went --
anything.''
He said his family believed Koresh to be a great prophet and a man of
God, but he was convinced he was possessed by the devil.
His disciples believed in the end of the world -- but thought they
would return later. Koresh had predicted he would die in 1993 and had
gathered his followers together at Waco as sacrifices.
Mr Henry said he had written to the US authorities nine months before
the raid in 1993, warning that Koresh could be ''another Jim Jones''.
Fifteen years earlier, 913 followers of the Rev Jim Jones died in a
Guyana jungle, most after taking a cyanide-laced fruit drink.
Mr Yates criticised the American handling of the crisis. ''The ATF
raid on February 28, 1993, was doomed to fail from the outset. It had
very little if any chance of success,'' he said.
''It put, quite clearly, police officers and those within the Mount
Carmel centre at unnecessary risk of tragic consequences. All was lost
from the moment the agents arrived outside the centre.''
He said that there were hundreds of different police forces at work in
the US and he could never find one person who was in charge of the Waco
incident.
Mr Yates said that hundreds of guns and more than two million rounds
of ammunition were found in the centre. But he set this in the context
of the US ''gun culture'' -- and Texas in particular.
''There are over 50 million people in this country and between them
they own just short of 400,000 guns. In Texas alone it is reported that
16 million people own 68 million guns,'' he said.
Families of other victims told how their relatives fell under Koresh's
spell. Their telephone calls to the compound were monitored and the
followers would talk continually about their work on the ''Seven
Seals''.
Some came to regard Koresh as a messiah.
Paul Horslen, whose brother-in-law Winston Blake, 28, from Nottingham,
was killed in the initial gun battle, said he had been worried that
Koresh was planning a mass suicide.
Mr Horslen spoke of reports that Koresh claimed all the women at the
camp as his own. He was said to have fathered several children by women
there.
The inquest was adjourned.

THE United States Supreme Court yesterday let stand a jury's finding
that Pan American airlines was guilty of wilful misconduct in the
terrorist bombing that killed 270 people over Lockerbie in 1988.
The court turned down the airline's argument that the trial judge
wrongly excluded evidence that PanAm officials thought they were
complying with federal rules for inspecting airline baggage and
therefore did not commit wilful misconduct.
A bomb exploded aboard PanAm flight 103 on December 21, 1988, killing
all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie.
The families of more than 200 victims filed wrongful death lawsuits
against PanAm and its security firm, Alert Management Systems.
Three of the cases were tried before a New York federal judge in 1992.
The jury found wilful misconduct by PanAm after hearing evidence that
the airline ignored warnings that its baggage security system was
inadequate. That verdict was binding on the other cases.
The jury also awarded damages totalling almost #13m to the three
families, although parts of those awards were set aside by an appeal
court.
An international treaty limits airlines' liability for crashes on
international flights to #50,000 a person, unless wilful misconduct by
the airline caused the disaster. Lawyers for the families said PanAm
repeatedly cut back on security to save money.
Last night, Dr Jim Swire, spokesman for Victims of Lockerbie, said of
the decision: ''You cannot replace people with money, but it gives me a
sense of relief. It is also a weight off my shoulders, because there was
always the danger that my efforts may have impeded the process.''
* Arrest warrants have been issued in the US and Scotland for two
Libyan suspects, but Tripoli so far has refused to hand them over for
trial.
However, US intelligence reports have named the paymaster behind the
bombing as a senior Iranian diplomat, Ayatollah Mohtashami, according to
the Daily Record. It says that declassified reports from the US Air
Force Air Intelligence Agency claim he paid terrorists $10m in cash and
gold to blow up the flight.
The files say Lockerbie was an act of revenge for the shooting down of
an Iranian aircraft by the warship USS Vincennes in July 1988, and that
Mohtashami was a long-term friend of terrorist Abu Nidal.

THE head of television at BBC Scotland yesterday angrily dismissed
suggestions that his drama department was in crisis, had no clout, and
was ''utterly answerable to London''.
Mr Colin Cameron was incensed at comments made last week by the
Greenock writer Peter McDougall, whose adaptation of the award-winning
novel Swing Hammer Swing has been cancelled by BBC executives in London.
''I think Peter McDougall is a very fine dramatist but, as an economic
analyst, he still has a lot to learn. In the bidding process, there are
inevitably casualties. I am sad that Swing Hammer Swing was one of
those, but it has to fight its way in a very aggressive market-place.
''It is certainly not evidence of BBC Scotland being marginalised.
Indeed, it is quite the contrary,'' he said.
Mr Cameron said that, under Andrea Calderwood, his new head of drama,
BBC Scotland had quadrupled its output this year -- and there was still
more to come.
''There is no crisis. What we have is a case of Gaelic myth-making. I
think it's fair to say that the levels of commissions from BBC Scotland
had tailed off quite seriously over the last two or three years. But on
the basis of her commissions for this year there is certainly no
evidence that Andrea (and by implication me) lack the clout when it
comes to dealing with London.
''Peter McDougall has always had this notion, whether wittingly or
not, that BBC Scotland has bags of money to hand out on whatever it
wants. That has never been the case. What we are doing now is making
sure there is something we can really pitch for.
''What annoys me most of all is that, by getting into this knee-jerk
whingeing, we are actually doing production in Scotland down because it
simply confirms everyone's view of Scots as whingeing Jocks. And it is
saying to the talent base in Scotland: 'Don't go to BBC Scotland because
it won't get you anywhere'.''
One reason for Swing Hammer Swing being cancelled, he said, was that
the BBC was looking for more contemporary original drama.
''The book was very much a eulogy to a Glasgow of the seventies which
has changed. I think Peter did a very fine adaptation, but it was a very
expensive project and we obviously looked at ways of seeing how we could
reduce the budget -- but we couldn't do that without damaging the
essence of what he had to say.
''In the end hard decisions had to be made and we could not justify
that kind of investment,'' Mr Cameron said.
Swing Hammer Swing, which would have been a 90-minute film, would have
cost #1.6m to make. This compares to the #1m it cost to make the
Scottish feature film, Shallow Grave.

SCOTTISH Television claimed yesterday that Scotland Today has
increased its lead over Reporting Scotland. The average audience last
year for its early evening news flagship was 537,000 while the estimate
for its BBC Scotland rival -- in the Central Scotland area -- was
375,000.
This gave Scottish a 42% share, compared to 29% for the BBC, ''an
unprecedented gap'', according to Mr Blair Jenkins, director of
broadcasting for the commercial station.
However, although the lead represents a significant improvement, the
figures do not take account of the fact that Reporting Scotland covers
the whole of the country.
In general viewing terms, Scottish Television said that it had
strengthened its position as the most watched channel in Central
Scotland last year. Viewing figures for the year showed an increase of
3% in the average audience.
Scottish also disclosed yesterday that its own soap opera, Take The
High Road, was once again back on the network, albeit informally. The
programme came under threat two years ago when ITV decided that it no
longer wanted it for national consumption. However, after a public
campaign, Scottish Television decided to continue making one episode a
week as part of its own regional output.
Scottish Television's managing director, Mr Gus Macdonald, said
yesterday that High Road was now being taken by every commercial station
except Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.

<HEADLINE>Quiet man who killed his wife with spade gets seven years</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>980205826</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A QUIET, hard-working husband, who for no apparent reason violently
battered his wife to death with a garden spade, was yesterday jailed for
seven years in a case the judge described as a ''tragedy of almost
Shakespearean proportions''.
Lord Johnston accepted that Vincent Bradley's ''horrific attack'' was
completely out of character and caused by a degree of mental illness,
which partially diminished his responsibility.
Bradley, 50, of Muirfield Drive, Glenrothes, was originally charged
with murdering his wife, Sandra, 46, by striking her repeatedly on the
head and body with a spade in their home on October 18.
After studying several psychiatric reports claiming that Bradley
suffered from a mental disorder bordering on, but not quite, insanity,
Mr Stephen MacGibbon, the Advocate-depute, accepted a guilty plea to the
lesser charge of culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished
responsibility.
The High Court at Kirkcaldy was told yesterday by Mr MacGibbon that
the Bradleys' 28-year marriage was relatively stable, although Bradley
had one conviction for choking his wife unconscious in 1986.
Since then Bradley, who had a long history of depression, had
attempted suicide on at least four occasions.
Mr MacGibbon said that Bradley called police after the attack. He told
them he thought he had killed his wife and said: ''I hit her on the head
with a spade.''
When officers arrived he directed them to an upstairs bedroom where
his wife's body lay on the bed, covered by a quilt. There was a spade
nearby.
The dead woman had suffered at least six blows, causing her neck to
break, which killed her. She also had a broken shoulder and the degree
of violence used was ''fairly self-evident'', Mr MacGibbon said.
Describing the case as ''strange and sad'', Mr Kevin Drummond QC,
defending, said that exhaustive inquiries among the couple's family,
neighbours, and workmates had failed to find any motive for the attack.
Bradley was a quiet, unassuming and hard-working man, who showed
nothing but affection for his wife, Mr Drummond said.
On the day of the attack, Bradley, said Mr Drummond, dressed for work,
but did not go. Then for reasons Bradley couldn't explain, something
resulted in him hitting his wife with the spade.
Bradley then sat with his dog in his lap for about one hour before
calling a relative and the police.
Lord Johnston, who was told Bradley's condition was now under control,
said: ''This case is a tragedy of almost Shakespearean proportions.
''Viewed objectively it is a horrific attack on an innocent victim
using considerable force, which would require the severest sentence this
court could impose.
''Viewed subjectively it is completely out of character and is caused
by a degree of mental illness which partially reduces your
responsibility.''
Lord Johnston said he could exercise a ''high degree of leniency'',
but a substantial sentence was necessary in view of the seriousness of
the offence.

PARENTS and doctors in the South-west of Scotland have been urged to
be extra vigilant after a teenage girl died of meningitis. A
five-month-old baby has also became ill with the disease.
Donna Downie, 15, from Stranraer, died on Sunday, about 48 hours after
being taken to Dumfries Infirmary with the symptoms of meningococal
meningitis, the most virulent form of the disease. Donna, of Airds
Crescent, Castle Kennedy, will be buried at Inch churchyard tomorrow.
Many of her schoolfriends will be at the funeral.
The five-month-old baby boy, from Kirkcudbright, was admitted to the
same hospital with the disease on Sunday, although health officials are
satisfied there is no link.
His condition was said to be ''settled and stable'' last night and his
parents were at his bedside.
Donna's parents, Garry and Sandra, were too upset to discuss the death
as prayers were said for their daughter at Stranraer Academy. Rector
Michael Davies said: ''There was a pervading air of gloom and sadness at
the school today. We had assemblies for all of the pupils and told those
who had not heard of this tragic loss what had happened.
''It has been a very moving day, and we are trying to console and
compose the pupils and give them a focus.''
After Donna had been admitted to hospital, doctors and officials of
Dumfries and Galloway Health Board began tracing her close contacts.
They were given injections of the antibiotic Rifampicin and must wait up
to 10 days before they know if they have escaped infection.
Doctors and parents have been warned to be on the lookout for early
symptoms of the disease, which are severe headache, stiff neck, and
vomiting. While meningitis can appear in the early stages like a
respiratory infection, the symptoms rapidly become more severe.
Dr David Breen, public health consultant with the health board, said:
''It is most unusual for us to have two such cases at the one time, but
they have occurred over 50 miles apart and we have found no connection.
''The symptoms can occur very suddenly and it is difficult for young
children to articulate these symptoms clearly. If any parent is in any
doubt, he or she should consult their doctor at once.''
Dr Breen said that 20% of the population carried the bacterium, but
the link between it lying dormant and manifesting itself as the deadly
disease has still to be established.

<HEADLINE>Accused knew how much atropine could added to bottle without being tasted, court told Lecturer 'discussed details of tonic poison'</HEADLINE>

A UNIVERSITY lecturer, accused of endangering the lives of eight
people by leaving bottles of contaminated tonic water on supermarket
shelves, discussed technical details of the poison with one of his
alleged victims, a court heard yesterday.
Dr Paul Agutter knew how much atropine could be placed in drink before
its bitter taste could be detected, it was alleged.
Dr Agutter, who lectures in biochemistry at Napier University,
Edinburgh, also expressed regret that he had bought the tonic water and
poured out the drink which led to his wife being poisoned, the High
Court at Edinburgh was told.
Earlier, the court heard how a deeply distressed Dr Agutter had
discussed his marriage problems and the pressures caused by a new woman
in his life with his GP, after a suicidal-sounding telephone call.
Dr Agutter, 48, of Kilduff Lodge, Athelstaneford, East Lothian, denies
attempting to murder his wife, Alexandria, in their home by giving her
atropine in a glass of gin and tonic on August 28 last year. He also
denies trying to murder an 11-year-old girl on the same date.
He has also pled not guilty to endangering the lives of eight people
who drank poisoned tonic water, allegedly placed by him on the shelves
of Safeway Supermarket at Hunters' Tryst, Swanston, Edinburgh, on August
24.
Mrs Elizabeth Sharwood-Smith, 46, of Thorburn Road, Edinburgh, told
the court how she and her son, Andrew, 18, both fell ill after drinking
tonic water she had bought at Safeway on August 24.
They recovered the following day, but again took ill on drinking more
of the tonic on Friday August 26. This time both were admitted to
hospital and detained overnight. Their symptoms included feeling very
weak and very dry.
The following week she answered a telephone call to her home from Dr
Agutter, whose wife had also drunk poisoned tonic water by this time.
''He said he was very worried that his address had been published in
the newspapers, because he thought the perpetrator of this poisoning
might follow this up with another attack on his family at home. I said I
felt that was very unlikely.''
That weekend Dr Agutter arrived at her house and she felt that he
appeared quite nervous. He told her he felt terribly guilty, because he
had been the person who had done the shopping and had poured the drinks
out.
Mrs Sharwood-Smith said that she and her husband expressed great
frustration to Dr Agutter that nothing had been done about their belief
that the bottle of tonic had been at fault and that, if something had
been done, Dr Agutter's wife could have been saved from being poisoned.
''We felt very angry about this. He said: 'Don't worry. You did
everything you could'.''
Dr Agutter had talked in a lot of technical detail about atropine,
which by that stage had been established as the poison in the tonic
water.
Mrs Sharwood-Smith added: ''He knew what concentration you could put
in before you could taste it because it would have a bitter taste.''
Speaking about his own wife's illness, Dr Agutter said she had taken
ill more rapidly than Mrs Sharwood-Smith. It was suggested that Mrs
Agutter's bottle of tonic must have had a higher concentration of poison
than hers.
Dr Agutter allegedly replied: ''Oh yes, ours was much more
conentrated.''
She and her husband at one stage had thought a jar of instant coffee
with a broken seal might have been to blame. When this was mentioned to
Dr Agutter he said that you could not put atropine in coffee. Again, she
had found that surprising.
Mrs Marie Mason, 52, of Swanston Place, Edinburgh, told the court that
she had become dehydrated, had started talking ''gibberish'', and been
unable to stand up after drinking a bottle of poisoned tonic water
bought at Safeway.
Earlier, Dr Ross Langlands, the accused's GP, told the court that Dr
Agutter had consulted him in January 1989, complaining of stress. Dr
Agutter told him that his wife was leaving him. He had consulted him
again in May that year, again mentioning marital difficulties.
On August 17 last year there was a message on his answering service
that Dr Agutter had called in a deeply distressed state, suggesting that
he might be considering suicide.
He telephoned Dr Agutter who was ''almost incoherent'' and greatly
distressed and went round to see him at his home.
Dr Agutter had expressed concern about his financial problems. He
explained to the doctor that, although he and his wife were still living
under the same roof, their marriage was over.
They had reached a financial settlement but that had been eroded over
the years and he felt he was contributing more than had been agreed.
He said that he had had to take out two loans to cover the debts he
was incurring.
Dr Langlands added: ''I think he was generally unhappy about the way
he was being treated by his wife. He felt as if she was treating him
with some contempt.''
The GP said that Dr Agutter had told him that he had entered into a
new relationship. ''He felt a little bit under pressure from the lady in
this relationship that he ought to leave his wife and perhaps consider
marrying her.''
Dr Langlands said he spent about 90 minutes with Dr Agutter, talking
over his problems and possible solutions. By then he was very calm and
had decided that life was worth living.
The trial continues.

MR Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, insisted yesterday that the
Tories could be reunited before the crucial Maastricht 2 negotiations
next year.
He went out of his way to justify his appointment of Mr David Davis,
the Euro-sceptic Minister for Europe, to an intergovernmental study
group plotting a course for the negotiation next year.
Mr Davis's appointment -- replacing the less sceptical Mr David
Heathcoat-Amory in the Government's last reshuffle -- was seen as
another gesture to the anti-Europeans in the party. Mr Davis was a Whip
at the time Maastricht was going through the Commons.
There was some confusion over the significance of a report -- not
denied by the Foreign Office -- that Sir John Kerr, the permanent
representative to the EU in Brussels -- is to be moved to Washington as
the new British Ambassador.
Sir John, a Scot who was educated at Glasgow Academy, was one of the
authors of the Maastricht Treaty. He was dispatched to Brussels by Mrs
Thatcher. He once described Mr Jacques Delors's famous White Paper on
economic growth and competitiveness as ''intellectually respectable''.
Favourite for the job in Brussels is Mr Stephen Wall, the British
ambassador to Portugal, although the name of Mr Michael Jay, deputy
under secretary at the Foreign Office, is also said to be in the frame.
They are reputedly the two men who know most about Europe. Mr Wall has
also worked at 10 Downing Street.
Traditionally the Washington job has been seen as the pinnacle of a
British diplomat's career, although there has been a growing feeling
that the most important ambassadorship nowadays is the job in Brussels.
This is despite the fact that Britain employs 750 staff in Washington
and less than 100 in Brussels.
Observers assumed Sir John would have stayed on to guide Ministers
through the tough Maastricht 2 talks at which Mr Major has sought to
pre-empt significant constitutional change by saying he would slap on a
veto, if necessary.
By ruling out a slippage of sovereignty so far in advance, in response
to Euro-sceptics' demands, Mr Major is seen in Brussels as planning a
semi-detached membership of the EU for the foreseeable future if, as
expected, the other 14 member states agree to more political and
economic union.
Mr Hurd and other senior Cabinet Ministers, including Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, and Mr Michael
Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, are said to be increasingly
uneasy about Mr Major's accelerating drift to the Euro-sceptics.

SCOTTISH Enterprise's network of Local Enterprise Companies is to be
investigated by the European Commission after complaints that firms
represented on the boards enjoyed unfair advantages in the awarding of
contracts.
The news was announced yesterday in a letter to the Labour Euro-MP for
the South of Scotland, Mr Alex Smith, who has spent months querying the
activities of local enterprise companies.
Scottish Enterprise said last night it was aware of Mr Smith's
complaints and was confident there had been no improper conduct. It
would be happy to answer any questions the Commission might ask.
However, the agency, with a network of 13 Lecs and a budget of #464.6m
for this year, is privately angry with what officials regard as Mr
Smith's attempts to undermine its credibility.
It is understood to be taking legal advice on raising a formal
objection with the Commission in order to censure Mr Smith over his
''irresponsible behaviour''.
The investigation is the second to be launched in Scotland by the
Commission in a week. Before he retired formally yesterday as European
Regional Policy Commissioner, Mr Bruce Millan ordered an investigation
into how EU regional aid was used in Scottish utilities ahead of
privatisation. Under EU law, no EU funding can be used for fattening up
state-owned concerns ahead of sell-offs.
It will be the second time the activities of Scottish Enterprise have
been investigated by the Commission. Two years ago there were
allegations, denied by Scottish Enterprise, that it had failed to
account properly for money granted to it by the EU's social fund.
Mr Smith said that if local enterprise board members received benefit
through their companies from Scottish Enterprise, they were putting
themselves in an invidious position ''at the very least''.
He said: ''What they are doing is in conflict with the European
directive on public tendering. Although the Scottish Office and Scottish
Enterprise have denied this, I have sent extracts from various documents
and annual reports of Scottish Enterprise and local enterprise boards
for the Commission to look into. The Commission now seems to be saying
it thinks I am right.''
Mr Smith claimed the Government seemed to be encouraging the ''biggest
anti-competitive exercise in the whole of Scotland'' despite its
''continued lecturing us about the need to be competitive''.
He added: ''It should be possible, for example, for local authorities
to get their hands on some of the money available for training.''
A Scottish Enterprise spokesman said last night: ''Our legal advice is
that everything we have done has been conducted properly and we will be
quite happy to respond to anything the Commission asks of us.''
The findings of an inquiry into the workings of Scottish Enterprise by
the Commons Select Committee on Scottish Affairs early last year are due
to be reported soon.
The inquiry followed growing concern about public accountability
within the network, and The Herald publishing details of directors'
interests in contracts and grants awarded by Lecs.
The agency's spokesman said that, although the inquiry might recommend
changes, he was confident that its report would be favourable. He added
that the inquiry was a standard examination of a public body and was not
linked to concerns about public accountability.

MOVES towards easing Strathclyde's #107m budget shortfall, using an
accountacy device which would kill off many capital projects, has been
authorised by senior councillors.
The intention to switch #40m of revenue expenditure to the council's
capital budget is unlikely to eliminate the threat to nearly 1000
temporary contract workers, many of them in the Social Work Department,
and the possibility of redundancies among full-time staff.
However, the initiative could help save important services and avoid
an unacceptably high increase in council tax.
Having failed to persuade Scottish Secretary Ian Lang that Strathclyde
should be allowed to exceed its capping limit in order to avoid painful
service cuts, the council's Labour group executive has authorised its
chief executive, Mr Neil McIntosh, and director of finance, Mr Archibald
Gillespie, to hold further discussions with Scottish Office officials.
The region's Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, said yesterday:
''We have agreed that they should accept the Scottish Office invitation
of a further meeting to clarify our serious situation.''
The Labour administration has already considered possible cuts of
#66.5m, which would result in a 40% increase in council tax.
If the council did nothing about the #107m shortfall, it would mean a
65% increase in council tax. Even if it achieved the cuts of #107m, this
would still mean a 25% increase in council tax.
Mr Donald Shiach, secretary of Strathclyde's Joint Trade Union
Council, said the accountancy device would still leave a #67m shortfall,
and he was not hopeful that the council would be able to avoid
redundancies.

THE chief executive of insurance giant Prudential, Mr Mick Newmarch,
surprised the City yesterday by resigning abruptly after 40 years with
the firm.
His sudden departure from a job which paid him #834,000, according to
the last annual report, follows a simmering row over regulation of the
industry and a controversial share deal.
Mr Newmarch, who started at the Pru in 1955 at the age of 17,
campaigned against the establishment last year of the self-regulating
Personal Investment Authority.
He argued for tighter statutory control of the investment industry,
which has been dogged by large-scale mis-selling of personal pensions
and poor training of sales staff.
Last October, the Stock Exchange examined a share deal by Mr Newmarch
on the day a report on the pensions issue was published by the City's
top regulator, the Securities and Investments Board.
He exercised an option to trade shares in the Pru granted to him as an
executive perk. The coincidence of the share deal shortly before
publication of the SIB report raised eyebrows in the City.
However, in a statement last night, the Pru said no company or Stock
Exchange rules had been broken.
It said: ''The company wishes to state that all transactions by
Prudential directors or relevant employees are governed by the company's
own rules, which comply fully with Stock Exchange requirements and best
practice.
''Both Mr Newmarch and the company believe that they have acted
properly in this connection.''
Mr Newmarch explained to the board that the current relationship
between UK retail financial services regulators and both himself and the
company had become unacceptable to him and he felt he was being put in
an impossible position as chief executive of Prudential Corporation.
The board said they accepted his resignation ''reluctantly''.
Prudential's chairman Sir Brian Corby said that, pending the
appointment of a new chief executive, the board had asked him to take
executive responsibility for the group and also chair the executive
committee.
Chief executive since 1990, he joined the insurance giant with three A
levels straight from Tottenham grammar school in north London, beginning
his career in the economic intelligence unit.
He earned his economics degree through the hard slog of night classes.
He took the powerful position of investment manager in 1982. When he
moved into the chief executive's office, he was equally convinced about
what had to be done.
Out in the first few months of his rule went estate agency, the
disastrous diversification that had been costing #50m-a-year, and out
went much of the general insurance business.
''It was like taking over a garden that had got out of hand,'' he has
said.
His determination is legendary and one observer said that if any
businessman were to be willing to lay down his life for his company, it
would be this one.

AN AYR firm's five kilometre upgrading of the A74 to motorway, which
was completed well ahead of schedule and within budget, has underlined
the grim record of Italian contractors on another stretch of the road.
Barr Ltd not only faced similar engineering challenges but the same
bad weather upon which Castelli Girola partly blamed delays.
Managing director William Barr yesterday declined to criticise the
Italians' performance.
Mr Barr said: ''In the construction industry, joint ventures can be
difficult -- and working so far away from their base is a problem.''
He said his own company had 1000 employees and a huge fleet capable of
working Scotland's heavy clays, plus in-house capabilities in steel
plate girders, precast concrete components and quarrying. It was,
therefore, capable of taking immediate advantage of Scotland's fickle
weather windows and getting on with roadbuilding.
Barr's #20m Cleuchbrae to Dinwoodie Green section of motorway was
officially opened yesterday -- two months ahead of schedule -- by Sir
Hector Monro, Scottish Minister for the Environment.
Castelli Girola's #23.4m contract for a four-mile stretch at Annan,
Dumfriesshire, was also supposed to last 20 months. The likely
completion date is May, although some observers fear the original
deadline of last November could overshoot by more than a year.
Yesterday's ceremony coincided with Edinburgh-based Morrison
Construction confirming that talks with the Italians were being
''finalised'' for a joint venture to complete outstanding works.
It is not known if Morrison's would take over the project lock, stock,
and barrel. But such a scenario would clearly delight the Scottish
Office, which is embarrassed by the delays.
Castelli Girola faces a possible Scottish Office penalty of #250,000
for every month past the official completion date. Ministers would have
to be advised of any change because the Government contract is with
Castelli Girola, the British management subsidiary of two Milan firms.
A spokeswoman for Morrison's said the company was already involved in
an adjacent upgrading project, and in a position to commence work as
soon as agreement was reached.
The opening ceremony also coincided with Dumfries and Galloway
Regional Council confirming that an enforcement notice would be served
on Castelli Girola later this week.
The notice is designed to ensure adherence to the original terms of
planning permission to extract road-building materials from a site at
Kirtlebridge. Extraction should have finished last July and the site
reinstated to agricultural land, but the firm wants an extension to
August.
Barr's contract also required large quantities of road-building
materials. The firm's geologists found natural deposits of sand and
gravel adjacent to the stretch it was upgrading. Thousands of tonnes
were removed, with voids subsequently infilled.
Castelli Girola has denied some delays are down to importing machinery
more suited for duty in dry, hotter Continental climes, but has partly
blamed problems on bad weather.
Barr's, meanwhile, removed massive quantities of sub-soil, some 1.5
million cubic metres, in 10 months using its own fleet of earthmoving
plant, ''working through all sorts of bad weather in winter'' to achieve
the motorway's chosen alignment.
Castelli Girola's work recently ground to a halt as sub-contractors
demanded payments. The Scottish Office stepped in to advance #1.75m
against a bond from the company to allow work to continue.
Barr Ltd, of Heathfield, Ayr, finished its contract early despite
works including a bridge over the River Annan described as a substantial
engineering challenge. The design, in an area of historic and scenic
interest, even had to pass scrutiny by the Royal Fine Art Commission of
Scotland.
The contract also included the Kirkhill interchange, a bridge
providing north and south access to motorway services and the local road
network, plus a trial length of road marked off for cyclists which will
be extended to 100 kilometres if successful.
A spokesman for Barr Ltd yesterday put down its success to a proven
track record in road construction; its drive and professionalism; a
large, directly employed workforce and formidable fleet, and well
established support divisions. The official added: ''We are proud to
deliver yet again a quality contract ahead of schedule and within
budget.''
At the opening, Sir Hector said some 60% of the A74 between Millbank
and Gretna had now been upgraded to motorway. He also said it was
Scottish Office policy to ''maintain the rapid progress achieved to date
on this route''.
Mr Claudio Benvenuti, Castelli Girola's chief executive, failed to
return calls yesterday.

THE death of a child found unconscious in a hospital toilet cubicle
remained a mystery last night.
The child, two-year-old Christina Murtagh, had gone missing from her
bed at Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, Glasgow. She had
been released last week from another city hospital where she was taken
with a respiratory complaint.
A police inquiry was under way. A post-mortem examination failed to
determine exactly how she died.
Strathclyde Police have been treating the death as ''suspicious''. A
spokesman said: ''The results of the post-mortem were inconclusive and
further inquiries are now continuing into the girl's death.''
It is understood it could be weeks before further medical tests are
able to be evaluated.
The police spokesman added: ''It had been hoped that the results of
the post-mortem would have assisted us in solving this tragedy.''
Christina, from the Drumoyne area of Glasgow, was admitted to the
hospital on Thursday suffering from what a hospital spokesman described
as ''funny turns''.
Her admission came less than 24 hours after she had been released from
the Southern General Hospital where she had been detained overnight for
observation following a respiratory complaint.
As the girl's condition worsened she was taken back to the Southern
General by her family before eventually being transferred to Yorkhill,
where she remained along with her mother.
On Saturday, however, as medical investigations were being carried out
on Christina's complaint, she disappeared from her hospital bed.
A search of the ward was immediately instigated and within minutes
nursing staff found her unconscious in a toilet cubicle. She was
immediately taken to the intensive care unit and placed on a life
support machine.
However, she died around one o'clock on Sunday afternoon. Senior
medical staff, concerned by the circumstances, contacted the
procurator-fiscal who immediately ordered Strathclyde Police to
investigate the death.
The hospital official confirmed that doctors and nursing staff had
already been interviewed by detectives and had co-operated fully with
their inquiries.
A police spokesman said it was unlikely they would be speaking further
with medical staff on duty over the weekend period. He said police had
also spoken to the family of the dead girl in an attempt to determine
her medical history.

This is another hole below the waterline
George Robertson
SIR EDWARD Heath both undermined and overruled John Major yesterday
when he said that to call devolution a threat of any sort to the Union
was ''completely mistaken''.
This robust rejection of frequent claims by the Prime Minister was
seized on with alacrity by Labour. Mr George Robertson, Shadow Scottish
Secretary, commented: ''This is another hole below the waterline for the
Prime Minister on devolution.'' He said that Mr Major had called
Labour's plans for a Scottish parliament ''one of the most dangerous
propositions ever put before the British people. That view had been
decisively rejected by Ted Heath''.
Mr Robertson pointed out that Sir Edward, a former Conservative Prime
Minister, was only one of many senior Tories who at one time or another
had gone on record in support of devolution. Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, and Northern Ireland Minister
Michael Ancram had all been on the record backing it.
Sir Edward said during a BBC Radio 4 Today interview: ''How is it that
other countries -- Germany or France or the United States, with all its
states -- can have a form of devolution and can be immensely
successful?''
His remarks came as Mr Lang announced that, under the Government's
modest Taking Stock proposals to conduct more Scottish business in
Scottish committees, the Scottish Grand Committee of all the country's
72 MPs would have its first question time at Westminster on February 8.
The MPs will be able to cross-examine Scottish Ministers for 45 minutes
before a debate sponsored by the Scottish Liberal Democrats and a
half-hour adjournment debate.
Mr Lang said that this first-ever question session increased the
accountability of Scottish Office Ministers without weakening Scotland's
special position in the parliament of the Union.

A RADICAL reform of the controversial Child Support Agency was
unveiled by the Government yesterday, and came under fire from its
opponents, with accusations of too little, too late.
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley had aimed to convince critics
that both absent parents and those looking after children would get a
fairer deal from the new system.
Charities and pressure groups involved with families in need expressed
considerable doubt, despite what amounted to a substantial U-turn.
The Opposition, though prepared to support the broad thrust of the
changes, was concerned that ministerial delay in making such changes
might blunt their impact now.
Although the measures go far beyond reforms called for by the Commons
Social Security Select Committee, Mr John Findlay, director of the
Strathclyde-based lone parent organisation, One Plus, claimed the
Government was indulging in ''politicking'' in the timing.
''The fact that 1996-97 are likely to be election years gives one an
insight into the Government's thinking. The measures improving the lot
of the absent parent will come in then -- whilst the #5 credit, helping
mothers with children, will not be implemented till after the likely
election year.''
Mr Lilley had sought to counter claims by furious fathers that the
maintenance payments asked for were often unrealistically high, driving
some fathers to suicide, by putting a ceiling on the amount any absent
parent can be asked for. This will be 30% of net earnings, one-third for
parents also paying arrears.
He said new legislation would be introduced to allow appeals against
maintenance assessments in ''hard cases''.
These will be limited to cases in which either parent may argue that
certain expenses have not been taken into account in calculating
maintenance and the result would be to cause hardship. Initially the
agency itself will decide whether to make a change but a dissatisfied
parent would be able to ask for the matter to be considered afresh by an
independent Child Support Tribunal.
Some MPs feared the new tribunal would be swamped with cases. The
present independent tribunal adjudicates only on technical objections to
assessments and is still hard pressed.
Other changes outlined in a Government White Paper include recognition
of clean-break settlements made before the agency carried out an
assessment. This should cut maintenance demands on parents who handed
over property or cash in lieu of maintenance payments or in return for
an agreed lower figure.
Mr Lilley was jeered by MPs when he admitted: ''The CSA has performed
less well than I would wish despite hard work by its staff.''
He promised that where some parents had been presented with huge bills
for arrears through the agency's delays in making an assessment they
would not be asked to pay more than six months and the Government would
compensate the parents with care.
Mr Donald Dewar, Shadow Social Security Secretary, said the Opposition
would not carry out ''trench warfare'' against the legislation though
they would scrutinise it closely. But he said: ''The tragedy is that
reforms which might have made an impact 18 months ago will now have to
contend with the bitterness that has built up in the system.''
Mothers on benefit, who at present have the amount of maintenance
payments docked from their benefit, will from 1997 be able to build up a
credit payable when they return to work for more than 16 hours a week.
However, a spokeswoman for the Child Poverty Action Group said that
while they welcomed the fact that the Government was doing something
''we are concerned that it's aim is to silence its most vociferous
critics without going back to the drawing board as required. The balance
of the package is overwhelmingly to the advantage of absent parents and
not the parents with care.''
Spokesmen for the Law Society and the National Association of
Citizens' Advice Bureaux also suggested that parents looking after
children would still not receive enough help.
Mr Ian Maxwell, a spokesman for the Scottish Council for Single
Parents, claimed the Government had ''rolled over'' to the vociferous
lobby of absent parents facing maintenance demands at the expense of
those parents on benefit actually looking after the children involved.
''The Government was faced with two lobby groups and decided to
placate one, largely middle class men. In doing so, they have made the
lot of the other group, largely single mothers, harder,'' he said.
A leading Scots anti-CSA campaigner derided the rethink as ''too
little, too late''. Mr John Frame, chairman of the Scottish branch of
the Campaign for Fair Maintenance, said a number of suicides could have
been averted had yesterday's U-turn been effected sooner.
