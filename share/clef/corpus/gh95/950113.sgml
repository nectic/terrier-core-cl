NEW YORK: The Kennedys and the Cuomos have two new potential
candidates, twins born to the daughter of slain senator Robert Kennedy
and the son of former New York state governor Mario Cuomo. Cara Ethel
KennedyCuomo and Mariah Matilda KennedyCuomo were born 20 minutes apart
on Wednesday. Their mother, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, 33, is the daughter of
Ethel and Robert Kennedy, the former US attorney general who was
assassinated in 1968, and their father, Andrew Cuomo, works in the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The new parents did not
explain why they wanted the unusual combination spelling of the twins'
surname.

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord Fraser signalled last night that the
Government was not in favour of a proposal that the victims of crime
should have the right to be consulted over the punishment meted out to
offenders.
The move was put forward by leading Scottish judge Lord McCluskey
during the committee stage of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.
His suggestion is that, in any case in which an offender has been
convicted of a violent offence the prosecutor shall, if possible, place
before the court a victim impact statement which the court would
consider before passing sentence.
The statement would include items such as:
* The personal details of the victim.
* The physical, emotional and mental consequences to the victim.
* The financial results for the victim.
* The victim's recommendation, if any, to the court as to whether or
not leniency should be exercised in passing sentence.
However, Lord Fraser said last night: ''I fully accept the principle
that the effect of an offence on the victim or victims is a relevant and
important consideration in sentencing.
''It is an important means of determining the gravity of the offence
and therefore of the sentence, which is why procedures already exist to
bring relevant information to the attention of the courts.
''I would have thought that in most cases where such information is
properly brought before the courts in Scotland the procurator fiscal or
the advocate depute will have that information available, given our
system of precognition.
''I may have to return at a later point to whether it is desirable to
provide an impact statement in the form that Lord McCluskey has
suggested.''
The Bill, according to the Government, introduces a number of reforms
to the Scottish criminal justice system, designed to streamline its
operation and make it more accessible and responsive to those who come
into contact with it.
The main provisions include reform of bail legislation, giving the
courts new powers to deal with offending on bail (an issue which has
caused some concern), an enhanced system of intermediate diets before
trial to reduce the number of trials adjourned or cancelled at a late
stage.
There also is a change to the so-called ''right-to-silence'' which
will allow prosecutors to comment on failure of an accused to give
evidence, another issue which has attracted criticism from the
Opposition parties.
In a statement issued at Westminster last night, Labour's Front Bench
spokesman on Scottish legal affairs, Lord Macaulay of Bragar, said the
Government appeared to be eroding the accused's right to silence in
Scotland and pledged that Labour would seek to abolish the ''not
proven'' verdict in the Scottish courts.
He said: ''Labour will seek to amend this Bill to ensure it provides a
modern, efficient system of justice which promotes the interests of the
community while safeguarding the rights of the accused.
''The Scottish legal system must have effective safeguards if we are
to avoid miscarriages of justice.''

SNP leader Alex Salmond has attacked a decision by Tayside Region to
give the go-ahead for one of Scotland's richest men to apply for up to
#400,000 of public money to plant trees on his Highland estate.
The Duke of Atholl, who owns 135,000 acres of Perthshire land with an
estimated value of #140m, has applied for a Forestry Commission Woodland
Grant worth up to #400,000 to plant mixed woodland.
Mr Salmond said: ''I sometimes wonder if landed aristocracy have no
sense of shame about the extent to which they seem to be willing to dig
into the public purse. Many ordinary Scots struggling to keep their head
above water financially will look askance at an estate worth over #100m
grabbing #400,000 of public money.''
The application by Atholl Estates covers 1000 acres at Glen Bruar.
Tayside Region's planning commitee yesterday approved a report backing
the application.
Mr Salmond said, ''I think it raises serious questions about the whole
structure of land ownership and usage in Scotland. Labour's shadow
agriculture spokesman Gavin Strang said: ''Most people will see this as
over the top.
''We should encourage farmers and landowners to grow trees but there
should be a limit to the amount of taxpayers' money paid to wealthy
individuals.''
The duke's secretary at Blair Castle said last night he had travelled
to England and was ''not contactable''.

STUART Slater returned to Scotland yesterday, but his trip was no more
fruitful than his previous, and longer stay in the country, writes James
Traynor.
The former Celtic player, who failed miserably to make an impression
in the premier division, was unsuccessful with a claim that the club
owed him #62,000.
However, the slightly-built 25-year-old, currently playing with
Ipswich Town, is considering an appeal, which must be lodged with the
SFA within seven days.
Slater, who was represented by Scottish Professional Footballers'
Association secretary Tony Higgins, was surprised by the evidence
presented by Celtic director Dominic Kean, and will now seek access to
files held by Drury Communications, the agency which conducted his move
from West Ham to Celtic.
The player was sold to Celtic for #1.5m in July, 1992, and despite the
claims of the then manager, Liam Brady, that Slater would provide the
spark which Celtic required up front, he failed to trouble opposing
defences too much. Brady abandoned the exercise 13 months later, and
Slater was sold to Ipswich for #750,000.
Slater said yesterday he no longer has any ties with Drury
Communications and it may take a few days to seek the information he now
requires.
''I'll be having discussions with the agency, because there is
information we need before we can decide whether or not to appeal,''
said Higgins. ''There is something in this agency's files which, if we
have access to it, might make Stuart's position stronger.''
Higgins explained that this course of action is necessary because the
case put forward by Celtic contained information about which neither
Slater or Higgins were aware.
''This case is to do with the interpretation of the signing-on fee and
the way the whole contract was arranged,'' Higgins added. ''Celtic felt
that Stuart was not entitled to a final payment.''
The player himself said he was disappointed with yesterday's outcome,
but Celtic's representative left fairly pleased with himself after the
45-minute hearing. ''We felt the contract was terminated by mutual
agreement,'' said Kean, ''and the appeals committee found in our favour.
''Stuart felt he was due #62,000 under the terms of his contract. We
prepared thoroughly, we were confident, and we are happy with the
decision.''
Kean added that there was no ill feeling between the player or the
club, but he may have enjoyed the irony in knowing that one of the
Scottish League appeals committee members, Kilmarnock chairman Bob
Fleeting, found in Celtic's favour.
Celtic and Kilmarnock, of course, are still in dispute over
compensation for the loss of Tommy Burns and Billy Stark, who left Rugby
Park to take over the management of Celtic last close season.
The other committee members were chairman Yule Craig, Doug Smith
(Dundee United), Donny McIntyre (Ayr United), Campbell Ogilvie
(Rangers), Ian Donald (Aberdeen), and Douglas Cromb (Hibernian).

DROPPED by the international selectors after 51 caps earlier this
week, Scott Hastings makes a quick re-appearance in a Scotland shirt.
The Watsonian has been chosen at centre in the A team to meet France A
at Hughenden a week today.
Team manager Arthur Hastie told me: ''Scott was keen to play. He
obviously feels he has a point to prove and the best place he can do
that is on the field.''
The Scots' A team has already accounted for the South African tourists
and Italy this season and is bidding for its fifth successive victory.
Because of the Canadian international the next day the side is deprived
this time of the services of regular captain Kevin McKenzie. He sits on
the Scotland replacements' bench.
Instead, they will be led by Edinburgh Academical lock Jeremy
Richardson, who won his only full cap against South Africa. Another
internationalist, Shade Munro, of GHK, is his second-row partner.
The most interesting newcomer is 24-year-old Belfast-born fly-half
Stuart Laing -- he qualifies through his Scottish father. Laing was the
Exiles' top scorer with 64 points as they took the district championship
title and he replaces Duncan Hodge of Watsonians.
Rowen Shepherd is given another chance to prove he can be the stand-by
to Gavin Hastings at full back, while wingers Hugh Gilmour and Mark
Appleson are marked down for future promotion.
''I am happy with the side,'' said manager Hastie. ''We have a good,
strong pack and young backs of considerable promise.
''It will be a very hard match, the French are fielding an experienced
front row. I would like to think we can maintain the winning habit.''
Tickets for the game can be obtained from the Hillhead/Jordanhill club
or payment for entry can be made at turnstiles on the day.
Scotland A -- R J S Shepherd (Edinburgh Academicals); H R Gilmour
(Heriot's FP), S Hastings (Watsonians), B R S Eriksson (London
Scottish), M E Appleson (Sale); S R Laing (Instonians), G G Burns
(Stewart's Melville); D I W Hilton (Bath), M W Scott (Orrell), D J
Herrington (Dundee High School FP), J F Richardson (Edinburgh
Academicals) captain, D S Munro (GHK), F D Wallace (GHK), S J Reid
(Boroughmuir), I R Smith (Gloucester). Replacements -- M Dods (Gala), D
W Hodge (Watsonians), K Troup (London Scottish), A E D Macdonald
(Heriot's FP), J J Manson (Dundee HS FP), J A Hay (Hawick).

GARY Bollan will try one more time to win justice from Scottish
football's authorities, but if the SFA deny him he will turn to the law
of the land, just as his Dundee United team-mate, Billy McKinlay, has
done in an attempt to break free of a contract at Tannadice.
Both players, and it is thought perhaps as many as four others, are on
the kind of long-term contracts with United which FIFA outlawed last
year, but at least these two players have decided to do something about
their predicaments. Bollan is pursuing his case through football
channels, while McKinlay has opted for the direct route and is going
straight into court.
His case will appear on the Court of Session lists within the next few
days and there will be many in the football community dismayed to see
this happen, but they have only themselves to blame.
McKinlay has a year-and-a-half to go of his contract, which like
Bollan's was four years with a four-year option. The wording of the
options are being questioned.
Bollan is being represented in the first instance by the Scottish
Professional Footballers' Association, who believe they would have a
strong case if they resort to the civil court, but McKinlay will be
first to test the legality of these contracts.
It will be a court case which could have serious repercussions for the
entire system of transfers, which would come under close and potentially
damaging scrutiny and bring out into the open aspects of the trade which
football would rather keep in-house.
McKinlay, obviously, is in more of a hurry to prove what he believes
to be the injustice of United's behaviour, but Bolan, who is four years
younger, is content to allow SPFA secretary Tony Higgins guide him
through more diplomatic, but convoluted, channels.
Yesterday the Scottish under-21 internationalist took his case to the
Scottish League Appeals Committee and heard the gentleman on that body
rule that the terms of his contract dealing with his four-year option
period were in order and that the Tannadice club could exercise them.
Bollan, through Higgins, immediately said an appeal would be made to
the SFA within the statutory seven days. It is a case both Bollan and
the players' union are determined to win, and it could lead football
into court again if the SFA reject the appeal.
''Although we will go to the SFA now, we have had extensive legal
consultation and are confident that in the civil court we would have a
strong case,'' said Higgins, who has been campaigning for just more than
four years to end the system of signing players 21 years old and under
on long-term contracts.
The SFA and Scottish League said there was little they could do about
the practice, but as soon as FIFA moved last year to ban long-term
contracts for footballers 19 years old and under they followed suit.
Clearly, they felt the practice was wrong, yet yesterday Peter Donald,
secretary of the Scottish League, said: ''The appeals committee were
satisfied the wording of the option clause gives the club the right to
exercise the option terms of the contract for a further four years.
''The SPFA and the player suggested the wording could cause
uncertainty and be regarded as meaningless.''
Donald added that the Appeals Committee's decision will be relayed to
the League Management Committee, who will probably discuss terms of
service for players, but they may already be too late. McKinlay and
Bollan both seem committed to the actions they have taken.
Higgins and the SPFA have been waiting for years to test the validity
of some of United's long-term contracts and they would have been much
happier if FIFA would act on the advice of the players' unions of
Europe, who recommended that long-term contracts for players 21 years
old and under be outlawed.
''We believe it is right to go through the proper channels, but if we
can't have satisfaction at the SFA then we have to look for other
methods,'' said Higgins. ''You always hope that decisions arrived at
will make things better in football, but embarking on legal action might
mean other aspects of the system will be brought in.''
Jim McLean, former manager and now chairman of United, was at the
appeals hearing yesterday, but he hurried away at the end, reluctant to
discuss the decision.
''We are happy and hopefully we can get back to talking about
football,'' was all he would offer for public consumption, yet he is the
man who placed fledgling players on contracts designed to keep them at
Tannadice until they were grown men.
There have been various stories filtering out of Tannadice over the
years concerning United's contracts, but until now no one player was
bold enough to bring the matter into the open. Bollan and McKinlay have
taken the first steps.
The chairman's views on a system which has angered the SPFA and others
would be appreciated.

IT is a team which Alex McLeish and Alex Miller, whose sides meet at
Fir Park this evening, would kill to manage, but the leaders of
Motherwell and Hibernian respectively will have to content themselves
with knowing that several of their players were rated highly enough by
their peers to be included in Scottish football's dream team, writes
James Traynor.
The Scottish Professional Footballers' Association asked all clubs to
select players for each position and the outcome is a line-up which
would fill to capacity any ground in the country.
The team of '94, in 4-4-2 formation, has in goal Andy Goram, who is
still hobbling around on crutches because of the calf muscle injury
which will keep him out of action for at least three weeks, with a
defensive line of Stephen Frail (Hearts), Alan McLaren (Rangers), and
Brian Martin and Rob McKinnon (both Motherwell).
The midfield four are Brian Laudrup (Rangers), who polled more votes
than any other player, Billy McKinlay (Dundee United), John Collins
(Celtic), and Michael O'Neill (Hibernian).
Up front, Tommy Coyne (Motherwell), and Mark Hateley (Rangers) came
out on top, but it was significant that Motherwell had three players in
the players' ideal team and the trio will be on duty tonight trying once
again to close the gap on premier leaders Rangers at Fir Park.
Hibs also see this game as perhaps their last opportunity to rein in
the Ibrox side who are on 44 points after 21 matches while Miller's
players are 12 points behind with a game in hand.
Motherwell are on the same 32-point mark after 20 games, but have an
inferior goal difference to Hibs although one of their defensive
stalwarts, Brian Martin, is ready to return tonight after injury.
Motherwell will also have Jamie Dolan back after suspension and
McLeish admitted he has missed the midfield player's tenacity adding:
''He has surprised me since I came to Fir Park. He's an underrated
player who can tackle and also go forward.''
McLeish had a difficult task lifting his players after the
disappointment of last Sunday when they lost 2-1 to Hearts in a
televised game after referee Louis Thow had awarded a controversial
indirect free kick inside Motherwell's box.
If Motherwell are to move clear in second place they will have to
subdue Keith Wright who is anxious to prove Hibs can score regularly
away from home. Miller's side have done that only four times so far this
season despite having a superior goal difference over Motherwell, but
Wright, who missed the first half of the season because of a succession
of injuries, has struck form.
He has scored three goals in as many games since returning to active
duty on Boxing Day and he said: ''Perhaps there is a hidden caution that
needs to be dealt with to find ourselves more goals in away matches.''
O'Neill, who is one of the most underrated players in the
premier-division and who deserves yesterday's recognition by his fellow
professionals also will have to be watched during the 90 minutes.

MICHAEL Chang interrupted Boris Becker's serene build-up to next
week's Australian Open with a tenacious 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 victory in the
semi-finals of the Colonial Classic exhibition at Kooyong yesterday.
Chang fought back from a set and 4-2 down to take Becker into a final
set before finding another avenue of escape when the German world No.3
served for the match at 6-5.
The American took advantage of two double faults to force a decisive
tie-break which he took 7-3 to complete two hours 41 minutes of
highly-competitive tennis.
''It didn't feel like an exhibition to me . . . it felt like the final
of a grand slam,'' admitted Becker. ''I should have won the match
twice.''
Chang agreed. ''It felt like a grand slam to me too,'' he said. ''I
think that's the case whenever the top players go against each other.''
Chang's final opponent tomorrow will be the winner of today's other
semi-final between Pete Sampras and Stefan Edberg.
* SCOTLAND'S Ross Matheson, from Glasgow, and London-based Scot Miles
MacLagan were yesterday beaten in the first round of the Australian Open
men's qualifying competition in Melbourne.
Matheson went down 6-2, 6-4 by Lars Burgsmuller, of Germany, and
MacLagan lost 6-7, 6-3, 6-3 to Thierry Guardiola, of France.
Britain's top player, Clare Wood of Brighton, is seeded No.10 in the
women's qualifying competition.
Only two British players, Jeremy Bates and Mark Petchey, are direct
acceptances for the men's singles.
* FOURTH seed Anne Simpkin ended Jennifer Duncan's challenge in the
Reebok British tour event at Telford when she beat the 18-year-old Scot
in yesterday's second round of the women's Tableau Finale.
The former British No.10 looked to have the match sewn up when she
established a 6-3, 5-0 lead, but Duncan fought back to win the next five
games before going down 6-3, 7-5.

DEREK Forsyth, the Kelburne men's hockey coach, has had his ban for
the violation of a previous suspension lifted by the appeals committee
of the Scottish Hockey Union, but the Paisley club has been fined a
record #250.
Forsyth was suspended on the first weekend of the indoor season last
month for having been involved in a verbal confrontation with an umpire
during a Scottish Cup outdoor tie.
During that weekend he was sidelined, Forsyth was reported for
coaching his team, although he remained outside the playing area. In his
absence and without prior warning, he was suspended by the SHU
disciplinary committee until the end of the indoor season.
Douglas Robertson, the Kelburne president, yesterday admitted they
were responsible for Forsyth falling foul of the authorities a second
time. ''We did not communicate to the manager or the coach involved it
was a silent suspension,'' he said.
Robertson continued: ''The SHU have admitted their procedures were
wrong, and as such Derek's suspension has been lifted. We have had our
appeals fee returned and have been fined #250 for our administration
mess.''
This, however, is unlikely to be the end of the saga. Robertson
predicted: ''We will discuss the matter in committee next week, but I
think we will be going back to the SHU and say to them we will get our
house in order but what are you going to do about yours and those who
are ignoring procedures?''

THE second phase of the women's indoor hockey league begins tomorrow
at the Bell's Sports Centre, Perth, with the four leading contenders,
Edinburgh Ladies, holders, Hyndland, Western Klick Photopoint, and
Bonagrass Grove all confident that this could be their year, writes
Joseph Dillon.
Only league newcomers Menzieshill are not harbouring thoughts of
grandeur. ''Consolidation'' is the main target of their captain, Alison
Christie.
Bonagrass Grove are buoyant having won the Montrouge Tournament last
month. This was the club's first venture into Europe and now Audrey
Sime, their captain, feels they can start their campaign with two
victories ''if we play to the same level of efficiency as we did in
Paris.''
That team will be strengthened by the return of Frances Miller and
Susan Fraser, but Edinburgh Ladies, who also will have benefited from
their continental venture last week, will be without Pauline Robertson
when the teams clash in the first series of games. Robertson is down
south on business and they will be hoping Elaine Cooper can dovetail
into her position.
Another match of great interest will be the one between Hyndland,
revelation of the first phase, and Western.
The latter have, according to their captain, Margery Coutts, ''been
working hard at our game over the festive season'' so they will be out
to put their city rivals in their place after they overturned a 2-4
deficit to snatch a point in the closing stages of their previous
meeting.

THOSE who consider the lot of Scottish referees a hard one might spare
a thought for their Cypriot brothers, who have gone on strike over
hooligan attacks. Four ended up in hospital last weekend, one with a
broken arm.
To add insult to injury, the Cyprus FA have taken
beat-the-strike-at-all-costs measures by shipping in blackleg whistlers
from Romania. ''Not even one match over the weekend will be cancelled,''
said association official George Papastavrou.
The 200 Island referees, not surprisingly, have called foul. ''They
can't do that . . . referees throughout the world are all one family . .
. No referee could ever agree to breaking a strike,'' said spokesman
Christos Skapoullis.
Well, it seems they can, and the scene is set for portside picket
lines.
It could never happen here, could it?

PIERRE van Hooydonk, the #1.2m Celtic striker who scored on his debut
against Hearts this week, was celebrating again yesterday after having
been named in the Dutch squad for the friendly against France in Utrecht
on Wednesday.
The 6ft 5in, 25-year-old, bought by Celtic from Dutch club NAC Breda,
for whom he scored 114 goals in 182 games, replaces injured Inter Milan
star Dennis Bergkamp. Van Hooydonk won his first cap against Luxembourg
last month.
Van Hooydonk's fine debut came as no surprise to the last towering
Dutchman to play in Scotland, former Aberdeen striker Willem van der
Ark. He believes van Hooydonk can be a huge success in Scotland if
Celtic manager Tommy Burns can provide support.
''Pierre can be as good as Andy Cole or any other striker in Britain,
but he cannot achieve this by himself. Celtic must bring in new players
to support him,'' he said. ''He will not prove to be the saviour they
are looking for if he is asked to play alone in attack.
''He is equally effective in the air and on the ground. He can also
link the attack and midfield. He will be a bargain if Celtic get the
right players in. His biggest problem will be adjusting to the frantic
pace of the premier division.
''But I didn't find that too difficult, and scoring in my debut at
Motherwell lifted my confidence.''
Manchester United striker Eric Cantona is included in France's 17-man
squad for the Holland match.
* ABERDEEN manager Willie Miller has recalled injury-recovered
Scotland striker Eoin Jess for tomorrow's match with Partick Thistle at
Pittodrie.
Jess has not scored a goal for Aberdeen this season and has been used
in a substitute's role for the past six weeks, but a double in a reserve
cup tie has convinced Miller that the youngster is worthy of a starting
place.''
Former European champions Marseille were banned yesterday from playing
their next home match at the Stade Velodrome after a riot by their fans
last week. The second division fixture is against Niort and scheduled
for February 8. Rioting fans forced play to be stopped 76 minutes into
the match against Nancy on January 6.
* HAMILTON were having signing talks last night with midfielder Ian
MacCall of Falkirk. The Brockville club are willing to allow McCall to
leave and Hamilton manager Iain Munro has been a long-time admirer of
him.
Meanwhile, Hamilton could have a bigger than normal crowd tomorrow for
their first-division match against Stranraer. Fans will be given a
voucher which will enable them to buy a ticket for the Tennents Scottish
cup-tie against Rangers at the end of the month.
* HIBERNIAN'S reserve fixture with Motherwell at Easter Road tomorrow
has been frozen out. The game has been called off due to problems with
the central heating system which has left them without hot water or
heating, though the undersoil heating is working.
Ironically, Hibs are sponsored this season by Calor Gas.
* BLACKBURN striker Kevin Gallacher's long-awaited comeback has been
put on hold.
He was set to start a reserve clash for Rovers last night -- his first
run-out since breaking a leg against Arsenal last February -- but a
thigh strain halted the Scotland player's plans and left him frustrated
on the sidelines.
* FIRST division St Johnstone have made a move to keep unsettled star
Paul Wright at Perth by offering him a deal ''which we believe will make
him one of the highest-paid in the division.'' The former Scottish
Under-21 striker had posted a transfer request last week.
Saints will be without defender Jim Weir for a month. He broke his
nose in the midweek derby with Dundee.
* ALLAN Evans was finally confirmed as Aston Villa's assistant manager
yesterday -- six weeks after walking out on Leicester. He goes back to
one of his former clubs to link up again with manager Brian Little --
the man he followed out of Leicester in mid-November.
* BRAZILIAN star Romario has signed for Flamengo of Rio de Janeiro for
$4.5m after talks with officials at Romario's former club, Barcelona.
* FORMER Everton and Manchester City manager Howard Kendall has been
appointed manager of first-division Notts County. He takes over from
Russell Slade, who will become his assistant.
* JUDGES investigating the alleged sale of cocaine to Napoli players
between 1987 and 1990 have issued an arrest warrant for Guillermo
Coppola, the former manager of Argentinian star Diego Maradona.
* CHELSEA'S former Scotland striker Robert Fleck has joined first
division strugglers Bristol City on a month's loan. The 29-year-old,
bought from Norwich for #2.3m in August, 1992, has not figured in
Stamford Bridge boss Glenn Hoddle's plans this season.
* ENGLISH Coca-Cola Cup semi-final draw:
Liverpool v Crystal Palace, Swindon v Bolton.
First leg to be played week commencing February 12, second leg week
commencing February 19.

THE goals machine that scored 93 times in the league and almost took
Dunfermline to promotion last season has all but dried up. Unless
manager Bert Paton can find a solution soon, further heartbreak for the
East End Park side is round the corner again.
Although they began this term where they left off and led the division
until the end of November, a disastrous run has left them level on
points with Airdrie -- also having a tough time -- but seven behind
leaders Dundee.
This record does not make pleasant reading for East End Park fans who
formed the majority of the first division's biggest league crowd of the
season -- 8500 -- who watched them lose 1-0 to Fife rivals Raith Rovers
on Wednesday night. In nine league games, they have had only three wins
with two draws and four defeats -- 11 points out of 27.
Although Paton avoided a direct answer after the latest defeat, the
question of changes, particularly up front, could be made for the trip
to Love Street tomorrow.
He said: ''It would be nice to visit the transfer market, but as you
know there's not a lot of money here. In the past when I've improved the
team, it has been after a player has been sold, and the cash made
available.
''We are concerned with the lack of goals up front. There's Stewart
Petrie for example, who has gone eight games without scoring. Hamish
French has scored only three in 10 games, and they were all in the one
match and included a penalty.''
Paton, although ''disappointed'' about the Fifers' slump, still looked
on the bright side.
''No-one is going to run away with this league, we are still in second
place, and there are 16 games to go.''
Across the road at Kirkcaldy, Raith Rovers have achieved what seemed
to be an impossible target set by manager Jimmy Nicholl as they
approached the holiday period. ''Give me four wins out of four, and we
will be right back in the promotion race,'' he told the players after
the 2-1 defeat at Dundee on December 10.
The players did just that, and 12 points were gleaned from victories
over Airdrie, St Jonstone, Hamilton Accies, and Dunfermline.

CHRIS Robison, whose last major race was the Commonwealth 10,000
metres in Victoria, returns to serious competitive action tomorrow at
Luton with the West of Scotland team which competes in the
Inter-counties cross-country championships.
Robison, the reigning national cross-country champion, from Spango
Valley, is one of 80 Scots travelling today to the meeting, at a cost of
#3500 to the Scottish Athletic Federation, making it the largest
representative contingent of Scots this winter.
The Royal Navy officer has raced only three times since Canada, the
best being a modest third in the West championships. But in nine
inter-county appearances since 1982 has never been worse than eleventh
-- 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 10 and 11.
''I'm looking for a top-10 place, to indicate whether I can add to my
six appearances in the World Championships,'' he says.
The West squad is depleted by the absence of district champion Allan
Puckrin, and Robert Quinn and Adrian Callan who ran for Scotland last
week in Belfast.
However they have Graeme Wight, recovered from the throat virus which
upset him in Ireland, plus Doug Runciman, Alaister Russell, Jim Austin,
and Neil Wilkinson, who should be too strong for an East team headed by
Dave Ross and Ken Chapman. The East's best hope is their UK marathon
internationalist, Allison Rose.
* IF you have been thwarted in gaining entry to the Nutrasweet London
Marathon, there is still hope. The Scottish Athletic Federation has been
given nine places, courtesy of TSB, for the event. These can be applied
for by contacting track and field commission convener, George Duncan.
Five places are available by ballot and four to competitors with the
fastest personal bests. As championship places are open to any men who
have run faster than 2hr 45min, and women faster than 3-15, these four
entries will go to runners with the fastest times outside that limit, ie
2-45-00 and 3-15-00 or slower.
Application must be made on a postcard to G Duncan, 22 Wilson St,
Perth, PH2 0EX by next Friday at the latest.

EDINBURGH is full of eastern promise for the hard-pressed racing
fraternity today with a confident prediction that, after three
abandonments, Scotland's first meeting of 1995 will eventually take
place.
While Wetherby was frozen off yesterday, Edinburgh was raceable, and
the forecast is for rain and milder weather. There are 88 runners for
seven races.
The track resembles a building-site at present during the construction
of a #500,000 corporate hospitality block. General manager Mark Kershaw
promises it will be completed by March and that other improvements to
the facilities will be carried out by late spring.
Horses suited to the fast track and tight bends often make a habit of
winning at the course. Timanfaya, an eight-year-old chaser, owned by Mrs
''Pete'' Culham of Dumfries and trained at Hexham by George Reed, won at
66-1 last season and was successful again in December, this time at
20-1. He is one of seven previous course winners in the Whiteadder
Handicap Chase, the feature race.
Trump, Colin Parker's useful staying hurdler, is another who loves the
sea air here. Ridden by the trainer's son, David, he won here twice last
month and attempts to complete the hat trick in the Harcross ''Helping
You Build'' Handicap Hurdle, in which Peter Monteith's Astrac Trio could
provide the main threat.
Cardenden, trained in Fife by Jim Barclay, an easy winner of a maiden
chase at the last meeting, carries top weight in the Hopeswater Novices'
Chase, where locally-owned Family Line will attempt to give Linda
Perratt her first winner of the season.

IT was inevitable, I suppose. The whingeing had to gather momentum.
The Ryder Cup of recent years has been far too successful a team
tournament, much too popular among the spectators and given increasingly
too much prominence by the media for the chaps who take part to carry on
regardless.
Paul Broadhurst, who played in the Ryder Cup four years ago, is the
latest to lead a movement against the only team contest in pro golf
which captures the attention of fans from two continents. The complaint
voiced by him and others is that there is too much hype, that excessive
attention is paid to the gathering of points in every qualifying
tournament.
One or two agents, it seems, have also been making the point that
their men do not get paid anything for taking part in what is now a kind
of biennial ''major,'' which makes very big sponsorship cash as well as
substantial gate-money and large TV fees.
We knew it wouldn't take long before that aspect of the revitalised
Ryder Cup was seized upon. But I can't remember much being said in the
good old days when the same tournament, in America at least, attracted
as much attention as a downhill demonstration by Eddie the Eagle.
Even in Britain, before the sensible move to extend the home side into
a European team was made, there was only limited interest in a match
which was so one-sided as to be close to farce.
No-one seemed to mind playing for the flag then, even if they didn't
manage to hoist it very often. Now, when we have a really fascinating
and serious contest between the best golfers of the two continents,
there is unrest in the trenches.
Maybe it is not too surprising. Golfers, by the very nature of their
business, are individuals used to playing for self and counting the
sheckels afterwards.
It is never easy for single-minded people to transcend self-interest
and think of the collective good, although the teams on both sides have
been so caught up in the excitement generated by the fans that these
contests have become like cup finals.
Occasionally, they have induced excessive patriotism which has
manifested itself in bad sportsmanship, something which is contrary to
the very essence of golf, but on the whole the new version of the Ryder
Cup has injected a different dimension to a sport which had become too
set in its ways.
Of course, it is a bit of a distraction from the actual event when
Ryder Cup points are discussed, sometimes at the expense of who is
winning the tournament, but golfers should remember that this new
interest will bring in new fans to see the stars on show, create bigger
audiences for the bread-and-butter season and encourage manufacturers to
pay even bigger money for endorsements of their products.
The money generated by the Ryder Cup goes into the European PGA, where
it is distributed to the greater good of all pro golfers, stars and
supporting cast.
The men in the running for places in the team will have learned by now
that the relatively cosy existence, whereby they played around Europe
earning a fine living without over zealous attention from the rest of
the world, is over.
You are playing for your places in the first team, chaps. But nobody
is twisting your arm to accept.
* IN Holland, where the progress of Pierre van Hooydonk with Celtic
will be watched with a great deal if interest, the news of Manchester
United's #7m deal for Andy Cole is treated with utter disblief.
The Dutch do not have much truck with excessive transfer fees, except
when they involve their own players going out of the country, and I am
told that Feyenoord were furious that Celtic paid so much (#1.2m) for
van Hooydonk, beating them to the the draw.
Ajax, whose breeding of their own stars is second to none anywhere,
PSV Eindhoven, and Feyenoord will go into the transfer market when they
want, but they would never compete in the Italian, Spanish or English
markets.
It is a tactic which Scottish clubs, with perhaps one exception,
should recognise as sensible. They do all right, too.

THE Lewis Group, the Glasgow-based debt collection company with
offices in West Yorkshire, Belfast and St Albans, has been acquired by a
four-strong management team, backed by Barclays Development Capital and
the Royal Bank.
Founder Larry Lewis is selling his family's majority shareholding for
an undisclosed sum and retiring. The management team, which already held
the balance of the group's shares, will now have a majority stake.
Barclays takes a minority stake.
The Lewis Group, which specialises in consumer and commercial debt
collection, sales ledger management, investigations and parking
enforcement, has a turnover in excess of #7m and employs more than 200
people.
The buy-out team is led by Harry McKeever, group MD for the past three
years, and Roger Lucas, who become joint MDs. The other directors
involved are Michael Brown and Ken McGeoch.
Larry Lewis founded the business in 1974, sold it to Harvey &amp; Thompson
in 1985 and then bought back control in 1991. Clients range from major
clearing banks to local authorities.

<HEADLINE>Banks say that intervention on charges would be a restriction on competition. Reduction of bad debt is good for TSB</HEADLINE>

AT first glance, the two thirds increase in pre-tax profits at the TSB
to a record #504m coming just six weeks after the Royal Bank of Scotland
revealed a 106% leap in its result to #532m would seem to play into the
hands of those looking to restrict bank profitability through
controlling charges an other measures.
However, the TSB figures are not nearly as good as they seem, with the
underlying performance pretty flat and the profits growth due very
largely to the reduction in bad debt provisions from #335m to #173m.
Chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison accused the Labour Party of a
''regrettable mis-understanding'' of the banking industry and not
realising that it has a cyclical nature. Intervention on bank charges
would be a restriction on competition, he added and was echoed by the
Royal's Lord Younger.
Perhaps the solution is to wave a wand that will stop banks from
making silly lending decisions in the first place as they waste so much
capital and opportunity crawling back out of the mire. Ask any Barclays
shareholder about the #1000m rights monies blown on dud property. The
trouble is that no politician will be able to design such a wand.
And there is a crystal clear case for high levels of bank
profitability.
Had the UK economy picked up earlier than it did and had companies not
been relatively well financed during the recession, then it was quite
obvious that both Barclays and National Westminster, in 1993, could have
had problems in supplying substantial amounts of lending given that
their capital ratios were pretty near the permitted floor.
In 1973, NatWest actually had to issue a statement to the effect that
it was not going bust when its shares were trading at a 10% discount to
their par value.
So a high level of retentions is essential. TSB is increasing the
dividend total by 17.5% to 9.024p with a 5.48p final, which represents a
15% rise in real terms. However, the cover has been raised from 1.7 to
2.4 times.
The TSB is in the happy position of having the strongest balance sheet
of any of the High Street banks and so is able to lend in volume if and
when loan demand does pick up, but still inhibited by continuing job
insecurity. TSB has played its part by having a total of 1158
redundancies which reduced group staffing levels to 26,000 by the year
end. Some 93 branches were closed and another 200 may follow in 1995.
The all important retail banking operations, which draw most of the
hostile criticism, actually saw a small #13m decline in their
contribution to #247m. Part of that, however, was self inflicted by the
continuing marketing decision to persuade customers to switch out of low
interest rate deposits into those offering a better return, as well as
savings products. That is a price TSB is paying for loyalty and to keep
its 7.5 million customer base, the fifth largest of any UK financial
institution.
But these people seem chary of taking on new commitments apart from
mortgages, with personal and credit card borrowing increasing a mere 4%
in the year to end October in an economy coming out of recession faster
than expected, leaving the 20% expansion in the mortgage book to #7151m
to add some substance to the overall loan book.
Commercial lending, admittedly not a TSB speciality, underlined by the
poor rating it gets from the small business sector, was almost flat at
#1619m. The mortgage expansion owes a lot to good marketing.
The baggage from yesteryear in the form of Mortgage Express is now
turning out to have some value, with a #37m upturn in profits to #38m
and which should continue to run at a reasonable level until the #430m
book value of distressed properties is worked out, with arrears
customers now paying having risen from 71% to 78%.
The Loan Administration Unit, which was the dustbin for all the bad
Hill Samuel loans, saw the largest reduction in bad debts of #103m,
which has resulted in a #146m swing round into #4m profit.
Insurance profits were virtually held at #191m after a #60m decline in
investment income because of falling bond an equity markets. While new
business was choppy in some areas such as single pensions but good on
single life, the industry is entering 1995 with trepidation, with the
new rules on disclosure now operative.
Thankfully, the Hill Samuel merchant bank continues on an even keel at
#64m (#58m) and by concentrating on medium size corporate business,
could find more sustainable profitability than competitors in the
hostile takeover business.
The UDT consumer finance subsidiary benefited from a 20% surge in new
business, very largely car finance, with profits up 59% to #54m.
Current year profits may have to struggle to reach #565m, thanks to
increasing competition which TSB could help resolve by using its
acquisition potential, although it now seems to have specifically ruled
out taking over a building society.
At 220[1/2]p, down 5[1/2]p, there seems little to go for with the 5.1%
yield the main attraction.

Worcester, and local hope Warren Stowe.
But first Quinn must take care of Geordie Jay, against whom he has a

DESPITE basking in the afterglow of record profits, the Royal Bank of
Scotland was in a somewhat defensive mood yesterday at the company's
annual general meeting.
Lord Younger, the chairman, used his trading statement to tackle
criticism of the role of banks in general and to deny that executives
were paid anything more than the ''going rate'' for jobs of their
responsibility.
Emphasising the importance of a strong banking sector, Lord Younger
said critics should remember that the sector was highly cyclical and
that profits can vary widely.
''Over the past five years the average return to shareholders of banks
in the UK as been about 12% pre-tax,'' he told several hundred
shareholders in Edinburgh.
''I consider this in no way excessive and is wholly consistent with
the role of banks in the community in both good times and bad,'' he
added.
Last year pre-tax profit more than doubled to #532m, the highest in
the company's history, and the total dividend of 13.75p represented a
25% increase over 1993 and a similar increase in the previous year.
Chief executive George Mathewson's combined salary, profit sharing,
and performance related bonus -- some of the latter deferred for three
years -- totalled #401,000, a rise of just over 17% and well within the
guidelines of the bank's emoluments committee.
''It should also be remembered that executives were not awarded any
rises in the relatively poor year of 1992,'' Lord Younger added.
Peter Wood, head of the intensely profitable Direct Line insurance
subsidiary, escaped the traditional questions about his vast bonuses
because he was effectively ''bought out'' last year by the bank in a
#21m payment.
But his entitlement to a company car worth at least #95,000 has
prompted media comment, something he easily brushed off when speaking
informally after the agm.
''I may be entitled to a model of that status, but I can assure you I
do not drive a company car,'' Mr Wood said. No stranger to media
attention, he added drily: ''I'm scared to enter the Lottery in case I
win.''
The meeting itself passed off quietly, as might be expected after what
were impressive annual results by any standards.
The relatively poor share performance of recent weeks was brought up
though Lord Younger, naturally enough, said he had no control over the
whims of the Stock Exchange. ''But I'm confident the price will go up
again when the market has more time to reflect on our position and
prospects.''
He expected 1995 to be another good year for the bank, helped by
continuing growth and subdued inflation. His one major concern apppeared
to be investment spending in the UK which he described as ''sluggish''.
The brand names of the Royal itself, Direct Line, and Citizens, the
rapidly expanding US subsidiary, will be emphasised even more in the
future.
No Royal Bank agm would be complete without an intervention by the
redoubtable Miss Mackenzie of Peebles. This year her concerns ran from
the absence of real flowers in the main office to the embarrassing
inability of the Royal Bank's bureau de change in Edinburgh to give
Scottish bank notes for foreign currency.
And just as traditionally, the chairman welcomed her questions and
promised to look into them all.
* DIRECT Line hopes to add another 60 jobs to its telephone-based
operation in Glasgow -- an increase of 50% in staff. Most of the extra
demand stems from the start of its mortgage offers, a recent addition to
its motor and household business.

LAST year's winner Pierre Lartigue took total command of the Dakar

the title after a breakdown by fellow Frenchman, Bruno Saby, left the
Citroen driver in an almost impregnable position.
Mitsubishi driver Saby, the 1993 winner, lost more than three hours

and 40 minutes adrift with just three days to go.
The nearest rival to Lartigue is another Frenchman, Jean-Pierre
Fontenay, whose Mitsubishi was three hours 25 minutes off the lead after
the eleventh stage.
Spanish Cagiva rider Jordi Arcarons maintained his lead in the

JAMIE Weston, the Scottish Schools' scrum half and captain last
season, will have his first national league game for Watsonians
tomorrow. The Myreside club have promoted the Kelvinside FP for the
contest with Stewart's Melville at Inverleith.
His championship debut, however, is four months later than planned.
Watsonians had seen him as potentially their first-choice scrum half as
soon as he arrived at Myreside for this season.
Weston had a game in September against Aspen, from Colorado, but
hand-bone fractures in that match kept him out of rugby until recently.
His game for Watsonians' 2A XV last week was strong enough to convince
the selectors that he should be promoted for the resumption of
championship business, though he will be up against the in-form Graeme
Burns, Edinburgh's scrum half who will make his Scotland A debut against
the French at Hughenden a week today.
Scott Hastings and Murray Rudkin also return for Watsonians after
injury.
Back on the scrum-half theme, the two who have played for Glasgow this
season are enjoying and suffering mixed fortunes. Fraser Stott returns
for West of Scotland against Jed-Forest at Burnbrae, his first game
since his hand fracture in Glasgow's game against North and Midlands on
December 3, whereas his district championship understudy, Cammy Little
cannot gain a place with GHK. Angus Kerr is scrum half against Edinburgh
Academicals at Old Anniesland.
Stirling County, four points clear at the top, can recall Kenny Logan,
among others, for the visit to Hawick. Logan missed County's last-gasp
win over Watsonians last week because of an ankle injury.
0
Malcolm Norval, Stirling's Glasgow lock, is doubtful because of a
hamstring injury. So they have retained the two No.8 contenders, Gareth
Flockhart and Jim Brough.
Derek Turnbull, Hawick's international wing forward, also makes a
comeback at Mansfield Park. He was dismissed late in Hawick's November
match against Edinburgh Academicals during the previous round of league
matches, and his six-week ban fitted neatly into the championship's
midwinter break.
Peter Wright, who has been recalled by Scotland at tight head, is
doubtful for Boroughmuir's match against Melrose, the defending
champions. So are Mike Hall and Graham Hepburn.
Wright had a cut eyebrow while he was playing for Scotland A last
week, and he may need to sit out the Meggetland game.
Dundee High School FP, visiting Gala, have restored John Manson, the
North and Midlands prop who had a two-minute appearance for Scotland A
in the victory over Italy last Saturday. The Netherdale match will be
his first league game of the season.
His return allows Tom Smith to switch to hooker in the continuing
absence of the suspended Bob Cairney.
GALA will play an under-21 match against Kelso at Netherdale on
Wednesday (kick-off 7.15). The teams will include only players who are
not first XV regulars.
DUNFERMLINE have been named McEwan's 70/- club of the month for
December after nine victories in successive games. Their run has
included third-division wins against Royal High and Stewartry as well as
friendly successes against two second-division clubs, Haddington and
Edinburgh Wanderers.

THE SAATCHI affair embroiled the lawyers yesterday as the group
slapped a writ on its defecting executives in an attempt to stop Maurice
Saatchi setting up a rival agency.
The writ was served on Maurice himself, and on the three top
executives, Jeremy Sinclair, David Kershaw and Bill Muirhead who quit to
join his new venture.
A Saatchi &amp; Saatchi spokesman commented: ''The writ claims damages
against all three of them for conspiracy to injure the business of the
group and against Maurice Saatchi for soliciting the other three.''
It also seeks to prevent the three ''from joining a competing
business, soliciting or working for clients of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in a
competing business and damages for breach of contract.''
The prospect of possibly lengthy litigation will further unsettle
nervous clients of the group. However, some much-needed support came
yesterday when Camelot, organiserof the National Lottery, said it was
not reviewing its advertising.
Shares of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi continued their precipitous decline,
falling in panicky trading to 93[1/2]p, as Mirror Group confirmed that
it was ending its contract, before steadying to close at 98p, down
9[1/2]p on balance. They are now 45% below the 178p they reached after
the well-received first half results in August.
But some analysts were saying that the shares had perhaps fallen too
far, given that the defections of British Airways, Mirror Group, Dixons
and possibly Mars, would only reduce overall billings, which totalled
#4279m in 1993, by a few percentage points.
One analyst said he would cut his forecast of 1995 earnings by 16% if
it was confirmed that the four companies had cancelled their contracts.
The group is expected to earn about #33m for 1994.
With the client losses so far, the shares could be selling on about 11
times likely 1995 earnings. But the worry is that the affair will prompt
other clients to pull out unless acting chairman Charlie Scott can calm
things down.

ENGLAND'S worst fears about the World Series Cup were realised
yesterday in Sydney when, by a margin of just two runs, Australia A
pipped them for a place in the final. Now, to the tourists' great
embarrassment and the intense pleasure of the cynics who predicted such
an outcome, the final will be contested by Australia and the Aussie
second string.
The best-of-three final was reduced to an official non-event when,
with three required, No.11 batsman Angus Fraser managed only a single
off the last ball of the final qualifying match. The International
Cricket Council ruled several months ago that matches involving a
country's second team are not official fixtures, so nothing will be
entered in the record books.
England were never in favour of this experimental format, and their
suspicions were fully confirmed when a man who played four matches for
one team, and two for another, helped to beat them.
Michael Bevan was a member of Australia's side before Christmas but
starred yesterday for the A team with a magnificent century off Mike
Atherton's bowlers.
''It's a bit of a farcical situation when you get players playing for
two teams in the same competition,'' said Atherton.
Australia's selectors must now decide which team Bevan represents in
Sunday's first contest. Wicketkeeper Phil Emery also has played for both
Australias, while spinner Gavin Robertson went from the top team on
Saturday to the reserves' twelfth man yesterday.
It was the continuing injury crisis that cost England a place final.
They were robbed of strike bowler Darren Gough, who watched events on TV
from his Yorkshire home because of a fractured left foot, and the
batting and fielding skills of Neil Fairbrother. Both were injured
during Tuesday night's win over Australia.
Brilliantly though century-makers Greg Blewett and Michael Bevan
played in leading Australia A to a mighty 264 for five, they were
undoubtedly helped by the absence of Fairbrother from those vital
single-saving areas around the bat.
In an electrifying third-wicket stand of 161 off 169 deliveries,
Blewett (113) and Bevan (105) displayed running between the wickets that
was sensational even by Australia's ever-high standards.
The first nine England batsmen all reached double figures but not one
contributed a half-century. Even so, the secondary target of 237 --
sufficient to qualify on run-rate -- did not disappear until Fraser
could do no more than shovel Paul Reiffel's final ball to mid-off.
Australia A are 9-4 for the final, with the first team 1-3 favourites.
England will now have two or three days' rest in Sydney before
starting their preparation for the fourth Test.

* IN THE presence of their president, South Africa won the Mandela
Trophy with a match to spare yesterday as they thrashed Pakistan by 157
runs at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, their biggest one-day win when
batting first.
A record South African one-day opening stand of 190 in 38 overs by
Gary Kirsten (87) and Mike Rindel (106) set the home side up for a total
of 266 for five. Fanie de Villiers then took three wickets to reduce
Pakistan to 14 for three and they were all out for 109 in 32.3 overs.
The South Africans won the first game of the three-match final by 37
runs in Cape Town on Tuesday.
The teams meet in a one-off Test, the first between the two countries,
again at the Wanderers, starting next Thursday.

THE ITALIAN lira continued its decline on the foreign exchanges
breaking its previous low point against the German mark. The ongoing
political impasse within Italy has undermined the currency but yesterday
it also lost out to a particularly strong mark.
Concern about the Mexican peso crisis and European cross rates
depressed the dollar. There were rumours of central bank intervention
but these were later discounted. The US unit lost out to both the mark
and the yen. Dealers said that investors were fleeing Asian currencies
for the yen comparing it to a European flight to the mark.
Elsewhere, the Canadian authorities intervened to support the Canadian
dollar and raised money market rates. Sterling was out of the spotlight
but attracted investors and rose against most major currencies. It
gained almost 0.5 of a fennig against the mark to DM2.3998 and against
the dollar was almost 1.25 cents ahead at $1.5711. Its trade weighted
index rose by 0.2 to 79.5.

GEEST yesterday said it could not put a precise figure on the amount
of money it had lost from the autumn's tropical storm which badly
damaged the banana industry on the Windward Islands.
Tropical storm Debbie struck in September causing widespread damage to
the plantations on the islands which provide 50% of Geest's banana
needs.
''The resulting uncertainty made the 1994 profit outlook difficult to
forecast,'' the group said.
''As a consequence, brokers' estimates for 1994 group results have
varied markedly.''
Before unknown exceptional items are taken into account, the group
said taxable profit was likely to be in the region of #11.5m for the
year ending December 31. Total dividend payout was likely to be held at
8.1p.
The company said its produce division, which handles produce other
than bananas, had a satisfactory year.
In November, Geest bought Crest Foods International in South Africa,
which will fly out out-of-season vegetables to the UK.
The company's food preparation division made good progress.

FOOD distributor and prepared food specialist Booker is to invest #35m
in its distribution operations over the next three years. It will take
an #18m hit in its 1994 accounts, partly as a result of the new
investment and partly relating to earlier consolidations.
Booker said over the next three years it will establish a single
integrated network of large regional distribution centres to handle 95%
of the stock for its 160 cash-and-carry outlets.
The London-based operation said this compared with 25% of stock
currently handled centrally with the rest delivered by individual
suppliers to each depot ''which is more costly and less efficient''.
Booker said the balance of the total project cost, which amounts to
#60m, related mainly to property investment which will be financed by a
third party.
''One-off costs and asset write-downs will also be incurred over the
next three years as a consequence of this investment,'' Booker said.
''These costs, together with exceptional costs resulting from the
consolidation of the food service businesses of Pullman Foods and Booker
Fitch announced in July 1994, will be charged as an exceptional item of
around #18m in the 1994 accounts,'' it said.

SECURICOR, the communications, security and parcels business, has
closed the year to September 30, 1994 with a rise in profits of 28% from
#63m to #80.6m before tax, continuing the growth registered in the first
half.
There is to be a final dividend of 2.6p for the group and 4.851p for
Security Services, which is 50.75% owned by Securicor. This lifts the
totals by 15%, to 3.405p for the group and 6.537p for Services.
Chairman Peter Smith commented: ''Each of our four operating divisions
improved its trading performance with good organic growth complemented
by our continued programme of judicious acquisitions within the scope of
our existing areas of expertise.''
Securicor's 40% stake in Cellnet, the company's joint venture with BT,
saw its contribution rise to #55.9m from #46.3m. Cellnet continued to
invest heavily in marketing expenditure, thereby accelerating growth in
the number of its network users.
It doubled subscriber numbers to 1.6m. The subscriber base of
Securicor Cellular Services grew during the year from 103,000 to
189,000, an increase of 85%.
The security division raised profits from #9.1m to #12m with a strong
performance at home from the cash-in-transit operation, which benefited
from prior year rationalisation and from new contracts for the carriage
of foreign currency. In June, Securicor Custodial Services began
operating the five-year #96m Metropolitan and Court Escort and Custody
contract.
Profits from the continuing operations of the parcels division were up
from #5.7m to #9.9m with parcel volumes increasing substantially from
the previous year. In the UK, customers continued to favour overnight
services, as opposed to 2.3 day deliveries.
Securicor Pony Express had a successful year and opened the first six
of 30 planned local franchise operations. Scottish Express
International, acquired in October 1993, made a substantial sales and
profit contribution and opened two new English branches.
Looking ahead, the chairman said: ''On the evidence of our 1994
results, the general economic improvement has been maintained. We have a
healthy presence in each of our chosen business sectors and I look
forward to continued growth in the current year.''
The Securicor 'A' shares stood at 970p, down 2p on the day.

TERRY Griffiths, the oldest player in the Liverpool/Victoria Charity
Challenge, showed he is far from finished as a major force in snooker by
breezing into the last eight yesterday.
The 47-year-old Welshman upset the form book with a 5-1 first-round
victory over Ken Doherty at the #300,000 tournament in Birmingham.
Last month Griffiths beat old rival Steve Davis -- whom he now will
meet again in the next round -- in the last 16 of the European Open, but
few expected him to dismiss Doherty with such ease. The Dubliner, who
won the Regal Scottish Masters at Motherwell in September, hardly had a
look in as Griffiths took a 3-0 lead.
The 1979 world champion knocked in breaks of 84, 66, 61, and 51 and
led 58-0 in the fourth frame after a run of 57. A yellow-to-black
clearance enabled Doherty to snatch that frame but Griffiths returned
the compliment with a finish from the final red for 4-1, and his 61
break in the next booked a quarter-final place.
Davis had an undistinguished 5-1 victory over inconsistent Tony Drago
of Malta.
Earlier, 40-year-old Willie Thorne took just 71 minutes to whitewash
Darren Morgan 5-0 with runs of 69, 40, 53, 52, and 108. He now faces
another veteran, Dennis Taylor, who edged out Jimmy White 5-4.

NEARLY #83m was wiped off the value of Weir Group yesterday, after a
downbeat trading statement accompanied news of a #7m shake-up of pump
operations and 420 redundancies.
The Glasgow-based engineering company said trading conditions
generally remained dull and demand for spare parts was disappointing.
Weir reported growing pressure on margins in international pump markets.
The shares tumbled 42p to 251p, valuing the group at about #495m.
Engineering analyst at Yamaichi International in London Brian Rusling
said: ''I think the share price has gone the way it has gone because of
the comments about margins in the pump market. Without spare parts
picking up, the outlook for 1995 is not brilliant.''
Most of the redundancies, which follow Weir's #135m acquisition of
Salt Lake City-based EnviroTech Pumpsystems last October, will come at
the company's Manchester pump plant, where a centre dedicated to the
design, development, and sale of pumping equipment for the international
oil industry will be set up.
The workforce at Manchester will be reduced by 310 to 336, with the
remaining job losses resulting from a plant closure in Sacramento,
California.
There will be no redundancies at the main Weir Pumps plant at Cathcart
or at Alloa and the company hopes to limit the number of net job losses
in the 8500-strong pump division to 330 through relocation.
With more than 60% of Weir's business coming from overseas, more and
more of these customers want their products made in their own country.
Weir found it had too much capacity in the UK and the restructuring move
is aimed at redressing the imbalance.
Chief executive Sir Ronald Garrick said the current integration of
EnviroTech with other pump operations in Canada, South Africa,
Australia, and the UK, the #7m reorganisation and forthcoming
initiatives would improve efficiency and ''increase the group's
competitive ability in pump markets worldwide, where the pressure on
margins continues to intensify''.
He added: ''Trading conditions generally continue to follow the dull
pattern reported at the time of the announcement of the group's interim
results and it is disappointing to be unable to report improvement in
such key areas as the demand for spare parts.''
However, Weir Group's management is pleased with the development
within the group of EnviroTech and new orders in the final quarter of
last year showed signs of improvement.
The #7m restructuring charge will be taken in the accounts for the
year to end-December 1994. Weir did not give any indication of the
annual savings which would be achieved as a result of the
reorganisation.
Taking account of the #7m charge, Yamaichi is forecasting 1994 pre-tax
profits of #35m, after #37.5m in 1993. He has cut his forecast of 1995
profits, which will be boosted by the acquisition of EnviroTech, by #2m
to #52m as a result of yesterday's trading statement.
The City does not generally appreciate the type of statement issued by
Weir so soon after a cash call. The group raised #96m through a
one-for-four rights issue in the autumn to finance the purchase of
EnviroTech.

HAZLEWOOD Foods is selling its shellfish division to a management
consortium for #59m.
The disposal is the latest stage of an ongoing process of
restructuring aimed at concentrating investment on the convenient and
ready meals sector.
These activities are expected to produce above average volume growth
for the forseeable future.
Hazlewood has seen good demand for its pizza and ethnic snacks such as
samosas.
In the year to end March 1994, the shellfish division made profits of
#10.8m on sales of #114.4m. Net assets were #44.9m.
The proceeds of this latest disposal will reduce Hazlewood's
indebtedness by #59m and strengthen its balance sheet.
The disposal will lead to an exceptional charge to profits of about
#48m, comprising a loss of #16m against the book value of assets and
#32m of goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Other disposals in the year include two related businesses trading
under the name of Saint Martin Food Products.

<PAGE>21</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980385967</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FRESH evidence of home produced lamb pricing itself out of the market,
has been presented by the New Zealand Lamb Promotion Council.
Rapid increases in the volume of British lamb exports in the past five
years have led to a 20% cut in supplies for home consumers, and rapidly
escalating prices.
The average price per pound has risen from #1.48 to #1.89 in the five
years to 1994, bringing it close to beef at #2.04 -- and well ahead of
pork at #1.37, and poultry at #1.06.
''In current cautious times for consumers, the attraction of
comparatively cheap poultry will affect lamb and beef sales. This
pressure has been evident over the past few years. NZ lamb has not
escaped these pressures,'' says John Mabb, director of the Council.
But NZ producers, who currently hold a one-third share of the British
market, aim to boost demand for their product with two new initiatives,
in addition to a #1m advertising and promotion campaign which will run
up to Easter.
At one level it has initiated a consumer research project to find out
what type of lamb cuts are really wanted, and at what price. The second
stage in this project is to test market these cuts with selected
retailers.
''Specific details of our research remain under wraps for the time
being, but we hope to have some initial results available for
presentation at the International Food Exhibition in London in April,''
Mr Mabb told a London news conference.
Part two of the Council's strategy is to build on their success with
frozen cuts in the catering sector by introducing the chilled product.
''Throughout '95 we will be introducing chilled lamb into the food
service sector. In fact, an agreement has just been concluded to supply
and support a leading food service supplier, McLaren's, who will be
advertising the fact to their customers from February.''
Further promotional activities will be aimed at increasing demand from
larger food service operators, such as airlines, as well as smaller
outlets such as pubs and their suppliers.
The Council's catering advisory service will also be working with
manufacturing butchers to help create a range of new products.
''This will be a year in which we expect lamb to begin to turn the
corner,'' said Mr Mabb. ''The pressures on NZ lamb in the UK market will
not decrease.

<TEXT>
THE increasing use of itinerant contractors to carry out forestry work
-- bringing little or no benefit to rural communities -- is criticised
by the Scottish Crofters Union in their response to a Department of the
Environment consultation document on sustainable development.
The union recalls that, in the past, forestry was a very good source
of local employment, which was complementary to crofting. The loss of
such employment is seen as a threat to the sustainability of rural
communities.
In the agriculture sector, the SCU call for the re-distribution of
financial support, so that more effective help is given to smaller
producers. They point out that at present, 80% of support money goes to
20% of producers.
They propose a reduction in support to ''agribusinesses,'' and a
re-distribution towards smaller producers, within a system that reflects
natural disadvantage.
More local control of natural resources would, the union suggests,
provide a basis on which sustainable growth could be built.
''Communities would not wish to destroy that which provides income,''
they say.
''There are economic benefits for the local area as they are
encouraged and given confidence to diversify and sell their own products
to an increasinbly global market. There are social benefits through
greater confidence, cohesion, and stability in rural communities.
''The Highlands and Islands of Scotland are significantly different
from other parts of the United Kingdom, and have problems that deserve
attention.''
* WITH cereal crops several weeks ahead of normal growth, BASF have
warned of a high risk of disease and lodging this spring.
Most crops, they say, are up to 50% denser than usual due to mild
autumn weather, and lush growth is susceptible to disease. The spring
spraying season is expected to be one of the earliest on record.

DAIRY farmers' management skills came under question yesterday, as a
survey showed that throughout the United Kingdom more than
three-quarters were currently over-producing -- in quota terms.
Despite the possible impact of penalties, 67% of those surveyed
indicated that they had no plans to make changes to their farming
practice in the coming year to take account of that situation.
Mr Duncan Rose, national ruminant product manager for feed compounder
Bibby, said that it was necessary for farmers to manage quota for the
remainder of the quota year, and to plan their approach to quota from
the very beginning of the next year.
The present failure to come to grips with the situation could be
blamed on ''the nature of farming,'' he said. ''People say their father
and grandfather did it this way -- but a much more progressive approach
is needed.''
Concerns about over-production, leading to the likely imposition of
levies, had only begun to be expressed about October of last year, as
high forage quality led to increased milk yields. ''Milk yield rose, cow
cull numbers fell, so we had more cows, each giving more milk. The
result is we are now further over-quota than we have been before,'' he
said.
Part of the problem, said Mr Rose, was that farmers tended to operate
on a short-term basis. There had been a reluctance to buy-in, or to
lease quota earlier in the year, in the hope that prices might fall.
''Farmers should bite the bullet, if they can afford it, when they see a
price.''
He forecast that in the new quota year, prices would again start
fairly cheap.
Looking to the future, 22% of the farmers surveyed took the view that
the present quota system would end within eight years. This, said Mr
Rose, was a fairly shrewd assessment. The British Government was looking
to do away with quotas, and it was those countries with smaller dairy
herds, and less favoured areas like Italy, which were keen for quotas to
remain.
The survey also demonstrated a desire among farmers for more
information on the whole quota scene. In particular, they identified a
need for up-to-date national information on current quota prices. What
they were seeking was prices for quota traded that day, said Mr Rose.
Progressive farmers also wanted to know what was happening in
Continental Europe, especially with the prospect of quota being traded
within European Union boundaries.
Indications from the survey were that 31% of dairy farmers planned to
cut back on feed, and 13% planned to change the type of feed as part of
their plan for reducing milk yields. ''Both are sensible moves when
planned correctly, but dangerous when looked at in isolation,'' said Mr
Rose.
The biggest threats were a drop in milk protein, and poorer fertility
-- neither of which would be immediately noticeable.
Bibby are themselves launching two new feeds. The first is designed to
reduce yields moderately, while maximising milk protein percentage. The
second is recommended for feeding at low rates where herds are over
quota, and the producer is looking to reduce concentrate inputs by more
than 50%.
The company are also producing a quota management guide and a quota
bulletin, designed to offer farmers the latest information on the quota
scene.
* SHETLAND farmers and crofters must continue to be allowed to ship
live sheep and cattle to the UK mainland, the president of the National
Farmers' Union Scotland Mr John Ross insisted yesterday.
Mr Ross said there was not enough feed in the islands to keep the
animals going throughout the winter, and Shetland agriculture had to
have free and unfettered access to the transportation of animals.
Last autumn 110,000 sheep were shipped from Shetland to the North-East
of Scotland. Out of that number, two ''didn't make the journey,'' he
said.
Mr Ross was in Lerwick to open the NFU's first office in the isles,
where the union has almost 300 members.

THE North of Scotland Milk Co-operative Society are to carry out a
#110,000 investment programme at their Claymore Creamery in Kirkwall,
home of Orkney Cheese.
The money, which includes funding of #30,800 from Orkney Enterprise,
will be used to meet the cost of installing two new 15,000-gallon milk
silos, and computerised cheese scales. Work is expected to be completed
by March.
Plant manager Reg Allan said that the investment had protected the
future of jobs among the creamery's 32 employees. ''If the Orkney
Enterprise funding had not been available we would have been forced to
find the money from within the organisation, and that would have meant
redundancies at Kirkwall,'' he said.

Madrid, Thursday
THE Spanish Congress, or lower house, today rejected an opposition
call for Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to appear in Parliament to
discuss alleged official involvement in a secret war on the Basque
terrorist group Eta.
An all-party parliamentary committee turned down the request by 23
votes to 20. Catalan and Basque nationalists voted with the Socialists
to defeat the motion backed by the centre-right Popular Party and the
United Left.
Charges of Government involvement in the Anti-terrorist Liberation
Group (GAL), which killed 27 alleged Basque separatists between 1983-87,
have plunged Spain into a political crisis and sent its financial
markets tumbling.
On Monday Gonzalez flatly denied personal knowledge of, or Government
involvement in, GAL activities and rejected opposition calls for early
General Elections.
Yesterday he held a private meeting with deputy Socialist leader
Alfonso Guerra for the first time in several months to discuss the
crisis.
After today's committee meeting, Socialist parliamentary leader
Joaquin Almunia said the Government demanded more respect from
opposition leaders who have publicly linked it with GAL. He accused them
of ''passing sentence without being judges''.
''The Prime Minister does not need this chamber to discuss these
matters. What he and his Government require is more respectful
treatment,'' said Almunia.--Reuter.

Hebron, Thursday
A PALESTINIAN stabbed two Israeli settlers near the Jewish settlement
of Kiryat Arba in the occupied West Bank today, and a settler leader
criticised the victims for being unarmed.
Hebron police commander Moshe Ariel said a Palestinian heard the two
speaking Hebrew in an Arab-owned building materials store, then ''took
out a knife and stabbed them''. One settler was in serious condition.
Settlers scorned the two settlers, recent immigrants from France, for
being unarmed in Hebron, a flashpoint of Arab-Jewish violence.
''This was irresponsibility, there are explicit orders to go around
only when armed, and to refrain from selling to and buying from
locals,'' said Zvi Katzover, head of Kiryat Arba settlement.
Palestinians in the store took the two, one stabbed in the chest, the
other in the head, to a nearby Israeli army roadblock where they were
treated before being taken to hospital.
Hebron has long been a focus of Israeli-Palestinian friction, notably
since last February, when a Kiryat Arba settler shot dead some 30 Arab
worshippers in a city mosque.
Meanwhile, a Palestinian teenager was killed and his niece and nephew
were wounded today when a bomb he mistook for a toy blew up in his hands
in the Gaza Strip.
Muhammad Awad Abu Zaher, 18, died playing with the bomb his younger
brother Suleiman had given him, according to his father.
Awad Abu Zaher said Suleiman had found the bomb in a yellow envelope
at a rubbish dump near an Israeli military camp.
Muhammad's one-year-old nephew was seriously wounded and his
two-year-old niece was moderately hurt in the blast at Al-Qarara
village.
Israeli soldiers treated the toddlers before air force helicopters
took them to a hospital in southern Israel.--Reuter.

LATEST results from Lonrho show the firm imprint of Dieter Bock, the
German who eventually succeeded in ousting Tiny Rowland last November,
so rendering the group less opaque, though also less colourful in an age
when sober corporate man predominates.
Mr Bock has taken the first step towards restoring Lonrho's dividends
and yesterday outlined plans for other parts of the group to follow in
the wake of Ashanti Goldfields and be floated off on the stock market,
though with the group retaining control.
''There aren't any skeletons in any cupboards. After two years (I have
been here) this has now been proved'' he noted.
The balance sheet has been transformed by disposals so that gearing is
down to 34%, with 60% of debt not maturing for at least two years.
Profits in continuing activities for the year to last September rose by
#40m to #112m.
The results are for the last time signed off by Mr Rowland and Mr
Bock. Mr Rowland formally steps down as joint chief executive at the
annual meeting, when he will assume the honorary title of president.
Mr Bock said he had no intention of buying up Mr Rowland's remaining
6% stake, to add to his existing 18.6%. What happened to these shares
was no longer of concern to the group.
''Mr Rowland is free to do what he wants with his shares,'' he said.
Lonrho is preparing its hotel interests for flotation. They are
trading well and could be floated off later in the year with a
capitalisation exceeding #600m. The hotels are being grouped together
into a holding company, though a destabilising factor could be the
one-third holding in part of the business held by Libya, which was one
of Mr Rowland's last controversial deals. Mr Bock said the Libyans would
not have a stake in the holding company.
Hotels are trading strongly, with profits up from #17m to #26m. The
Metropole chain is doing particularly well, with occupancy up from 56%
to 63% and profits 29% higher. The benefits of investment in extra rooms
and facilities is coming through strongly.
The Princess resort units were hit by a sharp decline in Mexican
occupancy as a result of political uncertainty. But profits were well
ahead and a better 1995 is predicted. The African hotels are also going
well.
The African interests in general trading are also slated for selling
off, but more work has to be done on them and flotation will not take
place this year. They should be worth more than #150m and could be
floated on local stock markets.
The activities were hit last year by the general uncertainty in
Nigeria and profits tumbled from #33m to #21m. The group recognises that
the division needs rationalising. Despite drought, agriculture profits
jumped by #14m to #33m on the back of better prices.
The motor interests, which include Dutton Forshaw and Jack Barclay,
could also be floated. They made profits of #20m.
What would really create excitement is for Lonrho to do the same for
the dominant mining activities but Mr Bock did not encourage hopes for
this prospect.
Mining profits were up from #58m to #72m, buoyed by high production at
Ashanti and in the platinum division, which also benefited from firmer
prices. Duiker, the quoted South African coal company, doubled profits,
helped by an acquisition and firmer markets.
Elsewhere, manufacturing losses rose from #3m to #15m. Security
printing was ahead but textiles was hit by a reshaping of the business,
which is expected to bring a big recovery this year.
Lonrho shares rose 2[1/2]p to 158[1/2]p and at the moment look more of
an asset play as the group changes itself into an investment holding
company.

Freetown, Thursday
A REBEL leader in Sierra Leone said today that two British aid workers
seized by his men had been helping Government troops in the west African
country.
In a radio conversation with military officials, to which reporters
were invited to listen, Foday Sankoh refused to discuss the well-being
of aid worker Calum Murray, 25, from Lewis, and and his colleague from
London, Robert d'Cruz, 30.
The pair, who work for the Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO)
organisation, disappeared during a rebel raid on the northern town of
Kabala on November 7.
''The question of the two VSOs is not important, so just forget about
them,'' said Sankoh. ''They were captured by RUF (Revolutionary United
Front) rebels because we discovered they were giving military advice to
Government soldiers.''
VSO in Freetown said the two were helping to rebuild roads and bridges
and the Foreign Office said they had nothing to do with the former
British colony's military Government.
''These are two aid workers,'' said an FO spokesman said in London.
''They have nothing whatsoever to do with the political or military
process in Sierra Leone.''
He added: ''The safety of the hostages is the responsibility of the
RUF. We have made sustained efforts to negotiate their safe release but
the RUF has shown no willingness to negotiate.''
Officials said there had been no contact with the RUF since December
16 despite efforts by negotiators to contact them.
The spokesman said there had been media reports that Sankoh told a
defence department official in a radio message that the aid workers
would be killed if the authorities executed an officer accused of
working with the rebels.
''We very much hope the threat will not be carried out,'' the
spokesman said.
A VSO spokesman said: ''From the beginning of the situation we have
consistently urged the Government of Sierre Leone to avoid any action
which might endanger the lives of our volunteers.''
Sankoh's RUF invaded from Liberia in March 1991 with the support of
Charles Taylor's Liberian rebels. Sankoh said he was ready to talk peace
with the Government of Captain Valentine Strasser on condition that his
Nigerian and Guinean allies withdrew.
A first round of talks between the Government and RUF took place on
the Sierra Leone-Liberian border last month. An expected second round
has not yet opened.--Reuter.

David Steele, in his analysis of the local political scene in
Ayrshire, attempts to perpetuate the myth that, ''Labour is comfortably
in charge of Cunninghame'' (December 30).
In fact, Cunninghame District Council was once controlled by the SNP
and it was that administration which took the hard decisions that
previous Labour local authorities in the area had been frightened to
take.
Rents had to be raised to pay for the previous lack of maintenance of
council stock in areas such as Saltcoats.
Likewise, it was the SNP administration which equalised the rents,
meaning tenants paid the same rent for the same type of house wherever
they lived in Cunninghame.
Significantly Labour did not repeal the system when it re-took the
council after a scaremongering campaign under the slogan, ''The SNP
raised your rents.'' And the subsequent Labour administrations have
reaped the benefit of the initiatives and decisions taken by the SNP.
Since 1992 the rise in support for the SNP in the two parliamentary
constituencies which form Cunninghame has been significant, with the
1994 regional election results for Cunninghame North showing the SNP
leapfrogging the Tories into second place. In Cunninghame South the
level of SNP support is even higher.
These facts must have escaped David Steele's notice, also that at the
four local elections held between 1988 and 1994 in Cunninghame North the
SNP was the only party to increase its percentage share of the vote at
every election.
No doubt David Steele is also unaware that the Cunninghame District
Council proposal that Cunninghame should remain as the boundary for the
North Ayrshire unitary authority was the proposal of the SNP group on
Cunninghame District Council.
The Labour group originally went for an all-Ayrshire authority but
later changed its mind and accepted the SNP proposal.
I can assure David Steele that the Labour Party is far from
''comfortably'' in control in Cunninghame and the SNP is ensuring that
it will never be comfortable again.

SPECULATION has long surrounded the long-term commitment of Rank
Organisation to its investment in the Rank Xerox photocopier company.
Yesterday's announcement that the Rank Organisation intends to sell 40%
of its financial interest in Xerox itself for #620m has done little to
damp down that speculation.
Michael Gifford, chief executive of Rank Organisation, said that
although its investment in Xerox had been a good one historically, the
time was right to reduce its investment in the photocopier company and
concentrate resources on developing its core entertainment and leisure
interests in the UK and overseas.
''I view it positively for shareholders,'' said Mr Gifford
highlighting the improvement to Rank Organisation's cashflow and
reduction in its net debt.
Rank estimates that the transaction will result in a gain of about
#325m over the original book value. It made its original Xerox
investment back in 1956 and has been gradually reducing it over the
course of the past 10 years.
Questioned about the possibility of seeking other buyers for the
stake, Mr Gifford said that in reality there was no other buyer but
Xerox itself.
While Rank could have sold its entire stake to Xerox, Mr Gifford said
that it did not wish to have an uncommitted #1000m cash pile.
''I see no reason to do one big deal on one particular day,'' he said.
By retaining a 60% interest in Xerox, Rank is well placed to benefit
from an upturn in Xerox's markets as the recession eases in continental
Europe. A further stake sale in future cannot be ruled out.
In addition to the Xerox transaction, Rank Organisation is proposing
to buy in the 15% of shares that it does not already own from A Kershaw
&amp; Sons in a deal worth #55m cash. It is offering 1150p a share and has
given consent for the payment of a dividend of 120p a share by Kershaw
should the share buy-back be approved. The Rank Group currently owns
86.2% of the shares in Kershaw, which indirectly owns 19.8% of the Rank
Group's interest in Rank Xerox.
As to the Rank Organisation's own business, trading improved during
the course of last year as consumers increased their leisure spending.
This helped profits before tax, non-operating items and Rank Xerox's
restructuring costs to to rise by 37%.
At the pre-tax level Rank Organisation made profits of #284m compared
with #276.6m in 1993. Earnings per share were 17.9p compared with 18.6p
and the total dividend was raised by 9% to 13.25p after a final dividend
of 9.0p.
The Odeon cinema chain saw admissions rise by 9% partly because of the
popularity of the film Four Weddings and a Funeral and toward the latter
half of the year, The Lion King. Rank is keeping a close eye on the
proposed sale of the rival MGM Cinema chain.
Consumer spending rose at both Butlins and Haven but the older
customers of Shearings coach holidays continued to guard their pennies.
However, there was an increase in the number of people taking group
holidays and weekend breaks.
Spending in its casinos and bingo halls improved as the year
progressed. A further 10 bingo clubs are to open this year.
The video duplication business performed strongly with volumes up by
almost half. It has some strong products including Jurassic Park and a
McDonald's promotion. However, film distribution profit was said to have
been flat.
The current financial year is said to have started ''on an encouraging
note'' with operating result ahead of this time last year. City analysts
were still digesting the implications of the Xerox deal and in the
meantime Rank shares dropped 22p to 381p.

Jack McConnell's letter is disingenuous (January 7). As he must be
aware, it is the Labour Party and not the SNP which is adopting Tory
policies on nearly everything from education to nuclear weapons.
There are certainly differences between them on constitutional
matters, but the essential point is that they both want to preserve the
British Union.
This is perverse because this Union is the source of the major
problems which face Scotland. It imposes on Scotland policies which we
have rejected at the polls and which are designed to suit interests and
conditions which are not our own.
It makes us invisible internationally (the worst kind of separation)
and deprives us of a voice in the councils of Europe and other
international organisations.
We are reminded almost daily that this British political system is
discredited, undemocratic, and corrupt.
Why should anyone in Scotland want to preserve a Union which is so
damaging to us? The answer is that British political parties inevitably
give priority to British and not Scottish interests.
The Tories want to keep the Union because it enables them to keep
power in Scotland although they are rejected by the Scottish electorate.
Labour clings to it because Scottish seats give it a better chance of
power at Westminster.
As the European Union expands it becomes ever more urgent for Scotland
to become a full member in its own right. For that we need independence,
not devolution which is intended to prevent it.

Your obituary on Mohamed Siad Barre contained the statement that
Somalia achieved independence in 1960 as a result of the merger of the
British and Italian areas (January 3). This is the opposite of what
happened.
Somaliland Protectorate (British) became independent on June 26, 1960.
Somalia (Italian), under UN trusteeship, became independent five days
later. The two independent territories then united.
This is not just an academic quibble. Because of the troubles the
country has gone through and the disillusionment with the union, the
former protectorate has, as the Republic of Somaliland, declared its
independence from Somalia.
This has not been recognised by the UN or the international community.
An important argument in the case for independence is the fact that,
having freely entered into an agreement with Somalia, the
ex-protectorate is fully entitled to withdraw from the agreement.

Parents, already blamed for many of today's social ills, are now being
held responsible for children's ill-health. Increases in childhood
asthma and bronchitis are apparently the result of the parents'
cigarette smoking or their cars' contribution to choking pollution.
A recent study claimed that nearly 50 children under five are admitted
to hospital every day suffering from illnesses such as asthma and
bronchitis because of passive smoking. The Government used the
opportunity to launch a three-year #13.5m campaign to reduce smoking --
mainly it seems by using children's health as emotional blackmail.
The merit of campaigns like this one, designed to blame individual
lifestyles for illnesses, is that they are a much cheaper option than
providing more NHS resources (they also supply the Chancellor of the
Exchequer with a good excuse for a hike in petrol prices and road
taxes).
I don't accept the assumption that smoking and/or pollution are the
cause of increased asthma in the population, especially among children.
The rise has occurred during a period when both air pollution and
smoking have been significantly reduced. In British cities, sulphur
dioxide emissions and atmospheric smoke particles have fallen steadily
over the past 20-30 years. The number of smokers among Britain's adult
population has been virtually halved in the past 20 years -- from 50% to
just over one-quarter.
In my view, more plausible explanations are the very much higher
levels of stress and anxiety in the general population, as well as
deteriorating housing/living conditions for some sections of society.
Asthma is most often associated with allergies (especially to house dust
mite, animal fur, and grass pollen) and anxiety.
Many of the families of children I see are suffering stress due to
unemployment, the continual threat of redundancy, or worsening working
conditions. Poor housing, damp and often overcrowded living conditions
predispose to most chest complaints. For families on income support
basic measures against house dust mite, such as regular renewal of good
quality mattresses and bedding or daily vacuum cleaning, are
unaffordable luxuries.
I wish my colleagues in the medical profession would treat Virginia
Bottomley's latest campaign with the same degree of scepticism they
apply to her other pronouncements and measures. Unfortunately, given
their anti-smoking zeal, I expect she will get away with it.

Washington, Monday
THE first American soldier to be killed in the four months US troops
have occupied Haiti died today in an exchange of gunfire at a toll booth
north of Port-au-Prince.
A second soldier was wounded and a Haitian civilian was killed in the
incident in Gonaives, a town about 100 miles from the Haitian capital.
Three US soldiers involved in the international peacekeeping effort,
two in Haiti and one during training in Puerto Rico, have committed
suicide since the occupation began on September 19: however none had
been killed until today.
The attack was also only the second on an American soldier during the
operation. A soldier was shot by an unknown assailant in Les Cayes soon
after the Americans arrived.
A military spokesman said 3rd Special Forces Group soldiers were
observing toll booth operations today when two Haitians in a pick-up
truck drove past the toll booth.
The Americans chased the truck and forced it to stop.
The driver got out of the vehicle brandishing a weapon, and shot one
soldier in the chest and the other in the arm.
The soldier on the passenger's side returned fire, killing the
passenger and detaining the driver until extra troops were called to the
scene.
The two soldiers were flown in a US Army helicopter to the 28th Combat
Support Hospital in Port-au-Prince, where one died of his
wounds.--Reuter.

With the help of my car, a wheelchair, and British Rail Motorail I can
take my disabled wife from the south coast of England to visit our
family near Stranraer. The journey time is a little over 12 hours.
If the Motorail facility were withdrawn the journey would take at
least two days with at least one night stop both ways. She would not be
able to contemplate such a journey, therefore family visits would be
impossible.
With Scotland becoming more dependent on tourism, such a closure would
surely have a devastating effect on the number of people travelling to
your beautiful country.

John Linklater's article on splitting British Telecom directories for
Glasgow mentions ''once the CD-ROM takes over'' (January 5).
It may not be generally known that UK telephone numbers are available
in the US on one CD-ROM covering the whole of the UK. It costs just over
#100, but distribution is being impeded by BT which alleges the
telephone numbers are copyright, pointing out that the CD-ROM was
compiled from BT directories.
It is surely high time this company, which boasts of its hi-tech
investment since privatisation, considered marketing its own CD-ROM at
an affordable price, but I suspect British Telecom still has someone who
would think it a good idea to issue the CD-ROM in two halves.

THE contagion of violence is a familiar phenomenon but when it
involves agents of government in a civil conflict its effect is somehow
worsened. Because of the activities of the Basque separatist group ETA,
and the response of a shadowy group of murderers allegedly linked with
the Spanish Government, the administration of Felipe Gonzalez is in a
state of serious crisis. The charge against the Gonzalez Government is
that between 1983 and 1987 it sanctioned the actions of an
anti-terrorist group called GAL which led to the deaths of 23 people
including several members of ETA, then tried to conceal the events. The
alleged links between GAL and the Gonzalez Government of the time have
not been fully established, but two former policemen have been jailed
for involvement with GAL and both have contributed a stream of
allegations which appear to involve elements in Government. Both men are
widely regarded as scapegoats for bigger fish, but how much bigger is
still not known.
The crucial point for Mr Gonzalez at the moment is that his
protestations of innocence, made angrily on Spanish television earlier
this week, are clearly not believed by the public. Opinion polls have
shown majorities which reject his denials. Worse, a significant majority
believes that he should resign and that elections should be held. In a
sense the intensity of the crisis afflicting Mr Gonzalez on this issue
shows a maturation of the Spanish political process. In the early days
of the allegations the opposition parties were obviously unwilling to
push matters too far. There was a general reluctance to make allegations
relating to a time when Spain's infant democracy was trying to shake off
the effects of the Franco regime, and a further recognition that the
security forces, at least at the time of the earliest charges, may not
have been fully under the control of the Socialist Government. This was
a delicate judgment, but it has disappeared with the general
appreciation that the current scandal is only the latest in a series of
corruption cases which have badly damaged the credibility of Mr
Gonzalez.
With his denials apparently rejected by the public it is difficult to
see what more the Prime Minister can do, save ride out the worst waves
if he can. His minority Government still has the support of its Catalan
nationalist partners, but within the Socialist Party the split between
Mr Gonzalez and his deputy, Alfonso Guerra, on internal matters is
unlikely to be healed. In the meantime the Spanish currency, the stock
market, and government bonds continue to reel groggily from the effects
of the scandal. Mr Gonzalez is determined to hang on to power until the
end of his mandate in 1997, but a more realistic view suggests this is
unlikely. Indeed, he could be fortunate if he manages to retain power
until the middle of this year when Spain is due to take over the
presidency of the European Union. If Mr Gonzalez and his Government fall
over this affair it will be a sad end to a brave period in Spanish
political history. The achievement of re-establishing democracy in Spain
after a dark period will not, however, be obliterated by shadowy
murderers who properly belong to the previous era.

I hesitate to engage in verbiage with my critics, whose main concern
seems to be the survival of rail jobs rather than the interests of
passengers and taxpayers (December 28 and January 2).
I can assure Mr Landery that I write only on behalf of the taxpayer,
with no affiliation to any road or rail body.
Mr Smart says building railways provides more jobs per pound than
building roads. So it may, since rail building and maintenance is
labour-intensive.
He says no passengers were killed in train crashes in the last
financial year, but recent public inquiries have highlighted several
deaths -- notably the malicious and sad accident involving a Wemyss
Bay/Greenock train.
In 28 years road deaths in the UK have halved from 7952 in 1965 to
3819 in 1993 while road vehicles have doubled. Motorways are the safest
surface transport.
Let us be constructive. Rail has a vitally important future in
providing fast commuter services, long-distance full train-loads of
freight, and competing intercity, but not in the provision of rural
services now superseded by coaches, buses, and minibuses.
I am strongly in favour of the electrification and radio control of
all viable rail. One of the Glasgow-Edinburgh lines should be
electrified and the A8/M8 converted to full three-lane motorway -- both
are long overdue. Electrification of Glasgow/Edinburgh/Perth/Aberdeen
should have priority.
These could be provided by a privatised Railtrack with the infusion of
private capital, always assuming that the projects are cost-effective
and likely to be profitable.
We may yet see Manchester/ Liverpool/Birmingham/London ''Bullet''
trains (which pay in Japan) and Edinburgh/London TGV.

THE main lines of the next General Election campaign, in Scotland at
least, have now been clearly etched. The coming two years may see these
deepening, attracting more detail, new highlighting, and, possibly, new
shadows, but it is hard to see any significant departures. Labour
remains the frontrunner in the debate for two reasons: it is the biggest
party in Scotland (and likely on present evidence to form the next
Westminster administration), and its ideas have a relevance to the
conduct of government everywhere in the UK. If there were no Labour
constitutional proposals, there would almost certainly be no UK-wide
debate on Scotland's present and future parliamentary role within the
Union, in spite of the novel (and commendable) initiatives of the SNP in
taking its own campaigning for separation straight to English opinion.
Labour promises a new Scottish Parliament with powers of taxation,
albeit limited. Its reason is not the straightforward nationalist case
of Scotland's distinction, history, and unhappiness with the existing
arrangements, though these are recognised. Labour's case is that the
trends of British government during the Thatcher-Major years have been
to centralise power over-much in London and reduce the power of elected
British local authorities, often by transferring it to non-elected
quangos without any democratic accountability.
The Labour hope is to revitalise centres of power independent of the
London government (and even the Edinburgh Civil Service) by creating new
institutions -- democratically elected assemblies for Scotland and Wales
and similar bodies for English regions. This formula goes some way to
meeting the aspiration of Scots and Welsh people for a distinct voice in
running their own affairs but it retains the Union, and is designed to
bolster it, not fragment it. Labour in this case remains a unionist
party, and though it does accept some part of the nationalist case, its
stance is more conservative than it seems at first sight. It is still
too risky for the Tories, as the Prime Minister made clear in the House
of Commons yesterday. The Tory line will remain unyielding, and will
even try to force opinion to ignore Labour's option by insisting that
the only valid choice for Scottish voters is between the extremes of
separation and the status quo.
That policy helped the Scottish Tories last time (and may even have
been somewhat to the Tories' advantage in England) but it does itself
have a dangerous dimension if it helps the SNP by directing additional
support to it from Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Those who reduce
the middle ground also reduce the scope for compromise which is
essential to liberal politics. The SNP will relish this possibility
precisely because it is no longer a devolutionist but a separatist
party. The Tories insist that all responses to nationalism are
unacceptable except the defence of the status quo. That leaves too
little room for adjustment in the face of Scottish opinion. Those who
want to preserve the United Kingdom should not accept the argument that
its constitution has to be like some long dead insect in amber. A
constitution is a living instrument for the good of those who flourish
under it. It has to be capable of change and repair, lest like old
clothes it is too easily cast aside.

MINNEAPOLIS: The daughter of slain black activist Malcolm X has been
arrested in an alleged plot to kill Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan, her father's bitter enemy before his assassination in 1965.
The FBI said Qubilah Bahiyah Shabazz, 34, was arrested in Minneapolis
yesterday and was charged in a murder-for-hire scheme.
The alleged plot was apparently the latest in a 30-year dispute that
began when Malcolm X criticised and split with Nation of Islam founder
Elijah Muhammed and then was attacked as a ''traitor'' by Farrakhan, who
remained loyal to Muhammed, the Black Muslim leader.

Nothing much new was revealed in yesterday's sudden flare-up of
case-stating by all interested parties in the state of the Union debate.
But at least the London press came out in force to pay attention.
Political reporter Ben Brogan reports on an unprecendented exercise in
listening
LONDON'S self-styled national media seldom turns its attention to the
troubles of the ''outer regions''. So the forest of cameras which filled
the Jubilee Room in the House of Commons yesterday, and the
standing-room only turn-out, suggested a watershed: here, after years on
the Celtic fringe, was Scotland -- An Issue of National Importance.
They had come to hear about devolution, independence, and the question
of Scotland's place in the Union, subjects which seldom preoccupy the
denizens of the Palace of Westminster. But the Prime Minister's decision
to make the constitution a battleground for the next election has
changed that -- so much so that yesterday the SNP and Labour held
successive briefings to explain to the English media why each wants to
change Scotland's place in the United Kingdom.
There was nothing new in any of it. But for those not accustomed to
such talk, yesterday turned into a crash-course in constitutional
politics, full of the mantras familiar to most of us --
''democratic-deficit'', ''quango-state'', and ''75 per cent of Scots
want some form of change''. The words were dutifully invoked, as each
party sought to take advantage of this new-found interest in the future
of the UK.
First up was the SNP, with a press conference advertised as a chance
for the English to learn more about the struggle for independence. The
party laid on its A-team -- leader Alex Salmond, deputy leader Dr Allan
Macartney, MP Maggie Ewing and chief executive Mike Russell -- and a
table-full of elevating literature, including Mr Salmond's collected
speeches (no charge).
The English turned out in force -- one eminent Fleet Street pundit
said he hadn't seen so many journalists at an SNP press conference in 15
years -- and asked most of the questions.
The SNP emphasised it wants to separate the question of Scotland from
what happens in the rest of the UK. A Scottish parliament should not be
conditional on assemblies for the as-yet undefined regions of England.
Dr Macartney said: ''There is a legitimate and attractive argument for
decentralisation in England, but it is a policy which should be pursued
in response to English regional demands and priorities, and not as a
by-product of a flaw in Labour's Scottish commitments.''
According to Mr Salmond, the only difference between Labour and the
Tories is a technical one: both want to save the Union. The difference
is how. Mr Major remains committed to an undemocratic and unpopular
status quo; Tony Blair offers devolution coupled to undefined reforms in
Wales and England. That, he says, amounts to ''two sides of the Unionist
coin''.
An hour later Gordon Brown strode into the same room to deliver a
speech to something called the Labour Finance and Industry Group. The
few members of the group on hand to hear his address were outnumbered by
journalists by about ten to one, confirming suspicions that the occasion
had been concocted.
The concerted attack on Labour's constitutional plans led by the Tory
party and its friends in the press has put pressure on Labour to explain
the detail, in particular of its plans for devolved assemblies in Wales
and the English regions. None were forthcoming yesterday, other than a
promise of consultation. The difficulties of creating a devolved
government where no clear regional identity exists remains stubbornly
unresolved.
Mr Brown focused on emphasising the need for constitutional change.
Power in Tory Britain is too concentrated in the centre and is above all
unaccountable. ''I want a redistribution of power from the centre to our
regions and communities, from unaccountable administrative elites in
Whitehall to elected decision makers in our local communities. A radical
shift of power from the state to the people of this country,'' he said.
Above all, constitutional change would guarantee the health of the
Union. ''It is by doing nothing that we will allow disruptive pressures
to grow.''
There was no opportunity for questions after the speech, which
attracted a few Scottish MPs -- Ernie Ross, Alistair Darling, and Tam
Dalyell, who refused to comment following the revelation last week that
he remains as unhappy about the West Lothian question as he did 16 years
ago.
Attention turned instead to Prime Minister's Questions that afternoon,
where what appeared to be an orchestrated show of hostility to any
change in the Union by Tory back-benchers was met by equally fierce
declarations in favour of devolution by Labour and the Liberal
Democrats.
Scotland dominated the exchanges, and remains at the centre of the
debate. Proof? Last night Welsh journalists were protesting to anyone
who would listen that the Speaker had failed to call a single Welsh MP.

IN the 14 years or so I have informed you all out there of a Friday on
this blatt I have only twice found myself writing the same thing, or at
least on the same subject, as another writer.
Once was many years ago. The second was last week when I discovered
that John Linklater was writing about the disgraceful changes in
measures of spirits in pubs.
As it happens the both articles were grand and a complement to each
other and to common sense -- John was as outraged as myself.
The chances therefore of me writing on the same subject as another
Herald blatter is slight. The chances of me doing it two weeks in a row
are enough for me to consider doing the Lottery, even if I have decided
to have sod-all to do with anything which involves this Edmonds idjit.
But do I now find myself thinking all week about the topic of this
week's little sermon and there is Willie Hunter's column but the day
before me. Took me aback, it did.
But William has a different, and Paisley, pattern to his notions. I
have a Glaswegian and ghastlier frame to my exegesis. Hunter wrote of a
publication founded and owned by a one-time Heraldic colleague, Kenneth
Roy, an in-house sort of magazine for journos called The Journalist's
Handbook. Hacks like me -- important ones like -- get it sent out to us.
For nothing.
Mr Hunter wrote much about it and was very nice to it. He is, after
all, a Buddie, and is generally nice to everybody. I am a wee and
dreadful person and am rarely nice about anybody except girls and Elvis
Presley.
Wilful Woy
And so although I like Mr Kenneth Roy -- a former BBC luminary who has
been very pleasant to me in the years before Ruth Wishart managed to
keep me off the airwaves when she can (och, a wee jibe Ruth, for
heaven's sake, and no very clever at that) -- so notwithstanding that
Ken is a splendid old chum, here I am about to be rotten to him. And due
it he is.
For while William was wildly wonderful to wilful Woy, I am going to be
rippingly robust about our Ken and his magazine. Ken Roy has a
splendidly splenetic attitude to Scottish journalism and quite right
too. It is often parochial and inconsiderate of larger concerns.
Consider something more shameful. Ken Roy's Journalist's Handbook is a
well-organised and well written little document. But it should shame
Scotland.
This publication is written, printed, and produced in Scotland, from
what my colleague, Mr Hunter, allows himself to describe as ''darkest
Ayrshire''. The magazine has a celebratory issue. Ten years it has
existed. It is for British journalists, and for British journalism. Yet
the people who run it are Scottish. And the past decade has seen so many
Scottish journalists, let alone editors. Scots are among the most
prominent writers and broadcasters in the whole of the British islands.
Read the Journalist's Handbook and discover why we are not a nation.
Abject drivel
There are five and a half million inhabitants of Scotland, and two
major broadsheet newspapers. Ireland has two broadsheets too, the Irish
Times and the Irish Independent. The Republic possesses just over three
million residents. Any journalist or broadcaster in Ireland is regarded
as a national writer, even in England. A Scottish writer might as well
be working for the Ambridge Star.
This Scottish-based publication saw fit to write about an entire
decade of journalism, and journalists, of broadcasting and broadcasters
and only ever mentioned any organisation in its entire round-up of 10
years and any individual if they had worked in London or were based
there.
A collection of supine and sycophantic counter-jumpers who wrote
abject drivel for newspapers which licked more bahookies than you could
sqeeze into the average football stadium are given copious mentions
throughout this almanac.
Not one single ''provincial'' mention. Provincial being, for a start,
Scottish. Quotes from idjits like Jean Rook or George Gale. In Ireland
they wouldn't give houseroom to such mince. But here, in Scotland, where
they print and publish a journal for journalists, not one single
Scottish publication, not one Scottish writer, gets a mention.
Jean Rook, George Gale, am I not better than they? Behold the fowls of
the air. They sow not, neither do they reap. I am not talking of
journalists here at all. Couldn't care less about blowhards like myself.
I do this for a living. I'm talking about Scotland. If we have our own
writers and publishers who talk of ourselves as though we didn't exist,
well, we don't exist.
Dammit, I exist right enough. So does William Hunter and the rest of
us who manage to produce, parochial or not, generally a brighter prose
than the dull English, and a portion of European culture from time to
time which the strangers do not know. The English might not know it, but
we Scots do, and so do I. Awfy big-heided, I can still light a penny
candle from a star. Nations can.

IT ISN'T easy to convey just how grateful some of us have been, and
for so long, to Tam Dalyell. Sixteen happy years -- count them -- and
neither a twitter nor a growl on the subject of devolution. It may be a
personal best; it has certainly been a blessing.
What a blow, then, to see the old paladin step forward this week, gird
his loins, gather his thoughts, open his mouth -- and add nothing
whatever to the debate. No variations on old themes, no innovations in
his celebrated analysis. Tam is crying havoc again; put the children to
bed.
No particular blame attaches to the MP for Linlithgow. Since an
altruistic Prime Minister decided at the turn of the year to give poor
Scotland something to talk about, the body politic has stirred like
Sleeping Beauty, rubbed her eyes, and found matters exactly as they
were, dust and cobwebs apart. For anyone who remembers 1979, this lends
a surreal quality to the debate.
Once again Tam wants an answer to his West Lothian Question. Once
again, the Tories are theatrically alarmed about tax and layers of
government.
On cue, Labour joins the dots by maintaining that England can have as
many assemblies as she likes, if she likes, if that helps. Yet again,
the SNP says it's all a crock but, hey, this is politics; waste not want
not.
Tam demands to know why, come the day, he will be able to vote at
Westminster on education policies for England but not on schools for
Linlithgow. He asks how devolution is possible within a unitary state.
He stirs the putrid entrails and decries fearful anomalies poised to
contaminate the Union Labour vows to protect.
There is, of course, no anomaly in the fact that every week English
MPs adjudicate on Scottish affairs while Scots MPs alone never win a
vote. Neither (unless Tam has been making unreported speeches in front
of his bathroom mirror) is it thought odd that a centralised Scottish
Office is administered by a minority party legislating in cheerful
defiance of the feelings of most Scots. As questions go, West Lothian's
is the most one-sided of all.
Tam's problem, intellectually, is the concept of the unitary state.
Westminster's apologists rely on the idea, but stubborn reality argues
otherwise. A union of two nations, one principality and one province, is
in no genuine sense unitary -- hence the Scottish Office. That
settlement, not devolution, is the fount of anomalies.
Tam votes on purely English matters all the time, just as English MPs
vote on purely Welsh, purely Scottish, and purely Irish matters.
Needless to say, a Conservative English majority finds no problem with
the arrangement, rightly assuming that Tam and his Scottish colleagues
will never trouble them in the lobbies. But since he is asking his old
question, we might ask him one in return: what does he propose? To leave
well enough alone?
It seems so. Faced with a ton of undemocratic practice -- call it the
Westminster Question -- Tam frets again over a grain that might irritate
English MPs. He worries both that he will not be able properly to
represent his constituency while free to interfere in ''purely English''
matters. What might this mean?
Nothing much, as it turns out. Since Linlithgow would be represented
at an assembly, only Tam's workload would be affected. And, if the
proper treatment of purely Scottish (or English, or Welsh, or Irish)
matters has never much troubled Westminster's conscience before, it
seems a bit late to start agonising now.
Dalyell, revolving round the British state like a rogue moon, doesn't
think in those terms, of course, and neither does his party. Like the
Prime Minister, Labour has begun to turn the Scottish Question into the
English Question. Major says the issue is not a matter for Scotland
alone while Blair, suddenly bewitched by constitutional voodoo, proposes
English assemblies to meet Tam's objections.
A little clarity is needed here. Is Major really saying that
Scotland's future can only be settled by an English vote? If he is, he
should declare his retainer from the SNP in the register of members'
interests. Is Labour meanwhile proposing federalism, whether slumbering
England wants it or not? If so, the party should explain to Scotland
what ''home rule'' might mean exactly when set beside the
Semi-Autonomous Municipal Republic of Greater Manchester plc.
Still, if Tam has made no advance, Ian Lang has engaged reverse and
put his foot down. He asks us to imagine, as though for the first time,
the horrors of an assembly with tax-raising powers.
Surely all the world knows it is the hereditary duty of Tory
chancellors alone to seek to slap 17.5% VAT on heating fuel? Who, with
such knowledge, could trust an Edinburgh parliament?
The Scottish Secretary is worried, too, about an added layer of
bureaucracy loaded on Scotland's groaning shoulders. This is odd, coming
from the man who is even now sweeping away the Tories' main traditional
objection to devolution. You will remember how they always said an
assembly would only be possible if a tier of local government were
removed. So where are the snows of yesteryear?
Yesterday, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said Labour's proposals
would give ''democratic legitimacy to existing institutions of
government''. Democratic perhaps, but legitimate? Brown framed the case
for devolution in terms of an attack on ''quango culture''. Very
laudable, but hardly the heart of the matter.
There is only one important issue in the debate. Devolution's
advocates argue that independence makes no sense because the societies
and economies of Scotland and England are thoroughly entwined.
Simultaneously, they claim our nationhood is so distinct we must have a
wee assembly, no matter what.
Both propositions can't be right. Submerged or distinct: which is it?

Fiona Ross had just recovered from a nervous breakdown and the shock
of unemployment when she discovered that she had breast cancer. She
tells how she managed to cope.
FIONA Ross declares: ''I'm a one-breasted woman in a two-breasted
world.'' She is upfront about her battle with cancer as she firmly
believes that being open helps herself and others too. But discovering
she had the disease was a double blow for the 56-year-old from Stirling.
Only two years before she was diagnosed as having cancer she had a
nervous breakdown which forced her to take early retirement from her job
as a primary school librarian with Central Region.
With the help of drugs and holistic therapy she recovered, and she was
busy establishing a growing reputation in her second career as an artist
when she received the news all women dread: you've got breast cancer.
Her first inkling that something might be wrong was the discovery on
Christmas Day two years ago that a nipple had changed colour.
''But I didn't think anything of it. After all, only six months before
I had taken part in the national breast-screening programme for women
over 50 and I was given the all clear. It never crossed my mind at that
stage that it could be anything serious.''
Another couple of months passed before she went to see her doctor who
immediately referred her to Stirling Royal Infirmary.
''I was told I had a rare form of breast cancer,'' says Fiona, talking
in the flat in the Riverside area of Stirling which she shares with her
friend Chris.
How did the doctor break the news to her? ''I was taken into a side
room and told I had a malignant tumour. I would have liked to have had
some warning beforehand that there was bad news in store so I could have
taken a friend with me. You only register one word in five when they
tell you that you've got a malignant tumour. Cancer. Death. I got the
news on a Friday and was told to come in on the following Monday for an
operation.''
Over the next couple of months she had two lumpectomies in Stirling
Royal Infirmary followed by an emergency admission after she developed
an infection.
She was terrified of losing her breast, and the day she learnt this
was going to happen is brutally etched on her memory.
''I was sitting there naked to the waist when this surgeon walked in,
took one look at me and said casually: 'That will have to come off.' I
was absolutely petrified. To make matters worse he was standing over me
at the time. He didn't even wait for me to get dressed, just stood over
me in a very aggressive male stance. If I had had some clothes on and he
had been sitting down and I had had a friend with me it would have
helped.
''Since then I have written to the hospital and complained about the
procedure and they have apologised. I happen to be an articulate
middle-class woman with a strong personality. Even so, I was shattered.
What about other women? How is the news broken to them?
''You hear women saying that it's for the best, and it may be in
theory, but when it comes to your turn that's not how you react. I was
terrified. I went through all kinds of emotional turmoil. I'm a very
squeamish, cowardly person. I couldn't take the news in at first.''
After the operation she was comforted by a hospital breast care nurse
who would come in early, often at 7am, to be with her -- a service she
cannot speak highly enough about.
Treatment with the cancer drug tamoxifen followed. ''The only side
effect I've had is some tingling in the fingers,'' she says.
For Fiona the real hurdle was learning to live with mastectomy,
something she found extremely difficult.
After the operation she couldn't bear to look at herself in the
mirror. ''I would steam the bathroom mirror up first before going in so
that I wouldn't see my wound. I couldn't get used to looking at my own
body. I couldn't get used to looking at nothing. I did try self-help
groups but they were not for me.''
However, her holistic therapist offered an invaluable piece of advice:
''She suggested I run a hot bath, put some aromatherapy oils in, then
sit in it and scream or cry. It was a great relief.''
As a former librarian she knew how to set about getting all the
information she wanted. ''I found the MacMillan nurses in Edinburgh
particularly helpful. But I would have liked to have had some
counselling in the early stages. When you discover you've got cancer
suddenly everything happens so quickly.''
She believes cancer often has a psychological component and considers
her own case a typical one. ''I had nursed a lot of bitterness all my
life. As a child I wanted to go to art college but my parents would not
allow it. They wanted me to have a 'proper job with a pension'.''
She laughs uproariously as she says: ''These days you can't get a job
let alone one with a pension.''
So Fiona trained as a librarian and painted in her spare time,
attending evening classes at Edinburgh College of Art. Today her
cheerful boat paintings find many ready buyers. At a recent exhibition
of her work in Pittenweem, Fife, the majority were sold.
Did having cancer change her? ''Yes, of course, when you are faced
suddenly with your own mortality everything swings sharply into focus.
Things that you once thought mattered no longer do. You learn to value
friendships.''
The triple blow of a nervous breakdown, losing her job and developing
cancer has also taught her to be less dogmatic. ''It helps me to talk
about it and I think it helps others too who have been through a similar
experience. Women have said that they felt able for the first time to
talk about their experience once I raised the subject.''
Cancer has taught her to be less accommodating too. ''I've learnt to
say no. Before I wanted to please everyone. I'm a perfectionist. I
expect the highest of myself, and others too.
Having the disease, she says, is hardest on those around you. ''It's
worse for those close to you. They feel so helpless. All they can do is
stand and watch. At least I could concentrate on survival.
''Yes, I've changed my lifestyle. I am on the raw energy diet, lots of
fresh fruit and vegetables. I used to drink and smoke but I gave smoking
up 15 years ago.''
While holistic therapy built her up physically and emotionally, it was
her wide circle of friends who provided the spiritual strength. She got
comfort from a number of religions, including spiritual healing.
She knows it is too early to talk of a cure, five years must elapse
first, but she is coming to terms with her mastectomy and her second
career as a painter is gaining momentum. Her work has been exhibited in
galleries from Gullane in East Lothian to Stromness, Pittenweem,
Aberfoyle, Glasgow and Largs, and now she has started to sell in
America.
Having cancer enabled Fiona Ross to uncover strengths she never knew
she had: ''It has taught me to be a survivor. I'm a fighter though I
never thought of myself as a fighter.''
As an artist, people told her that she would paint differently once
she had experienced the trauma of disease. ''Nonsense. I just paint
more. I paint like a dervish, conscious of every wasted hour. I value my
time now.''

David Belcher waxes lyrical over a reclusive Scots master songsmith
who remains remarkably unmoved by success
THIRTEEN years amounts to several lifetimes in the music business.
When lyricist Graham Wilson started making his way on the industry's
Scottish fringes in the early eighties, every London record-company
talent scout was a mellow geezer wearing red Kickers, a satin bomber
jacket, baseball cap and a curly perm. But those able to contain their
sartorial revulsion found certain advantages to this somewhat
un-streetwise brand of laissez-faire.
''I remember going to an A&amp;R man when I was running my own Stampede
label here in Glasgow and saying: ''Love and Money have got this idea,
Candy Bar Express it's called. Can you give us some demo money?'' So the
bloke went away for two minutes and came back with a cheque for #1600. I
didn't have to sign anything for it. In those days, the majors just
handed out money.''
But times change, both economically -- ''Labels will now argue if a
demo costs #50 more than you told them it would'' -- and
technologically, as a glance around Graham's airy West End living-room
attests. Against one wall, taking up less space than the mahogany
radiogram of yore, is the digital recording equipment with which Graham
and sundry music-writing partners last year crafted eight hit singles.
How big were these hits? Who were they for? Pop's secret
song-sorcerer, the reclusive Graham appears nonplussed.
''Er, um . . . small ones for Optimistic and Milan. One for the
Nightcrawlers, which is John Reid, Ross Campbell, Hugh Brankin and me.
And, ah . . . five for Bad Boys Inc. Let me count them up . . . oh, it
must be one top 10 and three top 20.''
You seem commendably unmoved by your multiple success. ''I'm too old
and jaded to get excited. For instance, I was in New York for New Music
Seminar and went into a big dance-music record shop where they happened
to be playing a Nightcrawlers bootleg. I asked about it at the counter,
and the shop-owner said he'd just sold the last copy because everything
by the Nightcrawlers flew straight out the door.
''When I said: 'Sorry, I need to know some publishing details about
the record because I actually wrote it,' every head turned and I was
mobbed by guys with their own bands pressing their phone numbers on me.
Ridiculous. When I got home, I found they'd all sent me their records. I
enjoy it, though -- and it's certainly great to be taken seriously by
publishers and given good work.''
Signed to Chrysalis Publishing, Graham's goodly task in 1995 is to
craft more winning words for toppermost-poppermost teen-acts Bad Boys
Inc and Optimistic -- as well as to further the chart careers of Gemini,
Misty Oldland, re-mixers BBG, and JC001. Additionally, Graham will be
creating an album for budding r&amp;b diva Lisa Moorish. And he'll be
writing for the Latitude label, newly begun by Simply Red's manager,
Elliot Rashman.
Graham's Simply Red connection is cemented by his songwriting
partnership with Mick Hucknell's oppo Tim Kellett. In addition to John
Reid, Graham collaborates with another native tunesmith, Gordon Goudie,
of Eight Miles High, whose debut LP Graham produced, and Martin Virgo,
London-based purveyor of keyboard stylings on Bjork's acclaimed album.
Utilising the time-saving marvel that is digital sampling, records
provide the modern music-maker with another powerful collaborative
force. Having DJ'd in clubs five nights a week for much of the past
decade, Graham thus has a uniquely-informed collection of vinyl from
which to draw inspiration.
''When I DJ, I mix everything up: r&amp;b, hip hop, soul, northern soul,
southern soul, Philly soul, seventies disco, ragga. Everything apart
from garage and house, although I do write garage and house stuff for
Bad Boys' producer, Ian Levine. But in the past three months, because
I've been so busy songwriting, I've had to cut it down to Thursdays at
Universe in Coatbridge.''
If Graham owes his present status to clubland, it's not much of an
exaggeration to say that Scottish clubland in its current diverse and
vibrant form owes much to Graham. After all, in tandem with nightlife
entrepreneurs Allan Campbell and Sam Piacentini, he created the Sub
Club, still at the top today.
''I started the Gang Hut at Maestro's round about 1982 because, as a
Glasgow Art School student, I wanted something better than your
bog-standard disco, which is all there was. We were the first ones to do
memberships and have a logo, the whole club-within-a-club thing, and it
quickly became successful.
''But the Sub Club's first night was a disaster, with a crowd of 100.
But I think I was more terrified the next week when I turned up with my
box of records and saw queues round the block, and was told that 600
folk had paid in inside the first half-hour.'' Clubland has its downs as
well as ups, however. Branching out in 1990 with another club, The
Champion, Graham lost all the capital he'd built up in the previous five
years.
But what's the trick of being a top songwriting popster? Excess all
areas? No sleep till bedtime? Forget it. Graham opts for a sensible,
straightforward nine-to-five approach. ''The wildest it's got has been
writing songs over the phone when I had to knock out five in a day once.
''There's a knack to pop songs. No, there's a formula to them -- and
that's not meant to sound demeaning because, although the rules are
simple, it's not easy to follow them. You need a catchy title; a strong,
memorable melody; lyrics that are soulful.''
Graham's soulful, hip-hoppy side can be heard on February 23 in
Glasgow's Bar Miro, when he and his music-storing computers -- assisted
by sundry rappers and Gordon Goudie's guitar -- make a rare public
appearance at the re-launch of Expresso Bongo. Hitherto, Graham's one
low-key step into the spotlight was as the creator of the theme tune to
STV's Don't Look Down.
In fact, he'll soon be retreating more fully from Glasgow, presently
being in the middle of re-locating home, hearth and studio to
Tighnabruaich. A Strathaven laddie, Graham spends a fortnight every
month in London's bustle and is responding to a need for cleaner air and
quiet.
Yet, afore he leaves Glasgow, Graham is ''desperate to find a good
girl singer. I've got three brilliant tracks waiting for the right
voice,'' he says. Golden-larynx'd applicants can contact him via me.
Music being in a continual state of re-invention, contenders sporting
red Kickers and a curly perm may just find themselves at an advantage.
Genuine ability and a willingness to work will be more useful, however.

Washington, Thursday
The O J Simpson trial in Los Angeles has come abruptly to the heart of
the matter: the prosecution claims to have clear evidence that Mr
Simpson abused and beat his wife, and that after they were divorced he
stalked, threatened, and harassed her.
Prosecutors outlined the evidence in court yesterday and today, asking
the judge to agree that they could present it to the jury. The defence
replied that the evidence was irrelevant to the question of who murdered
Nicole Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman -- and, anyway, the
allegations are all untrue or exaggerated.
It is scarey stuff and, if true, highly prejudicial. The prosecution
produced a list of 59 specific instances of wife abuse, harassment, or
stalking. They offered an 85-page summary of the evidence, adding: ''Not
only did the defendant verbally abuse, physically abuse, degrade, and
humiliate Nicole through their relationship, but he stalked and harassed
her as well''.
''This murder took 17 years to commit,'' the report said.
In today's hearing the prosecutor said that some of the evidence they
introduced would be held over while they sought better corroboration;
for example, in the sensational story in which, it was claimed, that on
one occasion after the divoce, Mr Simpson threatened to cut off the head
of any man who dated his wife and used one of his cars.
Ronald Goldman, the other murder victim, occasionally drove a car Mr
Simpson had given Nicole. His head, and Nicole's, were almost severed by
their murderer.
The report says that Nicole Simpson's mother reports that Nicole told
her: ''I'm scared. I go to the gas station, he's there. I go to the
Payless Shoe Store, he's there. I'm driving and he's behind me.''
She kept a diary, and photographs showing bruises allegedly inflicted
by her husband, which the prosecution wants to use in the trial. There
are also letters of apology he wrote her after the police investigated
one case of wife beating in 1989. He admitted the charge.
Nicole's diary, which she kept on the advice of her lawyer, when she
first considered divorcing her husband, includes many graphic and
painful episodes. On one occasion, he beat her while they were making
love. On another, while she was pregnant, he called her ''a fat pig,
you're disgusting, get out of my house, you fat-ass liar''. He also
threatened her with a gun.
On another occasion, when she accused him of being unfaithful, he beat
her and threw her clothes out of the window of a hotel in San Francisco.
On June 7 last year, less than a week before the murders, Nicole
called a shelter for battered women to ask for help. Prosecutors want to
use a recording of that call as evidence.
The defence, however, does not concede that Mr Simpson loved Nicole
not wisely but too well, let alone that he abused her or that any
marital dispute is relevant.

HEALTH experts sailed to one of Scotland's most remote islands
yesterday to investigate the cause of an illness which closed the
primary school.
All four pupils attending the school on Fair Isle, which lies midway
between Orkney and Shetland, became unwell with suspected poisoning.
The most likely source of the illness, which left the children with
high temperatures and vomiting, was thought to be carbon monoxide
poisoning.
The school lost its chimney on Monday night after being battered by
violent storms and may have restricted ventilation for a coal-burning
stove.
However, health experts said they were keeping an open mind and had
not yet ruled out the possibility of food poisoning.
When the four pupils, aged between five and ten, all reported feeling
sick on Tuesday night, teacher Mrs Ruth Stout closed the school for the
day and called in health and safety officers.
''The children went home on Tuesday feeling perfectly well, but they
started to feel sick later that night,'' said Mrs Stout.
''They were all off school on Wednesday, but the sickness seems to
have been quite temporary as they are all fine now.
''We are looking into why they fell sick, but we are using a temporary
room and cannot use the fire until a new chimney is put up.''
Shetland environmental health officer Mr David Ogle, said two members
of his department had been sent from Lerwick to Fair Isle to investigate
the problem.
''We do not have any results from blood samples which would help us
point the finger at carbon monoxide poisoning,'' said Mr Ogle.
''Although they had headaches and sickness, they did not show any
signs of lethargy which is common for carbon monoxide poisoning.
''But if you have a defective chimney and have a coal-burning stove,
as they do, then it could be possible -- we are not ruling anything
out.''

University, Throwing Muses (4AD)
* AS an undergraduate in the Department of Febrile Alienation at
Kristin Hersh University, you will frequently find yourself wandering
across a soundscape which will sometimes appear disturbed and filled
with accusatory voices, while at other times it will be dreamy and
uplifting in an oblique sort of way. Never at any time, of course, will
you fully comprehend Professor Hersh's class in Lyrical Composition,
with its many allusions to falling, slipping or being pulled under
water. Occasionally Prof. Hersh will juxtapose everyday slices of
overheard conversation with such alarming surrealist statements as ''I
think I need a little poison'' and ''My head is filled with flowers.''
There will be arcane references to people with bright yellow guns and
bright silver grins and someone whose name may, or may not, be Crabtown
Baby Brown. But fear not: you will eventually learn an invaluable truth:
that Throwing Muses' loud, drowsy and angular angst-rock follows a
wondrous logic all its own. If they're going to match Throwing Muses,
everyone else in music-making's class of '95 has a high standard to
reach.
King Tubby's Prophesy of Dub, Yabby U (Blood and Fire)
* AND verily, we wilt glide with slow certainty through billowing
clouds of sonic righteousness, nearing the promised land with every step
we take. Or, in other words, the re-release of another splendid
collection of vintage reggae explorations. This album was first issued
in 1976, and will inspire timeless skanking.
Tusitala, Savourna Stevenson (Eclectic)
* THE original music from Stevenson's Travels, the BBC production
about the life of Robert Louis Stevenson, finds the harp-playing
Stevenson composing at her most succinct and slyly re-working some weel
kent tunes. The moods are many and varied -- from straight-ahead folk
rock to deranged ragtime, and as well as Savourna's typically tigerish
playing there are splendid contributions from, among others, fiddler Aly
Bain and Steve Kettley.
Sioda, Ishbel MacAskill (Macmeanmna)
* ONE of the top handful of contemporary Gaelic singers, Lewis's
MacAskill sings in an undemonstrative but still highly expressive style
both solo and with a hand-picked band and choir. Her unaccompanied
singing is so assured and so calm that you can almost feel your blood
pressure drop, and producer/keyboardist Blair Douglas's arrangements, as
always, skilfully bring out the best in both singer and song.

SCOTLAND's only opted-out school, Dornoch Academy, is to ask the
Secretary of State for permission to begin the process of upgrading to a
full six-year secondary.
It will be the second time the board of the two grade school has made
such an approach.
Last year it had asked permission to upgrade, within a few months of
the school becoming self-governing, in the hope that a third year could
be added almost immediately, but Mr Lang refused.
This time the board accepts the need for a more leisurely pace.
It wants to add a third year to the school in May of next year, a
fourth year in May 1997, followed by fifth and sixth forms in the two
succeeding years.
This would allow the present first year to go through the full six
years without leaving the school.

THE Rabbie Burns season is upon us. And so is the Iqbal season.
The annual Burns Iqbal Supper is being held on January 23 at the City
Chambers in Glasgow. The event is organised by the Scottish Pakistani
Association and is intended to forge cultural links between Scotland and
Pakistan.
Iqbal is the national poet of Pakistan. Like our own Bard, his works
range from tender love poems to championing the downtrodden masses.
Both poets get equal billing. Bailie John Young will deliver the
Immortal Memory to Rabbie. Dr Kabir-Ur-Rahman, formerly of Edinburgh
University, will speak on ''Iqbal, his concept of self''.
There will be a rendition of A Man's a Man for a' That followed by a
few verses from Iqbal. The cross-cultural nature of the evening is
reflectd in the menu. The Halal haggis will be served with tatties and
neeps. There is tandoori chicken to follow.
We do not know if Iqbal wrote any verses extolling the virtues of
Pakistani cuisine so we have adapted Rabbie just a wee bit:
Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware,
That jaups in luggies,
But if ye wish her gratefu' prayer,
Gie her a chapatti!
Bard on the box (BC)
STILL on the Burns theme, BBC Scotland brings the Bard back to life on
January 25 to make a personal selection from the film and TV programmes
made about his life and work.
Rabbie, who will bear an uncanny resemblance to that impish actor
Jimmy Chisholm, will be seen sorting through the archives and saying:
''I'll howk and skraik in this crowded crypt o' programmes made about
me. Aha forties, fifties, and sixties -- some early specimens from
television BC (Before Cairney).''
Pepe's prime cuts
DON PEPE'S restaurant in Puerto del Carmen, Lanzarote, makes some
interesting claims about the quality of its food.
''Come and see us, you will repeat,'' says Pepe. And, ''The food get
more attention than our clients.''
For those who are fond of children but couldn't eat a whole one, Pepe
says: ''We do babies portions.''
Jambo's big heart
AN aprocryphal tale, perhaps, about a Hearts supporter who took his
wife along to a match at Tynecastle. She is keen but not well-versed in
football matters.
The Jambos are losing 3-1 with two minutes to go. She leaps to her
feet and shouts: ''Come on, Hearts, give us an equaliser.''
The embarrassed husband digs her in the ribs and points out where she
has got it wrong. The wife gets to her feet again and shouts: ''Come on,
Hearts, give us two equalisers!''
Hamming it up
AN exhibition by Glasgow-based artist Stephen Skrynka, which opens in
the city's Intermedia Gallery in Virginia Street tomorrow, reminds the
Diary of a story so old that it dates back to the days when farmers
smoked their own bacon by hanging it up above the fireplace.
So there's this chap standing in his parlour with his back to a
roaring fire. A visitor, spotting a juicy ham joint suspended above the
hearth, asks him: ''Is that your Ayrshire bacon?'' To which he replies
''No. I'm just warming my hands.''
Mr Skrynka's show is called La Festa Del Maiale which, translated from
the Italian, means Celebration of the Pig. And it would put you aff ham
sandwiches for life. This is because it was based on a home video, shot
by the artist's Uncle Carlo, of pigs getting ritually slaughtered in an
Italian village.
The exhibition also includes a six-foot-high wall of fruit jelly, made
from animal bones and encased in glass. Would this not give the animal
rights brigade cause for concern?
Apparently not because the jelly has been ''processed and refined
beyond all semantic recognition of its original matrix''. Does this mean
the fatty bits have been cut off?

THE Prison Governors' Association is to seek legal advice on the
''validity'' of the Prison Service's decision to remove Parkhurst chief
Mr John Marriott from his post.
Legal advisers have been asked to consider whether there had been
''serious flaws in the interpretation of Civil Service rules and the
interpretation of natural justice'', the PGA said in a statement.
Mr Marriott was relieved of his duties on Tuesday pending a full
inquiry into the Parkhurst escape, when three dangerous prisoners spent
five days on the run until they were recaptured on the Isle of Wight on
Sunday.
But Home Secretary Michael Howard gave the impression that Mr Marriott
had been told he would never again control a prison -- causing anger
among other prison governors, who said Mr Marriott was being made a
scapegoat.
The PGA statement followed a meeting of its national executive
committee near Rugby, Warwickshire. It said: ''In the circumstances, the
validity of these actions should be tested and we are today instructing
our legal advisers to prepare appropriate papers.''
Prison governors all over the country had expressed ''great anger''
over the treatment of Mr Marriott and other staff at the Isle of Wight
jail, said a spokeswoman.
If the legal advice was that Mr Marriott was wrongly removed from his
post, the PGA would then have to consider its next move.
The spokeswoman refused to comment on whether the PGA would take the
matter to a tribunal but said: ''We have to check if there is any
redress in law and, if there is, we will certainly consider acting upon
it.''
Earlier, Prison Service director-general Mr Derek Lewis denied he was
at odds with Mr Howard over the issue. ''There is absolutely no
disagreement between me and the Home Secretary on this,'' he said.
''There is no decision at all as to what may happen to Mr Marriott
after the various investigations have been completed. That will depend
entirely on the outcome of those investigations and that is entirely
consistent with what the Home Secretary said to the House on Tuesday.''

Julia Langdon focuses on the misgivings of London's chattering classes
AT THE height of the fevered political debate on elected assemblies
for Scotland and Wales in the course of the 1970s, a seasoned political
broadcaster at Westminster once shook his head in despair. ''Every time
I hear the word 'devolution','' he said wearily, ''I reach for my
devolver.'' He was, of course, English. But nearly 20 years on, the
appetite for the subject of devolution south of the Border has not
become noticeably more enthusiastic.
It is not a matter of political debate or controversy in either
England or Wales. It is not something you ever hear discussed in The
Bull's Head. Or anywhere. Frankly, it has little interest to anyone
outside the circles of either national politics or local government --
and it is not of great moment to them.
The fact that the Prime Minister decided to pick up on the issue in
the course of his BBC radio interview at the turn of the year was quite
clearly a deliberate political ploy. It has the exceptional virtue of
being something on which there is a distinct policy difference between
the Government and those who would seek to replace it.
The changes that are being wrought in ''New Labour'' are making such
profound differences rather more tricky to spot these days. Yet it is
obviously vital, when there is a widespread public belief that almost
everything the Government does could be performed better by the Labour
Party, that the Prime Minister should to try to isolate an exception.
For this reason, he picked on the subject of devolution. It was
dutifully reported at the time and attracted passing comment in the
London newspapers, but it was still perfectly obvious that John Major
was attempting to divert political attention from the many manifest
problems with which his administration remains beset.
And when one is the unpopular leader of a party of Government, which
is in a technical minority in the House of Commons, with the Labour
Opposition lying back and enjoying a historic 39-point lead in the
opinion polls, it is rather vital to be seen to do something.
The words he used, however, were the giveaway. By attacking the Labour
Party's plans for setting up an elected tax-raising assembly within the
first year of taking office as ''one of the most dangerous propositions
ever put to the British nation'' and as the probable cause of ''immense
damage to the people of Scotland'' and everyone else in the United
Kingdom, he demonstrated a startling lack of comprehension of public
opinion either side of the Scottish border. The words themselves were
intemperate, off the appropriate scale, and the thinking which prompted
them seemed inaccurate, if not wrong.
There is no widespread feeling about the issue -- except, of course,
among Scottish MPs -- at Westminster at all. Inasmuch as any English or
Welsh Members of either of the two major parties had paid any attention
to the re-emergence of devolution, it was merely to wonder vaguely if Mr
Major's tactic was an appropriate one. While it may not actually damage
the Conservative cause any further in Scotland -- there being little
more damage that could, after all, be inflicted upon the remaining rump
of Tory support -- there is nevertheless the possibility that the
question of regional power throughout the rest of the kingdom might
become a more active political question.
A point repeatedly made by the Labour Party in defence of its case for
devolving power to the English regions and to Wales -- and, ideally, to
Northern Ireland -- is that this country has become one in which an
increasing degree of power is held centrally. The Shadow Chancellor,
Gordon Brown, referred yesterday to Britain as one of the countries of
Europe with the lowest levels of regional government.
The changes that have been brought about by the policy of the present
Government, reducing the role of Whitehall while creating an entire new
bureaucracy of quangos, bear out this point. A new book published this
week, The Times Guide to the New British State: The Government Machine
in the 1990s, certainly underlines it.
There is also some evidence that there is a growing public sense of
distance from decision-taking -- and that could, in time, lead to a
genuine popular demand for bringing power closer to the people. The very
fact that the same party has been in office now for nearly 16 years will
enhance that, too -- if the citizen's one chance to try to influence the
choice of government with a single vote every four years repeatedly
produces the same result over such a long period of time, it could bring
pressure for a change in the system, for more votes, for more regional
government.
The Labour Party recognised that some years ago. In an earlier attempt
to address the question of regional government, John Prescott, now the
party's deputy leader, developed a thorough examination of the
possibilities for elected regional bodies which is likely to form the
basis for the latest version from Jack Straw. The Tories should be
thinking about this, as well. They will be proved horribly wrong if they
interpret the current lack of interest in devolution in England and
Wales as a sign of public satisfaction with the way things work at
present. That is far from the case and the traditional Tory voter is as
uneasy about the present state of affairs as any other.
There is an additional factor which is relevant here and that is the
further change that can be expected in the nature of the British state
as the progress towards a more federal Europe continues. Whatever may
happen in the short term, for example the progress of the current
domestic dispute about Britain's approach to the next Inter-Governmental
Conference, Maastricht 2, there is a relentless movement towards great
federalism. It is already the case that individual authorities and areas
of the United Kingdom are dealing directly with Brussels, sometimes
appealing directly to the European authorities for help from the various
funds that are available. That is something which seems highly likely to
continue and will also have a considerable impact upon pressure for a
form of more powerful local government which recognises the regional
identity of an area.
There are many questions yet to be answered about the way in which
devolved government can work in Scotland without causing too much
southern discomfort. The most frequently aired in London is the famed
''West Lothian'' anomaly, so vociferously aired by Tam Dalyell in the
1970s. But some form of regional government throughout the whole of the
kingdom might serve to answer that very question. There will be much
angry debate before any of this is satisfactorily resolved. That debate
might now be about to start. John Major may regret he ever mentioned it.

Trencherman feasts on a social history of ice.
THERE was life before Captain Bird's Eye, and next time you glance in
the frozen meat compartments of your local supermarket it may be worth
remembering Scotland's singular contribution to a method of transport
and distribution which did much to open up international routes,
bringing foodstuffs to Europe from, quite literally, the other side of
the world.
Those deep-frozen joints of New Zealand and Australian lamb are
actually nothing new. In 1880 and then again in 1882 these countries
sent their first cargoes of frozen lamb and mutton to Britain in sailing
ships which had been installed with Bell-Coleman freezing apparatus in
Glasgow. While, around 1898, The SS Perthshire made a few voyages
importing shelled and frozen blocks of New Zealand oysters. This was the
year in which the Provost of Aberdeen observed that the use of ice to
transport fish in fresh condition was only in its infancy.
This is the late Elizabeth David's last book, lovingly edited by her
literary executor, Jill Norman. In fact, it is more a series of
exhaustively researched essays on the role of ice and snow in the
development of civilisation, started as far back as the mid-seventies
shortly after the publication of Ms David's English Bread and Yeast
Cookery. She was still working on the research right up to her death in
1992.
The wonderfully evocative, even poetic, title of the book follows in
the wake of a corpus of work on food and food related subjects which
made Elizabeth David the most important culinary author this century --
the more important and startling since she was writing from an island
bastion little noted for its interest in matters of the kitchen.
Harvest of the Cold Months* is not, however, a cookery book in any
sense but rather a social history of ice, a product which has been
crucial to world progress for longer than many of us may imagine. The
ancient references are all here, beginning in Biblical times with the
passage in Proverbs recording the value placed on the preserving of
snow: ''As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his
masters.''
The Chinese, in the Shih Ching, recorded the harvest and storage of
ice. That was 1100BC. Thirty-one centuries later the Americans, already
in the grip of hygiene mania, were having none of the ancient Chinese
ways and had set up China's only mechanical ice-making machine in the
grounds of the American Legation in Peking.
It was, however, the astute observance of the Chinese use of ice by a
Scot which did much to herald the commercial use of freezing techniques
in the food industry as early as 1785. Alexander Dalrymple, of the
British East India Company and later hydrographer to the Admiralty,
introduced the MP and fellow Scot George Dempster to the Chinese habit
of preserving fish in ice.
Dempster communicated the idea to his salmon dealer who, against his
own better judgment, boxed some fresh salmon in ice and dispatched them
to London by sea. From luxury salmon the idea was soon transferred to
common herring. The modern salt-free Scottish fishing industry was
founded. Dempster took the credit; his adviser, Dalrymple, was largely
forgotten, though not by Elizabeth David.
And this is just to nibble at the Scottish element of a volume in
which the author has taken on a seemingly mundane though historically
significant subject to produce a work of classic erudition.
Sadly, the author's demise means we do not learn of her researches
into the Scottish-Italian cornet world, researches which would surely
have taken place given Ms David's reputation for surveying her subject
in depth.
But the range is simply tremendous. And as the author comments:
''Billingsgate-bound cargoes of fish packed in ice are not as romantic
as argosies of sherbets and sugar, snow and fruit, carried on camel-back
through the Holy Land to crusading warriors, or seaborne with attendant
confectioners in papal galleons across the Mediterranean to attend a
royal wedding in Marseille -- but in its way the China to Scotland
story, although fully substantiated, is every bit as unlikely.''

COMPARISONS are odious, I know, but poor old (young) Jacek Kaspszyk
was on a hiding to nothing last night at the Royal SNO's first
contribution to the collaborative series of concerts in Perth which is
featuring all the Scottish orchestras.
This show was set to be one of the great concerts of the season,
featuring a reunion of the incomparable partnership of chief conductor
Walter Weller and pianist John Lill, with the repertoire for the entire
programme a stream of masterpieces drawn from the main artery of
Weller's specialism.
Almost anyone substituting for an absent Weller was drawing a short
straw. To be fair, the music makes the concert still worth hearing.
(Same show tonight in Edinburgh and Glasgow on Saturday.) And John Lill,
when he takes charge of Kaspszyk's rather lumbering and four-square
interpretation of Brahms's First Piano Concerto, galvanises the music
with his sense of pace, direction, and clarity of structure.
And the second-half performances of the Prelude and Liebestod to
Wagner's Tristan, along with Richard Strauss's Death and
Transfiguration, while the antithesis of what we might have heard from
Weller, did feature some very fine playing.
Kaspszyk's way with both pieces is straightforward, short on heat and
languour, and distinctly unsentimental. Leave the tissues at home. (Hot
from the press: Weller's not coming next week either.)

<HEADLINE>Conservation assurances as prime Highland area becomes part of Lego land.  Danish family buys 60,000 acre estate</HEADLINE>

THE family which runs the giant Lego corporation in Denmark was
yesterday named as the new owner of a prime estate in the Highlands.
Mr Kjeld Kirk Christiansen, chairman of the Lego group, arranged the
private purchase of the 60,000-acre Strathconon Estate after a visit to
Scotland last year.
A group spokesman said yesterday that the acquisition combined a
business investment with the wish of family members to own land in
Scotland, which they regarded as a ''beautiful'' country.
No financial details of the purchase are being made public, but it is
thought that the price will have been well in excess of #1m.
The official buyer is Kirkbi A/S, a holding company which is wholly
owned by the Christiansen family, including the chairman, his father,
Gottfred, his wife, Camilla, and their three children.
They were outbid last year in attempting to take over the Glenfeshie
estate in the Cairngorms, but have now succeeded in buying land in
Scotland, in their first purchase outwith Denmark.
Strathconon Estate, which lies about 30 miles west of Inverness and is
regarded as one of the most scenic in the Highlands, was previously
owned by the Macdonald-Buchanan family.
It is understood to have been sold by Mr Hugh Macdonald-Buchanan, who
recently took control of the estate from his father, James. The family
could not be contacted yesterday and estate staff declined to comment.
The Lego spokesman said: ''Kirkbi's primary objective is to continue
management of the estate's forestry, stalking and fishing activities on
a conservationist basis, and in a way which supports the social and
economic wellbeing of the local community.''
He said that the five existing staff were being kept on, and tenancies
would not be affected. There are 20 houses in Strathconon and a working
farm.
The estate, which boasts several Munros and 4000 acres of forest,
contains two sites of special scientific interest.
Kirkbi has already had preliminary discussions with officials of
Scottish Natural Heritage, and said it intended to manage the estate in
line with the agency's philosophy on the care and preservation of the
natural environment.
A SNH spokesman in Inverness said: ''We are optimistic, because the
family seems keen to run things with the best interests of the
environment at heart.''
Captain Roderick Stirling, whose Ross and Cromarty district council
ward includes the estate, said: ''I think everybody is a little bit sad
to see the Macdonald-Buchanans going.
''Most people would probably have preferred to see a British buyer,
but we welcome the new owners, because of their interest in the
countryside and environment matters, and wish them well.''

<HEADLINE>Surgeon in nurse operation probe takes paid leave 'Experienced' hospital theatre sister suspended</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A SURGEON at the centre of an investigation into claims that a nurse
removed a hospital patient's appendix during an operation has agreed to
take paid leave, it was disclosed last night.
The claim that a Treliske Hospital sister performed the operation two
weeks ago is being investigated by the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust.
Theatre sister Valerie Tomlinson has worked at the Truro hospital for
more than 10 years and has been suspended.
The surgeon, locum registrar Dr Tahir Bhatti, who was in the operating
theatre the entire time and supervised the procedure, was not suspended.
Earlier yesterday, trust chief executive Brian Milstead said Dr
Bhatti, employed by the South West Regional Health Authority, had
continued to work at the hospital.
But in a later statement, he said that, in the present circumstances
and because of the difficulties involved in Dr Bhatti carrying out his
present duties at Treliske Hospital, the trust had agreed with him and
the health authority that he took paid leave of absence until the
inquiry is complete.
Mr Milstead also said the patient seemed quite happy with his
treatment.
Nine days after the operation the patient, who has not been named and
who is progressing well, was visited by the trust's medical director
Michael Boyce and told what had happened.
''He has not made an official complaint and seems quite happy with his
treatment,'' Mr Milstead told a news conference yesterday.
He wanted to assure patients that this was a highly unusual event.
''It is a one off,'' he said.
But from the evidence gathered, he added, there was a case to be
answered, and a disciplinary panel could sit within the next week. If
the allegations were proved, it meant someone had decided to break
well-proven guidelines and protocols.
''Because they are so well established, there could have been no
misunderstanding in the theatre about the roles of people,'' Mr Milstead
said.
Sister Tomlinson was described as a very experienced and senior
theatre nurse. She was not at her home near St Columb, north Cornwall,
yesterday.
Unions are demanding a public inquiry into the incident. Royal College
of Nursing general secretary Christine Hancock said yesterday that had
never heard of a similar incident, and it was clearly unacceptable
except, perhaps, in the most unusual circumstances.
Geoff Poxon of Cornwall Community Health Council said: ''If a nurse
has done this, it is quite appalling and a breach of every code that
exists.''
He was certain such an incident had not happened before, but said it
would ''cast a shadow over every operating theatre in the country''.
A spokeswoman for the Royal College of Nursing in London said that
there was no need for concern among hospital patients.
''We would not want patients around the country to get the idea there
were have-a-go nurses going round trying out operations,'' she said.

RARELY has a band come on stage to such a lukewarm reception as the
Khartoum Heroes did last night, but it gives some indication of their
crowd-pleasing ability that the dance floor was well populated after
just two songs.
For this is one of the few bands to whom the term eclectic can be
genuinely applied. The band's joint frontmen, Vic and Kenny Anderson,
look like they may have just come from a punk picnic, the rhythm section
look more like they've been at an end-of-term ball, while banjo player
Een Anderson has the haircut of Joey Ramone and the flares of Joe Tex.
Musically the diversity produces numerous contradictions such as the
spectacle of the bekilted and over-forties alike being engaged by a band
for whom the Clash are a major influence. Maybe all Celtic rock would
sound this way if they had only played the Buzzcocks rather than Gentle
Giant at Runrig's Sunday school discos.
At their most frantic they are a less agitated Nyah Fearties, on more
sensitive songs like Moon Barking, the musical territory covered is
somewhere between Stealer's Wheel and late-eighties Waterboys. However,
St Swithins and Heaven show that they are more than the sum of their
varied influences and on the verge of establishing a more distinctive
sound of their own.
The musicianship on offer is what elevates them above Celtic punk
thrash, although their vocals, often mumbled and low in the mix, rarely
make the impression they should.
Nevertheless, Khartoum Heroes have made massive advances since their
days as the Skubhe Dhu Orchestra. Though hardly earth-shattering they
maintain a uniqueness onstage that makes them a much more entertaining
live act than their patchy recorded outputs would suggest.

WITH Nigel Osborne as its filling, the SCO's Beethoven sandwich last
night tasted mostly as fresh as it looked. Some of its success derived
from Guido Ajmone-Marsan's conducting, some from Ursula Smith's cello
playing, and a large amount from Osborne's Bachian jeu d'esprit,
cheekily entitled The Art of Fugue.
In effect a semi-concerto for cello and orchestra, its five linked
sections were also a species of palindrome, a study in musical
ambiguity, and a deliberate tease.
In a spoken introduction as succinct as the work itself, Osborne said
he started by asking himself what Bach might do if he were still alive,
and wrote down what came to mind. Delicate, rustling, fluttering,
whirling, clashing, and questioning, it did not always sound specially
Bachian, but it possessed an entirely appropriate spirit of invention
and, in its prelude and postlude for solo cello, a splendid neo-baroque
eloquence.
As in other recent Osborne works, there was also a picturesque quality
about the writing, hints of sad romantic imagery, as if this were music
in search of a film. Ursula Smith's beautiful slow fade at the end
heightened the impression.
The performance, second of three in Scotland this week, marked the
work's first appearance since the SCO premiered it in Potsdam last year.
Ajmone-Marsan, an Italian conductor substituting for the indisposed
Jukka-Pekka Saraste, directed it admirably, and went on to produce a
racy, risky account of Beethoven's seventh symphony, blowing away the
stodgy Weingartner arrangement of the Grosse Fuge which, led by James
Clark, had opened the programme.

AROUND 50 people marched through Fort William yesterday in support of
Lochaber District Council's suspended chief executive, Mr David Blair,
on the second day of the disciplinary hearing against him.
The marchers, carrying placards demanding Mr Blair's reinstatement,
began at the police station and ended outside the council offices where
the hearing was taking place. Mr Blair arrived to cheers but would make
no comment.
The decision to suspend Mr Blair followed a report by the council's
internal auditors. This did not find any financial irregularity but the
move has split the council and seven of its 15 members remain opposed to
it.
One of those taking part in yesterday's march, Sir Donald Cameron of
Lochiel, the chief of Clan Cameron and a former lord lieutenant of
Inverness-shire, said: ''I am here because I have always been a great
supporter and admirer of David Blair. I think he has done a great job
for the community. I don't think he deserves this. He deserves justice
and I don't think he is getting that. There should be some kind of
independent inquiry.''
Mrs Anne Dye, who travelled 40 miles from Acharacle to join the march,
said: ''We feel that David Blair has been very badly treated by the
council. He is being judged by the very people who made the accusations
against him which seems completely undemocratic and unfair.
''We know David Blair and he is as straight as a die. He has worked
hard for the whole area for the past 14 years.''
However, council chairman Mr Neil Clark said: ''There are at very most
50 people out there from a population of 20,000. I would say that
demonstrates the depth of support for the action we have taken. This is
just the latest in a long line of politicial stunts by some of the
councillors who opposed us.''

YOU'D never know John Martyn had made at least one great album,
Cooltide, in the 1990s. It was seven songs into his set before he
acknowledged its existence with a belting Jack the Lad. But then it had
been five songs in before he played a song in something resembling its
original form.
This is why there are no such things as Martyn covers bands and it's
what makes Martyn an intriguing performer while being anything but a
rare one. How could a covers band determine the definitive version of a
song when its originator is forever reinventing it?
Sometimes it's worth going to hear him just to see whether Big Muff
can possibly get any bigger (seems unlikely after its storming opening
here) or Couldn't Love You More any slower without stopping altogether.
These and most of the songs Martyn brings with him these days come
from his golden period in the late 1970s. Or maybe that should be
Plasticine period because, three songs in, came Stealin' In, once a
sweet, hazy, jazzy little number, now given an air of gruff mystery, its
lyrics rattled through by a voice and attitude that would have done
justice to Tom Waits reading from Edward Gorey.
What must make life particularly interesting for his band is the fact
that the arrangements attempted often seem to be decided in the count
in. Hell, even the set list seems to be decided during the count in.
If his boys were in any way confused by all this, they hid it well,
playing with style and confidence and giving as much -- or as little --
support as the constantly changing mood required.

<HEADLINE>Scot was ideal dupe for IRA, says lawyer</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A SCOTSMAN accused of plotting an IRA bombing campaign was really an
innocent dupe, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday.
Hugh Jack's easy-going manner and willingness to help others led him
to unwittingly harbour a bomber in his own home, said defence counsel Mr
Michael Mansfield, QC.
He added that Mr Jack's meticulous timekeeping made him an ideal
target for the IRA.
The jury had been told that Mr Jack, together with Robert ''Rab'
Fryers, plotted a bombing campaign on behalf of the IRA while Mr Fryers
was staying at Mr Jack's flat in Sauchie, near Alloa, in 1993.
The Crown's case is that both men were involved in the conspiracy, and
that Mr Fryers could not have been acting without Mr Jack's knowledge.
But Mr Mansfield disputed this in his closing speech. ''The IRA, like
any other organisation such as the MI5 or the police, operate very much
on a need-to-know basis.
''The Crown has used this on behalf of the security services during
this case. We say the same applies to Jack.''
The jury had been told Mr Fryers was first introduced to Mr Jack in
spring, 1993, while Mr Jack's mother, an Irish Catholic, was dying of
lung cancer.
The two men met a couple of times before Mr Fryers came to stay at Mr
Jack's flat on June 26 that year.
Mr Mansfield suggested to the jury that Mr Fryers, who was arrested on
July 14, 1993, with a 2.5kg bomb in his bag, was already involved in a
bomb conspiracy.
He claimed that, at the time, Mr Fryers could well have been looking
for a new place to stay because of tight security in London. Mr Jack,
suggested Mr Mansfield, was perfect. He had a set work pattern to which
he stuck ''like clockwork'', and another place to stay, at his
girlfriend's.
Counsel went on to describe how one person could easily run a ''bomb
factory'' -- the devices and component parts were very small.
Mr Fryers, 44, of Ballymurphy, West Belfast, and Mr Jack, 37, deny
conspiring to cause explosions.
The trial continues.

Moscow, Thursday
RUSSIA dismissed mounting Western criticism of its assault on Chechnya
as inadequate Cold War rhetoric and, as if to prove the point, pummelled
Grozny today with its heaviest artillery bombardment yet.
As civilians in the sodden Chechen capital cowered in cellars to
escape the shelling and rebel fighters braced for a fresh Russian
attempt to take the city, the European Union said it would complain to
Moscow about its broken promises to keep a ceasefire and start new talks
on Chechnya's future.
''The fighting has continued and there is no dialogue,'' said French
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, speaking for the EU.
Germany, Moscow's biggest Western trade partner, said the Kremlin
deserved ''massive criticism'' for taking a sledgehammer to Chechnya.
Russia, however, scathingly dismissed Western verbal assaults, and the
battle for Grozny ground on. Artillery shells whined overhead and the
whoosh of rockets launcher filled the air.
''We cannot fail to notice the inadequate and hasty reaction of a
string of political activists and organisations,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Grigory Karasin told a news briefing. ''We note with sorrow
rhetoric calling to mind the recent very sad past of our relationship
with the West.''
Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent the troops in on December 11 to
quell Chechnya's three-year flirtation with independence. However the
supposed object lesson for other Muslim republics in the giant Russian
Federation has gone badly wrong.
Five weeks into the campaign, Yeltsin is saddled with a military
disaster in Grozny and a political firestorm in Moscow and around the
world.
Western governments have been careful to note that Chechnya is an
internal Russian affair and even the 53-state Organisation for Security
and Co-operation in Europe said today it was effectively powerless to
end the fighting.
the OSCE's special envoy to Moscow, Istvan Gyarmati of Hungary, told a
news conference in Vienna: ''I don't think the role of international
organisations is to jump into the middle of wars and by their physical
presence broker a ceasefire.
''No international organisation, including the OSCE, has the means to
enforce an end to hostilities.''
Yet political impotence has not stopped the West growing more critical
of the methods Moscow is using and about human rights violations.
Disquiet in the Russian military has also grown. A marines commander
in Russia's Far East said he had refused to send a battalion to
Chechnya.
More ominously, Deputy Defence Minister Boris Gromov launched his
fiercest attack yet on the bungled campaign, which seems likely to
result in serious military reforms.
''The use of barbaric military methods is the sign of an uncivilised
army,'' he told Moscow News, adding that the Government was lying about
the war, which had killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of people and
devastated Grozny.
In Geneva, relief officials said a United Nations emergency team had
reached Russia's southern rim, where Chechnya is located and where the
number of displaced people from the conflict has risen to 400,000. The
UN High Commissioner for Refugees said it hoped to begin flying in food
and medical supplies by the weekend.--Reuter.

RUSSIAN first deputy premier Oleg Soskovets today denied a newspaper
report that a drinking binge with Defence Minister Pavel Grachev
resulted in a disastrous army attempt to take the Chechen capital
Grozny.
The authoritative Izvestia newspaper said Soskovets had flown to
military headquarters in the town of Mozdok with an unnamed general to
spend New Year's Eve with Grachev, whose birthday is on New Year's Day.
The paper, quoting an unspecified military source, claimed the three
men had drunk heavily during celebrations.
The front-line units were then told that ''whoever took the
presidential palace would receive three Hero of Russia awards'', said
Izvestia, referring to the abortive New Year's Day storming of Grozny.
''The New Year battles followed. Many people died, both Russian and
Chechen, but the palace was not taken.''
Izvestia said the account helped clear up a ''mystery'' behind the
tank-led attack, which the Chechens repulsed with heavy losses.
However Soskovets, quoted by Itar-Tass news agency, insisted that he
had spent all of last month in Moscow and said it was ''total nonsense''
to allege that he had flown to Mozdok on New Year's Eve.
In another development, a Russian MP, Pavel Shtein, quoted official
sources as saying 394 servicemen had died and more than 1000 had been
injured since Russia sent troops into Chechnya on December 11.--Reuter.

Manila, Thursday
ONE million cheering Filipinos greeted the Pope today as he began a
four-nation tour with an emotional trip through the streets of Manila.
''For a long time I have looked forward to stepping on to Philippine
soil once more,'' the Pope said after landing at Manila airport.
The Pope will also take part in the 10th World Youth Day celebrations,
conducting an open-air mass in a Manila park on Sunday before an
expected congregation of more than one million.
The Philippines, 85% of whose 65 million people are Roman Catholic, is
the Pope's first stop an 11-day tour that will also take him to Papua
New Guinea, Australia, and Sri Lanka.
Journalists on the tour said the 74-year-old pontiff appeared much
more frail than during his first visit to Manila in 1981.
He walked haltingly down the steps of his plane and was handed a cane
when he reached the ground. He appeared somewhat unsure of his footing
at times and he did not kneel to kiss the ground, although that is
usually reserved for his first visit to a country.
The trip, the Pope's sixty-third outside Italy, is his first big tour
since a bone replacement operation after he broke his right leg last
year.
His apparent frailty did not stop him smiling and shaking hands with a
group of schoolgirls performing a traditional Filipino dance.
After being greeted by President Fidel Ramos, the first Protestant
leader of the Philippines, he boarded a bullet-proof Popemobile for the
trip into central Manila.
The journey ran behind schedule because of the dense crush of people
who at times broke through lines of security men to surround the
Popemobile.
Extra police were on duty and military helicopters hovered overhead in
the tightest security the Philippine capital has seen.
Police swooped in on one man in the crowd carrying a handgun but there
was no indication he presented any threat. Firearms are widely available
in the Philippines.
Ramos said on Wednesday that two people had been arrested as security
threats but there were no further details.
Tonight, a massive crowd outside the Vatican envoy's residence, where
the Pope is staying, set up a chant of ''Pope John Paul Two, We Love
You'' until the pontiff appeared on a balcony to bless them.
He addressed them briefly but his remarks were drowned out by ecstatic
applause.
ROME: A senior member of China's state-controlled Roman Catholic
church said today that its decision to send a delegation to Manila for
the Pope's visit signalled warming relations with the Vatican.
''It is certainly a great sign for all of us who are praying for the
renewal of relations between the Holy See and China,'' said Shanghai's
Bishop Aloysius Jin Luxian in an interview with an Italian religious
magazine. ''It is an important sign because it was a decision taken on
both sides.''
China broke ties with the Holy See in 1957 because of its links to
Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province.--Reuter.

THE dog track that last weekend hosted Britain's first official Sunday
meeting no longer has contracted greyhound trainers.
The latest development increases the uncertainty over the future of
Edinburgh's Powderhall Stadium, which is at the centre of a #1.8m
financial wrangle involving its owner and a leisure group.
The 12-strong trainers' group recently passed a vote of no confidence
in owner Mr Eddie Ramsay, and gave him a week's notice they were
withdrawing their dogs.
That notice ran out yesterday and last night one woman trainer, who
said that the 90-odd members of the track's owners' association were
backing their move, warned she and her colleagues would not be
returning.
Owners and trainers claim that Mr Ramsay has told them publicly that
he cannot make a success of the track, it is going to close and he will
be developing it.
They maintain there are others prepared to take over the track and
keep it as a greyhound stadium.
''Even if he does retain the track and does a deal I can assure him
the trainers will not go back,'' said Midlothian-based Jane Glass, a
member of the owners' association.
She said that despite the threat of severe hardship for people
involved, the association was standing by the trainers' decision.
Owners were prepared to keep their dogs in the kennels, although that
could not last long term because livings had to be earned.
Yesterday, despite the confrontation, Mr Ramsay was predicting a
''happy ending'' to the dispute with former Powderhall owners, Coral --
now Bass Leisure.
As he made arrangements to advertise for replacements for the trainers
who he has accused of ''mutiny'' and interference in his financial
affairs, Mr Ramsay revealed he had made a final offer to Bass Leisure at
a London meeting on Wednesday.
Mr Ramsay, who made his name in bookmaking, would not reveal the
extent of his ''one-off'' offer.
There has been speculation for some time about the future of the
stadium, because of the wrangle over debts Bass Leisure claims Mr Ramsay
owes them.
Mr Ramsay, who has suspended racing until further notice, said he
would not be dictated to by the trainers.
A spokesman for Bass Leisure said last night that ''offers'' were
discussed at the meeting, but he said he could not comment any further
until the company talked over the situation. An announcement is expected
to be made next week.

<TEXT>
A HEALTH board has launched an inquiry after a complaint that a
trainee GP told a cancer victim that his illness was all in his mind.
It was later discovered that bricklayer Peter Taylor had a tumour so
big it had almost engulfed his right lung.
Mr Taylor, 54, of Newpark Road, Stirling, was finally confirmed as
having cancer by doctors at Stirling Royal Infirmary last July, after he
staggered in agony into the casualty department. He died three weeks
later.
A post mortem examination confirmed the huge tumour and a string of
secondary tumours that riddled his body.
His widow, Mrs Helen Taylor, 51, said yesterday that her husband made
repeated visits to a health centre in Stirling between falling ill last
May and his death in August.
He was prescribed antibiotics, sent for an endoscopy internal
examination at Stirling Royal Infimary which proved negative, and
finally handed over to a trainee GP at the health centre.
Mrs Taylor said the trainee doctor, who has since moved on, prescribed
paracetamol and Prozac, telling him his problems were stress related.
She finally went with her husband to see the trainee GP last July.
''I said to the doctor 'do you think that Peter could please have an
X-ray?'
''The doctor turned and he looked at me and he looked at Peter and he
said: 'Well, we don't want to go down that road, X-rays, tubes, needles,
tests etc, because I really am convinced this is all in your mind . . .
I am sending a letter off this afternoon for an appointment for you to
see a psychologist'.''
Three days later, Mr Taylor was in so much pain he could not walk to a
corner shop near his home. He went to the casualty department where
doctors drew two and a half pints of fluid off his affected lung. Two
days later cancer was confirmed.
A spokeswoman for Forth Valley Health Board yesterday refused to name
the trainee GP, but said Mrs Taylor's complaint was being investigated.
Written statements collected by the board's primary care manager, Mr
Duncan Harris, will be referred to a Medical Service Committee. If the
committee chairman, Mr Colin Stroyan, considers there is a prima facie
breach of a doctor's terms of service, there will be a hearing with both
parties present.
The spokeswoman said the procedure could take ''several months'',
after which there was a right of appeal to the Secretary of State.

A SECURITY guard employed at Conservative Central Office had served 15

Mr Ian McCartney (Makerfield) was speaking against a background of
calls for new laws to license security firms and allow checks on
criminal records.
He said: ''It is extraordinary just before Christmas that Conservative
Central Office recruited, through their own security company, Bob King
who had just served 15 years for armed robbery.''
The MP added: ''If that happens at Central Office, it proves the

A BACKLOG of applications from students seeking to renew government
loans to help meet their living costs will be cleared next week, student
leaders were told yesterday.
Student activists from 10 representative British universities met
officials of the Student Loans Company in Glasgow to discuss delays in
processing loans for existing borrowers.
They were told that the backlog had been reduced from 35,000 students
before Christmas to 4000 now, and would be cleared next week.
It occurred because the company introduced an inflexible system for
processing loans from existing student borrowers. Some students suffered
deprivation because of delays of more than three months in rectifying
errors.
The company's system for dealing with inquiries was also unable to
cope with the volume of calls and letters from anxious students.
The student leaders also asked yesterday for the installation of a
''freefone'' telephone line to deal with inquiries. The company said it
would cost the proposal, but added that it would require Department of
Education approval.
The President of Edinburgh University Students' Association, Mr
Stephen Magee, said after yesterday's meeting: ''I very much hope that
the backlog is about to be cleared but I am sceptical about the
company's claims.
''If students are still reporting at the end of next week that they
have not received their loans we will come right back to the company.''

LEGAL moves aimed at halting the Government's rail privatisation
programme will open in the High Court next month when the Rail,
Maritime, and Transport Workers' Union seeks leave to apply for a
judicial review.
If successful, the preliminary hearing on February 24 should open the
way for a full hearing into the proposed privatisation of Railtrack
which operates track and stations.
If the full hearing finds in the union's favour, rail privatisation,
due to be completed by the next General Election, could be derailed
completely.

TWO councillors have lost their appeals against rejection as possible
Labour candidates for election to the new one-tier Glasgow council.
A third, Mr John Ross, has been reinstated after an ''administrative
error'' was cleared up.
Mr Ross, Mr Anthony McCartney and Mr John Gaffney, one of the
council's most senior members, had appealed to Labour's Scottish
executive against their exclusion from the panel of candidates.
Party sources would not disclose the reasons for the decisions, which
were communicated to the councillors by letter.
However, Mr McCartney was in no doubt it was his conviction and #75
fine for assault in November 1993 that had destroyed his chances.
He said last night: ''We're now more than a year down the road from
that conviction.
''I think if action had to be taken against me, it should have been
taken much earlier.
''I think I have been the victim of a vendetta. I'm told the party
executive's decision is final, but I shall be exploring other avenues of
appeal through the party mechanism.''
Mr Gaffney was not available for comment last night.
The ''administrative error'' involving Mr Ross was understood to
involve the absence of a current Labour Party membership card.
Meanwhile, three Edinburgh District Council Labour rebels returned to
the party fold yesterday when they won their appeals against rejection
as possible candidates.
They were among eight Labour members who last year defied the group
Whip and supported a Tory motion of no confidence in the then chief
executive Mr Paul Lowenberg.
Mr David Brown, Mr Derick Wilson, and Mr Billy Fitzpatrick were
rejected as possible candidates by a selection panel last month.
They appealed to Labour's Scottish executive and, after presenting
their cases at a hearing in the city this week, heard yesterday they
would be allowed to join the pool of candidates for 58 seats on the new
unitary authority.

The cause was being investigated last night.
The fire broke out at Moss Motorcycles in St Catherines Road, Perth,
before spreading to workshops, offices, and retail units in adjoining
Highland House.
Fifty firefighters battled the blaze to prevent it reaching a bond
store in the building.
The owner of Moss Motorcycles said his business had been wiped out.
Mr Bob Moss, 30, managed to save around 22 motor cycles from his
premises, but lost up to #150,000 of stock.
Specialist glass company Spectraglass lost #500,000 worth of machinery
and stock in the fire.
The fire was discovered by a Spectraglass employee Roddy Milne, 25,
who spotted smoke coming from the motorcycle dealers.

A CLERGYMAN who teaches religious education admitted to police that he
had physically restrained a 12-year-old girl in his class, Elgin Sheriff
Court was told yesterday.
But the Rev James Scott, who is on trial accused of assault, insisted
he had used minimum force on the girl in a bid to stop her hitting
another pupil.
Mr Scott, 46, of Morriston Road, Elgin, gave his explanation of the
alleged incident at a Moray school in a letter to police.
He handed officers the letter after arriving at Elgin police station
to answer a charge of assaulting the pupil by striking her on the arm.
The court was told that the girl, who cannot be named for legal
reasons, suffered a bruised upper arm after the alleged attack in
September last year.
Constable Neil Lynch, 42, read Mr Scott's letter to the court in which
he stated that the girl had been ''striking out'' at another pupil.
The letter read: ''She may also have struck me because I was behind
her. I used minimum force to restrain her.
''My left hand made contact with her right arm. She was not hurt in
any way.
''A pupil shouted out at me 'You could be done for that. She can get
you for that'. I said that was nonsense.''
The court heard that Mr Scott was a full-time teacher of religious
education at the school and had worked there since 1979.
The assault is alleged to have taken place while he was taking a music
class to cover for another teacher.
Headmaster Mr Norman Strachan, 48, told the court staff had been given
guidance on using force to restrain pupils.
''Even a tap can cause the danger of a charge being brought against
you and staff are well aware of that,'' he said.
In her evidence, the girl told the court that Mr Scott had struck her
without warning during the lesson.
The girl said that she had been speaking to a classmate, but had ended
the conversation before she was struck by Mr Scott.
She said she had been aware of the teacher's presence behind her and
then felt a pain in her arm.
She claimed another pupil told Mr Scott he could be reported for what
he had done.
''Mr Scott said, 'shut up, don't get that into her head','' the girl
told the court.
''I just put my arm on the table and put my head on my arm,'' she
said.
Asked by Mr McKay if she had felt like crying, the girl said: ''Yes.''
The girl then told the court that she and friend had gone to see her
guidance teacher, who referred her to the headmaster.
The headmaster in turn sent her to see second-year tutor Miss Watson,
who took her to hospital.
At the end of the prosecution case, the defence made a submission of
no case to answer, but this was rejected by Sheriff Donald
Booker-Millburn.
The trial was adjourned for three weeks.

SCOTTISH planning laws are being changed to reduce the amount of red
tape involved in the demolition of non-residential buildings and in the
erection of road toll collection facilities, if these are introduced, it
was announced yesterday.
In line with the Government's intention to apply only the minimum
necessary level of planning controls to demolition, the amendments will
exempt from control all buildings except houses, flats and their
adjoining properties.
They will also excuse any future road toll collection facilities from
the need for planning consent, so long as they meet specific conditions
on size and location.
However, planning authorities will be able to insist on their approval
being sought to cover the method used to demolish non-residential
buildings and any site restoration work. Their go-ahead may also be
required for the siting, design and external appearance of toll
buildings.
The changes are designed to clarify any legal doubts existing about
whether demolition operations are covered by planning controls.
They ensured that controls would be applied only where they were most
necessary.
Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish Office Minister for Planning, said:
''Demolition will seldom require a planning application. The new
controls have been designed to avoid placing unnecessary burdens on the
building industry.''
Introducing permitted development rights for toll collection
facilities avoided unnecessary duplication of controls. ''Toll roads
themselves are subject to a rigorous control regime,'' Mr Stewart
stated.
The changes applying to demolition do not affect controls covering
listed buildings, scheduled monuments and buildings in conservation
areas.
The amendments come into force on February 3.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said that proposals for possible toll
roads in Scotland were still only at the stage of being under
consideration. A colleague added that the existence of legislation
covering toll collection facilities was in no way a commitment to the
introduction of toll roads.

LEADING Labour left-winger Joan Lestor yesterday fiercely denied a
claim that she acted as a KGB contact in the Commons.
Ms Lestor, who holds the Overseas Aid brief in the Shadow Cabinet,
said she was considering legal action after being made aware of the
allegation, which was published in a book two years ago.
Tory MP Rupert Allason had planned to raise the issue in the Commons
but abandoned the idea after drawing Ms Lestor's attention to the book,
by spy author Brian Crozier.
Mr Allason had planned to name Ms Lestor and other senior Labour
politicians who are alleged in the book to have acted as informants for
the Soviet secret service.
However, Ms Lestor, 63, said in a brief statement: ''I have not read
the book but can state that there is absolutely no truth in the reported
claims that I was a 'fellow traveller' willing to put down parliamentary
questions at the behest of the KGB. I am taking legal advice.''
The Labour left-winger is one of the few leading figures in the party
to have held ministerial office.
Ms Lestor has been a member of Labour's Front-Bench team since 1988.
She lost her Eton and Slough seat in the 1983 election, but returned
to Westminister as MP for Eccles in 1987.

THE debate over a new National Gallery of Scotland appeared to reach a
surprising consensus last night at a meeting in Glasgow University's
Bute Hall, with a supportive contribution from council leader Pat Lally.
Around 150 people attended the open meeting, part of the consultation
process insisted upon by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang last year when he
rejected the proposal of the trustees of Scotland's art archive for a
new Gallery of Scottish Art to be built in Kelvingrove Park.
The gathering, chaired by Glasgow University principal Sir William
Kerr Fraser, was addressed by the chairman of the trustees, Mr Angus
Grossart, and Mr Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries
Mr Grossart said it was up to the Scottish people to decide what form
the gallery in Glasgow should take.
Many of the contributions made from the floor initially suggested
Glasgow was unhappy with the range of options for its content outlined
in the trustees' consultation document. However, Mr Lally surprised the
meeting with his outspoken support for the trustees, characterising his
earlier remarks about the working title of the gallery, The National
Gallery in Glasgow, as ''nitpicking''. He said the city was ''backing
you (the trustees) all the way''.
The mood of the meeting, originally very suspicious of the trustees'
position, also seemed to swing towards a vision of a ''gallery that
would take us up and into the next millennium'', and proved there to be
a great degree of common will for the gallery.

A DRUG addict who threatened women staff at a bookmakers with an
imitation gun during a masked raid was jailed for six years yesterday.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard the ''gun'' was two tubes been
wrapped inside a black plastic bin bag and the mask the sleeve of a
jumper with holes cut in it.
Edward Dennis, 27, of Whitelaw Street, Glasgow, admitted assaulting
three women at William Hill Bookmakers in Maryhill Road, Glasgow, on
August 8 1994.
The court was told Dennis, unemployed, had a previous conviction for
assault and robbery at the High Court in Glasgow in May 1991 for which
he received four years.
At the bookmakers, Dennis pushed an imitation firearm through a gap in
the lower part of the bandit screen, presented it at staff and demanded
money.
As he started to run from the shop a customer tried to grab him,
shouting: ''That's no' a real gun. Let's get him.''
Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, advocate-depute, said what Dennis had used as a
gun was two tubes inside a bin bag. A total of #20 was later recovered
on waste ground as was Dennis's mask, the jumper sleeve.
Miss Frances McMenamin, defence counsel, said the accused's problems
began in about 1990 when he first became involved in drug abuse.
He was released from his previous assault and robbery sentence in
November 1993. By February of the following year, he was deeply involved
in drug abuse and was injecting heroin.
The drug problem service at Ruchill Hospital also felt he was
suffering from a severe anxiety state with aspects of paranoia.
''He simply cannot explain why he carried out the robbery,'' added
Miss McMenamin. It was purely drug-related: at the time he had been
taking valium and methadone.
Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, told Dennis, that it must have been a
frightening experience for customers in the shop.
He was prepared to accept the offence was drug-related but his main
concern must be the protection of the public.

<HEADLINE>Premier accuses Labour of 'running scared' of Scottish Nationalists. Major scorns Blair devolution plans as threat to Union</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
THERE were angry scenes in the Commons yesterday as the Prime Minister
warned that Labour's devolution plans could lead to the break-up of the
United Kingdom.
Mr Major claimed devolved power would set Scotland back economically.
In his most aggressive confrontation yet with Mr Blair, the Prime
Minister accused the Labour leader of having adopted the policy for
party-political reasons because he was ''running scared of the Scottish
Nationalists''.
He promised that the Government would oppose the Opposition's
devolution policies for a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh assembly
''lock, stock and barrel, from this day forward''.
Mr Blair taunted the Prime Minister over the 1974 Conservative
manifesto, which, he said, pledged a Scottish assembly and promised to
''free Scotland from the rigours of centralism''.
He demanded: ''If devolution is such a dangerous proposal, then why
did you and your party stand on such a policy in the 1974 election?''
Mr Major replied: ''Our party does not stand on such a policy. It is
dangerous.
''The nature of devolution with a tax-raising assembly will place Scot
against Scot, Scot against Briton in other parts of the UK, leave
Scotland as the highest taxed part of the UK, leave Scotland losing
inward investment and Wales too were they to have such an assembly.
''And were Scottish MPs to be given the right to deal with, for
example, education and health in Scotland, it would not be proper for
them to come to this House and vote on education and health in so far as
England and other parts of the UK was concerned.''
Mr Blair countered: ''You say you didn't stand on such a policy. Let
me read from the Conservative party manifesto in 1974.
''It said: devolution is our policy and is the opposite of centralism.
It will free Scotland from the rigours of centralisation and it went on
to say it was the opposite also of separatism.
''If it was right in 1974, surely after this passage of time it is
right now?''
Mr Major said the Labour leader had good reason to be defensive on the
issue.
''If you look more carefully at those proposals you will find there
was no proposal for taxation-raising powers for that assembly, no
executive power for that assembly.
''You might also be aware that as far as this Government is concerned,
I wasn't even in the House then.''
Mr Major told the Labour leader: ''You cannot explain why the Scots
should be more highly taxed than anybody else.''
Mr Archy Kirkwood (Roxburgh and Berwickshire -- Lib. Dem.) said Mr
Major was rightly convinced of the merits of subsidiarity in Europe and
Northern Ireland.
''Why do you set your face against using this self-same principle for
the governance of Scotland when in the 1992 election, 75% of the
electorate in Scotland voted for parties favouring a system of greater
legislative control over Scotland's affairs?'' he demanded.
Mr Major said the difference between the UK and Europe was that the UK
was a ''single national institution, a national state,'' while Europe
was not a single state.
''We are a single government entity. We have been since 1707 and I am
not going to set us on a path where that might be broken up.''
Labour MP Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West) urged Mr Major to justify his
claim that a Scottish parliament was a form of ''dangerous teenage
madness''.
Mr Canavan said he should do so ''bearing in mind that the idea has
been supported even by prominent Tories such as former Prime Ministers
Home and Heath and the current Defence Secretary (Malcolm Rifkind) and
the current Scottish Secretary (Ian Lang)''.
To laughter he added: ''What are you going to do about these dangerous
teenage madmen?''
Urging Mr Canavan to engage in some ''grown up politics'', Mr Major
insisted there had not been a proposition for a tax-raising parliament
with executive powers before.
''What your party is proposing would put Scotland significantly
backwards in its economic prosperity, will lose inward investment to
Scotland, will increase taxation in Scotland and will set Scot against
other parts of the UK and some Scots against other Scots. That is not a
wise proposition.''
Tory Colin Shepherd (Hereford) said that Mr Major's ''firm stance on
the integrity of the UK'' was widely appreciated.
If devolution came about, he warned, and English MPs could not vote on
Scottish issues, ''our constituents would want to know why Scottish MPs
could vote on English matters''.
Mr Major said there was no satisfactory answer to the question.
''If certain matters were devolved to a parliament in any part of the
UK and that parliament were to have exclusive responsibility for them,
then MPs from that part of the UK could not vote in this House on those
issues affecting other parts of the UK.''
Later, Mr Kirkwood called for a debate and said: ''If today's Prime
Minister's Question Time is anything to go by, the whole question of
constitutional reform is very much on the agenda -- put there by no less
than the Prime Minister.''
Commons Leader Tony Newton told him: ''In the light of the exchanges
and the increasing clarity of the inability of the Opposition to answer
any of the questions that arise from the proposals they are allegedly
floating, there could well be merit in such a debate.''
However, later Mr Newton told SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing
he was not giving a commitment to such a debate.

<RECORDNO>980386033</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CATALOGUE of criticism from campaigners and the Opposition yesterday
greeted the publication of a Disability Bill heralded by Ministers as a
''historic advance'' for the disabled.
Mr William Hague, the Minister for the Disabled, said the Disability
Discrimination Bill would, for the first time, make it unlawful for
employers to discriminate on the grounds of disability.
It also established a National Disability Council to advise the
Government on eliminating discrimination, and introduced new rights of
access for disabled people, he said.
However, disability activists said Britain's 6.5 million disabled
people would still remain second-class citizens.
They denounced the Bill as a ''set of half-measures which fall far
short of laws banning sex and race discrimination''.
The Institute of Directors also criticised the proposed legislation --
designed to become law by the autumn -- saying business would have to
pick up the tab for the Bill's ''vague and ambiguous'' commitments.
The Bill comes after a furious row when the Government killed off the
back-bench Civil Rights Disabled Persons Bill, which would have given
disabled people equal rights in employment, housing, education, and
public transport.
Mr Tom Clarke, the Shadow Minister for the disabled, said it was
absurd that the Government was claiming its Bill would end
discrimination when so many of the measures were unenforceable.
It had no new anti-discrimination rights in education or transport,
and new employment rights would only apply to firms employing more than
20 people, he said.
The Civil Rights Disabled Persons Bill is now being resurrected by
Labour MP Harry Barnes (Derbyshire North East) with cross-party
sponsors.
Mr Stephen Bradshaw, of Rights for Disabled People Now, said:
''Disabled people must have the same civil rights as women and black
people.''
TUC general secretary John Monks said the proposals did not yet meet
the case for giving full civil rights to disabled people.

BRITISH soldiers are to be withdrawn from the streets of Belfast
during daylight hours from Sunday in a move aimed at bolstering the
Northern Ireland peace process and ending a generation of armed
confrontation.
Foot and vehicle patrols will be absent for the first time in 25
years, although the 19,000 troops assigned to garrison or peacekeeping
duties will remain in barracks in the province and will continue routine
surveillance and security checks after dark.
Their presence and numbers are to be kept under constant review, as
part of the ''ongoing threat assessment'', according to Sir Hugh
Annesley, the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Chief Constable.
The decision, taken in conjunction with the Army commander for
Northern Ireland, Lieutenant-General Sir Roger Wheeler, follows the
Provisional IRA ceasefire, which started on September 1 last year, and
the loyalist paramilitary ceasefire, which took effect from October 14.
The move was largely welcomed by politicians, although Sinn Fein said
that it was not enough and the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist
Party condemned it as a ''crazy concession to the IRA''.
After 25 years of constant patrols, it will be the first time for a
sizeable section of the community that they will be able to walk or
drive along soldier-free streets.
Sir Hugh Annesley said: ''It should be emphasised that the military
are only being removed from their support role on the streets during
certain hours. They are not being removed from the province and remain
in Northern Ireland under the command of the GOC.''
Military patrolling has been reduced gradually as the ceasefire has
continued. Londonderry, where troops first went on duty in Northern
Ireland in August 1969, was the first to see them withdrawn to barracks.
Most areas are largely free of soldiers, but 24-hour patrolling
continues in south Armagh and east Tyrone -- both formerly hotbeds of
IRA activity, and areas where security chiefs believe the ceasefire
could break first, if it does end.
Troop levels of around 18,000 remain and military chiefs have
indicated that there is no immediate plan to start withdrawals.
Sinn Fein welcomed the announcement but made it clear republicans
wanted much more, including the removal of police from nationalist
areas.
Sinn Fein Councillor Joe Austin said: ''I welcome this as a first step
along a fairly difficult road of dimilitarisation. It has got to be
matched by other developments -- we should go the whole road and go for
a total and complete demilitarisation,'' he said.
His party colleague, Councillor Alex Maskey, said it was a small but
important step, adding: ''We look forward to seeing watch towers being
taken down and the dismantling of major army bases which dominate
nationalist areas.
''We also look forward to the withdrawal of RUC military patrols from
nationalist areas.''
The Ulster Unionist Party, the Alliance Party, and the SDLP all
welcomed the announcement.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, was
the lone voice of opposition, condeming the move as ''yet another crazy
concession to the IRA. It shows the British Government is engaged in
unilateral demilitarisation''.
He said it was a sop which followed comments by Sir Patrick Mayhew,
the Northern Ireland Secretary, that ''he saw his priority as propping
up Sinn Fein/IRA leader Gerry Adams''.
Mr Robinson added: ''It lowers and removes all its defences one by
one, while the IRA maintains its killer gangs and holds on to its guns
and explosives.''
But Sir Patrick made it clear yesterday that the Government could not
develop full confidence in the paramilitaries until ''substantial
progress'' had been made on the question of decommissioning terrorist
weapons.
Writing in the Belfast Telegraph, he said: ''No-one can claim, for
example, to need Semtex, detonators, or heavy machine guns, if they are
truly committed to the democratic process of settling differences.
''If they insist on holding on to them until they have secured the
settlement they want, what does it suggest about their true
intentions?''
He said the Government had been working on the assumption that the
terrorists did mean to give up violence for good. However, he added:
''Only the paramilitaries know what their true intentions are.''

<HEADLINE>Britain should be ready to pull out of the EU, says Lamont</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980386036</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FORMER Chancellor Norman Lamont last night warned that Britain should
be prepared to pull out of the EU if Europe opts for a single currency.
He stepped up pressure from the Tory right for a fundamental rethink
of European policy as Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd moved to head off a
new Franco-German alliance.
Mr Lamont, who surprised the Tory Party conference in October with his
outspoken views, returned to the attack last night in a speech in
London.
He said a single currency would inevitably lead to a single European
superstate because there would have to be central control over financial
policy.
''To force countries into the strait-jacket of a single currency could
create tremendous pains and costs of adjustment. It could mean sharply
rising unemployment and mass migration,'' he said.
''For that reason, even if the other countries of Europe go ahead with
a single currency we should not participate but wave them goodbye and
wish them well.
''Britain can survive on its own like many other medium-sized and
small countries from Japan to Australia to Canada to Switzerland.
Britain needs to belong to the world, not Europe.''
The message from Mr Lamont is unlikely to command much support in
Government, but Mr Hurd yesterday took the opportunity to deliver a
warning to France and Germany not to expect to carve up the future of
Europe between them.
He said the future of the EU was too important to be settled by the
Paris-Bonn axis which ''overwhelmingly'' set the agenda in the run-up to
the Maastricht Treaty.
In a speech to the the Institut Francais de Relations Internationales
in Paris, he emphasised that he was not a critic of the Franco-German
partnership which had helped bring peace to the Continent.
However, his comments were welcomed by Tory Euro-sceptics who on
Wednesday night received an olive branch from the Government in the form
of a promise that it would not block rebel MPs who had lost the whip
from sitting on Commons select committees.
CONCILIATION moves between Ministers and the Tory Euro-rebels will be
severely tested in the Commons next week.
Labour has chosen to open a debate on Wednesday on access by Spanish
and Portuguese fishing vessels to British waters.
This follows anger by Tory European Union critics and party MPs from
fishing areas when the Government was defeated by other EU Ministers
last month over moves to allow more boats from those two nations into
waters round the British Isles.

<HEADLINE>NHS trusts could face huge overtime bill. Eleven junior doctors bring test case on 'unpaid work'</HEADLINE>

A TEST case being brought before a Glasgow industrial tribunal on
Monday could result in Scottish NHS trusts facing claims from junior
doctors for hundreds of thousands of pounds of unpaid overtime.
Eleven surgical and medical doctors who work at the Paisley Royal
Alexandra Hospital are taking the NHS Trust to the tribunal after
exhausting internal grievance procedures, which included presenting
their case to the trust's board.
Four doctors, Dr Claire Murray, Dr Valerie Dudgeon, Dr Bruce Elliot
and Dr Robby Steele, are to appear as representatives of the eleven,
whose case has been backed by the British Medical Association.
They claim that during their first six month contract with the trust,
which covered the period from August 1993 to the end of January last
year, their conditions of work were improperly defined given the
intensity of tasks involved.
The result of this, they argue, was that they received neither the
correct rest time during a shift, nor were they correctly paid for the
hours worked.
Junior doctors, who are paid a salary of #13,590 for their basic 40
hour week, complete two such six month attachments, one in surgical and
one in medical, before going on to become senior house officers.
Around half the group, who worked in surgery, were expected to work 72
hours weekly, with overtime paid at the Class 3 rate of 50% of their
basic hourly rate.
Under this classification, set under a 1992 national agreement,
surgeons are meant to work a maximum of 32 hours at a stretch with eight
hours of rest periods.
The Paisley doctors will argue the intensity of work meant they very
rarely got the prescribed eight hours, and consequently should have been
graded as Class 2, which involves the payment of overtime at a rate of
70%.
The other half of the group, who worked in medicine, claim they were
graded as Class 2 and paid the 70% overtime rate when they should have
been assigned the grade of Class 1, and paid the full basic hourly rate
for overtime, which is set at 24 hours a week.
The maximum period of duty for this group is set at 16 hours with four
hours of breaks, but similarly these doctors will argue they were never
able to take these rest periods because of pressure of work.
A spokesman for the BMA said: ''The doctors will testify they were so
busy they were unable at times to stop even for coffee, never mind take
the breaks they were entitled to.''
He said the case, if successful, would give junior doctors all over
the country grounds to take similar action.
The BMA spokesman added: ''This test case is not just about the money,
though junior doctors are undoubtedly overworked and underpaid.
''All we want to see is the proper implementation of the government's
New Deal for junior doctors, including the proper definition of the
intensity of their work.''
The hearing of the complaints, made under the Wages Act, is expected
to last four days.
Ms Ruth McQuillan, a spokesperson for the Paisley Trust, said the
Royal Alexandra had tried hard to conform to government legislation on
the pay and conditions of junior doctors.
Senior trust officials will give evidence at the tribunal, which is
scheduled to finish on Thursday.

A PLAN to build houses on a green-belt site in Monklands was given the
go-ahead last night in spite of protests from locals, environmentalists
and Strathclyde Regional Council.
The application by SL Homes to build on farmland at Bargeddie on the
outskirts of Glasgow was recently at the centre of an investigation by
the local authority accounts commission.
It followed a disclosure under parliamentary privilege that a loan had
been made by the company, run by ex-Celtic director Mr Brian Dempsey, to
a family firm associated with Mr Jim Brooks, the leader of Monklands
District Council, but no further action was taken.
Last night, councillors on the district planning and development
committee followed a recommendation by the director of planning, Mr
David Cooper, and voted unanimously in favour of accepting the
application, subject to conditions.
The plans are in breach of Strathclyde Regional Council's green-belt
plans and contravene guidelines to discourage building in the
countryside.
The council brushed aside the recommendation from the region's
director of physical planning advising them to refuse the application
from the building company for the 45-acre site.
The decision was met with outrage from the Monklands Green Belt
Protection Group who submitted more than 500 letters of objection and
attended the meeting last night.
Group secretary Miss Maureen Somerville said local people felt they
had been fobbed off by the council. ''Bargeddie means settlement in
green fields in Gaelic,'' said Miss Somerville. ''They are just about to
pour concrete all over those green fields.''
The group's prime objection was the danger of increased traffic
because of the site's proximity to an accident blackspot which has seen
18 deaths in 20 years. Other objections included the site's drainage
problems -- it is subject to flooding -- and the threat to the rural
environment which is inhabited by a variety of different wildlife
species.
Many of the group's members live on Bargeddie's main road and their
views on to open fields and the Campsies will be obstructed.
The council argued that the SL Homes development would solve the
area's population loss problems which have arisen from low levels of
private house building. Mr Cooper's report said: ''In his reply to my
letter, the regional director of physical planning notes clearly that he
cannot support any application for green-belt release on either
strategic (green-belt) planning grounds or in terms of local housing
need.
''Irrespective of the views of the regional council in this regard, I
am nonetheless wholly satisfied that a convincing case can be made for a
limited and controlled green-belt release.''
The plans now go to the region which can refuse or rubber stamp them.

TWO Grampian police officers appeared in private at Aberdeen Sheriff
court yesterday on a number of charges including supplying drugs and
attempting to pervert the course of justice.
One of the former drug squad officers, who was arrested following an
inquiry by Strathclyde Police, also faces a bribery charge. A third
officer appeared on a separate petition charged with possessing drugs
and reset.
Procurator-fiscal Mr Alf Vannet said that Constable Neil Cooper, 35,
and Sergeant Hamish Moir, 35, were committed for further examination and
remanded in custody. They will make a second appearance next week.
On a separate petition, Constable James Grimmer, 34, was committed for
further examination and released on bail.
Constable Cooper and Sergeant Moir are alleged to have attempted to
pervert the course of justice by inciting someone to fabricate evidence.
Constable Cooper is also charged with supplying cannabis resin,
attempting to defeat the ends of justice, and two counts of contravening
the Police Scotland Act.
Mr Vannet said the charges concerned allegations that he neglected and
violated his duties by failing to investigate crimes which had come to
his attention. He is alleged to have attempted to defeat the ends of
justice by, in exchange for payment, disclosing confidential information
about police operations.
Sergeant Moir is charged with suppling cannabis resin and attempting
to pervert the course of justice by fabricating evidence in a drugs
case.
Constable Grimmer is charged with reset and possessing cannabis resin.
The charges facing all three relate to the period from January 1991 to
December 1994.
Sergeant Moir and Constables Cooper and Grimmer, along with a fourth
constable who has not been charged, have been suspended by Grampian
Police who initiated an inquiry and called in Strathclyde Police to
complete it. Their investigations are continuing.

EDINBURGH District Council yesterday approved essential repairs to the
Scott Monument in Princes Street which will cost almost #2m.
Last month part of Edinburgh's main thoroughfare was temporarily
closed, when it was feared the tourist landmark was crumbling and had
become a danger to the public.
The council agreed unanimously to set aside #1.5m for the urgent
repair and refurbishment of the 200ft monument's stonework.
Applications will now be made to the Heritage Lottery Fund and
organisations such as Historic Scotland.
Last year the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Ian Lang, vetoed a
council plan to clean up the monument.

Brussels
BRITAIN'S 62 Labour Euro-MPs were split again yesterday for the second
time in two days. After an overnight U-turn on their support for
retaining Clause 4 in Labour's constitution, they fell into open
disagreement on whether to endorse the incoming European Commission.
An official statement yesterday afternoon announced the European
Parliamentary Labour Party -- the largest single party in the assembly
-- was ''making it clear'' it would vote for the proposed new
Commission. But within minutes, one of the group's most senior members,
Mr Ken Collins (Strathclyde East), declared sarcastically: ''I think
this is a bit of a typographical error.''
Mr Collins, the longest serving committee chairman in the parliament
after more than a decade presiding over environmental affairs, said he
and his cross-party committee -- plus other Labour Euro-MPs -- would
vote against the Commission unless there were changes in its
composition.
Mr Jacques Santer, Commission president-designate, has until Tuesday
night to make changes to his 20-strong team or face having it rejected
at a parliamentary plenary session in Strasbourg on Wednesday.
Euro-MPs, having just concluded a series of interrogations of proposed
Commission members, found faults with five and with the share-out of
some portfolios. There have been cross-party calls for some
Commissioners to be dropped and several portfolios to be redistributed.
Labour group leader Mr Wayne David announced party backing when he
said: ''The proposed Commission has more Socialists and more women than
ever before and Labour Euro-MPs have no intention of voting against such
a Commission.''
While Mr David was preparing his statement, Mr Collins and his
committee were pouring over remarks made in Copenhagen on Wednesday
night by the proposed Environmental Commissioner, Mrs Ritt Bjerregaard.
She said after an uncomfortable session with Euro-MPs that the European
Parliament ''was not a real parliament''.
Mr Collins described her remarks as regrettable and ''rash and perhaps
irresponsible''. 0He said that if parliament did not receive concessions
from Mr Santer by Monday, he could not guarantee how the vote would go.

SCIENTISTS know which organisms cause necrotising fasciitis, but are
still a long way from knowing why.
The guilty party -- variants of the haemolytic streptococcus A
bacterium -- are harboured by up to one in five of the population and
normally cause nothing worse than a sore throat.
The unknown factor which turns this common germ into the flesh-killer
which grabbed headlines last summer, and returned last week with
devastating results, still eludes the researchers.
''We know more than we did since the outbreaks last May, and we are
getting closer and closer, but we still only know about a quarter of
what we need to know to crack this,'' said Professor Thomas Pennington,
a bacteriologist at Aberdeen University and one of the country's leading
experts on the disease.
''The clusters which have appeared over the past year were caused by
different variants, so there seems to be no reason why they should have
occurred in that pattern, other than coincidence.''
Professor Pennington said doctors were now much more aware and more
able to spot the condition since the publicity about the cluster of
cases in Gloucestershire last year.
However, that does not always help when a rogue germ is galloping
through the patient's flesh faster than laboratory cultures can identify
it. ''You can practically see it happening before your eyes,'' said
Professor Pennington.
The anguish this can cause with the benefit of hindsight was summed up
yesterday by Mr Alasdair Fyfe, one of the surgeons at Yorkhill who tried
to save Allan Mitchell, when he was asked yesterday if earlier
intervention might have saved the boy.
''Any child who dies in this hospital causes us great concern, but
when it is caused by an illness which can be treated by antibiotics it
is extremely frustrating not to be able to treat it early enough to save
the child's life,'' he said.
''It is a very rapidly spreading infection and totally unpredictable.
Although the blood culture tells us the organism involved we can't
predict it will develop into necrotising fasciitis. We see many children
with this organism, and the antibiotics were started as soon as the
organism was identified.''
By that time, however, the damage was already being done deep inside
Allan's leg, behind the cover of the skin and the layer of fat beneath.
The infection attacks the layer of deep fascia, the lining which
covers the muscles of the body like a second, internal skin. Once it
takes hold it spreads rapidly along this layer throughout the body.
By killing off the tissue the rogue bacteria are also destroying the
local circulation, closing off the route of pursuit by antibiotics.
One theory as to the cause involves other organisms -- another
bacterium like staphylococcus, or a virus -- which act in synergy with
the strep A.
''They could both be right inasmuch as the condition might be caused
by different mixtures of bugs,'' said Professor Pennington. ''The virus
theory is still being investigated: this has a virus infecting the
streptococcus itself rather than the human host, and carrying genes
which alter the strep so that it produces particular toxins.
''This would explain why different strains of streptococcus are
causing similar illnesses.''
It is nevertheless relatively rare. Mr Fyfe said that he and two
fellow West of Scotland paediatric surgeons with a combined total of 100
years' experience had seen three children with it, one of whom had
survivd. Allan Mitchell was the first case he had seen in his 15 years
at Yorkhill.
It was first identified by an American doctor in Shanghai in the
1920s, but probably accounted for many deaths suffered by wounded
soldiers in the American Civil War.
Several cases have emerged, for no apparent reason, in Central
Scotland, including the most recent one of Miss Elizabeth Sutherland,
71, sister of former Beirut hostage Tom Sutherland, who was operated on
this week at Falkirk Royal Infirmary after the bug affected her throat.

AN Atomic Energy Authority official yesterday defended the director of
Dounreay, Mr John Baxter, over the employment of his girlfriend at the
nuclear plant.
Mr Baxter, 43, faced sleaze accusations after Ms Margaret Johnston
started a #20,000-a-year job at the site four months ago.
She transferred from her job at the AEA headquarters at Harwell in
Oxfordshire to become a personnel officer while Mr Baxter was
spearheading the latest round of cuts in the workforce.
Mr Derek Pooley, chief executive of the area's government division,
said the arrangement is not an uncommon perk for senior management.
''That is what life is like these days,'' he said during a visit to
the Caithness site.
He believed the transfer did Dounreay and the local area a favour by
creating an extra job.
Mr Pooley confirmed Mr Baxter made Ms Johnson's employment at Dounreay
a pre-condition of him taking up the director's post. It is, he claimed,
a request made fairly often where staff are transferred.
''Our head of personnel can think of a hundred examples where we've
agreed to move a partner when we've wanted to move someone,'' he said.

THE Prince and Princess of Wales stepped into public view yesterday,
albeit half a mile apart, after days of renewed speculation about their
marriage.
The Royal couple carried out almost simultaneous engagements in
central London only 48 hours after Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles, the
Prince's close friend, announced her divorce.
The Princess was at a private ceremony, although with a barrage of
photographers, and the Prince addressed a gathering of the great and the
good.
Charles launched the 100th anniversary celebrations of the National
Trust at a grand hotel luncheon, and she presented awards at a ceremony
to two men with whom she helped save the life of a drowning tramp.
When the Princess arrived for the unpublicised ceremony at the Royal
Parks Police headquarters in Hyde Park: dozens of photographers and
camera crews were waiting for her.
She presented awards to Finnish music student Kari Kotila, 30, and
Royal Parks policeman Derek Caldwell, 26, who was born in Glasgow.
She helped them rescue tramp Martin O'Donoghue last May when he fell
into a lake in Regent's Park. Mr Kotila dived in to save him. Mr
Caldwell gave him the kiss of life. The Princess, who was passing, used
her mobile phone to dial 999.
She wondered about Mr O'Donoghue's life now, asking Mr Caldwell: ''I
wanted to know if we did him a favour or not.'' He replied: ''We did.
He's quite happy . . still living in Regent's Park.''
Meanwhile, across Hyde Park at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane,
Charles seemed untroubled by the renewed speculation about his possible
divorce and remarriage to Mrs Parker Bowles.
Among more than 400 guests was Lord Charteris, the Queen's former
private secretary, who last week described Mrs Parker Bowles as the love
of Charles's life.

<RECORDNO>980386045</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MORE than 450 jobs at naval armaments depots -- including 266 in
Scotland -- are to be shed over the next 10 years as part of a ''radical
restructuring'' of Defence Ministry needs.
A total of 138 jobs at Coulport, the nuclear missile storage site on
the Clyde and 128 at Beith in Ayrshire are to go to help save #82m over
the next decade and #10.2m a year thereafter, according to the MoD.
A further 200 posts will be axed at Plymouth and Gosport in England,
largely as a result of the end of the Cold War, the withdrawal of US
forces from the UK, and the cancellation of a new generation of sea
mines.
An MoD spokesman said last night: ''A number of these posts are not
filled at present. We hope most of the cutback can be absorbed over the
period by non-replacement and natural wastage.
''But we do have a commitment to re-employ as many people as possible
in other departments if the target figure is not reached by natural
means.''
Labour MP Brian Wilson, whose Cunninghame constituency includes the
Beith depot, said: ''This is a crude arithmetic exercise aimed at
cutting the workforce by 25%. The excellent case for retention of jobs
put forward by the trade unions has been brushed aside.
''The cutback comes on top of major efficiency improvements already
implemented by the staff at RNAD Beith.''

THE 10-year-old Glasgow boy who died from the flesh-eating disease
necrotising fasciitis, was bitten by a classmate last month, it was
revealed yeserday.
However, Allan Mitchell's parents last night declared that they did
not believe the other pupil was responsible for his death. Education
officials also said they were satisfied that there was no connection
between the bite and the disease.
As reported in The Herald yesterday, Allan died on Sunday at the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, Glasgow. Doctors at first
thought he had a viral infection and he was sent home from hospital on
Monday of last week.
But his parents took him back the following night and he was admitted
for tests. His condition worsened and a swelling developed on his leg.
He underwent a three-hour operation on Thursday but died in the
intensive care unit on Sunday morning.
Allan, of Inchmurrin Gardens, Cathkin, had Down's Syndrome and was a
pupil at Kirkriggs school in Croftfoot Road which has a roll of about 70
primary-age children, all of whom have learning difficulties.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Region's education department yesterday
said that Allan had received a ''very minor'' bite on his hand from
another boy in class in an incident on December 6. He added: ''It was
not a serious bite, the skin was not broken and there was no blood
drawn.''
Doctors at the hospital yesterday said it was not clear what caused
Allan's infection. Swelling had occurred rapidly in his leg and there
was no sign of a puncture wound.
Consultant surgeon Alasdair Fyfe said the condition was
''exceptionally rare'' in children and went on: ''In my experience and
that of my paediatric colleagues we have seen only three cases.''
In a statement released later, Allan's parents, Tom and Pamela
Mitchell, thanked the hospital for the efforts made to save his life and
expressed their best wishes to the doctors and nurses who cared for him.
They added: ''We would also like to say that no responsibility should
be attributed to the school colleague who is alleged to have bitten our
son.''
The couple, who have a five-year-old daughter, Laura, asked for the
media to respect their privacy. ''We feel that Allan is now in heaven
and that we are at peace. We would like to pick up the strands of our
family life and return to normal.''
The education department spokesman explained that when the biting
incident happened, Allan's father was informed and he discussed it with
the headteacher.
''An incident like that is not uncommon in a school. Special needs
youngsters at times do things like that. So do pupils in mainstream
schools.''
Allan had continued attending school and there had been no sign of any
problem, said the spokesman. ''We understand he then took ill during the
holidays.
''Obviously, we are going to investigate the biting. We have to
discuss it and take medical advice if necessary.''
Last night, the spokesman added that after speaking to doctors at
Yorkhill, the education department was satisfied that there was no
connection between the biting incident and the disease.
Earlier, headteacher Frank Muldoon paid tribute to Allan on behalf of
the close-knit school. ''Everyone is deeply saddened by Allan's death
and we all send our deepest sympathy to his family.
''He had attended the school for five years and he was a delightful
wee boy, a very happy wee boy. He was very popular and very much liked
by all the children and staff.''
Miss Sutherland, 71, a sister of former Beirut hostage Tom Sutherland,
remained in a stable condition yesterday.
Timetable to Allan's death
December 6: School friend bites Allan's hand.
Monday, January 2: Allan, is taken to Yorkhill accident and emergency
department. A viral illness is diagnosed and he is sent home.
Tuesday: Allan doesn't get better. His parents bring him back and he
is admitted.
Wednesday: Doctors believe he has some kind of hepatitis.
Thursday: Allan deteriorates rapidly and is taken into intensive care.
Blood cultures have identified haemolytic Streptococcus A and
antibiotics are applied; his left leg is swelling rapidly, indicating
necrotising fasciitis.
Thursday night: Allan undergoes a three-hour operation.
Friday-Saturday: Allan remains on a ventilator in intensive care. He
is heavily sedated to protect him from pain.
Sunday, 6am: Allan is dead.

BRITISH Telecom was last night accused of conducting a ''total sham''
of a public consultation over its plan to split the Glasgow telephone
book in two.
The attack came from Councillor Pat Lally, leader of Glasgow District
Council, following a meeting between himself, council officials and BT
representatives to discuss the move to produce separate directories for
north and south of the Clyde.
Councillor Lally reacted angrily to what he said was BT's refusal to
reconsider the plan.
He said: ''I am bitterly disappointed about the attitude of BT on this
issue. The consultation process by which they justified their logic was,
in effect, a total sham.''
But a spokeswoman for BT said Councillor Lally's allegations were
unfair and several steps had been taken to try to get phone users'
views.
The spokeswoman admitted BT had been very disappointed at the low
level of responses.''
Whatever was decided, she pointed out that both books would contain
the business section for the whole of Glasgow and that phone users would
be able to obtain a free copy of the other directory.

Before he died, Mr Beynon, 69, told friends: ''I would swap every

He and his wife, 65, hit the headlines when they were photographed

Mrs Beynon, a mother of three who also has nine grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren, filled in the coupon which won the couple

However, the school meals caterer suffered a stroke when the couple

Later she became virtually housebound at their home at Creigiau, Mid
Glamorgan, where Mr Beynon cared for her.

THE Maid of the Loch paddle steamer is to be given a new lease of life
as a ''flagship'' attraction on Loch Lomond despite a last-minute report
by a retired senior naval architect who described the vessel as a wreck.
The decision to save the Maid and proceed with plans for a #2m plus
restoration was made yesterday at a full meeting of Dumbarton District
Council.
Councillors voted 11 to 5 in favour of setting up a trust which will
take over the ownership of the Maid from the council and seek funding
for its restoration. This endorses a recommendation by consultants who
compiled a feasibility study on the steamer's future.
The consultants have advised that a company with charitable status,
Maid of the Loch Steam Packet Company, should be responsible for the
ownership of the steamer, fund-raising, and development tasks.
The ship, bought by the council for #55,000 in 1992, has been
languishing at Balloch Pier for the past 14 years, although she was
given a facelift for her 40th birthday in March, 1993, by the Paddle
Steamer Preservation Society.
The council's decision came the day after councillors received a
report by retired naval architect Mr James Donaldson who warned: ''In my
professional opinion, the council would be ill-advised to proceed with
this project on the basis of the costing information provided to date.
''In the most accurate terms, I can only describe the Maid as a wreck.
No-one has made any approach to the Marine Safety Agency to ascertain
whether she could be put back into the water.''
He emphasised that the Maid was probably ''not beyond repair'' but
said that the cost of restoring the vessel would be some #750,000 more
than that estimated by the council's consultants.
Mr Donaldson, who was the principal ship surveyor with the Department
of Transport until his retirement in 1993, was employed as a consultant
by private cruise operators on Loch Lomond, Mr John Sweeney and Mr
Stuart Cordner.
Mr Sweeney, who operates passenger boats and a small shipyard at
Balloch, was ''disappointed but not surprised'' by the decision.
He argued that ''a heavily subsidised Maid'' would provide ''unfair
competition'' for the owners of smaller passenger boats on the loch and
could lead to the demise of several operators and jobs.
He added: ''The Maid is a white elephant heading down the same road as
the HCI hospital in Clydebank. Large amounts of public money are about
to be squandered on a project that has not been properly researched.''
At yesterday's council meeting, Tory group leader Mr Bill Morrison
argued that Mr Donaldson's report and doubts expressed by the Loch
Lomond Park Authority over costs lent weight to moves to ''scupper the
project.''
However, Provost Patrick O'Neill rejected the criticism after hearing
that Mr Donaldson had merely made ''a cursory examination'' of the Maid.
The Provost rejected a call by Independent Councillor William Petrie
to delay the vote ahead of an independent survey by another naval
architect. He claimed a decision on the vessel's future had to be made
quickly to qualify for grant aid.

POP group Wet Wet Wet is to collaborate with 20 of Scotland's leading
visual artists on an innovative project, The Herald can reveal today.
The idea, based on the band's forthcoming album, was yesterday hailed
as one of the most ambitious ever joint ventures between the disciplines
of music and art.
It will involve commissions for many of the country's best known
contemporary figurative artists, including Peter Howson, John Byrne,
Steven Campbell, and David Mach.
They have agreed to produce one work each to feature on the sleeve of
the band's latest album, which is expected to sell millions of copies
around the world.
It is due for release in April, and has been given the working title
of The Glasgow Boys.
The artists have been asked either to paint portraits of band members
or interpret tracks from the album.
Their work will also be collected in a special exhibition which is
expected to travel to locations across Europe as a major showcase for
both the band and the artists.
The band's manager, Mr Elliot Davis, yesterday described the project
as a unique interaction between the best of Scottish music and art.
''People often think there is a great difference between them, and
that one is more or less commercial than the other,''he said
''But art is music, and music is art -- why keep them apart?''
The collection would eventually be signed and auctioned off, with all
the proceeds from sales going to charity, he added.
Clare Henry, The Herald's art critic, has been appointed curator of
the collection.
She said the proposal had been given enthusiastic support by all the
artists approached, despite the shortage of time available.
''They have all jumped at it, and feel it will be both fun, and a very
worthwhile project to be involved in,'' she said.

THE DRIVER of a bus which crashed into a railway bridge in Glasgow
last September, killing three Girl Guides and two of their leaders, has
been charged with causing death by dangerous driving.
Mr Campbell Devlin, 30, of Wellgreen Court, Pollokshaws, Glasgow, is
due to appear in private on petition at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.
The crash happened when a group of Guides from Drumchapel was
returning home after a day out at Butlins Wonderwest World last
September.
The double deck Clydeside 2000 bus in which they were travelling
smashed into the railway bridge in West Street, near the southern
approaches to the Kingston Bridge, ripping off its roof.
Guides Catherine McKnight, 10, of Pitmilly Road, and Margaret Riddick,
10, of Bankglen Road, were killed along with their leaders Mary
McGreskin, 39, of Drummore Road, and Rena Dougall, 47, of Boon Drive.
Another guide, Laura Cullen, also 10, of Bellside Avenue, died later
from her injuries.
Mr Devlin also faces two charges of driving a vehicle with defective
recording equipment.

A GIRL aged nine escaped from a plane crash when she was thrown clear
of the jet into marsh plants seconds before it plunged from 14,000 ft
into a lake, killing all 51 others on board.
Aviation authorities said Erika Delgado was the only survivor from the
crash of an Intercontinental de Aviacion DC-9 in northern Colombia.
The plane came down minutes before it was due to land in the Caribbean
resort of Cartagena on a flight from Bogota.
There was no immediate word on why the plane crashed.
Relatives of the victims said that Flight 256 had been repeatedly
delayed for last-minute maintenance before departure from Bogota's
international airport, but the airline's managing director denied this.
The plane was nearly 30 years old, according to a spokesman for the
company that made it, McDonnell Douglas. It was delivered in 1966, said
spokesman Tom Williamson.
Rescue teams fanned out across the lake where the jet crashed,
wrapping bodies in black plastic sacks and taking them ashore in small,
flat-bottomed canoes. Helicopters ferried the remains to Cartagena for
identification.
The jet's wreckage was spread out over an area the size of a football
field, most of it underwater.
Radio stations appealed to victims' families for dental records to
speed identification.
Arturo Ramos, a peasant who helped rescue the girl, said he saw a huge
explosion and thought a bomb had gone off.
''When we got near, we heard a sob, so we took off our clothes and
went into the lake to see what it was,'' he said in a radio interview.
''It was the girl. We got her out and took her to the village.''
Civil Aviation Authority director Alvaro Raad said the girl's survival
was extraordinary. ''For those of us who know anything about aviation,
it is practically a miracle for us,'' he said.
Aviation officials said Erika told rescue workers she had been thrown
clear of the blazing plane just before it slammed into the lake.
Ambulance workers evacuated her during the night to Cartagena's
University Hospital with fractures in her arm and pelvis.
Luis Oviedo, one of the team looking after the girl, said that she was
still in intensive care and in deep shock, but was out of danger.
Witnesses said the girl had constantly asked about her parents and young
brother, who died aboard the jet.
Government officials said they hoped the plane's ''black box'' flight
and cockpit voice recorders, recovered from the lake by navy divers,
would provide clues on why the airplane HK3839 suddenly hit problems.
The pilot did not radio an emergency message and there was confusion
about whether the plane exploded in flight. The Civil Aviation Authority
quoted the pilot of a plane following the DC-9 as saying he saw it
explode in flight, but the pilot denied this.--Reuter.

THE majority of people back Scottish devolution according to an
UK-wide opinion poll published today. A total of 51% of people polled by
Gallup for the Daily Telegraph, including 30% of Tory voters, favoured a
Scottish parliament. The poll, which makes dire reading for the Prime
Minister, also shows that 62% of voters would support Labour in an early
General Election, compared with only 18.5% who said they would vote
Conservative, an all-time record low for Tory support.

THE Scottish National Party and Labour set out their views on
constitutional reform for the benefit of the English yesterday, as the
debate took centre-stage at Westminster.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said Labour would deliver devolution
for Scotland as part of a comprehensive package of constitutional reform
designed to preserve, and not destroy, the Union.
In a speech intended to clarify Labour's proposals in the face of
increasing Tory criticism, Mr Brown accused Mr Major of ignoring an
irresistible demand for change.
''He is probably the only person in Britain today who thinks there is
absolutely nothing wrong with the way government works and when he says
that those who propose change are guilty of 'teenage madness', his
comments become arrogant and offensive,'' he said.
Both Mr Brown's speech and the SNP's briefing were aimed at the
English national media, which has latched on to the issue in the wake of
Mr Major's robust defence of the Union at the New Year.
SNP leader Alex Salmond told a heavily-attended press conference at
Westminster that independence for Scotland would mean independence for
England, and claimed there is little opposition south of the Border.
''Most English people are not unsympathetic to the Scottish case for a
parliament, and are uneasy at the thought of Scotland being subjected to
a hostile, London government,'' he said.
He was joined by the rest of the SNP leadership. MP Margaret Ewing
said: ''The best deal for both Scotland and England is an independent
Scottish parliament, which would give Scots power at home and influence
in Europe, and allow the English to develop their own system of
government in accordance with their own wishes.''
Mr Brown's speech drew a questioning response from Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang, who sent him a list of 12 questions seeking clarification of
the tax implications of Labour's policies.
''We are told that their plans are carefully worked out. Yet how is it
that they cannot answer the most basic questions about them? What are
they trying to hide?'' he asked.
Mr Brown's speech is the latest step in a concerted effort by Labour
to counter attacks on constitutional reform led by Mr Major. In it he
set out what Labour argues is wrong with the way Britain is governed,
and promised radical change.
''Change is indeed the best guarantee that the UK will be
strengthened. It is by doing nothing that we will allow disruptive
pressures to grow.''
He added: ''People talk of the West Lothian question. The biggest
question is the Whitehall question: why our constitution is
over-centralised, over-secretive, and over-bureaucratic and why there is
not more openness and accountability.''
But he insisted devolution did not mean separatism. After a Scottish
parliament and a Welsh assembly are created MPs from across Britain will
continue to legislate on national affairs. ''This is devolution from the
centre to bring government closer to the people. It is not separation,''
he said.
In a clear attack on the SNP, he said Scottish trade and the Scottish
people are too tied up with England. ''It makes no sense to cut Scotland
off from its nearest neighbour, England, while seeking to be part of a
bigger Europe which includes England.''

ONE of the men charged in connection with Britain's biggest inquiry
into sex abuse in social service homes worked with Scots children. The
43-year-old man has been charged by Merseyside police investigating
allegations of sex abuse at boys' homes.
Strathclyde Police last night confirmed that, having been alerted by
Merseyside Police, detectives and social workers are investigating
possible incidents of abuse which may have taken place in Strathclyde
Regional Council children's homes over several years. Their inquiry
started in October.
Superintendent Louis Munn, of Strathclyde Police, said: ''We can
confirm that Strathclyde Police and Strathclyde Social Work Department
are presently involved in a joint investigation into possible incidents
of abuse that may have been committed over a period of years in local
authority homes in the Strathclyde area.''
The man, whose identity is being withheld by the authorities, was
arrested by Merseyside Police and appeared in court on April 27 last
year. He is due for commital proceedings on January 25.
During their inquiries, police discovered that the man had worked
previously in Strathclyde. It is believed he worked at homes in
Lanarkshire.
The investigation was launched as a precautionary measure in response
to the man's arrest in Merseyside and was not prompted by any
complaints.
It involves the interviewing of staff and children who are and were
formerly resident at the homes where the man worked.
It is believed that the Strathclyde operation has been kept
low-profile to avoid panic and to prevent staff and children in the
homes from receiving information which might be prejudicial.
The man was arrested as part of a major inquiry, which has so far
resulted in seven care workers being charged in England.
The overall investigation follows allegations received by Cheshire
Police after the conviction in November of child sex abuser Alan
Langshaw, who is not connected to the Strathclyde inquiry.
Langshaw, 42, was sentenced to 10 years at Warrington Crown Court
after pleading guilty to 30 charges of serious sexual abuse and
indecency with children in his care.
The abuse took place over a 23-year period while Langshaw worked at
various homes and institutions in Cheshire and Merseyside.
He was arrested last March and charged with three offences of buggery
and five offences of gross indecency. The offences were committed at all
three places where he worked between 1977 and 1994, on boys and youths
aged between 10 and 20-years-old.
Since he was jailed, police inquiries have revealed allegations of
wide-scale sexual and physical abuse at other homes. More than 60 police
and social service staff have formed a team to investigate the
allegations.
The seven people charged so far -- six men and a woman -- were all
involved with the running of children's homes.
The British Association of Social Workers, which represents about
10,000 social workers, said last night that any breaches of its strict
ethical code by its members would result in disciplinary action.

THE Prime Minister claimed that a Scottish parliament could break up
the United Kingdom, and turn Scot against Scot, as he clashed with
Labour leader Tony Blair on the issue yesterday.
The heated exchanges generated a vivid confrontation in the Commons on
sweeping constitutional change in Britain. The core of it is Scottish
devolution, which Labour is determined to extend to the English regions.
The Prime Minister declared heatedly he would oppose the plans ''lock,
stock and barrel from this day forward''. Both Mr Major and Mr Blair
believe that the result of this confrontation can swing the next General
Election.
Labour proposals for home rule would also turn ''Scot against
Briton'', Mr Major declared.
Labour has promised to get legislation for a Scottish parliament and
Welsh assembly on the statute book within the first year of a Labour
government. The parliament would take over the powers operated by the
Scottish Office and have the ability to raise or lower income tax north
of the border by a margin of 3p.
Mr Blair attempted to turn the tables on Mr Major by producing the
Conservative manifesto for the 1974 General Election, in which Mr Major
stood as an unsuccessful candidate for St Pancras North, promising a
Scottish assembly.
''If devolution is such a dangerous policy, then why did you and your
party stand on such a policy in the 1974 election?'' he taunted.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang later admitted: ''My party in the early
seventies was in favour of some kind of assembly and the Labour Party
was against it. They were right then. We were wrong then.''
The issue dominated the Commons as all the parties -- Tories, Labour,
Nationalists, and Liberal Democrats -- launched a new campaign about the
principles involved. It was the most intense exchange since the incoming
Thatcher Government repealed the Scotland Act in 1979.
Mr Major claimed Labour is running scared of the Nationalists with its
plan.
Labour believes that without devolution throughout Britain,
de-stabilising pressures will build up. But Mr Major counters that the
break-up of the UK is threatened by devolution. He intends to ram this
message home.
''The nature of devolution with a tax-raising assembly will place Scot
against Scot, Scot against Briton in other parts of the UK, leave
Scotland as the highest taxed part of the UK losing inward investment,
and Wales too, were they to have such an assembly,'' he said.
He insisted: ''Were Scottish MPs to be given the right to deal with,
for example, education and health in Scotland, it would not be proper
for them to come to this House and vote on education and health in so
far as England and other parts of the UK are concerned.''
Mr Blair hit back: ''Your anger is synthetic and after 15 years of
Conservative Government, 15 years of centralisation, of the quango
state, of anything and everything being run by unnaccountable bodies
stuffed with Tory placemen, it is time to bring government closer to the
people it serves.''
The Prime Minister retorted that Mr Blair did not even understand the
''West Lothian question'', and is unable to answer it.
This was first posed by Mr Tam Dalyell in his opposition to the
Callaghan government's devolution Act. He intends to re-raise the
central dilemma presented by Scottish MPs being able to vote on English
matters without reciprocal powers for English MPs on Scottish matters.
Scotland's handsome representation at the Commons with 72 MPs would
have to be reconsidered if there were a full-blown Scottish parliament
with legislative and tax-raising powers. ''Until you find a credible
answer on that,'' said Mr Major, ''it is no good you going back a
quarter of a century and digging up, in a mistaken way, old policies.
You know you are wrong.''
Labour sharply reminded the Tories that in the 1992 General Election
more than 75% of Scots voted for parties offering change.
Earlier Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said Labour plans would
strengthen, not weaken, the Union, and the SNP cheerfully declared it
sees a devolved parliament as a stepping-stone to full independence.
Liberal Democrat Menzies Campbell, MP for Fife North East, announced
he was to present a Bill for a Scottish parliament to the Commons next
week. It would set up a parliament of 125-175 members, to be elected for
a four-year fixed term by proportional representation, with its own
Prime Minister and government.
