HEARTS' chairman Chris Robinson will meet with a group of his
corporate customers to discuss the departure of the club's commercial
manager Charles Burnett. The outcome could be a withdrawal of support
for the Tynecastle side.
Burnett left Tynecastle on Friday after 15 years with the club, and
some members of Hearts' sponsorship lounges, are unhappy. Their anger at
Burnett's departure will be emphasised by three leading Edinburgh
businessmen who hope to meet Robinson tomorrow.
They will be representing around 100 members of the executive and
business clubs, who form the hard core of the club's corporate turnover.
It is thought they have been less than charmed by the number of
departures from Tynecastle.
Sandy Clark, who was manager, and his assistant Hugh McCann were
sacked last summer within days of the catering tycoon's takeover from
Wallace Mercer. Months of wrangling followed before Clark, now assistant
manager at Hamilton, and McCann eventually secured a settlement offer.
More recently, club accountant Gary Hay was dismissed and his case is
due to be contested by an industrial tribunal in Edinburgh in the next
two weeks.
Perhaps inevitably, Burnett's departure will be seen as another step
away from the old Mercer regime, but Robinson said the commercial
manager's leaving was a business decision.
Robinson added that he will be delighted to meet with the group of
businessmen. ''I am always happy to meet Hearts supporters,'' he
stressed.
However, there are also murmurings of further unrest on the playing
front in addition to Maurice Johnston's expensive and controversial
exile in the reserves.
Manager Tommy McLean still sees the immediate future dealing in modest
transfer market moves, rather than working with the extensive cash
budget he anticipated after replacing Clark, and McLean can't be too
happy about the frugal nature of his position.
* JACK Charlton's Republic of Ireland squad was yesterday reduced to
the bare minimum of 16 for tomorrow's clash with England in Dublin after
Ray Houghton became the latest player to drop out injured.
Charlton has now called up Tranmere's Liam O'Brien -- having
discovered that his first standby choice Mike Milligan is also injured
-- for a game that will be watched by a 46,000 sell-out crowd at
Lansdowne Road, but is fast losing its credibility as a meaningful full
international friendly.

'The best thing for me was the
response from the players. It was
a trying week for them.'
IT had been, said Roy Aitken, a ''trying week'' at Pittodrie after the
sacking of team manager Willie Miller, and so his enjoyment of the
victory over Rangers must have been tinged with relief.
After all, this was Aitken's managerial debut and it had arrived for
the one-time Celtic and Scotland captain some time after several of his
contemporaries. He must have looked on from his place in the wings at
times wondering just when he would get his chance.
Tommy Burns is in place at Celtic, Alex McLeish is at Motherwell, and
his old mate Mark McGhee is battling relegation from the Premiership at
Leicester. Now, at last, Aitken has joined their numbers . . . and he
did so with some style.
To achieve victory over champions Rangers is one thing. To do it as
convincingly as Aberdeen eventually did gave the new man in charge
reason for celebration.
However, Aitken has been around the game long enough to realise that a
single result -- even one gained against Rangers -- is not an antidote
to all the ills whice have besieged the Pittodrie dressing room this
season.
It is, however, the chance of a new beginning for the players, for the
much-criticised board, and for Aitken himself who, of course, hopes to
make his stay in the manager's office a lengthy one.
Yesterday, sitting in that office, he mused over Sunday's game and the
others which lie ahead of him.
''I approached the game against Rangers as positively as I could,'' he
insisted. ''Basically that is the way I do want to play the game. I am
not as naive to think that we can attack in every game, nor that we can
throw everyone forward without thinking about what is happening at the
back. That makes no sense.
''But I played most of my football with Celtic, and entertainment was
always seen as a priority there. I believe that will always remain an
essential part of my own beliefs about how the game should be played.
''I wanted to try to put Rangers under pressure and that did work for
us. I didn't see any point, for example, in putting a player out on to
the field with the single role of stopping Brian Laudrup.
''For one thing it probably might not have worked because Laudrup has
so much talent, such great ability. I looked for something else to
combat him, because I thought that was best. Maybe I was lucky it worked
out that way.''
There was more than luck though, in the way the players responded to
the pre-match challenge laid down by Aitken. He told them bluntly that
he wanted them to give him their best shot. They did and intriguingly
players who have not been doing that over the previous weeks and months
suddenly found the desire to perform again.
Stephen Wright demonstrated that he still has the qualities which once
saw Scotland manager Craig Brown tipping him as a future captain of his
country. Ray McKinnon showed a combative steeliness which has not been
much in evidence since he left Dundee United. Eoin Jess, playing wide on
the right, displayed the skills which have made him a Scotland regular.
And Duncan Shearer, well, he did what he is best at, he scored a
spectacular goal.
Aitken would not individualise on performances, but on Jess he did
point out: ''He is a quality player who can play in a number of
positions. I used him out there because I know that he can pass the ball
intelligently and cross it dangerously. He is also able to get goals
from there.
''I accept that there are people who might see his best position
somewhere else. It may be that I will use him elsewhere in other games.
I have options with some of the players, alternative roles, and I'll be
using these options.
''The best thing for me was the response from the players. It was a
trying week for them and for everyone at the club. While outsiders
looked on and said that playing Rangers meant there would be less need
for motivation, I knew that we were going out to face good players. Sure
the lads would be up for it -- but they had to show that they were good
enough to win against the best team in the country.
''They did that and now they have to keep going. I don't want any
reaction. You know the kind of thing where a new man takes over and you
get a couple of decent results and then players drop back into bad old
ways. This is something for all of us to build on.
''In any case if we dropped below the standards we set on Sunday we
could be in trouble at Ochilview. I saw Stenhousemuir beat St Johnstone
and they have kept this tie at their own ground because they fancy their
chances. That should be warning enough for our players.''
Of course, if that does not provide the necessary alarm bells for the
Pittodrie players then a growl or two from Aitken should be enough to
ensure that his career as a manager continues on a winning run.

IT'S strange the way the best of intentions can come back to haunt
you. The management of the New York Rangers ice hockey team may be
feeling that way, especially as their only intention was to curb the
strong language that came, almost as a tradition, from one section of
their fans' seating in Madison Square Garden.
The Rangers first began their crusade back in 1989, when they
instigated a guest relations patrol, burly members of staff who would
wander around the upper decks of the Garden and threaten to eject those
spectators whose language became a little too colourful.
The scheme seemed to work, as what has always been one of the most
boisterous crowds in the sport quickly became more renowned for their
ebullience than for their expletives.
But this season, the management committed a glaring error which may
have set the clean-up campaign back a few notches. Once the players
returned to the ice after many games were cancelled because of a
contract dispute, the Rangers' officials decided to enliven their
matches with a ''name the player competition'' taking place during stops
in the action.
The Garden's giant scoreboard would fill in with computer graphics
gradually to reveal a well-known player's face. All the while, the song
''Who Are You?'' by The Who would blare in the background.
The competition was a great success until someone among the management
suddenly realised that, at one point in the song, the lead singer, Roger
Daltry, bellows: ''Who the f*** are you?'' Covering their tracks,
Rangers' officials cancelled the competition until an abridged version
of the song could be produced.
Inevitably, the fans preferred the original.
Grappling with the sexes
EQUALITY for women in school sporting activities has been a hotly
debated issue in the USA for many years. These days, the consensus is
that the same opportunities to compete should be made available to both
sexes.
So, where sports like soccer, American football, and wrestling were
once the exclusive domain of the boys, slowly but surely the girls are
encroaching on to that once private turf.
Evidence comes in many forms. One such indication was the State of New
Jersey's first all-female inter-school wrestling competition, which took
place recently.
All of the competitors were aware of the significance of the occasion,
a fact that generated fights that were especially intense. Amy
Perlmutter, from Manchester Regional High School, was one of those
particularly inspired by the occasion. She pinned her opponent to the
mat and then announced: ''I was pumped up for this fight. I didn't want
to lose to a girl.''
It's back to base tricks
RICHARD Griffin was the publicist for the Montreal Expos baseball team
for the past 22 years, but now his tenure has come to an end.
Finally realising that here was a man with a true way with words,
Griffin was lured to the Toronto Star to work as a baseball columnist.
Based on his past record, readers can be assured of some sparkling
lines.
Take, for example, the time that the Los Angeles Dodgers arrived in
Montreal for a rarely-played afternoon game. The Dodgers featured among
their stars Ramon Martinez, while the Expos fielded their own Dennis
Martinez. Griffin exhorted fans to attend the game by writing: ''Be with
us for the return of the two-Martinez lunch.''
On another occasion, also against the Dodgers, the Expos' enigmatic
Peruvian pitcher, Pascual Perez, was on the mound when the Dodgers'
manager, Tommy Lasorda, ordered that Perez be searched for any foreign
substances he might be using to alter illegally the flight of the ball.
Griffin was outraged. ''That's not fair,'' he announced. ''Pascual is a
foreign substance.''
Judd makes the grade
IF Judd Kessler has his way, the rules governing scoring in high
school and college basketball will soon be up for review.
Kessler is a 12-year-old high school player from New York who is
obviously as concerned as his coaches that players should not compromise
their studies by their on-court pursuits.
He offers a simple suggestion. Make the point value of each basket
equal to the player's grade points average (the ongoing means by which
students are graded). So, if a player with a GPA of 3.8 scores from the
floor, that would be the value of his basket.
Of course, Kessler's proposal would significantly alter the face of
the game. A team under pressure with just seconds remaining might not
bring on their towering power forward, but instead send for their
ultimate deterrent: the kid from the chemistry club with the 4.0 GPA.
Kessler is enthusiastic about his idea, but he has got an ulterior
motive. ''I want to play basketball when I get to college, but I'm not
that great. I am pretty smart, though.''

SHARPLY higher producer prices last month have provided the strongest
indication so far that inflation, far from being a dead duck, remains a
force that needs to be tamed.
The gravity of the situation can be gauged from two salient facts.
Factory gate prices, excluding food, drink, tobacco, and petroleum,
sported their largest monthly increase since January 1991 when the
economy was locked in recession.
Moreover the annual rate of increase in input prices, industry's
materials and fuel costs, is now in double figures and at its highest
level since November 1986.
The acid test comes tomorrow when retail sales and inflation figures
for January are published. A headline rate of 3.5% and an underlying
rate of 3% are being forecast.
January's producer prices, published yesterday, were much worse than
expected on every single measure of inflation. The City took the news
badly.
The FTSE-100 share index nosedived through the 3100 mark it had only
attained on Friday, and short-sterling futures were discounting 8.5%
base rates by the end of the year and over 9% in 1996. Though Wall
Street was steady in European trading hours the Footsie lost 28.8 points
to 3081.1.
The data constituted the most worrying set of inflation indicators
since the economy moved out of recession. Hopes that the interest-rate
cycle might be close to its peak have proved decidely premature.
The Bank of England, which has set the pace in forcing three 0.5%
rises in base rates since September, will have its hand strengthened in
the determination of monetary policy now that its inflation concerns
have come home to roost.
Factory gate prices, which the Bank regards as a significant guide to
the future path of prices in the High Street, jumped by 0.9%, pushing
the annual rate up from a revised 2.8% in December to 3.4%. The City had
been expecting a month-on-month increase of 0.7% and an annual rate of
3%.
The better part of 0.4% of the rise was attributable to the excise
duty increases imposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke, in his mini Budget to replace the second stage of VAT on
domestic power, which Parliament voted down. The Central Statistical
Office said that prices of petroleum products had risen by less than the
estimated excise duty changes.
January is also the month when manufacturers tend to review their list
prices, but the strongest indications that factory gate inflation is
getting out of hand come from the seasonally adjusted index, which
excludes food, drink, tobacco, and petroleum products.
Here the monthly increase was 0.5%. The year-on-year rate bounced up
from a revised 2.9% to 3.4%. Worse, the three-month on three-month
annualised rate was 4.9%, against a revised 4.7% in December.
This short-run measure has been flashing warning signs in recent
months. It is still indicating that the annual rate of factory gate
inflation has further to rise, perhaps to over 5%.
Input prices jumped by a further 1.3%, seasonally adjusted, taking the
annual rate up from a revised 9.2% to 11.5%. The City had expected a
rise of 0.4% on the month and an annual rate of 9.6%.
Commodity prices rose sharply throughout 1994 as the recovery in the
world economy gained momentum. The January input data reflect the lagged
effect of commodity price increases coming through.
There has been profit-taking in commodities in the last 10 days in
response to an unexpected increase in the US unemployment rate, but the
January increases in input prices has still to feed its way through to
the factory gate.
The impact of rising raw material costs on manufacturers' margins has
been cushioned by falling labour costs achieved through strong
productivity gains against a background of historically low pay rises.
But productivity growth is likely to slow and pay increases pick up.
Ahead of this process manufacturers seem be exploiting buoyant demand at
home and abroad to increase their margins.
James Capel's Adam Cole was not surprised that this should be taking
place, given that capacity utilisation was well above its historic
average.
Indeed the Treasury explicitly conceded the point. ''The recent
increases in output prices reflect some feed through of commodity prices
and some expansion in margins. Strong competition and a good labour cost
performance led to low inflation and export success in 1994. We need to
maintain this as the recovery continues.''
Tomorrow's inflation figures will be closely studied for further signs
that retailers are passing on factory-gate price increases, especially
in areas, such as household goods and clothing and footwear, where
discounting was aggressive in last year's sales.

BRIAN O'Neil, the young Celtic defender who began the season wondering
if his future lay away from Parkhead, made a return to the international
scene yesterday.
Scotland team manager Craig Brown called O'Neil into his B squad for
the game against Northern Ireland at Easter Road next week and then held
out the promise of future promotion. He also suggested that a step up to
the full squad could be more immediate than anyone would expect.
The 22-year-old is one of the players from Brown's own quite recent
past as coach for the Youth and Under-21 teams. Like the others who have
graduated by that route, he holds a special place in Brown's thoughts.
The accomplished O'Neil, who has been shuttled between attack and
midfield and now, finally, defence with Celtic, has emerged as a serious
contender to play against Russia in Moscow next month.
Brown still maintains that Motherwell veteran Brian Martin is first in
line for that opportunity. Yet he adds: ''Brian O'Neil has been very
impressive and he is a European type of centre half.
''In the Youth teams and the Under-21 side we could use him in
different positions. Yet when we had that run to the semi-finals of the
European Under-21 Championship Brian was played at the heart of the
defence, where he could start attacking moves for us.
''Now, Brian Martin is first in line for a chance, because he missed
out on the last game in Athens, when he was injured. But O'Neil oozes
class and, if he continues his current form, I would have no worries
about using him in Moscow.''
O'Neil joins Martin and Hibs' Darren Jackson as the serious candidates
for the European Championship clash at the end of next month.
Brown had complimentary remarks to make on how Stephen Wright --
another of his personal proteges -- performed against Rangers and hinted
strongly that he could ultimately replace his club skipper, Stewart
McKimmie, in the Scottish side. Not, though, for the time being.
The other members of next week's squad is a mix of younger players and
others with experience. The form shown by Motherwell, five players,
Hibs, three players, and even Kilmarnock, with two players, indicates
the manager's thinking.
He was left without Anglos because of club games, and the same applied
to Hearts and Rangers men, who play their Scottish Cup tie at Tynecastle
just 24 hours earlier. Scotland B squad:
Brown (Kilmarnock), Cameron (Raith Rovers), Dodds (Aberdeen), Henry
(Kilmarnock), Jackson (Hibs), Lambert, McCart, McKinnon, Martin (all
Motherwell), McGinlay (Hibernian), O'Donnell, O'Neil (both Celtic), Rae
(Millwall), Tweed (Hibernian), Walker (Partick Thistle), Woods
(Motherwell), Wright (Aberdeen).

THE SRU are to change their disciplinary measures, and might even copy
their English counterparts by introducing red and yellow cards for
referees in rugby matches next season.
Martin Scott, the Dunfermline player who moved to England, last month
became the first person to receive the red card, but he was subsequently
exonerated after an appeal.
''The International Board has been experimenting with them,'' says SRU
Refereeing Development Officer Ian Goodall, ''and if they feel that
further experimentation is needed next year then we will have them in
Scotland.''
Allan Hosie, the former international referee, and now an SRU
representative on the International Board, agreed. ''We will wait to see
how the English get on, and then decide for ourselves,'' he said. ''For
instance, one of the advantages the English have in their big games is
neutral touch judges. However, even that has caused problems, as in last
week's international, when Derek Bevan, the referee, did not give the
yellow card after his touch judge had flagged for an offence. And yet
the only reason a touch judge can flag is for foul play. A yellow card
should have been shown.''
Many have doubts over the use of coloured cards on rugby pitches,
arguing that they play to the crowd, potentially hazardous in rugby
which prides itself on having less abuse of referees than many other
sports, notably soccer.
Harassment of referees by spectators is hardly new, but Sunday's
referee who took charge of the match between the Scottish and Irish
women at Myreside was subjected to a constant stream of abuse from a
small section of the crowd that was an embarrassment to the game.
Another incident, which occurred during a second XV game between
Hillhead/Jordanhill and Glasgow Academicals on the previous day, may
also have repercussions. Exchange referee Colin Rigby, from Stewart's
Melville, is alleged to have been verbally abused from the touchline
throughout the game.
''These guys have no place in rugby,'' says Rigby. ''I think that it
is becoming worse lower down the level in rugby, with ignorance of the
laws the main reason for spectators becoming unhappy with referees.''
Goodall also confirmed that no longer will SRU disciplinary committee
members be asked to vote over the telephone on the length of punishment
for specific offences, the average then being used. Now, three men,
Charlie Ritchie, Allan Hosie and Lorne Crerar, will deal with all
offences in a specialist capacity.
Perhaps they should also get Crerar to deal with any troubles arising
from spectators. Refereeing a Dundee derby some years ago, he was
subjected to a tirade from one paying customer who insisted on
attempting to describe the referee as ''a poofter.''
Unluckily for the spectator concerned, Crerar's then girlfriend was,
during a lull in the play, able to tug the offender's sleeve and say
loudly: ''Oh no, he isn't.'' That was the end of the problem, as the
red-faced spectator left the conflict altogether.

<HEADLINE>Scot who plays for pay A French revelation in rugby wages war</HEADLINE>

A SCOT playing for the French first division side, Mandelieu, has
claimed that he is paid #800 a month -- in direct contravention of
rugby's amateurism regulations.
The revelation by ex-Hawick and Scotland under-21 wing forward, Kevin
Campbell, will add further fuel to the shamateurism fire after the
admission at the weekend by Toulouse president, Rene Bouscatel, that his
players receive fixed payments and win bonuses.
Scottish Rugby Union chief executive Bill Hogg said yesterday that
32-year-old Campbell's claim would be investigated and, if proved, the
case would be taken up with the International Board and the French Rugby
Federation.
Campbell, now hooker for Mandelieu, has been in France since 1986,
when he met French lock Jean-Charles Orso while on holiday in Cannes.
The introduction was arranged by Hawick clubmate and former Scotland
captain, Colin Deans.
The expatriate Scot, whose brother Alister was a member of Scotland's
1984 Grand Slam side, maintains that the club game in France is now
openly semi-professional with players paying state taxes on earnings
above #6000 a year. He says that French internationalists are paid
around #2500 a month by their clubs.
He told The Herald: ''Some clubs pay wages, some pay bonuses for a
win, and others pay living expenses. When I was with Nice, they paid for
my apartment, but now with Mandelieu, I get #800 a month. Elsewhere, the
payments range from about #400 a month to #2500 for the top players.
''I don't see that there is any point in lying about it. It is common
knowledge. Across here, top-grade rugby is viewed as a second profession
and nobody even bothers to hide the fact that the players are paid.
''I don't consider myself to be a professional. Until recently, I was
running a restaurant, but I have given that up. I'm an accountant, but
not working, and so I suppose I am unemployed. The money that I make
from rugby doesn't make me a full-time professional.''
He added: ''The French club game is well financed. Money comes from
local authorities and sponsors. Mandelieu's annual budget is around
#500,000. Bigger clubs like Toulouse are on budgets of more than #1m.''
Players from the UK have been involved with the French club game for
years. England's Rob Andrew was recruited by Toulouse and currently
Scotland lock Damian Cronin plays for the French second division
Bourges.
Campbell's claims -- and those of Bouscatel, which are to be aired in
a BBC Scotland documentary on Thursday night -- merely underline
long-held suspicions about French rugby. But they have come at an
embarrassing time for the game as Scotland prepare to take on France in
Paris on Saturday.
He added:''I've no doubt that the SRU will be in touch with me, but I
am doing nothing out of the ordinary so far as the French game is
concerned. If action is taken against me, then they would have to look
at other British players who have been involved here.''
Yesterday, the SRU chief executive said that Saturday's international
match at the Parc des Princes was not in jeopardy, but the latest claims
would be investigated and, if shown to be correct, the union would
expect a satisfactory response from the FFR.
The SRU is still committed to the principle of amateurism, but there
is on-going discussion as to how the term could be redefined to allow,
for instance, a player to add to his off-field earning capacity by
endorsement contracts.
Meanwhile, the SRU announced yesterday that the crackdown on
Murrayfield black market hospitality packages is to be stepped up with
''illegally sourced'' warning notices being placed on seats for the game
against Wales on March 4. The union still reserves the right to eject
people from the stadium and a final decision will be taken in the week
leading up to the Welsh match.
The SRU is offering an amnesty to supporters who have already bought
Welsh match tickets on the black market. SRU head of finance Graham
Ireland said: ''I'm delighted by the response from ordinary rugby
supporters, who are sending us details of illegally sourced tickets that
have been sold to them.
''This has encouraged us to offer an amnesty to supporters in
possession of tickets for the Wales match sourced from agencies or
unofficial operators. We will replace these tickets with official match
tickets, allowing us to take action against the suppliers.
''The amnesty also applies to those who have already sold on their
tickets. These seats will be clearly labelled to indicate that the
person occupying that seat is in breach of the ticket conditions.''
THE Scottish Rugby Union announced yesterday that Scotland's rugby
world cup squad of 26 players will be selected on March 21, with a
public announcement two days later.
The tournament takes place in South Africa from May 25 to June 24 and
Scotland's pool partners are France, Ivory Coast, and Tonga.
* THE SRU has also confirmed, as revealed in The Herald yesterday,
that the Scottish Districts v Irish Provinces series will not go ahead
next season. SRU chief executive Bill Hogg expressed surprise that the
news had broken in the media in advance of an official announcement.
* WESTERN Samoa, who tour Scotland and England next winter, will play
the Scots at Murrayfield on November 18. The tourists also will play
Scotland A at a venue to be arranged, Edinburgh District on November 8,
and North and Midlands District on November 14 or 15.

THE romance of the cup has taken on new meaning at Celtic Park, writes
James Traynor. Anyone who wants to mark Valentine's Day by doing
something different can buy one #15 ticket and get another free for
Celtic's Scottish Cup tie against Meadowbank at Hampden on Saturday.
''This offer is for male and female Celtic supporters alike,'' said
Celtic's chief executive, Fergus McCann, only recently returned from his
own honeymoon and clearly still full of the joys. ''Bring your Valentine
for free,'' he intones.
Steady boy, steady. Think about this for a moment Fergus.
Football fans are among the most resourceful people in the land and
the thought of a ticket free of charge is bound to have the bhoys
scheming.
As their real valentines are left wondering where their best frocks
and high heels have gone, there could be a strange crowd indeed
teetering up to the Hampden turnstiles come Saturday. There is a fair
chance there will be some burly and stubbly-chinned damsels hanging on
the arms of blokes looking rather sheepish.
Two for the price of one? It's got to be worth it, especially since
the chances of being rumbled are pretty slim, which is more than the new
''girlfriends'' are likely to be.

CRICKET'S world governing body last night launched an investigation
into bribery allegations after former Australian captain Allan Border's
admission he was offered money to throw a Test match.
The International Cricket Council have demanded further information
from the Australian Cricket Board over Border's claims that he was
offered a bribe to allow England to win the fifth Ashes Test at
Edgbaston in 1993.
Border's allegations come only two days after ACB chief executive
Graham Halbish confirmed several players had experienced similar
approaches during Australia's tour of Pakistan in October and November.
0
Border spoke to reporters in response to newspaper reports which
claimed an unidentified former Pakistan Test player offered him #500,000
to lose the match.
''I was a bit angry at the time, but I have not thought about it much
until it has come up again over the last couple of days know.''
In a further twist yesterday, former Pakistan captain Mushtaq Mohammad
admitted to a light-hearted conversation with Border in the Edgbaston
dressing room during the 1993 Test, but expressed surprise that the
affair had suddenly blown up.
In a radio interview, Mushtaq said: ''I jokingly passed a remark and
said 'What happened? Did somebody offer you big money? What are you
going to do?'
''He said 'I have never messed with my cricket?'. I said 'Fine, that's
good enough for me. Well I'm glad we have played our cricket at a time
when it was clean and proper.' Now a lot is being said in the paper that
Allan Border is upset about what I said to him 18 months ago. It's a
farce. If he was that upset, why didn't he come out then and there?''
Sydney's Telegraph Mirror newspaper claimed the offer was made to
Border in sterling on behalf of a Pakastani betting syndicate.
Australia, needing 120 to win the match at the time of the alleged
incident, beat England by eight wickets to take a 4-0 lead in the
six-Test series.
Bookmakers William Hill, who quoted England at 7-1 to win the Test in
1993, noticed no unusual betting patterns.
Former Australian Test batsman Dean Jones has also revealed he was
offered #30,000 by an Indian bookmaker to disclose inside information
about the Australian side during the tour of Sri Lanka from
August-September 1992.
According to a report in Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald newspaper,
spin pair Shane Warne and Tim May were offered the same amount to
perform badly during last year's Test series in Pakistan.
But the allegations drew an angry response from senior Pakistan
cricket officials. ''We take serious exception to the fact that this
occurrence five months ago was not brought to the attention of the Board
of Cricket Clubs of Pakistan,'' said Javed Burki, chairman of the BCCP
ad hoc committee.

TRIPLE Joy can give punters something to smile about today in the
opening Reid Minty Handicap at Lingfield.
The filly has to give plenty of weight away, but has fully deserved
her spot on top of the handicap. She wound up last season with a hat
trick of successes.
Although her breeding suggests that a mile should be well within her
compass, it looks as if six furlongs is her ideal distance.
This view was borne out when Triple Joy, after leading from five
fulongs out until well inside the final furlong, was passed by eventual
winner Red Valerian and then the fast-finishing Ertlon over seven
furlongs a month ago. That was a Class A race and the opposition in this
affair does not look quite so testing.
Mentalasanythin was well backed here a week ago before running out a
convincing eight-length winner off top weight in an amateur riders'
handicap. He tries his luck again in the Reid Minty Stakes and could
take some catching.
On the same afternoon, Wild Rice stamped himself as probably a class
above the normal all-weather recruit when sauntering to a
three-and-a-half lengths defeat of Nuthatch.
Wild Rice certainly looked as if he could go on to better things and
he can retain his unbeaten record in the Reid Minty Conditions Stakes.
* LAST year's Champion Hurdle winner, Flakey Dove, looks to have run
her last race after banging herself on the gallops.

MCA Powerhouse Cardinals prepare for this weekend's Scottish Women's
Volleyball Cup semi-final with Hazlehead in the best possible frame of
mind. MCA defeated Whitburn 15-6, 15-3, 15-0 in the league on Saturday
and, remarkably, won the final 23 points in the match.
Coach Vince Krawczyk speaks highly of the squad he had to remould last
summer after the loss of Norwegian internationalist Maiken Areskjold,
the Belgian Sigrid Adams and the influential Maura Housley.
''I rate this team above the one that won the league and cup double
last year,'' says Krawczyk. ''We are now preparing for our tenth cup
semi-final in a row and we've been in the last five finals.
''We're hoping that Saturday's match with Hazlehead will bring us
closer to Provincial Insurance's record of eight finals in a row.''
In Saturday's other semi-final, Grange aim to become the first third
division team to reach the final when they take on Rucanor Jets.
0 Outdoors, former Whitburn player Audrey Cooper continues to make
money from the beach game. With her English partner, Amanda Glover,
Cooper finished equal ninth in the beach tournament in Chile.
The Anglo-Scottish pair beat Chile II 15-0 and Japan II 15-8 before
going down 15-8 to the USA. They were rewarded with $1500 and gained
valuable world ranking points before next month's World Beach
Championships in Brazil.

THE Scandinavian connection, enigmatic and paradoxical as any film
from that country, stretched from Gran Canaria to San Diego with the
victories at the weekend of a complete unknown in Swede Jarmo Sandelin
and of Peter Jacobsen, an American of Nordic descent who has suddenly
resurrected a career which, by the most sympathetic of descriptions, was
becalmed in a sluggish sea.
In Europe Swedish players have, over the past 10 years, reached a
healthy level of competence and arrived in considerable numbers. Yet
until Sunday only five of them had collectively won 11 tournaments --
Ove Sellberg and Anders Forsbrand, with three each, Mats Lanner and
Per-Ulrik Johansson, with two, and Joakim Haegmann, with one.
So far, too, Haegmann has been their sole representative in the Ryder
Cup team, not as of right on points but through his selection by the
captain, Bernard Gallacher. Still, Sweden's achievements so far -- not
forgetting those in amateur golf -- are a reasonable return for the
considerable funds, much of them government-sourced, invested in the
country's golf.
Sandelin, aged 27, certainly qualifies for the category labelled as
''having risen without trace.'' In his only previous year on the
European Tour, in 1992, he finished No.191 on the order of merit, and he
qualified for this season by taking the last but one of the first 10
places on the Challenge Tour's money list.
Moreover, his three previous performances this winter did not suggest
the capability of giving none other than Severiano Ballesteros six
strokes of an advantage with only 14 holes to play and beating him by
one stroke.
Ballesteros, although disappointed not to have gained his fifty-fourth
European victory since 1976, believes that his prize of more than
#21,000 has assured him of his eighth Ryder Cup appearance. He now has
333,422 points, almost 129,000 ahead of the next player on the list,
Bernhard Langer.
''It is good for all the best players to qualify automatically, to
give Bernard more choice with his two selections,'' Ballesteros said.
Since the qualification process began last September Ballesteros has won
one tournament, been second three times, and had three other top-10
finishes in eight outings.
By comparison with the Spaniard's numerous appearances in the match
against the United States, Jacobsen, within a month of his forty-first
birthday, is on course to play for his country for the first time since
he joined the US Tour 18 years ago. It would be fitting if this outgoing
and genial personality had his career properly rounded off.
Having finished eighty-eighth and seventy-seventh on the last two
money lists and having won the last of his four tournaments in the 1990
Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Jacobsen, like Sandelin, confounded all
expectations by taking the past two events in successive weeks -- the
AT&amp;T National Pro-am at Pebble Beach and the Buick Invitational at
Torrey Pines.
These results have confirmed how wide the catchment area of winners on
both tours has become. Moreover, probably because the players of mature
years are fitter for longer than they used to be, the mellowness of
their ages is no longer a barrier to the winner's enclosure.

AS SCOTLAND'S squad start their run-up preparations for the assault on
the Parc des Princes hoodoo on Saturday, it might do them no harm to sit
through the television tape of the entire match at Colombes Stadium in
1969, when the last win in Paris was achieved.
That would indicate how even gifted Frenchmen can be thwarted by the
total dedication of their opponents to keeping the door shut with cover
and tackling out of the top drawer. It also might stir the troops
further in confidence and mettle if James William Telfer supplied some
back-up descriptive comment in his own distinctive style. He might even
smile at the memory.
He not only captained Scotland to that extraordinary triumph but
scored the match-winning try four minutes into injury time, a score that
brought from a certain television commentator an uncharacteristically
hysterical shriek, not, as many thought, of biased delight but of pure
shock at Scotland getting out of jail in one of the great escapes of all
time. Scotland had been so outplayed that, during Telfer's half-time
talk to the troops, a disgruntled French supporter in the stand asked if
he was holding a team talk or a service of thanksgiving.
France should have won by a barrowload but were denied by one of the
most incredible displays of grit and commitment to field coverage and
tackling ever seen. That included such unforgettable sights as
tight-head prop Sandy Carmichael crashing the flying wing, Jean-Marie
Bonal, into touch at the corner and lock Alastair McHarg getting across
to turn the other wing, Andre Campaes, into the Scottish cover.
The main lesson of that 1969 miracle still applies -- keep knocking
them over. As the French have just suffered much physical frustration at
Twickenham, a few clattering Scottish tackles early on could prove a
strong psychological factor in creating that sinking feeling of ''Mon
Dieu, not again.''
Perhaps the most important tackles will be those that can check big
French forwards short of the gain line. That applies especially to their
formidable loose forwards, Laurent Cabannes, Phillipe Benatton, and,
perhaps most dangerous of all, Abdelatif Benazzi. Thus the sharp edge of
their initial assault could be blunted, with fewer opportunities
accruing for rippling ball transference. Time and again sizzling,
high-speed French tries have stemmed from initial forward assault
followed by lightning, wide transference to the aristocrats in wake.
Tackles, punts, and drop goals might make appropriate headlines in the
Scottish battle plan, but there must be care in punting. Misdirected
kicks are as meat and drink to adventurous Frenchmen. Even in the
confined running areas of the modern game, the French still conjure
segments of magical interplay and often from improbably deep positions.
Hopefully, too, Craig Chalmers will celebrate coming within three caps
of John Rutherford's Scottish record for a stand-off of 42, by taking
his drop-goal expertise out of his locker.
The French are notoriously parsimonious in the concession of tries.
Indeed in their past six championship games at Parc des Princes they
have scored 18 tries and leaked just one. On their past three Paris
visits, total Scottish pointage has comprised four penalty goals and one
drop goal.
French defence has the benefit of impressive pace in both forward
engagement and retreat running. So a drop goal or two from the Chalmers
boot (he landed seven on the Lions' tour of Australia in 1989), could
prove tremendously encouraging to Scottish morale and determination,
especially if Gavin Hastings also is striking his goal-kicks with
precision. Scotland's captain has a rich haul against France of 78
points in nine appearances.
Of equal importance is that Scotland's aged warriors -- Hastings,
Chalmers, Ken Milne, Damian Cronin, and Iain Morrison -- should play
their part in encouraging the initiates for the peculiar stresses
inherent in performing at Parc des Princes, where the atmosphere is just
as chilling and intimidating as anything at Cardiff Arms Park.
Apart from collective glory the Scots can do their captain a huge
favour. He is fed up of hearing the broadcast of that Telfer try in 1969
as a reminder of how long it has been since Scotland won in Paris. In
that the great man is far from being alone.

THE plan for a national golf centre, hailed to be ''the home and heart
of Scottish amateur golf,'' is back on the tee 14 months after it was
first announced. Balbirnie Park, in Fife, which has been the site under
detailed examination, was rejected on Sunday by the 16 areas of the
Scottish Golf Union, who also threw out the idea of a full-blown centre
complete with accommodation.
The SGU's four-man ad hoc committee, whose first choice of Loch Lomond
was voted out in favour of Balbirnie Park, have now been given a remit
to look again at possible sites for the lesser model.
That, under the original vision, still would include offices for the
new SGU headquarters, currently based at Barnton, Edinburgh, lecture,
video, locker and medical rooms, gymnasium, driving bays, pitching and
putting practice areas, and a few full holes of golf adjacent to an
existing or planned high-quality course. That might cost in the region
of #1m, half the original estimate, which had included purpose-built
basic accommodation for up to 36 people.
Where the centre might eventually be -- and when -- is anyone's guess,
though it might be reasonable to speculate that only a central Scotland
venue would win a majority vote. None of the three voted on previously
-- Balbirnie Park, Loch Lomond, and Craigtoun in St Andrews -- fitted
that bill. My crystal ball is mysteriously showing the names of
Glenbervie, already home of the Scottish PGA, and the slightly less
favourably located Dalmahoy.
While the SGU have completed the full circle, there are some positive
signs to be taken. In passing Go and collecting #200, or in their case
#400,000, the sum put aside resulting from last year's increase in per
capital levy from #2.40 to #5, there are no financial difficulties. This
figure is likely to double from this year's subscriptions and increase
further through possible grant aid from a variety of local, national and
European sources.
There is also agreement on the need for such a centre where a year ago
there was controversy. A series of SGU roadshows in the interim went a
long way to persuading their 200,000 affiliated golfers of the need for
such a venture to step up the current coaching efforts being made at
both St Andrews and Inverclyde and to bring standards in Scotland back
into line with other European nations, who have forged ahead in recent
times.
Dr George Gormley, the SGU president, said yesterday: ''We appreciate
the co-operation of Balbirnie Park before and during preparation of the
feasibility study, but must now take a step back and consider sites for
the modified scheme.
''We initially looked at 26 sites for the full scheme, including
accommodation, and while many of these were not appropriate at that
stage some might now be capable of hosting the area's preferred option.
In addition to these sites, we would still like to hear from clubs and
developers who could work with the SGU in planning a national golf
centre.''
The ad hoc committee of the SGU will now consider which of those 26
sites and any new locations would be the preferred sites and will report
back to the executive with their recommendations. Thereafter, the
consultative process will proceed to a vote by the areas as to which
site merits further detailed investigation.
That sounds worrying in the camel-is-a-horse-designed-by-committee
stakes, especially when compared to the English Golf Union's comparably
clean-cut decision to buy Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire lock, stock and
barrel for #8m.
The ad hoc committee -- comprising Douglas Rae and Douglas Dalglish,
the last two SGU presidents, Ernest Barnard, the current senior vice
president, and co-opted member Ian Skillen -- last night met to roll the
dice once more. Their next move is in three weeks'time.

MAYBE they will have to lie down and admit defeat before the end of
the season, but no-one at Firhill is giving any credence to that
prospect yet and, if any side is capable of extricating themselves from
what appears a desperate situation, Partick Thistle have to be the ones.
In their time, they have managed to get out of more tight corners than
Nigel Mansell and a few clubs have discovered already that they can be
stubborn opponents when they are up against it.
Hibs were the latest to underestimate the ability of Thistle to work
unceasingly until the final whistle and, if Dundee United are at all
careless at Firhill tonight, they will be the next to go down to the
Maryhill lot.
That will be relevant, of course, only if this rearranged premier
divsion game takes place. Four times already it has been postponed and,
although no inspection is planned, if the rains come down today it could
be dicey once more.
But, as ever, Thistle remain optimistic about everything, a fact
illustrated by their manager, John Lambie's admission yesterday that
they were genuinely annoyed at having to miss premier action at the
weekend when they were due to play Motherwell.
''My players were desperate to play.'' he said. ''After the Hibs game
they were on a high, and in any case we don't want to fall behind with
our fixtures and face a pile-up. It wouldn't do us any good.''
The fact that both these teams have had to sit idle recently means
that others have slipped futher ahead of them in the table and leaves
these them bottom and second bottom respectively.
United would put daylight between themselves and the bottom club if
they win and, as a consequence, leap into seventh place. Thistle, on the
other hand, could reel in the main body to within one point if they can
overcome United.
Thistle have everybody fit and available. United, whose captain,
Maurice Malpas, would not have been able to play on Saturday, has
recovered from a calf injury, are having a close look at a player with a
good reputation from Portugal, Rui Esteves, midfield man from Benfica.
Esteves arrived in Scotland at the weekend to be given a trial period
by United manager Ivan Golac, who has already signed one man from the
Portuguese league, Sergio. The player was recommended by a former Red
Star Belgrade player, who is now a coach with Benfica.
Esteves has not been able to command a regular Benfica place but is
reputedly wanted by other, less well off, Portuguese teams.

AIRDRIE assistant manager John McVeigh yesterday wondered how long
clubs could remain full-time in the first division, his thoughts
prompted by the scenario that if Airdrie and Dunfermline win this
evening, they will join Dundee and Raith Rovers on 47 points at the top.
One team only is certain of promotion, another will be involved in a
play-off with the second-bottom side in the premier division, and
McVeigh said: ''Surely there is a place for all four in the top league.
I hear people talking about how we should consider the future of the
game. But the major question is how it will help football if clubs have
to switch from full to part-time.''
He added: ''The price of failure in the first division is too great.''
Airdrie's Paul Jack and Tom McIntyre are added after suspension, but
midfielder John Davies remains doubtful as they meet his previous club,
Clydebank, at Broadwood.
Dunfermline have Marc Millar and Tommy Harrison suspended, and
probably send out the side which beat Dundee as they face bottom club
Stranraer, who are without Darren Henderson and Billy Ferguson, at East
End Park
Stranraer manager Alex McAnespie admits that his side's task is made
harder because it is a midweek game.
''We are the only part-time team in the division, and it is a
disadvantage when players have to work all day and then switch over to
playing such an important match,'' he said.
St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock still plans a couple of changes as
a follow-up to the cup defeat by Stenhousemuir, when they meet Hamilton
at McDiarmid Park.
Stenhousemuir midfielder Max Christie is looking forward to one of the
biggest weeks ever for the club.
Christie, previously with Meadowbank and Dundee, is now an influential
player for the second division leaders -- who have his father, Terry, as
manager. They visit Brechin tonight in the league and then look forward
to their sell-out Scottish Cup tie on Saturday against Aberdeen.
Christie yesterday spelled out the success secret when he said: ''We
are disciplined, organised, and have great spirit. We have experience in
defence, we work hard in midfield, and have two of the fastest strikers
in the league in Miller Mathieson and Gareth Hutchison.''
In the third division, Albion Rovers' new manager, Jimmy Crease, gets
a second chance to look at his players as they visit East Stirling.
Crease, who took over on Friday, has had a busy weekend. ''I have been
contacting those whom I know in both the senior and Junior game looking
to strengthen my playing squad. I would expect to include a couple of
trialists.''

MANCHESTER United star Eric Cantona is to take legal action against
ITN for defamation, and violation of his privacy.
The Frenchman, already under police and Football Association
investigation for his feet-first assault on a fan during a match at
Crystal Palace last month, is alleged to have mounted a similar attack
on ITN reporter Terry Lloyd.
Cantona had been confronted by the news team while holidaying with his
pregnant wife and son on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.
''Eric Cantona and his family are the object of unacceptable abuse,''
said his lawyer Jean-Jacques Bertrand. He also hinted that legal action
would be taken against any other television station or newspaper using
pictures of Cantona with his family.
The infamous Selhurst Park incident led to a club suspension for the
remainder of the season and an indefinite ban from the French national
team, but Old Trafford manager manager Alex Ferguson yesterday backed
his beleaguered star over the latest allegations.
''To film without permission a man's six-month pregnant wife in her
swimsuit sitting on a beach is deplorable,'' said Ferguson, who sent
Cantona away to try to escape media attention. Any husband worth his
salt would react and this ITN interviewer has got off lightly in my
view.''
Meanwhile, Cantona, also fined #20,000 by his club, will have a date
with the police when he returns from the Caribbean later this week.
Officers were said to be infuriated when he failed to accompany
club-mate Paul Ince to south London for questioning last week.

JACK Charlton's Republic of Ireland squad was yesterday reduced to the
bare minimum of 16 for tomorrow's clash with England in Dublin after Ray
Houghton became the latest player to drop out injured.
Charlton has now called up Tranmere's Liam O'Brien -- having
discovered that his first standby choice Mike Milligan is also injured
-- for a game that will be watched by a 46,000 sell-out crowd at
Lansdowne Road, but is fast losing its credibility as a meaningful full
international friendly.
From his original 22-man selection Charlton had already lost
Manchester United's Roy Keane, Gary Kelly of Leeds, Tranmere's John
Aldrige, Motherwell's Tommy Coyne, and Bolton's Jason McAteer before
Aston Villa veteran Houghton yesterday withdrew with a calf injury.
Charlton said: ''We are used to this kind of setback, particularly at
this time of the season when there are so many matches, but I still have
good cover in all areas.''

SCOTS have dominated the world indoor singles championship with six
wins in the past 13 years but are still without a success in the pairs.
Richard Corsie and Alex Marshall took a step nearer ending the run by
beating New Zealand's Andrew Curtain and Rowan Brassey in four sets to
reach the last eight of the #132,000 Churchill Insurance-sponsored event
in Preston yesterday.
The Scots began with a 7-0 whitewash but had to haul themselves back
from 1-5 before snatching the second by 7-6. They surrended a 6-3
advantage in the third as the Kiwis recovered for 7-6 and then moved 5-0
ahead in the fourth. But the Scots picked up the seven shots they needed
over the next four ends.
Their quarter-final opponents will be Welsh pair Stephen Rees and John
Price, who ended the Scots' hopes at the same stage last year.
East Lothian's Graham Robertson and his Scots-born partner, Hong
Kong's Mark McMahon, won a three-and-a-half-hour marathon against
England's Greg Harlow and Mervyn King 6-7, 7-5, 1-7, 7-5, 7-4. That put
them through to a quarter-final clash with six-times former winners Tony
Allcock and David Bryant.
Also through are Ireland's Roy Battersby and David Corkill.
* EAST Lothian surrendered their hold on the CIS Insurance Scottish
Indoor League title at the weekend despite ending their section
programme with a 91-68 win over Bainfield. East Lothian needed to beat
their rivals by 43 shots to pip them for a final spot. Results:
Division 1, Section A -- Auchinleck 95, Nithsdale 65 (G Speirs 32, S

ANDERS Limpar spoiled Tony Cottee's glory night with a late equaliser
that left both West Ham and Everton seriously threatened by relegation.
Limpar ended his 11-month wait for an Everton goal with a strike in 80
minutes to rob former Goodison forward Cottee of revenge for being shown
the door in September.
Cottee snapped up two vintage goals in the mud and rain of Upton Park,
Paul Rideout equalising in between, to put West Ham within reach of
victory, but Limpar had the last word in the 2-2 draw.
The man who eventually built up a cult following at Highbury has had
just as difficult a time establishing himself with Everton. He has
hardly started consecutive matches since his #1.6m move north in March,
1994. He had to be content with a substitute berth at Upton Park, but
once Joe Royle had pushed him on in 69 minutes to replace Gary Ablett,
Everton always looked capable of snatching victory.

THERE may be no surprise selections in the Scottish Women's Hockey
squad to play England in two internationals at Lilleshall on February 25
and 26, but there is one noticeable absentee -- Margery Coutts, the team
captain for the past five years.
Coutts, a veteran of 96 internationals and a member of the Western
club which has dominated Scottish hockey for over a decade, has decided
to retire.
The 32-year-old, referring to Scotland's concentrated three-month
build-up to the European Nations Cup, said: ''I cannot give the time to
such a programme because of the commitments I have already as manager of
the Scottish under-18 schoolgirl side and my work.''
Her decision to stand down will surprise many in the sport,
particularly when she was so close to the magical figure of 100 caps.
That total would have been reached with comparative ease in Scotland's
build-up to the European Nations Cup in Amsterdam in June, even although
she would not have been available for all 13 friendly internationals.
But she never harboured such thoughts. Coutts was first and foremost a
team member. That philosophy was even carried through to Great Britain.
After having won nine caps, she was overlooked for the Barcelona
Olympics, but yet she was in the stands cheering them on to their bronze
medal.
She will be missed on the international scene, because Scotland has
achieved much under her captaincy. The fifth place won in the European
Nations Cup in Brussels in 1991 was Scotland's highest ranking in the
event.
This was one of the highlights of an illustrious career, but so too
were Scotland's feats in winning two Home Countries championships in the
past four years and the fact that Scotland have beaten England in the
last three internationals between the sides.
Coutts greatest legacy to Scottish women's hockey, however, is the
campaign she fought for them to be allowed to compete in the nations
cup, despite no funding being available.
Scotland went off to Singapore where they reached the final and then
advanced to the inter-continental cup in Philadelphia two years ago, but
while Scotland failed to advance from that event to the World Cup in
Dublin last year, Scotland now has a world ranking of 14. The squad to
meet England is:
Tracey Robb (Western Klick Photopoint), Sue Lawrie (Slough), Louise
Burton, Carrie Corcoran, Janet Jack, Fiona McInnes, Jill Messenger,
Diane Renilson, Rhona Simpson and Helen Walker (all Edinburgh Ladies),
Susan Fraser, Alison Ramsay and Pauline Robertson (all Bonagrass Grove),
Susan Gilmour (Heriot Watt University), Susan MacDonald and Ann Menzies
(both Western Klick Photopoint).

PRINCE Naseem Hamed yesterday proclaimed: ''Put your money on my
predictions.''
Hamed, who celebrated his twenty-first birthday yesterday, said:
''People can be rich if they listen to me. I've got the winning formula.
The only thing I cannot predict is the lottery, but my mum is working on
that one.''
The super-confident WBC international champion, who could be
challenging WBA super-bantamweight holder Wilfredo Vasquez in May, has
picked round three to demolish Argentina's Sergio Liendo at Livingston
on March 4.
And that is a bold selection as Liendo has never been stopped or
knocked off his feet in 49 fights, which include 41 wins. ''He will
probably go in three if plays his cards right. He will fall in the round
I've called,'' added Hamed in Mohammed Ali tones.
So what went wrong in his last fight against Armando Castro? Hamed
predicted the Mexican would fall in five, but did it in four and
explained: ''He got cheeky. I had to do it earlier.''
Hamed insisted: ''I am an exceptional fighter; I'll be the best
produced in this country. I am still a baby. I have had a lot of success
already. All I've got to do is keep my feet on the ground.''
Promoter Frank Warren has offered Vasquez $500,000 to defend against
Hamed in early summer. Vasquez is handled by the Acaries brothers of
France, and Hamed would not mind travelling to Paris for that big
chance, although home town Sheffield is the target site.
''A ring is a ring, a venue is a venue. It doesn't matter I will win.
I have got no problems. I will be world champion in 1995.''
Warren has already fixed April 22 as Hamed's next engagement and
added: ''Naz is 21 and now a man. Vasquez is the best champion around,
he's got the man's title.''
Commercial offers have been rolling in on the wave of Hamed's success
and growing television popularity. He will be involved in a video game
with a big company, while other endorsements are also in the pipeline.
Meanwhile, Johnny Armour will mark time on his conveyor-belt of
African challengers today while he waits for the bigger opportunities to
arrive.
The Chatham southpaw defends his Commonwealth bantamweight title
against South Africa's unbeaten Tsitsi Sokutu at York Hall, Bethnal
Green, perhaps reflecting on the fact that two prospective #60,000
purses for fighting Hamed and Ireland's Wayne McCullough never came to
fruition.
His manager, Mickey Duff, rejected the offer to fight Hamed as he did
not regard it as the right career move, and McCullough is currently on
course to challenge Japan's WBC champion, Yasuei Yakushiji.

GOOD paintings, visitor figures, sales, venue. The Glasgow Society of
Women Artists has struck it rich at the Lillie with an upbeat, enjoyable
show, its 160 exhibits full of colour and joie de vivre.
Flowers are a favourite; their structure so varied, complex, and open
to different interpretations. Ethel Walker's Hellebore reflects in a
silver tray; Anne Donald's muted Pink Roses sit in a square vase.
Elspeth Harrigan excels in botanical accuracy, while Anne Mendelow goes
for spontaneity, as does Laura Harrison with her geranium, Indian cloth,
and azelea. (Harrison, incidentally, has just completed a splendid
portrait of John Bellamy.) Graham and Ballantyne incorporate irises and
roses in their tabletop compositions; Dot Moir uses blooms as a basis
for batik. Pat Sharpe paints snowdrops; Mary Allan a lovely garden urn.
Landscapes are popular too. Dorothy Bruce shows a memorable Strathan
Strand; Ailsa Tanner paints a verdant Sweetheart Abbey; Anne Gordon a
dramatic White House. Helen Turner's Rhum is inspired by Cadell; Anne
Donald enjoys Cambridgeshire but Lilian McCaulay doesn't go further than
Baldernock for sunshine.
Commissioned portraits too often transform unlikely personalities into
saints, like Anne Mackintosh's soft-focus Michael Winner. Louise Annand
fares better from Priscilla Dorwood who docks a few years off her age
but stays true to character. Figure drawings are less dangerous. I love
Anne Anderson's gentle people. Hilda Goldwag's Father and Child is bold
and breezy. Monica Callaghan's X-Ray Soul and Sarah Sumsion's Sea
Objects are among the few abstracts, though Jila Peacock simplifies a
cup and flask. Lin Pattullo's Bowl of Cherries rightly wins the Lauder
Award and Harriet Whitson's gorgeous hats the McCreadie Prize.

BY sipping water between songs, Simon Keenlyside conveyed his message
that he was not in his best voice on Sunday night. But there was a lot
more that was wrong with his recital -- second in the BBC's new
Songlines series -- than that. By keeping his eyes fixed on his music
stand, he was about as communicative as a stick of wood.
Nor was the printed programme much help. In the absence of texts
translations, names of poets, or, from the singer, any sort of spoken
commentary, this was indeed a model example of how to sabotage a song
recital. Though Keenlyside, as Scottish Opera-goers are well aware, is
one of Britain's most promising young baritones, he did himself a
disservice by delivering his opening groups of Rachmaninov and Brahms
songs with such a lack of colour or beauty of phrasing. The sense of
strain on top and bottom notes could be forgiven in the circumstances,
but the absence of characterisation was more puzzling. Even that gifted
accompanist Malcolm Martineau sounded jerky and abrupt.
In Richard Strauss, whose music brought him a little closer to the
opera house, he continued to sound curiously detached. But in his final
American group -- Ives, Barber, Rorem, all sung lyrically in English --
he seemed at last to be getting somewhere. By a year from now this
recital may have developed out of recognition. Meanwhile listeners to
the broadcast on March 4 may hear it to somewhat better effect.

<HEADLINE>Windfall arable profits unlikely to be repeated</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>24</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979861655</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LAST year's windfall profits of up to 400% more for arable farmers are
unlikely to be repeated this year and more careful planning is needed
for future survival, according to a new report from the Agricultural
Development and Advisory Service (ADAS).
This should involve reducing costs of production, aiming for more
environmentally friendly farming and diversifying into non-food crops,
said Dr Julia Walsh, ADAS director general, at an industry seminar in
London yesterday.
Institutional support levels had taken on a high profile on the
political agenda. This pointed towards the need to move away from
dependence on this source of income, to form closer links with the food
industry and to develop more advanced systems of business planning.
Major winners last year were top potato producers with up to 400%
increases in profits, according to the report ''The Growing Business
1995''. For a typical 200 hectare mixed arable farm this could have
boosted income by #70,000. Profits for cereal growers grew by a more
modest 12%.
But neither sector could expect this to continue. Bill Hall, head of
the ADAS business consultancy, warned that potato producers were facing
tough times ahead. ''Next season's profits could fall just as
dramatically as they rose in 1994. In future only those who target a
chosen market and meet that market's requirements will achieve good
margins.''
Jim Orson, head of cereal development, delivered a similar warning for
this sector. The fall in cereals prices over the years had been offset
by cost reductions and yield gains and even in the coming year the
expected drop of #10-#15 per tonne would be largely offset by increased
area payments.
But he added: ''Market pressures will require even further cost
reductions and yield increases to be made. To remain competitive,
farmers will need to be able to grow feed quality cereals at or below
#80 per tonne.''
The opportunities for diversification into non-food crops looked
brighter, acording to Melvyn Askew, head of alternative crops and
biotechnology. ''The potential for plant-derived oils is enormous. The
UK alone uses over 750,000 tonnes of lubricating oils and greases per
annum.
''Currently most of these are processed from crude mineral oil but
many could be substituted by oils and greases of plant origin.
Industrial use of vegetable oils in the EU is already in excess of 1.7
million tonnes a year.''
The report also concludes that the prospect for any increase in the
market for organic produce continues to look poor.

SOME surprises awaited two Strathkelvin firms who reached separate
decisions to set out to achieve ISO 9000 quality certification. Until
then, they had only come into occasional business contact.
But when they began the process with Strathkelvin Enterprise Trust,
they found themselves often sharing the same table and discussing mutual
aspects of what was involved.
Now, amid congratulations, both have succeeded after a process which
began in the spring of last year.
David Murray (Non-Mechanical Plant) Ltd of Woodhead Road, Muirhead,
has achieved ISO 9001 certification through BSI. Baillie and Spence,
building contractors at Crowhill Road, Bishopbriggs, has been awarded
ISO 9002 certification through NQM.
Both had separate but firmly identified reasons while working towards
success.
For Murray Plant at Muirhead, their ISO achievement goes hand in hand
with the design and marketing of their new patented system of Multisheet
500 lightweight steel piling which is attracting worldwide interest.
The development has been described as the first major advance in
trench support systems for more than 20 years. Construction firms as
widely scattered as Austrialia, the United States, the Middle East and
Malasia, want the Multisheet system.
Established in 1974, now with a #2m a year turnover, the Muirhead firm
has steadily built a solid reputation for quality and reliability over
the years in specialised activity in hire and sale of non-mechanical
plant. Its activities cover all Scotland, much of it for the water and
sewage construction world.
''We made the decision to try to obtain ISO certification because it
seemed a logical step forward in seeking both potential future growth
and in establishing our credibility with overseas customers who had to
view us from a start point situation,'' said managing director David
Murray. ''At Murrayplant we started off with several things in our
favour, including a loyal, carefully chosen and trained staff.
Quality manager John Brady's first task was to explain to staff
exactly what would be involved and what it was hoped the benefits would
be. In some areas, Murrayplant found that procedures already in place
only required fine tuning. In others, some procedures had to be changed
to meet the ISO requirements.
''We were aware too that ISO certification does not end there and that
standards set have to be constantly maintained,'' said David Murray.
''But although it meant considerable work at times we are delighted at
the way success has brought congratulations from so many of our
customers.''
At the same time as that process was underway, Murrayplant's design
engineers were hard at work in association with Swedish Steel,
developing their revolutionary new Multisheet system. The new patented
lightweight piling system, now manufactured by Ayrshire Metals at
Irvine, involved an initial investment of #100,000 -- ''A lot of money
for a company of our size.''
The system was born as the result of a discussion David Murray had
with his team in their search for a new approach to piling problems.
''We came up with a more manageable system which is unique. A single
steel sheet, cold rolled into shape, can cover a wide range of
groundwork applications. The formed sheet has the strength of a pile and
equals other light piles of twice its thickness.''
''Our Multisheets system is already in use at work at Glasgow Airport,
at the Beatson oncology department at Glasgow Western Infirmary and in
several other major UK projects. An Australian company, wanting the
system for work out there, has already sent an engineer to Stepps to
receive training in its use. France and Germany want to produce
Multisheet for themselves -- it can be every bit as good as heavy piling
in many applications and can save up to 50% of costs.''
Stronger, lighter and less expensive than previous systems, Multisheet
seems set for considerable worldwide success.
It is one more reason why David Murray sees his firm's achieving ISO
certification as of major importance both now and in the future.
For Baillie and Spence Ltd of Bishopbriggs, building contractors, who
specialise in the construction of petrol filling stations, the decision
to seek ISO quality certification was the result of a careful study of
how best to ensure the firm's future strength and growth.
''It became clear to us that in the year's ahead more and more of our
key customers, the oil companies, would look for that qualification,''
said Mr Andrew Spence, the firm's managing director. ''Constructing new
filling stations has become a highly technical operation and we want to
ensure our continued place at the leading edge of what is involved.''
When the firm started some 21 years ago it was basically a jobbing
joinery concern with only six employees and worked mainly in the Stepps
area. It then became a general building firm and 15 years ago an
opportunity arose to become involved in petrol filling station
construction.
Today, a key force of 30 employees are involved in building new
filling stations all over Scotland for several major oil companies.
Costing on an average around #750,000, each filling station takes
between 10 and 12 weeks to complete. To date, Baillie and Spence have
built several dozen throughout Scotland.
''Modern filling stations require much built-in technology,'' said
Andrew Spence. ''We have teams of specialists who go out from here to
new locations all over Scotland and occasionally into the North of
England. By the competitive nature of the oil industry these contracts
often have to be carried out at very short notice.''
When Baillie and Spence started on their ISO trail one of the first
tasks tackled was to explain the reasons to employees on those scattered
consruction sites. Then the preparing of procedures manuals and other
required steps got underway, a member of the office staff, Avril
Kilcullen, being appointed quality manager.
''Although we were pleased to find that much of what we did was
already in line with what was required there were other areas where we
had to introduce changes,'' said Andrew Spence. ''We also invited
suggestions from our employees, got a good response, and included some
of these.''
At times the total volume of preparatory work required was more than
had been expected. But in a surprisingly short time the Bishopbriggs
firm realised that in addition to improving efficiency the new
procedures were saving them money.
''On the one hand, we had become much more efficient in several day to
day ways, being able to identify any snag that might turn up and why it
happened, then take steps to ensure it wouldn't happen again. On the
other hand, we discovered we had a new and very accurate checking system
on things like plant which had been hired, on materials, and on
costings. Hired plant no longer lies on site any longer than is
necessary, wherever that site may be.
Congratualations on the award have come in from their oil company
customers, from suppliers and from other firms associated in their
general activities as building contractors. The ISO crest is to be
featured on their vehicles and letter headings.

OPERA on a Shoestring have scored another winner with their
semi-staged production of Mozart's Cosi fan tutte. The problem with
concert performances is that they can have the tendency to drag. This
version did take time to settle, but they soon established a good
balance between comic frivolity and dramatic tension.
Musical director Martin Fitzpatrick's pacing was appropriate to the
situation, allowing the words to speak and the music to breathe. Not an
easy score to reduce at the keyboard, Fitzpatrick made an excellent job,
alternating between piano and harpsichord.
Of the cast of six it was the men who dominated the musical action.
Graeme Danby, as the philosopher Don Alphonso, brought his customary
humour to the role and demonstrated once again that he has a voice to be
reckoned with. Equally impressive was young baritone Robin Greenway as
Guglielmo. Commanding stage presence and a rich singing voice suggest a
career in the making.
Tenor Campbell Russell wasn't entirely relaxed in the role of Ferrando
but in male ensemble passages the balance was superb. Of the ladies,
Frances Morrison as Despina brought the most pleasure. Her
interpretation of Una Donna quindici anni was animated and soulful, and
disguised as both the doctor and the lawyer she revealed a versatile
dramatic personality.
Christina Dunwoodie's Fiordiligi and Theresa Goble's Dorabella were
well rehearsed, the emotional high point coming in their first-act trio
with Alphonso -- Soave si il vento -- phrases soaring with ease and
simplicity.
One little grumble. If Opera on a Shoestring are to serve as a
stepping stone to the big stage, then shouldn't the performers be
learning their parts. Maybe the scores on stands will be removed for the
forthcoming production of La Traviata for this year's Mayfest.

MURRAYPLANT and Baillie and Spence are two of the first companies to
go through qualification for ISO 9000 certification assisted by
Strathkelvin Enterprise Trust.
''These separate companies, going through the process at much the same
time, experienced common areas of training for almost 80% of that
time,'' said Mr Mike Lindsay, quality administration manager at
Strathkelvin Enterprise. ''Application and commitment on the part of
both managements and staffs throughout the training and implementation
phases was exemplary throughout''.
In some ways it was also new ground for Strathkelvin Enterprise. In
the case of Murrayplant, where a design company was included which was
not strictly marketing a product, even the British Standards Institute
agreed that it had not received an application exactly like that before.
A new programme to match had to be prepared.
''It was impressive to note the way in which staff with both companies
kept on with their normal day's work while meeting the new ISO
requirements,'' said Mike Lyndsay.
''From our viewpoint, it was also another illustration of the way in
which the structured approach to quality training and on-site support
offered by the Strathkelvin Trust once again proved to be an excellent
way of enabling companies to achieve this prestigious award in a cost
effective way.''
The programme, he said, not only offered expert training and support
but through the Trust's partnership with Dunbartonshire Enterprise and
Strathclyde Business Development it enabled the cost of certification to
become more attractive.

FARMERS in the north-east have demonstrated their confidence in the
ANM Group -- whose core business is Aberdeen and Northern Marts -- by
increasing their financial support for the farmer-owned co-op.
The society's members' loan scheme, launched last year, has already
attracted investments of #600,000 -- repayable at 30 days notice and
currently offering interest at 6.75%. Members have also increased their
shareholding during the past year by #112,000, taking the society's
share capital to a record #1.13m.
The annual report, due to be published next month, is expected to show
a ''very acceptable'' level of performance but will not match the
exceptional trading profit of #1.39 million achieved in 1993. Chief
Executive, Brian Pack, forecasts that the principal results will be well
received.

LEADING animal welfare organisations say they are determined to stamp
out abuse at Scottish livestock markets, and they say farmers should be
much less reliant on the live marketing of their livestock.
Speaking following last week's BBC Scotland television programme which
depicted scenes of abuse of stock in several markets, Mr Jim Morris, the
chief executive of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, confirmed that the society's inspectors would be keeping a
special eye on all markets this week.
Mr Morris added: ''The whole system of livestock marketing is verging
on the archaic and it hasn't changed all that much since the days of the
drovers. The entire approach needs to be upgraded and I think there
should be much closer links between the end buyers and the producers.''
A similar view is held by Compassion in World Farming which, through
its legal director, Mr Peter Stevenson, commented: ''I think it is much
better if animals can be consigned directly. There is clear evidence
that all too often animals are brutally handled in markets. When
informed that all Scottish markets have at least one member of staff
responsible for animal welfare, Mr Stevenson said: ''The law is not
working. We in the UK are deluding ourselves when we say that we have
the best standards of animal welfare in the world. It may be better than
many but it's still not good enough.''
Electronic auctioning was first introduced to the UK from North
America five years ago and at the time it was claimed that the system
would be less stressful for livestock. However, despite the fact that
there are as many as six different systems now open to farmers, the
number of stock sold is very marginal compared to the traditional
outlets.
According to figures published in the farming press for the week ended
Tuesday, February 8, only 2488 steers, heifers and young bulls were sold
in total by all the various systems against a total UK slaughtering of
almost 47,000 head. In plain terms, only 5.3% of cattle are now being
sold electronically.
Mr Morris believes that electronic auctioning could help the image of
the industry but he added: ''I am in favour of studying it further but
it's not quite as simple as some people make out. For example, we
don'tknow how the animals are picked up because there will be no
supervision as there is in markets by our inspectors. And again some of
the journey times could be very long especially if stock is being picked
up in areas like the Highlands.''
However, it seems as though the livestock industry will be forced to
consider its options more closely because it is an open secret that the
welfare lobby, especially the more extreme elements, are set to target
markets and abattoirs if and when they succeed in their current campaign
to ban live exports.
Mr Stevenson made that clear when he said: ''The only thing that is
stopping us just now is the sheer lack of personnel but rest assured we
aim to stamp out any abuses in markets.''

Families head for the cemeteries, taking food and drink, like a
picnic. And having fun. Mary Brennan is introduced to an alternative way
of death
THERE is no gesture in ballet, or in modern dance, that means
mother-in-law. But that's not to say you can't tell stories about them,
or about the effect they have on others.
Choreographer Kim Brandstrup is quite clear about what works and why.
For the chapter and verse of narrative, it's as well to stick to words
-- ''Facts belong to language,'' is how he puts it. ''But it's true that
you can interpret things clearly and powerfully in terms of movement.
You can tap into the emotional undercurrents and personal conflicts that
are so familiar to us whether the context is Shakespearean tragedy or
television soap opera.''
The themes he explores most consistently -- and to acknowledged effect
-- are love and death. In a work like Saints and Shadows, made last year
for his own company, Arc Dance, he drew on recollections of an earlier
tour to Mexico. He describes arriving on All Souls' Day -- known there
as The Day of The Dead -- to find ''skulls. Thousands of skulls.
Everywhere you looked. These great, grinning skulls. And families going
to the cemeteries, taking food and drink, like a picnic. And having fun.
You would see statues of the Madonna and ghetto-blasters side by side at
the graves of people's ancestors -- and everywhere this strange
lightness, this sense of fun.''
This was certainly not how people looked on death and remembrance in
his native Denmark, nor indeed in England, where he trained as a
dance-maker and is now based. ''I found myself thinking that, over in
Mexico, they had a very concrete way of dealing with afterlife. That in
among the innocence of all the fun, there was a mature acceptance of
death that isn't so common in our part of the world.''
The difference in attitudes fascinated him. People's behaviour is a
mainstay of his work, after all -- not merely what they do, but how they
reveal themselves in the tiniest of gestures, the subtlest of glances.
With Saints and Shadows, Brandstrup presents an audience weaned on
funereal glooms and solemn, dignified mourning with an alternative way
of death. The world on stage will resonate with the colours and rich
imagery of Latin American culture, and with the music too -- a warm mix
of mamba, salsa, and merengue rhythms.
''When the curtain goes up, I want the audience to see this world on
stage and be drawn into it,'' says Brandstrup. And that holds true not
just for Saints and Shadows but for his other works. There's an art to
story-telling, and setting the scene can't be left to chance -- or worse
still to a bare stage and the random inventions of the audience. He and
his regular team of collaborators -- composer Ian Dearden, designer
Craig Givens, and lighting designer Tina MacHugh -- share this desire to
create fiction, imaginary worlds and universes which are humanly
appropriate. But done -- he stresses this -- in a simple way.
''It can't be too clotted: theatrical flourishes certainly, but not
the big, empty, grandiose things. The great, overstated gestures that
pass for story-telling in some ballets. My concern is for detail.
Significant, telling detail. It's the tiniest movements that are
important, that draw the audience into the story, pull their
concentration into the work.''
This urge to focus audience attention, to have them zoom in on moments
of movement, harks back to his time as a film student at the University
of Copenhagen. His subsequent move into choreography -- he trained at
the London Contemporary Dance School -- was inspired, he says, by
Hollywood musicals!
It's tempting to attach a film angle to Orfeo, the other work Arc
Dance are performing at Edinburgh's Festival Theatre tonight. Like
Cocteau (with his celebrated Orphee of 1949), Brandstrup has relocated
the familiar myths in another era and introduced some of his own twists
to the tail. Again, the audience are presented with an imaginary world.
This time -- nodding in the direction of Gluck's opera -- it's a Baroque
terrace where the formality, austerity even, of the period is shot
through with the dramatic tussle over Eurydice's life with Death very
much the predatory games player.
The choreography dips into mannerisms and steps from the eighteenth
century, sets them beside freer contemporary movements, takes a gesture
from classical dance here, the everyday flick of a glance there. The
result is a piece which has true emotional clarity and immediately
recognisable meaning.
''It's about body language. People are picking up signals from each
other all the time,'' says Brandstrup. ''They can read moods, reactions,
from the way someone looks at them, from how they turn to go, even from
how they stand still. What I do is find the right body language for the
characters and their emotions.''
The word for this, in anyone's dance terms, is talent. Which is why
his Orfeo won an Olivier Award in 1990 and why, increasingly, his work
wins audiences and critical praise world-wide.

THE CRISIS of confidence at S G Warburg, one of the City of London's
leading securities houses, has claimed the job of chief executive Lord
Cairns, the architect of the abortive plan to merge with Morgan Stanley,
the major US investment bank.
Lord Cairns resigned after an emergency board meeting on Sunday called
to determine how Warburg should react to the crisis. The chairman, Sir
David Scholey, will be chief executive as well as chairman. Sir David
originally masterminded the integration of Warburg's merchant banking
and securities operations. He had intended to step down in June, to be
succeeded by Lord Cairns.
Warburg's shares have been weak ever since the Morgan merger plan fell
through. Their initial reaction yesterday was to plunge from Friday's
close of 726p to 670p, but this prompted speculative support and they
closed 18p lower at 708p.
Failure of the merger left the group drifting without a clear sense of
direction which swiftly undermined morale leading to staff defections,
the most spectacular being the departure of the bulk of the equity
syndicate desk to join Morgan Grenfell, which is owned by Deutsche Bank.
Lord Cairns took the blame for the failure and decided a clean break
was needed. So he has severed all connections with the group which he
joined 16 years ago.
Warburg warned that its investment banking results were still being
affected by a difficult market environment, though 75% owned Mercury
Asset Management was up to expectations. The comment prompted analysts
to scale back their profits' forecasts.
''Our first task and highest priority is to revitalise investment
banking profitability, taking decisive and substantial action to
increase our revenues and reduce our cost base,'' declared Sir David.
This is likely to include operational cutbacks. The group has already
quit non-sterling bond markets and withdrawals from other areas could
follow. Closing the Japanese presence could save a lot.
General staff cuts would only accentuate the loss of morale and the
haemorrhaging of prized staff. The first step Mr Scholey has taken is to
appoint an investment banking executive committee, which observers
consider is the return of the old guard.
Several new directors have joined the board and more will join at the
annual meeting in June, when a number will retire in the normal course
of events.
Lord Cairns is in line for a large payoff, though not as much as his
last #1.5m pay cheque might suggest as #877,000 of this was
performance-related bonuses.
Warburg put out a reassuring statement proudly listing its
achievements, notably its leading position in the league table of
takeover advisers. But its current problems will quickly undermine its
reputation so Sir David will have to act swiftly to improve morale,
though Lord Cairns' departure may help in this.
Decisions will also be required on longer-term strategy as the group
is clearly not going to establish leading international positions on its
own.
Without a clear sense of direction the group will be even more
vulnerable to a bid, though Sir David said they were not in merger talks
with anyone. Whether he can provide the leadership that Warburg is
crying out for remains to be seen.

SPECULATION increased yesterday that the Fosters brewing group is
close to a decision on whether it will sell its Courage subsidiary in
the UK to Scottish &amp; Newcastle or else float it off as a wholly separate
company.
That was after Fosters chief executive Ted Kunkel said in Melbourne
that the Australian parent acknowledged that something had to be done
and that it had to get a resolution to its in-going involvement in the
UK. He added that he had nothing to say at present but Fosters knew the
market extremely well and also the strategic options.
However, nothing will be done until the Office of Fair Trading
completes its newly started investigation into the pricing differentials
between supplies to tenants and the free trade of up to #100 a barrel.
That should take no more than three months.
Courage increased net profits last year by 17% to A$118m (#56m) but
by24% in sterling terms.
It has increased market share with volumes rising by 2.4%.
Overall, Fosters' net profits after tax fell 3% to A$203m in the six
months to December. Courage is one of the most aggressive players in
both the free trade and the supermarket off-licence sectors. Its
supplying of pub companies is one of its major growth points.
It has a market share of about 18% compared with S&amp;N's 13%. Scottish
and Newcastle has a target of an overall UK penetration of 20%. The
Edinburgh-based company would be prevented by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission from buying the whole of Courage.
However, there has been persistent talk that either Whitbread and
possibly Allied Domecq could take a proportion of the Courage operations
to leave three companies with a market share of about 20% and strong
enough to fight Bass at 23%.
Paradoxically this is the reverse of the position when Fosters as part
of Elders tried to buy S&amp;N but was seen off by the MMC.
A flotation is complicated by the complex relationship with Grand
Metropolitan on the joint ownership of the Inntrepreneur Estates chain
of 6000 pubs. There is the issue of how many of these will become untied
from Courage as the supplier in the event of a sale.
But anything between 2500 and 4500 may be freed which would depress
brewers margins as pub owners could buy where they wished and also give
further opportunities to the pub companies. Overall, the industry would
prefer a break-up of Courage. S&amp;N would benefit from taking over some of
Courage's assets by having a much greater exposure to the south of
England.

SEAN O'CASEY's drama about the Easter 1916 Dublin uprising is a
fascinating play.
It manages at once to be specific and universal, to be a comedy and a
tragedy, to engage in complex political dialogues and yet maintain the
form of robust popular theatre, and to embrace not only the intimacy of
a tender love scene but also the broad social picture of a nation at war
with itself.
Aided by the vibrancy and loquacity of the Irish idiom, O'Casey's
language dazzled without ever seeming erudite, his colourful insults
stingingly hilarious, his prose poetically phrased and his arguments
dynamic and quick-witted.
The play focuses on the great conflict of church, nationalism, and
socialism that erupted in the Easter uprising and proceeded to dog Irish
politics from then on, and yet it appears as much to be a character
drama of tenement life.
For a contemporary Scottish audience it still has important things to
say about the romantic lure of nationalism and the headstrong rush
towards freedom at any price.
Joe Dowling's Irish production is an assured and vigorous
interpretation, handling the clatter and bustle of a cramped
working-class home at its most frenetic with the same control as the few
scenes of quiet repose.
Standing out in a forceful ensemble are Anita Reeves as Mrs Gogan,
mischievous more than malicious but always treading a thin line between
being loathesome and lovable, and Antoine Byrne, who gives a devastating
performance as Nora Clitheroe, robbed of her baby, her husband, and her
sanity.
The strength of the production lies in its celebration of life; the
tragedy of the play is in the slow but steady encroachment of death.

I HAVE a simple question for Ian Lang. Name one government in history
-- capitalist or communist, feudal even -- which has raised taxes or
allocated resources on a strict and consistent per capita basis?
In his Sunday TV interview, the Scottish Secretary put a sky-high
price on home rule. An extra 19p in the pound on the basic rate of
income tax, to be precise. That, argues Mr Lang, would be the cost of
replacing Scotland's present disproportionately generous share of UK
Government spending, were we ever to get our own parliament in
Edinburgh.
Setting himself up as the only effective defender of Whitehall
largesse, the Scottish Secretary paints a stark vision of a future
British Chancellor treating the creation of a devolved parliament in
Edinburgh as his opportunity to cut back Scotland's bean allocation to a
strict skull count. ''We would be powerless to stop him'', wails our man
in the Cabinet.
Suffering, as I suspect many Scots do, a mounting sense of ennui as
our constitutional options are re-rehearsed for the umpteenth time, I am
not about to get into an abstruse debate about the validity of Mr Lang's
sums. Who puts what into the UK pot, and who takes what out and why, are
devilishly complex questions. Deciding what share 8.8% of the UK
population occupying a third of the UK land mass really deserve is just
as big a teaser, especially when you start factoring in demographic,
social and other complex considerations.
But I do want to challenge the basic assumption which underpins Ian
Lang's blatant scaremongering. In matters fiscal, ''everyone contributes
the same, everyone gets the same back'' is not a principle which has
ever held sway in the capitalist west. Old-style communist regimes paid
lip service to the latter half of the equation. But, as we now know,
even that egalitarian veneer was a cruel facade.
Governments of every hue have eschewed the equal shares approach to
raising revenue and to spending it again for one very simple reason. If
that was all that governments did, what would be the point of electing
them in the first place? Governments, even those which want to cut back
the role of the state and champion market solutions, must believe they
bring some added value to the process of taxing and spending, otherwise
Ministers and MPs would all pack up their bags and go back to insurance
broking or wherever else they came.
Suppose the preliminary conditions for Mr Lang's bleak vision were to
come about. Scotland has its parliament. Under what conditions would an
incoming UK administration propose a strictly per capita funding
settlement for Scotland?
That administration would have to be hostile to devolution and,
presumably, passionate in its support for the Union. On current form,
that means it would be Tory. It might claim to be responding to popular
pressure in the south. It certainly couldn't claim historical precedent.
But, if a future British (and Tory) Chancellor did lop the best part of
#3000m from Scotland's public expenditure budget, the end result is
obvious.
Constitutional mayhem, precipitating the sudden end of the very Union
that party claims to cherish. It doesn't sound like practical politics
to me. But, why bother about that if your main aim is to get a
discordant soundbite into someone else's great debate.
When he's finished scaring the pants off Scots on what home rule will
cost them, Mr Lang might turn his attention to another tax and spending
issue, in my view even more important than what fiscal settlement a
future Scottish parliament might expect.
Last week the Joseph Rowntree Foundation published the results of its
major inquiry into income and wealth in Britain. The main findings --
identifying a deepening divide between rich and poor in Britain in the
1980s, with income inequality reaching a post-war record -- have
received extensive coverage. But the underlying issues raised take us
back to the fundamental question of what added value governments bring
to the process of taxing us and spending our money.
Throughout the 1980s, the Thatcherite objective was to tax less, spend
less, and spend it more effectively. It didn't quite work out that way.
We pay less income tax. But more on VAT and National Insurance. The
Major Government still struggles to keep its total spending in check.
But in the process, as the Rowntree inquiry shows, a lot of people have
still been badly hurt. The poorest 20% to 30%, it warns, are not
benefiting from rising national prosperity.
A core part of that eighties agenda was to liberate and reward
individual enterprise. In the most dramatic instances -- the boardrooms
of recently privatised utilities inevitably spring to mind -- the
strategy has been spectacularly successful.
But there is a price. As Howard Davies of the CBI, a member of the
Rowntree inquiry, was pointing out last week, an emerging underclass,
disenfranchised from economic prosperity, is going to cost the rest of
us more and more, through benefits, the health service, and the criminal
justice system.
We could, of course, adopt the American approach, crack down on
welfare spending, consign the underclass back to the ghettos and, as
they do in cities like Houston, protect our own prosperity behind razor
wire security fences and restricted-access shopping malls.
The Rowntree inquiry team, including Davies, argues for a more
civilised alternative, targeting future tax cuts on the lower paid and
investing in a package of measures to raise living standards among the
poorest. That is not the Major Government's agenda. It still plans
pre-election tax cuts for the haves and a tougher line on benefit
claimants and other have nots.
The alternatives could not be more stark. They deserve a great debate
of their own. But neither answer, Mr Lang may care to note, owes
anything to equal shares all round.

MISYS has made an agreed #202m bid for fellow computer software
supplier ACT which will lead to the formation of a worldscale British
company with a substantial share of the global market for banking
technology.
Chairman Kevin Lomax said yesterday that part of the reason for the
proposed merger was the high cost of research and development which
accounts for about 12% of Misys turnover, or about #10m a year.
Misys shares plunged 49p to 360p while ACT, the former Apricot
Computers, leapt 31[1/2]p to 108p. The offer of 300p cash and 2.2 Misys
shares for every 10m ACT values each ACT at 109p.
The Misys share price fall is partly because ACT shareholders will end
up with 45% of the enlarged company.
Misys saw interim pre-tax profits improve 40% to #11.25m while at the
end of November, it had #35m net cash. After the takeover, there will be
debt of between #30m to #35m although interest will be covered over 20
times by profits.
The deal is not totally unexpected as there were discussuoins two
years ago although it was soon discovered that both the timing and the
values put on ACT were not right.
However, talks resumed last month after ACT had issued a profits
warning that the year's outcome would be considerably below market
expectations.
Its chairman Roger Foster welcomed the proposed merger and said he was
keen that the company would remain British.
He is remaining as a consultant for the next year although all other
ACT dirctors are leaving and their service contracts will be honoured as
will share options which could cost altogether over #3m.
Mr Lomax explained that ACT had allowed profit projections to get too
far ahead under previous management which had affected its research and
development programme as the company was forced to pay out too high a
dividend. ACT shareholder income will fall by a quarter after the
takeover. He added that if he had his way, Misys would not pay any
dividend as is the pattern for American technology stocks but that would
not be appropriate in Britain.

AVERAGING around one acquisition a month for the past year, Stakis
yesterday announced its latest deal -- the #1.5m cash purchase of two
casinos in Bournemouth.
The Glasgow-based group, which is now concentrating on its hotel and
casino interests, will take over the businesses of the Norfolk Casino
and Victory Sporting Club subject to the granting a new gaming licences.
They were previously owned by Hamblin Leisure Services.
The clubs will be amalgamated and installed in the recently purchased
Stakis Bournemouth Hotel, bought only four months ago for #7.6m as part
the group's aggressive expansion plan. The latest purchases take the
group's spending -- mainly on hotels -- to around #45m in the past year.
Refurbishment of the seafront hotel is currently underway and the
integration of the casino is not expected to be completed before May
next year and the cost will total around #1m.
Most of the 97 casino staff will be retained and some new jobs are
likely to be created with the expansion of the bar and restaurant area.
''This is a unique opportunity for Stakis to create an attractive new
and much larger casino designed to meet the more discerning needs of our
customers,'' chief executive David Michels said.
Mr Michels and outgoing chairman Lewis Robertson have been the
architects behind the revival in fortunes of Stakis which was on the
brink of collapse only two years ago with debts of almost #200m and
losses of #45m.
They decided to hive off the nursing homes, bars and steakhouse
businesses to concentrate on the hotel and casino side. Their efforts
appear to have paid off with latest profits almost doubling to #20.2m.
Stakis now has 38 hotels and 23 casinos throughout the UK. Two weeks
ago it bought the Westpoint Hotel on the outskirts of East Kilbride in a
#4.7m deal.

INVESTMENT capital group 3i yesterday launched an initiative to help
the major companies of tomorrow develop.
Drawing on the experience of 30 of the top performers in its
portfolio, 3i has coined the term ''emerging businesses''to describe
those firms which have major growth potential.
Published yesterday, the group's research paper, ''Emerging
Businesses: The Ingredients for Success?'', concludes that these
companies have innovative products or services, principally in new or
rapidly changing markets such as multimedia.
Key pointers to success include an experienced management team which
can tackle the inevitable crises and the signing up of at least one
significant customer prior to launch.
Willie Watt, a director at 3i's Glasgow office, said the current stage
in the Scottish economic cycle suggested the time was right to invest in
young businesses.
He added: ''We need to increase understanding of the factors that make
for business success if we are to invest in those companies and sectors
which are set to grow in stature to make a significant impact on the
future development of the UK economy.''
The Glasgow office of 3i expects to have invested #5m in 10 emerging
Scottish businesses by the end of its current financial year.

GIVEN the day it is, this is probably as good a time as any to bash
out a bit of a sermon on passion, power, and broken promises.
Valentines, no matter how great their cumulative posting, are the very
least of love mail. In the realm of amour it is the slings and arrows of
vendettas which are aimed with most velocity.
''He took my genuine antique antelope luggage,'' cries the latest
Cindy seeking a multi-billion settlement. ''Cool it, baby,'' soothes her
attorney. ''After we've finished with your ex, he won't be able to
afford a paper bag.'' This is tame stuff compared to the fury burning
inside the cast-off heart of a clandestine affair. What is never
conclusively explained, however, is why so many eminent men risk losing
the very power they sought so determinedly, by luring scandal to their
door.
Does egomania persuade the clever Lothario that having achieved much
he can now get away with anything? Or is illicit liaison the last
remaining thrill, the challenge to joust with self-destruction?
Gladstone once declared that of the 11 British Prime Ministers he had
known, seven to his personal knowledge were adulterers. The American
writer Gore Vidal has also observed that the public figure who does not
wish to have affairs seems to him an unnatural master, and he
substantiates his argument by pointing to a former First Lady's groomed
tolerance for her husband's peccadilloes:
''Lyndon was a people lover,'' recalled Ladybird Johnson. ''He was not
going to exempt half the population, which is female, from his love.''
But does such an appetite for passion make for a more profound or
perceptive leader? The Kennedy men excused their womanising as an
example of their understanding of human frailty. Bill Clinton employed a
similar defence during his presidential campaign, and while it swung him
some votes in the election, it is now perceived as one more exampleof
the man's disastrous judgment, because so much else about his White
House tenure is at fault.
Henry Kissinger mused that power is the most potent aphrodisiac. Deep
in their hungry souls few influential figures might disagree, although
not too many would concede the point so brazenly. At the time of his
remark, though, pictures of a napalmed Vietnam were entering the world's
sitting-room. Kissinger was at the height of his shuttle diplomacy and
in bizarre contrast, his stop-overs in Paris had earned him the
reputation of a lady's man. The social life of the preening Right Bank
had obviously offered relief from the flying doctor's war-and-peace
manoeuvres, but maybe Kissinger's definition of power in sexual terms
was also a subconscious explanation of how a dumpy man in a too-tight
suit, with lugubrious features and the most monotonous baritone in
history, could be classed as one of the great seducers of the age.
For those who spin around such figures, the fact of being close to the
momentum of crucial events is an addictive drama in itself. The chosen,
be they paramour or cleaner, may not wish to sway events, or even spill
the beans on what they know. They are simply intoxicated by the chance
to watch the full panoply of power from the wings. But in the case of
secret love what happens when the passion turns rancid?
There is a woman in Paris who makes a tidy living from selling
mutinous tokens to jilted victims out to unnerve their former beaux.
Thirteen unlucky dead roses bedececked in mourning ribbons, a broken
mirror, a box of rotting fish, a jacket and trousers disgustingly
stained . . . these are the black Valentines dispatched by a modern
witch. On behalf of others she sends them anonymously to errant spouses,
serial gropers, finagling lawyers, and those generally obnoxious people
who suddenly decide their partners are dispensable. If love sends us all
slightly potty, here is more dark evidence that rejection renders some
spasmodically insane.
But for women, the wisest reflection on sex, power, and retribution
still belongs to the late Rebecca West whose essay on the trial of
Stephen Ward referred to John Profumo's confusion about the actual dates
of his relationship with a call-girl called Christine Keeler.
''He could not, in March 1963, remember whether an affair he had
enjoyed in 1961 with an exceptionally beautiful girl had lasted one
month or six.''
Such shameful forgetfulness, Dame Rebecca insisted, should be
instilled in the minds of all girls beyond the age of 12, as a vital
lesson in their education.

ADVERTISING giant Saatchi &amp; Saatchi yesterday failed in a High Court
attempt to stop ousted chairman Maurice Saatchi setting up a rival
agency with his brother Charles and three of the group's senior
executives.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi had agreed that there was nothing to stop Maurice
Saatchi going into competition but argued that the three executives
broke their employment contracts by signing an agreement to join his new
firm in the near future and by allowing him to act in their interests in
the meantime.
But Mr Justice Jonathan Parker said the company, in seeking
injunctions against the three, was trying to obtain court orders ''by
the back door'' to prevent Mr Saatchi from going into competition.

PREPARE for a deluge of words about Glasgow. The first 220,000-word
instalment of a three-volume of a history of the city is about to land
with a thump upon the lieges.
''Almost 90% of the material in the book is new information,'' says
Professor Tom Devine of Strathclyde University, co-editor of the History
of Glasgow. And, although the book is primarily aimed at academics and
students, it is not entirely dry and statistical.
He is not wrong. A speed-read at the first 10 centuries of Glasgow
life according to Prof Devine and his team of fellow writers reveals a
number of intriguing scenarios:
* The year is 1674 and the citizens are concerned about the state of
local government. Provost John Bell stands accused of ''pulling people
in off the streets and making them councillors. His corruption became a
byword,'' says Gordon Jackson, a reader in economic history at
Strathclyde and author of this particular section of the book.
* Events in the year 1696 may be familiar to citizens who recall the
edict last year by city boss Pat Lally ordering a clean-up of Glasgow's
streets. Almost 300 years ago, Lally's predecessors felt obliged to
promulgate the Statute of Nastiness to deal with ''the growing
filthiness of the place''.
* We move on to 1721 to find a curfew on places of entertainment.
After an unspecified but obviously unacceptable incident at a social
event at the Glasgow Grammar School, the council orders a ban on
''public balls, shows, comedies, and other plays or diversions.'' Even
worse is the ''shutting of taverns at 10pm'' and, for good measure, the
closure of a brothel or two.
It appeared that the city's captains of commerce and industry are not
leading the lower orders by example: ''In the early 18th century, hard
drinking was the preferred recreation for the younger merchants and
tavern gossip rather than intellectual debate was their favourite
pursuit.''
* We fast-forward to 1819 to find a debate in the letters page of the
Glasgow Herald on the subject of water privatisation. A correspondent
declares that the council ''being the natural guardians of the interests
of the community should be given the power to operate their own water
enterprise in the hope that this would reduce costs to the consumer''.
Much of the above sounds awful familiar but thankfully not the Ladle
Tax. This gave the bailies the right to open any sack of grain brought
into the city and help themselves to a ladleful. The same concept was
then applied to supplies of milk, meat, fish, eggs, and potatoes.
Can you imagine how much damage your average present-day Glasgow
bailie could do with his ladle in Safeway?
Seeing the light
HEARD at an Ayrshire Burns Supper: ''Shoplifting has got so bad in
Saltcoats that up at the chapel they've had to put in a new confessional
for eight items or less.''
Brief encounter
THERE is nothing worse, from the point of view of accused persons and
those who represent them, than an alert sheriff.
Sheriff Ronnie Watson was dealing at Ayr Sheriff Court with a felon
who had been caught stealing handbags from cars in the town. The defence
agent made an impassioned plea for leniency noting that a co-accused had
been dealt with earlier by way of a fine and compensation order.
The hapless brief said that the court records showed his client's
fellow recidivist had lodged the necessary monies with his solicitor and
that his man sought the same opportunity to make amends.
Sheriff Watson pointed out that there was a slight problem with this
line of argument. ''If you read on you will find that the notes he
lodged were forged.'' No such opportunity for the second bagman, he got
six months in the jail.
Gloss finish
IT seems such a shame that the Royal Air Force should lose a leader
who bears the initials RAF. We speak of Sir Sandy Wilson (proper first
names Ronald Andrew Fellowes) who lost his job as air chief marshal
after it was revealed that the redecoration of his RAF tied cottage went
a bit above budget. Yes, we know that #400,000 represents a lot of
anaglypta and emulsion, but bear in mind that among Sir Sandy's
positions is membership of the City of London's Worshipful Company of
Skinners.
Sand boys
THE ways and means of the General and Municipal union continue to
baffle simple souls like the Diary. The GMB is a stickler for
discipline. Shop stewards deviate from the rule book at their peril.
But what is this we hear of a meeting convened technically outwith the
rules last Saturday when 40 or so leading members of the GMB met at
Partick Burgh Halls. Main item on the agenda was to choose who should be
put forward as delegates to the union's annual conference in Brighton in
June.
By one of those coincidences, many of the 43 names which were selected
were those of brothers present at the meeting. This annual assembly,
being on the clandestine side, has no official title. Those in the know
refer to it as a meeting of ''the pail and spade brigade''.
Piece of cheek
A HANDBILL for the play Ubu at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh,
arrives too late for the Diary to give it a plug. But not too late to
notice that it features an all-too-clear colour snap of an actor showing
his bare backside. We see also that the production is sponsored by the
Baring Foundation.
Topping idea
THE Loch Fyne Oyster Bar at Ardkinglas in Argyll has a special St
Valentine's Day offer for lovers. Their oysters, famed for their
aphrodisiacal powers, will be available supercharged with topping
imported from Hong Kong.
The extra ingredient from the orient, where they take turbo-sex
stimulants seriously, is a form of crystallised ginseng. ''Our Hong Kong
agent also suggested a powder made from the sexual organ of the tiger
but it's an endangered species,'' said Andy Lane of the Loch Fyne
company.
''Do the oysters -- at #4.90 for half-a-dozen -- come with a
guarantee?'' we asked. ''If any one of the six oysters doesn't work,
we'll replace it,'' he said.
BLAME Mr David Allison of Kilwinning for the above rude receipt from a
local bookshop. No, blame John Menzies for it was they who choose thus
to abbreviate a perfectly acceptable little tome called Animals of
Farthing Wood.

KINGFISHER astounded the City yesterday when it fired its public image
maker, corporate affairs director Nigel Whittaker accompanied by group
development director Tim Breene.
The departures indicate a further deepening of the crisis within
Kingfisher revealed late last month with chief executive Alan Smith
leaving the company just two years after joining from Marks &amp; Spencer.
As part of a major board shake-up chairman Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy
succeeded him as chief executive and Slough Estates chairman and
Kingfisher deputy chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs took over the chairmanship
until a replacement could be found.
Also leaving is James Kerr-Muir, the finance director who is going in
April, partly because he was supposed to be unable to develop a good
relationship with the City. He finishes at the end of April.
In a brief statement yesterday, the Woolworth, B&amp;Q, Comet and
Superdrug group said that following the completion of a review it is
devolving more responsibility to operating companies and significantly
reducing the size of its corporate headquarters. That means that 40 out
of 100 positions will be redeployed or eliminated.
In both cases, there are no longer appropriate roles for the departing
directors.
Both are on three year rolling contracts but it is unlikely they will
receive the full nominal amounts. Mr Whittaker is one of the two
Kingfisher directors in the #410,00 to #500,000 range in last year's
accounts. The other is Mr James Kerr-Muir.
Mr Whittaker with his share options should be able to look forward to
a compensation package of around #1.25m.
A keen marathon runner in both London and New York, Mr Whittaker
joined the then Woolworth in 1982 when Charterhouse Bank under Victor
Blank paid the US parent #310m for its British subsidiary. He is a
barrister and as the then lawyer for British Sugar came into contact
with Mulcahy who was finance director under the late John Beckett who
led the Woolworth buyout.
Over the years, he has appeared as both the engaging front man for the
company and until recently chairman of the CBI Distributive Trades
Survey Panel as well as being frequently on radio and on panel games.
In contrast, to strangers Mulcahy is apparently withdrawn but amusing
and friendly once the acquaintance has been made. A common perception
was that both men were good friends and worked together closely as a
team.
A spokesman said that the changes began in September when two
directors from the operating companies were appointed to the board. Sir
Geoffrey will now be surrounded by four operating directors.
A leading fund manager who has followed the company for many years was
highly critical last night. He said ''The man who is doing this should
be going. Mulcahy has been asleep.''
He asked ''What has Woolworths got going for it? Comet is finished.
They could float the B&amp;Q D-I-Y side and Superdrug. Mulcahy has a lot to
answer for.''
Broker estimates put the group break-up value at between 550p and 600p
a share -- compared with last night's 426p. However that of the Comet
subsidiary is open to question after its dismal Christmas trading result
with like-for-like sales down 11% although possibly helped in the future
by the current death throes of the Rumberlows competitor where the Thorn
EMI parent has slit its throat.

ON Friday last Tony Blair flew a kite. It was a policy kite, in tune
with Labour's present striptease strategy; a titillating glimpse of what
the Opposition hope to do when they attain power. For a moment it
fluttered. It was a little kite, and he must have been flying it down by
Islington or some other remote part of Britain, because I saw only a
brief note of it in the papers, and it would have plunged like a lead
balloon over some really happy part of socialist Scotland, like
Drumchapel.
Bluntly, it was a tax-break for nannies. Or rather, them that has the
bawbees to employ nannies, or a child-care service that lets mummy go
out to work. For many years, since the time of nice Mr Attlee, no-one
has been able to claim the cost of domestic servants against tax. Now Mr
Blair proposes to change an aspect of this. When the Pink Dawn comes,
and he and his cronies take Whitehall, he hopes rapidly to amend affairs
so that ''powerful women'' -- the very words he used -- will gain
cheaper nannies.
The Tory Party, Blair said, still harbours many with primitive views
on women in the work-place. He hopes to outflank them. And, with cheap
nannies dancing temptingly about the People's Flag, all those powerful
women will abandon the primitive Tories and come running to vote Labour.
Well! Mr Blair is evidently fond of nannies. Not to mention powerful
women. Delicious possibilities open up for the psychologist's thesis.
Perhaps he remains haunted by Mrs Thatcher, who nannied us all for 11
long years. Perhaps, long ago, Mr Blair had a nannie himself. Maybe she
lives yet, an old, retired, but devoted family retainer, clucking away
in some grace-and-favour maisonette and following his career in the
papers.
No doubt he lisped at her knee as a tiny child, saying that when he
grew up he would be a socialist. Perhaps nightly, year upon year, she
put little Blair to bed with a dummy-teat dipped in rosehip syrup. It
would certainly explain why his teeth are welded together when he talks.
Enough of this frivolity. Let us take a cold hard look at this latest
policy initiative from the left.
It has one remarkable feature: the leader of an avowedly socialist
party is offering a tax break. Now there is something to be said for
that. Contrary to Tory propaganda, the tax-burden on the British has
never been higher. Swingeing cuts on income tax -- the fairest, most
efficient way of supporting the public treasury -- have been achieved by
hikes on indirect taxation. These are unjust impositions. They are
regressive: they weigh most heavily on the poor.
An excellent case could be made for cutting the overall tax burden --
by, say, binning the ludicrous Trident -- and raising income tax to
healthier levels while slashing VAT. This would be much fairer. It would
save us all a good deal of money. It would also put a just burden on the
very wealthy.
But this proposal is entirely different. This proposal helps the rich
while the masses pay. It is aimed at successful couples, both in good
careers, who want the children off their hands. Hence they need nannies.
Nannies are expensive. Mr Blair wants to make it cheaper. The money lost
in this tax break would be fleeced from the rest of us.
This is wrong. But enough of fiscal things. Consider this. Mr Blair
evidently thinks working mothers are a Good Thing.
Well, he would, of course; Mrs Blair is a barrister. But Mr Blair is
wrong. There is mounting evidence that the proliferation of working
mothers is a social evil, and any policy promoting it is wicked.
In the first place, it insults the mothers who do not work. There are
plenty of them about. I know wonderful, clever, resourceful, gifted
women who have left the work-place for a few years to raise their
families. I grow tired of hearing such belittled and devalued. I weary
of the insidious propaganda telling them they lead inadequate,
unfulfilling lives. ''Oh, me?'' she says apologetically, ''I'm just a
wife and mother . . .''
But she is raising children. She is daily imprinting and moulding
precious posterity. She makes home a safe base, a refuge, a place of
unfailing stability and love. She surrounds children in psychological
security. For she has that magic link: the umbilical cord. It is not a
parent-child bond. It is a mother-child bond. Children need mother. No
nannie, no daycare centre can take her place.
What are children taught when both parents are out all day working?
They are taught that they are not important. They are accessories,
possessions, achievements. Consumerism is all there is to life; money is
all that matters.
In the second place, Blair's tempting kite upholds a myth that is
destroying women's lives. It insists that she can -- should --
simultaneously raise children and pursue a full ambitious career.
Few women -- few men -- are capable of this. To work full-time, and
enjoy your children, and tend to the house and garden, and lead an
active social life, and pursue private fulfilling interests? It is a
one-way ticket to the funny farm. Few who try do well in any of these
fields -- far less all of them -- and many women find themselves in a
desperate existence of exhaustion and worry.
In the third place -- and we have been down this road before -- there
is an undeniable link between the increase of women in the work-place
and the rise in male unemployment. Now a gifted, unemployed single woman
is as much a human tragedy as a gifted, unemployed single man. But it is
palpably unfair that thousands of British homes should enjoy two incomes
when thousands of others enjoy no income at all.
In the fourth place, there is the hurt to children themselves.
''Quality time'' is a pernicious American myth. One concentrated hour of
parental attention is no substitute for simply spending the day in the
company of your mother. Children without that are loveless children.
Loveless children are tempted to futile, silly, or dangerous things.
Sometimes, as wee James Bulger found out, they do evil things.
The traditional household can have its faults. Too many wives lack
full support from their husbands. Men should do a fair share of the
housework; fathers should spend more time with their weans. But the
traditional model works. It is the bedrock of the family unit, the
principal antidote to crime, the factory of civic virtue, the
cornerstone of community.
There are excellent ideas Mr Blair could pursue. There are tax breaks
that could support single-income families. Housewives could be given an
allowance. (It would be far cheaper than that other ludicrous panacea,
universal nursery education.) But this proposal is bad.
Where is the radicalism in subsidising nannies? Where is the justice
in expecting society to do so? And, most of all, is there any price too
high for Mr Blair to pay in his quest for Tory votes?

Major engineering and chemical companies with long established
histories have rationalised and cut their workforces.
Yesterday, against that pessimistic background, the possible engineers
of the future -- around 250 pupils from schools in Strathclyde Region --
gathered enthusiastically to embrace the buoyant messages delivered by
Terry Hanley, Concept Planning Manager at the Rover Group.
They had come together at the University of Paisley, the only venue in
Scotland planned for the innovative lecture called: Man, Machine and the
Market.
It was based on the prestigious Christmas lecture of the Institution
of Electrical Engineers in London two months ago.
Hanley and the Rover Group are no strangers to the university, having
been involved over the past few years in contributing to World Quality
Day events organised by Professor Will McEwan and the Quality Centre at
the University, as well as giving lectures.
Professor McEwan explained the origin of this special relationship:
''We were involved in developing the welding technology and
manufacturing process technology for Rover's Range Rover vehicle in the
early 1980s.
''Since then, several of the Group's senior personnel have visited
Paisley to lecture to our post-graduate students.''
Yesterday's Rover Lecture focused on the man/machine/market
interfaces, looking at product demand and customer choice and examining
the relationship between consumers and the market with particular regard
to the motor industry.
That relationship is inherent in Rover Group's mission to provide
extraordinary customer satisfaction throughout the entire life of the
product it supplies.
From that premise, the Lecture took the audience through the life
cycle of the product, from its earliest days as a ''bright idea''
through the styling, the models and the prototypes, to the vehicle in
service.
Throughout that evolutionary journey, the importance of the customer,
or market, is paramount, influencing every phase and step of the
developments and manifested in market research, clinics, and general
customer response to existing and previous models.
Throughout all of the processes involved in the manufacture of the
vehicle, there is this constant man/machine interface, whether it is the
stylists and their computers, the engineers and their test equipment,
the operators and their robots, or the suppliers and their transport.
Monitoring customer satisfaction continues beyond the manufacturing
stages of the product, and a further vital interface takes place with
the customer and the dealer.
To illustrate this, Hanley focused on two award-winning computer
systems which the Group has introduced: Discus and Textbook.
Discus is a computer system designed to allow customers to choose any
product and its features from a current list, view it in any colour,
access details about the feature and vehicle prices and the likely
trade-in value of the customer's exist ing vehicle.
Equally valuable is Textbook', a touch screen, interactive computer
system tailored to the needs of workshop personnel to facilitate fault
finding and diagnosis on vehicles in service.
The two initiatives were introduced to the audience, who were then
invited to participate in various demonstrations.
The overall message highlighting the importance of man's positive
relationships with new technological advances in every aspect of life
was not lost on the members of the audience, most of whom have been at
home with computers since the earliest years of their lives.
Said Professor McEwan, director of Paisley's Quality Centre: ''We are
confident the Rover lecture will have created an interest in engineering
among the school pupils who attended, and may have encouraged some of
them to consider a career in the design and manufacturing industry.''
The fact that Hanley chose to speak to school pupils came as no
surprise, since the Rover Group is committed to the industrial/education
interface, manifested through its Education Partnership Programme.
According to Hanley, education and business are mutually dependent,
neither being able to fulfil its essential role in society without the
other.
He said: ''Education partnership is a mainstream business necessity,
driven by enlightened self-interest.
''It is also a vital means by which those of us in industry and
commerce can communicate our vision, our values, and our priorities to
the next generation.
''If Britain is to compete effectively in world markets, we need a
flexible, adaptable self-motivated workforce with a positive attitude
towards lifelong learning and the continuing development of skills at
work.
''A stimulating work-related curriculum for all pupils will help
encourage and develop such positive attitudes.''

Dresden, Monday
ROYALTY, political leaders, and Allied military chiefs paid homage in
Dresden to the thousands who perished at the hands of RAF and American
bombers 50 years ago tonight.
Gathered together in a marked spirit of reconciliation, no-one
attempted to apportion blame or guilt.
However the Bishop of Coventry, the Rt Rev Simon Barrington-Ward, told
the people of Dresden that the horrific Allied raid was morally wrong.
''Hitler's war had unleashed a whirlwind into which we were swept,''
he said. ''The dynamic of war swept away our inhibitions.
''When the British and American air forces destroyed Dresden we had
suppressed our moral principles.''
German President Roman Herzog refused to further some claims that the
raids, which killed up to 35,000 people and decimated the city's
renowned baroque and Renaissance buildings, were a war crime.
''There is no doubt that it was inhuman but it makes no sense to
discuss whether it was legally right,'' he said. ''What good do such
discussions bring 50 years later?''
The day began at the memorial to the dead in a peaceful pine forest
high above the city, where dignitaries laid wreaths of commemoration.
The Duke of Kent, representing the Queen and leading the British
delegation, stood smartly to attention in front of the memorial. His
wreath bore the simple words: ''In Memoriam: February 13, 1945.''
Dignitaries then stood to one side as hundreds of local people placed
single flowers and small wreaths as tributes to relatives and friends,
who were incinerated, suffocated, and buried alive in what Germans call
the ''night of the devil's tinderbox''.
Fifty years ago, at 9.45pm tonight, the air raid sirens first sounded
across the rooftops of Dresden to warn the inhabitants of the impending
disaster.
An armada of RAF bombers carried out the first massive raid, dropping
1476 tons of high explosive and 1182 tons of incendiary bombs that
caused the destructive firestorm and ripped the city apart.
However there was also recognition today that Dresden could not be
seen in isolation from the countless other horrors and atrocities of the
Second World War.
Germany's military chief, General Klaus Naumann, sidestepped the
question about whether Germany now expected an official apology from
Britain for the raid.
''The fact His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent is here to honour the
dead is a clear indication that we are looking to the future and
reconciliation is the catchword,'' he said.
He stressed: ''You cannot talk about Dresden without talking about the
city of Coventry.''
The Lord Mayor of Coventry, Nick Nolan, who laid a wreath with
representatives of other cities twinned with Dresden, spoke of shared
grief.
''I am not apportioning blame or guilt. We were all guilty at the time
and perhaps we will not be again in the future. What we have to do is
get rid of tragedy, suffering, and war.
''In a marvellous and almost miraculous way, the fires that burned so
fiercely in Coventry and in Dresden have ignited a flame of hope in
cities and among people all over the world.''
The central commemoration ceremony in the city's concert hall was
marred by a vociferous demonstration of left-wing activists opposed to
German reunification.
They were swiftly bundled out by security guards to loud applause.

<HEADLINE>Retail sales are flat in January, says CBI</HEADLINE>

JANUARY was a disappointing month for High Street spending, according
to the Confederation of British Industry's latest Distributive Trades
Survey. Retail sales were flat in the month, below retailers
expectations, and little changed from an admittedly fairly buoyant
January of last year after a surprise fall in December, 1993. It follows
a pick up in volumes in the year to December 1994.
The official retail sales figures are out tomorrow but the CBI survey
has not always proved a reliable guide to these. James Capel has
forecast an increase of 0.3% for the month to take the year-on-year rate
down from 3.8% to 2.7%.
The CBI said the the volume of retail sales is expected to grow
moderately in the year to February. But expectations were not realised
in the year to January and have not been fully met in eight out of the
last 12 months.
The largest increases in volumes were reported by confectionery,
tobacco and newspaper shops followed by grocers. These sectors also saw
substantial sales growth in the year to December. Marked reductions in
trading were reported by specialist food retailers, such as butchers,
bakers and greengrocers, and chemists, as well as hardware, china and
DIY stores.
Sales were regarded as below average for the time of year having been
regarded as average in December. Only confectionery, tobacco and
newspaper retailers reported sales to be significantly above average,
while chemists regarded sales the most below average.
However, while High Street trading last month was weaker than
expected, the underlying three-month trend continues to indicate
moderate annual volume growth.
Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's Distributive Trades Survey
Panel, said: ''Retail sales growth has once again proved to be weaker
than retailers anticipated. The survey suggests that, on an underlying
basis, High Street trade is still growing only modestly.''
Orders placed with suppliers are expected to remain flat having fallen
in January. This reflects the fact that stock levels are expected to
remain more tha adequate in relation to projected demand.
Motor traders reported that sales fell slightly in the year to January
-- roughly as expected -- and sales for the time of year remain below
average. Orders placed with suppliers also fell, indicating that stocks
remained more than adequate in relation to expected demand. Sales are
forecast to grow slightly in the year to February but to remain below
average for the time of year.

BY the end of the decade, an estimated one in six of all office-based
employees are expected to be working from home for at least part of the
week.
Now insurers are coming up with policies tailored to the special needs
of the home-based worker.
Current basic home contents insurance cover is inadequate, whether for
an employee spending the odd day at home working on a portable computer,
or a self-employed person running a business from the spare bedroom with
computer, fax machine, mobile telephone and all the other technical
gadgetry needed to sell one's services these days.
Indeed, most home contents policies specifically exclude any property
used for business purposes in the home.
While cover may be provided by an employer for equipment such as a
laptop computer used by an employee at a client's office or at his home
or in a hotel room, those who spend most of their time working from home
need special cover.
Until now, that has meant taking out a business policy for the
equipment as well as a separate Public Liability policy.
Commercial Union, for example, offers a policy for small computer
installations in offices, covering the equipment up to the value of
#50,000 as well as #10,000 costs of re-instating data following a
hardware loss.
But the premium costs #350 to cover a less sophisticated home set-up
valued at up to #12,500 and an additional #150 is needed for Public
Liability cover, bringing a total bill of #500 a year for a modest SoHo
(Small Office Home Office) set-up.
Aware of the growing trend towards professionals working from home --
more commonly known as teleworking -- the same company is underwriting a
policy offered by specialist brokers Tolson Messenger which addresses
these problems and provides cover at a fraction of the price.
It was established two years ago when the company identified a gap in
the market between those who found standard office policies not relevant
to their needs and those who sailed on regardless, under the
misapprehension that their home contents policy covered them.
Several other companies have jumped on the same bandwagon in recent
months.
Tolson Messenger's Home-Office policy covers all office equipment in
the home such as computers, fax machines, and mobile phones on an
all-risks basis.
It also covers certain equipment such as portable computers and mobile
phones which are frequently used away from base.
The cover includes public liability indemnity up to #1m and up to
#7500 towards the increased cost of running a business following an
interruption such as a fire, as well as a free legal helpline.
Personal accident, commercial legal expenses, product liability, and
goods in transit can all be added to the policy.
Under this policy, broadly similar to CU's Small Computer Policy
mentioned earlier, the cost of covering the #12,500 home-office set-up
drops to #195 and gives the policy holder greater cover for less than
40% of the cost.

MID Wynd International Investment Trust suffered a slight setback in
the six months to December, after a sparkling performance in its
previous financial year.
Hit hard by the underperformance of smaller companies, particularly in
the UK and continental Europe, net asset value fell 3.3% to 396.9p.
During the period, the benchmark FT World index dropped only 1.3%.
The below-par performance of the Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford trust
contrasted sharply with a 13.3% rise in its NAV in the year to end-June.
Mid Wynd, a #20m capital and income growth trust which focuses on
smaller companies, raised its interim dividend by 4.0% to 2.6p and
forecast a similar increase in the final payout.
Interim earnings per share went up 34% to 4.05p but the increase in
dividend was restricted so the payout would not have to go down when
relatively large cash and bond holdings are converted back into
equities.
Mid Wynd is particularly bearish on Wall Street, with its 12.7% stake
in US equities extraordinarily low for a trust of its type.
At December 31, it had 26.5% of funds in UK equities, with 21.7% in
continental Europe, 16.7% in Pacific stock markets, 6.3% in Latin
America and 4.1% in Japanese shares. It had 4.5% in cash and 7.5% in
foreign bonds.
Although it increased its Latin American holdings by 75% during the
six months, Mid Wynd escaped the worst of the financial crisis there.
Telmex, the Mexican telecommunications stock, was the only major
casualty, with a 27.5% decline in sterling terms.

SOME conversion of equities into cash during the six months to
end-January reflects the cautious outlook of Dundee-based Second
Alliance Trust.
The #322m investment trust, which aims for capital and income growth,
raised its interim dividend by 7.7% to 14p and forecast a final dividend
above last year's 29p.
Net asset value fell 4.0% to #16.71 during the six months. UK
investments, which account for 52% of the fund, performed slightly
better than the FTSE All-Share index, which fell 4.2%.
Growth in dividends continued to be strong, with net revenue up from
just over #4m in the first six months of the trust's previous financial
year to nearly #4.5m. Interim earnings per share increased 10% to 23.1p.
Second Alliance's Far Eastern holdings, with a 9% presence, lost about
14% of their value, a performance which joint managing director Lyndon
Bolton described as ''pretty well level pegging'' with the relevant
indices.
Although the US Standard &amp; Poor's index rose slightly during the
period, dollar considerations almost cancelled out its sterling
equivalent gains. Marginal losses for the trust's US investments, which
at #76.2m accounted for almost one-quarter of funds on January 31, were
therefore broadly in line with Wall Street.
Second Alliance has 9% of its money invested in continental Europe.
Overall, sales of #16.4m during the six months outweighed purchases of
#11.1m, taking net liquid assets to #20m, or 6%, from #14m.
Mr Bolton said: ''We have got a bit more cash. That really reflects
our rather cautious stance at the moment.''
Describing the economic situation as finely balanced, he added: ''The
hope must be that the interest rate increases that we have seen, and the
ones that may lie ahead, succeed in capping the lid on inflation,
without pushing economies into a recession.''
However, the trust believes that the boom-bust scenario witnessed in
the late-1980s and early-1990s may be a thing of the past and it would
not be greatly worried by a ''normal'' downturn.
The fall in the markets in which Second Alliance is involved was not
as severe as during the six months to end-July, when its net asset value
plunged 8%.
Second Alliance believes stock market valuations now more
realistically reflect the outlook but remain demanding, with consumer
confidence still lacking and the prospect of a slowdown in corporate
earnings' growth.
Mr Bolton felt the increase in interim dividend was ''quite
encouraging'' and added: ''We wouldn't have increased the interim by
this amount if we hadn't been fairly confident about managing some
increase in the final dividend.''

Grozny, Monday
RUSSIAN and Chechen commanders agreed a ceasefire today for heavy
weapons, amid signs that President Boris Yeltsin was trying to distance
himself from the unpopular military operation in Chechnya.
The Defence Ministry in Moscow said follow-up talks later this week
would seek to broaden the truce in the Kremlin's assault on the region's
breakaway rebels.
Yeltsin, embroiled in controversy at home and abroad, planned a tough
look at the military campaign in a speech to Parliament this week,
Interfax reported.
A military spokesman said the ceasefire agreement was reached in the
Ingushi settlement of Sleptsovsk, on the border with Chechnya, after
talks between the Russian commander, Colonel-General Anatoly Kulikov,
and head of rebel forces Aslan Maskhadov.
However a senior officer said the Russian army planned to stay on in
Chechnya until its troops had crushed separatists in the towns of
Gudermes, Shali, and Argun.
He said plans to storm the cities had been already drawn up. If
independence fighters refused to leave their strongholds, he said,
''powerful air strikes'' would be launched.
It was not immediately clear what weapons would be affected by the
ceasefire. The Russian army has bombed Chechen positions from the air
and used a variety of other heavy weapons, including tanks and
artillery.
Tass, reporting from Nazran, said Kulikov had ordered Russian forces
immediately after the talks to stop using heavy weapons. However as an
Interior Ministry official it was not clear if Kulikov had authority to
issue direct orders to the Russian army.
Maskhadov told Tass he had been authorised by separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev to lead negotiations ''exclusively on military
issues''.
Moscow has repeatedly ruled out talks with Dudayev, but has said it
was ready to talk with field commanders.
It took two months for Moscow to quell Chechnya's three-year
independence bid and seize the regional capital, Grozny.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people have been killed and Russian
forces still face Chechen resistance elsewhere in the rebel region.
The peace move came as Yeltsin appeared set to distance himself from
the unpopular campaign.
A Yeltsin source said the president would make ''a critical analysis
of the military approach to the resolution of the Chechen problem'' in
his annual address to both houses of Parliament on Thursday.
This could spell trouble for Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, who bears
much of the responsibility for the military incursion in the small north
Caucasus region.--Reuter.

Miami, Monday
FLORIDA police have today defended the shooting dead of a young
British man, claiming that he lunged at officers with a machete.
Darren Brown, 21, of Kirklington Road, Southwell, Nottinghamshire, was
shot dead on Friday in the Coconut Grove area of Miami, it emerged
today.
Police spokesman Angelo Bitsis said that the incident started on
Friday morning when Mr Brown brandished the machete at officers, shouted
obscenities, and walked toward them.
When they drew their weapons and backed up, Mr Brown began threatening
passing motorists near the main intersection in the entertainment and
shopping district, and several drivers abandoned their cars.
Mr Brown then lunged at one officer and two others opened fire. Mr
Brown was hit three times and died at the scene.
Raymond Lang of Miami police said: ''We had to defend ourselves.
''This person was only two or three feet away from the officers and he
was waving a machete. Their lives were threatened. There was little they
could do.
''They continued to back off until they couldn't back off any longer .
. . but when you are waving a deadly weapon at police officers and
citizens, you run the risk of incurring injury to yourself as well.''
Another police spokesman said that Mr Brown had entered the US in
January last year on a 90-day tourist visa, and would have been
considered to have been in the country illegally.
Mr Brown went to Florida with three friends, including 22-year-old
Andy Scothern, who said today: ''It just seems insane he has been
killed.
''He has never been violent, and I can't believe what they are saying.
It's totally out of character.''
Mr Brown's family, who were too upset by their son's death to comment,
were today making arrangements to fly his body home.
A friend said that the family had received a call from an American
lawyer advising them that they may have grounds for legal action against
the Miami police.

IN ADDITION to loans, hard-pressed students are being driven to run up
overdrafts and other debts.
Student loans are a major commitment, but they are a long term form of
debt, being repaid only when students secure salaries of more than 80%
of the national average. But other debts present an immediate concern.
Rent arrears, fuel bills, and overdrafts can all be problems in the
short term. A survey at Edinburgh University showed 47% of students
having outstanding debts at the end of last session.
One student commented: ''I have to work during term to stop myself
getting into a lot of debt. I feel I can't concentrate on my studies
because of this.''
With a maximum grant and loan of #3125 -- which not all students get
-- it is hard to avoid debt. A shortfall of #1000 is estimated by some.
So the need to get a summer job is clear.
But jobs are not easy to find and are often poorly paid. Summer can
prove a time of hardship for some students.
Without supplementing their income students have #60 a week all year
round. Deducting #38 -- the average student rent in Scotland -- leaves
only #22 to buy books, clothing, study materials and food, and pay
bills.
This leads to National Union of Students claims that students are
worse off than people on income support. Yet, along with 16 and
17-year-olds, students are excluded from the benefits safety net.
In addition, students are often unaware of where to turn for help.
They need to be aware of advice services provided by consumer and
trading standards departments, universities, student unions, and
citizens advice bureaus.
Advice sought early can help to avoid later problems. General debt
advice is based on commonsense:
* DON'T borrow more than you can afford.
* TRY to budget and to make priorities about debts.
* READ the small print on credit agreements.
* BORROW only from recognised, legal lenders.
* IF you are unsure, go to someone for advice.
Ian Barr, a final year student at Strathclyde University, said:
''Student debt won't go away. But advice might make it easier to
handle.''

Johannesburg, Monday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela's estranged wife Winnie today defended her
criticism of South Africa's post-apartheid government, though she said
she never intended to insult him or to embarrass his administration.
In a carefully-worded letter to the president, Mrs Mandela said
remarks in which she accused the government of paying more attention to
appeasing minority whites than aiding blacks were intended to highlight
the grievances of most South Africans.
President Mandela, who today urged international investors to develop
a Marshall Plan-style programme to help rebuild post-apartheid South
Africa, was stung by his wife's comments. She often provokes controversy
and outrage but still has a huge following, particularly among poor
blacks.
''I was merely trying to assure the masses that the government and the
ANC are aware of and concerned about the flaws that the government must
still deal with,'' she wrote.
''The impression of the people is that we neither care nor know about
these things. I was trying to correct that perception. If in so doing I
created a different impression, that was not my intention.''
Senior African National Congress (ANC) officials said earlier they
expected Mrs Mandela to retract her remarks, but the letter stopped
short of this.
Local media reported that Mrs Mandela had been told to apologise or
resign as Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture, but ANC officials played
down the row.
''I don't think there is a serious problem. All she needs to do is
explain her unwise remarks,'' said one.
In a separate row between Mrs Mandela and members of the ANC Women's
League, which she heads, one of her critics claimed she had failed to
pass on a #93,00 donation from Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
when she attended President Mandela's inauguation last year.
Mrs Mandela's spokesman said the money was earmarked for projects in
poor black communities, and was never intended for the League.

FRANCE vowed a fight to the finish today for tougher limits on the
number of Hollywood films shown on European television, warning that the
EU's film industry would otherwise go to the wall.
However Paris found many countries indifferent and Britain outrightly
hostile when it canvassed European Union (EU) states on a perceived
threat of domination by Hollywood television.
France aimed to rally culture ministers behind its view that the bloc
must protect Western Europe's cultural heritage from drowning in a flood
of US movie exports.
At a two-day ministerial meeting in the capital of the French wine
trade, Culture Minister Jacques Toubon said Europe must fight to prevent
European TV screens from being filled almost exclusively with American
products.
''I'm very optimistic if Europe will be able to follow France in its
search for a European identity, but I'm very pessimistic if Europe will
decide to surrender,'' he told reporters.
At stake is a change in European legislation.
A 1989 directive, Television without frontiers, states that member
countries have to broadcast European television programmes at least half
of the time when practicable.
France wants to make this quota obligatory and Toubon vowed he would
fight to the end to get his way.
Arguing that France was not isolated and could win waverers round, he
compared Hollywood domination to US domination of the aeronautical
industry.
''If we want Europe to exist, we have to build a stopping off point
for imports,'' he said.
The EU's culture commissioner, Marcelino Oreja, will outline a series
of options to ministers tomorrow on how to approach the issue.
Spain and Italy are in his camp and Belgium has already used the local
content argument to keep the TNT cartoon channel, a venture of American
CNN's Ted Turner, out of the country.
Britain, however, wants to scrap quotas altogether.
Writing in today's Financial Times, National Heritage Minister Stephen
Dorrell said: ''I believe that the quotas create an irreconcilable
contradiction at the heart of the directive. The best course would be to
eliminate them or phase them out.''
Germany is sitting on the fence. It awaits a ruling next month by the
Karlsruhe High Court on whether the federal government or Germany's
federated regions have authority in the matter.
''We want to be good Europeans,'' said a German diplomat. Asked
whether Germany would favour the British or French stance, he added:
''They are both worth discussing.''
The Dutch want to keep the status quo of flexible quotas and noted
that all main Europan countries adhere to the rules at the moment.
The debate will take off in earnest tomorrow when Budget and
Communications Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, widely tipped as France's next
Prime Minister, wil join the group.
Today, the ministers agreed to ask the European Commission to develop
a policy framework for the emerging multi-media industry.
''Otherwise the information superhighways of the pending Information
Society will be crowded by US and Japanese products alone,'' a French
diplomat said.
The ministers agreed to increase the Kaleidoscope and Ariane progammes
for the arts and literature.
Ireland's Michel Higgins, supported by Portugal, proposed that the Net
Book Arrangement should be enforced Europe-wide.
This rule, which exists already in many countries, says that a book
should have the same price in a big department store as in a small book
shop. In Britain, Dillons bookstores are fighting this rule.--Reuter.

THE rising tide of debt is engulfing students at Scottish
universities. Without a solution it will have grave repercussions on the
future pattern of higher education.
In particular there is a danger that opportunities in education will
be denied to those without access to the necessary financial resources.
This is contrary to the government's professed desire to open up
education to all.
It is implementing plans to shift the burden of student living costs
during term time from maintenance grant to index-linked personal loan.
But this ignores the adverse effects a life in debt can have on
students.
Ian Barr, 25, a final year economics student at Strathclyde
University, told me: ''By the time I graduate I'll owe more than #5000
in student loans and my overdraft. And I've been lucky. I've had a job
every summer and been able to pay off some of my debts.
''I wouldn't worry so much if I was sure I would get a job when I
finish, but I have friends who graduated last year and can find work
only in supermarkets and shops.''
Ian went on to suggest that worrying about debt distracted him from
his studies and caused him to think seriously about dropping out. An
Edinburgh University survey suggests this is a serious consideration
among one in seven students.
One Edinburgh student who expressed her gratitude to her understanding
parents talked of taking a year out in the middle of her degree to try
to pay off outstanding debts.
''I owed #500 to the bank and another #300 to the credit card company.
That's as well as student loans and family loans. I couldn't let that
get any higher. I had to work.''
''Now it's hard to get back to studying. I couldn't save anything and
I'll still finish my degree in debt.''
Mature students and postgraduates are worse off. Mature students often
have family and mortgage responsibilities as well as other debts.
They have less recourse to family for borrowing and meeting the
demands of higher overheads. However, they will soon not qualify to
receive a larger loan or grant than other students.
Post-graduates are forced to accept debt. Excluded from the student
loans system, facing expensive fees as well as living costs, bank loans
are often the only option.
A student myself, I was unable to get a job on graduation and to
finance further studies have had to borrow. A friend in Stirling said to
me recently: ''I've been living in debt so long now I just try to forget
about it. It just depresses me.''
She had finished her first degree with maximum student loans and a
hefty overdraft. Unable to get a graduate job, she worked as a waitress
before deciding to return to university.
''My pay didn't eat into my debt at all. And I had no prospects, so I
had to find something else. Now I have a career development loan as well
as all the rest. Hopefully I'll now get a job,'' she said.
The shortsightedness of making students run up debt is an outrage as
well as a tragedy. Many who might have considered further studies simply
cannot afford to take up the opportunity.
Gambling on getting a good job is too much for many. Instead, they
take jobs which do not fulfil their potential.
Said Alaina MacDonald, 21, a final year politics student at Glasgow
University: ''I wouldn't like to take on more debt. Borrowing again
would put me off my work and put me under too much pressure. I just
couldn't do it.''
Postgraduate students denied student loans must rely on commercial
career development loans from banks. Debt after a one year course can be
as high as #6000.
The Government funds only a very limited number of post-graduate
places. For the most, students have to borrow not only to meet their
living costs, but also to pay for their fees. And the one-year MSc in
public relations at Stirling University has fees of #2850.
If debt is to be a feature of the Government's higher education
policies it is essential that students be given better information on
the consequences of borrowing. At the moment it seems happy just to
expect students to borrow blindly and gamble on future job markets.
Given that student loans are not extended to postgraduates, and are
not adequate to live on anyway, some support in the credit minefield
might be wise.
Either the Government or the universities should provide estimates of
how much graduates with student loans will owe. Currently the Scottish
Office refuses requests to do this.
It seems highly questionable for a government that prides itself on
financial prudence to behave this way. Students cannot take
responsibility for financing their own studies when they are not
sufficiently informed about the decisions they must make.
Debt and money advice is essential if students are to avoid financial
problems. It would also seem to make sense, if the Tories' higher
education policies are to work.
Otherwise no amount of rhetoric will avoid the fact that only some
people will be able to afford university education, despite the
government's often-repeated claims of widening access.
* Alistair Smith, a politics graduate of Strathclyde University,
recently completed a one-month placement working on a student debt
campaign on behalf of Strathclyde region's consumer and trading
standards department. It was part of the MSc course in public relations
he is currently taking at Stirling University.

Jackie Stewart became the finest racing driver in the world, but just
a few short years before had been branded a stupid no-hoper. Now he is
dedicated to helping those youngsters who suffer from the same handicap
he did -- dyslexia, still too often unrecognised. He tells Gavin Bell of
the day his life was transformed.
JACKIE Stewart has total recall of the fearsome Nurburgring circuit in
Germany, the most difficult race track in the world. It is more than 20
years since he hurtled around it in pursuit of a hat-trick of world
championships, but he can still give every braking distance and every
gear shift for each of the 187 corners on the 14.7-mile course.
He cannot, however, recite the alphabet. Nor can he remember the words
of the Lord's Prayer. He cannot even memorise the four lines of the
Selkirk Grace. Addressing a black-tie dinner at Gleneagles Hotel at the
weekend, he read Burns's weel-kent verse and he got it wrong. But nobody
laughed or sniggered, because most of his audience knew why. They knew
that Stewart is a victim of dyslexia, a learning disability affecting
the capacity of otherwise bright people to master reading and writing
and to absorb some forms of information.
Those members of his audience who were not aware of his handicap were
soon enlightened by an after-dinner speech which moved several women to
tears: ''I left school at 15 years of age as a complete disaster. I had
something called dyslexia. I did not know about it, my teachers did not
know about it, my peers did not know about it, and it was little known
about by the educational authorities; and I have to tell you that my
school years were the most fearful of my life.
''I look back with pain and suffering at the memories of the abuse
that one gets when one cannot read and one cannot write in the simplest
terms. To this day I still cannot read properly. I have no speech
tonight. I have headings, because it would be a waste of my time to try
and read a speech. If you paid me $10m now I could not recite the
alphabet. I have never known it, and I cannot for the life of me today
even learn it.
''I can't even sing my own national anthem. I have stood beside Her
Majesty when it was being played and I couldn't sing it, because I
didn't know the words.''
At school in Dumbarton he was branded ''a real dud -- stupid, dumb and
thick''. And he recalled the frustration: ''When you are a young person
and you are put in that position, you suffer. It's like banging your
head against a brick wall.''
As president of the Scottish Dyslexia Trust, Stewart is resolved to
spare new generations of Scottish children the pain and humiliation
suffered by himself and both of his sons, who apparently inherited the
handicap from him. The gala ball at Gleneagles had been to celebrate the
10th anniversary of Stewart's shooting school at the hotel; but his real
target was to raise funds to place a teacher qualified to help dyslexics
in every school in Scotland. And when the weekend was over, he was
#10,000 closer to the mark.
Relaxing later in his suite with his younger son Mark, he recalled his
struggle to escape the stigma of his ''stupidity''. After leaving school
at the earliest possible opportunity at age 15, he began working in his
father's garage near Dumbarton. At first the tasks were menial, but he
took pride in making the forecourt immaculate, and for the first time in
his life he received praise. When he was promoted to the lubrication
bay, he transformed it into ''the best lube bay in the county, and
possibly in Scotland'', and the customers were impressed.
Jackie Stewart was a boy who did things well. You could rely on Jackie
Stewart to give your car a service second to none. The effect was
immediate: ''You can't imagine how important that was to me. I was
needing praise so badly.''
Within a few years, the ''backward'' child was the fastest and finest
racing driver in the world, winning 27 Grand Prix races and three world
championships; but it was not until he was 42 that he discovered why he
could barely remember the names of the mechanics on whom his life
depended.
The key was his son Mark. After only a few months at boarding school
in Switzerland, it became apparent Mark was unable to keep up with the
rest of his class. The headmaster suggested consulting an expert in
dyslexia in London, who examined the boy and duly diagnosed his
disability.
''I still had no idea what it was,'' Jackie recalls. ''I told the
professor no, he must be wrong, Mark was no different from what I was,
and he'd come out of it as I did. Then the professor tested me, and
guess what? The truth came out, and it was wonderful finally to have an
explanation for all the misery and confusion I had endured over the
years. It was like somebody had saved me from drowning.''
Mark concurs: ''It was a huge relief to me. School had been a
nightmare. Even the teachers laughed at me, I remember that
specifically, and I could do nothing about it. Now here was this guy
explaining it all to us in a laid-back way, and saying we were in good
company.'' They were indeed. Disparate figures such as Churchill and
John Wayne were dyslexic, as are Michael Heseltine, Susan Hampshire, and
King Olav of Norway.
Mark was fortunate in having a father who understood his problems and
had the financial resources to alleviate them. After graduating from an
American school dedicated to children with learning disabilities, he
tackled his handicap head-on by training as an actor with the Perth
Repertory Theatre.
Hours after other members of the company had gone off to the pub, Mark
was still at home struggling to learn his lines; but what he calls the
''have-to factor'' brought success -- in one year alone he gave 300
performances. He has since switched to television as a producer and
cameraman, with his own independent company which recently filmed a
documentary on his father for the Sky network. His elder brother Paul
has soared above his handicap by creating a highly respected motor
racing company based in Milton Keynes, which competes in three formulas.
Stewart is proud of his sons, and it shows. But he is concerned about
the fate of thousands of children who will never have their
opportunities of escaping the mental cage of their disability. It is
estimated that 4% of children suffer from dyslexia, which means possibly
one in every classroom in Scotland, yet virtually no provision is made
for them in regular schools.
''For every one who is properly diagnosed and helped, how many are
left cowering in corners?'' Stewart says. ''How many try to live in a
rainbow of alcohol, or ride a magic carpet of drugs, and end up in a
life of crime because society isn't giving them a hand?
''Our aim is to put somebody to help them in every school in Scotland,
no matter how small. If we can do that, we will give young people the
possibility to reach their true potential, and there is nothing worse in
the world than robbing someone of their potential. There are stars out
there, there is brilliance out there, being suffocated by ignorance and
lack of resources.''
To illustrate the point, he mentions the name of a distinguished
figure who suffered from dyslexia and did relatively well in his
profession. The name is Einstein.

A WOMAN alleged yesterday that her mother suffered an ''appalling lack
of care'' before she died in a Glasgow hospital.
Miss Jean Porter, 56, listed her grievances at a fatal accident
inquiry into her mother's death.
She complained that her mother:
* Was left lying on a trolley for four hours on arriving at the
accident and emergency unit because it was a holiday weekend.
* Was not given the correct liquid drip or a blood transfusion.
Miss Porter said she believed her mother should have been operated on
sooner because her arm was swollen and ''ready to burst'', and claimed
that a drip ran dry five times.
She also alleged that nurses ignored her own concerns about her
mother's treatment.
Miss Porter said: ''I was appalled by her lack of care and I later
asked the fiscal for an inquiry into her death.''
The inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court heard how sprightly Mrs May
Porter, 88, bled to death in the city's Gartnavel General Hospital in
October l993.
She died three days after undergoing an operation for a blockage to
her small bowel and 11 days after being taken into hospital.
Pathologist Marie Cassidy, 39, told the hearing that a surgeon's
stitches surrounding a mass of small blood-vessels burst after the
operation.
Dr Cassidy said Miss Porter's mother, of Hermitage Avenue,
Knightswood, Glasgow, bled slowly to death and that it was
''unfortunate'' that the bleeding had not been discovered.
Miss Porter said that after her mother was transferred to Gartnavel,
she found her ''lying distraught across her bed''. She said: ''My mother
was an active, alert, and strong woman. I was finally asked to agree
that her life-support machine be switched off.''
The hearing before, Sheriff James Jardine, continues.

A DETECTIVE told the Bonnyrigg murder trial that he thought two shots
fired at him from a getaway car as he grappled with an armed man were
blanks.
Seconds later, however, 63-year-old retired mining engineer Mr David
Dunn lay dying from a chest wound after two more shots rang out from the
car.
Detective Constable John Duffy, 42, of Lothian and Borders Police,
told the High Court in Edinburgh that the shots from the car were fired
by a man resembling one accused, Mr Robert Smith.
He was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Smith, 33, Mr Gerald
McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland, 25, who deny murdering Mr Dunn in
Polton Street car park, Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on October 19 last year.
They also deny attempting to murder DC Duffy and two other men, John
Girdler and Duncan Milliken, in the car park on the same day. All three
are also charged with stealing #185,000 from the Bank of Scotland in
High Street, Bonnyrigg, moments earlier.
DC Duffy said he was off-duty on the day of the robbery. He was
speaking to ''Spike'' Milliken when he saw two men come out of the Bank
of Scotland and run towards him.
He then chased the two men into Polton Street car park, where they ran
towards a grey Ford Granada which had its engine running. One of the men
got into the car, but as the second man opened the door DC Duffy kicked
it shut and started to struggle with him.
''He produced a gun. It was a revolver. He brought it up and fired at
me. He aimed it at my body. I thought it wasn't as loud as it should
have been. I thought it was a blank. I started struggling with him
again. I tried to get a grip of him in a bear hug.''
The man raised the gun up again and fired again. By this time DC Duffy
had managed to get hold of the gun and was holding it down and away from
himself.
''It was the same sound as before. Again I thought it's not as loud as
it should be. It's blanks.'' He managed to get the man on the ground,
knock the gun from his grasp, and push it away.
By this time, Mr Girdler and Mr Milliken had arrived on the scene and
ripped off a stocking-mask from the man on the ground. DC Duffy
identified the man as Mr McQuade.
There were still two men in the Granada, the driver and someone in the
back.
The rear offside door of the Granada opened. ''An arm and a head
appeared and another gun was produced, a semi-automatic pistol. It was
fired twice at myself, Girdler, Milliken and the man we had on the
ground. Again, it wasn't the sound I would have expected. It was quieter
than normal.
''I said to Milliken I thought it was blanks. Could he go and get the
person.'' Mr Milliken opened the driver's door, reached in, pulled out
the ignition key and threw it away.
Mr Milliken then pulled the driver out and held him on the ground. He
was not masked and DC Duffy identified him as Mr Bootland. He was not
the man who fired the shots from the car.
A semi-automatic pistol was found on the ground near where Mr Bootland
had been held.
DC Duffy said that the third man was still in the car and had moved
towards the front.
''An old man ran up to the front passenger door. He had a shopping
carrier-bag. I saw him reach in, bending down into the vehicle. He
appeared to be struggling with someone.
''There were two shots. Mr Dunn took three steps backwards then fell
to the ground. The shots appeared to come from the car. As he fell
backwards his right arm was outstretched and he was still holding his
bag of messages.''
DC Duffy was asked if he would recognise the man who had shot at him
from the car and he said Mr Robert Smith resembled the man in height and
build.
The trial continues.

A COMBINATION of the Dornoch Bridge, improvements to the A9, and a low
level of policing has been blamed for a spate of break-ins in a village.
There were three robberies on Golspie's Main Street in the early hours
of yesterday, and Regional Councillor David MacRae, who lives in the
Sutherland village, said these incidents were becoming more frequent.
At Mr Ronald MacDonald's Spar store thieves thought to be a
professional gang from the south stole #3000 worth of cigarettes. It was
the second robbery Mr MacDonald had suffered in two weeks.
At Alexander Morrison the bakers, #700 worth of damage was done when
the thieves took a heavy safe downstairs and carried it out to a back
lane using two scaffolding poles and a trolley. It is thought they were
disturbed by the bakers arriving for work at 4am.
The proprietor, Mr Sandy Morrison, said: ''It was just an awful effort
for nothing in our case. Bakers are not known for keeping large amounts
of money on their premises. It is just a nuisance and a mess for a
couple of packets of cigarettes.''
At the Stag's Head Hotel the thieves got away with more than #500 in
cash from a gaming machine, cigarette machine, and cash registers. There
was several hundred pounds worth of damage.
Mr MacRae said it was ''very worrying'' because was is becoming more
and more frequent. ''There is no doubt in my mind that the improvements
made to the A9 and the opening of the Dornoch Bridge have made it far
easier for thieves to travel up from the south and get away.
''I am also concerned, however, by the level of policing. As far as I
know there was only one policeman on duty last night from Kinbrace to
Dornoch. That is a distance of about 50 miles which encompasses three
villages: Helmsdale, Brora, and Golspie.''
He said it was easy to close off the exits at the Dornoch Bridge and
at Bonar Bridge, and police night patrols could stop cars and ask people
what they were doing there in the middle of the night.
Chief Inspector Jim Heddle, the Caithness and Sutherland force
commander, denied there had been only one officer on duty.
He added: ''We do have patrols stopping cars but we don't want to do
it at the same point every night. That would be self-defeating.''
He conceded that the bridge and road improvements had made it easier
for people to come up from the south, from the Inverness area as well as
the central belt. ''But having said that there were break-ins in
Sutherland long before the bridge.''

THE Government has been accused by the powerful Aberdeen Fish
Merchants' and Curers' Association of bribery and cynicism over its use
of decommissioning funds.
Its chief executive, Mr Robert Milne, claimed the Government was
sacrificing one of the country's few remaining assets on the altar of
short-term gain.
In the association's quarterly magazine, Mr Milne said that
decommissioning money was meant to reduce fishing effort in the name of
conservation. ''It should not be used to allow other fishermen to take
over our fishing grounds,'' he said.
''Yet the Government has proved it is willing to use decommissioning
money as a sop to buy off political rebellion over a fisheries deal
allowing Spanish fishermen more access to Western waters.
''We feel this is the worst possible abuse of the decommissioning
principle and fish stocks are being put in jeopardy by a recklessly
short-term policy which is hopelessly blinkered in its approach to
fisheries management.''
He said that in its bid to curry political favour the Government had
put fish stocks at risk and blown a gaping hole in conservation policy.
''Buying off a group of Tory MPs with a #28m decommissioning cash
bonus must be one of the most politically cynical exercises any
Government has indulged in as far as fisheries are concerned.
''It reveals as nonsense all those statements trotted out over the
years to the effect that decommissioning cash was very hard to come by.
''Now, it seems, there is a bottomless pit in cash terms when the
political stakes are high enough.''
Mr Milne said that the Aberdeen association supported the Scottish
Fish Merchants' Federation in its criticism of the Government for
''shamelessly'' putting political survival before the conservation needs
of not only this but future generations.
He said the new package had to be seen for what it was -- a means by
which British fishing tonnage would be removed to make way for eager
Spanish fishermen in ever-increasing numbers.
The proposals would not reduce the effort applied to fish stocks but
would pass the right to fish from redundant Scottish vessels to the
Spanish and Portuguese fleet.
Mr Milne said: ''If we as a UK industry accept a reduction in fishing
effort then our savings must not simply be passed over to the Iberians.
What we really need is a package of measures to take us into the next
century.
''The Government must accept the need for more research into stock
assessment; more research into conservation methods; more funds for fish
marketing; more funds for the development of better and more efficient
working practices; more funds for technical and logical developments to
assist in production methods; more funds for attracting high calibre
employees into the industry; more funds to upgrade fish markets to meet
all legislation; and more funds to identify the best way to sustain the
yield.''
He added that there could not be an imbalance in the distribution of
funds to the industry and there was a need for a clear strategy rather
than a short-term, stop-gap policy.
''The Government should not allow any change to the current effort
that is in place until a full investigation is carried out on the
devastating social and economic problems that the industry is now
facing.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday gave another hint of what the new
Clause 4 will look like when he pledged to enshrine equal rights for
women in the party's revised constitution.
And he warned that the days of full-time jobs for men, with life-long
job security, were over. A Labour government, he said, would seek to
encourage flexibility in the workplace for both sexes, including
childcare and nursery education for under-fives.
Childcare and nursery education, which Labour has pledged to make a
priority, were not just women's issues, he said. ''It is a woman's and a
man's issue. It is a people's issue, because it is of benefit to all
parents who want it for their children.''
His speech was part of a one-day conference organised by Labour MP
Clare Short which brought together representatives of more than 150
women's organisations, from the Women's Institute to the British
Federation of Women Graduates.
Mr Blair emphasised the need to place the rights of women at the
centre of the political agenda. ''The vast majority of British women
today, whatever their age or education or current circumstances, would
say without much hesitation that they are better off than their mothers
were. The problem is that they fear that their daughters will be worse
off than them.
''The key challenge we have to address is how we make sure that does
not happen, and how instead the next generation of women and men
continue to make progress,'' he said.
The Labour Party may have been founded by working men, but it had been
at the forefront of the struggle for sexual equality. Although there
were 38 women Labour MPs, he said, ''we can hardly call ourselves a
proud representative democracy when less than 10% of MPs are women''.
Despite radical economic and social change, the position of women was
barely improving, he said. In the NHS, 80% of employees were women, but
only 7% were senior managers. And women part-time workers earned on
average only 57% of their male counterparts.
He called for a change in politics to reflect the interests of women.
''A recent poll of young women found that four of 10 said they had
absolutely no interest in politics. They are not interested in politics
because they sense that politics is not interested in them.''
Mr Blair, whose wife Cherie Booth is a successful barrister, said
Labour wanted to encourage flexibility. ''There is no going back to the
world of full-time jobs paying men a family wage, with life-time
security, a guaranteed pension and a carriage clock at the end of it.''
The project to reform the party constitution and rewrite Clause 4
should take into account the need to promote equality. ''The struggle
for equality for women is an essential part of my vision of the values
and ideals of the new Labour Party.
''For over 70 years we have lived with a constitution that makes no
mention of equality or action against discrimination. I believe that is
a historic failure. The new Clause 4 . . . should commit the party
constitution to things that the party itself has been fighting for since
it was started.
''And that means a commitment to equal treatment for all human beings,
men and women. We believe in it. It is right. And it should be enshrined
in our constitution.''

FEARS of Brussels gaining control over immigration into the United
Kingdom were intensified yesterday when the EU Commission indicated it
had plans to ban all passport controls within 15 member countries.
A Commission official said: ''The problem for Britain is that our
internal borders within the EU are also our external borders with the
rest of the world.''
The Commission claims that free movement within member states would
mean the 15 countries removing national border controls in favour of
tougher controls at the EU's external borders.
This seemed to confirm the worst fears of Mr Charles Wardle, who
resigned on Sunday from the Government on the grounds that the Prime
Minister was not taking this issue seriously.
Mr Major was still reorganising the junior ranks of his Government
last night to cope with Mr Wardle's resignation. Another Minister has to
be found to replace him at Trade and Industry and this means other moves
within the Government if Mr Major is not looking to his back benchers.
Itis proving difficult for the Prime Minister to replace Mr Wardle
without altering the delicate pro and anti-Europe balance in his
Governnent.
Mr Major rests his case on the deal negotiated by his predecessor
Margaret Thatcher at a Euro summit 10 years ago which gave Britain an
''opt-out'' on immigration matters.
Mr Wardle, who was reshuffled last July to Trade and Industry from his
Home Office immigration post, insists that this declaration will not
stand up against the Treaty of Rome or Maastricht or in the European
courts.
He has declared that he is so concerned about an uncontrolled influx
of immigrants from all over the world that he had to return to the back
benches to make a case.
He said he had spoken to Mr Major three times on this issue in the
last two years, but Mr Major told him the position was covered by the
1985 declaration by heads of government.
Downing Street insisted yesterday that the Commission and the European
Court placed great weight on summit declarations agreed unanimously by
heads of government.
Euro-rebel Sir Teddy Taylor said he was unsurprised by yesterday's
move from the EU Commission.
He said if Britain were to be challenged in the European court and
lost, any person resident in Western Europe or a visitor to Europe would
be free to come into the UK.
He said: ''The only answer is to do what Charles Wardle has proposed,
namely to seek to have a clause in the oncoming 1996 Treaty which
preserves the right of the United Kingdom to control the admission of
all non-EU nationals and the citizens of the overseas territories of
member states.''
Downing Street denies this, claiming that the Thatcher agreement at
the 1985 summit is still firm.
If there was any move to change this, the Prime Minister would veto
it. However, with the drive for economic and political union, Mr Major
could be out-manoeuvred over the next two years on this issue and move
too late to stop it.
This is why Mr Wardle resigned. He insists there is a backdoor left
open to uncontrolled mass-immigration into the UK.
''What I am determined to do is to see that the crucial Article 7A of
the Treaty of Rome is put on the agenda for the forthcoming
inter-Governmental conference next year,'' he said.
He claims that the Thatcher concession is ''not worth the paper it is
written on'' and that Mr Major had ''ducked'' the issue at the
Maastricht negotiations.
TodayMr Major is expected to have completed the delicate readjustments
now required in his junior ranks to try to meet the divided feelings
within his party.

A WOMAN appeared in court yesterday accused of abducting four-day-old
baby Lydia Owens and was remanded on bail to a psychiatric hospital.
Susan Brooke, 39, of Rhyl, Clwyd, was accused of taking Lydia from the
lawful control of her mother, Mrs Christine Owens, at Glan Clwyd
Hospital, Bodelwyddan, on Friday.
She stood in the dock before magistrates at Prestatyn, Clwyd, flanked
by two police officers and spoke only to confirm her name, address, and
age.
Then the clerk read the charge to her in detail and she was allowed to
sit while Miss Louise Evans, defending, made an application for bail,
calling psychiatrist Dr Thomas Llewellyn of North Wales Hospital,
Denbigh, to make a statement in support of her application.
At the end of the 75-minute proceedings the chairman of the
magistrates, Mrs Sarah Glazebrook, said Mrs Brooke would be granted bail
on condition that she became a resident patient at the North Wales
Hospital, Denbigh, did not discharge herself and agreed to abide by all
the rules and regulations of the hospital.
She also told Mrs Brooke that she would have to remain in the locked
ward at all times unless accompanied by staff.
Mrs Brooke was remanded until February 27.

MANY parents have been worrying about the impact the dismantling of
Strathclyde region will have on the special needs sector of education.
When services and areas have been divided up into 12 districts with
local responsibilities, priorities are guaranteed to change.
My personal concern is for my son's future. With his specific language
disorder, he needs intensive specialist help to achieve his educational
potential.
And although he is lucky enough to be receiving that help at present
in a language unit, is there any guarantee he will continue to receive
it in the future?
What if we as a family move house to a different single-tier council,
but one still close enough to his school?
Will he be able to remain in his present school, or would he be
expected to fit into the provision provided in the new area?
The trouble is, even if there is provision in the new area, there
would certainly be a waiting list to get in. Where would that leave him?
On a broader level, my concern is as a member of the Association For
All Speech Impaired Children.
Language disorders are complex and difficult to treat, but they happen
in four in 5000 of the population.
The majority of sufferers are boys, and no-one knows exactly why.
These children need intensive speech therapy and a supported educational
environment.
The fact is that, at the moment, not all children with speech/language
disorders are being appropriately placed in educational establishments.
Strathclyde Region's education (special needs) department has made
great strides in recent years.
It has increased provision considerably for both language disordered
children and for children suffering from the often-related, and usually
more severe, condition of autism.
While the plight of autistic children has been highly publicised in
recent years, language-disordered children have never had the high
profile. Consequently, the public remains largely unaware of their
problems, or even existence.
However, Glasgow AFASIC has been working away in the background for
years, and when the campaign for more provision, particularly for speech
therapy, was mounted on behalf of autistic children, the education
department increased provision for both areas of special needs.
Richmond Park language unit in Glasgow has had its size increased
considerably from six classes with 36 pupils to eight with 48, despite a
shortage of space.
While our association welcomes the efforts to create desperately
needed places for pupils, we have to express concern about the language
unit being over-expanded. According to studies, the optimum size for
units of this kind is about 24.
Added to the large numbers, the staff have to cope with the problems
of inadequate space. Two large cloakrooms are used as storage areas and,
by squeezing some desks into the corners, also as office space and
speech therapy rooms.
The corridor between the classrooms and the cloakrooms is lined with
shelves and cupboards overflowing with resource materials.
There is no extra room that can be used, as was once the case, to
invite groups of parents to open days once a month.
A new language unit, destined to be accommodated in St Charles'
Primary, Maryhill, is currently using temporary accommodation in John
Bosco Secondary, Hutchesontown, across the road from the Richmond Park
unit. It has two classes of six full-time pupils, with four attending
part-time, giving a total of 14 full-time places.
Despite this increased provision, both Richmond Park and the
prospective St Charles language units have waiting lists, as does the
West Mains language school in East Kilbride.
The intake for the new St Charles unit also consisted of primary one
age children. Our association is concerned about older children out
there still struggling in mainstream schools, trying to get by because
there are no places available to give them the specialist help they need
and are legally entitled to.
If Strathclyde Region, with all its resources, cannot afford to make
improvements in these areas of educational provision, what hope is there
when the responsibility for special needs is handed over to the new
councils?
Their budgets will be cut according to the size of their area and
population. What is not taken into account is the fact that some
children will have to cross boundaries to reach the specialist provision
they need, but which might not be supplied in their own area.
The councils are bound to take the local view of serving the needs of
their own community first before trying to accommodate children from
outside.
At best, this will lead to bureaucratic delays. At worst, it could
mean that children will miss out on the special education they are
entitled to.
What likelihood is there of small district councils initiating
expensive new provision in their areas, with small budgets to pay for
them?
Our association hopes that the 12 councils will agree to form some
sort of special needs forum to work together in the best interests of
all our children with special needs.

<HEADLINE>#100m in windfall benefits handed out to executives of privatised utilities, claims Brown    Labour urges curb on share options</HEADLINE>

EIGHT directors of the Scottish power-generating companies hold
executive share options worth more than #3.7m, according to figures
produced by Labour. In all, the party said, #100m in benefits had been
handed out to executives of privatised utilities in Britain.
The latest figures show that the 12 privatised regional electricity
companies in England and Wales had handed out share options worth more
than #50m to 65 directors -- more than #750,000 per director.
Labour claimed that a further #16m in share options handed out to the
directors of the new private water companies south of the Border had
pushed privatisation benefits for executives in all privatised utilities
to more than #100m.
In Scotland, the windfall has largely been for four directors of
ScottishPower, who hold options worth #3,340,956 -- nearly #840,000 each
-- at yesterday's share price. They could be worth more depending on
when the options are exercised.
At Scottish Hydro-Electric, four directors share a far more modest
#378,294 in options. The total for 145 directors of privatised utilities
UK-wide is #101,022,348.
Last night, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said Labour would table
amendments to the Finance Bill currently being considered by the Commons
to curb privatisation excesses.
''Privatised industry remuneration packages are a new form of daylight
robbery,'' he said, ''a raid on millions of consumers paying more
because of them.''
Share option packages are a popular way of remuneration for top
executives. They allow directors to buy a number of the company's shares
at a low fixed price and resell them at a later date at their higher
market value.
The figures, based on annual reports and yesterday's share price for
each utility, are part of Labour's campaign to highlight what the party
considers executive pay excesses.
Of the regional electricity companies, the highest share option total
on offer is Seeboard's #7.8m for six directors. Among the water
companies North-west Water is offering #4.9m to five directors.
Among the country's five power generating companies, the packages
offered by ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric are dwarfed by those from
National Power (#7.2m) and Powergen (#15.2m).
Mr Brown added: ''We are now able to show how huge sums, unjustified
by effort, possible only because of monopoly, are being paid out. I
challenge Tory MPs to support our new proposals to curb boardroom
excesses when they are debated in the House of Commons.

<HEADLINE>Scotland's crime rate attacked. Labour fury at rise in violence behind overall fall in figures. Labour on the attack over 'truth behind' crime figures</HEADLINE>

A POLITICAL row erupted last night over recorded crime figures in
Scotland despite their being down 3%, the third annual fall in a row.
Opposition MPs claim the figures hide ''a brutal truth'': that
Scotland is becoming a more dangerous place.
There is an overall drop but crimes of violence -- which include
murders, serious assault, and handling offensive weapons -- are again on
the increase. Also up are vandalism, fire-raising, and car offences,
ranging from speeding to drink driving.
The statistics for 1994, released by the Scottish Office yesterday,
also suggest the long-running spiral of drugs-related crime is
continuing upwards.
The 3% fall in crime compares poorly with the 8% reduction recorded by
Scottish police forces in 1993. When miscellaneous and motor vehicle
offences are included, bringing the total up to 990,981, the figures in
fact show a 1% increase.
In a brief statement, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, Scottish Home Affairs
Minister, made no reference to any of the rises revealed in the
Government Statistical Service's release.
He hailed the 3% overall fall in recorded crime as good news, and
added: ''This is the third year running that the crime figures have
dropped.''
Just two out of the seven crime or offence categories, which are
grouped for statistical purposes, actually show falls, albeit including
housebreakings which are another key public concern on law and order.
The overall drop is due almost entirely to a 7% decrease in the
dishonesty category, down by 24,591 to 350,346, which embraces
shoplifting and fraud as well as housebreakings. Crimes of indecency
fell by 1%.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''Any cut is welcome,
but it is typical of this Government to hide behind one figure when the
brutal truth is behind the other figures.''
Mr Robertson added: ''It is clear that some crimes that affect people
in their daily lives are on the increase. What is needed is a major
crackdown in these areas. It also needs resources and the commitment of
Government. But it seems they are interested only in juggling figures
rather than in tackling crime.''
Crimes of violence rose by 2% from 19,404 to 19,744. Although down on
the 1992 high of 23,300, the latest figures are still some 20% higher
than recorded 10 years ago.
Vandalism and fire-raising rose by 5% to 88,543; motor vehicle
offences increased 5% to 330,724; and miscellaneous offences also jumped
by 5% to 133,193.
So-called ''other'' crimes rose by 7% to 62,403. ''Other'' crimes
includes drugs-related offences. It is likely a sharp rise in drugs'
possession will be revealed when more detailed statistics are made
available in the Recorded Crime in Scotland bulletin for 1994, to be
published later this year.
Clear-up rates increased by 3%, to 37%, although it still meant almost
two out of three crimes last year remain unsolved. For each police
officer in Scotland, 37 crimes were recorded and 14 were cleared-up.
Strathclyde recorded almost half of all crimes, some 269,983. But the
region, along with Grampian, had the worst clear-up rates of Scotland's
eight police forces -- 34%.
Clear-up rates elsewhere ranged from 37% in Lothian and Borders to 59%
in Northern.
Strathclyde's clear-up rates for violence and vandalism stood at 57%
for crimes of violence, and only 15% for vandalism and fire-raising. The
respective national averages were 64% and 20%.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman stressed that crime in the region had
fallen by 5%, which was better than the national average. The region
also had 50,000 fewer crimes a year than in 1991.
He added crimes of violence rose by only 85 to 12,356 last year, but
still remained several thousands down on the 1992 figure.
The spokesman, who argued the scale of Strathclyde crime is such that
comparisons with smaller forces are difficult, emphasised that its
detection rates have improved by 8% since 1991, when it stood at 26%.
The official went on: ''There has been a distinct improvement in our
detection rates, and we are looking to improve on them.''
Strathclyde's own figures will be released next month by Chief
Constable Leslie Sharp, whose latest crime-busting initiative, Operation
Turnkey, will show a dramatic reduction in housebreakings.
Lord Fraser, in his statement, suggested the fall in recorded Scottish
crime -- down by 15,949 to 572,064 -- was due partly to people being
more careful in looking after their property.
He also thought the improvement reflected chief constables' concerns
in shifting resources to the targeting of known criminals, as well as
enhanced technological support available for solving crimes.
Mr John McFall, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said the figures do
not present ''a good picture'', even if down from the 1991 high of
589,562. He alleged Government inaction on law and order and its
economic policies will mean it is inevitable that crimes involving
violence or drugs will rise.
Mr McFall said: ''We have social conditions in which the rich get
richer and the poor get poorer. Until it recognises the social damage
being caused by its economic policies, and its lack of action on drugs,
increases in certain categories will continue.''
A Scottish Office spokesman stressed that all figures on crimes,
including violence and vandalism, were within the release. It was also
recorded that the overall fall was ''due almost entirely to the fall in
the number of recorded crimes of dishonesty, although this itself was
partly offset by increases in other categories''.

As Valentine's Day dawns not with a bang but with a whimper, MARCELLA
EVARISTI ponders the crying game we call romance.
WHEN I realised that I did not know precisely why St Valentine was
associated with lovers and romance I borrowed a book on the Lives of the
Saints and was immediately returned to a long-past convent-school world,
where there was a saint for every occasion and profession. Of course, I
remembered the obvious ones such as St Jude being on call for Hopeless
Cases and St Cecilia being the patron saint of Music.
Sarcastic mention of these two was constantly made by our teachers
before the prelims and during choir practice. Inwardly groaning at their
strained humour, we Teenagers of the Forced Smile would voice our own
silent prayer: ''Oh Maria Goretta of the Little Children, hearken to our
wish, shared by Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, that we may die
before we get old. So that we never sound like that. Ever. Amen.''
But I cannot remember being told about St Laurence, the Patron Saint
of Cooks. I liked the sound of him. St Larry of the Licking Fingers. I
imagined him plucking herbs in from the garden with fervour and
reverence or transforming some exquisite Chablis into something even
more miraculous. I could see him swooning with sensual piety (or pious
sensualism) as his souffle aux epinards rose inexorably heavenwards.
Perhaps the school was scared to invoke his name in case Laurence,
wildly waving his moulinette, returned to cast out the dinner ladies for
their culinary sacrilege, like Jesus chucking out the traders in the
temple. Marco Pierre White directed by Pasolini . . . well, it was a
mouthwatering fantasy until I read on and discovered that poor Lorenzo
was a Roman martyr and the tenuous food connection was that he silently
submitted to his fate of being roasted to death.
After this it was quite a relief to find out that the Valentine
love-connection derived from the centuries-old belief that birds chose
their mates on February 14, on his feast day. Could have been much
worse. Given Laurence Roti, the reasons for Valentine being the patron
saint of love could have been . . . but, no, the analogies are too sick
to contemplate.
But contemplating them did remind me of a poster I saw in the pharmacy
of the health clinic where I was waiting for a prescription. At first,
when I saw the red rose I thought for a daft fleeting moment that it was
a Labour Party poster, which would have been apt but unlikely, but then
I noticed that the stem of the rose had a discreet little bandage around
its middle. ''Are you worried about love sickness?'' it said, or some
coy euphemism to that effect. Yes, and some young advertising blade had
been given the VD project, and come up with roses where once there had
been rashes.
Actually, I was about to write down the exact wording, down to which
ward in the Southern General, the no-need-for-appointments stuff, but
though my hand furtively groped inside my handbag for my pen several
times, I have to come clean and admit I couldn't be seen writing that
stuff down. Imagine smiling around that room and saying: ''Honestly,
it's for an article I'm writing for The Herald.'' So I just sat there
thinking about romance, my son's ear infection and how since Aids you
never hear people harping on about herpes anymore.
Then I imagined somebody lovelorn getting their unloved ass over to
the clinic of lovesickness, having misunderstood the poster. Imagined
them after an hour of shame waiting, being given a number and finally
getting the interview, the venereal audition:
General Southern: Can you briefly tell me your symptoms?
Unloved Ass: Night sweats. No sleep. Ah.
General Southern: Could you be more specific?
Unloved Ass: I hurt deep down.
General Southern: Is that testicular?
Unloved Ass: I beg your pardon?
General Southern: Do you know why you are here?
Unloved Ass: Without her, no. I saw your poster.
General Southern: And your partner's symptoms?
Unloved Ass: Cold heart. She leaves her answermachine on when she's
washing her hair for another man.
General Southern: I think you may be in the wrong place.
Unloved Ass: That's what she says. Her nape smelt of salt popcorn.
Could you call her ''my partner'' again? Slowly.
General Southern: Am I to take it that you are not, in fact, sexually
active?
Unloved Ass: Not for want of crying, doctor.
But of course, crying is the whole point of romantic love, the reason
for the roses and the corny reading of late-night John Donne, and the
masochistic re-reading of old letters, and all the
(banal-unless-it's-you) boo hoo of it. Otherwise it just wouldn't be the
same. Madama Butterfly should have flung open the shutters and sung:
''To hell with you Pinkerton, you imperialist bastard, you're not worth
a hair of my oriental head!'' Her family would have been relieved, Anna
Raeburn would have applauded, and the son of Madama need not have been
taken into care. But it just wouldn't be the same.
So Happy Valentine's Day to St Laurence, Maria Goretti, to chucked
adolescents, and jilted beds, to Puccini, and Maria Callas, and, gentle
reader, to you.

TALKS will be held tomorrow at the conciliation service, Acas, in a
bid to avert a pay strike by Clydesdale Bank staff.
About two-thirds of the bank's 6000 staff are members of the Banking,
Insurance, and Finance union and are due to stage a one-day walkout on
Friday.
Last week, the bank imposed a pay package, with increases of between
3% and 7% for ''satisfactory'' performers, but the union is seeking 4%
for all staff, with an extra 2.75% based on performance.
Yesterday, Bifu said it was not optimistic about settling the dispute.
Mr Keith Brookes, Bifu assistant secretary, said: ''We will be looking
for more money on the table and serious discussions about the bank's
current performance pay system.''
A spokesman for the Clydesdale said: ''The purpose of these talks is
to explore options for averting industrial action.''
Bifu members recently voted in favour of a series of one-day strikes
if no settlement can be reached. The union has claimed that many of the
bank's 325 branches, almost all of which are in Scotland, would be
forced to close on the strike days -- a claim the bank denies.
Talks are also to be held at Acas over a pay dispute at the Yorkshire
Bank, where workers voted narrowly against strike action after rejecting
a separate pay offer.
Both banks are owned by the National Australia Group.

SIX hundred student smokers yesterday protested over a cigarette ban
at their college.
They held a ''smoke-in'' to demand that Perth College provide
designated smoking rooms.
They occupied a common room, where they had previously been allowed to
smoke, in a lunchtime demonstration at the college.
Since the start of term a blanket ban on smoking has forced students
and staff to stand outside if they want a cigarette.
The non-smoking student president, George McCurrach, said: ''Students'
civil rights have been infringed and they aren't happy about it.
''We're looking for a special smoking room so non-smokers aren't
affected.''
David Joyce, 25, studying horticulture, said: ''A lot of pople have
stopped smoking, but smokers still have rights.''
But the college maintains that the ban was introduced following a
questionnaire distributed to 537 students and to staff last year.
According to the college, 90% of students and 97% of staff surveyed
wanted either a total ban or restrictions.
The college's Principal, Mr Michael Webster, said: ''There were
literally hundreds of people surveyed. People had the chance to reply.
The big majority was against a smoking atmosphere.''
Mr Webster added that he had already written to the student
association ''pointing out the college's policy and why we reached that
policy''.

* A GROUP of British war veterans travelled to Tokyo recently to seek
compensation for the torture and abuse they received in Japanese
prisoner of war camps. In interviews, the veterans spoke movingly of the
treatment they were forced to endure and the effects it had on their
health. For many young Japanese, the veterans' testimony came as a
shock.
GLOBE-TROTTING Japanese students are often surprised to hear
criticisms of their country's conduct during the 1930s and 1940s.
It is not that they condone the actions of their wartime leaders, some
of whom were hanged as war criminals. It is because they have so little
knowledge of the atrocities that were committed.
At school, Japanese pupils receive a very ''sanitised'' version of the
events of thos dark days.
Details of atrocities such as the notorious massacre of Nanking in
1937, when the Japanese army raped and murdered tens of thousands of
Chinese civilians, have been omitted from school textbooks.
Many history texts describe the 1931 invasion of China as ''an
advance'' and largely ignore unpalatable events such as the infamous
Bataan Death March, the use of forced labour to build the Burma Railway,
and the terrible conditions inflicted on prisoners of war.
The whole period of the 1930s and 1940s is given only limited
attention in many textbooks. In one text, only 16 pages out of 358 are
devoted to the far-reaching and catastrophic events, from the Marco Polo
Bridge Incident of 1937 to the start of the Tokyo War Trials in 1946.
Through its tight control of the curriculum, and the textbooks used in
schools, the Japanese Ministry of Education, or Monbusho, dictates what
is taught.
The Monbusho screens every textbook to make sure the information being
presented to pupils conforms to its detailed requirements.
Texts deviating from the guidelines are sent back to their authors for
revision.
One history text was rejected because it contained descriptions of
Japan's infamous 731 Unit which carried out human body experiments on
Chinese prisoners of war.
More than 300 other descriptions in the book were also considered to
be incorrect or inappropriate.
The many critics of textbook screening say the policy violates the
academic freedom of authors and allows the Monbusho to give a distorted
view of controversial issues.
Similar distortions are common in popular literature, cinema, and
television, which tend to dwell on what the Western powers did to the
Japanese rather than what the Japanese did to their East Asian
neighbours and their Western opponents.
Several textbook authors have tried to present a more balanced view of
the country's war history by challenging the Monbusho's policy in the
courts.
By refusing young Japanese access to the full facts, they argue, the
Monbusho is guilty of unconstitutional censorship.
However, the courts have repeatedly ruled that the Ministry of
Education has the right to determine the content of school texts.
More complaints have come from South Korea, China, and the other
countries in East Asia that suffered from Japanese aggression.
The South Korean government, for example, demanded that Japanese
children be taught about the Korean females who were recruited as
''comfort women'' and forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers.
The complaints from South Korea, China, and other East Asian states at
a time when Japan wants to forge closer political and economic ties with
its neighbours have encouraged the Monbusho to review the content of
school history texts.
Last year saw the introduction of several new textbooks that provide
more graphic descriptions of Japan's brutal occupation of Korea and the
invasion of China.
In a statement, the Monbusho agreed that consideration must be given
to events in modern history that concern both Japan and its neighbours.
One new textbook goes as far as listing excerpts from a speech made by
the Japanese Prime Minister which apologised for the pain inflicted by
Japan's wartime army.
Critics have welcomed the new textbooks, but say the accounts of
Japan's wartime conduct still do not go far enough.

TRACES of the potentially deadly bug said to have been responsible for
a rash of food-poisoning cases in West Lothian were found in cattle
faeces from one of the 17 farms which supplied milk to the dairy
allegedly involved in the outbreak, a court heard yesterday.
The bacterium was also traced in a bulk tanker of raw milk from one of
the dairy's suppliers and in two of 14 swab samples taken from equipment
in the dairy itself, Sheriff John Young heard at Linlithgow Sheriff
Court.
However, the sheriff was told on the opening day of the trial of the
husband and wife operators of the Redhouse Dairy, Seafield Road,
Blackburn, West Lothian, that no trace of E-coli 0157 was ever found in
milk from the premises.
On trial are Mr Robert Haston, 42, and his wife, Margaret, 40, of
Marbert House, Redhouse Dairy, who trade as R &amp; M Haston.
They deny three charges under the 1990 Food Safety Act: selling milk
unfit for human consumption, selling milk which was not of the nature,
substance, and quality demanded by the buyers; and depositing with and
consigning to others milk that was unfit for human consumption. All
three charges allege that the milk involved was contaminated with E-coli
0157 organisms.
The court heard from Dr Pauline Upton, 51, consultant in public health
medicine in Lothian, that 69 people were affected in the food-poisoning
outbreak, 32 of them under the age of five and that 93% of the total
were discovered to have ingested the dairy's milk.
Six of the children had to undergo kidney dialysis, but one of them,
two-year-old Clare Davison, of Bathgate, had died. Two of the children
were still receiving the treatment nine months after the outbreak.
Dr Upton said there had never been any bacteriological evidence
showing that the bug had been coming from the Hastons' dairy.
Mrs Rosemary Barrett, 43, a technical officer with West Lothian
District Council's environmental health department, told the court that
swab samples taken from a pipe leading to the bottling machine and from
a bottling machine rubber had tested positively for E-coli 0157.
She told the court that 17 feeder farms supplied raw milk to Redhouse.
At one particular farm, which she did not name, 14 out of 15 faecal
tests were positive.
Mrs Barret recalled how, during the investigation, she told Mr Haston
that the dairy was believed to be implicated in the food-poisoning
outbreak and he was ''absolutely stunned''.
Under cross-examination she agreed that the bug was never found in any
milk from the dairy. If there was such a claim, it would have to have
arisen either because the dairy's pasteurisation system was not working
properly or through contamination after pasteurisation
The trial continues.

SKILL shortages exacerbated by poaching of key staff are beginning to
force up pay awards in Scotland's electronics sector, according to the
latest report from Incomes Data Services.
By the end of last year virtually all pay settlements in the sector
were running above 3%. So far this year 40% of deals are running at over
4%, including a 5.8% rise for 400 workers at Lithgows Electronics in
Greenock.
National Semiconductors at Gourock is said to have increased salaries
by up to 25%, while Prestwick Multi-Tech has raised the starting salary
for a graduate engineer from #12-#13,000 to #15-#16,000.
IDS also mentions an unnamed large computer company that has agreed to
average rises of 6% for sales, servicing, and engineering staff from
April with some key staff being offered up to 18% in an attempt to stop
''headhunting'' by competitors.
At Exacta Circuits Ltd, in Selkirk, an offer of 4.5% has been rejected
and the 700 employees are contemplating industrial action.
Settlements reached so far this year include: 4% for the 560 staff of
Apricot Computers at Glenrothes; merit increases of up to 4% for 1700
employed by Honeywell Control Systems in Lanarkshire,;and 2.5% to 4%
rise (plus #105 profit share bonus) at Hughes Micro-Electronics,
Glenrothes.
Many electronics companies are still adjusting to the impact of
recession and changed demand, despite the pressure to increase salaries.
Philips Electronics has told its 10,000 UK employees, including the
250 at Airdrie, there will be no increase in basic salaries this year
although a profit-related pay scheme is to be introduced.

TRAINING both secondary and primary school teachers using a CD-i is
just one of the projects to be explored at the Open Learning Exhibition
to be held a week on Thursday in Glenrothes.
The Scottish Interactive Technology Centre (SITC), based in Edinburgh,
is fronted by Byron Evans.
It develops products and materials for trainers to a specific brief,
using technologies that are available easily in the market place and
both stable and accessible.
His main market relates to the training of adults using the CD-i Rom.
Although SITC also produces CD-Rom materials, Evans feels that CD-i
gives a better video quality for a TV screen as opposed to a computer
monitor. It is also easier on the user, who doesn't need to know DOS or
Windows.
Evans says that the delivery system, developed originally for Scottish
schools, is CD-i for staff development and enhancing their professional
skills to introduce an additional dimension to training opportunities
for teachers within their own school environment.
The Scottish Office Education Department is supporting the use through
a number of grant arrangements with the local authorities, which could
be up to three quarters of the total cost.
With more than 1000 CD-i players in Scottish schools, all with Evans
software, it now makes training more user-friendly for both teachers and
management.
This is especially important in the run-up to the appraisal process
next year.
Evans feels the important elements of this is CD-i -- because there is
no keyboard, and response is to prompts on a TV screen.
Worthwhile contents, number one on this list, was additional help in
the appraisal process.
''If you know about the issues and difficulties before you do it,
there is a better chance that we will be friends at the end of it,''
says Evans.
SITC feel that they are on to a business winner. Evans adds:
''If other costs of training are looked at, this is often trainer-led.
''Twenty teachers out of different schools for a day, all with
different needs, working from different organisations, in front of
someone who may or may not know them terribly well for a fixed period of
time, they have to be replaced in their schools.
''Replacement costs are part of this. It is expensive.
Evans discovered the gap in the teacher training market 10 years ago
while working both as a geography principal teacher -- with the use of
computers -- and in the curriculum development service in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.

THE Student Loans Company has denied that allegations of corruption
are being investigated at its Glasgow headquarters.
Mr Robert Maclennan, the Liberal Democrat MP, yesterday met the
company's acting chief executive, Sir Eric Ash, to discuss the
mismanagement of loan applications for existing student borrowers, and
what he described as allegations of corruption under investigation by
accountants Coopers and Lybrand.
But Sir Eric took exception to the MP's description of the
investigation, saying he regretted the reference to allegations of
corruption.
He said: ''The word corruption is wholly inappropiate for an
investigation into some improprieties which are alleged to have taken
place between two and three years ago.''
Mr Maclennan, who is also a member of the Public Accounts Committee,
has called for the full results of the inquiry to be made public as soon
as possible.
He said yesterday: ''No interest is served by continued uncertainty
about the extent of the improprieties within the company.''
Coopers and Lybrand were called in by the Department for Education,
which had been sent allegations about the running of the company by the
Government's financial watchdog, the Comptroller and Auditor General Sir
John Bourn.
The allegations had been sent to Sir John's office by a former
employee of the company.
Sir Eric agreed with Mr Maclennan that the next three weeks were
critical for the company. The acting chief executive said the company
would by early March have draft proposals to put to higher education
administrators and student representatives for developing a repeat loan
application system which he was confident would work smoothly next year.
Many students suffered hardship between October and January because
the company's systems for processing repeat loan applications and
handling inquiries from anxious students failed.
But Mr Maclennan said after yesterday's meeting that he had been
impressed by the efforts that Sir Eric was making ''to tackle the
Herculean task which he took over''.
The company had one last chance to get it right, and the National
Audit Office inquiry into the efficiency and effectiveness of its
operations would reveal whether it had taken it, he said.
Sir Eric said the company's chief executive, Mr Ron Harrison, remained
on indefinite sick leave.
* Scotland's 43 colleges of further education will share nearly #230m
worth of funding in the financial year beginning in April.
A bigger proportion of their grants will be performance-related, with
colleges which recruit more students being rewarded with more money.
In the current year, 90% of college allocations from the Scottish
Office is based on historic funding levels, with the remainder being
determined by the ability to attract more students through the door.
For 1995-6, 60% of funding will be based on this year's grant-in-aid
levels, while the remainder will be performance-related.
Scottish Education Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said the
breakdown in allocations to individual colleges balanced the need to
move to funding based on levels of student activity while giving
institutions the stability to plan for the future.
The Government has held back 2% of funding worth about #4m this year
because college management and the lecturers' unions failed to agree at
national level on a pay rise linked to greater flexibility in working
conditions.
The money will be released to individual colleges when they settle
with their lecturers. No money will be held back for the forthcoming
year.
Scotland's biggest FE institution, Aberdeen College, will receive the
biggest allocation, nearly #13.4m.

TWO men accused of raping a 15-year-old girl after knocking her
unconscious were committed for trial at the sheriff court yesterday.
Applications for bail were refused and Mr Edward Townsley, 21, of
McDonald Court, and Mr William McIntyre, 17, of Fortingall Place, both
Perth, were remanded in custody. Mr Townsley is also charged with
breaking bail conditions. Neither made any plea.
Two others were accused of indecently assaulting another girl, also
15, on the same occasion, with intent to rape her. Mr George McPhee, 17,
of Leslie Court, and Mr James Sutherland, 17, of Malvina Place, both
Perth, made no plea and were released on bail.

Samac, Monday
THE Bosnian Serb Parliament today rejected yet again the latest peace
plan put forward by the big powers.
''The current proposal by the Contact Group cannot be accepted as a
basis for further negotiations,'' said MPs of the self-styled Bosnian
Serb Republic (RSK) after 11 hours' debate, ending in a majority vote.
Rejection of the latest peace proposals from Britain, Russia, the
United States, France, and Germany had been expected after Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic said he could not accept the plan, which the
parliament rejected last year.
The plan offers a virtual 50-50 division of Bosnia between a
Muslim-Croat confederation and the Bosnian Serbs, who now hold some 70%
of the land.
The MPs, uniting behind Karadzic to isolate a band of mavericks
pushing for peace under the Contact Group terms, tried to give at least
an impression of moderation, saying they remained open to talks with any
international mediators.
* The Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal today charged 21 Serbs with war
crimes and crimes against humanity at a concentration camp in Bosnia.
The UN tribunal in The Hague to start holding trials this spring --
the first international war crimes trials since the Second World War.
However only one of the suspects is in custody, raising doubts as to
whether the other 20 will ever be brought to justice.--Reuter/AP.

DETECTIVES yesterday appealed for help from the public as they
investigated the murder of a man convicted for molesting a child.
The body of Mr Lawrence Leydon, 36, was found in his home at
Southhouse Medway in the Southhouse area of Edinburgh at the weekend.
Police have refused to confirm a suggestion that vigilantes may have
been responsible for his death.
Mr Leydon, a joiner, was serving two years' probation for indecent
behaviour with a 10-year-old boy at an Edinburgh construction site in
April 1993. He appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on May 3 last year.
Detective Superintendent Alec Brown, who is heading the investigation
by Lothian and Borders Police, said: ''Mr Leydon was a loner and he may
not have been popular but whatever he may or may not have done, he did
not deserve to die in this brutal way.''
The police have refused to give details of the victim's injuries but
it is thought that he had been stabbed.
Mr Brown said: ''This was a savage and determined attack in his own
home. It is imperative that the public realise that no-one, for whatever
reason, is entitled to take the law into their own hands.
''A number of people may believe that they have knowledge of why this
attack was made and who was responsible. We would urge them to come
forward and speak to us.''
Police, who were yesterday involved in house-to-house inquiries, were
trying to establish Mr Leydon's movements on Saturday and asked anyone
who knew or who saw him to contact them.

<HEADLINE>Warrant sale couple win right to keep microwave</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979861734</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A COUPLE faced with a warrant sale for council tax arrears succeeded
yesterday in a court bid to keep their microwave.
Mr Alexander Donald, 53, and his wife, Margaret, 44, of Airdrie,
pleaded with a sheriff at Airdrie Sheriff Court not to take the
microwave , which had been valued at #25, because it was their only
means of cooking.
Their electric stove had not been included in a sheriff's officers'
poinding because, by law, they had to be left with cooking equipment.
However, the officers included the microwave in the list of items to
be sold at the warrant sale for council tax arrears of #606.04.
The couple's civilian representative, local council candidate Mr Kenny
McGuigan, appealed to Sheriff John Hall Stewart to release the
microwave.
He said that under section 16, part two, of the Debtors Scotland Act
1987 furniture, equipment, and utensils used for cooking, storing, or
eating food were exempt.
He said: ''They have an electric cooker, but only one ring works and
the microwave really is their main means of cooking hot meals.
''The couple are of low income and also have to care for a
five-year-old grandchild. The microwave is essential and should be
removed from the poinding schedule.
''So should an Amstrad double-deck video recorder which is not their
property.''
The sheriff agreed to release both items from the list.
The total realised from a warrant sale prior to the case was #150,
said Mr McGuigan.
That left a total value of saleable goods at #85, added Mr McGuigan,
who then asked for the sale to be declared invalid because of the amount
outstanding on the scehdule. Under section 24 of the act a sheriff can
rule that to carry on with the warrant sale would be futile.
However, the sheriff refused that appeal, which leaves a colour TV and
a bookcase to be sold off.

AN ATTACK on an elderly widow and the ransacking of her house may be
linked to the murder of a five-year-old boy, Irish police said
yesterday.
Chief Superintendent Tony Mulligan, the man leading the hunt for the
knifeman who killed Ciaran Malone, five, said: ''We are now twice as
anxious to catch this man.''
Police have named 21-year-old printer Jerome Kavanagh -- a neighbour
of the murdered boy -- as their chief suspect.
The hunt was concentrated in County Kildare, around Naas, where Ciaran
was stabbed to death on Saturday night. His aunt, Patricia, was injured
in the attack.
The murder scene is just five miles from Newbridge, where 72-year-old
Anne Curran was attacked and her house ransacked on Sunday night.
It was learned yesterday that Kavanagh's family, who live close to the
Malones in the small village of Caragh, had acted as baby-sitters for
Ciaran in the recent past.
Neighbour Pat Dolly said: ''The two families were very good friends.
When the Malones went on holiday four weeks ago, Ciaran was left with
the Kavanaghs. That was a regular thing.''
Relatives and friends of both families caught up in the tragedy
comforted each other at the regular morning Mass in Caragh's Roman
Catholic parish church yesterday.
Liam Kenney, one of Jerome Kavanagh's workmates at the Leinster Leader
newspaper, said the wanted man was ''a quiet, conscientious type''.
Meanwhile, police forensic experts were carrying out tests at thespot
where Mrs Curran was attacked in a bid to establish whether there was a
firm link between the crimes.
The injured woman was said to be in a Dublin hospital with serious
head injuries.
Later, police said around #500 was found in a bag on a river bank.
The cash was thought to have been stored as part of a possible plan to
flee the area.
Up to 120 police and troops were involved in the steadily extending
search operation.
A police spokesman reinforced warnings that the man they were seeking
could be dangerous.

GOOD fare at a dinner in Irvine on Friday will have potato soup and
grilled trout. There will be venison. Also, if they're lucky, clootie
dumpling. After much else, coffee will follow. With tablet, but. Even to
the pickiest of banqueteers it will be a rare old treat.
Sound dictionaries allow it to be said and spelt ''taiblet''. Once it
was called tablement. However confected, tablet remains one of the
deepest, sweetest secrets of the Scots kitchen. All winter I have been
trying to get it right.
Long sessions over a hot stove have taught much. In this world (here
is the biggest lesson) there are only two kinds of people. Some have the
magic. For tablet they are gifted. They just know how. And there are the
rest. In all their puff they will never do it.
Strictly, a third tribe exists, too small and helpless to be counted.
We are the lot who sometimes can but usually cannot. Now and again I
have been given six marks out of l0, even 6.6 for artistic impression.
But a latest batch turned out like sweet porridge. Same recipe,
identical good ingredients, and equal physical toil led to a sticky
bog-like goo. I needed help. Irvine was where to begin.
Friday's treat is the Heckling House Dinner. It marks the end of the
January season of the Irvine Burns Club. Twenty club directors invite
one guest apiece for a kind of apres-haggis night.
Never in Irvine is Burns far away. There he first tasted town life.
With the local fillettes (he called them) his appetite for sex became
carefree. Aged 23, he also had a day job. He wrote: ''I joined a
flax-dresser to learn his trade. The shop took fire and I was left like
a true poet, not worth sixpence.''
Robert Burns never dwelt on tablet. His work has no line on it. Yet
tablement had already been inscribed in a book.
In 1736 a Mrs McLintock among her Receipts cookery tips included
tablet made with orange peel and three-quarters of a pint of water:
Grate the Oranges, take 2lb of Sugar, and a Mutchkin of Water, then
clarify it with the White of 2 eggs, and set it on a slow Fire, and boil
it till it be almost candyed, then put in the Grate of the Oranges, and
take white Paper, rub it with fresh Butter, pour it on your Paper, and
cut it in little Pieces.
How the Irvine Burnsians 10 years or so ago started to take their
tablets was the idea of the mother-and-daughter catering team of Nan
McCaffer and Jackie Sutherland. Their kitchen is in Kilwinning.
Throughout Ayrshire they do banquets and steak-pie teas. Once a year
they make Kilwinning the tablet capital of the kingdom.
''The idea was to make the dinner Scottish, but everyday Scottish,''
Nan McCaffer said. ''Tablet used to be a wee special treat that even
poor people could afford. It was something grannies made.''
When showed my saccharine sludge, Jackie Sutherland gazed on it
mutely. After a pensive pause she brightened. ''I'll give you nine out
of 10 for colour,'' she conceded.
She suggested it hadn't been boiled enough. Well, it had been boiled
twice, once with condensed milk added. Everthing had been done
religiously as per recipe. And the boiling got beaten afterwards until
the arms felt they were coming off. Perhaps the mood was wrong. It had
been a bad day. The nerves were jangly. Nan McCaffer offered some
comfort. ''You've got to be in a good mood to make tablet,'' she said.
Confidence also comes into it. I treat the boiling mess so gingerly it
might be about to eat me, instead of the other way about.
Behind the recipe instructions is ingredient X. Some natural instinct
is involved. The mystery about boiling is to tell when enough is enough.
Then comes the soft-ball trick. Put a little into cold water, and when
it can be worked adhesively with forefinger and thumb, that's it.
Except there is more to know. In her The Scots Kitchen masterpiece F
Marianne McNeill nearly gives the game away. About the molten mixture
after it has been thoroughly stirred and whacked into submission, she
wrote: ''If too highly grained, it will not pour out flat; if too thin
it will be sticky. Only practice makes perfection.''
Jackie Sutherland produced a vat-sized pot. Talking about something
else, she unwrapped [1/2]lb of butter (''I think you picked the wrong
kind'', she remarked.) She added a carefree amount of sugar, relaxed
measures of milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla. She stirred steadily. She
did the soft-ball trick. She poured. About half an hour was all it took.
''Just take your mind back to when your mother made it,'' she advised.
From Kilwinning I hugged a tray of sweet perfection.
What few squares colleagues failed to scoff sit strangely alongside
the soggy bath mat of my mulligatawny. They are not the same species,
nowhere near it. Please don't say practice will bring them closer. With
tablet, some magical touch makes the difference. Talent tells. It's hard
not to weep.

<HEADLINE>Two fined #1000 over bird of prey snare</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979861737</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Two men were each fined
#1000 yesterday for being in possession of parts of a crude snare
designed to catch birds of prey.
Leslie Massey, 34, and Denis Dowson, 38, both of Wallsend, Tyne and
Wear, were convicted at Dumbarton Sheriff Court of contravening the
Wildlife and Countryside Act.
Another charge under the Act, of intentionally disturbing a peregrine
falcon while in or near its nest containing young, was found not proven.
The maximum fine in each case was #5000.
Sheriff Kevin Breslin was told that bits of the makeshift trap were
found in the boot of a car being used by the pair while they were
visiting Arrochar, Dunbartonshire, last year.
It consisted of a platform of chicken wire with numerous offshoots of
fishing line with nooses at the end.
The device can then be placed near a nest for a bird to tread on
accidentally and be held.
Mr Keith Morton, Scottish Investigator with the RSPB, said that among
the other items found in the vehicle was a duffel-bag with ''airholes''
punched in the side.
He added: ''Inside it were fragments of waxy material found on the
feathers of young birds of prey.''
He added: ''In our experience, nests are robbed for the purpose of
obtaining live birds or eggs for trading on the black market.
''A single bird can fetch as much as #5000 in Germany or the Middle
East where it is perceived that wild birds are better than captive ones
for falconry.''
The court was told that Massey and Dowson were spotted walking on a
hillside near Arrochar where peregrine falcons regularly site their
nests.
Mr Roger Broad, a Glasgow-based conservation officer for the RSPB,
said he visited a nesting area the following day.
He said: ''It was quite clear that someone had been there before me
because the vegetation was trampled down.
''There were no birds in or near the nest.
''But it was also obvious that there had been young in the nest as
recently as one or two days previously.
''I could tell from the freshness of the leftover food and
droppings.''
He added: ''It looked to me as if the nest had been robbed.''

<RECORDNO>979861738</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PARTNER in a firm of surveyors who admitted embezzling #103,000 from
the company was put on probation for two years and ordered to do 240
hours of community service at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
David Brydon, 37, admitted taking the money from Peter Shearer
Surveyors, which has premises in Rutland Street and Blackford Avenue,
Edinburgh, between March 1998 and April 1992.
Depute fiscal Brian Robertson told the court at an earlier hearing
that Brydon had sold his company Porsche and put the #19,000 he was paid
for it back into the firm to cover up for himself.
But as it was a company car the firm kept paying for it until it was
discovered that the vehicle had been sold.
Brydon, of Hainburn Park, Edinburgh, became a partner in the firm in
1988 after the death of its original owner.
He was solely concerned with the accounting side of the business and
took advantage by transferring money from the firm's business and client
accounts into his own.
This involved a total of more than 175 transactions over a four-year
period.
With money since paid back there was still a shortfall of #65,000 and
Mr Robertson said there was no explanation as to where the money had
gone other than on ''high living''.
As well as selling the Porsche, Brydon put #5000 of his own money back
into the firm in an attempt to cover up his activities.
Clients of the firm which lost out included Eastern Scottish (#35,000)
and Pentland Garage (#8600).
Brydon's former partner also had to pay out #5000 of his own money to
settle with clients.
Mr Alex Prentice, for Brydon, told Sheriff Martin Mitchell that
#35,000 had been repaid and that the firm's clients who lost money had
been reimbursed.
All of Brydon's assets had been gathered in to repay as much as
possible.
Mr Prentice said that Brydon had been working as a salesman but had
lost this job when his employer learned of the court case.
He now had little realistic prospect of repaying any more money
although he was still determined to do what he could, he added.

IN the article ''TV special celebrates Auld Alliance'', I noted
particularly that ''among the topics which Ms Wark will tackle will be:
'While the Auld Alliance is celebrated in Scotland, do the French treat
it as a political and cultural phenomenon of any significance?' ''
Last autumn it was Mlle B Madinier, director of the Institut Franais
and of the Alliance Franaise de Glasgow, who approached our society
suggesting that we might combine to hold a series of events to mark this
anniversary. To date the following events have been planned:
Friday, February 24, at Hutchesons' Hall, 158 Ingram street, 7.30pm: a
concert of lute songs from France and Scotland with Robert Phillips,
Scotland's foremost lutist, and Paul Rendall, tenor. Tickets #5 (cons
#3).
Friday, April 7, at the Conference Hall, 7 Bowmont Gardens, Hillhead,
7.30pm: Defile de Mode -- the March of Fashion -- a fashion show with
wine and cheese. Tickets #3. (On both occasions tickets will be
available at the door.)
Further events are being planned.
As it happens, the continuing links between our two countries were
recently strengthened through the twinning of Hamilton with
Chatellerault -- a connection stretching back to Mary, Queen of Scots.
We in the West, therefore, are pleased to be furthering cultural links
by our programme of events.

Chairman of Council, St
Andrew Society of Glasgow,

AN inquiry involving four police forces and taking up thousands of
staff hours was launched after the drugs-related death of a young man at
the Hanger 13 nightclub, a fatal accident inquiry heard yesterday.
The six-week investigation showed that children as young as 13 had
attended the rave event after which Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, from
Rigside, took ill and died from the effects of the drug ecstasy.
Detective Chief Inspector John Corrigan, 37, head of Ayr CID, told the
inquiry that he had taken charge of the investigation after Mr
Stoddart's death on August 21 last year.
Mr Corrigan, speaking on the fifth day of the inquiry into the deaths
of Mr Stoddart and of Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock and Mr Andrew
Dick, 19, from Glasgow, said that officers had taken the names and
addresses of 1230 patrons leaving Hanger 13 in the early hours of August
21.
He added: ''Most of these people were interviewed by police in their
local area and answered a number of stock questions in the form of a
questionnaire.''
The senior policeman said that the procurator-fiscal had taken the
unusual step, with the backing of the Crown Office, of offering an
amnesty to people who had bought or consumed drugs that night.
''I believe this was of enormous help,'' he said. ''Although I am not
convinced that everyone told the whole truth . . . I believe we would
not have gathered the evidence we did without it.''
The inquiry took 10,000 hours of police time and involved assistance
for Strathclyde Police from three other forces as well as the use of the
Holmes investigation computer system.
Mr Corrigan said that 14 people had been reported to the
procurator-fiscal and that there were six cases pending related to drugs
offences.
The age profile of patrons showed that the large majority were 18 or
over but that two were 13 years of age, three were 14 and 31 were 15.
Asked by Mr James Kelman, procurator-fiscal depute, if these figures had
surprised him Mr Corrigan replied: ''It is a fact that people under age
get into licensed premises but the 13 and 14 year olds did surprise me,
yes.''
Sheriff Neil Gow asked Mr Corrigan if he felt the large numbers of
young people attending may have a bearing on the drug dealing which goes
on. He replied: ''We have to ask ourselves why these people feel safe to
deal in drugs. It may be that the sheer size of the crowd helps to hide
them.''
Sheriff Gow: ''It is not exactly Shylock haggling in the market-place.
Deals are done very discreetly.''
Mr Corrigan: ''They know the dealers and know where to find them.''
Mrs Christine Ridah, 48, of Seafield Drive, Ayr, told the court that
she is a director of the company which runs Hanger 13. She said: ''We
were all absolutely devastated and horrified by what happened. Since
August we have carried out a number of changes to the running of the
club and we have further plans for improvements pending the outcome of a
licensing appeal.''
Summing up, Mr Kelman said that the inquiry into the three deaths had
demonstrated a serious drugs problem in and around Ayr which was of
great concern to the public.
He continued: ''I do not feel we can offer a solution to the drug
problem but we must look at ways of preventing a recurrence of such
tragedies . . . it may be that your lordship would wish to press the
Scottish Office to tighten guidelines for the licensing authorities
considering such dance and rave venues.''
Mr Kelman said he hoped the ''extensive and sensitive'' media coverage
of the inquiry would help to get across the message that drugs can kill
and that, in the words of one expert witness: ''Taking ecstasy if like
playing Russian roulette with your life.''
Mr James Reid, solicitor for the club owners, said that despite some
suggestions there was no evidence whatsoever that club staff were
involved in the supply of drugs.
He added: ''I would also submit that there is nothing that the staff
or management could have done which would have prevented these tragic
deaths.''
Mr Jack Drummond, uncle of the late Andrew Stoddart and representing
the family, said: ''A generation of young lives is being destroyed by
ecstasy and the people in authority would be failing in their duties if
they did not make every possible effort to make sure that no such
tragedies ever happen again.''
Sheriff Gow will deliver his judicial determination and make any
recommendations tomorrow.

TRAINING in forestry, agriculture, fishing and small business
management, is now on offer from the Crofters Commission.
This move follows the recent appointment by the Inverness-based
organisation of Arthur MacDonald as its new development officer.
MacDonald has spent all his working life in agriculture; crofting
communities throughout the Highlands and Islands know him best for the
10 years he was training advisor for the Agricultural Training Board.
The first step in wooing crofters into other training and business
areas is by direct mail.
Two thousand brochures have now been mailed to crofting communities,
and a number of replies are being answered.
This outlines the Crofting Township Development Scheme and highlights
training measures to help improve business management and efficiency,
especially on the agricultural and forestry side.
On the agricultural front, courses are offered in book-keeping, animal
health, and practical help for agricultural skills.
As the average age of a crofter is higher than in other jobs,
MacDonald needs to work hard to bring new training and skills to the
Highlands and Islands.
However, he says: ''We are still only feeling our way at this stage.
''We will be trying to encourage people to do anything that is
beneficial to their community.
''Historically, training isn't something that crofters see for
themselves. It is difficult to see a skills gap in yourself, you tend to
have a go first.
''I will be trying to broaden most schemes out. Most people will be
able to pinpoint one thing that they want to do.
''However, the Township scheme requires that they have to operate in
two sectors, and it is when they are pushed into something slightly
different that you come into an area of skills gaps.
''We are aiming to get them into training.''
On this front, the Highlands and Islands have help from the Rural
Training Services, although the first point of contact is still the
local Enterprise company.
However, any group or township wanting to get involved in the new
options should contact MacDonald first.
He feels that his contacts are good, following his years working for
the Agricultural Training Board, and plans to expand into the local
enterprise network.
Expansion is also moving into the area of communications.
There are plans for communities to have one building to maintain
regular contact with agricultural organisations, the Crofters Commission
and the LECs, perhaps through a local computer network.
MacDonald stresses that a move in this direction would be centred
around training. ''I see quite a lot of situations where technology is
made available or the capital to purchase it, and then there is nobody
to use it,'' he adds.
MacDonald is also taking training in this section to use Internet, an
international computer networking system that is to be part of the job.
''This idea of trying to get crofters better linked to organisations
they use often is important; it could also be used on the tourist side
to check future bookings, but this will all depend on how townships will
be able to use the systems.
''Training also plays a strong part in the use of dips or 'anything
that tampers with the environment both on the building and forestry
front','' stresses MacDonald.
Although much of the inspection and advice is run through Forestry
Enterprise and the Scottish Agricultural College, the Township scheme
will be a major player to help with form filling and advice.
''My role is to encourage crofters to look at wider developments than
they would traditionally do, particularly the crofter forestry
programme.
''Here, alongside training, there will be advice on species selection,
site, and management; it is the management of woods that will be the
strongest training point,'' said MacDonald.
For the future there is also now the idea of a training group network,
with each locality represented by its own co-ordinator making the
arrangements for an instructor or tutor to be brought in.
MacDonald added: ''It is worthwhile to explore this. It could be that
we are looking at funding someone from each large community to go and
make connections and become a focus for training in that area.''

<HEADLINE>Major in bid to win over Ulster Unionists</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister yesterday mounted a new drive to patch up relations
with Ulster Unionist leaders and win their support for UK-Irish
proposals for all-party talks on Northern Ireland's political future.
Mr Major plans to meet both the Democratic Unionist Party and the
Ulster Unionists, as well as the Alliance Party in the coming week.
He will urge them to adopt a positive response to the framework
document being hammered out between London and Dublin.
The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and the Irish
Foreign Minister, Mr Dick Spring, will meet in Belfast today for what
could be a crunch session as the two Governments work to resolve
outstanding differences.
Both sides hope the document, which will set out the framework for
all-party talks, can be published before the end of the month.
Before then, Mr Major wants to have private talks with the Unionists
to repair bridges broken in the past fortnight since publication of a
leaked draft of the document.
The Unionists have warned that if certain sensitive leaked details are
in the final draft, they will withdraw support for the Government which
has proved vital to Mr Major on a number of key Commons votes in the
past year.
He is expected to meet a three-man delegation from the UUP at Downing
Street tomorrow.
The UUP leader, Mr James Molyneaux, will stay away, but Mr William
Ross, the party's Chief Whip at Westminster, Mr David Trimble, and the
Rev Martin Smyth will attend.
The DUP leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, is due to meet Mr Major early
next week, their first face-to-face confrontation since the Prime
Minister threw Mr Paisley out of No 10 during a row last year.
Dowing Street said the round of meetings were ''part of the process of
keeping the main constitutional parties abreast of developments''.
But any developments will revolve around what Sir Patrick and Mr
Spring can agree in Belfast today.
Sir Patrick Mayhew said last night that punishment beatings were
barbaric and must be ended.
Speaking after the injury of nine people in three attacks on Sunday
night, Sir Patrick said the activities of so-called paramilitary
punishment squads were repulsive.
They were a ''flagrant violation of the right to live free from fear
of violence'', he said.
Seven people were injured when a hooded gang of men attacked a house
outside Londonderry last night and laid into the occupants with baseball
bats and clubs in the front garden.
The attackers fled when police happened on the scene. Six were
arrested later and two more yesterday.

Scotland will need to undergo a cultural revolution in attitudes
towards education and training by the year 2000 if its economy is to
flourish, according to Stephanie Young, the newly appointed director of
the Advisory Scottish Council for Education and Training Targets
(Ascett), in a consultation document entitled World Class Scotland.
It is to be sent to 800 organisations throughout Scotland to seek
their opinions on how to achieve such a revolution.
Ascett has set the following targets for the end of the century which
it urges educational institutes and business to adopt: -- 85% of young
people to attain five Standard Grades or equivalent; 70% of young people
to attain three Highers or equivalent; 60% of the workforce to have at
least three Highers or equivalent; and 50% of organisations to be
committed to Investors In People -- the Government's scheme to encourage
companies to increase the skills of their workers.
Ascett is an independent body which was established by the Secretary
of State for Scotland in 1993.
The targets were chosen after a consultation period which covered 100
events and 6000 people.

I READ with interest your articles on Emily's List and women in the
Scottish Labour Party (February 6).
I am a supporter of getting more women into Parliament. However, the
parliamentary system would have to change dramatically to become more
''family friendly''. The hours that MPs are expected to work do not
contribute to healthy family life. The problems of being a Scots MP are
further compounded by the distance that he/she has to travel.
From what I have seen about Emily's List I would tend to agree with
your reporter that it appears to promote a certain class of women in
''New Labour''. It also only supports women who are pro-choice on the
abortion issue and does not entertain applications from pro-life women
in the Labour Party.
This characteristic failed to come out in the article and I feel it is
a major stumbling block to its promotion of women in polics.

ALLAN MORRIS is right to complain of the lack of interest shown by BBC
TV Scotland and Scottish Television in Celtic Connections, but wrong to
assume that it would be different for other kinds of music, particularly
jazz (February 13).
Since the Glasgow International Jazz Festival started in 1987, artists
it has presented whom the television companies have felt able to ignore
have included Sarah Vaughan, Oscar Peterson, Miles Davis (one of his
last concerts), Dizzy Gillespie, Tony Bennett, Benny Carter, Max Roach,
Tommy Smith, Carol Kidd, and literally hundreds more.
By contrast, the Brecon Jazz Festival, probably Glasgow's nearest
rival, has all its major concerts recorded by BBC Wales for presentation
on the network. Most of the major European jazz festivals have similar
arrangements with their local broadcasters.
In the light of this, the excuses which the Scottish broadcasters
invariably offer (mostly variations on ''there's no call for it'') are
pretty pathetic. If coverage of these important concerts is as difficult
to justify as they say, how come everyone else manages to do it?
I support Mr Morris's hope that the Scottish broadcasters have now
seen the error of their ways over Celtic Connections. But don't hold
your breath.

WILLIAM RUSSELL appears to propagate the line that passive smoking is
no more than a mildly unpleasant inconvenience for non-smokers and that
current attitudes to smokers are rather worrying (January 30).
As an asthmatic for many years let me assure him that even the
briefest exposure to tobacco smoke (even second-hand, so-called passive
smoke) makes me physically ill and more prolonged exposure can make me
very ill.
During the decades when smoking was more prevalent I was virtually
excluded from large parts of society and leisure activities by the
presence of smokers discharging their noxious contaminants.
Even now I can seldom visit a pub because of the scarcely breathable
atmosphere.
If today's smokers feel that they are being treated like lepers (who
could not help their condition and did not deserve such treatment) they
at least have a remedy to hand. They can give up smoking. I had no
remedy available.

THE latest factory gate prices suggesting renewed inflationary
pressure in the economy were only partly anticipated by analysts and so
had a worse than expected effect on stock market sentiment yesterday.
Some of the bad news was identifiable in advance from two sources.
First, the December mini-Budget, forced upon the Chancellor to replace
the revenues lost with the defeat of the proposal to raise VAT on
domestic fuel to 17[1/2]%, involved extra duties on petrol, drink, and
tobacco. Secondly, most manufacturers tend to review their prices on
January 1 each year, and such reviews were expected to recommend
increases since demand has been so restrained for such a long time that
manufacturers have been desperate to widen their profit margins. They
may have been encouraged to do so by good Christmas retail reports
(though not all retailers experienced these).
The actual outcome was worse than such calculations indicated and will
appear to have vindicated the pessimism of the Governor of the Bank of
England, and so the three successive increases in base rates since last
September. It may also confirm the fear that further rate increases must
be in the offing even if there is every possibility that these could be
postponed until May. Waiting should give the monetary authorities time
to see just how far the earlier increases have affected prices, but time
will also show whether the attempt to widen profit margins has
succeeded. Previous attempts to do this have been abortive for retailers
have found it impossible to sustain higher prices in the face of the
ferocious competition prevalent in all retail sectors and just
underlined by the latest instalment of the supermarket wars in Tesco's
proposed new loyalty card for customers. Those retailers who proclaim
their intention to eschew sales and stick to their existing price scales
are certainly brave.
Raw material costs have been moving upwards strongly but their
inflationary impact has been reduced by productivity gains which have
also managed to offset earnings growth a little ahead of inflation. Fast
falling unemployment could easily alter that picture: though we are
still far from labour shortages as such, skill shortages could soon be
another matter. These influences are familiar enough, and not the same
as those mentioned by Mr Brown, the Shadow Chancellor, yesterday, when
he said that the culprits for our present difficulties included low
manufacturing investment and capacity constraints on output.
Manufacturing investment may actually be picking up a little, but there
is little doubt that it has been very slow to grow. Corporate treasurers
have been reluctant to accept the reality (or long-time continuance) of
low inflation and have been postponing investment projects because the
likely returns have often been far too low compared with the assumptions
of the inflationary era. Obviously quite sophisticated planners can be
trapped in inflationary expectations as easily as home buyers. A
long-term weakness in British manufacturing -- our unwillingness to
invest heavily in it -- certainly exists and will work to our
disadvantage if the recovery continues so that domestic demand
eventually boosts the already strong export demand.
It is less certain that we are up against capacity constraints in
production at this stage. Not only is domestic demand not strong enough
(hence the conflicting evidence from retailers) but we have not started
to suck in imported consumer goods on the scale which many believed
would have been a feature of this stage of the recovery. In this respect
the well-known popular uncertainty (over job security and mortgage
rates, for example) has simply dampened down the enthusiasm of spenders,
and certainly of private borrowers. Mr Brown is ahead of the game, but
maybe not too much. It would be a great pity if such a strong export-led
movement, as we have been experiencing, is halted by an inability to
produce enough of the goods required. That at least can be remedied,
though the worry is that new plant and capacity might just be ready to
meet a cyclical downturn.

ONE of the things wrong with this country is that people sit around

A case in point is our fishermen. They have been moaning about the

Yet only last week there were reports of a huge whale in the River
Clyde.
There is good eating on a whale, as those who can remember the days

Why has no-one been enterprising enough to go out and catch the

A SPORTS producer yesterday received his #11,000 compensation from
Scottish Television for unfair dismissal after sending on sheriff
officers when he decided the company was running out of extra time.
The TV station, however, insisted the cheque was already off before
the officers' involvement.
Mr Ron Marshall was made redundant from his #40,000-a-year job as
sports editor at Scottish Television in December 1993. An industrial
tribunal later ruled he had been unfairly dismissed and ordered the
company to pay him compensation.
According to Mr Marshall, the deadline for paying him the money was
December 13, 1994. He says neither the money nor an explanation for its
non-payment was forthcoming, so two sheriff officers were sent to the
studios yesterday morning with an enforceable order requiring payment of
the sum, plus interest, within two weeks.
Mr Marshall said later: ''At about the same time as the officers went
there -- I don't know which happened first -- a hand-delivered cheque,
with the interest properly calculated, arrived at my lawyer's office.''
In a statement issued yesterday, Scottish Television said: ''We are
very surprised at the action taken by Mr Marshall and his solicitors
since, while they are entitled to do this, it is not normal practice.
''All they had to do was make a simple telephone call instead of
setting up what can only be described as a cheap publicity stunt.''
A spokesman said the cheque had been delivered before the sheriff
officers arrived.
Asked why the company had waited until yesterday to deliver the
cheque, he said: ''It was just an oversight, as far as I can gather.
There was no reason other than that.''
Mr Marshall said: ''That is the kind of response I would expect from
Scottish Television. There was no onus on me to lift a telephone.''
He added: ''It has taken longer than it should have, but I am pleased
the whole thing is over.''
His solicitor, Mr Bill Speirs, of Tindal Oatts, said: ''Scottish
Television had a legal obligation to pay this debt and had not done so.
Mr Marshall took the steps he was legally entitled to take.''
Mr Speirs could not say whether the cheque had reached his office
before the sheriff officers arrived at the studios.
He did not wish to comment on the company's explanation that an
oversight had caused the delay in payment.
Mr Marshall, 54, from Milngavie, near Glasgow, was made redundant as a
result of Scottish Television's decision to merge the sports department
with news and current affairs.
The industrial tribunal, held in August last year, was told he had
learned during a lunch with his opposite number at the BBC that he was
to lose his job.
Mr Marshall is now working as a freelance in sports journalism and TV
production.

The object of attending or participating in a Burns supper is to

Murray Ritchie, European Editor, reports that predictions of a flood
of immigrants through the Euro back door have been met with polite
puzzlement among Eurocrats
MR CHARLES WARDLE'S apocalyptic vision of 15,000,000 illegal
immigrants flooding into Britain because ''Brussels'' is dictating
domestic immigration policy provoked a degree of mystification in the EU
yesterday.
But Eurocrats, long accustomed to the eccentricities of the European
debate in Britain, were constrained in giving formal reaction lest they
be accused of interfering in the domestic affairs of a member state.
But privately they seemed to agree with the view of the Prime Minister
that Mr Wardle's vision was, to put it politely, blurred.
Mr Wardle's main point is that the so-called ''opt-out'' from the
single market legislation is not sufficient to protect Britain from
millions of illegal immigrants swarming into the country through the
Euro back door.
In the first place, there is no such opt-out. There is merely a
written declaration. What Margaret Thatcher did at the Luxembourg
inter-governmental conference of 1985, which gave birth to the single
market, was to have the declaration written into the formal conclusions.
This text was later annexed to the Single European Act which in turn
amended the Treaty of Rome. This has, wrongly, been referred to as a
British opt-out but is, in fact, merely a codicil applicable to all EU
governments. It states: ''Nothing in these provisions shall affect the
right of the member states to take such measures as they consider
necessary for the purpose of controlling immigration from third
countries and to combat terrorism, crime, the traffic in drugs and
illicit trading in works of art and antiques.''
This does not deflect the general thrust of the Treaty of Rome, as
amended by Maastricht, towards the removal of internal frontiers. The
treaty states: ''The internal market shall comprise an area without
internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons,
services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of
this treaty.''
Margaret Thatcher returned from Luxembourg satisfied she had protected
Britain from the Wardlesque nightmare. Indeed, in her memoirs she says
she would not have signed the single Act if this safeguard had not been
included. But later, it seems, she doubted whether the declaration was
binding. It is this doubt which has so worried Mr Wardle -- though it
causes little concern inside the European Commission or among other
member states. Plainly, it is one for the lawyers.
Meanwhile, the commission is preparing a directive to be discussed in
the Council of Ministers when the time comes for the EU finally to put
the spirit of the Act into operation. It is at this point that the
Eurosceptics could have some fun.
Before then, two hurdles have to be cleared. First, a case before the
European Court of Justice has to be resolved. This involves the European
Parliament, fed up with endless delays in the removal of frontiers,
suing the European Commission for not pushing the cause fast enough. A
decision could be out later this year.
Second, the so-called Schengen states in the EU -- those without
external frontiers who signed a deal in the Luxembourg town of that name
-- are pressing ahead with the removal of internal controls. This should
happen next month or April.
But the corollary is that safeguards against illegal third-country
immigration will be strengthened along the EU's more important external
borders. Commission officials believe this will more than compensate for
the removal of internal borders and calm Mr Wardle's fears. In other
words, people travelling inside the EU have more freedom to move -- as
between states in the US -- but gaining entry to the EU in the first
place will be more difficult at the external border.
This should have been expected to please Mr Wardle instead of
provoking him to resign. Hence the puzzlement not just in Brussels but
in Downing Street.
Mr Wardle does have a weapon on his side, although he might have
overlooked it in his confusion. When the EU member states meet formally
to discuss the commission's proposed directive they must reach their
decision unanimously. This means that any state can wield a veto. If Mr
Major (or Mr Blair?) is so minded he need only say: ''No.'' The rest of
the EU could do nothing.
If the time comes when the British Government feels the need -- which
it probably won't -- to veto a directive governing more freedom of
movement, it is possible that another course of action could be found to
bring Britain into line. This would be a last resort.
Since there can be no cause for challenging the use of a veto in the
Court of Justice, those who believe the British would be behaving
unreasonably could support an individual petition to one of the European
courts alleging that his or her freedom of movement had been unfairly
impeded. Given the British record of losing to the Court of Justice in
Luxembourg and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the outcome
could change history.
But we are nowhere near that yet. While we await events perhaps Mr
Wardle might like to explain his conviction that the aforesaid
15,000,000 immigrants would choose Britain to live in illegally when so
many other EU member states have much more generous social security
benefits available, not to mention better weather. Just a thought.

TREASURY Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken, the Cabinet Minister in
charge of Government spending, warned Tory lawyers last night that legal
aid expense had to be reduced.
Mr Aitken was supporting a drive by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay,
to cut down legal expenses.
Mr Aitken described the present situation as failing lawyers and their
clients. ''Neither the providers of the service nor the ostensible
clients have any significant interest in efficiency or economy in
delivery.''
Mr Aitken inserted a key controversial element into his speech last
night to the Society of Conservative Lawyers by advocating the
encouragement of private insurance to cover legal costs.
He said: ''I was much struck by the international comparisons on the
legal expenses insurance market which pointed out that premium income in
this field of insurance was, in 1991/92, #1250m in Germany, #400m in
France, and only #70m in the UK. These figures suggest that legal
insurance is a neglected area in this country and I would welcome the
extension of existing private insurance schemes.''
Mr Aitken appeared to be advocating that legal aid had to be cut from
#1400m in the current year. He wants individuals to take out insurance
to enable them to meet the costs of litigation, rather than the state.
He claims the massive cost increases of litigation are by no means all
due to the increase in the number of people receiving help under the
legal aid scheme. ''A huge share of this rise is due to the large
increases in the cost per case.''
Mr Aitken's controversial speech last night follows another one by his
predecessor at the Treasury in charge of public expenditure, Mr Stephen
Dorrell, who over the last fortnight has been advocating that people
should cease to look on their homes as an investment and go to
stockbrokers instead.
Mr Dorrell's line of argument as a former Treasurer Chief Secretary
has raised eyebrows in the Government, being viewed as realistic but
politically embarrassing. Mr Aitken's speech to the Tory lawyers last
night suggesting that individuals should take out insurance instead of
relying on legal aid produces further controversy for the Prime
Minister.

LABOUR MPs yesterday lined up to attack the housing agency, Scottish
Homes, as an unelected quango which abuses its power and denied its
tenants freedom of choice.
Leading the assault, housing spokesman John McAllion accused Scottish
Homes of ''dirty tricks'' over the involvement of staff members in
so-called tenants' bids to take over ownership of the agency's housing
stock.
The MP urged Scottish Housing Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton to
investigate allegations that Scottish Homes's time and money was being
spent on pushing certain local bids to acquire the housing.
Mr McAllion told the Scottish Grand Committee meeting in Edinburgh of
claims that Scottish Homes staff were actively promoting bids to buy
agency housing stock in which they themselves were involved.
They did this by by passing traditional tenants groups and setting up
''bogus'' ones which gave the appearance of being tenant-led but in fact
were led by agency staff.
''There are even allegations of a dirty tricks campaign against those
tenants who stand up and oppose what is going on,'' he said.
Mr McAllion said he did not necessarily blame the staff who were
caught between a rock and a hard place.
New landlords who acquired the housing stock did not have to employ
them and Scottish Homes was also on record as wanting to reduce staff
numbers.
''The only thing they know is to fight for their jobs by trying to set
up those so-called tenants-led bodies,'' he told the committee.
The Labour spokesman attacked the Government and Scottish Homes for
not allowing tenants proper freedom of choice over their future landord.
They were obsessed with forcing people out of the public sector.
The tenants' fate was being decided by the Minister who was the second
son of a duke ''whose head seemed permanently in the clouds'', he
claimed, and by Scottish Homes chairman Sir James Mellon, a life-long
diplomat.
Later, Scottish Homes's chief executive, Mr Peter McKinlay, who
watched the debate, said he was mystified by Labour's claims of bogus
landlords. With only two exceptions, bids for the housing stock had come
from registered associations or co-operatives.
He agreed there were joint initiatives between local staff and tenants
but insisted they received no more help from Scottish Homes than other
groups such as council tenants who wanted to buy their homes and manage
them.
Mr McKinlay also said time spent by staff on local bids was monitored
and the cost could be recouped if a sale was made.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said the aim of Scottish Homes was to
improve the quality and variety of housing options available.
It had inherited some 75,000 houses from the Scottish Special Housing
Association in 1989 but had always envisaged its formation would provide
an opportunity for creating new landords.
Some 23 ballots had been held involving nearly 13,000 tenants and the
results had shown that on average some 62% favoured transfers to
alternative landlords.
''I think there is ample evidence if any is needed that tenants are
fully aware of the advantages of moving to alternative landlords,'' he
said.
Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Archy Kirkwood accused Scottish Homes of
doing the Government's dirty work over stock transfers and said the
agency should be accountable to a Scottish parliament.
SNP MP Andrew Welsh said it was yet another unelected and
unaccountable quango. Stock transfers were taking place with minimum
tenant involvement yet involving Scottish Homes staff as main
instigators.
Tenants from the Freedom of Choice campaign, who lobbied MPs going in
to the debate, brought along a Valentine card for Lord James.
It repeated their call for district councils to be included on the
ballot papers and attacked Scottish Homes for restricting choice in the
ballots to just one alternative landlord.
Campaign Secretary Mary Reid said the fight would go on with a protest
by tenants at Westminster next month.

The Spanish Armada was defeated in 1588. The United Kingdom did not

STEWART LAMONT's column on UFOs appeared at the same time as the
current issue of Nature featured articles about the probability of other
life in the universe (February 11).
In one article it was estimated that there are about a billion
''genuinely habitable worlds'' in our galaxy alone. Although I am very
sceptical about UFOs and not at all convinced that any of the sightings
are of visitors from space, I think it very probable that there is life
on other planets circling other suns in our own and other galaxies.
Indeed, it would be very odd if, in such a vast universe with its
estimated 100 billion galaxies, ours was the only planet on which life
had appeared.
However, the distances to even the nearest of those possibly inhabited
worlds are so great that we may never be able to reach them, nor they
us. But it is possible, even likely, that one day -- not perhaps in our
own lifetime -- we shall pick up encyclopaedic information beamed in our
direction about the history and culture of other remote civilisations.
Our astronomers are already listening.
Perhaps theologians should be thinking about the implications of all
this. Our great religions were established when it was assumed that the
earth was at the centre of the universe and that the creator was
involved in shaping our unique destiny.
Stewart Lamont raised the subject of UFOs. Perhaps he would like to
speculate on the implications for theology of there being so many other
worlds from which they might have come.

YOUR editorial comments on organs (Dying king of instruments, February
6) justly express sorrow at the diminishing numbers of skilled organ
builders, and you speak of having to make pilgrimages to Manchester and
Atlantic City to hear the Mighty Wurlitzers etc.
However, it may be worth mentioning that small bands of devotees all
over the country still labour away to preserve the old theatre organs,
and from Glasgow there is no need to travel as far as Manchester to see
one -- there is an equally spectacular Wurlitzer in East Kilbride's
Civic Centre (superior to the Granada Studios one, in my opinion) and
also a very fine Compton in Summerlee Heritage Trust Museum at
Coatbridge, both restored by members of our club.
Every month there are concerts on these two organs by internationally
famous players.
Some of our members, incidentally, possess two fine Wurlitzer organs
which are looking for new homes -- a theatre, a pub, a pizza parlour, a
leisure complex, a department store, or whatever. Any takers?
Do not despair of organ builders yet: our club team is still working
away, and anyone who might be interested in learning something of the
ancient craft would be very welcome to join us.

JOHN DOUGLAS, who is so angry about the European Union (Common Market
to him), is mistaken in nearly all the facts which underpin his anger
(February 3).
The recently reported case of UK citizens the European Commission on
Human Rights believes were falsely imprisoned for non-payment of poll
tax has nothing to do with the European Union.
The European Convention on Human Rights was made through the Council
of Europe (inaugurated at St James's Palace, London, on May 5, 1949) by
European Governments led by Britain, determined to create institutions
which could act to protect all the peoples of Europe against a
recurrence of the kind of tyranny which had just been defeated.
Fifty years after the liberation of Belsen by the British Army, does
Mr Douglas really want us to turn our backs on the European Convention
for Human Rights? A lot more is at stake than whether English
magistrates can send poll tax debtors to prison without a fair trial.

I should point out that Ryden, one of the leading firms of surveyors
in Scotland, has offices in the three key cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh,
and Aberdeen. We occupy a leading position in each of these three cities
from which we serve the whole of Scotland.
Proudly we remain independent, but we cannot be accused of being

Marine accident experts have launched an investigation after a
fisherman was crushed to death by trawler netting gear which had broken
free.
Mr Calum Macauley, 25, a bachelor from Fraserburgh, was taken by Navy
helicopter to Derriford Hospital, Ply-mouth, on Saturday but was
pronounced dead on arrival.
Police confirmed he had suffered severe leg and abdominal injuries.
Two other crew members on the eight-man Conquest were slightly injured
in the accident at 1.30am on Saturday, 25 miles off Start Point, between
Plymouth and Torquay.
Both men were allowed away after hospital treatment.
A full investigation is to be carried out by the Department of
Transport's Marine Accident Bureau.
Mr Andy Kimber, of Brixham coastguard, said: ''We understand that a
net drum bearing was sheared, causing it to break free and hit three
crew members.''
Coastguards said rough weather may have been a factor in the accident.
The crew members travelled back to Scotland by coach. However, the
trawler will stay in Brixham until the investigation is complete.
Before returning home, the crew were given counselling by Brixham's
Royal Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen, along with the crew of their
partner vessel, Green Pastures, who were present at the accident.
Mr Paul Jarrett, at the mission, said: ''They are all very very
shocked. They are a close-knit crew from a very close-knit community and
they are devastated about what happened.''

THE truth about crime in society, its significance, frequency, and
rate of increase or otherwise is a source of constant debate generally
unrelieved by statistics which can command confidence. For the ordinary
citizen crime comes in two forms. The first is concrete and consists of
personal evidence or experience. The second is much more nebulous and
consists essentially of the citizen's perception of crime. In recent
years those who perceive crime of all sorts to be on the increase have
vastly outnumbered those who actually suffer from it. Nevertheless their
opinion is of the greatest importance to the authorities and the
political parties who have their own perception of crime as an election
issue.
A year ago some 92% of those consulted in a Government survey thought
that crime should be classed as a serious problem in modern Britain. It
is unlikely that this figure would be in any way altered this morning
and the latest figures on crime in Scotland issued by the Scottish
Office do little to encourage complacency. As with all statistics it is
quite possible to stand on your head, read them in a mirror, and be
quite content with the result. This may not be the exact tactic used in
the Scottish Office, but officials and Ministers appeared quite
satisfied yesterday. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie was happy with the overall
fall of 3% in recorded crime. He described it as good news and gave some
credit to the system of targeting known criminals and to property owners
for appearing to look after their buildings more carefully. This may be
good news as far as it goes, but it does not necessarily go very far.
The targeting of known criminals is an expensive way of policing and
must be placed against a background of chief constables complaining
about a shortage of financial resources. Targeting is a successful
tactic, but it only works if it is maintained and this might be
financially difficult in the long term.
More serious is the news that crimes of violence, which constitute the
core of people's perceptions of crime, have risen along with
fire-raising, vandalism, and car offences. Drug possession offences are
also forecast to rise when figures are given later this year and
although police clear-up rates have improved it is regrettable that two
out of three crimes are not resolved. The rise in violent crime in
Scotland makes the overall drop through housebreaking, shoplifting, and
fraud look hollow. There must be more energetic efforts made to identify
the causes of violent crime and to deal with the poor police clear-up
rate, particularly in Strathclyde. These problems must be addressed
urgently, otherwise public perception of crime will become reality.

COMMITTAL proceedings against the alleged mass murderer, Mrs Rosemary
West, will end today.
The Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, Mr Peter Badge, has
completed hearing the prosecution and defence arguments during a six-day
session at the magistrates' court in the small Gloucester town of
Dursley.
Today, he will rule on whether there is a case for 41-year-old Mrs
West to answer on charges that she murdered 10 people, including her
16-year-old daughter, Heather, and stepdaughter Charmaine, between 1970
and 1987.
After yesterday's hearing Mrs West was driven under police escort in a
van with darkened windows back to Pucklechurch remand centre near
Bristol, where she is being held.
Mrs West, of 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, is accused of murdering
nine young women, aged between 15 and 21, whose remains were found at
her home and garden last year.
She is also charged with murdering eight-year-old Charmaine, whose
remains were uncovered at her previous home in Midland Road, Gloucester.
Mrs West further faces two separate rape charges. Committal
proceedings on the rape charges will follow the hearing on the murder
charges.

Elizabeth
Buie reports how high street stores which adopt a policy of regular
price cuts have created an atmosphere of sales cynicism among shoppers
SHOPPERS for clothes have stopped trusting stores that offer an
endless stream of price cutting and have turned instead to slightly more
expensive, quality lines that they believe in, according to a report
produced yesterday.
Credibility has become a far greater issue than ever before, as
consumers shopping in stores that continuously discount lines feel they
can no longer believe the price they see before them.
As retailers have found that they must become more efficient to
survive, their policy of trying to tempt shoppers through their doors by
cutting prices has apparently backfired.
Consumers are now adopting the attitude that if the shops can afford
to slash prices, the goods were over-priced in the first place.
Retail analysts at Verdict Research are now warning that endless
price-cutting could actually harm trade in the clothing market. And they
also warn that as quality and design are cherished more by consumers,
prices may creep up.
''The proportion of goods at #19.99 are going to be higher than the
#17.99s,'' predicts Ms Hilary Monk, author of Verdict Research's report.
''Retailers are trying to move towards 'everyday low prices'. They
have realised they have to reassure consumers that every time they go
into a store, they are going to get the best possible prices, instead of
leaving the customer thinking 'If I buy this now, it will have 20% or
30% off next week','' she adds.
Clearly, the policy of continuous discounting has proved bad for
customer morale and the customer's perception of the retailer.
''The recession-hit consumer has come to distrust mainstream retailers
that discount on an ongoing basis. The most conspicuous example of this
is The Burton Group. The company's specialist chains locked themselves
into an endless stream of price-cutting that was difficult for the
business to extricate itself from. The group's fashion multiples have
seen their market share fall from 6.2% in 1992 to 5.6% today,'' said a
spokesman for Verdict Research yesterday.
The Burton Group's own report and accounts confirm that discounting
has not been a successful strategy and that plans are now in place to
adopt a more realistic pricing policy to attract more customer
confidence.
Mr Sean Eddie, a retail analyst with Natwest Securities, sees the
Burton Group as a ''classic case'' of being forced to move away from its
dependence on continuous discounting.
''The problem is weaning the customer off the sale treadmill, and just
recently the group has been showing signs of achieving that. But they
are still perceived by the consumer as offering sufficiently low quality
out of sufficiently unsatisfactory outlets. The consumer is never
compelled to pay full price and has become inured to sales scenarios,''
he said.
The success story of the retail clothing industry is, say analysts,
Marks and Spencer.
''In the autumn and winter of 1992, Marks &amp; Spencer responded to
stagnating sales by adopting Outstanding Value, which meant sharper
initial pricing,'' said Mr Eddie.
Marks and Spencer already had a loyal consumer base and has never
resorted to slashing prices across the board. As one analyst put it:
''You would be lucky to save the price of your bus ticket at some M&amp;S
sales.''
Ms Monk said: ''The way in which Marks and Spencer put across its
message to the customer was very subtle -- it was done so that the
consumer did not feel there was an image of Marks' discounting, but that
it had just enhanced the value that much more.''
She feels that other stores are beginning to follow its example,
putting more emphasis on quality and design. She picks out retailers
Next and River Island along with Marks &amp; Spencer as offering distinctive
merchandise and the right balance between price and product quality.
But some other retailers, such as Oasis, Monsoon, and Hobbs are also
achieving success. Perhaps their designs are perceived as ''hot'' at
this particular time. Perhaps also there is a swing towards
better-designed and more imaginative clothing after what has been seen
as a relatively boring period in the retail clothing trade. Basic
women's items such as leggings, baggy jumpers and polo-necks are still
the premise of stores such as Marks &amp; Spencer, whose own image for
women's and men's fashions has improved radically.
Referring to chains such as Oasis and Monsoon, Ms Monk says: ''It's
the right product and what the market wants at the moment. It's
something a little bit different and there is a bit more design input.
The prices are higher, but there is a demand for it.''
Mr Eddie says: ''There has always been in fashion an ability for niche
retailers to make money through being perceived as fashionable at that
particular time. You just have to look at Covent Garden and the trendier
parts of Glasgow to see that. But I am not sure if in general, without a
sufficiently fashionably strong product, you can get away with it.''
Etam has failed in its attempts to move its brand slightly upmarket,
providing a warning to others that the middle market in fashion remains
incredibly competitive, he says.
But if retailers face tough times, with virtually no elasticity in the
market, and, as some analysts believe, higher underlying inflation than
Government statistics indicate, the news for the consumer is good.
''Consumers are getting a better deal. Retailers in the 1990s are
focused on giving the consumer greater value, whereas in the 1980s it
was all about 'value', which essentially meant charging bigger prices in
order to enhance the feel and the style of their shops and formats.
''Nowadays, most consumers are much more discerning and
price-sensitive, and much more cynical about the extent to which new
formats are necessarily value,'' said Mr Eddie.
Labour's spokesman for consumer affairs, Mr Nigel Griffiths, predicts
that the days of bogus sales claims are now coming to an end.
''People are now thinking twice before they buy just about anything,''
said Mr Griffiths.

To force Hobson's choice on the tenants of Scottish Homes means that
democracy
is no longer in the running, believes Maggie Vaughan
THERE was once a horsekeeper in Cambridge who would let out the cuddy
nearest the stable door, or none at all. His name was Hobson.
It is his imperfect understanding of the concept of choice that some
tenants of Scottish Homes complain is being foisted upon them. That is
to say, none at all really.
Yesterday, tenants whose definition of choice extends beyond a yes or
no interlude with a ballot paper stood outside the temporary home of the
Scottish Grand Committee sitting in Edinburgh to protest for the right
to choose a preferred landlord for their permanent homes.
Scottish Homes, the national housing agency, is divesting itself of
its landlord role, getting rid of its remaining stock of around 50,000
houses before the turn of the century. There has never been any secret
about its intention. When Malcolm Rifkind, then Scottish Secretary,
guided the legislation that established Scottish Homes as Scotland's
premier quango through Parliament in 1988, he indicated clearly that
this would be a major plank of its agenda.
It was to help harness private finance for housing in Scotland, give
new scope for diversifying tenure and ownership, and offer tenants a
direct stake in the management of their homes.
The key phrase was that it was to take over ''on a transitional
basis'' 85,000 houses from the public sector Scottish Special Housing
Association, as well as taking on the mantle of the old Housing
Corporation in supervising housing associations.
It was in so many words an essentially political creation. The aim was
to end the heavy reliance on public funds by bringing more private money
into the Scottish housing market.
The shift was to be away from the dominance of public housing,
supposedly towards the creation of more diverse options such as housing
associations and co-operatives. Scottish Homes was to be an enabling and
funding body, and was to help a wide range of landlords bridge the gap
between costs and income.
But the tenants claim that far from offering diversity, Scottish Homes
has adopted a high-handed and domineering manner, fobbing them off with
a rigged choice of landlord and stacking the deck to achieve the result
it wants in ridding itself of its housing stock.
What galls the tenants most is that they are refused the option of
remaining in the public sector by transferring their tenancies to local
authorities. This they say robs them of freedom of choice.
The agency is accused by some tenants of creating a climate of fear
and apprehension about what may happen if tenants fail to vote to
transfer to the landlord offered in a ballot.
The tenants complain that when a ballot does take place, only one name
appears on the ballot paper. They can vote yes or no. A no vote leaves
them as tenants of Scottish Homes, a landlord with the avowed intent of
ridding itself of their homes. That, to put it lightly, leaves them with
an uncertain future. And, they say, it militates towards a yes vote.
The agency counters by saying its aim of improving the quality and
variety of options available in Scottish housing does not include the
right to remain in public housing: except in exceptional circumstances.
These include cases where there is a tiny number of houses involved, in
isolated areas where no other landlords are interested, or where the
local council is not the majority provider of rented housing in the
area.
This has applied so far in only one case, in Chirnside in Berwickshire
where six tenants opted not to transfer to the local council and to
remain for now with Scottish Homes as their landlord.
The secretary of the National Forum of Scottish Homes Tenants, Ms Mary
Reid, has pointed out that as government gives people the democratic
right to choose a political representative from a number of options, it
should allow tenants to choose landlords in the same way.
Scottish Homes retort that before a ballot is held, the agency will
have a lengthy period of talks with tenants and potential alternative
landlords. An independent adviser is appointed to give tenants
information and advice. But, say the tenants, how can they be convinced
of the advisers' independence when they are paid for and report to
Scottish Homes?
Scottish Homes say one name is ultimately put on the ballot paper
because they want clear evidence of the tenants' decision. Does this
mean, then, that Scottish Homes does not believe its tenants' capable of
exercising a choice of more than one option?
Labour has leapt into the fray, scenting policitical mileage to be
made from the travails of what is arguably the most powerful but
non-elected authority in Scotland. Scottish Homes controls a vast
budget, with total capital expenditure of the order of #360m. Yet, say
its accusers, it is run by an unelected board. The man chosen to steer
the agency, chairman Sir James Mellon, is a former career diplomat with
no previous experience of housing. He is seen as a political
appointment.
And it has not gone unnoticed that whereas local authorities' housing
budgets have been squeezed till their pips squeak, Scottish Homes has
escaped relatively unscathed.
The dominant model for Scottish Homes, thus far, is for its local
staff together with a selection of tenants to form a new housing
association, stage a buy-out and form a management committee.
There have been notable successes, in Edinburgh and Dumbarton for
instance. There have also been some controversial sales, such as that of
1200 houses in the Borders region to Waverley Housing. It was the
subject of a critical report from the Commons watchdog Public Accounts
Committee which expressed considerable concern about a number of aspects
of the #5m sale and warned the Scottish Office and Scottish Homes to
ensure procedures were changed.
The paradox for the tenants seems to be that the creation of Scottish
Homes was hailed as opening up choices for tenants. However, to allow
them to exercise the choice of switching to local authorities would
involve a political U-turn which seems improbable given that it goes
against the ethos of the agency.
They are thus left with the kind of choice that Hobson the horsekeeper
understood very well.

PASSENGERS aboard a cross-Channel ferry were caught up in a rescue
yesterday when their vessel went to the aid of seamen on a burning cargo
ship.
The 200 passengers watched from the deck of P&amp;O's Pride of Bruges as
the chief officer and crew helped fight the fire in mid-Channel, 17
miles off Ramsgate.
The skipper of the Shofu, which was carrying 2241 tons of bananas in
refrigerated holds, had sent a Mayday call for help when the blaze broke
out in the engine room.
The Pride of Bruges's chief officer, Selwyn Nicholls, boarded the
cargo ship to organise firefighting before Kent firefighters were flown
to the vessel.
Water was pumped from the ferry to cool the freighter down as Mr
Nicholls helped pump water aboard.
A spokesman for Kent Fire Brigade said: ''Onboard fire pumps had
failed. The Pride of Bruges pulled alongside the freighter and assisted
in preventing fire spreading with boundary cooling.''
Another ferry, the Pride of Dover, stood by at the scene in case she
was needed.
Ten of the Shofu's 23 crew were taken off by lifeboat but were
uninjured.
A salvage tug was last night preparing to tow the freighter to
Zeebrugge in Belgium.
The 4900-tonne ship, which is registered with Lloyd's of London, was
en route from Ecuador to Hamburg when the fire broke out.

THE pools firm, Vernons, is cutting back on its donations to charity
because of competition from the national lottery.
It is abandoning a scheme in which 5p of every #1.05 staked is donated
to the Foundation for Sport and Arts.
The company says there has been a 15% fall in its business since the
lottery began in November.
''We very much regret having to withdraw the 5p donations we pass to
the FSA which has in its short existence already achieved a great
deal,'' said managing director Phil Jarrold.
''We must, however, give priority to investing in our business so that
we remain a strong competitor to the national lottery.''
The company gave three-months' notice to the Department of National
Heritage of its intentions. Last month Vernons said it was cutting 95
jobs at its Liverpool headquarters.
However it will continue to pay the tax element of 2.5% which was
previously given to charity in addition to the 5p donation. Vernons
contributed #8.2m through the 5p donations last year and has given
nearly #42m since the FSA was formed in 1991.
A rival pools company, Zetters, which has seen a 10% decrease in
business, said it would try to withstand the losses before it cut
charitable donations.
A spokesman said: ''We have said we will continue to pay 5% to the FSA
until the end of 1995, with the provision that we don't start losing a
lot more money.''
Littlewoods also said it was committed to funding the FSA at current
levels.

Meanwhile a new survey claims that 75% of people would like to see a
lower jackpot and more, smaller prizes in the lottery.
Of nearly 1000 people questioned in the survey by market research
company NOP for the TSB, 54% thought the maximum jackpot should be #5m
or less while only 26% thought there should be no upper limit.
The survey also found that only 41% of all those questioned would
immediately leave their job and retire if they won a #7m jackpot. That
figure sank to just 32% in London and the South-east of England.
The latest jackpot of #9,015,108 is believed to have been won by one
person. The organisers, Camelot, yesterday disclosed that only one
ticket containing all six winning numbers had been sold for last
Saturday's draw.

<HEADLINE>Family in Orkney abuse case claims Bill will not give children full rights</HEADLINE>

THE parents and one of the children who were at the centre of the
Orkney abuse case claimed in Edinburgh yesterday that the legislation
proposed in the Government's Children (Scotland) Bill did not go far
enough to protect children.
Their evidence before the Standing Committee of the House of Commons
sitting in the City Chambers was heard behind closed doors.
One of the parents, Mrs M, said after giving her evidence: ''The Bill
should not be about children but for children. We want to ensure that no
other families suffer the way we did.
''We want to ensure that the new Bill is worded rightly and is strong
enough and just enough to last for generations.''
Her son said children in care did not have the right to speak to a
solicitor, write home or to make telephone calls. ''They have less
rights than a prisoner,'' he said.
During his evidence, he was asked what he thought about the proposed
new exclusion order which sought to remove the alleged abuser from the
scene.
The boy told the standing committee the children should also be
consulted because it could be that, in some cases, the house or the home
had nasty memories for them.
The father said he thought it important everything should start from
the principle of the children having rights, statutory rights, and that
children should know them and how to exercise them.
''What we should be doing is giving the children rights and making the
rights real.''
Members of the Association of Directors of Social Work also gave
evidence and Mr Peter Bates, president, and director of social work with
Tayside Regional Council, said they supported the need to secure for
Scotland a comprehensive Bill that would ensure the care and promotion
of the welfare of children and, at the same time, safeguard the rights
of their parents and families.
He said far too many families in Scotland were seriously damaged by
poverty and multiple disadvantage. For many of these children and their
families the great stress and hardships placed them ''at risk'',
requiring the positive intervention and support of the local authority
and other related services like education, housing, and the NHS.
The association was also looking for an improvement in the legislation
for children and families who were subjected to allegations of child
abuse. Of primary concern must be an approach that tried on the one hand
to protect and promote the needs of children, and on the other to secure
and safeguard the rights and responsibility of parents.
Mr Bates said that for parents and children subjected to allegations
that proved to be unfounded, the process of intervention and assessment
could be extremely distressing.
He added that the Bill did not adequately address these issues.

FOUR people appeared in private at Ayr Sheriff Court yesterday on a
variety of charges relating to the possession and supply of controlled
drugs.
All had been arrested after police were called to the Hanger 13
nightclub at the Pavilion on the town's seafront.
Ms Jacqueline Heeney, 20, of Somerfield Street, Glasgow, and Mr
Stephen Finnegan, 20, of Kingston Avenue, Neilston, face charges of
being in possession of ecstasy tablets with intent to supply and of
being concerned in the supply of ecstasy.
Mr David Wilson, 18, of Menock Road, Cathcart, Glasgow, and Mr Andrew
Jamieson, 19, of Millbank Road, Wishaw, are accused of being in
possession of a quantity of temazepam capsules -- 78 in the case of Mr
Wilson -- with intent to supply and of being concerned in the supply of
temazepam.
None of the accused made any plea or declaration and all were
committed for further examination. Ms Heeney was remanded in custody
while the three men were released on bail.

A JUMBO jet carrying almost 300 people was forced to make an
unscheduled three-hour stopover at Glasgow Airport yesterday after its
captain decided to remove a passenger.
The man, a 47-year-old Canadian, ignored several warnings about his
behaviour before being handcuffed by crew members and restrained by
fellow passengers on the KLM flight from Amsterdam to Toronto.
After being led off the plane, he was thought to have been charged
under civil aviation law, and with breach of the peace.
A KLM spokesman in Holland was last night unable to give exact details
of what happened on the plane, but said the captain had taken the rare
measure of ejecting the man because of his ''aggressive behaviour''.
He added: ''It was entirely the captain's decision to disembark at an
intermediate point, and was taken in the interests of the other
passengers and crew.''
The incident is understood to have cost the airline thousands of
pounds, as the plane was forced to jettison a large quantity of fuel to
ensure its safe landing at Glasgow.
The other 287 passengers on board spent more than three hours inside
the airport terminal while replacement fuel and extra food was taken on,
and the crew prepared a new flight plan for the remainder of the
eight-hour trip to Canada.
It was not clear last night whether KLM would take legal action
against the passenger in an attempt to recover its additional costs, or
whether it would ban him from future flights.
The spokesman said yesterday's proceedings were so unusual that he did
not know what the airline's stance would be.
Strathclyde Police said a 47-year-old man had been arrested after a
disturbance on the plane, and was due to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court
later today.

THE wing of the Labour Party which believes most strongly in Scottish
sovereignty last night rebuffed suggestions it could be marginalised by
the strong pro-Union stance of Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson.
Both Labour and SNP claimed victory in the televised debate between
their leaders, with Mr Alex Salmond arguing that the impassioned defence
of the Union by Mr Robertson would alienate many within his party's
membership and its voters who take a relaxed view to independence as a
long-term aspiration.
Mr Salmond was so pleased with his performance in the head-to-head
that he called a press conference to claim that in defending the Union
so robustly Mr Robertson had proved that ''New Labour'' was now wildly
out of touch with the 50% of his own voters who told a System Three poll
in The Herald last week that they were in favour of independence.
''The trend in Scottish opinion is clearly towards the Scottish
dimension,'' he said. ''In facing the other way, George Robertson has
left Labour stranded on a Unionist beach.''
Mr Robertson hit back, saying that having lost the argument, his
opponent was now ''thrashing round wildly''. He seized on Mr Salmond's
insistence that the SNP could jump from having three MPs to 37 as a sign
of lacking credibility and claimed Mr Salmond had made a ''shameful
admission'' in saying his party would seek to wreck the new parliament.
Mr Salmond had in fact said that although the SNP would campaign in
elections for the new body on the basis of seeking a mandate for
independence, if they ended up as a minority there they would abide by
its rules in the same way that their MPs operate at Westminster.
However, the convener of Scottish Labour Action, the grouping on the
''nationalist'' wing of Labour, Mr Bob McLean, last night ruled out
defections to the SNP. ''I don't think that will be the scenario at
all,'' he said.
''I think last night may have given us more latitude to exert more
influence, turning talk of strengthening the Union into reforming the
Union, and of a new settlement between Scotland the rest of Great
Britain. It might be ironic that George is being cast as an
arch-Unionist because relations between SLA and the leadership have
become civilised, open and positive.
''Those of us in SLA have a very heavy stake in the Labour Party. We
are committed, we believe it is our party. If anything, some of the
things said last night help our arguments about the tone and language of
the debate being worked on.''
Most neutral observers believed that Mr Salmond had won his televised
joust with Mr Robertson, although Labour's general secretary in
Scotland, Mr Jack McConnell, claimed Nationalists in the audience had
''behaved like a rabble'' and Mr Salmond had relied on ''smart
one-liners and planted questions''.
Although there were questions from known party activists on both
sides, this reference appeared to concern a question about the
protagonists' second-choice option.
Mr Salmond answered by saying devolution was preferable to the status
quo, but Mr Robertson refused to give a straight answer distinguishing
between independence and the status quo.
Labour claimed this came from an SNP plant, but the questioner,
anti-nuclear campaigner Lorraine Mann, insisted that she was a member of
no party and was a floating voter. Mr McConnell continued to suggest
yesterday that the question was a plant as Ms Mann ''had been seen
talking to SNP officials before the debate''.
But last night Ms Mann said Mr McConnell's allegation was ''absolute
nonsense''.
She added: ''The only people I knew were Rhona Brankin, vice chairman
of the Scottish Labour Party, who I said 'hello' to.
''At no time did I speak to any SNP officials. Mr McConnell's
allegation reflects badly on the Labour Party. People who know me,
including Rhona Brankin, are well aware that I am a floating voter.''

THE leader of the Labour Party, Mr Tony Blair, was accused yesterday
of acting like Pontius Pilate over the way he has washed his hands of
anti-abortion campaigners.
His stance was attacked by Mr Michael Forsyth, Minister of State at
the Home Office, who added that the Opposition leader had even ignored
the pleas for tolerance from a cardinal.
Speaking to the Stirling Conservative Ladies luncheon club in
Stirling, the Conservative MP criticised Mr Blair over the decision to
continue the ban on groups against abortion from attending Labour
conferences.
Mr Forsyth commented: ''The truth is his party is gripped by the kind
of militant feminists who give equality of opportunity a bad name, and
he is not prepared to take them on.''
He claimed that the militant feminists had, in fact, hijacked Labour
and forced it to designate seats which they consider winnable, like
Stirling, as solely for women candidates.
However, the Tory MP added wryly: ''It seems that Labour women share
our view that Stirling will remain a Conservative seat if stories of
their difficulties in finding a candidate are to be believed.
''Labour have been forced, too, to insist that every constituency
sends a women to their Scottish Parliament in order to meet a 50% quota.
Their conference also voted for lesser penalties for women who murder
their male partners, ignoring a basic tenant of our justice system of
equality before the law.''
Modern Labour, Mr Forsyth continued, cannot tell the difference
between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. ''It is the
former which we must strive for and the latter which leads to injustice
and intolerance,'' he told his audience.
Earlier this week, a group of Scottish Labour MPs revealed that it was
prepared to go against the party's ruling executive by providing a stall
for banned anti-abortion campaigners at next month's Labour conference.
Cardinal Winning has also written twice to the Labour leader,
expressing his anger over the ban and seeking his intervention in the
matter.

THE Government yesterday underlined its warning to British
holidaymakers to avoid the Gambia, despite assurances from the West
African state's military regime that democracy would be restored by the
end of next year.
Foreign Office Minister of State Baroness Chalker told the Lords at
question time: ''We continue to recommend that tourists consider
postponing non-essential travel.
''The situation in the country remains uncertain and security could
still deteriorate quickly.''
Of the delay in restoring democracy, she said: ''The two years
announced by the regime is still too long, because it effectively means
that the Gambia would suffer at least another 17 months of military rule
and there is no guarantee that the military would leave even then.''
She added: ''The longer the military junta stays, the greater the harm
to the economy and the longer it will take to build it up again.''

Confusion over ill-fated at-
tempts to forge an anti-Government alliance over last night's vote
sparked an internal Liberal Democrat row, it has emerged.
Foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell fired off a terse memo to
party leader Paddy Ashdown, effectively claiming that he was being made
a scapegoat for the failure of the bid to team up with Labour.
In the memo, leaked to London's Evening Standard, Mr Campbell, charged
with briefing Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on the plans, wrote:
''I am a little concerned that in the analysis of the events surrounding
our Supply Day on Monday, February 13, it seems to be accepted that I
misunderstood my 'instructions' in relation to what I was to advise
Robin Cook.''
He claimed to have carried out instructions to the letter and
colleagues Mr Archy Kirkwood and Mr Charles Kennedy would back him.

<TEXT>
HUGE increases in fees charged at the Court of Session were condemned
as obscene last night by Labour's Scottish Home Affairs spokesman Mr
John McFall.
He said the rises ranging up to 238% would deter many people from
seeking justice and would undermine the court's important role in
interpreting and developing civil law in Scotland.
''The Scots have always had a strong sense that justice should be
available to all, but the Tories' sole criterion is to cut back on all
public provision in order to fund pre-election tax cuts. It's obscene,''
said Mr McFall, the MP for Dumbarton.
Under the new scales introduced this month, existing fees have been
increased by 17.5% but a variety of new tariffs have also been
introduced, including daily charges for hearings and proofs for both
pursuers and defenders.
Mr McFall said that for a typical one-day hearing (#411) the overall
rise was 78% and a two-day proof (#601) was up 120%.
The largest increase (238%) would apply to a four-day proof and
summary hearing which would now cost #1170 instead of #348.
In addition, he said, changes in legal aid elegibility had excluded
250,000 Scots from access to the protection of the courts.
''The Government clearly regards justice as simply another commodity,
available only to those with the money to purchase it,'' said Mr McFall.
The increases were also condemned last night by the Law Society of
Scotland. Spokesman Mr Michael Clancy said: ''We are very concerned
about this development and will monitor its effects very closely.''
Mr Clancy said there had been a noticeable drop in cases going through
sheriff courts after fees were increased substantially last year.
The Court of Session dealt with 4000 cases a year, mostly of an
important nature or raising points of principle.
Mr Clancy said the legal system could suffer if there was a sustained
drop in its workload as well as those denied access because of the
increased costs of litigation. ''The impact could be considerable,'' he
said.

<RECORDNO>979861782</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE chairman of Lloyd's of London, Mr David Rowland, last night
appealed to MPs not to undermine its future by highlighting fears that
it may become insolvent.
He made his plea under cross-examination from the Treasury and Civil
Service Select Committee which heard that membership of Lloyd's has
plummeted from 32,000 to 15,000.
The world's biggest insurance market was hit by huge losses in the
early 1990s which ruined many ''Names'' who insure risk against their
own personal wealth.
Mr Rowland made his appeal in exchanges with Tory Nicholas Budgen
(Wolverhampton SW) who asked: ''There is a risk that in the future
Lloyd's may be found to be insolvent, isn't there?''
The chairman replied: ''Absolutely correct -- as there is a risk for
many distinguished insurance companies in the world.''
However, he went on: ''We are a commercial undertaking.
''Every time we talk like this, there is another client that goes to
one of our competitors. Under no circumstances should we conceal
anything improper. If I stand for anything, I stand for that.
''But the very nature and thrust of your questions causes exactly what
we're talking about.''
Mr Rowland warned of the consequences for many parts of the world if
Lloyd's did fail -- particularly in North America.
''The international ripples would be very, very substantial,'' he
said.
He made clear that he did not expect the taxpayer to ''bale out''
Lloyd's for the losses, as some had urged.
Stressing the beneficial effects of recent reforms, he went on: ''We
are dealing with immense difficulties. There have been enormous problems
to contend with.
''We are doing our utmost to bring a successful resolution to the huge
problems that we have. We are doing the very best that we can.''
He underlined that external regulation might have avoided some of the
earlier difficulties -- but not all.
The public gallery at the meeting was packed with spectators, many
standing, who were called to order on several occasions as they heckled
and jeered at some of the evidence.

IT would be the ultimate privatisation, said Tony Benn, ''the
privatisation of government''. The mechanism would be the adoption by
Britain and other EU partners of a single currency which itself would be
''handed over to bankers'', who would fix interest rates and spending
levels for us all.
If Parliament agreed to that, he said, ''we would be digging a great
grave and putting this place in it''.
Yesterday's Commons debate was a cause of shame to the leaderships of
the two main parties. Both might say that in politics you sometimes have
to do shameful things to keep your options open.
The Liberal Democrats had sponsored a motion calling for a referendum
if any further substantial constitutional changes in the European Union
are made. The issue of Britain's relations with the EU is the dominating
one of this parliament: the option of putting it to the people a matter
of great importance.
The Government and Labour decided on a boycott, putting on two and one
line whips respectively and putting up junior spokesmen to speak. The
debate was to be downgraded before it began and when rather less than
half of the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party turned up to hear their
leader, it looked as if apathy had spread to the sponsoring party.
Mr Ashdown said the European cause was in danger of faltering because
of a lack of strong leadership, a view reinforced by the performance of
the junior Foreign Office Minister, David Davis. Admittedly, the task of
representing the Government as a united front on Europe might have taxed
nimbler orators than he.
However, as he is the Minister we are contributing to the extremely
important committee which is to prepare the agenda for the 1996 Euro
summit, one had to hope that he is better round the table than on his
feet. A naturally slow speaker, he bravely took a barrage of
interventions and saw the speech disintegrate into a series of remarks
punctuated by interruptions.
After his speech subsided rather than ended, Joyce Quin for Labour
showed she knew quite a bit about Europe and that she was somewhat
uneasy with the party line that either a General Election or a
referendum might be used to let the people speak on Europe, a position
demolished by Mr Peter Shore, who reminded her that elections are fought
on 101 issues, referendums only on one.
The debate was rescued by some elder statesmen. Mr Benn, combining
battiness and incisive analysis with his usual eloquence soon had us
sitting up. The press were correctly lambasted -- I plead guilty -- to
describing opponents of Maastricht as Europhobes. Opponents to current
trends in Europe did not merit that term any more than his opposition to
the present Government made him an Anglophobe, reprimanded Mr Benn.
If the federalists had their way, Mr Blair, should he win the next
election, would decline to ''the chairman of the British Municipal
Corporation pleading in Frankfurt for permission to do something about
unemployment''.
Lord Tebbit had a point about rioting, he reflected. It was what the
disenfranchised traditionally did to get their point of view noticed.
But he feared that political frustration would lead to the nastier forms
of nationalism -- blaming foreigners for what was our own fault for
surrendering control of our destiny.
Mr Tim Renton, one of the (sorry, Tony) Europhiles who are ''fighting
back'', said that the single currency would bring us one per cent lower
interest rates, more jobs, lower inflation, and five per cent off the
cost of our hols sur le continent. On that basis, he thought the punters
might buy it.
Mr Benn and, after him, Mr Peter Shore and Sir Teddy Taylor evoked
centuries of national independence going down the chute. They appealed
for us to fight for our liberties. They may have been appealing to an
electorate which is no longer there, one which might prefer a gamble on
Mr Renton's offer.

SEVEN Tory MPs voted with the Liberal Democrats last night in favour
of a referendum on Britain's future role in Europe.
They were joined by Liberal Democrat MPs, 19 Labour left wingers and
two SNP MPs to inflict a defeat on the Government by 47 votes to three.
The vote, while embarrassing for the Government, is a constitutional
irrelevance since neither the Labour nor Tory hierarchy took the debate
seriously, and Ministers can point to the fact that only 6% of the House
actually took part in the vote.
There were, however, angry scenes at the end of last night's
six-and-a-half hour debate, in which the Liberal Democrats had called
for a referendum ''before any substantial alteration of the present
constitutional settlement between the European Union and its member
states''.
With both Labour and the Tories officially ignoring the debate, the
SNP had to sacrifice one of its number, Angus East MP Andrew Welsh, as a
teller for the ''No'' lobby, simply to ensure that a vote took place at
all. He was helped by arch Euro-sceptic Tony Marlow, who also wanted to
ensure the vote was recorded.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said after the vote: ''This was yet another
demonstration of parliamentary usual channels at work. It shows the
extent of the collusion between the Tory and Labour parties at
Westminster, which would shock their supporters outside.''
Liberal Democrat spokesman Charles Kennedy said: ''This intriguing
parliamentary victory will be seen as a real vote for common sense by
voters across Britain. We won our victory without any help from the
leadership of the Labour Party.
''This outcome helps build the momentum for an eventual referendum if
the next Intergovernmental Conference has constitutional implications.
We welcome this result and the Government should be forced to accept
it.''
The seven Tories who voted with the Lib Dems were: Mr Vivian Bendall
(Ilford North), Mr Bill Cash (Stafford), Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow),
Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East), Mr
Bill Walker (Tayside North), and Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood).
The three Tories who bothered to vote against the Lib-Dem motion were
Mr Robert Hicks (Cornwall SE), Sir Terence Higgins (Worthing), and Mr
Tim Rathbone (Lewes).
The bitterness spilled over at the close of the debate when Mr Giles
Radice (Lab Durham N) said the Liberal Democrats had not sought to
involve Labour fully with their motion and so were not serious about
defeating the Government.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown bluntly replied: ''The words
were drawn up and there was widespread consultation with other
opposition parties including Labour.
''Labour saw the words, they were given the offer of changing them or
at least suggesting how they might be changed.
''That offer was never taken up. There was never any kind of response
from Labour.''
Earlier, it had been disclosed that the tactics had sparked an
internal Liberal Democrat row.
Winding up for the Government, Junior Foreign Office Minister Tony
Baldry said the Liberal Democrat motion was a ''tawdry and ham-fisted''
attempt to win party political advantage.
He claimed a ''vicious row'' had broken out among the Liberal
Democrats after they had ''lamentably failed'' to ''cobble a deal''
together with the Labour Party to embarrass the Government.
Launching the call for a referendum, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy
Ashdown complained that the debate about Europe among politicians had
excluded the people Europe was supposed to serve.
Mr Ashdown warned: ''Another attempt to take the people of Europe into
a process of further integration, either depending on their ignorance or
against their will, could be fatal to the whole European project.
''Next time, we have to engage our electorates in the debate and carry
them with us.''
Accusing the Tories of being divided ''from end to end'', he said:
''The battleground of Europe has been ceded to a tiny minority of the
Tory Right.''
Europe was far too important an issue to be left to ''an internal spat
in the Conservative Party and the minor mathematics of the Conservative
whips''.
The debate had to be widened beyond the confines of the Conservative
Party to include the public at large, he insisted.
However, the Foreign Office Minister of State, Mr David Davis, accused
the Liberal Democrats of ''political opportunism'' by staging the
debate.
''It is a paradox that we are debating these vital issues on such an
irrelevant motion . . . but characteristic of the Liberal Party,'' he
said.
''The motion calls for a referendum before any substantial alteration
of the present constitutional settlement between the EU and its member
states.
''Such a substantial change would require the assent of every single
member state and it won't get it.''
He said the question of a referendum would not therefore arise.
Pressed by Tory backbenchers and amid some confusion, Mr Davis agreed
with an earlier statement by the Prime Minister that a referendum on a
single currency was not ruled out.
He insisted Ministers would resist any ''centralising'' measures at
next year's crucial intergovernmental conference.

A YOUNG policewoman wept at the Old Bailey yesterday as she accused a
drunken male colleague of raping her after a ''Toffs and Tarts'' party
at their police lodgings.
PC Michael Seear from Surrey Police was normally ''impeccably
behaved'', the court heard.
But at a New Year party at their section house he turned into an
aggressive violent sex attacker, the 25-year-old WPC alleged.
''I was saying 'What are you doing -- stop it.' He was really weird.
It was like it was not him. His face was strange. It was dark but I
could see his eyes. They did not seem to be focused.
''I was really panicking. I could not understand why he was doing it.
It just seemed so sick,'' the policewoman said.
''He was looking right through me -- it did not seem to register who I
was. I thought he was really going for it. He said 'I am going to f---
you.' I felt he was going to. He said it very aggressively -- like he
really hated me.''
PC Seear, 25, of Lightwater, Surrey, has pled not guilty to raping the
woman on January 1 last year.
He allegedly told her he had been at the ''Toffs and Tarts'' party and
was very drunk, the jury heard.
The WPC said she was sitting in a television room in the early hours
of New Year's Day waiting for her own policeman boyfriend to get ready
for bed when PC Seear asked her to help him back to his room at 2am.
He seemed so drunk she had to support him along the corridor.
''He was zigzagging -- hitting doors as he went. When we got to his
room, I guided him in.
''He just suddenly turned and locked the door. Then he just grabbed me
round the waist and neck and tried to kiss me.
''I turned away and he grabbed my wrist and pulled it behind me and
pushed my neck back. He was biting my neck. I told him to get off and he
just grabbed my breasts and was squeezing really hard.''
She added: ''I took a step backward -- but I could not get away from
him. I stumbled back over the bed and cracked my head against the wall
-- it was a really loud knock.
''The next thing I knew, he was standing over me. I was feeling kind
of funny -- sick in my head. I remember he had his shirt on but he did
not have anything else on.''
The WPC said she saw he was in a state of arousal.
''I was saying 'What are you doing -- stop it.' He did not seem to
hear what I was saying to him.
''All I could think of was that he was on top of me. I tried to get
up. He was pushing me around,'' the policewoman said.
PC Seear had allegedly knelt on her knee and held her wrists ''very
tight''.
''I was very surprised at his strength -- he is not a big guy. I
consider myself very strong and he was drunk, hardly being able to walk,
slurring his speech . . . .
''I was struggling to get up and he grabbed at my body and breasts.''
Asked what he said to her, the officer told the court: ''I really
don't want to say this -- he said he did not believe the size of my
breasts and wondered what they would look like without my clothes on --
but the language was not like that.
The trial continues.

<HEADLINE>18-month ban for Minister's cousin</HEADLINE>

A COUSIN by marriage of Scottish Transport Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton was banned for 18 months and fined #250 at Haddington
Sheriff Court yesterday for driving with twice the alcohol limit.
Charity organiser Anthony Nigel Buchan-Watt, 48, is husband of
Christine Lillias Drummond-Hay, a cousin of Elizabeth, Dowager Duchess
of Hamilton.
He is the fourth relative of the dowager duchess to have been banned
for drink-driving related offences in the past two years.
Others have included three of her sons, the Duke of Hamilton,
Scotland's premier peer; Lord Hugh Douglas-Hamilton; and Lord Patrick
Douglas-Hamilton.
Her other sons are Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, 52, and Lord David Douglas-Hamilton, 42.
Buchan-Watt was found to have a breath-alcohol level of 82
microgrammes. The legal limit is 35.
He admitted driving with excess alcohol on the Begbie-Westfield road
in East Lothian on February 5. The court heard how he was stopped by
police near his home at Westfield Farm Cottages, near Haddington, during
a routine check.
Procurator-fiscal depute Joan Arnott said that Buchan-Watt had smelled
of alcohol and his condition was confirmed by breath tests.
Defence solicitor John Hetherington said his client had suffered from
migraine attacks since he was a child. He also suffered from depression
and stress.
Buchan-Watt usually had 30 minutes' warning of a severe migraine
attack and had begun to feel unwell while in Haddington.
He had taken a brandy and port to ease his condition and as a last
resort, and in panic, had driven his car in an attempt to get home.
On September 26 last year Lord Patrick Douglas-Hamilton was banned for
10 years and fined #1000 at Haddington Sheriff Court for being in charge
of a car while nearly three times over the blood-alcohol drink limit.
Lord Patrick, 44, a self-employed photographer, of Westfield House,
near Haddington, admitted it was his third offence involving drink and
cars.
He had been changing a burst tyre when caught by police on the A1 near
Tranent, East Lothian, on June 22.
On June 17, 1993, the Duke of Hamilton, 54, whose family seat is at
Lennoxlove, near Haddington, admitted at Haddington Sheriff Court his
fifth drink-driving offence.
He was given 200 hours of community service and an eight-year ban.
On November 11, 1993, the advocate who defended him, Raymond Fraser,
46, was fined #2000 and banned from driving for seven years at
Haddington Sheriff Court on a drinks charge.
Earlier, on February 1, 1993, another of the duke's brothers, Lord
Hugh Douglas-Hamilton, 47, of Begbie Farmhouse, near Haddington, was
fined #400 and banned for 18 months for drink-driving.

AN M77 protester will appear in Glasgow Sheriff Court today after
clashes between demonstrators and security personnel guarding tree
fellers clearing a site at Malletsheugh.
Mr Colin MacLeod, 28, was reported to the procurator-fiscal in
connection with an alleged assault on a security guard at the site in
fields adjacent to Pilmuir Road.
A 45-year-old man was arrested at the same time for allegedly causing
a disturbance, and is also expected to appear in court today.
Two other protesters are currently on remand in Glasgow's Barlinnie
prison, after refusing to accept bail conditions forbidding them from
obstructing or interfering with employees of Wimpey Construction, the
company contracted to build the M77 link.
Mr Paul Murphy, from Langside, and Mr Jake Hunter, who lives at a camp
established in Pollok Estate, are alleged to have committed a breach of
the peace last Thursday at another section of the proposed road.
The pair, together with a 20-year-old woman, Ms Frances Claxton, who
accepted the bail conditions, will go on trial on February 27.
In an earlier incident at the Malletsheugh site yesterday, a protester
claimed he was dragged through a barbed wire fence by a number of
security guards from the company engaged by Wimpey Construction,
Securiguard.
Mr Tam Roy, 35, alleged he sustained a seven inch gash on his right
leg and cuts to his arms when he was removed from the site.
He said: ''I was grabbed in a head-lock and dragged through barbed
wire by about seven of them.''
He also claimed that watching police refused to listen to his
complaint of assault, but instead had warned him.
Mr Roy also alleged that the security guards behaved in an aggressive
manner. He claimed they wore no identification.
A spokesman from the security firm, who refused to give his name,
confirmed his men had removed Mr Roy from a site where trees were being
felled, but insisted they had lifted Mr Roy carefully over any fences
and had not injured him.
The spokesman said: ''About six protesters arrived at the site at
about 8.30am, and one jumped the fence and started trying to interfere
with the sawyers.
''This is an extremely dangerous area, so we decided to remove that
man. Obviously we regret anybody being hurt, but there is no question of
any intent to injure on the part of my men.''
He confirmed that the firm had asked police to intervene, adding: ''We
asked the police to warn the man as he was jumping about and we were
fearful of his safety.''

<HEADLINE>One climber found, but hopes fade for Scot still missing after three nights. Rescue team in race to save man found on Ben Nevis</HEADLINE>

Members of Lochaber mountain rescue team were in engaged in a race
against time last night to save a climber found alive on Ben Nevis 12
hours after he fell during a 1500ft rock climb on the North-east
Buttress.
Mr Martin Rayner, of Evesham, Worcestershire, had been clmbing with
German-born Sacha Backes, 22, from Swathling, Southampton, who was
rescued earlier yesterday.
Mr Rayner was found still attached to his rope against the ice covered
Orion's Face and is believed to have very serious head injuries.
The rescue team placed him in a stretcher and winched him by rope to
the summit area.
In an incredible feat of endurance they then began to carry the
casualty, who was reported to be seriously ill at that point, off the
mountain.
An RAF Sea King helicopter, which has been standing by at Fort
William, can only fly to a point below the cloud base.
One of the RAF's most experienced rescue pilots, Flight Lieutenant
John Prince was waiting at the controls.
The pilot and crew have been waiting at the West End Car Park in Fort
William ready to take off for the rendezvous point at a moment's notice.
The casualty was expected to be picked up in the helicopter during the
night and taken initially to Belford Hospital at Fort William.
Mr Backes's condition was last night described as stable although a
Belford Hospital spokesman said he was suffering from ''fairly severe
frostbite and hypothermia''.
Meanwhile, hopes of finding 24-year-old Glasgow climber Allan Sands
still alive in the hills above Glencoe were fading last night.
Despite a high risk of avalanche, around 100 rescuers aided by tracker
dogs and a Royal Navy helicopter resumed their search for Mr Sands, a
bookshop manager from Torrisdale Street, Strathbungo, Glasgow.
He has been missing in the White Corries area since Friday, having
left no details of his proposed route.
It is understood he had only been equipped for a day's climb. When Mr
John Grieve, the leader of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team, stood the
search down yesterday afternoon, he said there was little chance of
finding Mr Sands alive after three nights in the mountains.
The father and mother of Mr Sands, Alex and Nancy, arrived in Glencoe
yesterday from their home in East Kilbride. Inspector John MacDonald, of
the Northern Constabulary, said last night: ''The search for Mr Sands
will resume in the morning, but it will be scaled down.''
Neighbours of Mr and Mrs Sands in East Kilbride were last night keenly
following the search for Mr Sands.
They said Mr Sands, an only child, was a graduate of Stirling
University. ''We are all hoping,'' said one. ''Allan is a very pleasant
boy, cheerful and good natured.''
As the Glencoe search was about to begin again yesterday morning a
report was received at Fort William Police Station by radiophone from a
climbers' hut at the foot of the north face of Ben Nevis that two
climbers were in difficulties on the North East Buttress.
Climbers in the hut had heard cries of help coming from the buttress.
The helicopter from HMS Gannet at Prestwick which had been assisting at
Glencoe was diverted to Ben Nevis.
After airlifting three members of the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team on
to the summit of the Ben, the helicopter crew managed to pick Mr Backes
off the face and take him down to safety. Rescue efforts were
subsquently delayed by a false report that another two climbers were
cragfast on the Orion Face.
The rescue team leader, Mr Terry Confield, said: ''Conditions near the
summit were very bad indeed, with high winds and avalanche risks.
''At one point, leading off the summit and into Coire Leis, the snow
was driving so hard we could hardly walk against it.''

<HEADLINE>Inquiry told of baby's 'inevitable' death</HEADLINE>

A SIX-DAY-OLD baby died from an acute lack of oxygen incurred around
the time of her birth after her mother ''exploded into labour'', a fatal
accident inquiry at Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
Helen Allan was born in the early hours of March 8, 1993, at Aberdeen
Maternity Hospital, Foresterhill, Aberdeen.
Her mother, Mrs Ann Allan, 33, King Street, Aberdeen, told the inquiry
she had received prostin gel as part of her treatment when admitted on
the afternoon of March 7, 1993, 13 days past her expected delivery date.
A decision was taken to induce the birth and she was given the gel to
induce her labour.
Mrs Allan said it took immediate effect and she began to have severe
contractions. She was in severe pain and given diamorphine which
eventually gave her some relief.
She said she had previously been told it would take three or four
hours for the gel to take effect, but she ''exploded into labour'' as
soon as it was applied.
After the baby was born, she was taken away. ''I expected to get her
into my arms but she disapeared,'' said Mrs Allan, adding: ''She was
very grey.''
Mrs Allan said she was told later that Helen was going to die. She
stayed in hospital until the baby died on the morning of March 14.
Dr Paul Duffie, 48, a consultant paediatrician who treated the baby,
told the inquiry he had certified the cause of death as acute lack of
oxygen incurred around the time of her birth, and blood loss.
He told Mr David Burnside, representing Mrs Allan, that the baby's
condition at the time of her birth was such that her death was
inevitable.
Dr Marion Hall, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said that
the policy at the hospital whenever the gel is now administered is for
continuous electronic monitoring throughout the period of labour.
Dr Hall said she was in favour of this change as it could give an
indication of lack of oxygen in the baby and she felt that routine
monitoring was not adequate. She agreed that this case was one of the
reasons which had led to the change.
The inquiry continues.

THE debate over repair plans for Glasgow's storm-damaged Bell's Bridge
rumbled on yesterday, increasing the possibility that the paddle steamer
Waverley could be trapped at her winter berth at Anderston Quay with her
spring programme in jeopardy.
The bridge has remained closed since the December floods when a crack
running for 300 yards appeared in the north bank. As a result the
bridge, which links Glasgow's former garden festival site and the
Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, cannot be swung open.
Glasgow Development Agency, which owns the #1.5m bridge, told SECC
management that yesterday was the deadline for instructing engineers to
repair the structure to allow the paddler to raise steam by March 6 and
move to dry dock in Greenock for the final stages of a #350,000 refit.
The Waverley is scheduled to resume public cruising at Easter.
However, SECC management, which owns the quayside, have refused the
agency access for the repairs until its insurers have given the
all-clear.
The latest row comes less than a week after The Herald disclosed that
the SECC had objected to the continued presence of the bridge in its
present location because it ''affects the integrity'' of the present
site.
Mr Mike Closier, SECC chief executive, said engineers had estimated
that the quayside repairs would cost ''hundreds of thousands of
pounds''.
Engineers have advised him that the damage may have caused ''voids''
underneath the road and pathway running alongside the quayside making
the thoroughfares unsafe for use by the public or heavy plant machinery.
He said: ''We have worked as swiftly as possible to overcome this
problem. It disappoints me that the Waverley could be trapped, but I
would be derelict in my duty to allow works to go on without the
permission of my insurers.
''Perhaps the GDA can come up with some other method of completing
repairs on the bridge within a shorter period to allow the Waverley to
move.''
Waverley Excursions has said any prolonged problems with the bridge
could be disastrous. Captain David Neill said: ''Any delay in leaving
Anderston Quay would seriously jeopardise the viability of the
company.''
A GDA spokesman said it considered repair work to the Bell's Bridge
should be carried out with the ''utmost urgency'' because its continued
closure was a ''major inconvenience'' to a large number of people who
used it.
He said a company was on standby to begin the repairs -- which would
be neither expensive or lengthy -- next Monday.
Permission for the repair work had been sought from Mr Closier who had
been assured that any damage to SECC property caused by repair works to
the bridge would be made good by the GDA. But the spokesman said no
response to the request had been received.
The bridge was built as a temporary feature for the garden festival in
1988.
A spokesman for Clydeport said it had no ongoing responsibility for
the operation and maintenance of the bridge. He said it was a
requirement of navigation on the river that the bridge continued to
open, or otherwise operate, to allow river navigation to the east of the
bridge.

THE proposed M74 link in Glasgow has provoked a huge response, mainly
objections, to the city planning department.
Mr Don Jamie, a chief planning officer for the council, said:
''Batches of mail are arriving every day but already the response stands
at over 350, whilst the final tally could be over 400.''
The official closing date for responses to the Strathclyde Regional
Council's plan was Friday, but it is believed the council will consider
representations from interested individuals and organisations for some
time yet.
The vast majority of reponses are understood to be hostile to the
#200m development.
The planned extension, almost five miles long, which forms the second
phase of the extension of the M74 from the Maryville Interchange at the
south end of the M73 to the M8 at Kingston, is intended to reduce
congestion in the centre and east of Glasgow.
Two churches, seven listed industrial buildings, 100 commercial
properties, and blocks of flats would have to be demolished if the
motorway project received the go-ahead.
Friends of the Earth Scotland has lodged a formal objection.
Its head of research, Dr Richard Dixon, said: ''We are calling on the
councillors of Glasgow to listen to the people and save their city from
a slow death by congestion and pollution by resoundingly rejecting this
proposal.
''The M74 is an out-of-date scheme . . . that is completely at odds
with 90s transport thinking and is no solution to twenty-first century
problems.''
The three-lane motorway could be completed in about five years.

A CHILD who deliberately set fire to an artificial plant has caused a
safety alert throughout Glasgow District Council.
Officials were astonished at the speed and intensity of the blaze
recently in the foyer of an Ibrox block of flats.
They have since ordered that plant containers with artificial material
should be removed from all council premises and such containers will not
in future be installed in any public foyers or corridors.
It is understood that the Health and Safety Executive is to mount a
campaign warning the public of the fire hazard represented by artificial
plants.
The risks inherent in artificial plant material were brought home to
members of the parks and recreation committee yesterday as councillors
watched a video of a demonstration burn carried out by the fire brigade.
Within two minutes of ignition, the material and the plastic container
were burning fiercely and giving off thick black clouds of toxic smoke.
The fire brigade has recommended that artificial plants and planters
should not be installed in escape routes from premises, including
entrances, foyers, staircases, landings, and corridors.
The artificial plant material involved in the Ibrox incident was
supplied by the council's parks department and had been treated with a
fire resistant chemical. This treatment should have been repeated every
three months, but was not maintained after delivery.
A parks department spokesman said the offer of a maintenance contract
had been declined.

TWO boys, aged 13 and 14, were charged last night following a
joyriding crash which left a 27-year-old woman impaled on spiked
railings.
Two other boys, aged 14 and 16, were released on bail by police
pending further inquiries.
Ms Collette Maragh, 27, was thrown in the air and impaled by the neck
after being hit by a car in Harcourt Road, Sheffield, on Sunday.
Passers-by came to her aid until emergency services arrived.
She underwent emergency surgery and remained on a life support machine
in Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital last night.
A spokeswoman said Ms Maragh, who lives in Harcourt Road, was
''seriously ill but stable''.
After she was struck, a car careered through a fence and down a bank
before crashing.
A car had been reported missing from an area of the city about four
miles from the scene of the accident. It narrowly missed a number of
parked cars as it was driven at speed into Harcourt Road at about
2.40pm.
Inspector Tom Walton said a car ''travelled across the road, hitting a
pedestrian on the footpath.
''She was thrown through the air and impaled on some railings around a
commercial property.''
Two boys will appear before Sheffield Juvenile Court today charged
with aggravated taking a vehicle without the owner's consent.

BRIAN O'Neil, the young Celtic defender who began the season wondering
if his future lay away from Parkhead, made a return to the international
scene yesterday.
Scotland team manager Craig Brown called O'Neil into his B squad for
the game against Northern Ireland at Easter Road next week and then held
out the promise of future promotion. He also suggested that a step up to
the full squad could be more immediate than anyone would expect.
The 22-year-old is one of the players from Brown's own quite recent
past as coach for the Youth and Under-21 teams. Like the others who have
graduated by that route, he holds a special place in Brown's thoughts.
The accomplished O'Neil, who has been shuttled between attack and
midfield and now, finally, defence with Celtic, has emerged as a serious
contender to play against Russia in Moscow next month.
Brown still maintains that Motherwell veteran Brian Martin is first in
line for that opportunity. Yet he adds: ''Brian O'Neil has been very
impressive and he is a European type of centre half.
''In the Youth teams and the Under-21 side we could use him in
different positions. Yet when we had that run to the semi-finals of the
European Under-21 Championship Brian was played at the heart of the
defence, where he could start attacking moves for us.
''Now, Brian Martin is first in line for a chance, because he missed
out on the last game in Athens, when he was injured. But O'Neil oozes
class and, if he continues his current form, I would have no worries
about using him in Moscow.''
O'Neil joins Martin and Hibs' Darren Jackson as the serious candidates
for the European Championship clash at the end of next month.
Brown had complimentary remarks to make on how Stephen Wright --
another of his personal proteges -- performed against Rangers and hinted
strongly that he could ultimately replace his club skipper, Stewart
McKimmie, in the Scottish side. Not, though, for the time being.
The other members of next week's squad is a mix of younger players and
others with experience. The form shown by Motherwell, five players,
Hibs, three players, and even Kilmarnock, with two players, indicates
the manager's thinking.
He was left without Anglos because of club games, and the same applied
to Hearts and Rangers men, who play their Scottish Cup tie at Tynecastle
just 24 hours earlier. Scotland B squad:
Brown (Kilmarnock), Cameron (Raith Rovers), Dodds (Aberdeen), Henry
(Kilmarnock), Jackson (Hibs), Lambert, McCart, McKinnon, Martin (all
Motherwell), McGinlay (Hibernian), O'Donnell, O'Neil (both Celtic), Rae
(Millwall), Tweed (Hibernian), Walker (Partick Thistle), Woods
(Motherwell), Wright (Aberdeen).

THE SRU are to change their disciplinary measures, and might even copy
their English counterparts by introducing red and yellow cards for
referees in rugby matches next season.
Martin Scott, the Dunfermline player who moved to England, last month
became the first person to receive the red card, but he was subsequently
exonerated after an appeal.
''The International Board has been experimenting with them,'' says SRU
Refereeing Development Officer Ian Goodall, ''and if they feel that
further experimentation is needed next year then we will have them in
Scotland.''
Allan Hosie, the former international referee, and now an SRU
representative on the International Board, agreed. ''We will wait to see
how the English get on, and then decide for ourselves,'' he said. ''For
instance, one of the advantages the English have in their big games is
neutral touch judges. However, even that has caused problems, as in last
week's international, when Derek Bevan, the referee, did not give the
yellow card after his touch judge had flagged for an offence. And yet
the only reason a touch judge can flag is for foul play. A yellow card
should have been shown.''
Many have doubts over the use of coloured cards on rugby pitches,
arguing that they play to the crowd, potentially hazardous in rugby
which prides itself on having less abuse of referees than many other
sports, notably soccer.
Harassment of referees by spectators is hardly new, but Sunday's
referee who took charge of the match between the Scottish and Irish
women at Myreside was subjected to a constant stream of abuse from a
small section of the crowd that was an embarrassment to the game.
Another incident, which occurred during a second XV game between
Hillhead/Jordanhill and Glasgow Academicals on the previous day, may
also have repercussions. Exchange referee Colin Rigby, from Stewart's
Melville, is alleged to have been verbally abused from the touchline
throughout the game.
''These guys have no place in rugby,'' says Rigby. ''I think that it
is becoming worse lower down the level in rugby, with ignorance of the
laws the main reason for spectators becoming unhappy with referees.''
Goodall also confirmed that no longer will SRU disciplinary committee
members be asked to vote over the telephone on the length of punishment
for specific offences, the average then being used. Now, three men,
Charlie Ritchie, Allan Hosie and Lorne Crerar, will deal with all
offences in a specialist capacity.
Perhaps they should also get Crerar to deal with any troubles arising
from spectators. Refereeing a Dundee derby some years ago, he was
subjected to a tirade from one paying customer who insisted on
attempting to describe the referee as ''a poofter.''
Unluckily for the spectator concerned, Crerar's then girlfriend was,
during a lull in the play, able to tug the offender's sleeve and say
loudly: ''Oh no, he isn't.'' That was the end of the problem, as the
red-faced spectator left the conflict altogether.

A SCOT playing for the French first division side, Mandelieu, has
claimed that he is paid #800 a month -- in direct contravention of
rugby's amateurism regulations.
The revelation by ex-Hawick and Scotland under-21 wing forward, Kevin
Campbell, will add further fuel to the shamateurism fire after the
admission at the weekend by Toulouse president, Rene Bouscatel, that his
players receive fixed payments and win bonuses.
Scottish Rugby Union chief executive Bill Hogg said yesterday that
32-year-old Campbell's claim would be investigated and, if proved, the
case would be taken up with the International Board and the French Rugby
Federation.
Campbell, now hooker for Mandelieu, has been in France since 1986,
when he met French lock Jean-Charles Orso while on holiday in Cannes.
The introduction was arranged by Hawick clubmate and former Scotland
captain, Colin Deans.
The expatriate Scot, whose brother Alister was a member of Scotland's
1984 Grand Slam side, maintains that the club game in France is now
openly semi-professional with players paying state taxes on earnings
above #6000 a year. He says that French internationalists are paid
around #2500 a month by their clubs.
He told The Herald: ''Some clubs pay wages, some pay bonuses for a
win, and others pay living expenses. When I was with Nice, they paid for
my apartment, but now with Mandelieu, I get #800 a month. Elsewhere, the
payments range from about #400 a month to #2500 for the top players.
''I don't see that there is any point in lying about it. It is common
knowledge. Across here, top-grade rugby is viewed as a second profession
and nobody even bothers to hide the fact that the players are paid.
''I don't consider myself to be a professional. Until recently, I was
running a restaurant, but I have given that up. I'm an accountant, but
not working, and so I suppose I am unemployed. The money that I make
from rugby doesn't make me a full-time professional.''
He added: ''The French club game is well financed. Money comes from
local authorities and sponsors. Mandelieu's annual budget is around
#500,000. Bigger clubs like Toulouse are on budgets of more than #1m.''
Players from the UK have been involved with the French club game for
years. England's Rob Andrew was recruited by Toulouse and currently
Scotland lock Damian Cronin plays for the French second division
Bourges.
Campbell's claims -- and those of Bouscatel, which are to be aired in
a BBC Scotland documentary on Thursday night -- merely underline
long-held suspicions about French rugby. But they have come at an
embarrassing time for the game as Scotland prepare to take on France in
Paris on Saturday.
He added:''I've no doubt that the SRU will be in touch with me, but I
am doing nothing out of the ordinary so far as the French game is
concerned. If action is taken against me, then they would have to look
at other British players who have been involved here.''
Yesterday, the SRU chief executive said that Saturday's international
match at the Parc des Princes was not in jeopardy, but the latest claims
would be investigated and, if shown to be correct, the union would
expect a satisfactory response from the FFR.
The SRU is still committed to the principle of amateurism, but there
is on-going discussion as to how the term could be redefined to allow,
for instance, a player to add to his off-field earning capacity by
endorsement contracts.
Meanwhile, the SRU announced yesterday that the crackdown on
Murrayfield black market hospitality packages is to be stepped up with
''illegally sourced'' warning notices being placed on seats for the game
against Wales on March 4. The union still reserves the right to eject
people from the stadium and a final decision will be taken in the week
leading up to the Welsh match.
The SRU is offering an amnesty to supporters who have already bought
Welsh match tickets on the black market. SRU head of finance Graham
Ireland said: ''I'm delighted by the response from ordinary rugby
supporters, who are sending us details of illegally sourced tickets that
have been sold to them.
''This has encouraged us to offer an amnesty to supporters in
possession of tickets for the Wales match sourced from agencies or
unofficial operators. We will replace these tickets with official match
tickets, allowing us to take action against the suppliers.
''The amnesty also applies to those who have already sold on their
tickets. These seats will be clearly labelled to indicate that the
person occupying that seat is in breach of the ticket conditions.''
THE Scottish Rugby Union announced yesterday that Scotland's rugby
world cup squad of 26 players will be selected on March 21, with a
public announcement two days later.
The tournament takes place in South Africa from May 25 to June 24 and
Scotland's pool partners are France, Ivory Coast, and Tonga.
* THE SRU has also confirmed, as revealed in The Herald yesterday,
that the Scottish Districts v Irish Provinces series will not go ahead
next season. SRU chief executive Bill Hogg expressed surprise that the
news had broken in the media in advance of an official announcement.
* WESTERN Samoa, who tour Scotland and England next winter, will play
the Scots at Murrayfield on November 18. The tourists also will play
Scotland A at a venue to be arranged, Edinburgh District on November 8,
and North and Midlands District on November 14 or 15.

THE romance of the cup has taken on new meaning at Celtic Park, writes
James Traynor. Anyone who wants to mark Valentine's Day by doing
something different can buy one #15 ticket and get another free for
Celtic's Scottish Cup tie against Meadowbank at Hampden on Saturday.
''This offer is for male and female Celtic supporters alike,'' said
Celtic's chief executive, Fergus McCann, only recently returned from his
own honeymoon and clearly still full of the joys. ''Bring your Valentine
for free,'' he intones.
Steady boy, steady. Think about this for a moment Fergus.
Football fans are among the most resourceful people in the land and
the thought of a ticket free of charge is bound to have the bhoys
scheming.
As their real valentines are left wondering where their best frocks
and high heels have gone, there could be a strange crowd indeed
teetering up to the Hampden turnstiles come Saturday. There is a fair
chance there will be some burly and stubbly-chinned damsels hanging on
the arms of blokes looking rather sheepish.
Two for the price of one? It's got to be worth it, especially since
the chances of being rumbled are pretty slim, which is more than the new
''girlfriends'' are likely to be.

CRICKET'S world governing body last night launched an investigation
into bribery allegations after former Australian captain Allan Border's
admission he was offered money to throw a Test match.
The International Cricket Council have demanded further information
from the Australian Cricket Board over Border's claims that he was
offered a bribe to allow England to win the fifth Ashes Test at
Edgbaston in 1993.
Border's allegations come only two days after ACB chief executive
Graham Halbish confirmed several players had experienced similar
approaches during Australia's tour of Pakistan in October and November.
0
Border spoke to reporters in response to newspaper reports which
claimed an unidentified former Pakistan Test player offered him #500,000
to lose the match.
''I was a bit angry at the time, but I have not thought about it much
until it has come up again over the last couple of days know.''
In a further twist yesterday, former Pakistan captain Mushtaq Mohammad
admitted to a light-hearted conversation with Border in the Edgbaston
dressing room during the 1993 Test, but expressed surprise that the
affair had suddenly blown up.
In a radio interview, Mushtaq said: ''I jokingly passed a remark and
said 'What happened? Did somebody offer you big money? What are you
going to do?'
''He said 'I have never messed with my cricket?'. I said 'Fine, that's
good enough for me. Well I'm glad we have played our cricket at a time
when it was clean and proper.' Now a lot is being said in the paper that
Allan Border is upset about what I said to him 18 months ago. It's a
farce. If he was that upset, why didn't he come out then and there?''
Sydney's Telegraph Mirror newspaper claimed the offer was made to
Border in sterling on behalf of a Pakastani betting syndicate.
Australia, needing 120 to win the match at the time of the alleged
incident, beat England by eight wickets to take a 4-0 lead in the
six-Test series.
Bookmakers William Hill, who quoted England at 7-1 to win the Test in
1993, noticed no unusual betting patterns.
Former Australian Test batsman Dean Jones has also revealed he was
offered #30,000 by an Indian bookmaker to disclose inside information
about the Australian side during the tour of Sri Lanka from
August-September 1992.
According to a report in Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald newspaper,
spin pair Shane Warne and Tim May were offered the same amount to
perform badly during last year's Test series in Pakistan.
But the allegations drew an angry response from senior Pakistan
cricket officials. ''We take serious exception to the fact that this
occurrence five months ago was not brought to the attention of the Board
of Cricket Clubs of Pakistan,'' said Javed Burki, chairman of the BCCP
ad hoc committee.

TRIPLE Joy can give punters something to smile about today in the
opening Reid Minty Handicap at Lingfield.
The filly has to give plenty of weight away, but has fully deserved
her spot on top of the handicap. She wound up last season with a hat
trick of successes.
Although her breeding suggests that a mile should be well within her
compass, it looks as if six furlongs is her ideal distance.
This view was borne out when Triple Joy, after leading from five
fulongs out until well inside the final furlong, was passed by eventual
winner Red Valerian and then the fast-finishing Ertlon over seven
furlongs a month ago. That was a Class A race and the opposition in this
affair does not look quite so testing.
Mentalasanythin was well backed here a week ago before running out a
convincing eight-length winner off top weight in an amateur riders'
handicap. He tries his luck again in the Reid Minty Stakes and could
take some catching.
On the same afternoon, Wild Rice stamped himself as probably a class
above the normal all-weather recruit when sauntering to a
three-and-a-half lengths defeat of Nuthatch.
Wild Rice certainly looked as if he could go on to better things and
he can retain his unbeaten record in the Reid Minty Conditions Stakes.
* LAST year's Champion Hurdle winner, Flakey Dove, looks to have run
her last race after banging herself on the gallops.

MCA Powerhouse Cardinals prepare for this weekend's Scottish Women's
Volleyball Cup semi-final with Hazlehead in the best possible frame of
mind. MCA defeated Whitburn 15-6, 15-3, 15-0 in the league on Saturday
and, remarkably, won the final 23 points in the match.
Coach Vince Krawczyk speaks highly of the squad he had to remould last
summer after the loss of Norwegian internationalist Maiken Areskjold,
the Belgian Sigrid Adams and the influential Maura Housley.
''I rate this team above the one that won the league and cup double
last year,'' says Krawczyk. ''We are now preparing for our tenth cup
semi-final in a row and we've been in the last five finals.
''We're hoping that Saturday's match with Hazlehead will bring us
closer to Provincial Insurance's record of eight finals in a row.''
In Saturday's other semi-final, Grange aim to become the first third
division team to reach the final when they take on Rucanor Jets.
0 Outdoors, former Whitburn player Audrey Cooper continues to make
money from the beach game. With her English partner, Amanda Glover,
Cooper finished equal ninth in the beach tournament in Chile.
The Anglo-Scottish pair beat Chile II 15-0 and Japan II 15-8 before
going down 15-8 to the USA. They were rewarded with $1500 and gained
valuable world ranking points before next month's World Beach
Championships in Brazil.

THE Scandinavian connection, enigmatic and paradoxical as any film
from that country, stretched from Gran Canaria to San Diego with the
victories at the weekend of a complete unknown in Swede Jarmo Sandelin
and of Peter Jacobsen, an American of Nordic descent who has suddenly
resurrected a career which, by the most sympathetic of descriptions, was
becalmed in a sluggish sea.
In Europe Swedish players have, over the past 10 years, reached a
healthy level of competence and arrived in considerable numbers. Yet
until Sunday only five of them had collectively won 11 tournaments --
Ove Sellberg and Anders Forsbrand, with three each, Mats Lanner and
Per-Ulrik Johansson, with two, and Joakim Haegmann, with one.
So far, too, Haegmann has been their sole representative in the Ryder
Cup team, not as of right on points but through his selection by the
captain, Bernard Gallacher. Still, Sweden's achievements so far -- not
forgetting those in amateur golf -- are a reasonable return for the
considerable funds, much of them government-sourced, invested in the
country's golf.
Sandelin, aged 27, certainly qualifies for the category labelled as
''having risen without trace.'' In his only previous year on the
European Tour, in 1992, he finished No.191 on the order of merit, and he
qualified for this season by taking the last but one of the first 10
places on the Challenge Tour's money list.
Moreover, his three previous performances this winter did not suggest
the capability of giving none other than Severiano Ballesteros six
strokes of an advantage with only 14 holes to play and beating him by
one stroke.
Ballesteros, although disappointed not to have gained his fifty-fourth
European victory since 1976, believes that his prize of more than
#21,000 has assured him of his eighth Ryder Cup appearance. He now has
333,422 points, almost 129,000 ahead of the next player on the list,
Bernhard Langer.
''It is good for all the best players to qualify automatically, to
give Bernard more choice with his two selections,'' Ballesteros said.
Since the qualification process began last September Ballesteros has won
one tournament, been second three times, and had three other top-10
finishes in eight outings.
By comparison with the Spaniard's numerous appearances in the match
against the United States, Jacobsen, within a month of his forty-first
birthday, is on course to play for his country for the first time since
he joined the US Tour 18 years ago. It would be fitting if this outgoing
and genial personality had his career properly rounded off.
Having finished eighty-eighth and seventy-seventh on the last two
money lists and having won the last of his four tournaments in the 1990
Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Jacobsen, like Sandelin, confounded all
expectations by taking the past two events in successive weeks -- the
AT&amp;T National Pro-am at Pebble Beach and the Buick Invitational at
Torrey Pines.
These results have confirmed how wide the catchment area of winners on
both tours has become. Moreover, probably because the players of mature
years are fitter for longer than they used to be, the mellowness of
their ages is no longer a barrier to the winner's enclosure.

AS SCOTLAND'S squad start their run-up preparations for the assault on
the Parc des Princes hoodoo on Saturday, it might do them no harm to sit
through the television tape of the entire match at Colombes Stadium in
1969, when the last win in Paris was achieved.
That would indicate how even gifted Frenchmen can be thwarted by the
total dedication of their opponents to keeping the door shut with cover
and tackling out of the top drawer. It also might stir the troops
further in confidence and mettle if James William Telfer supplied some
back-up descriptive comment in his own distinctive style. He might even
smile at the memory.
He not only captained Scotland to that extraordinary triumph but
scored the match-winning try four minutes into injury time, a score that
brought from a certain television commentator an uncharacteristically
hysterical shriek, not, as many thought, of biased delight but of pure
shock at Scotland getting out of jail in one of the great escapes of all
time. Scotland had been so outplayed that, during Telfer's half-time
talk to the troops, a disgruntled French supporter in the stand asked if
he was holding a team talk or a service of thanksgiving.
France should have won by a barrowload but were denied by one of the
most incredible displays of grit and commitment to field coverage and
tackling ever seen. That included such unforgettable sights as
tight-head prop Sandy Carmichael crashing the flying wing, Jean-Marie
Bonal, into touch at the corner and lock Alastair McHarg getting across
to turn the other wing, Andre Campaes, into the Scottish cover.
The main lesson of that 1969 miracle still applies -- keep knocking
them over. As the French have just suffered much physical frustration at
Twickenham, a few clattering Scottish tackles early on could prove a
strong psychological factor in creating that sinking feeling of ''Mon
Dieu, not again.''
Perhaps the most important tackles will be those that can check big
French forwards short of the gain line. That applies especially to their
formidable loose forwards, Laurent Cabannes, Phillipe Benatton, and,
perhaps most dangerous of all, Abdelatif Benazzi. Thus the sharp edge of
their initial assault could be blunted, with fewer opportunities
accruing for rippling ball transference. Time and again sizzling,
high-speed French tries have stemmed from initial forward assault
followed by lightning, wide transference to the aristocrats in wake.
Tackles, punts, and drop goals might make appropriate headlines in the
Scottish battle plan, but there must be care in punting. Misdirected
kicks are as meat and drink to adventurous Frenchmen. Even in the
confined running areas of the modern game, the French still conjure
segments of magical interplay and often from improbably deep positions.
Hopefully, too, Craig Chalmers will celebrate coming within three caps
of John Rutherford's Scottish record for a stand-off of 42, by taking
his drop-goal expertise out of his locker.
The French are notoriously parsimonious in the concession of tries.
Indeed in their past six championship games at Parc des Princes they
have scored 18 tries and leaked just one. On their past three Paris
visits, total Scottish pointage has comprised four penalty goals and one
drop goal.
French defence has the benefit of impressive pace in both forward
engagement and retreat running. So a drop goal or two from the Chalmers
boot (he landed seven on the Lions' tour of Australia in 1989), could
prove tremendously encouraging to Scottish morale and determination,
especially if Gavin Hastings also is striking his goal-kicks with
precision. Scotland's captain has a rich haul against France of 78
points in nine appearances.
Of equal importance is that Scotland's aged warriors -- Hastings,
Chalmers, Ken Milne, Damian Cronin, and Iain Morrison -- should play
their part in encouraging the initiates for the peculiar stresses
inherent in performing at Parc des Princes, where the atmosphere is just
as chilling and intimidating as anything at Cardiff Arms Park.
Apart from collective glory the Scots can do their captain a huge
favour. He is fed up of hearing the broadcast of that Telfer try in 1969
as a reminder of how long it has been since Scotland won in Paris. In
that the great man is far from being alone.

THE plan for a national golf centre, hailed to be ''the home and heart
of Scottish amateur golf,'' is back on the tee 14 months after it was
first announced. Balbirnie Park, in Fife, which has been the site under
detailed examination, was rejected on Sunday by the 16 areas of the
Scottish Golf Union, who also threw out the idea of a full-blown centre
complete with accommodation.
The SGU's four-man ad hoc committee, whose first choice of Loch Lomond
was voted out in favour of Balbirnie Park, have now been given a remit
to look again at possible sites for the lesser model.
That, under the original vision, still would include offices for the
new SGU headquarters, currently based at Barnton, Edinburgh, lecture,
video, locker and medical rooms, gymnasium, driving bays, pitching and
putting practice areas, and a few full holes of golf adjacent to an
existing or planned high-quality course. That might cost in the region
of #1m, half the original estimate, which had included purpose-built
basic accommodation for up to 36 people.
Where the centre might eventually be -- and when -- is anyone's guess,
though it might be reasonable to speculate that only a central Scotland
venue would win a majority vote. None of the three voted on previously
-- Balbirnie Park, Loch Lomond, and Craigtoun in St Andrews -- fitted
that bill. My crystal ball is mysteriously showing the names of
Glenbervie, already home of the Scottish PGA, and the slightly less
favourably located Dalmahoy.
While the SGU have completed the full circle, there are some positive
signs to be taken. In passing Go and collecting #200, or in their case
#400,000, the sum put aside resulting from last year's increase in per
capital levy from #2.40 to #5, there are no financial difficulties. This
figure is likely to double from this year's subscriptions and increase
further through possible grant aid from a variety of local, national and
European sources.
There is also agreement on the need for such a centre where a year ago
there was controversy. A series of SGU roadshows in the interim went a
long way to persuading their 200,000 affiliated golfers of the need for
such a venture to step up the current coaching efforts being made at
both St Andrews and Inverclyde and to bring standards in Scotland back
into line with other European nations, who have forged ahead in recent
times.
Dr George Gormley, the SGU president, said yesterday: ''We appreciate
the co-operation of Balbirnie Park before and during preparation of the
feasibility study, but must now take a step back and consider sites for
the modified scheme.
''We initially looked at 26 sites for the full scheme, including
accommodation, and while many of these were not appropriate at that
stage some might now be capable of hosting the area's preferred option.
In addition to these sites, we would still like to hear from clubs and
developers who could work with the SGU in planning a national golf
centre.''
The ad hoc committee of the SGU will now consider which of those 26
sites and any new locations would be the preferred sites and will report
back to the executive with their recommendations. Thereafter, the
consultative process will proceed to a vote by the areas as to which
site merits further detailed investigation.
That sounds worrying in the camel-is-a-horse-designed-by-committee
stakes, especially when compared to the English Golf Union's comparably
clean-cut decision to buy Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire lock, stock and
barrel for #8m.
The ad hoc committee -- comprising Douglas Rae and Douglas Dalglish,
the last two SGU presidents, Ernest Barnard, the current senior vice
president, and co-opted member Ian Skillen -- last night met to roll the
dice once more. Their next move is in three weeks'time.

MAYBE they will have to lie down and admit defeat before the end of
the season, but no-one at Firhill is giving any credence to that
prospect yet and, if any side is capable of extricating themselves from
what appears a desperate situation, Partick Thistle have to be the ones.
In their time, they have managed to get out of more tight corners than
Nigel Mansell and a few clubs have discovered already that they can be
stubborn opponents when they are up against it.
Hibs were the latest to underestimate the ability of Thistle to work
unceasingly until the final whistle and, if Dundee United are at all
careless at Firhill tonight, they will be the next to go down to the
Maryhill lot.
That will be relevant, of course, only if this rearranged premier
divsion game takes place. Four times already it has been postponed and,
although no inspection is planned, if the rains come down today it could
be dicey once more.
But, as ever, Thistle remain optimistic about everything, a fact
illustrated by their manager, John Lambie's admission yesterday that
they were genuinely annoyed at having to miss premier action at the
weekend when they were due to play Motherwell.
''My players were desperate to play.'' he said. ''After the Hibs game
they were on a high, and in any case we don't want to fall behind with
our fixtures and face a pile-up. It wouldn't do us any good.''
The fact that both these teams have had to sit idle recently means
that others have slipped futher ahead of them in the table and leaves
these them bottom and second bottom respectively.
United would put daylight between themselves and the bottom club if
they win and, as a consequence, leap into seventh place. Thistle, on the
other hand, could reel in the main body to within one point if they can
overcome United.
Thistle have everybody fit and available. United, whose captain,
Maurice Malpas, would not have been able to play on Saturday, has
recovered from a calf injury, are having a close look at a player with a
good reputation from Portugal, Rui Esteves, midfield man from Benfica.
Esteves arrived in Scotland at the weekend to be given a trial period
by United manager Ivan Golac, who has already signed one man from the
Portuguese league, Sergio. The player was recommended by a former Red
Star Belgrade player, who is now a coach with Benfica.
Esteves has not been able to command a regular Benfica place but is
reputedly wanted by other, less well off, Portuguese teams.

AIRDRIE assistant manager John McVeigh yesterday wondered how long
clubs could remain full-time in the first division, his thoughts
prompted by the scenario that if Airdrie and Dunfermline win this
evening, they will join Dundee and Raith Rovers on 47 points at the top.
One team only is certain of promotion, another will be involved in a
play-off with the second-bottom side in the premier division, and
McVeigh said: ''Surely there is a place for all four in the top league.
I hear people talking about how we should consider the future of the
game. But the major question is how it will help football if clubs have
to switch from full to part-time.''
He added: ''The price of failure in the first division is too great.''
Airdrie's Paul Jack and Tom McIntyre are added after suspension, but
midfielder John Davies remains doubtful as they meet his previous club,
Clydebank, at Broadwood.
Dunfermline have Marc Millar and Tommy Harrison suspended, and
probably send out the side which beat Dundee as they face bottom club
Stranraer, who are without Darren Henderson and Billy Ferguson, at East
End Park
Stranraer manager Alex McAnespie admits that his side's task is made
harder because it is a midweek game.
''We are the only part-time team in the division, and it is a
disadvantage when players have to work all day and then switch over to
playing such an important match,'' he said.
St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock still plans a couple of changes as
a follow-up to the cup defeat by Stenhousemuir, when they meet Hamilton
at McDiarmid Park.
Stenhousemuir midfielder Max Christie is looking forward to one of the
biggest weeks ever for the club.
Christie, previously with Meadowbank and Dundee, is now an influential
player for the second division leaders -- who have his father, Terry, as
manager. They visit Brechin tonight in the league and then look forward
to their sell-out Scottish Cup tie on Saturday against Aberdeen.
Christie yesterday spelled out the success secret when he said: ''We
are disciplined, organised, and have great spirit. We have experience in
defence, we work hard in midfield, and have two of the fastest strikers
in the league in Miller Mathieson and Gareth Hutchison.''
In the third division, Albion Rovers' new manager, Jimmy Crease, gets
a second chance to look at his players as they visit East Stirling.
Crease, who took over on Friday, has had a busy weekend. ''I have been
contacting those whom I know in both the senior and Junior game looking
to strengthen my playing squad. I would expect to include a couple of
trialists.''

MANCHESTER United star Eric Cantona is to take legal action against
ITN for defamation, and violation of his privacy.
The Frenchman, already under police and Football Association
investigation for his feet-first assault on a fan during a match at
Crystal Palace last month, is alleged to have mounted a similar attack
on ITN reporter Terry Lloyd.
Cantona had been confronted by the news team while holidaying with his
pregnant wife and son on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.
''Eric Cantona and his family are the object of unacceptable abuse,''
said his lawyer Jean-Jacques Bertrand. He also hinted that legal action
would be taken against any other television station or newspaper using
pictures of Cantona with his family.
The infamous Selhurst Park incident led to a club suspension for the
remainder of the season and an indefinite ban from the French national
team, but Old Trafford manager manager Alex Ferguson yesterday backed
his beleaguered star over the latest allegations.
''To film without permission a man's six-month pregnant wife in her
swimsuit sitting on a beach is deplorable,'' said Ferguson, who sent
Cantona away to try to escape media attention. Any husband worth his
salt would react and this ITN interviewer has got off lightly in my
view.''
Meanwhile, Cantona, also fined #20,000 by his club, will have a date
with the police when he returns from the Caribbean later this week.
Officers were said to be infuriated when he failed to accompany
club-mate Paul Ince to south London for questioning last week.

JACK Charlton's Republic of Ireland squad was yesterday reduced to the
bare minimum of 16 for tomorrow's clash with England in Dublin after Ray
Houghton became the latest player to drop out injured.
Charlton has now called up Tranmere's Liam O'Brien -- having
discovered that his first standby choice Mike Milligan is also injured
-- for a game that will be watched by a 46,000 sell-out crowd at
Lansdowne Road, but is fast losing its credibility as a meaningful full
international friendly.
From his original 22-man selection Charlton had already lost
Manchester United's Roy Keane, Gary Kelly of Leeds, Tranmere's John
Aldrige, Motherwell's Tommy Coyne, and Bolton's Jason McAteer before
Aston Villa veteran Houghton yesterday withdrew with a calf injury.
Charlton said: ''We are used to this kind of setback, particularly at
this time of the season when there are so many matches, but I still have
good cover in all areas.''

SCOTS have dominated the world indoor singles championship with six
wins in the past 13 years but are still without a success in the pairs.
Richard Corsie and Alex Marshall took a step nearer ending the run by
beating New Zealand's Andrew Curtain and Rowan Brassey in four sets to
reach the last eight of the #132,000 Churchill Insurance-sponsored event
in Preston yesterday.
The Scots began with a 7-0 whitewash but had to haul themselves back
from 1-5 before snatching the second by 7-6. They surrended a 6-3
advantage in the third as the Kiwis recovered for 7-6 and then moved 5-0
ahead in the fourth. But the Scots picked up the seven shots they needed
over the next four ends.
Their quarter-final opponents will be Welsh pair Stephen Rees and John
Price, who ended the Scots' hopes at the same stage last year.
East Lothian's Graham Robertson and his Scots-born partner, Hong
Kong's Mark McMahon, won a three-and-a-half-hour marathon against
England's Greg Harlow and Mervyn King 6-7, 7-5, 1-7, 7-5, 7-4. That put
them through to a quarter-final clash with six-times former winners Tony
Allcock and David Bryant.
Also through are Ireland's Roy Battersby and David Corkill.
* EAST Lothian surrendered their hold on the CIS Insurance Scottish
Indoor League title at the weekend despite ending their section

ANDERS Limpar spoiled Tony Cottee's glory night with a late equaliser
that left both West Ham and Everton seriously threatened by relegation.
Limpar ended his 11-month wait for an Everton goal with a strike in 80
minutes to rob former Goodison forward Cottee of revenge for being shown
the door in September.
Cottee snapped up two vintage goals in the mud and rain of Upton Park,
Paul Rideout equalising in between, to put West Ham within reach of
victory, but Limpar had the last word in the 2-2 draw.
The man who eventually built up a cult following at Highbury has had
just as difficult a time establishing himself with Everton. He has
hardly started consecutive matches since his #1.6m move north in March,
1994. He had to be content with a substitute berth at Upton Park, but
once Joe Royle had pushed him on in 69 minutes to replace Gary Ablett,
Everton always looked capable of snatching victory.

THERE may be no surprise selections in the Scottish Women's Hockey
squad to play England in two internationals at Lilleshall on February 25
and 26, but there is one noticeable absentee -- Margery Coutts, the team
captain for the past five years.
Coutts, a veteran of 96 internationals and a member of the Western
club which has dominated Scottish hockey for over a decade, has decided
to retire.
The 32-year-old, referring to Scotland's concentrated three-month
build-up to the European Nations Cup, said: ''I cannot give the time to
such a programme because of the commitments I have already as manager of
the Scottish under-18 schoolgirl side and my work.''
Her decision to stand down will surprise many in the sport,
particularly when she was so close to the magical figure of 100 caps.
That total would have been reached with comparative ease in Scotland's
build-up to the European Nations Cup in Amsterdam in June, even although
she would not have been available for all 13 friendly internationals.
But she never harboured such thoughts. Coutts was first and foremost a
team member. That philosophy was even carried through to Great Britain.
After having won nine caps, she was overlooked for the Barcelona
Olympics, but yet she was in the stands cheering them on to their bronze
medal.
She will be missed on the international scene, because Scotland has
achieved much under her captaincy. The fifth place won in the European
Nations Cup in Brussels in 1991 was Scotland's highest ranking in the
event.
This was one of the highlights of an illustrious career, but so too
were Scotland's feats in winning two Home Countries championships in the
past four years and the fact that Scotland have beaten England in the
last three internationals between the sides.
Coutts greatest legacy to Scottish women's hockey, however, is the
campaign she fought for them to be allowed to compete in the nations
cup, despite no funding being available.
Scotland went off to Singapore where they reached the final and then
advanced to the inter-continental cup in Philadelphia two years ago, but
while Scotland failed to advance from that event to the World Cup in
Dublin last year, Scotland now has a world ranking of 14. The squad to
meet England is:
Tracey Robb (Western Klick Photopoint), Sue Lawrie (Slough), Louise
Burton, Carrie Corcoran, Janet Jack, Fiona McInnes, Jill Messenger,
Diane Renilson, Rhona Simpson and Helen Walker (all Edinburgh Ladies),
Susan Fraser, Alison Ramsay and Pauline Robertson (all Bonagrass Grove),
Susan Gilmour (Heriot Watt University), Susan MacDonald and Ann Menzies
(both Western Klick Photopoint).

PRINCE Naseem Hamed yesterday proclaimed: ''Put your money on my
predictions.''
Hamed, who celebrated his twenty-first birthday yesterday, said:
''People can be rich if they listen to me. I've got the winning formula.
The only thing I cannot predict is the lottery, but my mum is working on
that one.''
The super-confident WBC international champion, who could be
challenging WBA super-bantamweight holder Wilfredo Vasquez in May, has
picked round three to demolish Argentina's Sergio Liendo at Livingston
on March 4.
And that is a bold selection as Liendo has never been stopped or
knocked off his feet in 49 fights, which include 41 wins. ''He will
probably go in three if plays his cards right. He will fall in the round
I've called,'' added Hamed in Mohammed Ali tones.
So what went wrong in his last fight against Armando Castro? Hamed
predicted the Mexican would fall in five, but did it in four and
explained: ''He got cheeky. I had to do it earlier.''
Hamed insisted: ''I am an exceptional fighter; I'll be the best
produced in this country. I am still a baby. I have had a lot of success
already. All I've got to do is keep my feet on the ground.''
Promoter Frank Warren has offered Vasquez $500,000 to defend against
Hamed in early summer. Vasquez is handled by the Acaries brothers of
France, and Hamed would not mind travelling to Paris for that big
chance, although home town Sheffield is the target site.
''A ring is a ring, a venue is a venue. It doesn't matter I will win.
I have got no problems. I will be world champion in 1995.''
Warren has already fixed April 22 as Hamed's next engagement and
added: ''Naz is 21 and now a man. Vasquez is the best champion around,
he's got the man's title.''
Commercial offers have been rolling in on the wave of Hamed's success
and growing television popularity. He will be involved in a video game
with a big company, while other endorsements are also in the pipeline.
Meanwhile, Johnny Armour will mark time on his conveyor-belt of
African challengers today while he waits for the bigger opportunities to
arrive.
The Chatham southpaw defends his Commonwealth bantamweight title
against South Africa's unbeaten Tsitsi Sokutu at York Hall, Bethnal
Green, perhaps reflecting on the fact that two prospective #60,000
purses for fighting Hamed and Ireland's Wayne McCullough never came to
fruition.
His manager, Mickey Duff, rejected the offer to fight Hamed as he did
not regard it as the right career move, and McCullough is currently on
course to challenge Japan's WBC champion, Yasuei Yakushiji.

GOOD paintings, visitor figures, sales, venue. The Glasgow Society of
Women Artists has struck it rich at the Lillie with an upbeat, enjoyable
show, its 160 exhibits full of colour and joie de vivre.
Flowers are a favourite; their structure so varied, complex, and open
to different interpretations. Ethel Walker's Hellebore reflects in a
silver tray; Anne Donald's muted Pink Roses sit in a square vase.
Elspeth Harrigan excels in botanical accuracy, while Anne Mendelow goes
for spontaneity, as does Laura Harrison with her geranium, Indian cloth,
and azelea. (Harrison, incidentally, has just completed a splendid
portrait of John Bellamy.) Graham and Ballantyne incorporate irises and
roses in their tabletop compositions; Dot Moir uses blooms as a basis
for batik. Pat Sharpe paints snowdrops; Mary Allan a lovely garden urn.
Landscapes are popular too. Dorothy Bruce shows a memorable Strathan
Strand; Ailsa Tanner paints a verdant Sweetheart Abbey; Anne Gordon a
dramatic White House. Helen Turner's Rhum is inspired by Cadell; Anne
Donald enjoys Cambridgeshire but Lilian McCaulay doesn't go further than
Baldernock for sunshine.
Commissioned portraits too often transform unlikely personalities into
saints, like Anne Mackintosh's soft-focus Michael Winner. Louise Annand
fares better from Priscilla Dorwood who docks a few years off her age
but stays true to character. Figure drawings are less dangerous. I love
Anne Anderson's gentle people. Hilda Goldwag's Father and Child is bold
and breezy. Monica Callaghan's X-Ray Soul and Sarah Sumsion's Sea
Objects are among the few abstracts, though Jila Peacock simplifies a
cup and flask. Lin Pattullo's Bowl of Cherries rightly wins the Lauder
Award and Harriet Whitson's gorgeous hats the McCreadie Prize.

BY sipping water between songs, Simon Keenlyside conveyed his message
that he was not in his best voice on Sunday night. But there was a lot
more that was wrong with his recital -- second in the BBC's new
Songlines series -- than that. By keeping his eyes fixed on his music
stand, he was about as communicative as a stick of wood.
Nor was the printed programme much help. In the absence of texts
translations, names of poets, or, from the singer, any sort of spoken
commentary, this was indeed a model example of how to sabotage a song
recital. Though Keenlyside, as Scottish Opera-goers are well aware, is
one of Britain's most promising young baritones, he did himself a
disservice by delivering his opening groups of Rachmaninov and Brahms
songs with such a lack of colour or beauty of phrasing. The sense of
strain on top and bottom notes could be forgiven in the circumstances,
but the absence of characterisation was more puzzling. Even that gifted
accompanist Malcolm Martineau sounded jerky and abrupt.
In Richard Strauss, whose music brought him a little closer to the
opera house, he continued to sound curiously detached. But in his final
American group -- Ives, Barber, Rorem, all sung lyrically in English --
he seemed at last to be getting somewhere. By a year from now this
recital may have developed out of recognition. Meanwhile listeners to
the broadcast on March 4 may hear it to somewhat better effect.

LAST year's windfall profits of up to 400% more for arable farmers are
unlikely to be repeated this year and more careful planning is needed
for future survival, according to a new report from the Agricultural
Development and Advisory Service (ADAS).
This should involve reducing costs of production, aiming for more
environmentally friendly farming and diversifying into non-food crops,
said Dr Julia Walsh, ADAS director general, at an industry seminar in
London yesterday.
Institutional support levels had taken on a high profile on the
political agenda. This pointed towards the need to move away from
dependence on this source of income, to form closer links with the food
industry and to develop more advanced systems of business planning.
Major winners last year were top potato producers with up to 400%
increases in profits, according to the report ''The Growing Business
1995''. For a typical 200 hectare mixed arable farm this could have
boosted income by #70,000. Profits for cereal growers grew by a more
modest 12%.
But neither sector could expect this to continue. Bill Hall, head of
the ADAS business consultancy, warned that potato producers were facing
tough times ahead. ''Next season's profits could fall just as
dramatically as they rose in 1994. In future only those who target a
chosen market and meet that market's requirements will achieve good
margins.''
Jim Orson, head of cereal development, delivered a similar warning for
this sector. The fall in cereals prices over the years had been offset
by cost reductions and yield gains and even in the coming year the
expected drop of #10-#15 per tonne would be largely offset by increased
area payments.
But he added: ''Market pressures will require even further cost
reductions and yield increases to be made. To remain competitive,
farmers will need to be able to grow feed quality cereals at or below
#80 per tonne.''
The opportunities for diversification into non-food crops looked
brighter, acording to Melvyn Askew, head of alternative crops and
biotechnology. ''The potential for plant-derived oils is enormous. The
UK alone uses over 750,000 tonnes of lubricating oils and greases per
annum.
''Currently most of these are processed from crude mineral oil but
many could be substituted by oils and greases of plant origin.
Industrial use of vegetable oils in the EU is already in excess of 1.7
million tonnes a year.''
The report also concludes that the prospect for any increase in the
market for organic produce continues to look poor.

SOME surprises awaited two Strathkelvin firms who reached separate
decisions to set out to achieve ISO 9000 quality certification. Until
then, they had only come into occasional business contact.
But when they began the process with Strathkelvin Enterprise Trust,
they found themselves often sharing the same table and discussing mutual
aspects of what was involved.
Now, amid congratulations, both have succeeded after a process which
began in the spring of last year.
David Murray (Non-Mechanical Plant) Ltd of Woodhead Road, Muirhead,
has achieved ISO 9001 certification through BSI. Baillie and Spence,
building contractors at Crowhill Road, Bishopbriggs, has been awarded
ISO 9002 certification through NQM.
Both had separate but firmly identified reasons while working towards
success.
For Murray Plant at Muirhead, their ISO achievement goes hand in hand
with the design and marketing of their new patented system of Multisheet
500 lightweight steel piling which is attracting worldwide interest.
The development has been described as the first major advance in
trench support systems for more than 20 years. Construction firms as
widely scattered as Austrialia, the United States, the Middle East and
Malasia, want the Multisheet system.
Established in 1974, now with a #2m a year turnover, the Muirhead firm
has steadily built a solid reputation for quality and reliability over
the years in specialised activity in hire and sale of non-mechanical
plant. Its activities cover all Scotland, much of it for the water and
sewage construction world.
''We made the decision to try to obtain ISO certification because it
seemed a logical step forward in seeking both potential future growth
and in establishing our credibility with overseas customers who had to
view us from a start point situation,'' said managing director David
Murray. ''At Murrayplant we started off with several things in our
favour, including a loyal, carefully chosen and trained staff.
Quality manager John Brady's first task was to explain to staff
exactly what would be involved and what it was hoped the benefits would
be. In some areas, Murrayplant found that procedures already in place
only required fine tuning. In others, some procedures had to be changed
to meet the ISO requirements.
''We were aware too that ISO certification does not end there and that
standards set have to be constantly maintained,'' said David Murray.
''But although it meant considerable work at times we are delighted at
the way success has brought congratulations from so many of our
customers.''
At the same time as that process was underway, Murrayplant's design
engineers were hard at work in association with Swedish Steel,
developing their revolutionary new Multisheet system. The new patented
lightweight piling system, now manufactured by Ayrshire Metals at
Irvine, involved an initial investment of #100,000 -- ''A lot of money
for a company of our size.''
The system was born as the result of a discussion David Murray had
with his team in their search for a new approach to piling problems.
''We came up with a more manageable system which is unique. A single
steel sheet, cold rolled into shape, can cover a wide range of
groundwork applications. The formed sheet has the strength of a pile and
equals other light piles of twice its thickness.''
''Our Multisheets system is already in use at work at Glasgow Airport,
at the Beatson oncology department at Glasgow Western Infirmary and in
several other major UK projects. An Australian company, wanting the
system for work out there, has already sent an engineer to Stepps to
receive training in its use. France and Germany want to produce
Multisheet for themselves -- it can be every bit as good as heavy piling
in many applications and can save up to 50% of costs.''
Stronger, lighter and less expensive than previous systems, Multisheet
seems set for considerable worldwide success.
It is one more reason why David Murray sees his firm's achieving ISO
certification as of major importance both now and in the future.
For Baillie and Spence Ltd of Bishopbriggs, building contractors, who
specialise in the construction of petrol filling stations, the decision
to seek ISO quality certification was the result of a careful study of
how best to ensure the firm's future strength and growth.
''It became clear to us that in the year's ahead more and more of our
key customers, the oil companies, would look for that qualification,''
said Mr Andrew Spence, the firm's managing director. ''Constructing new
filling stations has become a highly technical operation and we want to
ensure our continued place at the leading edge of what is involved.''
When the firm started some 21 years ago it was basically a jobbing
joinery concern with only six employees and worked mainly in the Stepps
area. It then became a general building firm and 15 years ago an
opportunity arose to become involved in petrol filling station
construction.
Today, a key force of 30 employees are involved in building new
filling stations all over Scotland for several major oil companies.
Costing on an average around #750,000, each filling station takes
between 10 and 12 weeks to complete. To date, Baillie and Spence have
built several dozen throughout Scotland.
''Modern filling stations require much built-in technology,'' said
Andrew Spence. ''We have teams of specialists who go out from here to
new locations all over Scotland and occasionally into the North of
England. By the competitive nature of the oil industry these contracts
often have to be carried out at very short notice.''
When Baillie and Spence started on their ISO trail one of the first
tasks tackled was to explain the reasons to employees on those scattered
consruction sites. Then the preparing of procedures manuals and other
required steps got underway, a member of the office staff, Avril
Kilcullen, being appointed quality manager.
''Although we were pleased to find that much of what we did was
already in line with what was required there were other areas where we
had to introduce changes,'' said Andrew Spence. ''We also invited
suggestions from our employees, got a good response, and included some
of these.''
At times the total volume of preparatory work required was more than
had been expected. But in a surprisingly short time the Bishopbriggs
firm realised that in addition to improving efficiency the new
procedures were saving them money.
''On the one hand, we had become much more efficient in several day to
day ways, being able to identify any snag that might turn up and why it
happened, then take steps to ensure it wouldn't happen again. On the
other hand, we discovered we had a new and very accurate checking system
on things like plant which had been hired, on materials, and on
costings. Hired plant no longer lies on site any longer than is
necessary, wherever that site may be.
Congratualations on the award have come in from their oil company
customers, from suppliers and from other firms associated in their
general activities as building contractors. The ISO crest is to be
featured on their vehicles and letter headings.

OPERA on a Shoestring have scored another winner with their
semi-staged production of Mozart's Cosi fan tutte. The problem with
concert performances is that they can have the tendency to drag. This
version did take time to settle, but they soon established a good
balance between comic frivolity and dramatic tension.
Musical director Martin Fitzpatrick's pacing was appropriate to the
situation, allowing the words to speak and the music to breathe. Not an
easy score to reduce at the keyboard, Fitzpatrick made an excellent job,
alternating between piano and harpsichord.
Of the cast of six it was the men who dominated the musical action.
Graeme Danby, as the philosopher Don Alphonso, brought his customary
humour to the role and demonstrated once again that he has a voice to be
reckoned with. Equally impressive was young baritone Robin Greenway as
Guglielmo. Commanding stage presence and a rich singing voice suggest a
career in the making.
Tenor Campbell Russell wasn't entirely relaxed in the role of Ferrando
but in male ensemble passages the balance was superb. Of the ladies,
Frances Morrison as Despina brought the most pleasure. Her
interpretation of Una Donna quindici anni was animated and soulful, and
disguised as both the doctor and the lawyer she revealed a versatile
dramatic personality.
Christina Dunwoodie's Fiordiligi and Theresa Goble's Dorabella were
well rehearsed, the emotional high point coming in their first-act trio
with Alphonso -- Soave si il vento -- phrases soaring with ease and
simplicity.
One little grumble. If Opera on a Shoestring are to serve as a
stepping stone to the big stage, then shouldn't the performers be
learning their parts. Maybe the scores on stands will be removed for the
forthcoming production of La Traviata for this year's Mayfest.

No new thing under the sun? Keith Moore follows the dub trail back to
its roots in Jamaica
DUB: the buzzword of the minute. Every 12" single by every two-bit
dance band has a dub mix. In most cases, it's a marketing ploy, another
reason for another mix of the same old song.
The exceptions to this sweeping generalisation -- Portishead, Tricky,
and Massive Attack -- have all done much to bring dub to new audiences
recently, but in the space of a year there is one record label that has
done more for dub than any other: Blood and Fire.
Already a cult label for those new to dub and those in search of
long-deleted slabs of vinyl, the label carries its own guarantee of
quality. The difficulty facing the virgin dub buyer until now has been
that most dub albums carry very little in terms of sleeve notes, and
finding what you think you want to buy can be a consumer nightmare.
Aware of the problem, Steve Barrow, Blood and Fire's A&amp;R man, decided
to rectify the situation with the help of Elliot Rashman and Andy Dodds,
Simply Red's managers.
''The market was always there for decently presented, contextualised
dub reissues. Nowadays we have a sophisticated record-buying public
ready to buy reissue material of all kinds. And I don't want to sound
smug about it, but it was our intention to produce high-quality produce,
and that's exactly what we've done.''
Indeed, if you don't know where to start on your dub trail, B&amp;F, with
its extensive sleevenotes, is a good bet. Like much jazz, the whole dub
thing begins to make sense when the listener understands its evolution,
places the music in a historical perspective.
''The idea was that if you bought a B&amp;F record, you would be buying
something of a certain quality, even if it wasn't immediately
appreciable -- over time it would reveal itself as the listener got used
to the sound, the context, and learned about the history,'' says Barrow.
Named in tribute to a 1971 record by Niney, Blood and Fire is,
coincidentally, also the motto of the Salvation Army, and there are
those who argue that greater salvation is to be found in dub and spliff
than any amount of Bible-bashing.
The most recent release, Yabby U's King Tubby's Prophecies Of Dub,
treats us to some classic roots dub. Tubby was an electronics engineer
in Jamaica in the early 60s, in as much as he repaired televisions and
other appliances, and was able to use his knowledge to create what
became the dominant Jamaican sound.
''A lot of the dub sound comes out of lo-tech accidents,'' explains
Barrow. ''There was and still are a lot of musically-creative people in
Jamaica with limited resources. Producers like Bunny Lee latched on to
the fact that putting a rhythm track on to the other side of a 7" single
was a way of saving money.
''Tubby and various other engineers started fooling around with these
rhythm tracks and dubbing as we know it today was born. They began
creating alternate versions of songs that were well known to Jamaican
record buyers. Their sound became as distinct as that of Sun Studios in
Memphis.
''By 1968 Tubby had met U-Roy, was getting dub plates made, was
refining his sound -- and making it loud. You could hear his sound
system from miles around. The DJ Dennis Al Capone once told me he was
lying in his bed in Kingston and he heard a sound that was drifting
through his window. Getting up, he followed it for three or four miles,
and it was Tubby's sound system. It's wicked, and to me, that's Jamaica
and that's King Tubby.''
What then is Steve Barrow's definition of dub? ''A dub is a new
version of something that already exists, usually within the classic
sense of the King Tubby style -- reverbed and echoed to the heavens.
''Unlike rock, dub is a lot of bottom and a nice crisp top, with not
much in between, a bit of a hole really. Jamaicans like their bass and
drums. Dub is a re-mix which emphasises drums and rhythms, further
spiced up by adding snatches of instrumental, a horn line or a piece of
vocal to create an alternate reading.'' This should become the OED's
definitive explanation.
Talk of sound-systems elicits the news that a B&amp;F sound system could
hit the road some time this year along the lines of Massive Attack's
recent outing, and that sometime Massive vocalist Horace Andy's
seventies classic, In The Light, and its dub brother is to be the next
B&amp;F release.
Then, as if by the grace of Jah, what should fall through the
letterbox but the dub version of Massive Attack's
sure-to-become-a-classic album, Protection. Entitled No Protection and
mixed by the Mad Professor, it lives up to Barrow's definition of dub.
Drastically altered rather than just footered with, No Protection
hardly bears comparison with its original. It comes as a bit of shock to
hear Protection turned on its head, the Professor even having the
audacity to remove the famous riff from the title track. But it works,
and -- in true dub style -- each track has been retitled, Three becoming
Trinity Dub and Weather Storm transferring to Cool Monsoon. It could
just be the album to break this thing called dub on the mass market.

MURRAYPLANT and Baillie and Spence are two of the first companies to
go through qualification for ISO 9000 certification assisted by
Strathkelvin Enterprise Trust.
''These separate companies, going through the process at much the same
time, experienced common areas of training for almost 80% of that
time,'' said Mr Mike Lindsay, quality administration manager at
Strathkelvin Enterprise. ''Application and commitment on the part of
both managements and staffs throughout the training and implementation
phases was exemplary throughout''.
In some ways it was also new ground for Strathkelvin Enterprise. In
the case of Murrayplant, where a design company was included which was
not strictly marketing a product, even the British Standards Institute
agreed that it had not received an application exactly like that before.
A new programme to match had to be prepared.
''It was impressive to note the way in which staff with both companies
kept on with their normal day's work while meeting the new ISO
requirements,'' said Mike Lyndsay.
''From our viewpoint, it was also another illustration of the way in
which the structured approach to quality training and on-site support
offered by the Strathkelvin Trust once again proved to be an excellent
way of enabling companies to achieve this prestigious award in a cost
effective way.''
The programme, he said, not only offered expert training and support
but through the Trust's partnership with Dunbartonshire Enterprise and
Strathclyde Business Development it enabled the cost of certification to
become more attractive.

LEADING animal welfare organisations say they are determined to stamp
out abuse at Scottish livestock markets, and they say farmers should be
much less reliant on the live marketing of their livestock.
Speaking following last week's BBC Scotland television programme which
depicted scenes of abuse of stock in several markets, Mr Jim Morris, the
chief executive of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, confirmed that the society's inspectors would be keeping a
special eye on all markets this week.
Mr Morris added: ''The whole system of livestock marketing is verging
on the archaic and it hasn't changed all that much since the days of the
drovers. The entire approach needs to be upgraded and I think there
should be much closer links between the end buyers and the producers.''
A similar view is held by Compassion in World Farming which, through
its legal director, Mr Peter Stevenson, commented: ''I think it is much
better if animals can be consigned directly. There is clear evidence
that all too often animals are brutally handled in markets. When
informed that all Scottish markets have at least one member of staff
responsible for animal welfare, Mr Stevenson said: ''The law is not
working. We in the UK are deluding ourselves when we say that we have
the best standards of animal welfare in the world. It may be better than
many but it's still not good enough.''
Electronic auctioning was first introduced to the UK from North
America five years ago and at the time it was claimed that the system
would be less stressful for livestock. However, despite the fact that
there are as many as six different systems now open to farmers, the
number of stock sold is very marginal compared to the traditional
outlets.
According to figures published in the farming press for the week ended
Tuesday, February 8, only 2488 steers, heifers and young bulls were sold
in total by all the various systems against a total UK slaughtering of
almost 47,000 head. In plain terms, only 5.3% of cattle are now being
sold electronically.
Mr Morris believes that electronic auctioning could help the image of
the industry but he added: ''I am in favour of studying it further but
it's not quite as simple as some people make out. For example, we
don'tknow how the animals are picked up because there will be no
supervision as there is in markets by our inspectors. And again some of
the journey times could be very long especially if stock is being picked
up in areas like the Highlands.''
However, it seems as though the livestock industry will be forced to
consider its options more closely because it is an open secret that the
welfare lobby, especially the more extreme elements, are set to target
markets and abattoirs if and when they succeed in their current campaign
to ban live exports.
Mr Stevenson made that clear when he said: ''The only thing that is
stopping us just now is the sheer lack of personnel but rest assured we
aim to stamp out any abuses in markets.''

Families head for the cemeteries, taking food and drink, like a
picnic. And having fun. Mary Brennan is introduced to an alternative way
of death
THERE is no gesture in ballet, or in modern dance, that means
mother-in-law. But that's not to say you can't tell stories about them,
or about the effect they have on others.
Choreographer Kim Brandstrup is quite clear about what works and why.
For the chapter and verse of narrative, it's as well to stick to words
-- ''Facts belong to language,'' is how he puts it. ''But it's true that
you can interpret things clearly and powerfully in terms of movement.
You can tap into the emotional undercurrents and personal conflicts that
are so familiar to us whether the context is Shakespearean tragedy or
television soap opera.''
The themes he explores most consistently -- and to acknowledged effect
-- are love and death. In a work like Saints and Shadows, made last year
for his own company, Arc Dance, he drew on recollections of an earlier
tour to Mexico. He describes arriving on All Souls' Day -- known there
as The Day of The Dead -- to find ''skulls. Thousands of skulls.
Everywhere you looked. These great, grinning skulls. And families going
to the cemeteries, taking food and drink, like a picnic. And having fun.
You would see statues of the Madonna and ghetto-blasters side by side at
the graves of people's ancestors -- and everywhere this strange
lightness, this sense of fun.''
This was certainly not how people looked on death and remembrance in
his native Denmark, nor indeed in England, where he trained as a
dance-maker and is now based. ''I found myself thinking that, over in
Mexico, they had a very concrete way of dealing with afterlife. That in
among the innocence of all the fun, there was a mature acceptance of
death that isn't so common in our part of the world.''
The difference in attitudes fascinated him. People's behaviour is a
mainstay of his work, after all -- not merely what they do, but how they
reveal themselves in the tiniest of gestures, the subtlest of glances.
With Saints and Shadows, Brandstrup presents an audience weaned on
funereal glooms and solemn, dignified mourning with an alternative way
of death. The world on stage will resonate with the colours and rich
imagery of Latin American culture, and with the music too -- a warm mix
of mamba, salsa, and merengue rhythms.
''When the curtain goes up, I want the audience to see this world on
stage and be drawn into it,'' says Brandstrup. And that holds true not
just for Saints and Shadows but for his other works. There's an art to
story-telling, and setting the scene can't be left to chance -- or worse
still to a bare stage and the random inventions of the audience. He and
his regular team of collaborators -- composer Ian Dearden, designer
Craig Givens, and lighting designer Tina MacHugh -- share this desire to
create fiction, imaginary worlds and universes which are humanly
appropriate. But done -- he stresses this -- in a simple way.
''It can't be too clotted: theatrical flourishes certainly, but not
the big, empty, grandiose things. The great, overstated gestures that
pass for story-telling in some ballets. My concern is for detail.
Significant, telling detail. It's the tiniest movements that are
important, that draw the audience into the story, pull their
concentration into the work.''
This urge to focus audience attention, to have them zoom in on moments
of movement, harks back to his time as a film student at the University
of Copenhagen. His subsequent move into choreography -- he trained at
the London Contemporary Dance School -- was inspired, he says, by
Hollywood musicals!
It's tempting to attach a film angle to Orfeo, the other work Arc
Dance are performing at Edinburgh's Festival Theatre tonight. Like
Cocteau (with his celebrated Orphee of 1949), Brandstrup has relocated
the familiar myths in another era and introduced some of his own twists
to the tail. Again, the audience are presented with an imaginary world.
This time -- nodding in the direction of Gluck's opera -- it's a Baroque
terrace where the formality, austerity even, of the period is shot
through with the dramatic tussle over Eurydice's life with Death very
much the predatory games player.
The choreography dips into mannerisms and steps from the eighteenth
century, sets them beside freer contemporary movements, takes a gesture
from classical dance here, the everyday flick of a glance there. The
result is a piece which has true emotional clarity and immediately
recognisable meaning.
''It's about body language. People are picking up signals from each
other all the time,'' says Brandstrup. ''They can read moods, reactions,
from the way someone looks at them, from how they turn to go, even from
how they stand still. What I do is find the right body language for the
characters and their emotions.''
The word for this, in anyone's dance terms, is talent. Which is why
his Orfeo won an Olivier Award in 1990 and why, increasingly, his work
wins audiences and critical praise world-wide.

THE CRISIS of confidence at S G Warburg, one of the City of London's
leading securities houses, has claimed the job of chief executive Lord
Cairns, the architect of the abortive plan to merge with Morgan Stanley,
the major US investment bank.
Lord Cairns resigned after an emergency board meeting on Sunday called
to determine how Warburg should react to the crisis. The chairman, Sir
David Scholey, will be chief executive as well as chairman. Sir David
originally masterminded the integration of Warburg's merchant banking
and securities operations. He had intended to step down in June, to be
succeeded by Lord Cairns.
Warburg's shares have been weak ever since the Morgan merger plan fell
through. Their initial reaction yesterday was to plunge from Friday's
close of 726p to 670p, but this prompted speculative support and they
closed 18p lower at 708p.
Failure of the merger left the group drifting without a clear sense of
direction which swiftly undermined morale leading to staff defections,
the most spectacular being the departure of the bulk of the equity
syndicate desk to join Morgan Grenfell, which is owned by Deutsche Bank.
Lord Cairns took the blame for the failure and decided a clean break
was needed. So he has severed all connections with the group which he
joined 16 years ago.
Warburg warned that its investment banking results were still being
affected by a difficult market environment, though 75% owned Mercury
Asset Management was up to expectations. The comment prompted analysts
to scale back their profits' forecasts.
''Our first task and highest priority is to revitalise investment
banking profitability, taking decisive and substantial action to
increase our revenues and reduce our cost base,'' declared Sir David.
This is likely to include operational cutbacks. The group has already
quit non-sterling bond markets and withdrawals from other areas could
follow. Closing the Japanese presence could save a lot.
General staff cuts would only accentuate the loss of morale and the
haemorrhaging of prized staff. The first step Mr Scholey has taken is to
appoint an investment banking executive committee, which observers
consider is the return of the old guard.
Several new directors have joined the board and more will join at the
annual meeting in June, when a number will retire in the normal course
of events.
Lord Cairns is in line for a large payoff, though not as much as his
last #1.5m pay cheque might suggest as #877,000 of this was
performance-related bonuses.
Warburg put out a reassuring statement proudly listing its
achievements, notably its leading position in the league table of
takeover advisers. But its current problems will quickly undermine its
reputation so Sir David will have to act swiftly to improve morale,
though Lord Cairns' departure may help in this.
Decisions will also be required on longer-term strategy as the group
is clearly not going to establish leading international positions on its
own.
Without a clear sense of direction the group will be even more
vulnerable to a bid, though Sir David said they were not in merger talks
with anyone. Whether he can provide the leadership that Warburg is
crying out for remains to be seen.

SPECULATION increased yesterday that the Fosters brewing group is
close to a decision on whether it will sell its Courage subsidiary in
the UK to Scottish &amp; Newcastle or else float it off as a wholly separate
company.
That was after Fosters chief executive Ted Kunkel said in Melbourne
that the Australian parent acknowledged that something had to be done
and that it had to get a resolution to its in-going involvement in the
UK. He added that he had nothing to say at present but Fosters knew the
market extremely well and also the strategic options.
However, nothing will be done until the Office of Fair Trading
completes its newly started investigation into the pricing differentials
between supplies to tenants and the free trade of up to #100 a barrel.
That should take no more than three months.
Courage increased net profits last year by 17% to A$118m (#56m) but
by24% in sterling terms.
It has increased market share with volumes rising by 2.4%.
Overall, Fosters' net profits after tax fell 3% to A$203m in the six
months to December. Courage is one of the most aggressive players in
both the free trade and the supermarket off-licence sectors. Its
supplying of pub companies is one of its major growth points.
It has a market share of about 18% compared with S&amp;N's 13%. Scottish
and Newcastle has a target of an overall UK penetration of 20%. The
Edinburgh-based company would be prevented by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission from buying the whole of Courage.
However, there has been persistent talk that either Whitbread and
possibly Allied Domecq could take a proportion of the Courage operations
to leave three companies with a market share of about 20% and strong
enough to fight Bass at 23%.
Paradoxically this is the reverse of the position when Fosters as part
of Elders tried to buy S&amp;N but was seen off by the MMC.
A flotation is complicated by the complex relationship with Grand
Metropolitan on the joint ownership of the Inntrepreneur Estates chain
of 6000 pubs. There is the issue of how many of these will become untied
from Courage as the supplier in the event of a sale.
But anything between 2500 and 4500 may be freed which would depress
brewers margins as pub owners could buy where they wished and also give
further opportunities to the pub companies. Overall, the industry would
prefer a break-up of Courage. S&amp;N would benefit from taking over some of
Courage's assets by having a much greater exposure to the south of
England.

SEAN O'CASEY's drama about the Easter 1916 Dublin uprising is a
fascinating play.
It manages at once to be specific and universal, to be a comedy and a
tragedy, to engage in complex political dialogues and yet maintain the
form of robust popular theatre, and to embrace not only the intimacy of
a tender love scene but also the broad social picture of a nation at war
with itself.
Aided by the vibrancy and loquacity of the Irish idiom, O'Casey's
language dazzled without ever seeming erudite, his colourful insults
stingingly hilarious, his prose poetically phrased and his arguments
dynamic and quick-witted.
The play focuses on the great conflict of church, nationalism, and
socialism that erupted in the Easter uprising and proceeded to dog Irish
politics from then on, and yet it appears as much to be a character
drama of tenement life.
For a contemporary Scottish audience it still has important things to
say about the romantic lure of nationalism and the headstrong rush
towards freedom at any price.
Joe Dowling's Irish production is an assured and vigorous
interpretation, handling the clatter and bustle of a cramped
working-class home at its most frenetic with the same control as the few
scenes of quiet repose.
Standing out in a forceful ensemble are Anita Reeves as Mrs Gogan,
mischievous more than malicious but always treading a thin line between
being loathesome and lovable, and Antoine Byrne, who gives a devastating
performance as Nora Clitheroe, robbed of her baby, her husband, and her
sanity.
The strength of the production lies in its celebration of life; the
tragedy of the play is in the slow but steady encroachment of death.

I HAVE a simple question for Ian Lang. Name one government in history
-- capitalist or communist, feudal even -- which has raised taxes or
allocated resources on a strict and consistent per capita basis?
In his Sunday TV interview, the Scottish Secretary put a sky-high
price on home rule. An extra 19p in the pound on the basic rate of
income tax, to be precise. That, argues Mr Lang, would be the cost of
replacing Scotland's present disproportionately generous share of UK
Government spending, were we ever to get our own parliament in
Edinburgh.
Setting himself up as the only effective defender of Whitehall
largesse, the Scottish Secretary paints a stark vision of a future
British Chancellor treating the creation of a devolved parliament in
Edinburgh as his opportunity to cut back Scotland's bean allocation to a
strict skull count. ''We would be powerless to stop him'', wails our man
in the Cabinet.
Suffering, as I suspect many Scots do, a mounting sense of ennui as
our constitutional options are re-rehearsed for the umpteenth time, I am
not about to get into an abstruse debate about the validity of Mr Lang's
sums. Who puts what into the UK pot, and who takes what out and why, are
devilishly complex questions. Deciding what share 8.8% of the UK
population occupying a third of the UK land mass really deserve is just
as big a teaser, especially when you start factoring in demographic,
social and other complex considerations.
But I do want to challenge the basic assumption which underpins Ian
Lang's blatant scaremongering. In matters fiscal, ''everyone contributes
the same, everyone gets the same back'' is not a principle which has
ever held sway in the capitalist west. Old-style communist regimes paid
lip service to the latter half of the equation. But, as we now know,
even that egalitarian veneer was a cruel facade.
Governments of every hue have eschewed the equal shares approach to
raising revenue and to spending it again for one very simple reason. If
that was all that governments did, what would be the point of electing
them in the first place? Governments, even those which want to cut back
the role of the state and champion market solutions, must believe they
bring some added value to the process of taxing and spending, otherwise
Ministers and MPs would all pack up their bags and go back to insurance
broking or wherever else they came.
Suppose the preliminary conditions for Mr Lang's bleak vision were to
come about. Scotland has its parliament. Under what conditions would an
incoming UK administration propose a strictly per capita funding
settlement for Scotland?
That administration would have to be hostile to devolution and,
presumably, passionate in its support for the Union. On current form,
that means it would be Tory. It might claim to be responding to popular
pressure in the south. It certainly couldn't claim historical precedent.
But, if a future British (and Tory) Chancellor did lop the best part of
#3000m from Scotland's public expenditure budget, the end result is
obvious.
Constitutional mayhem, precipitating the sudden end of the very Union
that party claims to cherish. It doesn't sound like practical politics
to me. But, why bother about that if your main aim is to get a
discordant soundbite into someone else's great debate.
When he's finished scaring the pants off Scots on what home rule will
cost them, Mr Lang might turn his attention to another tax and spending
issue, in my view even more important than what fiscal settlement a
future Scottish parliament might expect.
Last week the Joseph Rowntree Foundation published the results of its
major inquiry into income and wealth in Britain. The main findings --
identifying a deepening divide between rich and poor in Britain in the
1980s, with income inequality reaching a post-war record -- have
received extensive coverage. But the underlying issues raised take us
back to the fundamental question of what added value governments bring
to the process of taxing us and spending our money.
Throughout the 1980s, the Thatcherite objective was to tax less, spend
less, and spend it more effectively. It didn't quite work out that way.
We pay less income tax. But more on VAT and National Insurance. The
Major Government still struggles to keep its total spending in check.
But in the process, as the Rowntree inquiry shows, a lot of people have
still been badly hurt. The poorest 20% to 30%, it warns, are not
benefiting from rising national prosperity.
A core part of that eighties agenda was to liberate and reward
individual enterprise. In the most dramatic instances -- the boardrooms
of recently privatised utilities inevitably spring to mind -- the
strategy has been spectacularly successful.
But there is a price. As Howard Davies of the CBI, a member of the
Rowntree inquiry, was pointing out last week, an emerging underclass,
disenfranchised from economic prosperity, is going to cost the rest of
us more and more, through benefits, the health service, and the criminal
justice system.
We could, of course, adopt the American approach, crack down on
welfare spending, consign the underclass back to the ghettos and, as
they do in cities like Houston, protect our own prosperity behind razor
wire security fences and restricted-access shopping malls.
The Rowntree inquiry team, including Davies, argues for a more
civilised alternative, targeting future tax cuts on the lower paid and
investing in a package of measures to raise living standards among the
poorest. That is not the Major Government's agenda. It still plans
pre-election tax cuts for the haves and a tougher line on benefit
claimants and other have nots.
The alternatives could not be more stark. They deserve a great debate
of their own. But neither answer, Mr Lang may care to note, owes
anything to equal shares all round.

MISYS has made an agreed #202m bid for fellow computer software
supplier ACT which will lead to the formation of a worldscale British
company with a substantial share of the global market for banking
technology.
Chairman Kevin Lomax said yesterday that part of the reason for the
proposed merger was the high cost of research and development which
accounts for about 12% of Misys turnover, or about #10m a year.
Misys shares plunged 49p to 360p while ACT, the former Apricot
Computers, leapt 31[1/2]p to 108p. The offer of 300p cash and 2.2 Misys
shares for every 10m ACT values each ACT at 109p.
The Misys share price fall is partly because ACT shareholders will end
up with 45% of the enlarged company.
Misys saw interim pre-tax profits improve 40% to #11.25m while at the
end of November, it had #35m net cash. After the takeover, there will be
debt of between #30m to #35m although interest will be covered over 20
times by profits.
The deal is not totally unexpected as there were discussuoins two
years ago although it was soon discovered that both the timing and the
values put on ACT were not right.
However, talks resumed last month after ACT had issued a profits
warning that the year's outcome would be considerably below market
expectations.
Its chairman Roger Foster welcomed the proposed merger and said he was
keen that the company would remain British.
He is remaining as a consultant for the next year although all other
ACT dirctors are leaving and their service contracts will be honoured as
will share options which could cost altogether over #3m.
Mr Lomax explained that ACT had allowed profit projections to get too
far ahead under previous management which had affected its research and
development programme as the company was forced to pay out too high a
dividend. ACT shareholder income will fall by a quarter after the
takeover. He added that if he had his way, Misys would not pay any
dividend as is the pattern for American technology stocks but that would
not be appropriate in Britain.

AVERAGING around one acquisition a month for the past year, Stakis
yesterday announced its latest deal -- the #1.5m cash purchase of two
casinos in Bournemouth.
The Glasgow-based group, which is now concentrating on its hotel and
casino interests, will take over the businesses of the Norfolk Casino
and Victory Sporting Club subject to the granting a new gaming licences.
They were previously owned by Hamblin Leisure Services.
The clubs will be amalgamated and installed in the recently purchased
Stakis Bournemouth Hotel, bought only four months ago for #7.6m as part
the group's aggressive expansion plan. The latest purchases take the
group's spending -- mainly on hotels -- to around #45m in the past year.
Refurbishment of the seafront hotel is currently underway and the
integration of the casino is not expected to be completed before May
next year and the cost will total around #1m.
Most of the 97 casino staff will be retained and some new jobs are
likely to be created with the expansion of the bar and restaurant area.
''This is a unique opportunity for Stakis to create an attractive new
and much larger casino designed to meet the more discerning needs of our
customers,'' chief executive David Michels said.
Mr Michels and outgoing chairman Lewis Robertson have been the
architects behind the revival in fortunes of Stakis which was on the
brink of collapse only two years ago with debts of almost #200m and
losses of #45m.
They decided to hive off the nursing homes, bars and steakhouse
businesses to concentrate on the hotel and casino side. Their efforts
appear to have paid off with latest profits almost doubling to #20.2m.
Stakis now has 38 hotels and 23 casinos throughout the UK. Two weeks
ago it bought the Westpoint Hotel on the outskirts of East Kilbride in a
#4.7m deal.

INVESTMENT capital group 3i yesterday launched an initiative to help
the major companies of tomorrow develop.
Drawing on the experience of 30 of the top performers in its
portfolio, 3i has coined the term ''emerging businesses''to describe
those firms which have major growth potential.
Published yesterday, the group's research paper, ''Emerging
Businesses: The Ingredients for Success?'', concludes that these
companies have innovative products or services, principally in new or
rapidly changing markets such as multimedia.
Key pointers to success include an experienced management team which
can tackle the inevitable crises and the signing up of at least one
significant customer prior to launch.
Willie Watt, a director at 3i's Glasgow office, said the current stage
in the Scottish economic cycle suggested the time was right to invest in
young businesses.
He added: ''We need to increase understanding of the factors that make
for business success if we are to invest in those companies and sectors
which are set to grow in stature to make a significant impact on the
future development of the UK economy.''
The Glasgow office of 3i expects to have invested #5m in 10 emerging
Scottish businesses by the end of its current financial year.

GIVEN the day it is, this is probably as good a time as any to bash
out a bit of a sermon on passion, power, and broken promises.
Valentines, no matter how great their cumulative posting, are the very
least of love mail. In the realm of amour it is the slings and arrows of
vendettas which are aimed with most velocity.
''He took my genuine antique antelope luggage,'' cries the latest
Cindy seeking a multi-billion settlement. ''Cool it, baby,'' soothes her
attorney. ''After we've finished with your ex, he won't be able to
afford a paper bag.'' This is tame stuff compared to the fury burning
inside the cast-off heart of a clandestine affair. What is never
conclusively explained, however, is why so many eminent men risk losing
the very power they sought so determinedly, by luring scandal to their
door.
Does egomania persuade the clever Lothario that having achieved much
he can now get away with anything? Or is illicit liaison the last
remaining thrill, the challenge to joust with self-destruction?
Gladstone once declared that of the 11 British Prime Ministers he had
known, seven to his personal knowledge were adulterers. The American
writer Gore Vidal has also observed that the public figure who does not
wish to have affairs seems to him an unnatural master, and he
substantiates his argument by pointing to a former First Lady's groomed
tolerance for her husband's peccadilloes:
''Lyndon was a people lover,'' recalled Ladybird Johnson. ''He was not
going to exempt half the population, which is female, from his love.''
But does such an appetite for passion make for a more profound or
perceptive leader? The Kennedy men excused their womanising as an
example of their understanding of human frailty. Bill Clinton employed a
similar defence during his presidential campaign, and while it swung him
some votes in the election, it is now perceived as one more exampleof
the man's disastrous judgment, because so much else about his White
House tenure is at fault.
Henry Kissinger mused that power is the most potent aphrodisiac. Deep
in their hungry souls few influential figures might disagree, although
not too many would concede the point so brazenly. At the time of his
remark, though, pictures of a napalmed Vietnam were entering the world's
sitting-room. Kissinger was at the height of his shuttle diplomacy and
in bizarre contrast, his stop-overs in Paris had earned him the
reputation of a lady's man. The social life of the preening Right Bank
had obviously offered relief from the flying doctor's war-and-peace
manoeuvres, but maybe Kissinger's definition of power in sexual terms
was also a subconscious explanation of how a dumpy man in a too-tight
suit, with lugubrious features and the most monotonous baritone in
history, could be classed as one of the great seducers of the age.
For those who spin around such figures, the fact of being close to the
momentum of crucial events is an addictive drama in itself. The chosen,
be they paramour or cleaner, may not wish to sway events, or even spill
the beans on what they know. They are simply intoxicated by the chance
to watch the full panoply of power from the wings. But in the case of
secret love what happens when the passion turns rancid?
There is a woman in Paris who makes a tidy living from selling
mutinous tokens to jilted victims out to unnerve their former beaux.
Thirteen unlucky dead roses bedececked in mourning ribbons, a broken
mirror, a box of rotting fish, a jacket and trousers disgustingly
stained . . . these are the black Valentines dispatched by a modern
witch. On behalf of others she sends them anonymously to errant spouses,
serial gropers, finagling lawyers, and those generally obnoxious people
who suddenly decide their partners are dispensable. If love sends us all
slightly potty, here is more dark evidence that rejection renders some
spasmodically insane.
But for women, the wisest reflection on sex, power, and retribution
still belongs to the late Rebecca West whose essay on the trial of
Stephen Ward referred to John Profumo's confusion about the actual dates
of his relationship with a call-girl called Christine Keeler.
''He could not, in March 1963, remember whether an affair he had
enjoyed in 1961 with an exceptionally beautiful girl had lasted one
month or six.''
Such shameful forgetfulness, Dame Rebecca insisted, should be
instilled in the minds of all girls beyond the age of 12, as a vital
lesson in their education.

ADVERTISING giant Saatchi &amp; Saatchi yesterday failed in a High Court
attempt to stop ousted chairman Maurice Saatchi setting up a rival
agency with his brother Charles and three of the group's senior
executives.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi had agreed that there was nothing to stop Maurice
Saatchi going into competition but argued that the three executives
broke their employment contracts by signing an agreement to join his new
firm in the near future and by allowing him to act in their interests in
the meantime.
But Mr Justice Jonathan Parker said the company, in seeking
injunctions against the three, was trying to obtain court orders ''by
the back door'' to prevent Mr Saatchi from going into competition.

PREPARE for a deluge of words about Glasgow. The first 220,000-word
instalment of a three-volume of a history of the city is about to land
with a thump upon the lieges.
''Almost 90% of the material in the book is new information,'' says
Professor Tom Devine of Strathclyde University, co-editor of the History
of Glasgow. And, although the book is primarily aimed at academics and
students, it is not entirely dry and statistical.
He is not wrong. A speed-read at the first 10 centuries of Glasgow
life according to Prof Devine and his team of fellow writers reveals a
number of intriguing scenarios:
* The year is 1674 and the citizens are concerned about the state of
local government. Provost John Bell stands accused of ''pulling people
in off the streets and making them councillors. His corruption became a
byword,'' says Gordon Jackson, a reader in economic history at
Strathclyde and author of this particular section of the book.
* Events in the year 1696 may be familiar to citizens who recall the
edict last year by city boss Pat Lally ordering a clean-up of Glasgow's
streets. Almost 300 years ago, Lally's predecessors felt obliged to
promulgate the Statute of Nastiness to deal with ''the growing
filthiness of the place''.
* We move on to 1721 to find a curfew on places of entertainment.
After an unspecified but obviously unacceptable incident at a social
event at the Glasgow Grammar School, the council orders a ban on
''public balls, shows, comedies, and other plays or diversions.'' Even
worse is the ''shutting of taverns at 10pm'' and, for good measure, the
closure of a brothel or two.
It appeared that the city's captains of commerce and industry are not
leading the lower orders by example: ''In the early 18th century, hard
drinking was the preferred recreation for the younger merchants and
tavern gossip rather than intellectual debate was their favourite
pursuit.''
* We fast-forward to 1819 to find a debate in the letters page of the
Glasgow Herald on the subject of water privatisation. A correspondent
declares that the council ''being the natural guardians of the interests
of the community should be given the power to operate their own water
enterprise in the hope that this would reduce costs to the consumer''.
Much of the above sounds awful familiar but thankfully not the Ladle
Tax. This gave the bailies the right to open any sack of grain brought
into the city and help themselves to a ladleful. The same concept was
then applied to supplies of milk, meat, fish, eggs, and potatoes.
Can you imagine how much damage your average present-day Glasgow
bailie could do with his ladle in Safeway?
Seeing the light
HEARD at an Ayrshire Burns Supper: ''Shoplifting has got so bad in
Saltcoats that up at the chapel they've had to put in a new confessional
for eight items or less.''
Brief encounter
THERE is nothing worse, from the point of view of accused persons and
those who represent them, than an alert sheriff.
Sheriff Ronnie Watson was dealing at Ayr Sheriff Court with a felon
who had been caught stealing handbags from cars in the town. The defence
agent made an impassioned plea for leniency noting that a co-accused had
been dealt with earlier by way of a fine and compensation order.
The hapless brief said that the court records showed his client's
fellow recidivist had lodged the necessary monies with his solicitor and
that his man sought the same opportunity to make amends.
Sheriff Watson pointed out that there was a slight problem with this
line of argument. ''If you read on you will find that the notes he
lodged were forged.'' No such opportunity for the second bagman, he got
six months in the jail.
Gloss finish
IT seems such a shame that the Royal Air Force should lose a leader
who bears the initials RAF. We speak of Sir Sandy Wilson (proper first
names Ronald Andrew Fellowes) who lost his job as air chief marshal
after it was revealed that the redecoration of his RAF tied cottage went
a bit above budget. Yes, we know that #400,000 represents a lot of
anaglypta and emulsion, but bear in mind that among Sir Sandy's
positions is membership of the City of London's Worshipful Company of
Skinners.
Sand boys
THE ways and means of the General and Municipal union continue to
baffle simple souls like the Diary. The GMB is a stickler for
discipline. Shop stewards deviate from the rule book at their peril.
But what is this we hear of a meeting convened technically outwith the
rules last Saturday when 40 or so leading members of the GMB met at
Partick Burgh Halls. Main item on the agenda was to choose who should be
put forward as delegates to the union's annual conference in Brighton in
June.
By one of those coincidences, many of the 43 names which were selected
were those of brothers present at the meeting. This annual assembly,
being on the clandestine side, has no official title. Those in the know
refer to it as a meeting of ''the pail and spade brigade''.
Piece of cheek
A HANDBILL for the play Ubu at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh,
arrives too late for the Diary to give it a plug. But not too late to
notice that it features an all-too-clear colour snap of an actor showing
his bare backside. We see also that the production is sponsored by the
Baring Foundation.
Topping idea
THE Loch Fyne Oyster Bar at Ardkinglas in Argyll has a special St
Valentine's Day offer for lovers. Their oysters, famed for their
aphrodisiacal powers, will be available supercharged with topping
imported from Hong Kong.
The extra ingredient from the orient, where they take turbo-sex
stimulants seriously, is a form of crystallised ginseng. ''Our Hong Kong
agent also suggested a powder made from the sexual organ of the tiger
but it's an endangered species,'' said Andy Lane of the Loch Fyne
company.
''Do the oysters -- at #4.90 for half-a-dozen -- come with a
guarantee?'' we asked. ''If any one of the six oysters doesn't work,
we'll replace it,'' he said.
BLAME Mr David Allison of Kilwinning for the above rude receipt from a
local bookshop. No, blame John Menzies for it was they who choose thus
to abbreviate a perfectly acceptable little tome called Animals of
Farthing Wood.

KINGFISHER astounded the City yesterday when it fired its public image
maker, corporate affairs director Nigel Whittaker accompanied by group
development director Tim Breene.
The departures indicate a further deepening of the crisis within
Kingfisher revealed late last month with chief executive Alan Smith
leaving the company just two years after joining from Marks &amp; Spencer.
As part of a major board shake-up chairman Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy
succeeded him as chief executive and Slough Estates chairman and
Kingfisher deputy chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs took over the chairmanship
until a replacement could be found.
Also leaving is James Kerr-Muir, the finance director who is going in
April, partly because he was supposed to be unable to develop a good
relationship with the City. He finishes at the end of April.
In a brief statement yesterday, the Woolworth, B&amp;Q, Comet and
Superdrug group said that following the completion of a review it is
devolving more responsibility to operating companies and significantly
reducing the size of its corporate headquarters. That means that 40 out
of 100 positions will be redeployed or eliminated.
In both cases, there are no longer appropriate roles for the departing
directors.
Both are on three year rolling contracts but it is unlikely they will
receive the full nominal amounts. Mr Whittaker is one of the two
Kingfisher directors in the #410,00 to #500,000 range in last year's
accounts. The other is Mr James Kerr-Muir.
Mr Whittaker with his share options should be able to look forward to
a compensation package of around #1.25m.
A keen marathon runner in both London and New York, Mr Whittaker
joined the then Woolworth in 1982 when Charterhouse Bank under Victor
Blank paid the US parent #310m for its British subsidiary. He is a
barrister and as the then lawyer for British Sugar came into contact
with Mulcahy who was finance director under the late John Beckett who
led the Woolworth buyout.
Over the years, he has appeared as both the engaging front man for the
company and until recently chairman of the CBI Distributive Trades
Survey Panel as well as being frequently on radio and on panel games.
In contrast, to strangers Mulcahy is apparently withdrawn but amusing
and friendly once the acquaintance has been made. A common perception
was that both men were good friends and worked together closely as a
team.
A spokesman said that the changes began in September when two
directors from the operating companies were appointed to the board. Sir
Geoffrey will now be surrounded by four operating directors.
A leading fund manager who has followed the company for many years was
highly critical last night. He said ''The man who is doing this should
be going. Mulcahy has been asleep.''
He asked ''What has Woolworths got going for it? Comet is finished.
They could float the B&amp;Q D-I-Y side and Superdrug. Mulcahy has a lot to
answer for.''
Broker estimates put the group break-up value at between 550p and 600p
a share -- compared with last night's 426p. However that of the Comet
subsidiary is open to question after its dismal Christmas trading result
with like-for-like sales down 11% although possibly helped in the future
by the current death throes of the Rumberlows competitor where the Thorn
EMI parent has slit its throat.

ON Friday last Tony Blair flew a kite. It was a policy kite, in tune
with Labour's present striptease strategy; a titillating glimpse of what
the Opposition hope to do when they attain power. For a moment it
fluttered. It was a little kite, and he must have been flying it down by
Islington or some other remote part of Britain, because I saw only a
brief note of it in the papers, and it would have plunged like a lead
balloon over some really happy part of socialist Scotland, like
Drumchapel.
Bluntly, it was a tax-break for nannies. Or rather, them that has the
bawbees to employ nannies, or a child-care service that lets mummy go
out to work. For many years, since the time of nice Mr Attlee, no-one
has been able to claim the cost of domestic servants against tax. Now Mr
Blair proposes to change an aspect of this. When the Pink Dawn comes,
and he and his cronies take Whitehall, he hopes rapidly to amend affairs
so that ''powerful women'' -- the very words he used -- will gain
cheaper nannies.
The Tory Party, Blair said, still harbours many with primitive views
on women in the work-place. He hopes to outflank them. And, with cheap
nannies dancing temptingly about the People's Flag, all those powerful
women will abandon the primitive Tories and come running to vote Labour.
Well! Mr Blair is evidently fond of nannies. Not to mention powerful
women. Delicious possibilities open up for the psychologist's thesis.
Perhaps he remains haunted by Mrs Thatcher, who nannied us all for 11
long years. Perhaps, long ago, Mr Blair had a nannie himself. Maybe she
lives yet, an old, retired, but devoted family retainer, clucking away
in some grace-and-favour maisonette and following his career in the
papers.
No doubt he lisped at her knee as a tiny child, saying that when he
grew up he would be a socialist. Perhaps nightly, year upon year, she
put little Blair to bed with a dummy-teat dipped in rosehip syrup. It
would certainly explain why his teeth are welded together when he talks.
Enough of this frivolity. Let us take a cold hard look at this latest
policy initiative from the left.
It has one remarkable feature: the leader of an avowedly socialist
party is offering a tax break. Now there is something to be said for
that. Contrary to Tory propaganda, the tax-burden on the British has
never been higher. Swingeing cuts on income tax -- the fairest, most
efficient way of supporting the public treasury -- have been achieved by
hikes on indirect taxation. These are unjust impositions. They are
regressive: they weigh most heavily on the poor.
An excellent case could be made for cutting the overall tax burden --
by, say, binning the ludicrous Trident -- and raising income tax to
healthier levels while slashing VAT. This would be much fairer. It would
save us all a good deal of money. It would also put a just burden on the
very wealthy.
But this proposal is entirely different. This proposal helps the rich
while the masses pay. It is aimed at successful couples, both in good
careers, who want the children off their hands. Hence they need nannies.
Nannies are expensive. Mr Blair wants to make it cheaper. The money lost
in this tax break would be fleeced from the rest of us.
This is wrong. But enough of fiscal things. Consider this. Mr Blair
evidently thinks working mothers are a Good Thing.
Well, he would, of course; Mrs Blair is a barrister. But Mr Blair is
wrong. There is mounting evidence that the proliferation of working
mothers is a social evil, and any policy promoting it is wicked.
In the first place, it insults the mothers who do not work. There are
plenty of them about. I know wonderful, clever, resourceful, gifted
women who have left the work-place for a few years to raise their
families. I grow tired of hearing such belittled and devalued. I weary
of the insidious propaganda telling them they lead inadequate,
unfulfilling lives. ''Oh, me?'' she says apologetically, ''I'm just a
wife and mother . . .''
But she is raising children. She is daily imprinting and moulding
precious posterity. She makes home a safe base, a refuge, a place of
unfailing stability and love. She surrounds children in psychological
security. For she has that magic link: the umbilical cord. It is not a
parent-child bond. It is a mother-child bond. Children need mother. No
nannie, no daycare centre can take her place.
What are children taught when both parents are out all day working?
They are taught that they are not important. They are accessories,
possessions, achievements. Consumerism is all there is to life; money is
all that matters.
In the second place, Blair's tempting kite upholds a myth that is
destroying women's lives. It insists that she can -- should --
simultaneously raise children and pursue a full ambitious career.
Few women -- few men -- are capable of this. To work full-time, and
enjoy your children, and tend to the house and garden, and lead an
active social life, and pursue private fulfilling interests? It is a
one-way ticket to the funny farm. Few who try do well in any of these
fields -- far less all of them -- and many women find themselves in a
desperate existence of exhaustion and worry.
In the third place -- and we have been down this road before -- there
is an undeniable link between the increase of women in the work-place
and the rise in male unemployment. Now a gifted, unemployed single woman
is as much a human tragedy as a gifted, unemployed single man. But it is
palpably unfair that thousands of British homes should enjoy two incomes
when thousands of others enjoy no income at all.
In the fourth place, there is the hurt to children themselves.
''Quality time'' is a pernicious American myth. One concentrated hour of
parental attention is no substitute for simply spending the day in the
company of your mother. Children without that are loveless children.
Loveless children are tempted to futile, silly, or dangerous things.
Sometimes, as wee James Bulger found out, they do evil things.
The traditional household can have its faults. Too many wives lack
full support from their husbands. Men should do a fair share of the
housework; fathers should spend more time with their weans. But the
traditional model works. It is the bedrock of the family unit, the
principal antidote to crime, the factory of civic virtue, the
cornerstone of community.
There are excellent ideas Mr Blair could pursue. There are tax breaks
that could support single-income families. Housewives could be given an
allowance. (It would be far cheaper than that other ludicrous panacea,
universal nursery education.) But this proposal is bad.
Where is the radicalism in subsidising nannies? Where is the justice
in expecting society to do so? And, most of all, is there any price too
high for Mr Blair to pay in his quest for Tory votes?

We need a flexible workforce with
a positive attitude to learning
THE manufacturing infrastructure in Scotland has taken some severe
knocks over the past few weeks .
Major engineering and chemical companies with long established
histories have rationalised and cut their workforces.
Yesterday, against that pessimistic background, the possible engineers
of the future -- around 250 pupils from schools in Strathclyde Region --
gathered enthusiastically to embrace the buoyant messages delivered by
Terry Hanley, Concept Planning Manager at the Rover Group.
They had come together at the University of Paisley, the only venue in
Scotland planned for the innovative lecture called: Man, Machine and the
Market.
It was based on the prestigious Christmas lecture of the Institution
of Electrical Engineers in London two months ago.
Hanley and the Rover Group are no strangers to the university, having
been involved over the past few years in contributing to World Quality
Day events organised by Professor Will McEwan and the Quality Centre at
the University, as well as giving lectures.
Professor McEwan explained the origin of this special relationship:
''We were involved in developing the welding technology and
manufacturing process technology for Rover's Range Rover vehicle in the
early 1980s.
''Since then, several of the Group's senior personnel have visited
Paisley to lecture to our post-graduate students.''
Yesterday's Rover Lecture focused on the man/machine/market
interfaces, looking at product demand and customer choice and examining
the relationship between consumers and the market with particular regard
to the motor industry.
That relationship is inherent in Rover Group's mission to provide
extraordinary customer satisfaction throughout the entire life of the
product it supplies.
From that premise, the Lecture took the audience through the life
cycle of the product, from its earliest days as a ''bright idea''
through the styling, the models and the prototypes, to the vehicle in
service.
Throughout that evolutionary journey, the importance of the customer,
or market, is paramount, influencing every phase and step of the
developments and manifested in market research, clinics, and general
customer response to existing and previous models.
Throughout all of the processes involved in the manufacture of the
vehicle, there is this constant man/machine interface, whether it is the
stylists and their computers, the engineers and their test equipment,
the operators and their robots, or the suppliers and their transport.
Monitoring customer satisfaction continues beyond the manufacturing
stages of the product, and a further vital interface takes place with
the customer and the dealer.
To illustrate this, Hanley focused on two award-winning computer
systems which the Group has introduced: Discus and Textbook.
Discus is a computer system designed to allow customers to choose any
product and its features from a current list, view it in any colour,
access details about the feature and vehicle prices and the likely
trade-in value of the customer's exist ing vehicle.
Equally valuable is Textbook', a touch screen, interactive computer
system tailored to the needs of workshop personnel to facilitate fault
finding and diagnosis on vehicles in service.
The two initiatives were introduced to the audience, who were then
invited to participate in various demonstrations.
The overall message highlighting the importance of man's positive
relationships with new technological advances in every aspect of life
was not lost on the members of the audience, most of whom have been at
home with computers since the earliest years of their lives.
Said Professor McEwan, director of Paisley's Quality Centre: ''We are
confident the Rover lecture will have created an interest in engineering
among the school pupils who attended, and may have encouraged some of
them to consider a career in the design and manufacturing industry.''
The fact that Hanley chose to speak to school pupils came as no
surprise, since the Rover Group is committed to the industrial/education
interface, manifested through its Education Partnership Programme.
According to Hanley, education and business are mutually dependent,
neither being able to fulfil its essential role in society without the
other.
He said: ''Education partnership is a mainstream business necessity,
driven by enlightened self-interest.
''It is also a vital means by which those of us in industry and
commerce can communicate our vision, our values, and our priorities to
the next generation.
''If Britain is to compete effectively in world markets, we need a
flexible, adaptable self-motivated workforce with a positive attitude
towards lifelong learning and the continuing development of skills at
work.
''A stimulating work-related curriculum for all pupils will help
encourage and develop such positive attitudes.''

Dresden, Monday
ROYALTY, political leaders, and Allied military chiefs paid homage in
Dresden to the thousands who perished at the hands of RAF and American
bombers 50 years ago tonight.
Gathered together in a marked spirit of reconciliation, no-one
attempted to apportion blame or guilt.
However the Bishop of Coventry, the Rt Rev Simon Barrington-Ward, told
the people of Dresden that the horrific Allied raid was morally wrong.
''Hitler's war had unleashed a whirlwind into which we were swept,''
he said. ''The dynamic of war swept away our inhibitions.
''When the British and American air forces destroyed Dresden we had
suppressed our moral principles.''
German President Roman Herzog refused to further some claims that the
raids, which killed up to 35,000 people and decimated the city's
renowned baroque and Renaissance buildings, were a war crime.
''There is no doubt that it was inhuman but it makes no sense to
discuss whether it was legally right,'' he said. ''What good do such
discussions bring 50 years later?''
The day began at the memorial to the dead in a peaceful pine forest
high above the city, where dignitaries laid wreaths of commemoration.
The Duke of Kent, representing the Queen and leading the British
delegation, stood smartly to attention in front of the memorial. His
wreath bore the simple words: ''In Memoriam: February 13, 1945.''
Dignitaries then stood to one side as hundreds of local people placed
single flowers and small wreaths as tributes to relatives and friends,
who were incinerated, suffocated, and buried alive in what Germans call
the ''night of the devil's tinderbox''.
Fifty years ago, at 9.45pm tonight, the air raid sirens first sounded
across the rooftops of Dresden to warn the inhabitants of the impending
disaster.
An armada of RAF bombers carried out the first massive raid, dropping
1476 tons of high explosive and 1182 tons of incendiary bombs that
caused the destructive firestorm and ripped the city apart.
However there was also recognition today that Dresden could not be
seen in isolation from the countless other horrors and atrocities of the
Second World War.
Germany's military chief, General Klaus Naumann, sidestepped the
question about whether Germany now expected an official apology from
Britain for the raid.
''The fact His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent is here to honour the
dead is a clear indication that we are looking to the future and
reconciliation is the catchword,'' he said.
He stressed: ''You cannot talk about Dresden without talking about the
city of Coventry.''
The Lord Mayor of Coventry, Nick Nolan, who laid a wreath with
representatives of other cities twinned with Dresden, spoke of shared
grief.
''I am not apportioning blame or guilt. We were all guilty at the time
and perhaps we will not be again in the future. What we have to do is
get rid of tragedy, suffering, and war.
''In a marvellous and almost miraculous way, the fires that burned so
fiercely in Coventry and in Dresden have ignited a flame of hope in
cities and among people all over the world.''
The central commemoration ceremony in the city's concert hall was
marred by a vociferous demonstration of left-wing activists opposed to
German reunification.
They were swiftly bundled out by security guards to loud applause.

<HEADLINE>Retail sales are flat in January, says CBI</HEADLINE>

JANUARY was a disappointing month for High Street spending, according
to the Confederation of British Industry's latest Distributive Trades
Survey. Retail sales were flat in the month, below retailers
expectations, and little changed from an admittedly fairly buoyant
January of last year after a surprise fall in December, 1993. It follows
a pick up in volumes in the year to December 1994.
The official retail sales figures are out tomorrow but the CBI survey
has not always proved a reliable guide to these. James Capel has
forecast an increase of 0.3% for the month to take the year-on-year rate
down from 3.8% to 2.7%.
The CBI said the the volume of retail sales is expected to grow
moderately in the year to February. But expectations were not realised
in the year to January and have not been fully met in eight out of the
last 12 months.
The largest increases in volumes were reported by confectionery,
tobacco and newspaper shops followed by grocers. These sectors also saw
substantial sales growth in the year to December. Marked reductions in
trading were reported by specialist food retailers, such as butchers,
bakers and greengrocers, and chemists, as well as hardware, china and
DIY stores.
Sales were regarded as below average for the time of year having been
regarded as average in December. Only confectionery, tobacco and
newspaper retailers reported sales to be significantly above average,
while chemists regarded sales the most below average.
However, while High Street trading last month was weaker than
expected, the underlying three-month trend continues to indicate
moderate annual volume growth.
Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's Distributive Trades Survey
Panel, said: ''Retail sales growth has once again proved to be weaker
than retailers anticipated. The survey suggests that, on an underlying
basis, High Street trade is still growing only modestly.''
Orders placed with suppliers are expected to remain flat having fallen
in January. This reflects the fact that stock levels are expected to
remain more tha adequate in relation to projected demand.
Motor traders reported that sales fell slightly in the year to January
-- roughly as expected -- and sales for the time of year remain below
average. Orders placed with suppliers also fell, indicating that stocks
remained more than adequate in relation to expected demand. Sales are
forecast to grow slightly in the year to February but to remain below
average for the time of year.

BY the end of the decade, an estimated one in six of all office-based
employees are expected to be working from home for at least part of the
week.
Now insurers are coming up with policies tailored to the special needs
of the home-based worker.
Current basic home contents insurance cover is inadequate, whether for
an employee spending the odd day at home working on a portable computer,
or a self-employed person running a business from the spare bedroom with
computer, fax machine, mobile telephone and all the other technical
gadgetry needed to sell one's services these days.
Indeed, most home contents policies specifically exclude any property
used for business purposes in the home.
While cover may be provided by an employer for equipment such as a
laptop computer used by an employee at a client's office or at his home
or in a hotel room, those who spend most of their time working from home
need special cover.
Until now, that has meant taking out a business policy for the
equipment as well as a separate Public Liability policy.
Commercial Union, for example, offers a policy for small computer
installations in offices, covering the equipment up to the value of
#50,000 as well as #10,000 costs of re-instating data following a
hardware loss.
But the premium costs #350 to cover a less sophisticated home set-up
valued at up to #12,500 and an additional #150 is needed for Public
Liability cover, bringing a total bill of #500 a year for a modest SoHo
(Small Office Home Office) set-up.
Aware of the growing trend towards professionals working from home --
more commonly known as teleworking -- the same company is underwriting a
policy offered by specialist brokers Tolson Messenger which addresses
these problems and provides cover at a fraction of the price.
It was established two years ago when the company identified a gap in
the market between those who found standard office policies not relevant
to their needs and those who sailed on regardless, under the
misapprehension that their home contents policy covered them.
Several other companies have jumped on the same bandwagon in recent
months.
Tolson Messenger's Home-Office policy covers all office equipment in
the home such as computers, fax machines, and mobile phones on an
all-risks basis.
It also covers certain equipment such as portable computers and mobile
phones which are frequently used away from base.
The cover includes public liability indemnity up to #1m and up to
#7500 towards the increased cost of running a business following an
interruption such as a fire, as well as a free legal helpline.
Personal accident, commercial legal expenses, product liability, and
goods in transit can all be added to the policy.
Under this policy, broadly similar to CU's Small Computer Policy
mentioned earlier, the cost of covering the #12,500 home-office set-up
drops to #195 and gives the policy holder greater cover for less than
40% of the cost.

MID Wynd International Investment Trust suffered a slight setback in
the six months to December, after a sparkling performance in its
previous financial year.
Hit hard by the underperformance of smaller companies, particularly in
the UK and continental Europe, net asset value fell 3.3% to 396.9p.
During the period, the benchmark FT World index dropped only 1.3%.
The below-par performance of the Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford trust
contrasted sharply with a 13.3% rise in its NAV in the year to end-June.
Mid Wynd, a #20m capital and income growth trust which focuses on
smaller companies, raised its interim dividend by 4.0% to 2.6p and
forecast a similar increase in the final payout.
Interim earnings per share went up 34% to 4.05p but the increase in
dividend was restricted so the payout would not have to go down when
relatively large cash and bond holdings are converted back into
equities.
Mid Wynd is particularly bearish on Wall Street, with its 12.7% stake
in US equities extraordinarily low for a trust of its type.
At December 31, it had 26.5% of funds in UK equities, with 21.7% in
continental Europe, 16.7% in Pacific stock markets, 6.3% in Latin
America and 4.1% in Japanese shares. It had 4.5% in cash and 7.5% in
foreign bonds.
Although it increased its Latin American holdings by 75% during the
six months, Mid Wynd escaped the worst of the financial crisis there.
Telmex, the Mexican telecommunications stock, was the only major
casualty, with a 27.5% decline in sterling terms.

SOME conversion of equities into cash during the six months to
end-January reflects the cautious outlook of Dundee-based Second
Alliance Trust.
The #322m investment trust, which aims for capital and income growth,
raised its interim dividend by 7.7% to 14p and forecast a final dividend
above last year's 29p.
Net asset value fell 4.0% to #16.71 during the six months. UK
investments, which account for 52% of the fund, performed slightly
better than the FTSE All-Share index, which fell 4.2%.
Growth in dividends continued to be strong, with net revenue up from
just over #4m in the first six months of the trust's previous financial
year to nearly #4.5m. Interim earnings per share increased 10% to 23.1p.
Second Alliance's Far Eastern holdings, with a 9% presence, lost about
14% of their value, a performance which joint managing director Lyndon
Bolton described as ''pretty well level pegging'' with the relevant
indices.
Although the US Standard &amp; Poor's index rose slightly during the
period, dollar considerations almost cancelled out its sterling
equivalent gains. Marginal losses for the trust's US investments, which
at #76.2m accounted for almost one-quarter of funds on January 31, were
therefore broadly in line with Wall Street.
Second Alliance has 9% of its money invested in continental Europe.
Overall, sales of #16.4m during the six months outweighed purchases of
#11.1m, taking net liquid assets to #20m, or 6%, from #14m.
Mr Bolton said: ''We have got a bit more cash. That really reflects
our rather cautious stance at the moment.''
Describing the economic situation as finely balanced, he added: ''The
hope must be that the interest rate increases that we have seen, and the
ones that may lie ahead, succeed in capping the lid on inflation,
without pushing economies into a recession.''
However, the trust believes that the boom-bust scenario witnessed in
the late-1980s and early-1990s may be a thing of the past and it would
not be greatly worried by a ''normal'' downturn.
The fall in the markets in which Second Alliance is involved was not
as severe as during the six months to end-July, when its net asset value
plunged 8%.
Second Alliance believes stock market valuations now more
realistically reflect the outlook but remain demanding, with consumer
confidence still lacking and the prospect of a slowdown in corporate
earnings' growth.
Mr Bolton felt the increase in interim dividend was ''quite
encouraging'' and added: ''We wouldn't have increased the interim by
this amount if we hadn't been fairly confident about managing some
increase in the final dividend.''

Grozny, Monday
RUSSIAN and Chechen commanders agreed a ceasefire today for heavy
weapons, amid signs that President Boris Yeltsin was trying to distance
himself from the unpopular military operation in Chechnya.
The Defence Ministry in Moscow said follow-up talks later this week
would seek to broaden the truce in the Kremlin's assault on the region's
breakaway rebels.
Yeltsin, embroiled in controversy at home and abroad, planned a tough
look at the military campaign in a speech to Parliament this week,
Interfax reported.
A military spokesman said the ceasefire agreement was reached in the
Ingushi settlement of Sleptsovsk, on the border with Chechnya, after
talks between the Russian commander, Colonel-General Anatoly Kulikov,
and head of rebel forces Aslan Maskhadov.
However a senior officer said the Russian army planned to stay on in
Chechnya until its troops had crushed separatists in the towns of
Gudermes, Shali, and Argun.
He said plans to storm the cities had been already drawn up. If
independence fighters refused to leave their strongholds, he said,
''powerful air strikes'' would be launched.
It was not immediately clear what weapons would be affected by the
ceasefire. The Russian army has bombed Chechen positions from the air
and used a variety of other heavy weapons, including tanks and
artillery.
Tass, reporting from Nazran, said Kulikov had ordered Russian forces
immediately after the talks to stop using heavy weapons. However as an
Interior Ministry official it was not clear if Kulikov had authority to
issue direct orders to the Russian army.
Maskhadov told Tass he had been authorised by separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev to lead negotiations ''exclusively on military
issues''.
Moscow has repeatedly ruled out talks with Dudayev, but has said it
was ready to talk with field commanders.
It took two months for Moscow to quell Chechnya's three-year
independence bid and seize the regional capital, Grozny.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people have been killed and Russian
forces still face Chechen resistance elsewhere in the rebel region.
The peace move came as Yeltsin appeared set to distance himself from
the unpopular campaign.
A Yeltsin source said the president would make ''a critical analysis
of the military approach to the resolution of the Chechen problem'' in
his annual address to both houses of Parliament on Thursday.
This could spell trouble for Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, who bears
much of the responsibility for the military incursion in the small north
Caucasus region.--Reuter.

Miami, Monday
FLORIDA police have today defended the shooting dead of a young
British man, claiming that he lunged at officers with a machete.
Darren Brown, 21, of Kirklington Road, Southwell, Nottinghamshire, was
shot dead on Friday in the Coconut Grove area of Miami, it emerged
today.
Police spokesman Angelo Bitsis said that the incident started on
Friday morning when Mr Brown brandished the machete at officers, shouted
obscenities, and walked toward them.
When they drew their weapons and backed up, Mr Brown began threatening
passing motorists near the main intersection in the entertainment and
shopping district, and several drivers abandoned their cars.
Mr Brown then lunged at one officer and two others opened fire. Mr
Brown was hit three times and died at the scene.
Raymond Lang of Miami police said: ''We had to defend ourselves.
''This person was only two or three feet away from the officers and he
was waving a machete. Their lives were threatened. There was little they
could do.
''They continued to back off until they couldn't back off any longer .
. . but when you are waving a deadly weapon at police officers and
citizens, you run the risk of incurring injury to yourself as well.''
Another police spokesman said that Mr Brown had entered the US in
January last year on a 90-day tourist visa, and would have been
considered to have been in the country illegally.
Mr Brown went to Florida with three friends, including 22-year-old
Andy Scothern, who said today: ''It just seems insane he has been
killed.
''He has never been violent, and I can't believe what they are saying.
It's totally out of character.''
Mr Brown's family, who were too upset by their son's death to comment,
were today making arrangements to fly his body home.
A friend said that the family had received a call from an American
lawyer advising them that they may have grounds for legal action against
the Miami police.

IN ADDITION to loans, hard-pressed students are being driven to run up
overdrafts and other debts.
Student loans are a major commitment, but they are a long term form of
debt, being repaid only when students secure salaries of more than 80%
of the national average. But other debts present an immediate concern.
Rent arrears, fuel bills, and overdrafts can all be problems in the
short term. A survey at Edinburgh University showed 47% of students
having outstanding debts at the end of last session.
One student commented: ''I have to work during term to stop myself
getting into a lot of debt. I feel I can't concentrate on my studies
because of this.''
With a maximum grant and loan of #3125 -- which not all students get
-- it is hard to avoid debt. A shortfall of #1000 is estimated by some.
So the need to get a summer job is clear.
But jobs are not easy to find and are often poorly paid. Summer can
prove a time of hardship for some students.
Without supplementing their income students have #60 a week all year
round. Deducting #38 -- the average student rent in Scotland -- leaves
only #22 to buy books, clothing, study materials and food, and pay
bills.
This leads to National Union of Students claims that students are
worse off than people on income support. Yet, along with 16 and
17-year-olds, students are excluded from the benefits safety net.
In addition, students are often unaware of where to turn for help.
They need to be aware of advice services provided by consumer and
trading standards departments, universities, student unions, and
citizens advice bureaus.
Advice sought early can help to avoid later problems. General debt
advice is based on commonsense:
* DON'T borrow more than you can afford.
* TRY to budget and to make priorities about debts.
* READ the small print on credit agreements.
* BORROW only from recognised, legal lenders.
* IF you are unsure, go to someone for advice.
Ian Barr, a final year student at Strathclyde University, said:
''Student debt won't go away. But advice might make it easier to
handle.''

Johannesburg, Monday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela's estranged wife Winnie today defended her
criticism of South Africa's post-apartheid government, though she said
she never intended to insult him or to embarrass his administration.
In a carefully-worded letter to the president, Mrs Mandela said
remarks in which she accused the government of paying more attention to
appeasing minority whites than aiding blacks were intended to highlight
the grievances of most South Africans.
President Mandela, who today urged international investors to develop
a Marshall Plan-style programme to help rebuild post-apartheid South
Africa, was stung by his wife's comments. She often provokes controversy
and outrage but still has a huge following, particularly among poor
blacks.
''I was merely trying to assure the masses that the government and the
ANC are aware of and concerned about the flaws that the government must
still deal with,'' she wrote.
''The impression of the people is that we neither care nor know about
these things. I was trying to correct that perception. If in so doing I
created a different impression, that was not my intention.''
Senior African National Congress (ANC) officials said earlier they
expected Mrs Mandela to retract her remarks, but the letter stopped
short of this.
Local media reported that Mrs Mandela had been told to apologise or
resign as Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture, but ANC officials played
down the row.
''I don't think there is a serious problem. All she needs to do is
explain her unwise remarks,'' said one.
In a separate row between Mrs Mandela and members of the ANC Women's
League, which she heads, one of her critics claimed she had failed to
pass on a #93,00 donation from Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
when she attended President Mandela's inauguation last year.
Mrs Mandela's spokesman said the money was earmarked for projects in
poor black communities, and was never intended for the League.

Bordeaux, Monday
FRANCE vowed a fight to the finish today for tougher limits on the
number of Hollywood films shown on European television, warning that the
EU's film industry would otherwise go to the wall.
However Paris found many countries indifferent and Britain outrightly
hostile when it canvassed European Union (EU) states on a perceived
threat of domination by Hollywood television.
France aimed to rally culture ministers behind its view that the bloc
must protect Western Europe's cultural heritage from drowning in a flood
of US movie exports.
At a two-day ministerial meeting in the capital of the French wine
trade, Culture Minister Jacques Toubon said Europe must fight to prevent
European TV screens from being filled almost exclusively with American
products.
''I'm very optimistic if Europe will be able to follow France in its
search for a European identity, but I'm very pessimistic if Europe will
decide to surrender,'' he told reporters.
At stake is a change in European legislation.
A 1989 directive, Television without frontiers, states that member
countries have to broadcast European television programmes at least half
of the time when practicable.
France wants to make this quota obligatory and Toubon vowed he would
fight to the end to get his way.
Arguing that France was not isolated and could win waverers round, he
compared Hollywood domination to US domination of the aeronautical
industry.
''If we want Europe to exist, we have to build a stopping off point
for imports,'' he said.
The EU's culture commissioner, Marcelino Oreja, will outline a series
of options to ministers tomorrow on how to approach the issue.
Spain and Italy are in his camp and Belgium has already used the local
content argument to keep the TNT cartoon channel, a venture of American
CNN's Ted Turner, out of the country.
Britain, however, wants to scrap quotas altogether.
Writing in today's Financial Times, National Heritage Minister Stephen
Dorrell said: ''I believe that the quotas create an irreconcilable
contradiction at the heart of the directive. The best course would be to
eliminate them or phase them out.''
Germany is sitting on the fence. It awaits a ruling next month by the
Karlsruhe High Court on whether the federal government or Germany's
federated regions have authority in the matter.
''We want to be good Europeans,'' said a German diplomat. Asked
whether Germany would favour the British or French stance, he added:
''They are both worth discussing.''
The Dutch want to keep the status quo of flexible quotas and noted
that all main Europan countries adhere to the rules at the moment.
The debate will take off in earnest tomorrow when Budget and
Communications Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, widely tipped as France's next
Prime Minister, wil join the group.
Today, the ministers agreed to ask the European Commission to develop
a policy framework for the emerging multi-media industry.
''Otherwise the information superhighways of the pending Information
Society will be crowded by US and Japanese products alone,'' a French
diplomat said.
The ministers agreed to increase the Kaleidoscope and Ariane progammes
for the arts and literature.
Ireland's Michel Higgins, supported by Portugal, proposed that the Net
Book Arrangement should be enforced Europe-wide.
This rule, which exists already in many countries, says that a book
should have the same price in a big department store as in a small book
shop. In Britain, Dillons bookstores are fighting this rule.--Reuter.

THE rising tide of debt is engulfing students at Scottish
universities. Without a solution it will have grave repercussions on the
future pattern of higher education.
In particular there is a danger that opportunities in education will
be denied to those without access to the necessary financial resources.
This is contrary to the government's professed desire to open up
education to all.
It is implementing plans to shift the burden of student living costs
during term time from maintenance grant to index-linked personal loan.
But this ignores the adverse effects a life in debt can have on
students.
Ian Barr, 25, a final year economics student at Strathclyde
University, told me: ''By the time I graduate I'll owe more than #5000
in student loans and my overdraft. And I've been lucky. I've had a job
every summer and been able to pay off some of my debts.
''I wouldn't worry so much if I was sure I would get a job when I
finish, but I have friends who graduated last year and can find work
only in supermarkets and shops.''
Ian went on to suggest that worrying about debt distracted him from
his studies and caused him to think seriously about dropping out. An
Edinburgh University survey suggests this is a serious consideration
among one in seven students.
One Edinburgh student who expressed her gratitude to her understanding
parents talked of taking a year out in the middle of her degree to try
to pay off outstanding debts.
''I owed #500 to the bank and another #300 to the credit card company.
That's as well as student loans and family loans. I couldn't let that
get any higher. I had to work.''
''Now it's hard to get back to studying. I couldn't save anything and
I'll still finish my degree in debt.''
Mature students and postgraduates are worse off. Mature students often
have family and mortgage responsibilities as well as other debts.
They have less recourse to family for borrowing and meeting the
demands of higher overheads. However, they will soon not qualify to
receive a larger loan or grant than other students.
Post-graduates are forced to accept debt. Excluded from the student
loans system, facing expensive fees as well as living costs, bank loans
are often the only option.
A student myself, I was unable to get a job on graduation and to
finance further studies have had to borrow. A friend in Stirling said to
me recently: ''I've been living in debt so long now I just try to forget
about it. It just depresses me.''
She had finished her first degree with maximum student loans and a
hefty overdraft. Unable to get a graduate job, she worked as a waitress
before deciding to return to university.
''My pay didn't eat into my debt at all. And I had no prospects, so I
had to find something else. Now I have a career development loan as well
as all the rest. Hopefully I'll now get a job,'' she said.
The shortsightedness of making students run up debt is an outrage as
well as a tragedy. Many who might have considered further studies simply
cannot afford to take up the opportunity.
Gambling on getting a good job is too much for many. Instead, they
take jobs which do not fulfil their potential.
Said Alaina MacDonald, 21, a final year politics student at Glasgow
University: ''I wouldn't like to take on more debt. Borrowing again
would put me off my work and put me under too much pressure. I just
couldn't do it.''
Postgraduate students denied student loans must rely on commercial
career development loans from banks. Debt after a one year course can be
as high as #6000.
The Government funds only a very limited number of post-graduate
places. For the most, students have to borrow not only to meet their
living costs, but also to pay for their fees. And the one-year MSc in
public relations at Stirling University has fees of #2850.
If debt is to be a feature of the Government's higher education
policies it is essential that students be given better information on
the consequences of borrowing. At the moment it seems happy just to
expect students to borrow blindly and gamble on future job markets.
Given that student loans are not extended to postgraduates, and are
not adequate to live on anyway, some support in the credit minefield
might be wise.
Either the Government or the universities should provide estimates of
how much graduates with student loans will owe. Currently the Scottish
Office refuses requests to do this.
It seems highly questionable for a government that prides itself on
financial prudence to behave this way. Students cannot take
responsibility for financing their own studies when they are not
sufficiently informed about the decisions they must make.
Debt and money advice is essential if students are to avoid financial
problems. It would also seem to make sense, if the Tories' higher
education policies are to work.
Otherwise no amount of rhetoric will avoid the fact that only some
people will be able to afford university education, despite the
government's often-repeated claims of widening access.
* Alistair Smith, a politics graduate of Strathclyde University,
recently completed a one-month placement working on a student debt
campaign on behalf of Strathclyde region's consumer and trading
standards department. It was part of the MSc course in public relations
he is currently taking at Stirling University.

Jackie Stewart became the finest racing driver in the world, but just
a few short years before had been branded a stupid no-hoper. Now he is
dedicated to helping those youngsters who suffer from the same handicap
he did -- dyslexia, still too often unrecognised. He tells Gavin Bell of
the day his life was transformed.
JACKIE Stewart has total recall of the fearsome Nurburgring circuit in
Germany, the most difficult race track in the world. It is more than 20
years since he hurtled around it in pursuit of a hat-trick of world
championships, but he can still give every braking distance and every
gear shift for each of the 187 corners on the 14.7-mile course.
He cannot, however, recite the alphabet. Nor can he remember the words
of the Lord's Prayer. He cannot even memorise the four lines of the
Selkirk Grace. Addressing a black-tie dinner at Gleneagles Hotel at the
weekend, he read Burns's weel-kent verse and he got it wrong. But nobody
laughed or sniggered, because most of his audience knew why. They knew
that Stewart is a victim of dyslexia, a learning disability affecting
the capacity of otherwise bright people to master reading and writing
and to absorb some forms of information.
Those members of his audience who were not aware of his handicap were
soon enlightened by an after-dinner speech which moved several women to
tears: ''I left school at 15 years of age as a complete disaster. I had
something called dyslexia. I did not know about it, my teachers did not
know about it, my peers did not know about it, and it was little known
about by the educational authorities; and I have to tell you that my
school years were the most fearful of my life.
''I look back with pain and suffering at the memories of the abuse
that one gets when one cannot read and one cannot write in the simplest
terms. To this day I still cannot read properly. I have no speech
tonight. I have headings, because it would be a waste of my time to try
and read a speech. If you paid me $10m now I could not recite the
alphabet. I have never known it, and I cannot for the life of me today
even learn it.
''I can't even sing my own national anthem. I have stood beside Her
Majesty when it was being played and I couldn't sing it, because I
didn't know the words.''
At school in Dumbarton he was branded ''a real dud -- stupid, dumb and
thick''. And he recalled the frustration: ''When you are a young person
and you are put in that position, you suffer. It's like banging your
head against a brick wall.''
As president of the Scottish Dyslexia Trust, Stewart is resolved to
spare new generations of Scottish children the pain and humiliation
suffered by himself and both of his sons, who apparently inherited the
handicap from him. The gala ball at Gleneagles had been to celebrate the
10th anniversary of Stewart's shooting school at the hotel; but his real
target was to raise funds to place a teacher qualified to help dyslexics
in every school in Scotland. And when the weekend was over, he was
#10,000 closer to the mark.
Relaxing later in his suite with his younger son Mark, he recalled his
struggle to escape the stigma of his ''stupidity''. After leaving school
at the earliest possible opportunity at age 15, he began working in his
father's garage near Dumbarton. At first the tasks were menial, but he
took pride in making the forecourt immaculate, and for the first time in
his life he received praise. When he was promoted to the lubrication
bay, he transformed it into ''the best lube bay in the county, and
possibly in Scotland'', and the customers were impressed.
Jackie Stewart was a boy who did things well. You could rely on Jackie
Stewart to give your car a service second to none. The effect was
immediate: ''You can't imagine how important that was to me. I was
needing praise so badly.''
Within a few years, the ''backward'' child was the fastest and finest
racing driver in the world, winning 27 Grand Prix races and three world
championships; but it was not until he was 42 that he discovered why he
could barely remember the names of the mechanics on whom his life
depended.
The key was his son Mark. After only a few months at boarding school
in Switzerland, it became apparent Mark was unable to keep up with the
rest of his class. The headmaster suggested consulting an expert in
dyslexia in London, who examined the boy and duly diagnosed his
disability.
''I still had no idea what it was,'' Jackie recalls. ''I told the
professor no, he must be wrong, Mark was no different from what I was,
and he'd come out of it as I did. Then the professor tested me, and
guess what? The truth came out, and it was wonderful finally to have an
explanation for all the misery and confusion I had endured over the
years. It was like somebody had saved me from drowning.''
Mark concurs: ''It was a huge relief to me. School had been a
nightmare. Even the teachers laughed at me, I remember that
specifically, and I could do nothing about it. Now here was this guy
explaining it all to us in a laid-back way, and saying we were in good
company.'' They were indeed. Disparate figures such as Churchill and
John Wayne were dyslexic, as are Michael Heseltine, Susan Hampshire, and
King Olav of Norway.
Mark was fortunate in having a father who understood his problems and
had the financial resources to alleviate them. After graduating from an
American school dedicated to children with learning disabilities, he
tackled his handicap head-on by training as an actor with the Perth
Repertory Theatre.
Hours after other members of the company had gone off to the pub, Mark
was still at home struggling to learn his lines; but what he calls the
''have-to factor'' brought success -- in one year alone he gave 300
performances. He has since switched to television as a producer and
cameraman, with his own independent company which recently filmed a
documentary on his father for the Sky network. His elder brother Paul
has soared above his handicap by creating a highly respected motor
racing company based in Milton Keynes, which competes in three formulas.
Stewart is proud of his sons, and it shows. But he is concerned about
the fate of thousands of children who will never have their
opportunities of escaping the mental cage of their disability. It is
estimated that 4% of children suffer from dyslexia, which means possibly
one in every classroom in Scotland, yet virtually no provision is made
for them in regular schools.
''For every one who is properly diagnosed and helped, how many are
left cowering in corners?'' Stewart says. ''How many try to live in a
rainbow of alcohol, or ride a magic carpet of drugs, and end up in a
life of crime because society isn't giving them a hand?
''Our aim is to put somebody to help them in every school in Scotland,
no matter how small. If we can do that, we will give young people the
possibility to reach their true potential, and there is nothing worse in
the world than robbing someone of their potential. There are stars out
there, there is brilliance out there, being suffocated by ignorance and
lack of resources.''
To illustrate the point, he mentions the name of a distinguished
figure who suffered from dyslexia and did relatively well in his
profession. The name is Einstein.

<HEADLINE>Woman 'appalled' at treatment of mother</HEADLINE>

A WOMAN alleged yesterday that her mother suffered an ''appalling lack
of care'' before she died in a Glasgow hospital.
Miss Jean Porter, 56, listed her grievances at a fatal accident
inquiry into her mother's death.
She complained that her mother:
* Was left lying on a trolley for four hours on arriving at the
accident and emergency unit because it was a holiday weekend.
* Was not given the correct liquid drip or a blood transfusion.
Miss Porter said she believed her mother should have been operated on
sooner because her arm was swollen and ''ready to burst'', and claimed
that a drip ran dry five times.
She also alleged that nurses ignored her own concerns about her
mother's treatment.
Miss Porter said: ''I was appalled by her lack of care and I later
asked the fiscal for an inquiry into her death.''
The inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court heard how sprightly Mrs May
Porter, 88, bled to death in the city's Gartnavel General Hospital in
October l993.
She died three days after undergoing an operation for a blockage to
her small bowel and 11 days after being taken into hospital.
Pathologist Marie Cassidy, 39, told the hearing that a surgeon's
stitches surrounding a mass of small blood-vessels burst after the
operation.
Dr Cassidy said Miss Porter's mother, of Hermitage Avenue,
Knightswood, Glasgow, bled slowly to death and that it was
''unfortunate'' that the bleeding had not been discovered.
Miss Porter said that after her mother was transferred to Gartnavel,
she found her ''lying distraught across her bed''. She said: ''My mother
was an active, alert, and strong woman. I was finally asked to agree
that her life-support machine be switched off.''
The hearing before, Sheriff James Jardine, continues.

A DETECTIVE told the Bonnyrigg murder trial that he thought two shots
fired at him from a getaway car as he grappled with an armed man were
blanks.
Seconds later, however, 63-year-old retired mining engineer Mr David
Dunn lay dying from a chest wound after two more shots rang out from the
car.
Detective Constable John Duffy, 42, of Lothian and Borders Police,
told the High Court in Edinburgh that the shots from the car were fired
by a man resembling one accused, Mr Robert Smith.
He was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Smith, 33, Mr Gerald
McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland, 25, who deny murdering Mr Dunn in
Polton Street car park, Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on October 19 last year.
They also deny attempting to murder DC Duffy and two other men, John
Girdler and Duncan Milliken, in the car park on the same day. All three
are also charged with stealing #185,000 from the Bank of Scotland in
High Street, Bonnyrigg, moments earlier.
DC Duffy said he was off-duty on the day of the robbery. He was
speaking to ''Spike'' Milliken when he saw two men come out of the Bank
of Scotland and run towards him.
He then chased the two men into Polton Street car park, where they ran
towards a grey Ford Granada which had its engine running. One of the men
got into the car, but as the second man opened the door DC Duffy kicked
it shut and started to struggle with him.
''He produced a gun. It was a revolver. He brought it up and fired at
me. He aimed it at my body. I thought it wasn't as loud as it should
have been. I thought it was a blank. I started struggling with him
again. I tried to get a grip of him in a bear hug.''
The man raised the gun up again and fired again. By this time DC Duffy
had managed to get hold of the gun and was holding it down and away from
himself.
''It was the same sound as before. Again I thought it's not as loud as
it should be. It's blanks.'' He managed to get the man on the ground,
knock the gun from his grasp, and push it away.
By this time, Mr Girdler and Mr Milliken had arrived on the scene and
ripped off a stocking-mask from the man on the ground. DC Duffy
identified the man as Mr McQuade.
There were still two men in the Granada, the driver and someone in the
back.
The rear offside door of the Granada opened. ''An arm and a head
appeared and another gun was produced, a semi-automatic pistol. It was
fired twice at myself, Girdler, Milliken and the man we had on the
ground. Again, it wasn't the sound I would have expected. It was quieter
than normal.
''I said to Milliken I thought it was blanks. Could he go and get the
person.'' Mr Milliken opened the driver's door, reached in, pulled out
the ignition key and threw it away.
Mr Milliken then pulled the driver out and held him on the ground. He
was not masked and DC Duffy identified him as Mr Bootland. He was not
the man who fired the shots from the car.
A semi-automatic pistol was found on the ground near where Mr Bootland
had been held.
DC Duffy said that the third man was still in the car and had moved
towards the front.
''An old man ran up to the front passenger door. He had a shopping
carrier-bag. I saw him reach in, bending down into the vehicle. He
appeared to be struggling with someone.
''There were two shots. Mr Dunn took three steps backwards then fell
to the ground. The shots appeared to come from the car. As he fell
backwards his right arm was outstretched and he was still holding his
bag of messages.''
DC Duffy was asked if he would recognise the man who had shot at him
from the car and he said Mr Robert Smith resembled the man in height and
build.
The trial continues.

A COMBINATION of the Dornoch Bridge, improvements to the A9, and a low
level of policing has been blamed for a spate of break-ins in a village.
There were three robberies on Golspie's Main Street in the early hours
of yesterday, and Regional Councillor David MacRae, who lives in the
Sutherland village, said these incidents were becoming more frequent.
At Mr Ronald MacDonald's Spar store thieves thought to be a
professional gang from the south stole #3000 worth of cigarettes. It was
the second robbery Mr MacDonald had suffered in two weeks.
At Alexander Morrison the bakers, #700 worth of damage was done when
the thieves took a heavy safe downstairs and carried it out to a back
lane using two scaffolding poles and a trolley. It is thought they were
disturbed by the bakers arriving for work at 4am.
The proprietor, Mr Sandy Morrison, said: ''It was just an awful effort
for nothing in our case. Bakers are not known for keeping large amounts
of money on their premises. It is just a nuisance and a mess for a
couple of packets of cigarettes.''
At the Stag's Head Hotel the thieves got away with more than #500 in
cash from a gaming machine, cigarette machine, and cash registers. There
was several hundred pounds worth of damage.
Mr MacRae said it was ''very worrying'' because was is becoming more
and more frequent. ''There is no doubt in my mind that the improvements
made to the A9 and the opening of the Dornoch Bridge have made it far
easier for thieves to travel up from the south and get away.
''I am also concerned, however, by the level of policing. As far as I
know there was only one policeman on duty last night from Kinbrace to
Dornoch. That is a distance of about 50 miles which encompasses three
villages: Helmsdale, Brora, and Golspie.''
He said it was easy to close off the exits at the Dornoch Bridge and
at Bonar Bridge, and police night patrols could stop cars and ask people
what they were doing there in the middle of the night.
Chief Inspector Jim Heddle, the Caithness and Sutherland force
commander, denied there had been only one officer on duty.
He added: ''We do have patrols stopping cars but we don't want to do
it at the same point every night. That would be self-defeating.''
He conceded that the bridge and road improvements had made it easier
for people to come up from the south, from the Inverness area as well as
the central belt. ''But having said that there were break-ins in
Sutherland long before the bridge.''

THE Government has been accused by the powerful Aberdeen Fish
Merchants' and Curers' Association of bribery and cynicism over its use
of decommissioning funds.
Its chief executive, Mr Robert Milne, claimed the Government was
sacrificing one of the country's few remaining assets on the altar of
short-term gain.
In the association's quarterly magazine, Mr Milne said that
decommissioning money was meant to reduce fishing effort in the name of
conservation. ''It should not be used to allow other fishermen to take
over our fishing grounds,'' he said.
''Yet the Government has proved it is willing to use decommissioning
money as a sop to buy off political rebellion over a fisheries deal
allowing Spanish fishermen more access to Western waters.
''We feel this is the worst possible abuse of the decommissioning
principle and fish stocks are being put in jeopardy by a recklessly
short-term policy which is hopelessly blinkered in its approach to
fisheries management.''
He said that in its bid to curry political favour the Government had
put fish stocks at risk and blown a gaping hole in conservation policy.
''Buying off a group of Tory MPs with a #28m decommissioning cash
bonus must be one of the most politically cynical exercises any
Government has indulged in as far as fisheries are concerned.
''It reveals as nonsense all those statements trotted out over the
years to the effect that decommissioning cash was very hard to come by.
''Now, it seems, there is a bottomless pit in cash terms when the
political stakes are high enough.''
Mr Milne said that the Aberdeen association supported the Scottish
Fish Merchants' Federation in its criticism of the Government for
''shamelessly'' putting political survival before the conservation needs
of not only this but future generations.
He said the new package had to be seen for what it was -- a means by
which British fishing tonnage would be removed to make way for eager
Spanish fishermen in ever-increasing numbers.
The proposals would not reduce the effort applied to fish stocks but
would pass the right to fish from redundant Scottish vessels to the
Spanish and Portuguese fleet.
Mr Milne said: ''If we as a UK industry accept a reduction in fishing
effort then our savings must not simply be passed over to the Iberians.
What we really need is a package of measures to take us into the next
century.
''The Government must accept the need for more research into stock
assessment; more research into conservation methods; more funds for fish
marketing; more funds for the development of better and more efficient
working practices; more funds for technical and logical developments to
assist in production methods; more funds for attracting high calibre
employees into the industry; more funds to upgrade fish markets to meet
all legislation; and more funds to identify the best way to sustain the
yield.''
He added that there could not be an imbalance in the distribution of
funds to the industry and there was a need for a clear strategy rather
than a short-term, stop-gap policy.
''The Government should not allow any change to the current effort
that is in place until a full investigation is carried out on the
devastating social and economic problems that the industry is now
facing.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday gave another hint of what the new
Clause 4 will look like when he pledged to enshrine equal rights for
women in the party's revised constitution.
And he warned that the days of full-time jobs for men, with life-long
job security, were over. A Labour government, he said, would seek to
encourage flexibility in the workplace for both sexes, including
childcare and nursery education for under-fives.
Childcare and nursery education, which Labour has pledged to make a
priority, were not just women's issues, he said. ''It is a woman's and a
man's issue. It is a people's issue, because it is of benefit to all
parents who want it for their children.''
His speech was part of a one-day conference organised by Labour MP
Clare Short which brought together representatives of more than 150
women's organisations, from the Women's Institute to the British
Federation of Women Graduates.
Mr Blair emphasised the need to place the rights of women at the
centre of the political agenda. ''The vast majority of British women
today, whatever their age or education or current circumstances, would
say without much hesitation that they are better off than their mothers
were. The problem is that they fear that their daughters will be worse
off than them.
''The key challenge we have to address is how we make sure that does
not happen, and how instead the next generation of women and men
continue to make progress,'' he said.
The Labour Party may have been founded by working men, but it had been
at the forefront of the struggle for sexual equality. Although there
were 38 women Labour MPs, he said, ''we can hardly call ourselves a
proud representative democracy when less than 10% of MPs are women''.
Despite radical economic and social change, the position of women was
barely improving, he said. In the NHS, 80% of employees were women, but
only 7% were senior managers. And women part-time workers earned on
average only 57% of their male counterparts.
He called for a change in politics to reflect the interests of women.
''A recent poll of young women found that four of 10 said they had
absolutely no interest in politics. They are not interested in politics
because they sense that politics is not interested in them.''
Mr Blair, whose wife Cherie Booth is a successful barrister, said
Labour wanted to encourage flexibility. ''There is no going back to the
world of full-time jobs paying men a family wage, with life-time
security, a guaranteed pension and a carriage clock at the end of it.''
The project to reform the party constitution and rewrite Clause 4
should take into account the need to promote equality. ''The struggle
for equality for women is an essential part of my vision of the values
and ideals of the new Labour Party.
''For over 70 years we have lived with a constitution that makes no
mention of equality or action against discrimination. I believe that is
a historic failure. The new Clause 4 . . . should commit the party
constitution to things that the party itself has been fighting for since
it was started.
''And that means a commitment to equal treatment for all human beings,
men and women. We believe in it. It is right. And it should be enshrined
in our constitution.''

FEARS of Brussels gaining control over immigration into the United
Kingdom were intensified yesterday when the EU Commission indicated it
had plans to ban all passport controls within 15 member countries.
A Commission official said: ''The problem for Britain is that our
internal borders within the EU are also our external borders with the
rest of the world.''
The Commission claims that free movement within member states would
mean the 15 countries removing national border controls in favour of
tougher controls at the EU's external borders.
This seemed to confirm the worst fears of Mr Charles Wardle, who
resigned on Sunday from the Government on the grounds that the Prime
Minister was not taking this issue seriously.
Mr Major was still reorganising the junior ranks of his Government
last night to cope with Mr Wardle's resignation. Another Minister has to
be found to replace him at Trade and Industry and this means other moves
within the Government if Mr Major is not looking to his back benchers.
Itis proving difficult for the Prime Minister to replace Mr Wardle
without altering the delicate pro and anti-Europe balance in his
Governnent.
Mr Major rests his case on the deal negotiated by his predecessor
Margaret Thatcher at a Euro summit 10 years ago which gave Britain an
''opt-out'' on immigration matters.
Mr Wardle, who was reshuffled last July to Trade and Industry from his
Home Office immigration post, insists that this declaration will not
stand up against the Treaty of Rome or Maastricht or in the European
courts.
He has declared that he is so concerned about an uncontrolled influx
of immigrants from all over the world that he had to return to the back
benches to make a case.
He said he had spoken to Mr Major three times on this issue in the
last two years, but Mr Major told him the position was covered by the
1985 declaration by heads of government.
Downing Street insisted yesterday that the Commission and the European
Court placed great weight on summit declarations agreed unanimously by
heads of government.
Euro-rebel Sir Teddy Taylor said he was unsurprised by yesterday's
move from the EU Commission.
He said if Britain were to be challenged in the European court and
lost, any person resident in Western Europe or a visitor to Europe would
be free to come into the UK.
He said: ''The only answer is to do what Charles Wardle has proposed,
namely to seek to have a clause in the oncoming 1996 Treaty which
preserves the right of the United Kingdom to control the admission of
all non-EU nationals and the citizens of the overseas territories of
member states.''
Downing Street denies this, claiming that the Thatcher agreement at
the 1985 summit is still firm.
If there was any move to change this, the Prime Minister would veto
it. However, with the drive for economic and political union, Mr Major
could be out-manoeuvred over the next two years on this issue and move
too late to stop it.
This is why Mr Wardle resigned. He insists there is a backdoor left
open to uncontrolled mass-immigration into the UK.
''What I am determined to do is to see that the crucial Article 7A of
the Treaty of Rome is put on the agenda for the forthcoming
inter-Governmental conference next year,'' he said.
He claims that the Thatcher concession is ''not worth the paper it is
written on'' and that Mr Major had ''ducked'' the issue at the
Maastricht negotiations.
TodayMr Major is expected to have completed the delicate readjustments
now required in his junior ranks to try to meet the divided feelings
within his party.

MANY parents have been worrying about the impact the dismantling of
Strathclyde region will have on the special needs sector of education.
When services and areas have been divided up into 12 districts with
local responsibilities, priorities are guaranteed to change.
My personal concern is for my son's future. With his specific language
disorder, he needs intensive specialist help to achieve his educational
potential.
And although he is lucky enough to be receiving that help at present
in a language unit, is there any guarantee he will continue to receive
it in the future?
What if we as a family move house to a different single-tier council,
but one still close enough to his school?
Will he be able to remain in his present school, or would he be
expected to fit into the provision provided in the new area?
The trouble is, even if there is provision in the new area, there
would certainly be a waiting list to get in. Where would that leave him?
On a broader level, my concern is as a member of the Association For
All Speech Impaired Children.
Language disorders are complex and difficult to treat, but they happen
in four in 5000 of the population.
The majority of sufferers are boys, and no-one knows exactly why.
These children need intensive speech therapy and a supported educational
environment.
The fact is that, at the moment, not all children with speech/language
disorders are being appropriately placed in educational establishments.
Strathclyde Region's education (special needs) department has made
great strides in recent years.
It has increased provision considerably for both language disordered
children and for children suffering from the often-related, and usually
more severe, condition of autism.
While the plight of autistic children has been highly publicised in
recent years, language-disordered children have never had the high
profile. Consequently, the public remains largely unaware of their
problems, or even existence.
However, Glasgow AFASIC has been working away in the background for
years, and when the campaign for more provision, particularly for speech
therapy, was mounted on behalf of autistic children, the education
department increased provision for both areas of special needs.
Richmond Park language unit in Glasgow has had its size increased
considerably from six classes with 36 pupils to eight with 48, despite a
shortage of space.
While our association welcomes the efforts to create desperately
needed places for pupils, we have to express concern about the language
unit being over-expanded. According to studies, the optimum size for
units of this kind is about 24.
Added to the large numbers, the staff have to cope with the problems
of inadequate space. Two large cloakrooms are used as storage areas and,
by squeezing some desks into the corners, also as office space and
speech therapy rooms.
The corridor between the classrooms and the cloakrooms is lined with
shelves and cupboards overflowing with resource materials.
There is no extra room that can be used, as was once the case, to
invite groups of parents to open days once a month.
A new language unit, destined to be accommodated in St Charles'
Primary, Maryhill, is currently using temporary accommodation in John
Bosco Secondary, Hutchesontown, across the road from the Richmond Park
unit. It has two classes of six full-time pupils, with four attending
part-time, giving a total of 14 full-time places.
Despite this increased provision, both Richmond Park and the
prospective St Charles language units have waiting lists, as does the
West Mains language school in East Kilbride.
The intake for the new St Charles unit also consisted of primary one
age children. Our association is concerned about older children out
there still struggling in mainstream schools, trying to get by because
there are no places available to give them the specialist help they need
and are legally entitled to.
If Strathclyde Region, with all its resources, cannot afford to make
improvements in these areas of educational provision, what hope is there
when the responsibility for special needs is handed over to the new
councils?
Their budgets will be cut according to the size of their area and
population. What is not taken into account is the fact that some
children will have to cross boundaries to reach the specialist provision
they need, but which might not be supplied in their own area.
The councils are bound to take the local view of serving the needs of
their own community first before trying to accommodate children from
outside.
At best, this will lead to bureaucratic delays. At worst, it could
mean that children will miss out on the special education they are
entitled to.
What likelihood is there of small district councils initiating
expensive new provision in their areas, with small budgets to pay for
them?
Our association hopes that the 12 councils will agree to form some
sort of special needs forum to work together in the best interests of
all our children with special needs.

<HEADLINE>#100m in windfall benefits handed out to executives of privatised utilities, claims Brown    Labour urges curb on share options</HEADLINE>

EIGHT directors of the Scottish power-generating companies hold
executive share options worth more than #3.7m, according to figures
produced by Labour. In all, the party said, #100m in benefits had been
handed out to executives of privatised utilities in Britain.
The latest figures show that the 12 privatised regional electricity
companies in England and Wales had handed out share options worth more
than #50m to 65 directors -- more than #750,000 per director.
Labour claimed that a further #16m in share options handed out to the
directors of the new private water companies south of the Border had
pushed privatisation benefits for executives in all privatised utilities
to more than #100m.
In Scotland, the windfall has largely been for four directors of
ScottishPower, who hold options worth #3,340,956 -- nearly #840,000 each
-- at yesterday's share price. They could be worth more depending on
when the options are exercised.
At Scottish Hydro-Electric, four directors share a far more modest
#378,294 in options. The total for 145 directors of privatised utilities
UK-wide is #101,022,348.
Last night, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said Labour would table
amendments to the Finance Bill currently being considered by the Commons
to curb privatisation excesses.
''Privatised industry remuneration packages are a new form of daylight
robbery,'' he said, ''a raid on millions of consumers paying more
because of them.''
Share option packages are a popular way of remuneration for top
executives. They allow directors to buy a number of the company's shares
at a low fixed price and resell them at a later date at their higher
market value.
The figures, based on annual reports and yesterday's share price for
each utility, are part of Labour's campaign to highlight what the party
considers executive pay excesses.
Of the regional electricity companies, the highest share option total
on offer is Seeboard's #7.8m for six directors. Among the water
companies North-west Water is offering #4.9m to five directors.
Among the country's five power generating companies, the packages
offered by ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric are dwarfed by those from
National Power (#7.2m) and Powergen (#15.2m).
Mr Brown added: ''We are now able to show how huge sums, unjustified
by effort, possible only because of monopoly, are being paid out. I
challenge Tory MPs to support our new proposals to curb boardroom
excesses when they are debated in the House of Commons.

A POLITICAL row erupted last night over recorded crime figures in
Scotland despite their being down 3%, the third annual fall in a row.
Opposition MPs claim the figures hide ''a brutal truth'': that
Scotland is becoming a more dangerous place.
There is an overall drop but crimes of violence -- which include
murders, serious assault, and handling offensive weapons -- are again on
the increase. Also up are vandalism, fire-raising, and car offences,
ranging from speeding to drink driving.
The statistics for 1994, released by the Scottish Office yesterday,
also suggest the long-running spiral of drugs-related crime is
continuing upwards.
The 3% fall in crime compares poorly with the 8% reduction recorded by
Scottish police forces in 1993. When miscellaneous and motor vehicle
offences are included, bringing the total up to 990,981, the figures in
fact show a 1% increase.
In a brief statement, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, Scottish Home Affairs
Minister, made no reference to any of the rises revealed in the
Government Statistical Service's release.
He hailed the 3% overall fall in recorded crime as good news, and
added: ''This is the third year running that the crime figures have
dropped.''
Just two out of the seven crime or offence categories, which are
grouped for statistical purposes, actually show falls, albeit including
housebreakings which are another key public concern on law and order.
The overall drop is due almost entirely to a 7% decrease in the
dishonesty category, down by 24,591 to 350,346, which embraces
shoplifting and fraud as well as housebreakings. Crimes of indecency
fell by 1%.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''Any cut is welcome,
but it is typical of this Government to hide behind one figure when the
brutal truth is behind the other figures.''
Mr Robertson added: ''It is clear that some crimes that affect people
in their daily lives are on the increase. What is needed is a major
crackdown in these areas. It also needs resources and the commitment of
Government. But it seems they are interested only in juggling figures
rather than in tackling crime.''
Crimes of violence rose by 2% from 19,404 to 19,744. Although down on
the 1992 high of 23,300, the latest figures are still some 20% higher
than recorded 10 years ago.
Vandalism and fire-raising rose by 5% to 88,543; motor vehicle
offences increased 5% to 330,724; and miscellaneous offences also jumped
by 5% to 133,193.
So-called ''other'' crimes rose by 7% to 62,403. ''Other'' crimes
includes drugs-related offences. It is likely a sharp rise in drugs'
possession will be revealed when more detailed statistics are made
available in the Recorded Crime in Scotland bulletin for 1994, to be
published later this year.
Clear-up rates increased by 3%, to 37%, although it still meant almost
two out of three crimes last year remain unsolved. For each police
officer in Scotland, 37 crimes were recorded and 14 were cleared-up.
Strathclyde recorded almost half of all crimes, some 269,983. But the
region, along with Grampian, had the worst clear-up rates of Scotland's
eight police forces -- 34%.
Clear-up rates elsewhere ranged from 37% in Lothian and Borders to 59%
in Northern.
Strathclyde's clear-up rates for violence and vandalism stood at 57%
for crimes of violence, and only 15% for vandalism and fire-raising. The
respective national averages were 64% and 20%.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman stressed that crime in the region had
fallen by 5%, which was better than the national average. The region
also had 50,000 fewer crimes a year than in 1991.
He added crimes of violence rose by only 85 to 12,356 last year, but
still remained several thousands down on the 1992 figure.
The spokesman, who argued the scale of Strathclyde crime is such that
comparisons with smaller forces are difficult, emphasised that its
detection rates have improved by 8% since 1991, when it stood at 26%.
The official went on: ''There has been a distinct improvement in our
detection rates, and we are looking to improve on them.''
Strathclyde's own figures will be released next month by Chief
Constable Leslie Sharp, whose latest crime-busting initiative, Operation
Turnkey, will show a dramatic reduction in housebreakings.
Lord Fraser, in his statement, suggested the fall in recorded Scottish
crime -- down by 15,949 to 572,064 -- was due partly to people being
more careful in looking after their property.
He also thought the improvement reflected chief constables' concerns
in shifting resources to the targeting of known criminals, as well as
enhanced technological support available for solving crimes.
Mr John McFall, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said the figures do
not present ''a good picture'', even if down from the 1991 high of
589,562. He alleged Government inaction on law and order and its
economic policies will mean it is inevitable that crimes involving
violence or drugs will rise.
Mr McFall said: ''We have social conditions in which the rich get
richer and the poor get poorer. Until it recognises the social damage
being caused by its economic policies, and its lack of action on drugs,
increases in certain categories will continue.''
A Scottish Office spokesman stressed that all figures on crimes,
including violence and vandalism, were within the release. It was also
recorded that the overall fall was ''due almost entirely to the fall in
the number of recorded crimes of dishonesty, although this itself was
partly offset by increases in other categories''.

As Valentine's Day dawns not with a bang but with a whimper, MARCELLA
EVARISTI ponders the crying game we call romance.
WHEN I realised that I did not know precisely why St Valentine was
associated with lovers and romance I borrowed a book on the Lives of the
Saints and was immediately returned to a long-past convent-school world,
where there was a saint for every occasion and profession. Of course, I
remembered the obvious ones such as St Jude being on call for Hopeless
Cases and St Cecilia being the patron saint of Music.
Sarcastic mention of these two was constantly made by our teachers
before the prelims and during choir practice. Inwardly groaning at their
strained humour, we Teenagers of the Forced Smile would voice our own
silent prayer: ''Oh Maria Goretta of the Little Children, hearken to our
wish, shared by Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, that we may die
before we get old. So that we never sound like that. Ever. Amen.''
But I cannot remember being told about St Laurence, the Patron Saint
of Cooks. I liked the sound of him. St Larry of the Licking Fingers. I
imagined him plucking herbs in from the garden with fervour and
reverence or transforming some exquisite Chablis into something even
more miraculous. I could see him swooning with sensual piety (or pious
sensualism) as his souffle aux epinards rose inexorably heavenwards.
Perhaps the school was scared to invoke his name in case Laurence,
wildly waving his moulinette, returned to cast out the dinner ladies for
their culinary sacrilege, like Jesus chucking out the traders in the
temple. Marco Pierre White directed by Pasolini . . . well, it was a
mouthwatering fantasy until I read on and discovered that poor Lorenzo
was a Roman martyr and the tenuous food connection was that he silently
submitted to his fate of being roasted to death.
After this it was quite a relief to find out that the Valentine
love-connection derived from the centuries-old belief that birds chose
their mates on February 14, on his feast day. Could have been much
worse. Given Laurence Roti, the reasons for Valentine being the patron
saint of love could have been . . . but, no, the analogies are too sick
to contemplate.
But contemplating them did remind me of a poster I saw in the pharmacy
of the health clinic where I was waiting for a prescription. At first,
when I saw the red rose I thought for a daft fleeting moment that it was
a Labour Party poster, which would have been apt but unlikely, but then
I noticed that the stem of the rose had a discreet little bandage around
its middle. ''Are you worried about love sickness?'' it said, or some
coy euphemism to that effect. Yes, and some young advertising blade had
been given the VD project, and come up with roses where once there had
been rashes.
Actually, I was about to write down the exact wording, down to which
ward in the Southern General, the no-need-for-appointments stuff, but
though my hand furtively groped inside my handbag for my pen several
times, I have to come clean and admit I couldn't be seen writing that
stuff down. Imagine smiling around that room and saying: ''Honestly,
it's for an article I'm writing for The Herald.'' So I just sat there
thinking about romance, my son's ear infection and how since Aids you
never hear people harping on about herpes anymore.
Then I imagined somebody lovelorn getting their unloved ass over to
the clinic of lovesickness, having misunderstood the poster. Imagined
them after an hour of shame waiting, being given a number and finally
getting the interview, the venereal audition:
General Southern: Can you briefly tell me your symptoms?
Unloved Ass: Night sweats. No sleep. Ah.
General Southern: Could you be more specific?
Unloved Ass: I hurt deep down.
General Southern: Is that testicular?
Unloved Ass: I beg your pardon?
General Southern: Do you know why you are here?
Unloved Ass: Without her, no. I saw your poster.
General Southern: And your partner's symptoms?
Unloved Ass: Cold heart. She leaves her answermachine on when she's
washing her hair for another man.
General Southern: I think you may be in the wrong place.
Unloved Ass: That's what she says. Her nape smelt of salt popcorn.
Could you call her ''my partner'' again? Slowly.
General Southern: Am I to take it that you are not, in fact, sexually
active?
Unloved Ass: Not for want of crying, doctor.
But of course, crying is the whole point of romantic love, the reason
for the roses and the corny reading of late-night John Donne, and the
masochistic re-reading of old letters, and all the
(banal-unless-it's-you) boo hoo of it. Otherwise it just wouldn't be the
same. Madama Butterfly should have flung open the shutters and sung:
''To hell with you Pinkerton, you imperialist bastard, you're not worth
a hair of my oriental head!'' Her family would have been relieved, Anna
Raeburn would have applauded, and the son of Madama need not have been
taken into care. But it just wouldn't be the same.
So Happy Valentine's Day to St Laurence, Maria Goretti, to chucked
adolescents, and jilted beds, to Puccini, and Maria Callas, and, gentle
reader, to you.

TALKS will be held tomorrow at the conciliation service, Acas, in a
bid to avert a pay strike by Clydesdale Bank staff.
About two-thirds of the bank's 6000 staff are members of the Banking,
Insurance, and Finance union and are due to stage a one-day walkout on
Friday.
Last week, the bank imposed a pay package, with increases of between
3% and 7% for ''satisfactory'' performers, but the union is seeking 4%
for all staff, with an extra 2.75% based on performance.
Yesterday, Bifu said it was not optimistic about settling the dispute.
Mr Keith Brookes, Bifu assistant secretary, said: ''We will be looking
for more money on the table and serious discussions about the bank's
current performance pay system.''
A spokesman for the Clydesdale said: ''The purpose of these talks is
to explore options for averting industrial action.''
Bifu members recently voted in favour of a series of one-day strikes
if no settlement can be reached. The union has claimed that many of the
bank's 325 branches, almost all of which are in Scotland, would be
forced to close on the strike days -- a claim the bank denies.
Talks are also to be held at Acas over a pay dispute at the Yorkshire
Bank, where workers voted narrowly against strike action after rejecting
a separate pay offer.
Both banks are owned by the National Australia Group.

SIX hundred student smokers yesterday protested over a cigarette ban
at their college.
They held a ''smoke-in'' to demand that Perth College provide
designated smoking rooms.
They occupied a common room, where they had previously been allowed to
smoke, in a lunchtime demonstration at the college.
Since the start of term a blanket ban on smoking has forced students
and staff to stand outside if they want a cigarette.
The non-smoking student president, George McCurrach, said: ''Students'
civil rights have been infringed and they aren't happy about it.
''We're looking for a special smoking room so non-smokers aren't
affected.''
David Joyce, 25, studying horticulture, said: ''A lot of pople have
stopped smoking, but smokers still have rights.''
But the college maintains that the ban was introduced following a
questionnaire distributed to 537 students and to staff last year.
According to the college, 90% of students and 97% of staff surveyed
wanted either a total ban or restrictions.
The college's Principal, Mr Michael Webster, said: ''There were
literally hundreds of people surveyed. People had the chance to reply.
The big majority was against a smoking atmosphere.''
Mr Webster added that he had already written to the student
association ''pointing out the college's policy and why we reached that
policy''.

* A GROUP of British war veterans travelled to Tokyo recently to seek
compensation for the torture and abuse they received in Japanese
prisoner of war camps. In interviews, the veterans spoke movingly of the
treatment they were forced to endure and the effects it had on their
health. For many young Japanese, the veterans' testimony came as a
shock.
GLOBE-TROTTING Japanese students are often surprised to hear
criticisms of their country's conduct during the 1930s and 1940s.
It is not that they condone the actions of their wartime leaders, some
of whom were hanged as war criminals. It is because they have so little
knowledge of the atrocities that were committed.
At school, Japanese pupils receive a very ''sanitised'' version of the
events of thos dark days.
Details of atrocities such as the notorious massacre of Nanking in
1937, when the Japanese army raped and murdered tens of thousands of
Chinese civilians, have been omitted from school textbooks.
Many history texts describe the 1931 invasion of China as ''an
advance'' and largely ignore unpalatable events such as the infamous
Bataan Death March, the use of forced labour to build the Burma Railway,
and the terrible conditions inflicted on prisoners of war.
The whole period of the 1930s and 1940s is given only limited
attention in many textbooks. In one text, only 16 pages out of 358 are
devoted to the far-reaching and catastrophic events, from the Marco Polo
Bridge Incident of 1937 to the start of the Tokyo War Trials in 1946.
Through its tight control of the curriculum, and the textbooks used in
schools, the Japanese Ministry of Education, or Monbusho, dictates what
is taught.
The Monbusho screens every textbook to make sure the information being
presented to pupils conforms to its detailed requirements.
Texts deviating from the guidelines are sent back to their authors for
revision.
One history text was rejected because it contained descriptions of
Japan's infamous 731 Unit which carried out human body experiments on
Chinese prisoners of war.
More than 300 other descriptions in the book were also considered to
be incorrect or inappropriate.
The many critics of textbook screening say the policy violates the
academic freedom of authors and allows the Monbusho to give a distorted
view of controversial issues.
Similar distortions are common in popular literature, cinema, and
television, which tend to dwell on what the Western powers did to the
Japanese rather than what the Japanese did to their East Asian
neighbours and their Western opponents.
Several textbook authors have tried to present a more balanced view of
the country's war history by challenging the Monbusho's policy in the
courts.
By refusing young Japanese access to the full facts, they argue, the
Monbusho is guilty of unconstitutional censorship.
However, the courts have repeatedly ruled that the Ministry of
Education has the right to determine the content of school texts.
More complaints have come from South Korea, China, and the other
countries in East Asia that suffered from Japanese aggression.
The South Korean government, for example, demanded that Japanese
children be taught about the Korean females who were recruited as
''comfort women'' and forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers.
The complaints from South Korea, China, and other East Asian states at
a time when Japan wants to forge closer political and economic ties with
its neighbours have encouraged the Monbusho to review the content of
school history texts.
Last year saw the introduction of several new textbooks that provide
more graphic descriptions of Japan's brutal occupation of Korea and the
invasion of China.
In a statement, the Monbusho agreed that consideration must be given
to events in modern history that concern both Japan and its neighbours.
One new textbook goes as far as listing excerpts from a speech made by
the Japanese Prime Minister which apologised for the pain inflicted by
Japan's wartime army.
Critics have welcomed the new textbooks, but say the accounts of
Japan's wartime conduct still do not go far enough.

TRACES of the potentially deadly bug said to have been responsible for
a rash of food-poisoning cases in West Lothian were found in cattle
faeces from one of the 17 farms which supplied milk to the dairy
allegedly involved in the outbreak, a court heard yesterday.
The bacterium was also traced in a bulk tanker of raw milk from one of
the dairy's suppliers and in two of 14 swab samples taken from equipment
in the dairy itself, Sheriff John Young heard at Linlithgow Sheriff
Court.
However, the sheriff was told on the opening day of the trial of the
husband and wife operators of the Redhouse Dairy, Seafield Road,
Blackburn, West Lothian, that no trace of E-coli 0157 was ever found in
milk from the premises.
On trial are Mr Robert Haston, 42, and his wife, Margaret, 40, of
Marbert House, Redhouse Dairy, who trade as R &amp; M Haston.
They deny three charges under the 1990 Food Safety Act: selling milk
unfit for human consumption, selling milk which was not of the nature,
substance, and quality demanded by the buyers; and depositing with and
consigning to others milk that was unfit for human consumption. All
three charges allege that the milk involved was contaminated with E-coli
0157 organisms.
The court heard from Dr Pauline Upton, 51, consultant in public health
medicine in Lothian, that 69 people were affected in the food-poisoning
outbreak, 32 of them under the age of five and that 93% of the total
were discovered to have ingested the dairy's milk.
Six of the children had to undergo kidney dialysis, but one of them,
two-year-old Clare Davison, of Bathgate, had died. Two of the children
were still receiving the treatment nine months after the outbreak.
Dr Upton said there had never been any bacteriological evidence
showing that the bug had been coming from the Hastons' dairy.
Mrs Rosemary Barrett, 43, a technical officer with West Lothian
District Council's environmental health department, told the court that
swab samples taken from a pipe leading to the bottling machine and from
a bottling machine rubber had tested positively for E-coli 0157.
She told the court that 17 feeder farms supplied raw milk to Redhouse.
At one particular farm, which she did not name, 14 out of 15 faecal
tests were positive.
Mrs Barret recalled how, during the investigation, she told Mr Haston
that the dairy was believed to be implicated in the food-poisoning
outbreak and he was ''absolutely stunned''.
Under cross-examination she agreed that the bug was never found in any
milk from the dairy. If there was such a claim, it would have to have
arisen either because the dairy's pasteurisation system was not working
properly or through contamination after pasteurisation
The trial continues.

TRAINING both secondary and primary school teachers using a CD-i is
just one of the projects to be explored at the Open Learning Exhibition
to be held a week on Thursday in Glenrothes.
The Scottish Interactive Technology Centre (SITC), based in Edinburgh,
is fronted by Byron Evans.
It develops products and materials for trainers to a specific brief,
using technologies that are available easily in the market place and
both stable and accessible.
His main market relates to the training of adults using the CD-i Rom.
Although SITC also produces CD-Rom materials, Evans feels that CD-i
gives a better video quality for a TV screen as opposed to a computer
monitor. It is also easier on the user, who doesn't need to know DOS or
Windows.
Evans says that the delivery system, developed originally for Scottish
schools, is CD-i for staff development and enhancing their professional
skills to introduce an additional dimension to training opportunities
for teachers within their own school environment.
The Scottish Office Education Department is supporting the use through
a number of grant arrangements with the local authorities, which could
be up to three quarters of the total cost.
With more than 1000 CD-i players in Scottish schools, all with Evans
software, it now makes training more user-friendly for both teachers and
management.
This is especially important in the run-up to the appraisal process
next year.
Evans feels the important elements of this is CD-i -- because there is
no keyboard, and response is to prompts on a TV screen.
Worthwhile contents, number one on this list, was additional help in
the appraisal process.
''If you know about the issues and difficulties before you do it,
there is a better chance that we will be friends at the end of it,''
says Evans.
SITC feel that they are on to a business winner. Evans adds:
''If other costs of training are looked at, this is often trainer-led.
''Twenty teachers out of different schools for a day, all with
different needs, working from different organisations, in front of
someone who may or may not know them terribly well for a fixed period of
time, they have to be replaced in their schools.
''Replacement costs are part of this. It is expensive.
Evans discovered the gap in the teacher training market 10 years ago
while working both as a geography principal teacher -- with the use of
computers -- and in the curriculum development service in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.

THE Student Loans Company has denied that allegations of corruption
are being investigated at its Glasgow headquarters.
Mr Robert Maclennan, the Liberal Democrat MP, yesterday met the
company's acting chief executive, Sir Eric Ash, to discuss the
mismanagement of loan applications for existing student borrowers, and
what he described as allegations of corruption under investigation by
accountants Coopers and Lybrand.
But Sir Eric took exception to the MP's description of the
investigation, saying he regretted the reference to allegations of
corruption.
He said: ''The word corruption is wholly inappropiate for an
investigation into some improprieties which are alleged to have taken
place between two and three years ago.''
Mr Maclennan, who is also a member of the Public Accounts Committee,
has called for the full results of the inquiry to be made public as soon
as possible.
He said yesterday: ''No interest is served by continued uncertainty
about the extent of the improprieties within the company.''
Coopers and Lybrand were called in by the Department for Education,
which had been sent allegations about the running of the company by the
Government's financial watchdog, the Comptroller and Auditor General Sir
John Bourn.
The allegations had been sent to Sir John's office by a former
employee of the company.
Sir Eric agreed with Mr Maclennan that the next three weeks were
critical for the company. The acting chief executive said the company
would by early March have draft proposals to put to higher education
administrators and student representatives for developing a repeat loan
application system which he was confident would work smoothly next year.
Many students suffered hardship between October and January because
the company's systems for processing repeat loan applications and
handling inquiries from anxious students failed.
But Mr Maclennan said after yesterday's meeting that he had been
impressed by the efforts that Sir Eric was making ''to tackle the
Herculean task which he took over''.
The company had one last chance to get it right, and the National
Audit Office inquiry into the efficiency and effectiveness of its
operations would reveal whether it had taken it, he said.
Sir Eric said the company's chief executive, Mr Ron Harrison, remained
on indefinite sick leave.
* Scotland's 43 colleges of further education will share nearly #230m
worth of funding in the financial year beginning in April.
A bigger proportion of their grants will be performance-related, with
colleges which recruit more students being rewarded with more money.
In the current year, 90% of college allocations from the Scottish
Office is based on historic funding levels, with the remainder being
determined by the ability to attract more students through the door.
For 1995-6, 60% of funding will be based on this year's grant-in-aid
levels, while the remainder will be performance-related.
Scottish Education Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said the
breakdown in allocations to individual colleges balanced the need to
move to funding based on levels of student activity while giving
institutions the stability to plan for the future.
The Government has held back 2% of funding worth about #4m this year
because college management and the lecturers' unions failed to agree at
national level on a pay rise linked to greater flexibility in working
conditions.
The money will be released to individual colleges when they settle
with their lecturers. No money will be held back for the forthcoming
year.
Scotland's biggest FE institution, Aberdeen College, will receive the
biggest allocation, nearly #13.4m.

Samac, Monday
THE Bosnian Serb Parliament today rejected yet again the latest peace
plan put forward by the big powers.
''The current proposal by the Contact Group cannot be accepted as a
basis for further negotiations,'' said MPs of the self-styled Bosnian
Serb Republic (RSK) after 11 hours' debate, ending in a majority vote.
Rejection of the latest peace proposals from Britain, Russia, the
United States, France, and Germany had been expected after Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic said he could not accept the plan, which the
parliament rejected last year.
The plan offers a virtual 50-50 division of Bosnia between a
Muslim-Croat confederation and the Bosnian Serbs, who now hold some 70%
of the land.
The MPs, uniting behind Karadzic to isolate a band of mavericks
pushing for peace under the Contact Group terms, tried to give at least
an impression of moderation, saying they remained open to talks with any
international mediators.
* The Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal today charged 21 Serbs with war
crimes and crimes against humanity at a concentration camp in Bosnia.

DETECTIVES yesterday appealed for help from the public as they
investigated the murder of a man convicted for molesting a child.
The body of Mr Lawrence Leydon, 36, was found in his home at
Southhouse Medway in the Southhouse area of Edinburgh at the weekend.
Police have refused to confirm a suggestion that vigilantes may have
been responsible for his death.
Mr Leydon, a joiner, was serving two years' probation for indecent
behaviour with a 10-year-old boy at an Edinburgh construction site in
April 1993. He appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on May 3 last year.
Detective Superintendent Alec Brown, who is heading the investigation
by Lothian and Borders Police, said: ''Mr Leydon was a loner and he may
not have been popular but whatever he may or may not have done, he did
not deserve to die in this brutal way.''
The police have refused to give details of the victim's injuries but
it is thought that he had been stabbed.
Mr Brown said: ''This was a savage and determined attack in his own
home. It is imperative that the public realise that no-one, for whatever
reason, is entitled to take the law into their own hands.
''A number of people may believe that they have knowledge of why this
attack was made and who was responsible. We would urge them to come
forward and speak to us.''
Police, who were yesterday involved in house-to-house inquiries, were
trying to establish Mr Leydon's movements on Saturday and asked anyone
who knew or who saw him to contact them.

<HEADLINE>Warrant sale couple win right to keep microwave</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979861895</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A COUPLE faced with a warrant sale for council tax arrears succeeded
yesterday in a court bid to keep their microwave.
Mr Alexander Donald, 53, and his wife, Margaret, 44, of Airdrie,
pleaded with a sheriff at Airdrie Sheriff Court not to take the
microwave , which had been valued at #25, because it was their only
means of cooking.
Their electric stove had not been included in a sheriff's officers'
poinding because, by law, they had to be left with cooking equipment.
However, the officers included the microwave in the list of items to
be sold at the warrant sale for council tax arrears of #606.04.
The couple's civilian representative, local council candidate Mr Kenny
McGuigan, appealed to Sheriff John Hall Stewart to release the
microwave.
He said that under section 16, part two, of the Debtors Scotland Act
1987 furniture, equipment, and utensils used for cooking, storing, or
eating food were exempt.
He said: ''They have an electric cooker, but only one ring works and
the microwave really is their main means of cooking hot meals.
''The couple are of low income and also have to care for a
five-year-old grandchild. The microwave is essential and should be
removed from the poinding schedule.
''So should an Amstrad double-deck video recorder which is not their
property.''
The sheriff agreed to release both items from the list.
The total realised from a warrant sale prior to the case was #150,
said Mr McGuigan.
That left a total value of saleable goods at #85, added Mr McGuigan,
who then asked for the sale to be declared invalid because of the amount
outstanding on the scehdule. Under section 24 of the act a sheriff can
rule that to carry on with the warrant sale would be futile.
However, the sheriff refused that appeal, which leaves a colour TV and
a bookcase to be sold off.

AN ATTACK on an elderly widow and the ransacking of her house may be
linked to the murder of a five-year-old boy, Irish police said
yesterday.
Chief Superintendent Tony Mulligan, the man leading the hunt for the
knifeman who killed Ciaran Malone, five, said: ''We are now twice as
anxious to catch this man.''
Police have named 21-year-old printer Jerome Kavanagh -- a neighbour
of the murdered boy -- as their chief suspect.
The hunt was concentrated in County Kildare, around Naas, where Ciaran
was stabbed to death on Saturday night. His aunt, Patricia, was injured
in the attack.
The murder scene is just five miles from Newbridge, where 72-year-old
Anne Curran was attacked and her house ransacked on Sunday night.
It was learned yesterday that Kavanagh's family, who live close to the
Malones in the small village of Caragh, had acted as baby-sitters for
Ciaran in the recent past.
Neighbour Pat Dolly said: ''The two families were very good friends.
When the Malones went on holiday four weeks ago, Ciaran was left with
the Kavanaghs. That was a regular thing.''
Relatives and friends of both families caught up in the tragedy
comforted each other at the regular morning Mass in Caragh's Roman
Catholic parish church yesterday.
Liam Kenney, one of Jerome Kavanagh's workmates at the Leinster Leader
newspaper, said the wanted man was ''a quiet, conscientious type''.
Meanwhile, police forensic experts were carrying out tests at thespot
where Mrs Curran was attacked in a bid to establish whether there was a
firm link between the crimes.
The injured woman was said to be in a Dublin hospital with serious
head injuries.
Later, police said around #500 was found in a bag on a river bank.
The cash was thought to have been stored as part of a possible plan to
flee the area.
Up to 120 police and troops were involved in the steadily extending
search operation.
A police spokesman reinforced warnings that the man they were seeking
could be dangerous.

GOOD fare at a dinner in Irvine on Friday will have potato soup and
grilled trout. There will be venison. Also, if they're lucky, clootie
dumpling. After much else, coffee will follow. With tablet, but. Even to
the pickiest of banqueteers it will be a rare old treat.
Sound dictionaries allow it to be said and spelt ''taiblet''. Once it
was called tablement. However confected, tablet remains one of the
deepest, sweetest secrets of the Scots kitchen. All winter I have been
trying to get it right.
Long sessions over a hot stove have taught much. In this world (here
is the biggest lesson) there are only two kinds of people. Some have the
magic. For tablet they are gifted. They just know how. And there are the
rest. In all their puff they will never do it.
Strictly, a third tribe exists, too small and helpless to be counted.
We are the lot who sometimes can but usually cannot. Now and again I
have been given six marks out of l0, even 6.6 for artistic impression.
But a latest batch turned out like sweet porridge. Same recipe,
identical good ingredients, and equal physical toil led to a sticky
bog-like goo. I needed help. Irvine was where to begin.
Friday's treat is the Heckling House Dinner. It marks the end of the
January season of the Irvine Burns Club. Twenty club directors invite
one guest apiece for a kind of apres-haggis night.
Never in Irvine is Burns far away. There he first tasted town life.
With the local fillettes (he called them) his appetite for sex became
carefree. Aged 23, he also had a day job. He wrote: ''I joined a
flax-dresser to learn his trade. The shop took fire and I was left like
a true poet, not worth sixpence.''
Robert Burns never dwelt on tablet. His work has no line on it. Yet
tablement had already been inscribed in a book.
In 1736 a Mrs McLintock among her Receipts cookery tips included
tablet made with orange peel and three-quarters of a pint of water:
Grate the Oranges, take 2lb of Sugar, and a Mutchkin of Water, then
clarify it with the White of 2 eggs, and set it on a slow Fire, and boil
it till it be almost candyed, then put in the Grate of the Oranges, and
take white Paper, rub it with fresh Butter, pour it on your Paper, and
cut it in little Pieces.
How the Irvine Burnsians 10 years or so ago started to take their
tablets was the idea of the mother-and-daughter catering team of Nan
McCaffer and Jackie Sutherland. Their kitchen is in Kilwinning.
Throughout Ayrshire they do banquets and steak-pie teas. Once a year
they make Kilwinning the tablet capital of the kingdom.
''The idea was to make the dinner Scottish, but everyday Scottish,''
Nan McCaffer said. ''Tablet used to be a wee special treat that even
poor people could afford. It was something grannies made.''
When showed my saccharine sludge, Jackie Sutherland gazed on it
mutely. After a pensive pause she brightened. ''I'll give you nine out
of 10 for colour,'' she conceded.
She suggested it hadn't been boiled enough. Well, it had been boiled
twice, once with condensed milk added. Everthing had been done
religiously as per recipe. And the boiling got beaten afterwards until
the arms felt they were coming off. Perhaps the mood was wrong. It had
been a bad day. The nerves were jangly. Nan McCaffer offered some
comfort. ''You've got to be in a good mood to make tablet,'' she said.
Confidence also comes into it. I treat the boiling mess so gingerly it
might be about to eat me, instead of the other way about.
Behind the recipe instructions is ingredient X. Some natural instinct
is involved. The mystery about boiling is to tell when enough is enough.
Then comes the soft-ball trick. Put a little into cold water, and when
it can be worked adhesively with forefinger and thumb, that's it.
Except there is more to know. In her The Scots Kitchen masterpiece F
Marianne McNeill nearly gives the game away. About the molten mixture
after it has been thoroughly stirred and whacked into submission, she
wrote: ''If too highly grained, it will not pour out flat; if too thin
it will be sticky. Only practice makes perfection.''
Jackie Sutherland produced a vat-sized pot. Talking about something
else, she unwrapped [1/2]lb of butter (''I think you picked the wrong
kind'', she remarked.) She added a carefree amount of sugar, relaxed
measures of milk, and a teaspoon of vanilla. She stirred steadily. She
did the soft-ball trick. She poured. About half an hour was all it took.
''Just take your mind back to when your mother made it,'' she advised.
From Kilwinning I hugged a tray of sweet perfection.
What few squares colleagues failed to scoff sit strangely alongside
the soggy bath mat of my mulligatawny. They are not the same species,
nowhere near it. Please don't say practice will bring them closer. With
tablet, some magical touch makes the difference. Talent tells. It's hard
not to weep.

Two men were each fined
#1000 yesterday for being in possession of parts of a crude snare
designed to catch birds of prey.
Leslie Massey, 34, and Denis Dowson, 38, both of Wallsend, Tyne and
Wear, were convicted at Dumbarton Sheriff Court of contravening the
Wildlife and Countryside Act.
Another charge under the Act, of intentionally disturbing a peregrine
falcon while in or near its nest containing young, was found not proven.
The maximum fine in each case was #5000.
Sheriff Kevin Breslin was told that bits of the makeshift trap were
found in the boot of a car being used by the pair while they were
visiting Arrochar, Dunbartonshire, last year.
It consisted of a platform of chicken wire with numerous offshoots of
fishing line with nooses at the end.
The device can then be placed near a nest for a bird to tread on
accidentally and be held.
Mr Keith Morton, Scottish Investigator with the RSPB, said that among
the other items found in the vehicle was a duffel-bag with ''airholes''
punched in the side.
He added: ''Inside it were fragments of waxy material found on the
feathers of young birds of prey.''
He added: ''In our experience, nests are robbed for the purpose of
obtaining live birds or eggs for trading on the black market.
''A single bird can fetch as much as #5000 in Germany or the Middle
East where it is perceived that wild birds are better than captive ones
for falconry.''
The court was told that Massey and Dowson were spotted walking on a
hillside near Arrochar where peregrine falcons regularly site their
nests.
Mr Roger Broad, a Glasgow-based conservation officer for the RSPB,
said he visited a nesting area the following day.
He said: ''It was quite clear that someone had been there before me
because the vegetation was trampled down.
''There were no birds in or near the nest.
''But it was also obvious that there had been young in the nest as
recently as one or two days previously.
''I could tell from the freshness of the leftover food and
droppings.''
He added: ''It looked to me as if the nest had been robbed.''

hours of community service at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
David Brydon, 37, admitted taking the money from Peter Shearer
Surveyors, which has premises in Rutland Street and Blackford Avenue,
Edinburgh, between March 1998 and April 1992.
Depute fiscal Brian Robertson told the court at an earlier hearing
that Brydon had sold his company Porsche and put the #19,000 he was paid
for it back into the firm to cover up for himself.
But as it was a company car the firm kept paying for it until it was
discovered that the vehicle had been sold.
Brydon, of Hainburn Park, Edinburgh, became a partner in the firm in
1988 after the death of its original owner.
He was solely concerned with the accounting side of the business and
took advantage by transferring money from the firm's business and client
accounts into his own.
This involved a total of more than 175 transactions over a four-year
period.
With money since paid back there was still a shortfall of #65,000 and
Mr Robertson said there was no explanation as to where the money had
gone other than on ''high living''.
As well as selling the Porsche, Brydon put #5000 of his own money back
into the firm in an attempt to cover up his activities.
Clients of the firm which lost out included Eastern Scottish (#35,000)
and Pentland Garage (#8600).
Brydon's former partner also had to pay out #5000 of his own money to
settle with clients.
Mr Alex Prentice, for Brydon, told Sheriff Martin Mitchell that
#35,000 had been repaid and that the firm's clients who lost money had
been reimbursed.
All of Brydon's assets had been gathered in to repay as much as
possible.
Mr Prentice said that Brydon had been working as a salesman but had
lost this job when his employer learned of the court case.
He now had little realistic prospect of repaying any more money
although he was still determined to do what he could, he added.

IN the article ''TV special celebrates Auld Alliance'', I noted
particularly that ''among the topics which Ms Wark will tackle will be:
'While the Auld Alliance is celebrated in Scotland, do the French treat
it as a political and cultural phenomenon of any significance?' ''
Last autumn it was Mlle B Madinier, director of the Institut Franais
and of the Alliance Franaise de Glasgow, who approached our society
suggesting that we might combine to hold a series of events to mark this
anniversary. To date the following events have been planned:
Friday, February 24, at Hutchesons' Hall, 158 Ingram street, 7.30pm: a
concert of lute songs from France and Scotland with Robert Phillips,
Scotland's foremost lutist, and Paul Rendall, tenor. Tickets #5 (cons
#3).
Friday, April 7, at the Conference Hall, 7 Bowmont Gardens, Hillhead,
7.30pm: Defile de Mode -- the March of Fashion -- a fashion show with
wine and cheese. Tickets #3. (On both occasions tickets will be
available at the door.)
Further events are being planned.
As it happens, the continuing links between our two countries were
recently strengthened through the twinning of Hamilton with
Chatellerault -- a connection stretching back to Mary, Queen of Scots.
We in the West, therefore, are pleased to be furthering cultural links
by our programme of events.

Chairman of Council, St
Andrew Society of Glasgow,

AN inquiry involving four police forces and taking up thousands of
staff hours was launched after the drugs-related death of a young man at
the Hanger 13 nightclub, a fatal accident inquiry heard yesterday.
The six-week investigation showed that children as young as 13 had
attended the rave event after which Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, from
Rigside, took ill and died from the effects of the drug ecstasy.
Detective Chief Inspector John Corrigan, 37, head of Ayr CID, told the
inquiry that he had taken charge of the investigation after Mr
Stoddart's death on August 21 last year.
Mr Corrigan, speaking on the fifth day of the inquiry into the deaths
of Mr Stoddart and of Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock and Mr Andrew
Dick, 19, from Glasgow, said that officers had taken the names and
addresses of 1230 patrons leaving Hanger 13 in the early hours of August
21.
He added: ''Most of these people were interviewed by police in their
local area and answered a number of stock questions in the form of a
questionnaire.''
The senior policeman said that the procurator-fiscal had taken the
unusual step, with the backing of the Crown Office, of offering an
amnesty to people who had bought or consumed drugs that night.
''I believe this was of enormous help,'' he said. ''Although I am not
convinced that everyone told the whole truth . . . I believe we would
not have gathered the evidence we did without it.''
The inquiry took 10,000 hours of police time and involved assistance
for Strathclyde Police from three other forces as well as the use of the
Holmes investigation computer system.
Mr Corrigan said that 14 people had been reported to the
procurator-fiscal and that there were six cases pending related to drugs
offences.
The age profile of patrons showed that the large majority were 18 or
over but that two were 13 years of age, three were 14 and 31 were 15.
Asked by Mr James Kelman, procurator-fiscal depute, if these figures had
surprised him Mr Corrigan replied: ''It is a fact that people under age
get into licensed premises but the 13 and 14 year olds did surprise me,
yes.''
Sheriff Neil Gow asked Mr Corrigan if he felt the large numbers of
young people attending may have a bearing on the drug dealing which goes
on. He replied: ''We have to ask ourselves why these people feel safe to
deal in drugs. It may be that the sheer size of the crowd helps to hide
them.''
Sheriff Gow: ''It is not exactly Shylock haggling in the market-place.
Deals are done very discreetly.''
Mr Corrigan: ''They know the dealers and know where to find them.''
Mrs Christine Ridah, 48, of Seafield Drive, Ayr, told the court that
she is a director of the company which runs Hanger 13. She said: ''We
were all absolutely devastated and horrified by what happened. Since
August we have carried out a number of changes to the running of the
club and we have further plans for improvements pending the outcome of a
licensing appeal.''
Summing up, Mr Kelman said that the inquiry into the three deaths had
demonstrated a serious drugs problem in and around Ayr which was of
great concern to the public.
He continued: ''I do not feel we can offer a solution to the drug
problem but we must look at ways of preventing a recurrence of such
tragedies . . . it may be that your lordship would wish to press the
Scottish Office to tighten guidelines for the licensing authorities
considering such dance and rave venues.''
Mr Kelman said he hoped the ''extensive and sensitive'' media coverage
of the inquiry would help to get across the message that drugs can kill
and that, in the words of one expert witness: ''Taking ecstasy if like
playing Russian roulette with your life.''
Mr James Reid, solicitor for the club owners, said that despite some
suggestions there was no evidence whatsoever that club staff were
involved in the supply of drugs.
He added: ''I would also submit that there is nothing that the staff
or management could have done which would have prevented these tragic
deaths.''
Mr Jack Drummond, uncle of the late Andrew Stoddart and representing
the family, said: ''A generation of young lives is being destroyed by
ecstasy and the people in authority would be failing in their duties if
they did not make every possible effort to make sure that no such
tragedies ever happen again.''
Sheriff Gow will deliver his judicial determination and make any
recommendations tomorrow.

TRAINING in forestry, agriculture, fishing and small business
management, is now on offer from the Crofters Commission.
This move follows the recent appointment by the Inverness-based
organisation of Arthur MacDonald as its new development officer.
MacDonald has spent all his working life in agriculture; crofting
communities throughout the Highlands and Islands know him best for the
10 years he was training advisor for the Agricultural Training Board.
The first step in wooing crofters into other training and business
areas is by direct mail.
Two thousand brochures have now been mailed to crofting communities,
and a number of replies are being answered.
This outlines the Crofting Township Development Scheme and highlights
training measures to help improve business management and efficiency,
especially on the agricultural and forestry side.
On the agricultural front, courses are offered in book-keeping, animal
health, and practical help for agricultural skills.
As the average age of a crofter is higher than in other jobs,
MacDonald needs to work hard to bring new training and skills to the
Highlands and Islands.
However, he says: ''We are still only feeling our way at this stage.
''We will be trying to encourage people to do anything that is
beneficial to their community.
''Historically, training isn't something that crofters see for
themselves. It is difficult to see a skills gap in yourself, you tend to
have a go first.
''I will be trying to broaden most schemes out. Most people will be
able to pinpoint one thing that they want to do.
''However, the Township scheme requires that they have to operate in
two sectors, and it is when they are pushed into something slightly
different that you come into an area of skills gaps.
''We are aiming to get them into training.''
On this front, the Highlands and Islands have help from the Rural
Training Services, although the first point of contact is still the
local Enterprise company.
However, any group or township wanting to get involved in the new
options should contact MacDonald first.
He feels that his contacts are good, following his years working for
the Agricultural Training Board, and plans to expand into the local
enterprise network.
Expansion is also moving into the area of communications.
There are plans for communities to have one building to maintain
regular contact with agricultural organisations, the Crofters Commission
and the LECs, perhaps through a local computer network.
MacDonald stresses that a move in this direction would be centred
around training. ''I see quite a lot of situations where technology is
made available or the capital to purchase it, and then there is nobody
to use it,'' he adds.
MacDonald is also taking training in this section to use Internet, an
international computer networking system that is to be part of the job.
''This idea of trying to get crofters better linked to organisations
they use often is important; it could also be used on the tourist side
to check future bookings, but this will all depend on how townships will
be able to use the systems.
''Training also plays a strong part in the use of dips or 'anything
that tampers with the environment both on the building and forestry
front','' stresses MacDonald.
Although much of the inspection and advice is run through Forestry
Enterprise and the Scottish Agricultural College, the Township scheme
will be a major player to help with form filling and advice.
''My role is to encourage crofters to look at wider developments than
they would traditionally do, particularly the crofter forestry
programme.
''Here, alongside training, there will be advice on species selection,
site, and management; it is the management of woods that will be the
strongest training point,'' said MacDonald.
For the future there is also now the idea of a training group network,
with each locality represented by its own co-ordinator making the
arrangements for an instructor or tutor to be brought in.
MacDonald added: ''It is worthwhile to explore this. It could be that
we are looking at funding someone from each large community to go and
make connections and become a focus for training in that area.''

<HEADLINE>Major in bid to win over Ulster Unionists</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979861903</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister yesterday mounted a new drive to patch up relations
with Ulster Unionist leaders and win their support for UK-Irish
proposals for all-party talks on Northern Ireland's political future.
Mr Major plans to meet both the Democratic Unionist Party and the
Ulster Unionists, as well as the Alliance Party in the coming week.
He will urge them to adopt a positive response to the framework
document being hammered out between London and Dublin.
The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, and the Irish
Foreign Minister, Mr Dick Spring, will meet in Belfast today for what
could be a crunch session as the two Governments work to resolve
outstanding differences.
Both sides hope the document, which will set out the framework for
all-party talks, can be published before the end of the month.
Before then, Mr Major wants to have private talks with the Unionists
to repair bridges broken in the past fortnight since publication of a
leaked draft of the document.
The Unionists have warned that if certain sensitive leaked details are
in the final draft, they will withdraw support for the Government which
has proved vital to Mr Major on a number of key Commons votes in the
past year.
He is expected to meet a three-man delegation from the UUP at Downing
Street tomorrow.
The UUP leader, Mr James Molyneaux, will stay away, but Mr William
Ross, the party's Chief Whip at Westminster, Mr David Trimble, and the
Rev Martin Smyth will attend.
The DUP leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, is due to meet Mr Major early
next week, their first face-to-face confrontation since the Prime
Minister threw Mr Paisley out of No 10 during a row last year.
Dowing Street said the round of meetings were ''part of the process of
keeping the main constitutional parties abreast of developments''.
But any developments will revolve around what Sir Patrick and Mr
Spring can agree in Belfast today.
Sir Patrick Mayhew said last night that punishment beatings were
barbaric and must be ended.
Speaking after the injury of nine people in three attacks on Sunday
night, Sir Patrick said the activities of so-called paramilitary
punishment squads were repulsive.
They were a ''flagrant violation of the right to live free from fear
of violence'', he said.
Seven people were injured when a hooded gang of men attacked a house
outside Londonderry last night and laid into the occupants with baseball
bats and clubs in the front garden.
The attackers fled when police happened on the scene. Six were
arrested later and two more yesterday.

Scotland will need to undergo a cultural revolution in attitudes
towards education and training by the year 2000 if its economy is to
flourish, according to Stephanie Young, the newly appointed director of
the Advisory Scottish Council for Education and Training Targets
(Ascett), in a consultation document entitled World Class Scotland.
It is to be sent to 800 organisations throughout Scotland to seek
their opinions on how to achieve such a revolution.
Ascett has set the following targets for the end of the century which
it urges educational institutes and business to adopt: -- 85% of young
people to attain five Standard Grades or equivalent; 70% of young people
to attain three Highers or equivalent; 60% of the workforce to have at
least three Highers or equivalent; and 50% of organisations to be
committed to Investors In People -- the Government's scheme to encourage
companies to increase the skills of their workers.
Ascett is an independent body which was established by the Secretary
of State for Scotland in 1993.
The targets were chosen after a consultation period which covered 100
events and 6000 people.

I READ with interest your articles on Emily's List and women in the
Scottish Labour Party (February 6).
I am a supporter of getting more women into Parliament. However, the
parliamentary system would have to change dramatically to become more
''family friendly''. The hours that MPs are expected to work do not
contribute to healthy family life. The problems of being a Scots MP are
further compounded by the distance that he/she has to travel.
From what I have seen about Emily's List I would tend to agree with
your reporter that it appears to promote a certain class of women in
''New Labour''. It also only supports women who are pro-choice on the
abortion issue and does not entertain applications from pro-life women
in the Labour Party.
This characteristic failed to come out in the article and I feel it is
a major stumbling block to its promotion of women in polics.

ALLAN MORRIS is right to complain of the lack of interest shown by BBC
TV Scotland and Scottish Television in Celtic Connections, but wrong to
assume that it would be different for other kinds of music, particularly
jazz (February 13).
Since the Glasgow International Jazz Festival started in 1987, artists
it has presented whom the television companies have felt able to ignore
have included Sarah Vaughan, Oscar Peterson, Miles Davis (one of his
last concerts), Dizzy Gillespie, Tony Bennett, Benny Carter, Max Roach,
Tommy Smith, Carol Kidd, and literally hundreds more.
By contrast, the Brecon Jazz Festival, probably Glasgow's nearest
rival, has all its major concerts recorded by BBC Wales for presentation
on the network. Most of the major European jazz festivals have similar
arrangements with their local broadcasters.
In the light of this, the excuses which the Scottish broadcasters
invariably offer (mostly variations on ''there's no call for it'') are
pretty pathetic. If coverage of these important concerts is as difficult
to justify as they say, how come everyone else manages to do it?
I support Mr Morris's hope that the Scottish broadcasters have now
seen the error of their ways over Celtic Connections. But don't hold
your breath.

WILLIAM RUSSELL appears to propagate the line that passive smoking is
no more than a mildly unpleasant inconvenience for non-smokers and that
current attitudes to smokers are rather worrying (January 30).
As an asthmatic for many years let me assure him that even the
briefest exposure to tobacco smoke (even second-hand, so-called passive
smoke) makes me physically ill and more prolonged exposure can make me
very ill.
During the decades when smoking was more prevalent I was virtually
excluded from large parts of society and leisure activities by the
presence of smokers discharging their noxious contaminants.
Even now I can seldom visit a pub because of the scarcely breathable
atmosphere.
If today's smokers feel that they are being treated like lepers (who
could not help their condition and did not deserve such treatment) they
at least have a remedy to hand. They can give up smoking. I had no
remedy available.

THE latest factory gate prices suggesting renewed inflationary
pressure in the economy were only partly anticipated by analysts and so
had a worse than expected effect on stock market sentiment yesterday.
Some of the bad news was identifiable in advance from two sources.
First, the December mini-Budget, forced upon the Chancellor to replace
the revenues lost with the defeat of the proposal to raise VAT on
domestic fuel to 17[1/2]%, involved extra duties on petrol, drink, and
tobacco. Secondly, most manufacturers tend to review their prices on
January 1 each year, and such reviews were expected to recommend
increases since demand has been so restrained for such a long time that
manufacturers have been desperate to widen their profit margins. They
may have been encouraged to do so by good Christmas retail reports
(though not all retailers experienced these).
The actual outcome was worse than such calculations indicated and will
appear to have vindicated the pessimism of the Governor of the Bank of
England, and so the three successive increases in base rates since last
September. It may also confirm the fear that further rate increases must
be in the offing even if there is every possibility that these could be
postponed until May. Waiting should give the monetary authorities time
to see just how far the earlier increases have affected prices, but time
will also show whether the attempt to widen profit margins has
succeeded. Previous attempts to do this have been abortive for retailers
have found it impossible to sustain higher prices in the face of the
ferocious competition prevalent in all retail sectors and just
underlined by the latest instalment of the supermarket wars in Tesco's
proposed new loyalty card for customers. Those retailers who proclaim
their intention to eschew sales and stick to their existing price scales
are certainly brave.
Raw material costs have been moving upwards strongly but their
inflationary impact has been reduced by productivity gains which have
also managed to offset earnings growth a little ahead of inflation. Fast
falling unemployment could easily alter that picture: though we are
still far from labour shortages as such, skill shortages could soon be
another matter. These influences are familiar enough, and not the same
as those mentioned by Mr Brown, the Shadow Chancellor, yesterday, when
he said that the culprits for our present difficulties included low
manufacturing investment and capacity constraints on output.
Manufacturing investment may actually be picking up a little, but there
is little doubt that it has been very slow to grow. Corporate treasurers
have been reluctant to accept the reality (or long-time continuance) of
low inflation and have been postponing investment projects because the
likely returns have often been far too low compared with the assumptions
of the inflationary era. Obviously quite sophisticated planners can be
trapped in inflationary expectations as easily as home buyers. A
long-term weakness in British manufacturing -- our unwillingness to
invest heavily in it -- certainly exists and will work to our
disadvantage if the recovery continues so that domestic demand
eventually boosts the already strong export demand.
It is less certain that we are up against capacity constraints in
production at this stage. Not only is domestic demand not strong enough
(hence the conflicting evidence from retailers) but we have not started
to suck in imported consumer goods on the scale which many believed
would have been a feature of this stage of the recovery. In this respect
the well-known popular uncertainty (over job security and mortgage
rates, for example) has simply dampened down the enthusiasm of spenders,
and certainly of private borrowers. Mr Brown is ahead of the game, but
maybe not too much. It would be a great pity if such a strong export-led
movement, as we have been experiencing, is halted by an inability to
produce enough of the goods required. That at least can be remedied,
though the worry is that new plant and capacity might just be ready to
meet a cyclical downturn.

ONE of the things wrong with this country is that people sit around
complaining about things instead of getting up and doing something about
them.
A case in point is our fishermen. They have been moaning about the
European Union regulations concerning the amount of fish they can catch.
Yet only last week there were reports of a huge whale in the River
Clyde.
There is good eating on a whale, as those who can remember the days
when Britannia ruled the waves will know.
Why has no-one been enterprising enough to go out and catch the
leviathan? It would furnish a mountain of tasty and nutritious whale
steaks.

A SPORTS producer yesterday received his #11,000 compensation from
Scottish Television for unfair dismissal after sending on sheriff
officers when he decided the company was running out of extra time.
The TV station, however, insisted the cheque was already off before
the officers' involvement.
Mr Ron Marshall was made redundant from his #40,000-a-year job as
sports editor at Scottish Television in December 1993. An industrial
tribunal later ruled he had been unfairly dismissed and ordered the
company to pay him compensation.
According to Mr Marshall, the deadline for paying him the money was
December 13, 1994. He says neither the money nor an explanation for its
non-payment was forthcoming, so two sheriff officers were sent to the
studios yesterday morning with an enforceable order requiring payment of
the sum, plus interest, within two weeks.
Mr Marshall said later: ''At about the same time as the officers went
there -- I don't know which happened first -- a hand-delivered cheque,
with the interest properly calculated, arrived at my lawyer's office.''
In a statement issued yesterday, Scottish Television said: ''We are
very surprised at the action taken by Mr Marshall and his solicitors
since, while they are entitled to do this, it is not normal practice.
''All they had to do was make a simple telephone call instead of
setting up what can only be described as a cheap publicity stunt.''
A spokesman said the cheque had been delivered before the sheriff
officers arrived.
Asked why the company had waited until yesterday to deliver the
cheque, he said: ''It was just an oversight, as far as I can gather.
There was no reason other than that.''
Mr Marshall said: ''That is the kind of response I would expect from
Scottish Television. There was no onus on me to lift a telephone.''
He added: ''It has taken longer than it should have, but I am pleased
the whole thing is over.''
His solicitor, Mr Bill Speirs, of Tindal Oatts, said: ''Scottish
Television had a legal obligation to pay this debt and had not done so.
Mr Marshall took the steps he was legally entitled to take.''
Mr Speirs could not say whether the cheque had reached his office
before the sheriff officers arrived at the studios.
He did not wish to comment on the company's explanation that an
oversight had caused the delay in payment.
Mr Marshall, 54, from Milngavie, near Glasgow, was made redundant as a
result of Scottish Television's decision to merge the sports department
with news and current affairs.
The industrial tribunal, held in August last year, was told he had
learned during a lunch with his opposite number at the BBC that he was
to lose his job.
Mr Marshall is now working as a freelance in sports journalism and TV
production.

SCOTRAIL is to be commended on its current offer for senior citizens.
The opportunity to travel anywhere in Scotland for #5 return during the
month of February is one not to be missed.
My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our journey on the West Highland
Line. This ''line for all seasons'' must surely remain a line for all
time.
Mr Renton, who enabled the completion of the line in 1894, will surely
be turning in his grave at the threat of closure that hangs above this
most beautiful of all lines in the ScotRail network.

CAN I draw the attention of your readers (and your journalists Messrs
Bold and Belcher) that Burns suppers are not held for the purpose of
over-indulging and staggering home in a sorry state.
I have attended well over 100 Burns suppers over the past years and
only on one occasion have I seen anyone end up in this aforementioned
condition.
The object of attending or participating in a Burns supper is to
remember the undeniable genius of our national bard, and to do so by
enjoying an evening of speeches and entertainment.
The Burns Howff Club of Dumfries actually sends a warning letter to
any person who ''misbehaves'' by speaking during the speeches and
entertainment. During the past 20 years, only two such letters have been
despatched.

Murray Ritchie, European Editor, reports that predictions of a flood
of immigrants through the Euro back door have been met with polite
puzzlement among Eurocrats
MR CHARLES WARDLE'S apocalyptic vision of 15,000,000 illegal
immigrants flooding into Britain because ''Brussels'' is dictating
domestic immigration policy provoked a degree of mystification in the EU
yesterday.
But Eurocrats, long accustomed to the eccentricities of the European
debate in Britain, were constrained in giving formal reaction lest they
be accused of interfering in the domestic affairs of a member state.
But privately they seemed to agree with the view of the Prime Minister
that Mr Wardle's vision was, to put it politely, blurred.
Mr Wardle's main point is that the so-called ''opt-out'' from the
single market legislation is not sufficient to protect Britain from
millions of illegal immigrants swarming into the country through the
Euro back door.
In the first place, there is no such opt-out. There is merely a
written declaration. What Margaret Thatcher did at the Luxembourg
inter-governmental conference of 1985, which gave birth to the single
market, was to have the declaration written into the formal conclusions.
This text was later annexed to the Single European Act which in turn
amended the Treaty of Rome. This has, wrongly, been referred to as a
British opt-out but is, in fact, merely a codicil applicable to all EU
governments. It states: ''Nothing in these provisions shall affect the
right of the member states to take such measures as they consider
necessary for the purpose of controlling immigration from third
countries and to combat terrorism, crime, the traffic in drugs and
illicit trading in works of art and antiques.''
This does not deflect the general thrust of the Treaty of Rome, as
amended by Maastricht, towards the removal of internal frontiers. The
treaty states: ''The internal market shall comprise an area without
internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons,
services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of
this treaty.''
Margaret Thatcher returned from Luxembourg satisfied she had protected
Britain from the Wardlesque nightmare. Indeed, in her memoirs she says
she would not have signed the single Act if this safeguard had not been
included. But later, it seems, she doubted whether the declaration was
binding. It is this doubt which has so worried Mr Wardle -- though it
causes little concern inside the European Commission or among other
member states. Plainly, it is one for the lawyers.
Meanwhile, the commission is preparing a directive to be discussed in
the Council of Ministers when the time comes for the EU finally to put
the spirit of the Act into operation. It is at this point that the
Eurosceptics could have some fun.
Before then, two hurdles have to be cleared. First, a case before the
European Court of Justice has to be resolved. This involves the European
Parliament, fed up with endless delays in the removal of frontiers,
suing the European Commission for not pushing the cause fast enough. A
decision could be out later this year.
Second, the so-called Schengen states in the EU -- those without
external frontiers who signed a deal in the Luxembourg town of that name
-- are pressing ahead with the removal of internal controls. This should
happen next month or April.
But the corollary is that safeguards against illegal third-country
immigration will be strengthened along the EU's more important external
borders. Commission officials believe this will more than compensate for
the removal of internal borders and calm Mr Wardle's fears. In other
words, people travelling inside the EU have more freedom to move -- as
between states in the US -- but gaining entry to the EU in the first
place will be more difficult at the external border.
This should have been expected to please Mr Wardle instead of
provoking him to resign. Hence the puzzlement not just in Brussels but
in Downing Street.
Mr Wardle does have a weapon on his side, although he might have
overlooked it in his confusion. When the EU member states meet formally
to discuss the commission's proposed directive they must reach their
decision unanimously. This means that any state can wield a veto. If Mr
Major (or Mr Blair?) is so minded he need only say: ''No.'' The rest of
the EU could do nothing.
If the time comes when the British Government feels the need -- which
it probably won't -- to veto a directive governing more freedom of
movement, it is possible that another course of action could be found to
bring Britain into line. This would be a last resort.
Since there can be no cause for challenging the use of a veto in the
Court of Justice, those who believe the British would be behaving
unreasonably could support an individual petition to one of the European
courts alleging that his or her freedom of movement had been unfairly
impeded. Given the British record of losing to the Court of Justice in
Luxembourg and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the outcome
could change history.
But we are nowhere near that yet. While we await events perhaps Mr
Wardle might like to explain his conviction that the aforesaid
15,000,000 immigrants would choose Britain to live in illegally when so
many other EU member states have much more generous social security
benefits available, not to mention better weather. Just a thought.

TREASURY Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken, the Cabinet Minister in
charge of Government spending, warned Tory lawyers last night that legal
aid expense had to be reduced.
Mr Aitken was supporting a drive by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay,
to cut down legal expenses.
Mr Aitken described the present situation as failing lawyers and their
clients. ''Neither the providers of the service nor the ostensible
clients have any significant interest in efficiency or economy in
delivery.''
Mr Aitken inserted a key controversial element into his speech last
night to the Society of Conservative Lawyers by advocating the
encouragement of private insurance to cover legal costs.
He said: ''I was much struck by the international comparisons on the
legal expenses insurance market which pointed out that premium income in
this field of insurance was, in 1991/92, #1250m in Germany, #400m in
France, and only #70m in the UK. These figures suggest that legal
insurance is a neglected area in this country and I would welcome the
extension of existing private insurance schemes.''
Mr Aitken appeared to be advocating that legal aid had to be cut from
#1400m in the current year. He wants individuals to take out insurance
to enable them to meet the costs of litigation, rather than the state.
He claims the massive cost increases of litigation are by no means all
due to the increase in the number of people receiving help under the
legal aid scheme. ''A huge share of this rise is due to the large
increases in the cost per case.''
Mr Aitken's controversial speech last night follows another one by his
predecessor at the Treasury in charge of public expenditure, Mr Stephen
Dorrell, who over the last fortnight has been advocating that people
should cease to look on their homes as an investment and go to
stockbrokers instead.
Mr Dorrell's line of argument as a former Treasurer Chief Secretary
has raised eyebrows in the Government, being viewed as realistic but
politically embarrassing. Mr Aitken's speech to the Tory lawyers last
night suggesting that individuals should take out insurance instead of
relying on legal aid produces further controversy for the Prime
Minister.

LABOUR MPs yesterday lined up to attack the housing agency, Scottish
Homes, as an unelected quango which abuses its power and denied its
tenants freedom of choice.
Leading the assault, housing spokesman John McAllion accused Scottish
Homes of ''dirty tricks'' over the involvement of staff members in
so-called tenants' bids to take over ownership of the agency's housing
stock.
The MP urged Scottish Housing Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton to
investigate allegations that Scottish Homes's time and money was being
spent on pushing certain local bids to acquire the housing.
Mr McAllion told the Scottish Grand Committee meeting in Edinburgh of
claims that Scottish Homes staff were actively promoting bids to buy
agency housing stock in which they themselves were involved.
They did this by by passing traditional tenants groups and setting up
''bogus'' ones which gave the appearance of being tenant-led but in fact
were led by agency staff.
''There are even allegations of a dirty tricks campaign against those
tenants who stand up and oppose what is going on,'' he said.
Mr McAllion said he did not necessarily blame the staff who were
caught between a rock and a hard place.
New landlords who acquired the housing stock did not have to employ
them and Scottish Homes was also on record as wanting to reduce staff
numbers.
''The only thing they know is to fight for their jobs by trying to set
up those so-called tenants-led bodies,'' he told the committee.
The Labour spokesman attacked the Government and Scottish Homes for
not allowing tenants proper freedom of choice over their future landord.
They were obsessed with forcing people out of the public sector.
The tenants' fate was being decided by the Minister who was the second
son of a duke ''whose head seemed permanently in the clouds'', he
claimed, and by Scottish Homes chairman Sir James Mellon, a life-long
diplomat.
Later, Scottish Homes's chief executive, Mr Peter McKinlay, who
watched the debate, said he was mystified by Labour's claims of bogus
landlords. With only two exceptions, bids for the housing stock had come
from registered associations or co-operatives.
He agreed there were joint initiatives between local staff and tenants
but insisted they received no more help from Scottish Homes than other
groups such as council tenants who wanted to buy their homes and manage
them.
Mr McKinlay also said time spent by staff on local bids was monitored
and the cost could be recouped if a sale was made.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said the aim of Scottish Homes was to
improve the quality and variety of housing options available.
It had inherited some 75,000 houses from the Scottish Special Housing
Association in 1989 but had always envisaged its formation would provide
an opportunity for creating new landords.
Some 23 ballots had been held involving nearly 13,000 tenants and the
results had shown that on average some 62% favoured transfers to
alternative landlords.
''I think there is ample evidence if any is needed that tenants are
fully aware of the advantages of moving to alternative landlords,'' he
said.
Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Archy Kirkwood accused Scottish Homes of
doing the Government's dirty work over stock transfers and said the
agency should be accountable to a Scottish parliament.
SNP MP Andrew Welsh said it was yet another unelected and
unaccountable quango. Stock transfers were taking place with minimum
tenant involvement yet involving Scottish Homes staff as main
instigators.
Tenants from the Freedom of Choice campaign, who lobbied MPs going in
to the debate, brought along a Valentine card for Lord James.
It repeated their call for district councils to be included on the
ballot papers and attacked Scottish Homes for restricting choice in the
ballots to just one alternative landlord.
Campaign Secretary Mary Reid said the fight would go on with a protest
by tenants at Westminster next month.

STEWART LAMONT's column on UFOs appeared at the same time as the
current issue of Nature featured articles about the probability of other
life in the universe (February 11).
In one article it was estimated that there are about a billion
''genuinely habitable worlds'' in our galaxy alone. Although I am very
sceptical about UFOs and not at all convinced that any of the sightings
are of visitors from space, I think it very probable that there is life
on other planets circling other suns in our own and other galaxies.
Indeed, it would be very odd if, in such a vast universe with its
estimated 100 billion galaxies, ours was the only planet on which life
had appeared.
However, the distances to even the nearest of those possibly inhabited
worlds are so great that we may never be able to reach them, nor they
us. But it is possible, even likely, that one day -- not perhaps in our
own lifetime -- we shall pick up encyclopaedic information beamed in our
direction about the history and culture of other remote civilisations.
Our astronomers are already listening.
Perhaps theologians should be thinking about the implications of all
this. Our great religions were established when it was assumed that the
earth was at the centre of the universe and that the creator was
involved in shaping our unique destiny.
Stewart Lamont raised the subject of UFOs. Perhaps he would like to
speculate on the implications for theology of there being so many other
worlds from which they might have come.

YOUR editorial comments on organs (Dying king of instruments, February
6) justly express sorrow at the diminishing numbers of skilled organ
builders, and you speak of having to make pilgrimages to Manchester and
Atlantic City to hear the Mighty Wurlitzers etc.
However, it may be worth mentioning that small bands of devotees all
over the country still labour away to preserve the old theatre organs,
and from Glasgow there is no need to travel as far as Manchester to see
one -- there is an equally spectacular Wurlitzer in East Kilbride's
Civic Centre (superior to the Granada Studios one, in my opinion) and
also a very fine Compton in Summerlee Heritage Trust Museum at
Coatbridge, both restored by members of our club.
Every month there are concerts on these two organs by internationally
famous players.
Some of our members, incidentally, possess two fine Wurlitzer organs
which are looking for new homes -- a theatre, a pub, a pizza parlour, a
leisure complex, a department store, or whatever. Any takers?
Do not despair of organ builders yet: our club team is still working
away, and anyone who might be interested in learning something of the
ancient craft would be very welcome to join us.

JOHN DOUGLAS, who is so angry about the European Union (Common Market
to him), is mistaken in nearly all the facts which underpin his anger
(February 3).
The recently reported case of UK citizens the European Commission on
Human Rights believes were falsely imprisoned for non-payment of poll
tax has nothing to do with the European Union.
The European Convention on Human Rights was made through the Council
of Europe (inaugurated at St James's Palace, London, on May 5, 1949) by
European Governments led by Britain, determined to create institutions
which could act to protect all the peoples of Europe against a
recurrence of the kind of tyranny which had just been defeated.
Fifty years after the liberation of Belsen by the British Army, does
Mr Douglas really want us to turn our backs on the European Convention
for Human Rights? A lot more is at stake than whether English
magistrates can send poll tax debtors to prison without a fair trial.

Marine accident experts have launched an investigation after a
fisherman was crushed to death by trawler netting gear which had broken
free.
Mr Calum Macauley, 25, a bachelor from Fraserburgh, was taken by Navy
helicopter to Derriford Hospital, Ply-mouth, on Saturday but was
pronounced dead on arrival.
Police confirmed he had suffered severe leg and abdominal injuries.
Two other crew members on the eight-man Conquest were slightly injured
in the accident at 1.30am on Saturday, 25 miles off Start Point, between
Plymouth and Torquay.
Both men were allowed away after hospital treatment.
A full investigation is to be carried out by the Department of
Transport's Marine Accident Bureau.
Mr Andy Kimber, of Brixham coastguard, said: ''We understand that a
net drum bearing was sheared, causing it to break free and hit three
crew members.''
Coastguards said rough weather may have been a factor in the accident.
The crew members travelled back to Scotland by coach. However, the
trawler will stay in Brixham until the investigation is complete.
Before returning home, the crew were given counselling by Brixham's
Royal Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen, along with the crew of their
partner vessel, Green Pastures, who were present at the accident.
Mr Paul Jarrett, at the mission, said: ''They are all very very
shocked. They are a close-knit crew from a very close-knit community and
they are devastated about what happened.''

THE truth about crime in society, its significance, frequency, and
rate of increase or otherwise is a source of constant debate generally
unrelieved by statistics which can command confidence. For the ordinary
citizen crime comes in two forms. The first is concrete and consists of
personal evidence or experience. The second is much more nebulous and
consists essentially of the citizen's perception of crime. In recent
years those who perceive crime of all sorts to be on the increase have
vastly outnumbered those who actually suffer from it. Nevertheless their
opinion is of the greatest importance to the authorities and the
political parties who have their own perception of crime as an election
issue.
A year ago some 92% of those consulted in a Government survey thought
that crime should be classed as a serious problem in modern Britain. It
is unlikely that this figure would be in any way altered this morning
and the latest figures on crime in Scotland issued by the Scottish
Office do little to encourage complacency. As with all statistics it is
quite possible to stand on your head, read them in a mirror, and be
quite content with the result. This may not be the exact tactic used in
the Scottish Office, but officials and Ministers appeared quite
satisfied yesterday. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie was happy with the overall
fall of 3% in recorded crime. He described it as good news and gave some
credit to the system of targeting known criminals and to property owners
for appearing to look after their buildings more carefully. This may be
good news as far as it goes, but it does not necessarily go very far.
The targeting of known criminals is an expensive way of policing and
must be placed against a background of chief constables complaining
about a shortage of financial resources. Targeting is a successful
tactic, but it only works if it is maintained and this might be
financially difficult in the long term.
More serious is the news that crimes of violence, which constitute the
core of people's perceptions of crime, have risen along with
fire-raising, vandalism, and car offences. Drug possession offences are
also forecast to rise when figures are given later this year and
although police clear-up rates have improved it is regrettable that two
out of three crimes are not resolved. The rise in violent crime in
Scotland makes the overall drop through housebreaking, shoplifting, and
fraud look hollow. There must be more energetic efforts made to identify
the causes of violent crime and to deal with the poor police clear-up
rate, particularly in Strathclyde. These problems must be addressed
urgently, otherwise public perception of crime will become reality.

COMMITTAL proceedings against the alleged mass murderer, Mrs Rosemary
West, will end today.
The Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, Mr Peter Badge, has
completed hearing the prosecution and defence arguments during a six-day
session at the magistrates' court in the small Gloucester town of
Dursley.
Today, he will rule on whether there is a case for 41-year-old Mrs
West to answer on charges that she murdered 10 people, including her
16-year-old daughter, Heather, and stepdaughter Charmaine, between 1970
and 1987.
After yesterday's hearing Mrs West was driven under police escort in a
van with darkened windows back to Pucklechurch remand centre near
Bristol, where she is being held.
Mrs West, of 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, is accused of murdering
nine young women, aged between 15 and 21, whose remains were found at
her home and garden last year.
She is also charged with murdering eight-year-old Charmaine, whose
remains were uncovered at her previous home in Midland Road, Gloucester.
Mrs West further faces two separate rape charges. Committal
proceedings on the rape charges will follow the hearing on the murder
charges.

Buie reports how high street stores which adopt a policy of regular
price cuts have created an atmosphere of sales cynicism among shoppers
SHOPPERS for clothes have stopped trusting stores that offer an
endless stream of price cutting and have turned instead to slightly more
expensive, quality lines that they believe in, according to a report
produced yesterday.
Credibility has become a far greater issue than ever before, as
consumers shopping in stores that continuously discount lines feel they
can no longer believe the price they see before them.
As retailers have found that they must become more efficient to
survive, their policy of trying to tempt shoppers through their doors by
cutting prices has apparently backfired.
Consumers are now adopting the attitude that if the shops can afford
to slash prices, the goods were over-priced in the first place.
Retail analysts at Verdict Research are now warning that endless
price-cutting could actually harm trade in the clothing market. And they
also warn that as quality and design are cherished more by consumers,
prices may creep up.
''The proportion of goods at #19.99 are going to be higher than the
#17.99s,'' predicts Ms Hilary Monk, author of Verdict Research's report.
''Retailers are trying to move towards 'everyday low prices'. They
have realised they have to reassure consumers that every time they go
into a store, they are going to get the best possible prices, instead of
leaving the customer thinking 'If I buy this now, it will have 20% or
30% off next week','' she adds.
Clearly, the policy of continuous discounting has proved bad for
customer morale and the customer's perception of the retailer.
''The recession-hit consumer has come to distrust mainstream retailers
that discount on an ongoing basis. The most conspicuous example of this
is The Burton Group. The company's specialist chains locked themselves
into an endless stream of price-cutting that was difficult for the
business to extricate itself from. The group's fashion multiples have
seen their market share fall from 6.2% in 1992 to 5.6% today,'' said a
spokesman for Verdict Research yesterday.
The Burton Group's own report and accounts confirm that discounting
has not been a successful strategy and that plans are now in place to
adopt a more realistic pricing policy to attract more customer
confidence.
Mr Sean Eddie, a retail analyst with Natwest Securities, sees the
Burton Group as a ''classic case'' of being forced to move away from its
dependence on continuous discounting.
''The problem is weaning the customer off the sale treadmill, and just
recently the group has been showing signs of achieving that. But they
are still perceived by the consumer as offering sufficiently low quality
out of sufficiently unsatisfactory outlets. The consumer is never
compelled to pay full price and has become inured to sales scenarios,''
he said.
The success story of the retail clothing industry is, say analysts,
Marks and Spencer.
''In the autumn and winter of 1992, Marks &amp; Spencer responded to
stagnating sales by adopting Outstanding Value, which meant sharper
initial pricing,'' said Mr Eddie.
Marks and Spencer already had a loyal consumer base and has never
resorted to slashing prices across the board. As one analyst put it:
''You would be lucky to save the price of your bus ticket at some M&amp;S
sales.''
Ms Monk said: ''The way in which Marks and Spencer put across its
message to the customer was very subtle -- it was done so that the
consumer did not feel there was an image of Marks' discounting, but that
it had just enhanced the value that much more.''
She feels that other stores are beginning to follow its example,
putting more emphasis on quality and design. She picks out retailers
Next and River Island along with Marks &amp; Spencer as offering distinctive
merchandise and the right balance between price and product quality.
But some other retailers, such as Oasis, Monsoon, and Hobbs are also
achieving success. Perhaps their designs are perceived as ''hot'' at
this particular time. Perhaps also there is a swing towards
better-designed and more imaginative clothing after what has been seen
as a relatively boring period in the retail clothing trade. Basic
women's items such as leggings, baggy jumpers and polo-necks are still
the premise of stores such as Marks &amp; Spencer, whose own image for
women's and men's fashions has improved radically.
Referring to chains such as Oasis and Monsoon, Ms Monk says: ''It's
the right product and what the market wants at the moment. It's
something a little bit different and there is a bit more design input.
The prices are higher, but there is a demand for it.''
Mr Eddie says: ''There has always been in fashion an ability for niche
retailers to make money through being perceived as fashionable at that
particular time. You just have to look at Covent Garden and the trendier
parts of Glasgow to see that. But I am not sure if in general, without a
sufficiently fashionably strong product, you can get away with it.''
Etam has failed in its attempts to move its brand slightly upmarket,
providing a warning to others that the middle market in fashion remains
incredibly competitive, he says.
But if retailers face tough times, with virtually no elasticity in the
market, and, as some analysts believe, higher underlying inflation than
Government statistics indicate, the news for the consumer is good.
''Consumers are getting a better deal. Retailers in the 1990s are
focused on giving the consumer greater value, whereas in the 1980s it
was all about 'value', which essentially meant charging bigger prices in
order to enhance the feel and the style of their shops and formats.
''Nowadays, most consumers are much more discerning and
price-sensitive, and much more cynical about the extent to which new
formats are necessarily value,'' said Mr Eddie.
Labour's spokesman for consumer affairs, Mr Nigel Griffiths, predicts
that the days of bogus sales claims are now coming to an end.
''People are now thinking twice before they buy just about anything,''
said Mr Griffiths.

To force Hobson's choice on the tenants of Scottish Homes means that
democracy
is no longer in the running, believes Maggie Vaughan
THERE was once a horsekeeper in Cambridge who would let out the cuddy
nearest the stable door, or none at all. His name was Hobson.
It is his imperfect understanding of the concept of choice that some
tenants of Scottish Homes complain is being foisted upon them. That is
to say, none at all really.
Yesterday, tenants whose definition of choice extends beyond a yes or
no interlude with a ballot paper stood outside the temporary home of the
Scottish Grand Committee sitting in Edinburgh to protest for the right
to choose a preferred landlord for their permanent homes.
Scottish Homes, the national housing agency, is divesting itself of
its landlord role, getting rid of its remaining stock of around 50,000
houses before the turn of the century. There has never been any secret
about its intention. When Malcolm Rifkind, then Scottish Secretary,
guided the legislation that established Scottish Homes as Scotland's
premier quango through Parliament in 1988, he indicated clearly that
this would be a major plank of its agenda.
It was to help harness private finance for housing in Scotland, give
new scope for diversifying tenure and ownership, and offer tenants a
direct stake in the management of their homes.
The key phrase was that it was to take over ''on a transitional
basis'' 85,000 houses from the public sector Scottish Special Housing
Association, as well as taking on the mantle of the old Housing
Corporation in supervising housing associations.
It was in so many words an essentially political creation. The aim was
to end the heavy reliance on public funds by bringing more private money
into the Scottish housing market.
The shift was to be away from the dominance of public housing,
supposedly towards the creation of more diverse options such as housing
associations and co-operatives. Scottish Homes was to be an enabling and
funding body, and was to help a wide range of landlords bridge the gap
between costs and income.
But the tenants claim that far from offering diversity, Scottish Homes
has adopted a high-handed and domineering manner, fobbing them off with
a rigged choice of landlord and stacking the deck to achieve the result
it wants in ridding itself of its housing stock.
What galls the tenants most is that they are refused the option of
remaining in the public sector by transferring their tenancies to local
authorities. This they say robs them of freedom of choice.
The agency is accused by some tenants of creating a climate of fear
and apprehension about what may happen if tenants fail to vote to
transfer to the landlord offered in a ballot.
The tenants complain that when a ballot does take place, only one name
appears on the ballot paper. They can vote yes or no. A no vote leaves
them as tenants of Scottish Homes, a landlord with the avowed intent of
ridding itself of their homes. That, to put it lightly, leaves them with
an uncertain future. And, they say, it militates towards a yes vote.
The agency counters by saying its aim of improving the quality and
variety of options available in Scottish housing does not include the
right to remain in public housing: except in exceptional circumstances.
These include cases where there is a tiny number of houses involved, in
isolated areas where no other landlords are interested, or where the
local council is not the majority provider of rented housing in the
area.
This has applied so far in only one case, in Chirnside in Berwickshire
where six tenants opted not to transfer to the local council and to
remain for now with Scottish Homes as their landlord.
The secretary of the National Forum of Scottish Homes Tenants, Ms Mary
Reid, has pointed out that as government gives people the democratic
right to choose a political representative from a number of options, it
should allow tenants to choose landlords in the same way.
Scottish Homes retort that before a ballot is held, the agency will
have a lengthy period of talks with tenants and potential alternative
landlords. An independent adviser is appointed to give tenants
information and advice. But, say the tenants, how can they be convinced
of the advisers' independence when they are paid for and report to
Scottish Homes?
Scottish Homes say one name is ultimately put on the ballot paper
because they want clear evidence of the tenants' decision. Does this
mean, then, that Scottish Homes does not believe its tenants' capable of
exercising a choice of more than one option?
Labour has leapt into the fray, scenting policitical mileage to be
made from the travails of what is arguably the most powerful but
non-elected authority in Scotland. Scottish Homes controls a vast
budget, with total capital expenditure of the order of #360m. Yet, say
its accusers, it is run by an unelected board. The man chosen to steer
the agency, chairman Sir James Mellon, is a former career diplomat with
no previous experience of housing. He is seen as a political
appointment.
And it has not gone unnoticed that whereas local authorities' housing
budgets have been squeezed till their pips squeak, Scottish Homes has
escaped relatively unscathed.
The dominant model for Scottish Homes, thus far, is for its local
staff together with a selection of tenants to form a new housing
association, stage a buy-out and form a management committee.
There have been notable successes, in Edinburgh and Dumbarton for
instance. There have also been some controversial sales, such as that of
1200 houses in the Borders region to Waverley Housing. It was the
subject of a critical report from the Commons watchdog Public Accounts
Committee which expressed considerable concern about a number of aspects
of the #5m sale and warned the Scottish Office and Scottish Homes to
ensure procedures were changed.
The paradox for the tenants seems to be that the creation of Scottish
Homes was hailed as opening up choices for tenants. However, to allow
them to exercise the choice of switching to local authorities would
involve a political U-turn which seems improbable given that it goes
against the ethos of the agency.
They are thus left with the kind of choice that Hobson the horsekeeper
understood very well.

PASSENGERS aboard a cross-Channel ferry were caught up in a rescue
yesterday when their vessel went to the aid of seamen on a burning cargo
ship.
The 200 passengers watched from the deck of P&amp;O's Pride of Bruges as
the chief officer and crew helped fight the fire in mid-Channel, 17
miles off Ramsgate.
The skipper of the Shofu, which was carrying 2241 tons of bananas in
refrigerated holds, had sent a Mayday call for help when the blaze broke
out in the engine room.
The Pride of Bruges's chief officer, Selwyn Nicholls, boarded the
cargo ship to organise firefighting before Kent firefighters were flown
to the vessel.
Water was pumped from the ferry to cool the freighter down as Mr
Nicholls helped pump water aboard.
A spokesman for Kent Fire Brigade said: ''Onboard fire pumps had
failed. The Pride of Bruges pulled alongside the freighter and assisted
in preventing fire spreading with boundary cooling.''
Another ferry, the Pride of Dover, stood by at the scene in case she
was needed.
Ten of the Shofu's 23 crew were taken off by lifeboat but were
uninjured.
A salvage tug was last night preparing to tow the freighter to
Zeebrugge in Belgium.
The 4900-tonne ship, which is registered with Lloyd's of London, was
en route from Ecuador to Hamburg when the fire broke out.

THE pools firm, Vernons, is cutting back on its donations to charity
because of competition from the national lottery.
It is abandoning a scheme in which 5p of every #1.05 staked is donated
to the Foundation for Sport and Arts.
The company says there has been a 15% fall in its business since the
lottery began in November.
''We very much regret having to withdraw the 5p donations we pass to
the FSA which has in its short existence already achieved a great
deal,'' said managing director Phil Jarrold.
''We must, however, give priority to investing in our business so that
we remain a strong competitor to the national lottery.''
The company gave three-months' notice to the Department of National
Heritage of its intentions. Last month Vernons said it was cutting 95
jobs at its Liverpool headquarters.
However it will continue to pay the tax element of 2.5% which was
previously given to charity in addition to the 5p donation. Vernons
contributed #8.2m through the 5p donations last year and has given
nearly #42m since the FSA was formed in 1991.
A rival pools company, Zetters, which has seen a 10% decrease in
business, said it would try to withstand the losses before it cut
charitable donations.
A spokesman said: ''We have said we will continue to pay 5% to the FSA
until the end of 1995, with the provision that we don't start losing a
lot more money.''
Littlewoods also said it was committed to funding the FSA at current
levels.

Meanwhile a new survey claims that 75% of people would like to see a
lower jackpot and more, smaller prizes in the lottery.
Of nearly 1000 people questioned in the survey by market research
company NOP for the TSB, 54% thought the maximum jackpot should be #5m
or less while only 26% thought there should be no upper limit.
The survey also found that only 41% of all those questioned would
immediately leave their job and retire if they won a #7m jackpot. That
figure sank to just 32% in London and the South-east of England.
The latest jackpot of #9,015,108 is believed to have been won by one
person. The organisers, Camelot, yesterday disclosed that only one
ticket containing all six winning numbers had been sold for last
Saturday's draw.

<HEADLINE>Family in Orkney abuse case claims Bill will not give children full rights</HEADLINE>

THE parents and one of the children who were at the centre of the
Orkney abuse case claimed in Edinburgh yesterday that the legislation
proposed in the Government's Children (Scotland) Bill did not go far
enough to protect children.
Their evidence before the Standing Committee of the House of Commons
sitting in the City Chambers was heard behind closed doors.
One of the parents, Mrs M, said after giving her evidence: ''The Bill
should not be about children but for children. We want to ensure that no
other families suffer the way we did.
''We want to ensure that the new Bill is worded rightly and is strong
enough and just enough to last for generations.''
Her son said children in care did not have the right to speak to a
solicitor, write home or to make telephone calls. ''They have less
rights than a prisoner,'' he said.
During his evidence, he was asked what he thought about the proposed
new exclusion order which sought to remove the alleged abuser from the
scene.
The boy told the standing committee the children should also be
consulted because it could be that, in some cases, the house or the home
had nasty memories for them.
The father said he thought it important everything should start from
the principle of the children having rights, statutory rights, and that
children should know them and how to exercise them.
''What we should be doing is giving the children rights and making the
rights real.''
Members of the Association of Directors of Social Work also gave
evidence and Mr Peter Bates, president, and director of social work with
Tayside Regional Council, said they supported the need to secure for
Scotland a comprehensive Bill that would ensure the care and promotion
of the welfare of children and, at the same time, safeguard the rights
of their parents and families.
He said far too many families in Scotland were seriously damaged by
poverty and multiple disadvantage. For many of these children and their
families the great stress and hardships placed them ''at risk'',
requiring the positive intervention and support of the local authority
and other related services like education, housing, and the NHS.
The association was also looking for an improvement in the legislation
for children and families who were subjected to allegations of child
abuse. Of primary concern must be an approach that tried on the one hand
to protect and promote the needs of children, and on the other to secure
and safeguard the rights and responsibility of parents.
Mr Bates said that for parents and children subjected to allegations
that proved to be unfounded, the process of intervention and assessment
could be extremely distressing.
He added that the Bill did not adequately address these issues.

FOUR people appeared in private at Ayr Sheriff Court yesterday on a
variety of charges relating to the possession and supply of controlled
drugs.
All had been arrested after police were called to the Hanger 13
nightclub at the Pavilion on the town's seafront.
Ms Jacqueline Heeney, 20, of Somerfield Street, Glasgow, and Mr
Stephen Finnegan, 20, of Kingston Avenue, Neilston, face charges of
being in possession of ecstasy tablets with intent to supply and of
being concerned in the supply of ecstasy.
Mr David Wilson, 18, of Menock Road, Cathcart, Glasgow, and Mr Andrew
Jamieson, 19, of Millbank Road, Wishaw, are accused of being in
possession of a quantity of temazepam capsules -- 78 in the case of Mr
Wilson -- with intent to supply and of being concerned in the supply of
temazepam.
None of the accused made any plea or declaration and all were
committed for further examination. Ms Heeney was remanded in custody
while the three men were released on bail.

A JUMBO jet carrying almost 300 people was forced to make an
unscheduled three-hour stopover at Glasgow Airport yesterday after its
captain decided to remove a passenger.
The man, a 47-year-old Canadian, ignored several warnings about his
behaviour before being handcuffed by crew members and restrained by
fellow passengers on the KLM flight from Amsterdam to Toronto.
After being led off the plane, he was thought to have been charged
under civil aviation law, and with breach of the peace.
A KLM spokesman in Holland was last night unable to give exact details
of what happened on the plane, but said the captain had taken the rare
measure of ejecting the man because of his ''aggressive behaviour''.
He added: ''It was entirely the captain's decision to disembark at an
intermediate point, and was taken in the interests of the other
passengers and crew.''
The incident is understood to have cost the airline thousands of
pounds, as the plane was forced to jettison a large quantity of fuel to
ensure its safe landing at Glasgow.
The other 287 passengers on board spent more than three hours inside
the airport terminal while replacement fuel and extra food was taken on,
and the crew prepared a new flight plan for the remainder of the
eight-hour trip to Canada.
It was not clear last night whether KLM would take legal action
against the passenger in an attempt to recover its additional costs, or
whether it would ban him from future flights.
The spokesman said yesterday's proceedings were so unusual that he did
not know what the airline's stance would be.
Strathclyde Police said a 47-year-old man had been arrested after a
disturbance on the plane, and was due to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court
later today.

THE wing of the Labour Party which believes most strongly in Scottish
sovereignty last night rebuffed suggestions it could be marginalised by
the strong pro-Union stance of Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson.
Both Labour and SNP claimed victory in the televised debate between
their leaders, with Mr Alex Salmond arguing that the impassioned defence
of the Union by Mr Robertson would alienate many within his party's
membership and its voters who take a relaxed view to independence as a
long-term aspiration.
Mr Salmond was so pleased with his performance in the head-to-head
that he called a press conference to claim that in defending the Union
so robustly Mr Robertson had proved that ''New Labour'' was now wildly
out of touch with the 50% of his own voters who told a System Three poll
in The Herald last week that they were in favour of independence.
''The trend in Scottish opinion is clearly towards the Scottish
dimension,'' he said. ''In facing the other way, George Robertson has
left Labour stranded on a Unionist beach.''
Mr Robertson hit back, saying that having lost the argument, his
opponent was now ''thrashing round wildly''. He seized on Mr Salmond's
insistence that the SNP could jump from having three MPs to 37 as a sign
of lacking credibility and claimed Mr Salmond had made a ''shameful
admission'' in saying his party would seek to wreck the new parliament.
Mr Salmond had in fact said that although the SNP would campaign in
elections for the new body on the basis of seeking a mandate for
independence, if they ended up as a minority there they would abide by
its rules in the same way that their MPs operate at Westminster.
However, the convener of Scottish Labour Action, the grouping on the
''nationalist'' wing of Labour, Mr Bob McLean, last night ruled out
defections to the SNP. ''I don't think that will be the scenario at
all,'' he said.
''I think last night may have given us more latitude to exert more
influence, turning talk of strengthening the Union into reforming the
Union, and of a new settlement between Scotland the rest of Great
Britain. It might be ironic that George is being cast as an
arch-Unionist because relations between SLA and the leadership have
become civilised, open and positive.
''Those of us in SLA have a very heavy stake in the Labour Party. We
are committed, we believe it is our party. If anything, some of the
things said last night help our arguments about the tone and language of
the debate being worked on.''
Most neutral observers believed that Mr Salmond had won his televised
joust with Mr Robertson, although Labour's general secretary in
Scotland, Mr Jack McConnell, claimed Nationalists in the audience had
''behaved like a rabble'' and Mr Salmond had relied on ''smart
one-liners and planted questions''.
Although there were questions from known party activists on both
sides, this reference appeared to concern a question about the
protagonists' second-choice option.
Mr Salmond answered by saying devolution was preferable to the status
quo, but Mr Robertson refused to give a straight answer distinguishing
between independence and the status quo.
Labour claimed this came from an SNP plant, but the questioner,
anti-nuclear campaigner Lorraine Mann, insisted that she was a member of
no party and was a floating voter. Mr McConnell continued to suggest
yesterday that the question was a plant as Ms Mann ''had been seen
talking to SNP officials before the debate''.
But last night Ms Mann said Mr McConnell's allegation was ''absolute
nonsense''.
She added: ''The only people I knew were Rhona Brankin, vice chairman
of the Scottish Labour Party, who I said 'hello' to.
''At no time did I speak to any SNP officials. Mr McConnell's
allegation reflects badly on the Labour Party. People who know me,
including Rhona Brankin, are well aware that I am a floating voter.''

THE leader of the Labour Party, Mr Tony Blair, was accused yesterday
of acting like Pontius Pilate over the way he has washed his hands of
anti-abortion campaigners.
His stance was attacked by Mr Michael Forsyth, Minister of State at
the Home Office, who added that the Opposition leader had even ignored
the pleas for tolerance from a cardinal.
Speaking to the Stirling Conservative Ladies luncheon club in
Stirling, the Conservative MP criticised Mr Blair over the decision to
continue the ban on groups against abortion from attending Labour
conferences.
Mr Forsyth commented: ''The truth is his party is gripped by the kind
of militant feminists who give equality of opportunity a bad name, and
he is not prepared to take them on.''
He claimed that the militant feminists had, in fact, hijacked Labour
and forced it to designate seats which they consider winnable, like
Stirling, as solely for women candidates.
However, the Tory MP added wryly: ''It seems that Labour women share
our view that Stirling will remain a Conservative seat if stories of
their difficulties in finding a candidate are to be believed.
''Labour have been forced, too, to insist that every constituency
sends a women to their Scottish Parliament in order to meet a 50% quota.
Their conference also voted for lesser penalties for women who murder
their male partners, ignoring a basic tenant of our justice system of
equality before the law.''
Modern Labour, Mr Forsyth continued, cannot tell the difference
between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. ''It is the
former which we must strive for and the latter which leads to injustice
and intolerance,'' he told his audience.
Earlier this week, a group of Scottish Labour MPs revealed that it was
prepared to go against the party's ruling executive by providing a stall
for banned anti-abortion campaigners at next month's Labour conference.
Cardinal Winning has also written twice to the Labour leader,
expressing his anger over the ban and seeking his intervention in the
matter.

THE Government yesterday underlined its warning to British
holidaymakers to avoid the Gambia, despite assurances from the West
African state's military regime that democracy would be restored by the
end of next year.
Foreign Office Minister of State Baroness Chalker told the Lords at
question time: ''We continue to recommend that tourists consider
postponing non-essential travel.
''The situation in the country remains uncertain and security could
still deteriorate quickly.''
Of the delay in restoring democracy, she said: ''The two years
announced by the regime is still too long, because it effectively means
that the Gambia would suffer at least another 17 months of military rule
and there is no guarantee that the military would leave even then.''
She added: ''The longer the military junta stays, the greater the harm
to the economy and the longer it will take to build it up again.''

Confusion over ill-fated at-
tempts to forge an anti-Government alliance over last night's vote
sparked an internal Liberal Democrat row, it has emerged.
Foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell fired off a terse memo to
party leader Paddy Ashdown, effectively claiming that he was being made
a scapegoat for the failure of the bid to team up with Labour.
In the memo, leaked to London's Evening Standard, Mr Campbell, charged
with briefing Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on the plans, wrote:
''I am a little concerned that in the analysis of the events surrounding
our Supply Day on Monday, February 13, it seems to be accepted that I
misunderstood my 'instructions' in relation to what I was to advise
Robin Cook.''
He claimed to have carried out instructions to the letter and
colleagues Mr Archy Kirkwood and Mr Charles Kennedy would back him.

<HEADLINE>Increases in court fees are obscene, says McFall</HEADLINE>

HUGE increases in fees charged at the Court of Session were condemned
as obscene last night by Labour's Scottish Home Affairs spokesman Mr
John McFall.
He said the rises ranging up to 238% would deter many people from
seeking justice and would undermine the court's important role in
interpreting and developing civil law in Scotland.
''The Scots have always had a strong sense that justice should be
available to all, but the Tories' sole criterion is to cut back on all
public provision in order to fund pre-election tax cuts. It's obscene,''
said Mr McFall, the MP for Dumbarton.
Under the new scales introduced this month, existing fees have been
increased by 17.5% but a variety of new tariffs have also been
introduced, including daily charges for hearings and proofs for both
pursuers and defenders.
Mr McFall said that for a typical one-day hearing (#411) the overall
rise was 78% and a two-day proof (#601) was up 120%.
The largest increase (238%) would apply to a four-day proof and
summary hearing which would now cost #1170 instead of #348.
In addition, he said, changes in legal aid elegibility had excluded
250,000 Scots from access to the protection of the courts.
''The Government clearly regards justice as simply another commodity,
available only to those with the money to purchase it,'' said Mr McFall.
The increases were also condemned last night by the Law Society of
Scotland. Spokesman Mr Michael Clancy said: ''We are very concerned
about this development and will monitor its effects very closely.''
Mr Clancy said there had been a noticeable drop in cases going through
sheriff courts after fees were increased substantially last year.
The Court of Session dealt with 4000 cases a year, mostly of an
important nature or raising points of principle.
Mr Clancy said the legal system could suffer if there was a sustained
drop in its workload as well as those denied access because of the
increased costs of litigation. ''The impact could be considerable,'' he
said.

FORMER Minister Neil Hamilton was branded ''tasteless'' last night
after making a joking reference to Germany's Nazi past on the 50th
anniversary of the Dresden raid.
The Tory MP told the Bruges Group Britain should not be ''frogmarched
or goose-stepped'' into a federal Europe without the support of the
people.
Liberal Democrat Menzies Campbell said: ''This tasteless intervention
is particularly inappropriate on a day when the people of Dresden are
urging peace and reconciliation.''

<TEXT>
THE Forth rail bridge is being subject to more thorough inspections
than ever before, the Government insisted last night.
Railways Minister John Watts said in a Commons written reply that
Railtrack was responsible for assessments of the 104-year-old structure.
These had confirmed ''the present maintenance and painting programme
is fully adequate to protect the structural integrity of the bridge'',
he said.
''The structure is being inspected more thoroughly than ever before so
as to ensure that attention can be concentrated on the areas which are
in the most deserving condition.''
Mr Watts was replying to Labour's Tam Dalyell (Linlithgow), who has
raised concerns about maintenance of the bridge after complaints it was
rusting away.

<HEADLINE>Lloyd's chairman states fears over insolvency claims</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979861943</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE chairman of Lloyd's of London, Mr David Rowland, last night
appealed to MPs not to undermine its future by highlighting fears that
it may become insolvent.
He made his plea under cross-examination from the Treasury and Civil
Service Select Committee which heard that membership of Lloyd's has
plummeted from 32,000 to 15,000.
The world's biggest insurance market was hit by huge losses in the
early 1990s which ruined many ''Names'' who insure risk against their
own personal wealth.
Mr Rowland made his appeal in exchanges with Tory Nicholas Budgen
(Wolverhampton SW) who asked: ''There is a risk that in the future
Lloyd's may be found to be insolvent, isn't there?''
The chairman replied: ''Absolutely correct -- as there is a risk for
many distinguished insurance companies in the world.''
However, he went on: ''We are a commercial undertaking.
''Every time we talk like this, there is another client that goes to
one of our competitors. Under no circumstances should we conceal
anything improper. If I stand for anything, I stand for that.
''But the very nature and thrust of your questions causes exactly what
we're talking about.''
Mr Rowland warned of the consequences for many parts of the world if
Lloyd's did fail -- particularly in North America.
''The international ripples would be very, very substantial,'' he
said.
He made clear that he did not expect the taxpayer to ''bale out''
Lloyd's for the losses, as some had urged.
Stressing the beneficial effects of recent reforms, he went on: ''We
are dealing with immense difficulties. There have been enormous problems
to contend with.
''We are doing our utmost to bring a successful resolution to the huge
problems that we have. We are doing the very best that we can.''
He underlined that external regulation might have avoided some of the
earlier difficulties -- but not all.
The public gallery at the meeting was packed with spectators, many
standing, who were called to order on several occasions as they heckled
and jeered at some of the evidence.

IT would be the ultimate privatisation, said Tony Benn, ''the
privatisation of government''. The mechanism would be the adoption by
Britain and other EU partners of a single currency which itself would be
''handed over to bankers'', who would fix interest rates and spending
levels for us all.
If Parliament agreed to that, he said, ''we would be digging a great
grave and putting this place in it''.
Yesterday's Commons debate was a cause of shame to the leaderships of
the two main parties. Both might say that in politics you sometimes have
to do shameful things to keep your options open.
The Liberal Democrats had sponsored a motion calling for a referendum
if any further substantial constitutional changes in the European Union
are made. The issue of Britain's relations with the EU is the dominating
one of this parliament: the option of putting it to the people a matter
of great importance.
The Government and Labour decided on a boycott, putting on two and one
line whips respectively and putting up junior spokesmen to speak. The
debate was to be downgraded before it began and when rather less than
half of the Liberal Democrat parliamentary party turned up to hear their
leader, it looked as if apathy had spread to the sponsoring party.
Mr Ashdown said the European cause was in danger of faltering because
of a lack of strong leadership, a view reinforced by the performance of
the junior Foreign Office Minister, David Davis. Admittedly, the task of
representing the Government as a united front on Europe might have taxed
nimbler orators than he.
However, as he is the Minister we are contributing to the extremely
important committee which is to prepare the agenda for the 1996 Euro
summit, one had to hope that he is better round the table than on his
feet. A naturally slow speaker, he bravely took a barrage of
interventions and saw the speech disintegrate into a series of remarks
punctuated by interruptions.
After his speech subsided rather than ended, Joyce Quin for Labour
showed she knew quite a bit about Europe and that she was somewhat
uneasy with the party line that either a General Election or a
referendum might be used to let the people speak on Europe, a position
demolished by Mr Peter Shore, who reminded her that elections are fought
on 101 issues, referendums only on one.
The debate was rescued by some elder statesmen. Mr Benn, combining
battiness and incisive analysis with his usual eloquence soon had us
sitting up. The press were correctly lambasted -- I plead guilty -- to
describing opponents of Maastricht as Europhobes. Opponents to current
trends in Europe did not merit that term any more than his opposition to
the present Government made him an Anglophobe, reprimanded Mr Benn.
If the federalists had their way, Mr Blair, should he win the next
election, would decline to ''the chairman of the British Municipal
Corporation pleading in Frankfurt for permission to do something about
unemployment''.
Lord Tebbit had a point about rioting, he reflected. It was what the
disenfranchised traditionally did to get their point of view noticed.
But he feared that political frustration would lead to the nastier forms
of nationalism -- blaming foreigners for what was our own fault for
surrendering control of our destiny.
Mr Tim Renton, one of the (sorry, Tony) Europhiles who are ''fighting
back'', said that the single currency would bring us one per cent lower
interest rates, more jobs, lower inflation, and five per cent off the
cost of our hols sur le continent. On that basis, he thought the punters
might buy it.
Mr Benn and, after him, Mr Peter Shore and Sir Teddy Taylor evoked
centuries of national independence going down the chute. They appealed
for us to fight for our liberties. They may have been appealing to an
electorate which is no longer there, one which might prefer a gamble on
Mr Renton's offer.

SEVEN Tory MPs voted with the Liberal Democrats last night in favour
of a referendum on Britain's future role in Europe.
They were joined by Liberal Democrat MPs, 19 Labour left wingers and
two SNP MPs to inflict a defeat on the Government by 47 votes to three.
The vote, while embarrassing for the Government, is a constitutional
irrelevance since neither the Labour nor Tory hierarchy took the debate
seriously, and Ministers can point to the fact that only 6% of the House
actually took part in the vote.
There were, however, angry scenes at the end of last night's
six-and-a-half hour debate, in which the Liberal Democrats had called
for a referendum ''before any substantial alteration of the present
constitutional settlement between the European Union and its member
states''.
With both Labour and the Tories officially ignoring the debate, the
SNP had to sacrifice one of its number, Angus East MP Andrew Welsh, as a
teller for the ''No'' lobby, simply to ensure that a vote took place at
all. He was helped by arch Euro-sceptic Tony Marlow, who also wanted to
ensure the vote was recorded.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said after the vote: ''This was yet another
demonstration of parliamentary usual channels at work. It shows the
extent of the collusion between the Tory and Labour parties at
Westminster, which would shock their supporters outside.''
Liberal Democrat spokesman Charles Kennedy said: ''This intriguing
parliamentary victory will be seen as a real vote for common sense by
voters across Britain. We won our victory without any help from the
leadership of the Labour Party.
''This outcome helps build the momentum for an eventual referendum if
the next Intergovernmental Conference has constitutional implications.
We welcome this result and the Government should be forced to accept
it.''
The seven Tories who voted with the Lib Dems were: Mr Vivian Bendall
(Ilford North), Mr Bill Cash (Stafford), Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow),
Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East), Mr
Bill Walker (Tayside North), and Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood).
The three Tories who bothered to vote against the Lib-Dem motion were
Mr Robert Hicks (Cornwall SE), Sir Terence Higgins (Worthing), and Mr
Tim Rathbone (Lewes).
The bitterness spilled over at the close of the debate when Mr Giles
Radice (Lab Durham N) said the Liberal Democrats had not sought to
involve Labour fully with their motion and so were not serious about
defeating the Government.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown bluntly replied: ''The words
were drawn up and there was widespread consultation with other
opposition parties including Labour.
''Labour saw the words, they were given the offer of changing them or
at least suggesting how they might be changed.
''That offer was never taken up. There was never any kind of response
from Labour.''
Earlier, it had been disclosed that the tactics had sparked an
internal Liberal Democrat row.
Winding up for the Government, Junior Foreign Office Minister Tony
Baldry said the Liberal Democrat motion was a ''tawdry and ham-fisted''
attempt to win party political advantage.
He claimed a ''vicious row'' had broken out among the Liberal
Democrats after they had ''lamentably failed'' to ''cobble a deal''
together with the Labour Party to embarrass the Government.
Launching the call for a referendum, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy
Ashdown complained that the debate about Europe among politicians had
excluded the people Europe was supposed to serve.
Mr Ashdown warned: ''Another attempt to take the people of Europe into
a process of further integration, either depending on their ignorance or
against their will, could be fatal to the whole European project.
''Next time, we have to engage our electorates in the debate and carry
them with us.''
Accusing the Tories of being divided ''from end to end'', he said:
''The battleground of Europe has been ceded to a tiny minority of the
Tory Right.''
Europe was far too important an issue to be left to ''an internal spat
in the Conservative Party and the minor mathematics of the Conservative
whips''.
The debate had to be widened beyond the confines of the Conservative
Party to include the public at large, he insisted.
However, the Foreign Office Minister of State, Mr David Davis, accused
the Liberal Democrats of ''political opportunism'' by staging the
debate.
''It is a paradox that we are debating these vital issues on such an
irrelevant motion . . . but characteristic of the Liberal Party,'' he
said.
''The motion calls for a referendum before any substantial alteration
of the present constitutional settlement between the EU and its member
states.
''Such a substantial change would require the assent of every single
member state and it won't get it.''
He said the question of a referendum would not therefore arise.
Pressed by Tory backbenchers and amid some confusion, Mr Davis agreed
with an earlier statement by the Prime Minister that a referendum on a
single currency was not ruled out.
He insisted Ministers would resist any ''centralising'' measures at
next year's crucial intergovernmental conference.

<TEXT>
A YOUNG policewoman wept at the Old Bailey yesterday as she accused a
drunken male colleague of raping her after a ''Toffs and Tarts'' party
at their police lodgings.
PC Michael Seear from Surrey Police was normally ''impeccably
behaved'', the court heard.
But at a New Year party at their section house he turned into an
aggressive violent sex attacker, the 25-year-old WPC alleged.
''I was saying 'What are you doing -- stop it.' He was really weird.
It was like it was not him. His face was strange. It was dark but I
could see his eyes. They did not seem to be focused.
''I was really panicking. I could not understand why he was doing it.
It just seemed so sick,'' the policewoman said.
''He was looking right through me -- it did not seem to register who I
was. I thought he was really going for it. He said 'I am going to f---
you.' I felt he was going to. He said it very aggressively -- like he
really hated me.''
PC Seear, 25, of Lightwater, Surrey, has pled not guilty to raping the
woman on January 1 last year.
He allegedly told her he had been at the ''Toffs and Tarts'' party and
was very drunk, the jury heard.
The WPC said she was sitting in a television room in the early hours
of New Year's Day waiting for her own policeman boyfriend to get ready
for bed when PC Seear asked her to help him back to his room at 2am.
He seemed so drunk she had to support him along the corridor.
''He was zigzagging -- hitting doors as he went. When we got to his
room, I guided him in.
''He just suddenly turned and locked the door. Then he just grabbed me
round the waist and neck and tried to kiss me.
''I turned away and he grabbed my wrist and pulled it behind me and
pushed my neck back. He was biting my neck. I told him to get off and he
just grabbed my breasts and was squeezing really hard.''
She added: ''I took a step backward -- but I could not get away from
him. I stumbled back over the bed and cracked my head against the wall
-- it was a really loud knock.
''The next thing I knew, he was standing over me. I was feeling kind
of funny -- sick in my head. I remember he had his shirt on but he did
not have anything else on.''
The WPC said she saw he was in a state of arousal.
''I was saying 'What are you doing -- stop it.' He did not seem to
hear what I was saying to him.
''All I could think of was that he was on top of me. I tried to get
up. He was pushing me around,'' the policewoman said.
PC Seear had allegedly knelt on her knee and held her wrists ''very
tight''.
''I was very surprised at his strength -- he is not a big guy. I
consider myself very strong and he was drunk, hardly being able to walk,
slurring his speech . . . .
''I was struggling to get up and he grabbed at my body and breasts.''
Asked what he said to her, the officer told the court: ''I really
don't want to say this -- he said he did not believe the size of my
breasts and wondered what they would look like without my clothes on --
but the language was not like that.
The trial continues.

<TEXT>
A COUSIN by marriage of Scottish Transport Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton was banned for 18 months and fined #250 at Haddington
Sheriff Court yesterday for driving with twice the alcohol limit.
Charity organiser Anthony Nigel Buchan-Watt, 48, is husband of
Christine Lillias Drummond-Hay, a cousin of Elizabeth, Dowager Duchess
of Hamilton.
He is the fourth relative of the dowager duchess to have been banned
for drink-driving related offences in the past two years.
Others have included three of her sons, the Duke of Hamilton,
Scotland's premier peer; Lord Hugh Douglas-Hamilton; and Lord Patrick
Douglas-Hamilton.
Her other sons are Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, 52, and Lord David Douglas-Hamilton, 42.
Buchan-Watt was found to have a breath-alcohol level of 82
microgrammes. The legal limit is 35.
He admitted driving with excess alcohol on the Begbie-Westfield road
in East Lothian on February 5. The court heard how he was stopped by
police near his home at Westfield Farm Cottages, near Haddington, during
a routine check.
Procurator-fiscal depute Joan Arnott said that Buchan-Watt had smelled
of alcohol and his condition was confirmed by breath tests.
Defence solicitor John Hetherington said his client had suffered from
migraine attacks since he was a child. He also suffered from depression
and stress.
Buchan-Watt usually had 30 minutes' warning of a severe migraine
attack and had begun to feel unwell while in Haddington.
He had taken a brandy and port to ease his condition and as a last
resort, and in panic, had driven his car in an attempt to get home.
On September 26 last year Lord Patrick Douglas-Hamilton was banned for
10 years and fined #1000 at Haddington Sheriff Court for being in charge
of a car while nearly three times over the blood-alcohol drink limit.
Lord Patrick, 44, a self-employed photographer, of Westfield House,
near Haddington, admitted it was his third offence involving drink and
cars.
He had been changing a burst tyre when caught by police on the A1 near
Tranent, East Lothian, on June 22.
On June 17, 1993, the Duke of Hamilton, 54, whose family seat is at
Lennoxlove, near Haddington, admitted at Haddington Sheriff Court his
fifth drink-driving offence.
He was given 200 hours of community service and an eight-year ban.
On November 11, 1993, the advocate who defended him, Raymond Fraser,
46, was fined #2000 and banned from driving for seven years at
Haddington Sheriff Court on a drinks charge.
Earlier, on February 1, 1993, another of the duke's brothers, Lord
Hugh Douglas-Hamilton, 47, of Begbie Farmhouse, near Haddington, was
fined #400 and banned for 18 months for drink-driving.

AN M77 protester will appear in Glasgow Sheriff Court today after
clashes between demonstrators and security personnel guarding tree
fellers clearing a site at Malletsheugh.
Mr Colin MacLeod, 28, was reported to the procurator-fiscal in
connection with an alleged assault on a security guard at the site in
fields adjacent to Pilmuir Road.
A 45-year-old man was arrested at the same time for allegedly causing
a disturbance, and is also expected to appear in court today.
Two other protesters are currently on remand in Glasgow's Barlinnie
prison, after refusing to accept bail conditions forbidding them from
obstructing or interfering with employees of Wimpey Construction, the
company contracted to build the M77 link.
Mr Paul Murphy, from Langside, and Mr Jake Hunter, who lives at a camp
established in Pollok Estate, are alleged to have committed a breach of
the peace last Thursday at another section of the proposed road.
The pair, together with a 20-year-old woman, Ms Frances Claxton, who
accepted the bail conditions, will go on trial on February 27.
In an earlier incident at the Malletsheugh site yesterday, a protester
claimed he was dragged through a barbed wire fence by a number of
security guards from the company engaged by Wimpey Construction,
Securiguard.
Mr Tam Roy, 35, alleged he sustained a seven inch gash on his right
leg and cuts to his arms when he was removed from the site.
He said: ''I was grabbed in a head-lock and dragged through barbed
wire by about seven of them.''
He also claimed that watching police refused to listen to his
complaint of assault, but instead had warned him.
Mr Roy also alleged that the security guards behaved in an aggressive
manner. He claimed they wore no identification.
A spokesman from the security firm, who refused to give his name,
confirmed his men had removed Mr Roy from a site where trees were being
felled, but insisted they had lifted Mr Roy carefully over any fences
and had not injured him.
The spokesman said: ''About six protesters arrived at the site at
about 8.30am, and one jumped the fence and started trying to interfere
with the sawyers.
''This is an extremely dangerous area, so we decided to remove that
man. Obviously we regret anybody being hurt, but there is no question of
any intent to injure on the part of my men.''
He confirmed that the firm had asked police to intervene, adding: ''We
asked the police to warn the man as he was jumping about and we were
fearful of his safety.''

Members of Lochaber mountain rescue team were in engaged in a race
against time last night to save a climber found alive on Ben Nevis 12
hours after he fell during a 1500ft rock climb on the North-east
Buttress.
Mr Martin Rayner, of Evesham, Worcestershire, had been clmbing with
German-born Sacha Backes, 22, from Swathling, Southampton, who was
rescued earlier yesterday.
Mr Rayner was found still attached to his rope against the ice covered
Orion's Face and is believed to have very serious head injuries.
The rescue team placed him in a stretcher and winched him by rope to
the summit area.
In an incredible feat of endurance they then began to carry the
casualty, who was reported to be seriously ill at that point, off the
mountain.
An RAF Sea King helicopter, which has been standing by at Fort
William, can only fly to a point below the cloud base.
One of the RAF's most experienced rescue pilots, Flight Lieutenant
John Prince was waiting at the controls.
The pilot and crew have been waiting at the West End Car Park in Fort
William ready to take off for the rendezvous point at a moment's notice.
The casualty was expected to be picked up in the helicopter during the
night and taken initially to Belford Hospital at Fort William.
Mr Backes's condition was last night described as stable although a
Belford Hospital spokesman said he was suffering from ''fairly severe
frostbite and hypothermia''.
Meanwhile, hopes of finding 24-year-old Glasgow climber Allan Sands
still alive in the hills above Glencoe were fading last night.
Despite a high risk of avalanche, around 100 rescuers aided by tracker
dogs and a Royal Navy helicopter resumed their search for Mr Sands, a
bookshop manager from Torrisdale Street, Strathbungo, Glasgow.
He has been missing in the White Corries area since Friday, having
left no details of his proposed route.
It is understood he had only been equipped for a day's climb. When Mr
John Grieve, the leader of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team, stood the
search down yesterday afternoon, he said there was little chance of
finding Mr Sands alive after three nights in the mountains.
The father and mother of Mr Sands, Alex and Nancy, arrived in Glencoe
yesterday from their home in East Kilbride. Inspector John MacDonald, of
the Northern Constabulary, said last night: ''The search for Mr Sands
will resume in the morning, but it will be scaled down.''
Neighbours of Mr and Mrs Sands in East Kilbride were last night keenly
following the search for Mr Sands.
They said Mr Sands, an only child, was a graduate of Stirling
University. ''We are all hoping,'' said one. ''Allan is a very pleasant
boy, cheerful and good natured.''
As the Glencoe search was about to begin again yesterday morning a
report was received at Fort William Police Station by radiophone from a
climbers' hut at the foot of the north face of Ben Nevis that two
climbers were in difficulties on the North East Buttress.
Climbers in the hut had heard cries of help coming from the buttress.
The helicopter from HMS Gannet at Prestwick which had been assisting at
Glencoe was diverted to Ben Nevis.
After airlifting three members of the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team on
to the summit of the Ben, the helicopter crew managed to pick Mr Backes
off the face and take him down to safety. Rescue efforts were
subsquently delayed by a false report that another two climbers were
cragfast on the Orion Face.
The rescue team leader, Mr Terry Confield, said: ''Conditions near the
summit were very bad indeed, with high winds and avalanche risks.
''At one point, leading off the summit and into Coire Leis, the snow
was driving so hard we could hardly walk against it.''

A SIX-DAY-OLD baby died from an acute lack of oxygen incurred around
the time of her birth after her mother ''exploded into labour'', a fatal
accident inquiry at Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
Helen Allan was born in the early hours of March 8, 1993, at Aberdeen
Maternity Hospital, Foresterhill, Aberdeen.
Her mother, Mrs Ann Allan, 33, King Street, Aberdeen, told the inquiry
she had received prostin gel as part of her treatment when admitted on
the afternoon of March 7, 1993, 13 days past her expected delivery date.
A decision was taken to induce the birth and she was given the gel to
induce her labour.
Mrs Allan said it took immediate effect and she began to have severe
contractions. She was in severe pain and given diamorphine which
eventually gave her some relief.
She said she had previously been told it would take three or four
hours for the gel to take effect, but she ''exploded into labour'' as
soon as it was applied.
After the baby was born, she was taken away. ''I expected to get her
into my arms but she disapeared,'' said Mrs Allan, adding: ''She was
very grey.''
Mrs Allan said she was told later that Helen was going to die. She
stayed in hospital until the baby died on the morning of March 14.
Dr Paul Duffie, 48, a consultant paediatrician who treated the baby,
told the inquiry he had certified the cause of death as acute lack of
oxygen incurred around the time of her birth, and blood loss.
He told Mr David Burnside, representing Mrs Allan, that the baby's
condition at the time of her birth was such that her death was
inevitable.
Dr Marion Hall, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said that
the policy at the hospital whenever the gel is now administered is for
continuous electronic monitoring throughout the period of labour.
Dr Hall said she was in favour of this change as it could give an
indication of lack of oxygen in the baby and she felt that routine
monitoring was not adequate. She agreed that this case was one of the
reasons which had led to the change.
The inquiry continues.

THE debate over repair plans for Glasgow's storm-damaged Bell's Bridge
rumbled on yesterday, increasing the possibility that the paddle steamer
Waverley could be trapped at her winter berth at Anderston Quay with her
spring programme in jeopardy.
The bridge has remained closed since the December floods when a crack
running for 300 yards appeared in the north bank. As a result the
bridge, which links Glasgow's former garden festival site and the
Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, cannot be swung open.
Glasgow Development Agency, which owns the #1.5m bridge, told SECC
management that yesterday was the deadline for instructing engineers to
repair the structure to allow the paddler to raise steam by March 6 and
move to dry dock in Greenock for the final stages of a #350,000 refit.
The Waverley is scheduled to resume public cruising at Easter.
However, SECC management, which owns the quayside, have refused the
agency access for the repairs until its insurers have given the
all-clear.
The latest row comes less than a week after The Herald disclosed that
the SECC had objected to the continued presence of the bridge in its
present location because it ''affects the integrity'' of the present
site.
Mr Mike Closier, SECC chief executive, said engineers had estimated
that the quayside repairs would cost ''hundreds of thousands of
pounds''.
Engineers have advised him that the damage may have caused ''voids''
underneath the road and pathway running alongside the quayside making
the thoroughfares unsafe for use by the public or heavy plant machinery.
He said: ''We have worked as swiftly as possible to overcome this
problem. It disappoints me that the Waverley could be trapped, but I
would be derelict in my duty to allow works to go on without the
permission of my insurers.
''Perhaps the GDA can come up with some other method of completing
repairs on the bridge within a shorter period to allow the Waverley to
move.''
Waverley Excursions has said any prolonged problems with the bridge
could be disastrous. Captain David Neill said: ''Any delay in leaving
Anderston Quay would seriously jeopardise the viability of the
company.''
A GDA spokesman said it considered repair work to the Bell's Bridge
should be carried out with the ''utmost urgency'' because its continued
closure was a ''major inconvenience'' to a large number of people who
used it.
He said a company was on standby to begin the repairs -- which would
be neither expensive or lengthy -- next Monday.
Permission for the repair work had been sought from Mr Closier who had
been assured that any damage to SECC property caused by repair works to
the bridge would be made good by the GDA. But the spokesman said no
response to the request had been received.
The bridge was built as a temporary feature for the garden festival in
1988.
A spokesman for Clydeport said it had no ongoing responsibility for
the operation and maintenance of the bridge. He said it was a
requirement of navigation on the river that the bridge continued to
open, or otherwise operate, to allow river navigation to the east of the
bridge.

A RESCUE team last night was racing to bring down climber Martin
Rayner, of Evesham, Worcestershire, seriously injured in a fall on Ben
Nevis. But hopes of finding 24-year-old Glasgow climber Allan Sands
alive in hills above Glencoe faded after another fruitless search.

THE proposed M74 link in Glasgow has provoked a huge response, mainly
objections, to the city planning department.
Mr Don Jamie, a chief planning officer for the council, said:
''Batches of mail are arriving every day but already the response stands
at over 350, whilst the final tally could be over 400.''
The official closing date for responses to the Strathclyde Regional
Council's plan was Friday, but it is believed the council will consider
representations from interested individuals and organisations for some
time yet.
The vast majority of reponses are understood to be hostile to the
#200m development.
The planned extension, almost five miles long, which forms the second
phase of the extension of the M74 from the Maryville Interchange at the
south end of the M73 to the M8 at Kingston, is intended to reduce
congestion in the centre and east of Glasgow.
Two churches, seven listed industrial buildings, 100 commercial
properties, and blocks of flats would have to be demolished if the
motorway project received the go-ahead.
Friends of the Earth Scotland has lodged a formal objection.
Its head of research, Dr Richard Dixon, said: ''We are calling on the
councillors of Glasgow to listen to the people and save their city from
a slow death by congestion and pollution by resoundingly rejecting this
proposal.
''The M74 is an out-of-date scheme . . . that is completely at odds
with 90s transport thinking and is no solution to twenty-first century
problems.''
The three-lane motorway could be completed in about five years.

A CHILD who deliberately set fire to an artificial plant has caused a
safety alert throughout Glasgow District Council.
Officials were astonished at the speed and intensity of the blaze
recently in the foyer of an Ibrox block of flats.
They have since ordered that plant containers with artificial material
should be removed from all council premises and such containers will not
in future be installed in any public foyers or corridors.
It is understood that the Health and Safety Executive is to mount a
campaign warning the public of the fire hazard represented by artificial
plants.
The risks inherent in artificial plant material were brought home to
members of the parks and recreation committee yesterday as councillors
watched a video of a demonstration burn carried out by the fire brigade.
Within two minutes of ignition, the material and the plastic container
were burning fiercely and giving off thick black clouds of toxic smoke.
The fire brigade has recommended that artificial plants and planters
should not be installed in escape routes from premises, including
entrances, foyers, staircases, landings, and corridors.
The artificial plant material involved in the Ibrox incident was
supplied by the council's parks department and had been treated with a
fire resistant chemical. This treatment should have been repeated every
three months, but was not maintained after delivery.
A parks department spokesman said the offer of a maintenance contract
had been declined.

TWO boys, aged 13 and 14, were charged last night following a
joyriding crash which left a 27-year-old woman impaled on spiked
railings.
Two other boys, aged 14 and 16, were released on bail by police
pending further inquiries.
Ms Collette Maragh, 27, was thrown in the air and impaled by the neck
after being hit by a car in Harcourt Road, Sheffield, on Sunday.
Passers-by came to her aid until emergency services arrived.
She underwent emergency surgery and remained on a life support machine
in Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital last night.
A spokeswoman said Ms Maragh, who lives in Harcourt Road, was
''seriously ill but stable''.
After she was struck, a car careered through a fence and down a bank
before crashing.
A car had been reported missing from an area of the city about four
miles from the scene of the accident. It narrowly missed a number of
parked cars as it was driven at speed into Harcourt Road at about
2.40pm.
Inspector Tom Walton said a car ''travelled across the road, hitting a
pedestrian on the footpath.
''She was thrown through the air and impaled on some railings around a
commercial property.''
Two boys will appear before Sheffield Juvenile Court today charged
with aggravated taking a vehicle without the owner's consent.
