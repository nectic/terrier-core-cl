JULY milk production showed a drop below profile for the first time
this milk year, which is likely to depress quota sales prices, at least
in the short term, according to the Bruton Knowles National Quota
Exchange. The market remains balanced, with a price of 62.09p a litre.

Patrick Brogan reports that Ross Perot's promise of an 'active role'
in next year's presidential election has raised fears among Republicans
that he could split their vote again and give Clinton another term in
the White House
THEY call themselves the radical centre, or the independents, but
there's no doubt that their hearts are far to the right. Ross Perot is
their hero, and he summoned them to Dallas at the weekend -- and
promised to play an active role in next year's presidential election.
All 11 Republican candidates for the nomination attended the
convention, each hoping to persuade Mr Perot's United We Stand America
movement that he represents their wishes most exactly.
Their great fear is that Mr Perot will run again, as he did in 1992,
split the conservative vote and give Bill Clinton a second term in the
White House.
Mr Perot won 19% of the vote last time, and the polls now suggest he
would get as much again if he runs next year. He was very coy, saying
that being President was ''a hitch in hell'', challenging the two
parties to complete a new Contract with America in the next 100 days. If
they do, he will stand aside. If they don't -- well, watch this space.
His programme has the huge benefit of simplicity: pass a balanced
budget amendment; limit the terms of members of Congress; pass campaign
finance reform; curb the activities of lobbyists in Washington.
All the Republican candidates applauded each of these proposals, and
pretended to believe that enacting them would miraculously resolve all
the nation's problems.
They wouldn't, of course. There is really more to it than that. Some
of them also offered more radical recipes, and the loudest cheers went
to the most extreme of all, Patrick Buchanan, the
journalist-cum-politician whose utterances sound more and more like
those of il duce, Mussolini.
Senator Robert Dole and a few others, including representatives of the
Democratic Party, argued that real reform was perfectly possible in
Washington, given the political will. They were heard in polite silence.
It is very notable that the Republicans are now being tarred with the
same brush as the long-despised Democrats, after a mere seven months in
office. Honesty demands that one concede it is all most unfair. Reform
takes time, a truism that Ross Perot and his ilk are quite unwilling to
admit.
Some of the Republican candidates deserve as much of the blame as the
freewheeling independents for the low esteem in which they are held.
They have been attacking Washington so loudly for so long that they
cannot be surprised when they are themselves blamed for the fact that
people's lives are in no perceptible way better for electing a new
Congress last November. Thus are Messrs Gingrich and Gramm hoist on
their own petard.
Attacking Washington as the root of all evil is an old American
tradition. Generations of reformers have promised to restore a pristine
and more-perfect union. None has ever faced the fundamental cause of
Washington's unresponsiveness to democratic clamour. The fathers of the
constitution were not democrats. They distrusted the passionate
intensity of people like the supporters of Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot
who gathered in Dallas at the weekend.
They devised a system to check the democratic instinct to chop off the
heads of those with unpopular notions.
Newt Gingrich's Contract with America has come to rest in the Senate.
The contract had 10 clauses, several with many subordinate clauses. All
but one passed the House (term limits was the exception), and only one
of the nine remaining has made it through the Senate.
That one reform was making Congress itself liable to the laws, such as
equal employment opportunities, that apply to businesses across the
country. It is more than a little ironic that the Republicans, in fact,
oppose and are often trying to repeal those very rules that they have
now forced Congress (themselves) to obey.
It is more ironic still that the Republican majorities in the two
Houses cannot agree on the other eight items in the contract.
Just before its summer recess, the Senate gave up welfare reform,
which was to be one of the two centrepieces of the Republican agenda.
The other is cutting the budget, and they have yet to grasp the most
poisonous nettle, reducing the costs of Medicare, health insurance for
pensioners.
The radical centre, represented by Ross Perot, see all this and
seethe. The weekend conference in Dallas has been a revelation to
Republicans, and to the rest of the political class. There is no way
that Congress, as presently formed, can enact Gingrich's contract, let
alone Perot's second contract, in the next year.
Which means that Ross Perot has positioned himself perfectly to run
again -- win his 19%, or more, and ensure another four years of the
Clinton presidency and perpetual gridlock in Washington.

HE watches every kick of the ball, with the intensity of a man who is
part of the team. Jack Mulhearn might be called upon at any moment to
take the field as Celtic play out another Premier Division fixture.
But only in the case of serious injury. For Jack's involvement is not
as a player: he is the team doctor, there to deal with any medical
emergency.
Yet Jack Mulhearn might not be a doctor at all if it hadn't been for
an uncle in the same profession. Indeed, he wouldn't necessarily even be
here: his uncle saved his life with the then relatively new drug
penicillin when he fell victim to lymphangitis.
Jack was six at the time, but still remembers the gratitude he felt
towards this highly professional and cheerful man. He decided he would
like to emulate him.
This ambition stayed with him, and after he left St Aloysius College
in Glasgow with seven Highers in 1960, he went on to study medicine at
Glasgow University.
During his six-year course he studied chemistry, physics, biology,
anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry before going into the wards. There
he studied pathology and bacteriology, and this carried on right up to
his fourth year.
Things are a bit different now, with students spending their early
years doing molecules and medicine, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry,
pharmacology and behavioural science, before going into the wards and
doing orthopaedics and rheumatology as well as studying medicine and
surgery.
Then they go on to do geriatrics, psychiatry, dermatology, pathology,
public health, obstetrics and gynaecology, medicine and surgery, and
child health. But one thing has not changed, and that is the 80-hour
weeks expected of junior doctors in residency.
Jack Mulhearn put in his time at Stobhill Hospital, and recalls
falling asleep in chairs. This lasted 18 months and he was paid #7 a
week -- less than half the average wage. The salary has improved in real
terms since then, but the conditions haven't.
After qualifying, he did six months of surgery and six months of
obstetrics and gynaecology before going to Canada to work as a GP for
three years. He returned to Glasgow in 1971 to join his uncle's practice
in the north side and is still there, at the Woodside Health Centre in
Maryhill.
He consults from 9 to 11am, goes on calls until 1pm, lunches in
Ruchill Hospital canteen, is back for surgery between 2 and 6, and
operates a rota system with his partners for evening callouts.
He joined the Territorial Army in 1976 as a Medical Officer and has
travelled to Cyprus, Berlin, and Hong Kong. One famous patient was
Princess Anne, when she was visiting troops in Scotland.
He has done his share of emergencies -- street accidents and other
incidents -- and has twice tended to heart-attack victims on aircraft,
once in mid-Atlantic.
In 1987 he was asked to take over as Celtic doctor by the incumbent,
Dr John Fitzsimons, and this has involved a variety of responsibilities
as well as dealing with the injury and health problems of some of
Scottish football's big names.
''The bottom line is that it is a worthwhile job,'' he says. ''I
greatly enjoy watching families growing up under my care. The doctor is
almost part of the family.
''Quite a few of my patients have got into the way of calling me
Doctor Jack. I like that.''

<HEADLINE>Demand for crisis plan on rail safety</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976879620</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is promising to unveil more evidence today of ''the safety
crisis on the railways'' following the publication yesterday of a leaked
memo claiming a potentially disastrous safety regime at Railtrack.
Labour transport spokesman Mr Henry McLeish has called for the planned
privatisation of Railtrack to be set aside, saying: ''The Government
must put an immediate end to their plans to sell Railtrack off and
instead publish an emergency plan to deal with the safety risks from the
damage already done.''
The release of more details of how safety procedures had collapsed
would ''take the whole issue further and show the very real crisis
facing the industry'', Mr McLeish said.
The leaked memo was prepared for Railtrack's major projects director
Gil Howarth by safety assessment manager Jack Rose. Mr Howarth is
responsible for track renewal and modernisation.
Written last June, the memo claimed the Railtrack safety regime was so
bad that it was possible there could be a repeat of the December 1988
Clapham disaster in which 35 people died.
The memo added that it would take Railtrack 18 months to establish an
effective safety management system and urged the company to take
immediate advice from safety experts.
Mr Howarth said yesterday that a review of safety had been undertaken
since the memo was written and Railtrack was totally satisfied with
procedures.
''Trends over the past three years show that safety has improved on
the railways,'' Mr Howarth said. ''We are constantly improving and
updating safety. This is certainly not a privatisation issue.''
But Labour said it now had proof that privatisation put safety at
risk, while the Liberal Democrats called on Transport Secretary Sir
George Young to ''slam the brakes on the privatisation of Railtrack''.
Rail union, the RMT, said the leaked document showed that
fragmentation of the industry had led to a critical breakdown in the
safety chain of command.
But the Department of Transport defended Railtrack's safety record,
saying the Health and Safety Executive regularly monitored Railtrack's
operations.
The executive said yesterday it had no evidence of any deterioration
on Railtrack's overall safety standards.

''As no quota will be required for the 1996 planting year, it is now

<RECORDNO>976879625</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 35,000 Cheviot lambs from all over the North of Scotland will
be forward for sale at Lairg in Sutherland tomorrow for what remains
Europe's largest one-day sale of sheep.
The pre-sale indications point to quality being excellent, though with
fewer twin lambs born this spring most consigners have less to sell.
The great imponderable, however, remains what sort of prices sellers
can expect and just how keen buyers from all over the UK will be to part
with their cash.
For store lambs the expectation must be that trade will slip back from
last year's very firm level, even though those who bought lambs at Lairg
last August made a decent profit by hitting the prime market at its peak
early in 1995.
Nonetheless, it is the current prime lamb trade that has the greatest
influence on the market and buyers' thinking. Prices at present are near
rock bottom, with a reduced export market and domestic consumption at a
slack level because of the hot weather. People just do not eat lamb when
the sun is shining.
The second factor which will be highly important this year is the lack
of keep. In England many areas are experiencing severe drought
conditions and while Scotland as a whole is not quite in that state,
another dry week will set the alarm bells ringing and make bidders even
more cautious.
Turnip crops look promising throughout Scotland and the north of
England, and one aspect that buyers should perhaps bear in mind is that
there are fewer lambs all over the country this year and that there is
every prospect of a firm export trade later in the year.
For ewe lambs the outlook is equally mixed. The pattern may well have
been set at St Boswells where top half-bred and Cheviot ewe lambs more
than maintained last year's extreme rates -- something which few sellers
or buyers anticipated.
Indeed, a new record price for a pen of 50 half-bred ewe lambs was set
when W Pringle and Son, Yorkston, Gorebridge, sold at #95. Smaller lambs
were more difficult to sell in many instances and were frequently down
by #10 on the year.
This is clearly a reflection of the trade for breeding sheep in
England where the annual Bicester Fair is a reliable benchmark.
Peter Morris, a Midlands based dealer who sells a large consignment at
Bicester each year, said: ''There's not the confidence about, and the
keep situation is dire. My Scotch half-breds were down #17 while the
cross Suffolks and mules were back by about #3.''
So far there are few signs that the changes in the SAP rules are
having any effect on prices, but buyers are clearly willing to pay for
quality and being far more hesitant in bidding for younger and less well
grown lambs.

THEIR ambitions may be to progress from under-21 level to the real
thing, but Scotland's young players are always at their best when there
is serious competitive business to be done and, in that context, the
chances are that the current youthful brigade should be worth watching
when they turn out at Rugby Park tonight against the Greeks.
The Scots are in with a genuine chance of reaching the quarter-finals
of their own European Championship but would need to beat Greece to keep
that ambition alive.
As things stand, they are three points behind Finland in the group
but, with home games against Greece, Finland, and San Marino to come,
they have the way clear to make it into the next stage all by
themselves.
Their coach, Tommy Craig, acknowledges the basic truth that the
under-21s have one major objective, to get into the senior team, but
admits that the prospect of achieving something a wee bit special of
their own will be a motivation that could be vital.
''Ideally, what we want is to achieve both aims,'' he said, ''by
providing Craig Brown with players for the senior pool and, at the same
time, doing something at this level.''
Craig announced a team that included an intriguing central defensive
partnership from Dundee United, Steven Pressley and David Hannah,
although Hannah is more recognisable as a midfield player.
''David is the kind of player you can use with confidence anywhere,''
he said, ''and I have no qualms about playing him alongside his new
club-mate.''
The man who is now assistant to Roy Aitken at Aberdeen is so impressed
by the squad of players in his care that he believes that, whatever
line-up he chooses, he would not be let down.
''We have to change the personnel so much anyway that it has to be
like that. If we can play as we have done in the group so far that will
be enough.''
The coach accepts that the onus now is on Scotland to do the job
themselves. ''People said that the hard bit was beating Greece and
Russia away but, in fact, we now face the really tough part, getting
across the finishing line.''
Craig expects the Greeks to be relaxed, but determined to make amends
for their defeat at home but adds: ''If we set the tone of the match we
can win.''
He is looking for big things from Neil McCann, the Dundee winger.
''Neil came on against the Greeks when the game was finely balanced and
took it by the scruff of the neck. He is in good form according to his
manager and could be a big contributor.'' Team:
Stillie (Aberdeen), McNamara (Dunfermline), Pressley, Hannah (both
Dundee United), Gray (Celtic); Miller (Rangers), Fullarton (St Mirren),
Glass (Aberdeen), McCann (Dundee); Crawford (Raith Rovers), Liddell
(Barnsley).

ABERDEEN goalkeeper Theo Snelders was fined a record #4000 yesterday
then pledged his immediate future to the club.
The Dutchman apologised for refusing to play against Coventry City on
Saturday and insisted that he will honour the remaining year of his
contract at Pittodrie.
But the reason for the pre-match bust-up -- Aberdeen backing out of a
proposed move to Rangers -- still upsets him.
And that will lead to the Dons putting him up for sale when the timing
is right for the club.
That could open the way for another bid by Rangers, who urgently need
back-up for Andy Goram.
Meanwhile, the club have agreed a settlement with former manager
Willie Miller over compensation.
Miller, who was dismissed last February, had threatened to sue for the
#180,000 remaining on his contract.
But a compromise deal has now been worked out to the satisfaction of
both parties.

RANGERS reversed the Ibrox transfer procedure with some style
yesterday when they unloaded unsettled Frenchman Basile Boli to Monaco
in a deal which was worth around #2m to the Glasgow club.
After having splashed out more than #9m on summer imports, manager
Walter Smith sold Boli in a deal which effectively means that Rangers
have brought in Gordan Petric from Dundee United for nothing.
Boli spent most of the season as a misfit in Rangers defence, unhappy
with life in Glasgow, the style of football he had to face in the
premier division, and with his lot as a whole.
Now, Rangers have sent him back to France and while some of the fine
detail has still to be worked out, the Ibrox side must be happy that
this brief episode has ended.
Yesterday Boli said: ''It is tremendous for me to return to France and
to a top club. That is what I have wanted to do throughout the summer. I
wanted to win a championship medal in Scotland and did so.
''Now, I want to win another French championship medal, this time with
Monaco. This is where I will be happy.''
The deal has just beaten the French signing deadline and Boli will now
concentrate on a rebirth of his career in France at domestic and
national levels.
Meanwhile, Russian Oleg Salenko was granted his work permit and can
now play for the Ibrox club.
And, if Rangers reach the Champions League, then Salenko will be
eligible for these matches.
* EVERTON'S hopes of completing the #5m transfer of Andrei Kanchelskis
in advance of tonight's European Cup-winners' Cup registration deadline
appear unlikely to be realised.
Manchester United director and club solicitor Maurice Watkins had
flown out to the Ukraine on Sunday for talks with the winger's former
club, Shaktyor Donetsk, in a bid to reach a compromise over their claims
to a #1.1m cut of the fee.
But Watkins returned to Britain yesterday without any conclusion to
the saga being in sight.
United club spokesman Ken Ramsden explained: ''Maurice had two
meetings with officials at Donetsk on Sunday, but returned because he
felt there was nothing to be gained by staying on.
''The situation has not been resolved at this stage and, although his
meetings with the Ukrainians were amicable, it was felt that the next
moves could be made from home.''
If there is no resolution to the matter, it seems certain that
Kanchelskis -- still officially registered as a United player although
he has made it clear he will not play for the Old Trafford club again --
will not be available to Everton for the first round of their
Cup-winners' Cup campaign next month.
* NAPOLI'S Colombian striker Freddy Rincon signed a three-year
contract with Spanish champions Real Madrid yesterday for an undisclosed
fee.

SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle will be handing over one of the biggest cheques
ever issued by a Scottish company tomorrow afternoon when its pays
Fosters Brewing Group #425m for its Courage subsidiary.
Competition and Consumer Affairs Minister Jonathan Evans yesterday
gave the all-clear after S &amp; N agreed undertakings covering three
aspects of the future conduct of the business. In return, Mr Evans
decided that the deal should not be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission as had been called for by others in the brewing
industry.
On August 4, Mr Evans said he would consider accepting the S &amp; N
undertakings but asked interested parties for their representations on
the text but not their substance. Three replies were received.
The stipulations can be considered as being almost trifling and a
cheap price to pay for gaining such a valuable asset as Courage with
both its substantial range of first-class brands and brewing capacity
with the associated distribution.
The conditions are as previously indicated in that the Edinburgh-based
company will have reduced the number of pubs in its tied estate by 115
to 2624 within one year. That presents little real problem as there are
a number of poorly performing outlets in the estate.
S &amp; N will not be allowed to increase its estate above this lower
figure until there is a review in three years at the company's request.
The third requirement is that around 1000 IEL pubs be released early
from the beer supply agreement with the now to be formed Scottish
Courage. Again that would indicate poorer quality pubs are involved in
that process.
S &amp; N has appointed its beer division chairman Guy Dickson as chairman
of Scottish Courage. He will spend the next few weeks on creating a
business plan to integrate the two operations. Later this week, he will
announce the membership of the Scottish Courage board.
There is speculation as to what will happen elsewhere in the industry.
There are rumours that Bass may try to buy the brewing division of
Whitbread now that that has spent #180m on purchasing 16 Marriott hotels
and has made an agreed #200m bid for the David Lloyd Leisure group. Also
Allied Domecq's Carlsberg-Tetley division seems to be up for grabs.
S &amp; N must consider itself fortunate that it has managed to acquire
Courage in just under three months without enduring the uncertainty and
delay that would have been involved in an MMC investigation.
Approval of the deal had been widely anticipated in the City and S &amp; N
shares eased 4p to 598p.

<HEADLINE>Bradford &amp; Bingley plan a loyalty bonus scheme</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>22</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976879630</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LOYALTY bonus scheme for members amounting to hundreds of pounds
every five years is being planned by Bradford &amp; Bingley Building
Society.
The society said yesterday the scheme would apply to savers and
borrowers but details had not yet been finalised.
Market growth is likely to continue to be slow over the next few years
and because excess reserves are also set to rise, the society believes
they should be distributed to long-standing members.
''Market research clearly shows that the majority of building society
members are supporters of the concept of mutuality,'' said chief
executive Geoffrey Lister.
''We strongly believe that members should be rewarded for their
loyalty to Bradford &amp; Bingley and we are planning to pay special bonuses
to long-standing members who maintain a reasonable level of either
savings or borrowings in the future.''
He added: ''We expect that other building societies who also believe
in the benefits of mutuality will follow our lead.''
The plan involves qualifying members receiving a discretionary bonus
linked to the society's overall performance, by reducing its retained
profit to a lower level than in the past.
''We expect that for our most loyal and valued members, this could
amount to hundreds of pounds every five years. It is thus a continuing
reward for loyalty rather than a one-off payment.''
The bonus, which would have to be cleared with the industry regulator,
is seen as an alternative to turning the society into a public company
and a defence against a possible takeover.

SOUTH Western Electricity is confident of fending off a takeover offer
from the American utility company Southern Electric International after
an English rival pulled out of merger talks late on Friday.
Sweb's neighbour Southern Electric, based in Maidenhead, Berks, called
off negotiations because of the continuing regulatory uncertainty after
announcing hours earlier it would consider bidding at least
#10-per-share.
Maurice Warren, chairman of Bristol-based Sweb, yesterday said: ''The
terms of over #10 per Sweb share confirmed our analysis that the offer
of #9 per share by the Southern Company of the US significantly
undervalues Sweb.
''We are confident that the proposals we are currently developing will
significantly enhance shareholder value as an independent company.
''I will write to shareholders shortly with details of these
proposals. In the meantime, shareholders should take no action and not
allow Sweb to be bought on the cheap.''

THE BIG question shareholders of Argos want to know is what the
catalogue retailer is going to do with its fast-growing cash mountain.
This has increased further in the first half of the year, during which
Argos raised profits by 34% to #21.8m despite a flat retailing climate.
Margins widened a touch on like-for-like sales growth of 7.2%.
The cash pile has reached #195m and climbing fast. There was some
disappointment in the stock market, with the shares 5p off at 483p, that
Argos had not decided to hand part of it back to shareholders as a
special dividend or use it to buy back equity. The interim dividend is
increased by 51% to 4p but this is partly to rebalance it relative to
the final.
Chief executive Mike Smith was coy about what they would do with the
cash. The group is on the lookout for acquisitions but has had no luck
so far either because the proposed purchases did not add value or were
not available. He would not indicate how they would spend the cash if
acquisitions could not be found.
However, Argos does have plans for the existing business, though they
will not absorb much cash. Seven traditional outlets have been opened
and seven more have been converted to carry the full superstore range. A
further 15 outlets have been refurbished and by the end of the year a
total of 367 stores will be trading.
The group has begun a trial linking eight to 10 stores to enable stock
to be transferred between them to meet demand. It has started a wedding
list service and intends to test a mini-store offering the full range of
goods on an order and collect basis.

I WRITE to endorse the reporting by Iain Wilson of a projected
reduction of the Scottish labour force from 1994 to 2006 and your
editorial, Faith in the Future (August 12).
Table 8 of the 1991 census reported a Scottish labour force of
2,407,188. Since 27% of the workforce (660,338) were unemployed or part
time (under- employed), the decrease in the Scottish labour force is
fuelled by Scots leaving their country to seek jobs elsewhere.
Table A of the 1991 census highlights Scotland's nightmare (a
population which has not increased since 1891 with a decrease of 3.3%
since 1981). The real decrease is 15.7% since table 50 shows that 12.4%
of the 1991 population (612,397) were born outwith Scotland.
The real loss in population from 1981 to 15.7% of 5,130,735 (805,525)
plus 60,000 (natural increase). With a reasonable economy since 1981,
the population of Scotland in 1994 would be just under 6,000,000.
I am intensely saddened at the continuous destruction of the Scottish
economy since 1707.

LIKE many Scottish hillwalkers my experience nowadays is that solitude
is often difficult to find on the Scottish hilltops, especially the
Munros.
Yet in brilliant sunshine at the peak of the holiday period, I walked
for eight hours over four Munros in the Central Highlands without
meeting or seeing in the distance another living soul.
These were not the most exciting of hills, but the flowers, birds, and
views, including spots of snow still lying on several surrounding peaks
made it a day to remember.

IN his interview Alex Salmond makes it clear that the SNP has no
intention of backtracking on its European commitment (August 7). He also
makes it perfectly clear that he has no intention of giving the Scottish
people an honest assessment of what is at stake and that he will
continue to use the language of sophistry and misrepresentation.
Despite the very serious questions which are being raised about the
whole concept of integration in the EU, at every level of understanding
throughout the member states of the EU, Mr Salmond sees only two sides
of the debate, the so-called pro and anti-Europe positions.
According to Mr Salmond there are good and bad currencies per se, with
the UK's described as ''disastrous''. He seems to believe that the
strength or weakness of a currency bears no relationship to the
performance of the economy for which it is the unit of exchange.
In Mr Salmond's world currencies are no more than virility symbols
with smaller countries free from the virility fetishes of their larger
neighbours.
That is a fatuous statement to make but no more so than, ''To a small
country there is never the illusion that having an independent currency
is associated with being an independent state''. In other words,
''independence'' as defined by Mr Salmond and the SNP now means that any
state's economic policy can be determined by any other state without any
loss of political freedom or independence. Why then bother to take
Scotland out of the UK?
Mr Salmond is correct when he says that UK interest-rate policy cannot
be isolated from German interest-rate policy, but neither can it be
isolated from US interest-rate policy, no more that the UK, Germany or
the USA can be isolated from what is happening in Japan.
Should all four of these major players in the world economy abandon
their currencies?
Denmark, Switzerland, and Norway are all too obvious examples of where
Mr Salmond's theory begins to fall down.
Mr Salmond is quick to condemn other party leaders for their
willingness to ditch principles and for their facility for being
economical with the truth. It is increasingly obvious that he is a fully
paid-up member of the club.

PRESS coverage of VJ-Day has given well-merited attention to the
sufferings of British ex-POWs under the Japanese. Many column inches
have also rightly been devoted to the moral implications of the atom
bomb.
Regrettably, little or nothing has been said about the achievements of
the 14th Army in Burma, which, starting with the battle of Kohima in
April-May 1944, and ending with the capture of Rangoon in May, 1945,
repelled the last great Japanese offensive of the war.
It seems that the Forgotten Army is still forgotten.
The Burma campaign of 1944 and 1945 was a fair and square encounter
between two highly professional armies, locked in mortal combat. There
was no carpet-bombing of cities. Every inch of territory was gained or
lost by foot soldiers.
There were three Japanese armies in Burma, totalling over 300,000 men,
when the decision was taken to invade India in 1944. While the 14th
Army, consisting of three corps, was mainly made up of Indian regiments,
there were many British regiments who fought alongside their Indian
comrades.
One entirely British division bore the brunt of the epic Kohima
battle.
In remembering today, 50 years later, what was mainly an
American-Japanese war, we in Britain should not fail to remind ourselves
that British troops played an honourable part in the Japanese defeat.
Their achievements were overshadowed by events in Europe and the
Pacific. Burma was a sideshow in an global war.
But a campaign in which more than 30 British battalions were engaged;
in which more than 20,000 British troops were killed or wounded; and in
which British soldiers gained the respect of their former Japanese
enemies, should be more than a footnote to history.

I WONDER how many of your readers -- ex-wartime sailors -- have
watched the BBC programme euphemistically called Brilliant, and wondered
what has happened to the Service they knew, hated at the time, and
learned to love in retrospect.
I was reminded of the running war between the ''regulars'' and us
''hostilities only'' sailors which was satisfactorily won in my ship
when a fellow officer made the telling point, ''You lot are OK shooting
at targets, but who do you come for when the targets start shooting
back?''
After watching the programme I found myself hoping that their
Lordships of the Admirality had a fall-back plan in the event of targets
becoming pro-active again.

I WRITE to say how much I agree with D J Macleod's letter on the
problem of pavement cyclists (August 10). On two occasions this week I
had to take evasive action from adult cyclists as I walked on the
pavement.
I have no objection to very young children using the pavement but I
take very strong objection to adults or near adults monopolising
pavements set aside for pedestrians.
It is surely time now that the local authority or the police were
coming forward with some regulations regards this growing problem.

D J Macleod criticises cyclists who ride on pavements (August 10). The
Glasgow Cycling Campaign cannot condone this behaviour but does
understand why cyclists' desire to survive can cause them to detour on
to pavements.
For the past four years we have been pressing local authorities and
the roads department to build a safe, dedicated cycling infrastructure
that separates cyclists from cars and pedestrians. We want to see cars
on roads, bikes on cycle lanes, and pedestrians on pavements.
But unless the pavement is really wide and has very low pedestrian
use, we are opposed to shared use by pedestrians and cyclists -- it is a
cheap, unsafe compromise that relegates cyclists and pedestrians to the
bottom of the transport agenda.

D J MacLeod deserves some support, and he has mine, wholeheartedly
(August 10). The practice of cyclists, young and old, using the
pavements has become an increasing danger.
Not only is one at risk as a pedestrian but there is a fear of a
collision as one's car emerges from a drive on to the road.

IT really will not do for Jim Arnold, director of New Lanark
Conservation Trust to try to make a joke of the plight of those like M J
Stewart trying to visit New Lanark by public transport.
No-one makes a joke of those who arrive by private transport, they
have signs all the way from the motorway, 20 miles away, and vast new
car parks at New Lanark.
Lanark has a textbook example of train-bus interchange except there
has been no bus information for many years -- no timetables, no
indication of where buses go to or from which stance.
Because buses come into the bus station visitors think that eventually
the New Lanark bus will appear. It does not. It drives past the bus
station entrance without stopping.
There is a tourist information office not far away but it is not
visible or signposted from the station and it is in the opposite
direction, away from the town, than would expect.
The fact is that the bus interchange should have information for
travellers to all directions.
Where others have failed, surely the New Lanark authorities could
provide some information notices at the station for these would-be
customers. If New Lanark wishes to dismiss visitors arriving by public
transport, they should perhaps lose their public funding and world
heritage status.

FORTH Ports confirmed yesterday that it was still in the running to
buy the port of Dundee, despite the withdrawal of a rival, after Dundee
Port Authority cut its 1995 profit forecast by a third.
''There is no change in position as regards Forth Ports' bid,'' a
spokesman for the Leith-based company said.
Clydeport, which teamed up with the management of Dundee port to
launch its own bid, declined to say whether or not it still hoped to buy
the trust port from the Government.
John Sutcliffe &amp; Son, which owns the port of Boston in Lincolnshire,
said at the weekend it had withdrawn its own bid for Dundee after
learning that the port's profit forecast for 1995 had been cut from
#940,000 to about #600,000.
A fourth company, which has not been publicly identified, also
submitted a preliminary bid for Dundee in June.
The deadline for final bids was August 4. Dundee Port Authority is
expected to recommend a preferred buyer to the Secretary of State for
Transport later this month.
Analysts predicted that Dundee would sell for up to #20m before its
profit forecast was revised downwards halfway through the privatisation
process.

VENTURE capital firm 3i has invested #300,000 in Flexco Packaging, a
new Livingston-based company that prints short runs of high-quality
packaging for the food industry.
The 3i investment complements #2m of equity raised by Flexco managing
director Graham Morgan and other board members of the company when it
was founded in January.
Flexco specialises in manufacturing packaging for items such as
snacks, frozen foods, and bakery goods. It is aiming for turnover of
#750,000 in its first year of operation.
Mr Morgan said the company uses a new American CI press which brings
high-quality printing to what has traditionally been a ''down and
dirty'' sector of the food packaging market.
Flexco presently employs 10 people but a second printing press is on
order and the company hopes to raise its staff to 30 within three years.

AIRTOURS, Britain's second largest tour operator behind Thomson with
First Choice in third spot, is forecasting a 25% reduction in profits in
its current financial year to September.
The company warned in June when reporting a first-half seasonal loss
of #34.9m that poor weather was not prompting any rush of holidaymakers
to the sun. That was worrying for the company at the time.
But the prolonged heatwave has added to its concern and that of the
industry generally. Certainly Airtours is suffering as it spelt out
clearly yesterday. But while hot summers come and go, the pressure on
margins which the company, and undoubtedly the industry, is experiencing
smacks of something more fundamental given that it was well signposted
earlier in the year before the heatwave struck.
Demand has been flat all summer and an already weak market has been
exacerbated by the weather. Airtours has managed to maintain its UK
market position but despite capacity reductions, it cannot avoid the
general pressure on prices and consequently profits. Going Places, the
group's retail arm, has also suffered a decline in profitability.
While the broad spread of its operations has mitigated the full impact
of the decline with Scandinavian Leisure Group to trade well above
expectations and Sunwing hotels enjoying strong market conditions, the
overall message is gloomy. And if Airtours is suffering, so must other
holiday tour operators. A further reduction in overall capacity must be
on the cards for next year.
David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, said about half a million
package holidays, from a total of 10 million on offer, remain unsold,
depressing the price of late bookings by about 11%, the equivalent of
about #30 off prices offered last summer.
He considers that by next year operators are likely to reduce capacity
by about one million aircraft seats in an effort to get a better balance
between demand and supply.
Airtours is, though, not just sitting back as the UK holiday tour
market contracts and becomes increasingly competetitive. The dismal
message on profits was accompanied by the acquisition for #37.6m of
Sunquest Vacations, one of Canada's largest tour operators.
Sunquest is described as a ''highly attractive'' business which has
been enjoying a period of strong growth since the current senior
management team was brought together in 1992/93.
It will reduce Airtours' seasonality and dependence on the UK market.
In the year ending April 30, 1995, Sunquest carried 270,000 passengers
and made a pre-tax profit of $C7.7m (#3.6m) on a turnover of $C197.8m
(#92.3m).
Britain's tour operators tend to go through boom and, if not exactly
bust, certainly lean periods. With the current lack of relative
enthusiasm from the British consumer, presumably another aspect of the
lack of the ''feel-good'' factor, the industry is appears to be going
through the latter.
Looking ahead, it cannot count on a sudden reversal of fortune and
overcapacity clearly remains a problem. Airtours is probably as well
situated as any to cushion the impact and its Canadian purchase looks a
sensible move. It is a difficult time for the industry which has little
appeal at present.

THE couple had talked a lot. Looked at the possibilities of a
meaningful relationship. Had one or two trial dates. But, always, the
moment of truth.
''Do you have any doubts about us doing this together'' Yo-Yo Ma
finally says. And happily for the rest of us Mark Morris didn't. The
resultant collaboration had its premiere at the Edinburgh Film Festival
last night. Falling Down Stairs, filmed by Rhombus International, is the
result of Morris choreographing Ma's interpretation of Bach's third
cello suite, and takes us from their early meetings through the creative
process to the final extraordinary product where the dancers seem to
have acquired volume control while the cellist becomes an integrated
part of the choreography.
Creatively, given Morris's own musical passions, it was a marriage
likely to be crafted in the cultural heavens, but in truth the
conversational sequences are just as riveting as the dance.
Yo-Yo Ma is involved in five more collaborations featuring the Bach
Cello Suites with which he enchanted the audience at Greyfriars Kirk
yesterday afternoon. In fact two of his future co-conspirators were in
town to hear the maestro at work. Stand by (no kidding) for Yo-Yo Ma and
Torvill and Dean.

ACTORS! When do they ever come up with an honest CV. The Condor
vulture given the lead role in the new Edinburgh Festival TV advert may
not have lied about his wingspan (some 12ft if you ruffle his feathers
up the wrong way) but frankly my dear I do think the client needs to
know that you only have one eye.
Festival marketing director Joanna Baker had been quite taken with the
concept as outlined by the ad agency to have the bird giving a literal
interpretation of a culture vulture by pecking to bits a Festival
programme.
And she was fascinated to learn that the vulture's pash for culture
was to be ensured by smearing some raw chicken all over the brochure. So
she made a state visit to the filming which is when she first clocked
the fact that our big beaked boy was somewhat deficient in the peepers
department.
Not to worry, said the agency man. We're only shooting his good side.
* * *
TO lunch with the delightful Marsha Hunt, briefly in town to present
the inaugural SAGA award at the Book Festival which she devised to
recognise the work of black British writers. This time last year she was
here with Joy which she co-wrote with her daughter Karis, who also
directed. And this time last year she had put on 40lb to give her more
credibility in the role.
Now, damn her, she's back to her impossibly slender and infuriatingly
glamorous self.
The secret of shedding the surplus stones will gladden hearts in
Fochabers. It seems that Marsha quit breakfast, had a modest soup and
salad lunch and allowed herself a nightly treat of two glasses of red
wine to compensate for dinner being steamed vegetables. But hey, she
found a way to make steamed vegetables seem sexy. She hit the local
supermarket every week for supplies of certain speciality soups and
poured them over in lieu of a calorie-infested sauce. Baxters of
Fochabers by appointment to Marsha, pure dead gorgeous, Hunt. That
should shift a few cans.
* * *
NOW here is a strange thing, is it not? Mr Roy Hattersley, among other
scribblers of note, was asked to appear at the Book Festival's Six of
the Best Series where authors describe half a dozen books which have
altered their lives. Like the rest he supplied the Festival with a list
of titles so they could ensure they would be to hand as he strutted his
literary stuff.
The fiction titles on the list were Wuthering Heights, The Old Wives
Tale, and Silas Marner. That was the first list. Suddenly a second
missive arrived. And this time the fictional faves had metamorphosed
into Brideshead Revisited, The Great Gatsby and Far From the Madding
Crowd.
Well for heavens sakes it's a politician's privilege to change his
mind. After all Hatters used to like Tony Blair.
* * *
SO the Three Graces came to the capital. Cossetted beyond belief in
custom-built packaging. And that level of care did not cease on arrival.
Curators at the National Gallery were observed cleansing the cleavages
with cotton wool buds. Well, you can't be too careful with the most
viewed buttocks in town.
* * *
BUT while the director of the Scottish Galleries in Edinburgh dallied
with his Canovian lovelies, the Glasgow Galleries director indulged in
his own idiosyncratic daud of one up-personship. Julian and Gillian
Spalding's party had everything, and since they have a garden on their
roof, they naturally felt obliged to acquire a fiddler for the occasion.
If one may so describe Mr Lev Atlas, principal viola player with
Scottish Opera.

THE artfully arranged objects on stage greeting Hidden Dragon
Theatre's audience seemed at first glance to have all the hallmarks of
that quirky European physical theatre tradition, best known in this
country from the early work of Theatre de Complicite. Those slightly
kitsch spindly gilt clothes rails, the single white espresso cup, the
battered suitcase, the plastic monkey that squeaks when you squeeze it.
But it was all just a little too clean, too tidy, too ordinary.
Despite some pretty impressive face pulling and posture striking, the
piece lacks either the idiosyncratic quirkiness or cruelly grotesque
weirdness to engage the audience. It's a hard task to create arresting
and atmospheric theatre from the most minimal of means. In this case,
less was just less.

WILL Gaines has nifty, nimble feet and a tongue to match. While the
feet shuffle and tap their way through a host of syncopations, the
tongue talks its way through a series of anecdotes. In under an hour,
you get history as well as amusement.
Backing him -- though he's well able to make music with his own feet
-- is a trio of jazz musicians (drums, bass and saxophone) who help
create the impression that, while it's afternoon outside, it's around
midnight in here and everything's hanging cool and loose.
Gaines has been hoofing for almost half a century and next year will
be his tenth Fringe stint -- he's already talking about the party!

JACK Shepherd's play for the One Tree Company is like an early
work-out for a Mike Leigh drama. Convincingly site-specific in the
Pleasance Cabaret Bar, it begins as a jazz band arrives at the back of
the room, and ends, after a good deal of argument, banter and a
three-song set, when it leaves the same way.
Shepherd's characterisation -- drawn from his experience on the jazz
circuit -- is generally well-observed, from his own portrayal of a
cantankerous middle-aged pianist to Jim Bywater's drugged-up drunk to
Mary Rutherford's alarming landlady on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
But it could be half the length without losing its insights into
mid-life crisis and white-man's guilt. Less a play than an outpouring.

YOU just don't see theatre of this quality and texture coming from
Britain. Kiev Theatre is one of those large East European ensemble
companies -- not unlike Poland's Wierszalin in the way the actors remain
on stage throughout, gathering round in choral response to the events of
the play -- and its treatment of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment is
as serious as it is accessible and imaginative.
Particularly endearing -- and typically generous -- is the company's
decision to produce a bilingual production for Edinburgh, giving us both
the resonant beauty of the Russian tongue, and the literal sense behind
so much angst and anguish at an increasingly indifferent society.
If it looks a little impoverished on the narrow studio stage, it
swiftly compensates with beautiful singing, heart-felt performances and
moments of chilling theatricality.

IT'S not often you get a chance to win in life, never mind a trip to
New Zealand, or #500, or some champagne. Which is the main reason I am
entering this competition, because it is probably the only chance I'll
get of going back to the land of the long white cloud, and the only
chance I'll have of getting to sip champagne and spend 500 quid.
Mind you, I honestly never wanted to be a selector.
Besides, if you're the kind of person who likes competition, and we
all need the odd challenge in life, now is the time to enter.
We may not be able to play anymore, but nobody said that dreaming was
a bad thing. When it comes to dream teams it would be hard to beat one
that included the likes of John Jeffrey and Finlay Calder, Ian
McLauchlan, and Sandy Carmichael, or Andy Irvine and Jim Renwick, but
sadly they don't play anymore.
Despite that, picking the right blend from the list below should not
present too many problems, and they will all be in action in a week's
time as the most compact and competitive league season in Scottish
history gets underway.
My way of doing it will be to start with my kicker, then pick wingers
-- those little glory boys grab many of the points -- followed by a
scrum half, the back row, my centres, and the rest of the pack.
The sending off bit could cause a few problems and there are some
chaps I won't be picking for legal reasons but there you have it.
Your way of going about it will undoubtedly be completely different
but we're all aiming to get the same result, which is flying free to New
Zealand, partaking of some bubbly, putting all of the winnings on some
unknown nag in next year's Grand National, but above all having some fun
as the winter progresses, the smell of freshly cut grass and liniment
assail our nostrils, and the rugby season gets into full swing.
It is going to be a good year for rugby, I can tell, and a good trip
to New Zealand for some. Lessons in the haka can be bought for a small
price.

SCOTTISH carpet maker Stoddard Sekers International is having bad luck
with the weather. Heavy winter rain caused #1.1m of flood damage at its
Kilmarnock factory, for which the company was not insured. Now the
bone-dry summer has led to a spectacular slump in carpet sales that will
dent half-year profits.
Chairman Hugh Laughland told Stoddard Sekers's annual meeting in
Elderslie near Paisley yesterday that there had been ''a significant
worsening in general market conditions'' since the company published its
1994/95 results in June.
Stoddard Sekers had anticipated some loss in revenue from the expiry
of a contract worth #3m a year to supply seat coverings to the Ford
motor company.
But Mr Laughland said this had been aggravated by high summer
temperatures that had put people off buying carpets altogether.
''The very hot weather over recent weeks has further diverted consumer
spending away from household goods such as carpets,'' he said,
forecasting ''an adverse impact on the first half result''.
Stoddard Sekers shares dropped 4[1/4]p to 26[3/4] in reaction to his
comments.
Chief executive Ralph Ellis said after the annual meeting that sales
fell 5% in May, June, and July, the first quarter of Stoddard Sekers's
current financial year.
But sales slumped by 20% in July as Britain sweated through its
hottest summer in 19 years, he added.
''We almost saw a situation where demand fell over the cliff,'' Mr
Ellis said, pointing out that carpet shops throughout the UK were
virtually empty of customers.
He put a brave face on the situation, saying pent-up demand should be
released later in the year when carpet sales are traditionally higher.
The chief executive predicted that full-year results would be similar
to those of 1994/95, when Stoddard Sekers made a pre-tax profit of #2.3m
on turnover of #60.9m.
''I would not expect our year-end situation to be worse,'' he said.
Mr Ellis noted that in addition to the hot dry summer, the carpet
industry was suffering from a slump in the housing market and the lack
of a ''feel good'' factor among consumers generally.
Stoddard Sekers, which claims about 10% of the UK retail market for
off-the-shelf carpets, is trying to revive sales by developing new
product ranges and new promotion schemes for its retailers.
Mr Ellis said the outlook for contract sales of specially made carpets
for the likes of hotels, cruise ships, and conference centres was
brighter.
''I think the biggest growth will be in contract carpets and
exports,'' he said, noting that contract carpets account for 40% of
group sales.
Stoddard Sekers is investing #600,000 in a new loom for its BMK
factory in Kilmarnock which will increase its capacity to manufacture
contract carpets and enable it to weave more complex carpet shapes.
The group, which reduced its debt gearing from 44% to 31% last year,
is also on the look-out for new acquisitions.
''We would want to take on niche products and perhaps something in
(upholstery) fabrics, where we would like to be a bit bigger,'' Mr Ellis
said.

JEAN ANOUILH'S retelling of the Joan of Arc story manages to twin
emotional commitment with intellectual distance. He plunges you into the
dramatic heart of this most romantic of saints, only to pull you out
again as his actors comment on how the narrative is progressing.
Most of this Cambridge University cast managed the witty transition of
style without losing the story's exhilarating pain. But it is
undoubtedly Justine Waddell, as Joan, who gives the production its life.
Despite moments of overburdened theatricality, she gives The Lark all
the passion necessary to set off Anouilh's cleverness. You feel she is
laying herself on the line for this one. The guts of her performance
fills out a play that is a small masterwork of both storytelling and
intellectual comment.

MAM's dead but, being a right nosey bugger, is hanging around for the
wake, eavesdropping in on the argey bargey between her daughters
Katherine and Barbara in this wickedly black comedy which encapsulates
sibling rivalry, family frustrations, and the dislocation of returning
to a home you've emotionally as well as physically vacated long ago.
Janet Dibley -- Elaine in telly's The Two of Us -- is garishly
strident as the bitter, common-as-muck-and proud-of-it Katherine, while
Lesley Clare O'Neill exudes weary defensiveness as the career-oriented
Barbara. Deidre Costelle, resplendent in Bet Lynch glam, oversees their
quarrels with disinterested languour but the audience is soon absorbed
by this briskly scripted, well-performed piece.

THIS week's tip comes from Bill Bennett, the professional at Alloa
Golf Club.
GOLF TIP
A COMMON fault with handicap golfers is a lack of shoulder turn on the
follow-through. The tendency is to assume it's all over at the point of
impact. The elbows bend -- causing the arms, wrists, and hands to travel
upwards in a shallow swing plane.
The most common outcome is a topped shot, or one that goes low and
left.
So what is the cure? A good drill is to imagine you are standing in a
shop doorway with the shutter down to shoulder height (a length of rope
tied between two objects also can help).
Make a slow, three-quarter backswing and then, on the downswing,
concentrate on turning the shoulders completely through the shot. Use
the shutter (or rope) as a guide to check your position on the
follow-through.
Stop the club just before reaching the shutter, and make sure that the
arms are straight (but not locked at the elbows) with the club pointing
slightly skywards with a full shoulder turn.
If you are plagued by the ''elbow crumpling'' fault, you will have hit
the shutter before completing the shoulder turn.
So remember, don't just turn the shoulders on the backswing -- a full
turn is required even after the ball has been struck.

COURSE records always are liable to be broken, but a rash of them over
the last month suggests something strange is afoot. In that period more
than 10 which have been reported in various corners of the sports pages,
not least of all Tom McKeown's amazing nine-under-par 59 over Milngavie.
Over the weekend, Scottish amateur champion Simon MacKenzie carded a
record nine-under-par 63 at Leven on his way to winning to Standard Life
Gold Medal, Scottish cap Alison Rose claimed the women's record at
Dumfries and Galloway, a five-under-par 65, as she won the Mary McCallay
Trophy, and Colin Fraser set a new mark of 63 at Peebles in the Borders
Autumn Meeting.
The spell of fine weather is the obvious reason, and to confirm this
we asked the doyen of Scottish amateur golf, Charlie Green, who has held
records at Turnberry, Troon, Glasgow Gailes, and Windyhill among others.
''The present conditions have made courses as easy as you are going to
get them,'' he said.
''There is not much in the way of wind, you have running fairways, and
if greens are well-watered, then low scoring is always possible. On
running fairways, if you slightly mishit an iron shot, the ball is still
going to run, and if you hit it right it is going to land on the green
and stop -- so you have two ways of getting on.''
Green's point about iron play being the key is one that holds true for
Peter Robertson's record 63 over Bothwell Castle. He credited accurate
iron play which left him with few long putts to hole.
McKeown's 59 was recorded in qualifying for the Dumbartonshire
matchplay championship, and broke the previous Milngavie record, which
had stood for 27 years, by five shots. Likewise, fine iron play was the
main cause.
The 37-year-old joiner, who is now down to scratch, was out in
six-under-par 28. Birdies at the first three came from putts of four
feet or shorter on excellent putting surfaces, then he eagled the fifth
with the longest holed putt of the round, 20 feet. There were four more
birdies from putts of 12 feet or less.
He was using balata balls which didn't give a great deal of run, but
was still hitting No.8 or No.9 irons into many of the greens. ''I would
say that record scores are more likely during a combination of dry
weather and good greens, especially good greens,'' he said. ''In my case
I was so relaxed being so far ahead so early unlike a previous round
when I had a fighting chance to break the record but shot 65.''
At Bonnyton, the 28-year-old record of 66 was been broken by two shots
by 36-year-old golf equipment salesman Aaron Winston. He, too, said iron
play did the damage in his eight-under-par score in an optional medal
listed in this week's returns. He had nine birdies and a single loss to
par, at the ninth. ''I had only 23 putts and on six occasions I had
tap-in birdies,'' he said.
Another eyebrow-raising score came last month from 42-year-old Walker
Cup player Barclay Howard, who won the Cameron Corbett Vase at Haggs
Castle with a four-round, 20-under-par aggregate of 268 -- just one
fewer than Australian amateur champion Matthew Goggin, who set a record
eight-under-par 64 in the first round.
At Hilton Park, Alex ''Sid'' McDonald set a record 65, and Ross Fraser
equalled it the following day. At the long Brunston Castle course in
Dailly, Ayrshire, Ian Walker set the new mark of two-under-par 71, while
at Tighnabruaich, Fraser McDonald, better known as a Kyles Athletic
shinty player, completed two laps of the nine-hole Kyles of Bute course
in a record 63.
All this fancy scoring is liable to cease when normality, i.e. heavy
rain, returns. Enjoy the sun while it lasts.

Theatre
LITTLE wonder that the collaboration by composer John Adams,
librettist June Jordan, and director Peter Sellars has created some
confused reactions. There is nothing original on offer here except the
very existence of the piece. But that in itself is remarkable, if not
remarkably so.
What the trio have created is a soap opera in an entirely new sense of
the term. Unless you count Puccini. While modern opera often labours
under the twin burdens of difficult music and strained conception,
Ceiling/Sky (as its creators fondly refer to it) is so straightforward
they have chosen to shield it under the banner of ''musical''.
The distinction is pointless, beyond signally accessibility -- and
perhaps dialogue. Adams's music is never difficult, but here he sticks
to very familiar ground, borrowing heavily from 1970s' rock: in UK
terms, the artiness of Soft Machine, the obscurity of Egg, the
over-familiarity of Mike Oldfield.
The score also cheerfully takes in nods to The Temptations and The
Beverley Sisters, and only really comes adrift when Adams is called upon
to create something impressionistic to signify the LA earthquake that
gives the opera its dramatic crux, then recalling the worst tendencies
of ''rock opera''.
The staging of that cataclysm is so much of a non-event that it would
sabotage the piece -- were it not that by that time it scarcely matters
because its emblematic nature has been well signalled.
Read the title as Oscar Wilde's line ''We are all of us in the gutter
but some of us are looking at the stars'' and you have got the picture
-- much like the one Robert Altman made as the film Short Cuts. Add a
cast of seven characters -- all superbly sung -- who are introduced and
followed in classic television style and an unobtrusive staging that
utilises graffiti artists as caption writers and that's about it.
Less pretentious than Sondheim, cleverer than Lloyd Webber. There are
some gorgeous tunes and Jordan's libretto is so skilful it avoids any of
the potential embarrassment traps. There are times when the knowingness
of all this is self evident, but that adds only to the charm. Pistache
or pastiche? Who cares? It's great.

Music
WHAT a star. More than three hours in, five suites down, one precipice
left to negotiate, and the irrepressible Yo Yo Ma was still beaming as
he threaded his way through the packed Greyfriars Kirk, nodding to the
crowd, shaking hands, and exuding nothing less than radiance.
For all that Ma's enormous, four-hour recital of the complete solo
Cello Suites of Bach was a marathon, it didn't feel like it. He set the
agenda early on in the performance -- quick movements went like the
wind. But more, they were so light-fingered that they were nimble and
fleet.
Bach's Suites might be the commandments of music, set in stone, but in
Yo-Yo Ma's unbelievably capable hands they were neither heaven-storming,
nor earth-shattering. Some players seek out the rhetoric, making
grandiose statements, others demystify them, giving them an almost
common touch.
Yo Yo Ma is in between. He is an exquisite poet of Bach. He
understates and has no need of polemic. He brought out character where
some commentators -- who believe the suites to be totally abstract --
claim there is none. Ma's performances were brimming: the First Suite
full of stealth, lyricism, whimsy and humour, the Second -- with maximum
contrast -- a quiet poise and elegant solemnity, followed by a Third
Suite whose Allemande movement was nothing less than mischievous.
Characterless indeed.
His sheer virtuosity was astounding, sizzling speeds and torrential
runs, but all of it was typefied by a weightlessness that kept the
performances buoyant (and contributed considerably to the impression
that the hours flew by).
But equally impressive -- and a quality that emerged throughout this
epic recital -- was his discretion. Time and again, as the surface
activity of the music subsided, Ma, playing with almost superhuman
control, would allow the piece to withdraw quietly in to some interior
world. The hush, as the soft notes filtered through the magnificent
acoustic of the Kirk, was spellbinding.
Finally, there was the stratospheric Sixth Suite, written higher than
any of the others, and inhabiting a rarefied atmosphere. Here, Ma's
introspection was intense, somewhere close to serenity. An unbelievable
experience, all of it.

Opera
EXACTLY 30 years ago in Edinburgh, Carlo Maria Giulini made history by
rejecting a Dutch production of Don Giovanni he considered to be crassly
anti-Mozartian and conducting an improvised semi-staging in its place.
Since then, concert performances of opera have become one of the regular
answers to the tyranny of the producer, with Giovanni last night as the
latest in a series of Mozart performances conducted by Sir Charles
Mackerras at the Usher Hall.
No doubt Sir Charles himself would not put it quite that way. The
performance, like its predecessors, was also the outcome of a series of
recording sessions with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. But as a
conductor who knows what it is like to be involved in a Giovanni in
which he could not believe, he must have welcomed the opportunity to do
it as a piece of authentically Mozartian music drama, in which music had
priority.
Yet the result was in no way pedantic. Far from presenting Giovanni as
an oratorio, Sir Charles encouraged his singers to make the most of the
portions of the platform not occupied by the orchestra in a way that was
inventive, occasionally distracting, but mostly to the point and often
genuinely witty.
By jumping into the audience, Boje Skovhus's elegantly dangerous
Giovanni had a new escape route from his predicament at the end of Act
One. By being sexist with a back-desk violinist, Alessandro Corbelli's
Leporello seized an advantage that would not have come his way in a
theatre.
Above all, however, this was a performance conspicuously well sung and
well conducted, with fast tempi, keen-edged rhythms, and a volatility
that suited Mozart's opera to perfection. Christine Brewer as Donna
Anna, Felicity Lott as Elvira, and Nuccia Focile as Zerlina provided
three beautifully contrasted character studies. Jerry Hadley as Ottavio
was given both his arias -- an indulgence on Sir Charles's part, not
wholly lived up to by the singer -- and Umberto Chiummo's doubling of
the role of Masetto and the Commendatore was a brilliant piece of
operatic sleight of hand.

William Hunter on the rebirth of Love Street
St Mirren 1, Rangers 0
PAISLEY hospitality gave the best seats in the house to the visiting
fans and good patience allowed them to take them at their leisure,
delaying the start of this challenge match for quarter of an hour when
Rangers hanselled St Mirren's new spectator stand.
Much the same mood was shown on the field. An air of good will and no
great hurry characterised the evening.
It took until 10 minutes from the end until a neighbourly encounter
turned into a local triumph as St Mirren went one up on the big people
from next door.
Their goal came from the bright and shining Stuart Taylor, who touched
in what looked like an exploratory cross from the right by David Elliot.
Rangers, who had suffered an earlier miss by Steven Boyack, lived to
regret their earlier relaxed approach which they had maintained despite
much prompting by John Brown and a match of untiring diligence by Ian
Durrant.
Such great excitement as the first half held was provided by St
Mirren. Ricky Gillies shot narrowly past from 20 yards before the heroic
Taylor whistled a fierce drive some distance which did not miss by much.
Paul Gascoigne earned the best cheer of the first half -- and from the
home crowd. It delighted them that he need change his boots after only
two minutes. Otherwise, he contributed a couple of amiable headers and a
friendly shot that was easily held by Alan Combe in St Mirren's goal.
There was enough intervals in the action to ponder what a big little
night it was for Paisley football. The stadium landmarks have not been
abundant in their story since 1877.
With last night's match they entered their second century at Love
Street. It was in 1895 that Saints rented a rough patch of meadow next
to the town slaughterhouse. They sub-leased the grass to a local
herdsman but the agreement was ''on condition that the sheep be removed
from the field during all matches.''
When the present main stand was inaugurated in 1921 hopes were high
that Paisley's new stadium would hold 70,000. Directors talked about the
Greater Love Street and how one day it might rival Ibrox.
Last night, briefly, their dream did not seem far-fetched at all.
Until the field was scattered with substitutes it had usually
threatened to be Rangers' night. They made full use of the pitch and had
about them an air of effortless confidence. But St Mirren never looked
overawed, especially John Boyd, who played Gascoigne with confidence and
not as if he had arrived from another planet.
There were three bookings. Craig Moore was cautioned for his attention
to Gillies and Alex Bone and Brian Reid were yellow-carded together for
pushing but not more robustly than old ladies in a bus queue have got up
to.
ST MIRREN -- Combe, Dawson, Dick, Inglis, Watson, McLaughlin, Law,
Taylor, Gillies, Bone, Boyd. Substitutes -- Smith, Money, Hetherston,
McGrotty, Elliot.
RANGERS -- Thomson, Wright, Brown, Petric, Moore, Reid, Cleland,
Gascoigne, Durrant, Dair, Mikhailichenko. Substitutes -- Nicolson,
Boyack, Scott, McGinty, Wilson, Robertson.
Referee -- W Young (Clarkston).

ENGLAND'S cricketers renewed their familiarity with batting collapses,
losing seven for 72 before an unbeaten last-wicket stand ensured a draw
in the Fifth Test at Trent Bridge.
Led by man of the match, Kenneth Benjamin, who finished with figures
of 10 for 174, a career best, the West Indies gave a superb display of
fast bowling until their work was abruptly halted by a stoic performance
from England's tail-enders, Mike Watkinson and Richard Illingworth.
When England's declaration came after tea, Watkinson and Illingworth
had put on 80 in their unbroken partnership of 89 minutes.
In so doing they had beaten the previous highest tenth-wicket stand of
65 on this ground, in 1966, in a Test match against West Indies. It also
was England's highest tenth-wicket stand against any country since 1980,
when Bob Willis and Peter Willey put on 117 at the Oval.
England's batting collapse set in within half-an-hour of the start
with the wicket of Atherton. Within a space of 72 runs England were to
lose seven wickets to the West Indian fast bowlers.
By the end of the morning session England were just 179 ahead with the
consistent Thorpe the only specialist batsman remaining. But with his
dismissal on 171, followed by Cork and Fraser, England on 189 for nine,
led by 212. The balance had swung more in favour of the tourists until
the brave efforts of England's last pair. Scoreboard:

A GREAT show of livestock was headed by a three shear blackface ram
exhibited by Ian Thomson, of Holylee, Walkerburn, when it was awarded
the accolade of champion of champions at the Peebleshire Agricultural
Society's Annual Show on Saturday.
The ram, bred at Midlock and named Radar, was purchased two years ago
at Lanark for #14,000. It beat off a strong challenge from a
two-year-old Clydesdale filly, shown by Tom Tennant, of Singlie,
Selkirk.
The judge, Donald Walker, described the overall champion as ''a real
black-face sheep''.
The supreme beef award went to a Limousin cow from Broadmeadows
Pedigree Livestock, Chesters, Garvald, East Lothian, while the best
dairy animal was an in-milk Holstein Friesian heifer with a projected

IT'S a play on words, you see: ''Girls with big jests'' and ''Girls
with big chests'', geddit? Very punny. As to the latter, I couldn't say.
Too much of a gentleman to notice.
As to the former, I'm not sure it's accurate. In fact, instead of
Girls With Big Jests, it would be more truthful to think of Henrietta
Garden and Philippa Fordham as girls with inordinately long and
hackneyed sketches resulting in very small jests. Whoops. Maybe I'm not
so much of a gentleman after all.

Alan Jones looks again at the Venice Biennale's visual arts and urges
Edinburgh to take the plunge
ARGUABLY the world's two most famous arts festivals are the Edinburgh
Festival and the Venice Biennale. But while the Oscars and Cannes Film
Festival are celebrated as international events, the Venice Biennale
remains unfamiliar to the British public. Could this be because in
Britain we are not renowned for our appreciation of the visual arts? Or
perhaps we are being badly served by the guardians of our culture?
The Edinburgh Festival can equal or better the Venice Biennale. The
chief difference being the Biennale's greater emphasis on the visual
arts -- traditionally held in high regard in Italy. The Biennale also
includes an international festival of theatre, contemporary music,
architecture and one of the oldest film festivals in the world, dating
back to 1932.
Edinburgh should be chastened and disconcerted by the comparison,
since the visual arts at the Edinburgh Festival have been treated as a
poor cousin, or even something of a black sheep, in the arts family.
Edinburgh's private galleries do hang mixed shows for the Festival and
the National Galleries of Scotland has put on some major shows in recent
years, but generally the visual arts fare very badly. There seems to be
little willingness on behalf of the institutions behind the Festival to
create a coherent programme of international exhibitions and events as
part of the Festival season.
This year the Biennale celebrated its centenary. It started in 1895 to
attract tourists to the city -- not something Venice has much difficulty
doing today. For four days at the beginning of the Biennale in June,
Venice's expensive bars and restaurants are packed with wealthy
collectors, journalists and representatives of the international arts
world. The visual arts Biennale combines all the elements of an
international conference, a shop window for art, a competition and an
international art exhibition.
The officially sponsored section of the Biennale is to be found in the
garden to the east of St Mark's Square (Giardini di Castello). The
garden, once a park dedicated to tropical plants, is now filled with
small galleries or pavilions each funded by its respective country. The
Korean pavilion is the latest to be inaugurated, with the help of a
group of Buddhist nuns complete with shaven heads, flowing grey robes,
burning copious amounts of incense. The oldest is the British pavilion
housed, appropriately, in the the garden's former tea-room.
Most of the other larger pavilions date back to the 1930s when
oppressive fascist architecture was the fashion. The newer pavilions
range in size and architectural style all with some national
characteristic.
The contents of these pavilions vary tremendously with the French,
German and American exhibitions, still favouring large scale
installations. France has veteran artist Cesar, with his large-scale
crushed car exhibition. Germany has three large installations which were
impressive but not memorable by the artists Catharina Fritsch, Martin
Honert, and Thomas Ruff.
The Americans have Bill Viola with his video installation -- he is an
exceptional artist, with an imaginative multi-media approach, which was
recognised when he won the supreme award at the opening ceremony.
The British pavilion hung the London School veteran artist Leon
Kossoff who paints in the style he established in the 1960s. His
selection for the British pavilion was seen by some to be a brave choice
but the exhibition proved to be one of the most rewarding visually with
Kossoff's thickly applied and expressive use of paint.
The Danish pavilion showed the work of John Olsen and was for me one
of the most engaging exhibitions. His use of bone, dried vegetation,
rocks, shells and mummified cats proved intriguing. The Polish presented
equally fascinating work by the international artist Roman Opalka who
has recorded his life moment by moment through his painting. The
presentation of all the canvases in the pavilion was quite breathtaking
in its simplicity.
As the Biennale increases in size, nations new to the international
art scene are looking to be included. The lack of room in the garden has
meant that new countries have found floorspace in the city. Taiwan
exhibited for the first time in the Doges' Palace with an interesting
exhibition of paintings and large block prints; most of the material had
a heavy sexual content. The eagerness of new countries to show at the
Biennale highlights the importance the international art world attaches
to it.
Outwith the gardens are to be found the official exhibitions by guest
curators in major exhibition spaces. The most successful of these is the
exhibition to be found at the Palazzo Grassi and the Museo Correr. This
centenary exhibition was conceived and curated by Jean Clair (the
director of the visual arts section of the Biennale) and is entitled
Forms of the Body 1895-1995. It is a retrospective exhibition looking at
the development of figurative art over the last 100 years and is an
exhibition which greatly deserves academic study.
The exhibition Transculture at the Palazzo Giustinian Lolin is also an
exhibition not to be missed. Fifteen artists from around the world are
showing works of photography, sculpture, painting and new technology. It
is an exhibition which is exciting to visit and which brings together
diverse artistic cultures under one roof in an imaginative and
entertaining way.
Like the Edinburgh Festival, the Biennale has fostered a fringe with
exhibition spaces popping up all over the city.
These are, in fact, places where some of the most interesting art can
be found. Everything from flower-painted vintage cars, to A Walk in a
Venice Garden which maps out a walk between different private gardens in
the city where artists have erected installations or sculpture.
There were three Scottish artists represented at a second British
Council exhibition in the city General Release, at Scuola di San
Pasquale,in the Campo San Franceso. This was an exhibition of young
British talent curated imaginatively by Ann Gallagher from Stonehaven.
Matthew Dalziel and Louise Scullion, from Banff and Buchan, presented a
beautiful installation on the theme of water, and Douglas Gordon from
Glasgow showed an intriguing and impelling video sculpture using two
screens and a loop of archive film.
The last Scottish contingent of note at the Biennale was in 1991. The
Scottish Sculpture Trust, inspired by the late Barbara Grigor in
collaboration with Richard Demarco, presented three Scottish artists:
David Mach, Kate Whiteford and Arthur Watson, with large-scale site
specific installations. With the Edinburgh Festival unwilling to support
such artists it seems ironic that they are invited to make new
large-scale work in Venice and not in Edinburgh, with its plethora of
good garden spaces.
It is really time for a rethink; to gently bash a few heads together
with the hoped result that the Festival will attempt to take
contemporary visual arts more seriously. It is little wonder that the
visual arts are marginalised in our culture if the people who are in a
position to promote and educate suffer from a lack of appreciation and
understanding themselves. If a separate ''Fringe'' arts festival has to
be organised alongside, so be it, but it would be sad and against the
initial spirit of the Festival when it began in 1947. Edinburgh could
have its own Giardini in whatever form that might take.
If Edinburgh wants to develop its Festival's range, it must redress
the balance in visual arts. Once the commitment is there, the
possibilities for the presentation of contemporary art in Edinburgh
during the Festival are endless. The Biennale and the Edinburgh Festival
are very different in character but they are both about artists, visual
or performance, communicating with an international audience.
The issues of funding or marketing are frequently cited as the reason
for visual arts not being given a higher profile by the Edinburgh
Festival. It is really about whether the Edinburgh Festival believes any
longer in the inter-relationship of all the arts.
The Biennale as a festival is not perfect in its presentation and
organisation, but it does show that the arts in all forms can be
presented together as one festival. If the Biennale beefs up its theatre
and music programme then it could rival the Edinburgh Festival as the
world's greatest arts jamboree. The Edinburgh Festival may be a world
platform for performing arts but there is no reason that the Festival
should not share that platform with visual artists.
As for the centenary Biennale, it has been criticised as being weak
and lacking any buzz in comparison to previous years. The Biennale is
still a visual banquet but much of the food might just give you
indigestion. It is well worth the risk as you simply won't see anything
similar at the coming Edinburgh Festival, and you can always cure
indigestion with a Bellini cocktail in Harry's Bar -- but don't forget
your American Express Gold card.
* The Venice Biennale runs to the end of September.

PARBUSTERS
THE last qualifying week for our Parbusters competition usually brings
out some extra effort, and the scratch sections, in particular, produced
some excellent scores, writes Bill Sutherland.
Most of the handicappers, however, had to settle for a shot at the
weekly prize, as few of the most recent entries are quite good enough to
make it on to the appropriate top-10 for the season.
A full list of qualifiers for our finals day at Haggs Castle, after
rescrutiny and ballots, will be published next week.
The leading man this week is Bonnyton's Aaron Winston, whose 64 was
six shots below the CSS of 70. The two-handicapper's net 62 was far too
hot for his colleagues in the club's optional medal.
The best women's scratch scores came from Karen Fitzgerald, who shot a
67 at Cathcart Castle, and the ubiquitous Caroline Agnew, whose 69 at
Eastwood also was three under par.
Three men tied at -11 in the handicap section and each wins a prize.
MEN
Handicap
-11 -- H McAlpine, Glasgow over Killermont (17); J S Clark, Pollok
(15); R McNeil, Port Glasgow (14).
-10 -- G McLachlan, Colville Park (6).
Scratch
-6 -- A Winston, Bonnyton.
-4 -- R Scott, Irvine; E Moir, Hamilton; G McLachlan, Colville Park.
-3 -- R Shaw, Wigtown and Bladnoch; S Lindsay, Lenzie; D Buchanan,
Glenbervie; B Williams, Ladybank; S Russell, Drumpellier; D Walker,
Paisley.
WOMEN
Handicap
-10 -- M Gibson, Crow Wood (30).
-9 -- E Meek, Eastwood (11); I Wright, Sandyhills (33).
-8 -- W Miller, Helensburgh over Cardross (26).
Scratch
-3 -- K Fitzgerald, Cathcart Castle; C Agnew, Eastwood.
-1 -- C Brodie, Cochrane Castle; A Laing, Vale of Leven over Cardross;
C Hargan, Cardross.
+1 -- K Burns, Clydebank and District.
* TEENAGER Stuart Coia won an unprecedented double at Clober, where
the four-handicapper's net 60 and 62 earned him the Elder Trophy for the
best two rounds, while his gross scores of 64 and 66 won the 19-year-old
the R Fleming Memorial Trophy.
* STABLEFORD scores do not count for Parbusters purposes but Ayr
golfer Aliette Gregory's performance in the Dalmilling Ladies' recent
event is worthy of note. She scored 53 Stableford points with a score
which translated to a net 15-under 55 -- despite the bad start of a 9 at
the first. Her reward is a handicap cut from 32 to 24.
AYRSHIRE Boys' championship (two rounds) over Ballochmyle: 142 -- N
McCormack (New Cumnock); 144 -- T McInally (Loudoun); 147 -- J Doolan
(Dalmilling).
Boys' Tournament (handicaps in excess of 14). Under-15s: 80 -- A
Wilson (Kilmarnock Barassie); 81 -- R Samson (Loudoun); 87 -- A
McCormack (Troon St Meddans) bih. Under-18s: 88 -- M Murray (New
Cumnock); 90 -- C Ritchie (Ballochmyle); 91 -- A Gray (Troon Wellbeck).

RULES CORNER
TEEING off first, your well-struck No.6 iron shot at a par-3 hole
comes up short. In exasperation, you say out loud: ''I should have
played a No.5 iron.''
Are you penalised two shots under Rule 8-1 for giving advice to your
fellow-competitors who are now about to play?
No. Decision 8-1/8 declares there is no penalty if the statement was
made casually. However, if the remark was directed to another player,
the rule was broken.

PAULINE Robertson, captain of the Scottish women's team which finished
sixth in the European Nations Cup in Amsterdam, will assume
vice-captaincy of the Great Britain Olympic team which flies out
tomorrow to a training camp in Australia.
This is a tremendous honour for the Bonagrass Grove player, but many
observers, not just from Scotland, will argue that she should have been
given captaincy. That position has gone to England's Jill Atkins. She
doesn't hold any position of authority with England, but the players
themselves made the choice. England, after all, provide 13 of the
19-strong squad.
Scotland keeper Tracey Robb is the only likely addition. She was
unfortunate not to have been included in the initial party, but if
England's second-choice net-minder Hilary Rose doesn't measure up in any
of Great Britain's six practice matches or three tests then the Aberdeen
girl will be in line for promotion and join Scots Diane Renilson, Rhona
Simpson, Susan Fraser, Susan MacDonald, and Robertson.

Theatre
IT'S hardly surprising that when Duncan Thaw's art tutor exasperatedly
inquires ''Do you have the faintest notion of what you're trying to
do?'' the line provokes ripples of amused recognition among the audience
but it's obviously no coincidence that, in this necessarily pared-down
adaptation of Alasdair Gray's dense novel, the line is there at all.
This TAG Theatre Company production is littered with knowing nods to
the essential obscurantism of Lanark, a story laden with themes, diverse
omens, and the perplexing parallels -- puzzle over them to your
intellectual peril -- between Lanark's futuristic Unthank and Duncan
Thaw's Glasgow.
But while director Tony Graham clearly acknowledges the suggested
unstageability of Lanark he does not seem to have conquered the
much-discussed problems.
Alastair Cording's adaptation successfully highlights key moments but
his attempt to impose some unity through a musical dimension, with a
portentous prologue sung by a baritone -- Stuart McIntyre playing the
symbolic figure of the Painter -- is less convincing.
While Alasdair Nicolson's score appropriately exacerbates the morose
atmosphere it can sometimes seem more obstructive than enlightening,
with much of the dialogue drowned out.
Visually, this is quite literally the case, with two cellists and a
violinist stuck squarely in the middle of the stage dominating
proceedings and robbing various set arrangements of any impact.
Designer Angela Davies has opted for a cool, subdued look,
impressively lit by Jeanine Davies. The action is played in the round,
on an open stage, with a simple gallery construction, which becomes the
Cowlairs Parish Church, in the background.
Graham's direction is crisp and clear but ultimately it is all simply
too episodic and choppy to be involving, a fact not helped by some very
uneven acting -- a dance sequence during Thaw's encounter with the
prostitute is embarrassingly contrived and deplorably executed by the
cast. The central performances are powerful however.
Commendably, Graham has not opted for any trite comparisons in his
casting of Lanark and Thaw; Laurance Rudic plays Lanark with a detached
diffidence which becomes strangely appealing, while Tom Smith's Lanark
is a thrawn, petulant fellow, simmering with repressed sexuality. There
are charming comic moments, particularly between Smith and Kern
Falconer's minister, but they're somewhat lost in the general
vacuousness of the piece.

FARMERS are set to challenge the oil industry as a feedstock supplier
for a range of industrial uses under a new initiative announced in
London.
The Government-backed initiative by Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg
is designed to marry up potential industrial demand for renewable raw
materials from new crop technologies.
But, as Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union of
England and Wales, said: ''The oil industry will not stand still and let
us take their market. We will have to fight for it.''
With sponsorship from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council and several leading farm companies, the agriculture
industry is aiming to raise up to #200,000 a year in the three-year
programme to run an Alternative Crops Technology Interaction Network.
This will establish a database of research and development into
alternative crops with the aim of providing substitute raw materials for
industrial processes, including pharmaceuticals manufacture. It will act
as a link between academia, industry, and farming.
Ben Gill, NFU deputy president, pointed out there was a high degree of
urgency due to the rapid progress being made in the US and Japan in
patenting novel crops and related technologies and intellectual rights.
The aim was to break the British logjam by creating a common language
between scientists and industry.
Professor Tom Blundell, chief executive of the BBSRC, said the new
sciences of biogenetics and biochemistry at molecular level were
creating a bio-revolution. This could be harnessed to provide more
renewable resources, environmental improvement, and high value products.
It was a timely and important initiative, said Mr Hogg. There was
increasing pressure to make use of a sustainable resources, for farming
to develop away from being a food to a non-food product producer and for
science and technological development to make this possible.
However, Frank Oldfield, chairman of the Home-Grown Cereals
Authorities Oilseeds Research Group, reminded him that the Government
had already turned its back on one such initiative by failing to support
the development of bio-diesel fuel.

Dance
LORD what is man? . . . Pure and ecstatic, the counter-tenor voice
sings out Purcell's divine hymn of love eternal. On stage a figure
stoops in lustful passion. And Alleluia! Love eternal it is: the
vampire's bite ensuring undying love of a kind. Mark Morris is with us
again, his twists of humour carried as much in the music as in the
dance.
Morris himself dances the elegant stranger who beguiles -- and then
bleeds -- the unsuspecting little miss of Teri Weksler in One Charming
Night, a merrily black vignette of toothsome romance.
Romance -- the hearts and flowers, moon-June kind -- flows through the
songs of Stephen Foster and it's these nineteenth-century parlour
ballads that character the new work in this programme, Somebody's Coming
to See Me Tonight. Plain Joes and Janes -- in the kind of serviceable
clothes you saved for out of Sear's -- dance out dreams, the kind of
wistful special-person dreams Sear's couldn't send mail order.
The meetings and partings, the reflective yearnings, move with a
period simplicity to them, with a real sense of the sentimental without
ever becoming mawkish -- Morris sees to that when his girls suddenly
kick long bare thighs in the air or the someone who comes to see a fella
is another fella!
The America of Hopper's diners comes to mind -- it's the colourways of
the costumes, I think -- in The Office. Are the folk who are waiting to
be called looking for work, or benefit? Who knows? Only that, in the
course of the music from Dvorak's Bagatelle, they gradually come
together in a way that is sustaining and emboldening -- particularly
when Authority in a Grey Suit peels them off, one by one.
The dances here are a kaleidoscope of folk influences, dances that
sweep people off their feet in Greek chains or foursome reel-come-square
dances. Morris, appropriately, leads the dance that initially brings
them tentatively together. The slumped shoulders of the last remaining
woman says it all: loneliness is keener after companionship.
A Rockettes-razzy response to Ibert's Divertissement, and a snatch of
that glorious Polka (music by Lou Harrison) complete a thoroughly
engaging pick'n'mix selection of Morris' extensive talents. Live music
throughout was stunningly performed, the dancers maintain their hold on
our affections and respect.

Opera
THERE'S a glorious moment in the second act of Dvorak's opera The
Jacobin when the Count's son and his wife describe how music has
sustained them in their struggle.
Peter Sidhom, as the son suspected of being a Jacobin and of nuturing
terrible revolutionary motives, and Rita Cullis as the wife who puts the
misinformed father right about his son's loyalties, are truly terrific.
With their duet and ensemble ''we wandered long abroad'' -- shades here
of all those bits of Dvorak that are instantly recognisable as Czech
national and tuneful -- Scottish Opera's production seems to take off.
But it takes a while to get there.
The brilliantly effective opening, devised as a kind of prologue with
a vivid battle scene drop, gives way to a charming courtly scene
presented behind gauze as a kind of flash-forward.
In Reinhart Zimmerman's set designs the rest of the action takes place
in a curious subterranean labyrinth, its cave walls clad in what looks
like tinfoil and containing a job lot of long, wooden gym benches. The
young lovers Jiri and Terinka are allocated some more Alcan and Bacofoil
respectively, for their serenade costumes (designed by Eleonore Kleiber)
-- she in Brunnhilde battledress with silver filagree, he in a bizarre
suit of semi-armour.
It's a chilly setting for nearly an entire opera, a strange partner
for costumes that, if not exactly period, are certainly inoffensive, and
a far cry from the fairytale turrets and country town that the composer
envisaged.
If the look of Christine Mielitz's production has that slight feeling
of ''work in progress'' about it, especially around the floor, Richard
Armstrong more than compensates for this in the very polished richness
and colour he draws from the Scottish Opera Orchestra.
The committed and well-drawn musician schoolmaster character, Benda,
is splendidly sung by Alasdair Elliot in what is obviously a team
effort. Scottish Opera have tackled bravely the problems of an opera
about nationalistic values combined with a love story sub-plot though
without always finding a perfect solution.
The comedy in The Jacobin is about as light as an over-larded dumpling
and Donald Maxwell might be in serious danger of becoming typecast as a
hammy comic villian. Claire Rutter and Richard Coxon bring country
coyness and a bracing touch of unfulfilled passion to their singing. As
Ann Hetherington struggled on and off, as the count's palsied
housekeeper, with heavy furniture I did begin to wonder, following the
company's recent unfortunate troubles, if the stage hands had gone on
strike.
But goodness will out, the Count finally sheds his cobwebs, the mosque
begins, and the prettiest scene of the whole evening is worth the wait.

William Russell finds fools' fare in Cave of Gold, a racy partnership
in Mrs Munck, cracks in Eggs, and wonders why the fuss at Condition Red
WE LIVE in the age of the visitors' centre. Forget that pile of
crumbling stones, it is only Stonehenge, that windswept moor, merely
Culloden. Go to the heritage museum, try the Bannockburn experience. It
is ever so much better than the real thing.
Gaelic may not be a dead language yet, but it and Gaelic culture are
heading for the heritage tomb. David Halliday's Cave of Gold is a moving
account of a language and a culture in decline helped by a superb score
from Horia Suriano which is superb, and some glorious songs
magnificently sung. As a film, however, it makes a superb radio
programme.
Halliday's imagery, especially some excruciatingly awful stop motion
sequences, fails to illuminate his message and there are too many shots
of cragged islanders staring at the camera -- ah, those careworn antique
faces -- clearly petrified by the lens while a voice over rabbits on
delivering thoughts they are patently not thinking. The closing sequence
of an animated wedding ceilidh is apparently intended to show there is
life in Gaeldom yet. I think not.
In Mrs Munck Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern fight the battle of the sexes
to a standstill. Albee it ain't, although his influence is clearly
there. Ladd, who also wrote and directed the film, plays Mrs Munck, a
blowsy, but still sexy widow out for revenge on the older, now crippled
rich man, Patrick Leary (Dern) who seduced her as a young girl and then
abandoned her with a child.
The black comedy is occasionally over ripe, and it is about 20 minutes
too long, but Mrs Munck's revenge is subtly engineered, and Ladd's
bravura performance conveys Mrs Munck's ambiguity splendidly -- the
woman is both mad for revenge and half in love with her victim. Dern
lends the old man much-needed dignity.
He may have been a callous seducer, but he is not evil, merely a man.
Shelley Winters is fun as Leary's dotty sister, but the film belongs to
Ladd and Dern who act up a storm.
There are good eggs and bad eggs, and Brent Hamer's so called comedy,
Eggs, falls into the latter category. It is so bad it is rotten. Maybe a
Norwegian comedy is a contradiction in terms, but Eggs turns up with a
high reputation from Cannes where it was in this year's Director's
Fortnight. Two aged bachelor brothers, Moe and Pa, live alone in the
snow-shrouded wilds of Norway. But Pa has a secret. He once went to
Sweden for the weekend and fathered a son, a very odd creature indeed,
who, when his mother falls sick, comes to stay. Thing will never be the
same again . . . they become even more boring.
In Condition Red, directed by the Finn, Mika Kaurismaki. James Russo
plays Dan, a morose guard in a women's prison who falls in love with a
beautiful inmate, Gidell (Cynda Williams), gets her pregnant, and helps
her escape. But Gidell is not what she appears to be, as the halfwit
should have known had he ever gone to the cinema. It is that old, but
still watchable film noir plot about the male blinded by sex and the
femme fatale who gets her comeuppance. It belongs in a video store, not
a film festival.

SO many early women artists, cheated by early death or society's
conventions, did not fulfil their potential. Here is only a glimpse of
that talent -- Katherine Cameron, Mary Newbery Sturrock's Glasgow style,
and Emily Murray Patterson's stark watercolours of Ypres, here
contrasted with Norah Neilson Gray's symbolic battlefield of cobwebbed
barbed wire. Gray's stunning portrait Constance Muriel, in almost too
fluid oil strokes, Majel Davidson's rich Paris portraits, and Dorothy
Johnstone's April Sunshine, full of sharp hope, are all remarkable.
There are intimate studies of family life from Cecile Walton and Mary
Barnard, and Sarah Goffe Adamson's An Arabian Night is full of the lure
of Bakst and the Ballet Russe. Visit this show and enjoy them all.

ALEXANDER LINKLATER finds children have added life to the Book
Festival
OF ALL events in the Edinburgh Festival it is the books at Charlotte
Square which attract the most varied audiences, producing the most
poly-cultural range. Nowhere else will you come across such a mixed bag
of politicians, children, poets, academics, comedians, journalists,
magicians, and musicians rubbing shoulders and participating in the same
basic activity.
It is the strong presence of kiddie-literature, and of the children
themselves, which most vividly marks out the Book Festival as different
from other venues. So it's fitting that the first debate of the weekend
should have been by adults discussing the problems of parenthood and
childhood.
As it turned out, this selection of Virago writers talking about
mothers and daughters produced a theme which recurred throughout the
weekend. Once Sophie Parkin had brought up the question of how children
compulsively repeat the mistakes of their parents, no-one could get
enough of repetitive cycles.
Victoria Glendinning and Yvonne Roberts returned to them on Saturday
afternoon with Mary Wesley and Joan Brady reintroducing the subject next
morning.
Throughout the weekend it was the women who dominated, culminating on
Sunday night with a dazzling display of energy and commitment from
Marsha Hunt. She announced the first results of her SAGA prize for black
British writing, reinforcing the point that if British literature is
going to become interesting publishers will need to break from their own
restrictive patterns, finding new audiences, and sources of inspiration.
The winner, Diran Adebayo, is definitely a man but his novel, Some
Kind of Black, will none the less be published in a controversial move
by Virago. Next June he will become the only living male author on their
list.
Publishing director, Lennie Goodings, spoke about Virago's mission to
give voice to marginalised readers and writers, explaining that their
decision to publish Adebayo's book was geared to this end. She
emphasised the point that publishing is a form of power and that finding
new writing inevitably involves corporate battle.
It was a timely reminder of how public tastes are largely formed by
the dominant presses. And also that behind a good many of the Book
Festival events lie marketing ploys.
Waterstones are sponsoring the ''Six of the Best'' series, in which
authors discuss the books which have influenced them. On Saturday Roy
Hattersley demonstrated how radical politics can so often produce
conservative tastes. He plumped for some true-blue old favourites. After
discussing the egalitarian principles of Matthew Arnold and R H Tawney,
he moved on to an uninspired selection of Brideshead Revisited, The
Great Gatsby and Far From the Madding Crowd.
Margaret Foster was a good deal more original in her choices, which
ranged from Lolita to Christina Stead's The Man Who Loved Children to
The Great World by David Malouf.
Other weekend highlights included John Simpson's reading from his
anthology of exile and discussing life on the trail of the world's
disaster areas. When you realise how often he has found himself at the
epicentre of world events, and how extraordinary his life has been, it
is tempting to wonder if all this adventuring isn't a compensation for a
certain lack of personal charisma.
The cancellation of Monday morning's Meridian Debate removed one of
the few highbrow events from the programme. It's a reminder of something
the Book Festival lacks. While the children give it popular life, and
most events have a broad appeal, there is a lack of a forum for
international debate.
This year it's going to be as entertaining as ever, but you'll need to
search hard to find the intellectual core.

Dance
THE Nutcracker is a ballet to bring out the child in us all. Its
Christmas Eve setting -- candle-lit tree, gifts, kiddies, grandparents
-- is meant to transport us back to happier times when life was supposed
to be bursting with a new adventure every minute.
Miami City Ballet, returning to the Edinburgh Festival for the second
year in succession, is dancing The Nutcracker in the legendary version
choreographed by George Balanchine for his New York City Ballet back in
1958. Since then it has chalked up close to 2000 performances in
Manhattan and sparked off hundreds, if not thousands, of clones across
the globe.
From Texas to Tokyo, from the Midlands to Miami, it remains a
guaranteed box-office bonanza. But the truth is that The Nutcracker is
actually a ballet geared to please punters rather than thrill
aficionados. The Miami dancers know this, and happily exploit the
situation for all it's worth. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine
another production so wall-to-wall crammed with ear-to-ear grins. Of
course, the majority of the audience responds in kind.
Here, Balanchine, the grandmaster of abstract ballet who built a
life-long career out of daring experimentation, proves he isn't afraid
to show he's an old softie. His openhearted love for these children is
so blatantly dewy-eyed that it approaches the mawkish. All that's
missing is a puppy.
The opening night performances ran the gamut. The glamorous and
astonishingly long-limbed Myrna Kamara all but stops the show with her
sensuous solo. It's danced to Tchaikovsky's slithery Arabian variation,
but Kamara and costume designer Haydee Morales give it a more
contemporary, even Caribbean, look.
The more classically demanding roles such as the Sugar Plum Fairy are
tossed off with that go-go-go attack and verve which forms the heart of
Balanchine's style. But not all of Miami's dancers seem to understand
that Balanchine wanted his speed laced with grandeur and opulence.
Ballet can't just be a race to the finish; it has to be a waltz, even
when the tempo is in overdrive.

TRAINER Les Eyre, most upset over the disqualification of his
Celestial Choir at Pontefract on Sunday, intends to lodge an appeal to
the Jockey Club.
Eyre was incensed at the stewards' decision to demote Celestial Choir
to third place after she had won the a challenge handicap, her first
success of the season.
After the mare had easily beaten Mo-Addab, the officials found her
rider, David Griffiths, guilty of irresponsible riding. They claimed
that the apprentice had been irresponsible rather than careless in
carrying Pride of Pendle to the right when delivering his challenge.
They also suspended Griffiths for four days.
This afternoon, Pentire has emerged as a revelation this season and
can continue his excellent campaign with a victory in the Great
Voltigeur Stakes at York.
Geoff Wragg's colt mopped up Derby trials at Sandown, Chester, and
Goodwood before taking the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot.
He lost nothing in defeat last time out when just beaten by Lammtarra
and is a confident selection to rediscover winning form.
* DERBY winner Lammtarra will have his next race in the Prix de l'Arc
de Triomphe at Longchamp on October 1.

<HEADLINE>Higher interest rates look likely after fresh figures show jump in factory gate inflation. Rise in prices strengthens Governor</HEADLINE>

SINCE Kenneth Clarke and Eddie George first fell out over interest
rates in May, it has seemed that most of the best cards have been dealt
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
But yesterday producer prices figures for July, showing that input
prices were still rising at more than 10% per annum and that core
factory gate price inflation was increasing at 5% per annum, clearly
strengthen the hand of the Governor of the Bank of England.
Both equities and gilts took the news badly since the clear
implication was that at some stage interest rates would have to rise.
The trigger for this will be a pick-up in activity following the recent
slowdown.
The FTSE-100 share index, which earlier in the month appeared to be
heading for its all-time closing high of 3520.3, dropped 26.1 points to
3441.4.
James Capel's Adam Cole is forecasting that rates will be raised in
November after the Tory Party conference and ahead of a tax-cutting
Budget.
Between June and July, factory gate prices rose by 0.2%, taking the
annual rate up from 4.2% to 4.5%, its highest level since August 1991.
This was a little worse than the City had expected, but the core rate,
which excludes the food, drink, tobacco, and petroleum industries,
provided the greater shock.
In this series, the month-on-month seasnally adjusted rise was 0.4%
and the annual rate picked up from 4.8% to 5%, the highest since May
1991. (In the pulp and paper industries, the annual rate of factory gate
price inflation has climbed to 20.9%).
Even worse was the rise in the three-month-on-three-month core
inflation rate to 5.3%. This suggests that factory gate price inflation
will continue to deteriorate over the coming months as manufacturers
seek to rebuild their margins, which have been depressed by rising input
prices and higher labour costs.
Seasonally adjusted input prices rose by 0.5% in July. The annual rate
fell back from a revised 10.4% (10.2%) to 10.3%. Hopes that the rate
would fall below 10% for the first time since January when it peaked at
12.1% came to naught. But the annualised three-month-on-three-month rate
is down to 6.9%.
Input price data is continuing to reflect the fall in sterling in the
first part of the year. As a result, the costs of imported goods have
risen sharply despite recent weakness in commodity prices. But it should
be borne in mind that fuel and raw materials costs account for no more
than 8% of manufacturers' total costs.
However, if input costs are taken together with recent increases in
labour costs, there is little doubt that manufacturers' costs are rising
faster than factory gate prices. But with capacity utilisation at a high
level, it is inevitable that manufacturers will continue to push prices
higher.
The key question is the extent to which factory gate price inflation
will feed through to the rest of the ecnomy. Economists at Goldman Sachs
believe that it will prompt higher retail price inflation for the rest
of this year and the early months of next year. Underlying inflation,
which excludes mortgage interest payments, will threaten to breach the
upper limit of the Government's 1% to 4% target range before declining
gradually.
As a result, the Government will almost certainly miss its target of
reducing underlying inflation to 2.5% or less by the end of the current
Parliament in the spring of 1997.
Since the Bank of England is the official guardian of the nation's
fight against inflation, it will continue to press for higher interest
rates as long as it seems likely that the inflation target is
threatened.
The Chancellor has, however, been more concerned about the signs of a
slowdown in the economy and the depressed state of the housing market,
which needs an increase in rates like a hole in the head.
Undoubtedly, growth has slowed down from the hectic rate of last year
but it is not clear that it has yet slowed to a sustainable pace.
Moreover, it is likely that consumer demand, depressed by tax increases
and rate rises, will start to pick up, especially if Mr Clarke is able
to deliver the tax-cutting Budget the Conservative Party is demanding of
him in a last bid to avoid electoral disaster.
The producer prices are only the first of a hefty batch of statistics
this week, including figures for the retail price index, retail sales,
and unemployment, all for July. These will give the first clues as to
how the real economy is performing in the third quarter.

SUEDORO gave Lesmahagow trainer Robert McKellar his fourth winner at
Hamilton yesterday. The 8-1 chance, already twice successful over the
same distance, outpaced her seven rivals to take the Team Management
Handicap.
Apprentice Corey Adamson bounced her out of the stalls and kept
Suedoro's nose in front all the way despite the challenge of Diet.
''The way I'm going this season I should run all my horses here,''
said McKellar. ''I worked Suedoro in blinkers on Saturday and it helped
to sharpen her up. She also worked in blinkers before she won here the
last time.''
Adamson completed his first double at odds of 39[1/2]-1 with Exclusion
(7-2) an easy winner of the Carstairs Handicap.
Philip Robinson, seeking a winner after having ridden 51 losers,
heaved a sigh of relief when he got Roseberry Ray (11-8) home in the
feature race.
Larghetto (5-1), second in three of his last four races, made
virtually all to win the maiden for his Arab owners and trainer Jack
Berry.

Music
SOMETHING'S gone terribly right this year, with the official Festival
at last recognising the existence of Scottish traditional music.
The first of 21, Sunday's introductory concert struck an ideal blend
between informing and entertaining an audience which spilled over on to
the stairs and balcony above.
Peter Hall, Gordeanna McCulloch and Norman Kennedy in turns sang songs
whose themes, if not always the versions chosen (night visiting songs
where the lover gets short shrift, that sort of thing), were mostly
familiar.
Kennedy, Buchan-born but resident in America for 30 years, retains a
clear sense of his native tongue's rhythm. Hall's explanations were
concise and witty and were occasionally balanced by mild points of order
from McCulloch, who sang with typically warm gusto.

WITH uncanny good fortune as regards timing, GHK have secured one of
the most original sponsorship deals in Scottish rugby by entering into
an agreement with the legal firm, Harper Macleod, for the next season.
As part of the deal Harper Macleod are to supply the club with legal
advice on matters such as trust funds and contracts with their players.
They are to pay some cash, and will become the jersey sponsor.
Stephen Miller, partner in charge of the firm's Sports Law Unit, said:
''Major developments are taking place in rugby football the world over
and it is vital that players, and clubs generally, have access to sound
legal advice as the sport prepares to enter a new era of professionalism
and semi-professionalism.''
The Herald revealed on Saturday that Heriot's have set up a trust fund
for their players, as have Stirling County and Melrose, and now GHK are
to follow suit. This indicates that the pace of change in the game is
being exceeded only by the abilities of the clubs to adapt to their
new-found professional arena and its associated legal obligations. GHK
president, Jimmy Martin said: ''The season ahead represents a major
challenge for everyone at Old Anniesland, and we welcome the offer of
support and guidance from Harper Macleod's Sports Law Unit.''
All of which goes to show that the advent of professionalism requires
a modicum of thought. Lorne Crerar, the referee and a partner at Harper
Macleod, said: ''We are delighted to be one of GHK's major sponsors for
the 1995/96 season. They are Glasgow's premier rugby football club.''
Premier rugby football club? What about Glasgow Accies? Cheek.

THE debate between the Treasury and the Bank of England seems bound to
warm up again after some indication that the Governor was softening his
demand for an immediate increase (albeit a modest one) in interest
rates. Output prices have now risen for five months in a row and are the
highest since 1991. The balance may be tilting in the Governor's favour.
The Governor's view has always been that the Government should make a
pre-emptive strike before the inflationary trend became marked; it would
thereby be anticipating events rather than reacting to them. Yet even
now the position is not absolutely clear: other evidence shows a
distinct falling off in the economy's rate of growth. The best example
is employment where the last figures suggested that growth remained but
was minuscule enough to have many forecasters predicting a rise in
unemployment this month or next, at a seasonal time when job
opportunities should be buoyant. Such an outcome would be the first
change of direction in two years and would strengthen the Treasury line
that further interest rate rises would simply make matters worse, not
just on the politically sensitive housing front, already so beleaguered,
but on small and medium-sized businesses still struggling with debt. The
Treasury will also be reinforced by the way in which earnings remain
stable at 3.5%, for were inflation to be set to rise significantly that
indicator would already be flashing a different signal.
In short we are where we have been for the past three or four months,
with no absolutely conclusive data to end the debate and compel a move.
The July figures on demand and prices later this week may make things
clearer. But that too has been a feature of the months since May when Mr
Clarke first dug in his heels about interest rates: the next round of
figures has been expected to be conclusive but has merely confirmed
uncertainty. One surety has been that the continuing weakness of
sterling does promote inflation but that ought to have been relieved by
falling interest rates elsewhere in the past eight weeks and it has
helped to do wonders for exporters. In short the same uncertainty
persists in a kind of wobbling equilibrium: it would be a great help
were the Germans to cut their rates, no matter how slightly, later this
week.
Were any domestic rate increase to come it might not be large but its
impact would be far greater than its size since it has been so long
resisted. It might not signal the complete end of the recovery but its
course would be left stuttering -- and the political consequences would
be especially severe for the Government which has been coming cautiously
to hope that the next interest rate movement would be downwards in line
with American and other continental movements. Even some of yesterday's
more pessimistic observers were talking of a ''blip'' rather than a
definite change of direction. Unfortunately ''blip'' has not had a happy
history in British economic commentary of late, and the output price
levels look like something far more akin to a trend, relentlessly, if
slowly, upwards. Mr Clarke may therefore be compelled to act against his
natural (as well as political) inclinations and sanction a small
increase in the cost of money, but it must seem doubtful that he will be
moved by one set of data at this point in the electoral cycle. Every
economic statistic available in the next few weeks will be examined with
all that intensity that Roman seers reserved for the entrails of dead
birds.

THE transfer of manager Murdo MacLeod from Dumbarton to Partick
Thistle to succeed John Lambie might have been expected to be one of the
more amicable arrangements of this fraught summer but it is not.
The club he leaves is unhappy about a contract they claim exists but
which he disputes, insisting that he has never signed any document.
''It is a sad way for me to leave a club that I enjoyed 18 months
with,'' said MacLeod. ''I got on well with everyone, including
directors, but it seems that the matter will have to be resolved by the
football authorities.''
Thistle chairman Jim Oliver, whose settlement with Falkirk after they
appointed Lambie was dealt with speedily, said that Thistle would accept
any adjudication by the Scottish League.
MacLeod, with three-year-old daughter Marina at his side, promised
Thistle fans that he would try to bring about the same kind of qualities
he was able to bring to Dumbarton, who were promoted to the first
division for this season.
''I want to try get good football played, but at the same time we have
to achieve things. The first thing is to make sure we stay in the
premier division. For myself, as a player it was my ambition to play in
the top league, and it was the same as a manager. Now I have that
chance.''
MacLeod's experience with Celtic and Borussia Dortmund as a player and
Hibs then Dumbarton as a player and manager amounted to the kind of
track record Oliver saw as the way forward for Thistle.
''If John Lambie had stayed here we would have done nothing to change
things, but his departure meant we had to have a review of the club and
I think the chance to restructure the team, bringing in the continental
knowledge Murdo has gained, is the right way to go.''
MacLeod, who has a two-year contract, will have to try to resolve the
situation regarding the collection of unsigned players at Firhill before
he goes any further.
''That is the priority and I hope we can get it sorted out quickly,''
said the new manager. ''I want players who want to play for Partick
Thistle.'' He will work with coach Gordon Chisholm, who is likley to
become his assistant. Gerry Collins left the club after having reached
agreement with Oliver on his departure terms, and is expected to join
Lambie at Falkirk.

SINCE I have been away enjoying myself for two Tuesdays, you will be
expecting your fairing. If that's wanting jam on it, why not? The wee
minding brought back for you is a pot of marmalade.
As a present from a holiday it amounts to good news and bad news on
the same bit of toast.
From being a gift to the world, marmalade need be Scottish no more. To
cloud my time-off that is what some informed people have been claiming.
Even some marmalade makers said so. And people who know how to make
their own jam at home know most other things that matter.
Even among some of the most skilful alchemists of oranges it is being
conceded that there is factory stuff on the go that makes foolish any
further hassle and fuss about producing the hand-made.
As well as being not Scottish the new marmalade is not new. As if by
stealth it has crept on to shop shelves. Some of even the more dismal
supermarkets have it. Like most pieces of good tidings, it has been slow
to spread. But with it, mebbe, hath endeth an old Scotch tale.
Sticking to marmalade is a saga of imaginative achievement. Sometimes
it can sound like a story made up as it went along. Included has been a
cast of many hundreds, or thousands. Depending on how the drama is
scripted, regal players had parts in it.
Mary Queen of Scots, if you wish to believe so, was involved and so
was Henry VIII, an odd pairing that may not be odd at all. And there was
a minister's wife who blabbed state secrets about oranges and lemons to
the English. Following her came a generation of Oxford University
undergraduates who set themselves up as sages of the breakfast table.
For a first main character, however, the epic has a gormless Dundee
shopper, who, being a man, should not have been trusted to go the
messages.
When a shipment of bitter oranges was landed at Dundee harbour around
l700, nobody was daft enough to buy them save only James Keiller. They
were going that cheap. He was a fellow who could not resist a bargain.
At home he dumped his wersh surprise in the lap of his delighted missus.
Fortunately for them both Janet Keiller was a dab at the jam-making.
She had been brought up in the frugal tradition of making the most of
what came to hand. Putting grozets and blackcurrants into jars to keep
them was a bagatelle to her. No bother was it to find a way to preserve
orange peel.
F Marian McNeill's The Book of Breakfasts declares: ''We are the
world's jam-makers par excellence, and it is to the native sweetness of
the strawberries and rasps that the excellence of Scots jams is due.''
Hertfordshire, however, houses the business base of the commercial
marmalade that is said to be set to see off home making. It comes
''specially packed'' (whatever that means) from Denmark. In accord with
the new morality it has reduced sugar. Although only gently wersh,
cheeky dauds of peel jouk about in it.
''Our marmalades (the genteel label proclaims) are never boiled, but
gently cooked to retain the flavour and goodness of the fruit.'' It
seems a revolutionary claim.
Among the six recipes that include grapefruit marmalade in The Glasgow
Cookery Book, peerless source of kitchen lore, a volcanic amount of
boiling is involved after much overnight steeping of orange gunk. Whom
to believe?
How the formula of the Scotch treat went among the English was via a
Perthshire manse around l870 to Mr and Mrs Cooper's shop in Oxford.
Fashionable students made a morning fad of marmalade, giving it their
nursery name of squish.
Earlier, by about l0 years, Dundi -- as some French called marmalade
-- had had its bitterness of Seville oranges magically improved and the
trick of adding shredded peel perfected in Paisley. Its jam works made
the south-end of the town aromatic, as Fochabers and Carluke may still
sometimes be unless some public health rule now insists on protecting
the fragrant nostrils of the denizens.
Marmalade, the word, comes from marmelo that means quince in
Portuguese. It took Scots to make it universal. As Marian McNeill
rhapsodised: ''In jars or cans it accompanies expeditions to the South
Pole and the summit of Mount Everest; it dives to the depths of the sea
in submarines; it soars far above the clouds in aeroplanes; and, who
knows, it may one day be rocketed to the moon!''
How Henry VIII got in a jam is as sticky to explain as now is
Denmark's place.
Apparently he recorded receiving a gift of a box of marmalade -- that
is, preserved quinces -- in l524. Queen Mary's presence in the fable is
more active.
It is told that she came nigh unto death from a chill she caught from
being out with Bothwell during a long night when sensible people kept
indoors from the rain. When she refused to eat, her French chef created
a sweet mess of quinces or oranges to tempt her appetite. Ever after she
kept at her bedside a dish of Marie malade.
Credit that, and all the rest of the marmalade story slips over a
treat. A squeeze of the lemon of disbelief is always wise, though. How
rotten Jamie Keiller was at doing the messages remains hard to swallow.

THE two Scottish crews embarking on the first 2200-mile Teacher's
Round Britain Challenge made a confident start off Southend on Sea
yesterday afternoon, as the 10 boats representing the Five Nations set
off on the first leg, 465 miles to Cardiff.
Significantly, skippers Jon Fitzgerald and Paul Jeffes were the only
national team leaders to show solidarity with their volunteer, amateur
crews and forego a bed ashore, instead electing to sleep on board their
37-foot French built SunFast 36s -- standard issue charter boats from
the world-wide operator Sunsail.
Their penance was rewarded by their crew, for at the start gun and
around the tight upwind-downwind circuit designed to give spectators and
sponsors post-start entertainment, the Scots were sharper, easily
winning the start.
Although David Harte, the former Irish National Sailing Coach, had
built up a three-quarters of a mile lead for Ireland, the Scots were
last night leading the overall standings with a comfortable second and
third place.

CHRIS Eubank was yesterday fined #5000 by the British Boxing Board of
Control at a hearing in London, after having been found guilty of
bringing the sport into disrepute for his alleged comments against
Irishman Steve Collins.
The BBBC cleared WBC heavyweight champion Oliver McCall, of a similar
charge, so his title fight against Frank Bruno goes ahead at Wembley
Stadium on September 2.
Eubank declined to make a personal hearing and instead sent a written
explanation for comments aimed at Collins, his opponent in a world title
rematch on September 9.
The McCall row errupted when he arrived in the UK to prepare for the
Bruno bout. McCall appeared to suggest that Bruno could expect similar
treatment to that suffered by Gerald McClellan, who suffered a brain
injury after losing to Nigel Benn in a WBC super-middleweight title
fight. It was accepted McCall's statements were open to
misinterpretation.
Eubank, meanwhile, was carpeted for his ''lose your life'' comments at
Dublin's Collins.

MOST people are aware of the need to equip themselves with a wider
skills base in the Nineties, but for some, expertise in a specific field
can open even more doors.
Former Borders hill shepherd Jack Knox's love and knowledge of
sheepdogs has taken him to a new life on his own 210,000-acre ranch near
Kansas City in Missouri, and today he is recognised throughout the USA
as a leading authority on the training of sheepdogs.
Jack was born near Greenlaw in the Ettrick Valley, and for as long as
he can remember, he wanted to be a shepherd. He realised his dream in
the 1950s, leaving home at the age of 16 to become one of the three hill
shepherds at Ettrick Shaws Farm, looking after his share of 2000 ewes.
As jobs go, it was a hard life, but one that he loved. The work
started at dawn and finished at dusk, and varied depending on whether it
was the lambing, shearing or breeding season.
Each shepherd, working with his own dogs, was responsible for his
share of the sheep, checking for possible illness, watching them grow
and generally seeing to their everyday needs.
When he moved on from Ettrick Shaws, he worked in livestock hauling
for a short time until the yearning for shepherding became so
overwhelming that he returned to become shepherd manager at another hill
farm.
It was around this time, in the early 1970s that he had the good
fortune to meet some Americans at the Scottish National Sheepdog
Championship at Kelso, one of whom was Arthur Allen who was well known
in the US, particularly for his work with Roy Rogers.
Allen suggested that Jack Knox could have a real future in America,
working with a friend on a ranch in North Carolina. While his initial
reaction was to decline, he did eventually agree to go to the USA and he
set off in December 1971, to work with Fred Bahnsen, president of the
North American Sheepdog Society.
He took two Border Collies out with him, one of which was stolen in
transit. The other dog Bill turned out to be the means by which he built
the formidable reputation he has there today.
With Bill, he won his first competition at Delaware in June 1972 and
again a week later at the Blue Grass Trials in Lexington, Kentucky.
Through an informal chat at the trials, Jack met Chicago Tribune
photographer Laurie Rief, another sheepdog enthusiast, and they became
first friends and then partners, working from a base in Wisconsin. From
there, he began travelling all over the country with four or five dogs
before returning to Scotland to buy more.
Further success in the World Championships and the Canadian-American
Championships in the late 1970s led to his first invitation to judge.
Until that point, his establishment in the American sheepdog circuit
had been gradual, but an unexpected request by vet students to run a
clinic on the training of sheepdogs was to change everything.
It was so well received that different groups from all over the
country heard about it and made similar requests. That side of Jack
Knox's career snowballed and today he runs 35 training clinics per year,
travelling all over the North America and Canada.
The clinics involve the examination of handlers' existing training
policies, helping them to recognise, address and correct problems. He
has found that the clinics have also given him a different perception of
dog training.
''Looking at what is wrong makes you see how to do it right,'' he
explains. ''I don't believe in praise -- I believe in correction. Praise
might make you feel better, but correction always leads to improvement.
''You have to believe in what you are doing and there are three
important things related to both life and the training of dogs: respect,
trust, and a willingness to accept what is wrong so that you can make it
right.
''I watch the students and handlers and take the answers forward to
the next clinic. It is fascinating. Travelling and meeting people, I
have had more of an education than I ever had at school.''
In 1988, with the proceeds from another successful partnership in
Virginia, Jack and his wife Kathie bought their ranch in Missouri where
they keep 300 ewes, 25 cows, three horses and 27 Border Collies.
He travels to Scotland at least once a year, to see his family and to
buy dogs. ''I'm always looking for the better dog. I never buy dogs to
win competitions, but I buy to breed winners.''
When Jack left Scotland, there were no sheepdog training clinics, but
today there are government-run programmes and the top handlers go to
farms to train.
This all seems a far cry from the man and his dog up on the Scottish
hillside rounding up the sheep, and indeed many shepherds are content
with a dog that does the job adequately. Some see the trials and the
intensity of the training involved as being unnecessary, but Jack Knox
vehemently believes that the better the dogs are trained, the better
they handle the sheep.
Given that primarily he had always wanted to be a shepherd, does he
have any regrets about the life he has chosen?
''There are opportunities out there and it is all in a person's mind
whether or not they will take those chances. I didn't want to take my
chance at first, but since then, I have never made a wrong career move.
''I have some real hankerings about Scotland, about leaving family and
friends, but when I think about what the dogs have done for me, I know I
want to do it for them for the rest of my life.''

THE chief executive of FirstBus yesterday praised arch-rival
Stagecoach for improving bus services in Darlington, even though the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission recently accused the Perth-based
company of ''predatory and deplorable'' actions in the town.
It was Stagecoach's aggressive arrival in Darlington, adjudged to have
brought about the collapse of the town's municipal bus company, which
provoked the MMC's wrath.
Moir Lockhead, who headed Aberdeen-based GRT before its merger with
Badgerline to form FirstBus, acknowledged that the MMC report on bus
services in the north-east of England ''did highlight a number of things
the industry has to take account of and make sure we don't repeat''.
However, referring to Stagecoach's move into Darlington, he added:
''Now, when you see the quality of services that are being provided, I
think that has got to be in everybody's interest.''
When Stagecoach lost out in the local council's planned sale of
Darlington Transport Company towards the end of last year, its
Newcastle-based Busways subsidiary moved into the town.
Most of DTC's drivers were rapidly recruited, Busways registered
services on all of the council company's routes, and ran free services.
Successful bidder Yorkshire Traction pulled out of the proposed sale of
the council company, which was wound up days later.
The MMC considered Stagecoach's actions to have been ''against the
public interest''.
Although he recognised there was a case for tightening legislation
relating to the running of free services, Mr Lockhead believed the
public had ultimately benefited from Stagecoach's move into Darlington.
He said: ''The particular area they (the MMC) investigated had been a
badly-performing area for a number of years.
''What happened has produced newer vehicles and the quality of service
to the public is better than it was before.''
Meanwhile, FirstBus has decided not to bid for the first three rail
franchises to be offered to the private sector.
However, Stagecoach has indicated its interest in Great Western
Railways, which runs between London, Bristol, and Wales, South West
Trains, which takes in Exeter, Southampton and London, and the
London-Tilbury-Southend line.
It is now waiting on the shortlists of preferred bidders for each of
the three, expected next month.
Like Stagecoach, FirstBus has pre-qualified as a potential bidder for
ScotRail. However, the Government has yet to release the information
which will allow companies to decide whether or not they wish to
register their interest in the Scottish franchise.
FirstBus, which with 5600 buses is second in size only to Stagecoach,
yesterday announced pro-forma figures for the year to end-March showing
pre-tax profits of #24.8m on turnover of #329m. Stagecoach recently
announced record pre-tax profits of #32.6m, on sales of #338m, for the
12 months to end-April.

SMITH &amp; Nephew, the medical products group best known for its
Elastoplast and Nivea brand names, is one of the stock market's
perennial bid speculations and the chatter has increased lately as a
result of corporate activity in the health-care area.
But as the latest results confirm, there is little a bidder could do
to squeeze more performance from the well-managed group.
Underlying sales growth was 8% in the first half of the year against a
3% expansion in its markets which shows that Smith is still gaining
market share in spite of strong existing positions. But its profits
performance is steady if unexciting, with the latest figure up 4% at
#85.3m before exceptionals. It would have been 6% higher at constant
exchange rates.
As far as the group is concerned, takeover talk is sheer speculation.
Chief executive John Robinson declared: ''We have had no approaches and
had no discussions.''
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the American health-care group, is often cited as
the most likely predator but this has been said for years and if it was
interested in Smith it would surely have bid when the group was going
through a difficult patch a couple of years ago.
While a bid can never be ruled out, it is more likely to be Smith
which does the buying. Its gearing is 20% so it could afford at least
#500m in one fell swoop but a series of smaller deals looks more likely.
Chief feature of the first-half results was the way Smith maintained
its margins at 17.5% despite a sharp rise in raw materials costs.
Smith shares eased 4p to 191p as the first-half profits were near the
bottom end of expectations and analysts were inclined to shade their
full-year estimates. The interim dividend is raised 7% to 2.16p.

ALLIANCE Trust, the largest UK investment trust next to 3i and Foreign
&amp; Colonial in terms of net assets, considers the recently-strong UK and
US equity markets ''fully-valued''.
The Dundee-based trust, which has been increasing its exposure to
Continental European and Far Eastern stock markets, almost mirrored the
performance of the All-Share index during the six months to end-July.
Net asset value rose 14.6% to 2151p with the All-Share gaining 15%.
Alliance increased its interim dividend by 6.7% to 16p, which is
twice-covered by sharply-increased earnings per share of 32.64p. It also
expects to raise its final payout which was 35p last time.
The #1084m fund benefited from a significant improvement in investor
confidence during the first half with the Federal Reserve having
regained credibility as the US economy slowed down from earlier
unsustainable growth rates.
Alliance has also seen evidence of greater international co-operation
at recent G7 meetings. This has helped partially reverse the excessive
strength of the yen against the dollar.
The trust has also been reassured by moves towards more balanced
budgets in various countries and measures to aid Japan's financial
sector.
Alliance will be hoping the more realistic growth rate in the US does
not develop into recessionary pressure or revert to higher levels.
Managing director Gavin Suggett has a few worries about UK interest
rates during the medium term.
Believing there to be at most a ''precautionary'' case for a rate rise
at the moment, Mr Suggett said: ''It is virtually impossible to get the
timing right. It is not entirely obvious at the moment.''
Alliance envisages a slowdown in corporate profit growth in the UK and
US amid universal difficulties in raising prices to consumers.
It believes recent productivity gains, which have helped earnings,
will be difficult to repeat and believes unit labour cost increases may
take over from raw material price pressures.
However, Mr Suggett believes recent takeovers and bid speculation will
continue to support equity prices.
Alliance shares yesterday lost 5p to 1950p.

' Tomorrow's Zurich line-up is superior to that which contested world
gold in Sweden on Saturday '
COLIN Jackson will go to the start line tomorrow in Zurich for a 110
metres hurdles race which will inevitably be billed as the ''real''
world championship final.
Jackson was too injured -- in mind, perhaps, as much as body -- to
defend the title in the championships which concluded on Sunday in
Sweden. But his rehabilitation has been so swift that he is part of a
line-up superior to that which contested world gold here on Saturday.
Overall, there are at least five serious world record attempts on the
Swiss schedule -- one in the 3000m, where Scotland's Yvonne Murray
returns to action after her bruising fall in the 10,000m final.
She is listed in a 3000m field which includes Ireland's world 5000m
champion, Sonia O'Sullivan, and world record holder and 10,000m
champion, Fernanda Ribiero.
The Welsh world record holder, Jackson, will face the Gothenburg gold,
silver, and bronze hurdlers -- Allen Johnson, Tony Jarrett, and Roger
Kingdom -- plus Germany's European silver medallist, Florian
Schwarthoff, who fell in the semis, and his old arch-rival, Mark McKoy,
who also was injured and withdrew from the world event.
Jackson and Johnson have to win, each to prove he is the real
champion. Jackson, following his ill-advised defection from the UK
trials last month, raced in Italy, but then said he was unable to race
in Sweden.
The recriminations and angry exchanges with the British Athletics
Federation, he said, had destroyed the equanimity needed for the
championships.
He may suffer similar criticism now, having missed Sweden. But it is
fair to point out, however, that only he could assess whether his groin
problem would have survived four championship rounds. That is not the
same as being able, as he was, to run 13.17sec. in a low-key meeting at
the weekend.
Jackson, and Linford Christie whose name was still on the Zurich 100m
start list yesterday, will however, be paid even if they do not run -- a
minimum of $40,000, plus unspecified bonuses for status like world
record holder, or Olympic, world, or European champion.
Christie has confirmed that he is going to Zurich, and did not rule
out running -- strangely at odds with the valedictory tone he struck
when speaking of the extent of his thigh and knee injuries last week.
He even backed off retirement vows, saying that the Atlanta Olympics
now feature in his plans. ''If Merlene Ottey can do it in Atlanta, so
can I,'' said Christie, whose contradictory statements are now
destroying his credibility, though not his credit rating.
He and Jackson have already appeared in 35 TV adverts for the Zurich
Weltklasse meeting, whose paymaster, Patrick Magyar, has a budget of
$4.8m at his disposal.
''There are some people who are bigger than the sport,'' confirmed
Magyar. He added that most athletes who false start, or do not finish
their event, automatically lose their appearance fee. But Jackson and
Christie are exempt from this clause, he said.
The meeting in the Letzigrund Stadium is the first pay-off for the
Gothenburg medal winners. It is the equivalent of an Olympic Games in
one evening, with $50,000 for a world record, and half that for a
field-event one.
Zurich is the second of the so-called Golden Four meetings (Oslo,
Zurich, Brussels, and Berlin) which carry as their star prize, a stack
of 20 one-kilo gold ingots.
Anyone who wins their event in all four meetings lifts the pot, or
shares the bullion if there is more than one winner.
In Zurich, the gnomes' gold prices are scanned as carefully as
wind-guage readings which might invalidate a record.
With this incentive there is every possibility of more records in
Switzerland than in nine days of track and field in Sweden.
Kim Batten, who deleted Sally Gunnell's world 400m hurdles mark, will
have to defend her new status against the threat of Marie-Jose Perec,
France's flat 400m world champion.
Perec won the European Cup hurdles, but this will be by far her
highest quality race over barriers. Also due to race is Tonja Bufford,
who was inside Gunnell's mark to take world silver, and bronze
medal-winner Deon Hemmings.
It will be surprising, after his nine races in nine days, and gold at
200, 400, and 4 x 400m, if Michael Johnson can so soon deliver the world
400m record he expects this season.
His rivals include the record holder, Butch Reynolds, relay gold
medallist Derek Mills, and Britain's Roger Black.
Stateless Kenyan Wilson Kipketer, who won 800m gold for Denmark, will
attack Sebastian Coe's 14-year-old world mark; Noreddine Morceli
assaults his own mile record; the world 5000 and 10,000m champions,
Ismael Kirui and Haile Gebreselassie, meet over 5000m; and the world's
six fastest men -- all Kenyans -- line up in a 3000m steeplechase which
makes it, perhaps, the most vulnerable record of all.

EVERY apple has its worm, and every glowing summer has its wasps. This
year, however, we are besieged with the things. Of an evening in
Edinburgh, we like to sup alfresco, on the rear patio, as the sun tints
the leaves in our soft Morningside ecology.
This is meant to be a time of air warm as milk, the song of pleasantly
weary birds, cool drinks and witty repartee. It is, instead, reminiscent
of the last reel of King Kong. We lunge, wince, and start as angry
flying things dart around us.
No-one has ever seen so many wasps. A neighbour destroyed no fewer
than three bykes in his garden the other week. That's right: one garden,
three wasp-nests.
It is 16 years since I was last stung by a wasp and the experience is
not one I would care to repeat as in my adult life I have developed an
interesting selection of allergies, and for all I know a wasp sting
could slay me in two arrhythmic choking minutes of anaphylactic shock.
Peter, who lives next door to my parents and is very wise, says that
there are so many wasps because of our unusually mild and frost-free
winter. ''Far too many queens survived,'' he said, ''and so there's been
a population explosion. In fact, a lot of wasp colonies are actually
expelling workers -- surplus to requirements. Mass redundancies, you
could say.''
Really? How do the wasps like that? Are they members of Unison?
Peter's explanation makes sense. One afternoon in May sitting in the
gazebo, I saw no fewer than three queen wasps chewing at the timber for
byke-building. Now, believe it or not, I have nothing against queens. I
could have spread them to oblivion with one firm thump of a rolled up
Herald, but in them thousands of descendants would have perished, and of
a sweet spring evening I am not an agent of genocide.
Wasps are interesting and much misunderstood creatures. Most folk
detest them and know of no useful function they perform. They are
readily compared, to their disadvantage, with the useful bee. Wasps do
not make honey but they are ferocious killers of pests like aphids and
thrips.
In the spring Queen Wasp crawls from her hibernation and starts
breeding. First she builds a tiny byke from wood pulp, then she lays
fertilised eggs. Wasp larvae hatch and she feeds them on nectar and sap,
later on bits of dead insect. When they emerge from pupae, the worker
wasps enlarge the byke. And so the colony builds. There are various
sub-species of wasp: some build bykes in holes underground, and some
prefer external bykes, in hedges or under eaves or, if you are most
unfortunate, your loft.
Bykes can reach immense size, they are elaborate structures,
honeycombed with the most perfect hexagonal cells. Honey bees, by
contrast, build rather forlorn and wabbit hexagons, though many bee
keepers provided them with readymade honeycombe to save them the
trouble. Queen Wasp, surrounded by sufficient children, at length
devotes herself entirely to child bearing.
If bees are, so to speak, perfect communists, happily sustaining a
long-term society with total selflessness and order, then wasps are the
Nazis of the garden. It's all there: the melodramatic uniform, the
crazed-engine noise, the maniacal anger, the doom of Armageddon. Few
bees can sting you more than once, because a bee sting is barbed; given
time, a bee will wriggle itself free, but in the reality of human reflex
most bees are badly injured as the sting tears free, and they die. A
wasp sting is smooth, and a wasp can sting you gleefully and repeatedly.
A wasp colony never survives the summer. Something in wasps programmes
them to self destruct about late August or September. They lose their
taste for aphids, termites, thrips, and other nasty little things, and
develop a craving for sugar. It is at this point they become a great
nuisance. They buzz into your jam, and crawl into coke cans and ruin
your picnics and your elegant barbeques; they also become very
short-tempered and aggressive.
As the weather cools, wasps grow increasingly psychotic, workers
abandon the colony altogether and die where they may. Those workers who
remain, sting unhatched larvae to death before dying themselves. Only
the young queens live: they crawl forth, mate, and buzz off to find
winter abode under some slate or in the crevices of a wall. By October
in an awful Gotterdammerung, the wasp colony is finished, derelict; its
apartments empty, dead bodies all over the place, for all the world like
Hitler's bunker. Wasps never use it again. The following spring, the
futile if oddly noble saga is resumed.
Knowing all this puts the wasp problem into perspective, and unless
you have a serious threat or very young children a wasp colony should be
left in peace. Environmental health officers will destroy a byke inside
your house. If it's outside, you're on your own. A bucket of boiling
water or puffer-pack of derris powder will rapidly silence the yellow
peril. But you should wait until dusk when all are at home to be spared
an onslaught from the rear.
Vinegar is the simplest and best remedy for a wasp sting; the acid
neutralises the burning alkali. Just to make life difficult, a bee sting
is acid, so apply bicarbonate of soda solution. Get the two mixed up and
you will know it.
This year, says Peter, the wasps have turned delinquent early, because
of the population explosion. Hence the mid-air fights, the fascination
with human sweat and scent, the passion for what we eat and drink --
just as, in one of creation's practical jokes, we decided to take off
half our clothes and pratically live outside in this wonderful weather.
There is a sad tale of morality in all this. Has our own society not,
in recent years, grown increasingly waspish and less like the order of
the useful bee? Family breakdown accelerates. Savage violence stalks the
streets of Glasgow and Paisley. We have abandoned the ways of thrift and
industry. We waste our substance in easy credit, consume our planet's
resources in unsustainable ways, turn from vital religion to
superstition and horoscopes, rip off the poor in the National Lottery.
We should, as we swat and dodge and curse, learn a little from the
wasps' gloriously pointless cycle of life. And think of last year's
crumbling bykes, once-thriving orders of communities, not vaults of ruin
and death.

AT every movie festival around the world there exists an executive
producer, just off the plane from Hollywood, who stands in the shadows
of glamour, like a rumbling storm. Why is no-one making a fuss of him
instead of fawning over all these midget superstars and two-bit seminal
directors? He fumes inwardly at the question which has plagued him, and
his therapist, throughout his studio career.
Now that he is here in Edinburgh for the first time, it is surfacing
again, mottling him with sweat and the flame of high-blood pressure as
he observes the media dancing like fire-flies around actors in built-up
trainers, and guys in caps, who don't know who they are unless their
names are on the back of chairs.
Listen, he tells himself, these creeps would be nothing without Herman
Kotolsky, the executive director, and that night, at a cocktail party,
he collars a passing two-bit seminal director: ''Hey, smart guy, where
d'you think this anthill of egos would be without Kotolsky. You exist
only because of my fiscal blessing. When you call cut it's another
quarter of a million bucks over budget. When Kotolsky calls cut it means
decapitation. Now, stone me an olive, you miserable Thalberg
pretender.''
Twitching with contempt, the two-bit seminal director steers Kotolsky
towards the gazebo, where the executive producer now resembles a Bronson
stand-in stranded on a Merchant/Ivory set. Why did he travel here? He
last asked himself that question in Cannes, vowing he would never submit
to such lack of attention again. Yet here he is, the man whose
brilliance everybody overlooks. Well, goddammit, why should he be the
only one not to get out of the studio? But who cares about him, he's
just the executive producer.
Before he was in movies, Kotolsky was a stockbroker, and ages before
that a painter. Yeh, a painter, so no two-bit seminal director can tell
him about artistic imperatives. In fact Kotolsky personifies the Gauguin
syndrome in reverse -- the man who chucked art for the stink of money.
Now there's a screenplay . . . A crazy satire with Mel Brooks? Hell, no,
he says, he wants Jose Ferrer. But he's dead. So, he's dead already; we
go for Newman. Haven't we noticed that Herman Kotolsky has Paul Newman
eyes? Piercing, ironic, very duck-egg blue. Women have told him this.
Hell, Newman himself has told him this.
Oh sure, he says, the movie business is certifiable madness, but it's
like prospecting, digging on frantically avid for whatever nuggets turn
up in the sludge. And all that excited jabbering into phones. He knows
people who are on the phone so much they should have a phone implanted
in one side of their heads. There's a self-help book to be written on
how to get past the other guy's secretary, the one programmed to say:
I'm sorry he's on the phone right now.
Could the executive producer have been a great painter? Who knows? He
couldn't stand the solitude of just him and a creaking canvas. Each day,
he would climb the stairs to his San Francisco loft and just sit there,
brush in hand, palette on the side, praying for the phone to ring. And
when it did, mostly it would be his wife telling him to pick up some
prawn crackers for the kids. Painters never called, but why should he
care? Painters were a pain in the ass, either writing love letters to
themselves or sitting around being morbid about their work, threatening
to cut off an ear.
But movie artists, he says, they are children. Even those who see
themselves as auteurs are no different: Scorsese, Stone, Mamet,
Tarantino . . . they need firm stewardship, a tough foreman to ride hard
on their anarchical spirit. Kotolsky remembers one amnesiac director who
sacked Spencer Tracy on the first day of shooting: ''But if you sack
Tracy,'' he explained, ''We lose our star.'' ''Our star?'' replied the
alarmed director. ''Why didn't anybody tell me he was the star? Spencer
baby, you're the most blazing talent since Errol Flynn.''
Only one out of every 15 screenplays ends up in the cinema, but the
executive producer's trick is to keep the authors of all the rest on
hold for years, their panic seizures soothed with the kind of futile
promises which prove nothing -- except that the movie industry is the
only one where you can die of encouragement. Even midget superstars and
two-bit seminal directors don't have that kind of power. They may
snigger that Kotolsky has the artistic intelligence of a noodle pudding,
but, if he chooses, the executive producer can turn the whole goddam lot
of them into box office poison.

THERE was a time, as a teenager in the early sixties, when my summer
job was washing dishes, manhandling beer crates, renting deck chairs,
and cooking for the crews on assorted Clyde steamers and ferries.
I started on the Jeanie Deans and other excursion vessels which, in
those days, would be crammed with trainloads of day trippers, some from
as far away as Yorkshire, all expecting lunch and high tea along with
their sail doon the watter.
There were days when we would serve upwards of 500 people, in
sittings, with a freshly cooked lunch -- soup; poached salmon, potatoes
and salad; trifle, that kind of thing. Someone will write in and insist
you couldn't cram 500 people on to a paddle steamer, even then. But the
mountains of dishes I waded through suggested hordes, numbered in their
thousands, were swarming aboard.
As the seasons rolled on, I progressed to car ferries, plying the
routes between Gourock and Dunoon and Wemyss Bay/Rothesay. There I got
to cook for the crew. Roast lamb with all the trimmings for Sunday
lunch, lamb curry to wipe up the leftovers for Sunday dinner were the
peak of my culinary achievements at 17.
I also got to wash out the toilets. And when the barman was on day
off, I ran the drinking parlour down in the bilges too. We are talking
the hey-day of Polaris in the Holy Loch. We are talking long, snaking
queues of thirsty American sailors on furlough. When the sailing time is
20 minutes and the first of John Paul Jones's finest demands 17 lagers
and lime, life takes on a strikingly more hectic pace.
For those purists -- boy pursers in their time, perhaps? -- who cannot
see how anyone could regard a posting to dumpy little car ferries like
the Arran and the Bute as promotion over elegant craft like the Waverley
or the sleek Duchess of Hamilton, the answer is simple. Money. I could
work far more hours on the car ferries than I could on the cruise boats.
I could make a lot more money.
Basic pay for a humble galley slave like me was, if my memory isn't up
to its romanticising tricks, a few pence over #5 a week. But on the car
ferries, I could rack up mountainous overtime. Overtime paid at double
and treble time.
Starting before five in the morning, working till nine or 10 o'clock
at night -- sometimes to midnight, if the traffic was particularly heavy
-- six days a week, I could expect, on the special weeks when my hours
worked topped a hundred, a little brown envelope with nearly #20 in it.
It seemed like a small fortune. And, with free bed and board afloat
and little leisure time in which to dispose of their contents, the
envelopes accumulated. One season I made enough money to buy myself a
watch and my mother a fridge and pay cash for both. From a 1995
perspective it looks like a miserable pittance. In 1960 I thought I was
the Croesus of the high seas.
I occasionally think back to those times as the acrimonious debate
over rewards in the boardroom lumbers on from one revelation to the
next. Last week Labour was still banging away at an issue it clearly
believes is a vote winner. The party's latest tactic is to calculate how
many humble clerical trainees -- or galley boys? -- could be employed
for the price of just one chief executive on a quarter of a million a
year.
A variant on the theme is how long it would take someone on #2.50 an
hour to earn the #26,000 a year Lord Tebbit receives for his monthly
meetings as a non-executive director of British Telecom. Five years,
says Labour.
Back in 1960 I don't recall ever comparing my hard-earned small
fortune to what the suits on Gourock Pier, running Caledonian MacBrayne,
were taking home at the end of their week. I knew I was making a lot
more than the student pursers at the gang plank and took perverse
pleasure in that. But executive rewards were a closed book in the
stratified sixties.
Perhaps the one success, so far, of Labour's assault on ''executive
greed'' has been to raise popular awareness of who gets what at the top
and to expose how little rational basis there is for such reward levels,
other than fashion, what the market will bear, and a naive hierarchical
belief in senior executive performance being all that makes the
difference between successful and unsuccessful companies.
The problem with Labour's strategy is that it focuses almost
exclusively on the top and the bottom of the reward stakes. It ignores
built-in disparities affecting the mass of employees in the middle. And
these disparities are every bit as revealing as how many gas fitters or
call operators you could employ for one Cedric Brown or one Lord Young.
Recently I was leafing through a summer update of the management
remuneration database compiled by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes. The database
explores base salary movements in a whole spectrum of management
positions. The average UK corporate head of public relations, it tells
us, is now on #73,884, more than the average deputy chief executive. The
average head of finance is on #77,446, while even a more lowly financial
controller can expect nearly #50,000.
By way of contrast, a corporate head of manufacturing receives, on
average, #53,661. The average production manager is on just over
#30,000. The average head of research and development gets #48,301.
While the head of quality control bumps along the bottom of the
management heap, getting less than #29,000 a year.
It says something about British business, does it not, when
controlling the cash and the image of a company are rated, in the reward
stakes, nearly three times as valuable as controlling the quality of the
product or the production process itself.
The Lord Youngs and Cedric Browns are the easy targets in this issue.
It is time New Labour devoted some thought to the other reward
disparities which, I suspect, go some considerable way to explaining our
relative economic decline since I stopped washing dishes and conjuring
up curries off the Tail of the Bank.

THERE has been much speculation in the public prints about whether
Caledonian Publishing, of The Herald fame, is going to purchase the
Edinburgh and Aberdeen newspaper titles of Thomson Regional Newspapers.
The Diary can confirm that the Scotsman newspaper has written to our
managing director Liam Kane with an amazing offer. The letter to ''Dear
L J Kane'' begins: ''How 5p per week can be the best investment you've
ever made!''
It is not, however, a suggestion that Mr Kane will be able to take
over the Scotsman, Evening News, and Scotland on Sunday and pay it up at
a shilling a week.
The letter was an invitation to overprint Caledonian's name on a
quantity of Scotsman calendars to give away as freebies to suppliers.
The sales pitch, written in true marketing style, includes a sentence
which may go down in history: ''If you can ensure they immediately think
of L J Kane when they next want to do business, the battle is half
won!''
Steel yourself
MARLENE Sayers of Ballachulish has been telling us about how she
puffed her way through untold packets of Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes to
collect sufficient tokens for a set of saucepans. Hold the front page we
hear you say, but bear with us since this is a sad tale in many ways.
Sad because she received a letter from B&amp;H saying: ''Unfortunately, we
are unable to supply this item as the Japanese earthquake has affected
the stainless steel market and we have therefore had to withdraw it from
the catalogue.''
Sad for the Japanese who presumably used to make the stainless steel
before the earthquake. And sad that Scotland no longer has a steel
industry so we could make Marlene's saucepans for her.
Sibling rivalry
DEPT of Tenuous Claims To Fame: overheard in the National Galleries,

A SPORTING quiz question going the rounds of the Edinburgh pubs: in
the history of the Scottish football league, only one team is undefeated
and, in fact, has not lost a goal. Which one? We'll give you a clue.
They have played only one game.
Sparra sightings
MORE sightings of Duncan Macrae's Wee Cock Sparra. Ian Hamilton, the
QC and purloiner of the Stone of Destiny and SNP Euro-candidate, gives
an eye-witness account of the time Macrae was prevailed upon to sing the
ditty at a rally at Glasgow University Union in 1950 to promote the
rectorial cause of Scottish nationalist John McCormick.
Mr Hamilton says: ''When called upon to sing, Duncan Macrae replied
somewhat snootily that he was at the time under a pantomime contract to
entertain patrons of the Kings Theatre and no-one else. Bill Craig, the
union president, wasn't having this.
''He immediately gave the assurance that at the end of the song we
would show that we had not been entertained by giving him the bird.
Macrae was obviously delighted by the suggestion. He sang the Sparra and
we then noisily booed him off stage.''
Hugh Gibb Stuart of Bridge of Weir says he first heard this piece of
Scottish musical folklore in 1945 at Mandera, British Somaliland. ''It
was performed by C S M Ferguson of the 2nd British Northern Rhodesia
Regiment. He sang it much better than Duncan Macrae.''
Jean Faulds, who was an actress in the Curtain Theatre amateur drama
group, gets in touch with a detailed description of the genesis of
Macrae and the Wee Cock Sparra. ''At the Curtain Theatre's end-of-run
parties, the highlight was Bill Nicholson, a Glasgow engineer who did
the lighting, singing the Wee Cock Sparra. It was hilarious, complete
with actions, an outfit consisting of a suit several sizes too small for
him, and a coathanger as the bow and arrow.
''We were surprised when Mac (Macrae) turned up on television many
years later singing Bill's party piece. Bill told me he learned the song
when he was in the Boy Scouts in the 1920s.''
The very earliest sighting of the sparra is by Alexander Mackay of
Lenzie whose Auntie Nan learnt it at school in Houston, Renfrewshire in
1890.
* Mr Jim Groves of Norse Road, Glasgow, writes to say we were wrong to
state that in the song the sparra is murdered by the wee boy with his
bow and arra. It was, in fact, only attempted murder. The sparra
survived to chirp another day.
At which point we feel it is safe to lay the cock sparra to rest as a
subject for debate.
Tourist trap
ALL information to the Diary is welcome, even when it deals with the
more obscure aspects of the mores, social and economic, of our nation. A
source tells us that when representatives of a certain double-glazing
firm go on field trips to Islay, they take with them in their van a
number of cases of Buckfast, the tonic wine made my Devon monks and
consumed in great quantities by a certain strata of the Scottish
drinking class.
The Buckie is not for their own use. They swop it with the natives for
bottles of the fine malt whiskies which are produced on Islay and of
which, presumably, some of the locals see as an inferior bevvy to the
strong, sweet red wine of the Monklands.
Altogether now
A DIARY informant has seen fit to tell us that the VJ celebrations in
Aviemore, as publicised in the Strathspey and Badenoch Herald, are to be
concluded on Sunday August 31 with that well-known Japanese institution,
a karaoke with a mistress of ceremonies called Pearl. No, her second
name is not Harbour.

HSBC, Britain's biggest bank, yesterday announced it had boosted
first-half profits by 19% to #1737m. All HSBC's commercial banking
subsidiaries chipped in with better results. However, Kelso-born
chairman Sir William Purves cautioned that there are signs of economic
weakness in some areas.
Against the background of Barclays buying back a small amount of its
shares, Sir William said he did not feel HSBC had too much capital. He
is interested in making acquisitions but does not appear to be in any
great hurry since prices in the US, where HSBC is under represented, are
too high for his liking.
The group's Midland Bank subsidiary also raised its pre-tax profits by
19% to #527m. That was after making a #43m charge for reorganisation and
redundancy, with 660 people leaving in the first half and another 800 or
so to go in the current six months.
The First Direct telephone banking operation is in profit and gaining
about 9250 new accounts per month -- equivalent to three new small
branches -- and with total account numbers well above 800,000. New
accounts are expensive, so profitability is being depressed as the
business grows.
Unfortunately, the cost-income ratio remains high at 68% and Midland,
as do all the UK banks, faces the problem of growing income in a
ferociously competitive environment. In comparison, the overall group
cost-income ratio was 45% excluding Midland.
The subsidiary's profitability was helped by dealing profits of #107m,
compared with a #6m loss when the 1994 result was hit by substantial
#120m losses on bonds. Foreign exchange earnings were lower because of
reduced activity and traders not being skilful enough.
Investment banking was quieter, lowering the contribution from the
James Capel securities business. However, customer advances increased
8%, while the specific bad debt charge in the UK was #58m lower at just
#41m before a #25m general charge on the larger loan book, to indicate
almost certainly the bottom of the bad-debt cycle.
Overall group provisioning grew just #22m to #195m, including a
general charge of #87m, with the non-UK bad debt experience totally
insignificant.

THE decision to start their own business was not an overnight one for
Airdrie students Jacqui Hull and Gary Jamieson -- it started years ago.
A stint as managing director of a Young Enterprise company during her
sixth year at school gave 20-year-old Jacqui a taste for the cut and
thrust of the business life.
But it took four years for her dream to become a reality.
''I really enjoy running a business and Gary and I also love music. So
it seemed a natural progression to open a record shop,'' said Jacqui,
who recently qualified with a BA in Business Economics and Management
Science.
''The natural career progression on leaving college would have been to
go into a large company. But I had already decided that I wanted to be
my own boss some years earlier.''
Her partner Gary, 23, is completing his final year in audio
engineering and had no reservations about setting out on their own: ''We
had done our research and were convinced that there was a gap in the
market for an outlet for specialist musical tastes outside of the city
centre.''
Despite the research, one early problem was location.
''We first started to look at shops in the East Kilbride area and got
in touch with the East Kilbride Business Centre. They were brilliant,''
said Gary. ''They took us through our business plan and kept us right on
just about everything. However the problem was trying to find premises
in the town at the right price.''
At this point Jacqui spotted an empty shop for rent in Airdrie, at the
right price.
''It was now or never,'' she said. ''We went to Monklands Enterprise
with our business plan and they were equally helpful. They helped us
through our application for a business grant and invited us to attend a
marketing seminar where we spoke to other young people who were just
starting out in business as well.''
Funding the project was the next major hurdle -- but it turned out a
lot easier than they expected.
They managed to raise #2000 between them and a fellow audio
engineering student of Gary's, Stuart Hobbs, decided that it was worth
investing his time and money in.
''Obviously we were very apprehensive about approaching our bank
manager,'' said Jacqui. ''But we needn't have worried. He was impressed
by our business plan and agreed to supply the rest of the funding. And
with the help of Monklands Enterprise we managed to get an Enterprise
Allowance grant of #150 a month from the Lanarkshire Development
Agency.''
''The philosophy of the business is simple,'' said Gary. ''We want
people to come in and feel comfortable, relaxed and listen to what they
want to buy. We provide a service with a smile -- and the occasional cup
of coffee. If we don't have the record in stock we will try our best to
get it quickly. The requests vary from heavy metal, dance, through to
Indie. Only last week we had a woman who wanted some North American
Indian music which I have been chasing for her.
''We aim to sell specialist records to DJs. If they phone us with the
type of music they play then we can have a selection of the latest
releases waiting for them in the shop to listen to and pick the ones
they want, or we can deliver.''
Although only opened a few weeks, the Monklands duo have their eyes
set for the future.
''Our ordering system will also be linked to our marketing strategy,''
said Jacqui. ''We will also be compiling a mailing list to let customers
know about releases in stock. And in the future we hope to issue a
fanzine to provide up-to-date information on forthcoming events in the
area.''
The couple also hope to promote local bands in the clubs and discos in
the area and sell their music in the shop.
Long-term ambitions include opening another record outlet and they
hope eventually to have their own small independent record label.
''That would allow me to use my experience as an audio engineer and
keep the costs for the bands down, and Jacqui has the management and
marketing experience to promote them. And with Stuart also helping out,
its the perfect partnership,'' said Gary.
Said Monklands Enterprise Business Adviser, Larry Grant: ''We were
delighted to help the youngsters start up in business. They have
obviously done their homework and I'm sure they will make a great
success of it.
''Almost 30 new businesses have started up in the Monklands area since
January 1995 through the assistance of Monklands Enterprise.''

* LANNY Wadkins, the United States Ryder Cup team captain, yesterday
unsurprisingly added Fred Couples to the 10 players who had qualified
automatically after the last counting event, the US PGA championship,
but appeared to offer something of a hostage to fortune by selecting
Curtis Strange as his twelfth man.
Strange, aged 40, played the last of his four matches against Europe
in 1989. Shooting 68 in each of his last three rounds at the Riviera
Country Club must have convinced Wadkins.
The captain, describing his decision-making process as ''a tough
ordeal for me,'' explained: ''I wanted someone with heart and guts.
Curtis brings to a team what Watson and Floyd did before, he is a horse
for the course.''

DESMOND O'Neill accuses me of ''protesting too much'' (August 11).
Others have accused me of not protesting enough. I should like to
address some of the points raised in his extraordinary letter.
There is nothing odd about the fact that my letter (August 1) was not
written by the current editor of the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser,
Mr John Murdoch. We are permitted, indeed encouraged, to speak our own
minds.
Mr O'Neill asks of former editor Graham Isdale: ''Where is he now?'' I
fail to see the relevance, but I don't suppose Mr Isdale will mind me
revealing that he holds a senior position with PR firm Beattie Media.
Regarding sectarianism, Mr O'Neill says: ''The Advertiser cannot claim
that it was lily-white on this issue.'' Yes we can.
Mr O'Neill refers to ''attacks'' by reporter Eileen McAuley on the
late John Smith which he describes as ''disgraceful''. Clearly the point
was lost on the judges in the Bank of Scotland Press Awards of 1993,
when Ms McAuley was adjudged Local Journalist of the Year and Scottish
Journalist of the Year for her series of articles on Monklandsgate.
He also asks: ''Where is she now?'' Again I fail to see the relevance,
but for the record she is in Hamilton, in a promoted post with S&amp;UN's
free newspaper group.
Mr O'Neill waxes lyrical about the content of readers' letters
(''provocative'', ''outrageous'', ''frighteningly biased''). Apart from
wondering whom they might have frightened, I should have thought it
obvious that letters are almost invariably biased towards the authors'
opinions. That is the point of a letters page.
He says: ''The fact that the national press and media time after time
insulted the people of Airdrie and Coatbridge by continually referring
to 'Protestant' Airdrie and 'Catholic' Coatbridge has never been
challenged by the Advertiser.'' Yes it has. Consistently.
He also says: ''Unfounded allegations are no substitute for fact even
if they appear in the (unanswered) Black Report.'' The reason why the
Black Report and the Advertiser's original accusations remain unanswered
is that they are true.
Finally, Mr O'Neill's letter neglected to mention a minor
''declaration of interest'': he is a former Monklands district
councillor.

<HEADLINE>Montgomerie a helpless victim of fate</HEADLINE>

BEFORE the US PGA championship began at the Riviera Country Club last
week, Colin Montgomerie was saying that victory for a European would be
helpful to the morale not only of the tour but, of more immediate
importance, of the team to meet the United States in the Ryder Cup match
next month.
Montgomerie himself came agonisingly close to fulfilling this
desirable double ambition until he was beaten by Steve Elkington at the
first hole of a sudden-death play-off for the title. ''If I didn't think
I could win, I'd be at home with my family,'' Montgomerie prophetically
said.
Rightly, given his thoroughly professional attitude, Montgomerie was
disinclined to attribute this latest disappointment to fate's fickle
finger. On the other hand, he must be wondering what he has to do to win
any tournament, let alone one of the world's four major championships.
The fact is that since he won the German Open almost exactly a year
ago, Montgomerie has easily been the world's most consistent performer.
He has had 14 finishes in the first 10, including five second places,
and Montgomerie would be no less than human for not thinking he had
drawn the short straw often enough.
For example, it spoke volumes for the excellence of Montgomerie's game
through the green that he came to the final round only five strokes
behind the 54-hole leader, Ernie Els, despite having had 98 putts to 78
by the South African. And Montgomerie took three putts only once.
Montgomerie is readily categorised as one of those tortured golfing
souls burdened by the high expectations they have of themselves --
unwilling to accept standards lower than the best which others would
regard as satisfactory. His commitment to the cause can never be
doubted.
Although Elkington is an Australian he is essentially the product of
the American college system and the US Tour. To that extent the winners
of this year's four majors are all American reared -- Ben Crenshaw,
Corey Pavin, and John Daly having preceded Elkington in the Masters and
the US and British Opens.
That decidedly unusual mix can, as Jack Nicklaus noted at St Andrews
last month, readily be accounted for. Predicting that a player over 50
would one day win a major -- both these protagonists were a sprightly 32
-- Nicklaus cited the prevalence of more players becoming capable of
winning any event.
To a degree the absence of a dominant player, or players, can be
attributed to fitter, better equipped professionals who work at their
games as never before. Given the rewards, little wonder. All the same,
few seem willing to accept the burdens and responsibilities which
nowadays accompany celebrity and financial success.
Having three times now come close to winning an American major -- the
1992 and 1994 US Opens being the others -- and having endured so many
other frustrations, Montgomerie might be forgiven for wondering why he
should be the latest recruit to the army of those ''helpless victims of
inexorable fate''.
There was nothing Montgomerie could do after Elkington had holed his
20-foot birdie putt at the first play-off hole other than follow him in,
an improbable sequence. When winning to Montgomerie means not just the
most desirable thing, but the only thing, the depth of his dismay at
this latest rebuff may be imagined.
Perhaps it is this intensity of purpose, this unabated commitment to
excellence that is Montgomerie's ultimate betrayer. Otherwise, at this
stage of his career it seems that someone, somewhere, is lurking in wait
to do him a mischief which not even the most composed and artful golfer
can avoid.
If Montgomerie had won then the three birdies with which he so
courageously completed the final round, in the full knowledge that he
needed them to tie, would have gone down in history as one of the great
championship finishes. It still is, but the poignancy of the situation
is that it will now be less readily remembered.

FIRST of all, there must be sympathy for Monty. No man deserves to be
beaten in a photo-finish so many times, and certainly not when within
touching distance of the major glory that still tantalises him. There
will be people who will shrug their shoulders and dismiss Colin
Montgomerie, who lost at the first play-off hole in the US PGA
Championship on Sunday, as a ''choker'', a man who cannot climb the last
200 yards to the summit, one of the many talented sportsmen and women
who do not quite have the champion's resolution.
It is facile balderdash. Monty may deserve our sympathy for the moment
but, more important, he warrants our praise, our support.
He may not be the kind of star turn who says the right things all the
time and, indeed, has managed to behave with petted lip on so many
occasions that empathy is not readily forthcoming, but as Scots, we
ought to celebrate a talent that is perhaps the finest this country has
produced on a golf course.
Montgomerie is the best player in Europe, officially, is among the top
six in the world, officially, and currently is playing better than any
other golfer in Britain.
Bear in mind that golf is a truly worldwide sport, unlike some others.
The game is played at a high professional level in Europe, the USA, the
Americas, the Far East, Asia and the Antipodes. Our man is among the
best of them all.
If he had been blessed with the charisma of a McCoist and the
temperament of a Lyle, Monty would have been this nation's favourite
sportsman. He may still end up that way as he learns, perhaps painfully,
that he has to be able to hold on to his anger, to be the articulate
interviewee that he can be, even when he wishes to kick the clubhouse,
beat up his putter, and gouge the last green.
The rest of us have to attempt to cope with his perfectionism, because
it is that which drives him to excesses when he fails. There are few
enough Scottish sports people who could even aspire to that impossible
target and maybe we should be a little more tolerant of one who plays
the most difficult game of them all with such virtuosity.
Unlike many of his peers, here and in the US, Montgomerie does not
wish to settle for the comfy life, winning pots of money and maintaining
an adequate, if high, standard of play, without chasing the loftiest
targets. He wants to win, to be the best.
Montgomerie has not had a victory since he took the German Open a year
ago, but on the European Tour this season has finished in the top three
on four occasions, the top 10 on eight, and the top 25 eleven times. His
consistency has been remarkable.
To suggest that a player of this brilliance quits when the going gets
tough is nonsense. He won three big tournaments in Europe last year, the
Peugeot Open de Espana, the Murphy's English Open, and the Volvo German
Open, as well as losing in a play-off for the US Open.
Maybe he is trying a bit too hard when he lines up in the majors but,
for all his flaws, he proved again in Los Angeles that he is a Scottish
sportsman par excellence, or maybe that should be under-par excellence.
That brilliant show in America demonstrated, for me at anyrate, that
Monty's major day of glory has merely been postponed once more.

SCOTLAND team manager Craig Brown sat at Troon yesterday and saw the
nightmare continue as he attempted to prepare his team for the European
Championship game with Greece at Hampden tomorrow.
Strikers Duncan Ferguson and John Spencer have been forced out of
Brown's squad because of injury. At the weekend he suffered the trauma
of the Andy Goram ''will he, won't he play'' scenario being acted out in
the full glare of media publicity.
Yesterday, when he would have been entitled to have thought he had rid
himself of his problems, Brown found more. That these were of the
predictable kind could have done little to help his mood and yet, as he
looked over the links at Troon, he appeared to be less than troubled.
The worries which now have emerged concerned a crucial area of his
team, with Colin Hendry and Alan McLaren facing fitness tests today
which will decide the make-up of the team's defence against the Greeks.
However, somehow, Brown was able to keep smiling. ''The pre-match
preparations have been far from ideal,'' he said. ''In fact, for such an
important match they have not been what we hoped for.
''Yet we have to get on with the job. There is really nothing else we
can do. Look, if the worst comes to the worst we will lose two central
defenders but we have Tom Boyd, who plays in that area now for Celtic,
and Brian Martin of Motherwell and they can slot into that area.
''We have never known anything but a situation where we had to worry
over injuries. This is no different. It's only different in the sense of
where we have lost the players, in the parts of the team where we would
want the men who are missing.''
Brown believes that his luck will change, that he will get the two
doubtful members of his squad fit and ready for action. They will be put
through severe tests at Troon this morning and then, and only then, the
decision on their fitness will be made.
''We will not risk anyone who is less than l00% fit,'' said the
manager. ''Alan McLaren has a slight leg strain and he has trained with
the rest of the lads today -- but not full out and we will take another
look at him. But we are very optimistic about his chances.
''Colin Hendry is different in that he has not been training and
tomorrow will decide about him. The problem has nothing to do with his
close-season operation. It was a knock he collected at Kilmarnock last
week. But, knowing Colin, and knowing his attitude about playing for his
country, I believe he will be there on Wednesday.
''The players who are here want to give a swashbuckling performance
for the fans. We have got into this position where we are close to
qualifying and we want to show the support what we can do.''
That is a belief shared by Brown's squad and Hibs' striker Darren
Jackson, who looks sure to start the game, probably alongside Duncan
Shearer, said yesterday that it would be agonising if the Scots had to
sit on the sidelines and watch England hosting a party they were not
attending.
Jackson admitted: ''This is the biggest game I have been involved in
and I know that the other lads feel the same. The idea of sitting at
home when all these big games in the finals are going on in England next
summer, well, you just don't want to think about that.''
Jackson is one of three players who will make their Hampden debuts for
their country. He pointed out: ''This is the first of my caps I have won
at home, if I am selected, and it's the same thing for Duncan Shearer
and Colin Calderwood, if they play. That is very important for all of
us, to play in front of the home support and, hopefully play well.
''I certainly know that this is the time for me to deliver the
goals.''

YOUR article, Children of the lesser gods (July 24), was full of
mistakes and accusations.
The books of the ''discredited Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh'' (as you call
him) are currently available in over 30 languages worldwide and are
distributed by major publishers in many countries.
His discourses are currently beamed into some 100 milion homes around
the world, including 400 US cities. There are over 500 meditation
centres conducting his meditations.
As to the idea that he ''employed'' power, sex, and money -- a little
research will reveal that he regards money as currency, to be kept
current and allowed to flow.
He regards sex as a natural function that is repressed by the
religions, the result of which is pornography and perversion.
He regards power as a force that can be either used or abused
depending on the consciousness of the user.
You mention the old issue of ''mind control''. Even Inform, the
official cult watch organisation in the UK, discounts this idea which
also has no scientific basis.

THE privatisation of coal mining in Britain has had obvious effects,
the most visible of which is a rush to drag coal from the ground at the
cheapest cost. On the face of it there is nothing wrong with this. At a
superficial level anyone who proposed mining for coal at higher cost
would be branded a lunatic. Unfortunately the arguments about the cost
and method of retrieving coal are a good deal more complicated than is
often pretended, and propagandists attempting to bolster their arguments
with simple figures should be regarded with the greatest suspicion. That
degree of scepticism is already applied to the growing number of
companies who wish to mine coal in Scotland and elsewhere in Britain by
open-cast methods. There is a worldwide move towards this sort of coal
mining because it appears to be relatively easy and cheap, but there are
plenty of arguments of an environmental, economic, and strategic nature
which flatly deny the apparent advantages.  The most obvious of these
are environmental, for of all the abuses which can be inflicted on the
landscape, open-cast mining is certainly one of the worst. It is not a
new technique but it is a uniquely destructive one. In a sense this
mattered less with earlier open-cast mines because many of them were
developed on derelict and mostly barren ground.
In these early developments the techniques brought forward for
restoring the landscape often improved it. Formerly barren ground became
relatively fertile and a good deal nicer to look at. Sites of this sort
are less easy to find nowadays, and the growing number of applications
for open-cast mines are mostly to be found on ground which has value as
landscape, for fertility and for diversity of plant and animal species
and for human residence. Ormiston village in East Lothian falls into
this category, although the proposal to develop two large open-cast
mines on its boundaries offends more than most. The villagers of
Ormiston are right to be dismayed and angry; they are equally right to
be planning the most determined resistance. Various honeyed words will
pour from the developers. Great play will be made of techniques to
reduce the impact. All of this will sound impressive and expensive but
none of it will put the area around Ormiston back as it was should these
proposals go ahead.
It is relatively easy to restore the natural contours once mining is
finished, but this will mask greater problems. The underlying natural
drainage of a site is destroyed by open-cast mining and is difficult to
restore by artificial means. The carefully stored top soil will have
lost much of its fertility and those natural gardeners, the earthworms,
will have mostly died. Nor will there be anything like the plant
diversity originally present. The impact on people around the site will
be even greater. Noise, dust, traffic pollution and, if a recent medical
report is to be believed, ill-health associated with open-cast
operations, will not be compensated by the very few jobs brought to the
area. The villagers of Ormiston, and of the other communities around
Scotland which face this prospect, may look to the Scottish Office for
protection, but they may be disappointed because last year the Scottish
Office brought in new guidelines to stop local authorities ruling out
certain areas for open-cast mining.    Other factors are worth
consideration: the economics of open-cast are not clear, for although it
is initially cheaper than a deep mine, the latter sort produces coal
more cheaply once it is up and running. More seriously, the world may
not always supply us with cheap gas and coal from abroad. Sooner or
later we may have to mine for coal again for our own needs, and if the
skills, machinery-making, and techniques of deep mining have been lost
to the perversion of open-cast, we will be in a serious situation
indeed.

WITHOUT wishing to comment on other greenfield housing locations in
Strathclyde, I feel I must respond to the Scottish House-Builders
Associations' view in respect of the Hamilton Western Expansion Area
(July 26).
Although I accept that the HWEA is not an easy site to develop it is
progressing well. The link to the East Kilbride Expressway has been
completed despite the SHBA's belief that it has not.
It has always been the intention since 1992 (as indicated in the
Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone scheme) to access the HWEA through the
Hamilton International Technology Park, a high quality business and
technology park and not an ''industrial estate'' as described by the
housebuilders' representative.
The Lanarkshire Development Agency which owns the Enterprise Zone
site, has indicated that it needs time to market the zone. I believe
this is reasonable and provided that this does not exceed three years I
would expect development at the HWEA to commence within the target time
frame identified in the Strathclyde Structure Plan Review, 1995.
Finally, the identification of the requirement for a primary school,
community facilities, structure landscaping, etc, in the master plan for
the HWEA only goes to show that the planning system works efficiently
and effectively.
Rather than being the fiasco claimed by the SHBA, the planning and
implementation of the HWEA is an example of planning working
constructively in partnership with local authorities, public agencies,
and the private sector.

SENIOR internationalists met the Scottish Rugby Union last night in an
effort to put flesh on the bones of last week's historic announcement
that the SRU would go to the International Board meeting in Paris in a
fortnight armed with a mandate to embrace professionalism.
The talks, between Scottish IRFB representative Freddie McLeod and
Scotland's senior players -- who are still in the dark as to what
professional rugby means to them -- represented the first meeting
between the players and Union since the announcement that, after IRFB
sanction, the SRU intends paying the players and placing them under
contract.
''We had a very good meeting,'' said MacLeod, ''and have agreed to
convene again after the IB meeting in Paris when, hopefully, the
amateurism issue will have been thrashed out.
''We did not talk in detail about money other than to say that the
figure of #35,000 a season which has been talked about is a sum that the
Union could not afford. To their credit the players seemed to appreciate
this.''
The meeting was attended by McLeod, SRU chief executive Bill Hogg,
director of rugby Jim Telfer, and senior committee man Ken Crichton, of
Stirling County.
The players were represented by Rob Wainwright, Scott Hastings, Kenny
Logan, Ian Jardine, Jeremy Richardson, Craig Joiner, and Peter Wright.
One of the players who attended the meeting said: ''We weren't really
told anything that we didn't know from reading the newspapers. The
situation is moving so fast that I think that we are going to have to
meet as a squad soon to consider the situation and agree our response.
''We were told that we wouldn't be getting 35 grand a season but, to
be honest, we knew that. We hear what players in the Southern Hemisphere
are being offered by their unions to prevent them going with the Packer
circus and the sums make you think.''
The meeting in Edinburgh took place against a backdrop of activity in
the Southern Hemisphere where the implications of Kerry Packer's World
Rugby Corporation attempt to establish a rebel, professional game
continues to perplex the South African, Australian, and New Zealand
unions who have a #370m broadcasting deal with Rupert Murdoch.
The New Zealand RFU has offered its players three-year contracts worth
#300,000, and it appeared yesterday as if the All Black squad would sign
up with the official body.
In Johannesburg, Loius Luyt, president of the South African Rugby
Football Union, has condemned the WRC and rejected an invitation to have
talks on the future of the game.
Luyt phoned a TV talk-show to take issue with WRC director Ross
Turnbull, in the country to negotiate player contracts. Luyt said a
recent court ruling in Cape Town, dismissing a WRC attempt to block
SARFU contract negotiations with players, was a defeat for Packer's
group.
New Zealand Test players have met with union officials, captain Sean
Fitzpatrick, and chief contracts negotiator Jock Hobbs. Both indicated
that the players were leaning towards signing with the establishment.
Fitzpatrick said the players want the uncertainty regarding their
futures resolved soon. ''I'd like to think everything would be tidied up
by Friday,'' he said.
In Australia, the union and WRC have agreed a temporary truce as
Wallaby players decide which side to back in the battle for control of
the sport.

Margaret Vaughan reports on an Italian resort's plan to use traffic
wardens to fine fat people on its streets
LET it be understood that Signor Andrea Guglieri, mayor of the Italian
resort of Diano Marina, has nothing against horses in principle but
there is a limit to how far people should be allowed to resemble them.
His office was under siege yesterday, fending off calls from irate,
fat, bikini-wearing tourists insulted by his insistence that wobbling
bosoms and less-than-taut buttocks constitute an environmental hazard.
(Well, okay, I gave his telephone number to my sister and one or two
chums).
The mayor's personal assistant, who perhaps understandably declined to
be named, insisted yesterday that Signor Gugliere was far too busy doing
mayoral duties to come to the phone to explain how his novel system of
sparing the aesthetically-sensitive the trauma of close encounters with
spare-tyres will work.
But, she wants you to know, he is equally averse to male ugliness on
the streets of the town. ''He has a, how you say, a repugnance, yes, to
'orses, so is most particular that in town people should not be allowed
to seem like them. Mens, womens, is all the same,'' she explained. He
is, she strenuously confirmed, a wholly non-sexist body fascist: ''He
likes good bodies and you should not be inflicted by grotesqueries.''
Under Signor Guglieri's proposals, women wearing bikinis, or less, are
to be stopped and checked by the town's traffic wardens. They will have
to pass eight out of 10 requirements, or face spot fines. The mayor
intends to introduce a fine system based on flab. The stringent body
checks -- ranging from bust mass to thigh strength -- will not, however,
apply on the beach. Only those caught wobbling freely in town will by
subject to fines.
The details of how rear ends are to be measured or bosom wobble
assessed has still to be worked out precisely. However, a Milanese
Catholic University professor of aesthetics has been appointed as an
independent arbiter. He is to set up the guidelines to which women must
comply.
Such excitement has been generated by the plans, said Signor
Guglieri's assistant, that she had not yet had time to respond to
numerous requests for photographs of her boss.
No, he himself was certainly not ugly, did not resemble a horse and,
yes, he did wear shorts. They were, however, tasteful, well-cut shorts.
A circumspect request for details of mayoral body mass, thigh strength
and wobble factor, unfortunately, met with the sort of response you
might give somebody who asked Nelson Mandela to give a tune on his old
banjo.
''Scusi? Scusi? Senator Guglieri has nobody to be ashamed. He is not
fat, he is not ugly. He is a sensitive man, you understand? A serious
politician, cleaning up our streets. Do you not have such excrescence on
your streets?''
Oh yes! It was, of course, a moot, even sore, point in a city where
the combination of high temperatures and Festival fever has turned
public gatherings into mass meetings of nylon shorts, where streets
heave with scrawny legs, glistening bellies and damp, scratchy armpits
poking out of geeky vests, where crowds resemble a painting by Munch,
costumed by C&amp;A: it was hard not to empathise, just a bit.
However, a call to the office of the Lord Provost of Edinburgh -- a
man not averse to flashing a shapely knee in public, favouring as he
does the kilt as his evening wear delight -- failed to elicit any
sympathetic response to Mayor Guglieri's proposal. Failed, in fact, to
elicit, any response whatsoever, beyond a feeling that such questions
were proof that the sun was doing its worst to stew the brains of all
correspondents into asking such ludicrous questions.
''You what? Um, I don't think the Lord Provost is available just
now.'' (Semiologists please note, sub-text reads: Are you feeling all
right dear?. Would you like to sit down?)
But what if, say, Pavarotti wished to grace the piazzas of Diano
Marina with his not-inconsiderable presence? How would the mayor
respond?
''When does he ever wear bikinis, eh, eh? You tell me! And you, you?
Are you fat? Tell me truth? Why do you care? Who are you to be a
mockery?''
Oh yes. It was, of course, a moot, a sore point.

* Almost 70% of young people questioned by a Scottish drugs
information project had used drugs in the past six months, including
cocaine and ecstasy.
A survey of 976 people between the ages of 15 and 28, carried out by
Crew 2000 in Edinburgh and the Lothians earlier this year, showed the
use of a range of drugs among 636 -- cannabis (66%), amphetamine (33%),
ecstasy (24%), Temazepam (19%) and cocaine (10%).
Crew 2000 was established in 1993 and opened the UK's first drugs
information shop two months ago.
Yesterday, project co-ordinator Liz Skelton released the Edinburgh
results at the shop in the city's Cockburn Street.
It showed that as well as 67% of those questioned having used drugs in
the previous six months, young people also showed little knowledge of
some drugs.
The survey also showed young people using drugs having engaged in
''risk behaviours'' -- 84% reported mixing drugs with alcohol, 55%
reported having unprotected sex, and five per cent had injected drugs.
Crew 2000, which is receiving #25,000 a year from the Scottish Office,
described the figures showing the extent of unprotected sex as
''distressing and frightening''.

Christian von Arnim unravels the background to the conflict in Kashmir
which led to the beheading of Norwegian hostage Hans Christian Ostroe
THE MURDER of the Norwegian hostage Hans Christian Ostroe by militants
in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir is but the latest instalment in
a brutal struggle between the Indian authorities and separatist forces.
Kashmir has been disputed territory between India and Pakistan ever
since partition in 1947, when its Hindu ruler opted to take his
predominantly Muslim state into India.
When fighting subsequently erupted between Hindus and Muslims, both
countries moved regular army units into the state, leading India to call
for UN assistance. As a result, the world body established a provisional
demarcation line leaving the larger part of the state under Indian
control.
Attempts at arbitration failed, however, and in 1957 Kashmir was
formally integrated into the Indian Union despite protests from Pakistan
and the UN. India has always resisted holding a plebiscite, because it
knows that the majority of the population would opt to leave India. The
government's frustration of a settlement at that time laid the
groundwork for the present strife.
But although India and Pakistan have gone to war over the province on
a number of occasions, it has in recent years been the Muslim insurgency
which the government in New Delhi has been unable to quell, either
militarily or by other means. Indeed, the opposition in Kashmir is far
from united, with some groups wanting to achieve independence from both
countries while others want union with Pakistan.
But the one thing which Ostroe's death has achieved is to unite the
often fragmented opposition. Members of the Islamic umbrella
organisation Hurriyat Conference, a coalition of Kashmiri social,
political and religious groups, unanimously condemned the killing as a
''crime against humanity''. For all the groups realise that they are in
danger of losing the sympathy which their cause has enjoyed around the
world against a background of brutality by the Indian security forces in
the attempt to put down the rebellion.
Accounts of rape and torture in routine security operations by Indian
forces have been well documented by human rights organisations such as
Amnesty International. At the same time, Muslims are made to feel like
second-class citizens with accusations that important positions are
mostly filled by Hindus and that New Delhi fails to provide sufficient
resources for the state.
The callous nature of the killing -- the severed head was found some
20-metres from the body and the name of the kidnap group, Al-Faran,
carved into the stomach -- has caused widespread outrage. It has drawn
attention to one aspect of the struggle which is not so well reported.
The fate of Ostroe and his fellow hostages has provoked international
attention because they are foreigners. But as well as criticising the
Indian military and paramilitary forces, Amnesty International has for
some time raised its concern about the many Indian civilians who are
regularly held captive by armed groups in the state. Most recently, it
cites the case of a villager who was abducted and killed last month, as
well as the kidnap of six officials from the State Forest Corporation
and four Kashmiri journalists, including the editors from two newspapers
in the state capital Srinagar. Their fate remains unknown.
One curious aspect of the whole affair is that Al-Faran is completely
unknown, even to Kashmiri separatist organisations. It shows the depth
of the dispute between India and Pakistan that the two neighbours have
been quick to denounce one another over the killing.
The Indian government has long maintained that Pakistan arms and
trains the Kashmiri militants and an official from the Jammu and Kashmir
government has claimed that Al-Faran is a front for the Pakistan-based
Harkat-ul-Ansar. Pakistan denies giving anything but moral and political
support to the separatists and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was quick
to condemn the killings, as were all the Muslim groups in Kashmir.
While India was busy pointing the finger at Pakistan, Islamabad's
ambassador in Bonn accused India of kidnapping and murdering Ostroe in a
bid to discredit the Muslim liberation movement in Kashmir. Indeed, the
ambassador repeated the point made by other Muslim groups like the Jammu
Kashmir Liberation Front, that, ''this act is not conducive to
struggle'', as the front's representative in London put it. Who you
choose to believe depends on your sympathies.
The Indian government is in a difficult position over what to do next.
None of the three options available -- accede to the kidnappers' demands
to release militants, continue to negotiate the release of the hostages
but refuse to give in to Al-Faran's demands in the hope that the group
will not carry out its threat to kill more hostages, or try to mount a
commando-style rescue operation -- offers a palatable way out. Hence the
emergency meeting on Sunday evening with the countries whose nationals
are still being held, Britain, America and Germany.
At the moment the balance is still tipped in favour of continued
contact and negotiation with the group, but if more hostages are killed
the pressure to mount a rescue operation will become considerable, since
it will be argued that if the captives are going to be killed anyway,
there should at least be an attempt to free them, even if such an
operation is fraught with difficulty.
What is clear, however, whichever way the present hostage drama is
resolved, is that until a political solution to the Kashmir problem is
found which takes adequate account of the wishes of the population of
the state, this will not be the last crisis facing the Indian
government.

A leaked Railtrack memo on safety standards gives weight to warnings
by opponents of privatisation that fragmentation could put lives at
risk, writes Elizabeth Buie
ACCUSATIONS about its safety procedures have dogged Railtrack since it
was hived off from the operating companies, giving politicians and
unions the chance to claim that safety was being sacrificed in the race
for profit.
However, the leaking of the memo from Railtrack safety manager Jack
Rose to the company's director of its major projects division, Gil
Howarth, warning of ''another Clapham'' unless new safety procedures are
implemented is the first real indication of concern within the
organisation.
It was against the advice of British Rail chiefs that Government
Ministers decided to separate infrastructure from train services,
replacing the unified network with a separate structure made up of
nearly 100 different bodies. And last year, when Railtrack took over
BR's 2500 stations and 11,000 miles of track, critics warned that
changing long-established chains of command could be dangerous.
Jack Rose, when he poses the questions in his memo whether Railtrack
knows or understands how safe its staff are, whether it has a proper
safety assessment procedure for its senior management, and whether it
has a means of assessing safety risk or of identifying the root cause of
risks that do arise, would appear to be giving grist to the critics'
mill.
And as advances in train speeds are made, with some trains expected to
reach 125mph, rail unions are claiming that cost-cutting is threatening
safety thresholds.
After the Clapham train crash, which cost 35 lives in 1988, the then
Transport Secretary, Cecil Parkinson, promised the House of Commons that
finance would be no obstacle to implementing all safety recommendations
in the report of the judicial inquiry.
In all of the five main fatal accidents since and including Clapham,
the Railway Inspectorate has recommended the adoption of automatic train
protection (ATP) systems, an in-cab integrated computerised system which
prevents trains from travelling too fast or from going through red
lights.
However, in March of this year, the Government announced the
abandonment of the #700m ATP system because it was too expensive. One
rail union described it as the ''economics of the graveyard''.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, who was then Transport Secretary, said that he had
been advised by British Rail, Railtrack, and the Health and Safety
Commission, that fitting ATP throughout the network ''cannot be
justified because the costs far outweigh the benefits''.
Lew Adams, the general secretary of Aslef, said then that his union
believed that ATP could have prevented accidents over a five-year period
-- including Clapham, Bellgrove in March 1989, and Newton in 1991 -- in
which 48 people were killed and more than 1000 injured.
A spokeswoman for Railtrack in Scotland denied yesterday that the two
Scottish accidents could have been prevented had the ATP system been in
place. Both Newton and Bellgrove had been blamed on single-lead
junctions and the layout had been altered following fatal accident
inquiries. ATP could only stop a train in certain circumstances, she
said. It was not a panacea for all ills.
Last year's fatal accident at Branchton, on the Glasgow to Wemyss Bay
line, had been caused by concrete blocks being placed on the line. In
fact, vandalism was the biggest safety risk posed to Railtrack, she
added.
The crash at Largs station last month is still being investigated, its
cause as yet undetermined.
Meanwhile, the unions continue to lay the blame for safety
shortcomings firmly at the feet of the god of privatisation.
Tony West, assistant general secretary of Aslef, said: ''Drivers today
have so many pressures on them that it becomes quite intolerable. Much
of the industrial unrest that we are having and have had over the past
few months is because of the sheer frustration felt by drivers at the
pressures that are placed on them in all sorts of areas.''
He added: ''We are having a lot more reports coming into the office
generated through our health and safety representatives and our elected
members out there in the field about deep concerns felt by drivers on a
number of safety issues.''
Phil McGarry, the Scottish divisional organiser for the other main
rail union, the RMT, said: ''A lot of our members who have attempted to
stop unsafe practices have been blocked by managers. If a safety
representative says, 'This is an unsafe practice', that safety rep' is
in a very vulnerable position. The manager's aim is to cut corners to
get work finished because of the commercial and financial
implications.''
His comments may be significant in the light of one section of Mr
Rose's leaked Railtrack safety memo where he refers to two accidents in
the South of England which, he claims, would have been disastrous were
it not for the fact that the train bodies were of a modern design.
''In these particular cases the vehicle operators compounded a serious
mismanagement of safety when they should have refused to carry out work
(as allowed for in staff rules) that they knew, or should have known,
was contrary to safe practice and downright dangerous. Are staff
adequately aware of the refusal-to-work procedure or is the safety
training we give them inadequate?'' asked Mr Rose.
Mr McGarry poses another question on behalf of the RMT. ''Railtrack is
one of the authorities which can approve a licence for other operators.
Railtrack is in the position to decide one way or the other if these
operators are safe -- but if it has not got a safe system regarding its
managerial system, is it competent itself to approve an operator's
licence?''
The annual report of the Rail Users' Consultative Committee for
Scotland is soon to be published, but in the interim, Lawrence Kemp, the
committee's depute chairman, said: ''Last year in particular there were
a lot of areas affecting the infrastructure. We will be raising a lot of
issues over signalling, track or culverts and how quickly Railtrack
responded to major issues.''
As calls grew for the Government to abandon its plans to sell off the
railways, in particular Railtrack, Labour's transport spokesman, Henry
McLeish, claimed that the Government was planning to bring forward its
flotation of Railtrack to March 1996.
''That would mean that the receipts from the sale would fall into this
financial year and with the Government overspending its Public Spending
Borrowing Requirement, Treasury pressure is pushing that way,'' he said.
The questions now facing the Government are whether its dash for cash
is likely to outstrip its safety programme and whether the weekend's
leaked memo will put off already wary investors or likely franchisees.

JACK WEBSTER meets a Scot haunted by his role in scuttling a fleet of
ships in Burma
I looked in utter disbelief at what we were doing. It was a supreme
act of denial
AMID Japanese apologies, Alister McCrae views the Campsies from his
garden at Killearn and recalls a part of his life which will forever
haunt him with bitter-sweet memories.
For this sprightly 86-year-old represents a breed of Scots who found a
career in colonial Burma with the remarkable Irrawaddy Flotilla, the
greatest river fleet in the world.
It was a Scottish company which plied 650 ships up and down that
jugular vein of Burma, but found itself, in the Japanese invasion of
1942, ordering staff to scuttle its beloved fleet.
Alister McCrae had gone straight from Glasgow High School to work for
the Clyde shipping company of Paddy Henderson, whose Victorian bosses
founded the Irrawaddy Flotilla as a sister company. For bright young
men, the ambition was to be transferred to the magic of the Orient.
By 1933, McCrae was in that enchanting land of pagodas, one of 25
Scots on the executive staff, with 200 more as officers on a fleet
largely built by Denny's of Dumbarton. The flotilla had a total staff of
15,000.
From Rangoon he was promoted to take charge at Mandalay but, by 1941,
with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Rangoon was now being bombed.
The reigning boss of the Irrawaddy Flotilla was the ebullient John
Morton, son of a Glasgow baillie, who had to face the crisis that the
Japs would soon be invading.
''The 48 Armoured Brigade arrived and General Alexander flew in for a
last desperate effort to save Burma,'' Alister McCrae recalls. ''But not
even the future Field-Marshal could perform miracles. It was time to
evacuate the civilians, including my wife Margaret and young son Graham,
who reached Darjeeling.
''Rangoon was deserted but I remained with a small group known as the
last-ditchers, whose task was to get our ships up north,'' he says.
The British Army was in full retreat, however, and the men of the
flotilla found themselves ferrying the troops first across the Irrawaddy
and then its tributary, the Chindwin.
''We knew we were trapped and I was terrified the Japs would get us,''
McCrae remembers. ''We knew what might happen but didn't know till later
how bad the atrocities could be. The Japs were just hours away as we
ferried the troops.''
Then came the traumatic experience of a lifetime for anyone who served
the Irrawaddy Flotilla -- the order to scuttle the fleet so the Japs
wouldn't get it.
Imagine the heartbreak of John Morton, as revealed in his diary on
April 28, 1942: ''We are being chased out even quicker than expected.
Imagine how I felt drilling holes in the ships' bottoms with a Bren
gun.''
Morton had sent McCrae to take charge on the Chindwin, where there
were more ships to be scuttled. In all, they sent 550 to the bottom.
Ironically, among soldiers helping with the destruction was Eric Yarrow,
whose family had built some of those vessels on the Clyde.
''I have not got over it to this day,'' Alister McCrae told me. ''I
looked in utter disbelief at what we were doing. It was a supreme act of
denial. By the time the monsoon was over the ships would be silted up
and not recoverable by the Japs.''
McCrae made his escape and joined the Indian Army. John Morton flew
home to Glasgow, already planning his new flotilla and, by November
1942, had set sail for India -- on a ship that was never heard of again.
With victory over Japan, McCrae returned to Burma: ''We thought we
might have a few years but the nationalists had completely taken over.''
The Attlee Government had promised independence and McCrae, who was
now in charge in Rangoon, was soon told that his beloved flotilla would
be nationalised. There was nothing for it but to say goodbye to that
land of charms.
He rejoined Paddy Henderson in Glasgow, became senior partner and
rounded off a distinguished career as chairman of the new Clyde Port
Authority -- a man with a mixed memory of horror, humiliation and a
great deal of happiness, lingering still from those distant days of the
British Empire.

Bob Burns, a POW for four years, tells Kirsty Scott of his experiences
at the hands of the Japanese
THE photograph is faint with age and the criss-crossed folds have all
but obliterated some of the earnest young faces. On the back, squeezed
into every available space, is a neatly pencilled list of dates and
exotic place names.
Bob Burns carried the photograph with him for the four years he was
held as a prisoner of war by the Japanese. Four years in which he was
beaten, starved to a weight of six stones, locked for a month in the
hold of a ship with hundreds of others, and worked almost to death on
the Burma railway.
The boys and young men in the picture were the Carntyne Scouts and the
scribbles on the back are the names of the camps and detention centres
where Bob was held in the Far East.
Now 76, he likes to think it was the independent spirit fostered in
the Scout troop that saw him through his POW ordeal.
He's sitting in the front room of his neat Lenzie home. The decor is
pastel and elegant and the only indication of his past is the stout grey
storage box on his knee. In it are the remnants of his POW life; bleak
pre-scripted telegrams from the Imperial Japanese Army that were sent to
his family, a couple of tiny notebooks where he tried to keep a daily
record of his existence, messages from the Red Cross and a handful of
grainy black-and-white photographs.
He had applied for a posting at the age of 21 and was sent to
Singapore with the Malay Command Signals. It was November 1941. Three
months later, Singapore was overrun.
''We knew the Japanese were coming so four of us decided we would get
a boat and stock it with food and clothes and we put it under the pier
in Singapore harbour. Then I got sent to try to create some havoc and
blow up some stuff before the Japanese arrived. Well, the Japanese were
already there and we set off a couple of wee explosions -- nothing fancy
-- then we made our way down to the beach to get the boat, and it was
gone.''
The troops who had not managed to flee were then rounded up and forced
to form a ''welcoming line'' for the enemy. ''That was a terrible
experience. We were standing there to watch the Japanese conquerors
coming in.''
June 26th, 1943: Still in pain but managed to get some sleep for a
couple of hours. Private Wood wasting away with bleeding ulcers.
Bob was sent with hundreds of other POWs to the Changi detention
centre in Singapore where they were starved and abused for four months.
Then they were put on a cattle truck and sent up to the Thai border
where they were force-marched for days to reach the site where they
would be working on the railway.
''We were very weak and if you collapsed on the way you got beaten to
your feet. We were the first lot to go on to the railway. Whether you
were fit or not it didn't matter, you had to go out. There was cholera
everywhere. The next camp lost hundreds of men to cholera.''
''We were regularly beaten. You were beaten if you didn't bow properly
for a start. They had their pits as well for misdemeanours. If you
committed one you were put down there for many days. I had some friends
from Denniston who escaped from a prison camp in Thailand. They were
caught and executed.''
July 9th, 1943: Corporal McWhirter reports that the Nips shot the
first cholera case to try to stop the spread. Thomson has died.
Eventually, the railway was completed, and, despite the horrors they
had endured, Bob said the final connection ceremony brought a fleeting
moment of pleasure.
''After all the misery on the railway the Japanese had brought a
silver band for the joining of the two railway sections. We had not
heard music for 18 months and to hear it was so wonderful.''
It was to be a brief respite. Along with his fellow POWs Bob was taken
to the coast and put on a ship bound for Japan.
''The ship had been built on the Clyde and had been renamed the Osaka
Maru. We were kept in the hold there for nearly a month, just sitting in
the harbour. We weren't allowed out. There were hundreds of us in the
hold. People had diarrhoea and sickness. You could hardly breathe. It
was just dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.
''When we set sail we hit a typhoon, our ship got a terrible tanking
and we were grounded on the island of Formosa. We were taken off the
island by a Japanese destroyer. I was very ill and very weak and I fell
off. One of the Japanese soldiers boathooked my jacket and pulled me on
board. After that I don't know what happened.''
September 1st, 1943: Yes, yesterday was the last day of August. Very
memorable for Bill and I. We got bashed about for a tin of Nip fish that
we didn't know anything about. That, however, is only another score to
settle.
In Japan, Bob was put to work in a carbide factory and was then taken
to Osaka where he was sent to a shipyard to work on destroyers for the
Japanese Navy -- ''that was heart-breaking'' -- and was then caught up
in an earthquake.,
He was moved on to a coal yard. By now his weight had dropped to six
stones. The prisoners were living in a railway siding at the time and it
was here that he first heard the news that the war was over, and then
watched the first American troops make their way into the city. ''I
think elation was the word when we saw them. No, that doesn't explain it
properly. Just emotion. Pure emotion.''
August 15th, 1945, Wednesday: This long-awaited day has arrived. I was
asleep just having done another night shift and was wakened by Barney
and Jeff. Yes it had happened. Japan had given up the fight. I can only
hope that the wrongs done to the POWs will be atoned in full.
Sitting in his lounge, with the sunlight streaming in, and his fingers
flicking through his memories, he says now he has no bitterness for his
former captors.
''The Japanese guards were kept very much under the heel of their
officers. They just had to do what they were told. They were like
everybody else. You had the good and the bad and we did seem to suffer
mostly from the bad, but there were some who had compassion.''
When pressed, he admits the least that could be offered is an apology,
but he refuses to hold on to the anger as he has held on to the
notebooks and pictures.

Gavin Bell looks at the campaign by one British war veteran to make
friends with former enemies
RODERICK ROSS is an unlikely kamikaze pilot. For a start, he is
Scottish -- and he is a doctor. He is, however, an honorary member of
Unabarakai, an association of former Japanese naval pilots who were
trained for kamikaze missions before their country's surrender deprived
them of glorious deaths. The honour was conferred on Dr Ross last year
by Takeshi Maeda, president of the association, in recognition of his
distinguished military service (with the SAS in Malaya) and of his
efforts to improve relations between Britain and Japan since the Second
World War.
Having narrowly survived brushes with Japanese soldiers during the
war, Dr Ross believes it is time for reconciliation between erstwhile
enemies. To this end, he sought permission from commemoration organisers
in London to invite six members of Unabarakai to a VJ Day church service
in Edinburgh, followed by a military parade on the castle esplanade.
The reply from Whitehall was not encouraging. Dr Ross was informed
that the essentially (British) national and Commonwealth character of VJ
Day events precluded the involvement of groups such as the Japanese
association. His friends in Japan were understanding.
Dr Ross appreciates the hostility of veterans towards Japanese
soldiers who inflicted physical and mental torture on their prisoners,
but insists it is time to put aside enduring bitterness on both sides.
''The hatred of some of our chaps who were taken prisoner in the Far
East is very natural. But the Japanese look on our carpet bombing of
their cities as grim also. Japan was pretty well flattened into
submission even before Hiroshima.
''I don't believe that harbouring resentment of acts committed half a
century ago serves any useful purpose. Our countries are peopled by new
generations who should be striving to live and work together in peace,
rather than nurturing bitterness over past cruelties.''
Dr Ross is thus in a curious and controversial position for a man who
volunteered for the Royal Army Medical Corps shortly after graduating in
1944, because he was ''a bit of a patriot''. He was attached to the 19th
Indian Division, which had just captured Mandalay and was pushing
Japanese forces into the Shan hills of Burma.
In 1945, he was dropped into Malaya as part of a five-man SAS team
ordered to make contact with POWs and Chinese communist guerrillas, and
to help coordinate a seaborne landing a few months later. For a month
they evaded capture, although sometimes Japanese soldiers searching for
them came so close they could be heard calling: ''Are you there, Mr
Englishman?''
''They were not to know I was Scots, of course,'' Dr Ross says. ''But
it could only have been a matter of time before they got us. If their
government hadn't surrendered, we would never have got out of there.''
When the fighting was over, Dr Ross was attached to a war crimes
investigation unit. It was in this capacity in 1945 that he exhumed the
bodies of 10 Australian prisoners who had been killed in Singapore, and
accepted the Japanese explanation that they had been ''executed with
honour''.
''The major who wielded the sword told me that the Australians
concerned were regarded as brave fighting men. Since the Japanese regard
death more honourable than capture, they were executed with full
military honours. It is hard for us to understand, let alone condone,
but in the Japanese view it was a kind of tribute to their bravery.''
This view brought Dr Ross into conflict with Australian authorities
who refused to accept the Japanese explanation. As a result, he declined
an invitation to attend a memorial ceremony to the 10 Australians in
Singapore in 1993.
He was then invited by the Japanese ambassador to India to attend the
unveiling of another memorial last year -- to the war dead of both sides
at Imphal on the Indo-Burmese border, where the Japanese lost 55,000 men
in an attempt to reach India. Dr Ross, an accomplished bagpiper, added
to the pathos of the occasion by playing The Children's Lament. It was
after this contribution to reconciliation that he was declared an
honorary member of Unabarakai.
''I regard the Japanese as most peculiar people,'' Dr Ross says. ''But
I think we ought to at least come to terms with their outlook on life.
We have to learn to live with them, rather than shut the door on them.''
Dr Ross's sentiments are based partly on concern that Japan, if it
feels isolated from the West, might develop nuclear weapons to counter
perceived threats from China and North Korea. Given Japan's aggressive
behaviour in the 1940s, it is not a prospect he relishes.
''Our countries are peopled by new generations who should be striving
to live and work together in peace, rather than nurturing bitterness
over past cruelties.''

Fifty years after victory over Japan, John Linklater writes, many
survivors and countries still find difficulty in coming to terms with
the concept
VICTORY over Japan? Even 50 years later there are parts of the
English-speaking world which have difficulty with that phrase, and with
that concept. In Australia and New Zealand, which played major parts in
the war and suffered, they are celebrating the anniversary as VP Day.
Victory in the Pacific reflects the irony of a defeated enemy becoming a
major trading partner the ''victors'' cannot afford to offend.
Elsewhere there are veterans and families of veterans, in Britain and
America, who cannot dignify the name of the former adversary with
anything other than Victory over the Devil. Japanese diplomatic pressure
has discovered that it is up against a continuing shudder of undefinable
repugnance among many for whom even victory is inadequate to consider
reconciliation. Particularly in the face of apparent intransigence on
the part of the Japanese who will not apologise unequivocally for its
former aggression.
It was a victory which brought a conclusion to the Second World War,
yet it remains curiously unassimilated. Hiroshima and Nagasaki created a
moral ambiguity in which the justice of the allied cause against
aggression and atrocity might have compromised itself. It was not
glorious or heroic, just final yet unresolved.
The ironies are compound. The Japanese people had never before heard
the voice of their emperor when he broadcast the first news of the
defeat. Hirohito was supposed to be a living god as propounded in the
myths of State Shinto; it was supposedly a ''holy'' war being fought in
his name, and now he asked his people to ''endure the unendurable''.
Clement Atlee, decidedly mortal even in the post-election honeymoon as
the new British Prime Minister, told a curiously small listening
audience receptive to his message to the nation on the wireless at
midnight on August 14, 1945, that ''the last of our enemies is laid
low''. The last, that was, except for an austerity which would bind
bankrupted Britain for the next 15 years.
President Truman announced victory from the portico of the White
House, but mentioned it in the same breath as America's most cataclysmic
defeat of the entire war: ''This is the day we have been waiting for
since Pearl Harbor.'' Revenge, pure and unadorned.
And where were the architects of this victory? Roosevelt had died.
Churchill had been dismissed from power by the British electorate. As if
to emphasise the point for history, the allies decided that Hirohito
should remain as emperor, a residual authority to assist democratic
reform policies of the occupation.
As head of state, he had been at the very least technically
responsible for Japan's formal decision to start hostilities at the
Imperial Conference on December 1, 1941, six days before Pearl Harbor.
It was he who had exhorted his troops, parading before them as a divine
inspiration on a white horse. Until his death in 1989, ending the
longest imperial reign in Japanese history, he was never required to
justify his role in the war, and presided over the emergence of one of
the great economic forces in the late-twentieth-century world.
If Hirohito was no war criminal, in a war that had witnessed the
unspeakable bestialities of Nanking, the rape and enforced prostitution
of ''comfort women'', horrifying medical experimentation on countless
victims, and the enslavement, systematic starvation, torture and brutal
murder of hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war, then what meaning
could there be in the concept of a war crime?
A further inversion: the victors have had to answer later generations'
charges of alleged war crimes. History has challenged the necessity for
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, impeaching Churchill and Roosevelt as
accessories and Truman as the President who took the final decision.
This was not all. The thesis that Churchill and Roosevelt knew of the
impending attack on Pearl Harbor has continuing currency, and has never
been entirely dismissed. The speculation is encouraged by a peculiar
lack of military intelligence passed on to the US Pacific Fleet base,
and an inexplicable silence from Washington, on the eve of the Japanese
pre-emptive strike.
It is possible to construct more retrospective motives than evidence.
Churchill was desperate to bring an ally into the war. Roosevelt wanted
the same end, but needed a national trauma to galvanise American will to
action.
Neither have post-war inquiries stopped there. The reputation of
several leading generals, in a conflict that saw equal displays of
military incompetence, brilliance and self-aggrandisement, have been
subjected to critical scrutiny. The shame of the British surrender at
Singapore and the ignominious American withdrawal from the Philippines
continues to haunt long after the victory.
Even General Douglas MacArthur's words, ''I shall return'', fulfilled
as events would prove, have been subjected to revisionist
interpretation. The American Office of War Information liked the phrase,
but wanted ''We shall return''. MacArthur refused, exposing himself to
the charge of vanity, egotism and paranoia.
In a war which tarnished its heroes, what meaning could there be in
victory?
Despite the subsequent efforts of Hollywood, it was a war which
finally consigned to the previous century all ideas of valour, and even
today names like Guadalcanal, Guam and Iwo Jimo have a mythic
co-existence alongside the successful battles that were fought, detached
from reality. How many who were not there could accurately point to them
on a map?
The dislocation must have equally affected those who fought. It was
not just that the Pacific War involved a theatre of operations bigger
than any conducted in history, but the locations were as alien as the
enemy the allies were encountering. The ''samurai devotion'' of the
Japanese fighting forces, to quote Churchill's phrase, exposed a form of
fighting to the death which meant exactly that, frighteningly
demonstrated at Okinawa. The kamikaze desperation of the enemy must have
tested allied morale more than any single military setback. Here was an
adversary it was difficult to recognise as human. What would it take to
defeat him? The panic at least explains the climate in which a nuclear
resolution was accepted as necessary.
How much more shocking, then, for those who fell prisoner to the
Japanese. Not one in a thousand would have previously encountered a
member of a nation that now embodied the worst nightmare: to the POWs
they could scarcely have done less to confirm the spectre of the
ultimate aliens, grotesque, remorseless, incomprehensible. The
calculated barbarities of the camps and death labour on the Burma
railway reflected a contemptible status for which no allied serviceman
or civilian had received physical or moral preparation.
They were despised as sub-human precisely because they were prisoners,
a fate that had only been shared by Jews, Slavs, gypsies, political
prisoners and homosexuals, each with an inherited cultural memory of
systematic oppression, in the Nazi death camps.
Victory over Japan? There was nothing hollow, but it represented more
than the conclusion of a campaign over a single enemy. It was release
from the terrible collective experience of the Second World War. The
final toll presents a horror that even stark statistics cannot mitigate.
Estimated total of dead: 60 million. Fewer than half were military. It
was less a victory than a survival. Never again could global war produce
winners or losers.

ADOPTION has a golden rule which MP John Redwood might like to see
broken -- for the good of the market, of course. It was best expressed
in 1993 by the then Health Secretary, Virginia Bottomley, who said:
''Adoption is about finding homes for children, not finding children for
couples.''
The announcement by the defeated Tory leadership challenger that young
single mothers should place their children for adoption rather than rely
on the state pushed a point developed by the Institute of Economic
Affairs.
In March this year Professor Richard Whitfield used the institute as a
platform to push the radical idea that single mothers should allow
married couples to adopt their children.
The honourable chairman of the National Family Trust said: ''Love is
often about sacrifice. Giving a child up for adoption to let them flower
may well be the best greatest love a mother can show her child.''
An IEA insider was more forthright, saying that adoption was ''the
ultimate privatisation, taking children out of care and the hands of the
state''.
Pass the parcel with a young baby for reasons of finance is a cheap
tarnish to the golden rule, a point raised by Stephanie Stone, manager
of Strathclyde region's Family Finding Centre. ''This is a very
important point,'' she said. ''The first choice for any child must be
that they are raised by their birth family. No person chooses to be
rejected or given away by their birth family.
''That is the big question that children ask adoptive parents right
through their lives. 'But why was I given away?' It would be terrible if
someone said that the Government had to do that. Your mother really
wanted to keep you but she wasn't allowed to. That would be awful.''
A number of mental health problems can follow a mother who feels she
was forced to give up her child. ''We know that these women have
enormous mental and physical health problems and so they are a burden on
the state in other ways.
''The tendency is that a woman who is forced to put her child up for
adoption will become pregnant again to try to replace that lost child.''
In Britain adoption has rapidly decreased over the past 25 years. The
rise in the number of abortions combined with the fall in social stigma
attached to single mothers has meant adoptions have fallen from 27,000
in 1968 to 8000 in 1992.
In Scotland applications for adoption decreased by 27% from 1081 in
1983 to 786 in 1992. However, the number of parents wishing to adopt a
baby aged up to two has consistently outweighed the supply. In
Strathclyde during 1992 the ratio was five to one, with 300 suitable
parents for 60 children. Strathclyde region placed 35 children with
adopting parents in 1994. In 1993, the figure was 70.
Drug abuse, alcohol abuse, mental illness and serious learning
difficulties often lie behind the decision to put a child up for
adoption or for a child to be removed against the wishes of the birth
mother. Yet though adoption may be the answer to a childless couple's
prayers, it carries a tremendous burden of responsibility.
First there is the extensive application process. In Strathclyde
couples must be over 21, be married two years with the younger partner
no older than 40. They must be childless or have only one child.
Infertility investigations must be completed before the application
commences.
They must accept that they are unlikely to have children, be prepared
to meet the birth mother and accept the legal complexities of a possible
contested placement.
''They have to be able to offer us the resources that we need. By that
I mean they have to be prepared to take children with disabilities,
health problems and the risk of special schools,'' said Stone.
A burst appendix when she was 18-months prevented Marie Tierney from
having children, a point not discovered until five years into her
marriage to husband John. After five unsuccessful years with St
Margaret's Adoption Society they adopted two little girls Louise, three,
and Catherine, not yet one, through the region's Family Finding Centre.
Tierney said: ''It's quite a selfish thing to want to adopt a child.
People look at us and think there is a wee bit of Mother Teresa . . .
These children have been the most wonderful things that have ever
happened to us.
''But the rights of the child are first. There is no judgment of
Solomon. There is no dividing a child down the middle. It has to be what
is best for them all the time and I think adoptive parents are aware of
that,'' said Tierney.

DULL-EYED and feckless, with one hand reaching for the housing benefit
and the other pushing the pram -- John Redwood's latest vision of the
single mother has reinforced the stereotype of the lone parent as a
young, irresponsible, and undeserving drain on public resources.
It's an image which has been painted again and again in recent years,
but one which, according to campaigners and single parents themselves,
is so far off the mark that it is almost laughable.
Few were laughing yesterday, however, at Redwood's new suggestion that
pregnant teenagers should consider adoption if they can't get an
adequate support system in place, and his repeated argument that the
state should be their last resort.
''This seems to be the Conservative Party's favourite pastime -- to
throw things at lone parents,'' says John Findlay, director of One Plus,
the single parent support group. ''Redwood suggests that almost the
entire social security budget went on young lone parents, but that's
complete misinformation. It's a basic tactic of misinformation to create
a kind of scapegoat for many of the ills in our society.''
Roughly one in five families in Scotland are single parent families,
although that figure increases to around one in four in Strathclyde and
one in three in Glasgow. The most recent official figures put the number
of single parents at almost 91,000, but activists believe there are
about 130,000. The vast majority -- nine out of 10 -- are women. Teenage
single mothers make up between 3% and 4% of the total.
More than 75% of lone parents in Scotland receive income support, and
young lone mothers are estimated to get access to 2.5% of all local
authority lettings. The majority of lone parents -- 53% -- are separated
or divorced and the rest are single (32%), widowed (6%) or male (9%). A
single mother under the age of 18 will get a total of #59.40 per week in
income support and child benefit.
In Highland Region, where the teenage pregnancy rate was above the
Scottish average in the early 1990s -- 81.1 per thousand teenagers,
compared to 72 in Scotland -- the Inverness Crisis Pregnancy Centre has
helped young women decide the best course of action.
Spokeswoman Catherine MacInnes says that few choose adoption. ''That's
one thing we have found, that when girls do decide to carry on with a
pregnancy they don't want them adopted. We have had girls who have said
yes, they wanted the baby adopted but when they see the baby they don't
want to go through with it. I can fully understand that.''
The organisation One Parent Families has looked more closely at the
myth of the teenage mother in Scotland in a study to be released this
month. It discovered that there are fewer births to teenage mothers now
than in the mid-70s, although the figure has been rising somewhat in
recent years. In 1993, teenage births represented only 7% of total
births and young women aged under 20 made up only 3% of the lone parents
in Scotland.
One Parent Families says it has also discredited another myth that
teenage mothers are promiscuous and are having their babies outside
steady relationships. It says 75% of teenage mothers register the birth
jointly with the baby's father and the great majority are cohabiting.
Speaking yesterday, One Parent Families director Sue Robertson said
people were often selective in the information they drew from studies
and reports into the issue. For example, a recent study into child
development found that by their early thirties, 95% of teenage mothers
were living in a partnership. These figures were ignored in favour of
accompanying statistics which suggested that disadvantaged youngsters
were more likely to become teenage mums.
''What's being implied today is that single mothers have different
value systems from other groups in the population, and there is no
evidence whatsoever of that,'' says Robertson. ''The evidence is to the
contrary that lone parents are very similar to all other families in
that they would like to be employed and support themselves and their
children but they find it very difficult to do so.''
Joanne Easton, 20, from Douglas, falls neatly into the category of
single mothers whom John Redwood attacked so publicly. She fell pregnant
when she was 15, had her daughter at 16, and will marry Danielle's
father next month.
''It really is outrageous. He has got everbody down as just wanting
money and just wanting to jump the housing queue. It's just not how it
is in real life,'' she says.
''If I had given Danielle up for adoption where would I be now? Lost
without her. Adoption is not the best option for them. Yes, you do find
it really, really difficult. There was no money, we didn't have very
much, no rich parents to help us out. We fought really hard for what we
have got today. This is us just got the money together to get married.''
Despite her pregnancy, Easton stayed at school and did well in her
exams. Less than two years after Danielle was born she started working
continuous night shift at a motorway service station to make ends meet.
''You wonder how on earth anybody even gets a bath in the day, it's
just so hard, but I would sell the shoes off my feet for my daughter, to
make sure that she has everything she needs. I'm just so angry at what
has been said this time. He really has condemned everybody to the same
state and it's just not true.''
John Findlay says single parents in Scotland and elsewhere did not
need another slap in the face from a politician. What they need are
opportunities. ''If you take the vast majority of lone parents they say
they want to escape, they want to improve their family's standard of
living. They need access to childcare which allows them access to
training and education which allows them to get jobs which pay enough
for childcare. That would be a much better outcome than scapegoating and
marginalising this particular group.''
Angie Steven from Edinburgh couldn't agree more. According to the
statistics, she is a more ''typical'' single mother. She is 27 and had
her son Matthew when she was in her early twenties. She struggled on #70
worth of benefits for a number of years before securing a job.
''Don't people like Redwood know that it's a struggle every single
day? But having my son adopted never crossed my mind. It's ludicrous to
say that single mothers get to the top of the housing list, it does not
happen and the benefit system is just crazy. How are you expected to
cope on #70 a week?
''The majority of people don't choose to be single parents. I didn't
choose to be a single parent, it just happened. To say that single
parents should get a job or give their children up for adoption, where
are the jobs? There are people leaving university with hundreds of
qualifications and they are stuck in the unemployment line,'' Steven
said says.
''Money is always tight but I'm one of the lucky ones. I have got a
good wage and I'm trying to better myself and better my son. I would
really like them to live a week in my shoes and still pay their bills
and feed and clothe their children. I would really like someone like
Redwood to try that.''

WHEN I discovered I was going to be a single parent I faced the
reality of my position as best I could. My dream of white-lace-finery,
fireside suppers and happy-ever-after days ended with the angry slam of
the front door. And he didn't even bother to shut the bloody garden gate
behind him. I had never felt so alone, so utterly and completely
rejected.
But once I came to terms with my situation, I realised I had been
lucky, learning the truth before my child was born, rather than
afterwards. To have put the child through the ordeal of a loveless,
disintegrating relationship would have broken my heart. I sympathise
with the mothers I see, now, and all too often, who have to cope with
the trauma of divorce or separation.
So, perhaps, after all, the harsh slam of that closing front door was
the best thing that could have happened to me -- and to my unborn child.
What, however, was I going to tell the child I was carrying when it
eventually asked me why it did not have a daddy? That daddy had died
before it was born, that daddy lived on the moon? I decided to tell the
truth. After all, if I did not, then someone else was sure to.
I prepared my speech carefully, and quietly explained what had
happened. My daughter, Jessica, listened intently, and made no comment.
She was only two weeks old at the time, so I hardly expected anything
else; but, I have to admit, I felt a whole lot better.
From then on, I pictured myself in the same situation, explaining,
when Jessica was older. But I did not expect to find myself doing so in
the middle of Safeway's during our weekly shopping expedition. Jessica
asked me, in a loud voice, ''Where's Daddy?'' Tricky. I said that we
would talk about it when we got home and pacified her with a tub of
ice-cream.
Back in our flat, I made the Royal Cup of Tea, and sat down beside my
two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Crunch time. I went through the story.
Her daddy did not want to live with us. He lived faraway. But she had
Grandad Bruce, Uncle Blair, Uncle Charles, and lots of other men who
loved her like a daddy would: Bill, Fergus, Gary, Douglas, the telephone
engineer . . .
In my heart of hearts, I knew it was not going to work. Jessica is a
highly intelligent, perceptive, determined little lady. No matter how
much I repeated the story, Jessica kept looking at me, accusingly,
repeating, ''Where's Daddy?'' She just would not accept the fact that
she did not have a daddy, and we both got very upset. Eventually,
Jessica dropped the subject and went through to the kitchen to raid the
biscuit box.
The matter has not been mentioned again, yet. But I see the question
in her eyes and every time we meet a man, Jessica calls him daddy. It is
embarrassing. I feel people looking at me, disapprovingly, working it
out, raised eyebrows. It is easier with my family, but when she does it
to friends, or acquaintances, all I want to do is crawl under the
nearest stone and hide.
Most of the men Jessica calls daddy seem to feel sorry for her, and,
at times, I think they almost wish they were her daddy. If anyone
deserves a daddy, she surely does. But is there a daddy who deserves
Jessica?
I know one door-banger who doesn't. And, I suspect, when Jessica is
older, that she will agree. In the meantime, we will just have to do the
best we can. Time, love and a lot of talking will help. We will take it
a day at a time, step by step, together. No lies. Just hot tea -- and an
occasional resort to friendly tubs of comforting ice cream.

<TEXT>
A RAILWAY signalman told yesterday how he could do nothing but wait in
horror as two trains moved towards each other on a head-on collision
course.
Mr Steven Webb had about 15 minutes' warning of the crash, in which
five people died, at Cowden, Kent, last October, an inquest at Tunbridge
Wells was told.
However, all he could do was call out the emergency services to deal
with the accident he was expecting.
The trains drivers had no two-way radios in their cabs, and Mr Webb
did not have their mobile phone numbers, coroner Frank Warriner was
told.
However, Network SouthCentral director Graham Eccles admitted that
radios being fitted to the cabs on the line would not go into operation
until December this year.
Driver Brian Barton must have ignored four warning signals and
overridden an automatic brake as he drove his train from Uckfield,
Sussex, towards Oxted, Kent, the inquest was told.
The warnings included a red light and sirens at the trackside as well
as a yellow ''sunflower'' signal inside his cab, Railtrack director
Chris Jago said.
Mr Webb was alerted when Mr Barton's northbound train went over points
on to a single- track stretch of line about to be used by a train coming
in the opposite direction.
He said: ''When I realised that they were on a collision course, I
called up Railtrack control room in Croydon to tell them to call out the
emergency services because I believed there was going to be a collision.
''I had no means of contacting the drivers. There was nothing I could
do.''
Dr Barbara Lawton, of Solihull, a passenger, described the moment of
impact. ''I went flying through the air and landed on the side opposite
and it all went very quiet.
''I waited a few minutes before getting out of the train because I
didn't think it was a serious accident at that time. I helped and
comforted other people for about half an hour. I was surprised that the
rescue services came quite quickly.
''Earlier, the driving seemed a bit erratic and I was a bit frightened
at one point, but otherwise it was fine.''
Wayne Burton, a Network SouthCentral workman, told the inquest that
earlier that day he had seen guard Jonathan Brett-Andrews in the cabin
with driver Barton, which is against normal British Rail practice.
Both men were killed in the crash, along with two passengers and the
driver of the other train.
However, pathologist Dr Peter Jerreat told the inquest there was no
way of telling from their injuries whether Mr Brett-Andrews or Mr Barton
was in the driver's seat at the time of the crash.
The deaths of all five victims would have been instantaneous or very
rapid, Dr Jerreat said.
The accident happened in patchy fog, with visibility down in some
areas to 50 yards, early in the morning of October 15.
Apart from Mr Barton, 31, of East Croydon, and Mr Brett-Andrews, 36,
of Caterham, Surrey, the victims were freelance translator Raymond
Pointer, 61, and his wife Maura, 56, both of Crowborough, Sussex, and
the driver of the other train, Mr David Rees, 49, of Shirley, London.
The southbound train completely destroyed the first five-and-a-half
metres of the northbound train, ripping off the driver's cab and roof,
the inquest was told.
Mr Eccles said: ''I have been a railway operator for 33 years and I
have never seen that extent of damage.''
The inquest continues.

VETERAN chat show host Michael Parkinson is returning to the BBC as
presenter of television's relaunched Going For A Song.
The classic antiques quiz marks his first new BBC series for more than
20 years.
The interviewer will be joined by actress Leslie Ash and comic Tony
Slattery, who will captain Have I Got News For You style teams for the
nine-show pilot series.
They and their guests will have to identify and value mysterious
items.
''I expect the contest will be fierce, as Tony and Leslie are known to
have frequented London's Portobello Road antiques market,'' Michael
Parkinson said yesterday.
The Antiques Roadshow's Eric Knowles will take on the role of resident
expert -- originally filled by the late Arthur Negus.
Going For A Song was one of television's most successful game shows,
running for 12 years until 1977.
The new series begins at 12.20pm each weekday on Tuesday, August 29.
Later, Parkinson confessed: ''I know next to nothing about antiques
but it doesn't matter -- I'm just a presenter.''
Slattery and Ash were enthusiasts by comparison, he said.
Slattery said: ''I think it's going to have a less reverential
approach than the original, which is not the same as taking the mickey.
''I am sure we will still get the turn of the century paintings but
probably also some hideous Bakelite objects from the Fifties, the sort
of thing anyone might have.''

<HEADLINE>Lanark Blue saga returns to court amid claims council wants to stop this year's produce. Cheese listeria '5000 times too high'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>976879726</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SAMPLE of suspect Lanark Blue cheese had a listeria level 5000 times
more than health guidelines allow, a court was told yesterday.
However, despite the amount of listeria monocytogenes found in the
soft cheese last December, there were no reported cases of anyone
becoming ill after eating the product.
Those were the two main pieces of conflicting evidence when the Lanark
Blue saga returned to court for the sixth time this year.
The cheese, made from unpasteurised ewe's milk, is a favourite with
the royals, particularly Prince Charles.
This time it was the turn of Lanark Sheriff Court to hear details of
listeria levels, why Clydesdale District Council ''seized'' nearly five
tonnes of the cheese, and why the council issued an urgent health
warning about the product via the Scottish Office.
Even before the hearing got under way, cheesemaker Humphrey Errington,
50, claimed Clydesdale tried to ''detain'' 20 tonnes of this year's
produce, worth #60,000.
Sheriff John Douglas Allan heard an application from Clydesdale's QC,
Mr Neil Brailsford, for an order to destroy the cheese -- now deep
frozen at Mr Errington's farm factory at Walston, Braehead, near
Dunsyre, Lanarkshire.
The application was made under the 1990 Food Safety Act. An order to
destroy the cheese was granted after a hearing in camera in February but
overturned in a judicial review in the Court of Session.
The council wants to destroy 44 batches of the cheese -- worth #27,000
-- because, it says, it is unfit for human consumption.
Mr Robert Steenson, 31, the council's principal environmental health
officer, said random sampling in Edinburgh last December, alerted him to
the listeria problem.
Mr Errington was contacted immediately and he agreed to recall the
product and keep it on his farm.
Mr Steenson said he and Mr Errington and his lawyers agreed that the
Scottish Agricultural College, in Ayrshire, should carry out tests on 50
batches.
Those tests, said Mr Steenson, revealed varying levels of listeria.
He said Mr Errington had agreed in a letter that any cheese found with
listeria would not go on sale.
The hearing, which could last until the end of the week, was told that
Mr Errington later objected to this and the council agreed that those
batches with a level of listeria lower than 1000 organisms per gramme
would be released.
Mr Steenson revealed that six samples were below the 1000 marker but
44 others had greater levels of listeria, the highest being 5,100,000
organisms per gramme.
Mr Steenson said he consulted Dr James McLauchlin, of the Public
Health Laboratory Services, in London, and Dr Syed Ahmed, Lanarkshire
Health Board's public health consultant.
He said: ''They agreed that the levels of listeria monocytogenes were
unacceptable. Dr McLauchlin explained to me that the listeria levels
were capable of causing illness in humans.''
Mr Steenson said he believed the cheese was unfit to eat and should be
destroyed.
Cross-examined by Mr Michael Jones, QC, Mr Steenson agreed that he had
not been aware of the laboratory services' guidelines when deciding that
any listeria-affected cheese should not be sold.
He agreed that no-one had reported becoming ill from eating last
year's batch of Lanark Blue and said he made the decision to have the
cheese destroyed taking into account an EU directive and the advice of
Dr Ahmed and Dr McLauchlin.
Earlier, the court was told the EU directive was not enforced when Mr
Steenson decided the cheese should be destroyed. That directive has not
been incorporated in the Milk and Milk Products Hygiene (Scotland)
Regulations 1995.
Last night, Clydesdale's acting chief executive, Mr Bob Russell,
dismissed Mr Errington's claims that the council tried to impose a
similar order on this year's batch of Lanark Blue.

A NEW form of transatlantic air travel will be available from Scotland
next year.
Icelandair plans to introduce a service linking Glasgow with Halifax,
Nova Scotia, stopping off at the airline's base in Reykyavik. Final
details of the service are still being worked out but it is expected to
start next spring.
The service would use smaller jet aircraft than at present serve the
North Atlantic as each of the flight sectors would be relatively short
at around four hours. At present Icelandair operates from Glasgow to
Reykyavik twice a week using a mixture of Boeing 737 and Fokker 50
aircraft.
This innovative approach should allow the airline to keep prices
relatively low and open up the popular Canadian market to a wider range
of people.
The move is good news for Glasgow Airport which has suffered the
withdrawal of two transatlantic services leaving Air Canada, British
Airways, and American Airlines to serve the North American market.

<RECORDNO>976879728</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TEAMS of ''water-spies'' have been set up to impose a hosepipe ban in
the mid-Ross-shire area.
Highland region's water authority says it will not hesitate to
prosecute persistent offenders.
More than 20,000 consumers in the Evanton, Dingwall, Maryburgh, Conon
Bridge, Muir of Ord, Marybank, Strathpeffer, Contin, and Black Isle
areas are affected but farmers and golf courses have been excluded from
the prohibition order.
It is not a water shortage which has caused the ban. Gardeners have
been leaving their hoses on overnight, reducing the pressure needed to
fill up the storage tanks in certain areas of the distribution network.
The mid-Ross area has been the worst affected, with some households
not getting water at all.
People in Caithness have also suffered and the authority has had to
drive in tanker loads of water to fill up their tanks. However no
hosepipe ban has been implemented in that area yet.
Water director Jim Johnstone said: ''My staff will be closely
monitoring the situation and anyone found using a hosepipe in
contravention of the ban will receive a letter. If they are caught for a
second time, then we will report them to the procurator-fiscal for
action.''
People will be allowed to use watering cans and motorists can still
clean their cars using a bucket and sponge.
Mr Johnstone said emergency measures to ensure a continuation of
supply for as many consumers as possible was stretching his budget.
''The money to pay for staff overtime hours and the extraordinary cost
of tank-loads of water will have to be found from somewhere and,
inevitably, the consumer will have to carry the can in some respect.''

<HEADLINE>Mayhew and Adams prepare for peace talks</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976879729</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SIR Patrick Mayhew is expected to have new talks with Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams within the next fortnight as part of fresh
Government moves to develop the peace process.
The Northern Ireland Secretary is due back from holiday next week but,
meantime, it was understood arrangements were being made to bring the
two sides together again before the first anniversary of the IRA
ceasefire at the end of the month.
Republican assurances yesterday that the process was not under the
threat of a return to violence after Mr Adams' off-the-cuff remark that
the IRA had ''not gone away'' failed to calm some Unionist fears but
they appear to have satisfied the Government even though Junior Minister
Baroness Denton described them as ''unhelpful''.
Sir Patrick and Mr Adams have met three times as part of exploratory
dialogue.
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland Political Development
Minister, was due back at Stormont today after his summer holiday and
may seek a new round of bilateral meetings but there is increasing
nationalist pressure to move straight into all-party negotiations in
advance of any final agreement on IRA disarmament.
SDLP leader John Hume has urged Mr Major to set a date next month and
yesterday Mr Adams claimed discussions involving all the parties would
be a minimum requirement by the British but one which could stabilise
the peace process.
The Sinn Fein president said his remark about the IRA was not meant to
be a threat. The process had to be moved forward because no-one in
republican and nationalist Ireland thought the British were serious
about it.
He added: ''There has to be a peace settlement. There has to be an
inclusive negotiating process without preconditions. Will we get it
under this Government? I don't know but we will get it eventually. This
is the best opportunity for peace for 25 years.''
Mr Nigel Dodds, of the Democratic Unionist Party, said Gerry Adams had
allowed his mask to slip.
He claimed: ''Gerry Adams promised a summer of marching feet and angry
voices and it's clear Sinn Fein is determined that unless concessions
are made, there will be a return to violence sooner or later.''
Meanwhile, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Dick Spring, who was also on
holiday, asked for a full report of the weekend violence in Belfast and
Londonderry.
Senior officials of the SDLP accused the police of using ''excessive
force'' during the Belfast clashes.

<RECORDNO>976879730</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CANNABIS resin with a wholesale value of more than #38,500 was found
inside Canadian lager tins during a police raid on a Glasgow home, a
court was told yesterday.
Philip Reid, 27, was jailed for eight years after admitting
involvement in the supply of the drug from his home at Govan Road,
Govan, between August 16 and August 19 last year.
His wife Lorraine, 24, had her plea of not guilty accepted by the
Crown.
Mr James Scott, prosecuting at the High Court in Glasgow, said police
went to Reid's house on August 19 after being tipped off.
They found a polythene bag containing a number of Canadian lager cans
which ''smelled of cannabis'', Mr Scott said.
In a nylon holdall were quantities of cannabis resin wrapped in
separate bundles.
The prosecution told the court that Reid had indicated to his wife and
told police: ''This is down to me. It's nothing to do with her.''
Mr Scott said the cans had been emptied of lager and refilled with
wrapped cannabis resin and water before being resealed.
Mr Tom Welsh, defending, said Reid had agreed to take delivery of the
cans, open them, and parcel the drug.
The cannabis was to be collected by someone else and the accused was
paid #700 for his part.
Mr Welsh said Reid had not identified the source of the drug.
Jailing Reid, temporary judge John Horsburgh said it was a very
serious offence and ordered the forfeiture of the cannabis resin and
#700.
* Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday heard that a 47-year-old man
started taking cannabis to ease the pain of a medical condition, but
ended up supplying others.
Hugh Hart, of Broomhouse Place South, Edinburgh, was sentenced to 30
months' imprisonment after pleading guilty to possession and supply of
cannabis.
Sheriff Andrew Bell said Hart had admitted being in possession of
about a kilo of cannabis a week. There was also some suggestion by the
Crown, he said, that Hart was making #1250 a week from supplying the
drug.
Appearing for Hart, Mr Alistair Duff said his client had been handling
''reasonably substantial quantities of the drug'' which he would sell to
friends.
''He is adamant he didn't make any great amount of money,'' Mr Duff
said. ''Any money he did make was simply recycled in the next
purchase.''
The Crown had found no evidence of substantial savings or an expensive
lifestyle, he added.

<TEXT>
THE cast of the Gaelic soap, Machair, are set to reject a #1000 offer
of compensation after the scrapping of filming until next year.
The 18 main stars are demanding about #6000 each because they were
given autumn production dates by the makers, Scottish Television, and
had turned down other lucrative work because of it.
But at a meeting in Glasgow with the actors' union, Equity, the cast
members were told that Scottish Television and Comataidh Telebhisein
Gaidhlig -- the Gaelic TV Committee -- had come up with only a #1000
deal, and they will have to work extra to get it.
The conditions for the deal are that the actors work on a special
one-off programme, in which they tell of their experiences making the
Gaelic soap.
Machair, which is shown throughout Scotland in the Scottish and
Grampian TV regions, is fully funded. Scottish Television gets a little
more than #2m a year, channelled through the CTG, to make it.
One actor said: ''I'll go along with whatever the majority decide. But
I think we're going to reject this as an insult.''
Depending on the views of its members, who are being balloted, Equity
may back a call for the actors to strike.
The autumn shoot was cancelled because CTG claimed it could not afford
it after the building of a #750,000 all-weather studio on Lewis.

POLICE launched a murder inquiry yesterday after forensic tests on
bones, found in bogland near Port Glasgow, indicated that they were
probably the remains of armed robber Michael Doherty.
Officers declined to comment on how the victim had met his death but
they described it as ''a particularly brutal killing''. Among the many
theories they are investigating is that he may have been executed by
drug barons.
Forensic experts have been scouring the scene since Monday last week,
when the skeletal remains of a human hand were discovered by a man
walking his dog by the side of the A761 Port Glasgow to Kilmacolm road.
Police cordoned off the area, near Craigmalloch Woods, about one mile
from Port Glasgow, and the search resulted in further remains being
discovered last Friday.
Yesterday morning, Strathclyde Police revealed that blood samples had
been taken from immediate relatives of missing person Mr Doherty, for
the purpose of making DNA comparisons with the remains.
Later in the day, police said that forensic tests also indicated that
the remains were ''most probably'' those of Mr Doherty.
Mr Doherty, 36, of Westray Avenue, Port Glasgow, was last seen in his
hometown on June 9. Two months earlier, he had been released from a
six-year jail sentence for armed robbery.
Last night, a police spokesman said: ''Further tests will have to be
carried out before the identity can be confirmed but it is most probably
him. We are appealing for information from anybody regarding Mr
Doherty's whereabouts since he was last seen on June 9 and for any
information about what really is a particularly brutal killing.''
He refused to comment on the cause of death or to reveal which parts
of the victim's body had been recovered, although he did reveal that
those remains which had been recovered had been found close together.
However, officers and dogs are continuing to search the area, so it
would appear some parts have still to be found.
The spokesman added that the boggy nature of the terrain was making
the search difficult.
There could be ''any one of a number'' of motives for the killing, he
said. Asked about speculation that the murder may be linked to the drugs
underworld, he said: ''That is one of many possibilities. We are keeping
an open mind.''
Mr Doherty was due to get married two weeks after he went missing, to
Angela Doherty, 30. The couple have a six-year-old son, and Mr Doherty
has three children from a previous marriage.
Ms Doherty said: ''I am really worried by it all and scared to think
the worst.''
Mr Doherty's parents, Jean, 66, and Michael, 69, have already provided
the police with blood samples for DNA testing.
The apparent victim's brother John, said the family had recently been
under a lot of stress, with this latest revelation coming as practically
the last straw.
Detective Chief Inspector John Sherry, leading the investigation, last
night appealed to anyone with any information to contact the incident
room at Greenock police station.

A POLICEMAN'S son yesterday admitted plotting to commit armed
robberies.
Steven Anderson, 17, dreamed of a life as an armed outlaw on the run
after his parents' marriage broke up and he was sent to a children's
home, Stirling Sheriff Court was told.
Anderson, of Hareburn Road, Tillicoultry, pled guilty to plotting with
Alan Wyles, a fellow resident at Tullibody Children's Home, to commit
armed robberies.
His father, a constable with the Lothian and Borders force, remarried
and his mother sank deep into alcoholism, the court was told.
Defence agent Jim Savage said Andersondid not get on with his
step-mother.
''There was a lot of tension and this resulted in him being
rejected,'' said Mr Savage.
Anderson spent a period in foster care before being moved to the
children's home and becoming friends with Wyles, who was no stranger to
the criminal justice system, said Mr Savage.
Last year, after leaving the children's home at 16, Anderson went to
live with Wyles, also then 16, at Wyles' home in Douglas Street,
Stirling, said Mr Savage.
There, in May 94, they hatched and executed a plot to steal a car and
break into a house at Blair Drummond, Perthshire, and steal two
shotguns.
The court was told that Anderson acted as lookout while Wyles carried
out the break-in, hacking through a lavatory wall and taking the guns
from a locked cabinet in a bedroom at the house in Woodside Cottages.
Mr Savage said Wyles knew the son of the householder and was aware the
guns were there.
Then they abandoned the car, took the guns back to Wyles's home, and
sawed off the barrels.
In addition to the conspiracy, Anderson pled guilty to taking part in
stealing the car, stealing the shotguns and a quantity of cartridges,
and illegally shortening the barrels.
He later told police he and Wyles had intended to run away together,
surviving ''by holding up shops and that''.
Anderson was arrested before Wyles and a third youth launched an
attempted armed robbery on a newsagents in Raploch, Stirling. Wyles was
jailed for five years at the High Court in Edinburgh in February.
Mr Savage said: ''It seems almost Walter Mitty-ish the way he became
involved in the course of conduct to which he now pleads guilty.''
He said Anderson had gone on the run after failing to appear at a High
Court hearing and had since found some stability, meeting a girl, moving
in to live with her and her parents in Tillicoultry, and working as a
cleaner in Longannet Power Station.
Sheriff Robert Younger deferred sentence for reports until next month.
However, he added: ''The offences are very serious and the
circumstances would have to be most unusual before I could legitimately
avoid putting you into custody.''
Anderson's mother, Mrs Jane Anderson, said at home in Tillicoultry
yesterday: ''He's a good kid really, he just did a lot of daft things
when he came out of the children's home. I think he was led astray. He
doesn't deserve the jail.''
His father was not available for comment.

AN IRAQI opposition party said yesterday that 10 high-ranking Iraqi
officers, including two generals, have been arrested in a purge
following the defection to Jordan of two sons-in-law of President Saddam
Hussein.
Scores of lower-ranking officers were arrested too, said Dr Hamid
al-Bayati, London representative of the Supreme Council for Islamic
Resistance in Iraq (Sciri).
He said the arrests were part of a purge of potential supporters of
Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel Hassan, one of the relatives of Saddam
who defected last week.
''Saddam is trying to arrest anyone who might be a follower or
supporter of Hussein Kamel, because Hussein Kamel asked the army to move
against Saddam. So whoever might respond to this request will be
arrested and even executed,'' Dr Bayati said.
He said that all those arrested came from the Takrit area, the home of
Saddam and his defector sons-in-law.
He named the two arrested generals as Khazal Ibrahim Hassan al-Takriti
and Abdul-Menem Abdul-Aziz Juma'a, and said four brigadiers, two staff
colonels, and two lieutenant-colonels were among those arrested.
The Iranian-backed Sciri is a Shi'ite Muslim organisation. It is based
in Tehran, but, like most exiled Iraqi opposition groups, also maintains
a presence in London.
* Britain's Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames said yesterday that
the defections were a grave blow to the Iraqi ruler.
Mr Soames, on a Middle East tour originally focused on the war in
former Yugoslavia, said King Hussein had briefed him on developments
since the defections to Jordan.
''Apparently, it is a very serious and defining moment for the Iraqi
leadership,'' Mr Soames said. ''We want to see peace and good order
restored to this part of the world, and I have no doubt that what has
happened will gravely damage the Iraqi leadership.''.
Mr Soames was accompanied by Air Chief Marshal Sir William Wrattan,
who commanded British air forces in the 1991 Gulf War with Iraq and who
has been director general of the Saudi Armed Forces Project since 1992.
Jordan's King Hussein yesterday launched a fierce attack on Saddam and
said it was ''the right time for change'' in the Baghdad leadership.
''If a change occurs it will only be a change for the better,'' the
king told an Israeli newspaper.

THE Government yesterday said there would be no inquiry into the death
of a teenager from an illness some believe to be linked with BSE, the
so-called mad cow disease.
Mr Stephen Churchill, 19, from Devizes, Wiltshire, died from
Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (CJD) in May this year.
He was the first British teenager known to have been killed by the
rare brain disease, which normally claims elderly victims.
The disease is so rare in teenagers there have been only three other
reported cases in the world.
Mr Churchill's parents, Dave and Dorothy, have demanded a public
inquiry into their son's death and want medical experts to investigate
whether it was linked with the cattle disease BSE.
However, the Department of Health yesterday ruled out any possibility
of an inquiry. A spokesman said: ''We continue to believe there's no
evidence that BSE can cause CJD in humans.''
He pointed out that Professor Robert Will, head of the Government's
CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh, was continuing to monitor incidence
of the disease.
Ms Vicky Rimmer, 17, of Connagh's Quay, north Wales, is also suspected
to be suffering from CJD and is in a coma.
The Department of Health spokesman said CJD could be diagnosed only
from an analysis of brain tissue after death and it was impossible to
tell if a living person had the disease.
Mr Churchill's case was highlighted in Granada Television's World In
Action last night.
Professor Jeff Almond, a microbiologist at Reading University, told
the programme: ''Anything unusual in relation to CJD which makes Britain
different from the rest of the world might suggest that it's something
connected with the BSE that we have had in our cattle and in that sense
it could be worrying if this is evidence of transmission to humans.''

THE victim of a brutal assault outside a Glenrothes discotheque six
months ago can only now recognise members of his family, a court heard
yesterday.
The 20-year-old man suffered brain damage and a fractured skull after
being repeatedly punched, stamped on, kicked, and dragged along the
ground.
At the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday, his attacker, Nikolas
Sturrock, 21, was sentenced to nine years' jail.
In sentencing Sturrock, temporary judge Hazel Aronson said it had been
a horrific and vicious assault with devastating results.
The victim, Ian Dunn, can now recognise members of his family but he
has been left with severe brain damage and will probably never be able
to look after himself.
Sturrock, of Bilsland Road, Glenrothes, Fife, admitted assaulting Mr
Dunn to his severe injury, permanent impairment, and the danger of his
life on February 19.
Mr James Campbell, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh
that an argument broke out between the two men at Follies Discotheque.
The reason for the dispute was not clear.
Both went outside for a ''square-go'' and were seen taking part in a
stand-up fight by a security guard who was monitoring surveillance
cameras.
''At some point, it seems to have got completely and utterly out of
hand,'' Mr Campbell said. ''A bottle was smashed and after that Sturrock
seems to have gone berserk.''
Sturrock left Mr Dunn unconscious on the ground.
Mr Dunn was taken to Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy, then transferred to
the Western General in Edinburgh with a fractured skull and damage to
both lobes of his brain.
Mr Campbell said it appeared from the injuries that Mr Dunn's head had
been kicked and stamped on ''a substantial number of times''.
He spent two and a half weeks in intensive care and developed severe
chest infections, partly because of bruising to his lungs.
The Advocate-depute told the court it was unlikely Mr Dunn would ever
be able to look after himself again.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, said Sturrock was a man who had shunned
violence but a string of personal problems had placed him under great
stress. At the time of the incident he was like a ''pressure cooker'',
Mr Ogg said.
Sturrock had been drinking and his temper flared when Mr Dunn picked
up a bottle and threw it at him.
Jailing Sturrock for nine years, Judge Aronson said she took into
account his lack of previous convictions for violence.
She added: ''You have pleaded guilty to what was a horrific and
vicious assault involving repeatedly stamping and kicking him with the
result that he suffered devastating and life-threatening injuries.''

POLICE last night were investigating the murder of a 15-year-old girl
found strangled and battered to death near a lovers' lane.
The fully-clothed body of Louise Sellers was discovered this morning
by a retired policeman walking his dog at Wigan, Greater Manchester.
''The body was in a field and had not been concealed,'' said Inspector
Gary Jewitt at the scene tonight.
Louise, was wearing a leather jacket, vest, and jeans. Her body, which
has not been formally identified, was found near Green's Lane, a narrow
by-way popular with courting couples.
It was lying in recently-harvested wheat fields behind Billinge
Hospital.
The teenager lived five miles away in Chisacre Drive, Appley Bridge,
Lancashire. Her parents are believed to have two other children, a boy
and girl.
Detective Superintendent Peter Mockett, leading the inquiry, said:
''This was the horrific murder of a 15-year-old girl.
''We do not have a motive. We don't know how she finished up in this
locality.
''These are all matters that we will have to consider. I am appealing
for information from any member of the public, particularly anyone who
saw anything unusual overnight.''
A police search involving a helicopter was launched early yesterday
after Louise failed to return home.
She went to meet a girlfriend at 6pm on Sunday and was last seen three
hours later at a bus stop in Appley Bridge, when her friend went off
with a boy.
Detectives were trying to establish whether she caught a bus, set off
walking or accepted a lift.
Home Office pathologist Dr John Rutherford was expected to carry out a
post-mortem examination.
A group of Louise's classmates called at her home today to offer
messages of sympathy to her parents.
They described Louise as a bubbly, fun-loving girl who had lots of
friends.
She was the daughter of a musician and, according to her friends, her
main interests were music and horses.
One tearful teenager said: ''It's hard to believe that we won't see
Louise again. She was always laughing and joking and everyone liked her.
''She had friends all over the place and it would not have been
unusual for her to go over to Billinge.''

LASER technology pioneered by scientists in Edinburgh may open up a
range of hitherto unexplored commercial applications.
Blue lasers, first developed in Europe at Heriot-Watt University,
could revolutionise compact discs and information technology. They
operate on a much shorter wavelength than the more common green or red
lasers, and can store up to four times the amount of information on the
same CD.
Developing the technique at this end of the spectrum has always been
difficult. Initially, it would work only at temperatures of minus 150C
but substantial progress has been made since 1990 in finding the way to
charge semi-conductors.
''They can now work at room temperature,'' said Dr Gerald Buller, a
physics lecturer at Heriot-Watt.
The university's physics department has carried out a #3m research
project over six years into blue lasers. This week it hosting a
conference on how to take the process forward. Teams from Sony, Philips,
Sharp, and NEC and other manufacturers are among the 350 delegates.
Apart from CD and the semi-conductor applications, potential markets
also include cheaper desk-top colour printers, light-emitting displays
for military and civil use, and cheap, long-lasting lightbulbs.

LABOUR deputy leader John Prescott yesterday was forced to admit that
the reforms introduced by Mr Tony Blair have caused unease within the
party, following the latest in a series of attacks on the leadership.
Abandoning previous attempts to dismiss the criticisms as ''summer
silliness'', Mr Prescott acknowledged on BBC Radio 4's the World at One
that some in the party were ''a bit uneasy'' at the pace and direction
of the reforms.
Former Labour front bencher Bryan Gould joined in the attacks on Mr
Blair's style by warning that a Labour government would face ''massive
divisions'' among MPs and party members unless it stuck to its core
socialist beliefs.
In an article in the London Evening Standard, Mr Gould -- who left
Parliament in 1992 to take up an academic post in New Zealand -- accused
Mr Blair of ruthlessly abandoning socialist ideals and maintaining a
''Stalinist'' grip on the party.
Mr Blair and his supporters had abandoned ideology and muzzled those
MPs ''who have kept their ideals'', he said. If he were a first-time
voter at the next election, he would look elsewhere ''in choosing the
best party for Britain''.
''A party without an ideology, seeking only to please the public,
faces massive problems in office,'' he said, adding: ''Another
consequence . . . would be massive divisions among its MPs and members.
A shared ideology and vision is the only thing that can bind a party
together in office.''
Blair loyalists yesterday struggled to defuse the appearance of
growing discontent within the party, which has been seized on by the
Tories as proof that they are not the only party racked by internal
divisions.
The Labour press office released copies of previous articles by Mr
Gould, in which he criticised the party for not being decisive enough.
In 1994, he wrote: ''Labour seems to be infected by the same illness --
a difficulty in making up its mind, and a paralysing caution about doing
or saying anything that might offend anybody.''
Mr Gould was joined yesterday by Scots back bencher Dennis Canavan,
who accused Mr Blair of treating Labour voters like ''mindless
zombies''. However, Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar
dismissed the attacks as ''ludicrous''.
Mr Gould's attack follows a succession of criticisms in which Mr Blair
has been accused of ruthlessness in the pursuit of victory at the next
election and of leaving policy-making in the hands of unelected members
of his private office.
* LABOUR yesterday rejected criticisms from an independent committee
of peers who warned that its plans to reform the House of Lords would
lead to years of ''constitutional tinkering and uncertainty''.
The group, led by the Earl of Carnarvon, attacked Labour's ''piecemeal
approach'' and called for a Royal Commission to consider the party's
proposals for the immediate scrapping of the right of 755 hereditary
peers to sit in the House.
The report found there was no guarantee that change would lead to
greater efficiency. ''The worst upshot would be if reform of the House
of Lords were to lead to years of constitutional tinkering and
uncertainty, or if we were to exchange the present House for one that is
more rational but less effective,'' it said.
''There is a danger in piecemeal change which would alter the balance
and nature of the present House without first determining that whatever
replaced the existing composition would be as -- or more -- effective in
fulfilling the varied roles of the second Chamber.''
However, Labour immediately rejected the criticism. Home Affairs
spokesman Alun Michael said: ''This is a confused and muddled report,
which suggests the authors haven't understood the clarity and simplicity
of Labour's proposals to end the sitting and voting rights of hereditary
peers.''
Mr Michael criticised, in particular, the group's failure to address
what he described as the ''scandal of the backwoodsmen'', in which
hereditary peers who normally take no part in the Lords' proceedings
turn up to support the Government on unpopular measures such as the poll
tax.
However, the group, which consists of three hereditary peers, a life
baron, and a former Clerk of the Lords, warned that reform might lead to
the creation of the ''ultimate quango'' and said hereditary peers would
''vote themselves into history with barely a backward glance'' if an
acceptable alternative was put forward.

<HEADLINE>Dentists' warning on illegal dentures.  Unqualified technicians could put patients at risk.</HEADLINE>

DENTISTS have warned patients against buying dentures from an
increasing number of unqualified dental technicians who could be putting
patients' health at risk.
The British Dental Association said it wanted to see tougher fines and
the registration of technicians after being alerted to a number of
blatant advertisements in newspapers by unqualified people offering
dentures direct to the public.
The association's Ian Morely said only qualified dentists were legally
entitled to prescribe, design, take impressions of the mouth, and fit
dentures. He said if this type of work was carried out by any other
person he or she could be prosecuted by the General Dental Council,
although he acknowledged that the number of prosecutions was extremely
low.
He said it appeared that dental technicians -- who are not registered
with the association and need only a City and Guilds qualification --
were setting up direct denture services across the country, in some
cases offering low-price false teeth in competition to prices offered by
qualified private dentists.
He added that in recent months advertisements appearing in local
newspapers had been more blatant and misleading.
''While technicians are involved in the making of dentures they are
not qualified to prescribe and might miss, for example, serious
conditions such as oral cancer.''
But last night the General Dental Council revealed that while
complaints had steadily risen the number of prosecutions undertaken by
the council remained extremely low and that around half of those cases
initiated were never concluded.
In 1993 the council received 12 complaints from dentists and 11 from
patients over illegal dentistry claims. Of these 23 complaints seven
were dropped and only four prosecutions concluded in the courts. The
following year the council has records of four convictions. In only one
case compensation of just over #100 was paid to two patients.
So far this year the council said two dental technicians had been
convicted and ordered to pay fines totalling #4900.
While the council said no cases were under investigation in Scotland,
the dental association said this did not mean there were not worrying
examples of illegal dentistry being practised.
''Prosecutions require a patient coming forward and being prepared to
go to court. Anecdotal evidence we have collected appears to show that
after considerable effort the courts are awarding small fines,'' it
said.

A SCHEME in Lothian to help parents go to work while their children
are being looked after has been outstandingly successful, it was
announced yesterday.
The out-of-school childcare initiative, set up last September, had
created 771 more places for young children in clubs throughout the
region by June this year, 54% ahead of the target.
Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd and Lothian Regional Council, who
jointly launched the scheme, said yesterday it had almost doubled the
number of places available from 850 to 1600.
It had helped 800 parents to get a job or expand their work or
training, and had provided part-time employment for 114 people. The
number of clubs in Lothian had been increased from 40 to 60.
Dr Des Bonnar, chief executive of LEEL, said the initiative had been
undertaken as part of a national #45m project funded by the Department
of Employment to create 50,000 more places throughout the UK, and LEEL
had successfully bid for #449,000.
One employer to benefit was the finance company, Lloyds Bowmaker, of
Orchard Brae, Edinburgh, which was offering employees a childcare club
during the school summer holidays for the second successive year.
Its club, based at Flora Stevenson School, had catered for 33 children
this year, 10 more than last year.
Councillor Keith Geddes, leader of Lothian Regional Council, said that
the budgets of the new unitary authorities to be formed next April would
be under pressure against expenditure allowed by the Government.
He hoped that funding would be allowed to let the childcare scheme
continue, and said Lothian would raise this with Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth.

IT will be for the victims of Japanese atrocities during the Second
World War to decide whether or not to accept the apology offered by
Japan's Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, the Government said yesterday.
Downing Street sources said Mr Major was ''obviously pleased'' with
the terms of the letter, received last month, in which Mr Murayama
expressed ''remorse and apology'' for the sufferings inflicted by the
Imperial Army on civilians and prisoners of war.
However, a spokesman for Mr Major made it clear it was for veterans
and other victims to judge. ''The apology is not directed specifically
at the Prime Minister. It is really aimed at those who were affected.
They are the people who must judge whether it is satisfactory.''
Confusion has surrounded the apology since it was announced. Veterans
have complained that it was made by Mr Murayama personally, and not the
Japanese Government on behalf of the Japanese people, and that it failed
to make any offer of compensation.
On Saturday, veterans' anger was increased when Mr Murayama appeared
to deny that the letter to Mr Major, intended to congratulate him on his
victory in the Tory leadership contest, was meant as an apology.
Yesterday, the Japanese embassy issued a statement insisting the
letter was indeed an apology. ''Prime Minister Murayama's comments on 12
August in no way contradict the view which he expressed in the letter.
There is no change on the part of Prime Minister Murayama and the
Japanese Government regarding that view,'' it declared.
The Downing Street official also said the Government would ''continue
to make plain to the Japanese Government the strength of feeling in this
country about the issue of compensation''. The Japanese Government is
being sued for #14,000 in compensation for each of about 73,000 Pacific
war veterans.
Today, attention will focus on commemorations of the 50th anniversary
of the Japanese surrender, when Mr Murayama is expected to make a
long-awaited formal and public apology for Japan's war crimes.
Former prisoners of war are threatening a ''militant'' campaign
against Japan if Mr Murayama fails to deliver an apology.
Solicitor Martyn Day, who represents the Japanese Labour Camps
Survivors' Association and the Association of British Civilian Internees
Far East Region, said the direction of their campaign rested on what Mr
Murayama said today.
He added: ''There is an overwhelming feeling that until the Japanese
apologise, people can never go forward. There is a lot of anger over
what has happened in the last three days. There is a lot of resentment
that the Japanese Government cannot get it right even at this late
stage.''
Mr Arthur Titherington, 73, secretary of the survivors' association,
said: ''We will have to take a more militant approach if we do not get
our apology. We have talked about boycotting Japanese goods. We would
need John Major to stand behind us personally.''
* Sir Hector Monro, Tory MP for Dumfries, yesterday demanded an
official apology from Mr Murayama and called on the Japanese Government
to pay full compensation.
Sir Hector, a Second World War RAF veteran who helped with the
transport home from the Far East of liberated PoWs, said: ''I think
really it would be far better if the prime minister made a clean breast
and made a genuine apology on behalf of the Japanese nation.
''Step two is whether or not they will pay compensation. When you hear
the first-hand accounts of what our prisoners were subjected to, the
Japanese owe us a great deal more than the pathetic statement we got
this week.''
Sir Hector was launching an information service in St Andrew's House,
Edinburgh, to reunite veterans.
Veterans unable to call at St Andrew's House are advised to telephone
the Vetlink staff at 0131 557 9804.

* An 18-year-old youth was helping police inquiries last night into
the murder of a 15-year-old boy, who was stabbed to death outside a
nightclub.
Adam Lucas was killed outside Liberty's in Sale, Greater Manchester,
early on Saturday.
His friend Lee Cope, also 15, is seriously ill in hospital after being
stabbed in the same incident.
Last night, police disclosed that two girls they had been looking for,
known only as Sophie and Louise, both 18, had now been traced and were
being interviewed.
They befriended Adam, of Hestor Walk, Hulme, Manchester, at the
nightclub and were sitting with him outside shortly before the attack.
The stabbings came as bricks and bottles were thrown between two
groups of youths from different districts. Police have stressed that
Adam, one of eight children, was not seen to be fighting.

Banja Luka
BOSNIAN Serbs today expelled ferry-loads of Croats in what UN
officials feared was a final drive to ethnically cleanse their
stronghold around Banja Luka.
People clutching holdalls and plastic bags of belongings were the
first to be herded onto two open boats and ferried the 300 yards across
the Sava River to Croatia.
As the expulsions began, the United States launched yet another bid to
make peace, but the warring sides looked in no mood to compromise.
Diplomats said a European tour by President Clinton's National
Security Advisor Anthony Lake had found support for new peace proposals
and Washington would launch a round of shuttle diplomacy in the former
Yugoslavia.
However, on a battlefront in central Bosnia government troops were
said to have made significant gains in an offensive around the Serb-held
town of Donji Vakuf.
In Banja Luka, Serbs were rounding up Muslims and Croats and thousands
of non-Serbs were expected to be forced onto the ferries.
The UNHCR office in the city said gangs of refugee Serbs have been
torturing and killing Moslems and Croats. In some cases, local police
were helping to evict non-Serbs.
Kept behind were Croat men under the age of 45, in a move a United
Nations official called ''sinister''.
There were scenes of tearful reunion as waiting Croats spotted
relatives among the arrivals.
Most arrivals said they were chased from their homes.
''They came and said give us your house. I defended myself and they
beat me up,'' said Anto Matosevic, 65, who was driven out with wife
Marija on August 6.
''We ran to the woods and we hid in a cornfield. We had nothing to
eat,'' she said.
Describing conditions for Croats and Moslems in the region, one
refugee said non-Serbs were sacked from their jobs and forbidden to go
walking in the streets or attend church.
Serbs seen speaking to them risked having their own homes attacked or
burned. ''We were smaller than the black seeds of the poppy,'' Marija
Matosevic said.
One old man who swore he would never go back said: ''They took all
that we built up over the years, our pigs, our animals, our clothes, our
linen and our house.''
The UN believes there are 12-15,000 Croats in the Banja Luka region,
but says the true number may be less.
The spokesman said the UN expected Banja Luka's remaining Moslems, up
to 45,000, would be next for expulsion as Serbs complete a drive to
ethnically ''purify'' the north Bosnia town.
The non-Serb population before the war was over 500,000.
Although American officials have tried to keep secret details of the
proposals that have won European backing, leaks suggest the deal accepts
recent territorial gains by Serbs and Croats.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has ruled out any plan that would
require him to hand over the Muslim enclave of Gorazde to the Serbs -- a
concession that has been reported to be among the American ideas.
As the diplomatic pace has picked up, government forces have tried to
win ground and the respect they would need to counter international
demands that they abandon their war aims.
They launched a fierce offensive around Donji Vakuf on Saturday and
local UN observors said today it appeared they had won high ground on
both sides of the town.
The government wants to take the town and a key road running through
it.
The attack was the first major government assault since an attempt to
ease the siege of Sarajevo failed in June
In other fighting the area around the historic Adriatic coast city of
Dubrovnik was rocked by explosions throughout the night and Serb
shelling caused extensive damage, Croatian radio said. The city itself
was not targeted.
* French Defence Minister Charles Millon said today he had secured
Bosnian permission for French artillery to move up to a mountain west of
Sarajevo in support of the UN Rapid Reaction Force there.
Twelve British 105mm guns have formed the backbone of the reaction
force.
''The French mission is the mission of peace,'' Millon told reporters
after meeting with Bosnia's president, prime minister, and foreign
minister.--Reuter

British musical impresario Cameron Mackintosh yesterday received
unanimous support from councillors for his plan to build a luxury
ranch-style house on his 12,500-acre West Highland estate.
The multi-millionaire producer of Cats, Miss Saigon, and the revival
of Oliver, is keen to develop the property so he can devote more time to
his local business interests.
He also received support from members of Highland Regional Council's
planning committee, meeting in Fort William, for plans to give a
facelift to a small supermarket in Mallaig, his adopted village.
Only one objection was lodged against the plans.
The objector had argued that the single-storey building, which will be
sited 300ft up in the hills above Morar village, would cause a ''visual
intrusion in an unspoilt area of great attraction''.
However, it is felt ''very unlikely'' that Mr Mackintosh, 48, who is
regarded as a sympathetic landlord, will encounter further opposition.
Mr Mackintosh, who last month told The Herald he may provide financial
backing for a buy-out of Knoydart Estate, spent much of his childhood in
the West Highlands in his aunt and uncle's croft, which he later
inherited, on the shore of Loch Nevis.
The sale went down well with locals. Mr Mackintosh has already donated
#100,000 towards the Mallaig swimming pool, which he also opened, and
gave a #15,000 minibus to the village.
However, travelling from his croft to the North Morar estate involves
a boat journey which can be hazardous in winter.
Planning committee chairman, Councillor Michael Foxley, said Mr
Mackintosh would have to give an assurance that the environmental impact
of an access road to the house would be ''absolutely minimal''.
Regional councillor Ian Macdonald, who attended yesterday's planning
committee meeting, said he was not aware of any villagers who were
opposed to the plan.
''They are quite pleased at the prospect of Mr Mackintosh having a
permanent home here as far as I know,'' he said.
Mr Macdonald, 64, said he would be surprised if the proposal met
opposition as the planning process proceeded, and added: ''Some people
nowadays forget that the dark and deceptive glens that are so beloved
were full of houses some 200 years ago.
''The idea of preserving countryside in the Highlands is commendable
in some respects. However, we have to balance that with trying to
attract people back here to promote a more vibrant society.''
''We can't do that if we have acres and acres of unspoilt ground
reserved only for sheep and deer.''

ROYAL officials yesterday used a bus in a bid to take the press for a
ride.
Prince Edward's girlfriend Sophie Rhys-Jones was relegated to a staff
coach when the royals disembarked from Britannia yesterday morning to
start their annual holiday at Balmoral.
While Prince Edward travelled to Deeside in a limousine, his
girlfriend was left to board a single-deck Bluebird bus.
However, it was all part of a ruse to hoodwink the press pack into
thinking she had returned to London and was not joining Prince Edward at
Balmoral.
The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Prince Edward left the royal
yacht in Aberdeen and were taken away in a car with plenty of room for
another passenger.
As Prince Edward was driven away, he waved in the direction of
Britannia to indicate that Miss Rhys-Jones was still on board.
Twenty minutes later, Miss Rhys-Jones, 30, came down the gangplank and
boarded the coach which had been booked to take 26 staff to Aberdeen
airport to catch a flight to London.
However, at the airport she was transferred to a car and was driven
the remaining 50 miles to the castle to join Prince Edward.
There is speculation that the engagement of Prince Edward and Miss
Rhys-Jones will be announced later this year.
Their relationship has been given the blessing of the Queen and it was
evident from her inclusion in the royal party visiting the Queen Mother
at Scrabster on Sunday that she is already thought of as a family
member.
Her parents, Christopher and Mary, are expected to be invited to spend
a few days at Balmoral later this month.

MAVERICK millionaire Sir James Goldsmith is planning an anti-European
intervention in British politics which could hit the Conservatives hard
in marginal Scottish seats.
The Mexico-based magnate, who has already intervened in French
politics by winning election as an MEP, is planning to bankroll the
Referendum Party in fielding candidates against any sitting MP who
refuses to endorse the need for a referendum on closer European
integration.
While Labour would also be targeted, it is a campaign which would be
far more likely to appeal to dissident Tory voters and the only Scots
Tory who would be immune, as an open supporter of a referendum, is
Tayside North MP Bill Walker.
The Referendum Party is the offspring of the anti-European Bruges
Group -- so named after a speech by Lady Thatcher in 1988. A leading
light is young Scottish Thatcherite Patrick Robertson, who has been at
the centre of a series of political controversies, including an attack
on Prime Minister John Major for which he had to apologise.
Those who doubt the capacity of anti-European candidates to make their
mark in UK politics need look no further than the recent Perth and
Kinross by-election, where Vivian Linacre of the UK Independence Party
polled 504 votes. UKIP leader Dr Alan Sked, who is also a Scot, is a
close associate of Mr Robertson and an accommodation between the two
parties would seem likely.
Scottish Conservatives who might suffer in a Referendum Party
challenge include Phil Gallie in Ayr (majority 85), Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth (maj 703), Lord James Douglas Hamilton in Edinburgh West
(879), and Raymond Robertson in Aberdeen South (1517).
With Sir James apparently prepared to underwrite the deposit for
several hundred candidates all over Britain, such an intervention --
backed by the television advertising which such a major campaign would
earn -- could cause an even greater fright for Tories if Labour is
narrowing the gap in such seats as that of Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind in Edinburgh Pentlands (maj 4290).
Goldsmith aide Charles Filmer conceded that the campaign risked having
a greater impact on Tories than on even more Europhile opponents.
However, he said: ''Sir James has calculated that the risk is worth it.
''It just seems that nobody in the Conservative Party is listening at
the moment and it could be that what we do is further split the
Conservative and give the Labour party a clean run home.
''Obviously, we hope that won't happen, because the Labour Party is
even more committed to a federal Europe.''

MONKTONHALL colliery, the pit reopened by redundant miners who each
invested #10,000 in the operation, is not facing a cash crisis, its
management claimed yesterday in the wake of reports of trouble at the
colliery.
Mr Jackie Aitchison, personnel manager for Monktonhall Mineworkers
Ltd, dismissed the reports as ''speculation''.
He rejected a newspaper claim at the weekend that plans to float the
company on the stock market had been postponed.
''We have never ever said that we would float,'' he said at the pit.
''No-one in the company has said anything about flotation.''
Maintaining that there was no cash crisis, he said it was an
''extractive'' industry and, as equipment got old, it had to be
replaced.
''There has always been an ongoing cash-raising exercise and we will
be aware of this for a long time.''
Commenting on suggestions that the pit faced geology difficulties, he
said: ''Mother Nature laid this down hundreds of years ago. Of course
there is bad geology. We will get this in the future. It's part of
mining and we can overcome it.''
The 167 miners who invested their life savings nearly lost everything
two years ago.
It took a multi-million pound rescue by Edinburgh-based Waverley
Mining Finance to keep it in operation. The move gave Waverley Mining
49% of the shares. The miners at Western Europe's deepest mine retained
a 51% shareholding.
Last December, Monktonhall's chairman, Mr John Richards, said there
were three options for the future of the pit -- maintaining the status
quo, an outside bidder, and possible flotation of the company.
Mr Richards, whose background is in stockbroking, said there was no
reason why it could not be floated after establishing ''a two-year track
record''.
No-one representing Waverley Mining Finance was available for comment
at its Edinburgh office yesterday.

THE Indian Army last night was weighing the risks of an eleventh-hour
raid to free two British hostages as India ruled out swopping jailed
Kashmiri separatists for them.
Extremists holding Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, along with an American
and a German, refused to drop their execution ultimatum in renewed
contact with the Indian authorities.
A fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Ostroe, was found beheaded on Sunday
with the word Al-Faran, the name of his kidnappers, carved on his chest.
A note on his body warned that the other four hostages would meet the
same fate in 48 hours unless 15 Kashmiri militants were freed from
Indian jails.
Last night, India was standing firm in its determination not to free
jailed Kashmiri separatists in exchange for the four Western captives.
''The kidnappers have made it very clear that we release the hardcore
militants in lieu of the hostages. But we have firmly said no,'' Junior
Home Minister Rajesh Pilot said.
The Indian Government was keeping a range of options open. ''We will
go through the entire situation,'' said Prime Minister P V Narasimha
Rao's spokesman P V R K Prasad.
Army spokesman Colonel Anil Bhatt said: ''If there is any hope of
conducting a raid to get the hostages out alive, we will not hesitate.''
Other authorities spoke of dangers in carrying out such a rescue raid.
''There will be international pressure not to take strong action against
the abductors. Otherwise, we would comb the place and flush them out,''
an official said.
''All options are available to us and we have to do everything to get
our friends released from custody,'' Pilot said.
A spokesman for the state government of Jammu and Kashmir said it had
been in contact with the kidnappers yesterday but added: ''The militants
made no assurances.''
Mr Mangan, 34, an electrical contractor from Middlesbrough, Cleveland,
and Mr Wells, 23, a photography student from Blackburn, Lancashire, were
kidnapped six weeks ago from a campsite 60 miles east of the Kashmiri
summer capital, Srinagar.
They have been marched for days across remote Kashmiri mountains while
their kidnappers made repeated death threats.
The hostage takers claim Mr Mangan is critically ill after being
injured in a 25-minute shoot-out with Indian soldiers and have released
a photograph of him with blood soaking through bandages on his chest and
shoulders. Indian officials deny the incident took place and suggest the
picture could be a hoax.
Mr Ostroe, who shared their mental and physical ordeal, was emaciated
and ''very, very ill'', according to a senior Indian Government
official.
In a note hidden in his underwear he had written: ''I'm dying. There's
nothing to eat. There's nothing to live for.''
His body, in a simple wooden coffin with a floral wreath, was flown to
Delhi yesterday where his relatives were waiting. It was transferred to
a hospital for an autopsy to determine the cause of death.
Mr Mangan's wife, Julie, 33, and Mr Wells's girlfriend, Catherine
Moseley, who were captured and freed, are anxiously awaiting news at the
British High Commission in Delhi where they are staying with the wives
of the other two hostages.
Families in Britain were also living on their nerves.
Mr Mangan's father, Charles, said the murder of Mr Ostroe was ''a very
worrying development''.
Mr Wells's father, Bob, said: ''Apart from raising a private army and
sending it in, there is little we can do. Things were moving along quite
positively but now we are back at square one.''
Foreign Office Minister Sir Nicholas Bonsor described the outlook as
''grim''.
''I am afraid this particular group are not main-line terrorists and
therefore not rational,'' he said.
''At this critical time, we have redoubled our efforts with the other
governments concerned to try and bring about an early and safe release
of the remaining hostages.
''Responsibility for this barbaric act of violence rests with the
perpetrators, Al-Faran, and no-one else. I call on them to release the
remaining hostages unharmed without delay.''
Officials in India clung to the hope that hitherto-unfruitful
negotiations would help. ''What we have decided is that, notwithstanding
what happened, we should continue our dialogue,'' Home Secretary K
Padmanabhaiah said.
The authorities have kept open channels to the kidnappers and an
Indian intermediary made fresh contact with the guerrillas.
''There was a contact this morning,'' a spokesman for the state
government, K B Jandial, told reporters in Srinagar.
He gave no details but said the intermediary was in regular touch with
Al-Faran through the six-week ordeal.
At least one Western country, the United States, was firmly against
exchanging prisoners for the hostages. ''We are not interested in a
swop,'' a US diplomat said.
Amid condemnation of the murder from various nations, including
Pakistan, which disputes Kashmir, there was no clue on how India
expected to influence Al-Faran to free the captives.
Separatist groups including the pro-independence Jammu and Kashmir
Liberation Front (JKLF) and Harkat-Ul-Ansar, a group based in
Pakistan-ruled Kashmir, condemned Ostroe's killing.
Jammu and Kashmir's governor, K V Krishna Rao, joined in the
condemnation and said Al-Faran wanted India to free Pakistan-trained
militants.
Islamabad denies Indian charges of arming separatists and says it
gives them only moral and diplomatic support.
The UN Security Council yesterday also condemned the kidnapping.

Washington
HILLARY Clinton told a US presidential committee today to investigate
thoroughly why thousands of Gulf War veterans got sick and whether any
were struck with a ''Gulf War Syndrome''.
''No issue is off limits and every reasonable inquiry should be
pursued,'' Mrs Clinton told the first meeting of the President's
Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, formed to look into
undiagnosed illnesses that afflicted many soldiers who served in the
1990-91 allied effort to oust Iraqi invasion forces from Kuwait.
Mrs Clinton said the question of whether that produced some previously
unknown ''Gulf War Syndrome'' has not been answered, even though
research so far has found no evidence that a specific syndrome exists.
She told the committee that research so far ''indicates that thousands
of veterans who were healthy when they left for the Gulf War are now
ill,'' and many believe they are victims of an affiction associated with
that particular conflict.
''Based on the research to date, however, experts have concluded there
is not enough evidence to call this a syndrome,'' Mrs Clinton said.
However, she said there are still disagreements about the likely
causes of the illnesses and the best treatments.
''The President has appointed this advisory committee because we do
not yet have the answers to these important questions,'' she said.
The possibility of a ''Gulf War Syndrome'' was raised at congressional
hearings after the war by veterans who reported severe fatigue,
headaches, muscle pain, and memory loss.
Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown told the committee it took the
US Government 20 years to conclude that ''Agent Orange,'' a defoliant
used by American forces in the Vietnam War, caused a variety of
illnesses in soldiers who served there. Brown said it must not take that
long to find the causes and treatments of Gulf War diseases.
A panel of government experts told the committee that examination of
58,000 Gulf War veterans has found no pattern or evidence of a single
''Gulf War Syndrome''.
The Defence and Veterans Affairs Departments have said in the past
that about 15% of the 58,000 had illnesses that could not immediately be
diagnosed. That would amount to about 9000 cases.
Assistant Secretary of Defence Stephen Joseph told the committee that
although the examinations found no evidence of a single ''Gulf War
Syndrome,'' they were regular medical examinations and not a scientific
study designed to prove or disprove the existence of such a syndrome.
However, Joseph and other government experts said growing evidence
suggests there is no single syndrome but rather a variety of illnesses
among Gulf War veterans that must be diagnosed and treated. -- Reuter

A PRISONER has been charged after drugs were seized in Shotts prison,
it was confirmed last night.
It is understood that about 60 grammes of cocaine was recovered by
prison officers.
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman confirmed to The Herald: ''A
prisoner has been charged by police following the discovery of a
quantity of illicit powder within Shotts Prison.
''Drugs can and do get into prisons despite the best efforts of staff
to prevent the practice. In this case, due to staff vigilance, a
quantity of material was discovered.''
It is understood that the substance has been tested by forensic
scientists from Strathclyde Police, who confirmed that it was cocaine.
It is unusual for cocaine to be found within Scottish jails. In most
cases, cannabis and Temazepam have been recovered.
Shotts top-security prison -- dubbed Scotland's showpiece jail -- is
no stranger to controversy. It has a current prison roll of about 450
long-term prisoners although it has a capacity to hold 535 prisoners.
Earlier this year, staff described the jail as a ''powder-keg prison''.
The prison houses a pioneering unit set up to replace Barlinnie
Special Unit in Glasgow, which closed last January. The Shotts induction
centre is designed to help inmates come to terms with long-term jail
sentences.

NATIONAL Lottery funds may be used to cut ticket prices for concerts
and operas.
Current rules mean the money can be spent only on major building
projects but the Department of National Heritage said it would not take
a drastic change in legislation to open up the criteria to include
reducing the cost of tickets.
However, it indicated no changes were likely before next year.
An Arts Council spokeswoman said: ''This would all be subject to the
Government adapting the guidelines.
''We may make some recommendations to the DNH at some point in the
future but no discussions have yet taken place.''
The council, one of the groups which distributes National Lottery
money, faced strong criticism last month for giving #55m to redevelop
London's Royal Opera House. That grant cannot be used to cut ticket
prices.
A DNH spokesman said Ministers would be looking at the idea.
''The Arts Council has indicated it would want to look at the way the
Lottery was operating. This is something that the chairman would be keen
to see happen.
''It would not need a change in primary legislation to bring this in.
It would not be a particularly dramatic change.''
He added: ''It is early yet. The Lottery has only been running for
nine months.
''Ministers would want to look at changes to the Lottery as a whole.
It is not something they would want to take on board piecemeal.''
* A football club which was refused Lottery funding has become an
operatic society in a bid to win grant cash.
The players of Oakfield Football Club, based in Ryde, Isle of Wight,
were furious when the National Lottery refused their application for
#75,000 to build a new sports and community pavilion.
''We have changed our name from Oakfield Football Club to the Oakfield
Operatic Society to give ourselves a better chance of getting a grant,''
said club general manager Mark Cass.
''It's crazy really but when you are dealing with an organisation like
this you have to be innovative to stand a chance. An honest self-help
sports club like ours which serves the community doesn't seem to stand a
chance otherwise.''
Mr Cass said the club would still be playing football in the Isle of
Wight Saturday League.

SCOTTISH Tories have been invited along to a Fringe show which
features a Prime Minister called Margaret who goes mad.
The invitation has come from the theatre group behind the show The
Prime Minister's Son, which is running at the Gilded Balloon in
Edinburgh.
Richard Hallam, who plays Margaret's son, Mark said he hoped top
Tories like Scottish Conservative Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst would
come along.
A Scottish Conservative Party spokewoman said last night Sir Michael
was on holiday just now but the invitation would be put before him when
he returned.
''We take an active interest in the festival and I'm sure he will
consider going,'' she said.
The show centres on the angst that Mark feels about being attached to
the apron strings of one of the most influential people in Britain.
Richard said: ''The play centres on Margaret's rise to power and then
her descent into madness. I believe she comes out of the play quite
well, unlike her son Mark.
''You never know -- we may get a few Scots Tories coming along to
laugh at Mark.''
Theatre group spokeswoman Sian Prime said: ''We are living five
minutes walk from the Tory party HQ and thought we would invite them
along.
''We believe we are keeping a hair's breadth on the right side of the
law.''

TOURISM in Scotland has received a late boost as a result of the good
weather, according to a survey carried out by the Federation of Small
Businesses.
The survey, which indicates an upsurge in spending by visitors during
the past month, is an update of one published at the beginning of August
which showed that the season up to mid July was worse than last summer.
Last year's summer season was acknowledged as one of the worst ever
for tourism.
A total of 45% of those business people questioned earlier this month
said the early part of this summer season had been good or excellent
while 55% said it had been poor or dreadful.
However, the updated survey shows that there has been an upsurge in
the past month, with 90% of those questioned -- mainly hoteliers,
restaurateurs, and craft-shop owners -- saying the season is good or
excellent and just 10% describing it as poor or dreadful.
Mr Don Junor, FSB Scottish tourism spokesman said yesterday: ''This is
clearly due to excellent weather that there has been a visible
improvement.''
FSB Scottish secretary Bill Anderson said he would be writing to
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and industry spokesman George Kynoch
warning the Government that it must not assume tourism will improve
without further effort and calling for more investment in the industry.
He said: ''What would have happened if this year had been a year with
bad weather like 1993? What will happen next year? They just cannot be
complacent. We have to market Scotland better, particularly in the UK
and we have to give a level of service and value for money so that, when
the tourist comes, we encourage them to come back.''
A Scottish Tourist Board spokeswoman welcomed the latest survey
findings and said: ''We had a strong marketing drive last year,
particularly targeting people in England, and we hope that this has
contributed but we are not interested in a good year in isolation but a
trend over a number of years.''
The STB today will launch Scotland's biggest yet industry-wide
promotion for autumn.
Entitled Autumn Gold, it will include discounts on air and rail travel
to Scotland and special offers on accommodation.
* Scotland's scenic beauty has created a major jobs boom in the
Highlands, according to a report.
Research shows that areas such as environmental protection and
wildlife tourism provide twice as many jobs as they did in the
mid-1980s.
The results have surprised and delighted local economists as they
prove that the environment is an important creator of lasting
employment.
Yesterday, a spokesman for Highlands and Islands Enterprise said: ''In
the past, too many people thought that wildlife simply meant a few jobs
for foresters and people looking after rare birds.
''However, these figures show that protection and understanding of
Scotland's natural heritage means hundreds of new jobs and brings a huge
boost to the economy of many fragile communities.''
The number of people employed in looking after the environment and in
helping tourists discover the countryside has leaped to 2000 over the
last eight years and the growth is expected to continue into the next
century.
''Before this work was carried out, little was known about the
economic impact of the environment sector in the Highlands and
Islands,'' said Mr John Watt, of HIE, who commissioned the report
jointly with Scottish Natural Heritage.

Parents in Ayrshire are to
step up their campaign against plans to close a school which suffers
from sick building syndrome and relocate the children, all of whom have
profound learning difficulties.
They have been joined by parents of other pupils who would be affected
by the relocation plans and have enlisted the support of MPs Phil Gallie
and George Foulkes.
Strathclyde region's education department has recommended closure and
demolition of Craigpark School in Ayr, which was opened in 1980 for
special needs pupils.
Since 1992, when teachers, visitors, and some pupils complained of
feeling unwell in the school, a variety of tests have been carried out.
Those affected complained of nausea, headaches, and skin irritation
but, despite investigation of the water, soil, and ventilation system,
the cause remains unknown.
The region has sent out a consultation document which recommends that
the 19 pupils move to a combined campus of Ayr's Rosebank and Southpark
schools, with the Rosebank pupils, who have moderate learning
difficulties, moving either to Doonfoot Primary or Mainholm Academy.
This has not won the approval of parents and a joint action group has
been set up to fight the moves.
Tomorrow, the Craigpark pupils will return to a temporary unit at
Mainholm which was set up for them and their teachers but the campaign
goes on to seek a change of mind from the education department.
Mr Roy McHattie, from Alloway, whose eight-year-old son Craig attends
Craigpark, said: ''We are still not convinced that every avenue has been
explored towards saving Craigpark.
''If it must be demolished then what we wish to see is a
self-contained unit for the children elsewhere in which they can
continue their lives in the family atmosphere which has been built up by
the head teacher, staff, and pupils.''
He added: ''The strength of feeling among all the parents involved
shows, I believe, that the region has failed to put the interests of the
pupils and the parents first before policy and dogma. Their policy of
integrating pupils of mixed ability in the school system may be
admirable but, in this case, it simply won't work.''
Mrs Janet Ferguson, of Failford, whose five-year-old son Matthew has
just completed a year at Rosebank, said: ''I would support any move to
have a unit for Craigpark children but I do not believe the solution put
forward by the region is the best one.
''The children need a settled place to learn and this disruption would
do them no good at all. My son has to be in a safe environment and I am
not sure he can have this away from Rosebank, where the staff are used
to looking after these children.''
Mr Gallie, MP for Ayr, said: ''I have asked the region to provide more
answers as to what has been done to identify and cure the problems at
Craigpark. I feel there could be more done and there is no doubt that
the parents want their children to stay there.''
Mr Foulkes, in whose Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley constituency
many of the families affected live, said: ''I will visit all the schools
involved on Wednesday in order to get a clear picture of what is going
on. It is a very difficult situation and I hope the best solution for
the children can be found.''
A meeting of parents has been organised for Thursday evening at
Rosebank School and a fun day is to be staged on Sunday at Ayr
racecourse.
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde region's education department said:
''The consultation period ends in the middle of next month and all
comments and suggestions will be closely studied before a final decision
is made.
''A lot of time and money has been spent on trying to identify the
problem with the building without success.''

THE Duke of Edinburgh remembers the horrors of seeing former prisoners
of war returning from Japanese camps in a BBC documentary being screened
this weekend to coincide with the VJ Day anniversary.
In the film he describes meeting emaciated survivors when they came
aboard his ship for the long journey home.
He says: ''It was an emotional experience. These people were naval
officers who hadn't been in a naval atmosphere for three or four years,
sometimes longer.
''When we sat down in the mess they were suddenly in an atmosphere
that they recognised. They sat there with tears running down their
cheeks. They just couldn't speak.''
The Duke discusses the question of reconciliation with Japan, saying
it is unreasonable to expect each individual to forget what happened or
to pretend they were not desperately affected by the experience.
The Duke was involved in transporting returning PoWs on the first leg
of their journey home.
The film, Prince Philip: The War Years, is being shown on BBC1 next
Sunday.
The Duke, who was then plain Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, recalls
his battleship, HMS Valiant, being hit by bombs in the Mediterranean.
The young lieutenant had seen action off North Africa, Malta, and
Italy and been mentioned in dispatches for his action with searchlights
during the decisive battle of Cape Matapan in 1941.
Remembering how his shipmates died or were wounded in enemy actions,
the Duke says: ''It was part of the fortunes of war. We didn't have
counsellors rushing around every time somebody let off a gun, you know
asking, 'Are you all right -- are you sure you don't have a ghastly
problem?' You just got on with it.''
When the Japanese military surrendered to American General Douglas
MacArthur on September 2, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri, the Duke was
serving aboard the destroyer HMS Whelp.
His crew were busy painting the hull to be smart for the historic
occasion but listened to the ceremonies over loudspeakers hung over the
destroyer's side.
The film traces the Duke's career from Dartmouth Naval College in 1939
to the Japanese surrender.

IN a bid to become more user-friendly, a new Scottish local authority
is to ditch years of council tradition by speaking in plain English.
South Lanarkshire Council, which assumes control next spring,
yesterday gave a ''no jargon'' promise, a move which it believes will
also lead to savings on official forms.
The Labour shadow authority will train staff to speak plainly and
avoid ''officialese'' at all costs, which flies in the face of local
government tradition in Scotland, which has seen some councils churn out
reams of official papers which are all-but unreadable, except to a small
group of officials, and particularly dogged councillors.
Council leader, Mr Tom McCabe, said: ''We are trying to revolutionise
the language of local government. We will be a plain-talking council.
All our communications will be clear, simple, and understandable.''
He said that all council forms would be made simpler, and added:
''There is no doubt in my mind that poorly written and badly designed
forms create problems.
''The result is that many folk don't receive the grants and benefits
they are entitled to.''
Last night, the Plain English Campaign, which has declared war on all
forms of ''gobbledygook, legalese, small print, and bureaucratic
language'', welcomed the shadow authority's decision.

Moscow
THE commander of rebel fighters in breakaway Chechnya today refused to
sign a protocol setting out mechanisms for implementing a military deal,
Itar-Tass news agency said.
It quoted Aslan Maskhadov as saying he remained committed to the
military deal signed on July 30 but objected to how some aspects were to
be implemented.
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had earlier threatened the rebels
with the ''harshest measures'' if they ignored his demand to agree to
start laying down their guns as called for in a July 30 peace accord.
The accord on ending military hostilities, at first hailed as a
breakthrough, now appears near collapse.
''The Chechen chief of staff, Aslan Maskhadov, refused this evening to
sign a plan for carrying out the military part of the agreement on a
peaceful settlement in Chechnya,'' Tass said.
Since orchestrating the military agreement, the two sides have
differed over how to carry it out. The rebels want most of their forces
kept intact or turned into armed self-defence units, while Moscow wants
all fighters to lay down their arms.
0 Interfax news agency quoted an interior ministry spokesman in the
Chechen capital Grozny as saying Moscow would start disarming the rebels
unilaterally after Maskhadov's refusal to sign the protocol.
However, Tass said Maskhadov and Russia's military commander in
Chechnya would discuss the situation on Tuesday.
President Boris Yeltsin had met Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and
two other top ministers today. He expressed dissatisfaction with the
pace of disarmament of the Chechen rebels.
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said on Saturday that if the rebels
did not disarm voluntarily, Russia would disarm them by force -- a
veiled threat to restart the conflict which has subsided since a
ceasefire was agreed in June.

A PICTURESQUE Scottish village has been thrust into the forefront of a
nationwide environmental campaign to block plans for open-cast mines.
Environmentalists believe the situation at Ormiston, East Lothian,
could prove to be a test case for similar applications elsewhere in the
country.
People in the village, 12 miles from Edinburgh, have been shocked by
plans to build two open-cast mines on its boundaries.
If both are approved, Ormiston would have a 110-acre mine to the west
of it and another 205-acre one to the north-west.
The Scottish Opencast Action Group believes that if either of the
applications is approved it could open the floodgates for similar
developments up and down the country.
''The outcome of the plans for Ormiston will have repercussions
throughout Scotland,'' said Robin Frame, vice-convener of the action
group. ''Make no mistake about it, this is a very important campaign.
''Here we have a pretty village in the country where life will be
disrupted by two massive, unnecessary open-cast coal mining
developments.
''Other companies with similar plans for open-cast mines will be
looking at this thinking if they can get planning permission in such a
lovely country area they can get planning permission anywhere.
''Planning authorities in East Lothian must make sure this development
is rejected to nip other such developments in the bud.
''What amazes us is that Scotland is awash with energy. It produces
more than it needs and exports a lot of it. There is no need for these
open-cast mine developments.
''The damage on the rural environment around Ormiston should be enough
to convince planners this should not get the go-ahead.''
Scottish Office officials are compiling a list of the number of
open-cast coal mines in Scotland.
Environmentalists believe around 35 are in existence with around a
further 20 in the pipeline. Nine campaigns against open-cast
developments are being waged in Scotland.
A public meeting in Elphinstone Village Hall, a few miles from
Ormiston, tonight will discuss one of the mining applications from
William Grant Ltd. The other application lodged with East Lothian
District Council is from James Fenton and Sons.
A spokeswoman for the consultants handling the James Fenton
application said in Scotland developers had no guidance on open-cast
mine applications. The spokeswoman for Taylor Dalgleish Associates said:
''In many cases, East Lothian villages are former mining communities.
Time passes, technology changes, and instead of deep-mining there is now
open-cast mining.
''You cannot have a gold mine where there is no gold. Similarily you
cannot have a coal mine where there is no coal.
''That is why this area has been chosen. But developers have no
guidance or strategic planning guidelines for such developments from the
local authorities.''
Mr Gordon Haig, vice-chairman of Campaign for the Ormiston
Environment, played for Berwick Rangers when they shocked Rangers by
beating them 1-0 in the 1967 Scottish Cup. Now the former footballer is
taking on the developers.
Mr Haig said: ''Now that the true scale of the threat is out in the
open we can promise them one heck of a fight.''
The campaign against the open-cast mines has galvanised the local
community in the tranquil village with its tree-lined main street.
In summer, the local children play in the fields and hundreds of
people come to walk and cycle in the country lanes.
The biggest highlight for villagers in recent years came when their
junior football team, whose pitch is next to a small burn in the middle
of a public park, got to the final of the Scottish Junior Cup. They were
beaten 1-0 by Cumnock Juniors.
The villagers, who last raised their voices shouting for their
football team, are now up in arms over the developments. Time previously
spent organising the local flower show or gala day has been overtaken
raising the profile of the campaign against the mines.
If both planning applications are approved, Ormiston would be in the
words of a local ''like the cowboys in a wagon train surrounded by
Indians''.
The Fenton plan is for a 110-acre site to the west of the village,
while William Grant Ltd plans a 205-acre site 250 metres away from the
nearest house in the village.
Environmentalists and the 2000 people in Ormiston believe any promise
of jobs will not compensate for the loss of village life.
A dossier on the Grant development has been put together by opponents
of the proposal. They claim the site and haulage route of the Grant's
development would skirt a local railway walk for a distance of more than
a mile. Lorries would carry away 750,000 tonnes of coal over a five-year
period along a country road.
The access route would be close to a prehistoric settlement known as
Elphinstone Tower. Historic Scotland has told council officials that the
development would need approval from them as well as an archaeological
assessment of the surrounding area.
Scottish Natural Heritage has expressed concern over the size of the
developments and the enclosure of part of the railway walk and the
Bellyford Burn.
Mr Peter Collins, East Lothian District Council's head of development,
has told Grant's agents that the mine and traffic would have a
significant effect on the environment.
He has said applicants must carry out a study on the impact on the
enviroment and local traffic.
Mr Tom Ferguson, a local councillor, said feeling was strong against
both developments.
He said there had been a wide range of concerns expressed to him on
such matters as water pollution, dust levels, and environmental impact.
Mr Ferguson said: ''Ormiston is a lovely village and a place that
locals like living in and want to see remain as it is.
''One of my main concerns is the health of local people. We have many
former miners in the village with breathing difficulties caused by
mining related disorders. Dust from open-cast mines will certainly
affect these people.
''On the jobs front, people in Ormiston realise open-cast coal mining
needs specialist workers and believe not many local jobs would be
created and if they were they would only be short-term ones for say
labourers and the tea laddie.
''Because I am on the planning committee that will ultimately decide
the application, I cannot say too much more but it has been local people
who have really been making their points known to the authorities.''
Mr Haig, vice-chairman of the Campaign for the Ormiston Environment,
said: ''Planners must take into account the combined impact of two
massive mines on rural communities where even one would be an
environmental disaster.
''Issues like dust, noise, and the threat to the local river from
water pollution have already been raised in our campaign against the
first proposed mine. The difference now is that the scale of the threat
has more than doubled.''
A spokesman for the company which acts for the application for James
Fenton and Sons defended the plan. The spokeswoman for Taylor Dalgleish
Associates admitted two rights of way on the site were under threat as
was a ''skimpy'' hedgerow.
She said 15 full-time jobs would be available through their
application and suitably qualified local people were available to apply.
She said the visual impact of the development would be ''at a level
acceptable but not significant''. Dust levels could be monitored and
traffic levels controlled, she said.
No-one was available from William Grant (Mining) Limited or their
agents, J Ross and Co for comment.
An East Lothian District Council spokesman said both applications were
being looked at by the council but had still to be put in front of the
planning committee.

Hamilton
BERMUDIANS were set to vote on independence from Britain despite a
hurricane whipping the island with high winds and heavy rains.
The British colony's 38,000 voters have waited for months to decide
their future by saying yes or no to the question: ''Are you in favour of
independence for Bermuda?''
Heavy rains and gales hit Bermuda early today and by evening Hurricane
Felix was just 75 miles south-west of the colony.
High waves slammed the island chain's southern coast as the first
hurricane-force winds blew foliage from trees and littered roadways with
debris. The last commercial airline flights had departed by early
afternoon, and remaining tourists settled down with residents for what
forecasters said would be a long night of bad weather.
The hurricane's approach led many residents to question plans for
tomorrow's referendum, but the Government insisted it would go ahead
with a vote it was not legally empowered to postpone.
Premier Sir John Swan said he could not change the date of referendum
without the approval of Parliament, which could not meet because of the
storm. Members of his Government said they wanted the vote to go ahead
as planned to resolve the issue.
''Let's get this referendum over and put Bermuda back to business,''
Minister of Tourism C V ''Jim'' Wooldridge, an opponent of independence,
saids.
Polling stations were due to open at 10am , but heavy hurricane damage
could delay voting. Supervisors at the 20 polling stations have legal
power to postpone balloting if the weather makes voting impractical.
For the independence measure to carry, a majority of the voters and at
least 40% of the total electorate, or 15,000 voters, must cast ballots
in favour. Even without the storm, there seemed little chance that many
would say yes.
An opinion poll published in late July by The Royal Gazette, Bermuda's
only daily newspaper, showed potential voters who oppose independence
outnumbered supporters 63% to 17%, with the remainder undecided.
Businessmen who enjoy Bermuda's low taxes and British legal system
have made no secret of their support for continued colonial
status.--Reuter

centre for the reinsurance market in the last five years, with an
estimated 30% of the world market. Reuter.

Abuja
LIBERIA's main rebel leader Charles Taylor arrived in Nigeria's
capital today for peace talks, saying he was ready to end his country's
more than five-year-old conflict.
''We are here to discuss lasting peace in Liberia,'' Taylor told
reporters at Abuja international airport after alighting from an Ivorian
airline plane.
''We are Liberians and we should bring peace as we love our people,''
said Taylor, who came with a large delegation.
He and other Liberian faction leaders are due to start two-day peace
talks on Wednesday.
This will be followed by a meeting of West African foreign ministers
on a nine-nation Liberia committee on Friday.
The last round of peace talks in Monrovia last month adjourned without
a deal. Neither Taylor, the man who launched the war in 1989, nor his
rival Alhaji Kromah attended.
The international community is increasingly impatient with the
inability of the faction leaders to agree on power-sharing and end more
than five years of civil war.
The United Nations has said it will withdraw its military observers in
September if there is no agreement.
Military sources in Monrovia said on Saturday fighting between
militiamen and the ECOMOG West African intervention force had broken out
70km east of the capital on the Monrovia-Buchanan highway.
They said the clashes followed the ambush of a taxi on the road last
Thursday.
''That is why ECOMOG had to move in to clear the highway,'' said a
Nigerian ECOMOG soldier who asked not to be identified. ''We know who
the attackers are and that is why we are pursuing them.''

<HEADLINE>Police launch amnesty for over-the-counter drugs</HEADLINE>

UNWANTED household medicines which can trigger addiction and abuse
were made the subject of a drugs amnesty launched by Strathclyde Police
yesterday.
Seventy-nine stations within the region are to bin and then burn
prescribed tablets and capsules brought in by the public on a
no-questions-asked basis, under the disposal phase of the drugs
initiative Operation Eagle which runs until August 31.
Particular targets are the tranquilliser Temazepam and the painkiller
Temgesic, or ''jellies'' and ''tems'', whose household availability
makes them a favourite of many young and first-time abusers.
Assistant Chief Constable Crispian Strachan said: ''The aim is to
clear bedroom and bathroom cabinets from the unneeded common drugs that
become subject to abuse.
''They fall into the wrong hands or people take them thinking 'what if
I try this?'
''It's a roulette and the sooner we stop it or help to stop it the
better.''
He admitted there was only ''a slim possibility'' that hardened
addicts would respond but added: ''The police are not going to pursue
any people who bring drugs in and we would welcome any addict who
decided to use the scheme to make a fresh start.''
However Superintendent Alastair McNaughton, the officer in charge of
Operation Eagle, stressed that the existence of the scheme did not offer
an alibi for anyone found in possession of drugs.
''We would be very careful with anyone caught who said that they were
halfway between their home and the police office and were taking the
drugs in.
''The individual case would be looked at but I would anticipate we'd
still have to report them to the fiscal.''
However drug action groups last night warned that the abuse of
''hard'' drugs such as heroin could increase during the scheme.
Mr Dave Liddell, Scottish Drugs Forum director, said: ''Reducing the
level of access to some of these household drugs is positive in that it
might stop people initially experimenting, but for those who are
dependent on them it is irrelevant.
''If supply of one drug dries up, these people will look elsewhere and
there is evidence to suggest that removing Temgesic availability
increases heroin abuse.''
He called for greater prominence to be given to ''demand side''
initiatives, involving counselling drug users on their addiction.
Between the launch of Operation Eagle on June 1 and August 6,
Strathclyde Police made 1730 arrests for drug offences, 679 of them
involving dealers.
The disposal phase will complement the existing schemes run by
pharmacies within the region, which disposed of more than 3000kg of
unwanted medicines in Greater Glasgow last year.
Strathclyde Police advised elderly people who wished to hand in their
excess medication to make arrangements for family members or home helps
to accompany them in the interests of safety.
* The Health Education Authority will submit proposals to Ministers
this autumn for a three-year #14m advertising campaign which concedes
for the first time that drugs can be pleasurable.
The campaign will stress the need for young people to consider the
dangers of drugs before experimenting with them.
It would be a departure from previous advertisements featuring graphic
depictions of the effects of drug use, but the Government denies it has
''gone soft'' on the issue of drugs.
Health Minister John Bowis said: ''There is no way the Government
would be saying anything other than that drugs are dangerous, drugs can
wreck your life, they can wreck your health, your career, your school
career, your family your friendships.''
But faced with evidence that the number of hard-drug addicts has risen
by 20% to 34,000, Ministers are concerned that previous HEA campaigns
have failed to address the problem.
An HEA spokeswoman said: ''The campaign that the HEA is managing on
behalf of the Department of Health will not be 'going soft' on drugs.
''We will never advocate, condone, or glamorise drug-taking and our
material will carry the message that abstention is the only safe
decision.''
The campaign, which the HEA said would be based on ''rigorous
research'', is part of a Government effort set out in the Tackling Drugs
Together White Paper published earlier this year.
Last month the HEA confirmed shock tactics would no longer be used.
