THE Personal Investment Authority (PIA), the new investment watchdog
in charge of regulating the sale of life insurance and unit trusts is
shaping up as a rather more toothsome watchdog than its predecessors,
FIMBRA and LAUTRO.
The PIA, which took on the job in July of last year amid considerable
controversy concerning the composition of its board, has recently issued
a number of stern warnings on the marketing of corporate PEPs and
flexible annuities.
Corporate PEPs which invest in corporate bonds have been heralded as a
welcome halfway house between the risk of losing your shirt on the stock
market and leaving your money to safely rot in a bank or building
society account.
Flexible annuities have been welcomed too as a way of overcoming the
annuity lottery which has led to some pensions becoming dependent on the
interest rate at the time of retirement.
On corporate PEPs, which will be launched within the next month, the
PIA demands that investors be told that providing a high income involves
a degree of risk that capital values may fall or that capital growth may
be restricted.
It wants warnings that corporate bonds aren't a risk-free investment.
Companies issuing the underlying bonds can go bust, and that funds may
be tempted to invest in high-yielding bonds with low credit ratings.
The PIA is also concerned that words commonly used to describe bonds,
such as ''fixed interest'', ''certain'' and ''assured'', hint at
guarantees which don't exist. Where there is no guarantee, the PIA wants
this spelled out.
On managed annuities, the PIA is worried that people will make
withdrawals from their personal pension without understanding the
consequences. The proposals which allow people up to age 75 to take an
income from their personal pension rather than buying an annuity are an
attractive option if interest rates are low.
But the PIA wants people to know that taking an income reduces the
value of the fund and that future investment returns may not compensate
for the amount withdrawn. Also people are taking a gamble that annuity
rates will rise and this might not be the case.
Changes to the Finance Bill now make it easier for people to take a
smaller income from their personal pension fund. The Government
originally proposed a maximum withdrawal equivalent to the prevailing
annuity rate, with the minimum set at 70%. The minimum has now been
reduced to 35%. People who can make do on less while they wait for
better annuity rates can now do so without danger of severely eroding
the value of their fund.
This is all good stern stuff from the PIA, and if all this information
is contained in the point of sale literature salesmen give their clients
and their training demands that they explain it, then there can't be any
complaints that people didn't understand what they were buying. From the
consumer's point of view this looks like a welcome new tough stance
designed to stamp out the scandal of mis-selling.
However, Jim Stretton, chief executive of Standard Life's UK operation
who resigned from the PIA board in January 1994, remains unconvinced
that the PIA is up to regulating the industry. ''The PIA is still
operating in exactly the same cumbersome, bureaucratic and costly way of
its predecessors. It's a system of regulation which values paperwork
above the quality of the product or the advice.
''A client may be sold something which isn't entirely suitable but if
the company has filled in all the paperwork they get away with it. On
the other hand a company can do the right thing by a client, but if the
paper work isn't there, the company is found in default.
''Regulation needs an entirely fresh approach, and I think there are
signs that the PIA may be moving in this direction. Regulation needs to
be a lot less bureaucratic and it must place some responsibility with
the consumer.
''I want the PIA to concentrate on making sure the consumer is better
educated, that they have the correct information put before them at the
point of sale and that companies are committed to training their
staff.''
The life insurance industry is going through a tough time. Sales have
been hit by the overselling of endowment mortgages and the incorrect
selling of personal pensions. But are life insurance companies becoming
the dinosaurs of the financial services industry?
Jim Stretton dismisses any such apocalyptic talk: ''I am very
optimistic. The industry sells products which people need to protect
themselves and their families. There will be a shakeout, companies will
merge, but the industry will come through much stronger.''

THE small private investor is alive and well and welcome on the
register of small private companies which have ambitions to get bigger.
He helps to create a more active and liquid market in the shares which
is the sort of thing a company needs if it is to attract a bigger
following among institutions and get sufficient backing to mount rights
issues for expansion or arrange share-based takeover deals.
One of the reasons for having a Stock Exchange quotation for your
company's shares is after all so that new ones can be issued to help
expansion. It sounds a simple and logical thing but it is important in
the eyes of a lot of experts to have a reasonable amount of buying and
selling activity in the shares.
The size of a company also matters so far as institutional investors
are concerned. Some fund managers will take only a passing interest in
companies with less than #100m market capitalisation. Others spend a lot
of time investigating the #50m and #25m companies. Interest is reckoned
to increase once certain size barriers such as #25m are crossed.
Mike Armitage, managing director of European Colour whose company has
now capitalised at around #33m following a rights issue for the
acquisition of the complementary Diecom firm, says the success of a
company's shares owes a lot to liquidity.
European Colour was formed some seven years ago by merging two
companies, both in the chemical colours business, which were facing
problems. He spent three years quietly improving such things as
research, cost control and production, and then, when he could see the
company was on an upward path, decided to ''do a bit of
trumpet-blowing''.
An important part of that was talking to stockbrokers specialising in
advice to private clients and drawing their attention to his firm.
''We tried to create real market interest in our shares at a size of
deal which you could expect to happen,'' he says. Institutions want
largish stakes in order to justify the time they spend keeping an eye on
a company and he recalls that some time ago when his share price was
around 40p-50p one indicated it wanted to buy a million shares.
The arrival of such a big potential buyer put the price up 10% so the
institution backed off and decided to build up a stake more slowly with
smaller deals. The number of shares has been increased by the rights
issue and the number of deals is running at a rate of 3000-4000 a year,
with turnover currently averaging 200,000 shares a week. The current
price is around 83p.
Interest in the company has now been built up to a point where 11
broker analysts attended a meeting with the directors this week when the
company announced its results for the year to the end of March, and four
more telephoned.
Some 30% of the company's shares are at present held by institutional
investors, 20% by large private investors and the remainder by smaller
private holders. Mr Armitage says he believes ''smaller companies have
to have a high percentage of shares held by active private clients''.
Activity in the shares has increased significantly in relation to the
size of the company, he says, and ''we are beginning to behave as if we
were a bigger company''.
After showing increases in each half-year report for three years the
company this week reported pre-tax profits up from #1.22m to #1.87m for
the full year. Analysts estimate that the new acquisition will increase
current year profits by around #900,000 and that by this time next year
the enlarged group could be reporting an annual total of #3m.
Current projections suggest the company has three to five years'
organic growth ahead of it, but Mr Armitage is concerned that beyond
that point further growth in its speciality niche may be difficult. So
he will sooner or later be looking around for another acquisition
involving anything up to #10m to expand the company into being a
speciality chemicals group.
To achieve this he will need both a core of supportive institutions
and active private client interest so he will keep on talking about the
company and hopes to visit Scotland next month to do just that.
Willingness to explain about its company has also been winning new
institutional and private investor friends for Doeflex, the speciality
plastics company. Something over 10% of its shares are already held in
Scotland and a rights issue, also to finance an acquisition, has brought
in new shareholders.
Finance director Bill Trendell believes that more fund managers will
be taking an interest in the company now that the rights issue has moved
its market capitalisation up to around #28m and it has crossed the
significant #25m barrier.
Making sure that stockbrokers advising private clients understood the
company brought important activity in the shares and, together with
institutional interest, must have helped make the acquisition possible.
Before the share issue the company had five institutional shareholders
with holdings of more than 3% each. Mr Trendell hopes the number will
soon double.
So far both companies have done well for their shareholders,
justifying the increased investor interest, and seem full of confidence
for the future. But the classic advice for the small investor is that
small companies can be risky as well as rewarding, so need following
more closely than the giants.
This message will need to be borne in mind particularly carefully when
the new Alternative Investment Market opens up on June 19. This market
will be predominantly for very small and new companies not so far dealt
in on the exchange.
As always, if you feel you or your broker know a company sufficiently,
you could do well with some of them. But there will, if history is
anything to go by, be both winners and losers. So for this market in
particular it may be safest to venture in by way of a managed fund where
a professional will be keeping a close eye on the investments.

A NEW book, ''Managing the Pensions Revolution'', a practical guide to
pension schemes, has just been published following new legislation in
the wake of the Maxwell scandal and the Goode Report which will mean
upheaval in every pension scheme in the country.
This jargon-free guide, written by Sue Ward and published in
association with the Industrial Society, gives an overview of the
current system, looking at basic state pensions, state earnings related
pensions (SERPS) and personal pensions as well as the different types of
occupational pensions. It analyses how schemes are run, how benefits are
structured, administered and how they are likely to develop in the
future.
''Managing the Pensions Revolution'', price #16.99, from Nicholas
Brealey Publishing, 21 Bloomsbury Way, London WC1A 2TH. Tel. 0171 430

* In November 1989, I invested in two back-to-back PEPs, costing #7800
plus commission and VAT of #448 (total #8248). Since the purchase I have
taken no income. The value of the plan at April 5, 1995, is #10,400.
Would you advise please if the capital value is reasonable in all the
circumstances or should I realise the capital for reinvestment
elsewhere. The investment split was 60% equities and 40% in income unit
trusts.
* It is difficult to get excited about the performance of your PEP.
Even if one ignores the 5.75% on-cost for commission, your gain after
more than five years is only 33[1/3]%.
Over the same period the FTSE-100 share index rose by 36%. But you
have foregone any income for five years. Taking account of this your PEP
would seem to have substantially underperformed the market.
The period has not been a good one for equity investments since the
markets have had to cope with the recession, the Gulf crisis, and
latterly the damaging effect of rising interest rates (on both sides of
the Atlantic).
Nonetheless your PEP has not served you well. PEPs offer a valuable
tax shelter from capital gains tax and income tax on dividends, but it
is important that the funds are invested so as to achieve a good return.
There is no reason why you should hold on to this investment any
longer. You have given it plenty of time to perform. You may be able to
switch to another PEP if you know of one which would serve you better.
Alternatively you could simply dispose of the PEPs and reinvest the
funds elsewhere.
* I am about to retire, have a company pension of #54 per week and a
proposed state pension of #70. The outstanding mortgage on my home is
#23,000 and the house is worth #80,000. Mortgage repayments are #250 a
month which includes insurance.
I have a TESSA with the Royal Bank which matures next January worth
#8000 with bonus, National Savings 5th issue savings bonds maturing this
July worth about #6300, 1000 ScottishPower shares and around #2000 in
Royal Bank's Gold Account.
I have insufficient income to pay the mortgage, yet do not want to
sell the house. Should I pay the mortgage repayments out of savings or
repay some of the mortgage out of capital? What should I do with what's
left?
* If you have a with-profits endowment policy in place to repay the
mortgage on maturity it would be worth investigating what its surrender
value is.
If it has been going some time, with luck when combined with some of
the capital you have it may worth enough to repay the loan entirely. If
the policy has been going 10 years or so it may realise more by being
sold through one of the specialist dealers in second-hand endowment
policies, rather than surrendered.
Otherwise it would certainly be worth using the ScottishPower shares
and the Savings Bonds to reduce the mortgage by about #10,000. You must
keep the TESSA going until maturity to receive the tax benefit. When
this occurs you can invest the money for income in National Savings'
Pensioners Bond for example.
* It is likely that I will have to change jobs shortly and I would
like to know the procedures which are necessary so that my monthly tax
deductions don't suddenly increase. This happened to me before and it
took months for my tax coding to be sorted out and the excess tax
repaid. In particular, should I notify the tax office of the change and
what can I do if there is difficulty or delay in receiving my P45?
* When you leave your present job your employer should give you two
copies of the form P45 and send one copy to the Inland Revenue. It
should not therefore be necessary to inform the tax office yourself. The
P45 shows your total pay and tax in the tax year up to the date of
leaving and the PAYE code number in use. You pass on the form to your
new employer so that tax can continue to be deducted on the correct
basis.
If you cannot produce the P45 your new employer will ask you to
complete a form P46 which asks for confirmation that you have not
claimed unemployment benefit and that this is your only employment. This
form is sent to the Revenue who will, in due course, issue correct PAYE
coding instructions to your new employer and in the meantime you will be
allocated a code number based on the basic personal tax allowance. This
presumably is what happened when you previously changed jobs and it is
therefore preferable for you to obtain the form P45.
* I purchased an amount of 2% index-linked Treasury stock 1996 in July
1987, repayable on September 16 of next year. According to a recent
financial newspaper the current price is #207 29/32; does this mean that
each nominal amount of #100 of stock purchased is now worth this amount?
If not can you advise me on interpretation please? Should I now be
considering a sale?
* Currently around #210, the price of the stock will be uprated
according to inflation between now and maturity plus accrued interest,
so something over #220 is likely. This is indeed the amount per #100
nominal of stock you will receive. Having held the stock this far it
would be sensible to hold on until redemption.
* I have holdings in most of the main privatisation companies --
British Telecom, British Gas, British Airways, BAA, TSB, ScottishPower
and Hydro-Electric, of course, plus a couple of English water companies,
and National Power. When opportunities have risen I have added to these
investments, which are now worth over #25,000, substantially more than
my cash outlay. My wife is due to receive an unexpected inheritance of
about $120,000 from a relative who lived most of his life in the US. We
are in our mid-fifties with good pensionable salaries, our children are
married, and the mortgage will be repaid next year.
We would like this inheritance to be used to build up our nest egg,
but are not quite sure what to do as the sum is large. We have bought
shares through a share shop, but never had occasion to use a
stockbroker. What would you advise?
* Once your wife's dollar inheritance is aggregated your investment
funds will amount to about #100,000, a substantial enough figure to
merit a broadly-based equity portfolio.
Most of your existing investments are in sectors where prospects are
somewhat dimmed by the intervention of regulators. So even if you did
not have a substantial additional sum at your disposal it would have
been appropriate to consider a diversification of your portfolio.
In any event your privatisation issues are representative of sectors
where the State once held sway -- transport, gas, electricity, water and
telephones. Large areas of industry and finance are not included, not to
mention the stores sector with such top performers as Marks &amp; Spencer
and Sainsbury.
We think you should consult a stockbroker. If you have had none
reliably recommended to you a list of Scottish stockbrokers can be
obtained from the Stock Exchange in Glasgow.
It is possible that you will be advised to reduce your dependency on
privatisation stocks even after taking account of the fresh funds you
have available.
Your total funds are sufficient for a portfolio of, say, 20 shares
representing a broad cross-section of market sectors.
You should also be considering some investment trusts for the quality
of their fund management and their exposure to overseas markets. You
could also consider having some of your money in PEPs, but if you go
down this route make sure that you do so for investment reasons, not
just the tax advantages.
Judging by the mailbag here too many PEP investors are sold pups. Your
stockbroker should be able to guide you on this, or you could plump for
an investment trust PEP.
* In 1978 we started a low-cost endowment mortgage with UK Provident
for #13,000 over 25 years. I have borrowed against the policy #4000 and
#5000 and pay interest of #90 a month on the combined loans. In the near
future I may be in a position to repay the loans and wondered if you
could give me advice on this. Should I repay the loans and hope by the
year 2003 the endowment policy will give me a reasonably large lump sum?
* You are paying 12% on the loans and it would make no sense for them
to remain in place once you are in a position to repay them. Based on
past performance you can expect to receive some #40,000 when your policy
matures.
* Two years ago I took out two savings policies, one with Scottish
Friendly and one with Scottish Widows, both over 10 years. I decided to
terminate these contracts early and instead of surrendering these
policies I decided to ask for them to be paid up as I had paid two
years' premiums.
Scottish Friendly Assurance has made the policy paid up with
endorsements to reduce the sum assured and to stop entitlement to
participate in profits. However, Scottish Widows will not allow this
unless I am 13 months behind with premiums and then a forfeiture
procedure is invoked, depending on the value at the date of the claim.
Can you advise if I was right to make the Scottish Friendly policy
paid up instead of surrendering? Should I surrender the Scottish Widows
one or take my chance with the forfeiture procedure?
I believe there is a market for endowment policies which are still in
force. However, these policies are small, #20 a month with Scottish
Widows, split unto four for flexibility at #5 per month each.
* By the time expenses are deducted from the value of the policies,
which happens if they are surrendered or made paid up, the amount
involved will be so small that you may as well surrender them both.
There is certainly no point in maintaining the Scottish Friendly
policy if it reverts to non-profits status. As for the ways of selling
an endowment policy rather than surrendering these only work when the
policy has been in force for a number of years and acquired a value of
several thousands of pounds.
* I follow with interest the advice you give on income tax, capital
gains tax, etc, and have a question of my own which concerns the council
tax which your experts may also be able to answer. There has been in my
area a substantial increase this year and rather than do nothing about
it, I would like to challenge the banding of my property. I have always
had the niggling doubt that the band was too high but I have never made
an appeal. Is it possible to do this
and under what circum-
stances can a property be
revalued?
* Properties will normally only be revalued when they are sold, even
if they have been substantially improved or extended. There is, however,
provision for adjusting values downwards at any time if there is a major
change in your area such as a motorway being built nearby or if the
property has been adapted for someone who is disabled.
It is also possible to have values corrected where mistakes took place
when the original list of property valuations was compiled.
You will have to lodge an appeal against the valuation and provide
evidence in support of your contention that the initial valuation was
too high. It will therefore be necessary to provide independent
valuations of our own property and similar properties in your area.
Details of how to make the appeal are given in the notice which you
received with the council tax assessment.

THE English word ''sampler'' was derived from the French
''exemplaire'' in the late Middle Ages and it meant a model or pattern
to be copied, because at that time amateur needlework was becoming a
craze with women who had sufficient leisure to pursue a hobby.
The original samplers were made by adult women, and it was only later
that the stylised sampler, as we know it today, was produced by female
children as part of their education.
When samplers were first made, they were patterns for needlewomen to
follow, and these long strips of linen bearing carefully executed
designs and motifs were much valued. They were bequeathed in wills;
royal households listed their samplers just as they would list their
books, and from inventories we know that Joanna the Mad, Queen of Spain,
owned 50 samplers in 1509, while half a century later the household of
King Edward VI of England boasted a dozen. Some early Scottish examples
of those ''sampler'' patterns can be seen at Traquair House near Peebles
and it is said that they were worked by Mary Queen of Scots and her
ladies.
Around the end of the sixteenth century printed needlework pattern
books began to appear and by the mid-seventeenth century the function of
samplers had altered. Instead of being strips of different patterns to
inspire skilled needlewomen, they took on a look of a page out of a
school exercise book, carefully filled in with rows of patterns and
often bearing the name and age of the person who made them. They had
become an educative tool and by the mid-seventeenth century the sewing
of a sampler was an established part of a girl's school curriculum. They
continued to fulfil that function until the end of the nineteenth
century.
On June 29, Phillips, the auctioneers in Edinburgh's George Street,
are selling an interesting collection of 75 samplers which have been
brought together over the past 20 years by a man living in Fife. When he
bought his first samplers, he would rarely have to pay more than #20 for
a good example and time has proved that he picked a wise way of
investing his money because today even his most pedestrian samplers are
expected to make around #150 and some of the more unusual ones will go
into four figures.
Samplers were made in most European countries but the ones in
Phillips's sale come from Denmark, Portugal, England, and Scotland and
they date from the heyday of the sampler, the 1730s to the late 1850s.
As with so many things that appear in auction sales, condition is of
paramount importance when assessing the value of a sampler and the ones
that have survived best are those that were framed and glazed by their
proud makers or their parents.
Collectors will pay more for a sampler that bears the name and age of
the girl who made it, along with the date of its execution. Sometimes
samplers turn up in which the child's tell-tale age has been carefully
picked out -- or even changed -- by ladies who wanted to keep their true
ages secret.
The simplest of these child-made samplers are really only rows of
letters and numbers, painstakingly executed in different types of
embroidery stitches, but others have pictures of houses, gardens, or
animals -- in one example a fierce-looking crouching lion. Sometimes
religious slogans were incorporated in the design and one sampler in the
sale, made in 1859 by 11-year-old Mary Jane Rhodes of Spittalgate
School, carries a dolorous verse that starts: ''Though you have gone to
the grave, we shall not deplore thee . . .'' It is estimated at around
#150.
Samplers of similar types and patterns were made by children all over
the country and the collection includes several from Scotland. Margrat
Stewart, aged 13, made a sampler decorated with butterflies, birds,
trees, and flowers in 1737. Because it is of early date and in good
condition, framed and glazed, its estimated price is around #800.
In 1807 Jane Garvie of Montrose made a sampler in green, pink, and
brown silks showing a house, deer, birds, and flowers. In 1843 Christian
Hutchison of Macduff made her woollen sampler with designs of peacocks
and flowers sprays (estimates between #300 and #400, and around #500).
Peacocks appeared again in a sampler stitched with the words ''Janet
Mill sewed this sampler Kirkintilloch 1813''. (Between #500 and #600.)
At the end of the eighteenth century there was a vogue for samplers in
the shape of maps and one in the sale, stitched on white satin, shows
Scotland, with all the counties carefully named. These counties include
such long lost administrative areas as Haddingtonshire and Granton
(presumably, from its situation, a misspelling of Grantown).
Its maker decorated it with stitched ribbons and bows but only her
initials, J M -- and because of that its price is fairly low, around
#250.
The most expensive sampler in the sale is that one which is inscribed
with ''Sarah Wilson her Sampler Aged 14''. It is priced at around #1000
because of the attractiveness of the design which shows a manor house
and a garden with spot motifs of trees, birds, crowns, and garlands of
flowers, as well as a stitched prayer.
The samplers will be included in a sale of a collection of oak
furniture built up over many years by Mr Harvey Gill of Cumbria. Oak is
rising rapidly in price at the moment, by over 20% in the past year in
fact, so there is sure to be keen competition for the chairs, stools,
and tables which Mr Gill brought together.

* THE prices expected for the samplers pale into insignificance
against sums bid for a collection of works of art, including tapestries
and carpets, which Sotheby's auctioned in London on June 7, 8, and 9.
The story of this collection is as timely a warning as any of the
sampler-proverbs and prayers, however, because it was built up by a
self-made millionaire, Reginald Toms, and his wife Alice Mary, who ended
their lives in lonely seclusion in a chateau on the shores of Lake
Geneva.
Mr Toms, who was born in 1892 to a poor family in Leicester, amassed a
huge fortune by dealing in used army vehicles, running bus companies,
and buying and selling property. He and his wife, who was his secretary
when they married in 1933, led a peripatetic existence, living at
various times in England, Scotland, Switzerland, France, South Africa,
Monaco, Ireland, and finally Switzerland where they bought the Chateau
de Coinsoins overlooking Lake Geneva.
He died there in 1978, having become a recluse, living with his wife
in one room and eating their evening meal by the light of the
street-lamps outside.
Alice Mary lived on until 1993 and when she died it was revealed that
her husband had bequeathed their vast collection of art and antiques to
the Swiss Canton of Vaud.
The sale brought in almost #2m, surely a case of sending coals to
Newcastle.

IT'S more than a decade since the Tartan Army ventured south to take
on the Auld Enemy, but tonight at White Hart Lane that absence will end,
albeit in the sport of American Football, when Scottish Claymores play
out their final match of the 1995 World League season against London's
Monarchs.
Both have had a poor year -- London dropping out of World Bowl
contention with a 17-7 defeat in Amsterdam last weekend and the Scots
never really getting into contention.

What you have lived in you can still live with, reports Beverley Brown
ARTIST Shirlet Risdon began making pottery houses in 1980, initially
for friends and relatives in Yorkshire. When she moved to Ballantrae in
Ayrshire she started again, and business has since mushroomed.
That's because a miniature reproduction of your own property captures
it for posterity and tends to make an ideal gift or memento for anyone
about to move home.
Shirley visits each home first and then works directly from
photographs and sketches she makes or from photographs supplied, if the
house is beyond a 100-mile radius.
Each house is then faithfully reconstructed in white earthenware clay,
on a base resembling its immediate surroundings. After firing, the
building is painted and given three coats of sealant to protect the
colours.
Shirley has made miniatures of just about every conceivable style of
house. ''I have also undertaken several commissions for holiday homes,''
she says, ''but most tend to be from people who wish to remember a home
they live in, or had lived in for many years.
''Semi-detached houses are also in demand, but more often than not I'm
asked to make them detached.'' She adds with a chuckle: ''Perhaps some
homeowners want to remember their home but not their neighbours!''
* Prices range from #95. Telephone 0146 5831211 for details.

* IF YOU want to get away from it all, and have a pleasant time
communing with plants, you can do no better than visit the Royal Botanic
Garden in Edinburgh. It need not cost a penny, though donations are
welcome, especially in the magnificent plant house.
The garden extends to 32 hectares and is a major tourist attraction,
providing inspiration, relaxation and pleasure to visitors from all over
the world.
Many wonders of the plant kingdom are displayed in grounds that
include 11 plant houses, a world-famous rock garden, a peat and woodland
garden, herbaceous borders, an arboretum and an extensive rhododendron
collection.
In addition to its scenic beauty, the gardens at Inverleith Row are a
centre of education for the world. It has the largest collection of
botanical works in northern Britain in its library and a vast herbarium
of preserved plants.
The garden also carries out research into plants including fungi as
living organisms. Don't forget to take a notebook. Everything is clearly
labelled with its true botanical name.
A favourite spot is in the rock garden section, with its magnificent
collection of plants. If travelling from the west, remember that the
climate at Inverleith is quite a bit different, with a lower rainfall
and often balmy weather influenced by proximity to the Forth.
Remember also that it is because the gardens are so sheltered from the
east wind that plants bloom so much earlier and more proficiently than
in many gardens in the west.
In the plant houses, things really grow exotically and you see indoor
landscaping at its best. Whatever you do, don't forget a camera to
relive your visit later, and dream of summer on a cold winter's night.

IT was but a year ago that Edinburgh's Royal Botanic Garden and
Scottish Natural Heritage started a ''reinforcement programme'' for a
rare plant, the Sticky catchfly (Lychnis viscaria).
The earliest known British colony in Holyrood Park, Edinburgh, where
it was discovered in 1670, had been reduced to just three clumps and was
in danger of extinction.
The Garden aimed to reinforce the Holyrood population as part of its
Scottish Rare Plant Project and around 20 Lychnis specimens, carefully
propagated at the Garden from seed collected from Holyrood in 1993, were
planted at a specially selected site in the Park.
The work was carried out in collaboration with Historic Scotland,
which looks after Holyrood Park, and was supported by Scottish Natural
Heritage.
Now -- despite last year's very dry summer -- 70% of the plants have
become established and several have already grown to flowering size. Up
to 12 flowering stems have been produced by the most vigorous clumps.
These plants should provide enough seed to increase greatly the
chances of creating a self-sustaining population at this historic site.
The Scottish Rare Plant Project, launched in 1991, aims to protect the
rarest species of flowering plants -- ferns, bryophytes and lichens --
in the country. This involves monitoring their status and, where
necessary, initiating recovery programmes, as well as stimulating public
interest in the conservation of Scotland's flora and habitats.
Project officer Phil Lusby is giving priority to those species under
immediate threat, and those where reliable information is lacking.
Visitors to the Royal Botanic Garden at Inverleith can discover 28 of
Scotland's rare plants, including the Sticky catchfly, by following the
Scottish Rare Plant Trail. The trail leaflet is available at the
Botanics Shop, near the West Gate, Arboretum Place (price 30p).

* THIS is the time when things happen very quickly in the garden. Take
gooseberries, for example. One day their leaves are bright and
heathy-looking; the next, you find whole branches stripped.
The reason is the gooseberry sawfly -- little green caterpillars with
a voracious appetite. I have seen them strip a dozen bushes in three
days. The answer is to get spraying the moment you see damage. I have
been using Tumblebite, a spray you can mix with disease-controlling
Tumbleblight.
Deal first with the sawfly, then come along with a combined spray in a
few days. Something else needing instant action is training and trimming
of tomatoes. Once they get into full swing, they grow rapidly,
side-shoots forming all over the place. When you have what looks like a
double head in the plant, it's hard to know which is the leading shoot.
But it doesn't really matter. Just nip out one, if you want to grow on a
main stem system. You can't put off watering either. They gulp huge
quantities.
Weeds can gallop along too -- quickly engulfing vegetable seedlings
and hardy annuals, and cluttering up the land between shrubs. Hoes can
be fine, but there comes a time when you can't beat hands. There is
nothing quite as precise. Unless you are a hardy type, and have hands
like leather, it's best to wear gloves.
Another challenge is what to do with primroses and polyanthus in
bedding displays or containers. Don't chuck them out. Pop them in a
shady spot where they can grow happily for planting out again in autumn.
Bulbs such as tulips or hyacinths are worth saving too. After lifting,
store them in a dry shed or greenhouse to ripen and die back naturally.
This conserves their energy for next year's flowering.

* THE firm building China's biggest sports stadium in Shanghai at a
cost of up to $2.4bn said yesterday they needed foreign capital to
complete what is also planned as a multi-purpose commercial facility.
About 800 workers are working seven days a week to complete the
80,000-seat, covered stadium. Target date for completion is the end of
1996, with China's eighth national games due to be held in the stadium
in the autumn of 1997.

Two months into the season a tour of the garden can be enlightening
* THERE is no better time for taking stock of your garden than now,
when the season has been going nearly two months. What you have achieved
determines activity for the three or four months remaining.
Let's have a tour round the garden, and see whether you have things
right this year.
* Lawns -- Despite a tendency towards slab paving and containers,
lawns are still the major feature. Proof is the amount spent on
maintenance, with fertilisers, moss killers, weed killers and all the
machinery involved.
Lawns usually get a burst of enthusiasm in late April and May. If you
used slow-release fertiliser, lawns should be in good shape and of good
colour. Annual meadowgrass pollution does not help. Nor does the dreaded
rust. It is a dilemma -- what to do? If you feed the grass, this will
mean keeping it trimmed. I must say, I prefer that.
It is also time for war on weeds, be it daisy, creeping buttercup,
close growing pearlwort that looks like moss, speedwell with its small
blue flowers, or dandelions with their deep roots.
Yarrow with fernlike growth is another menace, and should not be
allowed to grow unchecked. To rid your lawn of weeds, use a suitable
weedkiller. You may need two or three applications.
* Roses and shrubs -- Roses should be shaping up nicely, with no sign
of blackspot, especially if you have been spraying regularly with
Systhane and then Roseclear. Standards should be sprayed as well.
Shrubs mainly look after themselves, apart from requiring some
trimming-back. Pests and diseases do attack them, however. Diseases such
as rust can be devastating on even lowly-flowering currant, and on holly
bushes.
Summer bedding -- Most had a good start, especially in the west. If
ground preparation or good compost is used for containers, I often
wonder whether supplementary feeding is required.
Still, all the best gardeners do it. The easy way is to use a liquid
feed such as Miracle-Gro, which can make a real difference. Use it in
the early morning, or in the cool of the evening.
* Fruits and vegetables -- I should be getting a ripe strawberry or
two within a fortnight. Followed by green gooseberries, swelling nicely
now. Then, raspberries and blackcurrants.
The last ones often clash with holidays, which can mean wastage,
unless you have relatives or friends to help themselves.
In the vegetable garden, there are spring onions, lettuce, radish and
spinach. Peas and beans are faring well. It won't be long for a first
pick of peas. I have a variety of cabbages, with ornamentals included.
Plus cauliflowers and calabrese. They all look frisky. You have to be
vigilant, with a good insecticide to keep cabbage caterpillar at bay.
The first meal will be with Arran Pilot potatoes, always beautifully
tasty boiled with mint. That reminds me, there are herbs such as chives,
rosemary and many others ready for the picking.
* Greenhouse -- All go here. Tomatoes are flowering and setting,
needing trimming, watering and feeding. Pot plants have to be watered
and fed. Possibly a vine needs trimming. It is no excuse to go off on
holiday either. Someone has to stand in, or all can be ruined.

* IF YOU ever needed reminding what a massive business gardening is,
an event like the Chelsea Flower Show will certainly do that for you.
Let's face it: Chelsea is all about prestige and getting your name in
front of the public, no matter what the cost. And that, increasingly,
seems to be no object. The expense of setting up many of this year's
stands and displays must have been truly astronomical.
I used to go regularly, but must admit I haven't been for a few years.
I find I can get around it better on television these days.
Another major show is Southport, which is a pleasant enough place to
visit and relatively easy to get to. Alas, it also seems to have become
very commercial in recent years.
A show I do go to regularly is the flower show section at the Royal
Highland. This should be a definite date for your diary. The dates to
remember are June 15-18.
I am told by the organisers that the flower show will be even bigger
and better this year. Stands will be nothing like as grandiose as at
Chelsea, but it is amazing the effort put in.
It is disappointing that so many displays are from firms south of the
border. Hopefully, more Scottish firms will decide it is worthwhile
exhibiting. There's a happy medium somewhere.

BRIAN Welsh and David Hannah, the latest big-name players to join the
want-away bandwagon, are facing showdown talks with Dundee United
manager Billy Kirkwood, who is furious that so many top players want out
of Tannadice following the club's relegation to the first division.
Last night Kirkwood said: ''The situation emerging since the end of
the season spells out for me exactly what has been going wrong at this
club for far too long.
''Too many players are simply only interested in doing things for
themselves and that amounts to cheating their team-mates, and supporters
who pay out good money.''

Restoring the elegance to that promising piece of junk is not so much
magic as hard work, writes JOHANNA HALL.
ONCE you've found that wonderful paint-encrusted piece of furniture in
the junk shop or auction room, the next step has to be what to do with
it to turn it into a family heirloom.
Unless you are a hardened DIY enthusiast, your first stop will
probably be a professional paint stripper. But what will they do to your
treasured items?
Colin Buist owns Safe Strip in Glasgow, which has three ways of
dealing with furniture. ''When a piece of furniture comes in we assess
the kind of wood it is, then we can decide the best way to actually
strip it,'' he says.
''There's the dipping tank where we put items in and submerge them, or
the flow-over system which is more for the likes of hardwoods, veneers
and marquetry, where a chemical is flowed over and breaks up the surface
of the paint.''
The third way is by hand-stripping, using lots of elbow grease and
rubbing. This is usually kept for more intricate items, and is of course
more expensive.
The chemicals used by Colin are biodegradable so environmentally
friendly. However, not all woods can be dipped. ''Oak, for example, if
you try to dip it, it will come out a purple colour, or maybe darker
oaks will come out a dark grey colour. So you have to be careful.
Certain mahoganies you can get away with it if you do it quickly, but we
are professionals and know what we are doing.''
Another one to look out for is black ash, as the process used to
produce it makes it very difficult to get rid of the black stain
completely.
It's the fashion just now to have internal doors taken back to the
natural wood, but does dipping doors warp them? According to Colin, this
is an old wife's tale.
''They don't because we are professionals,'' he says. ''Painters and
decorators have been using caustic for years. It's tried and tested,
though you have to know what you are doing. There are cowboys who will
fill a tank full of caustic and water, don't know what they are doing,
and leave it in for hours.
''Like anything left too long, it will open up and split or become
'hairy'.''
So, the rule would seem to be, check out the company you intend to use
first and make sure you have seen some of their work.
The cost of stripping varies depending on what process is used. The
small table in the picture cost #15 to strip using the flow-over system.
The bureau was #35 to strip and the total cost including staining and
polishing will be #80-#90.
The cost of dipping doors can get cheaper the more doors you have
dipped regardless of size (storm doors can be dearer). Safe Strip
charges #24 a door, dropping to #18 if you are having several done at
one time.
The cost of uplifting and delivery should be included but taking doors
down and rehanging can be an extra #2.50 a time. You might be able to
negotiate over this -- so ask.

THE look on Terry Venables' face said it all as he watched his side
fall behind Sweden at Elland Road the other night. The England manager
chewed his finger nails fearing the vegetable patch was waiting to claim
him, as it did his predecessor Graham Taylor.
Only 11 minutes were left to play at Leeds and the English were down
3-1 with chants of ''what a load of rubbish'' ringing around the
stadium.
However, Paul Gascoigne, introduced late in the game as a replacement
for John Barnes -- who flopped again -- gave Magnus Erlingmark a broken
nose, England's midfield a better balance, and then two goals in the
dying minutes earned them a draw.
Gascoigne, even though he may not be ready to cope with a full 90
minutes, must be used from the start in the show game of this
competition in which England tackle the Brazilians at Wembley tomorrow.
His darker side was under suspicion again, even though he said the
Swedish player's nose made contact with an elbow purely by chance. But
he makes things happen when he is on the ball.
Brazil have shown signs they are in the mood, and if they feel like
it, they could take a wobbly England defence apart and further upset a
manager who is feeling the strain.
''When was the last time Sweden conceded three goals?'' asked Venables
in response to questions about the defensive lapses which cost his side
three goals. ''They lost three in Cyprus in March,'' came the reply
which didn't do anything at all for the manager's mood.
''Belarus beat Holland and some people still think it is an excuse to
say there are no easy games,'' he said. ''We think we're the best in the
world, but the facts don't support that.
''We were never the best. We won the World Cup on our own territory,
and we always talk about Stanley Matthews and all those players. But we
never did anything then. It's an illusion.''
Steady Tel, steady boy. It's only a game, and the tabloids haven't
fitted you up yet with a suitable vegetable.
Venables has used 37 players in 10 starts, but he says Brazil have
made 44 changes since the World Cup. ''Nobody accuses them of thowing
caps around do they?'' he asked.
David Batty will be back for tomorrow's match and there might be a
place also for Steve McManaman or Jamie Redknapp.

Looking for sale pastures new? Liz Taylor offers her personal guide to
some of the most interesing auction rooms she has experienced
Some auction houses
listed here are
especially good for
selling, others for
buying; but unless
buying or selling
is stipulated, most
are good for both
* DUMFRIES -- Thomson, Roddick and Lawrie, 60 Whitesands, Dumfries.
Tel: 01387255366. They sell across the board and distribute the sales
between Dumfries, Carlisle and Annan where they also have salerooms.
Silver and jewellery and pictures are sold four times a year at
Carlisle. Specialist sales of items like guns or fishing tackle are sold
twice a year at Dumfries. Antiques and furniture are sold four times a
year at Dumfries and books, of which they have recently made a
speciality, are sold five or six times a year in Carlisle.
* EDINBURGH -- Lyon &amp; Turnbull, 52 George Street, Edinburgh. Tel
01312254627. Good for buying. Bargain-hunters are advised to attend the
three-times-a-week Lane sales held by this long-established saleroom
with a Victorian atmosphere. Everything from old books to Art Deco
mirrors are sold in the lane behind the George Street rooms on Tuesdays,
Wednesdays and Fridays, starting at 11am.
* EDINBURGH -- Phillips, 65 George Street. Tel: 01312252266. Regular
sales across the board with fortnightly 'Victorian' sales which are more
mixed and good for bargains. Good for selling, too, because at their
specialist sales they often fetch London prices and they sell
high-quality items in Scotland -- whereas other big auction houses often
ship them south to London.
* FALKIRK -- Central Auctions, Unit 4, Castle Crescent, Bankside
Industrial Estate, Falkirk. Tel: 01324623000. Started three years ago,
they hold regular weekly sales on Wednesday evenings and also special
events if they are given large consignments to sell.
* GLASGOW -- Kerr &amp; McAlister, Queen's Park Auction Rooms, 140 Niddrie
Road. Tel: 01414234271. Sales every Thursday at 6pm when the auctioneer
rattles through between 400 and 500 lots in three hours. They sell
across the board with pictures and antiques mixed in with household
effects. A good place for buying.
* GLASGOW -- Robert McTear &amp; Co, Royal Exchange Saleroom, 6 North
Court, St Vincent Place. Tel: 01412214456. General sales every Friday
with antique sales once a month.
* INVERNESS -- Fraser's Auctions, 8a Harbour Road. Tel: 01463232395.
Mixed sales held every Wednesday evening (6pm) and antiques every three
months.
* LADYBANK -- Ladybank Auctions, Kinloch Street. Tel: 01337830488.
Mixed furniture sales every Friday and periodical special antiques and
collectors' sales about every three months.
* LONDON -- Bonhams, Montpelier Square, Knightsbridge, London SW7.
Tel: 01713933930. Good for buying -- and for an entertaining excursion.
They have their own cafe. The most avant garde of the major London
auction houses without the formality of Sotheby's. They have often
pioneered sales of off-beat items like fountain pens and modern pottery.
* MONTROSE -- Taylor's Auction Rooms, 11 Panmure Road. Tel:
01674672775. Mixed sales every second Saturday, including antiques.
Occasionally one on a Friday.
* NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE -- Anderson and Garland, Marlborough House,
Marlborough Crescent, Newcastle. Tel: 01912326278. Excellent saleroom
with four day events every three months. On the first day they sell fine
art; on the second, silver and plate; on the third, china, books and
toys; and on the final day, rugs, carpets and furniture. They also have
a saleroom at Crawcrook, Ryton, outside Newcastle at which they sell
late Victorian and modern furniture and general household effects once a
fortnight, on a Thursday.
* PAISLEY -- Robert Paterson and Son, 9 Orchard Street. Tel:
01418892435. General auction sales once a fortnight and catalogue sales
for more special items every three months.
* PERTH -- Love's, 52-54 Canal Street. Tel: 0173863337. A household
sale every Friday with special antiques sales three times a year and
collectors' sales (fishing rods, etc) twice a year.
* ST BOSWELLS -- Mainstreet Trading, Main Street. Tel: 01835823978.
Fairly new auction house run by an energetic young woman. It has mixed
sales about every six weeks and has made a speciality of selling
architectural items.
* TWEEDMOUTH -- The Auction Galleries, Mount Road. Tel: 01289307569.
Good for buying because the items being sold often come from clearances
of big houses in and around Berwick upon Tweed.

* THE wonderful thing about auctions is the people you meet. Have you
noticed it's always those dressed like train-spotters, in waxed jackets
and scuffed shoes, who snap up the expensive lots? The Armanis and the
Guccis waver and fall out when the bidding reaches the auctioneer's
lower estimate.
At a recent auction of ''Furniture, Pictures, Objects of Art, Sporting
Equipment etc'' I found myself competing with a Gucci. We were bidding
for a nasty ''Portrait head of Hypnos, bronze, on a spreading marble
socle -- #350-#450''. When bidding reached #350 we dropped out, and the
thing was snapped up by a waxed jacket for #620. At a break between
sessions, we found ourselves commiserating with each other.
She told me she was a Mrs Ethel Zimmerwoman of Lanarkshire. ''Who was
Hypnos anyway?'' she asked. ''The god of hypnotism?''
I suggested that, considering the price it fetched, it must have been
the god of hype. She asked me why I wanted it, and I gave her my card --
Disneyland Professor of Bad Taste at the University of Camelon. ''How
fascinating,'' she said. ''May I write to you?''
When the Zimmerwoman letter came, I discovered she was asking for some
assurances on the way she had redecorated her small Georgian country
villa, set in 10 acres. She sent me photographs showing how she had
developed an interior decor strategy, using linked shades of violent
puce and bilious yellow, and carrying a ''Greek god'' theme through all
the rooms.
This involved hanging prints of naked Greek gods on the walls and
placing statuettes of Greek gods -- in ceramic, bronze and plastic -- on
every horizontal surface.
Then she invited some friends to dinner (goat's-milk cheese salad,
incidentally, a bad move) and awaited their reaction. To her alarm, they
said the effect was ''love-ly'', with that pause between the two
syllables indicating that they thought it quite horrible.
I receive letters like this all the time. I am a kind of social
worker. You would be surprised to learn how many people with money to
spend are unable to distinguish between good taste and bad. I could see
that Mrs Zimmerwoman's statuettes, for example, were of ''limited
editions'', and she assumed that this guaranteed their location in the
upper-taste bracket.
I wrote back saying her taste was crap. The fact that I dictated the
letter after a good lunch is neither here nor there, although I do admit
that a bottle or two of retsina gave me access to some striking examples
of hyperbole.
Later I was summoned by the Principal. He said: ''Does the name
Zimmerwoman not ring a bell? Don't you realise that it was the late
Ephraim Zimmerwoman who endowed your Chair of Bad Taste? And that he
made his fortune through limited edition Greek god prints and
statuettes?'' Oh dear.
''Never mind,'' said the Principal, ''I have purchased something for
your department's Black Museum.''
To my astonishment he produced the bust of Hypnos. ''Only #1500,'' he
crowed, ''from a chap in a waxed jacket and scuffed shoes.''
''Well done,'' I said, with as much conviction as I could muster.

Saleroom species: observed by LIZ TAYLOR (words) and BOB DEWAR
(drawings)
* THE AUCTIONEER: Some auctioneers sell livestock one day and
furniture the next. They dress like well-off farmers and their customers
value them for the speed with which they conduct an auction, rattling
away like machinegun fire.
The gentlemen who sell in big auction houses, however, have a more
relaxed delivery and deliberately adopt the appearance of pirates in
pin-stripe suiting. They speak with cut-glass accents, sport flowers in
their buttonholes, and preside from the rostrum with supreme
condescension.
Favoured customers, the big spenders, are recognised from on high by
these god-like gentlemen who entertain their audiences by making 'in'
jokes, or condescending to innocents who have wandered into the saleroom
by mistake. They are omnipotent because they can ignore an eager bidder,
shame a slow one, or summon bids out of the ether.
If they hadn't taken up auctioneering they would have made good actors
or bank robbers. If one of them disappears from the scene, the saleroom
clientele wonders if he might be doing time.
* THE MALE DEALER: He often looks like a gypsy horsedealer. He is
totally indifferent to sartorial elegance, wearing a dirty two-tone
windcheater, unpressed trousers and an open necked shirt which is
stretched tight over a generous beer belly. He chain smokes, smells of
stale beer, and tends to hang out in a group at the saleroom door with
other men who look exactly like himself.
No one ever sees any of them making bids for they communicate with the
auctioneer by minute twitching and winking. Though he may overlook the
wildly waved catalogue of an amateur buyer, the auctioneer never misses
one of the secret signals of a professional. He knows how to watch his
back.
A professional doesn't bother about things like cheque books or bank
cards. He pays for his purchase by peeling off dirty notes from a huge
wad that he produces from his back pocket.
After the sale the professionals tend to group together and have
another little auction of their own at which even bigger wads are
flourished. The auction houses turn a blind eye to this bizarre
behaviour.
* THE FEMALE DEALER: She becomes very much deadlier than the male when
she enters the arena of the saleroom. She is usually dressed in passe
hippy style and makes her first impact at the pre-sale viewing when she
minutely examines every lot, rearranging things in mixed boxes to her
own satisfaction so that something she covets is well hidden from other
viewers.
At the sale she takes up a prominent seat, and if the auctioneer
affects not to see her bid, she is not above alerting him to it with a
sharp expletive and he doesn't do that again.
Anyone who becomes engaged in a bidding battle with one of these
formidable women should realise that the best tactic is to back out as
soon as possible, because she'll fight tooth and nail all the way until
she has driven you up to well beyond what the item is worth, and then
back out, leaving you with it -- just to teach you a lesson.
These ladies are often accompanied by depressed and
emasculated-looking men who load their numerous purchases onto the roof
racks of battered Volvos and do the driving for them.
* THE SNOB BUYER: The habitat of the snob buyer is the stately home
auction. She and her friends throng to the pre-sale viewing, to which
they have been sent invitation cards by the astute auction house, and
tour the exhibits giving little shrieks of delight and noting lot
numbers in their catalogues.
On sale day, they usually arrive in pairs, armed with shooting sticks
and occasionally pet dogs. They talk loudly through the proceedings,
interrupting their flow of gossip to ask one of their neighbours ''Which
lot number is he at now?''
They are usually interested in buying several items, but the prices
which the more desirable items fetch leave them gasping. By the time the
sale is nearing its end they become so desperate to acquire something
that belonged to dear Lord So-and-So that they start bidding wildly and
end up paying a hundred pounds for a battered bedpan.
Auctioneers love snob buyers. The more exalted the title of the person
whose artefacts are being auctioned, the more snob buyers turn up and
the wilder prices they are prepared to pay.

ATHLETICS:
A DREAM debut in ultra distance racing has presented Commonwealth
marathon internationalist, Lynn Harding, with a unique dilemma.
Harding, Scottish marathon record holder before Liz McColgan, vowed
that her run for Britain in the European 100 kilometres championship
would be a one-off, before taking up the challenge of cycling.
But having finished runner-up for the European individual title,
leading Britain to team silver, she has been offered a UK World
Championship place for Holland in September.
''It is a difficult decision,'' says Harding. ''It sounds unpatriotic,
but having made the Commonwealth Games in the marathon, I wanted to try
for selection as a cyclist.
''Training for the marathon has caused me to have knee surgery once --
who knows what racing double that distance, then another 10 miles, will
do?''
Harding, a 33-year-old accountant, from Milngavie, clocked 7hr 52min
23sec, 10 minutes outside Trudi Thomson's Scottish record, on her first
attempt, in France a fortnight ago. ''At two-thirds distance, or two
days later, I'd definitely have said 'never again'. But the after
effects have been less than following a marathon. It's not as painful,
but you ache in more places.
''Now, I am having second thoughts, though my parents are anxious
about the damage I may be doing to my health by prolonged years of
endurance running. I'll decide within two weeks.''
Willie Sichel, an Orkney farmer who makes a living harvesting fur from
Angora rabbits, is on the fringe of the six-strong British team --
ranked seventh male in the UK. Sichel, from Sanda, is using a #500 grant
from the Orkney Isles Council, to travel as an individual to the world
event, but could yet be elevated to the team proper.
* WEST district 5000 metres champion Chris Robison (IBM Spango Valley)
and former champion Robert Quinn (Kilbarchan) are the sole Scots
entrants for the AAA of England 10,000m championship tomorrow at
Loughborough. The event is the UK trial for the World Championships.
Seven Scots are in the UK under-20 team which competes against the
AAA, Loughborough, and UK student select. Hugh Kerr appears to have been
harshly treated, chosen only for the relay, yet England's Steven McHardy
who has not run as fast as the Scot this year, gets an individual place.
The other Scots selected are:
Des Roache (1500m), Ross Baillie (110m hurdles), Bruce Robb (shot),
Sinead Dudgeon (200m), Lorraine Bell (400m), and Alison Curbishley (400m
hurdles). Phil Mowbray (3000m) and Doug Walker (200m) are in the Student
Select.
Old fixture,
new sport
AMERICAN FOOTBALL
IT'S more than a decade since the Tartan Army ventured south to take
on the Auld Enemy, but tonight at White Hart Lane that absence will end,
albeit in the sport of American Football, when Scottish Claymores play
out their final match of the 1995 World League season against London's
Monarchs.
Both have had a poor year -- London dropping out of World Bowl
contention with a 17-7 defeat in Amsterdam last weekend and the Scots
never really getting into contention.

CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY
Peter Hunt, editor
Oxford University Press, #22.50
IT IS probably foolish to generalise about such a complex genre as
children's literature, but Peter Hunt rushes to judgment in his
anthology of essays on the subject. Children's literature, he asserts by
way of introduction, is not innocent entertainment ''because children's
books can never be free of didacticism or adult ideological freight''.
This helps set the tone for a book that invokes Freud's theory of
infantile sexuality and refers to the comical Wonder Woman as
''surprisingly feminist''.
Writing of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865),
Julia Briggs and Dennis Butts nudge the reader towards an erotic
interpretation of the story. Carroll, they write, was ''obsessively
interested in little girls'' and so he was, though it is simplistic to
suppose he created a classic to express an unhealthy obsession. However,
the essayists suggest Alice's encounters in Wonderland ''may reflect
Carroll's own search for greater intimacy with the object of his
desire''. In fact Carroll arranged his fiction to entertain a
lexicographer's daughter with his extraordinary verbal virtuosity.
Writing of Barrie's Peter Pan (1904), Briggs breaks into academic
jargon in an attempt to turn a marvellous character into a crude
caricature: ''His relationship with Wendy is not without sexual
undertones . . . and his anomalous nature generally works to justify a
militant posturing and a sexual evasiveness that the text simultaneously
invites us to judge and admire''. Peter Pan has more to do with
mortality than morality and Briggs's reading insults the intelligence of
Barrie who knew exactly what he was doing in dramatically outdoing the
''awfully big adventure'' of death.
Ironically, since so many theories abound in this book, children's
literature evolved inventively as a way of escaping from the theoretical
demands of adults. Escapism is routinely condemned as irresponsible by
responsible critics yet J R R Tolkien, one of the finest writers of
children's fiction, rejected the negative connotations attached to
escapism and praised, with reference, to the desire to escape the
awfully big adventure of death, ''the genuine escapist, or (I would say)
fugitive spirit''.
Educational texts were often used as instruments of torture on
children whereas imaginative books allowed children to escape, if only
for a while, from the oppressive atmosphere of the schoolroom. Rousseau,
advancing humane ideas of education in Emile (1762), encouraged children
to escape with Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (published for adults in 1719 but
rapidly reprinted in versions for children): ''Let (the child) think he
is Robinson himself; let him see himself clad in skins wearing a tall
cap, a great cutlass, all the grotesque get-up of Robinson Crusoe . .
.'' Later, children learned to escape with Long John Silver in
Stevenson's Treasure Island (1883) and with Peter Pan.
In Hunt's book Long John Silver is seen as ''a moral enigma'',
Stevenson as a man who used the adventure story as an ''instrument for
asking serious questions''. I doubt if Stevenson wanted his readers to
ask serious questions about Silver's motives. He wanted his readers to
escape with Silver as he dreams his dreams: ''Why, it makes me young
again . . . It's a pleasant thing to be young, and have 10 toes, and you
may lay to that. When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask
old John, and he'll put up a snack for you to take along.'' Stevenson
wanted young folk to have fun.
The relentlessly earnest approach of Hunt's anthology is illuminating
when applied to such notoriously politically incorrect authors as
Kipling with his jungle law and order, his Anglo-Saxon platitudes. But
then Kipling hoped to impose an ideology on his readers and thus
betrayed the escapist tradition as he admitted in his autobiography
Something of Myself (1937): ''The tales had to be read by children,
before people realised that they were meant for grown-ups.''
Kipling continued an older tradition that treated children as
creatures who had to be taught a lesson. An excellent essay by Gillian
Avery shows how children were regarded as little monsters by moralists
intent on instruction. Roger Ascham's The Schoolmaster (1570) deplored
disobedience, Thomas Lye's New Spelling-Book (1677) recommended the rod.
Margaret Kinnell's essay argues that children's literature was
liberated by the introduction of entertaining fairy-tales into English.
Robert Samber translated the tales of Charles Perrault as Mother Goose
(1729) and these enchanted children anxious to escape from the authority
of merciless moralists. Two traditions -- the moralist and the escapist
-- have competed for the attention of children. Given the choice,
children usually choose flights of fantasy rather than mental fights
with supposedly improving literature.
Considering contemporary children's literature, Tony Watkins and Zena
Sutherland affirm the triumph of the escapist tradition. Children have
warmed to Raymond Briggs's The Snowman (1978), in which the snowman
defies the gravity associated with adults; have gone along with The
Jolly Postman (1986) as he delivers letters designed by Janet and Allan
Ahlberg. Watkins and Sutherland are critical of Roald Dahl -- finding
his attitude to adults ''repellent'' in The Twits (1980) -- but there
they make a moralistic judgment on an accomplished escapist.
Comprising an introduction, 12 chapters and more than 200
illustrations, this is an ambitious survey of an engaging topic. Some of
the essays are irritatingly grim, some gratifyingly informative. We
would expect no less when adults trespass on territory that writers have
reserved for children. Ultimately there is no escape from the awfully
big adventure, but children should kid on while they have the chance.

But learn the rules before showing your hand, says Kennedy Wilson
FOR SOME people, auction rooms and their unspoken rules can be
unwelcoming places, not at all like the image they have from TV and
films. But once the few simple rules of the auction house have been
deciphered, bidding for prize objects can be exciting as well as
profitable.
Thanks to TV shows like The Great Antiques Race and The Antiques
Roadshow, auction sales are more popular than ever. They are great
places to pick up bargains in everything from cutlery to furniture, and
they provide the fantasy for many people of picking up something for a
song which turns out to be very valuable.
Such objects, it has to be admitted, are pretty far and few between.
There's an adrenalin high to be had from the risks involved in auctions
-- you might buy a piece that's a fake or you might miss getting it
because of another, more determined bidder (probably a dealer).
''Saleroom fever'' can seriously damage your wealth, however. The trick
is to know when to stop bidding.
First, you have to master the skills of bidding. For the novice it can
be unnerving and intimidating, especially when you are bidding for
something you really want. One way to develop your auction room
technique is to practise.
Attend as many auctions as you can and watch how others do it. Try
bidding for pieces that start at only a few pounds but don't get caught
up in the excitement -- set yourself a strict budget and don't go over
your limit.
It is best to sit near the front where you can get a good look at each
lot and are close to the auctioneer. Make sure your bid is clearly seen
by the auctioneer. The best way is simply to raise your hand clearly,
and avoid making small gestures that are open to misinterpretation.
When bidding, keep eye contact with the auctioneer and be sure he
knows you are interested and not just a bystander. If your worst
nightmare comes true and you find that you have just bought something
you cannot afford, without intending to, inform the auctioneer
immediately.
It pays to express indifference at an auction. If you suddenly appear
alert and eager when the lot you are interested in comes up, others will
see that you are keen and may decide to join the bidding, thus forcing
up the price. Auctions do, therefore, call on some of the skills
required by the successful poker player.
Attend the sale's preview where you will be able to get a good look at
what's on offer. If you don't do this you will be in the awkward
position for a newcomer of having to make a quick decision whether to
bid for something at a moment's notice.
Saleroom tips
* If you're buying for an investment, buy the best quality you can
afford.
* Be aware that there is usually a buyer's premium at sales (normally
between 12% and 15%) which is added to the cost of whatever you buy.
* Read up and do your homework so that you're not conned by fakes or
lookalikes.
* Attend as many sales as you can and observe.
* At salerooms try to get a feel of prices and who is buying.
* Feel free to handle antiques -- pull out drawers, examine the
underside of things for marks.
* Don't be scared to be the first to bid -- often an early bid gets
the bargain. But don't buy just because it's a bargain -- buy things you
like.

<TEXT>
ENGLAND are hanging on by their fingertips at Headingley -- saved, for
now, from a horrible fall by new fast bowler Peter Martin and comeback
spinner Richard Illingworth.
The pair limited the damage after West Indies had threatened to gallop
into an unassailable position on the second day of the opening Test.But
despite their best efforts, England are once again in grave danger of
losing the first match of a series.
It all looked so easy for West Indies as Brian Lara, Sherwin Campbell
and Jimmy Adams compiled half-centuries after Ian Bishop had sent the
home team crashing to 199 all out with a five-wicket return in his first
Test for two years. But, mercifully for England, not one of them was
able to convert innings of real menace into three-figure masterpieces.
At 236 for five, West Indies already have their noses in front. They
could, however, have been out of sight by the close.
Devon Malcolm had Carl Hooper caught at slip off the first ball of the
innings. But with Lara, in particular, shattering his confidence, the
fast bowler was given only seven overs -- and they cost 48 runs.
For Gough, injury quickly followed insult. Dismissed for a first-ball
duck, the young paceman laboured through three overs for 23 runs before
returning to the pavilion for treatment on a back problem.
Lara, careering to 50 off only 40 deliveries with the help of 10
boundaries, looked set for something truly spectacular. But just when
Mike Atherton desperately needed someone to halt the flow, Illingworth
-- a controversial selection -- came to his aid by having the
left-hander caught at slip by Graeme Hick.
Campbell fell to a superb piece of work in the field, run out by an
inch or two as Phillip DeFreitas picked up and threw down the stumps
from mid-on.Then Martin dived full length at deep backward square leg to
remove Adams off Hick's bowling before trapping Richie Richardson lbw
for nought.
Thanks mainly to Illingworth and Martin, who between them went for
only two runs an over, England could tonight still dream of staging a
fight-back.

TENNIS: FRENCH OPEN
AMERICAN Michael Chang, back on centre court at Roland Garros where he
became a teenage sensation six years ago, ended Sergi Bruguera's reign
as king of clay with victory in yesterday's French Open semi-finals.
Chang, who won the tournament in 1989 at the age of 17, beat the
Spaniard who had been champion in Paris in each of the past two years
6-4, 7-6, 7-6 to set up a meeting with Austrian Thomas Muster in
tomorrow's final.
Fifth seed Muster had earlier disposed of Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov,
trouncing him 6-4, 6-0, 6-4 in less than 90 minutes.
Chang, the retriever supreme of tennis, proved too steady for
Bruguera, whose season has been disrupted by injury.
Bruguera fluffed his chance to come back into the match after he broke
to lead 5-4 in the third set. He was broken back straight away, losing
vital points on two drop shots which went out, and surrendered tamely in
the end as he lost 7-0 in the eventual tie-break.
The tennis was not the sort to bring the Roland Garros crowd to their
feet. Heavy top-spin from both sides made it a match which could
virtually have been played without a net as the ball rarely passed
within a yard of the cord.
Bruguera said his lack of physical preparation for the tournament
because of a knee injury earlier this year had seriously hampered him.
''I lacked resistance and my legs didn't work well enough,'' he said.
''I was tired and I wasn't thinking well towards the end. It's difficult
to play someone like Michael Chang.''
But Bruguera predicted Chang would get little change from Muster in
the final. ''I think Muster will win in three sets,'' he said. ''He hits
much harder and wins many more points. He's better on clay and he does
everything better.''
Chang, who had not reached a Grand Slam final since his stunning upset
in 1989, was undaunted by Bruguera's prediction of the final or the fact
he has never beaten Muster, who swamped him last month in Rome. ''It's a
new day and a new place. Paris is Paris and Rome is Rome. I feel great
about playing Thomas in the final,'' said Chang.
''I thought today was a very tough match, even though it was in three
sets. When you play Sergi on clay you expect a lot of long, tough points
and that was the case today.''
Muster, the first Austrian to reach a Grand Slam final, stretched his
unbeaten run on clay to 34 matches with his demolition of the hapless
21-year-old Russian, seeded ninth.
The Austrian has won the five previous clay tournaments he has entered
this season and can now become the first player since Romania's Ilie
Nastase in 1973 to win the three major slow surface events of the year
-- Monte Carlo, Rome, and the French Open.

* AUCTION rooms produce plenty of amusement, apart from the thrill of
the auctioneer's gavel crashing down, writes WENDY JACK . . .
Aidan Hetherington, head of furniture and an associate director of
Phillip's in Scotland, recalls the embarrassing moment when an
immaculately-dressed woman attending a glass sale, turned a decanter
upside down to examine it. Unfortunately, no-one -- including the woman
-- had noticed that it was full to the brim with vodka or gin, and she
was completely drenched.
''It happened in the full glare of everyone during a sale, which was
slightly embarrassing for all,'' he recalls with a rueful smile. It was
probably even more embarrassing as she tried to explain to the family
that never a drop had passed her lips, despite the aroma.
On another occasion, Phillip's was selling an oak bedding chest. On
arrival in the sale room, it was opened -- to reveal a skeleton.
Inquiries revealed, however, that both it and the chest had belonged to
a medical professor -- so, metaphorically speaking, despite first
impressions, there were no skeletons in his cupboard.
Tact and discretion are clearly all-important in this business,
Oriental sales being a case in point. ''Oriental prints can be quite
explicit, Kama Sutra and all that,'' confides Hetherington. ''They don't
go on general display.''
Presumably there are people who collect them? ''Oh yes, but they tend
to bid anonymously!''
Even cataloguing can be a minefield despite best attempts to
proof-read carefully.
''Once, I catalogued a lowboy which came out as an eighteenth-century
cowboy,'' confesses Hetherington, adding: ''That took a bit of
explaining.''

GRAND PRIX
DAMON Hill was facing another struggle as Michael Schumacher
maintained his Formula One stranglehold at the Canadian Grand Prix
yesterday.
Hill had to settle for second best as the German -- five points ahead
of him in the drivers' standings -- grabbed provisional pole position
for tomorrow's race. Any hopes Hill harbours of redressing the balance
in today's final qualifying session could be wrecked with forecasts
predicting rain which will make posting quicker times virtually
impossible.
Hill, who had spun during his free practice, came out for first
qualifying and quickly set the fastest lap in his Williams Renault, only
to soon see Schumacher, then Ferrari's Gerhard Berger, surpass it.
The 34-year-old managed a quicker time of 1min 28.039sec to grab
second place back from Berger, but was still four-tenths down on his
chief championship rival.
Williams team-mate David Coulthard had to settle for fifth place
behind Berger and Frenchman Jean Alesi in the other Ferrari. The
Scottish driver was just under a second slower than Schumacher.
Hill, who is suffering with a cold, said: ''It's no more than a
satisfactory start. I had a bit of a fight to get the balance with the
car -- it was a bit tricky.''
Team-mate Coulthard, who was fifth in Canada last year, said: ''I'm
not as confident now as I was coming here. This was a circuit I knew and
I was hoping to go faster. We are using a new chassis for the first
time, so perhaps it just needs time to bed everything in.'' But I
thought I would be closer.'' Provisional qualifying times:
1, M Schumacher (Germany) Benetton 1min 27.661sec; 2, D Hill (Britain)
Williams 1:28.039; 3, G Berger (Austria) Ferrari 1:28.247; 4, J Alesi
(France) Ferrari 1:28.525; 5, D Coulthard (Britain) Williams 1:28.590;
6, E Irvine (Britain) Jordan 1:29.021; 7, J Herbert (Britain) Benetton
1:29.295.
Others included: 11, M Blundell (Britain) McLaren 1:30.279; 15, M
Brundle (Britain) Ligier 1:30.880.
* TEAM boss Ron Dennis last night dismissed rumours that McLaren were
about to dump Mark Blundell as the long-term successor to Nigel Mansell.
Blundell was given two races to prove himself when he took over from
Mansell just days before the Monaco Grand Prix a fortnight ago where he
finished fifth. But the 29-year-old has been met with speculation that
McLaren were targeting Germany's Sauber Ford driver Heinz-Harald
Frentzen.

THERE will be no second thoughts from Andrew Gavin Hastings. He
confirmed yesterday that, win or lose against the All Blacks, he will
retire from the international stage which he has graced with such
breathtaking vigour for nine years when this Rugby World Cup is over.
Typically buoyant on the eve of what could be his last game for
Scotland, he refuses to contemplate the thought that tomorrow at the
Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, he might be pulling on that
Thistle-adorned dark blue jersey for the final time.
An arch exponent of the power of positive thought, Hastings much
prefers to believe that he has three games to go -- the quarter-final
against New Zealand, then the semi-final, and then the final curtain at
Ellis Park, Johannesburg, in a fortnight's time.
Who is to say that he is not right. He told me on the Friday night
before Scotland played France at Parc des Princes in February that they
would win, and he meant it. That spirit of eternal optimism -- sometimes
misplaced, but never cynically manipulative or uttered just for form's
sake -- has served as Hastings' guardian angel and as a guiding light
through the dark days.
Weaker characters than him would have folded during those dark days of
nine games without a win, the crushing disappointment of the semi-final
penalty miss against England in the 1991 Rugby World Cup semi-finals,
the last second Jon Callard penalty goal against the Auld Enemy last
year which reduced him to tears, and the shell-shock of defeat by France
last weekend. But he has come through it all unscathed.
Yesterday, and again typically, he preferred to dwell on the high
points. The Lions series win against Australia in 1989, the 1990 Grand
Slam, and this season's memorable first win in Paris for 26 years
offered more than adequate compensation for the low points.
''I'm being asked about the game against the All Blacks being,
potentially, my last game for Scotland, but that isn't the way I'm
looking at it. We are gearing up for the biggest game in the history of
Scottish rugby and that's all that concerns me.''
Hastings believes that beating the All Blacks -- and for Scotland it
would be a historic first -- is mostly about mental preparation. ''We're
geared up to overcome the mental thing about the New Zealanders. If you
include Lions' appearances, then I've played against the All Blacks more
than any other side. I've beaten them with a World XV, but never with
Scotland.
''This Scotland side has overcome a lot of challenges this season. We
won in Paris when nobody gave us a chance and, so far as I am concerned,
there is absolutely no reason why we can't rise to that kind of
challenge again tomorrow.''
Hastings diminishes the role which he has played in the renaissance of
Scotish rugby this season. ''Nobody tells you how to captain a side.
Everything that I do comes from within. It's the way I am.''
Irrespective of what happens against New Zealand tomorrow, for
Hastings to take his curtain-call on the world stage is the perfect
farewell.
''The World Cup is huge. I love the big time and, rivalled only by
Lions' tours, this is about as big-time as you can get.''
Scottish captains each bring their own standards and style to the
position. Some are respected but not loved by the players they lead.
Hastings has both.

BERNHARD Langer defied a cold and sore throat to take a four-shot lead
at the Deutsche Bank Open in Hamburg yesterday. He shot a six-under-par
66 to go with his opening 67 and looks set to gain a second successive
tour victory, having won the Volvo PGA championship two weeks ago.
Kent golfer Jamie Spence lies second on 137 after a 69 with Sam
Torrance (67) and Italian Costantino Rocca (70) both on 138 -- on a day
when Colin Montgomerie (69) missed a 15-inch putt on the last green to
finish on 141.
The hard luck story of the day concerned Ryder Cup player Peter Baker,
who after 12 holes was leading at six under par, only to finish with
five bogeys in his last six holes. But he did have some excuse.
Having bogeyed two holes running, Baker threw his putter back to his
bag, hitting a hard edge. The putter bent in the middle of the shaft and
became illegal. So the 27-year-old putted with a sand wedge and then a
No.3 iron.
Torrance said he owed his 67 to father Bob, who gave him a few lessons
last week. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
133 -- B Langer (Germany) 67 66
137 -- J Spence 68, 69.
138 -- C Rocca (Italy) 68, 70; S Torrance 71, 67.

Ames (Trinidad) 70, 69; M Litton 71, 68.

Marchbank 79, 72. Withdrawn D Robertson.
* DAVIS Love shot a course record-equalling eight-under-par 63 to
vault into the lead after the second round at the $1.4m Kemper Open in
Washington yesterday. He recorded one eagle, nine birdies, six pars, one
bogey, and a double-bogey in a ''wild'' performance on the Avenel TPC
course.
He also posted a tournament record low halfway score of 11-under 131
to head fellow American Scott Hoch by two strokes.
The highlight of his round was an eagle at the par-4 fifteenth, where
he holed a pitching wedge from 155 yards.
Seve Ballesteros bogeyed the final hole to miss the cut by a stroke.
Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
131 -- D Love 68, 63.
133 -- S Hoch 68, 65.

Hoylake
GORDON Sherry, of Barassie, yesterday became the first player since
Peter McEvoy in 1978 to reach successive finals of the Amateur
Championship. However, the difference between the two achievements is
that whereas McEvoy won the title on both occasions Sherry last year
lost to Lee James.
As soon as Sherry, who is 21, had won his first match he declared:
''There's only one thing on my mind an that's to go one step further
than last time.'' At Hoylake in today's 36 hole final, the last obstacle
in the way of that objective is Moseley's Michael Reynard, aged 33, and
a professional for six years, who is the current Worcestershire
champion.
In the semi-final round Sherry, probably the class striker in the
field, carried too many weapons for the inexperienced but resolute
20-year-old Roger Beames, now based in Wick but a fellow Ayrshire man.
He won solidly by 4 and 2 whereas Reynard, three down with four holes to
play, won all of them to beat Irish internationalist Jody Fanagan.
Sherry, 6ft 8ins and 18 stone, was disposed to marvel at his
changeable fortunes. In his four previous games he had played 71 holes
and had never been ahead at the turn. In his quarter-final match he was
three down with six to play against English internationalist David
Howell ''and suddenly I'm in the final again,'' the Stirling University
student remarked.
Sherry ultimately escaped by pitching to 12 feet for a 3 at the last,
but against Beames, with whom he shared digs on Thursday night and who
described his own record as having ''won everything in Caithness'' he
was never under pressure once he had chipped dead to halve the first and
won the second with an unexpected birdie concession.
To give a putt of more than two feet was quixotic indeed and Beames,
who had shown admirable composure in defeating James in the fourth
round, was remorsely ground down in the boisterous wind. Now Sherry
faces something of a psychological battle as well as a contest of
stamina and shot-making against Reynard.
Since the last championship, Sherry has been runner-up four more
times. His loss to James deprived him of places in the Open Championship
and the US Masters and to Stephen Gallacher for the European title again
a place in the Open.
''It's important for me to win this'' Sherry said, ''and I'm more
relaxed and playing better since I passed by bio-chemistry exams.''
If Beames exceeded his wildest expectations, so Reynard could hardly
believe the nature of his survival.
Fanagan, a member of Irish teams for the past six years, seemed to
have Reynard, who twice tried and failed to qualify for the European
Tour, at his mercy when he won the fourteenth instead of losing it, as
had seemed likely.
But by playing the last four holes in one under par and being assisted
by some ragged shots from Fanagan, Reynard came through by pitching from
rough to 18 feet at the last and holing for a birdie 3 and the match.
QUARTER-FINALS
M Reynard (Moseley) beat M Searle (Lyme Regis), 3 and 2; J Fanagan
(Milltown) beat M Wheelhouse (New Zealand), 2 and 1; R Beames (Wick)
beat L James (Broadstone), 1 hole; G Sherry (Kilmarnock Barassie) beat D
Howell (Broome Manor), 1 hole.
SEMI-FINALS
Sherry beat Beames, 4 and 2; Reynard beat Fanagan, 1 hole.

Scotland Under-21 1, South Korea Under-21 0
DAVID Hannah snatched an injury time winner to take Scotland through
to the last-four stage of the Toulon tournament yesterday.
With the South Koreans reduced to nine men after a cynical display,
the Scots got the victory they deserved in Brignoles. Now they face the
boys from Brazil in the semi-finals on Monday after France eliminated
Mexico.
The goal came just when it seemed that all the Scots' efforts would
end in frustration after a night of provocation.
Doug Freedman and Andy Liddell made the opening on the right for
Hannah to fire the ball home from 10 yards.
Scotland manager Tommy Craig blasted the Koreans' brutal tactics. ''I
am delighted we will meet a real football side like Brazil in the
semi-finals,'' he said.
''It was a very difficult night and I must stress this was not of our
doing. Our discipline was exemplary.
''It speaks volumes for the discipline of my players that they were
able to keep their cool. This is something which we always preach and I
was proud of every one of them.
''It was no classic but that was not our fault. We didn't have a
player booked.''
''We found it difficult as can happen when we were up against 10, and
then nine men. But the players stuck to their task and came up with the
inspiration needed for the winner.''
The Koreans also had six players booked in a night which shamed this
event.
Scotland were well served by Dundee United's Christian Dailly, who was
outstanding defensively and in supporting his attack.
It was down to him that the pacy Koreans were unable to inflict fatal
damage with their counter-attacking strategy.
Scotland created the first scoring chance after 26 minutes when Andy
Liddell found Hannah, but he blazed the ball over. Then a 30-yard free
kick from Dailly was just off target.
It seemed the tie was drifting from the Scots when a lob by Freedman,
the find of the tournament for Scotland, drifted inches over the bar,
and Korea came close with two swiftly-mounted attacks.
Korea had midfielder Hong red-carded in 60 minutes for a second
booking and that was the signal for their temperament to crack. But the
Scots failed to rise to the provocation and persevered with their task.
With Steve Crawford and Brian McLaughlin on to increase their
attacking options, Scotland came close on several occasions before that
priceless late strike.
Scotland -- Stillie (Aberdeen), Jupp (Fulham), Pressley (Coventry),
Dailly (Dundee Utd), Gray (Celtic), O'Neill (Clyde), Hannah (Dundee
Utd), Fullarton (St Mirren), Glass (Aberdeen), Freedman (Barnet),
Liddell (Barnsley).
Referee -- M Fernanzes (Angola).

EVIAN MASTERS
LAURA Davies fashioned a brilliant late charge to come home in 32 for
a 69 and a 12-under-par total of 204, extending her overnight lead to
three shots in the American Express Evian Masters in France yesterday.
Davies' two-stroke lead was erased when she tangled with the trees to
run up a double-bogey 6 at the first hole, and Catrin Nilsmark later
birdied the fourth and fifth to move two ahead.
But Davies birdied the long ninth to be out in 37. Nilsmark bogeyed
the tenth and Davies moved two clear with birdies at the thirteenth and
fourteenth.
At the sixteenth and seventeenth, the latter from sand, Davies
salvaged par with the aid of single putts, then reduced the 447-yard,
par-5 last hole to a drive, a No.6-iron, and a 10-yard putt for an eagle
3. Leading third-round scores (British and Irish unless stated):

THE history books say that Scotland can't do it. The wiseacres say the
Scots don't stand a chance.
Gavin Hastings and the entire Scotland team don't agree. But on one
point there is absolutely no debate.
If the Scots are not to be on the plane back home to Blighty on Monday
then, over 80 minutes at Loftus Versfeld tomorrow, they must all play
the game of their lives.
Scotland have played New Zealand 17 times since the inaugural match
between the two countries exactly 90 years ago. The best the Scots have
done is to draw twice, in 1964 and 1983. Historical precedent is ranged
against them but, as Henry Ford -- who admittedly knew more about
selling automobiles than he did about the strengths of Kiwi rugby --
said, all history is bunk.
If there was any justice in this world, then Scotland would not be
playing New Zealand tomorrow at all. If they had beaten France last
weekend, they would have been on duty against Ireland today in Durban.
But they didn't and they aren't, and with the luxury of seven days in
which to reflect on that defeat by the Tricolours, they have only
themselves to blame.
But hopefully the lessons have been learned. Tomorrow, New Zealand
will play the same solid, clinical game that they always play. Nothing
fancy, just hard, serious rugby from kick-off to no-side. They will make
a few mistakes, every side does, and if Scotland do not capitalise on
those errors and turn their own scoring opportunities into points, then
they will sink without trace.
Scotland manager Duncan Paterson acknowledged as much when he said:
''We should have beaten France and the players know that. There has to
be better decision-making, and we must take every chance that comes our
way.''
But even more than that, the correct options must be taken and
openings turned into points throughout the 80 minutes. Sean Fitzpatrick
and his men will play relentless rugby.
The Scottish selectors have given a vote of confidence to those
players who turned out against France. Or have they? The entire team and
the replacements have been re-selected en bloc, but there is little
doubt that had the selectors been blessed with what they considered to
be fresh powder in the ammo store -- most of them are injured and still
at home -- then there is little doubt that there would have been
changes.
Craig Chalmers, for the first time this season, did not have a good
game against France. His decision-making was poor and he was put off his
usually confident stroke by encroaching, and generally off-side French
flankers and inside backs. There is no reason to believe that he won't
be faced by a similar set of circumstances tomorrow. But he is
experienced enough to overcome that.
In terms of options, an alternative to Chalmers, there were none. He
is a better fly-half than Graham Shiel and, in any case, his Melrose
clubmate is on duty at inside centre.
One wonders, too, about the re-selection of Damian Cronin. He has
served the Scottish cause well since his recall in January, but he has
had little rugby since the muscle tear suffered against France the
following month and by the end against the Frenchmen last weekend he
looked a yard or two off the pace.
Cronin is much the more experienced campaigner, and that will count
for a lot against the All Blacks, but there was surely a case to be made
for partnering the inestimable Doddie Weir -- whose lineout contest with
the similarly built Ian Jones will be fascinating -- with that young
workhorse, Stewart Campbell.
But the centre partnership is the one area where the selectors have
been spoiled for choice, and where they have gone for safety first.
Scott Hastings, Tony Stanger, Ian Jardine and Shiel were the
possibilities and it was a case of perming any two from four.
They have gone for Hastings and Shiel. There is some latitude for
quibbling here. Shiel will play his usual cultured game, and Hastings
will tackle until the the wildebeest come home. He has his detractors,
but I am not one of them. However Scotland will not beat the All Blacks
by playing a kick-and-chase game.
Within reason, there will have to be risks taken. Starting with
Redpath and Chalmers and right through Shiel and Hastings Jr, the
primary objective must be, when appropriate, to bring Kenny Logan and
Craig Joiner into the game.
It will be interesting to see how Jonah Lomu and Marc Ellis cope with
wingers running at them. Lomu, in particular, did not look too
comfortable in this regard against Ireland.
The last time that Scotland played the All Blacks, at Murrayfield in
the winter of 1993, the Scottish side stood back in awe and lay down --
if ever such a thing was possible -- and the result was a 51-15
humiliation. That won't happen tomorrow.
Kiwi campaign manager Brian Lochore said the Scottish game represented
a mountain to climb. Paterson said it was a tough assignment. Both are
right, but the scaling of Lochore's mountain and Paterson's assignment
will be made so much the easier if Gavin Hastings can coax just a few
more games from those tired old limbs. All Black prop Richard Loe, for
one, is guaranteed to concede the odd penalty or three. Hastings must
spear them home.
One final thought. In the information pack issued to the world's
media, the New Zealanders provide details of their 1995 fixtures. They
include the RWC semi-final next weekend in Cape Town and the final the
week after that in Johannesburg. Self-belief? Arrogance?
Tomorrow, Scotland have the chance to prove the doubters -- and the
printers -- wrong!

LET'S face it. The real difficulty when playing the All Blacks is that
you know that if you are anywhere near the ball on the ground, then you
are going to get your little self stomped upon quite vigorously.
They ruck well, then their back play gets them over the line, as we
show in the sketch on the right.
I remember reading an old book by a one-time Wellington coach, Ivan
Vodanovich, who described how members of the great Kiwi packs leaned
forward as they ran ''as if running into a gale-force wind,'' and the
beauty of any New Zealand team is that they have their fundamental body
position right where it matters, and that is up front.
They have their ''spines in line,'' each one parallel with the
touchline, and they get their feet over that ball on the ground,
aggressively but controlled, down low in the drive, and to heck with the
consequences.
Man and body come rolling out the back and, to me, it's one of the
finest sights in the world, and a lot more attractive than a scantily
clad Pamela Anderson on Rothesay beach.
Other sides may have rucking as a last resort, but New Zealanders have
it as a core. It's their way of testing you, it's their way of
proclaiming their manhood. It's special.
Then what they do to stick points on you is to move the ball somewhere
else on the pitch, probably from a different source of possession, and
outflank, or outthink you.
If you've watched the All Blacks recently, you'll see that much of
their lineout possession has been ''off the top'' and straight to the
backs. They may drive the ball against Scotland to tie in our back row,
but they have not, so far, and it's likely that they will persist in
using rapid possession and thinking.
The wonderful thing about lineout ball delivered quickly is that what
a team can set up is the one and only situation in rugby where the
handling team can hit the gain line before the defence.
The defence has to be back 10 paces and the attacking team will run
faster to the gain line than the defenders. Bingo, over the gain line.
Unlike the Australians, the New Zealanders keep it simple, but they
like attacking to the right because passing left to right is more
difficult and the defence is not as used to coping with it, and
defenders are forced to tackle with their left shoulders which is not as
natural for right-sided people.
Much of what they do, as the diagram shows, revolves around a ''miss
one'' from the stand-off straight to Frank Bunce, the bigger of the two
centres, but an exquisite passer of the ball nevertheless, and that
immediately asks questions of the Scottish defence.
Given that the New Zealand left winger will be nosing in somewhere in
the attacking line, then does Craig Chalmers immediately call for a
''drift defence,'' so that each Scottish defender takes the man outside
him, or not?
By this time, the New Zealanders will be close to the gain line, well
into danger territory, and the Scots need to think about dropping All
Blacks in the tackle or be in trouble. The wrong commitment, and all is
lost.
If Chalmers stays in on his man, then so must every Scottish defender
and so the next New Zealand pass, from Bunce to the full back, will
leave an All Black running in space, and the inside centre, who will
loop Bunce, will be available to support as well.
Heck, it isn't that technical, but it can be devastating if it is
worked out well. The Scots then have to run to their left and try to
edge the All Blacks on to the touch line, the ''sixteenth'' defender.
He'll call a drift and trust his back row.
There are loads of options after tidy and quick ball from the lineout,
not least the up and under, but the All Blacks will use that intruding
winger coming from the blind side just to spread panic into the hearts
and minds of Craig Chalmers, his back row, and his centres.
If Chalmers drifts the first time they use the move, then the
stand-off may cut inside or bring in the blind side winger the next time
it is set up. Or they will bring the full back between the centres, or
there will be no ''miss one,'' or there will be a switch with the inside
centre getting the ball and Bunce going for the crash.
My favourite story about New Zealand backs' moves is that they used to
have one called Shimla, because after Tuigamala had got the ball the
results he left in his wake looked Shimla, in Maori speak, to those left
after a road traffic accident.
Defence will be the key, no doubt, in a severe test of mettle.
Oh, and spare a thought for Eric Peters, the No.8, who will take the
field with freshly given instructions ringing in his ears. ''And
remember,'' he will have been told, like every No.8 has been since time
started, ''everything coming back inside is yours!''
''For at least 50% of a rugby match, the opposition has possession. If
Scotland can tackle and defend, they can win. If not, then they lose.

IAIN Morrison, the London Scottish flanker, has said that he intends
to retire after the World Cup. Morrison, 32, wins his fifteenth cap
against the All Blacks tomorrow having been a late arrival on the
international scene, playing his first game for Scotland against Ireland
in 1992.
The Heriot's FP hooker Kenny Milne is another Scot who may be on the
brink of retirement. Despite his claim 36 hours ago that he would take
time to consider his international future once the World Cup was over,
and that it was something that he would have to talk over with his wife,
Milne is reported as saying that he would hang up his boots on return
from South Africa.

RICHARD Gough ordered the catch of the day, and it happened to be
barracuda, not bad for a bit of a swift mover himself. We sat in the
Sportsman's Cafe in Cape Town's waterfront complex, inside, as winter
has finally arrived in paradise. The skies were sending down buckets of
warm winter rain and Table Mountain was obscured from view.
Rangers captain Gough spends this part of the year in South Africa
with his wife Fiona and young son Michael in comparative anonymity,
visiting his mother in Cape Town, and that has let him follow his second
love, the game he played at school in Johannesburg -- rugby.
He was once a fly-half himself was Gough. ''Rugby was compulsory at
school,'' he said. ''I tell you, when the French won that game last
week, I cried my eyes out. I couldn't believe it. I felt so sorry for
Gavin Hastings' boys.
''I thought they had done so well until that point. I knew they would,
too. They must have grown in confidence being able to put points past
the poorer teams, because just like football, it's hard to keep the
points rattling up.''
I was pinching myself here. A football bloke keen on rugby? And one
who knew the rules as well.
''I watch all of the games, and I've watched them all so far out
here,'' he said as if by way of explanation. ''The only thing I find it
hard to keep up with are the rule changes. I like rugby. The Scottish
team looks so fit, Gavin Hastings especially, which they will have to be
if they are to beat the All Blacks.''
Gough is from the hard school of professional football, an intelligent
man in a sport not famed for its average IQ level, and he draws
enlightened parallels between rugby as it will be, and football as it is
now.
''When the South African tourists were in Scotland, I went to see
them,'' he said. ''I took some of them to Ibrox to show them our set-up,
but interestingly, I was asked by Francois Pienaar to try to guide him
and his team through the kind of problems they will have to face when
the game does become professional. And it will, quite obviously. I don't
know if that is a good thing, but it will happen.''
Gough's advice to Pienaar ranged from the logistics of achieving a
portion of sponsorship money for the players to the maximisation of
players' income. ''I helped him all I could,'' said Gough. ''Rugby union
is a far more attractive game than rugby league, and it will have to go
professional to stop the boys going to league, which is just a waste of
players.''
It will have been interesting for a man like Gough to look at the
World Cup, which is still a tournament that lets the great and the good
take many a point off the lesser teams. That doesn't happen as often in
football. Look at the Costa Rica and Peru results.
''It is very difficult for supposedly good teams to beat other sides
easily in football,'' he said.
The difference between rugby and football in a physical sense came to
Gough when he spoke to Andre Joubert when he was in Scotland. Joubert
and Gough are both around 6ft 1in, but whereas Gough is spot on 12st in
weight, Joubert is well over 15st, and while Gough can bench press his
own weight, some of the South Africans bench press three times their's.
It is, up to a point, a futile exercise to compare both too closely as
Joubert could not play for Rangers and Gough could not play top class
rugby, but it gives an indication of the bulking up needed for the
modern rugby game.
''All I'll say on the matter is that steroids are easily available
here in South Africa,'' says Gough. ''We all hear the stories.''
Today, Gough will be glued to the set, and he has been invited to go
to one of the executive boxes at Newlands, here in Cape Town, tomorrow
to watch the English play the Aussies.
At three o'clock tomorrow, South African time, Scotland play New
Zealand. ''There will be a quiet corner in Newlands and that's where
I'll be if I can't get back to my mum's in time to watch,'' he says.
''If they lose, I'll find it hard to take. It really means a lot to
me.''
We said goodbye. The barracuda had been demolished and his family,
including his mum, had arrived to keep the great man amused and they
dragged him out into the torrential rain.
I'm sure we all share his sentiments. Nice, clever bloke is Richard
Gough. A sad loss to rugby, I'm sure.

WE ARE just 24 hours away from the biggest rugby challenge that
Scotland have ever faced.
We've never beaten the All Blacks, but what better time to do it than
now. We are as well prepared as we will ever be -- the French game is
out of our systems and we relish the challenge ahead.
The Kiwi wing, Jonah Lomu, has been the talk of the town but now we
will see how good he really is. We have a suspicion that he won't look
nearly so good going back in defence as he does coming forward with the
ball in hand.
He's picked to play on the left wing but we wouldn't be at all
surprised to see him chopping and changing, even as the game goes on.
The New Zealanders themselves have doubts about his defence and that's
why they dropped him after the French Tests last year.
They moved him to the right wing against Wales because they were windy
about what Ieuan Evans might do to him.
If he comes on to my wing with the ball in his hands, then one thing
is for sure. He's a big lad, and the first tackle will have to count.
I'm going to have to go in so low and so hard that I'll be cutting the
grass!
We're desperate to remain in this World Cup and we know that we can't
hide from sides like New Zealand. If we want to be the best then we've
got to beat the best, and that means that at some stage we would, in any
case, have come up against the Kiwis, South Africa, Australia, and even
England.
The added incentive for us is that, in addition to Gavin, quite a
number of the management team are calling it quits after the World Cup.
The manager Dunky Paterson, coach Dougie Morgan, and the doc, Donald
Macleod, are all bowing out. We want to win for them so they can all end
on a high note.
Yesterday we had training in the morning, with a visit to a prison
complex at Leeuwkop, near Johannesburg, in the afternoon. I can just
seen the headlines now -- Scotland go to jail. However, the fact that
they have an excellent golfcourse in the grounds -- for the warders, not
the inmates -- meant that we could get in a few holes and it was an
enjoyable afternoon out.
There's a farm on the complex, too, so I was able to keep my hand in
at the day job. When we left, the coaches offered to swop me for a
couple of the inmates, but the offer was refused. The guards said they
had their hands full as it was, and they didn't need to go looking for
any more trouble than was absolutely necessary.

SCOTLAND plan to finish their four-match tour of Zimbabwe with a 100%
record today when they play the second Test at the Police Ground in
Harare.
Coach David Johnston said it has been a two-week education process.
''We have learned a lot about each other, about the opposition, and
about the different playing conditions here.''
Hugh Campbell, the forwards coach, cautioned that the tourists must
exert control up front. But much will depend on referee Marty Wild, who,
last Saturday, twice cautioned Scotland forwards for stamping.
The Scots will expect him to curb the Zimbabweans' tendency to get on
the wrong side of the ball.

RACECOURSE form and pedigree lines confirm Pennekamp's claims as firm
favourite for this afternoon's Epsom Derby.
Unbeaten in six starts he swooped in the final furlong to take the
2000 Guineas from Celtic Swing, who franked the form in the French Derby
last weekend.
The strong finish Pennekamp showed at Newmarket suggests he will get
the extra trip, and he pleased his trainer, Andre Fabre, with a
racecourse gallop over 10 furlongs on Monday, leaving his pacemakers
well behind.
Punters who like value rather than safety should go for Munwar, who is
a good each-way prospect at attractive odds.
He confirmed his ability to win over this trip in the Derby Trial at
Lingfield, which is similar in layout to Epsom, and on a line through
Flemensfirth and Celtic Swing, should get close to Pennekamp.
The French challenge for the Coronation Cup also is of the highest
quality, but Luca Cumani's Only Royale is preferred.
Since her debut win at Edinburgh, the selection has established
herself as one of the top mares in Europe, getting to within three
lengths of the Arc de Triomphe winner in each of the last two seasons.
She has twice run away with the Yorkshire Oaks, beating User Friendly
in the 1993 race.
Tikkanen set a course record when winning the Breeders Cup Turf in the
United States in November, but was just beaten by Only Royale at
Newmarket recently and may again have to settle for second place.
Green Perfume is the outstanding horse in the Vodacom Stakes.
He pulled hard and ran out of steam in the 2000 Guineas but he
finished last season only a length behind Pennekamp in the Dewhurst
Stakes over today's trip and is worth another chance.
Jawaal can take Haydock's John of Gaunt Stakes and complete a hat
trick following wins at Ascot and Yorkshire.
Branston Abby and Moccasin Run may find their stamina exposed by this
extended seven furlongs.
Lady Herries can make it a double with Gloriana in the second race on
the card. A promising juvenile, she caught the eye with a battling
second at Salisbury and can lose her maiden tag here.

WORLD CUP ROUND-UP
IT IS make-or-break time for Will Carling's England team as they
prepare to do battle with the Australian giants of rugby in tomorrow's
quarter-final in Cape Town.
If they win they will have a semi-final, against New Zealand or
Scotland, back in Cape Town to contemplate.
Manager Jack Rowell said: ''We have got our feet under the table of
the World Cup and we intend to stay at the table. This is the biggest
match I have prepared a team for, and we have planned only how to win.''
England have become the best team in Europe, with three Grand Slams,
and have victories over New Zealand and South Africa in recent years.
But they have never beaten Australia outside of Twickenham.
But Rowell is aware of the interest and support back in England and
said: ''There is a huge fascination about the outcome of this game
because people have been wondering about the relative strength of
southern and northern hemisphere team.
''Our simple aim is to make our talent count on the field on Sunday.''
Teams:
England: M J Catt (Bath); T Underwood (Leicester), W D C Carling
(Harlequins), J C Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); C R Andrew
(Wasps), C D Morris (Orrell); J Leonard (Harlequins), B C Moore
(Harlequins), V E Ubogu (Bath), M O Johnson (Leicester), M C Bayfield
(Northampton), T A K Rodber (Northampton), D Richards (Leicester), B B
Clarke (Bath). Replacements -- J E B Callard (Bath), P R de Glanville
(Bath), K P P Bracken (Bristol), G C Rowntree (Leicester), R G R Dawe
(Bath), S O Ojomoh (Bath).
Australia: M Burke; D Smith, J Little, T Horan, D Campese; M Lynagh, G
Gregan; D Crowley, P Kearns, E McKenzie, R McCall, J Eales, D Wilson, W
Ofahengaue, T Gavin.
* NICK Popplewell has warned France that Ireland's forwards intend to
''hit them hard'' in today's quarter-final.
And giant lock Neil Francis, another man of great experience in the
Irish pack, has told French hard man Olivier Merle not to try to meet
fire with anything underhand.
British Lions prop Popplewell believes the first 20 minutes will be
the key and said Ireland would start with the same fervour that has
already rocked both New Zealand and Wales.
It promises to be a shuddering clash and English referee Ed Morrison
will have to be alert if tempers are raised.
Ireland:C O'Shea (Lansdowne); D O'Mahony (University College, Dublin),
B Mullin (Blackrock College), J Bell (Ballymena), S Geoghegan (Bath); E
Elwood (Lansdowne), N Hogan (Terenure College); N Popplewell (Wasps), T
Kingston (Dolphin, capt), G Halpin (London Irish), G Fulcher (Cork
Constitution), N Francis (Old Belvedere), D Corkery (Cork Constitution),
D McBride (Malone), P Johns (Dungannon). Replacements: P Danaher
(Garryowen), P Burke (Cork Constitution), M Bradley (Cork Constitution),
E Halvey (Shannon), P Wallace (Blackrock College), S Byrne (Blackrock
College).
* EXTRA time, try counts, disciplinary records, or even the toss of a
coin could be used to determine winners of this weekend's quarter-finals
should any end in a draw.
According to competition rules, 10 minutes of extra time each way will
be played at the end of drawn games. Should that not produce a winner,
the outcome will be determined by the number of tries each team have
scored in the game.
Next, the team which has had fewer players ordered off throughout the
tournament will win. A toss of the coin between the managers is the last
resort at tie-breaking.
* SOUTH Africa have their sights firmly set on success, not style, as
they attempt to overcome Western Samoa in Johannesburg today.
The Springboks' credentials as one of the tournament's favourites were
established with a superb display in an emphatic 60-8 victory over the
Pacific Islanders at Ellis Park in April.
But since that defeat, the Samoans have performed impressively in
beating Argentina and Italy and running England close in their Pool B
games.
* IVORY Coast winger Max Brito, who damaged his spinal cord in the
match against Tonga last Saturday and is now paralysed, will receive all
the proceeds from today's World Cup phone-in competition on ITV.
ITV hope to raise thousands of pounds for the 27-year-old player, who
is married with two children.
The competition line is 0891 900090 and the winner will receive an
all-expenses-paid trip to the World Cup final on Saturday, June 24, in
Johannesburg.

* STAN Mellor, at home in Swindon suffering from flu, missed the
sunshine at Perth yesterday on the second day of summer jumping,
however, the trainer had the consolation of completing a short-priced
double with Bone Setter (6-4) and Storm Falcon (4-5).
In so doing Mellor maintained his 100% record at the Scone Palace
track this year.
In April he had a success with Seod Rioga at the three-day Spring
Festival, and on Thursday night Mellor had another with Frankus.
Continuing the good work yesterday in the opening race, Bone Setter
took it up after the first and went on to beat Rachel's Owen by 11
lengths. In the next, Strong Falcon hit the front at the fourth and kept
on to beat Linden's Lotto by 15 lengths.

MOONSHELL and a glowing Frankie Dettori outshone their rivals at Epsom
yesterday to maintain a Maktoum family domination of the Oaks.
They defeated Dance A Dream by a length and a quarter, with Pure Grain
three quarters of a length away third to register the ninth success from
the last 11 runnings of the fillies' classic for the Sheikhs of Dubai.
The 3-1 chance overcame considerable inexperience to land the #147,000
first prize on only her third start, and clinch a back-to-back triumph
for the all-conquering Godolphin operation and Dettori.
But the champion jockey, who celebrated with his now trademark leap
out of the saddle, was always confident.
''Ten days ago she did not work very well on the gallops, but we knew
she stayed and that is what happened. She stayed on at the end just like
Balanchine last year. She quickened well, although she had a bit of a
task to shake off the second.
''She showed great courage and is an exceptional filly. I'm only 28
classic wins behind Lester.''
Balanchine followed her victory in the Oaks to beat the colts in the
Irish Derby and Moonshell may follow the same path, with The Curragh
classic or the King George at Ascot next on her agenda.
The Godolphin team will fear no-one after this latest success in a
phenomenal haul. Since April 1 this year, they also have collected Grade
1 races in the USA, Japan, Italy, and France.
Racing manager Simon Crisford said: ''What you saw here is not the end
of it. There is better to come from her. When she won at Doncaster last
year she looked an obvious Oaks filly and has never put a foot wrong. We
knew she lacked experience but she is an ultra-professional performer.''
Moonshell, like French 2000 Guineas winner Vettori formerly trained by
Henry Cecil, was hand-picked from Sheikh Mohammed's team to join Saeed
Bin Suroor.
And Crisford added, that no matter how unpopular the decision is with
trainers, the Sheikh will continue to select a team of 40 for Dubai.
''The Sheikh has made his position clear. He has supported European
racing for 15 years and restored the balance of power to Europe.
''If he believes that taking a horse to Dubai will be to its advantage
then he is doing it in the horse's best interests. Personalities do not
come into it at any stage and trainers have to accept that.''
Godolphin had not registered a winner since Moonax won at York on May
18, but Crisford now believes Vettori and Lammtara, who represent the
team today, hold: ''good each-way chances'' in the Derby.
Willie Carson will hope for a better run from Munwar after Aqaarid,
the 6-4 favourite, trailed in a disappointing sixth.
Carson said the filly did not act on the firm ground and no inquiry
was held.

MAYBE it is understandable that the will-he-won't-he saga of Celtic
Swing has dominated the build-up to the Vodaphone Derby, but it is
ironic that it has deflected attention from one of the best, if
smallest, fields to contest the most prestigious race of them all for
some time.
The corollary is the realisation now that, if it is no longer a
two-horse race between ''Celtic'' and Pennekamp, it might not even be a
one-horse procession for the French.
Unquestionably, the prospect of a re-match between Pennekamp, winner
of the 2000 Guineas, and Peter Savill's horse, who finished a head
second at Newmarket, was fascinating but, if Andre Fabre's champion
succeeds this afternoon, Epsom's loss will be The Curragh's gain when
Celtic Swing, who has since won the French Derby at Chantilly, will
surely meet his rival in the Irish Derby.
Racing rarely works out as predictably as that, however, and there are
some questions yet to be answered by the French champ.
If this superb horse with the brilliant turn of finishing speed is
capable of reproducing his Guineas form over a further half a mile on
the roller-coaster track that is Epsom, the cramped odds available about
his chance will, in retrospect, look like the bargain of the year.
At the moment 5-4 or thereabouts may not appeal, unless you are
prepared to sell the family jewels, holiday house, and electricity
company shares to finance the investment.
What is for sure is that Pennekamp could be no better trained than by
the man generally recognised as a genius at that art, and it is about
time for another success for the French, who have not won the race since
Empery did the trick in 1976.
It is when you examine the credentials of the less-touted candidates
that it becomes clear that it is quite possible that lurking among all
these winners is a genuinely top-class horse.
If Pennekamp is unbeaten to date, he is not alone. Irish challenger
Humbel, from the shrewd Dermot Weld stable, has done nothing wrong in
four races, and in the last few weeks has been causing interest in the
betting market.
Spectrum has won all three of his races, including the Irish 2000
Guineas, and is strongly fancied by his trainer, Peter Chapple-Hyam, who
saddled the winner in 1992. Dr Devious, his star turn then, was drawn in
No.4 stall, from where Spectrum also will emerge.
Tamure is another who has not yet learned what losing is about, having
finished first in all his three races this season.
He has the help of the brilliant Lanfranco Dettori who, in his short
career, has not yet been placed in this race, although he has done all
right in the Oaks, winning it for the second time in succession
yesterday.
It would still be typical of the Italian-born Frankie to jump straight
into the Derby winner's circle at the fourth time of asking.
A horse that would have sounded a natural partner for Dettori is the
Dubai-trained Vettori, winner of the French 2000 Guineas, but Ray
Cochrane is the man who steers the Arab hope.
The Sheikh, who has won just about everything available in the game
bar the Derby, has been trying for 15 years and has spent fortunes in
the process. He also owns Pennekamp and would not mind which of them
won, although some heavy investors may feel differently.
Fancied horses, not necessarily favourites, do well in the Derby but,
if studying form fails to appeal, the fact that a horse called Terimon
was second at 500-1 in 1989 might be encouraging if you are searching
for a long-odds shot.
It doesn't do a lot for me, to be honest, but, hopefully, Tamure will.

SCIENTISTS on both sides of the border are pushing ahead with schemes
to find new non-food uses for farm crops.
At the Scottish Agricultural College's Aberdeen and Auchincruive units
work is underway on two projects designed to assess the viability of
using starch from home-grown potatoes and wheat to replace imported raw
material.
And at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertforshire, a team is
looking at ways of growing energy crops which might also be used as
break crops or even provide an ''early bite'' for livestock.
The latter emerged during the summer meeting of the Arable Research
Institute Association, addressed by Ben Gill, deputy president of the
English National Farmers' Union. He said it was crucial that British
agriculture was given the research and development backing to produce
crops for non-food purposes.
One example was the study of Miscanthus and other perennial ryegrasses
as energy crops. Dudley Christian, the scientist in charge of the
biomass programme, said that while the trials were at an early stage the
results were promising. Miscanthus had yielded about eight tonnes per
hectare and the American variety, Panicum, near 15 tonnes.
But more importantly for northern climates the grass varieties
Sportina and Phalaris -- which are more suited to lower temperatures and
wetter soils -- had shown promise in unreplicated trials with yields of
7.5 and 14.7 tonnes respectively. Replicated trials were being carried
out this year.
However, he pointed out: ''I don't see grasses as an alternative to,
say, poplar and willow coppicing for energy uses but they should be
looked on as complementary. These grasses also offer the opportunity to
fit in with normal farm activities, for example as a break.

TO become the first female chief executive of a British racecourse was
an extraordinary achievement in itself, but for Hazel Dudgeon it was
always going to be no more than her entry into the starting stalls.
From there the real job had to be done, and after two-and-half-years
in the front line at Hamilton, she can claim reasonably that impressive
progress has been made.
It has not been quite the job she had anticipated, even if her
strenuous, itinerant experience with the Racecourse Association had been
good preparation for the vicissitudes of her next stop. The myriad
demands of running a racecourse, however, have proved even more time
consuming than she had imagined but, while she confesses that it would
be impossible to maintain the work-rate ad infinitum, she still gets a
great kick out of the development of Hamilton into a popular, well
supported, and sponsored course.
''There is only a small staff, and there was such potential for the
racecourse that it was impatience on my part, wanting to get it all done
at once,'' she says. ''I quickly realised that it was a question of time
management and that priorities had to be established.''
She seems to have made a fair stab at it if results over her tenure to
date are considered. ''We had to get the bread-and-butter stuff done and
then all the business growth was tackled on a slower basis.
''There is an awful lot of work in running a race meeting, and
although I was aware of the difficulties, it is really only when you
take it on that you understand the complexities.''
Marketing had not been seen as one of Hamilton's major requirements
until Ms Dudgeon appeared on the scene. She reckons the budget in that
department would have been about #100 but is now in the #15,000 region.
That meant creating work for herself but, in her view, it needed doing.
She, her secretary-cum-assistant, Betty Logan, and groundsman Alex
Fergusson, who has been seven years there, have done a great deal to
turn the course into a verdant delight in the heart of Lanarkshire. Much
of that credit goes to Fergusson, whose remit takes in all the vast
lawns as well as the buildings and outhouses.
The outcome of the overall drive to make this the place to go for a
good day out has been a huge increase in attendance and sponsorship. In
her first year the crowds increased by 25% against a national average of
2%, and this year they are up another 12% which suggests they must be
doing something right.
If that is encouraging for a course which has never been able to
attract the best horses (although she is working hard at that aspect,
too) the support is exceptional. It does not stop there.
In sponsorship and corporate hospitality there has been a huge
injection of funds. ''That always was going to happen,'' she says,
''because the refurbishment of the grandstand had been done before I got
here.'' The sponsorship and corporate cash has gone up, none the less,
by 400%.
The total prize-money fund is about #500,000 for the 17 days racing,
and half of that comes from the Levy Board, with executive and
sponsorship money making up the rest.
The drive to make the racing better begins there. ''We could use just
the Levy Board money and have pathetic prize money, but our policy is
that the higher the prize money, the better the racing, and everything
else stems from that.''
It is not a speedy process, attracting bigger trainers and
consequently more good horses, but the progress can be seen with
Wednesday's Saints and Sinners meeting at the course. It will be the
richest meeting staged there to date, and there will be more prize cash
available, #45,000, than Kempton on the same night.
''In the old days people saw Hamilton as a load of donkeys running up
a hill in a bog,'' said Hazel. ''We are trying hard to get away from
that image. The course is in great condition and people are beginning to
see it as ideal racing turf.'' There will be three #10,000 races on
Wednesday, with two new names on the sponsors' list, and Hazel will need
to have ready the biggest tented village for the occasion yet.
The advance bookings have been startling. Hospitality areas were sold
out six weeks ago, all the races have been sponsored, with the Reg Vardi
car company insurance group, Scottish Equitable, joining regulars from
previous years.
''We will need chalets on the lawn to get five companies into our
tented village. We are worried you might not see the lawns.'' That means
extra policing, tents etc. and a fair load of extra worry. The burden
may be shared a bit soon as the course board has agreed to appoint a new
assistant to help Hazel as a consequence of the increased business.
If owner-of-the-moment, Peter Savill, whose Celtic Swing is already a
winner of a classic, the French Derby, and may well add a couple more
before the year is out, turns up he can expect a bigger welcome than
usual.
The wealthy Savill, whose base is the Cayman Islands, has long been a
major supporter of Scottish courses, in particular Hamilton, has entries
for the meeting and likes nothing better than a visit to deepest
Lanarkshire.
''I spoke to him this week and he is in great form,'' said Hazel, ''He
and Mark Johnston have been tremendous supporters along with Hugh
O'Donnell.'' Johnston, the Scot who trains at Middleham, has promised
that he will introduce one of his Sheikh Mohammed two-year-olds to the
course sooner or later.
In the winter this very busy young woman still manages to keep fit by
indulging in her favourite pastime which, you will not be surprised to
hear, involves horses.
She rides out every morning, goes hunting, and takes part in
point-to-points where she can forget (indeed, has to forget) the
pressures of the daily problems.
Those daily crises used to be eased by the visits of a man who made
his name on a different field. Davie Cooper was a regular and popular
caller at the course, on non-racing days as well. ''He was a really good
friend and we miss him desperately,'' said Hazel. ''He would call in
here three times a week and cheer us up with his banter.
''Not being a football person I didn't really know how good a player
he was until I saw the videos after he died. He never had any airs or
graces and would do things like post our mail.'' Hazel hopes to organise
a memorial race for the former Rangers player who was not only a local
hero but a racing fan. Nothing much would have thrilled the Ibrox man
more than seeing his name on the racecard at Hamilton.
In the general sense, Hazel looks ahead knowing that the progress
cannot be maintained at the same pace. ''Now the growth has happened and
it can't really go on at that speed -- the place can't take it -- if it
ticks over as successfully we can look at the non-racing side where
there is room for expansion We can't rest on our laurels.''
She won't have a lot of time for that, even if is she is about to get
more help, certainly not on Wednesday night, when the grandly clad
ladies bring their gents along for the annual Hamilton show. It may not
be Epsom on Derby Day, but the grass will certainly be greener.

A WAGE increase of 3.75% for full-time employees has been agreed by
the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board. Minimum rates for casual and
seasonal workers will be 75% of the full-time hourly and overtime rates.
The percentage increase, which is equivalent to #5.45p a week on the
minimum rate, will be paid from September 4.
The proposed new minimum weekly rates for the different grades will
be: general worker, #150.55p; supervisory grades (formerly grieves),
#181.30; shepherds #194.95p; stockworkers, #180.60, and tractor and
horseworkers #168.55p.
The board will meet on July 26 to hear any objections to its
proposals.

There are fantasy pools galore, but no other where you can swim in a
flowery
bower with a background like the Sydney skyline
VISITING Sydney in the 1950s, architect Clough Williams Ellis wrote:
''By God what a site! By man what a mess!'' And there can be no
disputing that while some divine landscaper must have been particularly
inspired when he laid out the 21 square miles of harbour, until recently
Sydneysiders have done little to enhance his work.
It speaks volumes for the outstanding natural beauty that everyone
immediately falls in love with the city, despite man's contribution.
What other city could triumph over such a hotchpotch of undistinguished
skyscrapers, a centre full of trashy souvenir shops, an expressway
thundering above and a railway clanking alongside?
And yet Sydney harbour has been, is, and will continue to be the most
stunningly beautiful stretch of water imaginable. It is the heart, soul,
and raison d'etre of the city. All roads radiate to Circular Quay which
acts like a magnet for anyone with time to spare or a ferry to catch.
Leisurely waterborne transport dictates the pace of the harbour.
Careworn commuters press their way urgently through the cavernous
business area, arrive at the quayside, loosen their ties, visibly relax.
I have never seen one run to catch a departing ferry. There'll be
another along soon.
Meanwhile a beer at a sunny harbourside cafe will round off the day
nicely. The buskers, acrobats, cartoonists, jugglers, and clowns along
the quays have a willing captive audience. The intense young Japanese
violinist plays her Brahms apparently unconscious of onlookers, just for
the joy of it.
Circular Quay has never been circular. Currently it is a wonky
quadrangle, with one side water, but when the First Fleet's commander,
Captain Arthur Phillip, came upon it in 1788 it was a V-shaped inlet in
the bush, which he named Sydney Cover after the Home Secretary, Baron
Sydney.
A walk around it from one Sydney symbol, the Harbour Bridge, to
another, the Opera House, is an obvious way to get the flavour of the
harbour. If you have only an hour to spend in Sydney this is how to
spend it. If you have only a day, take a harbour cruise too. If you have
longer, keep on taking the prescription without any risk of indigestion.
The Sydneysiders' pride in their heritage is endearingly evident. They
know full well how lucky they are. The Bridge, not the most beautiful in
the world, and the controversial Opera House have become icons. Whatever
previous conceptions may have promised, the reality of the Opera House
is always surprising. Not white, as the postcards indicate, the
fishscale tiles glitter cream, honey, even sand-coloured, depending on
weather and aspect, flowing in the sun, shining in the rain.
At the Bridge end are sections of the city that have recently been the
subject of enlightened development. The Rocks, a sandstone outcrop above
Sydney Cove, were one of the earliest and most disreputable settlements.
In the dark courts and furtive alleyways lived thieves, prostitutes, and
drunkards, the scum of the early Sydney population.
It was not until the beginning of this century that matters changed,
when bubonic plague caused many of the unhygienic buildings to be
demolished, and 1970 before the potential of the surviving Georgian,
Victorian, and Edwardian buildings was realised and a miraculous
facelift was achieved. Today it's a self-contained enclave of crafts
shops, boutiques, wine bars, and cafes, perfect for a stroll,
particularly at the weekends when streets are closed to traffic and
markets take over. Down by the waterfront is a clutch of multinational
restaurants whose clients get a fine view of non-stop activity, marine
and pedestrian.
The Opera House end is still awaiting the treatment. Nondescript
fifties blocks on immensely valuable sites are the subject of
speculation, financial and otherwise, but turn your back on them and by
the waters' edge are the bars that catch the evening sun. The Oyster Bar
is one, where the consumption of a dozen superb Sydney Rock bivalves and
a chilled glass of delectable Oz wine would make a fitting preamble to
an Opera House celebration or perhaps a walk into the Botanical Gardens
behind for alfresco entertainment.
The extensive green space which runs from the harbourside through the
gardens up to the Domaine is the setting for one of the sights that best
sums up the Sydney way of life -- an evening of music or theatre in the
park. Around seven o'clock the audience starts drifting in, choosing
sites around the mobile stage, spreading out rugs, setting out picnics,
pouring out something bubbly. There are friends, and families, and
lovers and children, all quietly relishing the sunshine and the prospect
of the undemanding enjoyable evening ahead. No noise, no fuss, no mess.
Just a taken-for-granted bonus for those who inhabit this multi-blessed
city.
But the harbour is not all Circular Quay. Far from it. Captain Phillip
reckoned that ''a thousand sail of the line might ride in it in perfect
security''. And that security derives from the sheltered bays, coves,
and inlets that make the waterscape so intriguing. So deeply do they
probe, so convoluted is the geography, that the distance all round the
harbour edge is 159 miles. Houses bordering the harbour command
ever-escalating premiums.
As the Captain Cook cruise boat approaches prosperous Double Bay
(Double Pay in Sydneyspeak) the commentator fills us in on the property
scene: ''The green one changed hands last year for eight million
dollars. They're asking 11 million for the one with the helicopter pad.
See those two up on the edge? The house that was there before sold for
two million, they pulled it down and those there fetched 10 million
each.''
The morning cruise heads under the Bridge towards the Parramatta
River, with Lane Cove stretching 8[1/2]-miles to the right, past some
eclectic architecture. To get their money's worth almost all the houses
have harbour-viewing balconies; styles are Colonial with pillars,
Regency with fancy ironwork verandas, Roman with columns, Tudor with
gables, Mediterranean with tiles; colourful gardens boast gazebos,
follies, barbecues, and lots of proud Australian flags. The route home
passes Darling Harbour, another recent successful reconstruction, of the
onetime cruise-liner docks, now teeming with shopping, eating, sucking
tourists.
The most surprising aspect of the harbour is the number of beaches (no
less than nine are designated nudist, generating much local disgust). My
favourite is Balmoral, in Middle Harbour, jealously protected from
outsiders by its residents who have managed to limit the ferry to summer
weekends (otherwise it's a bus ride from the zoo pier).
I don't blame them for being possessive about this bit of heaven. A
mile or so of sand is divided by a causeway leading to a little island.
This is one of the few netted beaches. Although the last shark episode
was many years ago, many Sydneysiders are still paranoid about getting
''taken''. The prospect doesn't seem to occur to the myriad windsurfers
who spend their leisure hours in glorious disregard for predators.
In the centre of the beach is another good reason for coming to
Balmoral -- The Bathers' Pavilion. Somebody had the bright idea of
converting this 1920s white building into a restaurant and now it is one
of the best, with waiting-lists for tables.
Some of the most interesting cooking in the world is now to be found
in Australia, thanks to the uninhibited approach of its multinational
cooks to the unparalleled variety of indigenous ingredients. Cuisines
Oriental, Mediterranean, and American are put into the melting pot and
out comes something utterly delicious known as Modern Australian. The
chef at Bathers' Pavilion is a worthy exponent.
There are so many small harbour beaches, some approachable only by
boat, that the Sydney Morning Herald features A Beach a Day: ''You
thought that getting to Store Beach was a challenge? Well try Quarantine
Beach.'' Evocative names like these are appended to many a landmark.
Some refer to local activity --Rushcutters Bay, Forty Basket (fish)
Beach, Pinchgut Island (where prisoners were starved), Neutral Bay
(where foreign ships had to anchor) -- and some like Kirribilli,
Parramatta and Woolloomooloo hark back to the aborigines, as do two of
Sydney's most famous sites: the Opera House is built on Bennelong Point,
named after a loyal servant of Captain Phillip's, and Manly describes
the noble bearing of the original inhabitants.
Ah, Manly -- everyone's favourite ferry ride. Pier Three at Circular
Quay puts it into a nutshell: ''Seven miles to Manly, 1000 miles from
care.'' The ride can be a rough one since the sturdy boat has to
negotiate the ocean waves rolling through the Heads, but the passengers
to Manly always seem to be in holiday mood and shriek with companionable
glee at every pitch and roll. Manly has the best of all worlds -- on the
harbour side are sheltered coves and a magical eight-mile harbour walk,
the Manly Scenic Walkway; on the ocean side is a vast beach rivalling
Bondi for sand and surf.
The connection between the two is The Corso, a wide pedestrian
promenade lined with cheap shops, fish and chip cafes and takeaway
outlets. The centre has benches and trees and sunken squares for amateur
entertainers.
Public transport from the harbour is excellent, with good bus services
supplementing the ferry network, but walking is the best way to get to
know the harbour borders. The obvious route is behind the Opera House,
round Farm Cove to the headland where the Japanese will be photographing
one another in Mrs Macquairie's chair. Make a diversion on the way
through the Botanical Gardens to the excellent restaurant.
Another time, pick up a picnic and a camera and catch the ferry for
the short ride across to Old Cremorne Point. Take the path around the
cove, high above the water, past the lighthouse, through banks of
frangipani, hibiscus, with kookaburras chortling away in the background,
and take your pick from the dozens of idyllic shady spots on the way
that offer superb views of the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, glistening
water, yachts at anchor.
But Cremorne Point is more than just a pretty face. It has a secret
tucked away that no guidebook seems to mention. Built out over the
rocks, shielded by shrubs, is a long narrow swimming-pool of filtrated
salt water, donated by a local resident, and free to all.
Can there be another swimming-pool in all the world with a view like
this? Film stars and tycoons have fantasy pools galore, but none that I
know of where you can swim in a flowery bower with a background like the
Sydney skyline.

TENANT farmers who have been locked in battle with British Coal over
the prices being demanded from them for the purchase of their holdings
have begun to detect some movement in their favour.
One Fife farmer, Mr Brodie Wallace from Cardenden, has had the asking
price for his unit cut by 20% after a return visit from land-agents Bell
Ingram who are acting for British Coal.
The tenant farmers had an opportunity to air their complaints at a
meeting attended by two officials from British Coal's estates department
who promised to pass on their comments.
Mr George Walker, principal estates surveyor, said, however, that
discussion of valid points on the valuation should have taken place
during the valuer's visit to the farm. He could not now instruct the
independent valuers to enter into talks with prospective purchasers.
One farmer claimed that his valuation had been carried out ''at 50mph
in a drive round the farm.''
Mr Walker pointed out that the valuations carried out by Bell Ingram
had been commissioned by British Coal and it was not normal practice to
discuss the detail of the valuation with a prospective purchaser. He
was, he said, ''quite comfortable'' with the levels of discount being
offered to tenants. Those who had purchased their farms in recent years
had paid about 70% of the vacant land price and that was what was being
asked again.
''It would be unfair to tenants who purchased in recent years if farms
were sold for less,'' said Mr Walker.
He specifically denied that Bell Ingram had been told to put high
valuations on the properties.
Out of 55 units being offered for sale, 42 had been valued and British
Coal had 21 acceptances, he said. The tenants maintain that the
acceptances come principally from those who intend to sell-up in the
near future or those whose British Coal land is ancillary to another
holding.
Mr Robert Nelson of Culross argued that the valuations were on the
high side and the 30% discount was less than that normally offered in
Scotland when a farm was being sold to a sitting tenant. Discount of 50%
is regarded as the norm.
Under the legislation governing the sale of British Coal properties,
following privatisation of the coal industry, the company is obliged to
achieve the best possible price. With outside investors only likley to
offer about 35% of the full market price (because they would inherit a
sitting tenant) the farmers are confident theirs will always be the best
likely offer for an individual farm.
Mr Walker indicated, however, that those farms which were not sold to
tenants would be marketed in packages and would not be priced
individually. Such a move could make it difficult for tenants to appeal
to Government Ministers that they had entered a superior offer.
Mr David Douglas of the Clydesdale Bank welcomed some signs that
British Coal was softening its position on reserve clauses on mining
rights. The motiviation for those tenants who were unhappy at the level
of discount was that they would not be left with a viable business if
they had to borrow a sum equal to 70% of the vacant-possession price for
their farm, he said.
''I cannot, for the life of me, see why you cannot instruct your
valuers to discuss the basis of the price that is being talked about so
that everyone can see where they are coming from,'' he told the British
Coal officials.
''Equally, I cannot see why you cannot give an undertaking not to
accept an offer lower than the tenant farmer is willing to make.''
The tenant farmers are to maintain political pressure on the
Department of Trade and Industry by writing to MP's pointing out that
they believe acceptance of an inferior offer for their holdings would be
a breach of the legislation set up to govern the disposal of British
Coal property.

MONTROSE
C V Wedgwood
Allan Sutton, #17.99
MONTROSE'S legendary exploits in the Highlands in 1644-5, when he won
six victories against an enemy vastly superior in numbers and resources,
has often seemed like a Jacobite rising avant la lettre. The
similarities between 1645 and 1745 are many. Like Charles Edward Stuart,
Montrose came to Scotland with a handful of men and raised the clans
(incidentally no-one, so far as I know, has ever seriously suggested
that Montrose was therefore a blockhead, as they have with the Bonnie
Prince).
As a pre-echo of events 100 years later, the Sleat MacDonalds failed
to rise to the Stuart banner, while even the Bonnie Prince's flight in
the heather was prefigured by Montrose's wandering on the moors after
Carbisdale. Even the historian who dislikes historical parallels can
scarcely gainsay the fact that in both cases the deep dynamic for the
conflict was hatred of Clan Campbell by the smaller clans, and that it
was small battalions (pro-Stuart) against big battalions on both
occasions.
There was also the same pattern of magnanimity and mercy by the
pro-Stuart forces contrasted with treachery, atrocity, and war crimes by
the opposition. The execution of prisoners of war and the massacre of
soldiers who had surrendered on condition their life would be spared,
shows clearly that, if Montrose was the spritual father of the Bonnie
Prince, ''Butcher Cumberland'' was a true heir of the eighth Earl of
Argyll and his Covenanter allies. When Montrose was defeated and the
heads of three of his soldiers, boys of 18, rolled off the scaffold, a
Calvinist minister exclaimed: ''The work gangs bonnily on'' -- a remark
in the same category as that of the US colonel in Vietnam who famously
declared he had to destroy a village in order to save it.
Montrose's tragedy was that he was a military genius who served two
monarchs who were ingrates. Charles I once again emerges from the
historical record with maximum discredit, and his betrayal of Montrose
makes it clear that he did not deserve such a talented servant.
As for the unscrupulous Charles II, he cut the ground from under
Montrose's feet in 1650 by recognising the Covenanter faction led by
Argyll as legitimate partners to a treaty. When Montrose landed and
tried a second time to raise an army in the Highlands, the Covenanters
were therefore able to put a price on his head in the name of Charles
II.
Montrose's stirring, but ultimately tragic and poignant, story is
lucidly recounted in this book, first published in 1952 but now
re-issued in an illustrated version. It is not a work in the same
scholarly class as Dame Veronica Wedgwood's classic studies of the
English Civil War or The Thirty Years War, but was not intended as such
and is in many ways an elegant gloss on John Buchan's classic biography.
As the book is almost 50-years-old, it follows that it does not take
modern scholarship into account. I suppose academic studies have
modified the picture in two main ways. First, it seems that the Ulster
infantry sent to Montrose's aid by the Marquis of Antrim was the solid
backbone of his army (the clansmen always had a tendency to disperse to
their homes, either laden with booty or to attend to the harvest).
Second, Montrose's success in the field has been increasingly attributed
to his lieutenant Alasdair MacColla (aka Sir Alexander MacDonald), an
Ulster Scot from the Catholic MacDonald sept settled in Antrim. It is
certainly true that MacColla was not present when Montrose was finally
defeated, at Philiphaugh.
This is not a volume that should be read for its up-to-date
scholarship, but it still compels admiration as a model of clarity and
economy from one of the finest historical minds of the century.

BUSINESS Diary readers may recall that a few weeks ago we told you
that Harry Ramsden's in Glasgow was trying to trace relatives of
survivors of the Lusitania which was sunk by a German submarine 80 years
ago.
We suggested that perhaps if any of the relatives contacted Harry
Davis, a director of the restaurant, there might be a wee fish tea
waiting for them.
Not wishing to beat our own drum we merely wish to state that once
again we pulled it off.
The restaurant entertained John Knox and his wife Anne, who come from
Brediland in Paisley, to a meal after they read the article and
contacted the restaurant.
Mr Davis was interested to hear how Mr Knox's aunt, Christina Stewart,
and her ten-month-old baby son Ian were returning to Canada after a
holiday back home in Scotland when the liner went down.
Along with other survivors the mother and child were brought ashore in
Ireland where the locals provided an embroidered shawl for little Ian
before mother and son made their way back to Glasgow.
Ian, who settled in Scotland, died two years ago.
Harry Ramsden's has on display a five-foot long model of the Lusitania
which the Glasgow Maritime Museum has kindly lent them.

IT'S the moment you've been waiting, planning and praying for. The
phone rings. It's a client. They have decided to go for the big
contract, the one you knew had to come one day.
And you are on the bid list. It's the Big Pitch!
Of course, there is no proper time to research, plan and prepare your
presentation. From being nowhere the project is now top priority and
there's a ridiculously tight time-frame to the launch.
What do you do first on receiving the brief? Correct -- you drop
everything, clear the diary, set up the team and start the planning.
There's research to be done, quotes to be obtained from the
subcontractors, internal costs to be totted up . . . it's frenetic.
Then there is the actual form of the presentation itself. Is it best
on boards, or overheads? What about an electronic presentation on
screen?
In my time I have seen all manner of presentations. Some of the best
were from people with the ability to talk simply but eloquently about
their proposals, reinforcing the words with a minimum of visuals. That
way they subtly conveyed the message that the client would be working
with people of undisputed high calibre, committed to making the project
a success.
Some of the worst have been from creative agencies, apparently intent
on proving that they had been remarkably clever in coming up with their
concepts. Try as you might, it is hard to feel convinced about
committing your business to people who seem so terribly fond of
themselves.
The art of presenting your company to a prospective client is just
that. The right presentation -- and for that matter the wrong one, too
-- reveals so much about your business:
* Do you have faith in your own abilities to do the job?
* Do you really understand the client and their true needs, even if
they were not fully explained in the brief?
* Are you looking at the pitch as a means of pulling in a lucrative
contract that will underpin next year's profits and dividends, and maybe
that new car or new boat?
* Or are you genuinely committed to meeting the client's every need on
a basis of partnership and shared information?
Increasingly it is the latter approach that tends to win the big jobs.
Organisations whose needs require a large number of subcontractors are
well aware of the power they possess by virtue of their spend and the
intensity of their demands. They will be in the market for all manner of
ways to reduce costs, apart from the obvious ones of cutting prices to
the bone.
The contractor who offers genuine added value by sharing key
information or technology, or is prepared to take a risk by guaranteeing
a level of results, is more likely to score over the bidder who sees the
project in entirely conventional terms.
Often tenders are being made on an ''open books'' policy where the
direct costs are submitted without any mark-up and detailed through
invoices. The profit margin is declared in the open and is defended as
such.
So, you burn the midnight oil. The presentation comes together
breathlessly. There's just time for a quick run-through then it's off to
do it for real. And afterwards that terrible nagging feeling persists --
we should really have anticipated that question. What did they mean by
that throwaway line? And were they just being polite when they said they
liked what you had to say?
If you're lucky you hear within days, although sometimes a month or
more may elapse. We are still technically awaiting a response to a pitch
some 14 months after it was made, although the message from the client
is reasonably clear.
As like or not the project then goes to a second stage with the lucky
bidders being elevated to a short leet and asked to re-pitch. More
midnight oil, more cost, more tension, I certainly take my hat off to
the advertising agencies that live and die by their performance at
pitches. What pressures to be under week in, week out. No wonder there
are so few elderly advertising executives still staggering around.
Even if you win the job the odds are that it is no longer the same
project for which you were originally invited to bid. The tendering
process usually throws up unforeseen issues that change the parameters,
sometimes significantly reducing the size and value of the project.
But that's life in the competitive nineties. Businesses survive by
their abilities to project themselves to clients. Whether you run a
bank, a firm of accountants, or a steel work fabricators, you have to be
able to make credible presentations to clients who are becoming
progressively discerning. I suspect that a considerable number of
managers in Scotland are uneasily aware that their skills in this area
are somewhat lacking.
How did we do in our Big Pitch? We were on the short leet and still
pitching. If we win you will surely hear about it, and if we lose you
can also be sure that I will never, ever mention the topic of
competitive pitching again.

THE economics of converting dairy farms to organic milk production are
''not discouraging'' according to preliminary results from a study
carried out in Wales by the Institute of Grassland and Environmental
Research.
The institute's 63-hectare dairy farm at Trawsgoed, started conversion
to organic milk production three years ago as part of an overall study
involving 10 other farms to examine what part organic farming methods
can play in helping to solve the problems of over-production and
environmental pollution.
Most farmers were reluctant to consider changes until the full
financial implications were understood and proper advice on adopting the
correct conversion strategy was made available, said Professor Roger
Haggar, project manager of the study.
Preliminary costings showed the overall gross margin in the year
before conversion (1991-92) as #62,752, with total fixed costs of
#39,251. The following year the figures were #59,022 and #39,306 and the
following year #73,454 and #45,528.
To satisfy even a 5% share of the liquid milk market in England and
Wales would require 600 organic herds of 100 cows. Currently there are
only 30 herds in organic production.
However, Mr Gareth Rowlands of Rachel's Dairy, Brynllys, Dyfed, which
specialises in manufacturing products from organic milk, said that
demand was growing. His farm produces yogurts, cream, butter and cottage
cheese.

* NOSTALGIA personified, he might have fallen out of the pages of
Edith Nesbit -- but John Soutar, pictured on the facing page, was around
long before her railway children. From twinkling buttons to pulled-up
boots, he's everyone's affectionate image of the Victorian railwayman.
And, indeed, the lady herself often times entrusted herself to Driver
Soutar's safe hands as she sped to Balmoral.
But as the sun came up on a summer morn 100 years ago, a sedate
passage north, taking care not to rattle the royal china, was the last
thing on Soutar's mind: he was the key player in the West Coast's bid to
return the fastest time between London and Aberdeen.
When his Lambie locomotive clanked into Aberdeen Station just before
4.30 on August 23, 1895, he was all but drowned out by the huge crowd
waiting to greet him -- such was the grip the Great Railway Race exerted
on the national imagination. His faithful workhorse was well worth a pat
and a shilling from his own pocket to have the buffers shined -- it had
averaged 66 miles an hour on the last lap from Perth, three miles faster
than the overall record-breaking time from Euston.
Soutar emerged from the footplate, his neat beard Persil-white, to be
hoisted aloft with his stoker and carried in triumph to the refreshment
rooms, and the presentation of a blue ribbon. In his 61st year, it was
the crowning achievement of a 44-year career.
If there's a plaque commemorating the great event today, it's eluded
the manager of Travellers' Fare at Aberdeen, Ian Curtin. ''I'm hoping to
put up a photograph of Mr Soutar to ensure this important centenary is
not forgotten,'' he says. ''And anyone who's related to him will be our
guest.''
At 1725 (5.25pm in old time) the modern-day east coast rival will slip
into Aberdeen, strikes and other impediments permitting. Driver Soutar
would have gained wry satisfaction that, a century on, when man has gone
up to the moon and under the Channel, it will better his time by a mere
97 minutes . . .
100 years ago, a battle for supremacy raged among the railway
companies linking London and Scotland. Liz Paton profiles the heroes of
the age
ASK your average Scot the best way to return home from England and the
response might well be ''the quickest!'' It was a sentiment that was
being exploited to the full in what's been hailed as the golden age of
the railways, when steam was king -- and its supreme manifestation was
the Great Railway Races to the North.
The exciting climax came 100 years ago this summer, as Scots and
English railway companies combined to attract passengers to their rival
Flying Scotsman and Royal Scot expresses.
The opening shot had been fired by the east coast alliance -- the
Great Northern, the North Eastern and the North British -- when, in
1888, they decided to add third-class accommodation on the Flying
Scotsman.
The west coast partners -- London and North Western and the Caledonian
-- were not slow to respond. Their pitch: faster services, slashing the
journey time between London and Edinburgh to eight hours. If it seems
plodding by today's electrified standards, remember that only a few
years earlier, the 10am service from Euston took 15 hours to reach the
Scottish capital!
The east coast operators pulled out all the stops, to bring the time
down to 7[3/4] hours -- only to find their rivals lopping off another
seven minutes to establish a new record.
Alas, these heady speeds did not commend themselves to a bemused
travelling public. After initial excitement, they began to boycott the
''race trains'', fearful, perhaps, for their safety. A truce was called.
But in 1895 the gauntlet was thrown down again, with a still more
glittering prize -- the fastest journey time between London and
Aberdeen. During four frenetic weeks in July and August, expresses
thundered into the night, culminating in triumph for the west coast line
in the early hours of August 23.
This time the North British company had a greater role to play than in
the 1888 race, when the east coast train had used their lines north of
Berwick, but relied on the North Eastern company for motive power. This
stemmed from the opening of the Forth Bridge in 1890, although their
line ended some 38 miles short of Aberdeen, at Kinnaber Junction, near
Montrose, and that final part of the east coast run was made on metals
belonging to the Caledonian company.
It was that anomaly which led to allegations of sharp practice in
favour of the west coast trains, after their ''Day Scot Express'', due
to arrive in Aberdeen at 10.55pm, was re-timed to get there 30 minutes
earlier -- just five minutes after the corresponding east coast train.
It would, therefore, follow the latter fairly closely in the final
run-in from Kinnaber Junction -- if both were spot-on time -- and it
would come as no surprise to find them arriving at the junction at the
same time or even in the reverse order. A system which enabled their
train to go through the junction first was put in operation by the
Caledonian.
In response to this, in 1893, the North British train for Aberdeen was
re-timed to leave Edinburgh 15 minutes earlier. The thinly disguised
rivalry between the two routes continued, and in June, 1895, 10 minutes
was lopped off the London-Aberdeen journey on the west coast line,
bringing the train into Aberdeen only five minutes behind the east coast
train.
This led to more problems at Kinnaber junction and the east coast
companies replied by bringing the 8pm night service in at 7.20am, which
was the earliest ever.
For the first two weeks in July, the west coast service was at least
20 minutes later than the rival train. Then the west coast companies
took the gloves off.
On July 15 they advertised that the next day's 8pm express would reach
Aberdeen at 7am, and when it came to the actual run they did even
better, arriving at 6.47am.
The astonished east coast companies resolved to fight back and from
July 22 they advertised their intention of reaching Aberdeen at 6.45am
with their night service, 35 minutes earlier than previously.
Now the race for supremacy was really on, and on that first day, with
the east coast train due in at 6.45am, the west coast rival made it by
6.39am. On July 24 the latter train was in by 6.30am -- despite still
advertising a 7am arrival.
July 29 saw the east coast route schedule drop to 10 hours and 25
minutes. The train actually arrived two minutes earlier at 6.23am, only
to discover that the rival had, in fact, got in at 6.06 am!
Between then and August 18, the west coast trains were late only once,
while their rivals were punctual only six times, being as late as 40
minutes on one occasion. The London newspapers dubbed it the Race to the
North, and enthusiastic crowds flocked to Euston and King's Cross to see
the rival trains away.
There were, of course, those who prophesied disaster and some
passengers reached journey's end somewhat shaken by the experience. It
was, after all, the nineteenth century equivalent of Concorde!
The east coast companies, meanwhile, held a war council to settle the
matter once and for all by bringing in a new faster schedule that would
leave the west coast service as also-rans. From August 19 to 23, the 8pm
train from King's Cross would arrive in Aberdeen at 5.40am -- averaging
54mph -- to arrive 26 minutes earlier than the best west coast time.
August 19 saw a magnificent run on the east coast line, marred
somewhat by signal stops, and when Kinnaber Junction was passed 35
minutes earlier than the fastest west coast train had previously
achieved, it looked as if victory was in sight. Any jubilation on the
part of the crew was soon dashed when they discovered that the
Caledonian-hauled west coast train had arrived 16 minutes earlier!
The culmination of that 1895 struggle for supremacy was earmarked for
the following night by the east coast line. But yet again, although the
journey was completed in eight hours 22 minutes at an average speed of
57.8mph, it was not good enough. The west coast train passed through
Kinnaber Junction first and went on to set a new London-Aberdeen record
by arriving at 4.58am, to achieve an average speed of 59.9mph.
The east coast crew, realising the race was lost at the junction, had
eased back and did not arrive at Aberdeen until 5.11am, but even this
was the best-ever time on that route by some 21 minutes.
The east coast men were determined not be outdone and on the following
night, August 21, on what was to be their last run in the race, they
made a supreme effort to reach the Granite City at 4.40 am, with a time
of eight hours 40 minutes and an average speed of more than 60mph. Thus
they snatched the record from the west coast train, which that night
also made its fastest run to date, covering 539.8 miles in eight hours
54 minutes.
Following this single victory the east coast alliance managements
conferred by telegram and after some initial disagreement came to a
decision to call a halt to the racing and revert to the scheduled
time-tables.
But the opposing companies were already gearing up for revenge. The
following night, August 22, a crowd of spectators gathered at Euston to
give the train a send-off in the middle of a thunderstorm.
Correspondents were posted at Crewe and Carlisle to report on the
progress of the run.
From Euston to Crewe the train averaged 64mph and after a change-over
there the average speed was held at more than 60mph up to Tebay, with
the last 5.5 miles to Shap Summit taking only six minutes. The descent
to Carlisle saw average speeds of 73.7 miles from Shap Summit to Penrith
and 74.1 from there to the halt in Carlisle.
Crossing the border Caledonian driver ''Baldy'' Crooks made a good run
to Perth, the halt at Stirling being omitted for the first time to save
precious minutes. Perth was reached at shortly after 3.07am -- 20
minutes earlier than ever before.
After another change-over driver John Soutar went on to make one of
the fastest start-to-stop runs in the whole race, taking only 80.5
minutes for the 89.7 miles to Aberdeen ticket platform, with the final
arrival in Aberdeen itself coming at 4.32am.
The 540 miles had been covered in the astonishing time of eight hours
32 minutes, at an average speed of 63.3mph to give final victory to the
west coast route. So ended the great race which had caught the
imagination of the Victorians and it was not until 1901 that more
sparring on a lesser scale took place.
But, as they say, that is another story.

ONE company which has regularly featured in this column, but never in
its own right, is 3i, or Investors in Industry, to give the business the
longhand name from which its unusual, telephone-directory-unfriendly
shorthand one is drawn.
This week 3i reported its first year-end results since the company was
floated on the Stock Exchange as an investment trust last July. In its
new guise it has already entered the FTSE-100 with a market
capitalisation of some #1600m. And all this on the strength of investing
in thousands of other unquoted companies, 11,800 down the years, here
and, increasingly, in the rest of Europe.
Currently, a number of the banks, including the Bank of England, which
historically held all the equity in the business, are seeking to sell a
further 21% of their shares, taking their residual stake to 31%. The
banks have been replaced by an army of 54,000 shareholders, large and
small, who have had a good run since the float.
3i also happens to be celebrating its 50th birthday this year. Its two
antecedents -- the Finance Corporation for Industry (FCI), designed to
provide larger tranches of capital to facilitate the restructuring of
key sectors of British industry, and the Industrial and Commercial
Finance Corporation (ICFC), set up to provide loans and share capital
for smaller and medium-sized enterprises, were creatures of Britain's
post-war reconstruction effort.
They were seen at the time as a government initiative, a response to
concerns, first voiced in 1931 in a inquiry report chaired by Lord
Macmillan, about a funding gap in the resources available to British
industry from the banks and the capital markets.
Some people argue that, 50 years on, a funding gap still exists,
particularly for start-up businesses and within newer emerging
technologies. The Labour Party has talked of creating more new
state-inspired organisations to plug these gaps. In that sense, history
may be about to repeat itself. But in the intervening half-century, 3i
has matured into a major player in the venture capital field. Hence its
regular appearances in this column down the years.
It has had offices in Scotland since 1953, when it opened in
Edinburgh. Glasgow followed in 1961 and Aberdeen in 1974. In total it
has invested some #350m north of the Border since. Currently there are
some 300 Scottish companies on its books. In the year to March alone,
the Scottish side invested #45m in some 73 transactions.
3i can seem ubiquitous. According to British Venture Capital
Association statistics, it accounted for 48% of the companies which
received capital from BVCA members last year. The Scottish figure was
46%. Overall, in value terms, it accounts for a full quarter of all BVCA
investment. It invested in quarter of all UK management buy-outs and
buy-ins last year.
Some of 3i's ongoing Scottish investments are very long-term ones. For
example, it first took a holding in Turner &amp; Co of Glasgow in the 1950s,
a investment which continues to this day. Other Scottish deals have
proved highly lucrative.
In 1967, it invested in Caledonia Airways. It invested several times
more and had its ups and downs as the business matured into British
Caledonian. Twenty years on the sale of BCal to British Airways gave 3i
its largest single realised capital gain in its history -- #100m.
3i first backed Bond, a crop-spraying helicopter business in East
Anglia in 1972, to the tune of #37,500. There were 11 further
investments down the years. Bond grew to become a major offshore carrier
based in Aberdeen. When it merged, last December, with Helikopter
Service A/S of Norway, 3i realised a #20m gain on its original
investment.
Throughout its history, there has been a strong Scottish streak among
the people who have made things happen at 3i. Its founder was Lord
Piercy, self-made man and socialist intellectual. One of his key early
recruits was John Kinross, a Scot who had done well in the City before
the war, had turned to farming, but offered his services to the
fledgling organisation.
Being a Scot didn't mean ICFC's general manager biased the business
towards his home territory. Indeed by 1951 he was referring to Scotland
as ''a dead loss''. In internal documents he was telling his colleagues:
''There is so much perjudice and the attitude of the Scottish banks is
such that I doubt if this (Scotland) will ever prove a lucrative field
for our business.''
The current group chief executive of 3i, Ewen Macpherson, has a very
Scottish name although he was not born here. He has, however, heavy
family connections with Inverness-shire. He is an nephew of Sir Tommy
Macpherson, the Scottish industrialist with a home near Newtonmore. His
father played rugby for Scotland.
Ewen Macpherson, following a family tradition, was educated at Fettes,
which, of course, was the school Labour leader Tony Blair attended.
Apart from early management experience with Massey Ferguson, Macpherson
has spent most of his career with 3i.
''I'm effectively gold watch material,'' he told me on a recent visit
to Scotland. This September he clocks up 25 years with the business, a
quarter-century which has included big deals, like managing a #25m loan
to Distillers in the post-Thalidomide seventies to playing a part in the
Weir Group rescue in the early 1980s, but now means steering the
organisation into its new listed future.
''I was recruited, along with others, by a Scottish personnel manager.
John Kinross was succeeded by Larry Tindale, who was an accountant in
Glasgow before he was recruited into ICFC. Larry appointed a Scottish
personnel manager, a chap called Ian Paton and he recruited many other
Scots into the organisation. I was one of them.''
Others included George Mathewson, now running the Royal Bank; Robert
Smith, now running Morgan Grenfell's development capital business; and
Donald MacDonald, now at Caledonian Bank.
Were there, I asked Mr Macpherson, any parallels between current
concerns about a funding gap for new businesses and the origins of 3i
before the war? ''I believe it's a tension that will always be there,''
he told me. ''The best way of thinking about what 3i is all about is
comparing the company population we serve with the teenage population at
large. There are always companies moving through the teenage years,
looking for money to do things. Some go on to become adults, others
remain teenagers.
''The thing to remember is that 3i is not simply there simply to
finance proprietorial businesses. We're not really interested in
financing people to become plumbers, run a pub or a boarding house. We
are not seeking to back sole traders. That's not our game. We invest in
small groups of people who are trying to take their company some
place.''
That does not mean that start-ups are out, provided the product or
service has greater potential. He believes the outcry over the funding
gap -- the noise, as he calls it -- comes from people in the sole
trading category.
''If you look at the VAT statistics, there are about 1.6 million
businesses registered for VAT. There are another 1.5 million that are
not registered. We're serving a smallish population, about 120,000,
which are just below the quoted company level.'' For them, Mr Macpherson
believes, there is no shortage of funds ready to finance growth and
development.
If we focus on 3i's core constituency, why is the organisation
apparently prepared to take a longer-term view of investments than many
other venture capitalists? ''Being prepared to take the longer view has
always been the case at 3i and we've found that it pays off. We're not
looking at the exit. We will want some income. But provided we've got
that, we'll let it run on.
''We base the business on the assumption that, if you build a
broadly-based portfolio, whatever people tell you about their plans life
turns out differently. There are always family businesses that don't
have succession and have to sell.
''The point may come, whatever they told you at the time of investing,
when the second or third generation don't want to do it and they have to
sell. That produces turnover in our portfolio and releases capital for
reinvestment. That enables us to develop the business as we have done
without virtually any money from our shareholders since 1975.''
3i has small offices in France and Germany, and in Italy and Spain. He
sees significant opportunities dealing with family succession problems
in businesses there. ''We've been doing a lot of business of that type
in Germany,'' he adds.
That expansion in Europe is balanced by an ordered withdrawal from the
United States. ''We're getting our money out and we're deploying it, on
better terms we believe, here and in the rest of Europe.'' There is also
a small joint venture in Japan, which has made 100 investments so far.
Mr Macpherson believes that getting out of management consultancy and
from a property investment and development business in the UK in the
run-up to flotation has helped focus the business.
Time will tell whether the bank shareholders who have sold -- Royal
Bank is out completely -- or those who have stayed on the register --
Bank of Scotland is retaining its entire 2.5% stake -- have made the
shrewder choice.

VISITORS this week to the Sheraton Hotel in Edinburgh must have been
wondering if they had got their directions mixed up and had arrived in
Blackpool instead of the Scottish capital as the foyer was full of men
and women wandering around sucking sticks of rock.
However, they were indeed in Edinburgh. The ''rocksuckers'' were
delegates to the British Council of Offices' conference who had been
treated to sticks of rock by Ryden.
The Scottish chartered surveyors' firm was trying out its latest line
in corporate gifts -- spearmint-flavoured rock.
In true seaside tradition the Ryden rock features the firm's name all
the way through and the outer candy coating was in Ryden's corporate
blue colour.
Ryden marketing manager Penny Hearn told Business Diary: ''We wanted
to come up with something different for delegates attending the
conference and we hope our Edinburgh rock will remind them of their trip
to the capital and not cause too much damage to their fillings.
It is not true that Ryden's competitors among the 300 delegates were
seen choking on their sticks, they were merely try to lick Ryden into
shape.
One of the delegates stopped chewing their stick to explain to
Business Diary that they were in Edinburgh to discuss the latest
innovations and best practice in office development.
Strange sights
around Leith
THERE were some strange sights around Leith earlier this week when
McGrigor Donald held its annual charity treasure trail. The theme for
this year's event was the Tall Ships Race which is coming to Edinburgh
later in the year.
McGrigor Donald staff were dotted around Leith in various period garb,
including trainee Isla Davie who was esconced in a hostelry dressed as a
prosititute in a short black skirt and thigh-length boots and a blond
wig.
She was seated near the window of the public house beckoning
participants inside, but some did not recognise her, or the fact that
she was one of the clue carriers, and one eager contestant was seen
peering through the window and heard muttering: ''I haven't got time for
that sort of thing I'm on a treasure trail.''
Other more innocent clue carriers were Shonaig Macpherson, head of
McGrigor's Intellectual Property Rights department who was dressed as
Mary Queen of Scots and trainee Michael Watson dressed as a courtier.
It was a very successful evening and the Jones Lang Wootton team led
by McGrigor Donald partner Michael Spence ended up with the most
answers.
More than 90 members of Edinburgh's financial sector took part,
including teams from KPMG, DM Hall and the Royal Bank of Scotland
helping to raise #1500 along the way for the Waverley Care Trust, a
charity which helps the dependents of those suffering from Aids.
Change of menu
at Honeywell
THE staff at Honeywell Control Systems at Newhouse in Lanarkshire must
be hoping that the company celebrates every anniversary in the manner it
is marking its 110th birthday.
The USA parent company originated from the Quaker community in 1885
and now employs 52,000 people in 95 different countries.
Newhouse alone deals with more than 200 customers in over 30 countries
and rather than raising the Scottish saltire alone to mark the
anniversary of the parent company the Scottish operation has decked out
its cafeteria in the national flags of its customers.
Serving haggis and neeps would not have been in keeping with the
international decor so the catering staff were serving up national
dishes from a variety of countries such as US beefburgers and Dutch
apple pie.
Needless to say the staff joined in the fun by wearing the national
dress of the dishes they are serving up.
All great fun but what happens next week when it is back to pie, chips
and beans!
Creating a big
impression
ROBERT Gall, a partner of Boyds solicitors in Glasgow, recounts a tale
which illustrates that the language barrier does not just exist between
ourselves and our European partners in Germany and France. However, it
can cause a few problems and embarrassing moments between us and our
American cousins on the other side of the Atlantic.
Robert attended a seminar earlier this week when an American lady was
delivering a speech on ''power dressing'' for women who have to give
presentations in their jobs.
The speaker said: ''Girls, there is one important thing that you must
remember when dressing for a presentation -- if you want to make a big
impression, never wear pants.''
It was only after the audience shuffled in their seats and coughed
politely to cover their embarrassment that our American cousin realised
that perhaps her comments could be taken as a little risque on this side
of the Atlantic.
Clyde Blowers is no
stranger to China
Clyde Blowers recently com-
pleted its move from Clydebank to a new home, the former Anderson
Strathclyde factory in Broad Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow.
The move comes at a time when Clyde Blowers is looking to expand into
the Chinese market by opening an office in Singapore.
Managing director Jim McColl has been pondering for some time as to
how best to tackle the tremendous potential of mainland China, and he
thinks he may have found the answer while clearing out his office at
Clydebank.
Mr McColl discovered an old cutting from the Railway Gazette dating
back to 1932 which detailed an order for locomotives which NB Locos had
won from China.
The article stated that Clyde Blowers had been awarded the
soot-cleaning part of the contract for the steam engines for the
Kiaochow-Tsinan line.
Jim McColl now plans to instruct his new man in the Far East to
discover whether or not any of the engines are still running so that he
can demonstrate that Clyde Blowers are not newcomers to the China
market.
Sailors in need
of nourishment
IF an army marches on its stomach you can't expect a crew of a
Hebridean war galley to row from Islay to Tarbert and on to Rothesay,
Largs, Helensburgh and Glasgow without some nourishment.
The 16-oar galley is following the route taken by Robert the Bruce in
1315 and hopes to raise funds for cystic fibrosis research.
The replica boat has been donated by the Lord of the Isles Charitable
Trust and 65 volunteer crew members will take it in turns to row the
boat on the various stages but they need food to sustain them.
Any food company or store which can be of any assistance should
contact either Allison or Andrew Murray on 01698 886945.
It is hoped that #20,000 will be raised for cystic fibrosis research
and the Earl of Elgin, a descendent of Robert the Bruce, will greet the
Aileach when it arrives at the Moat House Hotel on July 10 after its
five-day journey.
Topical blend
from Bowmore
YOU cannot accuse our whisky companies of ever being slow off the mark
and Morrison Bowmore Distillers are no exceptions.
The company normally concentrates most of its efforts on malt but also
just happens to have the blend label Rob Roy which until recently the
company was content to just jog along.
However, along comes the film Rob Roy and our Highland chief is on
everyone lips.
Bowmore has now decided to revamp their Rob Roy label and has
appointed Waverley Vintners as it UK distributors. The company has also
appointed distributors for the blended whisky in Spain and Portugal.
The next thing we will hear is that Liam Neeson drinks nothing else.
Award-winning
postcards
THE Diary was among the many who recently got a postcard of the Arc de
Triomph. The card was Tony Meehan of TMA Communications way of letting
the world know that it had won four awards in this year's IPRA Golden
World Awards.
Tony flew over to Paris to collect the prizes but anyone who thinks
that he spent his time while in the French capital sending postcards
would be wrong. They were posted from TMA's Glasgow office. Typical.
Alex receives a
dressing down
TONY Meehan is not the only PR who has been in foreign parts. Alex
Barr of Beattie Media was on holiday with his wife Clare in Nice when
they decided to visit Monte Carlo and try their luck in the casino.
Much to their embarrassment on their first visit Alex was refused
entry because he was wearing shorts.
The following day a determined Alex returned resplendent in the kilt
and sailed through the front door of the casino without any difficulty
only to be stopped in the foyer by a security guard who demanded:
''Avez-vous une coupe dans votre chausette?''
Luckily, Alex was again improperly dressed having left his skean-dubh
at home, and he was allowed entry.
Alex did not tell me if the guard insisted on searching him.

FOR many investors getting a reliable source of income from their
savings is often vital. One of the traditional ways this has been
achieved is through guaranteed income bonds.
Recently though these bonds were dealt a body-blow when the Government
announced it was planning to tax capital gains on the gilts which
underpin the bonds. Investors may now have to look for alternative
sources of income.
The demand from the public for secure income investments has been made
clear in recent months by the response to products such as Scottish
Amicable's guaranteed PEP which raised #163m and to Scottish Widows'
guaranteed income bond which attracted over #300m earlier this year.
Scottish Widows was offering 7.4% net of tax on its bonds guaranteed
for five years. This was achieved partly through the use of gilt options
which like gilts themselves have been free of capital gains tax until
now.
Although the company will have to pay a tax bill if the Government's
changes go ahead, David Graham, Scottish Widows' head of marketing, said
this won't be passed on to investors.
''The change won't affect existing investors but it will make it more
difficult for us to give such competitive returns in future,'' he said.
Large insurers have already had to change their investment strategy
for income bonds once in recent months following the closure of a
previous tax break in last year's Budget. ''What we would like now is
some stability,'' commented Mr Graham.
Most insurers are now reviewing their position but it seems likely
that many of the large companies which had been planning to launch
income bonds in the coming months will now decide not to do so. There
are still a number of smaller or rapidly-expanding insurers, though, who
will be able to issue bonds.
''These companies have a special tax position which will enable them
to continue to pay high returns on guaranteed income bonds. They will
not be affected by the changes in the tax rules on gilts,'' explained
Graham Hooper of independent financial advisers Chase de Vere, which
daily monitors the guaranteed income bonds on offer.
''Investors are sometimes relucant to invest with companies they have
not heard of before but they are all covered by the Policyholders'
Protection Act which will ensure that if anything goes wrong, 90% of
their investments would be safe,'' he pointed out.
What are the alternatives to guaranteed income bonds if you want a
secure income from your capital? National Savings monthly income bonds
do not guarantee a fixed return but they are secure. Unfortunately
though, the current rate of 6.5% gross before tax on investments of
#2000 to #25,000 has become increasingly uncompetitive in recent months.
Indeed existing investors should consider moving their cash elsewhere
though they will have to give three months' notice of withdrawal.
Most bank and building society accounts pay variable rates of interest
but in recent years a number have recognised investors' desire for
greater certainty and have launched fix rate bonds. For investors who
want a monthly income, one of the most attractive offers to come on to
the market lately is the Northern Rock's two-year fixed rate monthly
income bond which pays 8.05% gross per annum (6.04% net) on balances
over #5000.
Alternatively there are escalator bonds which guarantee a rising rate
of interest over a fixed term. The Bank of Scotland is currently
offering four-year bonds which pay 6.5% gross in the first year
increasing to 12% in the fourth year. It also has a three-year bond
which pays half-yearly interest increments taking the rate from 6.5% to
11% over the term. The minimum investment in these bonds is #5000.
Always remember when comparing interest rates to make sure you are
comparing like with like, either gross or net. For taxpayers it is the
net rate which is most relevant although later this summer when
corporate bond PEPs come on to the market it is expected that they will
be offering in the region of 8% tax free. But investors will then need
to look carefully not only at the income being offered but what, if any,
capital guarantees are provided.

Properly made mayonnnaise is silky, smooth, and ever so satisfying,
says Lady Claire MacDonald
WHEN I was a child salad dressing meant one thing -- bottled salad
cream, with its distinctive vinegary smell and taste, and its vivid
yellow hue. With a good covering of salad cream you couldn't taste
anything in the salad, which was perhaps just as well really, when I
remember what a salad used to consist of in those dim and distant days
-- huge leaves of limp lettuce, quartered tomatoes, chunks of unpeeled
cucumber, and quartered hardboiled egg, so hardboiled that they had that
grey aura round the yolk.
These were school salads. Home salads weren't very different except
that the lettuce was, at least, homegrown, and the tomatoes, picked from
the greenhouse, had that almost minty smell of homegrown tomatoes and
they tasted delicious. But I don't remember mayonnaise featuring as a
salad dressing until I was well into my teens. Changed days now.
Mayonnaise forms such an important part of my cooking life, either as
straight mayonnaise, or as the basis for a variety of sauces. Mayonnaise
isn't just for serving with salad. We use mayonnaise-based sauces for
serving with a range of foods both hot and cold, for example I make a
tomato and cucumber mayonnaise and serve it with barbecued salmon, for
parties at home. We use tomato and garlic (I poach the garlic cloves for
a minute for this mayonnaise) mayonnaise and spoon a dollop into small
cheese and mustard pastry cases, with quails' eggs, and serve this as a
first course.
Taste is a very personal thing, but I love good mayonnaise with hot
new potatoes. ''Good'' is the key word. I can't think of a bought
mayonnaise which comes near to being as good as homemade mayonnaise.
Some bought mayonnaises are really unpleasant, soapy of taste and slimy
of texture. Hellmans falls into this category. Last autumn, at the
informal cooking demonstrations we have here we were discussing
mayonnaise and several people were of the opinion that Hellmans had
changed its recipe. Having said what I just have about bought
mayonnaise, it is undeniably useful to have a jar in the fridge, and I
think the French mayonnaise from Tesco is about as good as you can buy.
The dictum about taste being a personal thing is never so true as when
applied to mayonnaise, almost more than any other single thing we cook.
What you put into your mayonnaise depends entirely on how you like
mayonnaise to taste. For me, I always include a small amount of sugar,
and I like mustard powder as opposed to French, or Dijon, mustard used
by so many people.
Much as I love olive-oil, I find that mayonnaise made with all the oil
content being olive gives too heavy a mayonnaise, so I use half olive
and half sunflower oils. I like quite a sharp taste, so I probably use
more vinegar than others. There are some instances when I use lemon or
lime juice instead of vinegar. The vinegar I use for mayonnaise these
days is balsamic.
Sometimes I make mayonnaise in my food processor, but more usually I
make it in a bowl with a balloon whisk. I really do enjoy making
mayonnaise, and I find I get a glossier result making it by hand rather
than in the machine. Whichever way you make it, if it looks as though
the mayonnaise is splitting, or separating, tip the contents of the bowl
or food processor into a jug, wipe out the bowl or processor, and put a
yolk in and whiz or beat it. Gradually add the separated mayonnaise,
drop by drop, and it should work. If you have mayonnaise which is too
thick, beat in a tablespoon or two of very hot water -- this thins it
down.
You can give a contrast in texture to the silky smooth mayonnaise by
adding tomatoes, skinned, deseeded and finely diced, and by adding
cucumber, peeled (easy with a potato peeler), the seeds down the middle
of the cucumber removed and the flesh diced finely. You can add finely
chopped parsley -- flat-leaved for flavour -- and snipped chives to the
mayonnaise, or chopped dill and diced cucumber, which is very good with
all fish. You can add finely grated lemon or lime rind (scrub the fruit
under running hot water to remove any preservative, then dry it before
grating) to mayonnaise. In the early part of the year I like to use
grated Seville orange rind and its juice in mayonnaise, also very good
with all types of fish, plain grilled or char-grilled, and this bitter
orange mayonnaise is also delicious with langoustines.
Mayonnaise is convenient, in that it can be made ahead. We make
mayonnaise in the morning for dinner that evening for our guests, but
for my use I keep the leftover mayonnaise in a covered bowl in my
fridge, labelling the cover with the date. I keep it for up to a week,
but not if it has anything else in it, such as tomato or cucumber. Then
I think it is only good for a couple of days. This is how I make
mayonnaise:
1 whole egg and 1 yolk
[1/2] teaspoon salt
[1/2] teaspoon caster sugar
a good grinding of pepper
[1/2] teaspoon mustard powder
[1/4] pint sunflower oil and [1/4] pint olive-oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or 2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar
Put the eggs into a bowl (or processor) and beat with a whisk, adding
the salt, sugar, pepper and mustard powder. Drop by drop add the oils,
beating well. Gradually you will get an emulsification, then you can
beat in the oils in a trickle rather than drops. Lastly beat in the
vinegar. Taste, and add more vinegar if you prefer a sharper taste.
Adjust the seasoning to suit your taste -- add more salt if you think it
needs it.

WILLIAM WALLACE:
Brave Heart
James Mackay
Mainstream, #14.99
IN 1297 ''a certain bloody man William Wallace'' (in the words of the
Lanercost Chronicle) came to the fore as leader of a Scottish army which
defeated the English invasion force at the battle of Stirling Bridge and
was in turn beaten at Falkirk the following year. In 1305 ''this man of
Belial'' (thus the English commentator Matthew of Westminster) was
captured, haled to London for a show trial and publicly hanged, drawn,
and quartered for alleged treason against Edward I, Hammer of the Scots.
Some salient facts are known about Wallace during these periods
separated by seven or eight years. The rest is silence, and what is
almost worse, speculative. Looking back over seven centuries no clear
picture of William Wallace can emerge. This remarkable man remains an
enigma with most of his life shrouded in mystery, a severe disadvantage
to the historian but a great asset to any mythologiser or unthinking
chauvinist. The recent exchange of letters in The Herald over the
Scottishness of Robert the Bruce show how little influence plain fact
has where hero worship is concerned.
One thing James Mackay's book is not and never could be, in spite of
the blurb, is a biography. How could it be when there is so little of
the life to record or analyse? A recent writer on Wallace regrets ''our
lamentable ignorance of his life'' and the only material addition Mackay
has been able to make to the subject is a reasoned case for identifying
the hero's birthplace as Ellerslie in Ayrshire, rather than the
traditionally accepted Elderslie in Renfrewshire.
The shreds on which the legend of Wallace's early life are built are
founded on the long laudatory poem by Blind Harry or Henry the Minstrel
written long after the event (though reputedly drawing on an earlier
account by Wallace's chaplain) plus a handful of other sources, none of
them contemporary and all unreliable. It is impossible to distinguish
truth from fiction in Harry's panegyric which frequently strains
credulity well beyond the breaking point. Yet Blind Harry is the source
on which Mackay ultimately bases much of his narrative.
While not uncritical, Mackay readily gives Harry the benefit of the
doubt as a chronicler. If facts are thin there is always the spirit to
fall back on: ''Blind Harry represented William, with dramatic truth at
least, as brooding painfully over the death of his father''. Dramatic
truth, which may be no more than fancy, is a poor substitute for the
real thing. But Mackay is always willing to hazard a guess and his
probablys, would bes, must have beens and it is likely thats -- sure
signs that a writer is on shifting sand -- are scattered liberally
through the pages.
Mackay makes a serious attempt to set the life -- or the few scraps
that we know of it -- in its historical and economic context, but there
are annoying gaps. He painstakingly discusses the possible locations of
the battlefield at Stirling Bridge and the tactics employed in the
conflict, but attempts no profile of the Scottish army that assembled
there, suggesting only that its ranks ''were motivated mainly by
patriotism''. What patriotism could mean among the scattered peoples
(less than 500,000 in number) of thirteenth-century Scotland, a kingdom
in status but still barely recognisable as a single nation, is not
clear.
Many of the burning questions about Wallace's career are never likely
to be answered. What was the relative standing of Wallace and Alexander
de Moray, the young leader from the north who shared command with
Wallace at Stirling Bridge and was mortally wounded in the encounter?
What was the relationship between Wallace and the upcoming Robert Bruce?
What were the circumstances in which Wallace was elevated to supreme
power as Guardian of Scotland, and those in which he relinquished it a
scant year later. Above all, how did this young and relatively low-born
man, with no real training or experience known to us, so swiftly achieve
command of the Scottish army at a turning point in history?   Wallace
was a man of courage, determination, and unshakable conviction. He
showed steadfast loyalty (to the absent king, John Baliol) at a time of
cynical and shifting allegiances. Most of the rest is speculation. We
don't know what he looked like, though Mackay represents him on dubious
authority as a six-foot-seven bruiser. We can only guess at what
motivated him.
The rest is the stuff of mythology and Mackay does little to set the
record straight. The subtitle (echoing the film?) says it all.

William Hunter visits the future to find a museum which will glorify a
proud past
WHEN Ravenscraig stopped making steel, the past shut down on
Motherwell like the lid on a vault. Then and now became different lives.
If future Lanarkshire is to know about its own youth, it will need
visiting rights.
To decide how to portray a past so rough and clarty is difficult. Old
heavy industry does not readily get beaten into a shape suitable for the
new leisure trade. Within a few years it will be tough to make it even
comprehensible to children.
Around Motherwell the answer is to take a leap straight from dark
yesterdays into brighter tomorrows.
Today's aim by the district council is to reconstruct the shadow of
steel and play it in a bright new treasure-house and magic palace of the
computer age.
Work started in May to create the gleaming walls of a two-storey
outpost to the memory of the 'Craig and Steelopolis -- an exciting,
curved building near the heart of the town, with trees all around, a
hidden garden at the back, and topped by what may symbolically be taken
for a tall factory lum.
New-age users will learn to call it an outlook tower.
''Offering a public viewing platform with video camera facilities, it
will extend the heritage experience to include the surrounding
environment,'' explained Ann Malloy, assistant director of leisure of
Motherwell District Council. Tower and dome will be lit at night. They
will be a beacon to the #3.65m Motherwell Heritage Centre.
It is seen as a one-door entrance to the many-roomed shack of the
district's past from the days when most of Lanarkshire was rural with
fruit orchards and its main export trade was in cloth.
Steel's story will be told with the full works of museum technology,
and with film, recorded reminiscences, and performance arts. Under the
same roof will be housed photographic and paper archives.
''Outsiders may say that Motherwell was just a dirty industrial
town,'' conceded Richard Devaney, museums and heritage manager. ''But we
know from the work we've done that there is a fascinating story to tell,
and it is a story that should be told. People's hardship and struggle
should be recorded.''
Going backwards has not been a sudden step. Motherwell has been
collecting its old belongings for 10 years. Lobby presses have been
raided. Household heirlooms -- ordinary, everyday bits and pieces --
have been handed in.
While they waited for a decade for a museum building to go in, the
furnishings of almost forgotten ways of living have been held in a
disused office block outside the town.
Computer-ticketed, they lie encased in brown cardboard boxes on neat
warehouse shelves -- silver curling medals, family Bibles, picture-house
souvenirs, an ancient leather football, wireless sets . . .
It feels like a poor pharaoh's cave -- an entombed past caught in
sepia, drained of colour, except for some claret-and-amber football
scarves and shirts taken from the shrine that mourning fans made at
Motherwell's park when Davie Cooper died.
Ten years of collecting have amassed at least enough bric-a-brac.
Anybody now who offers their grandmother's dancing shoes can expect
Richard Devaney to ask what jigging she went to, how many nights a week
she danced, what she wore. Take him your great-grandpa's clay pipes, and
he'll want to know which brand of thick black was combusted in them.
A soft-spoken coalminer's son from Widnes, Richard Devaney said: ''The
main thing that strikes you is people's surprise that you might be
interested in their lives.
''What surprised me most when I came here was their spirit. Their
place had such a hard time when industry was here and probably an even
harder time since it has gone away.
''Because I come from Merseyside I'm sort of used to their
straightforwardness, the anti-Establishment feel about them, and their
unwillingness to be told what to do.''
He agreed that among tellings which many of them won't take is to go
across the threshold of a museum.
For Motherwell (at last) to fulfil its need for a museum building will
be a less than total boon even to its heritage keepers.
''So you've got a new building. So you like to sit there and be lord
in it,'' he said. ''But after 10 years we think we have got used to the
idea of putting displays out into the community. As well as in public
libraries, we have had stuff in shop windows and supermarkets.''
For turning museums out into the streets instead of waiting for people
to turned up at their place, curators use the missionary word outreach.
But whatever way is taken, reaching into the past of industrial
Lanarkshire is tricky. In several respects the nineteenth century can be
harder to get a grip on than the stone age.
Motherwell and roundabout was a frontier settlement. It was coal rush.
There was a frenzy of new people. They created a melting-pot, which is a
genteel way to say population mess. Work-hungry immigrants arrived from
Lithuania and Ireland as well as other parts of Scotland, even England.
''Many of the skills had to come from elsewhere,'' Richard Devaney
added. ''For instance, a lot of the managers of the first factories were
from Staffordshire. They had experience of working with kilns and
furnaces in the pottery industry.
''That knowledge was used in a fledging iron industry because there
was no prior knowledge here.''
Church beliefs of the newcomers bedevilled Lanarkshire's religious
life, while they corrupted labour relations and gave to county politics
mixed colours all its own. To Westminster, in l922, was returned the
first communist MP, the Marxist scholar Walton Newbold -- and Dr Robert
McIntyre, the first Scottish National Party Member, was in 1945 the
choice of Motherwell and Wishaw.
''Motherwell'' has become a local government name that is vague on the
ground and a less than primary identification in the streets where
people live.
''Motherwell'' is a conglomerate of old places which have a muscular
sense of their own importance and a cussed independence about them --
Bellshill, Cleland, Craigneuk, Harthill, Overtoun, Tannochside,
Waterloo, and not forgetting Gowkthrapple, as if anybody'd dare to
forget. ''There is still a very strong sense of individual community,''
Richard Devaney put it with sensible tact.
For his collection he has some namely people to include. Along with
steelmasters like the Colvilles and Houldsworths, local heroes include
Sir Alexander Gibson, folk poet Hamish Imlach, and Robert Wilson, the
tenor. Sheena Easton comes from Bellshill.
As it happens, Motherwell Heritage Centre will find a splash of famous
names from sporting lore without going outdoors.
On its central site the museum replaces the town swimming baths where
from 1935-68 ruled the remarkable David Crabb, an unemployed steelworker
who became an acrobatic diver. He'd go into rivers off bridges and
plunge into the deep end of indoor pools from the rafters.
In David Crabb's time as bathsmaster, Motherwell swimmers year after
year were Scottish champions and sometimes English ones as well. They
were the main body of the Olympic team for the London Games of l948 and
were consistently selected for later meetings.
''David Crabb introduced a programme of coaching for children from a
very early age. Really, he was the first to do that,'' said Neil
Ballantyne, a heritage assistant. Motherwell pride continues to re-echo
in names like Cathie Gibson, Ian McDonald, Nancy Riach, the Wardrop
brothers, and others.
Above all, however, Motherwell museum will cherish most the people
whom Westminster politicians, and sometimes district councillors, are
given to calling ''ordinary.''
Richard Devaney said: ''We will be telling Motherwell's story in a
hi-tech way that's unique. It has not been told before. It will be about
the effects of industrialisation on people.
''That's the emphasis -- the effect Lanarkshire industry had on people
rather than the actual industry itself. We are dealing with
working-class history, clothing, tools, and working-class housing.
''We are not dealing with decorative art here,'' he said.
* Motherwell Heritage Centre is expected to open next May.

THE DEATH OF AN ARDENT BIBLIOPHILE. Bartholomew Gill (Macmillan,
#14.99)
* The book opens with a murder, the details of which, both before and
after the moment of death, are at the same time nauseating and
compulsive. Herrick, the corpse of the title and custodian of Marsh's
Library in Oxford, has been a man so besotted with the personality and
works of Dean Swift that he devoted the whole of the latter part of his
life to it. Peter McGarr, Bartholomew Gill's house detective, has to
unravel Herrick's adopted persona before he can solve his murder. The
atmosphere and characterisation in the book are so vivid you can almost
touch them and instantly wish that you had not. This is no escapist
reading -- if anything one has an urge to return to the relative sanity
of one's own life.
* MISSING. Thomas Dresden (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, #16.99)
Bridging the gap between a thriller and detective story, this book
succeeds in both categories admirably. Beth Naylor, an American girl
doing research at Cambridge University, has disappeared taking the
contents of her bank account with her. Her sister, Tessa, permanently
cowed by a domineering husband, for once takes charge of her own life
and crosses the Atlantic to find her. Tessa's husband pulls strings
through the US Embassy in order to get her back and this results in
Detective Superintendent Jack Abbeline being given the job of nannying
Tessa and subsequently becoming involved in her self-imposed task. At
the same time Abbeline's own private life becomes a separate story,
running almost off at right angles to that of the suspected murder, and
the two themes dovetail neatly.
* CORPSE CANDLE. Margaret Duffy (Piatkus Crime, #14.99)
Ginny Somerville, the child of a broken marriage, is left a house in
the northern Highlands of Scotland by her father, a doctor whom she had
not seen since she was six. On going up to inspect it, she discovers
three things: a corpse in the cellar; a dissolute but endearing
next-door neighbour; and the fact that her father, whom she had been
brought up to believe to be an intolerable drunk, had a very much more
admirable reputation locally. Among her other new neighbours are a
colony of artists of the more eccentrically experimental kind. The story
incorporates well-observed and evocative scenes, situations and
characters from life in the Highlands. My personal difficulty with the
book, and I admit it to be a purely subjective one, was that I
progressively lost patience with Ginny herself through whose eyes it was
written.
* MOVING IMAGE. Annie Ross (Headline, #16.99)
A more sympathetic character is Bel Carson, a recently widowed
television news director. In this first novel, set in and around a local
television station, the body of a woman has been discovered hacked to
pieces; the provincial town concerned has been subjected to a bombing
campaign by some unknown terrorist group; an organisation producing and
dispensing hard porn films has clearly been operating in the district;
and Bel's mentally impaired foster-sister, Rosa, with whom she has lost
touch since the time of her husband's death, has disappeared. For this
latter Bel blames herself, and therefore has the role of amateur
detective thrust upon her. At a crucial moment she is able to use her
technical expertise, which also happens to be that of the author, to
achieve the breakthrough in a way that is wholly believable.

THE DEAD SCHOOL
Patrick McCabe
Picador, #14.99
PATRICK McCabe's third novel, The Butcher Boy, was shortlisted for the
Booker Prize in 1992. The narrator, Francie Brady, is a bumptious child
of a half-daft mother and a drunken father, a social reject who wreaks
havoc on an Anglo-Irish family, believing they made his best friend turn
against him. Francie tells the story with terrific drive and momentum.
His repressed opinions set the tone of the text.
In The Dead School, an omnipotent narrator again provides the main
presence. It is difficult to imagine a more sustained or one-sided
account. It is a narrative tour de force, an insistent brogue that tugs
away to confide something else he's just remembered, to hypothesise on
the motivation of others, or simply to gossip.
We are aware of the narrator before we absorb any of the characters or
the hapless story he tells. Everyone and everything is seen from his
position, filtered through his opinion. His voice can be forceful, and
from the first has a slightly menacing edge, though the tone ranges from
mockery to playfulness. He is rarely kind, is frequently patronising and
even the happier times are described with a certainty that tragedy will
come -- almost inviting us to watch the fools enjoy their brief pleasure
for they will pay in the end.
The narrator's unconcern is strong enough to make one wonder who he is
and how he came by such precise and personal information. His presence
is unexplained. Without him, there would be no story; but his part in
the events or how he came to learn such things is obviously none of our
business. From the outset he addresses his readers as ''boys and
girls'', a stance he readopts at points of crisis and when he needs to
re-establish his presence. We are forced to question his authority.
Raphael Bell and Malachy Dudgeon were born a generation apart. Both
had idyllic childhoods in rural Ireland and were cut adrift by emotional
tragedies. Raphael saw his father murdered by the Black and Tans, and
Malachy's father drowned himself when he could no longer obscure his
wife's infidelity. Raphael becomes a teacher, dedicated to instilling
the beliefs for which his father died. He is appointed principal of a
prestigious Dublin school, which he runs impeccably until he welcomes
Malachy into the staff, under the mistaken belief that he is a caring
teacher. It is his sole mistake.
Both men are shy with women, but Raphael finds love and happiness in a
childless marriage. Malachy finds a girl who is eventually too
adventurous for him. Both men sink into a second round of tragedy,
ending in alcoholism, drug addiction, madness and suicide, each
believing the other to be the cause of his downfall.
Joyce took Stephen Daedalus away from Ireland to free him from the
nightmare of sentimentality, the half truths and mythology that would
have crowded him had he remained in Dublin. McCabe seems to be looking
at the history of those who stayed since the Black and Tans were chased
away. Raphael is destroyed by his love of the past, for an idealised,
decent Ireland where John McCormack sings, the IRA do not kill children,
and the state is an extension of the Roman Catholic Church. He cannot
deal with the changes of the 1970s. Malachy is a feckless incompetent,
struggling to reverse his father's tragedy, trying to find himself in
characters from Hollywood movies.
Like most with a message, McCabe overstates his case. His characters
are implacably static, the women are ciphers and everyone is controlled
by fate. But the plot is skilful and the narrative drive compelling. The
voice is confidential, and for most of the time we not only want to
know, but care about what happens to those who are trapped in
themselves, compelled by decisions they did not make.

Ann Donald speaks to Mark Cousins, director of the Edinburgh Film
Festival,
THERE'S a book by Will Hutton who is Economics Editor with the
Guardian called The State We're In. It's pretty heavy stuff, to be
honest. He's trying to write a comprehensive book about left-wing
politics and the Thatcher years in Britain and why the economics
strategy failed. What he's trying to argue is that the market is not
enough to run a civilised society -- social questions are far more
important than market questions.
I picked it up because I think that anyone who is interested in their
country and what's happening to it, has been looking for a book on this
subject which successfully challenges the right-wing view of politics in
Britain. There aren't many books by people who really know their stuff
on economics which really refute the Thatcher ideas, and this is the
first one to do so.
When I first heard about the book I heard that it was a bit dry -- not
at all. You read it and think Hallelujah -- this is true! It's
sensational because it's such a visionary book and that's why it's so
important.
Another brilliant book is Flickers by Gilbert Adair. Because this year
celebrates 100 years of cinema, the book devotes one page to each year
in cinema. It takes a picture from a film in that year and Adair writes
an accompanying text. It's brilliant because cinema is such a visual
thing so the book is right to also be so visual. The only thing that's
wrong with it is that it's back to front. What it should really do is
start with 1995 and read back to 1895 so that there would be a feeling
of peeling back the layers of cinema. Whereas if you start with 1895 its
too far away beyond the horizon of memory.

DAPHNE DU MAURIER:
A daughter's memoir
Flavia Leng
Mainstream, #14.99
AFTER Margaret Forster's recent biography of Daphne du Maurier, the
main interest in Flavia Leng's book may be to see if claims about du
Maurier's lesbianism (that fashionable tendency) are confirmed or
denied.
Neither is the case in this artless memoir by the novelist's younger
daughter. It was originally written by Leng for family consumption, and
with the retrospective eye of a child, so perhaps it's unfair to expect
dramatic revelations about the remote adult who was her mother as well
as the famous authoress of Rebecca, My Cousin Rachel, and Frenchman's
Creek.
And what a remote figure Du Maurier was, with her boyish slacks,
and lovely sculpted English features. Obviously she lived most vividly
in the world of her own creative imagination. She breakfasted and dined
alone when her soldier husband, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick
Browning (who kept toy bears), was at war or in London. She consigned
her offspring to hirelings to look after. Pursuing her own inspirational
demons she moved them, rats and cold notwithstanding, to Menabilly, the
decaying Cornish mansion that took fictional form in Rebecca.
This mother, though distant, was adored, melting into maternal passion
for her small son, or into laughter in family gangings-up against the
outside world; employing endearing private names for the members of the
family circle (she herself was known as Bing).
Less endearing was her debunking of her younger daughter's appearance
(related without resentment by the recipient) and the family snobbery
(perhaps both parents' fault) that labelled the local lower orders
''honks''. This mother, too, neglected her daughters in practical ways,
sending them out to parties in incongruous gear or cast-offs from
publisher's wife Ellen Doubleday or Gertrude Lawrence (both,
incidentally, supposed objects of her interest).
Her melancholy last years are only touched on.
Poor little rich girl, one thinks of Flavia Leng. Tough luck to have a
driven writer for one's mum.

The travel industry is using climatic changes such as winds and
dropping temperatures in a bid to sell holiday destinations. Julie
Davidson discovers Scotland's own micro-climate on the Moray Firth
WHAT is a micro-climate? Chambers calls it ''the climate of a small or
very small area, especially if different from that of the surrounding
area'', but it's also a climate which has been requisitioned by the
travel industry to impress consumers with the geographical genius of its
marketing brains.
On the Costa del Sol, the resort of Marbella awards itself a
micro-climate, by virtue of the fact that the temperature drops when you
climb into the hills of the Sierra Blanca. In Scotland the Moray Firth
is now calling its well-known weather windows a micro-climate, and has
acquired something even more exotic: a ''fohn'', which is the warm, dry
wind which funnels through the Alps in spring and melts the snow.
Do not ask me to explain how the Cairngorms or the Monadhliath
Mountains or the mountains of the Great Glen conspire to deliver a warm,
dry wind to the Black Isle and the Costa Nairn; the fohn is furth of my
experience of the firth, where the winds have always sliced me as keenly
as they do elsewhere on the eastern seaboard and, in spring, bring only
slightly fewer ice pellets.
The Moray Firth fohn, however, has inspired me to compile a guide to
other foreign winds which the Scottish Tourist Board might usefully
import to disguise the dull nature of our native breezes. The list
should also help prepare you for off-days in the Mediterranean, where
they are generally less welcome than a Scotch mist.
The Mistral: speciality of the Rhone valley in spring and autumn. It
strikes from the north and brings goose pimples to Provence and the Cote
d'Azure. It can also whip up some big seas for unwary cruisers.
The Sirocco: warm, humid summer wind from the Sahara which sometimes
arrives in the northern Mediterranean with its own micro-climate of
sandclouds, and dumps them on the coasts of Italy and Greece.
The Etesian, or Meltemi: north to north-west wind which refreshes or
buffets the Greek islands and Turkish coasts from June to October. Often
this dry, cool continental air relieves the temperatures of high summer,
but it can act tough, scattering sailboat flotillas and disrupting ferry
services.
The Bora: another cold, dry wind, this time wintering on the Adriatic
coasts. Those who go to Venice in February for Carnivale must brace
themselves for its cutting caress.
* YOU wonder how the island stays afloat. Majorca is still, by far,
the most popular destination for British holidaymakers, and accounts for
one in 10 of every overseas summer holidays booked through travel
agents. In Lunn Poly's regional breakdown of this summer's bookings,
Majorca tops every region's list and takes 16% of the Scottish market --
10% more than its nearest rival, Turkey.
The Scottish order of preference is thereafter much of a muchness.
Ibiza, Florida, and the Costa Blanca each have market shares of 5%,
followed by Cyprus, Minorca, France, the Algarve, Gran Canaria, and
Tenerife at 4%.
Tying at the bottom are Italy and the Costa del Sol, whose 3% market
share is the same as last year. Obviously the current state of the lira
hasn't made much of an impact on old habits. Until this year Italian
holidays were getting more and more expensive, but the devaluation of
the lira, although it hasn't yet filtered down into brochure prices, has
made a hefty difference to the independent traveller and transformed
holiday spending for everyone.
With the lira at around 2600 to the pound, eating out in Italy is now
comparable to eating out in Spain, and coffee breaks are even cheaper.
Lunn Poly's country cost comparison, based on average prices supplied by
tourist boards, quotes 59p for a Spanish cup of coffee against 46p for
an Italian one. An average meal for two with wine is #25.75 in Spain,
#26.85 in Italy.
Beer, too, is cheaper in Italy -- 77p as against 90p for the Spanish
half pint, but the real snip is Mars Bars. The UK's 25p bar costs more
everywhere in Europe: a painful 70p in France, 65p in Austria, 51p in
Spain but only 31p in Italy, where maybe they need more help with their
working, resting, and playing.
* HAVE mountains, will bike. No need to rely on those costly Mars Bars
if you go cycling in Austria -- the land of alp and eidelweiss is a
pedal-pusher's paradise, with a chain of cyclist-friendly Radhotels
which serve energy-giving menus, supply stands and lockable sheds and
carry stocks of repair equipment.
Bike hire is cheaper than a dozen daily Mars Bars; AS90 (#6) per day
at most, AS50 (#3.50) if you tie in your expedition with a railway
journey and have a valid railway ticket for the period of hire. You can
pick up your vehicle at any of 160 mainline stations and return it to
any manned station in Austria, and you don't even need to push it
uphill.
The network of cycle paths strikes awe in the heart of the British
pedal-pusher. In Lower Austria, for example, cycle tracks follow the
route of the Danube from Linz to Vienna and beyond -- 230 kilometres
which conduct you almost to the Hungarian border. (Brochure called The
Danube Cycle Track from the Austrian National Tourist Office.) There's
an even longer route from the Hohe Tauern mountains which follows the
Salzach river until it flows into the Inn at Passau, and passes through
the province of Salzburg on paths and roads with little traffic, taking
in the city itself. Tackle it on individual tours which include bike
hire, luggage transfer, breakdown service, touring maps and six nights'
accommodation, or accompanied by a guide. Details again from the
Austrian National Tourist Board, whose brochure Radhotels in Austria is
a guide to cyclist-friendly hotels. Telephone 0171 629 0461.
* BEAT the gate prices and the entrance queues at Orlando's major
theme parks by booking in advance through Seligo, a UK company which
specialises in unpackaged holidays. Their current brochure offers
''Dynamite Deals'' starting at #149 (adults) and #115 (children between
three and nine). They include four days at the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and
Disney-MGM, one day at River Country (or one night at Pleasure Island),
one day at Universal Studios and an outing to ''Wild Bill's Dinner
Extravaganza.''

<TEXT>
WELSH WATER investors can look forward to a 33.5% total dividend leap
to 33.9p during the year to the end of March compared with 25.4p in the
previous 12 months.
Earnings per share fell to 69.6p from 89.2p as pre-tax profits slipped
to #120.4m from #144.2m following one-off exceptional restructuring
charges amounting to #28.5m. Excluding exceptionals, pre-tax profit rose
by 3.3%.
The Cardiff-based group also announced a major overhaul to its share
structure involving ordinary shareholders being given five new shares
for every six they already hold.
''The proposals are designed to create a capital structure that is
more efficient while at the same time retaining funds within the group
to ensure that we can continue to fulfil our obligations from a position
of significant financial strength,'' chairman Iain Evans said.
On top of its regulatory requirements, the group said it was preparing
to spend an extra #38m over four years on environmental improvements.
Welsh Water admitted much still remained to be done. For example, at
present just 55% of sewage is treated at sewage treatment works. Its aim
is that by the end of the decade, nearly all will receive treatment.
During the year #194m was invested in line with environment and
service quality standards, bringing to #975m the total amount invested
since privatisation.
Welsh Water shares jumped on the news, touching a new high of 710p
before settling at 701p for a gain of 26p.
The company also announced yesterday that it is to follow other water
companies by handing out customer rebates, amounting to #40m over the
next four years. The rebates, starting in 1996/97, will work out at #9 a
year for customers who receive both water and sewerage services and
#4.50 for those who receive one service.

THE ATTENTION of currency dealers began to turn to next week's annual
G7 summit meeting. It begins on Thursday in Halifax, Nova Scotia but
little concrete action is expected to follow the meeting. Action to
shore up the ailing dollar is expected to be limited but there may be
details of a fast-response fund for Mexico-type crises.
In what promises to be a busy week for currencies, the Bundesbank
Council meets, key US price and sales data is published and a whole raft
of UK economic indicators is due to be released. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke delivers his annual Mansion House Speech to
London's financial community on Wednesday. It is thought possible that
he may set out a new inflation target, slightly less restrictive than
the current aim to keep inflation in the bottom half of a 1-4% target
range.
In the meantime sterling had a mixed tone, moving up slightly against
the weak dollar to $1.5944 but dropping two pfennigs against the German
mark to DM2.2393. Its trade weighted index fell by 0.3 to 84.1.
The decline in the dollar sparked demand for precious metals. Gold
closed in London at its highest level for a month at $388.40, a rise of
almost three dollars on its overnight level.

MACDONALD Hotels, the chain founded in Scotland by former Stakis

one other smaller hotel.
Formed five years ago to take over Ardoe House Hotel in Aberdeen and
Peterhead's Waterside Inn, the company, after completion of the latest
deal, will run 37 three and four-star hotels in the UK and three
hotel-resorts in Spain. About half of Macdonald's hotels are north of
the Border.
Frank O'Callaghan, a former finance director of Glasgow-based Stakis,
is chairman. Donald Macdonald, who directed the Stakis hotels and inns
division, is managing director of the Hampshire-based company.
Macdonald's latest acquisition, aimed at increasing its geographic
coverage, is its largest for nearly two years. In 1993, it purchased
eight hotels from Rank for #23m.
The hotels acquired from Greenalls, all three-star, are The Bower, in
Oldham, Greater Manchester, The De Montfort, in Kenilworth,
Warwickshire, The Lymm, in Cheshire, and The Pack Horse, in Bolton,
Greater Manchester. Between them, they have 302 bedrooms.
Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank have backed Macdonald's latest
expansion.

TESCO is enjoying the fruits of increased customer loyalty via its
Clubcard which has over five million members. Sales from exsiting Tesco
stores are currently growing in excess of 7% compared with last year.
Total sales growth, taking into account new store openings, is running
at over 16%. However gross margins for the year so far are lower than
the equivalent period last year reflecting the continuing competitive
environment for all food retailers.
Higher taxes mean that consumers are keen to get value for money from
their shopping.
Low prices are a key constituent of a value-for-money offer. Launched
on 13 February, the Tesco Clubcard is available at all Tesco stores.
Customers spending a certain amount are eligible for vouchers and
money-off coupons on specific products. A manual scheme is in operation
at former William Low stores before the introduction of Tesco checkout
technology in July. The manual scheme gives the same customer benefits.
The Clubcard vouchers are valid until 31 January 1996, and can be used
on any items in-store including petrol, coffee shop, pharmacy, tobacco
and lottery kiosks. The money-off coupons on specific products, such as
fresh meat and poultry, and wine, are valid until 2 July.
Speaking at the Tesco AGM, chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin said that
''listening to our customers and responding to their demands, most
recently with Clubcard, has resulted in strong sales this year and
continued outperformance of the industry''.
Sainsbury, traditionally viewed as the market leader, has had its
feathers ruffled by Tesco's marketing success and is itself launching
its own advertising campaign aimed at drawing attention to what it says
is its exceptional value.
Sainsbury's sales have been growing far less than Tesco's at under 3%.
Although Sainsbury's chairman David Sainsbury has been dismissive of the
Tesco Clubcard he will not want to see Tesco forging too far ahead in
terms of sales growth.
While the City has no doubt about the financial acumen of the
Sainsbury's board it currently prefers the marketing flair of Tesco.
Tesco is confident that it will show another year of good profit growth.
However the shares dipped 2[1/2]p to 297p.

A SHREWD decision to back the management buy-out of Leyland DAF Vans
(LDV) from the receivers two years ago produced the lion's share of
Dunedin Enterprise Investment Trust's (Dent's) 15% leap in nav to a
record 207p, last year.
With commercial buyers shying away from anything to do with Leyland,
the management purchased the Birmingham-based business for a song back
in February 1993.
Dent's 6.5% equity stake in the now flourishing LDV, purchased for
little more than #1m, appreciated by #5m during the year to end-April.
Now valued at #7.1m, the #49m development capital trust's stake in LDV
now accounts for 19% of the portfolio.
Dent's other investments gained #1.6m in value during the year. The
Edinbrugh-based trust's second largest holding, which accounts for 16%
of the fund, is heavy-engineering group Motherwell Bridge.
The Dunedin Ventures-managed trust, which aims for long-term growth in
assets, increased its total payout by 4.8% to 4.4p, after a final
dividend of 2.9p.
Dent, whose shares yesterday advanced 2p to 189p, won awards for the
best share-price performance over five years in the venture and
development capital investment trust sector and for the largest nav
advance over one year.
Brian Finlayson, managing director of Dunedin Ventures, said of the
LDV investment: ''The timing was superb because the market's perception
was that anything to do with Leyland must be bad news.''
Dent's total net assets increased by 40%, from #34.9m to #48.8m, with
#5.4m worth of shares issued as a result of the exercise of warrants.
In January, Dent increased stakes in existing investments through the
acquisition of Dunedin Ventures' Scottish Ventures Fund portfolio. This
added #2.2m to net assets.
Board changes leave Dent, formerly known as Melville Street
Investments, in a stronger position to pursue opportunities all over the
UK. The 40% increase in net assets will enable it to seize larger
opportunities which might come its way.
During the year, Dent realised #3m from the sale of its stake in
Birmingham-based car parts distributor Partco, having invested only
#315,000 in the original management buyout.

A HIGH-POWERED delegation from Ivory Coast paid a flying visit to
Glasgow yesterday to sound out interest in providing Scottish equipment
and technology for a 150-megawatt power station in the capital Abidjan.
Officials said the delegation accompanying Prime Minister Daniel
Kablan Duncan wanted to tap into Scottish expertise in engineering and
offshore technology to build the power station and develop offshore oil
and gas.
The planned Abidjan power station will be fuelled by offshore gas
fields discovered recently in the West African country, which has a
population of 12 million people and lies between Ghana and Liberia.
Companies contacted included John Brown Engineering, Motherwell Bridge
and Trafalgar House Construction.
Until now Ivory Coast has depended heavily on coffee and cocoa exports
and has been closely tied to the apron strings of its former colonial
ruler France.
But since the death of its founding president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny,
two years ago the country has been trying to broaden its commercial
horizons.
Ivorian officials attending a lunch for Mr Duncan hosted by Glasgow
Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall said that in addition to promoting Scottish
investment in energy, the delegation also wanted to promote involvement
in the agricultural sector and tourism.
However, despite the attraction of undeveloped beaches at the Ivorian
resort of San Pedro, Scottish travel agents may be put off by the
infrequency of flights from the UK and the resort's proximity to a war
zone in nearby Liberia.
Ivory Coast's dire financial straits might also make Scottish
entrepreneurs look twice at the country, despite its tradition as one of
the more stable and prosperous nations south of the Sahara.
Although Ivory Coast is predicting 6.5% economic growth this year and
has just secured a new IMF structural adjustment loan to steam ahead
with an ambitious privatisation programme, it has #3900m of arrears on
its external debt.
Next week Mr Duncan and his delegation will attempt to renegotiate
Ivory Coast's arrears on its commercial debt with private sector
creditors in Paris.

Hopes for current account surplus by year end
COMMENT
CITY pundits were wrong-footed yesterday after the March trade figures
produced the lowest monthly trade deficit since June 1991 when the
economy was gripped by recession.
There were also substantial revisions, mainly in exports, to the
figures for January and February. As a result the first quarter
shortfall was the lowest for eight years.
The March deficit of #520m was about half what the analysts had been
forecasting, and the figures were so good that there was some
speculation, albeit premature, that the current account, which adds in
Britain's traditional surplus on invisible trade, could be in surplus
this year.
Whatever the outcome there is no danger of a balance of payments
crisis hitting sterling or upsetting Britain's recovery from the
recession. The risks lie in a build up of inflationary pressures on the
one hand and the weakness of the domestic economy, notably the housing
market, on the other.
The January and February deficits were revised down by #345m and #421m
to #775m and #694m respectively. This was mainly as a result of the
Central Statistical Office discovering additional exports to the EU
countries.
In the first three months of the year the global trade deficit was
#1989m, a substantial improvement on the #3000m in the final quarter of
last year. Not only was the first quarter deficit below those in the
middle two quarters of last year, but it was also the lowest since the
first quarter of 1987.
However, if oil and erratic items, such as precious stones and
aircraft, are excluded, the deficit was largely unchanged between the
latest two quarters. The CSO arttributed the reduction in the deficit to
higher exports of oil and precious stones and lower imports of aircraft.
The #476m surplus on the oil account in March was the biggest since
February 1986, and the first quarter surplus of #1298m was the best for
nine years.
Between February and March exports increased by 2% to #12.6bn, a
record, while imports rose by 0.5% to #13.2bn, slightly below the peak
recorded in December.
In the first quarter exports increased by 5% and imports by 2%, but if
oil and erratics are excluded, exports were 4% higher and imports 3.5%
higher.
With the foreign exchanges in turmoil the picture presented by the
volume figures was markedly different. Export volumes gained 0.5% and
imports fell by 2.5%.
The CSO reported a 6% rise in export prices and an even greater jump
of 7.5% in import prices. This aspect of the figures was met by some
scepticism from analysts. The trade inflation figures were greater than
currency and factory-gate price movements, suggesting that prices had
been overestimated and volumes underestimated.
Last year the current account deficit shrank to just #235m from #12bn
in 1993, but the figures benefited from exceptional strength in
invisibles. The Treasury's forecast of a #4000m shortfall this year now
looks unduly pessimistic, especially as visible trade should benefit
further from sterling's decline in value since the start of the year.
The trouble of course with an export-led recovery is that it does very
little for the feel-good factor, the missing ingredient the Government
is so desperate to recapture.
In retreat
MEANWHILE, Wall Street failed to break through the 4500 mark earlier
in the week, prompting a retreat in New York share prices from the dizzy
heights they have scaled this year.
The rest of the world is now suffering from a break in the Dow's
record-breaking run. Tokyo shed almost 400 points overnight, and
Continental markets also lost ground.
The FTSE-100 share index had its biggest setback this year with a drop
of 43.1 points to 3337.7. The market lost some of the froth generated by
GEC's knock-out bid for VSEL and the speculation, apparently
exaggerated, over Zeneca.
The gap between London and New York is at unprecedented levels, and UK
investment trusts, among other institutions, have been reducing US
holdings and reinvesting in the UK.
The Footsie is now about 16% above its low point last June, but still
5% below its peak in February of last year. On both sides of the
Atlantic the interest-rate environment is becoming less hostile.
New York is in danger of going over the top, but the UK equity market
is by no means dear, especially when measured against ratings in other
major centres.

BEFORE I say anything about women's magazines I will admit that, yes,
men do read them all the time. More accurately, they read the problem
page (''Problem''. Greek, meaning ''Sleeping with my best friend's
husband''; and ''Page'', meaning ''page'') and any articles that sound
as if they're a bit juicy. Real experts know that these are never the
good ones. ''What you should know about your fella in bed!'' will be
about the physiology of sleep; ''Does size really matter?'' will be
about cosmetic nasal surgery; and ''I've had 14 men in a night'' will be
a feature on a female taxi driver. If you want to get a proper racy bit,
it'll be headed something like ''Dollar in trouble as yen goes from
strength to strength''.
I had always felt rather proud that my gender never had a need to
indulge in the magazines' endless shows of glossy vanity. Men, while not
being too proud to take a keek at the fruity bits of these magazines,
are quite relieved to know that if we ever want to read an article with
half an ounce of wit, then it won't have to be in a questionnaire format
(''How strong is your exchange rate mechanism -- see our exciting quiz
on page 49!'').
I admit I'm complacent enough to think that mindless magazines were a
phenomenon that, like the ability to clean a bathroom properly, was
always going to separate the sexes. Not now. All of a sudden, quicker
than you can say ''more money than sense'', we've had magazines for men
that aren't specifically about golf, boxing, or Cindy's Hot Reptile
Collection.
At first they all had bits about football and eighties pop which made
them just about acceptable. Unlike the ladies' equivalents they
generally have a sense of humour, with a bit of a mischievous tinge.
This laddish tone is mandatory, and the fun is always set midway between
the rugby club types and the stag night. Occasionally they show a hint
of character that is more gentleman's club than Student Union. When they
start punting #200 shoes as a matter of course, then it runs the risk of
alienating the ordinary reader as surely as if they'd printed a nude
spread of Albion Rovers. The letters pages often give away the readers'
true character.
GC from Derry, in the problem page of this month's FHM -- and I'm not
making this up -- writes: ''This may seem like a stupid question (bit of
prescience there) but what is the difference between after shave and eau
de toilette. Is it OK to mix brands?'' In my magazine Real Men, the
answer would be: ''Nothing: they're both smelly fluids men slap on their
face in an attempt to disguise the fact that they haven't washed
properly since the last time a Scottish team reached a European final.''
Not FHM. It has dispensed with the agony aunt concept of someone who
knows about everything. Instead it has a panel of experts, using more
doctors than the average golf course. This panel includes someone who is
regarded as an expert in shaving! Where do you get a degree in that? The
expert, or ''ponce'', gives a detailed explanation of all these points
(ie, nothing, and no).
The initial rush of new mags were selling so well that someone
obviously decided to cater for the more laddish types, and a magazine
called Loaded was brought out. This is termed a New Lad's Mag. It says
some horrendously un-PC (ie, normal) things, but at least has a touch of
post-modern joy about it. I suppose it's the literary equivalent of
listening to a group of footballers in the pub, but it's not all good.
New Lad, despite what he may tell New Gal, would appear to be just like
Old Lad, except he knows a bit about wine and likes a bit of chat about
arty films.
So all in all you might think that the male magazine outlook is quite
rosy. We've had the football and pop hybrids, the noisy, cheeky, and
ultimately likable chappy giving out lip, usually with a sense of
humour. Then, all of a sudden it feels as if their boss has walked in
and they've come over all responsible. The magazine Men's Health was
launched this year, and suffocated the fun out of the whole picture. If
the picky one out of the Odd Couple had to buy a magazine, he would
crave this one. I would stress that I'm not to blame for having bought
it. Wee Dave recommended it to me.
That admittedly should have rung alarm bells. To put you in the
picture, WD is one of these infuriatingly successful guys who gets a
good job in London, cubes his salary, gets a flat virtually in
Buckingham Palace, and drinks regularly in the same pub as Russ Abbott.
Despite all this, when he phones he insists that he really wishes he
could come back up to Scotland, but he's waiting on the right
opportunity to arise.
Yeah, sure. We know he's changed. Since he moved he now refers to
himself as David, buys all his clothes from GAP, and from having the
sort of politics expected of a fat man from Paisley (ie, in the dour
wing of the Cynical Party), he's now King Sensitive of the Right-on
People. Typical of many Scots, his idea of haute cuisine was to get
Wotsits in a Beef BarBQ flavour rather than the traditional fluorescent
Cheese. All of a sudden, within two minutes of getting off at Euston,
he's rustling up dishes on a bed of red cabbage.
Leaving Scotland obviously matures a man, but I'm proud to say that we
follow the Scottish tradition when we notice how he's changed: we just
shake our heads and murmur: ''You know what his trouble is, don't you?
He's forgotten his roots. What's the problem 'David'? Is a roll and
potato scone not good enough for you any more?'' We are, of course, just
joking.
So basically I should have known better, but Men's Health is the most
female male magazine there will ever be. I was embarrassed buying it --
so much so that I should just have hidden it inside a copy of Playboy.
Men's Health makes Watchdog Healthcheck look like a barrel of laughs.
The letters page says it all. R  Weber (from Cambridge) berates the
magazine for assuming that ''the reader's partner is always female''.
Yeah.
Bryn Hirst, meanwhile, makes an impassioned plea for all MH readers to
stop scaremongering, wake up, and realise that ''feminism is a vibrant
movement whose main goal is a better society . . . for everybody''.
Quite.
Why am I reading this tosh? Why is anyone buying it? By this time even
the most casual reader would want to go round and sort these guys out
with a few meaningful blows to the head. Any good vibes that the
publication has left are dissipated completely by the adverts for facial
cream, hair gel, and mineral water. Like the Jehovah's Witness at the
Blood Transfusion Centre, Men's Health has somewhat spoiled the party.
Between its covers men are portrayed as helpless, stress laden,
misunderstood mummy's boys who probably haven't bought a round since
that time down the health club when their hair gel ran out.
Any guy who feels a need to buy this would be cheaper just borrowing
their partner's (if female!) Marie Claire. Besides, there'll be a lot
more smut in the Marie Claire. Anyway, where's my copy of Playboy? Ah,
there it is, underneath my make-up bag.

SOMETIMES it feels safer to keep quiet about a particular strand in a
complex argument that makes you uneasy. Fear of speaking out in case you
offend those whom you would least want to hurt, possibly. Cowardice,
probably.
For a long time I've reasoned myself out of voicing a niggling doubt
about some of the elements in the debate on domestic violence. Tricky
this, don't want to seem to be on the wrong side. But like an itch you
can't reach, the niggle won't go away.
Eight million people tuned in to Brookside to watch battered wife
Mandy Jordache jailed for life for killing her husband. Lo, the issue
was all over the front pages. Beaten women flooded helplines. The
verdict provoked demonstrations on Merseyside and thousands of protest
calls.
This wasn't, as some thought, evidence that viewers can't tell the
difference between fiction and reality, more proof that popular drama
can reach the parts complex legal cases rarely do.
Those who followed the Jordache story line from the start saw the
awful monster that was Trev drawn inexorably towards his fate. When
Mandy and her daughter were driven to kill their tormentor, it felt like
the only thing to do. Notwithstanding the ludicrous pathos of the patio
burial, it was powerful human drama.
It's right that domestic violence towards women should be addressed.
It accounts for 25% of all recorded violent crime. An estimated one
million women a year call for police help. But there's something in the
tone of the coverage of those who resort to killing their violent mate
which disturbs. It's as if such slaughter is a matter of inevitability.
It is the victim as heroine.
We know the orthodoxy: woman trapped within a home, dependent upon a
man who becomes abusive, her emotional dependency puts him in a position
of strength from which he is able to sap and destroy her self-esteem.
She loses even the will to remove herself from the scene of perpetual
violence. Then, her mind seriously disturbed, she cracks. Out comes the
carving knife.
Nowhere along this line of thought is the woman allowed the remotest
responsibility for her own actions. The creed is now so widely accepted
that social psychologists testify to it. For many battered women who
suffer psychological and mental torture, killing an aggressive partner
is the only way to halt it. The orthodoxy allows no doubt, no debate.
Nobody dares.
It may get a few women standing in the dock, like Mandy, a sympathetic
hearing. Does it really do women any favours to be seen as kicked currs?
Is this what it has come to? The victim as heroine?
Every act of physical violence will have traumatic effects but what do
we mean when we tell a woman that her sense of self-worth can be
destroyed by a violent act? If we contest those wrongs by sending out
other messages about our special weakness, won't they lose more than we
gain? It is the double jeopardy of the victim. The woman battered by her
partner must be considered impotent, helpless, at the mercy of forces: a
victim. Once we've accepted this view of them, we're ready with
compassion and succour, counselling and protests.
The danger is that we end up enfeebling the very people who need above
all else a solid sense of their own integrity and autonomy.
I don't think we can have it both ways. Real help for women trapped in
violent relationships would be help to get out. Somewhere to go. It
would be to ensure that domestic violence is treated like any other kind
of violence instead of landing up, with the back-green pissers and
inebriate tramps at the district court.
If only for the sake of their children, the rest of us should expect
them to find a way out and help them if they can't. It achieves nothing
for women trapped in abusive relationships to be patronised
(matronised?) into believing that it's not their fault if they choose to
kill, that there is no alternative. To strip them of any sense of their
own responsibility is to strip them of any last vestige of self-esteem.
They might have little left. Maybe none.
Within the mouldy old behaviourist theories, there's some truth in the
notion that violence is absorbed and that children of a violent
relationship stand a higher than average chance of turning into the
beaters or the beaten.   Children, I suspect, absorb most of their sense
of self-worth from their most important role models, their parents. What
does a mother say to her girl child when she stays to be a punchbag? Or
her son when he watches her go back for more?
No way out? There is. Ask my mother.

With a General Election on the horizon, Labour's plans for a Scottish
assembly are still remarkably embryonic, writes Malcolm Dickson, with
some serious areas of potential conflict largely ignored in the public
arena
IT MAY be only coincidence, but some of the most important
developments in Scotland's political history have occurred remarkably
close to the turn of the century: in 1603, the Union of the Crowns; in
1707 the Union of the Parliaments; in 1885, the setting up of the
Scottish Office.
Now, as we approach a new millennium, another defining moment in
Scottish politics appears likely to be achieved. With the prospects of a
Labour Government being returned at the next General Election higher
than they have been for a generation, Scotland looks set to be presented
with its first taste of a parliamentary assembly in the democratic age.
The momentum towards this end seems irresistible. Labour has no plans
to hold a referendum of the issue, something which none of the other
political parties supporting change has taken serious issue with. While
the momentum gathers, however, what is less acknowledged is the still
deeply divided nature of opinion on the constitutional question in
Scotland; all the political parties ignore this at their peril.
It may be consistently a feature of Scottish opinion for over a decade
now that a majority of Scots favour some form of constitutional reform.
But this masks an embarrassing mismatch between ordinary people's
aspirations and what the political parties prescribe.
Not all SNP supporters want independence; some support devolution.
Among Labour's legions there is a significant minority who would back
full independence as opposed to their party's devolved parliament. The
same is true of the Liberal Democrats. Even the bastion of Unionism is
not untouched. The Conservatives have a growing minority who would
happily support a parliament for Scotland within a UK context.
These are mixed messages; they show that no one solution can be held
up as a consensus view. Yet since 1979 the political debate has moved on
so much that there is a feeling of inevitability that a Scottish
solution will come. This has tended to paper over these mixed messages.
But what is likely to happen to these mixed messages if Labour does
indeed deliver a Scottish Parliament sometime in the next few years?
Even more importantly, in the short term at least, can Labour actually
deliver its promises? And what of the potential problems?
A spectator of Scottish politics might be forgiven for thinking that
only the West Lothian question and the issue of tax-raising powers are
problems worthy of debate. But as yet, some of the most serious areas of
potential conflict have been largely ignored in the public arena, swept
under the carpet for reasons at best allied to electoral tactics and at
worst political ineptitude.
If Labour is to deliver legislation for a Scottish parliament within
one year of it taking office, then it will have to do somewhat better
than the timetable for the recent local government reform in Scotland.
Here the Conservatives spent 18 months on consultation exercises, a
lengthy committee stage in Westminster resulting in almost a full term
of parliamentary consideration, and only in April of this year did we
have elections to shadow authorities which finally take over control in
April 1996.
We may only be 18 months away from a General Election and yet Labour's
plans are still remarkably embryonic. True, there has been detailed
consideration of the functioning of the new parliament, its electoral
procedure and legislative mechanisms, but still major questions remain
over its scope and competence.
Far too much time has been devoted to the West Lothian question. The
question of the role of Scottish members in Westminster is a problem no
doubt, but it is one for which the fudging ability of the British
constitution is perfectly designed to cope with, at least initially.
If the related problem of over-representation of Scottish MPs at
Westminster becomes such a defining problem after the setting up of a
Scottish parliament, why is it not a problem worthy of consideration
independently of the Scottish question here and now? The problem exists
at the moment, yet it does not seem to interfere with the whole
legitimacy of current governmental arrangements.
There are far more serious questions to be thrashed out, and for which
only full independence or the status quo have an immediate answer. There
is as yet no real solution to the problems of legal competency. Two
areas here are a minefield for an incoming Labour government.
First: will a Scottish parliament be allowed to do anything about
previous UK legislation which affects Scotland? Many legislative areas
are affected here. Anyone who attends a ticketed football match in
Scotland will note the reference to the Public Order Act 1986 on the
back. This is legislation which covers Scotland as well as England and
Wales and for which there is no separate Scottish provision which might
conceivably be dealt with by a future Scottish parliament. Westminster,
then, could possibly still be controlling the handling of our national
game.
More broadly, this example illustrates the potential weakness of a
Scottish parliament's ability to develop a Scottish approach to
political and civil liberties. This is only one policy area to be
affected in this manner. There are many more across the policy spectrum.
Secondly, and much more crucial is the question of future clashes
between UK legislation and a Scottish parliament. In the area of
European legislation Westminster would still have primacy as the body
which represents the member state of the United Kingdom. That would mean
no effective Scottish control over agriculture or fishing policy for
starters. Indeed, all areas of policy where European directives now take
precedence would still be handled in London.
In domestic legislation, if some conflict were to occur who would have
the final say? This question proved extremely messy during Spain's
process of setting up its autonomous regions a decade ago and took
several years of protracted political and legal manoeuvring before it
was resolved.
In the UK, would the Scottish courts have primacy -- or would the
highest UK authority, in the form of the House of Lords, win out in the
end? Without proposals for a separate constitutional court to act as
arbiter in such conflicts, this is a question which stores up the
greatest potential problem for a devolved Scottish parliament.
If such a conflict resulted in a win for UK legislative primacy, then
it would mean that Westminster would still intervene at will to override
Scottish decisions, even in those policy areas considered only by the
Scottish parliament.
These legal areas of debate have largely been ignored and must be
addressed now if serious problems are not to occur in future. With the
prospect for cohabitation of a Labour-dominated Scottish assembly with a
Tory majority in Westminster a possibility, perhaps after just one term
of a Blair-led Labour administration, the potential for conflict which
introduces a Scotland versus England dimension in such an overt fashion
must be avoided.
But the sheer act of setting up a Scottish parliament so quickly
immediately introduces a divide. What of plans for England and Wales? In
Wales Labour's plans are simply to democratise the Welsh Office with no
tax-raising provision. As for England, plans are so much in their
infancy as to have no serious prospect within the first term of any
future Labour administration.
The mismatch of functions and timetables may only serve to create
resentment among those who are firmly in favour of a new decentralised
political structure in other parts of the UK. In at least the north of
England and in Wales, there is now consistent evidence that this is the
clear majority of people. If a Scottish parliament succeeds, then that
will be good news for Scots; but for those on Tyneside and Teesside that
news may be hard to take.
Internally in Scotland the implications of a Scottish parliament are
hard to measure. There is no doubt that some impact will be felt within
the political life of Scotland and there may well be significant change
in the social and economic spheres as well. What is not clear is whether
such changes will all work in favour of Scotland's future wellbeing.
Plans for some contributing element of proportional representation in
a future Scottish parliament have recently shown continuing differences
between Labour and Liberal Democrats. Under Labour's proposals only
around one-third of Scottish parliamentary members would be elected
under a form of PR. While this would bring the composition of a Scottish
parliament closer in line with the overall choices expressed by
Scotland's voters, it would not prevent Labour from winning a
comfortable majority, given the current political climate in Scotland.
What would happen to the other parties is more open to debate. Labour
has suggested that a Scottish parliament would quell the SNP and reduce
independence as a serious option for Scotland's political future to the
sidelines. On the other hand, the Scottish Tories have long argued that
devolution constitutes a ''slippery slope'' that will inevitably lead to
the break up of the United Kingdom.
In reality, neither of those scenarios is likely, at least in the
short term. The SNP's support will not disappear. The demographics of
its support suggest a continued presence in Scottish affairs long after
possible devolution. Indeed, if Labour dominates a Scottish parliament
and as a result comes under closer scrutiny in Scotland than before, and
still fails to deliver in Scottish terms, then that opens the
possibility of more support being gained for the separatist position.
This must be counterbalanced by the nature of Scottish society.
Although the ''radical'' edge to Scottish politics is quite often in
evidence, much of Scotland is quite conservative with a small ''c'' in
political terms. Indeed, this feature of Scottish politics is often
forgotten.
In the 1950s the Conservatives polled better in Scotland than they did
in England, relying then on the more traditional ties of Scottishness
with civic responsibility and social duty. The Thatcher decade
concentrated on the uneasy doctrine of individualism which felt alien to
many naturally on the right of the political spectrum in Scotland.
The SNP has benefited from capturing support from the younger elements
of Scottish society, and those moulded by the social and economic
changes that occurred in Scotland in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these
voters in a Scottish context would have been natural territory for a
Conservative Party of the sort witnessed in the first part of the
post-war period.
A future Scottish parliament may afford a better opportunity to
resurrect right-of-centre politics in Scotland than maintenance of the
status quo. At the recent Scottish Tory conference in Glasgow, it was
not only in the so-called Declaration of Cathcart that calls were made
for a more distinct Scottish Tory identity.
If that Tartan Tory identity were allowed to develop separately from
Conservatism south of the Border within the context of a Scottish
parliament, then a new right-of-centre politics, with potential for
success, might emerge.
What a Scottish parliament could and would actually do is far from
clear. Although Labour has made clear its intention to set up the
institution, there is no manifesto for what a Labour-controlled
administration in Scotland would actually do. There seems to be a
complacent belief that simply setting up the assembly will satisfy
demands.
The experience of devolution processes throughout Europe shows that
devolution, while satisfying broad political concerns, may well generate
more demands in social and economic terms. With a Scottish parliament
identifiably in a position to influence Scottish decision-making,
demands from all sections of Scottish life will converge on its
doorstep.
The construction of a more thorough accounting system for government
in Scotland would lead to greater ability to scrutinise and criticise
decision-making. The fuller development of a Scottish media associated
with the parliament would also lead to Scottish MPs being under the
microscope far more than they generally are at present.
Local newspapers as well as Scottish national papers would be able to
report substantively on Scottish affairs. This would probably contribute
to a better informed public in Scotland. Considerable research points to
a better informed public being more likely to criticise their elected
representatives, and more likely to be dissatisfied with their
performance.
Some critics of Labour's plans for a tax-raising parliament have
argued that such dissatisfaction would chase away investment -- and even
create a population exodus from Scotland. It is hard to sustain this
view.
We already live in a society where tax differentials exist. The
council tax costs people in the same property band differing amounts in
different areas of Scotland. Shetland has consistently had one of the
lowest local tax rates in recent years, yet there is no flood of people
moving there for that reason.
Current research, being undertaken by my university with Glasgow
University, actually asked people whether they had considered moving
because of high taxes in their local area. Only 5% had ever considered
leaving for this reason, and of those who had made this consideration
only one in 10 actually saw it through.
It is easy to forget that when reference is made to the Scottish
dimension in politics, Scotland itself is far from united about the
solutions to the problems it faces. The rhetoric of the national
question focuses on the idea of Scotland, not the idea of the Scottish
people. Scottish people are diverse. They disagree on many things, and
perhaps exhibit more differences on substantive issues than our
politicians would care to admit.
Scotland's history is littered with examples of one section of
Scottish society winning out over another -- whether in social, economic
or religious terms. Look no further than the dismissal of Catholic
history in eighteenth and nineteenth-century Protestant Scotland, or the
close association of the Union and Scottishness in the Imperial age, or
more recently the attempts to redefine Scottish identity in terms of an
industrial working-class heritage which now seems far from a defining
feature of Scottish society (if it ever was for rural Scots men or
women).
Scotland still retains the potential for divisions of this nature. The
religious element has not entirely disappeared, as was bitterly
exhibited during the Monklands East by-election last year. Indeed, at
the 1992 General Election around 75% of Catholics in Scotland who voted,
voted for the Labour Party.
The division between urban and rural Scotland is back on the political
agenda as the economic fragility of areas such as the Scottish Highlands
continues to be cause for concern in the face of crippling property
prices and poor economic infrastructure.
Many of our cities and towns are still riven by decay, poverty, and
their consequences of crime and drug abuse. Regeneration of sorts that
does not fully benefit those who really need it only serves to
marginalise the fringes of Scottish society even further. These are
disenfranchised people who will, in all likelihood, begin to make a
legitimately louder noise if a Scottish parliament comes into existence.
These problems of creating a better Scotland will face our
decision-makers whatever the resolution of the constitutional question.
Neither independence, nor keeping the status quo, provides easier
answers. It is therefore perhaps more pertinent to remember that any
creation of a Scottish parliament will not mark an end to the ''Scottish
Question'' but will serve only as a signpost on the long road to
answering many more and new Scottish questions.

THE Government can hardly do anything else other than bluster its way
through the uproar over its alleged ''insider dealing'' in the #4000m
sale last March of its remaining holding of shares in the English
electricity generating companies, PowerGen and National Power.
The prospect of senior civil servants and Government Ministers in the
dock would surely be the ultimate disaster for even this accident-prone
administration. The Goverment stands accused of a classic case of
insider dealing, which is a criminal offence.
The accusers allege that Government Ministers and departments
deliberately kept quiet before the sale about a forthcoming review of
electricity prices by the industry regulator, which they knew would
influence electricity share prices, in order to maximise the return from
the sale.
The big institutions like pension funds and insurance companies, here
and abroad, were furious when, the day after the share sale, regulator
Professor Stephen Littlechild came out with his bombshell that he was
looking again at electricity prices. This happened just six months after
he had supposedly put in place a regime for five years, so no-one could
have foreseen he was to re-open the whole question so soon.
Prices of all the electricity company shares, including National Power
and PowerGen, fell sharply, more than wiping out the initial premium on
the new shares. Institutions considered they had been duped into buying
the shares under a false prospectus and there was rebellious talk of a
refusal to pay the second instalment of the purchase price and of suing
the Government.
The anger has been assuaged somewhat by the subsequent recovery in
share prices but will not be forgotten the next time the Goverment wants
to privatise something.
It is surprising, to say the least, to see the Stock Exchange, of all
organisations, gravely embarrassing a Tory Government. The exchange was
under great pressure from institutions to take action. It is already
considered a weak and ineffectual body by many, so it could hardly be
seen to be doing nothing.
The exchange's chief executive, Mr Michael Lawrence, effectively
indicated that, had anyone but the Government been involved, it would
have referred the case on to the relevant regulatory bodies. In other
words, in its view, there was a case to answer. However, it was unable
to go further because of Crown immunity from the relevant sections of
the Financial Services Act. So it can do no more, which it hopes will
get it off the hook of institutional anger.
There is a suspicion that, in making its own opinion about the affair
pretty clear, the Stock Exchange had one eye on the likelihood that
Labour will form the next Government. The exchange has often been
accused of laxity in its own regulatory actions and it is perhaps eager
to improve its reputation with Labour, which promises a tougher
regulatory regime for the financial markets and big business.
The Government's decision to mount an inquiry into the affair by the
Treasury raised a hollow laugh in the City of London yesterday and
no-one thinks it will be other than a whitewash.
''It's equivalent to a criminal investigating his own crime,'' one
cynic protested.
At the time of the pronouncement by Professor Littlechild, the
Treasury maintained that it had known about the statement only the
previous day, which was the actual day dealing began in the shares. Now
it appears the tune has changed, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke indicating that serious consideration had been given to
postponing the sale.
The Government and its legal advisers will claim that Professor
Littlechild's remarks were relevant only to the electricity distribution
companies and not the generators, National Power and Powergen. In a
narrow sense, this is true.
The distributors' prices are regulated because they operate as
monopolies in respect of domestic supplies. The generators are not
subject to price controls because they compete with each other and other
providers, such as Nuclear Electric and independent operators, to supply
power to the distributors and large industrial users. The Scottish
companies, Hydro and ScottishPower, come into a third category, because
they are both generators and distributors.
However, the Government and its City advisers must have known that
share prices of all electricity companies, indeed all privatised
companies subject to regulators, would have been affected by Professor
Littlechild's statement.
They must have realised that, regardless of the two companies not
being directly affected, National Power and PowerGen shares would be
dragged down with the whole sector, which is precisely what happened.
The part-paid shares of National Power fell 10p to 176p against the
180p at which they had been sold to institutions, while PowerGen dropped
9p to 189p against the sale price of 195p. Private investors still had a
marginal profit because their sales were sold at a discount of 10p.
The share price movements were not an irrational knee-jerk reaction
but perfectly justified. Professor Littlechild's decision to review
prices so soon after fixing the formula discredited the whole regulatory
system, creating huge uncertainty.
The stock market can only value the shares by knowing the shape of the
regulatory regime for several years ahead. If it going to change every
few months in unpredictable ways, dealers are totally at a loss to know
what price to put on the shares. The regulatory regime effectively
controls the profits and therefore dividends the companies can pay.
As for Professor Littlechild, a former academic, it is difficult to
avoid the conclusion that he was naive to the extent that he literally
did not know the effect on share markets his comments would have. There
were widespread calls in the City, if not consumer groups, that the
professor should resign or be replaced, and he is still regarded as
being not up to the job.
The Treasury is seeking to tough it out, maintaining that, even if it
did not have Crown immunity, it would escape prosecution. It is
certainly notoriously hard to convict someone of insider dealing. Making
money through using information not generally known only began to invoke
censure in the 1980s, and the rules have been steadily tightened since
then. By its very nature, it is hard to detect and even harder to
present evidence firm enough to secure a conviction.
The latest legislation defines an insider as anyone with ''direct
access'' to inside information. Previously they had to be ''connected''
to the company, through being an employee or director.
The Stock Exchange's surveillance department has a watching brief over
all stock market dealings, and often triggers an informal probe when
there is an unusually large price movement. This can often precede an
important announcement from the company concerned, possibly of a
takeover approach, or of losses to come. On these occasions, it may seem
obvious that someone has had inside knowledge. But tracking them down
when they can be hidden behind a nominee name or overseas trust can be
all but impossible. Besides, many speculators deal on hunch without
special knowledge. At any rate, few informal investigations of share
price movements are taken further and an undercurrent of insider dealing
will probably always be a feature of markets.
Professor Littlechild has succeeded in casting doubt on the whole
regulatory system which has spawned a large bureaucracy known under neat
acronyms like Oftel, Ofwat, Ofgas, and Offer with the massive
privatisation exercise of the past decade or so.
There is criticism of the unaccountability of the individual
regulators, who are a power unto themselves and stamp their own
personalities on the bodies they head. There is little to check their
own prejudices coming into play. Often they have little or no knowledge
of how industry and commerce work before their appointments.
As a result, certainly in the early days, they were hoodwinked by the
industries they police into having lax regimes which have enabled the
privatised industries to prosper mightily. This is particularly so in
the electricity distributors, whose shares have risen by around 130%
since privatisation and continue to post large increases in dividends.
The English water companies are not far behind.
Admittedly, the initial pricing policies were set by the Government
eager to maximise privatisation proceeds and encourage public
participation but the regulators could have cracked down harder much
earlier than they did.
Some observers believe reform is necessary along US lines, where a
regulatory commission is appointed for each industry, not a single
regulator. Others see scope for a super-regulator which would create
consistency of approach.
The present uncertainty means the shares of privatised industries are
rated lower than they would be with clear regimes in place. It is
fortunate for the Government that the electricity debacle came at the
end of the main privatisation process. Those industries which remain,
like Nuclear Electric, will now have to be priced more cheaply to secure
buyers. So what the Government gained by not coming clean over the
Littlechild review it will lose in lower receipts from remaining share
sales.

THE origins of the present electricity sale furore go back to 1990
when the dozen English power distributors, known collectively as the
Recs, were sold off to the public.
The sale was a great success and it soon became apparent that they had
been sold far too cheaply. Certainly, their subsequent performance has
proved this. Shareholders have more than doubled their money in capital
terms and have seen growth in dividends many times the rise in
inflation.
The underpricing stemmed from a mixture of deliberate policy by the
Government, eager to maximise public involvement in and enthusiasm for
privatisation, and the successful playing down by the industry of how
profitable it could become under the pricing regime then in force.
Three months after the Recs were sold, it was the turn of the two
English generators, National Power and PowerGen. The sale consisted of
60% of the state holding. They were also underpriced, though not on the
same scale.
Subsequently, the Government was not such a sucker and the Scottish
electricity privatisations were better priced from the Treasury's point
of view.
The expertise of City advisers also improved in the way they sounded
out institutions to name their price, with the low bidders denied
shares.
When the decision came to sell the remaining 40% of the two English
generators last March, the Treasury was determined to get a good price.
The prospectus contained several pages of small type, detailing the
regulation of the companies by the Director General of Electricity
Supply.
Although not subject to direct price contols like the distributors who
are monopoly suppliers to domestic users, the generators have agreed to
keep their average prices in the electricity wholesale market below
certain levels and to sell off part of their generating capacity so as
to increase competition.
With the stock market looking rather groggy at the time, there was
doubt over how well the sales would go. In the event, they were well
supported, with the public offer 1.7 times subscribed, triggering
clawback arrangements from the institutional offer, which left small
shareholders with 40% of the issue.
Dealing in the new shares began on Monday, March 6, and the shares
moved to a respectable if not dramatic premium over the sale prices of
about 10% for small investors.
So the champagne bottles popped as usual in the offices of the
Government's advisers to the issue.
However, the following day, satisfaction of a job well done was
replaced by dismay and anger when the regulator, Professor Stephen
Littlechild, almost casually let it be known that he was considering a
further review of electricity prices.
The shares of all the electricity companies, needless to say, fell
sharply, including those of National Power and PowerGen.
The Treasury, officials from which could barely conceal their anger,
rushed out a statement that the professor's statement was not relevant
to the two generators and that it stood behind the prospectus as showing
an accurate description of the companies and the industry.
The advisers, Kleinwort Benson and BZW, part of Barclays Bank, quickly
recovered and played down suggestions that offended institutions would
cancel their cheques, pointing out they had entered into a binding
contract when applying for shares.
Institutions and the Association of Private Client Investment Managers
and Stockbrokers talked of suing the Government, and the Association of
British Insurers said it would liase with the Stock Exchange about an
inquiry into the matter.
In the end, however, it all appeared to blow over as the spring stock
market rally got under way, prices of electricity shares recovered, and
investors got on with buying the next share.
Now anger will be rekindled as the Government tries to wriggle off the
hook.

AN MP yesterday mounted a campaign to abolish Crown immunity, the
contentious legal doctrine which frustrated an investigation into the
#4000m power generators' sell-off.
The Stock Exchange probe into the handling of the flotation of
National Power and PowerGen hit the buffers because, under financial
law, the Government is immune from detailed investigation.
Crown immunity can allow the Government to ignore its own regulations
and protect officials from prosecution for shortcomings in areas where
private individuals could face the full rigours of the law.
Labour MP, Mr George Foulkes, said: ''The anachronism and scandal of
Crown immunity should be swept away without delay. This latest issue is
another example which cries out for its abolition.''
The scope of Crown immunity has been limited severely in recent years
after a clamour from MPs over situations where the Government, acting
with impunity, has allegedly allowed lives to be put at risk.
It is a hangover from the doctrine ''the Queen can do no wrong''. Over
the years, officialdom has sheltered behind its protection after
incidents which could otherwise have led to heavy damages, fines, or
imprisonment.
Notable cases include:
* Organisers of a Luciano Pavarotti concert in Hyde Park -- a royal
park -- in 1991, attended by the Prince of Wales and Mr John Major,
escaped legal action over allegedly serious safety shortcomings because
of Crown immunity.
* Nuclear test victims and soldiers injured in military accidents
where negligence is involved have fallen foul of the doctrine.
* Those responsible for dirty kitchens in prisons capable of causing
''a catastrophic'' outbreak of food poisoning have escaped prosecution.
* Regulations laid down in the Offices, Shops, and Railway Premises
Act have been ignored for years by the Government in certain places of
employment, including royal palaces.
* Even the existence of vermin in NHS hospital operating theatres
could once have escaped the law.
The Government was forced to reduce the scope of Crown immunity after
there was no power to enforce hygiene regulations in NHS hospitals in
the 1980s, despite patient deaths from food poisoning caused by the
state of the kitchens.
Mr Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, said: ''The
existence, even in its now more limited form, of Crown immunity is an
archaic scandal. It is something which dates back to the mists of time
and for which there never has been an excuse.
''It flouts every single canon of justice you can imagine and,
astonishingly, protects governments from their own laws and regulations
which others have to comply with on pain of punishment. It should go
now.''

THE reputation of the City of London as a place for overseas operators
to do business was shaken, albeit temporarily, following the collapse of
Barings. The furore that has erupted over the Treasury investigation
into the Government's sale of its 40% stake in the two power generation
companies National Power and Powergen threatens to reopen old wounds.
Questions will undoubtedly be asked about the competence of those
involved, at the highest level, in the running of London's financial
markets. Further damage to investor confidence, both in the UK and
overseas, could reduce the proceeds of future privatisation issues,
which are budgeted to generate #3000m for the Treasury in 1996/97 and
#2000m in 1997/98.
There is no denying the strength of feeling, among both large and
small investors at the time of flotation, that they had been treated
badly. Share shops, private individuals, and financial institutions all
considered legal action. Investors were left sitting on paper losses
following the collapse in share prices that accompanied news of
Professor Littlechild's regulatory review.
Rumours swept the City and Westminster that financial institutions,
both at home and abroad, were considering suing the Government for
issuing a false prospectus. US institutions threatened to withhold the
first instalment in the #4000m partly-paid offer.
There was a lot of huff and puff from institutions but in the end they
paid up. Close links between the Government and the London financial
community is such that it is likely there will always be a ready home
for its share issues, not least because of the knockdown prices offered
at all past privatisations.
However, it would be dangerous for the Government to adopt a similarly
cavalier attitude to overseas investors. Although Britain blazed a trail
with privatising national assets in the 1980s, other countries across
the globe have followed suit. Therefore large institutional investors
have opportunities to invest outside the UK.
The problem is that, while markets are global, regulation and
supervision remain parochial. Given the complex regulatory environment
that surrounds UK privatisations, it would not be surprising if there
was reluctance on the part of overseas investors to get involved in the
forthcoming privatisation of the British nuclear industry. As for small
private investors in the UK, they will no doubt view this as further
proof that building societies remain the best place for their money.

THE Government is in the dock yet again. This time, it stands accused
of rigging the very market it has sworn by for the last 16 years. Her
Majesty's Treasury faces allegations of insider dealing, following the
controversial sale of shares in National Power and Power Gen.
The Government is accused of withholding from the Stock Market, on the
eve of the electricity sell-off, the crucial information that the
Electricity Regulator was about to mount an inquiry into electricity
pricing. They knew that this information was price sensitive because
they took the trouble to consult Treasury solicitors as to what they
should do.
As usual, they decided to say nothing and, as usual, having now been
found out, Ministers have refused to allow an independent inquiry.
There is clearly a case to answer. If this episode hadn't involved the
Government but had involved City speculators, then there would have been
calls for immediate retribution. Even the Tories might have joined in.
But of course, the Government's main priority is not doing what may be
right by investors, or the market, but to look after its own skin.
Hence, the reluctance to hold an independent inquiry but to deal with
the matter by referring it to a Treasury Official who was ''in no way
involved'' with the sell-off.
Once again, the accused is investigating himself. The Government is
acting as judge and jury in its own cause. There must be many accused
sitting in courts up and down the land who would love to be in the same
position.
This Treasury Official will have to investigate what his colleagues
knew and when they knew it. He will have to decide whether or not there
is any culpability. Above all, he will have to decide whether or not the
Ministers who he advises are in any way to blame. To cap it all, it is
Ministers who will reveal the outcome of this investigation.
Is it any wonder that no-one has the slightest confidence in this
device to save Government face?
There are many people who believe they lost money because the
Government didn't tell them the whole truth. That is a serious
allegation that must be answered. It strikes at the integrity of
government.
The Stock Exchange has a duty to protect the market. It has an
international reputation.
If this case had involved anyone else, it would have automatically
been referred to the Securities and Investment Board or the Serious
Fraud Office for further investigation. Section 47 of the Financial
Services Act outlaws actions leading to a false impression of the value
or price of an investment.
The Chief Executive of the Stock Exchange has made it clear that he
can't proceed because the Government enjoys Crown Immunity. He asked the
Government what to do. He didn't ask the Government to investigate
itself. It is that course of action that the Government has chosen to
follow.
It's not surprising that, at every turn, the Government faces the same
problem. It has run out of good will. Quite simply, people don't trust
it. Nor do they have any confidence in the Government's ability to
investigate itself.
Alistair Darling is the Labour Party's Spokesman on the City. He has
been the MP for Edinburgh Central since 1987.

Every week about 10,500 Scotswomen submit themselves to a smear test.
Is it all worthwhile?
Alan MacDermid investigates
IT seems like almost yesterday that women throughout Britain were
gripped by the fear of cervical cancer going unchecked because of sloppy
reading of their smear tests.
Now they are being told that cytologists, possibly gripped by the fear
of being sacked, sued, or pilloried by the media, are worrying thousands
of women needlessly by erring too far on the side of safety.
The Bristol doctors who have raised this spectre in the Lancet are not
simply asserting that the pendulum has swung too far towards
over-zealousness.
Their failure to detect a noticeable drop in cervical cancer since
screening was introduced in their area has prompted them to question
whether it is all worthwhile.
They concede that after 30 years it is too late to turn the clock back
-- it would be ethically unacceptable to deprive women of the supposed
benefits by submitting the process to a random trial comparing screening
with no screening.
However, the Bristol doctors have already been accused of embarking on
screening with unrealistic expectations of what it would achieve -- the
aim, they state, was ''eradicating the 30-40 deaths each year in Bristol
from cervical cancer''.
Clearly cervical screening will not eradicate this particular cancer,
even if one leaves aside the question of false negative readings.
Treatment of pre-cancerous lesions, as they now acknowledge, does not
ensure the prevention of invasive cancer in every case.
At the same time, abnormal cells will be found in the smears of
numerous women who would never get cancer anyway. Studies have shown
that as few as 18% of women with severe abnormality will actually go on
to develop cancer. The progression to invasive cancer can take up to 15
years, or may not happen at all. You might die of old age first. Or you
might not -- and there is no way of telling which.
Is it all worthwhile? Every week about 10,500 Scotswomen submit
themselves to the well-intentioned indignity of a smear test, so that
cytologists can scan their slides for the cell changes that might be an
advance warning of cancer.
About one in 10 will be asked to undergo a repeat, and about 3% may
have to undergo a further examination, colposcopy, which may result in a
biopsy specimen being taken and/or treatment by laser, diathermy, or
cryosurgery. More serious cases may require radiotherapy.
In spite of this effort, three women die every week from cervical
cancer, but the history of the disease suggests that without screening
this figure would be nearer 16.
This means about 12-13 lives are being saved each week -- 650 every
year -- by a process which no doubt puts a lot of women to a lot of
worry which might prove unfounded. Those whose lives have been saved
would no doubt agree it is worthwhile. Those who were called for
follow-up before being given the all-clear may well have been alarmed;
equally, they may feel reassured that their health is under such ongoing
scrutiny.
Women in Greater Glasgow who are called for follow-up now receive a
leaflet explaining the implications to them. It was prepared after a
survey carried out by a research nurse, Sue Williams, who asked women
the kind of information they looked for when they were told they had an
abnormality.
Dr Gillian McIlwaine, a women's health specialist with the health
board, said: ''It is important to reassure women who are called in for
treatment that they do not have cancer, but something that could become
cancer if left untreated.''
Guidelines for cervical screening were first issued in 1960 and it has
developed from being an opportunistic service -- taking smears from
women who happened to be visiting the doctor anyway -- to a systematic
call-up and three-yearly recall covering everyone in the 20-60 age
group.
Grampian region was one of the early success stories in the first 10
years of screening, when the incidence per 100,000 of cervical cancer
fell from 32 in 1961 to 16.2 in 1971, and the death rate from 24 to
17.2.
This decline has continued throughout Scotland -- over the past 10
years it has dropped from 120 per million to 108 per million, and the
death rate from 70 to 60 per million.
''We have the evidence now that it has been a success and it will get
better,'' said Dr McIlwaine. ''In the beginning, when we were screening
opportunistically, I think we were keeping the lid on a problem which
would have got a whole lot worse otherwise. Now that we have established
a computerised call-recall system we will see the improvement growing
into the next century.
''It is not just about preventing death. As we catch the disease
earlier and earlier we are now able to minimise the damage, so that more
women are coming through this with their cervixes and wombs intact.''

From the Butcher of Moravia to Mr and Mrs Doig of Perthshire, William
Russell reports on released war records
HOW Britain sought to blame Germany for the massacre of thousands of
Polish servicemen by Stalin's executioners in April 1940 is revealed in
wartime intelligence reports released yesterday.
The NKVD, forerunner of the KGB, rounded up 22,000 Polish officers
after the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland in September 1939.
Files released at the Public Record Office tell how the bodies of
about 8000 men were discovered in a forest at Katyn, near Smolensk, in
April 1943 by German troops advancing into Russia.
More than 10,000 bodies were discovered later at two other sites.
An intelligence assessment by the Special Operations Executive, the
department set up to stimulate resistance throughout Europe, said: ''The
official line in the UK has been to pretend that the whole affair was a
fake.
''This is obviously the most convenient attitude to adopt and, if
adopted consistently enough, will doubtless receive universal
acceptance.
''Any other view would have been most distasteful to the public since
it could be inferred that we were allied to a power guilty of the same
sort of atrocities as Germany.''
The report said the balance of evidence indicated the massacre was
carried out by Moscow and that references to it in the British press had
ceased.
Intercepted German messages described how mass graves were found in
the forest, each containing up to 2500 corpses in Polish officers'
uniform, ''laid in regular rows overlapping each other in roof-tile
fashion''.
Each man had been shot through the skull with a revolver at close
range.
The SOE analyst speculated: ''If, as seems possible, the Soviets hope
to dominate Eastern Europe as a result of this war, then the social
element of which the Katyn victims consisted would have been a
considerable obstacle in the way of effective domination.''
The Soviet Union continued to deny responsibility for the massacre
until 1990, when unchallengeable evidence that it was carried out on
direct orders from Stalin was discovered in KGB archives.
A mysterious affair of intrigue in war-time Perthshire is also
revealed in the records.
The documents cover the SOE's activities in central and eastern Europe
but a couple known only as Mr and Mrs Doig operated nearer home. The
unanswered question is whether they were spies, or just two unfortunate
evacuees who fell victim to the paranoia of the time.
A letter, dated August 7, 1943, was sent by MPG, a Captain C T Gregor,
a training office in the Polish section, to somebody identified only as
D/CE2.
Captain Gregor asked D/CE2 if he would inquire into the bona fides of
a man and woman reported to him through a senior Polish officer who was
introduced to the couple by a Mr Adamson, Adyline, Blairgowrie,
Perthshire.
''He was given to understand that they were evacuees from London,''
Captain Gregor wrote. ''For your information, they both speak German
fluently; their name and address is: Mr and Mrs Doig, Denhead, Cupar,
Angus, Perthshire (sic). I should be glad if you will let me know your
feeling as soon as possible as these people are in contact with many of
your students in Scotland.''
The file, however, does not contain D/CE2's reply and it is probably
impossible to trace given the way the SOE kept its records. Mr and Mrs
Doig may have been spies. They may just have been unlucky. They may
never have known that the security service was investigating them.
The papers also reveal that not all of those the SOE tried to help
appreciated their efforts. The Czechs were highly critical. In one
document sent in March 1942, a Czech colonel passed what are noted as
''very caustic remarks'' about British inter-departmental intrigue being
''undignified''.
The Czechs also got very upset over a mission, code name Plutonium.
The SOE report says ''we had a pistol pointed at us by the Czechs''
after an American officer with two Colts slung at the hip boarded the
plane before take off.
There is also a letter which reveals that, in July 1944, the Polish
Secret Army had laid its hands on one of Germany's V2 rockets.
An operation was laid on to bring it back to Britain but there are no
further details in the file.

<RECORDNO>977961134</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE release of Private Lee Clegg without the freeing of Irish
political prisoners in Northern Ireland would harm the peace process,
Prime Minister John Major was warned last night.
Irish Premier John Bruton challenged Mr Major to change the laws on
remission to enable dozens of Republicans held for terrorist offences to
be let out of jail.
He took the opportunity to discuss the Clegg affair over cocktails at
the Elysee Palace in Paris before a meeting of EU leaders called by
President Chirac.
Mr Bruton warned Mr Major against creating a divisive sense that there
is one law for the security forces and another for everyone else.
''It would be bad for the peace process,'' said the Irish leader.
Mr Bruton wants a change in British jails to increase the maximum
permitted remission from 33% to 50%, enabling the immediate release of
many political prisoners serving lengthy prison terms.
As he went in to last night's talks, Mr Bruton insisted that the
release of republican and other political prisoners would need the right
legal framework: ''I would not enter into a trade-off. The law is the
law. Each case must be looked at on its merits.''
Nevertheless, he made it clear to Mr Major that if Clegg is freed
early, it will send the wrong signal while Irish prisoners languish in
jail in Northern Ireland.
''It would create a sense of one law for members of the security
forces and another law for everybody else. It would be bad for the peace
process,'' Mr Bruton told reporters.
''London must take account of the detrimental impact on public opinion
of any early release for Private Lee Clegg without early release for
republicans.''
Mr Bruton suggested that an Order in Council would be one way of
adjusting current practice on remission in UK jails and said it would
now be ''reasonable'' for Britain to follow the republic's example and
release prisoners early after eight months of peace.
Mr Bruton first raised the issue of Private Clegg with Mr Major during
Second World War commemorations in Moscow last month.
Last night, he not only raised it at the Elysee Palace but insisted he
would be having similar talks with Mr Major at the EU summit in Cannes
at the end of this month. He said he would keep the pressure on the
British Government until the issue was resolved.
There were no plans last night for a private UK-Irish discussion on
the sidelines of the EU dinner being hosted by President Chirac.
However, Mr Bruton took full advantage of the informal cocktail
get-together before dinner to deliver his message to Mr Major.
Earlier this week, the Northern Ireland Life Sentence Review Board
considered his case but he may have to wait up to four weeks to find out
if he will be freed from Wakefield Prison where he is currently being
held.
The board has passed its decision to Northern Ireland Secretary Sir
Patrick Mayhew.
Clegg, 26, was jailed for life for the murder of Karen Reilly, 19,
shot dead in the passenger seat of a stolen car in West Belfast in
September 1990.

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>977961135</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT-backed environmental scheme to protect some endangered
Scottish bird species could fail because of underfunding, it was claimed
yesterday.
The Wildlife Habitat Creation Scheme was set up to encourage the
creation of new wetland areas to attract wading birds, such as snipe,
and redshank.
The project is part of a Scottish Office initiative to persuade
farmers to take arable land out of production and create the much-needed
wildlife habitats.
However, Nicola Penford, a farm conservation adviser with agricultural
charity Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group (FWAG), claimed: ''The
scheme has not been sufficiently funded and the uptake among farmers has
been relatively slow.''
FWAG was involved in the development of one of Scotland's first
wetlands site at East Cairnhill Farm, Insch, Aberdeenshire.
She said: ''Wetlands are a very important habitat but, due to
drainage, many have been lost, with a subsequent drastic decline in
birds that were once common on farms in Grampian.''
The scheme provides annual payments of #135 an acre to farmers to take
land out of production and flood them to create a wildlife habitat
suitable for wetland birds.
The two-and-a-half acre East Cairnhill site was ideal for the scheme
because it was affected by poor drainage.
The field will be flooded using a pipe to divert water from a nearby
burn after being resown with a special grass mixture, which will provide
food and nesting cover for a variety of birds.
Miss Penford added: ''One of the reasons for the lack of interest is
that we have to compete with the kind of profits that can be made by
keeping the land in production.
''Farmers have to commit themselves to taking the land out of
production for up to 20 years. Agriculture is in such a state of flux at
the moment that farmers are not willing to commit their land in the long
term.
''The scheme only applies to land which is currently in production and
we have raised concerns that payments are not sufficient for a large
number of farmers.''
RSPB conservation officer for Grampian, Dr Ian Francis, feared that
lack of interest in the scheme could see the end of rare species of
wetland waders.
''While we are very supportive of the Habitats Scheme in principle, we
are talking about major losses of wetland areas in Grampian.
''The situation is already very serious. Away from the nature
reserves, the future for these species is pretty bleak.
''According to our research work, wading birds like the redshank are
becoming endangered species. There are only 150 breeding pairs of
redshank left in Grampian.''
Arable farmers would probably want double the price per acre offered
under the Government-backed wetland scheme, he said.
''The problem is common to the whole of Scotland but is accentuated in
Grampian because it has one of the lowest annual rainfalls in the
country.

<HEADLINE>Train driver blamed for head-on death crash</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977961136</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BLAME for the head-on Cowden rail crash in which five people died was
yesterday laid wholly on a train driver who went through a danger signal
on a single-track line.
But two-way radios, promised for the Cowden line but not introduced
because of a ''funding hiatus'', could have prevented the Kent accident,
the official report by the Railway Inspectorate added.
Report inspector Major Kit Holden was critical of the lack of progress
made on improving crashworthiness of old trains and the fitting of train
protections systems to prevent drivers going through stop signals.
The driver, Brian Barton, 31 -- who died in the accident in October
1994 -- may also have been distracted by having his guard with him in
the cab, said the report.
The guard, Jonathan Brett-Andrews, was also killed as was the driver
of the other train and two passsengers. Mr Brett-Andrews had three times
been found in cabs and had been given a final warning about this illegal
practice in February 1994, the report said.
There has been a suggestion that Mr Brett-Andrews was actually behind
the controls of the train from Uckfield, East Sussex, which crashed into
one coming from Oxted in Surrey.
The trains should have passed at a loop in the line but, with the
northbound train going through a stop signal, the two met head-on about
300 yards south of Cowden station.
Major Holden said he would make his judgment about who was actually at
the controls after the inquest into the Cowden deaths.
Major Holden, the assistant chief inspecting officer of railways, said
that, in this instance, it did not matter who was actually at the
controls and that Mr Barton was in charge of the driving of the train.
''I conclude therefore that Driver Barton is wholly responsible for
the accident,'' said Major Holden.
The report said that with no way of contacting the two drivers, a
signalman at Oxted, alerted by an alarm sounding in his box, was
powerless to help.
The report said the signalman reckoned that if two-way radios were in
operation he could have warned the drivers in time as they were about a
mile-and-a-half apart when the alarm sounded.
Among Major Holden's recommendations were:
* Two-way radios should be completed for the whole of the former
Network SouthEast routes;
* There should be more widespread use of Automatic Train Protection
systems which are in use on only two lines;
* An urgent research programme should be undertaken into improving
crashworthiness of older designs of rolling stock;
* A programme for fitting more trains with On Train Monitor and
Recorder systems (the equivalent of an aircraft ''black box'' flight
recorder) be drawn up. Neither of the Cowden trains had such a system.
Major Holden said there appeared to be ''no intention to implement a
programme for the installation of measures to improve the
crashworthiness of rolling stock having a life of over eight years, and
a network-wide fitting of Automatic Train Protection is not
contemplated''.
He went on: ''There is therefore no concerted programme to reduce the
likelihood of fatalities or injuries in accidents involving older
designs of rolling stock.
''I do not believe that this situation is acceptable now any more than
it was in 1989, when Sir Anthony Hidden made his report into the Clapham
rail crash.''
Both BR and Railtrack said they would study the recommendations, some
of which had already been implemented.
Lew Adams, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said
it was ''disgraceful'' that one of the drivers had been held responsible
for the accident.
''It would never have occurred if a cost-driven decision had not been
taken by BR to reduce the track at Cowden to single line,'' said Mr
Adams, who welcomed the two-way radio recommendation.
The family of driver Brian Barton, who originally came from Glasgow
and lived in Croydon at the time of the accident, asked Network
SouthCentral to act as their spokesperson.
In a brief statement, the rail company said yesterday: ''This is a
particularly sad time for the family and they would like their privacy
to be respected.''
A number of technical and operational measures were introduced
throughout Britain following the fatal rail accidents at Newton and
Bellgrove in Glasgow in which train drivers were also found to have
passed through red lights.
Four people were killed in the Newton accident in 1991 and two people
died and more than 50 were injured in the Bellgrove crash in 1989.
Railtrack in Scotland said yesterday that, following the introduction
of a risk assessment strategy, one measure was the introduction of
''double blocking'' -- a second set of warning lights -- at all
single-lead junctions and all junctions regarded as dangerous or where
Signals Passed At Danger (SPAD) incidents occur.
A spokeswoman said yesterday: ''These measures were introduced as a
result of the two Glasgow accidents and the risk has been substantially
reduced, but we are constantly looking at ways of improving our
signalling and safety.''
Another measure, which will comprise a further set of flashing lights
at dangerous junctions to warn drivers who have passed red lights, is to
be introduced from this autumn.

BILL McMurdo, football agent and scourge of club managers and
directors, is poised to invade rugby union.
Mr McMurdo believes the sport will be professional well before the
next World Cup, and that there will be a significant role for him to
play.
He plans to take up an invitation to visit South Africa next week for
the final stages of the World Cup, irrespective of Scotland's continued
participation.
''I wanted to go last week, but couldn't, because of commitments,'' he
said. ''But I hope to go now, as part of my rugby learning curve.''
Mr McMurdo, who has handled many of football's leading players,
including George Best, and who numbers masterminding the move of Maurice
Johnston to Rangers among his achievements, is convinced that several of
the current Scotland XV have a lucrative career ahead of them.
He believes that if he had been able to act for Scotland captain Gavin
Hastings for the last five years he could have made him a millionaire.
However, he has identified Craig Chalmers and Gregor Townsend as
Scottish rugby's likely first candidates for commercial stardom.
''I believe they both have a great commercial future,'' he said.
''I've had my eye on rugby for five years, and will be ready when the
time comes -- I expect that to be within the next four years. There are
people in the sport whom I have worked with here, quietly, for several
years, and also in French rugby.''
He is unconcerned that rugby is sure to welcome agents even less
enthusiastically than football.
He said: ''I have been through all the obstructions you can imagine
over the years, and not just in football -- bowls too. They did not not
put me off.
''Yes, it is a whole new ball game for me, but I can assure you I will
not be going into the sport cold, just because I've been a football
agent for 17 years.
''Rupert Murdoch will determine what goes on in union, because of what
he is doing with league and satellite TV. Union will also become a
travelling circus.
''I can see a European Nations' Cup, and the game at club level will
change radically. There will be many parallels with football, with
financially weaker clubs suffering.
''I reckon if the rules had been different, and I'd got hold of Gavin
Hastings five years ago, I would have made him a millionaire by now. For
him, the commercial opportunities would have been tremendous. He has
done very well anyway, given the strictures of the prevailing climate in
rugby.
''Even after his retirement, there will still be great opportunities,
but he works with a company well aware of these things -- perhaps he
will become an agent himself.''

<HEADLINE>Three years for woman who abducted baby from hospital</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977961138</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
GRANDMOTHER Susan Brooke was jailed for three years yesterday after
abducting a new-born baby from a hospital maternity unit when her
husband gave her an ultimatum 14 months into a ''fantasy pregnancy''.
The 39-year-old grandmother and mother of three smuggled baby Lydia
Owens out of the maternity ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan,
North Wales, in a duffel bag after her husband, Phillip, told her: ''If
you haven't had the baby by the weekend I'll drag you up to the
hospital.''
Brooke, of Grosvenor Avenue, Rhyl, Clwyd, pleaded guilty at Chester
Crown Court to abducting Lydia on February 10 and to bigamously marrying
Mr Brooke on November 5, 1993, while still married to her third husband.
Jailing her for two-and-a-half years for the abduction and a
consecutive six months for bigamy, judge Mr Justice Scott Baker told
her: ''You are an accomplished, manipulative and determined liar and
somehow succeeded in persuading those close to you first that you were
pregnant and then that you had given birth.
''I am satisfied that you planned the abduction of this child with
some care. You are not mentally ill. You bear complete responsibility
for what you did, and what you did was both cruel and wicked.''
He said a report on Lydia's mother, Mrs Christine Owens, now suffering
from post traumatic stress, made it clear that she was finding it
difficult to resume her role as an ordinary mother.
Mr Robin Spencer, prosecuting, told the court that Lydia was born to
Mrs Owens, 32, and husband Michael, 38, of Hospital Road, Llandudno, on
Tuesday, February 7. She was their third child and weighed 6 pounds 11
ounces.
Brooke had managed to dupe husband Phillip and others close to her
that she was pregnant with twins, though she had been sterilised after
the birth of youngest daughter Joanne, now 16, in 1978.
The length of the pregnancy had become a standing joke between Mr
Brooke and one of his friends, and he had finally given her an ultimatum
that she must produce the babies that weekend or their relationship
would end.
Brooke went to the hospital on the evening of Friday, February 10, and
struck up a conversation with Mrs Owens, asking to see the baby. After
being shown the child and saying she was ''lovely'', she took Mrs Owens
to a day room, leaving Lydia fast asleep in her cot.
She eventually said she was going to the toilet and would be back in a
minute, but never returned. She went back on to the ward, removed Lydia
from her cot and smuggled her out of hospital in a canvas rucksack.
He said that when Mrs Owens returned to the ward at about 8.35pm, she
realised Lydia was missing and became hysterical. Police were informed
at 8.52pm and launched a hunt involving road blocks, tracker dogs, a
helicopter, and fire brigade thermal imaging equipment as well as media
appeals.
Acting on a tip off, police had gone to the Brooke family's bungalow
at 4.35pm on Saturday afternoon.
When the police went inside, Brooke broke down crying and admitted:
''It's here -- I shouldn't have taken it. I've done it no harm as you
can see. I was afraid my husband was going to leave me. That's why I
took the baby. I'm sorry.''
Mr Spencer said the baby had been unharmed and was reunited with her
parents.
Mr Spencer said there was evidence that Brooke had visited the
hospital before the abduction. He said that the police accepted her
husband believed she was pregnant.
When interviewed by police she had said: ''I don't know why I did it.
I've got grandchildren, I've got children. I love children. I wouldn't
have ever harmed her.''
Mr Gordon Cole, defending, said Brooke's own background was nothing
short of tragic, describing her unhappy childhood and a history of drink
and violence towards her in her own marriages.

THE Prime Minister yesterday dismissed as ''silly hysteria'' the
furore over the privatisation of the two national power generating
companies, despite a warning from the chairman of the London Stock
Exchange that the City's reputation as a financial centre had been
seriously damaged.
But Mr Major also made it clear that the Treasury was not ''beyond the
law'' and could be prosecuted for insider dealing if it emerged the
Government had known about plans to re-examine the power industry's
pricing structure on the eve of its flotation in March.
The controversy flared with Thursday's announcement that the Treasury
had been asked by the Stock Exchange to re-examine the circumstances
surrounding the sale. The issue led to tense exchanges in the Commons
yesterday after Labour forced an emergency debate.
Ministers lined up to deny any wrong-doing on the part of the
Government over the #4000m sale of the Government's remaining shares in
National Power and PowerGen, and promised the Treasury's investigation
would be made public.
But Mr Major criticised the Opposition's reaction. ''I have seen some
very hysterical comments. I do think the hysteria with which this has
been greeted is quite extraordinary,'' he said on BBC Wales television.
2 of the two companies in March this year.
Labour claims the Government knew that industry regulator Stephen
Littlechild was planning a price clampdown, but kept quiet in an attempt
to raise the maximum amount possible for the Treasury from the sale.
The Stock Exchange's inquiry into the sale has been blocked by
financial legislation which excludes Government departments from the
reach of the regulatory bodies.
On Thursday night the Stock Exchange made public its concerns by
releasing a letter to Treasury Permanent Secretary Sir Terry Burns
requesting an investigation.
Labour yesterday demanded that the entire Government privatisation
programme, including the sale of Scottish Nuclear, be suspended pending
an independent inquiry.
Responding to the emergency debate in the Commons yesterday, Treasury
Minister Sir George Young rejected suggestions that the Government had
acted improperly and accused Labour of ''a great deal of misinformed,
inaccurate, and hysterical comment''.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown demanded an investigation by the
Serious Fraud Office and the Securities and Investment Board and a full
independent inquiry chaired by a judge. ''When serious charges are made
about the Treasury, no-one will agree that the Treasury should be put in
charge of investigating the Treasury,'' he said.
The Serious Fraud Office said it was looking at allegations contained
in papers sent to it by Labour, but no formal inquiry was under way.

TO THE English settlers in this region of France who come to her farm
she was simply ''The Duck Lady''. She didn't have a name except Madame.
Long past normal retiral age she farmed ducks and kept a few geese and
hens as well. If that wasn't enough to keep her going, she looks after
her elderly mother, 95 years of age, who lives in what in Scots farms
would be the grieve's house.
Those who came and went for the eggs, ducks, foie gras were treated
with courtesy, which seemed to come from the fact she had all the time
in the world, whereas she must have had a punishing dawn-to-dusk
schedule. A coffee or an eau de vie would be proffered on our occasional
visits to buy a duck and we were sometimes given a bonus to take home in
the form of stewed wild boar.
In a part of France where patois is the first language and French is
the second, it was a rare delight to find someone who would take time to
talk to an indifferent French speaker. I learned not only her name but
that she knew herself what it was to be an outsider. Her father was
Italian and in the early years of the century encountered in France the
kind of anti-foreigner feelings upon which the egregious Le Pen
capitalises today.
The last time I called at her farm was a few days ago. I could tell
there was something wrong. Was it something I had said or not said? I
couldn't discern why the atmosphere in the house had changed. She and
her husband seemed ill at ease, their greeting hollow. I found out two
days later when a neighbour called with the news. Their son had been
found shot dead in his home in the town.
Then I guessed what had happened. His death was suicide as a result of
depression and in the days preceding the fatal shot, his parents knew of
this danger and had been living with it, dreading the moment which came
in the early hours of the morning.
He was buried the day after. Not in indecent haste but because that is
the way things happen here. However, nothing can hurry the grieving of
that family in which four generations mourn -- his parents, grandmother,
a brother, and his children from a marriage which ended in divorce.
Thinking of people as ''Duck Ladies'' and window cleaners or stair
ladies is apt to rebound upon us. When tragedy enters their lives it
leads to a shock that they are human with lives of their own. Perhaps we
ought to be ashamed that we define people by their occupations, but it
is easily done. Some countries enter occupations in the phone book. I
believe Sweden has ended the practice, but I suppose it helped to
distinguish between all those Svenssons. However, it is of dubious use
in a society in which unemployment is high. Imagine the phone book in an
unemployment blackspot.
''Is that welder Docherty?''
''No, I'm, his son, YTS Docherty, but he's lost his job and he's
retraining as an electrician. Do you still want me to get him?''
I am ashamed to say that as for years I only knew our stair lady as
Mary. When she was seriously ill I did not know where to send a card.
During my formative years in Dundee the ''Kleeneze'' man called
regularly at our home. He didn't have a name. We just called him the
Kleeneze man, and when I bumped into him years later in Dundee I was
embarrassed by not even being able to address him by name.
You may not think the above is of any importance. But the more I think
about it, I believe it is. It is not necessary for personal intimacies
to be explored between services personnel and those they serve. But
allowing the job or the uniform to obscure the human being can hardly be
healthy for any society. People then become functions, one step away
from objects.
This brings me back to that suicide in the small French town near
which I am staying at present. Today, the day after the funeral, the
lady of whom I spoke will be back feeding her ducks. Her ceaseless round
demands to be fulfilled. Time and tide and nature, wait for no-one.
As well as a tendency to avoid exchanging names, we also have a
tendency to avoid people who are grieving. They seldom volunteer the
information. Grief is a personal matter but not necessarily a private
one and we often hide behind privacy as a cloak for our inability to
cope with other people's grief. Other great rites of passage such as
birth or marriage are matters for open discussion, but seldom so
bereavement.
It is conceivable someone would offer an excuse to their boss for
their work being below par that their new baby was not settling well or
that their wedding plans were in disarray. Yet most people shrink from
what is often a very real reason for being below par -- that they are
hurting so hard it is impossible to concentrate.
There are thousands of people in that position in Scotland this very
morning. Time will heal their hurt in most cases but at this moment they
don't feel the truth of that. They don't want to suffer alone. They
don't want promiscuous conversations about their grief. Indeed they
often don't know what they want -- except to turn the clock back. It is
worth asking whether it is a worse sin to keep people at a distance
because we think of them simply as a function or to keep them at a
distance because we are uneasy with their grief. Yet there are two
simple ways of helping both situations in a tiny but significant way.
First, get their name. Secondly, send them a card with an appropriate
message. It doesn't cost very much and I'm willing to bet most people
reading this know someone who would appreciate the thought.

IT MUST be a rare event for a Conservative administration to find
itself at loggerheads with the Stock Exchange, but Mr Major's Government
achieved that distinction because of the circumstances surrounding the
sale of the state's remaining stake in the two English electricity
generating companies. That sale was offered on misleading terms, for the
industry's regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, announced just
after it that he intended to review his recommendations for the
industry, although these had been completed some months previously. Just
how far in advance of the public announcement the Government knew
Professor Littlechild's intentions is not clear, but the original
assumptions of a very brief notice and an ambiguous hint now need to be
qualified by evidence which suggests that there may have been a week's
notice. The ambiguity remains: Professor Littlechild does not come out
of this affair very well himself, though the reaction of some
electricity supply companies in declaring rebates to customers has gone
some way to vindicating his judgment that he had severely underestimated
the industry's profitability in his first recommendations.
The Government did not take the hint, for it would then have had to
suspend the flotation. It would have had to settle for a lower price, as
well as incurring two sets of costs which would have been substantial in
a #4000m exercise. Instead it saved itself a great deal of money by
passing these charges on to the buyers, who almost immediately found
their shares going to a discount. Buyers were understandably not
pleased. Nor were existing shareholders in the generators and the
electricity suppliers whose share prices were immediately adversely
affected by Professor Littlechild's declaration of intent (which is to
be given substance later this month).
The Stock Exchange wants the Treasury to examine this incident
further. What a wider public concern demands is a formal and independent
inquiry into the whole affair. Had anybody other than the state sold
securities in the knowledge that their valuation would almost at once be
affected by news of which it was already in possession, it would have
been accused of issuing a false prospectus or of insider trading. The
matter is thus very serious and although the Treasury is convinced it
would not be faced with any prosecution even if it did not enjoy
immunity (and has had that opinion reinforced by the advice of
independent counsel) not everyone else is convinced. The Opposition, not
normally sympathetic to the anguish of participants who lose out in
privatisations, is right to back the Stock Exchange. Many investors feel
they have been cheated, and by the very last body which they would have
imagined would do so, the Government itself. Of course many blame the
regulator too, but the actual timing of the offer and his proposals need
open examination. Investors may feel they are entitled to some
compensation which, given the partly-paid nature of the stock sold,
could be easily accomplished by reducing the amount of the subsequent
instalments.
This may turn out to be the last privatisation carried out by the
Conservatives. The Post Office seems likely to survive as a public
enterprise; the railways increasingly look likely to enjoy a similar
future. Regulation should not be unpredictable. In public utility
pricing, no matter if privately owned, the regulatory authorities should
ensure consumers are fairly treated but that the future capital needs of
the businesses are not prejudiced. This case raises more precise legal
questions, and these are not addressed by cosy internal reassurances of
good intention.

FIRST there is the law, then there is the spirit of the law. The law
is informed by absolute values and democracy and the spirit of the law
is sweetened by common humanity and a desire to do right. On the
information available on the Government's attitude to the dependents of
those senior intelligence officials killed on a bleak Scottish hill last
year, the letter of the law is all that matters. The memorial service
for those killed in the helicopter crash in the Mull of Kintyre was held
a few days ago. All of those on board were involved in the fight against
terrorism in Northern Ireland and they were all on duty, travelling to a
security conference in Inverness. Now it seems likely that the
dependents of those who died will receive the minimum sum of money which
the Ministry of Defence can be forced to disburse. Although this has not
been announced officially it is not difficult to calculate. Every time
an ordinary citizen flies in a commercial aircraft the compensation
which will be paid if the plane crashes (or even if they lose their
luggage) is laid down by the Warsaw Convention.
Those who have lost luggage will know that the compensation is not
generous. The sum currently paid to the victim of a crash is around
#100,000, yet if any of the Mull of Kintyre dead had been killed by
terrorists, or had perished in a car, the compensation would have been
more substantial. It is possible to look at the sum of #100,000 and
think that it is a large sum of money. Indeed it is, but the
intelligence personnel who died in the helicopter crash were, first,
flying while on duty, and secondly, people who had sacrificed much of
their personal lives for the cause of security in Northern Ireland. They
were all engaged in risky work. In the context of a terrorist conflict
that means that their families were also at risk. Long hours and danger
were common to their working conditions. All of them were senior and
well-paid officers and in normal circumstances their dependents could
have expected compensation in line with expected earnings in the future.
Set against the greed which is evident in many areas of public life
and, indeed, the record of the Ministry of Defence as a profligate
waster of taxpayers' money on the grandest scale, the apparent level of
planned compensation to the helicopter victims is miserliness
personified. Put simply, they are being treated as if they were ordinary
passengers on an ordinary civilian aircraft. In fact they were
extraordinary passengers on dangerous duty in a military helicopter and
engaged on the duties of the state. The very fact that several of the
relatives have made public their anger is a sure indication of how deep
feelings are running. The ham-fisted thinking process which has led to
this state of affairs could be the work of Ministry of Defence officials
who are acquainted only with regulations and who do not have the
ability, or the seniority, to rise above them. Against this is the
evidence that some of the families felt disquiet at the way matters were
being handled by the Ministry of Defence last year, and that one at
least raised the issue with the Prime Minister when he visited Belfast
for a memorial service for the victims. We are told frequently by the
Government that those who achieve remarkable things deserve rewards in
proportion. We agree. The difference is that they are talking about
Cedric Brown, while we refer to the victims of the Mull of Kintyre.

THREE appeal judges, including the Lord President Lord Hope, yesterday
reserved their decision in a council's appeal to condemn gourmet cheese
as a health hazard.
Clydesdale District Council took Mr Humphrey Errington before a
Justice of the Peace, claiming batches of his Lanark Blue cheese were
unfit for consumption because of contamination with listeria.
Mr Errington, who farms near Dunsyre, in Lanarkshire, had 44 batches
declared potentially hazardous. However, the JP was ruled by Lord Weir
at the Court of Session to have been wrong in refusing cross-examination
of key witnesses.
Lord Weir ruled the JP's decision be set aside and any future hearing
be heard by an experienced sheriff.
The council challenged the decision at the Court of Session and
yesterday the judges agreed to reserve their decision for two weeks.

LOVELY WITCHES, a play by Moya O'Shea (R4) made comfortable listening,
not because it made you recognise the funny truths of women agonising
over their relationships -- which it was trying to do -- but because the
experience was akin to sitting under an eternal hairdryer with nothing
to read but a story written by Anna Raeburn attempting Weldon wit,
fuelled by the insights of Cosmopolitan magazine and wackily in love
with its own banality.
If this play were a woman she would be the kind who says
sententiously, ''Well, we've all been there, haven't we?'' when you have
bugger all in common.
Annie narrates the love agonies of her friends, wondering (in company
with this listener) why it is assumed that she has the answers to
relationship dilemmas.
They say things to her like ''How do you get to be so smart?'' -- but,
you see, she doesn't feel smart, though she does her best to fulfil her
role as intuitive agony aunt (I'm, just quoting the Radio Times there)
as marriages fail around her and romantic hopes are dashed.
Distinctions are made between acquaintances and friends: the former
call, the latter drop in. Now there's an aphorism to make you sit up and
drink. And, sisters, remember there is a difference between being in
love, and being in love with the idea of being in love. A searing
observation which I seem to remember reading in the Jackie circa 1965.
I'm not mocking the subject matter, but the self-congratulatory tone
of limp writing patting itself on the back. I would have had a better
time phoning my friends. Or my acquaintances, even.
Radio Scotland's Storyline Extra this week consisted of four excellent
stories by women writers 1890-1920. These were to be savoured with the
phone off the hook, and I considered myself lucky that I could listen to
them on cassette, because they went out at twenty to seven in the
evening, a time when, like a lot of folk, I am too busy surrendering to
the additive demands of small people and I would have hated to have
missed this feast.
Virgin Soil by George Egerton (pen-name of Australia writer Mary
Chavelta Dunne) chillingly caught the human cost of marrying young girls
off in total ignorance of sexuality: signing the marriage contract when
they had not been taught the language in which the deal was so
hypocritically couched. Wantin' a Hand by Lorna Moon, beautifully read
by Pauline Knowles, described a broken soul whose descent into hell was
as arbitrary and cruel as an accident: a threshing machine mangling a
life.
The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman caught, in its
tracing of a young woman's nervous breakdown, the weird release of
madness after the misery of an impossibly constrained life. And
Katherine Mansfield's A Dill Pickle brought the vagaries of the romantic
heart into limpid subtle view.
Sounds so grim in paraphrase, doesn't it? But these were women's woes
explored with artfulness and craft. And like the actor on a high after
performing Lear, minutes after holding the dead Cordelia in his arms, we
feel the black depths and are heartily cheered up.
Same thing happens listening to Spalding Gray (Shades of Gray, R3).
What a w*** he would be were he not something of a genius, for he simply
talks to himself about himself.
Like Jane Austen, he knows his patch, and his patch is his oral
biography: he is a soul ''ruled by regret'' talking his audience through
his internal memory film.
An early monologue he called Sex and Death to the Age of Fifteen --
which mostly covered masturbation and the demise of his goldfish.
Depends how you tell it -- that's where smart comes in.

<HEADLINE>Council takes desirable approach to combat the anti-social tenants</HEADLINE>

ONE of Scotland's most rural local authorities believes it has found a
solution to anti-social tenants by providing them with a better
environment.
Perth and Kinross District Council has battled for years with the pain
of possessing Europe's most socially deprived housing scheme.
Now it has replaced its ''war zones'' and slums with des-res addresses
and adopted a ''start from scratch'' initiative within a package of
measures to cope with problem families.
While neighbouring Dundee rounds up anti-social families into a social
training ground rimmed by high fences, Perth's council landlords are
taking an alternative lead.
A multi-million pound environmental and renovation project has already
turned the city's squalid Hunter Crescent into an award-winning housing
scheme where people are queuing up to get in. Similar improvements are
transforming the drab tenements in North Muirton.
Now those pilot schemes could provide the lead for problem areas
elsewhere in the district.
Flats lay empty in Old Mill Road, Rattray -- a strawberry field lined
lane in a small Perthshire village -- after tenant warfare turned the
area into a ''war zone''. It left the council with a housing headache as
no-one wanted to live in the 11 flats vacated as a result of the
conflict.
''People who moved out all stated they would happily have lived there
if it wasn't for the anti-social tenants and the warfare of two
families,'' Conservative councillor Colin Rhind, told his fellow members
last January.
It's an opinion he still holds as the council attacks the problem.
''If you get one or two problem families in one area, then you get all
types of other problems. It doesn't go away when these tenants are
evicted, because they just move to another area.
''Only one set of tenants are left in the problem flats in Rattray and
we have set up plans to tidy the area and will involve rehousing the
problem families separately elsewhere.
''It's then up to us to select the right type of people to create a
community.''
Three months ago, two Labour councillors proposed a hard-line approach
to the tenant problem.
Councillors Jack Kelly and John Flynn called for the use of court
interdicts to restrain anti-social tenants who, they claim, have caused
''distress, intimidation, and harassment''.
''We realise that the use of interdicts by themselves are not a
panacea in dealing with the problem of anti-social tenants,'' said Mr
Kelly. ''But if they are used as part of a package of measures such as
vetting applicants, probationary tenancies, and housing department
liaison, they can used effectively to restrain the behaviour of
anti-social tenants.''
Their proposals now form part of a council package to deal with
anti-social behaviour.
Assistant housing director Ron Ashton told The Herald: ''Each problem
may be different, so we have armed ourselves with a whole package of
measures such as closer police liaison and application vetting with the
primary aim to remove conflict where it exists by whatever means are
appropriate to the individual circumstances.
''Renovations and enhancements to deprived areas are an important
ingredient but such initiatives have to be community led.''
Mr Flynn said education had to be a priority in tackling the issue of
anti-social tenants, which were as much a problem in rural Scotland as
in the urban areas of Stirling, Dundee, or Glenrothes.

<TEXT>
THE Maxwell trial was adjourned yesterday after a lawyer slumped over
his courtroom desk and said he could not go on.
After an hour cross-examining pensions administrator Trevor Cook, Mr
Michael Hill QC put his hand to his head and told Mr Justice Phillips:
''I'm sorry, this is simply not going to work.''
As the court rose at the Old Bailey, Mr Hill slumped to his desk.
After a brief adjournment, his junior, Mr James Richardson, said he
was unable to continue.
The jury of seven men and five women returned to court to be told by
the judge: ''Mr Hill was not feeling well when we started this morning,
he valiantly did his best to carry on. He is simply unable to continue,
I have told him he can go home.''
Jurors were then sent away until Tuesday.
On trial are the two youngest sons of Robert Maxwell, Kevin and Ian,
and two former financial advisers, Mr Larry Trachtenberg and Mr Robert
Bunn.
All four deny conspiracy to defraud pension scheme trustees and
beneficiaries by misusing #22m worth of shares in the Israeli
pharmaceutical company Teva in a bid to prop up the crumbling Maxwell
empire in the days after the tycoon's death at sea in November, 1991.
Mr Kevin Maxwell alone denies a similar charge of conspiring with his
father to defraud the pension funds of #100m worth of shares in another
Israeli company by using them to pay off private Maxwell company debts.
Before the adjournment, Mr Hill was cross-examining Mr Cook about the
Teva shares.
Mr Cook had denied he had known for months that the shares were with
brokers and no longer in the safe keeping of a firm of Israeli lawyers.
Mr Hill, who represents Mr Trachtenberg, had begun the day by asking
Mr Cook whether he understood that the Department of Trade and Industry
inquiry into Mirror Group Newspapers was not completed.
Mr Cook agreed he was aware of the position.

It's a piper's dream and just what the doctor ordered. ROB ADAMS
visits Glenuig's new village hall.
THE view over the bay from the front door of the new village hall
would make a great postcard -- and if such an idea were deemed
profitable, I wouldn't bet against the go-ahead Glenuig Community
Association taking it up.
Already this enterprising group has launched a cassette and CD of
musical highlights from the Tenth Glenuig Festival to raise funds to
ensure that, now their hall is open, that view -- and the hall's other
facilities -- will be appreciated by as many people as possible as often
as possible.
The story of Glenuig's village hall is one of selfless hard graft,
endless form-filling, patience, and rancour. It is also a tale of rural
regeneration.
Thirty years ago the village was reachable only on foot, on horseback,
or by boat. The road linking it to Acharacle and Ardnamurchan opened in
1966. Two years later the village school closed.
By the early seventies, Glenuig was a village of holiday homes -- for
hardy holidaymakers. There was no electricity until 1982, and this in a
village some 30 minutes by car from Fort William.
This image of an apparent backwater notwithstanding, Glenuig has a
long history of music-making, and as a social centre. Tales are told of
people from miles around traipsing over the hills to the old Glenuig
village hall for the dancing on a Friday evening. As they crested those
hills they would hear the pipers, who would then pipe them into the hall
-- and the revelry would last all weekend.
The piping tradition continues. Picture the scene in Glenuig Inn on a
Saturday night recently: the television is switched off so that the
pipes can be played and passed round. Among the players is Allan
MacDonald, a piper of world-wide renown -- one of a local family whose
piping skills go back generations, and whose brother, Iain, currently
plays with top Scottish folk exports, the Battlefield Band.
The MacDonalds are not the only local musicians who have taken their
skills on to the world stage. Mouth-music singer Michala Rowan is
another, and there are several young singers featured on the Glenuig
Festival cassette and CD (also featuring Michael Marra and the Easy
Club, among others, and engineered, mixed, designed, and illustrated
entirely locally) who sound capable of following suit.
But these local musicians needed somewhere to play; somewhere larger
than the admittedly hospitable inn. There were other requirements, too
-- such as a doctor's surgery (until the new hall opened on April 1, the
doctor, who comes from Arisaig every Tuesday, consulted for years in her
car outside the village shop).
By the early eighties, Glenuig's population was increasing -- swollen
by people who had visited the area and decided to stay. The holiday
homes were occupied year-round by families. The previous village halls
-- a Nissen hut, reflecting the area's wartime use as a Commando
training centre, and a hall in the school -- were disused.
Enter Glenuig Community Association, who began raising funds in 1982
by organising concerts and dances. The initial target of #10,000 grew
threefold as they realised the size of the task they had set themselves.
In 1983 they launched Glenuig Festival. The first, held over a weekend
in a field that had to be swept of sheep droppings before the marquee
could be pitched and including a young Capercaillie, attracted 1500
people.
It was, say its organisers, a nightmare. It was also the first of its
kind in Lochaber and prompted a host of similar festivals. Unbowed, the
GCA persevered with an annual event until, following what was to be the
last festival in 1993, they had raised enough money to start building
their hall.
Financial assistance was successfully sought from the Scottish Office
Education Department, Highland Regional Council, Lochaber Limited, and
Lochaber Leader Project.
Because it was more than just a hall -- as well as the doctor's
surgery, it includes a darkroom, classrooms, and computer facilities,
public toilets and showers (a lot of people still live in caravans in
the area) -- the GCA were able to access funds that otherwise wouldn't
have been available.
The hall will be essentially a meeting place but, in time, it will
offer facilities for small businesses and seminars.
''I know we're seen by some here as a bunch of old hippies, but for
all that these people put us down, we do get things done,'' says GCA
spokesperson Val Hunter.

THE Government has failed to persuade two senior Labour councillors to
serve on its new public water authorities which will take control of the
council-run services next April, writes Frances Horsburgh.
It was disclosed at a meeting of council leaders in Edinburgh
yesterday that the chairman of Cosla's water and sewerage committee,
Councillor Alex McLean from Strathclyde, had already rejected an
approach from the Scottish Office to serve on the West of Scotland Water
Authority.
An invitation to Central region's Labour leader, Councillor Corrie
McChord, to become a member of the East of Scotland Authority will also
be declined.
Councillor McChord, speaking at a meeting of the executive committee
of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, said he had been
surprised to receive the invitation as he did not feel he had any
special expertise so far as the running of water services was concerned.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman confirmed that letters had gone out from
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, inviting people to serve on the new
authorities.
At the meeting, Cosla's Labour vice president, Councillor Keith
Geddes, restated the convention's stance, which is that members should
decline to serve on the boards unless they contained a majority of
councillors and the members were nominated by councils or through Cosla
instead of by the Secretary of State.
The convention has been fiercely opposed to the removal of water and
sewerage from council control as part of local government
reorganisation.

SCOTLAND'S leading animal charity yesterday criticised a court's
decision to let a farmer convicted of cruelty continue looking after
cattle.
Dairy farmer John Harper was fined #3000 and ordered to carry out 150
hours community service for causing unnecessary suffering to his cattle.
However, Harper, of Barrodger Farm, Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire,
yesterday was allowed to carry on farming as normal despite being
convicted of seven cruelty-related charges.
An earlier hearing at Paisley Sheriff Court heard how inspectors from
the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, vets, and
police had come across carcasses lying in a rat-infested pit following a
raid.
Harper was found guilty of failing to provide adequate care and
attention to two Friesian cows and a bullock -- all three had to be
destroyed.
Other animals were found lame and suffering from muscle wastage. Some
could barely walk because their hooves had not been trimmed.
Two animals were found to be infected with salmonella. Harper had been
told to separate one of them from the rest of the herd for treatment but
instead left it in a field to die.
The catalogue of cruelty also included a bullock suffering from
ringworm, lice, and mange. Harper was found guilty of six charges and
pleaded guilty to a seventh.
Officials from the SSPCA yesterday said they were ''extremely
disappointed' that Sheriff Charles Stoddart had not imposed a
disqualification order on Harper.
Superintendent Ron Grant said: ''It was quite clear from the evidence
that the man is not capable of looking after animals properly and in the
interests of preventing further suffering a ban would have been the most
appropriate sentence.''
The case sparked fury among animal rights activists. Harper received
hate mail and threatening telephone calls after the case was made
public, said Mr Scott Banks, defending.
Mr Banks said the neglect arose because Harper had been overworked.
''Mr Harper is in the habit of trying to do everything himself, with
some assistance from his wife and family,'' he said.
Harper, 53, who had lived on farms for 40 years, was not up with new
technology and farming methods, said Mr Banks, who added that he had
never come across such interest and hysteria over a case. One of the
letters sent to Harper was now in the hands of the police.
Sheriff Stoddart told Harper his offences were ''bad'' but not grave
enough to ban him from keeping livestock.
''This case comes just short of standards of gravity which require me
to exercise my powers to impose disqualification from custody of
particular animals,'' said Sheriff Stoddart.
He added: ''I have no doubt that the SSPCA, the Department of
Agriculture, and other agencies will be keeping a close eye on your
operation from now on. If there is any reccurence of this sort of
activity then you will be back in court and disqualification is
likely.''
Later, Harper was ushered from the court by his two daughters. Asked
if he thought he had got off lightly, Harper replied: ''No, definitely
not.''

THE mother of the Princess of Wales was involved in a confrontation
with a farm manager at an industrial tribunal in Glasgow yesterday, at
which a stockman is claiming he was sacked unfairly.
Asked by Mr Neil McCorkindale if the stockman, Mr Malcolm MacInnes,
had cried on her shoulder because ''the easy life was coming to an end''
when the farm was being sold, she replied: ''That's dreadfully untrue.''
When Mr McCorkindale pressed the question, he was told: ''It is for
the court to believe if one of us is a liar, and that's you.''
Mr MacInnes, 33, now of Murray Place, Selkirk, had worked for Mrs
Frances Shand-Kydd on her farm at Ardencaple, on the Isle of Seil,
Argyll, since leaving school in 1978.
He was kept on after the farm was bought by Mr J J A Taylor in
November 1992 and moved into the Lodge House in September 1991. Mr
Taylor is involved in the oil business and spends most of his time in
Singapore.
Mr McCorkindale went into partnership with Mr Taylor at Ardencaple and
also took over its running after manager John Brown retired.
Mr McCorkindale, who also runs his family farm near Ardencaple, said
he had dismissed Mr MacInnes because of a large number of calving and
lambing deaths last year, a general failure to maintain the farm, and
for lapses of security which ended with itinerant Irish workers sleeping
in the ''big house'' and consuming Mr Taylor's drink and stealing a
number of small items.
Mr McCorkindale said: ''It was well known locally that when the farm
was run by the Shand-Kydds, it didn't need to run at a profit. When Mr
Taylor bought it and I became involved in a partnership, things changed
and Mr MacInnes didn't seem able to adapt to that.
''The level of stockmanship went down after John Brown left and last
year, after having 560 lambs at 330 sheep at the start of lambing time,
we were left at the end with 351 lambs and 300 sheep. The calving was
also disastrous and we lost five calves and one cow.
''I was disgusted, agitated, and concerned. Mr MacInnes was left in no
doubt during lambing I was left completely dissatisfied with his
performance.''
Mr MacInnes claimed the animal deaths were not because of his lack of
attention but because of accident or the weather.
He said the lambing deaths were because Mr McCorkindale had started
lambing a month earlier than had ever been done at the farm.
Earlier, Mr McCorkindale had refuted a suggestion by Mr MacInnes's
lawyer that by lambing early ''he had endangered the sheep'' because he
''wanted to make a fast buck''.
Mr MacInnes also denied he gave the key of the house to the Irish
labourers, claiming it had been given to them by Mr McCorkindale.
Mrs Shand-Kydd said Mr McInnes was manager at Ardencaple for four
years before she sold the farm and that she never ''had any reason to
doubt his responsibility, capability or honesty''.
She added: ''He is the first person I have ever given a reference to.
He was a very good friend to Ardencaple for 14 years and to myself
also.''
The tribunal was adjourned to a date still to be arranged.

THE Paris suburb of Levallois-Perret, Sunday morning, market day.
Two lonely-looking young men were selling the Trotskyist paper Lutte
Ouvriere. Volunteers for an unlikely local alliance between communists,
socialists, and ecologists handed out election promises on recycled
paper. A tidy middle-aged man representing the RPR Gaullists distributed
tracts denouncing the doubtful record of the mayor, Patrick Balkany, who
backed Edouard Balladur, the wrong horse in the presidential election.
In front of the supermarket come a group called ''Smile, You're Being
Filmed'' protesting against the town council's extensive use of video
cameras. When the mayor himself arrived, the atmosphere of benevolent
political neutrality was shattered with insults and shouting. Mr
Balkany, quivering with rage, pushed his way out of the crowd leaving an
underling to take the stick.
It could seem small beer by comparison with the more obviously
dramatic clashes of the recent presidential election. Tomorrow however
France goes to the polls again to elect half a million mayors and town
councillors in more than 36,000 communes throughout the country.
Many political careers are at stake. Mayors have extensive powers in
the French system; the central and local politics are intimately
connected and no fewer than 35 of the 43 members of the government are
standing for election. Prime Minister Alain Juppe hopes to become Mayor
of Bordeaux and President Jacques Chirac should be succeeded as Mayor of
Paris by RPR personality Jean Tiberi.
Few municipal election campaigns have been so brief and intense as
this one -- the press has been full of little else besides Bosnia and
les Municipales -- and rarely can the overall result have been so
important.
The right wing has a massive majority in the National Assembly and
controls the country's upper house, the Senate. In the person of
President Chirac it holds the Elysee. Yet 131 towns of 30,000
inhabitants are still controlled by the left, as against 98 by
conservatives, who stand a chance to wipe the board. On the extreme
right the National Front in particular is looking forward to dig in
deeper at local level after the high score of their leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen in last month's presidential poll.
French town politics are a curious mix of conservatism and change.
Fewer than 6% of mayors, for example, are women and 28.5% of mayors are
farmers. The children of North African Arab immigrants are now entering
local election battles as fully fledged French citizens -- not only with
communists and socialists who have for years courted and often
disappointed them but also, surprisingly, with the right-wing RPR and
UDF.
Local personalities and local issues often outweigh party politics,
making the outcome of tomorrow's poll (to be followed by a second round
of voting on June 18) difficult to predict. The face of this campaign
has been further complicated by a record number of cases of criminal
corruption involving many of the great and the good.
The Mayor of Grenoble and former government minister Alain Carignon,
for example, has just completed a 203-day remand sentence after being
charged with pocketing money from a privatisation scheme for his city's
water supply. Jean Bousquet, mayor of Nimes and head of the Cacharel
company, faces two charges of corruption, including one of over costing
the city's splendid new art museum to the tune of #100,000 in order to
fund the local football club.
The Mayor of Bethune, Jacques Mellick, was given a suspended sentence
in April for suborning witnesses to help former Olympique de Marseille
manager Bernard Tapie, himself banned as bankrupt from standing in
tomorrow's poll. The former Mayor of Nice Jacques Medecin, recently
extradited from Uruguay, is awaiting trial on six charges and is still,
funnily enough, intensely popular.
Even Prime Minister Alain Juppe, it was revealed last week, pays a
peppercorn rent, thanks to kind friends at city hall, for his spacious
apartment in a smart part of Paris's Left Bank.
They are not alone, however. The internal French intelligence service
Renseignements Generaux has drawn up a list of 100 town councillors and
mayors who have either been charged or sentenced for a wide range of
corruption offences. This who's who of sleaze was obligingly published
yesterday, with just two days to go before voting.

THE Executive of the Scottish Constitutional Convention yesterday
agreed that a definitive scheme for a Scottish Parliament would be
presented to a full meeting of the convention on September 26.
After a meeting in Edinburgh, members of the executive were confident
they could settle the remaining issues by the September deadline.
The biggest problems remain the size of the parliament and the issue
of equal representation for men and women.
There has been speculation that a compromise will be reached between
Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrats at a final number of seats
between 120 and 136.
In the 145-seat body favoured by the Liberals, it is accepted that, on
the basis of the 1992 General Election results, Labour could not win
control.
However, after yesterday's meeting, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader
Jim Wallace MP was still stressing publicly that his party would be
holding out for the 145 figure.
He said: ''We have a conference decision for 145. The ball is in the
Labour Party's court. They are consulting and that will take its
course.''
Scottish Labour Party General Secretary Jack McConnell seemed
confident of ultimate success. He said: ''We believe there will be an
agreement. We don't believe the two positions are incompatible and we
are very confident of that.''
He added the key objective for the convention partners was to spend
the time before the General Election to promote the agreed scheme.
Canon Kenyon Wright, chairman of the executive, admitted there had
been times when his confidence had flagged over the last six years and
especially the last few months.
However, he said: ''Today's was a very good meeting, genuinely, and I
think we are close to a consensus on all the remaining issues.''
They had now nailed their colours to the mast in that there was to be
a meeting on September 26 with the purpose of agreeing the scheme.

MILLIONAIRE Scottish soccer tycoon Geoff Brown was hailed as the most
generous boss in Scotland by his workers yesterday when he announced he
was taking his staff and their partners -- all 200 of them -- on holiday
to Disney World in Florida.
Last night, smiling building workers and office staff at GS Brown
Construction were happy to confirm that their company is definitely not
in the Mickey Mouse league when it comes looking after the employees.
Mr Brown, 52, owner and chairman of St Johnstone Football Club, has
already booked the jet that will whisk his workers off to their
all-expenses paid holiday later this summer.
Self-made millionaire Mr Brown, who made his fortune building Perth's
bungalow belt, is celebrating his 25th anniversary in business with a
reward to his loyal workforce.
They will enjoy a fortnight in the four-star luxury of the Buena Vista
Hotel at Disney World.
Players and officials at St Johnstone will not be making the trip.
Their lacklustre performance in the middle of the First Division and
failure to gain promotion has ensured that they are staying at home.
Ex-joiner Mr Brown has never forgotten his roots and his early days
''hammering nails and wood''.
One of his first workers, now a 78-year-old pensioner is going on the
trip, along with the tycoon's 79-year-old father and four sons.
Mr Brown said: ''I believe that you should treat people the way you
would like to be treated yourself.
''We want to thank the men who worked alongside us in the early days
and the many other employees who have followed.
He added that the cost of the trip was ''less than two JCB diggers''
and explained, ''I am giving nothing for nothing. These people have
given me a lot over the years, and this is my way of repaying them.''
Mr Brown explained that he had the idea for the Florida trip five
years ago when he took a group of 160 to mark his 20th anniversary in
business.
''I said then that, if we were still around to celebrate our silver
anniversary, I would take the staff to Florida, and they started marking
off the days as soon as we got back.''
''We will split up into groups and go our own way when we arrive over
there. Florida has something for everybody, and the hotel we are staying
in has complimentary travel to golf courses, beaches and Disney world.''
Joiner Bill Smith, 61, has been with the company for 23 years. He is
taking his wife Ann with him. He said: ''I've never been to Florida
before. This is the trip of a lifetime for me.
''Geoff is a great boss. He's more of a workmate than a boss. I've
always got on well with him. This is a tremendous thing he's doing. I
don't know of any other boss who would take his workforce on holiday.''
Mr Willie Hughan, 40, a mechanic with 12 years' service at the firm,
is taking his wife Ellen and children Sara, 12 and Jon, 16, on the trip.
He said, ''I'm delighted. Geoff is an ordinary guy. He's just one of
the lads. Five years ago, in Tenerife, he promised he would take us to
Florida and he has been as good as his word. There is a real family
atmosphere at this firm.''
Geoff's secretary Rhoda Hall, has worked for the company for 14 years
and is taking her husband Bob to the States. She commented: ''Geoff is a
very kind man. He is easy-going and a pleasure to work with. He seems to
be rewarding us for all of the hard work that we've put into the firm.''

The working-class Scot who never grew up, Rod Stewart presents an
image of brash bonhomie. But rocking Rod is now just a bilious
self-parody, say the critics. His golden hour expired long ago, suggests
David Belcher.
HE'S got a gallus blonde haircut plus a well-publicised liking for
what is euphemistically known as the high life. He is a darling of the
gutter press. Recently, he has displayed a sad tendency towards not
lasting the full 90 minutes in a football shirt.
Moreover, he has a lucrative Ibrox engagement in the offing. I can
only be referring to one man, of course. Welcome ye back to the bonnie
purple heather of your native Govan, Rod Stewart.
Oh aye, him. Rod the mod; Rod the genial fraud; Rod the plausible
rogue. The London-born Scot whose hame is Los Angeles. The geezer who
forged profitable links between popular music and football; the terraces
and the turntable. The bloke who has made a 25-year career out of wine,
blonde women, more wine, song, more blonde women, rum and coke, and
falling over in public. The old boy who invented laddishness.
Where would Gazza and his modern-day ilk be without Rod Stewart? He
wrote the book on getting away with it, Rod did. Ain't misbehavin'?
Ain't behavin' would be nearer the mark, but it's always been done with
a twinkle in Rod's eye, allowing him to transform what might seem
boorish into something excusably boyish. No offence, missus.
Due to perform in front of near-capacity crowds at Pittodrie on
Thursday and at Ibrox on Saturday, Rod is 50 now, and shows no signs of
growing up. Take the circumstances of Rod's most recent wedding, coming
up for five years ago.
With his history of romantic liaisons, Rod could only get married to a
blonde model, naturally. Blonde lookers? Rod's run the gamut, from A,
Alannah Hamilton, to B, Britt Ekland. Rachel Hunter, a New Zealander,
she's the present Mrs Rod. Rod met her in a nightclub in LA, where else?
She was 22, half Rod's age, Rod being just a year younger than Rachel's
dad.
Rod's stag night was a bit of a do, kicking off with Rod being served
a palimony suit from his last ''ex'', Kelly Emberg. At the wedding in
LA, guests were ferried about in a London double-decker bus. Kilted
pipers played Scotland The Brave as the bride and groom made their exit.
At the reception there was a large wedding cake in the shape of the
Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, with a kiwi fruit stuck on it to
represent the Antipodes. The common touch, Rod's got it.
He remembers his roots, too, does Rod -- and I'm not just talking
about his dyed barnet, either. Prominent among the invited wedding
guests was John Gray, the Department of Transport statistican who runs
Rod's fan club and edits Smiler fanzine. He'll doubtless have reported
Rod's wedding speech.
How did it start? Oh yeah. ''I feel like a dog with two dicks .'' Very
couth. Rod went on to tell the assembly that he wouldn't be putting his
banana in anybody's fruit bowl from now on. Cuh, that Rod, what a laugh.
Then he proceeded to remove his new wife's garter with his teeth.
Crass? Perish the thought. Nary a half-decent album in more than 20
years? Wash your mouth out. It's true, though. Not that Rod was always
like this. He used to be the embodiment of grace under pressure,
working-class pride and self-improvement, like his hero Sam Cooke.
Sensitive, too. Ah, those first four solo albums.
First, around about 1969, there was An Old Raincoat Won't Let You
Down. The next year came Gasoline Alley and Martin Quittendon's
heart-rending mandolin. Every Picture Tells A Story in 1971 and Never A
Dull Moment in 1972. Pithy tunes with a ramshackle allure to them.
Above all there was Rod's aching, world-weary voice and his air of
proletarian realism, a welcome antidote to the worn-out hippie silliness
of the sixties. And he chose his cover versions with taste and insight,
popularising other folks' songs without watering them down -- bettering
the originals: Tim Hardin's Reason To Believe; I'm Losing You by the
Temptations; Jimi Hendrix's Angel.
Rod's attempted the same feat on his new album, Spanner In The Works,
with a stab at the Blue Nile's Downtown Lights. It's not as good as the
Blue Nile's. Maybe Rod's not as good as Rod was. In a recent New Musical
Express interview, Rod admitted that during his last UK tour his voice
wasn't what it once was. Too much wine, not enough song.
Critics have summed up his whole career in much the same terms.
Greil Marcus, doyen of rock scribes, wrote of Rod Stewart: ''Rarely
has anyone betrayed his talent so completely. Once the most
compassionate presence in music, he has become a bilious self-parody --
and sells more records than ever. Sleazy records, the humour forced, the
sexiness burned down to an open shirt and stuffed crotch.''
Paul Evans, of Rolling Stone magazine, did not spare our Rod. ''An
object lesson in the perils of pandering, Stewart's career proves that
'selling out' wasn't just some thought-crime dreamed up by sixties
idealists. For a golden hour, Rod the Mod was one of rock's finest
singers. . . embodying sincerity, taste and self-mocking humour.
''In the much longer period since then, exactly those values have been
sacrificed as, rushing headlong after megabucks and artistic bankruptcy,
the working-class Scot became the Hollywood tart, the definitive parody,
the saddest poseur. He continues to get it up for brilliant bits, and
even his worst echoes a truly remarkable voice -- it's only that given
his promise, the bulk of his product radiates pathos and a certain
shame.
''Get the first four records of his shining moment and honour an
incredible singer by forgoing the rest of his tripe.''
More recently, there's been a bit of a critical revision, following
Rod's Unplugged album, in which he treated his r&amp;b roots with something
approaching reverence. Overall, though, the informed verdict has been
thumbs down.
Not that Rod seems bothered. Willingly serving a 30-year sentence
underneath a static hairstyle, Rod parries all criticism with a matey
bonhomie. His most recent interview, in Q magazine, found Rod agreeing
that yes, Smiler was rubbish, and Do Ya Think I'm Sexy was silly, and
gorblimey, caught me bang to rights on this one, guv, those spray-on
leopardskin disco-trousers in 1978 were ridiculous. . . now can we talk
about the exact dimensions of me football pitch (with two groundsmen),
the one I've got in the back garden of me sizeable English abode, and
wah-hey-hey, cop a load of these photographs of me baring me bum in a
pub, and what about this one of the missus on the lavvy.
That Rod Stewart. What a hoot! What a hooter! What a lad! What a
waste.

LIKE many others at college or university, I am someone who is not so
much a student as a wholly-owned subsidiary of a major bank. This being
the case, Stuart Millar's article about student funding was of more than
passing interest (Herald Education, June 6).
According to Mr Millar the recent NUS conference decision in favour of
free education and adequate grants ''isolates the union . . . from the
students it represents''. Upon asking my classmates' opinion, support
for higher grants was almost universal as was condemnation of any
contributory scheme. More debt somehow fails to appeal as a solution to
our debt problems.
Not much isolation there. My classmates also expressed surprise that
by holding these opinions they had joined the ranks of, to use Mr
Millar's phrase, ''the hard left''.
I do not share Stuart Millar's dismay at the NUS decision. The NUS
exists to further the interests of its members, not to advocate the
least worst option in order to impress ministers, principals, or the
education correspondent of The Herald.
Admittedly, upon seeing the willingness to abandon grants shown by
Scottish NUS president Douglas Trainor and his UK counterpart, Jim
Murphy, casual observers could be forgiven for not realising this.
Education should be a priority, and decent grants must be a part of it
if people are to reach their full potential. When students reach the end
of their course they expect, and deserve, a diploma, not an invoice.

FOLLOWING your amusing report last week (May 30) of the journey of the
spooky midnight ScotRail train from Maryhill, I resolved one night to
avail myself of the service and to boldly come to Bishopbriggs.
So in good time, about 11.30pm, on Wednesday night (June 7) I took up
a conspicuous position on the appropriate platform of Maryhill Station,
having carefully consulted the current timetable displayed on the
notice-board.
Punctually at 11.58pm (aka 23.58) a two or three-carriage train
arrived from the west, travelling at high speed, and disappeared into
the darkness towards the east, without stopping at the platform.
I waited sime eight minutes to see if anything substantial (eg another
train, advancing or reversing) developed but then somewhat impatiently
left to find my way home. Perhaps something happened after that; I
cannot tell.
With the momentary apparition of two or three ScotRail coaches (but
travelling at high speed) I felt a bit like poor Cinderella deprived of
her (single) golden coach, after the midnight ball.
Would that, like Cinderella, I had some tangible souvenir of this
episode, and Inscribed Golden SpokRail Spanner, say, to prove my epic
tale.
Mr Ellis of ScotRail is quoted by you today (June 8) as saying that
these so-called ''ghost'' services will continue to run. What he seems
to have meant is that they will certainly run and run and run but that
they won't actually stop at the stations.
Cinderella's story is a fairy-tale. So in a way, it seems, are parts
of ScotRail's timetables. We live in a wonderful world.

THOUGH I take Sara Villiers's criticisms of my recent comments in good
part, I must say that her argument is rather on the flimsy side (May
30). True, London critics have reacted unfavourably to Rona Munro's The
Maiden Stone and David Kane's Dumbstruck! But, as Ms Villers grudgingly
acknowledges, those same critics have responded to other transfers from
Scottish theatres -- particularly productions originating at the
Traverse -- with huge enthusiasm.
Ah, she argues, it is ''work with a strong Scottish perspective'' that
gets us Sassenachs up in arms. What tosh! Does Trainspotting have any
less of a ''strong Scottish perspective'' than The Maiden Stone?
Sara Villiers says she is sick of ''slick and soulless shows . . .
touring Scotland''. Do we not have the right down south to have a
similar reaction to productions that do the same in reverse?
Personally, I reserve the right to voice objections with the same
freedom with which I pay compliments. Each piece of theatre, I believe,
should be judged on its merits, regardless if its point of origin, and I
refuse to be tarred with Sara Villiers's all-encompassing charges of
''disrespect for Scottish culture'' and ''small-minded
metropolitanism''.
Such sensationalism may make good copy, but two poorly received shows
hardly constitute ''constant derision''.

HINDSIGHT being an exact science, there is little doubt that hundreds,
nay thousands, of your readers are saying ''I told you so'' in the wake
of your front-page story about the lottery and the salaries of the
people at its helm (June 7).
The ethos of laissez-faire created by the Thatcher years has not got
so out of control that surely it has to be halted. There is no question
that, in today's Britain, the rich are getting richer and the poor are
getting poorer.
We live in a nation where more than 2 million children live in
households where there is no adult in a job. We live in a country where
living standards are lower than they were 20 years ago. The ''right''
continues to peddle the argument that economic growth may benefit the
richest of our society first, but it will trickle down to the poor,
making them better off too. This is patent nonsense.
The wealth of the chairman of British Gas and the chief executive of
Camelot has no effect on me or thousands of others except to engender an
anger that is hard to appease. A nation at ease with itself? Hardly!

A STINGING attack on Scottish Office Ministers who paid for their
children to be taught in private schools while condemning pupils in the
state sector to an education in classes which were bursting at the seams
was made yesterday by the leader of Scotland's biggest teachers' union.
Mr Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the Educational Institute of
Scotland, told the union's annual conference in Perth that budget cuts
would lead to the loss of more than 400 teaching jobs, a shrinking
curriculum, and bigger class sizes.
Britain had the poorest staffing ratios in the European Union, he
said.
''If those who govern us find it worthwhile paying privately to secure
small class sizes for their children, why do they deny that right to the
children for whom they have political responsibility?''
Mr Smith criticised the ''perversity'' of the Government's education
policies which resulted in spending of an average of more than #3000 a
year for each pupil on the assisted places scheme, which gives financial
help to parents from less well off families who want to have their
children educated in the independent sector.
The per capita costs were much lower in local authority schools with
only Shetland and the Western Isles spending more in the secondary
sector because of the need to maintain schools in isolated communities.
''There could hardly be a clearer indication that education spending
has far less to do with what the country can afford and much more to do
with priorities, with what the Government sees as important.
''If there is to be a genuine commitment to improving education there
must be an investment in education,'' said Mr Smith.
The EIS yesterday made a commitment to taking industrial action in
pursuit of its policy on class sizes.
There are legal limits of 33 pupils in the primary and first two years
of secondary education, 30 thereafter, and 20 in practical classes for
subjects such as science.
The EIS wants a maximum of 25 for pupils aged between five and 14, 20
for third, fourth, fifth, and sixth-year pupils, and 15 for practical
subjects.
The EIS leadership wanted to maintain a policy of seeking reductions
without recourse to action but delegates voted to impose the union's
targets if negotiations fail to achieve its aims.
But they rejected a call to put a timescale on industrial action.
Former EIS president Willie Hart said teachers needed to give a clear
indication of their determination to cut class sizes.
Smaller classes meant more attention and better education for pupils,
he said.
In his speech, Mr Smith said teachers were increasingly unable to cope
with the demands being made on them.
''In the world of education, teachers and lecturers, as much as other
workers, are being squeezed as employers demand more and more of fewer
and fewer.
''The popular image of teaching as a safe, secure, and respectable job
for life is increasingly a distortion of reality.''
In a sign of the times, Mr Smith said the union had secured
compensation awards for teachers of nearly #100,000.
''Cleaners working to tight deadlines because of compulsory
competitive tendering contracts allied to teachers staying on to keep up
with work after pupils have left are causing significant numbers of
accidents on wet floors.
''And, of course, there are falls caused when the buckets catching the
drops from roof leaks have overflowed,'' he said.
Delegates also backed a call for guidelines for teachers on
restraining pupils in special schools.
Ms Beth Campbell, who teaches at Kingspark Special School in Dundee,
said she realised she was opening up a can of worms, but teachers
desperately needed advice on how much necessary physical restraint they
could use.
Restraint was vital to ensure the safety of children and teachers.
Most parents accepted that it was necessary but she said: ''Some of our
members are vulnerable in the face of this difficult and sensitive
issue.''
A motion calling on the union, which represents eight out of 10
Scottish teachers, to boycott national testing for five to 14-year-olds
was rejected.
Delegates heard that EIS negotiators had reached agreements with all
Scottish local authorities on schemes which allowed teachers to use the
tests in reading, writing, and maths to confirm their judgment that
pupils were ready to move from one level of the curriculum to the next.

A hotel chain is pioneering a special service tailored to women on
holiday or business, described by ANN SHAW.
IF you are a lone woman traveller you will have your own private
collection of memorable stories from hotels. One friend, on business in
the States, was the subject of a murder attack in her locked hotel room
when a crazed man broke the door down and attacked her with a knife.
Another got mistaken for a high-class prostitute and was asked to leave
the foyer of a posh London hotel.
I've had nothing more dramatic than hotel staff marching in to
''check'' a room without so much as a knock or apology.
It is the way women get treated as second-class citizens that led the
Crest hotel chain 15 years ago to pioneer a special service for women
travellers. Known as the ''Lady Crest'' rooms, they offer extra
security, better-quality room service, toileteries, ironing-boards,
fruit, magazines, and pot-pourri. At no extra charge.
But do women really take up these services and demand them? I put the
question to John Miller, manager of 18 months of the Crest hotel in
Glasgow, better known as The Albany.
Oh yes the demand is there. ''We could sell our Lady Crest rooms twice
over,'' he says, so much so that they are more than doubling the number.
At present they have 18 rooms set aside for women travellers. Within the
next few months they plan to add a further 27 making a total of 45 out
of their hotel capacity of 251 rooms.
''We find men are asking for the Lady Crest rooms,'' he adds, somewhat
surprised at this unexpected turn of events. The reason? They like the
ironing board and iron, much more useful than the awkward trouser press
which every hotel room seems to insist on. Also the hair dryer is placed
on the dressing table instead of in the bathroom, where it's well out of
reach of a mirror.
An attempt to extend the Lady Crest formula to a ''Ladies only''
dining table met with a dismal failure. Women after a busy day certainly
did not want to relax with a group of total female strangers. Like the
men, they wanted to unwind over a leisurely meal followed by a
comfortable bed. The last thing on their minds was an evening with total
strangers on a chit-chat bandwagon. ''Yes,'' says John ruefully. ''It
was a mistake.''
Instead the hotel makes certain the lone woman traveller is not placed
in the restaurant in a focal point, neither is she pushed next to the
kitchen door. Discretion is the key word. ''We want her to feel
comfortable and at ease in our restaurant,'' says Miller, a policy
echoed throughout the Crest hotel chain.
Other nice touches are the fact that all rooms are in close proximity
to the lifts. You are not expected to wander down endless corridors
looking for your room number. Double locks and keyholes add to the
security.
Great attention is paid to the fact that neither her name nor room
number is made known in reception when she books in. This is not
paranoia on the part of Crest hotels. They are well aware of the
American trend, which ultimately will find its way to this country,
where potential attackers overhear in the reception area names of women
guests then ring them up pretending to be hotel staff wanting to check
air-conditioning/central heating and gain entry only to commit rape and
murder once inside. No, you can't be too careful these days.
''Regrettably it is a pattern that is likely to occur in this country
too in the years to come,'' says John Miller.
But Lady Crest rooms do have an image problem. Women don't know they
exist. This was one of the findings of a survey carried out by the Forte
Crest organisation. Also, there was some debate among younger women in
the 20s and 30s age bracket over the desirability of singling women out
for a special package. They argued that it should be available to all
business people.
The survey concluded: ''As we come up to the turn of the twentieth
century there are indications that in the not-so-distant future it is
going to be a unisex world.''
Businesswomen currently account for 35% of the hotel trade, a figure
predicted to rise to 50% by the year 2000.
So, the Crest hotel initiatives are to be welcomed. Many businesswomen
still feel that they are treated as second-class citizens, according to
a survey on 500 women carried out by Expotel Hotel Reservations in
London.
This is hardly a revelation, certainly not to the thousands of women
who use hotels regularly.
The survey says women found staff attitudes to them ranged from
patronising and flirtatious to openly rude. Over half used room service
because they felt uncomfortable in areas such as the bar or restaurant.
Certainly the Lady Crest concept to make women feel relaxed and safe
while staying in Forte Crest hotels is an admirable one, a model that
other hotels could do well to follow.

DR Thatcher (June 5) defends the appointment of the wife of the new
Principal at Glasgow University to an unadvertised senior post on the
grounds that there is too much ''dead wood'' in the university.
I don't know Dr Thatcher, but I note that he writes from a university
address. I presume this is either because his expertise in ''Russian and
East European Studies'' brings some insight to this subject or he is
providing an official statement from the university.
Writing as a private citizen who happens to be employed at the same
university, can I point out to him that young saplings are usually eaten
by marauding deer or destroyed by frost unless protected by the older
woods and dead trees that surround them?
But that is not the issue. If any organisation wants to employ the
best people for a job that it wants to fill, then the best way to get
them is to advertise the post as widely as possible in open competition.
Then, we can hope that this might ensure that appointments are made
because of what people know and not who they know.
The consequence of not opening posts up to competition can be that the
university ends up employing relatives and sycophants.

IF Neil Smith (June 6) in his retort to my recent letter could see
through his blue mist of irritation he might have observed that far from
being guilty of double standards I was merely highlighting the endemic
double standards of the Conservative Party, which Mr Smith clearly
exhibits in his own letter.
It was not the SNP who ensured a flag-waving VE-Day parade in tiny
Perth. It was not the SNP who then blatantly tried to equate a modern
democratic organisation with the enemy of the Second World War. It was
not the SNP who with a sweeping generalisation were condemning
Nationalism as an evil force. It was not the SNP who chose ''defence of
the Union'' as the central plank of their campaign.
It was trying to debate the current situation in Scotland. Mr Smith,
however, seems more intent on penning some irrelevant nonsense about
Jacobites, blaming them for the ''English backlash that destroyed
Highland culture''. Does that somehow make it acceptable or excusable?
Neither was I saying that people have no right, or are wrong, to
display their ''British'' Nationalism. I was however pointing out that
there is more than one type of Nationalism, and that it is not all
right-wing fascism or imperial expansionism. The Conservatives and Mr
Smith would do well to acknowledge this and apologise unreservedly to
the SNP for their repeated slurs.
I also refute his accusation that the SNP membership is ''intolerant
of the English''. Certainly all SNP members are intolerant of the
English-dominated Westminster system, but that does not equate to a
gripe against the English people. Many born furth of Scotland are active
SNP members, and this fact alone says more about the SNP's democratic
and non-discriminatory appeal than could Mr Smith's jibes.
The SNP are solely driven by a lust for power and money? The SNP
''greedily want all the oil in the North Sea''? On the contrary, the SNP
believe firmly in oil-sharing -- South-east England has had its share,
now it should be Scotland's turn.
The British Government sells exploration licences to oil companies,
spends not one penny itself on exploration, and recoups over #2.2bn a
year in tax from these same companies -- who are there because they make
a profit. Presumably the collection of #1.7bn whisky duty a year (in
breach of the Treaty of Union) is equally ''greedy''?
The SNP want to use Scotland's resources to meet Scotland's needs.
What is greedy or lustful about that?

SO, the Empire strikes back! Clearly Neil Smith in downtown Tarbert
has no problem with his British identity (June 6). It's the Scottish bit
which is distinctly problematic. Mind you, it's just a wee bit!
Across the political and historical spectrum, Mr Smith travels with a
gay insouciance befitting a John Godfrey. Items -- British Imperialism
at least did it rather better; the Stuarts' rightful claim to the throne
was inappropriate and certainly unsuitable; and, best of all, a lust for
power and money drives the SNP!
If that were the case then their supporters would, like him, all
belong to a British party! Has he never read the timeless words of the
Declaration of Arbroath?
However, let's stick with the flags and the symbols. Perhaps Mr Smith
could check out the Rugby World Cup quarter-final on Sunday between
England and Australia. Perhaps he might note England's Union Jack and
perhaps he might enjoy England's national anthem. After all, they are
more ''successful''.

HOW thrilled and delighted I was with Neil Smith's letter (June 6) in
connection with Scottish Nationalists and our much-maligned Union Flag.
I agree with every point that Mr Smith made and as far as I and I'm sure

respect to the SNP, the Union Flag, the Jacobite uprising, and North Sea
oil.

I HAVE only now seen Bob McCutcheon's letter (May 22) pointing out
that Rob Roy MacGregor could not have taken part in the 1745 Rising as
he had died 11 years earlier, on December 28, 1734.
What Mr McCutcheon decently omitted to mention was that Rob Roy was
inconsiderate enough to ask the family piper to play the lament, Cha
Till Mi Tuilidh (I Shall Return No More) over his deathbed, meaning
among his many attributes he was also afflicted with the Second Sight
and could see into the future.
We all very well know that the lament, which is the keystone of the
entire MacCrimmon legend, was not written until 1745, when its composer
called the same tune Cha Till MacCruimmen or so the legend has it.
The composer was, of course, Donald Ban MacCrimmon, who played his
composition to his sweetheart at Dunvegan Castle as the war-galley drew
away with the clansmen on board to fight his king. Well, ''Butcher''
Cumberland, actually, although the MacLeod tourist machine does not
dwell on the family's great patriotism in those fearful days.
The legend also omits to mention that Donald Ban must have been a bit
of an old goat as he already had a wife living in Harris, but stresses
that he was shot at Moy, Inverness-shire, after they marched out from
Inverness, as part of Lord Loudon's Redcoat regiment, on the night of
Sunday, February 16, 1746, to capture Prince Charles Edward Stuart at
Moy Hall.
But here's another funny thing. According to the Cumberland Papers, it
was Lord Loudon's piper who was shot at Moy and they all ran away. And
another part of the legend claims Donald Ban had already been captured
at Inverurie, six weeks earlier, and could never have been at Moy
anyway, despite reliable eyewitness accounts (emanating from Skye) that
he most certainly was.
It's all very puzzling. Could anyone tell me if Phineas T (''There's a
sucker born every minute'') Barnum, the great American showman, was born
on Skye? Perhaps he could settle the matter for once and for all.

BEING a non-churchgoer and working-class housing-scheme dweller,
qualifying for Father Barry's description of that social group as
''pagan'', clerical matters normally don't interest me, but I was left
in quiet despair by Mr Blackshaw's letter (May 30) because of its
intransigent and sanctimonious tone.
He deserves to be locked in a room with an Islamic fundamentalist and
a Wee Free minister; that would resemble a ''Tower of Babel''. If he
were to be informed that there are many paths up the metaphorical
mountain and on reaching the summit we all breathe the same air, he
would still be walking around sniffing his religious inhaler.
But he has nothing to fear about damage to his Church by Cardinal
Winning by way of radical reform or radical doctrinal interpretation, as
he is essentially a dogmatist who won't deviate too far from traditional
thinking. We may witness cosmetic ecumenical compromises but there will
be no significant bridge-building with other religions or abandoning the
Church's socially divisive segregated schools policy that perpetuates
the conditions for sectarianism.
It is difficult to imagine an authoritarian Chruch adoping an
enlightened integrated-education policy that would diminish bigotry in
this blighted society but also lessen its influence over people.

Ballet legend Nina Verchinina, on a visit to Scotland from her home in
Rio, finds that the essential energy of her dance arrived before her,
reports Mary Brennan.
LAST week the unthinkable happened. Nina Verchinina had to cancel a
class. Was she perhaps tired? A little jet-lagged maybe? She had, after
all, only just arrived from Rio de Janeiro. But not the long-haul
journey -- weariness is not allowed to interfere with her life's work.
What stopped Verchinina was a police cordon.
Investigations into a recent murder, meant Strathclyde Arts Centre --
where she was booked to teach -- was out of bounds. There was no time to
make other arrangements. Reluctantly she accepted the role of tourist
for the day . . .
Not much stops Verchinina in her chosen tracks. All her life she has
been possessed of a bright, determined energy that has continually
expressed itself through dance-making. Her long career has spanned the
heady days of De Basil's Ballets Russes in the 1930s through years spent
sewing the seeds of modern movement in countries like Argentina and
Brazil where she now lives, teaching the dance style she has evolved, in
her own Rio studio.
Verchinina has never been content to follow lazily in someone else's
footsteps. Especially if she feels they lead in a gratuitously showy,
artificial direction. She wants movement to be true, to mean something.
Most of all, she wants it to have strength.
I watch her teach a group of women, all with different dance
backgrounds, different levels of experience. As the record plays a
groaningly slow piano version of Oh, How We Danced -- she blithely
reduces speed on the turntable till the tempo is just as she wants it!
-- Verchinina sets the group stretching. ''Work your spine. Stretch your
elbows. Your arms. STR-E-E-E-TCH your arms. Feel, it goes right through
your back.''
She herself, a wiry pixie in fleecy sweatshirt and plain trews, is
already arcing gracefully. You can see, feel, the power that rises
through her tiny torso. Any moment and sparks of electricity will fly
from her outstretched fingers. The years shrug away as she moves. And
there in the downstairs studio of the CCA, while an unknowing Glasgow
rackets passed about its Saturday business, I see history come alive in
Nina Verchinina.
At home I have books, old and new, where Verchinina's name in the
index leads to ecstatic descriptions of her De Basil's Ballets Russes de
Monte Carlo. There, in the early thirties she created significant roles
in Massine ballet that subsequently became the toast of the
international dance audience.
As Action in Les Presages, she was hailed and admired as a bridge
between old and new, classical and modern. Her intuitive musicality, her
ability to convey moods far beyond the range of ballet at that time and
her arms . . . The nuances of movement they achieved, from the merest
rippling to a sudden whiplash intensity . . . her arms especially were
eulogised by critics everywhere. Even by Massine, who found her truly
inspiring.
Arnold Haskell, the balletomane who vividly recorded his impressions
of those times, wrote of Verchinina -- ''Who can forget her entrance in
Les Presages? In it she reconciles so many seeming opposites: the use of
the pointes with the plastic dance, enormous strength with fluid
movement . . . Without such a dancer as Verchinina, one might well say,
that some symphonic movements cannot be done.''
He was not alone in his assessment that, without her inate
understanding of Massines visionary aims, the choreographer's radical
experiments would not have succeeded.
The subject of so many superlatives doesn't, in fact, parade any of
them in her conversation. Unlike many an octogenarian, Verchinina has a
lively recall of the past . . . but she doesn't dwell in it. The here
and now, her work above all else, are what occupy her mentally and
physically. In that, she is perennially young.
Even as a child she had a jack-in-the-box exuberance that could hardly
be contained. ''Jumping. Oh I was always jumping. Leaping and running.
My mother couldn't understand me. I was more like a boy than a girl.''
She smiles, roguishly at the memory. What channeled that vitality into
dance was an early glimpse of the circus. ''We were in China, then.
There was no ballet, of course. But there was circus. I saw this woman
acrobat -- and I knew, somehow that I wanted to dance.''
Growing up, with the family now in Paris, she started ballet training
but again, her natural inclination was to burst free of the
pretty-pretty niceties of classical technique. The smile returns as she
describes how her mother enrolled her with the celebrated ballerina,
Preobrajenska -- one of the many emigres who took the Russian classical
traditions into the wider world.
''She looked at me -- and at my sister. My sister was so delicate,
very feminine. And I was jumping around as usual. Big jumps, lots of
energy. And Preobrajenska is shaking her head. What is she going to do
with me. And she says 'I'll take that one' -- my sister -- 'And that one
. . . half price'.'' To everyone's surprise -- including hers -- it was
Nina, and not her sister, who went on to make an international career.
''One day, Nijinska came to our class. She was looking for dancers.
And she picked me! Nobody could believe it! All the time Preobrajenska
would be saying to me -- 'No, no, no. You have to be more feminine. You
are jumping too high. It's too big. Make it more gentle'.''
She perches on the edge of the sofa and makes little twirly gestures
with her fingers. Her clear, dark eyes twinkle with absolute mischief.
Suddenly one gets a glimpse of what Prebrajenska, with her refined
notions, was up against.
But Nijinska recognised the value of Verchinina's mettle. She saw the
boldness, the ferocity, the untrammelled energy for what it was: an
expression of free spirit. It was also the prescient spirit of a new age
of dance.
Verchinina's hallmark has always been clean, intelligent, motivated
strength. No fussiness, no frou-frou, she recalls watching Isadora
Duncan -- ''The Death Of Isolde and it went into me like electricity,
like lightning.'' She stumps her chest emphatically. ''She was fat.
Lying there, lots of veils . . . flesh. But when she danced, you felt
it. You knew it was coming from inside and that was what I wanted for
myself. There has to be a logic, a meaning to movements. Otherwise it's
like talking. Opening your mouth . . .'' She makes silent jaw-jawing
motions. ''. . . But saying nothing. Just empty noise.''
While still touring with De Basil's Ballets Russes, she started
choreographing her own work to some acclaim. More and more she found
that her responses to music, the feelings she had about movement, were
building towards an entire personal philosophy of dance. Even so, she
felt in need of further training. She looked to America.
''I went to Martha Graham. I wanted badly, to understand her
technique. But she said no! She told me I had too much personality of my
own! I was to go away and find my own movements.'' Quite. One can just
imagine Graham rapidly assessing the likely biddability of her would-be
pupil and deciding that one studio probably wasn't big enough for two
determined temperaments.
Instead, Verchinina came in contact with the methods and attributes of
Laban technique. It struck inner chords. ''I would look at the way the
wind would make trees move. At how the branches would bend.'' Her arms
instinctively lift, sweep to one side, as if the air in this calm
living-room had suddenly gusted and was pushing them away.
''I started looking at the world around me. Seeing, really seeing how
things moved. How a leaf would fall. The way it spirals and twists.
Where the movement was coming from. That is what I teach. Not artificial
movements. Not the kind of dance where you pretend something. I don't
like ballet where all you get is a dancer showing themselves. They do
these steps and it's to show how well they can do them. Dance has to
have meaning. Like when Ulanova danced the Juliet. And she was Juliet.
It wasn't just . . .'' And again she sparks into action, faced
uncharacteristically blank, arms moving in a precise, prissy way like a
little animated doll.
In the course of an afternoon the room fills with radiant spirits.
Young Nina clashing with ballet conventions. Madcap times, when --
strapped for cash as usual -- De Basil sent his company off in
ramshackle buses to venues that had equally ramshackle facilities. And
they still made astounding dance. Times that are now legendary because
of the talent he recruited -- Lichine, Baronova, Lifar, Balanchine,
Danilova, Toumanova, Massine, and Verchinina herself. Like Popacatapetl
and Chimboraza, these were names that stole generations of hearts away .
. .
Yes, she had met the Perons, when she ran her own project in Buenos
Aires. She had watched Isadora's cortege pass in Paris. She had danced
before royalty in London -- the little princesses had sneaked into
matinee performances. There had even been a comand appearance in
practice clothes -- at the palace.
These shimmering splinters of past celebrity shrug in and out of her
narrative. One gets the impression that they hardly matter compared to
the business in hand, which is her teaching. These days she has her own
school in Rio De Janeiro -- a place she once swore never to set legs in
again. But now, it's home, and she rarely sets foot outside of it.
This trip to Scotland is at the behest of a former pupil, Margot Maas,
who she hasn't seen for 13 years. Despite the unaccustomed chill of a
Scottish summer, which has pounced on her sinuses, she is entranced by
what she's found.
Best of all she has found that dance, her dance, stretches across
continents and age groups. Already children in Drumchapel and matrons in
Milngavie have felt within their bones and muscles the flow of a
Verchinina move. It is essential energy, a life force that -- like the
lady herself -- only finds its true release in creating movement with
feeling.
* Nina Verchinina will be teaching in and around Glasgow until June
15. Details of her classes can be had from Margot Maas on 0141-956 2782.

<HEADLINE>Environmental groups express joy over North Sea agreement UK defies ban over chemical dumping</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977961179</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NORTH Sea nations except for Britain agreed yesterday to ban dumping
of hazardous chemicals within 25 years.
However, they failed to act on a crisis over fish stocks.
Environmental lobby groups were ecstatic about the chemicals agreement
but poured scorn on the failure on fishing.
Chemical companies will have to phase out all discharges of synthetic
substances like PCBs and dioxins into air, sea or land, Ministers agreed
at an environment conference in Esbjerg, Denmark.
Britain was unwilling to sign up, saying there was not yet a
technically feasible solution to the problem.
''As in the past, the United Kingdom will not sign up to agree a
course of action unless we can precisely meet the obligation required,''
Environment Secretary John Gummer told a press conference.
The ministers decided to meet again before the end of 1996 to discuss
the fisheries crisis. Over-fishing has depleted North Sea stocks of cod
and other commercial varieties to dangerous levels.
''Environmental concerns will now be considered at all levels of
fisheries policies,'' said Mr Svend Auken, chairman of the conference
and Denmark's environment minister.
''A meeting will take place by the end of 1996 and will tighten rules
on fishing,'' he told the press conference.
The Fourth International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea
comprises nations which have North Sea borders, or which have large
rivers flowing into it.
The participants were Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the European
Union.
Seas at Risk, a federation of international groups concerned with the
protection and restoration of the marine environment, believes the
chemicals decision is a landmark.
''There is now a clear goal for chemical companies to put their house
in order. There has been confusion from regulators in the past about the
safe level of synthetic substances. Now everyone will know there is no
safe level and man-made items like dioxins and PCBs can no longer be
dumped,'' said Mr John Maggs, Seas at Risk co-ordinator.
Greenpeace agreed, calling the agreement a major breakthrough, and a
defeat for the chemicals industry.
''Years of campaigning by Greenpeace have finally paid off,'' Mr Tim
Birch, Greenpeace North Sea campaigner, said in a statement that made no
reference to the possible impact of the UK decision.
''North Sea governments now recognise that it's unacceptable to allow
industries to dump toxic waste into rivers and the sea.
''Provided governments live up to this agreement, the North Sea now
has a chance to recover after years of abuse. This is a resounding
defeat for the chemical industry, who have always seen the seas as their
private sewer,'' said Mr Birch.
Greenpeace said the failure to act to help North Sea fish stocks
showed a lack of political will.
Seas at Risk had earlier urged action including lower fish harvest
quotas and reform of Europe's Common Fisheries Policy.
Ministers also agreed to disagree on Britain's decision to dump the
massive oil installation Brent Spar in deep Atlantic waters.
* A new battle between Greenpeace and Shell broke out last night as
protesters in inflatable boats repeatedly tried to board the Brent Spar
and were fought off by seven tugs using fire hoses.
Captain Margreet Bunnik of the Greenpeace ship Moby Dick said: ''Shell
is busy with explosives, getting ready to blow the anchor chains so they
can tow the Brent Spar away. We are trying to interfere with their work.
It's the only thing we can do.'' Speaking by satellite phone, Captain
Bunnik said the protesters had interrupted the work for an hour.

IN America a male model in a flak jacket with PRESS written on the
back would have been kicking in the door with the SWAT team and
demanding of Miguel ''Hey, so how's it feel to be a crack dealer?'' In
Britain, where we know what good taste is, Maggie Philbin is dispatched
to beguile into incoherence some poor, exhausted woman who has just
given birth.
Television reality is not what it was. The US industry decided long
ago that we can't have enough of the stuff but forgot to mention that
all TV cameras are fitted with distorting lenses and that their mere
presence renders the real surreal.
Hospital Watch (BBC1), taken four times a day for a week, was
sugar-coated medicine. Voyeurism disguised as education, it was a drip
feed supplying more human interest stories than this human will ever be
interested in. Pretending to be educational, it served only as a
reminder that what goes on in our insides has no business on the
outside.
The mystique of the institution, now permeating every cranny of
British TV in cop shows, fire shows, squaddie shows, doc shows, is
subtly pernicious. In the case of Hospital Watch it had the effect of
saying ''Never mind what ails the NHS. Forget the politics. Saintly,
self-sacrificing types will always see us through''.
The BBC once reserved this sort of treatment for badgers, owls, and
urban foxes. Now that it has discovered the joys of real, live guinea
pigs there's no telling where it will all end. Nurse, the screens . . .
None of which is to suggest that British television does its favourite
things badly at the technical level. In a way, that's the pity of it.
Much talent is applied, as in the case of Out of the Blue (BBC1,
Tuesday), to make yet another routine cop show watchable. This week
computer pornography (fast becoming a favourite plot-line) led to the
discovery of a murder while overwrought John Hannah continued his fight
to stay on active duty.
As is obligatory, the tangled lives of the coppers were given as much
attention as their work. As is customary, the acting was well-nigh
faultless. But you couldn't help but think that British actors do this
stuff so well because they've done it so often. Imagine Cracker, that
highly praised innovation, without Coltrane's Fitz and you are left with
something very like Out of the Blue. Is that praise or blame? Concerning
Screen Two's Black Easter (BBC2, Sunday) there can be no equivocation.
Poor Trevor Eve must have thought at the start of the year that he had
the makings of a comeback on his hands. After the risible Politician's
Wife and this botched attempt at political science fiction, a Shoestring
revival might be his best bet.
Starting from the solid premise that Fortress Europe, faced with tidal
waves of Arab and East European refugees, will shortly begin to
institutionalise its racism, Black Easter created a plausible nightmare
world of internment camps, refugee smugglers, and murder.
Then, as though the complete breakdown of society wasn't quite enough,
its makers seemed to decide that what was needed for a really good
ending was a complicated spot of genocide. Germans, ethnic minorities,
mass murder: remind you of anything? As Alex Fischer, a Dresden
detective whose own life was a mess, Eve did well enough, but Black
Easter told this reviewer only that history doesn't repeat itself half
as often as TV drama.
Say what you like about Carla Lane, animal rights activist and
screenwriter, she has managed never to repeat herself. Searching (ITV,
Thursday) is a clever idea, amusing rather than hilarious in its first
outing, that could yet develop into something memorable. Like Next of
Kin (BBC1, Monday), it is part of what might be termed the School of
Hurtful Comedy, flirting with real pain while maintaining the
traditional, cheerfully eccentric values of the sit-com.
Here Prunella Scales is the busy, batty, born-again founder of a
refuge for women with personality problems. Though these range from
serial husband-banjoing to kleptomania, the compulsive pulling of
communication cords, paranoia, and one woman's taste for throwing
herself out of windows, their common root is men. Lousy men; hectoring
men; unfaithful men; unreliable men. It is, in sum, the old
can't-live-with-them-can't-live-without-them disease. Men are bad and
women go mad.
Who's to argue? What Lane has done is to create a structure in which
women can talk about a useless husband who can't even bury a dead
gerbil, a father who won't listen and won't shut up, and a fiance who is
making off with the best friend. If farce is kept at bay, Searching will
do well.
Bob Monkhouse could only keep farce at bay if he armed himself with a
big stick and rubber gloves. It clings to him, like the radioactive glow
from his perfect teeth and the smarm that drips from his every word. Yet
even he, as presenter, was no match for the ITV Movie Awards 1995 (ITV,
Wednesday).
It would be easy to blame the readers of the TV Times whose votes made
this nonsense possible. But it was not they who defined categories of
filmic art such as Best Shoot Out, Best Female Body, and Best Screen
Kiss.
Equally, it was not the readers who decreed that the whole thing
should be staged, presumably at vast expense, in Los Angeles to spare
the stars unnecessary effort.
As it turned out, most of the biggies, who know a D-list event when
they see one, found other things to do, confining themselves to filmed
spots in which they said how very thrilled they were. It was all about
as sincere as Monkhouse's smile and the feelings, rest assured, were not
mutual.

Fashion is a passion for shoppers whether rich or poor and Glasgow's
shops offer a wide variety of clothing from mix'n'match items to
designer labels. But, as Anvar Khan reports, the desire for a trendy
wardrobe can sometimes be put ahead of life's necessities
BUYING fashionable clothes should be like slinging coins into a puggy;
cheap, populist and nasty, with little or no return. Fashion is
ephemeral. Any other medium would be lampooned if it was just as
transient. Given the short-term shelf life of any particular trendy
item, fashion, surely, can't demand high prices. But it does.
Superlager city is fired up with culture of the supermodel. Image is
all. Glasgow has begun to enjoy international status as a city where
more fashion is sold than any of its European counterparts. Indeed, the
arrival of The Clothes Show (June 17-20) is a nod of London approval. In
the city of the bag lady and the Big Issue vendor (in fact, distance can
now be measured using the ubiquitous seller, as in: Princes Square is
approximately two Big Issue vendors to your left), the purchase of a set
of clothes has become a superior and serious affair.
To High Street gals, the city of Glasgow is a place to shop around, to
buy within budget, to spread the cost of an outfit over several stores.
To designer darlings, places like the Italian Centre are a corner shop
where they can buy a whole ensemble.
This is a remarkable phenomenon. One in five Scots are on some kind of
benefit. In the UK, the income of the poor has decreased 17% over the
past decade while the average income of the wealthy has increased 36%.
This is a complete polarisation of means.
If the city centre, therefore, comes on like a designer metropolis,
then that is the icing on the cake. Decor can't masquerade as structure.
In other words, just because wealthy citizens are name-checked by the
presence of Gaultier or Miayake it doesn't mean the very well-off are a
significant percentage of the Scottish population.
There is money here. But it belongs to few. So few in fact, that when
my colleague and I were fretting that the metallic-blue leather jacket
featured here might be sold at the weekend before the shoot we were
reassured by a salesman from Red or Dead that there would be ''no chance
of anyone spending that money''. It costs #370.
It is important to acknowledge the elite shopper. Just as left-wing
politics are presumed to be genetically implanted at birth into every
Scotsman/person, the urge for a #3000 suit is assumed to be the motor
behind every Glaswegian act. Not everybody wants to work in order to buy
labels.
What galls objective shoppers, the ones prepared to buy the full kit
from C&amp;A, is that designer culture is concerned with what you wear, not
what you do. That is ned culture, it's just showing off, nothing more,
nothing less than bragging.
Sporting a designer label is a form of thuggery; it's just taking out
an advert on the size of your wallet, flaunting money without the class
acquired by personal integrity. A label is like someone giving you a
makeover, it's their idea of what looks good.
Women should be more appalled. A lot of famous designers are
misogynists, gay men with an agenda to set not only the style of a
woman's clothing but the shape of her body, and make a hunchback of her
self-esteem.
High Street girls have less money to spend on clothes, but still want
a range of gear comparable to that of the catwalk, not in price but in
contemporary colour. In this way Glaswegians can be compared with the
Italians or the Venezuelans.
An Italian can live in a basic house and be wearing a Swiss
gold-plated watch and a silk suit. They spend money on themselves, not
their home. In Cracus, Venezuela, the women spend money on perfume,
sheer stockings, and flashy clothes, abysmally happy Come Dancing
numbers with sequins and organza, while sleeping on a mat in a cave.
Avon sells more products in poorer South American countries than all
of Britain. Well, this is what designer culture is about. The ability to
draw a blank over quality of life and lust after quality of clothing.
It's important to remember that in fashion, perspective is everything.
While civilians creep alongside armoured carriers to avoid being shot
(Bosnia), and blind gurus tread the line between spiritual leadership
and terrorism (Japan), it is important, and sometimes difficult, to
remember, that what you wear counts. Out of such chaos comes therapy.
Men and women spend a significant amount of money on the person they
want to project. It's one of the few things within control.

THE overweight man with the piggy eyes and the bad Elvis Presley
haircut strolls confidently through the double doors of his Manhattan
boardroom followed closely by an elegant and beautiful woman. ''This,''
he says by way of introduction, ''is the legendary Selina Scott.'' She
is, he boasts, ''the biggest in Europe''. One is inclined to ask ''The
biggest what?''
The man is Donald Trump. A greedy New York property speculator with a
sharp eye for self-publicity. The only mildly interesting thing about
him is the fact that, until his spectacular downfall after the Wall
Street crash of the late 80s, his personal fortune was about the same as
Bolivia's national debt. After that he's just a boring bloke who built a
tower and named it after himself. Oh, and he also owns casinos.
Selina Scott Meets Donald Trump (ITV, Tuesday) is a superficial
documentary about a superficial man. A man whose heroes, Howard Hughes
and Richard Nixon, are villains. If it proves anything it is the fact
that all that's gold does not necessarily glitter. Brooklyn-born Trump
surrounds himself with the vulgar trappings of new money. The only thing
that's missing from the gilt-edged walls of his Trump Tower penthouse
apartment is the picture of the Burmese Lady (and if the original came
up for auction, he'd probably buy it).
But for (the legendary) Selina Scott he is clearly a fascinating
character. A powerful man worthy of her professional attention. She
talks of him in poor broadcasting cliches. The only one she avoids is
''Coming up Trumps''. Maybe it ended up on the cutting-room floor.
We see (the legendary) Selina smoothing herself into the back-seat
luxury of Trump's limousine, a motor car which is bigger than Chicago.
We see (the legendary) Selina beside Trump in the plush leather
armchairs of his private jet, the interior of which seems to bear a
striking similarity to a Romany caravan. We see (the legendary) Selina
an awful lot.
At one point Trump turns to (the legendary) Selina and says: ''I love
beautiful things. Which is why I like you so much.'' She smiles
demurely. The Lady and the Trump. It is time to pass the sick bag.
The lavish programme, which must have cost a pretty penny to make, is
a joint production between (the legendary) Selina's own independent,
Scott-Bellendaine, and Grampian Television. It is part of Ms Scott's
occasional series on the lives of the rich and famous (she has already
covered Prince Charles and the Spanish royal family). And it is
television designed for Hello! magazine readers. In the tough,
dog-pat-dog, world of television, it can now be only a matter of time
before another easily-impressed presenter makes a documentary about (the
legendary) Selina Scott.
The point to, or excuse for, this particular visual orgy of mutual
admiration is, I suppose, the fact that Trump made a killing and then
lost it. And now he's apparently bouncing back again. In effect, it is
an advert for Donald. There are, to be fair, some interviews with
Trump's detractors, a couple of New York property journalists, and a few
critical questions from (the legendary) Selina, questions which would be
hard-pushed to pierce an ear, quite frankly. The problem with
''celebrity'' interviews is that they are always tightly controlled by
the subject. Under the terms and conditions laid down by them.
According to the producer of this documentary, Ted Brocklebank, it was
no easy task gaining access to Trump, who had reputedly prevented two
documentaries about him from being broadcast in the past. It was, said
Brocklebank, ''Selina who managed to swing it''. This is apparently
because Trump likes to deal with ''what he believes is the best''. Or
perhaps that should be easiest. Or softest. Scott does not so much grill
her interviewee; she lightly sautes him. It must be a bit like being
mauled by a cushion.
Grampian's kilt (there should always be a Scottish connection) is
provided by an interview with Trump's mother, Mary MacLeod, a Barbara
Cartland lookalike who emigrated to America from Lewis as a teenager in
the 30s.
There is a point during the documentary when Trump attempts to
illustrate how poor he was after his empire crashed. He was walking down
Fifth Avenue with his (soon to be) second wife Marla when he saw a
beggar with a can.
He says: ''He was asking for money from people -- he has got a dog and
he's blind. I pointed to him and said 'You see that man, he is worth
$900m dollars more than me.' And Marla said, a little naively and cute,
'What do you mean? He's not worth $900m?' And I said 'No, let's assume
he is worth nothing. But I am worth minus $900m'.''
Let's assume that it would have made a better, and at least worthy,
documentary for (the legendary) Selina to follow the beggar rather than
Donald Trump.
* WHEN a copy of the script for BBC1's new five-part drama serial,
Oliver's Travels, landed on Bill Paterson's desk, his attention was
drawn to page 28 of episode two. There the writer, Alan Plater, had
indicated the entry of a new character with a handwritten note in the
margin. It read: ''With all due respect to other Equity members, this is
the Bill Paterson part.''
The Scots actor was understandably flattered that one of Britain's
finest authors and dramatists had him in mind for the role of Baxter, a
mysterious figure who shadows the two principal characters (Alan Bates
and Sinead Cusack) on their odyssey around modern-day Britain.
Paterson, however, was puzzled as to why the writer should have
singled him out for the part. The two were not mutually acquainted.
''Maybe Alan had seen me playing similar parts before. Anyway, I thought
I'd better snap it up,'' he says.
As it turned out, the choice of Bill Paterson would appear to be one
of the few casting decisions with which Plater wholeheartedly agreed.
Indeed, he described the actor's performance as ''peerless''. But,
according to recent reports, the 60-year-old author has expressed his
concern at the way the BBC has treated his script. ''It is fair to say
that I'm pretty grouchy about this,'' he told one newspaper.
Oliver's Travels (BBC1, Sunday) is an adaptation of Plater's novel of
the same name which was published last year. He describes the plot in
succinct terms thus: ''It is about a man called Oliver who goes on a
journey from South Wales to the Orkneys. On the way he falls in love
with a woman called Diane and together they have thrilling adventures
and solve a murder mystery.''
In the serial the writer fuses his pleasures -- jazz music,
crosswords, football, trivia, and puns -- with his modern prejudices . .
. he has an aversion to the security industry and to company logos, for
instance. Oliver (Bates) is a middle-aged lecturer who is made redundant
from his college post. So, with his retirement gift of a matching set of
suitcases in hand, he embarks on a journey to seek out one of his
heroes, a daily newspaper crossword compiler who is known only as
Aristotle.
The problem is that Aristotle has gone missing. So Oliver combines
forces with a young detective, WPC Diane Priest (Cusack), and the pair
set off on a journey around Britain in search of the enigmatic crossword
compiler. Romance blossoms between the pair as they encounter a series
of strange characters in their search for clues.
The problem is that something happened on the way to the television
screen, something which made the writer, as he says, ''grouchy''. As
arguably Britain's most successful TV dramatist (he cut his teeth on Z
Cars, moved on to Softly Softly, and later wrote some of the most
memorable scripts of their respective times in Fortunes Of War, The
Barchester Chronicles, A Very British Coup, and the Beiderbecke
trilogy), he was well-used to the slings and arrows of outrageous
television producers. But with Oliver's Travels he has publicly
expressed his disappointment with, among other things, the central
casting (he would have preferred his friend Tom Courtenay as Oliver),
the music (Carl Davis provided a jazz score), elements of the direction
(by Giles Foster who made Hotel Du Lac, and The Rector's Wife), and the
ending (which is not what Plater wrote). Apart from that he loves the
serial.
He claims that the production team totally misunderstood the tone of
the piece. His work, he says, tends towards low-key comedy charred at
the edges with melancholy, and the remembrance of something precious
that was lost so long ago. It flourishes best ''with invisible acting
and directing''.
Plater also says that a key element in the tale was ''the gradual
change in speech patterns'' as Oliver journeys north. His intention was
to explore the richness and diversity of dialect but someone in the
casting department had ''a tin-ear''. This resulted in Plater
rearranging the script in order to explain why someone from the Welsh
borders spoke with an East-End accent.
Much of the filming was shot on location around Kyle of Lochalsh and
the Orkneys. Despite Plater's misgivings, Oliver's Travels is a
delightful and at times whimsical mystery. At once a comedy, a thriller,
a romance, and a reflection of British life through middle-aged eyes. It
really is well worth watching.
Plater explained: ''The story started as an idea two or three years
ago. The Times crossword has always left me totally bemused and baffled.
It all grew out of that, the notion of a man who is obsessed with
crosswords and then takes a sideways step towards trivia quizzes,
lateral thinking.
''It is three things really. It is an investigative mystery story
which turns all the conventions inside out. It's also a love story
which, again, turns conventions on their head. And finally, by taking
Oliver on a journey from South Wales to the Orkneys we go through a
large cross-section of the country, its geography, psychology, and
history.''
Bill Paterson, meanwhile, seems happy with the final product. Baxter,
he explains, is an evil figure who still has some funny lines. The
script is not only literate and witty it is also packed with irony --
and the actor likes that.
''I had probably more time than Alan and Sinead to look around the
locations in which we filmed -- and loved it. Most of it was new
territory for me, though it was great to return to the Orkneys. I hadn't
been there for 20 years since I worked for 7:84 touring the Highlands.
The play I was in (The Cheviot, The Stag, and The Black, Black Oil) was
all about the oil boom and it was a dead loss in Orkney because no-one
was interested in the subject at that stage. I'm sure it would be
different this time,'' he explains.

PROFILE
The Rugby Man
BIG Gavin Campling, the rugby superstar, had finally got away from it
all. They had been frantic, these past few days before their crucial
World Cup final. The press officer wanted him to do a 10-minute video,
rather than submit to yet another mass interview -- 34 television and
radio stations, and 300 sports writers.
The New Zealanders had made a video, after all, to spare their
monolithic Tongan winger a media grilling.
''Not me,'' said Gav. ''I'll do the lot.''
Unfortunately, there were the inevitable moronic questions: ''How
heavy are you?''
''Seventeen and a half stones,'' he said politely. It must have been
in a thousand cuttings and computer files during the past 10 seasons.
''Gosh, and all that muscle . . .'' The female interviewer from the pop
magazine, breathless, reached a tentative hand towards his thigh: ''Does
your girlfriend iron your shorts?''
''I'm married.'' The hand snatched back.
Thankfully these preview interviews would soon be over for keeps. Only
the match to come, then retirement. The bimbo had avoided nitty-gritty
issues: How bad are the knee and back problems? Is that why you're
quitting? Are you going to be one of these former players we see
hirpling into Murrayfield, double hip replacements at 50?
What would he have said? He'd have sidestepped the issue as neatly as
he did opponents on the pitch, and saved the truth for the book.
That should earn a few bob, a few rand, too, when he spilled the beans
about those arrogant Afrikaners.
Latest publishers' bidding on the advance for his book was encouraging
-- #30,000 and rising.
''Mustn't distract myself, thinking about that. Concentrate on The
Game,'' he mused. Still, the chapter on his injuries would be a powerful
selling-point when it came to serialisation rights -- Campling's Agony
-- I'll never play rugby with my grandchildren.
All the boys knew there was a price to pay. ''Going to war'' was how
some described crunch internationals. Some would carry the wounds for
life. Tragically, a very few went out in a wheelchair. He knew that he
already bore early symptoms of arthritis.
What an irony. Having rejected the illegal help which steroids would
have made to his career he was faced with the possibility that some day
a long-acting steroid would be injected into his joints to relieve the
painful legacy of a glittering career.
But there was another legacy. The money. ''No pain, no gain,'' his
coaches had dinned into him as he thumped the tackle bags as a
schoolboy. Campling grinned. He'd had his share of pain, emotional as
well as physical, but soon he would gain plenty.
Sure, he has done well enough, playing with clubs in France and Italy.
They knew how to look after a chap. House, car, feted in the
restaurants, free entertainment, and passes to clubs. Ample pocket
money. Everyone turned a blind eye. Not like these pedantic corinthians
at the Scottish Rugby Union.
Well, soon he would reap the financial rewards he had supposedly been
banned from accepting -- and which his successors would soon enjoy,
carte blanche. The SRU would be squirming. Welcome to the real world.
Murdoch's rampaging takeover of League, to feed the all-consuming
appetite of his satellite TV firm, could easily blow Union out of the
water. At worst, it would force Union's authorities to surrender their
entrenched position. Most of his contemporaries were agreed on that, and
would be happy to accept it.
If some clubs went to the wall, unwilling to come to terms with
commercialism, or unable to generate the funds to sustain the modern
game, well, that was a pity. But market forces would rule 21st-century
sport.
Professional guys -- doctors, lawyers, accountants, the farmers,
graduates on a career ladder -- would have to choose: full-time rugby or
a ''real job''. Asking for time off was the single most stressful aspect
of playing international rugby.
At present, a few benevolent bosses can just about balance the dubious
advantages of employing an internationalist against giving time off for
training and touring. There would be none of that in the professional
world. Even the Scotland director of rugby, Jim Telfer, admitted that in
his previous existence as a head teacher he would not have employed an
international player.
After 10 years at the top, 65 international caps, 48 as national team
captain, and captain on three Lions tours, Campling knew the game inside
out. Yes, it sure was changing.
He'd heard that during the 1974 Lions tour, some of the boys dropped a
piano from the sixth floor. Perhaps the public-school element, who could
afford to pay for a damaged piano, are less of a force, but piano
gymnastics and regular boozing were now a relic. Now, mostly, they
sipped fruit juice or water. Even low-alcohol beers could send a
confused message.
Ironic that a near-teetotal sport at the highest level should be
backed by one of the country's biggest brewers. Campling had had a
lucrative marketing consultancy offer from them. It would not clash with
his man-management advisory company -- #7500 a day was the going fee for
the one run by the England captain.
His wife would expand her chain of sports shops, Campling Gear, while
he planned to open a clothing company. A former England star had become
a millionaire from that. Yes, life was going to be very interesting, not
to mention financially fulfilling, after the boots were hung up . . .
It will be even more fulfilling for those who follow our mythical
stereotype of the modern international rugby union player. Many players
are convinced that by the next World Cup their game will be professional
to some extent. With the financial rewards, however, will come new
responsibilities and pressures, physical and psychological.
Gavin Hastings, David Campese, and Will Carling, as amateurs, are in
the fortunate position of being able to say ''No, thank you,'' to
unwanted engagements. That will change. Pros perform to order.
The retired rugby star, if personable, intelligent, and articulate,
will do very nicely: after-dinner speaking, corporate hospitality, a
newspaper column, perhaps some TV work. A game show? That worked for
Bill Beaumont. Modelling? Open a few stores? There could be a decent
career there. Arnold Palmer still makes close to $10m a year, long past
his sell-by date on the golf course. Heavens, some of the public think
Andy Irvine is still playing rugby.
The modern player knows all about image. The difference between rugby
and football players used to be that the latter were the ones who washed
and styled their hair before games. Not now. Some of the Scotland XV can
be spotted sporting gel. Then there is special-effects tailoring. One
member of the current squad gets his mum to cut a wee vee in the sides
of his shorts. It gives greater freedom of movement, but he also knows
it fair draws the lasses' attention to his powerful thighs.
And watch for the tiny band of white bobby sox, protruding just above
the boot line. It's not part of the official strip, but one or two of
the chaps wear them -- it accentuates the ankle and calf muscles.
Shoulder pads, though illegal, enhance many a player's physique.
It's all harmless vanity, a little bit of arrogance -- an essential
ingredient which helps give the lads that extra one percent which, in
today's sport, is often the difference between success and failure.
Though deriving a boyish buzz from appearing in adverts, they soon
become commercially aware. A close look at players' boots sometimes
reveals the trademark logo to have been blacked out, to conform with the
SRU's contractual obligations -- and disguise the fact that the
''wrong'' boots are being worn.
Times have changed since the forwards worked together in one group,
and backs in another. Scots work on individually tailored programmes,
laid out by David McLean, who has been with the SRU since 1978,
initially as physiotherapist.
When fitness adviser McLean started out, the former international
captain Ian McLauchlan was the only player in the squad using weights.
Now they all do.
Clubs were happy if they could get players to train twice a week.
Individual skills were the priority, unit skills and tactical awareness
next, fitness a poor third, and you trained only as hard as you had to.
Only in the past few years has fitness become a major factor.
International players now work out six days a week, often twice a day:
early morning, 7am, then lunchtime is a favoured pattern, causing least
disruption to family life.
Their average weight has soared, less because of weights, more through
environmental factors. Average heights and weights in society have
increased. But players are given strict dietary advice. In 1980, the
average internationalist's body-fat content was 19%. Now it is 15%.
Players are much more individually self-disciplined.
Beer-bellied forwards are dinosaurs. No more sumo ballast in the front
five. The demands of the modern game are for more weight, but it must be
nimble on the hoof. The duration of passages of play are longer, and
high-speed hits from heavier, more mobile players, have increased joint
damage significantly. The tackler and the tackled are the principal
injury victims of the modern game, according to SRU medical advisor,
surgeon Donald Macleod.
Despite Mr Macleod's assurances in a Lancet article this week, to the
effect that the incidence of injury in Scottish rugby is more modest
than perceived, it is also a fact that a South African study of
front-five forwards, by Professor A T Sher, found extensive degenerative
changes in the neck.
The requirement to pop the ball up in the tackle causes damage to
elbows, and the jarring also leads to damage in the upper part of the
shoulder joint. Line-out jumpers, brought down with two players on top
of them, are prone to similar problems.
Playing with taped fingers to protect routine damage to the lower
joint of the finger is a common sight.
Broken noses are a regular feature -- 30% of the Springbok team are
victims. But of more concern is damage to the cheek bone and facial
nerve which often accompanies such injuries. It can affect sinuses and
impair the function of muscles which control the eye.
Self-imposed injuries, muscular-skeletal problems, cost 8% of training
days on the Scotland tours of the early and mid 80s. But player
education has almost eliminated these. Fitness consultant McLean has
kept a tally, and over the 1990 New Zealand tour and 1991 World Cup,
they were reduced to 0.01%.
Training has to be rugby specific. Scientific tests have proved that
pumping iron alone, or increased straight-line speed, does not
necessarily improve a player's strength or pace in swerving, zig-zagging
runs. But the surface on which rugby sprint training is done has to be
consistent, hence the eight-lane tartan track at Murrayfield.
These changes are taking place because, under Telfer, the SRU is
listening to what many experienced voices have been telling them for
years. And it is changing the profile of the modern player.
Campling's successors are destined for a secure future, if they can
cope with the increased demands and pressures. Rugby has yet to become a
truly global game, but if it does, Campling's successors could be the
Jordans, Gretskys, and Maradonnas of tommorrow.
''Satellite TV could hasten that,'' mused Campling. Heavens. He could
barely dare think of it even now. A few months to reap the immediate
Union rewards, get his book on the Christmas best-seller lists,
negotiate the film and video rights, then drop the bombshell, well
co-ordinated, of course, with the TV and Wigan press offices: ''Campling
out of retirement -- captain turns to Rugby League.''
Many players are convinced that by the next World Cup their game will
be professional to some extent

THE story of how British-trained agents assassinated the hated head of
Nazi Germany's secret police is also told in the published papers.
The Special Operations Executive team, parachuted into Czechoslovakia
for Operation Anthropoid in December 1941, carried suicide tablets.
''They know that they cannot come out of the attempt alive,'' said one
of the planning reports.
Security chief Reinhard Heydrich, who was also deputy leader of the SS
under Heinrich Himmler, the man who organised the extermination of Jews
in Nazi Europe, had launched a reign of terror after being posted to
Czechoslovakia.
His assassination was followed by appalling civilian reprisals by the
Nazi occupation forces.
One village, Lidice, was reduced to rubble, the site remaining
untouched to this day as a memorial to the 2000 inhabitants who were
murdered.
Heydrich lived in a castle in Prague where the agents were ordered to
pose as street sweepers.
Czech paratroopers Jan Kubis and Josef Gabcik waited nearly five
months for their opportunity.
A British report said: ''Seven months to the day after Heydrich's
first arrival in Prague, at the moment when his car had slowed down at a
corner, one man threw a bomb which exploded on impact close to the car.
''At the same time, the second man fired a sub-machine gun or
automatic rifle. Heydrich was hit by at least one bullet, which has
since been removed from the neck close to the spinal column.''
The police chief died of his wounds nine days later.
Agents Kubis and Gabcik were betrayed to the Gestapo and never seen
again.

THE federalist dream of a United States of Europe is dead, according
to the President of the European Parliament, Dr Klaus Hansch.
Speaking in Edinburgh yesterday, he said a ''new realism'' in the
European Parliament had disappointed some ardent federalists but
reflected the changing priorities of the Parliament which was elected
last June.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister John Major flew to Paris last night to join
fellow EU leaders for talks which can only highlight Britain's growing
isolation in the debate on the future of Europe.
On a single currency, social policy and, most glaringly, on the right
to keep a national veto over Euro decisions, Britain is a loud and
generally lonely voice in opposition.
Making a keynote speech on the European Parliament and next year's
Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Hansch said: ''Parliament's more
realistic agenda for 1996 simply corresponds to political reality. I
say, with a certain heavy heart, that the old federalist dream is dead.
''The creation of a United States of Europe on some American, German,
or Swiss model is quite simply not practical politics in a union of 15
member states.''
Mr Hansch said earlier that a resolution adopted by Parliament in May
was marked by what he called a sense of strategic realism, adding:
''There is no mention of the drawing up of a fully-fledged constitution
for the Union. Still less is there a text of such a constitution.''
He added: ''Similarly, Parliament says that the 1996 conference
'should primarily concentrate not on transferring new powers to the EU
institutions, but on clarifying their respective roles and on achieving
an appropriate balance between them.' In other words, the Union should
be doing what it does better, and not undertaking extra tasks.''
Speaking at Edinburgh University's Europa Institute, Mr Hansch said
the central question for 1996 was how to win back legitimacy and support
for the European Union.
The reason why Euro-scepticism had gained ground in all member states,
not just Britain, was because ''Europe does not seem to find the answer
to people's concerns: unemployment, environmental damage, weakening of
social services, crime in the streets, and falling living standards.
''If we are to gain public support for the European project, then we
must find European solutions to the real problems.''
He said that he believed European citizens see three major problems
with the way the Union is run.
* The union seems incapable of taking decisions and takes decisions
too slowly.
* There is an absence of democracy and the people of Europe do not
feel they can exercise control over decisions taken at the European
level.
* No-one has any idea who decides what and who is responsible for what
in the Union.
Later, he spoke of the prospects for agreement between the member
states in 1996 and said there were grounds for optimism about some of
the Parliament's proposals.
However, warning that agreement was vital, he said: ''If we do not
organise ourselves through a set of common institutions which work to
resolve common problems, then there is a danger of slipping back into
the old alliances and national reflexes that governed behaviour in
Europe in the past.
''We would be very unwise to claim that Europe has outgrown the
rivalries that have marred the past centuries,'' he said. ''On our own
doorstep, we see a region slipping back towards the barbarities of the
earlier twentieth century.''
Mr Hansch added that, although reaching agreement might require
flexible solutions, Parliament strongly opposed generalising a system of
opt-outs from Union policies as these would undermine the ''principal of
solidarity'' that is at the heart of the Union.
''If member states only participate in those policies in which they
have a narrow economic or financial interest, the whole of the Union's
achievements will start to unravel,'' he said.
In a warning to member states which did opt-out, he pointed out that
the Parliament's resolution stated that consideration would be given to
proceeding without the minority and providing instruments to enable a
member state to leave the EU if there was a failure to reach a unanimous
decision.
''We should aim to move forward together. But there may come a time
when the majority of member states will not accept that all progress
could be blocked by a small minority of member states,'' he added.
There will be little comfort for Mr Major at the Elysee Palace dinner
hosted by new French President Jacques Chirac.

It could be you: Gavin Bell reports on the dangers of gambling and on
fears that the National Lottery could lead to addiction
A DOZEN men are gathered in an upper room of a church on the South
Side of Glasgow. They are seated on an assortment of old sofas and
benches, around a plain wooden table. On the table is a sign bearing
their mantra of secrecy: ''Whom you see here, what you hear here, when
you leave here, let it stay here.''
They are all habitual liars and cheats, and some of them are thieves.
But they all have the courage and honesty to admit to an addiction that
has dragged them to deceit and worse -- they are compulsive gamblers,
and this is a meeting of Gamblers Anonymous.
Similar meetings are taking place at the same time in Edinburgh,
Dundee, Aberdeen, and Glenrothes, discreet symptoms of a chronic social
illness which psychologists fear could spread with the advent of the
National Lottery.
A recent study by market analysts Mintel confirmed that the lottery
has substantially increased the number of Britons gambling regularly in
one form or another, from 66% of the adult population in 1991 to 89%
last year. Scotland is above the national average in almost every
category, with 73% having a flutter on the lottery alone. The football
pools, and local lotteries and raffles, are the next most popular bets
with 39%, followed by bingo, pub machines, horse racing and card games.
For the vast majority, the occasional gamble is no more than a bit of
fun, a brief flirtation with Lady Luck in the hope of winning her
favour. For a small but growing number of people, however, the first bet
of any kind is a stumble into the pit of addiction. It is a hellish
place where decency and self-respect are destroyed by the compulsion to
beat the odds, where Dr Jekyll becomes Mr Hyde, and despair is the only
winner.
Ian Brown, senior lecturer in psychology at Glasgow University, says
there are grounds for concern that the lottery will draw thousands of
people into the web of compulsive gambling.
''The lottery is not a totally harmless form of gambling. From what we
know in the field of alcohol and drugs, the easy access to a great deal
more gambling will inevitably increase the number of people who have
problems with it. Some may become obsessed with the lottery itself, and
others may move on from it to other forms of gambling. I think the
coming of the National Lottery has alerted us to the potential for
gambling in general to get right out of hand.''
Mr Brown says reports have begun to emerge in scientific literature
that a few individuals are becoming addicted to the weekly draw and to
the affiliated scratch cards. The pattern has already been established
in the United States, where a significant number of callers to a
helpline for addicts in Maryland said their favourite form of gambling
was the state lottery.
He concludes: ''It is a danger we should be aware of. Gambling can
make just as good a job of destroying lives as alcohol and drugs.''
The men attending the Gamblers Anonymous meeting in Glasgow know that.
Each has his story of degradation to tell in a group therapy session, in
which the aim is to boost their resolve and their spirits by discussing
their addiction with fellow sufferers.
A middle-aged man, elected to chair the meeting, begins by introducing
himself: ''Alec, compulsive gambler, no gambling to report.'' His case
is typical. At the age of five, his father gave him threepenny bits to
take bets to the local bookmaker. It was his introduction to what
gamblers call their ''dream world'' -- a realm of fantasy in which
fabulous wealth is always just around the corner, and the next bet will
always recoup mounting losses. The reality, of course, is that the
illusion becomes a nightmare.
As a teenager, Alec became involved in card games in school toilets
and by the age of 15 he was betting regularly on horse racing. Casinos
were the next step, and by then he was lost. He was earning a decent
wage and good overtime as a policeman, but most of it went on gambling;
he persuaded a bank manager to loan him #1000 on the pretext of buying a
new car; he began to borrow heavily from his mother.
''I was always going to pay them back after my next big win, but I
just got into a deeper mess,'' he says. ''I always had good stories for
borrowing money, then one day they ran out. I couldn't think of any
more.''
Then the stealing began. When his mother began hiding her handbag, he
forged her signature on cheques. In three weeks, he gambled and lost
#3500 from her account. He got into fights, he was barred from casinos,
and he was existing on a can of soup a day.
''I was like a zombie; it was as if I was in a trance. It was total
hell. If ever anybody needed a miracle, it was me. I lost my job, I'd
nowhere to live, and I was thousands in debt. But I still didn't want to
leave the dream world.''
Reality finally intruded one Christmas Eve when he was alone, and
virtually penniless. His festive dinner was chips and beans, and he
burst into tears. Alec was lucky -- a friend put him in touch with
Gamblers Anonymous, and he is now rebuilding his life.
''I'm still struggling and I still get down sometimes,'' he confesses.
''But I know there's people I can turn to now, and that gambling's not
the answer. I'm keeping a flat going with wee casual jobs, and my mum
doesn't need to be terrified anymore when I come to her door.''
There is silence in the room when Alec stops speaking, a moment of
reflection on painful memories. He is thanked by several men, who then
relate similar stories of broken families and bankrupted businesses. A
youth remembers feeling like James Bond when he entered a casino, and
being close to tears when he left. A shopkeeper says he handled stolen
goods to finance his gambling, and a pensioner tells how he stole melons
from a supermarket so he could back horses with the money his wife had
given him for them.
Some are still struggling to come to terms with life outside the dream
world. Few have regular employment, and filling in long hours previously
devoted to gambling is hard.
Billy, a middle-aged man in a leather jacket, fiddling nervously with
a GA booklet, is asked how he is doing. ''I don't know how I'm doing,''
he says. ''I've tried to fathom it out. I'm sitting here feeling sick. I
don't know where to start. I'm in the limbo department. I spend that
much time in the garden I've got the best garden in the street, and I
drink more tea than anybody. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm
waiting for something to happen, but nothing's happening. But I'm happy
not to be gambling.''
There are nods of sympathy, and words of encouragement, for this is a
fellowship in which everybody understands what the others have gone
through. But there is also rough humour, and laughter at some of the
daft things they have done, which helps to ease tensions. Curiously,
there are no women.
During a tea break, one of the men explains: ''A few women come along
to the meetings sometimes. Usually their problem is spending their wages
and housekeeping money on the bingo. But I think they're put off by most
of us being men. Maybe we should think about having meetings just for
women.''
The men say they are not tempted by the lottery. It's a mug's game,
they say, a 14 million to one shot, a silly bet of no interest to the
professional gambler. But Alec the chairman says: ''It's still a bet
that takes people into the dream world. Most people are happy with that,
but some of us can't handle it.
''Remember, it always begins with a first bet. It's like a progressive
illness; you go through stages and it gets worse, the amount you bet and
what you'll do to get the stake money. It's like a bottomless pit you
can't climb out of, you just get in deeper and deeper.''
Outside the church, a newspaper billboard tied to a lamp-post says:
''Scratch and win #50,000.'' None of the men leaving the meeting looks
at it. It may be a daft wee bet, just a bit of fun, but for them it is
taboo.

As the trial of OJ Simpson continues, much more than the innocence of
a national celebrity is being questioned, as Anne Simpson reports.
OTHER than the jury's pronunciamento, is there anything left to be
said about the trial of Orenthal James Simpson? The courtroom
exploration of those words, Guilty or Not Guilty has so far cost the
people of Los Angeles a minimum of $4m, and although the defence will
not disclose how much its team has spent, there is persistent talk that
the sum exceeds $10m, propelling the accused into the jaws of
bankruptcy. ''If it came to that,'' says Johnnie L Cochran Jr, the
defendant's leading attorney, ''I would work without a fee. I don't know
how many of these other lawyers would be back . . .''
That comment, shrewdly crafted to suggest at least one man's honour is
intact, also points to the shaming mess this trial has become.
The defence team is not expected to begin its case until the end of
next month but the way things are going OJ ad nauseam may expand into
infinity, for since the double murder trial began last January an
average of two jurors a month have been dismissed from duty because of
contempt or allegations of racism and bullying. Thus the reserve pool of
vetted candidates has been reduced to two, and if this expulsion rate
continues the entire proceedings may become so unworkable a mistrial is
the only verdict in Court 103. Obviously a mistrial outcome would not
end the matter in anybody's mind, but should the remaining jurors now
hold together but return the hung verdict many boffins expect, then Los
Angeles would have to gird up the voyeuristic arena for a second trial.
Always reluctant to dim the lights on unfinished business, Gil
Garcetti, the district attorney of Los Angeles, is not ruling out the
possibility of a third trial, or even a fourth, but that would surely
bring America's legal system into further disrepute.
Meanwhile, in the event of an acquittal, the families of the victims
-- OJ Simpson's former wife Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald
Goldman -- are bristling with civil suits which demand that the accused
be found culpable of wrongful death, a claim far easier to prove than
murder.
So it may, indeed, continue, spilling over into the next millennium; a
disorderly circus crawling over the face of justice, bloating its own
wallet with every breath.
But there are signs of resistance, and perhaps it is inevitable that
the man who, at the start of the proceedings, was praised for his
unshowy wisdom and ability to curb the egos of legal thespians, today
finds himself condemned. Impatient for a verdict, bored by legalese, and
outraged by the self-promotion industry which has swollen up around this
trial, the public are fixing on Judge Lance Ito as the villain.
Maybe unwittingly he turned the event into couch-potato viewing by
allowing TV cameras to track almost every nuance of the trial but what
Judge Ito didn't realise was that couch-potatoes have retarded
concentration spans: never has so grizzly a drama struck so many
millions as so dull.
Nevertheless, the OJ TV ratings in America remain substantial, for the
nation watches this trial to confirm what it has long suspected -- the
lie at the core of the American dream.
False heroes, racism and fame ambushed by fate, this mythic disaster
has it all: OJ's history of brutal jealousy against his wife of Nordic
blondeness; the history of hate against blacks in the Los Angeles police
department; the rumours of mafia extortion, a drug deal gone wrong; the
accepted violence of many sportsmen against women; the ready assumption
that big money brings absolution, that star credentials pick prison
locks.
Adding to the chant of complaints, there are now distinguished legal
brains haranguing Judge Ito for permitting slack questioning,
time-wasting, general incompetence and disrespect in court.
Such criticism from his peers has obviously stung the judge. ''After
permitting the trial to get so far out of hand that lawyers were
constantly bickering and jurors dropping out or nodding off, the judge
has gotten tough,'' says Marc Fisher of the Washington Post. He now
fumes, fines misbehaving lawyers and fingers members of the public who
sit in court, wearing beepers, carrying newspapers, or otherwise
disturbing his new regime of discipline.
But it's too late, believes Fisher, who also suspects that the judge
and lawyers on either side of the case have become so infected by the
publicity virus they are now unable to suppress their own fever for
attention.
As for OJ Simpson's own demeanour, his financial problems may not be
as dire as widely reported. Since the trial began he has ordered new
custom-made suits and a dozen shirts and ties from an exclusive retailer
in California's Costa Mesa, where a typical two-piece is priced at about
#1500 and shirts sell at #200. According to jailhouse rules, Simpson's
wardrobe must contain no more than 10 suits at a time.
But one year after Nicole was found nearly decapitated and Goldman,
lying a few feet away, savagely knifed, the accused maintains the
impassive stillness of a statue, blinking back rare tears only when the
jury examines the gruesome autopsy photographs. For our part, we search
that magnificent head for a tremor of guilt, for terror, sorrow, hope.
And we see nothing.
''Show me a hero and I will write you a tragedy,'' said F Scott
Fitzgerald. He might have been writing about himself, but he might yet
have penned the last line on OJ Simpson, and the brawl America calls
justice.

HOSPITAL trusts in Scotland will have to seek more money from their
health boards to comply with the Government's latest edict on nurses'
pay, a chief executive warned yesterday.
Mr Donald McNeill, of South Ayrshire NHS Trust, said his agreement
with Ayrshire and Arran Health Board was in tatters as a result of
Virginia Bottomley's order to drop the strings from his 3% pay offer.
''It would be my intention to pay the 3%, but without the strings it
is going to cost us more,'' he said. ''I am going to have to find the
money somewhere.
''I am going to have to go back to my major purchaser, Ayrshire and
Arran Health Board. I have already signed an agreement with it to
provide health care for the people in our area, at a price agreed on the
basis of the national strategy of 3% achieved by locally negotiating
improvements in productivity.
''Force majeure tells me now that is not the strategy, but there is no
way I am going to see the nurses lose out.
''I am caught between a rock and a hard place on this. There is no
doubt most chief executives are in exactly the same position. I think
they will want at least to revisit their contracts with their
purchasers. We are going to be asking the Scottish Office what is going
on.''
Mr McNeill, one of the first general managers in Scotland to take his
hospital group into trust status, has been one of the most loyal
supporters of local pay bargaining, until now insisted upon by the
Government.
His offer was conditional on changes in the existing premium rates for
public holidays, weekend, and out-of-hours working, which would have
defrayed the cost of the award.
But he said: ''There does not seem to be a consistency about the
strategy. This letter from Virginia Bottomley certainly curtails one of
the main freedoms that trusts have, which is to negotiate pay and
conditions.
''One of the main planks was that we were going to be able to bring in
a cost improvement. Nurses are 40% of our costs -- if a cost improvement
programme for them is no longer on, that is a major issue.
''I don't know if the money will be there.''
He added: ''There is already frustration among our staff. Half of them
-- including 25% of the nurses -- are already on local contracts. They
are now wondering if that means the other half are ring-fenced with
their national conditions.''
Mr McNeill also deplored the split in the union coaltion which the
Government's agreement with the RCN has produced.
''The last thing I want is the staff organisations fragmenting. I want
them around the table together.''
Meanwhile, Unison's head of health for Scotland, Mr John Lambie,
attacked the apparent willingness of the RCN to accept local pay deals,
and called on the leadership to reconsider their stance.
''It is extremely disappointing. The assurances they have received
from the Government are totally inadequate and do not protect national
pay and national conditions of service for nursing staff and other
health care workers.
''No doubt the RCN position will bring comfort to the beleaguered
Health Minister and the Government, but will in no way help nurses or
other health service staff who have been fighting to retain their
hard-won terms and conditions of employment.''
Mrs Bottomley yesterday told NHS trusts to offer local pay deals to
nurses ''without delay''. She said she had written to the RCN's general
secretary, Ms Christine Hancock, welcoming the RCN agreement to reach
local settlements.
She told the Institute of Health Services Management in Harrogate: ''I
will do everything I can to encourage those trusts that have not yet
made pay offers to do so without delay. I want this conference to know
of my clear view on this subject -- there can be no reason now not to
make your offers straight away.''
NHS human resources director Ken Jarrold said: ''We understand the RCN
position is that it is willing to start negotiations now. But it has
said it will not reach settlements until it is satisfied it has a
certain volume of settlements.''

FOR the second time in two days a prisoner has escaped while under
prison officer escort in Glasgow.
Daniel Downie, 22, who was sentenced to six years for a knife attack
five months ago, escaped yesterday morning while attending Glasgow
Dental Hospital for treatment.
Twenty-four hours earlier, triple killer Andrew Gentle, an inmate at
HM Prison Greenock, escaped from his escort while on leave in the city.
Downie, a category B prisoner at Shotts Prison, is considered a
possible danger to the public and should not be approached, say prison
service sources.
Last January, Downie, of Balfron Road, Greenock, wept in court when he
saw a video of himself carrying out a knife attack. He pled guilty to
slashing his victim four times in the face and was jailed for six years.
On Thursday, Gentle, 58, who was serving a recommended sentence of 20
years, eluded a prison officer while on leave in Glasgow.
Gentle was jailed for life in 1982 for the murder of Ian Waddell, who
had confessed to a journalist that he killed Rachel Ross, the murder for
which Paddy Meehan was wrongly convicted. Gentle had stabbed a woman to
death when he was with Waddell, and later strangled his accomplice. He
had previously been found guilty of culpable homicide 13 years earlier.
Police searches are under way for both men. The circumstances
surrounding their escapes are under investigation.

GLASGOW is to make a bid for a residency by the Royal Shakespeare
Company, following artistic director Adrian Noble's announcement that it
is to curtail its London activities to set up two new residencies away
from its Stratford base.
The head of marketing at the city's Theatre Royal, Ms Roberta Doyle,
confirmed yesterday that there would be a co-operative approach to the
RSC by the theatre, which is owned by Scottish Opera and the district
council's department of performing arts and venues.
The RSC has had an annual five-week residency in three theatres in
Newcastle on Tyne since 1977, and Mr Noble said yesterday that that was
to be the model for the new residencies in two other cities.
Ms Doyle said: ''It is early days but I think we could put together
the sort of package that suits the company in Newcastle and which has
proved to be a huge success.''
The Theatre Royal and the council-owned Tramway, with its different
sized performance spaces, would give the RSC the kind of flexibility it
enjoys in Newcastle and at home in Stratford with The Shakespeare
Memorial Theatre, The Swan, and The Other Place.
Mr Noble wants ''to liberate productions from our base theatres; to be
seen more widely throughout the United Kingdom''. The move will cut the
company's presence at its London home at the Barbican to a winter
season.
He said: ''We wish this extension to the geographical spread of our
work to include both more regular touring to larger theatres, and more
residencies on the pattern of the annual five-week residency in three
theatre in Newcastle on Tyne.''
Mr Bob Palmer, Glasgow's director of performing arts, said: ''Glasgow
has the range of venues and the flexibility of spaces to make it an
ideal place for an RSC residency. As a city, Glasgow would be very keen
to receive the RSC.''
Ms Doyle said she and Mr Palmer would be meeting in the coming week.
The RSC last visited the Theatre Royal last year with Sir Derek
Jacobi's Macbeth. Since then the company has visited Barrhead Sports
Centre with Katie Mitchell's production of Henry VI Part 3 and
Edinburgh's Festival Theatre with Love's Labour's Lost, starring Jenny
Agutter.
The Festival Theatre's general manager, Mr Paul Iles, said he believed
it unlikely that the RSC would seek to establish a season in either
Glasgow or Edinburgh.
Both had a healthy theatre scene but it was more probable that the RSC
would go to Wales, just as it had gone to Newcastle because it was more
on the touring circuit.
The Royal Shakespeare Company said yesterday that the company had been
inundated with invitations from theatres throughout the country.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson last night condemned
''English nationalism'' in the Conservative Party.
The attack came during a debate with SNP deputy leader Allan Macartney
at Glasgow University where they took the opportunity to put their cases
for devolution and independence respectively.
Mr Robertson spoke of the crucial difference between patriotism which
enriched societies and nationalism and separatism which led so often to
trouble.
''Since we find it less easy to look closely at ourselves, take a
salutary lesson from the crude and unpalatable English nationalism
coming alive in the Conservative Party today.
''It is xenophobic, nostalgic, unreal, and impossiblist. It hankers
back to a past when national sovereignty meant something and where
Britain's own economic might was even greater than Germany's today.''
He and Dr Macartney, Euro-MP for North East Scotland, were debating
whether a national identity needed a nation state. Mr Robertson said the
answer had to be an emphatic no.
''If national identity did require nation-statehood, then the United
Nations' present membership of 148 would rise to anywhere between 2000
and 6000. Does anyone seriously imagine that to be the answer to any of
the problems facing the world today?''
While the constitutional status quo was unacceptable for Scotland, so
was the disintegration of the Union.
A devolved Scottish parliament would mean a modernised, democratised
reworking of the relationship between the various parts of the country:
''It is a radical plan but one built on commonsense too, which will
revolutionise the government of Britain.''
Dr Macartney said the case for independence for a nation was not based
solely on the need or desire to preserve national identity, although a
national identity was a necessary condition for putting forward the case
for an independent nation state.
''The existence of a nation state enhances and indeed virtually
guarantees the national identity of the nation concerned . . . Without
the safeguard of nation-statehood, the identity of a nation within a
multi-national state is inevitably vulnerable.''
In the aftermath of the First World War, and then of the Second, there
had been a steady increase in the number of independent states. That
international revolution had accelerated over the past decade.
''So strong is the presumption in favour of nation states, not least
in the Europe in which we live, that the onus is firmly on those who
stand opposed to such developments to justify that opposition, not least
to the citizens of the nation or nations concerned.''
Independence within the EU would give Scotland the external
recognition to guarantee a national identity about which Scots could be
totally relaxed, not to mention allowing a distinctive Scottish outlook
on world affairs to be expressed in the chambers of power.

Hong Kong, Friday
HONG KONG'S last colonial governor staunchly defended his
controversial administration after China and Britain finally agreed on a
court of last resort for the territory.
Chris Patten, whose term as governor has been marked by seemingly
endless squabbles with Beijing over everything from the territory's new
airport to more democracy, was clearly relieved that the court battle,
at least, was over.
He rejected charges by his critics that Britain had sold out its
principles by agreeing to Beijing's demand that the Court of Final
Appeal should be set up only on July 1, 1997, the day China takes over
the British colony.
''We would have very much liked to have set up the court not just now,
but two or three years ago,'' he said.
''The choice that we had was whether to go ahead with an agreement
with the Chinese that would stick, or whether to do nothing at all, or
chance setting up a court which would be dismantled by the Chinese.''
He said the deal was good for Hong Kong and would give confidence to
local and foreign businessmen. ''What we've actually got is a very fair
and sensible deal,'' he said.
In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said: ''This agreement is
good news for Hong Kong.''
The colony's court of last resort is currently the Privy Council in
London. After the handover to China, however, no colonial legacies will
survive, and the final court will be the one outlined in today's pact.
Mr Patten, vilified by China for trying to make Hong Kong's political
process more representative, defended his sometimes confrontational
stance.
''I've always believed my main task was to stand up for the Joint
Declaration, the treaty between Britain and China which guarantees Hong
Kong's wellbeing . . . prosperity and stability in the future,'' he
said.
The veteran Tory politician added: ''It is not, in my experience,
sensible to take the view that the best way of standing up for what you
believe is by lying down.''
But Mr Patten, who has vowed to stay in Hong Kong until the last day
of British sovereignty, did express regret that he had had such frosty
relations with the territory's future masters. -- Reuter.

LABOUR'S plans for devolution are driven by fear of the Scottish
Nationalists and political self-interest, the Prime Minister said
yesterday as he launched his latest attempt to stem Labour's growing
popularity.
With Mr Tony Blair scoring the highest poll rating yet for a Leader of
the Opposition, Mr Major chose the Welsh Tory conference as his platform
for a party relaunch, promising a new agenda based on five themes of
enterprise, opportunity, law and order, public services, and a sovereign
nation.
Backed by poll evidence suggesting continuing doubts among voters over
Labour's plans, Mr Major concentrated his speech on the constitution and
his belief that they threaten the future of the Union.
Speaking in Llangollen, he said the Union was the product of
generations, formed on the understanding that ''united we are stronger,
divided we are weaker''.
He attacked Labour for a policy which he said would pit one part of
the United Kingdom against the other, and accused the Opposition of
being selective by offering a Parliament to Scotland, but not Wales.
Fear of the SNP was to blame, he said. ''Labour want a Scottish
Parliament in Edinburgh for their own party political reasons. They are
afraid of the Scottish Nationalists.''
A Scottish Parliament would mean fewer Scottish MPs at Westminster, he
claimed. A Welsh assembly and regional assemblies for England were
Labour's way of avoiding having to reduce its representation at
Westminster.
''Why should Scottish MPs be allowed to vote at Westminster on matters
affecting England and Wales, when English and Welsh MPs would not be
allowed to vote on the same matters affecting Scotland.
''What is the justification for the tartan tax -- forcing Scottish
people to pay more than the English and Welsh just because they live
north of the border? No answer,'' he said.
He sought to capitalise on the enmity between Labour and the SNP by
conceding that, although he disagreed with the principle, demands for
outright independence were more logical than Labour's.
''The Nationalists at least have logic on their side. They are
profoundly wrong but at least their arguments are logical. As for
Labour, they have abandoned even the pretence of rationality in their
schemes. The Mad Hatter could have dreamed them up.''
Scottish Nationalists mocked Mr Major's call, claiming the Tories were
now on ''the margins of political life''.
SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond said: ''While John Major continues to dig a
ditch for himself by resisting any form of constitutional change, the
Scottish National Party are planning the future from a position of
strength.''
Mr Major's case was strengthened by the publication yesterday of a
poll carried out by the free-market Adam Smith Institute. It found that
more than half of voters in Scotland, England, and Wales believed
Labour's plans would threaten the unity of the UK.
The Gallup poll of 1075 voters, suggests that 56% of voters think
Labour's proposals would weaken the unity of the UK, 21% think it would
strengthen it, and 15% were undecided.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang last night cited the Gallup findings as
evidence that people were ''increasingly recognising'' the dangers of
Labour's constitutional plans.
Mr Major's speech in Wales followed the publication yesterday of an
opinion poll which showed Labour's lead over the Conservatives to have
risen to almost 40 percentage points. The poll, by Gallup for the Daily
Telegraph, puts Labour on 59.5%, the Tories on 20%, and the Liberal
Democrats on 14.5%. It also puts Mr Blair's approval rating at 68%, the
highest yet achieved by an opposition leader.

Aviano, Friday
US fighter pilot Scott O'Grady cried and thanked God today as he made
a hero's return to his base in Italy.
He had nothing but praise for the Marines who swooped into dangerous
Bosnian Serb-held territory to snatch him to safety.
''If you want to find some heroes that's where you should look because
those are the best in the world,'' 29-year-old O'Grady told 1000
cheering, flag-waving airmen and their families who welcomed him back to
Aviano air base.
With growing emotion he added: ''They say they were just doing their
jobs, but they came in there, they risked their lives.''
O'Grady appeared fit and relaxed despite six days evading capture in
northern Bosnia after his F-16 fighter was shot down by a Bosnian Serb
surface-to-air missile last Friday.
He lived on insects, rainwater, and his survival skills until a
helicopter-borne snatch force of 40 Marines went in under fire at dawn
yesterday and rescued him from his forest hideout.
''If it wasn't for God's love for me and my love for God I would never
have gotten through it. He's the one who delivered me here and I know
that in my heart,'' O'Grady said.
Meanwhile the commander of Nato air forces in southern Europe said he
believed O'Grady flew into a deliberate Bosnian Serb trap when he was
shot down.
American Lt-General Michael Ryan said the Bosnian Serbs had been
targeting Nato aircraft ''in a very major way'' since last November.

THE Herald is to become the first regional daily newspaper available
on the Internet with a regularly updated publication.
The service will be launched on World Wide Web, a global computer
network, and will allow millions of potential readers to access the
paper using a computer connected to a telephone.
Yesterday Mr Liam Kane, chief executive of Caledonian Publishing,
which produces The Herald and its sister paper the Evening Times, said
the on-line information business was set to explode and the company
intended to be the market leader in Scotland. He added that a new
subsidiary, Caledonian Information and Media Services, had been set up.
He said CIMS would also be offering electronic publishing services to
commercial customers -- including Scottish Enterprise -- whose quarterly
software magazine will be put on the World Wide Web at the same time as
The Herald.
Caledonian's development director, Mr Ray Perman added: ''The Internet
offers businesses in Scotland the potential to reach millions of
customers around the globe, at very low cost. With our technical and
publishing skills, we can open the world to them.''

Washington, Friday
THE US House of Representatives yesterday voted to lift the arms
embargo in Bosnia.
The 318 to 99 vote, which had strong Democratic as well as Republican
majority support, amounted to a declaration of no confidence in the
president's handling of the Bosnian crisis.
The same proposition will probably pass the Senate with a similar
majority.
The White House today denounced the proposal, arguing that a
unilateral lifting of the ban would violate American commitments to the
United Nations and to its allies, meaning those nations, starting with
Britain and France which have troops on the ground in Bosnia.
The action would lead to an immediate withdrawal of UN peacekeepers
and a sharp escalation of the fighting and thousands of civilian deaths.
Furthermore, the United States would become more deeply involved, as
it would have to supply arms to the Bosnians and guarantee their
delivery, and probably greatly increase its air patrols to protect the
deliveries. The leading Democratic foreign affairs specialist in the
House, Lee Hamilton, said that the move would probably cost the US $1bn
and lead to the involvement of 24,000 American troops in the hottest war
in the world today.
None of these arguments impressed the House, which was more influenced
by the deliberate shooting down of an American plane a week ago, the
taking of UN hostages, and the continued shelling of safe-areas.
The vote was part of a foreign aid Bill that President Clinton has
promised to veto. The Bill cuts foreign aid substantially (but not to
Israel or Egypt), and reorganises the foreign policy system.
The bill also rules on a whole list of specific foreign issues. They
were passed with much narrower margins, not nearly enough to provide the
two-thirds needed to over-ride the president's veto. It is always
possible, however, that Congress may pass a separate Bill, with a
veto-proof majority, to lift the arms embargo.
The Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzik, went to the White House
this morning hoping to see the president, but had to be satisfied with
Vice-President Al Gore.
He came away disappointed, saying that there had been no change in US
policy and that the arms embargo was ''an instrument of genocide and a
failure''.

<TEXT>
TWO amateur metal detectors, who stole a ''unique'' treasure of
ancient artefacts, received suspended sentences yesterday.
James Garriock, 43, and Terrence Rossiter, 47, both from Salisbury,
Wiltshire, nodded their thanks to the judge, who said ''exceptional
circumstances'' enabled him to suspend their nine-month prison sentences
for a year.
The men unearthed more than 500 bronze and iron-age artefacts in a
field near Salisbury 10 years ago without the landowner's knowledge.
They then made more than #5000 each selling most of the six-figure
value haul of tools, weapons, ornaments, and jewellery -- some 4000
years old -- to a dealer.
Some of those items were later bought by former Conservative Party
Treasurer Lord McAlpine, who had no idea of their real origin.
Passing sentence at Knightsbridge Crown Court, Judge Christopher
Hordern QC said: ''Both of you appreciated that you should have reported
what you had found . . .
''It seems to me you had enough knowledge to appreciate that you had
come across something that was of very considerable archaeological
importance.''
There was no doubt their dishonesty was so serious that prison
sentences had to be passed but, in view of the ''quite exceptional
circumstances'' they could be suspended.
Not only had a long time elapsed since they discovered the ''Salisbury
Hoard'' but he could understand ''the excitement and the degree of
temptation which was placed before you''.
Although they had decided to plead guilty only halfway through their
trial last month, their change of heart was prompted solely because it
was not until then that they had understood the law regarding their
actions and what they had done was illegal.
0 Both Mr Nigel Mitchell, for Garriock, and Mr Stewart Patterson, for
Rossiter, told the court both men had been in financial difficulties and
believed they were not doing anything wrong.
Meanwhile, Lord McAlpine raised the possibility of reimbursing the
British Museum for the artefacts he had acquired and sold to them.
The #55,000 they had paid him had been split with the dealer he had
bought them from in ''good faith''.
However, if the ownership of the artefacts was successfully challenged
and it appeared the museum would lose out, he believed his reaction
would be to return his share of the proceeds and suggest the dealer do
the same.

Paris, Friday
HOODED youths rampaged through the poor Paris suburb of Noisy-le-Grand
early today, smashing cars and throwing Molotov cocktails that set fire
to five school buildings.
It was the second night of violence in the area where, 24 hours
earlier, dozens of young people wrecked cars and vandalised a train
station in a protest over the death of an Arab youth on a stolen
motorcycle.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe said his government would not tolerate
lawlessness and pledged to maintain order.
Local youths accused the police of running down 21-year-old Belkacem
Delahbib with their car after a chase on Wednesday, but police said he
crashed the stolen bike into a traffic light.
Only 15 to 20 hooded thugs were involved in the latest rampage.
Officials said they appeared to be a well-organised commando-style
group.
Juppe said: ''All inquiries must be made to assure that there was no
error on the part of the administrative services, but we must also state
firmly that we will tolerate no drift toward violence or a challenge to
public order.''
Among the damaged buildings were a nursery school, three primary
schools, a secondary school, a gymnasium, a city hall annexe, and
workshops.
Numerous vehicles, including a tourist coach, were smashed or set
ablaze and several shopfronts shattered.
Police questioned six youths but they were released later.
Violence is not uncommon in certain Paris suburbs hit by poverty, high
unemployment, drug abuse, crumbling housing, and racial
tension.--Reuter.

A SCOTS father trapped in Mongolia with his three children after a
court decision to reopen an investigation hopes to settle out of court
and finally leave the country after six months.
Mr David Grant, from Orkney, had been found guilty of deliberate
wounding. He was given a three-year sentence, reduced to two years and
suspended, after an incident last October.
Then an appeal court in the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator last month
overturned the earlier ruling but ordered that the case be
reinvestigated.
Yesterday it emerged that Mr Grant has offered the Mongolian man he
was accused of injuring $700 in a bid to resolve the matter and leave
the country. Until the case is settled Mr Grant cannot obtain an exit
visa.
The former broch keeper left Scotland four years ago to travel the
world in a horse-drawn carriage with his wife Kate and their three
children Torcuil, 15, Eilidh, 13 and Fionn, 10. Last November, as they
were travelling across Mongolia, he claims a group of drunken Mongolian
men attempted to steal one of their horses. Eildidh fired a catapult,
allegedly injuring one of the men.
Last week the man, known only as Mr Bolt, underwent a medical
examination where it was diagnosed that he had suffered a trauma injury.
He was told he would need an operation costing around $700.
Speaking from her father's home in Southampton after returning from
Mongolia several months ago, Mrs Grant said her husband just wanted to
leave. ''By offering to pay for the operation David is not accepting he
is guilty but he has already spent #5000 on legal fees and he and the
children are very despondent.''
The Foreign Office has already expressed its concern over the decision
to reinvestigate the case. Yesterday a spokesman said the move amounted
to a re-trial for the same crime. A fortnight ago the Mongolian
ambassador to Britain was summoned to the Foreign Office but the
spokesman added that there had been no response from the Mongolian
government.
Last night a Mongolian Embassy spokesman said the matter was something
which had to be dealt with by the Mongolian courts.

Los Angeles, Friday
THE judge in the O J Simpson double murder trial had to warn jurors
not to be swayed by their emotions as a coroner continued his lurid
description of fatal injuries suffered by the football great's alleged
victims.
Judge Lance Ito's admonition followed his abrupt halt to the
proceedings yesterday when victim Ronald Goldman's family broke down in
tears and several jurors were too upset to continue looking at gruesome
pictures of Goldman and Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson.
''You must not be influenced by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy,
passion, prejudice, public opinion, or public feeling,'' said Ito.
Coroner Dr Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran described two ''gaping'' slash
wounds in Goldman's neck, and said he had suffered 15 stab wounds in
less than a minute.
He demonstrated how he believed the attacker had killed Goldman -- by
holding him from behind and drawing the knife across his neck.
The jury appeared to have regained its composure today but Goldman's
father, stepmother, and sister, sitting in the front row of the
spectator gallery, sobbed openly.
Simpson, who had looked distressed as the coroner earlier described
how his ex-wife met her death in similar fashion, remained calm.
Defence lawyer Johnnie Cochran asked Ito to close the court on Monday,
the first anniversary of the murders which Simpson denies. The judge
turned down the request.--Reuter.

Los Angeles, Friday
LISA Marie Presley today denied press reports that she and her husband
Michael Jackson were expecting a baby.
The claims were Presley's pregnancy ''totally false'', said a member
of Presley's entourage.
Showbiz sources said the couple, who married a year ago in a blaze of
publicity, have been trying for a baby for some months.
Reports said they were expected to announce the results of her
pregnancy test in an American television interview on Wednesday.
A source close to Jackson was quoted as saying: ''Michael knows this
appearance has to be as riveting as possible. There will be 500 million
people tuning in all over the world and every one of them is a potential
album buyer.''
Jackson is currently promoting his soon-to-be-released HIStory album.
It was reported that Jackson believed having a child would be the best
way to rid himself of child sex abuse allegations, which have lingered
even though he has never been charged.
Another source said that if Presley did not get pregnant they would
adopt a child.--Reuter.

Moscow, Friday
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin said today he would not reveal until
the last minute whether or not he will stand for re-election in the 1996
presidential poll.
He said that to decide too soon could disrupt the country.
The 64-year-old Kremlin leader said: ''Imagine for a minute that I
announced today my intention to participate in the presidential
elections. Straight away all my decisions, actions, remarks would be
seen as virtually the start of an electoral campaign.
''At the same time, declaring I will not stand would upset the work of
the presidential staff, government, and many state organs.''
He pledged to stick to the timetable of holding parliamentary
elections in December and the presidential ballot in June next year.
''I, as head of state, have to ensure they are held on time. There is no
other way,'' he said.
In an interview, Yeltsin also made a new effort to help a centre-right
group become Russia's dominant political force. He said he was sure
voters would warm to the idea.
He dwelt on what he said were tendencies to turn the clock back and
''to isolate Russia from the rest of the world'' -- a swipe at his
communist and nationalist opponents.
He pointed voters in the direction of a new centre-right bloc called
''Our House is Russia'' and led by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
Yeltsin himself, however, is deeply unpopular in the country. The war
in Chechnya is raging and living standards have fallen dramatically for
millions of Russians despite the transition to democracy.--Reuter.

THE Prime Minister gave the green light yesterday for the biggest
deployment of British forces since the Gulf War.
Mr Major said final Cabinet approval had been granted to send the
5500-strong 24 Airmobile Brigade to Bosnia as soon as UN agreement was
reached.
Last night UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended that
the Security Council back an increase of 12,500 in the authorised UN
troop strength in the former Yugoslavia from 44,870 to 57,370. The
Council is expected to back the move next week.
The British troops will form part of the 10,000-strong rapid reaction
protection force designed to beef up the lightly armed peacekeeping
force.
Mr Major said the force, consisting of two brigades, would help
protect existing UN forces in Bosnia, but he stressed it was not going
to fight a war.
The men would provide additional protection for UN forces -- and would
defend themselves and respond ''more robustly'' if they came under
attack, he said.
The airmobile brigade will be able to move rapidly around Bosnia with
1400 infantry troops, 48 Lynx anti-tank and battlefield support
helicopters, 24 Gazelle reconnaissance helicopters, and up to 36
Chinooks and Pumas.
The second brigade will be made up of the British armoured reserve
known as Task Force Alpha, 1900 French troops, and Canadian and Dutch
contributions.
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez last night said Spain would join the
new force, the fourth European nation to offer troops after Britain,
France, and the Netherlands.
It will be a formidable force with Warrior armoured fighting vehicles,
105mm artillery guns, Scimitar light tanks, and anti-tank helicopters.
Mr Major, speaking in Wales, stressed his commitment to the continuing
UN operation.
''The British troops who are in Bosnia today are upholding a vital
national interest -- the preservation of the stability of Europe,'' he
said.
The Prime Minister issued a stark demand for the Bosnian Serbs to
release unconditionally the remaining Royal Welch Fusiliers still held
hostage.
''The leaders of the Bosnian Serbs know that they will be held
personally responsible if they let any harm befall our men,'' he said.
Since June 2 the Bosnian Serbs have freed 232 UN peacekeepers rounded
up in retaliation for Nato air strikes. The 145 remaining hostages
include six Britons.
Mr Major went out of his way to praise the work of the Fusiliers, who
he visited in Bugojno in central Bosnia last year.
''Just a few months ago people there were killing each other in their
thousands. Today, thanks to British and other UN soldiers, across a
large area fields are being planted and children playing safely,'' he
said.
''Life in Gorazde for the Royal Welch Fusiliers is arduous,
uncomfortable, and at times dangerous. But they have done a superb job
and I believe we should be proud of them.''
In Paris, EU leaders last night approved former Swedish Prime Minister
Carl Bildt as its peace negotiator, replacing Lord Owen.
Mr Bildt, leader of Sweden's conservative opposition, is expected to
be granted greater powers than Lord Owen. His mandate will be to
negotiate a diplomatic settlement of the crisis on behalf of the
five-power Contact Group of Britain, France, Germany, the US, and
Russia.
Lord Owen ended three years in the thankless task with a plea to the
US to compromise on Bosnia for the sake of peace.
''We have not had enough negotiations in the last year. I hope that
(vacuum) will now be filled,'' Lord Owen told reporters.
''But that means the Americans must be ready to negotiate and to
compromise and to take some part of the decisions.''

Assistant procurator-fiscal, Mr Michael Bell, said yesterday: ''I can

respect of Professor Donald Macleod.
''That report is being carefully considered with a view to a fairly
early decision on its contents.''
It is understood the allegations relate to three women. Claims about
Professor Macleod's personal life attracted widespread attention at the
Free Church General Assembly last month.
The Assembly decided there were insufficient grounds to proceed with
charges of censurable conduct in the church court and said the matter

ELEVEN schoolchildren yesterday took a short stroll into history by
becoming the first islanders on Skye to walk to the mainland.
Led by two teachers, they walked across the new Skye road bridge now
nearing completion -- the first people other than construction workers
to do so.
Their saunter into the history books took about half an hour each way.
In the middle, where there is still a 13ft gap between the ends of the
roadway, they descended to a connecting catwalk used by workmen.
Wearing hard hats, and escorted across the safety-railed catwalk by
construction staff, they crossed the gap and carried on to the end of
the bridge, and mainland Scotland, then back again.
''I have to say it was a really breathtaking experience,'' said
Portreee High School teacher Sheena Meek, who took the 12 to
16-year-olds across with colleague Gillian Willet.
''It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining, and the view was
breathtaking. There was a sense of history in the making.''
The #30m bridge is due to open in the autumn, and school parties have
been visiting it in recent days as part of their studies.
The bridge is being built by Miller Civil Engineering and a Germany
company, Dyckerhoff and Widman.
The overall length of the bridge is 570 metres, and its 250-metre main
span is claimed to be the longest of its type in the northern
hemisphere.
The present short ferry crossing from Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland
to Kyleakin on the island side costs #5.40 for a motorist, and some
islanders are annoyed that bridge tolls will not be much below this.
It has been built mostly with private money, with the construction
firms expecting to recoup their outlay from future toll charges

TWO divers were missing, feared drowned, last night in the second
underwater tragedy to hit the west coast of Scotland in less than six
weeks.
The men were with a party on a boat chartered out of Tobermory, Mull,
when they failed to surface off Bo Faskadale rock about six miles out
from Ardnamurchan.
The charter boat, Sheerwater, called for help just before 3pm and a
search was launched by Tobermory lifeboat and a Navy helicopter from HMS
Gannet at Prestwick. They were also joined in the search by two pleasure
boats.
It is understood the missing divers, who have not been named but are
believed to be from north London, told friends they wanted to reach 70
metres using just compressed air.
As darkness fell last night, experts from the Naval deep-dive vessel,
Instow, went into the water to inch their way down a thin marker-line
left floating on the surface by the pair.
The operation is delicate because pressure put on the string from
above could snap it.
Coastguard chief, Mr Tony Arden, said last night: ''Our information is
that the two men at Ardnamurchan were out to better their records which
is known as 'bounce diving'.
''It is something no diver should do, no matter how experienced. This
area is hugely attractive to divers at every level of experience and I
would plead with them again to follow the rules and not take risks.
''Nobody should try to go deeper than 30 metres with air only. The
narks are almost inevitable at that sort of depth unless a mixture is
used.''
The narks are a form of nitrogen narcosis which causes bubbles in the
bloodstream to affect the brain.
Mr Arden said: ''It is like being very drunk underwater. You lose
control of what you are doing.''
He added: ''There is little or no hope of recovering the divers alive.
Given the time they have been missing, we are searching for bodies.''
The charter boat was returning to Tobermory where police were waiting
to take statements.
The incident comes six weeks after two amateur divers died while
exploring the hull of a Second World War ammunition supply ship, 60ft
below the surface in Ardmucknish Bay, north of Oban.
The bodies of Mr David Waterhouse, 29, of Deeside, Clwyd, and Mr David
Weaver, 26, of Nercwys, Mold, both North Wales, have not been recovered,
despite extensive searches by police, naval, and civilian underwater
teams.
At the time, Mr Arden warned divers that debris on the vessel, SS
Breda, had made it dangerous to all but the most careful.

RELATIVES of the 25 police and intelligence officers killed in last
year's Mull of Kintyre helicopter crash are to step up their fight for
increased compensation from the Government.
The Ministry of Defence is believed to be planning to limit payment to
#100,000 -- the equivalent amount paid to dependents of passengers in a
civilian airline tragedy.
The proposal has infuriated the women whose husbands had been in the
frontline of the secret anti-terrorist war in Britain and Northern
Ireland.
Many were close to tears in Belfast yesterday when they demanded a
meeting with Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.
Dr Susan Phoenix, whose RUC Special Branch husband, Ian, was killed,
said: ''The Government is dishonest and they are dishonouring our men.
They obviously value them for nothing.
''Obviously, they thought they were dealing with little ladies here in
Northern Ireland who wouldn't kick up a fuss. Well, they didn't know our
husbands and they don't know us.''
The crash of the RAF Chinook wiped out the top tier of Ulster's
anti-terrorist organisations. The dead included 10 senior RUC officers,
15 MI5 and military intelligence operatives, and four RAF crewmen.
The 24 men and one woman were on their way from RAF Aldergrove, near
Belfast, to a secret conference at Fort George, Inverness, when the
aircraft ploughed into an Argyllshire hillside, killing everyone.
MI5 chief, Mrs Stella Rimington, RUC Chief Constable, Sir Hugh
Annesley, and Sir Roger Wheeler, the commander of British troops in
Northern Ireland, are now to be asked to intervene on behalf of the
bereaved families.
Several of the widows, who attended a special memorial service on the
crash site just a week ago, spoke of their bitterness over the MoD's
handling of the compensation claims.
The claims were apparently going to be announced next Thursday at the
same time as the air accident report.
Mrs Ruth Pugh, whose husband, Roy, a major, died, said she had raised
her concerns with the Prime Minister when he attended a memorial service
in Belfast last year.
''At that time I was beginning to feel nervous,'' she said. ''The fact
that the MoD hadn't reassured us that our interests would be looked at.
After all, we have young families and we have their future to
consider.''
Mr Richard Barbour, a solicitor acting on behalf of a number of
families, said last night: ''All of the officers who died had been
living under the threat of terrorist retribution. Their wives and
children faced the same threat.
''Now it would appear that, because the threat has been removed, so
has the financial support they would have received had their husbands
lived to enjoy the same peace in which we now live. The Government owes
these men a great debt.''
Because of their senior rank, relatives could normally have expected
compensation in line with high earning levels.
However, under the Warsaw Convention, damages paid in respect of an
air crash may be limited to a fixed sum. Current civilian airline rates
are #100,000 per victim.
An MoD spokesman said last night: ''It would be wrong to comment
further until we have had an opportunity to inform the next of kin of
the accident victims and their legal advisers. This will be done in the
near future.''
However, Mrs Ann Magee, whose husband, Ken, was an RUC inspector, said
she was shocked and distressed, not by the compensation, but the manner
in which the accident report had been delayed for weeks until after the
first anniversary of the crash.
''It's hard to believe people could be treated like this,'' she said.
Mrs Jill Davidson, whose husband, Philip, an RUC superintendent, died,
agreed: ''There has been no thought for these men or the work they did
to achieve peace.
''All that seems to have been forgotten and we've had a very difficult
year and we were just getting along when suddenly this has been thrown
up. I just feel to treat us in this way they don't seem to care much.''
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell backed the
relatives' plea.
In a letter to Mr Rifkind, he said those who died had given
''outstanding service in the interests of the nation'' in an area where
their lives were in constant danger.
Mrs Janice Williams, widow of Lt Col George Williams, gave birth to
their second child Hannah eight months ago. She said last night: ''It's
not the money. It's recognition of the fact that I feel my whole family
life has been sacrificed in order for him to do that job. I feel very
hurt now and that does not appear to have been recognised in any way.
It's this terrible hurt and feeling of betrayal.''

A TODDLER who has spent most of the first two years of her life in a
sterile room is preparing finally to leave hospital and go home.
Two-year-old Zara Albright has lived in an isolated room at Newcastle
General Hospital since she was six months old, suffering from a rare
disease which left her body with no natural defences against illness.
Severe combined immuno-deficiency syndrome (SCIDS) kills half its
victims. However, Zara has been cured by chemotherapy and a bone marrow
transplant from her father Simon and is now set to return to her home in
Birmingham on Monday.
Her mother Shabina said last night: ''I can't believe we are going
home. It is a day I have never dared dream about -- there have been so
many setbacks.
''I can't wait to have her home to do all the normal things,
especially to have her in my own bed and make her first meal at home.''
Shabina and Simon, a self-employed optician, first realised something
was terribly wrong with Zara when she began rapidly losing weight at the
age of three months.
As soon as the condition was diagnosed, the family was flown to to
Newcastle General Hospital, which is one of only two units in Britain
specialising in the treatment of the condition.
From that day in May 1993, Zara's only trips out of her sealed-off
room were to be rushed down specially sterilised corridors to a waiting
ambulance, which would carry her to the city's Royal Vctoria Infirmary
for five major operations.
The toddler's treatment, described by Mr Albright as ''brutal'',
involved chemotherapy to kill off her existing bone marrow, making room
for marrow donated by her father in the hope that it would help build
her immune system.
Tests have shown that Zara has developed some lymph nodes -- the first
signs that her immune system was finally starting to develop.
Her progress became so rapid that, in the space of two weeks, the
medical team decided that their longest surviving SCIDS patient could be
allowed to go home.
Her father, who cried tears of joy with his wife when they were given
the news that Zara could at last go home, said: ''I will only believe
she is coming home when I have her seated, strapped in the car and I am
in first gear.''

EVEREST heroine Alison Hargreaves said goodbye to her two children
yesterday and headed for the Himalayas again.
Tomorrow, the mountaineer flies to Pakistan to prepare for her climb
of K2, the world's second higest peak, only weeks after she became the
first woman to conquer Everest alone and without oxygen back-up.
Ms Hargreaves, 33, yesterday bade farewell to youngsters Tom, six, and
Kate, four, at the family home in Spean Bridge, near Fort William.
Ms Hargreaves knows that the 28,252ft ice and limestone ''cone' in
Pakistan's Karakorum Range in the Western Himalayas poses a more
formidable challenge than Everest.
The adventurer, who is rated as one of the most proficient female
climbers of all times, said: ''I made my name in my sport as a technical
climber so, in that respect, I am confident of my ability to scale the
mountain'.
However, she added: ''I am just praying for the weather to be all
right as I prepare for my actual bid for the summit. I had luck with me
on Everest but the law of averages says that I should not get such a
good break on K2.''
K2 is regularly swept by fierce storms but Britain's only professional
female mountaineer said: ''I am going there at the very best time of the
year according to the weather forecasters but that is no guarantee of
success.''
Ms Hargreaves is well aware of K2's reputation for tragedy.
Ms Julie Tullis, the only British woman ever to stand on its summit,
did not survive the descent in a 1986 expedition which also cost the
life of her companion Al Rouse.
Storms, driven by gales in temperatures down to minus 30 degrees, cuts
visibility to zero and can pin climbers down for days.
This can be fatal in the thin air of the ''death-zone' above 26,000ft.
Ms Hargreaves is planning an ascent without oxygen cylinders, although
on K2 she will have companions as she is linking up with an American
attempt.
She said yesterday: ''I am fully aware of the risks. I believe it is
the weather, rather than my climbing abilities, that will hold the key
as to whether I succeed.''
In the meantime, she is keeping her fingers crossed that the heavy
climbing equipment that she arranged to have flown from Kathmandu,
Nepal, to Pakistan has arrived and that ''everything is organised and
ready for me when I get there''.
Ms Hargreaves often takes the children with her on expeditions, as she
did when she became the first person to scale all six classic Alpine
north faces in 1993 and last year, when she got to within 1500ft of
Mount Everest's summit from the Nepal side.
However, she said yesterday: ''It is simply not practical to take the
youngsters to base camp on K2. The kids are used to me being away
climbing.''
Ms Hargreaves' husband, mountain photographer Jim Ballard, 48, will be
looking after Tom and Kate while his wife faces the formidable K2
challenge.
He said yesterday: ''We have our rituals which have served us well
over the years. One of the most important involves no tearful farewells
between us when Alison sets out on her latest challenge.''
Ms Hargreaves made history on Everest on May 13 and since her return
home she has been in training in the Highlands.

<HEADLINE>ScotRail to freeze sleeper bookings</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977961219</RECORDNO>

SCOTRAIL has disclosed that no bookings will be taken for the Fort
William sleeper beyond the end of the month.
This is despite two court rulings that the service should continue
until after full public consultation on its proposed closure.
Reservations staff were told yesterday that they would have to record
the details of any prospective passengers with a view to contacting them
if the service continued beyond June 30.
ScotRail's director, Mr John Ellis, speaking yesterday in Gourock,
said he could not give an undertaking that the sleeper service would
operate throughout the summer.
When the convener of Highland Regional Council, Mr Duncan McPherson,
learned of this development from The Herald yesterday, he said the
council would not hesitate to return to court.
The authority had been successful in winning the two court victories
reprieving the service.
Describing ScotRail's decision to offer only a limited service as
''quite outrageous'', Mr McPherson said: ''It was crystal clear to
everybody that their Lordships had ruled that the status quo had to
prevail until the full consultation process had been completed.
Operating a week-by-week booking service and then taking people's names
and addresses is not the status quo.
''We will be discussing this with our legal advisers at the earliest
opportunity and we could easily go back to court in the near future. I
find Mr Ellis's comments all the stranger given that they come at the
same time as Ian Lang (Scottish Secretary) is widely reported as being
in favour of keeping the service, because of its importance to the
economically vital Highland tourist industry.
''He is said to be lobbying away behind the scenes in favour of the
service but, at the same time, ScotRail is doing this.''
Mr Ellis, speaking at a quarterly meeting of the Rail Users'
Consultative Committee for Scotland -- the watchdog body for rail users
north of the Border -- said the BR board and ScotRail may decide next
week on what further action to take in light of the ''surprise'' Court
of Session decision.
He said he was aware of the concerns of the RUCC on the
''unsatisfactory nature'' of the week-by-week extension.
He said: ''I have this morning given instructions that we should open
up reservations until the end of this month. We will be looking during
the course of the next week at the longer term position.''
Asked what measures ScotRail had taken to accommodate patrons on the
service beyond June, he said: ''We will take the name and details of
their requirements and keep a record of that. If the service is
continued and the reservation system is open, then we will get back to
them and they can confirm their booking.''
Mr Ellis said he did not share the view that possible further legal
approaches would take several months.
He added: ''We shall look at all of the options that might be
available to us. If there is a decision that the Fort William sleeper
service should continue for a considerable period of time then it could
well be that we would look at ways of improving its income as well as
reducing the cost of the operation.''
He said it was ScotRail's intention to review the whole quality and
marketing arrangements for its sleeper services and to develop and
maximise the use made of them.
British Rail board members are still considering whether to appeal to
the House of Lords. Firstly Lord Kirkwood, and then this week a bench of
three appeal judges headed by Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Hope,
have upheld Highland Region's efforts to retain the service.
The Herald understands that ScotRail has been advised legally not to
take firm bookings beyond this month because of the possibility of an
early appeal hearing in the House of Lords.
However, some legal experts believe have predicted that should the BR
board decide to go down this track its appeal to the highest court in
the land may not be heard until after Christmas because of the summer
holidays and full case loads between October and December.
Highland region has already said it would fight any appeal.
Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish questioned whether Mr Ellis
and the BR board were listening to ''the voice of Scotland'' which he
claimed was reflected by the Court of Session decision.
''It would be simply disastrous if the BR board decided to appeal this
matter to the House of Lords instead of concentrating on developing our
rail network,'' he said.
''The way they are dealing with bookings is an absolute scandal. It
seems to me that they are treating the decision of the court and the
people of Scotland with utter contempt.''
Mr McLeish added: ''What we need is a clear statement that the Fort
William service will run at least until the end of the consultation
period.''

<HEADLINE>Souness's dyslexic son taken from school by wife, jury told</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977961220</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FORMER Rangers and Liverpool manager Graeme Souness's first wife
Danielle took their dyslexic son away from his specialist school without
notice and left for Majorca, leaving his teachers wondering where he had
gone, a High Court libel jury heard yesterday.
Angela Bareford, head of Knowle Hill School, Pirbright, Surrey, said
Mrs Souness had told her that eight-year-old Jordan was leaving at
Easter 1993.
''In fact, he was taken away in February. I had no notice from her,
although we had heard Jordan talking about leaving and he was very
concerned about it.
''He just went on Tuesday afternoon, taking his pencils out of his
desk, nothing else. We had no idea he had gone and it wasn't until a
teacher checked that we realised this must have happened. I couldn't
believe it.''
Souness was ''very worried and very upset'' when she told him what had
happened.
Mrs Bareford, giving evidence for Souness in his libel action over
allegations that he was mean to his wife and children and evicted them
from their home, said under cross-examination that she did not know at
the time Jordan left school that Mrs Souness had been given notice to
quit.
The jury has heard that the People, in a May 1993 front-page splash
headed ''You're a dirty rat Souness'', alleged he had ordered Danielle
and the children to leave the #1m Surrey farmhouse he had provided for
her after their separation and refused to pay school fees for Jordan and
his elder brother, Fraser.
It claimed that Danielle was living on handouts from her parents, and
that even before the ''eviction'' she had to grovel to Souness for cash
to feed and clothe the children.
Publishers Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd deny libel and say the story is
true.
Souness, 42, and his second wife, Karen, of Mere, Knutsford, Cheshire,
have been in court throughout the four days of the trial so far.
Danielle, 39, left court half way through the hearing yesterday.
Jordan's teacher at the school, Sheila Bamford, told Mr Justice
Morland and the jury that she received ''very little'' parental input
from Mrs Souness.
She told the court: ''I was his class teacher and I taught him every
day. There needs to be a partnership between home and school, but Jordan
wasn't getting that partnership.''
Jordan had said he was frightened of being taken back to Majorca by
his mother because he hated the school there.
Cross-examined by Mr George Carman QC, for the newspaper, Ms Bamford
said Jordan adored his father. There was nothing to suggest any attempt
had been made to turn him away from his father.
''He was always talking about him, always boasting about him to the
other children in the playground,'' she said.
Karen Souness was not called as a witness.
The hearing continues on Monday when Mr Carman will open the defence
case and call Danielle Souness to the witness box.

<TEXT>
A TEENAGER claimed yesterday that his mother tried to brainwash his
younger brother, dressed him up in girl's clothes, and encouraged him to
play with dolls, wear make-up, and carry handbags.
The boy said his mother ''turned my brother into a girl'' because she
had always wanted a daughter.
The 16-year-old told a custody hearing that the mother had been the
cause of constant rows and physical fights in the family home before she
left last year.
He told the hearing, at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, that he did not love
his mother, who was sitting three feet away from him as he gave
evidence.
Asked if he thought his mother loved him, he replied: ''If she does
love me, she does not have a very good way of showing it.''
The 45-year-old woman dabbed her eyes and refused to look at her son
during his testimony.
The custody case is over the teenager's nine-year-old brother, who
cannot be named for legal reasons.
The case was highlighted on BBC's Reporting Scotland programme last
month, when the boy was seen being dragged, kicking and screaming, from
his father's Aberdeen home by sheriff officers.
His mother currently looks after the boy after being granted interim
custody last month.
His brother, who has just left school, told the court his mother was
to blame for an unhappy home life.
He claimed the woman paid more attention to housework than she did to
the children, and often threw objects such as glasses at her husband.
''She used to call him a baldy bass, spat in his face, and really
treated him like a piece of dirt,'' the boy said.
He claimed she tried to brainwash his little brother against him and
his father.
He told his father's solicitor, Mr Richard Ward, that the woman bought
the little boy girl's toys such as shoes, handbags, and doll's heads.
''The only real friend he had was a little girl. He played with girls
and did girl's things because my mum turned him into a girl.
''Because she did not have a girl and was hoping for a girl, she could
not accept that she had got a boy so she turned my brother into a little
girl.
''He did not know that he was doing girlish things until they split
up. Since then, he has lots of friends calling for him and they are
mostly boys.''
The boy said that, even on sunny days, his brother would stay in the
house ''going about with handbags and making cakes''.
He claimed the boy's new childminder was more like a mother than his
real mother was.
He said he was in the house when sheriff officers arrived to take the
boy away to his mother's house.
''They tried to lift him from the sofa by the legs and he kicked them
away. I said: 'Why are you doing this to my little brother'.''
''He said he had been ordered to take him away. My brother started
screaming, it was a really traumatic experience.''
The hearing, before Sheriff Alexander Jessop, continues.

GREENOCK IN OLD PICTURE POSTCARDS
John Fyfe Anderson
European Library -- Zaltbommel/Netherlands
ANOTHER of those slim volumes of old postcards has just been
published. It will never get into the booksellers' charts, of course,
but it will be one more for the crowded nostalgia shelf, to be taken
down now and then to be mulled and argued over.
A quick glance through my quotation books produces only two on
nostalgia. One is the well-known example which arrived via some
anonymous graffiti: ''Nostalgia is not what it used to be.'' The other,
from Emile Augier, with which I have some sympathy, is: ''La Nostalgie
de la boue!!'' and, I am assured, translates: ''Longing to be back in
the mud!''
Well, these old postcards are about Greenock, my birthplace. But in
the main these are postcards from beyond the edge of my memory. I have
no recollection of tramcars trundling through the town centre, tugs with
paddle-wheels or donkeys on the Esplanade.
Leafing through the book awakened many memories. There is, for
instance, a postcard of Lynedoch Street, round the corner from where I
was born, and where I lived for the first 20 years of my life. It is not
a very interesting picture and one wonders why the photographer of the
day thought this particular view would interest anyone.
A more interesting portrait of the same street (tree-lined and with
horses) appeared for many years on a syrup tin -- for at the top of the
street was the Westburn sugar refinery.
There are several good pictures of Prince's Pier with steamers
alongside. I can close my eyes and remember every inch of the pier as it
used to be. As a child I took steamers over to Helensburgh.
The attractive pier buildings with their red Italianate towers
disappeared around 30 years ago, to be replaced by the giant cranes and
the straddle carriers of the Clyde Port Authority's container terminal.
Railway stations are arguably the most nostalgic places on earth. Yet
the station that arouses most memories for me is not one of this grand
glass palaces in the great cities of the world, but a small one-platform
effort called Greenock Upper at which trains no longer stop on the
journey from Glasgow to Wemyss Bay.
There is a postcard of it, too, in this book which surprises me.
The book contains postcards of many buildings still admired today --
Sir Gabriel Wood's Mariners' Home, the Watt Library and the former Watt
Memorial College. There are altogether 108 postcards each with a lengthy
caption making it all the more useful for those interested in Greenock's
history.

Unpeeled, Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band (Strange Fruit)
* HERE let it be known that I dost require a vast and seductive
orchestra comprised of demonic drummists, twangsome guitar-boys and
euphoric euphonium-players. And having assembled my musical company, I
shalt venture forth in world-wide public praise of the extreme genius of
Sir Vivian of Stanshall, head Bonzo, performing immortal songs like
Deathcab For Cutie and Kama Sutra (''In position 72, you were me and I
was you''). This new collection of tracks, which the Bonzos recorded for
Radio 1 between 1967 and 1969, is an utter inspiration. There's only one
which isn't on one of their studio albums, but the R1 versions display
such verve and sardonic energy. And, unlike most recorded comedy,
Bonzos' tracks increase in funniness with every play. Not enough people
know this, however. Hence my plan to tour the globe with a Bonzos'
tribute band. Until I get it all together, you can play your part by
buying this album. You'll know us when we eventually get up and running,
by the way: keep your eyes peeled for Johnny Hawk and the Pavement
Oysters.
Stanley Road, Paul Weller (Go! Discs)
* THE long-awaited latest edition of Old Mod's Almanac features
mature, muscular guitar as well as an abundance of reflective vocals.
Tunes and songs? Oh yes, there are a few of these, too. Principally,
though, Mr Weller seems to be focused on a reconsideration of the
cultural parameters of his childhood: the street in which he grew up,
his former pop idols, etc. What Mr Weller is saying about the wider
human condition, however, I have no idea. Maybe the following lines
contain a clue: ''And tho' I'm only one/ And tho' weak I'm strong/ And
if it comes to the crunch/ Then I'm the woodcutter's son/ And I'm
cutting down the wood for everyone.'' Ah, yes. In Stanley Road, you
evidently can't see the wood for the trees.
ISDN, Future Sound of London (Virgin)
* CAN there be rock performance without rock spectacle? Without rock
spectacle, can there be a rock audience? Rock journalists: if you took
away their spectacles, would they still be able to hear anything? The
answers to all/any of these questions may/may not be provided by this
CD. Ambient bleepery-bloopery first performed last year inside a small
London studio and then transmitted live to sundry radio stations -- both
European and American -- via ISDN digital phone link. The end-product is
so hypnotically groovy that you can taste the bass and smell the
rhythms. ISDN, FSOL? Wow.
DAVID BELCHER
Weber Piano Concertos, SCO/Mackerras (Hyperion)
* HYPERION'S massive survey of the hinterland of romantic piano
concertos reaches volume 10. This fascinating series -- recordings of
nineteenth-century concertos, popular in their day, now fallen into
obscurity -- has been dominated by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.
In this volume, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and Sir Charles Mackerras
weigh in with the superb Russian pianist Nicolai Demidenko as soloist in
Weber's two piano concertos and the more familiar Konzertstuck. Of the
two concertos, the first is the more interesting, on the one hand shot
through with a grace and style that are the legacy of the classical
period, but on the other bursting with a romantic dash, brio, and sheer
glitter that are instantly recognisable Weber fingerprints (and were
streets ahead of their time). The second concerto, written in the shadow
of Beethoven's Emperor, is a bit less imaginative.
Le Nozze di Figaro, SCO/Mackerras (Telarc)
* FIRST there was a sparkling Magic Flute, then an enchanting Cosi.
Now, eagerly awaited, here at last is the third in the SCO/Sir Charles
Mackerras Mozart opera cycle. This is the set that has become a fixture
in recent years at Usher Hall concerts in the Edinburgh Festival.
Immaculately prepared, performed with a brilliant sense of style, and
supremely cast, each of these has immediately become a collector's item.
Figaro is of the same class. Led by the magisterial bass Alastair Miles
in the title role, with the dazzling Nuccia Focile as Susanna and Carol
Vaness as the Countess, the cast and the SCO romp through this at a
breathtaking pace. A must.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Eleanor Shanley, Eleanor Shanley (Grapevine)
* THE former De Dannan singer's keenly anticipated debut doesn't
disappoint. Producer Donal Lunny wisely keeps enhancements of the live
arrangements to a minimum, so Raglan Road remains sparse and haunting,
and Maguire's Bus of Broken Dreams rocks sinuously. Shanley's voice is
perfectly weighted whatever the mood but the tearfully inclined should
stock up on Kleenex for Kilkelly, which evokes more emotion about 1800s
Ireland in seven minutes than The Hanging Gale has in four hours.
Speed of Light, Flora Purim (B+W)
* RECORDED in Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios with a veritable
United Nations of a cast, this is typical Purim: sensuous songs, intense
percussion workouts, atmospheric pieces and the odd slab of jazz-funk.
This woman could sing the Dundee Yellow Pages and make them sound exotic
and exciting, and while she may be content to remain a cult figure, the
Bahia hip hop of Light As My Flo' wouldn't sound out of place on Top of
the Pops.
ROB ADAMS
The Chase, Randy Sanke (Concord)
* SANDKE is a superb trumpeter. But you wouldn't know it from this
hugely disappointing album. The usually characterful Sandke sound is
most familiar from his stints in 20s-style bands like his own Wildcats,
but don't look for it in this bland collection except possibly on the
cool Cole Porter bossa nova So In Love (on which he switches to
flugelhorn). Lullabye of Broadway is a butchery, while The Folks Who
Live on the Hill have been exiled to Dullsville. Save your pennies for
his next CD.
Supreme, Coleman Hawkins (Enja)
* TENOR saxophonist Hawkins was recorded going down a storm in a
Baltimore club in 1966 -- just three years before his death -- in the
company of Barry Harris (piano), Gene Taylor (bass) and Roy Brooks
(drums). As powerful and inventive a player as ever, Hawkins drives his
band through a defiant Lover Come Back and the Blue Skies sound-alike,
In Walked Bud. But the ballads are the standouts: a laidback and
langorous Body and Soul (the tune that put him on the map) and --
especially -- the evocative and whoop-inducing Quincy Jones number

Visitor centres are there to make people question things. Many people
who come here are absolutely anti-wildfowling, but it's such an
important part of what happens here
RICK GOATER and I are standing on the edge of the Montrose Basin
nature reserve, internationally important for its populations of
redshank, knot, wigeon, pinkfoot and greylag geese. Goater, the
reserve's ranger-naturalist, and a man who knows his birds, has set up a
telescope so we can take a look at what's around.
Not much in the way of variety today. The pinkfeet and greylags, which
arrive in the autumn to over-winter in the basin, have taken flight on
their migratory course back to Iceland and Greenland.
I put my eye to the telescope and look across the flat calm water of
the basin to a mudflat, on which Goater has focused. There are lots of
eider ducks and some cormorants hanging themselves out to dry, their
wings outstretched like sheets on a washing line.
Goater explains that unlike the eiders and other waterborne birds,
cormorants' feathers are not waterproof. They become saturated with
water and heavy, so the birds dry them off by spreading them open.
It's the sort of intriguing information that will be passed on to the
expected 30,000 visitors a year to pass through a brand spanking new
#500,000 wildlife centre, due to open at the end of this month.
It will be something of a flagship for the Edinburgh-based Scottish
Wildlife Trust, which manages the Montrose Basin and has other reserves
in Scotland. ''We need to make it a vibrant place that will encourage
people to come again and again,'' says Goater, who has been operating
from home for the past nine years and is looking foward to having an
''office''.
The panoramic viewing windows at the front of the building will give
visitors an outstanding outlook over the basin and surrounding farmland,
with the busy town of Montrose and its prominent spire to one side, the
Angus glens and foothills of the Grampians in the background.
But the shadowy raven of controversy is circling overhead. Though the
wildlife trust owns a large part of the reserve, it does not own it all.
There are zones of use, and apart from sailing, wildfowling is allowed
in one zone. Shooting is permitted from September 1 to February 20, and
visitors standing in the new centre during this time will see birds
being blasted out of the sky.
It's likely to have a more than trivial impact on their sensibilities.
They will have come because, like the thousands of viewers who watch
nature programmes on television, they love wildlife and the natural
world. To see the very creatures they want to look at -- alive and
flying -- being killed for sport, will no go down well.
The paradox is not lost on Rick Goater. He and the other staff at the
centre will be as prepared as they can be for such events, but apart
from giving informed answers to the inevitable questions, there's
nothing they can do. The public's right to ''recreate on the foreshore''
in Scotland has existed for generations, and in this case that includes
wildfowling.
Shooting is by permit from Angus District Council, with 100 permits
per season issued to locals and five per day to visitors. On the quarry
list are most of the common migratory birds, and about 1500 are shot
during the permitted period. Goater says this has no damaging effect on
the overall size of a goose population numbering some 60,000.
Protected species, like mergansers, goosanders, shelducks, herons,
curlew, and redshank are not on the quarry list and should not be shot.
Nevertheless, says Goater, there are a few incidents every season when
they are.
''I don't think it is ever done deliberately, and the wildfowlers are
pretty contrite afterwards.'' He does admit, however, that unwitnessed
misdemeanours do take place, but is confident that because the
wildfowlers know there is likely to be someone watching them they are
more cautious. He is supposed to report every incident of a protected
species being shot to the police, but in practice prefers a more
conciliatory approach.
''Visitor centres are there to make people question things'', he says.
''Many people who come here are absolutely anti-wildfowling, but it's
such an important part of what happens here.'' He describes his own
attitude as ''ambivalent''.
Such glaringly controversial issues are not on the agenda for most
visitor centres of this kind. Confrontational this one certainly is, but
the state-of-the-art building will have other, more conventional
educative purposes, especially for schoolchildren, who are a target
audience.
It's mud, glorious mud, as the inimitable Flanders and Swan would have
it, along with its sheltered nature, that attracts birds in such large
numbers and in such variety to the Montrose Basin. The estuarine mud is
a rich food source for supporting winter migrants.
The centre project was conceived in the early 1980s, when the Scottish
Wildlife Trust realised the superb educational opportunities that such a
place could provide for school children, local people, and tourists.
Through the developmental stages there has been close consultation with
local teachers, the regional Environmental Education Forum and Education
Department, to ensure the centre's full potential would be realised.
The new five-to-14 schools curriculum emphasis on learning by
discovery and first-hand experience had been taken into account. So
children will have the chance to practise fieldwork skills by collecting
mud samples, recording information about the sediment and the
invertebrates found in it, interpreting and presenting their findings.
The basement of the three-storey, Scandinavian style building will house
a fully equipped laboratory for this purpose. The object is to show the
vital link between mud and migration.
For Rick Goater, who was brought up near Watford and inherited his
interest in wildlife from his parents, the centre will provide a new
focus. His enthusiasm for it is obvious as he shows me round the as-yet
unfinished building. Workmen are busy beavering away inside and out to
meet the completion deadline and the opening ceremony, to be conducted
in part by Magnus Magnusson, chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage.
We leave to move south to another part of the reserve. An inquisitive
swan glides haughtily around in the water, as Goater sets up the
telescope again in the hope we might see something a little more
interesting this time.
He focuses on another mudflat and I put my eye to the eyepiece.
Nothing especially unusual to be seen and we stand talking about the
reserve and Goater's background. Just then, a small group of pinkfeet
flies past in an arc. They have not migrated with the rest.
Goater says they won't now, and notices that the wing feathers of one
bird are damaged. It is flying lop-sidedly and would not have been able
to make the long flight to Iceland. Undoubtedly a casualty of the
wildfowling season; one that got away -- just -- but had suffered none
the less.
The wildfowlers do more damage than they realise, laments Goater -- a
note of regret in his voice. He may be ambivalent about wildfowling, but
I get the impression that his love of the birds comes first, and if he
had the choice, would rather it were not allowed.

POLICE were called to a caravan site yesterday after reports of a
disturbance. One man is now the subject of a report to the
procurator-fiscal.
The Silverbirch caravan site in Dalrymple, Ayrshire, is at the centre
of a row between the owner and a number of residents.
The owner wants to sell the site for housing and is trying to evict
six remaining mobile home owners.
The residents are holding out for compensation.
ScottishPower engineers arrived at the site yesterday to rig up an
alternative power supply for residents, after deciding they should not
suffer while the wrangle continues. The engineers found the supply had
been tampered with.
The supply was cut off earlier this week at the request of the owner,
Mr Liberty Joe Durant. However, ScottishPower, working closely with
Cumnock and Doon Valley District Council, installed an emergency supply.
The local MP, Mr George Foulkes, who visited the site yesterday, is
calling for increased legal protection for such residents, although it
has emerged that council officers have already prepared a report for the
procurator-fiscal, alleging breaches of the 1968 Caravan Sites Act which
makes it an offence to deprive residents of essential services.
Mr Durant was unavailable for comment last night.

The sand tiger shark was nine feet long and approaching about six feet
in front of me. My lungs began to pipe John William's Jaws theme up my
throat.
THERE are two cartoons in the diver's locker room at Deep Sea World.
The first says: When Diving Was Dangerous, Sex Was Safe. The second
shows two sharks eyeing up a couple of divers in masks, fins and
aqua-lungs. One shark asks the other: ''Will we eat them?'' The other
replys: ''No, that thing on their back makes me fart.''
As I bent, buckled and squeezed myself into the Northern Diver
drysuit, the threat of a dose of marine flatulence seemed a poor defence
against the flat-eyed terrors of the deep.
I had been assured at the North Queensferry complex that the sharks
would have no wish to eat me. I did not look like their natural prey of
fish, which are small, wet and flap about. No-one noticed that at the
time I felt small, was drenched in sweat and couldn't stop shaking. I
didn't feel like a flounder, but given time . . .
In the next chamber was the world's largest underwater safari. Four
and a half million litres of filtered sea water containing dozens of
species and hundreds of fish including bass, cod, plaice, bream,
mackerel, lesser spotted dogfish, conger eels, skates and sharks. The
nine bigger sharks were sand tigers -- the largest about nine feet long.
All the sand tigers have names like Stella, Bertha, Fred, Barnie and
Dino. The largest is called The Preacher because most people see him and
start to pray. Barnie sounded like a bundle of laughs in comparison.
''Mind, the big one is a bit frisky'' said another diver to Stuart
Bell, my scuba guru, a graduate of applied marine biology at
Heriott-Watt University and an employee at Deep Sea World for the past
two years.
''Frisky?'' I nervously asked while trying to picture how a shark
could possibly flirt. Then I remembered Gary Larson's sketches of one
shark in a dinner suit eyeing up his ballgowned partner and the caption:
''Baby, you're dressed to kill''.
''Don't worry,'' Stuart said as he helped zip up my drysuit. To
explain, a wet suit gets you wet, the water enters holes in the suit but
doesn't exit, so your body-temperature heats the water, providing an
insulating layer.
A dry suit seals out the water allowing you to wear tracksuit bottoms
and T-shirt underneath for warmth. Once sealed inside my suit, we
clambered into a tiny tank, containing only a few crabs, where I hauled
on my air-tank and weight belt. Sinking to the bottom I struggled to
gain my balance against the backwards pull of the weights and tank.
Gripping Stuart's arm, I drained the air from the suit and orientated
myself to the sensation of breathing underwater.
When I was relaxed, Stuart opened the hatch leading through to the
main safari tank. Rock walls dropped to the sandy floor 30 feet below.
The sight before my masked eyes was the Little Mermaid mixed up with
Mary Poppins.
Brightly coloured fish of greens, blues and greys darted, twisted and
turned, a giant skate flapped over the tunnel as tourists, wide-eyed in
wonder peered up as I looked down into an utterly silent world. The only
sound was the rasp of my own breath and the click of swallowing.
Stuart descended first and I quickly followed squinting while the
pressure built in my ears. Just as on an aeroplane, you can clear them
by pinching your nose and blowing. On the bottom I lost balance but was
supported by Stuart as I found my feet.
The childhood memories of The Underwater World of Jacques Cousteau on
BBC1 flooded in, mixing with devoured books and magazines on sharks and
the Japanese animation of Marine Boy. Though the habitat felt natural,
it would be impossible to view such a variety of sea-life in Scotland's
brackish waters. Once I had gained some confidence, Stuart returned to
the surface to collect underwater photographer, Gavin Anderson.
It was then I noticed the little four-year-old waving from the tunnel.
The paranoia began. I started to think: what if I was eaten by a nine
foot shark? Would it scar him for life? Then I put myself in his place.
As a small child my only response to a diver being savaged to death by a
giant shark just feet in front of me would be . . . COOOOOL!!!
Deep Sea World was drawing them in with a blood-curdling exhibition
about pirates, just how much would business boom if the sharks were to
turn savage. It's all very well saying these sharks are environmentally
friendly and only eat wee fish. That's boring, it's blood that the
punters want to see. I inched my head carefully, scanning for Stuart's
return. Then I remembered I hadn't signed my insurance disclaimer.
When actor Phillip Schofield dived here he had to sign one. So if I
were to be savaged to death by a giant shark, my family will reap rich
rewards! But then Sea-World could probably afford to cover a law suit
for me from their feeding expenses. Phillip Schofield would bankrupt
them, I wouldn't even bust up petty cash. IT WAS A TRAP!!!
Panic and paranoia rose with my air bubbles as I caught a blurry
glimpse of my foe curving around on the other side of the acrylic tunnel
with a lazy flick of its tail. This sand tiger shark was nine feet long
and approaching about six feet in front and above me. My lungs began to
pipe John William's Jaws theme up my throat.
A few images looped in my head before it arrived. Robert Shaw
desperately kicking at the munching mouth of the great white shark,
before disappearing inside. The severed leg dropping to the bottom of
the boating pond, a tumbling head, and Roy Schneider up on a sinking
flag pole, taking aim and screaming: ''Smile you son of a . . .'' BOOM!
And then it was before me in direct contrast to the celluloid
nightmares of Hollywood. There was no evil eye staring me out, no
prowling movements or even any interest, instead it swam by like a bored
fridge. Just then, water began to fill my mask obscuring the view, once
I had cleared it my foe turned distant friend was disappearing into the
distance. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder marking Stuart's return
with photographer Gavin Anderson.
Gavin on the surface was confident and relaxed. ''If we want to get a
picture of you with a shark you're going to have to get quite close so I
can blast it with the flash and get the shot.''
''You won't annoy it?'' I worried.
''What?''
''The shark, you won't annoy it?''
''It'll be fine.'' He said shaking his head and administering a
friendly pat.
Thirty feet down he fiddled with his camera while occasionally giving
the OK signal, your thumb and first finger in a circle while your
remaining three stick up in the air. I responded, though the mouth-piece
hid any manic grins I made.
To recap on the sunken scene, I was kneeling on the bottom with my
tank to the tunnel. Stuart was stationed protectively to my left side
while Gavin hung about on the right, itching to shoot. I felt like bad
bait, only crowds of cod, bass and flounder flocked towards me.
Ten or 12 of them mobbed round my mask, occasionally touching the
glass before fleeing. Then I remembered sharks eat fish and suddenly
felt like jam in a swiss roll at a kid's tea party. But they wouldn't
leave. After a few minutes of deep breathing, Grant got excited which
could only mean one thing, the return of the floating fridge.
Earlier while changing, we had rehersed how I would tilt my head
backwards so that my face and the shark's would fit inside the same
frame. But I couldn't do it. I didn't want to, I slightly tilted my head
and noticed the soft under-belly breeze above me, close enough to touch.
This was real, not an image from a movie.
The finest moment of a memorable dive was as we slowly rose to the
surface as a giant skate flappped past on one side while a sand tiger
shark browsed by below me. The chance of such an encounter in the opens
seas would be as slim as my chances of survival without Stuart's
reassuring presence and training.
Breaking the surface and wrenching out the mouthpiece I swore, and
swore, and swore. Expletives are often as descriptive for the
undescribable as words and they come charged with more impact. I had
swum with sharks. Childhood fears and attractions had been satisfied
when I touched another world and found it wet and wanting. I simply
wanted to return.

<HEADLINE>Worst misconduct for years, says tribunal Lawyer couple expelled from profession</HEADLINE>

THE expulsion from the legal profession of a husband and wife team
found guilty of professional misconduct took effect yesterday, with the
publication of a detailed 125-page judgment by the Scottish Solicitors
Discipline Tribunal.
The tribunal described the case of Gordon and Maria Thomson as
undoubtedly the worst of its kind for a number of years.
The actual decision of the tribunal to strike the couple off was
announced in April, but did not take effect until the publication of the
detailed reasons yesterday.
Mr Gordon Thomson, 36, and Maria, 34, have already announced their
intention to appeal to the Court of Session against the most severe
punishment the discipline tribunal can impose.
They now have 21 days to lodge the appeal and to ask for the
striking-off order to be suspended pending the appeal, which could be
some months away.
Yesterday, Mr Thomson, speaking from his office in the Sighthill
Shopping Centre in Edinburgh, commented: ''We will be lodging an appeal
at the Court of Session against the decision as soon as possible and I
am confident we will win.''
The couple are two of the country's most high-profile lawyers. Mr
Thomson's trademark is his powerful Harley Davidson motor cycle and his
''up-front'' approach is typified by his striking TV advertising
campaign -- ''Gordon Thomson, solicitor. A great man to have on your
side.''
The tribunal said yesterday, however, that the couple had generally
run their law firm, Gordon Thomson and Company, in a manner which had
brought the legal profession into disrepute.
''The whole operation of the firm was 'fee driven' with assistants,
qualified and unqualified, being under constant pressure to reach high
fees targets (of #800 a day).
''Assistants were commonly subjected to abuse . . . if set targets had
not been achieved.''
According to the tribunal, the emphasis on maximising the firm's
profits was illustrated by an instruction that a statement had to be
taken every time there was a meeting with a client, whether or not any
new material had come to light.
Mrs Thomson had once commented: ''Pages mean wages.''
The tribunal took the view that it was hypocritical of the Thomsons to
refer to clients as ''friends'' when their motivating force had been the
fees which could be generated from the legal aid fund ''utilising these
clients rather than providing them with proper services.''
In relation to legal aid, the tribunal found that when the Scottish
Legal Aid Board had asked for claims for fees totalling #30,000 to be
justified, the Thomsons had been unable to produce any files or records
to account for the fees. In the circumstances, the board had not paid
the fees.
An unspecified amount of fees had been repaid to the board following
court appearance by people from Thomson and Co who were not enrolled
solicitors.
''The absence of any satisfactory procedures for supervising their
practice resulted in Mr and Mrs Thomson being culpable in respect of
fees being charged to the legal aid board which were not properly due,''
added the tribunal.
It stated that dates had been fraudulently altered within the
Thomsons' office in relation to six applications for fees under the
advice and assistance scheme.
There had been a delay in lodging the forms and they would been
regarded as time-barred if the forms had been lodged without alteration.
There was no suggestion that the Thomsons had been a party to the
alteration of the forms, but the tribunal added: ''Their aggressive
approach towards maximising their fee income may have influenced the
assistant to alter the documents.
''It was Mr and Mrs Thomson's culpable lack of supervision which
permitted these forms to be lodged in their altered state.
''The tribunal has no hesitation in saying that they are unfit to be
members of the profession.''

BRITISH Rail was back in court yesterday two days after its
comprehensive legal defeat in the Fort William sleeper case.
This time, Strathclyde Regional Council and Strathclyde Passenger
Transport Executive went to the Court of Session over their fears for
the level of services in the region after privatisation.
The current agreement between the SPTE and British Rail, under which
BR is paid by the SPTE to run trains as and when the transport executive
requires, dates from 1979 and is due to run out on September 30 this
year.
The agreement covers frequency, timings, standards, type and capacity
of trains.
After September BR's liabilities under the agreement transfer to
ScotRail Railways Ltd and there will be a new track access arrangement
between Railtrack and ScotRail Railways which will have to be approved
by the new Rail Regulator, Mr John Swift, QC.
Strathclyde region and the SPTE fear that the current services and
timetables will not be maintained under the new arrangement.
They asked Lord Cameron for an order which would maintain the present
level of access to railway track and stations as is provided under the
current agreement.
BR asked the judge to refuse to grant any order. It argued that any
interim interdict preventing the negotiation and conclusion of the track
access contract would be highly prejudicial to the interests of the
public.
It said that it was aware of its obligations under the present
agreement and considered that it would be able to fulfil them.
Lord Cameron said he would give a decision in writing at a later date.
Meanwhile, The Herald has discovered that the reasons for axing the
Fort William sleeper and Motorail serices were not passed on to the
Transport Secretary.
Under the terms of the the 1993 Railways Act, the franchise director
is told: ''In order for you to decide appropriate service specifications
for loss-making services you will need to develop criteria which will
enable you to evaluate the benefits to be obtained from their provision.
Such criteria must be submitted to me for approval.''
These criteria have never been developed far less submitted to Dr
Brian Mawhinney, Transport Secretary, for approval.
Mr Douglas Young, Highland Regional Council's principal administrator,
said yesterday he had written twice to Mr Roger Salmon, director of rail
franchising, seeking information on any criteria.
''It was indicated to us that the criteria. . . have not yet been
finalised. But enclosed was an explantory note which referred to the the
franchise director basing the initial passenger service requirements on
the timetable being operated by BR immediately prior to franchising.''
Mr Young would not be drawn further, but another council official
confirmed this was an area being examined by the council's legal
representatives.

Joe Donnelly reports great news for cowards everywhere, as science
catches up with Doc McCoy
WHEN they say, this won't hurt a bit, what they normally mean -- even
the most gentle of nurses -- is ''this is going to hurt like hell''.
It's true. Ask any kid. Ask any journalist.
Yet now, a miracle. Researchers at Oxford BioSciences have pioneered
the development of a medical marvel which will go down in history, at
least among us cowards, as being as significant as a cure for the common
cold or hangovers.
Basically it's a needle-less injection. The fundamental new technique
for the administration of drugs and other medicines into the human body
is known as Transdermal Powered Delivery. Its like has only been seen
wielded by Doc McCoy on Star Trek and he's light years away from the
here and now.
At Oxford BioSciences Limited they've produced a hand-held needle-less
device which will shoot drugs through the skin in fine powdered form, it
works by using compressed gas to accelerate the powder to twice the
speed of sound -- faster than a rifle bullet, and travelling at a mile
every couple of seconds -- which gives the particles enough momentum to
penetrate the outer layers of skin before diffusing into the
bloodstream.
The final device, when marketed, will be a pen-sized, single-use
disposable syringe which will incorporate the medicines within a sterile
package.
The good news -- the great news -- is that preliminary trials on
people show that it is absolutely painless. Live trials show that where
powdered insulin was given to both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects,
it was extremely effective in reducing blood glucose levels.
Among the benefits would be an easy delivery system for diabetics,
particularly children who at present face daily self-injections. Another
advantage lies in the fact that because the device does not break the
skin there's no possibility of cross-contamination of blood-borne
infections such as HIV and hepatitis.
Oxford BioSciences say the new device overcomes needle-phobia and
would reduce patients' reluctance to have injections, and the fact that
it uses powdered drugs which are often more stable than liquids and
cheaper to manufacture and store, will produce financial benefits.
And have I mentioned that it doesn't hurt at all?
Meanwhile, in the USA, scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National
Lab in California are working on a high-tech system to plug blood
vessels in the brain to prevent bleeding during surgery. Using a
wire-thin catheter threaded into an artery, they release a cloud of
microscopic sponges and platinum coils to form a clot to stop
uncontrolled, fatal bleeding in the brain.
Other devices including the mechanical gripper, almost too small to
see, which opens and closes, acting as tiny grabs and hands inside the
body to carry out remote micro-surgery.
The micro-surgical tools being designed now should give surgeons a
Swiss-army knife range of specialised equipment to take micro-surgery in
to the next century. Added to that is the potential of another Livermore
project which aims to create a credit-card sized diagnostic device using
miniature silicon chamber to analyse germs or forensic samples.

TESTS carried out on samples of counterfeit tea bags seized by
Strathclyde Consumer and Trading Standards (CATS) officers have revealed
that no health hazard can be detected in the bags tested.
The tests followed the discovery of thousands of fake tea bags and an
operation in which CATS officers cleared the tea bags from the shelves
of shops earlier this week.
Mr Bruce Collier, director of CATS, said yesterday :''We are confident
that we now have all the counterfeit tea bags accounted for. Consumers
can now be assured that Tetley products on the shelves are genuine and
can be purchased with full confidence in the authenticity and quality of
the product.''
However, he still urged anyone who has purchased the counterfeit
Tetley 80 packs, with the serial number 4017E and expiry date July 1995,
to hand them in at their local consumer and trading standards office to
help CATS officers continue with their investigations.
Mr Collier added that the CATS department was delighted with the
co-operation received from the public, traders, Lyons Tetley, and the
media in dealing what he said could have been a major counterfeit
triumph for the criminals.

THE quick brown fox is jumping but where is the lazy dog? ''Oh,
right,'' says Christine Taylor when taxed with the question. ''It's just
a poor lazy mouse that's been caught.'' We've been looking at pictures
of her recently completed mural for the wildlife centre at New Lanark.
Down in the forest other things are stirring. A family of badgers, for
one thing. Some are above ground while others are padding purposefully
down their subterranean passages.
This charming mural is typical of the work of Mrs Taylor, a
Portsmouth-trained interior designer who has settled in the Perthshire
village of Gartmore after a decade on the west coast of America.
She went to America after art school with dreams of using her
professional training. Hollywood was her first stop. ''It was very
sleazy I can tell you,'' she laughs without rancour. She migrated to San
Francisco, and, when work with architects fell through because of lack
of permits, took a job with glazing sub-contractors there. Also during
this period in her life spent two years in the Caribbean and studied
architecture for a year at Glasgow School of Art.
She ''really loved it'' in Glasgow but became ineligible for grants
and returned to the States. Back in Scotland again, with her American
husband and two young sons, she had hopes of working on architectural
design but again found herself working for a glazing company. That
firm's demise was the final impetus for her to turn to murals.
Chaz, aged six, had already had his bedroom transformed by a
Paddington Bear seaside scene in which the Peruvian charmer gets up to
all sorts of mischief on a south-of-England beach. Elder brother Maxwell
(10) has a variety of high-powered aeroplanes -- Tornado, F15 Eagle,
Harrier, Phantom -- zooming round the walls of his bedroom, setting off
his own model planes. An ideal scenario for a young lad, and with the
additional charm of being original art work.
Mrs Taylor has now done about 10 bedroom scenes for children, her
commissions coming through personal recommendation. One of these, in
Howwood, takes the story of Tintin and the Black Isle for its
inspiration. Another is given over to whales. A black and white
Orca-like creature rears from the sea in this, while elsewhere in the
atmospheric composition a gigantic tail (perhaps belonging to a blue
whale) threatens to overturn the young owner's bed. Great fun and
carrying its own ecological message too.
Mrs Taylor also works with architects. Hence the New Lanark commission
and the one for a new natural history museum in Ardnamurchan. This
underwater scene is on a 12ft by 15ft ragged background shape, rather
like a rock pinnacle. The amount of research for it was ''astronomical''
says Mrs Taylor. The marine life and vegetation of Loch Sunart are
imaginatively depicted by means of oil glazes and subtle marbling
techniques.
She is setting herself new challenges with painting effects, using
both oils and acrylics. Her own bathroom walls are cloud-capped, her
kitchen decorated with mottled walls and trompe-l'oeil tiles. The wit
and charm of her work should continue to draw discerning customers.

D. S. MacColl
Maureen Borland
Lennard Publishing. #20
FOR more than 50 years D.S. MacColl was a key figure in the British
art world, as art critic and latterly as head of the Tate 1906-11;
curator of the Wallace Collection and founder of the National Art
Collections Fund. Friends included Whistler, Beardsley, Sickert, Steer,
Guthrie, Rothenstein, Ellen Terry, Beerbohm and Roger Fry. This for a
minister's son who left Glasgow Academy to study for the church.
When his papers were left to Glasgow University in 1971, they
presented a huge task but a rich vein to mine. The papers were
catalogued by Special Collections, so when Maureen Borland arrived in
1989, with permission from MacColl's executor to write the biography,
she could set to immediately.
Six years later, her biography is welcome for it makes available
chunks of his writing and much previously hidden information. MacColl
was a diligent correspondant from early youth, writing long letters to
his mother and sisters, so there is much to draw on. Too much, perhaps.
Borland's enthusiasm for detail meets the reader head-on in the first
chapter where accounts of generations of MacColls leave one exhausted
and confused by the time young ''Suthie' enters. The pages continue
thick with anecdote and trivia. It's difficult to see the wood for the
trees. Does it matter that Oscar Browing produced formidable
testimonials yet did not get appointed to University College School, so
did not teach MacColl?
Friendship was integral to MacColl's life and more relevant are
memories of his contemporaries and evenings when he ''adjourned to
partake of more alchoholic beverages and confabulation.'' I find
Borland's old-fashioned phraseology annoying but maybe MacColl's pompous
style imprinted itself on her own.
MacColl certainly had a fine life. At 36 he ''still lacked a definite
career pattern,'' content to idle away idyllic summers in France where
he bathed, ''under a cavalcade of Monet's poplars and saw Monet himself
setting off trundling a barrow-load of canvases, to snatch, in 20-minute
spells, the kaleidoscope of the sun's turnabout.''
MacColl devloped an acerbic turn of phrase to lambast the
establishment of the day, its architecture, ('Plumbers' Period') and to
promote the Impressionists and his friends. He admitted he was ''not so
much a critic as an advocate -- the frankly partisan advocate of the New
English Art Club.'' MacColl believed, ''Hardly anything worse can be
said of a man than to insinuate that he is an Royal Academician -- or
might some day become one.''
Much of his focus is all too true today. When the Tate Gallery opened
in 1897 he wrote that it was ''harder for our National Gallery to secure
masterpieces. It has to complete with the wide-awake foreign galleries
and with the rich private collector, and the old private collections
that were the pride of this country are draining away into foreign
hands.'' He mocked the Academy and its ''babies, bishops, puppies and
scenes of domesticity which give the great British public such unalloyed
pleasure'' and bemoaned that the hanging committee allotted the best
spaces to the privileged few whether their work was good or bad.''
He attacked the Paris establishment too. ''It is consoling to observe
how in the general press of dullness, real artistic distinction tells''
finding only two gems among 3000 canvases, both by Whistler. ''They
judge the huge fruitless labour round them so quietly and so cruelly!'
His marriage in 1897 left him ''too content with his unstructured life
to take up a position that would demand daily attendance and a regular
timetable'' but luck was on his side. Aged 47 he was suddenly offered a
job as head of the Tate. The Times wondered ironically if McCall ''might
in time even begin to admire some of the pictures in his care.'' Illness
brought the ''easier' job of keeper of the Wallace Collection. His
charmed life lasted till the age of 89.

* SWISS researches have discovered women are attracted to the smell of
men who have different immune systems from their own. Initial
experiments showed that mice bred with mates with different immune
genes. Getting humans to breed on demand was problematic so the T-shirt
smelling test was used. Apparently it only works with women who are not
taking oral contraceptives. The male T-shirt wearers had to avoid
alchohol, spicy foods and to sleep alone to avoid contamination on their
shirts.
* FORD is pushing back the frontiers of recycling with a portable
machine which can identify the composition of different plastics.
Developed by Southampton Uni and expected to be in production for use in
scrapyards and reclaimers by the end of the year, the hand-held machine
is no bigger than a domestic steam iron. It allows plastics to be
recovered separately as mixing the wrong types can ruin whole batches of
material.
* ASTRONOMERS at the Royal Greenwick Observatory have used the Hubble
space telescope to get the most accurate measurement yet of a galaxy in
Virgo. This will now help provide a precise calculation of the expansion
rate of the universe which, when known, will give a pointer to its age
and size.
* THE Natural Fibres Organisation, launched last August, is searching
for new materials from farm crops, They have 300 members (at #100 a
head) mainly farmers but including seed breeders, linoleum manufacturers
and linen weavers. They plan (like Courtaulds with new Tencel) to
promote a shift from synthetics to natural alternatives from crops like
Flax and Hemp which declined in the fifties with the advent of synthetic
fibres.
* BUBL, an internet information service run by Strathclyde University
library systems division has been adopted throughout the UK. A bulletin
board for libraries, it gets 35,000 accesses a month and has now
transformed from a local text file service to a full Internet
multi-media resource. The service provides the UK academic network and
library community with user-friendly access to the internet.
A #50,000 three-year project between Axis Genetics and the John Innes
Institute is aimed at using plant genes to manufacture vaccines. The
project hopes to exploit the genetic modification of plant viruses by
injecting fragments of viruses to produce large quantities of safe
vaccines. The potential is enormous, with 100 doses of vaccine being
produced from a single leaf.
THE woods should smell sweeter thanks to an ecology move by the
Forestry Commission. They've now had an oil change in their chain-saws,
switching from mineral oil to biodegradable vegetable oil. It's a
greener alternative for the greenwood, based on rape-seed, which breaks
down within a month. Instead of smelling like an engine sump due to the
annual 90,000 litres of mineral oil sprayed into the air from chainsaws,
the veggie oil might make ramblers think something's cooking. Apparently
it smells like frying chips.
* A DUNDEE team of researchers have invented a new way of raising the
roof, and the development could be a serious money earner in the
construction industry.
The radical new jointing system by Dr Ahmed Elsheikh of the Department
of Civil Engineering at Dundee University, on which two patent
applications have already been lodged, could halve the costs of building
stadiums, public halls and hangars.
CATRUS is what is known in the trade as a space truss system, a series
of metal bars and joints creating a lattice arrangement capable of
supporting a roof and used to cover large open areas with as few
internal supports as possible.
The secret is in the simplicity of the joints which would normally
need expensive welding at the connections, but the Dundee system
eliminates the need for welding entirely, making it simple to construct
and light and easy to assemble.

THE last time wood hit the fashion front, it was in the seventies and
the wood was used for platform soles. Fashion it might have been, but
the solid chunks of trees used to give a bit of lift were ungainly,
heavy and caused a spate of sprained ankles among the unsteady.
Now, 20 years on, wood is back at the cutting edge of fashion, and
there's nothing unwieldy about it. Believe it or not, our model is
wearing a tree. And let's get the puns over with. She's not pining, and
she does look fine on the beech? The tree-top material is Tencel, a
revolutionary new fibre developed by Courtaulds.
It's made from cellulose, the chief constituent of plant cells, so
it's as organic as linen or cotton, or even the recycled mulberry leaves
chewed by caterpillars and ending up as silk. Although pioneered and
developed by Courtnaulds in the UK, it's manufactured in the USA.
However, a new plant is being built in Grimsby to bring production back
across the Atlantic. The plant will produce about 75,000 tons of the
yarn.
Courtaulds say Tencel was developed in response to demand for
environmentally-sound fibres. It is possibly one of the most significant
man-made fibre on the market since the launch of nylon in the 30s, and
its significance is such that research scientist Patrick White, who was
reponsible for its development, was awarded the MBE in the New Year
List. It's apparently the only fibre after cotton which can create the
truly authentic denim look, but the makers say it's the ''cashmere'' of
denim because of its softness.
They use wood pulp from harvested trees -- forests which are self
sustaining -- which they dissolve into a solution and then extrude to
yield extremely fine filaments. The firm boasts that the solvents used
are almost totally recycle.
The end result is a fibre stronger than cotton and almost as strong as
artificial polyester. It is hard-wearing and long lasting, and because
it is completely organic it breathes just like other natural cloth.
High fashion designers, including Katharine Hamnett, have already been
quick to snap up swatches and produce a range of casual gear. A number
of manufacturers have adopted it. Many new ranges are in the pipeline at
Jaeger, Next, Country Casuals and the like.
Courtaulds sent some of the material to Frontiers. It feels like a
strong-brushed cotton with the fine-weave of microfibre. Frontiers shall
be sending measurements for the complete rig-out. When kids come home at
dinner time with the knees and backsides out of their pants, mothers are
prone to moan that clothes don't grow on threes.
Now they do. And it's nice to see hi-tech and high fashion together.

Banks are figuring ever smarter ways to beat credit card frauds
HI-TECH fraud needs equally scientific solutions to combat the cheats
ripping off banks to the tune of almost #100m every year in the UK
alone.
Now banks are hitting back, and Barclays believes it has turned the
tide in a cutting edge crusade which has seen the development of
electronic fingerprint scanners to read a customer's identity.
More than two million plastic cards were lost or stolen last year and
of them, almost 200,000 were used illegally to steal #96.8m. The average
loss for every card was almost #500.
At Barclays last year, fraud cost #29m and cash machine frauds took
more than a million, making it worth the bank's while to invest in
hi-tech solutions.
After a period of escalating fraud, Barclays said it has shown a
significant year-on fall for the past three years.
One worrying trend all banks face is the fact that criminals now have
the technology to produce counterfeit cards which contain a copy of the
information stored on the real card's magnetic strip.
To combat this, Barclays are testing this biometric scanner which
assesses the customer's fingerprint pattern through electronic scanning
technology. The system is clean, fast and foolproof and dispenses with
the messy inkpads used by the police.
Another scanner being developed also reads the entire hand to measure
the shape, length and width of the fingers.
If the finger and hand fails to match the pattern stored in the card's
information, the bank is immediately alerted.
Technology is also being used in signature verification trials which
focuses on the way customers sign their names, the speed of writing and
the direction of the strokes.
This, they say, is a highly secure means of identification because
well-crafted signature forgeries, while difficult to spot manually, are
instantly detectable using electronic systems.
One of the drawbacks they've scientifically discovered, is the fact
that people's signatures vary according to the mood, time of day,
temperature and host of influencing factors. The system still needs some
work.
So do bank cards. The bank is investigating the use of smart cards
which have a computer chip embedded in to the plastic, making the
magnetic strip redundant.
A plastic card with an electronic watermark is also undergoing tests.
This would be indistinguishable from any other to the human eye, but it
would contain particles in a particular pattern which would be
identified by a retailer's terminal.
While Barclays is pushing the limits of bank security, it still
believes cardholders themselves can combat most of the fraud by being
more careful with their cards and pin numbers. Half the plastic cards
are stolen in burglaries, car thefts and pick-pocketing. The rest are
simply lost.
The flexible friend can become a foe when it gets into the wrong
hands.

Catherine Brown stresses the importance of preserving local tradition
in food and drink production
WHEN the Greeks took the Danes to the European Court for making their
Feta with cow's milk, instead of the traditional sheep's, the Greeks
lost their case. Feta can now be been made with the wrong milk. Perhaps
one day French Roquefort will be made with cow's milk too. Preserving
the integrity of native food and drink traditions, threatened by too
permissive European standards and a deluge of international junk food,
has been a particular concern of the French in recent years.
In 1989 they set up the Conseil National des Arts Culinaires (CNAC)
with the aim of preserving the nation's food awareness. It was backed by
the government, commercial interest and local and regional councils, who
were asked to ''treat traditional and regional food products as they
would public monuments''.
Now, the scope of this initiative includes eight European countries,
and experts in each (including the UK) have been compiling information
on the precise nature of their food and drink specialities for the
European Inventory of National and Regional foods. It may mean fewer
European squabbles, but it will mean nothing if mass production
uniformity kills them off, or if the fragile local economies, often the
main producers of these foods, fail to maintain themselves successfully.
At this year's Royal Highland Show at Ingliston (June 22 - 25), one of
Scotland's outlying regions is the centrepiece of the Food from Scotland
exhibition. Dumfries and Galloway, by-passed by all the major
north-south routes, is a quiet place of shapely hills, colourful
villages, sandy beaches, productive farmlands and off-the-beaten-track
isolation, where it is vital that regional food and drink assets
succeed.
Wigtonshire, at its furthest corner, has already been recognised by
the EC as Status 5B (fragile rural area), which has meant vital
additional funding for major infrastructure development through the
LEADER (Links between Actions for the Development of the Rural Economy)
programme.
When south west corner people compare themselves with their
counterparts in, say, the north east they can see some similarities.
They share a livestock, fishing and tourism industry and a distinguished
history of stock breeding. Yet while all the world knows of Aberdeen
Angus cattle, who knows that Galloway has its own, equally
distinguished, native breed of cattle?
Everyone knows of a Finnan Haddock, but who knows of the Solway
Queenie? This small scallop, about the size of a two pence piece, is
sweeter, with a more delicate flavour than the larger species, known as
King scallop.
Other fishing assets in the area include wild Solway salmon, as well
as landings along the Solway coast at small ports such as Kirkcudbright,
Garlieston, Isle of Whithorn, and Portpatrick of plaice, turbot, Dover
sole, brill, halibut, monkfish and skate, as well as haddock and
whiting.
Dumfries and Galloway is an equally important milk producer. Two
large, modern, high-tec creameries operate in the area, making
award-winning mature Scottish cheddar, with a pleasantly-rounded, sharp
tang.
Smaller cheesemaking enterprises, making revivalist artisan cheeses in
farmhouse creameries from unpasteurised cows and ewes' milk are
developing, alongsisde production of yogurt and ice cream;andno rundown
of the local food potential would be complete without mention of those
who have successfully created new products.
Many of the local companies are taking stand space at the Highland
Show, and Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise are also setting up a small
''delicatessen'' shop where other products from smaller producers will
be on sale.
On a centrepiece stand, a team of local and internationally famous
chefs will demonstrate dishes using the products of the area. Your
Foodwatch correspondent has been employed over the last few months
compiling a Food Trail of good shopping and eating-out in the area,
which will be launched along with another publication on its
agricultural history.
Top international food designer, Clare Ferguson, will build a
sculpture of the region using local produce and packaging with the help
of Dumfries schoolchildren and art students.

* BRITAIN'S scientific community is to get an #80m boost, according to
David Hunt, Minister for Science. Half of the cash comes from a #40m
Foresight Challenge Fund set up to help put Britain at the cutting edge
of world scientific and engineering achievement. That #40m will be
matched by funds from the private sector.
The challenge fund money is on top of the #70m in a new package of
measures announced by the DTI to follow up Technology Foresight and
support small and medium sized enterprises.
The Science Minister said: ''The challenge now is to get industry and
the science, engineering and technology base working together.''
The second Foresight Link programme was announced at the same time as
the new Challenge package. The #9m research programme, a joint venture
between public and private bodies, will focus on recycling technologies
to reduce waste in manufacturing industry. The Link initiatives are
designed to encourage research and industry to work together.
Mr Hunt said: ''This exciting new programme will benefit both the
environment and industry. More effective use of natural resources and
reductions in waste and pollutants will also benefit the environment.''

* TRAVEL through the countryside of Dumfries and Galloway at this time
of year and the long-lasting impression is of lush green grass. In terms
of food in the shops, it means a change in the flavour and quality of
all grazing animals which will continue into the autumn.
While most city butchers have little contact with the land where their
meat carcasses come from, in rural areas some butchers, like Willie
Lindsay of Creetown, buy directly from the farmer. Others, like Clark
Grierson of Castle Douglas, have their own herds. Of his 168 beef cattle
some are pedigree Galloways, which he grazes on his own land throughout
the winter and spring, judging for himself when each animal is ready for
slaughter.
Also affected by lush new grass, of course, is milk. Made into cheese
at two large modern creameries, it's also used by small specialist
cheesemakers such as Loch Arthur Creamery at Beeswing, Galloway
Farmhouse (ewes) at Sorbie and California Farm (goats) at Whithorn. For
them, and many new ventures of on-farm ice-cream and yogurt making, this
is the start of the peak milk flavour season.

* COMPAQ computers are collaborating with a major housebuilder on the
UK's first ever digital homes. The modern houses, built by Rice Homes,
come with built-in computer networks and a series of telephone lines for
fax, phone connections and access to the internet. The system apparently
allows householders to access the internet line in the bathroom -- even
if they're otherwise engaged. Compaq dealers will support the system
with full IT consultancy and training.
Rice homes boss Ken Rice who thought up the idea says that because of
the expansion of networking and internet access, homebuyers will see the
system as a vital component of home life.
''No one would consider moving into a house without plumbing for a
washing machine, aerial ports for television and electrical sockets.
Computer technology facilities are just as essential in the future.''
The homes of the future are on the market for just more than #63,000.
They're in Kent, unfortunately.
* HEWLETT-PACKARD has announced two new Flash SIMM models for its
Laserjet 4 series of printers, plus the 5P, 5MP and HP Colour Laserjet.
The SIMM is a non-volatile rewriteable memory technology which allows
standard forms, letterheads, logos and other print-art to be downloaded
and stored in the printer. Once downloaded, fonts and macros will remain
there until they are needed, allowing them to be printed off on demand.
At the same time, HP has announced the first tape-backup system (for
storing digital information direct from computers) based on Travan
technology. It uses mini-cartridge technology in a system which uses 750
feet of tape to store an astonishing 800 megabytes of information in
compressed form. The new backup, used for storing vital digital
information securely outside a PC, will retail for #169.
* DIGITAL has announced what it describes as the computer industry's
most powerful server system for large commercial and scientific
applications, which have until now needed traditional mainframes or
supercomputers.
Their new AlphaServer 8400 enterprise and 8200 departmental server are
the first to use the Alpha ''BIPS'' chip from Digital to deliver the
highest performance to cost ratio at a tenth of the price of most
mainframes. The company say it produces almost three times the
performance of its closest competitor. The more expensive system, the
8400, comes in at #175,000.
* TO complement Digital's servers, Oracle Corporation have introduced
the 64-bit technology to its Oracle 7 database solution. The very large
memory technology will be the first to exploit the 64-bit Unix on Alpha.
The Oracle option is a major breakthrough in database performance which
allows a larger proportion of the database to stay in memory. As a
result, more users can access more critical data faster.
BT and McQueen have announced the opening of one of Europe's most
sophisticated call centres. The new Edinburgh centre uses
state-of-the-art computer telephony integration technology designed to
provide a faster, more efficient response to software users whether it
be a request for information, or ordering new products.
Telephone-based business is worth #10 billion a year in the UK, but
the computer industry has been lagging behind other industries like
banks, in the use of call centres.Calls for McQueen clients from all
over Europe are automaticaly routed to the centre. As each call arrives,
the system automatically recognises country of origin, the software
company and the identity of the caller. The call is then routed to the
relevant operator and all the details are immediately flashed up on a
screen. The operator answers the caller by name -- and in his own
language -- so that caller assumes they are talking directly to the
software company.

our Queen. Today it is rumoured that you have written to the Queen
declaring that the trial will be a sham. Can you explain your anxiety?
Lennox: Indeed yes, I have written to Her Majesty protesting about the
injustice which has characterised these proceedings. Since my son was
cruelly slain at Kirk o'Field in February, a conspiracy has been hatched
to ensure that those responsible will never be brought to answer for
their crimes.
Myths: What evidence do you have of this plot, your Lordship?
Lennox: It should be obvious for all to see. Firstly, those who
actually committed the murder were given time to flee and when it was
eventually decided that Bothwell should answer for his involvement, no
time was given to gather evidence. The party charged with the crime
(Bothwell) instead of being committed to ward as is usual, has been
allowed to go at large and is the chief attendant on Her Majesty.
Myths: There seems to be a great deal of public concern about the
behaviour of the Earl of Bothwell and his influence over the Queen. Do
you believe that the placards and graffiti which have been seen around
Edinburgh asserting his guilt and implicating the Queen are a true
reflection of public feeling over this affair, or simply the work of
cranks?
Lennox: Outrage, I would say, rather than concern is the feeling among
the populous. I sense a widespread desire among ordinary folk for
justice to be done, but a fear that, like my poor son, it will be
strangled. The forces we are seeking to impeach are very powerful.
Myths: We're told by sources close to the Palace that Elizabeth of
England has also written to the Queen suggesting that if this trial is
not conducted with proper dignity Mary would be ''shunned by all princes
and hated by all people.''
Lennox: I understand this to be the case. The integrity of Scotland is
at stake. I'm led to believe that Elizabeth concluded her letter by
saying she wished Mary an honourable burial rather than a sullied life.
Any doubt that Bothwell has a special place in the Queen's favour has
long since disappeared. You'll know, of course, that the Earl of Mar has
been induced to give up the keeping of the castle in favour of Bothwell
but you may not be aware that the Queen has also bestowed on him the
Castle of Blackness, the Inch and the superiority of Leith. He has a
stranglehold on the capital.
Myths: Personally, this must have been a very difficult time for you?
Lennox: In truth, the hardest -- and saddest -- of my life. I know my
son was young and perhaps ill-equipped for the intrigues of court. He
had his faults certainly, but I now believe that almost from his wedding
day two years ago he was a victim of plotting and scheming. His death
was unwarranted. It was a cruel and barbarous act.
Myths: Strong words, your Lordship. Have you any confidence that
tomorrow's proceedings will have a just conclusion?
Lennox: The town is Bothwell's, the soldiers you see around Edinburgh
this afternoon are in Bothwell's pay, the president of the tribunal is
in the Earl's pocket. I've been forbidden to enter the town with more
than six attendants. Judge for yourself the likely outcome.
* April 12 -- Lennox, not surprisingly, failed to appear at the trial.
The Queen warmly waved Bothwell off from Holyrood to his trial. The
Canongate was lined by 4000 of his hired men. At the trial a request for
a delay to gather more evidence was refused, no witnesses appeared, the
Crown lawyers remained silent, and Bothwell was acquitted. Five minutes
later he left the Tollbooth offering to meet in combat anyone who
charged him with the King's murder. There were no takers.

Lindsay Errington looks at the career of Alexander Carse, who rose
from humble beginnings to compete with Turner and Wilkie
ALEXANDER CARSE'S career spans the chasm between the first naive
attempts at Scottish genre by David Allan in the eighteenth century, and
the great upsurge or artistic activity amongst the new masses of
home-bred, home-trained Scottish artists in the first half of the
nineteenth century. His art is a minor, and in many ways a provincial
one, but full nevertheless of interest and delight. Carse, however
hampered by an inadequate training, possessed an original mind and the
good sense to confine himself to the kind of subject-matter he really
understood.
It is said that he was a native of East Lothian, but his date of birth
is unknown -- though one may guess it took place in the 1770s. At some
point he worked as a pupil and assistant to David Allan, who died in
1796. Oldhamstocks Fair might pardonably be confused with a drawing by
Allan. The main body of Carse's earliest work, however, seems to have
consisted of topographical views of country houses.
On December 16, 1801, he was admitted to the Trustees' Academy as a
student, and from 1808 until 1815 he was a regular exhibitor with the
Associated Artists in Edinburgh. Reviews in the Scots Magazine indicate
that his works were well received. In 1812 the critic singled out the
picture now generally regarded as Carse's masterpiece, The Country
Relations. His picture is a most unusual combination of sophistication
of subject and vision but semi-naivety of technique. When compared with
Wilkie's contemporary, and thematically similar picture, The Letter of
Introduction which also confronts town with country, The Country
Relations lags far behind in draughtsmanship and sheer elegance of
execution, but rather surprisingly exhibits sensitivities towards light
effects which are lacking in Wilkie at that time.
Carse's country visitors have doubtless come from a farmhouse with
unplastered ceilings, stone-flagged floors and rudimentary deal tables
and chairs. Despite their astonishment and embarrassment as, dressed in
their homely shawls, they survey the splendid scene before them, Carse's
rendering is not a satire in any way. A genuine feeling of warmth and
good will prevails. The two men beam and grip each other's hands. It is
the women who, separated by divergent fashions, find it harder to make
contact with each other.
Not all Carse's pictures are comedies. His Bible Reading at a Cottage
Door and Grace before Meat are peaceful and grave in their mood, and the
illustration to Thomson's poem Winter represents a hill shepherd lost,
and staggering through the snow drift in which he will shortly perish.
In 1822 Carse embarked on the largest, most elaborate, and most
ambitious project of his life, George IV Landing at Leith, containing
several hundred figures. Two other artists present in Edinburgh to
record the ceremonies of the King's visit were, of course, Turner and
Wilkie -- Carse had placed himself in competition with exalted
contenders.
During the next decade, though active as a painter, Carse fell into
serious financial difficulties, to such a degree that he was compelled
to apply for assistance to the Royal Institution's Trustees of the
Spalding Fund for the relief of decayed and superannuated artists. His
death occurred in February, 1843, only two years after that of Wilkie,
his far more celebrated countryman, and initially his follower.
Lindsay Errington is now with Aberdeen city Art Galleries. Her article
is edited by James Henderson, Assistant Keeper, Scottish National
Portrait Gallery.

AS lazy as an eider, is a saying they use in Orkney. How appropriate
that seems when you see a sand bar covered in resting eider ducks, brown
females and pied males sitting equidistant from each other like
contented curling stones. They have plenty to be content about, because
this is the most numerous sea duck in the world: two million live on the
north west coasts of Europe alone.
Eiders are characteristically Scottish, common off every shore of
Scotland but hardly breeding south of the Farnes. They feed on
crustaceans -- crabs, mussels, big razor shells -- and what they can't
swallow, they crush with those strong roman-nosed bills. What they like
is water between one to three metres deep, so they are rarely seen away
from the coast, never inland. As the records of the North Sea Bird Club
show, even mallard are more common out on the oil rigs.
On still winter days you can see big flocks close in shore, at
Yellowcraig, St Andrews or Tayport. They make a strange crooning which
will always sound, once it has been suggested to you, like Kenneth
Williams in a Carry On film. They nest near to the shore, the biggest
colony being 2000 pairs at the Sands of Forvie. The females protect the
big green eggs by their camouflage and stillness. If they do leave they
cover the eggs with that extraordinary substance, eiderdown, warmer,
more compressible and more resilient than any duvet. The litle brown
chicks are herded in creches by females but the gulls will get half in
their first week. Still their numbers grow, a society at ease, as yet,
with its environment.

Spiky and colourful. Sounds like a punk hairstyle, but, as Lesley
Duncan and photographer Ian Hossack discovered, cacti with these
qualities are admired with a passion
BEST get it over with. Yes, we're dealing with a prickly subject here
-- the annual show of the Glasgow branch of the British Cactus and
Succulent Society. It was held last weekend in the Winter Gardens behind
the People's Palace in Glasgow Green, under the big glass canopy, with
palm trees shading the waterfall, sparrows chirping, and Shirley Bassey
belting out Big Spender.
Cacti are amazing things. They were there, hundreds of them, all spiny
and enigmatic on tables waiting for the judge, Tom Jenkins of
Lincolnshire. Some were, frankly, phallic. Some looked like pumpkins
with spikes that would make sitting on a thistle seem a minor
inconvenience. Others were festooned with flowers in glaring colours of
orange, yellow, crimson, and magenta.
Hamish McKelvie, the pleasant, sandy-haired show secretary and ''zonal
representative'', agreed that growing cacti can be a passion. It is
evidently a hobby widely shared, for there are 108 branches throughout
the country and six branches in Scotland. Members come from all walks of
life, McKelvie said -- doctors, school teachers, joiners, housewives. He
himself is a farm manager. In age, members run the gamut from juniors to
pensioners.
One of the more kenspeckle exhibits not to be overlooked, for example,
was Echinocactus grusonii (everything is labelled in Latin in best
Linnaean tradition). This extraordinary prickly sphere is also known as
Mother-in-Law's Seat -- ''Many a one fancies sitting his mother-in-law
on that,'' cracked a passer-by. Another had the air of a miniature Scots
baronial tower with lurching turrets. It -- should one wish to know --
was Echinocerus rectus spinus.
It didn't take long for the admirers to arrive at the show. The
youngest people to be spotted, apart from a babe in arms, were the two
Armstrong brothers -- Steven (five) and Colin (eight). Their father
Robert, from East Kilbride where he runs a small software company, said
they were here by chance, but revealed that he ''always loved these
plants.'' The boys went home with some ''living pebbles'' to cultivate.
They also admired an Opuntia cactus from the Texas/Arizona area. Perhaps
rightly, in view of the habitat's proximity to California, there's a
definite Mickey Mouse quality about the jaunty specimen.
Judge Tom Jenkins ran his own cacti nursery until recently. An
articulate, bearded man, he was complimentary about Scottish
aficionados. ''They grow superb cacti up here. You're never
disappointed.'' Astonishingly, there were 101 classes for him to judge.
Judges, appointed by the British society, have to attend a course at
least once every five years (most attend it annually) and pass an exam.
It's clear they take their responsibilities seriously.
Mr Jenkins admired a cluster of tall, woolly cacti on one table. The
Oreocereus family comes from Peru, growing in the high Andes. The reason
for the wool is two-fold -- warmth at night and coolness during the day.
One or two are showing little pink buds. ''It's unusual to get them to
flower. The quality of light is better than in the south of the country
and that obviously helps.''
The monsters that dot the background of Western movies are Sajuaro
cacti. They are 120-years-old before they first branch, can grow up to
40ft high, and live from 200 to 300 years. Sadly, no such patriarchal
specimen was on show, only modest-sized juveniles around 20-years-old.
It seems that cacti come exclusively from the Americas, whereas
succulents have a world-wide provenance, though the majority come from
Africa or Madagascar. Succulents, too, can have spikes but those of true
cacti are differentiated by springing from an areole or tuft. There are
some 2000 different varieties and species of cacti, a number dwarfed by
the equivalent 5000 for succulents.
Statistics are probably the last thing on the minds of enthusiasts.
Jess Rolfe of Lanark started by accident. She was 13, off school ill,
and ''absolutely fed up'', when a neighbour gave her a ''couple of wee
cuttings.'' Now her collection of cacti and succulents takes up three
greenhouses.
John Frew, a self-confessed ''interloper'' from the Ayr branch, works
as a configuration controller with Barr &amp; Stroud. He specialises in
Euphorbias, drawn by the fact that they are different and varied. The
eye of a cognoscente is really needed to appreciate these visually
unremarkable green plants.
Euphorbias have highly poisonous sap. One plant from the Cameroon was
used in by-gone days to squeeze into the eyes of suspected witches to
establish guilt or innocence.
It's much more pleasant to contemplate the bright star-shaped blooms
of the Rubutias. One particularly fine specimen filled a huge white dish
with its prickly green rosettes and scarlet flowers. It goes by the name
of Rebutia senilis, a singularly inappropriate handle for a plant of
such vitality.
I caught up, at last, with the doyen of the Glasgow branch, Fred
Swainston, club chairman for 31 years, now club president, and an X-ray
engineer by background. A genial, stout figure in tweeds, he retains his
southern accent, though he's been living in Scotland since 1946. His
interest in cacti dates from 1951 when he bought his first plant for
half a crown at the Kelvin Hall. He's the present owner of the
earlier-mentioned Mother-in-Law's Seat. Impressive as its current
dimensions were, it apparently grows up to 4 feet high by 3 feet in
diameter. Thinking of accidental impalings, I asked if it was poisonous.
''If it had been, I'd be dead by now,'' Mr Swainston chuckled.
I was chuckling too, as I exited from the Winter Gardens, clutching a
pot with a pretty pink succulent like a starfish. No big spender I. It
cost me #2.

THE bright little placards in Marks and Spencer's wine departments
seem full of hope. ''Sunshine,'' they declare, tempting us with bottles
of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo reduced to #2.99. It's a good price for one
of Italy's most perennially popular reds, and there is no doubt about
its sunniness, even if some might think the 1994 vintage to be still a
bit on the young side for immediate drinking.
The point about Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, however, is that on visits to
Italy we all like to drink it fresh. That is what it is designed for,
and the only problem is to find a version of it -- and there are
dauntingly many to choose from -- that continues to taste good as you're
meal progresses. In this respect, M&amp;S seems to have found a good
example, a characteristically peppery but not too abrasive Abruzzo with
nothing ominously tannic about its aftertaste. Though bottled in Trento,
which is a long way north of where the wine is produced, its Adriatic
origins shine through.
No price reduction, however, is offered by M&amp;S on its bottles of
Giordano, another of its crop of 1994 Italians. Being a white, this can
certainly be drunk at once -- indeed, the sooner the better. Like all
good Italian Chardonnays (except those that have gone through a process
of Australianisation) its taste is fairly neutral, with a discrete
fruitiness and a faint hint of almonds.
But being from Piemonte, home of some of Italy's biggest wines, it can
also be expected to have a bit of body, even if its 11.5 alcohol content
implies lightness. It is certainly a wine capable of cutting through
Italian veal or chicken dishes cooked with rich sauces, and it would
equally enhance a portion of shellfish.
Even lower in alcohol content is fizzy Malvasia, of which Raeburn Fine
Wines in Edinburgh stock a brilliant specimen. At only 7% proof, this is
very light indeed, which may make #6.99 seem a high price to pay for so
insubstantial an experience.
But the quality of this dolce frizzanti from Castello di Luzzano near
Piacenza, where it is produced by two dedicated sisters, speaks
strongly. For those who like to end a meal with something delicately
fruity, rather than robust, this lovely sweet sparkler provides the
answer. The dry version of the same wine, at the same price, makes a
similarly good aperitif, but stocks of this, says Zubair Mohamed, the
shop's proprietor, are running low.
More obviously a bargain, though without the same sort of class, are
some of the Sicilian wines that Sainsbury and Safeway have been
promoting recently. Sainsbury's own-label Sicilian white wine blends
Italy's prevalent Trebbiano grape with Sicilian Catarratto to produce an
appetising balance of fruit and acidity, good with food, but equally
good on its own. Bottled by Settesoli and priced #2.85, this has enough
expertise about it to suggest that it is something more than just a
non-vintage nonentity.

In her latest movie, Nicole Kidman plays a viperish TV host. As she
explains to Phil Penfold, it was a part to die for
HAVING made her film debut in Australia aged 18, a young girl decided
that, like her idol Katherine Hepburn, she'd like to be an actress. Fast
forward another 14 years, and here's Nicole Kidman, one of the most
glamorous performers in the movies, married to screen idol Tom Cruise,
mother of two children and . . . well, one of the nicest people that you
could ever wish to meet. Not that Ms Kidman lets you in TOO close.
''Tom and I try to live our lives separated from the goldfish bowl
that surrounds us,'' she says quietly, ''but even so, you do get asked
the most awful personal questions that nobody should dare ask you . . .
even at private dinner parties.
''But we both decided that we have lives to live, and that we're going
to do what we want, and nobody's going to stop us. If we go to the mall
to shop, and yes, I DO go to the shops, and there are photographers
there -- so be it!''
She pauses, thinks and says: ''You know, motherhood and two children
helps put everything into perspective, gives you a new emotional
depth.''
But let's flip back to Nicole Kidman as a little girl. She smiles as
she recalls: ''I wanted to be a ballet dancer when I was three, and I
did it for, oh, about six years. And then, when I was about 12 I found a
mime company working in the streets of Sydney where we lived.
''It was through them that I became interested in acting, and I joined
my first rep theatre at the age of 16. It became my entire life. ''I
wasn't going to marry. I wasn't going to have kids. I was just going to
act . . . I was going to make a movie with Jane Campion, who made the
smash hit The Piano, when she cast me in it, but there was a bit of a
conflict with school, and I couldn't. I was really disappointed. Jane
wrote me a note which said 'Protect your talent'.''
She did, and it was recognised in an Australian move called Dead Calm
that became an unexpected world box-office success. So next comes ''the
obligatory trip to America and Hollywood. There was only one thing I
wanted to do while I was there, and that was to catch Gus Van Sant's
Drugstore Cowboy. It was his breakthrough picture and I heard it was
really cutting-edge. I've wanted to work with him since then because he
has such an original voice.''
Her wish has been granted. Kidman's latest film on release is To Die
For, directed by Van Sant, in which she plays a viperish TV host. ''I
read the script, and it was both black and funny, and it also had
something to say. I ended up calling Gus and saying, 'I can play this
part!', but he claims that I said I was 'destined' to do it.'' She says,
with a smile: ''I don't honestly remember going that far. I remember
that someone said that I had three things against me -- I wasn't
American, I wasn't supposed to be funny, and the character didn't look
like me. I thought, 'This one you've GOT to work for, girl'.
''And when I got it I spent three solid days, 24 hours a day, watching
all sorts of TV. It nearly drove Tom mad. I saw chat shows, TV
announcers, weathergirls, the lot, in order to get that hypnotic feel
that TV gives you. My heart is actually with my character Susan. You
assume that the audience isn't going to like her, so I had to find a
reason to like her . . . I now understand her and every action she
takes. And why. When you become an actor there has to be a reason for
it. I'm dedicated to the art of acting, and in To Die For my character
is dedicated to the stardom of television. I feel privileged to be among
the two per cent of actors in this world who are actually working, so
fame isn't too restricting. For me, acting is about being versatile and
seeing who I am through my roles. Today I just want to get better and
better and increase the range of roles I can do, so that the offers get
better and better as well.''
Her long red hair and pale skin give her an almost pre-Raphaelite look
. . . even in the pink Gianni Versace suit she's wearing as ''an ode''
to her character. A level-headed and candid woman with an easy sense of
humour, she laughs at the notion that any Team Kidman gets together to
pick her parts. ''You have to make the decisions yourself. You're the
actor. You're the person who has to do it, and the only person you can
blame is yourself if it goes wrong. In fact, when my agency sent over
the To Die For script, it wasn't with the highest recommendation -- they
said it was very dark and that I probably wasn't going to be interested.
And there was some feeling that, after having done Malice, in which I
played a woman who menaces her husband, I shouldn't venture into that
territory again -- or people would talk! I told them that Tom was still
alive, so no-one should worry.''
She's taking time off to talk in a break from filming Portrait of a
Lady, the Henry James novella now being filmed by -- at last -- Jane
Campion.
Does Hollywood tend to pigeonhole attractive women -- especially one
who ends up marrying Tom Cruise?
''Easily and inaccurately,'' she says. ''I find it a lot when I go up
for jobs. People's perceptions of me changed because of my private life.
They say, 'Isn't she the girl that's married to Tom Cruise? Isn't she
acting because she just wanted to be famous?'. You're judged by whatever
information people have picked up on you.
''Before you 'arrive' you really don't know what it's going to be
like. I was probably naive about what the effects were going to be. I
thought we'd just get married and I'd just continue on as a young actor.
But then Far and Away (the big-budget costume epic from Ron Howard) came
up and we jumped in. Probably that was the wrong decision. It didn't
work out as well as we had planned. But I'd certainly work with Tom
again -- it's always something we can do.
''My own taste in movies? Ones where you laugh -- and you know that
you shouldn't be laughing!''
Having moved recently from Los Angeles to London ''to try to live a
more sane existence'' Kidman hopes that her US success in To Die For (it
opens in the UK next month) will make her eligible for the sort of parts
she wants. ''I'm happy when people say, 'I didn't know she could do
that'. I would love to have started from that point when I arrived in
Hollywood, but it's impossible.
''Now? I'm just starting to have fun.''

TOP spot this week goes to the vagrant first-year male Eye-browed
thrush seen in the Tayside village of Auchmithie near Arbroath (May
28th). The peaceful village had its quietness broken late on Sunday by
the appearance of this bird closely followed by several hundred birders.
The central Siberian species remained in the area until Wednesday (31st)
but has not been seen since. Other highlights include a Rustic Bunting,
Spotted Crake, Ruddy Shelduck and both Red-backed and Wood-chat Shrikes.
Reports are listed in their approximate order of rarity or interest of
the species, giving dates seen.
Unfortunately no guarantees can be given that the birds will be
present at this time.
REGIONAL REPORTS
Tayside -- An Eye-browed Thrush at Auchmithie remained for several
days showing well until 31st, also a Drake Kind Eider seen off
Carnoustie and seven little gulls were seen near Dundee (4th).
Grampian -- Both the long-staying Forsters Tern and King Eider could
still be seen on the Ythan Estuary (4th). Nearby, a Garganey and Wood
Sanpiper were seen near Lossiemuth and a single Ruddy Shelduck was at
the RSPB Loch of Strathbeg reserve (3rd).
Shetland -- The collection of migrants on the Isles remained this week
and included an Icterine Warbler, Marsh Warbler and up to five Common
Rosefinches seen on Fair Isle. The two Drake King Eiders were still
present at Tresta Voe and on Fetlar three Common Rosefinches were seen
along with two Red-necked Phalaropes (3rd). The Black-browed Albatross
remains on Unst (4th).
Orkney -- A singing male Rustic Bunting was recorded on North
Ronaldsay (2nd). A male Red-backed Skrike was present at Aberlady Bay.
Lothian -- Several Lesser Whitethroats were in the area (3rd). An
unidentified Flamingo species of unkown origin was seen at Musselburgh
at low tide (3rd). A Wood-chat Shrike in the Borders area was reported
(1st) but has not been seen again.
Highland -- A Spotted Crake was heard calling at the RSPB Inchmarshes
reserve where a female Marsh Harrier was also recorded (2nd).
Strathclyde -- A Hobby was seen hunting near Irvine beach park before
flying off. Up to six pairs of Ruddy Ducks were also recorded in
Strathclyde from several lochs in the North East of Glasgow (2nd).
Dumfries and Galloway -- A Hobby was also recorded over the RSPB Wood
of Cree reserve with a Marsh Harrier seen at Loch Ken (2nd).

Bruce Sandison
begins an occasional series on
outdoor hobbies
with the naked
truth about
naturism
WHEN the sun shines I grin and bare it. Home or abroad, on
Mediterranean strand or by remote Highland stream, whenever and wherever
possible, I go for an all-over seamless tan. Swimming costumes defeat
the object of this exercise and do little other than ding cash
registers. Check out the price of designer leisure gear if you don't
agree -- it can cost an arm and a leg these days to blanket a bare
midriff, male or female.
Naturism is natural. The most natural state under the sun. Try it.
Dare to go bare. Feel God's sun warm your body, touch your soul, His
gentle wind whisper round your heart. Experience the joy of swimming
naked. Discover the sense of well-being that naturism brings -- far
beyond the boundary of class, race, religion, or social status -- amidst
unprententious, decent, caring people.
Naturists are represented in Britain by the Central Council for
British Naturism (CCBN), the co-ordinating body for 117 sub clubs and
25,000 individual members. Their magazine, British Naturism, keeps
members up-to-date and is packed with detail about activities at home
and abroad. CCBN fight the naturist corner in regard to the use of
beaches, and deal with authority at all levels on matters affecting the
movement.
There are five groups in Scotland: Scottish Outdoor Club, Loch Lomond;
forth Naturists, Edinburgh; Highland Sun, Moray Firth; Sunnybroom,
Aberdeen; and the Tay Valley Club in Perth. They offer a courteous
welcome to couples and families and any doubts you might have had will
quickly disappear. Your only concern will be regret for not having taken
the plunge sooner.
Which you may do during winter months as well. Most clubs organise
swimming sessions at local pools and this is a good first place to stick
a toe into the naturist experience. The Scottish Outdoor Club use the
Western Baths in Glasgow, Forth Naturists, the swimming-pool in
Haddington. Speak to the club secretaries and dive in. You will not
regret it.
There are also a number of Scottish beaches where naked swimming and
sunbathing is regularly practised and tolerated: Lower Largo, in Fife;
the south beach at Saltcoats; the beach at Kildonan on the Island of
Arran. But apart from these recognised locations, there are many more,
particularly in the far north, where the only complaint you are likely
to hear is from dissident sheep and disgruntled seagulls.
Walk out to the ''Singing Sands'' by Gortenfern near Acharacle: five,
secluded, white-sand beaches looking west over the Sound of Arisaig to
the islands of Muck, Eigg and Rum; Peanmeanach on the Ardnish Peninsula,
a three-mile tramp south from the A830, starting a step west from from
Lochailort; remote, magnificent coves between Oldshoremore and Cape
Wrath in Sutherland.
Naturism is not only about sunning and splashing. We are an active
bunch, much given to exercise; mini-tennis, volleyball, anything that
takes the fancy. Which, for me, includes fly-fishing for wild brown
trout. Not having to lump along waders is a great advantage. I strip off
and stamp in, safely reaching the parts more encumbered anglers never
see.
Consideration for others is an integral part of naturism. Not everyone
shares our views. We respect the rights of others in their enjoyment of
the great outdoors. In return, we expect tolerance, which, sadly, is
frequently most obvious by its absence. I can't understand why taking
off one's clothes should be seen as offensive. This is not so in most
European countries, including Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France, and,
increasingly, in Spain.
A society which denies its people the right to lie on a beach naked if
they wish to do so, is a sick, frightened society. Join any group of
naturists and within a micro-second you will understand what I mean.
And, by so doing, you will become a better and more fulfilled person.
Now, if you will excuse me, the sun is shining and the grass needs
cutting, naturally.
Naturism is uncomplicated, the least expensive of all outdoor
activities. Simply take off all your clothes and lie in the sun. For

abroad, write to: The Central Council for British Naturism, Assurance

Kenneth Wright finds that a
comedy/drama focusing on a lottery
winner fails to hit the jackpot
THE haunting line -- If there were dreams to sell / What would you
buy? -- from the Victorian poet Thomas Lovell Beddoes is the signature
and scenario of every stuck-at-home Saturday night in Britain since the
national lottery came on stream; Couch Potato and his misfortunate wife
Sweet Potato, like so many million other dreamers, mentally compose
their resignation letters around 8.00pm and mentally tear them up around
8.15 when the numbers turn out wrong. But what if they were right? What
dreams would you buy?
That's the subject of Andrew Bergman's lottery comedy-drama It Could
Happen To You (rental, cert PG), a confused but mildly likable twist on
that old sermon, historically popular among rich folks when they're
talking to the poor folks, upon the text that Money Can't Buy You
Happiness. Is that right? Couch Potato tends to agree with Zsa Zsa Gabor
on this one: if money can't buy you happiness, it only means you just
don't know where to shop. Or rather, you bought the wrong dreams.
Here's the set-up: Big Apple copper Nicolas Cage, the nicest of New
York's finest -- he runs a street baseball team, carries blind men
across the road, delivers babies on buses -- is short for tip money one
day when he's buying coffee for himself and his beat partner. So he
tells the waitress -- Bridget Fonda, who got bankrupted on her
Mastercard that very morning -- that next day he'll come by and give her
either a tip or a half share in the winnings of his lottery ticket. And
what do you know . . . he lucks in for $4 million.
Despite the misgivings of his social-climbing Wife From Hell, Rosie
Perez, he comes good on his promise -- but then Rosie gets second
thoughts, and the middle third of the movie turns into a rewrite of The
Monkey's Paw as Rosie files for divorce and custody of the dough.
They've bought different dreams: Cage wants to give lots of it away and
carry on being a cop and living in Queens -- only with more money -- but
his wife wants to be a celebrity and move into Oprah Winfreyland, thus
driving Cage into the arms of the waitress. Woe, woe, and thrice woe . .
.
How this all gets resolved is unpredictable, but narratively not
entirely satisfactory: the script wants to have everything both ways --
and gets it, but only at the expense of credibility and sympathy. Early
hints of blue-collar subversiveness are abandoned, as is the promise of
a hint of the supernatural (there's a significant character whose name
is Angel), and Couch Potato was left with the feeling that the script
was softened up at the last minute to make a ruthlessly feelgood ending.
A failure, then, but quite a nice little movie to watch -- if nice is
all you want from your dreams.
Bridget Fonda pops up again in Alan Parker's The Road to Wellville
(rental, cert 18), another waste of a good idea -- to wit, a
dramatisation of T Coraghessan Boyle's sardonically allegorical novel
about the American yearning for pure health and extended life, as
represented by the turn-of-the-century sanatorium run by Dr John Harvey
Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins, hamming it up like mad in an unlikely set of
false teeth), inventor of cornflakes and quack propagandist for empty
bowels and unsullied genitalia.
Boyle's satire on health craziness gets lost down the lavvy with much
else as a strong supporting cast (including John Cusack, Matthew
Broderick, and Dana Carvey) play out too many droll but disconnected
storylines in a film without a real story at its heart. The prominence
of certain other and less glamorous organs of the body is no great
compensation.

THE trumpeter Doc Cheatham will celebrate his 90th birthday on
Tuesday, a notable event in itself for any jazz musician when you
remember how many burned themselves out when they had not reached half
Cheatham's age.
But it is even more notable because Doc Cheatham is not simply sitting
at home in New York clipping coupons and watching television and
reminiscing for jazz historians. Doc is still out there playing and
singing in that unique style of his, a soloist of the highest rank, up
there now alongside the other greats of his generation who have gone.
Yet for almost half his playing career -- and that has lasted more
than 70 years now -- Cheatham was a shadowy figure hidden away in the
discographies as a name in the trumpet sections of several of the major
black big bands. You see, Cheatham was a lead player, and a good one.
He spent a year with McKinney's Cotton Pickers and then six years with
Cab Calloway doing the hard work in the ensembles while others were
given the solos.
It didn't bother him then and, even now, when he looks back he simply
accepts it as part of his lot in life.
What it meant, of course, was that Cheatham was known mainly among
musicians. His reputation was a closely-kept secret until some time in
the fifties he began to emerge as a soloist with the Wilbur De Paris
Band which held a long residency at Jimmy Ryan's on New York's 52nd
Street.
Even then the Doc was overshadowed by the group's main trumpet soloist
Sidney De Paris, the leader's brother and an exceptional player.
And so Doc gravitated away from jazz and into the Latin bands of Perez
Prado and Machito and Ricardo Rey. For close on a decade he was hidden
there, still playing lead and still kept from the spotlight which would
not hit him until some time in the sixties.
Since then Cheatham was been a regular on the festival circuit, a
reasonably prolific recording artist, and a crowd puller at New York's
Sweet Basil, where he has played the Sunday brunch gig for more than 15
years.
It's difficult to believe that when he was a young man Cheatham played
in groups which backed the blues-singing Smith girls, Bessie, Clara, and
Mamie. He saw another Smith, too, Joe Smith, the trumpeter who was with
Fletcher Henderson and who became his earliest inspiration.
Another who listened to Smith, who died young, was the Ellingtonian
trumpeter Shorty Baker. Inside the last few months a reissue has
surfaced of a recording Cheatham and Baker made together in l961.
Incredibly it was the first album issued under Doc's name -- Shorty and
Doc it was called, and that title survives on the CD.
This is vintage Cheatham (and Baker) and anyone who needs an
introduction to the man and his music should buy it immediately.
It was never issued here in its original form and has been
unobtainable for some 30years. I came across it in New York in February
and it has now found its way over to Britain. It is as good as my memory
told me it was.
And Cheatham remains an icon for all of us who revere the lyrical
trumpet style he has shared with Baker and Joe Thomas and Bill Coeman
and others over the years.
Cheatham is a lone survivor, a man who saw Freddy Keppard and King
Oliver in Chicago, who played with the greatest of blues singers, who
once depped for Louis Armstrong at the Vendome Theatre in Chicago in the
early twenties and still recalls that night.
He laughs: ''Erskine Tate was featuring Louis on a song called Poor
Little Rich Girl and the audience were chanting his name and hollering
for him and there I was standing there and the cheering just died away
and I wished a hole would open in the floor and I could disappear.
''But I got through the song OK and I was asked back as a sub for
Louis a few times after that, so it was fine.''
It's been a little more than fine over the past 35 years. Cheatham has
recorded frequently -- and almost always in good company. THree years
ago Columbia issued a session by his own quartet -- Chuck Folds, piano,
Bucky Calabrese, bass, and Jackie Williams, drums -- in their Legends of
Jazz series.
It's the men he works with at Sweet Basil and the repertoire contains
some of the staples of his programme including his sign-off song, I
Guess I'll Get the Papers and Go Home.
Armstrong recorded it but now it belongs to Doc and not too many
people have been able to hijack a number from Louis and make it all
their own.
Doc has come out into the open and done just that. Maybe that sums up
what has happened in the years since his ''discovery''!
Tomorrow he will be at Sweet Basil as usual and I just hope he wil
still be around for my next visit to New York. Happy birthday, Doc . . .

Cry freedom from the heart
The streets are squalid, and the crime rate is horrendous. It has
a population approaching that of Scotland, and most live in
matchbox houses. But in South Africa's new rainbow republic,
the people of Soweto are full of warmth and compassion,
striving for the better future that must surely come. Gavin Bell
and photographer James Galloway report
IN THE heart of darkness, rays of light come from unexpected
directions. It is a hot night in Soweto, the teeming black township near
Johannesburg, and violence is looming. On a dusty street, a mob of Zulu
supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party is advancing towards a crowd
flaunting the emblems of the rival African National Congress. Moonlight
glints on spears, warclubs, and a fearsome array of home-made weapons.
In the middle, a squad of riot police waits nervously by armoured
vehicles. The safety catches on their automatic rifles are off. It is a
tense stand-off, the air is charged with hatred and fear, and anything
can happen.
What happens is this: a youth in the front of the ANC ranks begins to
break-dance. Moving to a rhythm all his own, his lithe frame dances back
and forward with comical, jerky movements. It is a totally unexpected
gesture, and it has an amazing effect. People smile, somebody laughs,
and the tension evaporates. Within half an hour everybody has gone home.
The incident occurred at the height of political violence in South
Africa shortly before its first multi-racial elections, but it
illustrated an enduring feature of Soweto -- it is full of surprises,
repeatedly confounding its stereotyped image.
It is vast, much of it is squalid, and all of it is dangerous. Its
crime statistics make Los Angeles look like a kindergarten. But it is
also full of warmth and compassion, of good-natured people striving
against enormous odds for decent lives for themselves and their
children. It is a place where a man may be murdered for a few pence, and
his children will be adopted immediately by relatives in the extended
family system and brought up as their own.
Nobody knows for sure how many people live in the vast community
sprawling over 30 square miles of low hills south of Johannesburg.
Soweto is a moving feast in population terms, fluctuating with the
movement of squatters and migrant workers from rural areas. It is
generally reckoned to house -- in the loosest sense of the word -- more
than four million people at any given time, which is not far short of
the population of Scotland.
Most live in tiny, two-roomed matchbox houses on streets without
paving, sewers, or adequate lighting. But there are curtains in the
windows, vases of flowers in the living rooms, and vegetables growing in
postage-stamp gardens.
There are hardly any windows in the schools, and there are never
enough desks or textbooks, but the children arrive neatly scrubbed and
as well dressed in threadbare uniforms as humanly possible.
Apart from an impressive soccer stadium there are few modern sports
facilities, yet Soweto regularly produces world-class boxers and
long-distance runners. You see them pounding the streets at night, lone
figures etched against a skyline of tin shacks and smoke from cooking
fires, local heroes in tattered sweatsuits.
Thousands of squatters survive in huts of corrugated iron and
cardboard, but the Diepkloof district has brick-built mansions worthy of
the stockbroker belt of the Home Counties. Almost half of the population
is unemployed, with no realistic prospects of steady jobs, but Soweto
has a BMW dealership with plenty of customers.
On the top of a hill at the eastern end of town lies the huge complex
of Baragwanath Hospital. With 3,200 beds, it is the biggest medical
institution in the southern hemisphere. At weekends, its casualty wards
are like a war zone. Whites complain about rising violent crime in their
neighbourhoods, but they don't know the half of it.
In South Africa, a murder is committed every 29 minutes. A woman is
raped every 16 minutes, armed robberies occur every five minutes, and
assaults and burglaries are reported every three minutes. Last weekend,
the police reported 42 murders, 34 rapes, and 477 burglaries in greater
Johannesburg -- and these are only the ones they know about.
The majority of criminals and their victims in South Africa are black,
most of the offences take place in townships like Soweto, and nobody has
the least idea how many cases are never reported to the police.
Part of the problem is the deprivation and hopelessness of millions of
people trapped by poverty; another is a singularly inept police force
which was trained to persecute black people, not to protect them.
Combating crime in the townships was never a priority.
The installation of a multi-racial government under Nelson Mandela has
yet to bring tangible economic benefits to Soweto, but life is improving
slowly in ways difficult to measure. There is a new dignity, a
self-respect, and a mood of optimism. Township life is still tough, but
there is a sense that one day it will be better.
Isaac Mogase, president of the Soweto Civic Association, is
enthusiastic about changes he has helped to bring about since the demise
of apartheid. ''You remember how we used to hate the police?'' he asks.
''Well, now we have set up community policing forums so we can meet the
police and discuss how we can help them to stop crime. Last week we had
a community day, and the police took children for rides in their
armoured cars. How about that?''
Another scheme which will bring more immediate benefits is the
impending transfer of thousands of rented homes from council to private
ownership, free of charge, along with the land on which they lie.
Isaac is now striving to convert a climate of defiance in Soweto to
one of co-operation. As an ANC activist, he once led residents in a rent
and rates boycott; now he is urging them to pay for essential municipal
services.
''Last month we had a meeting in the soccer stadium, and it was very
positive. About 50,000 people turned up, and they cheered us when we
said we must pay for cleaning our streets and educating our children.
The message that we have to turn from resistance to development is
getting through.''
They have a name for this movement in Soweto. It is masakhane, which
roughly translated means ''let's build together''.
Isaac is philosophical about the slow pace of change. ''Apartheid is
gone, that is very important to us. Now there are great expectations
that our government will deliver what we need in housing and jobs, and
of course some people are impatient. But I think most of us understand
that it will take time, and that already we have come a long way.''
Soweto has a long way to go, it is still plagued by terrible violence
and deprivation, but for the first time there is a glimmer of hope. It
is no longer the heart of darkness.

Pete Dexter dislikes adjectives, despairs at the dying craft of
journalism, and is reluctant to talk about the night his fridge was
stabbed, as Julia Langdon discovers
INSTINCT suggests that we play it cool and leave the small matter of
killing the fridge till last. It is something, according to information
received, about which Pete Dexter doesn't like to talk. So we start off
discussing words. Or adjectives, to be more precise. Safer ground for an
author.
Someone close to him once said that Pete Dexter ''never met an
adjective he could get close to''. And there must be truth in that
remark for, in his novels, they are conspicuous by their absence.
''I never have liked them,'' he admits. ''It just comes from a basic
notion of the way I think things should be. There is no reason and no
need to embellish a story, to make it more complex than it already is.''
Instead Dexter relies on the strength of his sentences. Call him
old-fashioned, he says, but he likes them to have a start and a finish.
They ought to be as close to accurate as you can make them because that
way you ''eliminate any misunderstandings''.
''Even if you put 10,000 sentences that are very clear together in a
book you are still opening yourself up to 10,000 interpretations. All
you can do is present yourself as straightforward as you can,'' he
explains.
The first thing you notice about Pete Dexter is his hair. It's as
black as the devil's heart. So too, are his novels, bleak and sparse,
and wonderfully precise. He is one of America's finest fiction writers.
This is not open to argument. His stories are about men. Tough men.
Tough American men. The psychology of tough American men. He is a kind
of Hemingway.
Paris Trout was his third book, but the one which first brought him to
the (British) public's attention. It also earned him America's top
literary prize, the National Book Award in 1988. Trout is a racist
shopkeeper in a tiny Georgia town. It is not the fact that he kills in
cold blood a 14-year-old black child which is so chilling; it is the
fact that he sees nothing wrong in the commission of the crime. It is
within the twisted boundary of his own moral code.
Dexter's other novels, Deadwood, Brotherly Love, and God's Pocket, are
similarly concerned with the dark side to human nature. He writes about
crime and the mysteries which surround it, but he is not -- and has no
notion to be considered -- a crime writer. Indeed, in Brotherly Love, he
takes the brave step of giving away the ending on the very first page.
He did so in order to ensure that the novel would not be regarded as a
mystery.
''A lot of people didn't like that. The book didn't sell well at all.
But it felt right to me. It was all about being honest about your
intentions,'' he said.
His latest book, The Paperboy, is set in Florida in the late sixties
and touches on a subject -- journalism -- which is close to his heart.
Dexter was a newspaperman with the Philadelphia Daily News for many
years. There he built up a reputation for being something of a fearless
columnist, using his position to attack any subject with which he
disagreed. He once gatecrashed a meeting of a local pressure group
called Wages for Lesbians. When the organisers subsequently attacked the
column he produced, challenging his estimate of the number of women who
attended (he said 35; they said 50), he wrote: ''I counted 35. I don't
know where 15 missing heads would be at a lesbian meeting.''
On another occassion, he was beaten half to death in a bar brawl by a
gang of thugs who had taken exception to a piece he'd written about the
local drugs problem. The experience, if nothing else, persuaded him to
sign the pledge. Until then he'd been a hard drinker (though not a
problem drinker) but, for some reason, psychological or metabolical, the
beating served to make alcohol taste bad.
The Paperboy is an extraordinarily powerful novel, shocking and
downbeat in the extreme. It opens with the murder of a county sheriff, a
Paris Trout figure who ''even by Moat County standards, killed an
inappropriate number of negroes in the line of duty''. A local man,
Hillary Van Wetter, is tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for the
crime. He comes from a violent family of backwoodsmen -- like extras
from Deliverance.
As Van Wetter's execution date nears, an unlikely pair of
investigative journalists (Ward James, a reclusive, obsessive man
concerned only with the truth, and Yardley Acheman, a ruthlessly
ambitious opportunist who seldom lets the facts get in the way of a good
story) are persuaded to re-examine the evidence. The ensuing story,
which leads to an explosive, devastating climax, digs deep into the
darkest corners of the American male psyche and, en route, into the
dubious ethics of journalism. At the heart of the novel is Ward James's
relationship with his newspaper-publisher father and his younger, more
impressionable brother. In the end, says Dexter in the final line,
''there are no intact men''.
Ward James's obsessive nature is, according to Dexter, a prerequisite
for his job. To be a really good investigative reporter you've got to
be, he says.
''The person who is not obsessive is going to get tired and he'll give
up. Anyone can do the easy stuff, but the good ones are the guys with
flaws in their character. They are people who love journalism more than
they love anything else,'' he said.
The author set the book in 1969 Florida because it was a place and a
time which was exciting for journalism. Places like St Petersburg and
Miami boasted very good newspapers and yet, in the southern half of the
state, you had a rural wilderness which was backward and relatively
untamed. The meeting of the two cultures led to some great journalism.
But Dexter's opinion on American newspapermen today is less than
flattering. Woodward and Bernstein, who inspired a generation of college
courses, had a lot to answer for, it seems.
''Nowadays everyone has been to journalism school. I don't know what
they teach them, but it doesn't seem to be very much. So much of the job
is common sense. You can't teach someone how to write a story. In the
end it either makes sense or it doesn't.
''There's not a city left in America with a good press. Newspapers
have lost that idiocyncratic touch that they used to have. These young
journalists nowadays don't seem to go out there and meet people. They
don't go to bars any more, so they don't hear things. They don't form
opinions and get information. Somewhere along the line journalists
decided that they were a different class of people and they isolated
themselves,'' he explains.
And so finally we broach the subject of the fridge. Dexter smiles at
the memory. ''Well,'' he recalls, ''I was sitting in a bar in
Philadelphia and this guy -- a huge man, must have weighed 350 lbs, and
terrifying to look at -- sat down and asked if he could buy me a drink.
''It turned out that he owned an apartment which I'd rented years
before. I thought he was going to hit me for unpaid rent or for the mess
I'd left the place in. I reckoned we were going to war and I was going
to lose the war. But he said that these things didn't matter. What he
had always wanted to know was why I'd stabbed the refrigerator.
''I shook my head and replied: 'I don't remember much about the fight
but I know the refrigerator started it.''' There are no intact men.
