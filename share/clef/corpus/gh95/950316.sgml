Rennie McOwan visits an island with historical interest, numerous
surprises and fascinating folklore.
SOME places in the world are so strategically important that it seems
everyone wants to get their hands on them. Rathlin Island, sited in the
narrow seas between Northern Ireland and Scotland, is a quiet place
nowadays.
The waves crash against tall cliffs and cover many wrecks of ships
lost over the centuries. The seabirds cry and whirl in such profusion
and variety that Rathlin has a bird reserve of international status.
The islanders fish for lobsters and care for their small farms, tucked
away in sheltered sections, yet the fields and rocks once rang to the
war slogans of the Norsemen, the expansionist MacDonalds and Campbells
and the brutal raiders of Francis Drake and the Earl of Essex.
Rathlin has timeless relics like the stones and burial mounds of
ancient peoples and modern remains such as installations for Marconi's
famous radio experiments.
Here, too, the Celtic god of the sea, Manannan Mac Lir, whose children
were turned into swans, had a base and sped over the waves in his
chariot. He was the son of a sea god, Lir, whose fame spread to other
cultures and who may have given Shakespeare the idea for King Lear.
Manannan Mac Lir had a sister called Fionnuala of the White Shoulders,
from whom our modern Scottish name Fiona may have its root.
Manannan Mac Lir may have given his name to Clackmannan district in
central Scotland because the sea once washed against the Ochils and he
was worshipped there until the incoming faith of Christianity took over.
Rathlin people strongly argue that the famous cave where the fugitive
King Robert the Bruce saw the spider does not lie on the island of
Arran, as Scots claim, but on Rathlin.
Some sources do show Bruce on Rathlin for a time and it is very
probable that he hid in a number of caves. I tried on more than one
occasion to get into Bruce's Cave but failed. It is a sea cave, well
tucked away under the cliffs, and huge breakers prevented us getting to
the entrance. It would be a good refuge because it is possible to hide
at the back of it.
Rathlin is only six miles off the coast of County Antrim and was
claimed as a Scottish island until the time of James VI. A daily ferry
for foot passengers runs from the pleasant and historic seaside town of
Ballycastle. The coast of Kintyre is only 14 miles away and Islay, Arran
and the Ayrshire coast can easily be seen.
Because it dominated the key sea route between Ireland and Scotland,
known both as the North Channel and the Straits of Moyle, nearly
everyone bent on conquest wanted to possess Rathlin.
The ancient Greeks, Romans and Venetians had it on their maps and it
was also a haven for pirates and smugglers. Queen Elizabeth of England
also coveted it as part of her bid to colonise Ireland.
Scotland's Clan Donald, which had spread harmoniously to Northern
Ireland through marriage, also lived on Rathlin and was an indelible
part of the history of Antrim.
The great mainland castle of Dunluce became a power base for the Earls
of Antrim who sprang from the MacDonalds. James VI may have provided the
charter that increased the prestige of the Ballycastle Ould Lamas Fair,
which is thronged by locals and tourists on the last Monday and Tuesday
of August.
Rathlin people also claim that the famous Corrievreckan whirlpool does
not lie off the island of Jura, in Argyll, but off the coast of Rathlin
in an area where tides clash known as Slough na Morra,
the-swallow-of-the-sea.
Island-going can be great fun and Rathlin is a gem for the discerning
visitor, the person who likes quiet strolling, poking around historical
remains, watching the birds and is sensitive to the farming needs of the
islanders. The island is shaped like an inverted L, with one arm four
miles long and the other three.
Its long, flat shape and soaring cliffs with the white fringe of the
restless sea at their foot can be clearly seen from the Antrim coast.
The colours are often glorious, blue, turquoise, aquamarine, emerald,
white.
Cars cannot be taken over, and carefully controlled tourism is being
built up, with a guest house, pub, restaurant and camping. The 30
families who live on the island are friendly.
Stone Age axe heads of porcellanite, identified as being made on
Rathlin, have been found in Scotland and elsewhere in Britain, and some
were taken by traders far into Asia Minor. The ''quarry'' can still be
seen and some modern islanders continue to use flint stones to gut fish.
The monks of the Celtic Church came here, including St Columba.
Modern relics include cement blocks seen near the east lighthouse, the
remains of a wireless mast. Marconi, the inventor of the wireless,
established a link between Rathlin and Ballycastle, and in 1898 his
assistant, John Kemp, completed the task.
Some memories are grisly. During the 17th-century Scottish Wars of the
Covenant, a force of Campbells landed on Rathlin and massacred the
outnumbered MacDonald settlers. Their womenfolk watched the slaughter
from a hill called Cnoc na Screeding, the hill-of-screaming.
But the worst ethnic cleansing was done by the men of the Earl of
Essex and Francis Drake. The Rathlin garrison of Scots and Irish
surrendered under honourable terms and were then butchered. The island
was beaten from end to end in the manner of a grouse drive and boats
worked their way along the foot of the cliffs and nearly every man,
woman and child was killed.
Lengthy and protracted law suits were carried out over the ownership
of Rathlin -- the name means a place set in the race of the sea -- but
finally James VI ruled after the Union of the Crowns in 1603 that it
should be Irish and it has stayed that way ever since.
One of the (rejected) arguments put forward was that as St Patrick had
reputedly banned all the snakes from Ireland and Rathlin had none, it
was clearly Irish. However, lawyers pointed out that several Scottish
islands did not have adders.
It was a debate with long roots. Some arguments went back to the
ancient kingdom of Dalriada in Northern Ireland, which spread to the
western seaboard of Scotland, and whether the inhabitants on the
Scottish mainland could owe military service to Irish kings. The
sixth-century verdict was that they did, but King James VI was not
convinced.
Rathlin is a place to browse, to sense the complex layers of history,
to appreciate the often savage beauty of the seas and cliffs, to watch
the razorbills, guillemots, Manx shearwaters, fulmars, kittiwakes and
(in season) puffins, to examine the old stones of the past races, to
wander.
It is easy -- seas permitting -- to go over for the day or to stay
overnight, but go quietly and with care and you will have an
unforgettable experience.

ALTHOUGH the best-known golf courses in Northern Ireland are Royal
County Down and Royal Portrush, there is plenty of choice for golfers in
the rest of the country. In Co Antrim there are 18 18-hole courses
including eight in Belfast. Co Down has 19 courses and you can choose
from five in Co Londonderry and Co Tyrone. Co Fermanagh has two 18-hole
courses and Co Armagh has six.
Many Scots golfers are quite familiar with Northern Ireland's courses
and Ballycastle, Portstewart, Castlerock or Donaghadee resound clear
alongside Malone, Lurgan and Shandon in clubhouse banter.
The province's association with golf and golf championships has been
well established over the years and there is a growing body of support
for the return of The Open championship to these shores.
In 1993 the British Amateur Open Championship was played at Royal
Portrush Golf Club proving its links are of a quality that is demanded
for such a prestigious event. And the Irish PGA Seniors tournament took
place in August at the Malone Golf Club in Belfast. Northern Ireland is
increasingly becoming a serious consideration when choosing venues for
major tournaments.
For the holiday golfer or golf party, keen on a good test amid
sociable, friendly people the country has everything to offer.
The coast of Down is a golfers paradise and home to one of the world's
top 10 courses at Royal County Down, Newcastle and the championship
course at Clandeboye. With more than 20 top class courses to choose from
the visitor can opt for parkland course with tree lined fairways set
among rolling landscape or the swirling breezes and fast greens of a
links course.
Green fees are quite comparable with Scotland and despite the
better-known courses creeping upwards towards the #50 mark there are
plenty to choose from in the #20 bracket and a cluster still offering
great value for money at #12-#15. Although some courses do not require a
handicap certificate it is wise to take one with you.
The stylish Clandeboye hotel is recently opened and has views over the
parkland of the Clandeboye estate. Adjacent is the 36-hole Blackwood
Golf Course which also features a 20-bay driving range. Guests at the
hotel qualify for reduced green fees and pre-bookable tee-off times.
Stena Sealink has specially designed breaks for golfers travelling
from Scotland on its Stranraer to Larne ferry. Based on six in a
minibus, the party has three nights with BB at the Carlingford Bay Hotel
during April or October. The price is #108 each and a free brochure
service is available if you want full details of this and other offers,
telephone 0151 734 5200.
If you require more information about golf in Northern Ireland and
details of packages available contact the Northern Ireland Tourist
Board, 135 Buchanan Street, Glasgow, G1 2JA. Tel 0141 204 4454.

THE County of Fermanagh is a visitor's paradise -- wide stretches of
island-dotted waterway and secluded bays surrounded by a patchwork of
green fields, soft undulating hillsides and fresh forests. Here is one
of the most attractive uncrowded inland waterways in Europe, it is not
surprising that many visitors spend as much time on the water as on the
land.
Hiring a cruiser is just one of the ways of exploring Fermanagh and
with the opening of the Shannon/Erne Waterway visitors can now access
both the Shannon and the Erne systems.
While there are miles of water to cruise on, step ashore and discover
some of the other attractions of Fermanagh. There is the 300-seat
Ardhowen Theatre with restaurant and convenient jetty. A pleasant walk
will take you to the grounds of Castlecoole with its magnificent
National Trust property.
The sports complex, the Fermanagh Lakeland Forum is near the water's
edge. Take a swim in the heated indoor pool or a game of squash or
badminton or take a leisurely walk from the Forum to the centre of
Enniskillen itself with its excellent shopping facilities.
Also in Enniskillen is the craft and design centre situated in the
grounds of the former Buttermarket. Here you will find local craft
people at work in their workshops creating all manner of items.
The Watergate is the ancient Maguire stronghold and now houses the
regimental museum and the new heritage centre, both offering the
opportunity for all the family to enjoy the history of Fermanagh and
Enniskillen's two famous regiments.
If you are an admirer to delicate handmade craftwork then make sure
you pay a visit the Belleek Pottery. Guided tours are available where
you can see how the delicate parian china is created. Devenish Pottery
and Hammersley Pottery are two new outlets based in the Irvinestown
Business Centre and offer tours to visitors.
The whole Erne abounds with reminders of the historic past. This past
has been created in the ExplorErne Centre in Belleek. The centre has a
tourist information office and visitor attractions display together with
the history of the Erne.
For equestrian enthusiasts, the Ulster Lakeland Equestrian Centre at
Necarne near Irvinestown will be an exciting base for a family
orientated holiday. Plans are underway to provide ensuite accommodation
on site, restaurant facilities and a wide range of equestrian provision.

At the turn of the century Belfast had the biggest linen mill and the
largest shipbuilding yard in the world, on global terms it also boasted
the longest ropewalk. But what has the city to offer now? Norman
Crawford ventures forward from the City Hall and finds a great deal of
interest at every twist and turn.
BELFAST, like many major cities, has seen its population increase,
leading to more cars on its roads and the problem of tackling traffic
congestion.
This is reflected in the greatest visual change as the visitor
approaches Belfast city centre. A magnificent new motorway network --
elevated for all to see -- incorporates the Lagan Bridge and railway
link-up, so that surface travel from all directions segregates
through-traffic from central Belfast as well as pedestrians and local
traffic.
This impressive feat of engineering reminds the local of the legendary
giant Finn McCool who found a novel way to travel from Ireland to
Scotland. He simply grabbed a sod, thus forming Lough Neagh, and threw
it into the Irish Sea to make a stepping stone -- the Isle of Man.
Travelling to Belfast today, there are more conventional routes to
take -- and when you leave the motorway system there are plenty of
multi-storey car parks in which to abandon your car. To savour the very
best view of Belfast's glorious sights, get out and walk.
Make your anchor point Belfast City Hall; a classical Renaissance
building in Portland stone surmounted by a massive 180ft green dome, and
boasting a garden layout covering almost two acres. Take advantage of
the free guided tour to explore the vestibule, grand staircase, and
rotunda which are all in Italian marble, complemented by magnificent
plaster work and stained-glass windows.
Fine statues grace the grounds of the City Hall. On a granite pedestal
stands a memorial to those who perished when the Belfast-built RMS
Titanic went down, the United States of America Expeditionary Force
column marks the first landing of American personnel in the UK in 1942
and the Belfast War Memorial stands in the Garden of Rememberance. In
front of the main entrance stands a marble statue of Queen Victoria, who
granted Belfast city status in 1888.
With the City Hall entrance behind you, Donegall Place, which is
Belfast's main shopping centre, stands opposite. On the right of the
centre is a six-storey building erected by two entrepreneurs, Robinson
and Cleaver, whose names were known world-wide as suppliers of linen
goods including sheets and pillow cases. The building itself had shops
on the ground floor and manufacturing premises on the upper floors --
today it is called Cleaver House.
Adjoining this is a red sandstone building (formerly the Belfast
warehouse of a textile manufacturer) occupied by Marks and Spencer as an
extension to their store in Donegall Place.
As you stroll down Donegall Place, many names will be instantly
recognisible. The Ulster Bank and the Bank of Ireland carry out their
fiscal duties here, while cafes and restaurants en route tempt you to
rest a while.
When you reach McDonald's you have arrived at Castle Junction. Looking
around at the street names -- Castle Junction, Castle Street, Castle
Lane and the new shopping centre, Castlecourt, there are no prizes for
guessing what inspired the area. Since early Anglo-Norman times there
was a castle at Belfast, but today no-one is certain where exactly it
was sited, even though it was demolished and rebuilt several times.
The Chichester family and the Earls of Donegall are also reminders of
the past through street names. In 1708, Belfast Castle was gutted by
fire and the family of the fourth Earl of Donegall perished, marking the
end of the castle as a family residence.
From Castle Court cross over to Royal Avenue, formerly known as
Hercules Street. This was once a street of butchers' shops with
abattoirs to the rear, near the old Smithfield Square; but in 1888 the
town fathers, proud of their new city status, widened Hercules Street
and moved all the meat traders and slaughterhouses to a less prominent
position.
Venture down Rosemary Street, which is shown clearly on maps as far
back as the early seventeenth century. The aroma of freshly roasted
coffee beans might attract you to Bewley's Coffee Shop, a Dublin coffee
house, but do not leave without heading into the various entrys
(vennels) and side streets where old pubs such as Kelly's Cellars,
White's Tavern and the Duke of York have served Belfast's thirsty
citizens for centuries.
Crown Entry, Pottinger's Entry, Cornmarket and Ann Street are the very
places for boutiques and specialist shops, where you can find exotic
items such as Indian brassware and Spanish pottery.
Take a wander through the churches -- all in the central area -- for a
change of mood after the hurly-burly of shopping. Opposite Bewley's
Coffee Shop is the Rosemary Street non-subscribing Presbyterian Church.
Oval-shaped, brick built, with box pews, it was constructed near the end
of the eighteenth century for the Scottish Covenanters who had come to
settle in the Belfast area.
Not far away at the bottom of High Street is St George's Church, built
in 1816 on the site of a former Belfast Parish Church. It has a rather
grand appearance and interesting facade. Columns designed for a palatial
County Londonderry mansion that was never completed were given to the
church, adding to its basic but attractive architecture.
St Anne's Parish Church, in Donegall Street, was demolished at the
beginning of the century to be replaced by St Anne's Cathedral where
most major ecumenical and commemorative services are now held. By way of
a reminder of Belfast's sea-faring history, navigational buoys from the
Belfast Lough add colour and interest to a quiet and restful corner.
Further up Donegall Street is St Patrick's Church, built by
subscription from all sectors of the community around 1800; and the
Lower Falls Road is home to St Peter's twin-spired cathedral, originally
in a confined site but now more visible. However, the most
architecturally pleasing church is St Malachy's in Alfred Street behind
the City Hall.
Should you become weary from your wanderings, there is a wealth of
restaurants in this area, but there is also so much more to be enjoyed
in downtown central Belfast.
Starting again at the City Hall, this time at the back, directly
opposite to the left is the Linen Hall library, established in 1788. A
private subscription library supported by the Arts Council, it has large
collections of Irish records and a unique archive of Belfast's history.
On your left is the large, imposing Scottish Provident building, with
shops on the ground floor and offices above. The detailed ornamentation
around the various entrances are a reminder of the city's original core
industries. By way of contrast, the modern head office of the Northern
Bank is its neighbour, but the two sit comfortably nonetheless.
Continue to the Black Man at the west end of Wellington Place --
anybody will tell you where it is, fewer will tell you who the subject
of the monument is. It is Dr Henry Cooke, who was a prominent religious
and political activist more than 150 years ago and arch rival of David
O'Donnell, famous in Dublin and Irish politics. Behind the Black Man is
a fine brick-built school, the Royal Belfast Academical Institution,
conceived at the beginning of the nineteenth century as a place of
advanced learning, but since superseded by Queen's University. Today it
is a grammar school for boys.
Head south towards Queen's University via Great Victoria Street, where
there are many buildings of interest. The Lanyon building, established
as part of the Royal University of Ireland, is the symbol of Queen's to
all graduates. Since 1908 it has operated its own church, and now offers
a wide range of academic schools.
Between the RBAI and Queen's is the Grand Opera House, City Centre
Halls, Europa Hotel and restaurants galore. Before you reach the
university area, turn left at Bruce Street into Dublin Road which will
take you back to the City Hall.
In such a walkabout, the central flat area has been briefly covered,
but the city radiates in all directions. There are many other areas of
interest such as the Law Courts, reached through Chichester Street;
beautiful Georgian town houses; the Shaws Bridge area and numerous city
parks including Ormeau, Dixon, Barnetts and the Lagan Valley regional
park.

WHAT do Brian Mawhinney, David Montgomery, Magnus Magnusson, Gerry
Kelly and a troupe of flamenco dancers have in common? The answer is
elementary, they're all involved in helping Queen's University celebrate
its 150th anniversary.
Queen's has lined up a year of events to celebrate its
sesquicentenary. Some are targeted at present-day students and
graduates. However, many are aimed at people who have never been inside
the university before.
Fashion shows, ceilis, classical music, drama, jazz concerts, sports
events, chat shows, a discovery dome, a special 150 week in May, and an
Irish Week in March, have been planned to highlight Queen's contribution
to the community. A series of special lectures has also been arranged by
many departments within the university.
The programme includes a number of ceremonial events, the first of
which was the Queen's 150 graduation ceremony last month, when the heads
of the Irish Universities and the chairman of the United Kingdom's
committee of vice-chancellors and principals were awarded honorary
degrees.
St Patrick's Church of Ireland Cathedral in Armagh staged a special
church service to mark the anniversary of the establishment of the three
Queen's colleges in Belfast, Cork and Galway on February 15.
The Very Rev Dr John Dunlop, former Moderator of the General Assembly
of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and a Queen's graduate, gave the
address. Archbishops Dr Robin Eames and Cardinal Cahal Daly, both
graduates of the university, also attended.
A variety of sporting events featuring sportsmen and women from
Queen's, as well as a few celebrities, will be held under the banner of
Intervarsity championships, and the students' union is compiling its own
programme of events.
Sir Gordon Beveridge, President and Vice-Chancellor of Queen's
University, said: ''The purpose of our special year is to make the
sesquicentenary a celebration of the University's long tradition of
excellence in scholarship at home, its influence abroad and its promise
of the future.''
Queen's is very much at the heart of cultural life in Northern
Ireland. Each year, it stages the largest arts festival, after
Edinburgh, in the British Isles. It also has five concert halls, an art
gallery, and the only full-time film theatre in the United Kingdom. And
all these venues will be participating in Queen's 150.
The celebrations have already begun. Phil Coulter, himself a former
student of the university, gave a special concert in the Whitla Hall to
help launch Queen's 150. A series of celebrity lectures is proving
popular with students and public alike.
For further information on events contact Mervyn Farrell or Grania
McFadden on 01232 335150 or Anne Langford on 01232 245133, ext 3094.

Ian Henderson, chief executive of Northern Ireland Tourist Board,
welcomes 1995.
The Northern Ireland Tourist Board will continue to strive to ensure
the most positive and supportive environment persists for future growth.
Investment in accommodation development remains a key challenge in the
coming years.
NORTHERN Ireland is once again in the world's headlines. With peace
has come new waves of overseas journalists and broadcasters -- looking
for good news. Holiday programmes and travel supplements are all
focusing on Northern Ireland and finding much to recommend.
Recent years have seen major investments in all sections of the
industry. Enlargement and improvements in accommodation, transport,
infrastructure, and visitor attractions, together with the beauty of our
natural environment, have provided us with a very good tourism product.
Tourism currently accounts for 2% of the Northern Ireland Gross
Domestic Product; in the Republic of Ireland the figure rises to 7%.
Reducing this discrepancy is a major goal of the Northern Ireland
Tourist Board. In practical terms, this potential could produce 20,000
jobs over the next five years. To achieve this it will be necessary for
a wide range of organisations to continue to demonstrate commitment to
further development. We will need to attract an additional one million
visitors per year by the millennium.
The private sector will account for much of the future growth;
however, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will continue to strive to
ensure the most positive and supportive environment persists for future
growth. Investment in accommodation development remains a key challenge
in the coming years.
While the continued development of facilities remains vital, we also
face major challenges in marketing, and in ensuring that the highest
possible standards are achieved and maintained throughout the industry.
The recent surge in visitors is, of course, welcomed; but we are hoping
to convert the curious into dedicated regular visitors. This will
require a fundamental change in the way that Northern Ireland is viewed
from the outside.
''The Northern Ireland You'll Never Know. Unless You Go'', has been
the theme of NITB's recent advertising campaign in Scotland. Investment
in a Glasgow office, which opened in March 1994, and sponsorship of the
Celtic Connections festival are already paying dividends. The Glasgow
office received 875 enquiries during January 1995, and the number of
Scottish visitors to Northern Ireland is expected to comfortably pass
the 200,000 mark in this year.
The changing situation in Northern Ireland has increased the
attractiveness of the island of Ireland as a whole. It also provides the
opportunity of attracting tourists who previously declined to travel
north of the Border. Shared facilities, such as the Erne-Shannon
waterway, mean that we will continue to work closely with our
counterparts in the Republic of Ireland to the mutual benefit of
visitors and the tourist trade.
In 1995, a #6m ''Ireland Vacations'' TV advertising campaign will be
shown in the US, Great Britain, France, and Germany. This All-Ireland
marketing initiative will incorporate a high level of commitment from
the private sector.
As well as being a marketing partner, Ireland is also an important
market for us. A year ago 70% of Irish residents had never spent a night
in Northern Ireland. In the past months many have made first- time
visits, and 1995 promises to be a successful year in this marketplace.
Casual observation reveals that there are now many more Southern
registered cars on our roads than before. This is borne out by the
experience of our Dublin office which received 5649 enquiries in January
1995 -- an increase of 208% over the previous January.
Our Belfast Tourist Information Centre, at St Anne's Court, handled
16,597 telephone and in-person enquiries during January 1995, an
increase of 95.5% over the previous year. Telephone enquiries from
England and Scotland, in particular, have risen substantially. Although
the winter months are generally considered an off-peak period, the
centre welcomed over 300 visitors a day during even the most inclement
of January days -- a volume of interest that is not usually experienced
before the Easter break.
Internationally the trend is the same. The Northern Ireland Tourist
Board's overseas offices attracted 7007 enquiries during January 1995,
compared with 5870 in January 1994. Many of our hotels are now signing
up with tour operators for packages that are sold world-wide. They also
report that there is a trend towards week-long packages and away from
the ''quick look'' approach that many previously adopted. However, due
to printing schedules it may be 1996 before Northern Ireland
destinations make it into the brochures.
To convert this international interest into the benefits at home, our
local authorities, and other marketing consortia, are to be
congratulated on their positive, and imaginative efforts. Initiatives
such as the ''Coasts of Down'' and ''SAIL Northern Ireland'' demonstrate
just what can be accomplished through co-operation. The ''Belfast and
Proud'' campaign shows that it is possible to tackle negative images
head on with a bold and positive message.
While the benefits of increased interest will not be fully enjoyed by
the trade for some time yet, the indications are already extremely
positive; the 1995 January hotel room occupancy rate of 46% was the
highest level recorded for the month since records began.
An important aspect of today's tourist industry is the conference
market. Established in 1994, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board's
conference bureau advises and assists business while actively promoting
our local facilities. The Belfast Waterfront Convention and Concert Hall
will provide a major stimulus to this sector.
Finally, 1995 sees the 50th anniversary of VE Day and the NITB is
pleased to be working with Derry City Council and North Down Borough
Council on two major commemorations of that day. Commemorating peace in
1995 seems particularly apt.

No visitor should leave Northern Ireland without experiencing the
breathtaking beauty of the Glens, says Rennie McOwan.
SOME names are truly historic and the Glens is such a one. There are
nine of them cutting into the high Garron plateau in County Antrim and
at one time they almost seemed a separate world. The boundary terrain
was so rough in past times that it was sometimes easier for the Glens
people to trade with Scotland by boat than to travel on foot or by horse
to other parts of Ireland.
An ancient track, known as The Route, by-passed the Glens to the west
and it was 1834 before a Scots engineer blasted a road along the Antrim
coast and the Glens were linked up.
It is now one of the most scenic drives in Northern Ireland and links
Larne with Ballycastle. The hills and moors are on one side and the sea
on the other with fine views to Rathlin island, Kintyre and other parts
of Scotland.
The little villages have a long tradition of folk music and the Glens
are probably the most Celtic part of Northern Ireland. They nowadays
attract sea anglers, botanists, geologists, walkers and golfers.
Scotland's Clan Donald spread here and evolved a new branch, of
Dunnybeg, on the island of Islay and in the Glens. The areas of good
land have known many peoples and many wars, and the relics of ancient
races and more modern castles can be seen.
It sometimes seems to visitors that the small fields run incredibly
high up the hillsides. The landscape has a striking, patchwork effect
with many hawthorns as ancient boundary markers and modern fuschia
hedges. The climate is mild, snow is rare and palm trees can be seen in
village gardens.
The meanings of the nine glen names are now lost in time, but they
probably translate as Arm (of the army), Cloy (hedges), Ariff
(ploughman), Ballyamon (Edward's town), Aan (rush lights), Corp (of the
slaughter), Dun (brown), Shesk (sedgy) and Taisie (a princess's name).
All are beautiful, but Glen Ariff is the queen, a broad strath and a
national nature reserve, farmed in the lower sections, bounded by steep
hills and tailing off into moorland. The upper part is now a forest
park: I once had the exhilarating experience of running along a path
above a waterfall and then through water being blown upwards by the
wind.
The Glens are only 2[1/4] miles from Stranraer or Cairnryan to Larne
and 25 miles from Belfast airport. All the villages are pleasant, but
Carnlough with its sandy bay and little harbour is my favourite.
Cushendall, the capital of the Glens and sited at the junction of three
of them, is also very attractive. Unspoiled Cushendun is a delight for
anglers and has conservation status.
The nine Glens are worth savouring. Their names can bring tears to the
eyes of exiles. It's a great area for strolling, browsing, having
picnics, bird watching, relaxing in hotels and pubs of great character
and generally plowtering.
The Celtic bard Ossian, son of the great Fingal, is reputedly buried
in Glenaan (although Scotland claims the Sma' Glen, near Amulree, for
that), the poetess of the Glens, Moire O'Neill, was born in Cushendun,
and John Masefield, English poet laureate, found a wife there.
This last achievement would not surprise other visitors. The bracing
weather and healthy food seem to have given everyone a sparkling
complexion.

Derelict cottages have been offered a breath of life thanks to a
recent initiative.
THE Northern Ireland Tourist Board now has a section dedicated to
restoring country cottages that have over the years fallen into neglect.
Managed by Ann McLaughlin, the Rural Cottage Company has a particular
interest in acquiring properties in the Glens of Antrim and the
Sperrins.
The company will lease the derelict building from the owner for 21
years after which time the refurbished and restored property will revert
back to the original owner. Before work commences the capital cost of
the project will be confirmed by the architect and quantity surveyor.
The owner will pay 10% of the cost of the restoration, providing 50%
of this figure on signing the lease and the remainder when the building
work has been completed. If before the 21-year lease has run its course
the owner wishes to step out of the contract there is a buy-out option
available after 10 years.
The Rural Cottage Company will be responsible for maintaining the
property in good condition over the period of the lease and will also be
responsible for the associated marketing costs. However, the company is
keen to have owners play some role and envisages them acting as hosts
and provide cleaning and maintenance services. In return, owners will
receive an annual sum, including a profit-sharing element.
The scheme has been recognised as having great potential for boosting
the economic development of rural areas such as Sperrins.

WHILE on a walking theme there is a dander with a difference. The
famous and historic pubs of Belfast make a refreshing change after
visiting the treasures of Belfast's past.
Take a guided tour around the Historic Heartland or try a sample from
the Tasteful and Traditional. But most appeal may come from a visit to
The Crown Liquor Saloon or the delicious Lavery's Gin Palace on the
Glorious and Grand tour.
The Duke of York is one of the oldest bars in one of the oldest parts
of town but it is quite fresh because it has recently been refurbished.
Old printing presses set under low ceilings take you back in time.
Bittles Bar is near to where the old Empire and Alhambra Theatre were
and apart from serving beer and brunch it is a bit of a gallery too and
displays the work of local artists.
Kelly's Cellars is the oldest continuous licensed premises in the
city. It was founded in 1720 by Hugh Kelly and has within its beamed
ceilings and whitewashed walls a catalogue of historic incidents to
tell. Owned by the National Trust and one of the world's most famous
pubs, The Crown Liquor Saloon opened its doors in 1849. It retains all
its original features from the gas lighting to stained glass windows and
wooden snugs. Its interior was reproduced for the film Odd Man Out,
which starred James Mason.
In the heart of the university area lies Lavery's Gin Palace.
Preferred more for its atmosphere than its attractiveness, Lavery's is a
popular haunt with students and regulars.
Guided tours of Belfast's pubs are best booked in advance, they last
for two hours and cost #5. Telephone Maggie Shannon 0232 658337.

More yachtsmen are enjoying the delights of sailing along Northern
Ireland's unspoilt coastline, reports John Hewson.
NORTHERN Ireland is firmly established among the yachting fraternity
as having some of the finest sailing waters around. And added to the
numerous coves and small harbours dotted along the coast are modern
marinas where visiting sailors have the use of excellent facilities.
Bangor on the North Down coast has the largest marina in Ireland with
a 560-berth development filling the harbour. In the early days, coal,
timber and limestone was imported through the harbour and cattle, flax
and grain were exported. Over the years exposure to the elements took
its toll and the harbour became in need of repair.
To address the matter the Seafront Development Scheme was born and
among its plans was the provision for a marina. This was opened in 1989
and the revitalisation also included a shopping centre and hotel.
Surrounding the bay are brightly coloured terraced houses, hotels, shops
and restaurants. Bangor is an excellent centre for the sightseer or for
those with more active pursuits there is sea angling, diving and boat
hire.
The marina has been awarded the Four Gold Anchor, a status which
places it among the leaders in the UK. Bangor and Cultra are the homes
of the Royal Ulster and Royal North of Ireland yacht clubs. Host to
various European sailing championships, Bangor will also have a new golf
hotel at Clandeboye.
Facing Bangor on the north shore of Belfast Lough is Northern
Ireland's oldest port, Carrickfergus. The town's 310-berth marina is
just west of the Norman castle and a short walk from the historic town
with its ancient church.
Restaurants, cafes and bars are located at the marina complex and the
town's attractions are within a few minutes walk. Facilities for
yachtsmen include a fuel berth located at the north-eastern end of the
basin, free toilets and showers, laundry, electricity and fresh water.
Carrickfergus sailing club organise a busy racing calendar and
visiting yachtsmen are encouraged to take part. A highlight of the
sailing calendar is the International Regatta for traditional boats
Classic Sail Carrickfergus.
Some of the most spectacular and challenging sailing is to be found on
the Antrim coast and Rathlin Island is an often-used stepping stone for
sailors on their way to Scotland from Ballycastle.
Coastal waters apart, Strangford Lough opens its narrow entry to some
of the most beautiful scenery in Northern Ireland. A host of small
islands and wooded shorelines create a marine nature reserve where local
yachtsmen have been quick to appreciate their good fortune. Ten sailing
and yacht clubs are established in this area.
Carlingford Lough offers a sheltered retreat between Cooley mountains
on the south and Mourne mountains to the north. Much trade was done in
the past through the port of Newry but today it is not accessible by
ship.
On the north shore Warrenpoint has a modern port and offers a pontoon
and moorings for visitors; Killowen Yacht Club also offers moorings for
visitors. On the southern shore Carlingford Marina has facilities for
visiting yachts.
But whether it be Coleraine or Killowen, Northern Ireland has a spot
where you will want to drop anchor.

Rennie McOwan visits the seat of ancient kings.
ST PATRICK has a way of setting the spirits soaring. A lovely man, as
people would say nowadays, energetic, vigorous, fiery sometimes, able to
overcome hard times, a lover of people and of creation.
When St Patrick came to Ireland from either Britain or Gaul in 432 he
meant to sail up the coast to County Antrim where, as a young slave, he
had looked after flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle on
Slemish hill, near Broughshane, between the town of Ballymena and
Carnlough village in the Glens of Antrim. This prominent mound-like
volcano-plug hill has an ancient fort on top and wide views.
Slemish can be climbed by most nimble visitors by way of a prominent
path and is the scene today of modern Church pilgrimages.
But strong currents swept St Patrick's boat through the tidal narrows
of Strangford Lough, the largest sea inlet in the British Isles, and he
landed where the Slaney river flows into the lough and 10 miles east of
what is now the county town of Down, Downpatrick. Strangford was named
by the Vikings 1000 years ago and means strong or violent currents and
is now an attractive village facing its twin town of Portaferry across
the straits.
Strangford Lough is a huge, gouging bite into the eastern section of
Co Down, with the great Ards peninsula curving round like an inverted
crescent-shape and forming its eastern shore.
It is a beautiful corner of wild coastline, sheltered corners, rolling
hills, wide rivers, bird-filled estuaries, rich farmland and the relics
of many peoples.
Patrick toiled for 30 years to convert the Irish to Christianity and
died at Saul in 461 and is buried at Downpatrick -- now a natural
touring centre 20 miles south of Belfast -- in a grave now marked by
simple stone slabs in Down cathedral churchyard.
St Brigid and St Columba (Columcille) are also buried there.
You can follow St Patrick's first footsteps on Irish soil, from the
spot at Ringbane, near Raholp, on Strangford Lough, where he landed, and
then on to Saul, and then to Struell where he blessed the wells. The
small church at Saul is a replica of an early Christian foundation with
a round tower.
Downpatrick has been a place of Christian worship since the fifth
century and the prominent cathedral dominates the hill today and
overlooks the wide and sparkling Quoile River.
Down County Museum is well worth a visit and was once a jail. A linked
heritage centre tells St Patrick's story. Many of the people held in the
jail were transported to Australia and Tasmania. If you are unlucky with
the weather, it is worth making a trip to the National Trust's
Castleward Mansion, just to the west of Strangford.
Images tend to dominate in Northern Ireland ... and Armagh City has
the spires of two great cathedrals sited on hilltops and the countryside
to the north east of the city has the sight and scents of apple blossom
orchards.
The separate churches tell of religious and political strains as well
as a glorious Christian heritage, but there is a happy after-glow from
one of the most successful of working-together projects, ''Armagh
Together 1994-1995'', when community sharing in a host of products
brought praise from all over the country.
St Patrick founded his first church there and the visitor sees a
county landscape which changes dramatically from the mountainous Ring of
Gullion region to the shores of vast Loch Neigh. Armagh is the most
venerated of Irish cities.
The name Armagh comes from Ard Macha or Macha's height, after a
legendary queen, Macha, who built a fortress on the high ground. For mre
than 700 years the legendary kings of Ulster had their royal capital at
nearby Navan Fort, another hilltop site, and where there is a
startlingly effective heritage centre.
The high ground of Armagh city dominates the landscape. St Patrick
approached a local chieftain, Daire, who gave him a site near the foot
of the hill where he built his first church.
After his own conversion Daire gave him the hilltop site and Christian
churches have now stood there for 15 centuries and the influence of the
Church spread all over Ireland and abroad. By the eighth century Armagh
was generally accepted as Ireland's ecclesiastical capital.
As well as the soaring walls of the two great cathedrals, the visitor
is today impressed by the standard of much of the city's other
buildings. The eighteenth-century Church of Ireland primate, the
influential Archbishop Richard Robinson, employed some of the country's
best architects and much of the city's splendour rivals that of Georgian
Dublin.
St Patrick's Church of Ireland cathedral contains the burial place of
Brian Buro, High King of Ireland, and this much loved building is on the
site of the great Irish monastic schools to which students came from all
over Europe.
The Roman Catholic cathedral stands on another hilltop across from the
older Church of Ireland cathedral and was begun in 1840. Its interior
owes much to the intricately decorated churches of continental Europe
and its soaring towers are breathtaking.
People who get steamed up about obtrusive heritage or visitor centres
being built close to historic sites will find themselves reassured by
the character of the Navan Fort centre, two miles from Armagh city. Here
King Conor NacNessa had a palace, which was also home to the Knights of
the Red Branch and the mightiest of all the Irish warriors, Cu Chuliann,
the tales of whom also appear in Scotland's Celtic history.
The centre tells the archaeological and mythological story of the area
and is built into the side of a small hill and because it has a
grassed-over roof it gives the feeling of an underground building. The
centre got a deserved tourism award in 1993.
In Armagh city itself is St Patrick's Trian (pronounced tree-an), a
name linked to the ancient divisions of Armagh. The series of displays
and audio visual theatre which tell the Armagh Story from prehistoric
times until today are housed in a complex of buildings.
If you want a change from saints and warriors then try the city's
planetarium, established in 1967 and which attracts large numbers and
which tells the story of space exploration. The city's observatory,
founded in 1790 by Archbishop Robinson from his personal finances,
combines the original Georgian mansion with modern buildings.
If that isn't enough, you can head for the Palace Stables heritage
centre where you can take part in a day in the stable life of the
eighteenth century, good fun and minus the glaur.

THE National Trust's motto in Northern Ireland is ''the more you look,
the more you see''. From the beauty of Slieve Donard in the Mourne
Mountains, to the industrial archaeology of Patterson's Spade Mill, and
a treasure of historic houses, the National Trust has a diversity of
places to visit in Northern Ireland.
County Down is a hive of activity: Castle Ward, a unique
eighteenth-century mansion is set in a 700-acre estate on the shores of
Strangford Lough. The house has two different facades, one Gothic, the
other Classical, and in the estate you will find a working cornmill, a
laundry, dairy and a wildlife centre.
Mount Stewart offers a historic house set in one of the most
spectacular gardens in the British Isles. At Rowallane near Saintfield
the garden stretches for 52 acres providing refuge for exotic plants.
Famed for their spring colour, both gardens have delights and
attractions in every season.
County Tyrone is the county of National Trust curiosities housing two
excellent examples of industrial heritage. The eighteenth-century Gray's
Printing Press, Strabane, has a display of working early printing
presses and an audio visual exhibition. At Wellbrook Beetling Mill near
Cookstown, the final process in the manufacture of linen is
demonstrated, complete with a working water wheel.
Standing in the heart of County Armagh, the orchard county of Ulster,
Ardress is a gentleman farmer's house with fine examples of Irish
furnishings. A treat for children is the cobbled farmyard with rare
breed poultry and a saddleback pig. The Argory overlooking the River
Blackwater is a house in a time capsule with everything as it was at the
start of this century.
County Fermanagh is calm serenity. One of the jewels in the region is
Castle Coole in Enniskillen, which ranks as one of the finest
neo-classical houses in Ireland. Florence Court boasts a dramatic
location, overlooking the surrounding countryside. The gardens are a
haven for plant and wildlife alike and tucked away like a prize
possession is a beautiful walled garden.
Unsurpassed for its scenic beauty is Crom Estate on the shores of
Upper Lough Erne, where you can arrive by road or boat. There are
excellent holiday cottages at both Crom and Florence Court, some of
which are adapted for less able visitors.
On one hand the Trust offers grandeur but on the other, it can offer
modesty. Hezlett House at Castlerock, County Londonderry, is a thatched
cottage, with an unsual cruck truss roof construction. Across the county
lies Springhill, a seventeenth-century Plantation house. Ten generations
of the one family lived here so it is no surprise that many say a ghost
roams the corridors at nightfall.
For further details, contact the Public Affairs Department at The
National Trust, Rowallane, Saintfield County Down. Telephone 0238
510721.

Rennie McOwan takes a higher view of Northern Ireland's spectacular
scenery.
EVERY country or area has its own special hill. There are no quibbles
about Northern Ireland's candidate, Slieve Donard, at 2796ft the highest
peak in the glorious mountains of Mourne and in Northern Ireland.
Slieve simply means mountain and is like the Scottish word ben. Donard
derives from a saint who used the hill as a place of pilgrimage, but
honesty compels me to say that some of the language used by modern
climbers as they toil up the last, very steep section to the summit
often verges on the blasphemous.
No walker should visit Northern Ireland without going to the Mournes,
dominating Co Down in the south-east corner of the Province. They do
indeed sweep down to the sea and the pleasant and historic town of
Newcastle is an excellent base. A fountain memorial to Percy French, who
wrote the famous song, stands in gardens on the sea front.
Newcastle is popular as a holiday resort and is currently free of that
modern and impersonal blemish, the gigantic superstore. It is relaxing
strolling down one side of the main street and up the other, drifting in
and out of a series of family owned shops and exchanging friendly ''good
mornings'' with local people. There is a nice community feeling.
The name Mourne may derive from the Gaelic mor, great, and rinn,
headland. They tend to be steep sided with comb-like rocky sections.
They are hills worth taking time over and have 35 summits above 1500ft,
12 above 2000ft and all in a range measuring 14 miles by seven.
The visitor is immediately struck by the differences with Scotland.
Most of Northern Ireland is heavily farmed and there are few sections of
wild moorland and automatic easy access. Most of the lower ground and
high up the hillsides is a patchwork of walls, fences, farms and
outbuildings, and in many corners rambling freely is impossible without
harm to farm life.
However, the locals and tourism authorities realise fully the desire
of people to walk or climb and there are generally, clearly marked,
access routes through to the upper ground, or handy leaflets for local,
circular strolls. The golden rule is when in doubt ask at the local
tourism office. Tight control of dogs is essential.
There is no problem about getting on to Slieve Donard. A prominent
path runs up a lovely, wooded glen from the park at the back of
Newcastle town, and another runs up from Bloody Bridge, the site of a
seventeenth century massacre, on the coast road south of the town.
The glen route rises gradually on to the open hillside and then a
clear path takes the walker to a prominent dip where a high wall runs
across the hillside. This wall is then followed eastwards to the summit.
The views can be stupendous, revealing much of south-west Scotland, the
Isle of Man, the hills of Cumbria, Snowdon in Wales, and much of
Northern Ireland itself.
Slieve Donard is a hill of many legends. A shadowy prince is reputed
to be buried there and it became a place of Christian pilgrimage in the
days of the early Celtic saints.
The Mournes have special-beauty, protected status and are ''managed''.
Slieve Donard itself is owned by the National Trust. The Department of
the Environment, in co-operation with the Trust, has opened a visitor
centre in Newcastle's main street, a sensible decision following the
painful lesson learned belatedly in Scotland that it is a mistake to put
a visitor centre on the slopes of a mountain because mess and erosion
follow.
Slieve Donard has a striking, man-made structure on it which startles
the visitor because it looks like a miniature Great Wall of China. A
double-layer, stone wall, mostly five-feet high but taller in places,
made out of large granite blocks, runs for 22 miles over the summit of
15 peaks.
It has towers at intervals and cast-iron notices warning against
trespassing (which are now obsolete). It was built by the nineteenth
century Belfast City and District Water Commissioners who needed clean
water for the spreading city and turned to a lonely glen in the Mournes.
This glen was renamed the Silent Valley. Now the site of a huge
reservoir, it can be visited as a tourist attraction. The water was
piped 40 miles to Belfast and the wall was built from 1912 to 1922 to
mark the water catchment area. The story of the builders rivals that of
the navvies in Scotland.
Mourne granite was widely used for building work in Northern Ireland,
including Stormont, and paved many towns in Lancashire, including
Liverpool.
Slieve Donard is undoubtedly the Queen of Mountains.
Another attractive range is the Sperrin Mountains, to the east of
Strabane, in Co Tyrone, in the centre of Northern Ireland. They have
five summits over 2000ft and the name derives from the Gaelic for sky.
This is an area with graves, forts, settlements and fish-rich rivers. It
is the land much beloved of the poet Seumas Heaney.
As with the mountains of Mourne, the Sperrins also have a visitor
centre which outlines the history of the area. It is sited not far from
the town of Draperstown.
These hills were once thought to be exceedingly wild and when early
settlers from King James VI's Scotland and Queen Elizabeth's England
came to Northern Ireland, events which have a direct bearing on today's
political strains, some leaders were not initially shown these hills in
case they were too daunting a sight.
In fact, they provide easy hillwalking on grass and heather and the
highest summit, Sawell (2240ft), has wide views to the hills of Donegal,
the Foyle estuary, huge Loch Neagh and, of course, the Mournes.
There are plenty of other gems. Most towns and villages have clear
walk routes, the tourism authorities produce leaflets to the official
paths, the Ways. Lake country like that in Co Fermanagh produces
charming strolling and there is plenty of good, coastal walking.
The Glens of Antrim provide rewarding visits and in laying plans it is
wise to include the spectacular Giant's Causeway on the Antrim coast,
visited by thousands of tourists each year.
A fleet of small buses take tourists from a visitor centre down to the
shore to see this extraordinary rock formation and some never get out of
the vehicles. Such a service has its place for the elderly, the infirm
or for the general tourist when the rain is lashing down. But the walker
should stroll down, explore the coast and get the true feel of this
remarkable corner.
As far as equipment is concerned, hillwalking gear for Northern
Ireland is the same as for Scotland, but greater countryside sensitivity
is often needed. The rewards are truly memorable.

Geoff Hill takes a whirlwind tour of some of Northern Ireland's best
eating places.
ARGUABLY the best restaurant in Northern Ireland is named after a
French port, which seems a suitably Irish way of going about things.
Roscoff is in the heart of Belfast's Golden Mile, the area around
Shaftesbury Square where the city comes out to play of an evening.
It's owned by Paul and Jeannie Rankin, a bright young Ulster-Canadian
couple who, in the six years since it opened, not only has the
Province's only Michelin star and a Courvoisier UK's top restaurant
award, but a TV series and a big thick cookery book under their designer
belts.
At one stage it had a reputation as a place where prices were so steep
that you walked in and handed the waiter your credit card. Then you all
had a good laugh, and you walked out again. Today this is not quite
fair. Although the cost of taking the family, the in-laws and the
au-pair out to dinner at the weekend could once have involved you losing
your Barings quite badly, Roscoff has now dropped its a la carte dinners
altogether because the cheaper set menus proved so popular. And at a
piffling #21.50 for a choice of seven starters, seven main course and
seven sweets, it's hardly surprising.
Roscoff is at Lesley House, Shaftesbury Square, Belfast BT2, Tel 01232
331532. Closed Sundays.
One is Michael Deane of Deane's on the Square in Helen's Bay, a
well-heeled village in the part of Co Down which helps give rise to the
surprising statistic that Northern Ireland has more BMWs per capita than
anywhere in the world outside Germany.
If anything, the Mossiman-trained Deane can be better at times than
his mentors, producing nosh of such intriguingly elegant subtlety that
the last time I ate there I was quite convinced I'd died and gone to
heaven.
However, eating there needn't break the bank, with two-course dinners
at #19 and three-course Sunday lunches for #15.
Deane's is at Station Square, Helen's Bay, about 20 minutes from
Belfast, Tel 01247 852841. Closed Mondays.
Another young upstart is Shanks in Bangor, on the coast about 30
minutes from Belfast and a hymn of mouthwatering meat, fabulous sauces,
a delightfully eclectic menu, unobtrusive service and a decor which
teeters elegantly between post-Roscoff and sub-Conran.
Shanks is at 150 Crawfordsburn Road, Bangor, Tel 01247 853313. There
is no a la carte menu, and set dinners are #20.95 for three courses.
Lunches are #5 upwards. Closed Sunday and Monday evenings, open for
lunch seven days.
Slightly further afield, and an old favourite of mine, is the Grange
in Waringstown. If you don't enjoy treats like their baked salmon,
whisky steak and chocolate mousse, I'll eat my hat after covering it
lightly with lukewarm mayonnaise. Low-fat, naturally.
The Grange is at Mill Hill, Main Street, Waringstown, about 45 minutes
from Belfast, Tel 01762 881989. Dinners are a la carte, at an average of
#20-#22 for three courses, and lunches average #12 for three courses.
Closed for dinner Sunday and Monday, closed for lunch Saturday and
Monday.
If you're not inclined to travel outside the capital, one recent
surprise for me was the Malone Lodge Hotel in Belfast's leafy university
area, where even during the height of the troubles you were more likely
to be run down by a Volvo than shot by a terrorist.
Two of us had an excellent set three-course dinner there a while back
for #35 including a bottle of wine. Don't be put off by the royal blue
exterior -- inside all is snug and warm, with a roaring fire to toast
your toes while you mull over the menu.
The Malone Lodge is at 60 Eglantine Avenue, Belfast BT9, Tel 01232
382409. A la carte dinner #16 for three courses, lunches #11.50 for
three courses or #9.50 for two courses. Closed Sunday.
On the ethnic front, highly recommended is the stylish Italian
restaurant Antica Roma, also in the south of the city. Its spaghetti
negri with seafood is possible the most divine pasta dish you'll get
without having a mother-in-law from Milano.
Antica Roma is at 67 Botanic Avenue, Belfast BT7, Tel 01232 311121. A
la carte dinners average #18-22 for three courses, lunches #12 for three
courses. Closed Sunday.
The best Indian restaurant I know in Belfast is the Tajput. The food
is almost certain to induce a state on the edge of nirvana, and I like
to think of the burgundy flock wallpaper as an indication of strict
adherence to traditional values rather than a lapse of taste.
The Rajput is at 461 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9, Tel 01232 662168. Set
dinners #10.75-#14.75 for three courses. Set lunches #5.50 for two
courses weekdays. Open seven days.
Respected Chinese restaurants include the Welcome, 22 Stranmillis
Road, Belfast BT9, Tel 01232 381359, open seven days, and the Manor
House, 47 Donegal Pass, Belfast BT7.
Details of all places listed can be found in the Northern Ireland
Tourist Board's Where to Eat guide, available for #2.50 from the board's
office at 135 Buchanan Street, Glasgow G1 2JA, Tel 0141 204 4454.

SET in the lovely surroundings of the Botanic Gardens at Stranmillis,
close to all major amenities, the Ulster Museum has rich and fascinating
collections of art, archaelogy, ethnography, history and natural
sciences.
Visitors to the art galleries can enjoy a range of works by Irish
painters, watercolours and drawings. Old Masters and modern
international art, as well as fine collections of old and new glass and
ceramics.
Go further back in time and view the dazzling gold of the Spanish
Armada wrecks, excavated material from prehistoric sites and, of course,
the children's favourite, the Egyptian mummy Takubuti.
Local history galleries include an impressive display of steam
engines, waterwheels and linen machinery, while Made in Belfast provides
a potted history of Belfast industries of the past 100 years.
Among the natural sciences displays, don't miss the gemstone gallery,
Earth's Treasures, or the chance to experience an underwater adventure
in The Living Sea.
The museum's 1995 programme features a host of temporary exhibitions,
lectures, art films, gallery tours, family events and activities.
Our star attraction for 1995 is a major, new temporary exhibition,
Monster Creepy-Crawlies. If you want to know what it feels like to be
reduced to the size of an insect, buzz along to the Ulster Museum
between June 9 and November 15 for a fascinating and memorable voyage
through the world of creepy crawlies.
The exhibition features 11 giant models, from the ladybird and snail
to spiders and scorpions, as well as a host of wonderful activities --
and you can even see the real thing in the live insect zoo.
The museum shop has a good selection of books, crafts, gifts,
reproductions, replicas and exhibition-related souvenirs, with prices
from 25p to #250.
The Collections Cafe, on the third floor overlooking Botanic Gardens,
offers a range of refreshments, snacks and light meals.
Visitors to the museum can also enjoy a pleasant walk through the
Botanic Gardens, where the Tropical Ravine and Lanyon's famous Palm
House of curvilinear glass and cast iron are well worth a visit.
Close to all main access routes and within walking distance of a
number of hotels and guesthouses, major shopping precincts, eateries,
theatres and cinemas, the Ulster Museum has something for everyone from
local visitors and families, school groups and specialists to day
visitors and longer-stay tourists.

There are a number of options open to the traveller from Scotland to
Northern Ireland.
THE first-time visitor to Northern Ireland will soon become aware of
the country's varied attractions. Horse fairs, traditional music
festivals, concerts and shows compete with the well-established and
popular. The land boasts fine golf courses, some of the best coarse
fishing in the world, walking, rambling, birdwatching and getting there
is quick and hassle free.
From Scotland the most popular route is Stranraer to Larne or Belfast
or the Cairnryan to Larne crossing, which is the shortest route in
distance.
P&amp;O European Ferries operate the route from Cairnryan to Larne with
its ships the Pride of Ailsa and the Pride of Rathlin. Onboard features
include spacious lounges, high-back seating, bar and self-service
restaurant. There is also a video cinema, Disney-themed play area, shop,
and a lounge to relax in peace and quiet.
For an extra supplement of #6, bookable on board, passengers can relax
and enjoy P&amp;O's club class. A luxury lounge complete with steward
service, private bar and free tea, coffee and daily newspapers and
magazines are the key features. Smoking in the area is not permitted.
Both ships are fully stabilised and are capable of carrying 1000
people, however, this has been reduced to 610 so that passengers may
enjoy more space. Disabled passengers are offered every assistance and
lifts and toilet facilities are available on board.
P&amp;O offers a choice of up to six return crossings daily on a journey
that takes a little more than two hours. Check-in times are 30 minures
for vehicles and 45 minutes for foot passengers.
Worthwhile savings can be made if travelling off-peak, however, a car,
motorhome or minibus up to 6.50m long with up to five passengers,
including driver, will cost at peak time July/August #170 for a five-day
return or #309 standard return. Savings of 20% can be made on bookings
made and paid for before the end of March. P&amp;O Ferries, Cairnryan 0581
200276.
Stena Sealink operate between Stranraer and Larne with ferries the
Stena Antrim, Stena Caledonia, and Stena Gallaway. The crossing time on
this route is two hours and 20 minutes.
On-board facilities on these ships include self-service restaurant,
showbar/bars, gift shop, lounges, children's play area, mother and baby
changing area, and visitor lounge.
There are between eight and 10 crossings per day depending on time of
year and the check-in time for cars is 30 minutes and for foot
passengers 45 minutes.
Taking a peak holiday time and the most expensive sailing of the day
this crossing would cost #310; for a five-day return the fare would be
#170. Again a car plus five passengers has been used to illustrate this
fare. Meaningful savings can be made by choosing an off-peak ferry or by
booking before the end of March.
Stena Sealink 01233 647047.
Seacat Scotland operates its catamaran between Stranraer and the heart
of Belfast. In a journey that takes 90 minutes from port to port, with
quick boarding and unloading times, day-trips and short breaks become
more feasible. Indeed, many passengers have realised the enjoyment of
day-trip shopping in Belfast.
The Seacat offers a range of passenger facilities during the crossing.
Hot and cold food with table service, bar, gift shop selling a range of
Irish and Scottish goods. Its capacity for 450 passengers allows freedom
of movement while on board and also guarantees everyone a seat.
Children can enjoy videos or look through to the bridge and watch the
captain and engineer at work, as the vessel reaches speeds of up to 37
knots. A display which illustrates the marine life in the Irish waters
has also been commissioned.
Check-in time is 30 minutes and Seacat operates the route five times
each day. A six-day return with car, maximum length 5.5m, and four
adults is #218 at peak holiday time, similarly a standard return costs
#345. Again great savings can be made by travelling early in the morning
or late at night.
Foot passengers with their sights set on Belfast's shops will pay #23
for a day return ticket. Senior citizens and students, #15. The
catamaran has a capacity for 80 cars and there are reasonable links to
all main roads from Donegall Quay, Belfast.
Further details, Seacat 0345 523523.
Travellers by air to Northern Ireland may do so through Aberdeen,
Edinburgh and Glasgow to Belfast or Londonderry.
British Airways operates a twice daily service from Aberdeen to
Belfast that takes just over two hours in a Shorts 360. From Glasgow
there is a six times each day service using the same type of aircraft
and with a flight time of 50 minutes.
Belfast City Airport is three miles from the City Hall and passengers
from Edinburgh have a chance of a variety of flight times depending on
the day of the week. The flight takes 50 minutes and a BAe ATP aircraft
is used on this route. Passengers may also fly from Glasgow or Aberdeen
to Belfast City Airport.
In many cases British Airways has an association with Manx Airlines
and Loganair. Examples fares are Edinburgh to Belfast City #108 return
or Glasgow to Belfast International #98. Details British Airways 0345
222111.
At peak times ferry operators have five sailings each day from
Stranraer to Larne

Geoff Hill recalls the good old days of youth hosteling.
SPOILED rotten, the lot of them.
When I were a lad, a youth hostel was a tin hut in the middle of a
lake. A farthing a night to sleep on the floor with nothing but a
shoelace to keep you warm.
Today the 29 hostels in the Northern Ireland Tourist Board's Where to
Stay guide offer everything from jet skiing and parachuting to swimming
pools. Heated swimming pools, imagine.
The newest of them is the Youth Hostel Association's 126-bed hostel at
22 Donegall Road, Belfast, BT12 5JN, Tel 01232 324733, fax 01232 439699.
So nice inside that a Canadian couple I know decided to stay there
recently for a week instead of the hotel they'd planned, it offers
family rooms, meals and a short walk to Queen's University, the Ulster
Museum, Botanic railway station and the city's so-called Golden Mile,
home to more nightlife than you can shake a pint of Guinness at. Or
something like that. Prices start at #7 a night, and it's open all year
24 hours a day.
Just as new and just as swish is the association's Oakgrove Manor
hostel at 4 Magazine Street, Londonderry, 01504 372273, fax 01504
372409. A beautifully designed building inside the old walled city which
has been imaginatively restored with the help of lots of lovely ecus
from Brussels, the hostel is close to several excellent museums, not to
mention a host of galleries, theatres and shops. There are 132 beds,
meals, family rooms and room rates starting at #7.20 a night, and it's
open all year.
Outside the two big cities, there are hostels just about everywhere
you'd want to go, some of them complete with gallons of scenery outside
the front door.
Like Cushendall hostel, a mile north of a little seashore village and
a perfect base for walking the glens of Antrim. It's at 42 Layde Road,
Cushendall BT44 0NQ, Tel 012667 71344, with 54 beds, breakfast and
prices from #5.30. Open all year.
Further up the magnificent north Antrim coastline is Whitepark Bay
hostel, in the tiny harbour of Ballintoy and close to the Giant's
Causeway and the Carrick-a-rede rope bridge, which is frightening on the
way across and even worse when you realise that the only way back is to
do it again. It's at 157 Whitepark Road, Ballintoy, BT54 6NH, Tel 012657
31745, with 44 beds and prices from #5.30. Open all year.
Down in the south west of the Province, the Castle Archdale hostel, in
converted eighteenth-century stables, is an idyllic base for exploring
the shores and islands of Lough Erne. It has 54 beds, meals, family
rooms and prices from #5.30. Open all year.
* Details of all hostels are in the Northern Ireland Tourist Board's

Long tales and big catches are in good supply among Northern Ireland's
fishermen, reports Phil Stirling.
LEGENDS are legion in Northern Ireland and ten-a-penny among anglers
but when a huge pike estimated at 24.5kg (a fraction below 54lbs) was
pitch-forked from Lough Erne in the 1920s, the province's reputation as
one of Europe's best regions for the coarse angler was assured.
Perhaps realising they were on to something, the Irish now protect
their pike: there is a two per day bag limit with a maximium weight of
8.8lb a fish. The use of pitchforks is no longer tolerated.
Today's methods are more sophisticated and doubtless help match
angling world records fall with monotonous regularity to specimens from
these waters.
Bream, roach, rudd, tench, perch, and pike are all plentiful and well
distributed across the province, and whether fishing from bank or boat
the combination of unspoiled scenery and fine fighting fish can make for
an unforgettable angling break.
Try Laggan River on Belfast's doorstep where pike, roach, rudd and
bream respond best to light tackle and a lighter touch.
The three Bann River navigation canals in County Antrim offer good
sport from the bank. Further up river into Armagh lies a 10-mile stretch
close to Portadown with five easily reached angling areas.
Those who believe the big fish need big waters might try Lough Neagh,
a vast inland sea where anglers can lose themselves casting away cares
on this splendidly serene expanse. It's just round the corner from
Belfast Airport. . . .about a million miles away.
Further West into County Fermanagh lies Lough Erne. Fifty miles of
crystal-clear water, it boasts around 40 good-quality fishing areas.
Like most Irish waters, permits for the Erne are widely available and
cheap.
Of game fish the Irish have been unusually circumspect in the past,
surely not because they want to keep it to themselves?
The best of the salmon fishing takes place from mid-June to the end of
July, though locals may say little of this to a casual enquirer. You
may, however, catch them raising a glass to ''Pat Curry's red shrimp''
-- an Irish fly salmon seem unwilling to pass.
If you are lucky you can run into a summer salmon of up to 20lbs,
especially on the River Mourne or Lackagh.
Spring salmon are caught from January but the best months are March to
May, with fish of around eight to 12lbs on average. Prices vary but, in
general, compare very favourably with Scottish waters. For example,
Gillarroo Angles offers private beats on the Bann, Bush, Mourne and
Owenkilliew from around #25 to #60 a day (#200 a week for the Mourne).
Most of these are fly only or have fly only sections.
Club and day-ticket waters abound, and can be had for #10 to #15 a
day.
Northern Ireland can also offer the trout angler small streams, hill
loughs, lowland lakes to the big limestone loughs of Erne and Melvin.
The cream of the river fishing is the pursuit of the Lough Neagh
dollaghan. These large lake trout grow at a similar rate to salmon and
can be caught from July through August, though October is the peak
month.
The famous Gillarroo trout are another of the north's indigenous
beauties and, together with a second variant, Sonaghen, provide the bulk
of the sport on Lough Melvin.
No matter your quarry and whatever your tackle, the unspoiled nature
of the land and waters ensures visiting anglers will return home hooked.
But please remember, no pitch forks.
Gillarroo Angles, 7 Cooloon Park, Newtonabbey, BT37 0RR, Tel 0232
862419 is one of a number of companies who organise fishing parties.

The Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, admitted yesterday that the
''feel-good factor'' may not return this century, despite Britain's
apparently optimistic economic prospects.
His remarks were last night being construed as an admission that the
Tories might not reap the political advantage of economic recovery for
years.
Mr Clarke said: ''I quite accept that people aren't going to feel more
secure, more comfortable that they're going to get rising prosperity,
until we've carried on delivering this for another couple of years at
least. I think it could go on through the 90s.''
But he heralded yesterday's figures, showing a further fall in
unemployment and a rise in sales, as more signs of economic recovery.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit was cut by
27,400 in February, to 2,364,700, a rate of 8.4%, the Employment
Department announced. In Scotland, the jobless total fell to a new
four-year low.
Shop sales rose sharply last month, with volumes increasing by 1.2%
compared with January, and were 2.6% higher than February 1994,
according to the Central Statistical Office.
Mr Clarke told BBC Radio: ''Potentially, it's the best combination
we've seen for a quarter of a century, and we're the only European
country that's combining a fall in unemployment with steady growth --
which is ahead of all the others.
''But I've always said we've got to make it last. It's got to be
sustained.''
Mr Clarke pledged to take whatever action was necessary to keep
inflation in check, and said he would not cut taxes before it was
prudent to do so.
''If I can afford tax cuts, as a Conservative Chancellor I'm only too
willing and eager to do so. But I'm not going to undo the good work by
having tax cuts until, firstly, we have got spending and borrowing under
control, and until it is good for the economy.''
The Shadow Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, said: ''While I welcome any
fall in unemployment, there is a huge amount of insecurity in the
country. Living standards for the majority of people are still falling.
''People face two extra tax rises in April, and people are
experiencing mortgage rises as well. There is not the evidence there
ought to be that we have investment-led growth in the economy.''
He called for higher investment in skills, industry, and
infrastructure, and accused Mr Clarke of being too complacent about the
2,300,000 unemployed.
The Scottish Office Industry Minister, Mr George Kynoch, welcomed the
latest unemployment figures, which saw the Scottish total fall by 2200
to 207,900, or 8.3% of the workforce.
However, his political opponents were sceptical. Labour's employment
spokesman, Mr John McFall, said that despite ''Tory blustering'',
Scotland's economy was weakening in relation to the rest of the UK, with
an over-dependence on the electronics sector.
Ms Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP's employment spokesperson, said the recent
threat to jobs at the BBC and John Brown Engineering underlined the need
for the Government to accept the seriousness of the problems facing the
Scottish economy.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats' leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said recent
indicators suggested the recovery was slowing down, and the Tories had
no room for complacency.
Mr Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, welcomed the fall in
unemployment, but said costs and other inflationary pressures could
threaten the recovery and job creation.
The general secretary of the STUC, Mr Campbell Christie, urged
Ministers to heed the findings of a recent International Labour
Organisation report, which talked of a global unemployment crisis.
* Yesterday's statistics emerged on a day which illustrated the
current volatility of the British jobs market.
British Aerospace Defence announced it was shedding up to 1350 jobs at
three English factories ''to reflect workload levels and improve
competitiveness''.
Meanwhile, it was revealed that Japanese car maker Toyota is about to
announce a doubling of production in Britain, creating 1500 jobs at its
plant near Derby.

AT Inverness last week both George Robertson and Tony Blair reaffirmed
their party's commitment to legislating for a Scottish Parliament within
the first year of a Labour Government. But over the last two months
Labour has been pushed on to the defensive over its policy of regional
assemblies England.
A number of high profile attacks on devolution, many from Prime
Minister Major himself, have left the Labour leadership in apparent
confusion over what to do about the English regions. Just two weeks ago,
the Labour leader and his deputy, John Prescott, appeared to contradict
each other on the review of Labour's policy for devolved assemblies for
England.
In addition, the man charged with fronting Labour's English plans, the
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw, is known to be a sceptic.
But dramatic new evidence has emerged. It suggests that Labour was
right to endorse regional assemblies for England, and that the
leadership should stop backtracking. Indeed, it throws down a gauntlet
to Labour and fires a shot across the bows of the Tories.
Carried out by the universities of Strathclyde and Glasgow, the Public
Opinion and Local Citizenship survey shows that the tide may well be
turning in favour of Labour's plans. Not surprisingly, support in
Scotland for an elected assembly is high, at 72%, while in Wales it has
grown to 58%.
But Scotland and Wales have not been the issue, and the startling
picture comes from England, where now a clear majority of 51% support
the idea of elected regional assemblies, while 44% oppose them. If the
figures are added together for the whole of Britain, then it emerges
that 54% support assemblies while 41% oppose them.
Our survey also looked at the breakdown of support for assemblies by
each region of England. Here an even more interesting picture emerges.
All but two of the regions -- the South-east of England and East Anglia
-- show majorities in favour of elected assemblies for their respective
regions.
In the case of East Anglia, the gap between supporters and opposition
is as little as 3%. Only in the South-east of England, the bedrock of
Tory support, is the majority opposing an assembly clear. If Labour's
concerns over its policy were due to an apparent lack of public support
for its proposals, then this new evidence gives a clear answer: the
people of England have warmed considerably to the idea of regional
government.
But there is also a warning to Labour, in that support for assemblies
is at its strongest in those regions where it has considerable electoral
support: The North-east, the North-west, London, and Yorkshire and
Humberside. If Labour were to back down on its plans, the climbdown
would be least welcomed in regions where it cannot afford to lose seats
if it is to win a majority at the next General Election.
The message for Labour is further strengthened when we look at the
level of support for assemblies among its own supporters in England. In
all regions, 50% or more of current Labour supporters are in favour. In
fact, in four regions that support is over 60% and in two, London and
the North-west, it is as high as 70%. Current Labour supporters are
clearly not in the position of having to be convinced about elected
regional assemblies.
This level of support shows conclusively that regional devolution is a
vote winner for Labour.
The Labour leadership has already agreed that any process towards
English devolution will take place over a considerably longer time
period than that for any Parliament for Scotland. But is the idea that
has been put forward by Jack Straw, of regional assemblies as simply
quangos, democratically controlled, enough? If that was all the English
assemblies were to be, it would still entail a fundamental difference in
governmental arrangements for Scotland and England, particularly in the
area of tax-raising powers.
The danger here is that the West Lothian question might not be
dismissed so easily with the creation of English regional government.
Labour is in danger of missing the opportunity of finally putting that
ghost to rest if it does not legislate for assemblies which have teeth.
Also, if Labour is to be taken seriously on its wishes to reverse the
process of centralisation in local government, then it must give thought
to devolving those powers to the English regions which go beyond quangos
which it has recently mentioned, such as returning grant-maintained
schools back into the hands of local elected representatives. The
challenge to Labour is a simple one. Is Labour really the party of
decentralisation and devolution by principle?
But there is a potentially even more significant picture from our
study that drives to the heart of the Conservatives' strategy on the
Union and devolution. When looking at the level of support for elected
regional assemblies among current Conservative supporters in England, we
find a considerable problem for John Major.
In five regions, support for elected assemblies is above a third of
Conservative voters. In all of the regions it is over a quarter. Even in
those regions where there is still overall opposition to assemblies, the
South-east and East Anglia, the pattern is telling for the
Conservatives. In the South-east, support among Tories is at 32% and in
East Anglia it is higher still at 39%.
In other words, even Conservative supporters are not massively opposed
to the idea of regional government. In the North-west, the South-west
and in London over 40% of Tories would support an elected assembly for
their region.
This holds out considerable difficulties for a Conservative Party
pursuing a strategy which involves using opposition to devolution as a
key means to securing a fifth term in office.
The Conservatives have assumed that the Union card, played at the last
election, was in part responsible for the increase in their share of the
vote in Scotland. However, the Tories also made up some ground in 1992
in the North of England.
The real explanation in the revival of Tory fortunes lies in the
relatively better economic position that Scotland and the North of
England occupied in 1992. In Scotland, the average change in
unemployment between 1987 and 1992 was a 2.4% drop, while in the North
of England there was also a drop of around 1.8%. But in the South of
England it was almost 1% higher.
Economic position, not the Union card, offers the best explanation of
the small Tory revival. Yet Conservative strategists both in Scotland
and in England are continuing an attack on the opposition parties which
is increasingly out of step, not only in Scotland but now also in
England itself, and even among its own supporters.
Earlier in the year John Major told the Scots to wake up and stop
themselves from ''sleepwalking'' to disaster. Are English voters now
also doing the same? Mr Major's words may return to haunt him.

The survey
* THE Public Opinion and Local Citizenship survey is co-directed by
Malcolm Dickson, Strathclyde University, and Professor Bill Miller of
Glasgow University. It is funded by the Economic and Social Research
Council as part of its #2.5m Local Governance Programme. Its programme
consists of 27 projects involving more than 100 researchers in teams
spread throughout the UK. Overall co-ordinator of the programme is
Professor Gerry Stoker, Strathclyde University.
The Public Opinion and Local Citizenship survey is a study of
attitudes towards the objectives, structures and basis of local
governance. It consists of a 20 to 30-minute interviews with a
British-wide sample of electors, already in progress, a sample of
elected local government councillors and samples of appointees to
training and enterprise councils, Local Enterprise Companies, and
regional and district health authorities and boards. The interviews with
councillors and appointees will take place over the next four months.
The results presented here are based on the sample of electors. A
randomly chosen sample of 1241 electors throughout Britain was
interviewed using sophisticated computer-assisted telephone interviewing
techniques which can measure the conditionality and pliability of
attitudes. The interviews took place over an extended period from early
December 1994 to March 3, 1995.
This extended period is designed to lessen the effects of large news
coverage of local government issues at any one point in time on the
overall pattern of attitudes, therefore making results more reliable.
The margin of error applicable to a random sample of 1241 is plus or
minus 3%.

THIS latest cut proposed at BBC Scotland, this time in the resources
area, is only one in a series, nearly all of which have been portrayed
as the last that the incumbent Broadcasting Council for Scotland will
accept however grudgingly! It would be foolish to pretend that every cut
is, ipso facto, deeply damaging to the future ability of the institution
to function effectively but there comes a point when that position is
reached. I fear that time is now.
Since the heady days of 1979 and the imminent prospect of a Scottish
parliament there has been a continuous bleeding away from Scotland of
money and resources by the BBC in London, back to London. Without
setting loose a covey of accountants there is no way of knowing
precisely how much, but I am confident that the value cumulatively, and
at constant prices, is of the order of #15m. In the intervening time,
add RPI indexing and licence fee growth attributable to that initial sum
and today's value of #25m might be the result.
Of course some money has come to Scotland over that period to fund new
programmes and projects but it is my judgment that there has been a net
outflow of #15m to #18m annually from Scotland by comparison with that
available for Scottish programming in 1979, which we might regard as the
high water mark.
What is the effect of this process of financial attrition? In reality
it has meant a steady but unrelenting reduction in the number and range
of programmes being made specifically for audiences in Scotland. For
actors, musicians, writers, cameramen, wardrobe people, make-up men and
women it has meant at best less work, a move to an area like London
where there is more to be had, or worse redundancy and casual
employment, or leaving the industry all together. It is sometimes
forgotten that the BBC is the major cultural patron in the country, far
more than the Arts Council. Boiled down to basics we are talking jobs,
and well-paid ones at that.
Had the additional money been left in Scotland there would still have
been a need for changes in working practices as new equipment and
techniques came forward, and like every other industry there would still
have been redundancies in the continuing drive for greater productivity.
However the critical production base would have been much bigger now.
Until 1993, however great the demand for cuts from London, the
ultimate decision as to how and what to cut was a decision taken in
Scotland; London set the sum to be delivered but not the detail.
In January 1993 John Birt became director-general and in one of his
first acts removed from Scotland its historical right to manage in every
area of activity, save transmitters which has always been a centralised
function. It was a cunning move and entirely within the Charter which
has always contained the inherent flaw that it wills the end in relation
to Scotland but not the means to achieve it.
With hardly a whimper of discernible protest, except for one
resignation from the BBC's General Advisory Council and no public
comment from either the Scottish Governor of the Broadcasting Council,
the course was set which would lead to the demise of virtually all plant
facilities and personnel except those required for the provision of
news.
The process is already under way. Drama production now funded by the
London Controllers and commissioned on their behalf, by BBC Scotland, is
now to be made with freelance crews, many of them casualties of previous
cuts. In the short run this casualised labour force will produce at
lower cost, thus temporarily providing the justification for the too
rigid application of Birt's Producer Choice. Such a policy will serve
him well. He is seen as strong and resolute, the BBC as cost cutting and
more efficient and ringing once again to the smack of firm management.
More cuts will certainly follow for real or questionable reasons and
with the staff and plant already gone it becomes steadily easier to stem
or altogether cut the money flow. Ah! but the BBC has set quotas and
targets for ''Regional'' production, says London in its defence. ''Trust
us, give us time to deliver, but in the meantime we must cut your
resource base.''
The two positions don't square. If London is sincere in its desire to
see more programming, even for the network, from Scotland, then in what
studios and with what staff? Or is this all to be done by independent
producers in London, Manchester, or wherever. The uncharitable might be
inclined to the view that the front and hind legs of this pantomime
horse require to work together for the act to succeed. Oh! and the plain
disbelieving will point out that of course the commitment is to
''regions'' not to Scotland.
Let us assume that the BBC obliges Scotland to shed its resources as
planned, and that the programme monies come to Scotland as promised.
Will there be sufficient to sustain a Scottish-based independent sector
willing to bear the overheads, such as the training of young people for
the future, essential to the long-term survival of the industry here. Or
will the independents, dominated by London production houses cutting
costs to the bone to win contracts and thus defray their large London
overheads? In that kind of climate what future for the small
''boutique'' producers with a commitment to Scotland? The Jameson
experience in radio is an awful precedent for the future.
What about training the young men and women of Scotland for a future
in the industry, supposing there is one that is? Take make-up as an
example. Throughout the industry BBC training is held to be the standard
and most of the make-up artists in the business have had BBC experience.
Until now a young Scot with an ambition to work in television got some
training and work in hairdressing and applied to the BBC in Scotland for
a post as a trainee. They were appointed following a competitive
interview and given a mixture of work and on-the-job tuition under
senior staff. They were also sent to the BBC Make-up School in London.
After that they could apply to work inside or outside the BBC in
Scotland. So in this new order, what is an ambitious Scot to do to get
on in make-up? Well reading Harpers and Queen (March 1995) might help,
for there they will find an advert for the BBC make-up school (it's
after the ad for Caribbean hols Daahling) and if Daddy is rich and
willing to pay for your training and your stay in London you too can be
a BBC make-up artist Daahling! With the closure of the Design Department
goes a loss of opportunity for the young graduates of Napier and the
Glasgow School of Art. Is this great organisation to be founded on
recruitment by such methods? And is the whole approach a recipe for
short termism?
What of that watchdog, the Broadcasting Council for Scotland? What has
it to say for itself and what about the new National Governor, the Rev
Norman Drummond -- what is he saying? Well nothing much in public
anyway. Apparently he has given up the day job to make this new
appointment full time. Well he had better get cracking before the
brokers men have dismantled the fabric of BBC Scotland or, as well as
having nothing to say, he will have nothing to do, except to put the
lights out.
And the council, what should it be saying and doing? Stop weeping
silently into its Chardonnay would be a start. It should endeavour to
reverse the 1993 decision of Birt's to centralise control of resources
in London, for down that path lies the devastation of the Scottish
infrastructure. It should seek an independent review of the programme
demands and the resources required to make them here in Scotland. A
policy based solely on a UK strategy is no answer to the problem.
There has also to be a policy for Scotland taking into account its
ability to sustain the effort. As the Broadcasting Council for Scotland
has the responsibility for the long-term success of public service
broadcasting in Scotland it has to be satisfied that its future is safe
in Scotland. The BBC Governors are not impervious to reason even if
their director-general might be.
If such a request for an independent review were turned down, then the
BBC in London will have put itself beyond reasonable argument. The
council will have done its duty and could resign with dignity and
honour. All Scotland would respect that action and understand it.

MY family went to the cinema multiplex in Clydebank to see an
inoffensive film about a tame seal. They put 10p on a ticket to go
towards the forthcoming Comic Relief fund-raising for African charities.
At the front counter there were notices urging me to buy a T-shirt
(for #12) for Natural Born Killers (a particularly controversial film by
Oliver Stone) from which the ''profits'' would be donated to Comic
Relief.
My astonishment at this piece of crassness was only compounded by the
fact that there was indeed some (unintentional) comic relief when I saw
the T-shirts (which glorify the so-called M and M killings) being sold
by the girl selling the M and M pick and mix sweets.
Maybe I have missed the subtlety in all this, but in a place
aggressively exploitative towards children and families (check out the
price of Coke and popcorn) as this chain of cinemas, I somehow doubt it.
We are ruled by very strange forces.

I WAS vexed to read of the financial problems of The Big Picnic.
This was an excellent show, enjoyed my many, and one can appreciate
the high costs involved, particularly with such a short run.
I'm sure the organisers would have lessened their burden if they had
not handed out so many freebies.
I am not envious. I believe in value for money, and this certainly

brittle and little in connection with the original major novel.
As far as the stage adaptation seen at the Citizens' is concerned,

IN HIS article, Pot overdose for sad old dopeheads (March 4), Keith
Bruce states: ''For years medical science consisted of bleeding people
and applying leeches, but Western civilisation appears to have grown
through that phase.''
Leeches are used in microsurgery because their saliva contains
anti-coagulant enzymes which thin the blood and prevent it clotting.
This can save, for example, fingers and ears that have been severed and
reattached.
Maybe it might be an idea to laugh at silly things our ancestors did
that weren't a good idea.

UNEMPLOYMENT is continuing to fall sharply and is now below 2.5
million at a three-year low. That is good news but it still leaves more
than 8% of the population out of work, a solid performance compared with
most of the EU, but still unacceptably high. So far, however, the
improvement has not spawned any marked upturn in earnings, which have
also been outpaced by productivity. Were the various trends to be
maintained, those out of work would be around 1.5 million by the next
General Election. That may not make much of a political difference: one
of the curiosities of political life since 1979 is the way in which
unemployment has ceased to be the issue it was then and before. It was a
big issue in 1979 when the Tories profited famously from ''Labour Isn't
Working'', the Saatchi and Saatchi poster campaign. Thereafter it died
as it worsened and the official statistics were relentlessly
''improved'' in a way which understated its extent. The significance of
that history when it ceased to cost votes is that future political
benefits from falling unemployment may simply not transpire to boost the
Government's electoral fortunes.
This was part of what the Chancellor meant yesterday when noticing
himself that a return of the famous ''feel good'' factor of the 1980s
was unlikely to occur and affect political behaviour this side of the
millennium. In that respect it may be that the extent of unemployment is
less important than the fear that its possible extension promotes. The
changed nature of the economy -- in which more jobs than ever before are
outside manufacturing -- means that many who did not previously consider
themselves vulnerable to unemployment are suddenly as exposed to it as
workers in manufacturing industry which is itself, as British Aerospace
showed yesterday, still shrinking. This widespread insecurity may help
to explain the stagnant housing market which persists in spite of house
prices being cheap in relation to earnings and where mortgage costs, in
spite of the latest interest rate increases, are well down from their
peak four years ago.
What may transpire, however, is a marked reduction in public borrowing
-- for social security payments, stemming from unemployment in one way
or another, are an enormous part of Government spending. In fact the
public finances could conceivably move firmly into the black in time to
allow the Chancellor to cut income taxes without having to cut public
spending massively first, a possibility he was too cautious even to
mention yesterday. That at any rate is the Tory dream. Their recurrent
nightmare is that inflation could be back in time to ruin their one
claim to success in its containment. In fact the statistical evidence
shows it still being held firmly in check. The same fears which affect
the housing market are still restraining consumers more generally. One
month retail spend figures are up, the next month they have fallen back
a bit. There is certainly nothing like a boom in evidence and next month
sees another round of tax increases which will reinforce popular
caution.

<RECORDNO>979370123</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NEW evidence about English attitudes to the possibility of regional
assemblies has just emerged from a survey of popular opinion carried out
by researchers in the universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde. Their
findings discovered a narrow but clear majority in favour of such
assemblies in England, alongside much bigger majorities in Scotland and
Wales. In the UK as a whole the majority is 54%. Only two English
regions were opposed -- East Anglia narrowly, and the South-east more
strongly. These findings come at a time when Labour, which has proposed
such assemblies as part of its far-reaching proposals for constitutional
change, seems to be back-tracking on the possibility. Mr Blair has
certainly given that impression, while the man in charge of the
proposals, Mr Straw, is known to be sceptical of them. Another change of
tack may be in prospect, unless the latest findings are to be dismissed
as maverick.
Labour probably decided to go for assemblies in England because it
felt its Scottish and Welsh proposals, which responded to national
sentiment, would otherwise have looked lopsided and left the party open
to claims of inconsistency. It does seem, however, that the way in which
assemblies would devolve power from Westminster also appeals to English
opinion, especially outside the South-east where Westminster is not
remote. Were such assemblies, like that proposed for Scotland, also to
enjoy modest tax-raising powers, their appeal might be even further
enhanced. Mr Major, who has campaigned strenuously against the concept
in all its aspects on both sides of the Border, may simply have the
wrong message. He may even have misunderstood the reasons for his own
electoral success in Scotland in 1992: he attributed this to playing the
Unionist card but might instead have benefited from the way in which the
Scottish economy was doing better then than the South and South-east
which were far more affected by the recession. The Tories also did
somewhat better in the North of England which was hardly likely to have
felt the Unionist argument to any extent, if at all.
All of that suggests that there will be a fierce battle on the
constitutional issue whenever the General Election takes place. Labour
may be best advised to stick to its guns and fight for its original case
which has intellectual cohesion and, it would now seem, far more appeal
than was previously thought. The Tories, for their part, will notice
that the majority for assemblies, in England at least, is still slight
and that in these matters the argument is everything, and can affect
opinion considerably. Those who remember the debate in Scotland which
preceded the referendum of 1979 will hardly need reminding of this point
-- support for John Smith's proposals ebbed during that debate until
only a very thin majority was left. Both sides will find encouragement
as well as doubts in this latest evidence, even if more findings are
required to confirm its status as a trend, and not just a blip.

IT WOULD, I expect, have been galling for most of the population to
read the article entitled, Fury over Sinn Fein funds (March 10). The
perversity of President Clinton's decision is exacerbated by Gerry
Adams's action in the European Court against the Government -- for which
he is receiving legal aid yet may be able to receive compensation of up
to #20m -- for barring him from mainland Britain.
The military wing of Mr Adams's party has already cost the British
taxpayer heavily -- the murdered civilians, the murdered soldiers, and
the financial backing afforded them; the destroyed equipment and
buildings; the extra precautions needed by VIPs. Now he seeks to gain
more for his own use.
His claim in the courts is being backed by a civil rights
organisation, Liberty. No doubt a spokesman for Liberty will soon be
pontificating about how Mr Adams's rights were violated and abused.
Could Liberty please tell everyone a little about the rights of the
murdered people and their families, a little about why Mr Adams cannot
be banished from Britain but the IRA victims can be banished from life,
and a little about the morals of Liberty's stance given the immorality
of Mr Adams's stance.
The Government was correct to refuse Mr Adams the right to enter the
mainland and sneer at the nation.
His case is reprehensible and one must wonder why he is doing it if he
is at all committed to the peace process. His, and Mr McGuinness's
constant sniping and carping, would make anyone suspect him of trying to
provoke the British Government into withdrawing from the peace process.
The British Government would get the blame -- what would Mr Adams get?

FROM London, I would be ill-qualified to comment on developments in
Scottish education. Such consideration does not appear to inhibit Dick
Louden in his question-answer column in Education Herald.
The three reasons he gives for the number of schools in England
applying for Grant-Maintained (Self-Governing) Status do not stand up to
close examination. Over 1000 schools have become grant maintained --
including almost one-quarter of all secondary schools in the country.
Over half a million English pupils are educated in grant-maintained
schools.
While many schools face financial difficulty, the proportion in the GM
sector is much smaller than that in the council-maintained sector. And
we know of no GM schools finding it difficult to obtain governors. Only
about one-tenth of the schools that sought GM status had been threatened
with closure or reorganisation, which cannot -- by any stretch of the
imagination -- amount to ''most''.
Indeed a recent survey by the Times Educational Supplement has
demonstrated that 90% of grant-maintained schools reported that the main
reason for opting out was to increase their autonomy. Over 80% reported
that their schools had gained additional staff, better in-service
training for teachers, new buildings, and a higher level of
refurbishment.
In short, self-governing status is good for teachers, parents, and
pupils.

THE Lord Provost's prize of #12,000 for a painting by a living artist
is, as Clare Henry indicates, an imaginative move by the district
council (March 13).
In choosing from the selection of six pictures at present on display
at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, she states that the public will be taken
into account at every stage.
But the secrecy of the voting at Kelvingrove is open to abuse as there
is no supervision and voting forms are freely available. So any
individual can vote many times for the same artist.
Perhaps a fairer and more practical way to obtain a democratic choice
would be to limit voting to an interested cross-section of the public,
eg members of Glasgow Art Gallery and Museums Association.
Then one member, one vote could be achieved.

is part of a syndrome which includes ill health, poor levels of
education, criminality, cultural beliefs, and hereditary and familial
failings. Curing this catalogue of problems will be difficult if not
impossible.
I have emphasised that ill health increases all the way down the
social scale, as Professor Watt states, and is therefore not really
related to material wealth, and conversely cannot be reversed by
improving material wealth alone.
Despite Dr Burns's denial that he implied political failure, the fact
remains that whenever this subject is aired there is an undercurrent of
political blame. I have tried several times to point out that this
problem has no simple answer and certainly did not appear magically in
1980.
Dealing with it will require the efforts of many agencies over and
above the Government and I am afraid that as the potential for improving
one's health by better diet, exercise, and using the facilities of
preventive medicine increases, the gap between those who have a care for
their health and those who do not will get steadily wider.

I AM sorry Mike Veitch had to rush into print about loyalty and Jimmy
Allison (March 10).
Loyalty in my opinion is a two-way street, and how much loyalty was
shown to Jimmy Allison when he was forced to resign and was gagged into
the bargain after many years of loyalty to a party which treated him so
shabbily.
I also was a member of the by-election team, albeit an octogenarian
foot soldier, and while I got on well with Mike Veitch and two of the
three other ''staff'' members, the man in charge was something
different.
I have seen many election defeats and victories in my 60-odd years in
the party, and the loss of Govan reminded me of the disaster in
Springburn about 1935 when Keir Hardie's brother, George, lost by 34
votes. All the workers including me were greeting, and I wept also at
the loss of Govan.
Our subsequent reversal was due to a good local team and candidate and
loyal support from our many comrades from other constituencies. It
restored my faith in the future to see so many young people from the
universities.
When the polls closed after the by-election the Walworth Road team
disappeared like snow off a dyke and it was left to three ''wrinklies''
to clear up the mess in the rooms -- 35 bags were filled with unused
material under the eye of a TV team who sought, unsuccessfully, to film
us in our misery.
I wish Mike Veitch well in his work, and hope he will never suffer the
same fate as Jimmy Allison.

THE cuts announced by the BBC have caused much concern but some of the
criticism of the Broadcasting Council for Scotland would be better
directed at the BBC in London who have drawn the National Governor, the
Rev Norman Drummond, and the Controller for Scotland, John McCormick,
into the trap of negotiating the detail of an unreasonable proposition.
The detail has reprieved the major studios in Glasgow and Edinburgh
but at the cost of increased redundancies and a 30% cut in resources.
There are cuts in agriculture, religion, and gaelic. There is no
indigenous comedy and no contingency fund. BBC Scotland could not cover
a catastrophe or a General Election. The juggernaut of Producer Choice
will soon sweep away the reprieved studios; then there will be nowhere
to hold Election Night Special anyway.
There was another course open to them. They could have accepted their
share of cuts and promised more efficiency savings but only as part of a
strategy for BBC Scotland -- one which, unlike these proposals,
co-ordinates both programmes and resources and is designed to make the
most of the new opportunities for BBC Scotland contained in the White
Paper on the BBC.
They wouldn't have stood alone. The Chairman of the BBC, Duke Hussey,
has twice in the past year pledged a better deal for BBC Scotland. Mr
Lang, Secretary of State for Scotland, has publicly given his support.
The Department of National Heritage set it out in policy terms which
Parliament almost unanimously approved. No more support should be needed
in a democracy to bring change in a public body like the BBC.
Yet the White Paper is almost one year old and there is still no
strategy for BBC Scotland. Instead of planning for new opportunities, it
is forced to make cuts which pre-empt them.
The BBC has sought and obtained from the Broadcasting Council for
Scotland, approval for its fait accompli. This legitimising process has
caused great conflict between the loyalty of members to the local
management and their duty to the public.
The council should call a special meeting and adopt a policy of ''no
strategy, no cuts'' as a way of confronting the BBC with its own
pledges.

ONE of the most heartening recent developments at Excelsior Park has
been the announcement that Granby, a part of Courtauld Textiles and a
leading manufacturer of women's underwear for Marks and Spencer, is
building a new factory there.
The facility is being developed in a joint venture with Wimpey
Property Developments Ltd. It is first-class news for many reasons, not
least of which is the fact that Granby could have chosen quite a
different area.
That would have been a major blow. The company has been producing for
some time from a three-storey Victorian building at Wishaw which was
proving more and more unsuited to modern needs. At one stage it is
thought to have been considering a move to the North of England.
It already has three other UK factories, one in Morecambe, one in
Wales, and a Nottingham warehouse. It was vital to keep the 220 jobs
already here and, says Gordon Smith, head of Industrial Development and
Estates at Motherwell District Council, that is what has been achieved.
The fact that expansion possibilities could see the number rise nearer
300 is a further bonus. As Granby Chief Executive Robert Hart says,
''The new factory will not only help to secure the jobs of all our
existing employees, but will enable us to achieve a rapid increase in
production, creating jobs for a further 50 people.''
Work has already started on the 32,000 sq ft factory, which will cost
about #2.5m and should be ready by the summer. It is one of the first
bespoke developments in the whole of the Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone.
East Yett was opened only last September by European Commissioner
Bruce Millan, in a move which recognised the importance of European
Union money in providing vital infrastructure for the various
developments within the zone.
The benefits of Enterprise Zone status at Excelsior Park are one
reason why companies are already moving into the six advance factory
units on East Yett.
The other is its location.
It is handy for Scotland's motorway network, with the M8, M74 and M73
only a few miles away, and has good access to its main airports.
Enterprise Zone status means a rates-free period lasting until
February 2003, along with simplified planning procedures and possible
tax incentives. And the units at East Yett are modern, insulated
buildings of steel portal construction, with 6m eaves, finished to a
high standard and with integral offices on two floors.
Wishaw and Motherwell are only two miles from Excelsior Park, which
means a strong labour pool is available with significant manufacturing
skills and experience.

THINGS are moving fast at Excelsior Park, Motherwell District
Council's new industrial estate designed to create a wealth of jobs in
the Wishaw area.
Even as the first three companies completed preparations for moving
into East Yett, the highly successful first development at this
Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone site, two major announcements last week
confirmed that the estate can look forward to an exciting future.
The first was that a second development of 3.3 acres is to go ahead,
with nine units scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. The
second was the icing on the cake that the Royal Mail is negotiating with
the council to develop its Scottish Distribution Centre at the park,
extending to 12 acres and creating a further jobs windfall.
The second speculative development is to consist of 55,000 sq ft, with
the nine units contained in four individual blocks, their sizes ranging
from 5000 to 10,000 sq ft.
Negotiations between Motherwell District Council and the Leeds-based
property developers Micklegate Special Projects went into their final
stages just over a week ago, and that is good news for an area where
jobs have been scarce since the collapse of the old steel, engineering
and coal industries on which local communities had become so dependent.
It is also a further endorsement of the district council's policy of
pulling out all the stops to attract industry to the area, largely
through its industrial development and estates department and the good
offices of elected officials.
There is no hiding the pleasure, either, at the Royal Mail's plans.
Councillor Harry McGuigan, chairman of the Economic Development
Committee, considers that this, and the second phase now announced, are
a strong indication that the council's economic development objectives
are gradually being fulfilled.
''The units continue our policy of providing medium to large
accommodation to attract growing business,'' he says. ''It is critical
that we build on our success at East Yett, where the interest in the
units has been overwhelming.''
The district council, he says, is prepared to extend the type of
leasing arrangements which many ambitious companies require these days,
as it feels they are necessary at this stage to make sure that the
potential of East Yett is fully realised.
''More companies are beginning to appreciate the quite outstanding
opportunities which are on offer in Motherwell District, and are eager
to capitalise on these,'' he says.
''It is through initiatives such as East Yett and the new speculative
development that long-term jobs, rewards, and improved quality of life
will come to our district and our people.''
The further development of Excelsior Park was perhaps to be expected
in the light of East Yett's success.
Already three companies are in the process of moving in to this
self-contained area, which is situated at the eastern corner of the
park.
One of them, A J Transmissions and Conveyors Ltd, has taken one of the
biggest units on offer at 10,000 sq ft to cater for its continuing
expansion.
As a major supplier of conveyor belts to the food, chemical,
agricultural, textiles, electronics and other industries throughout the
UK, it already knows the value of a base in this particular area and is
moving from its previous headquarters at the nearby Etna Industrial
Estate.
Its managing director, Mr Archie Johnstone, has seen his company grow
from virtually a one-man start-up in the centre of Motherwell in 1980 to
one which moved to a 3000 sq ft factory at Etna only a year later. It
took over an adjoining unit two years after that to double its size, and
now it is nearly doubling it again.
Like all good businessmen, he attributes his success to customer care
and after-sales service. But he also pays tribute to the location: an
ideal distribution centre to all points north, south, east and west for
his fleet of vans.
He also feels Motherwell District Council has been of great help in
smoothing the path, and is glad he took the decision to stay in the
area.
Another company which clearly values East Yett's transportation and
communications advantages is Supply Direct, which is taking a 5000 sq ft
unit and moving into the area from Stirling.
It is also expected that East Yett and the second development at
Excelsior Park will attract the attention of companies whose business is
in medical supplies and related activities, due to the fact that a new
general hospital is being planned just a stone's throw away from the
zone.
Companies from manufacturing, the service sectors, and food might also
find the location ideal and others are expected to follow from the areas
of textiles, sport and leisure, and electronics.

GRAEME Sim worked for a scaffolding company in the construction
industry for 12 years until three years ago when he became a victim of
the recession and was made redundant.
He attended a management development programme on unemployment
training at Paisley University after which he turned his attention to
finding another job, however, after some time he was getting nowhere.
The thought of working for himself had crossed his mind, but where
would he start?
''Franchising appealed to me because being a first business venture I
was coming in on an already proven success and I didn't have to go out
and do everything myself. The risks were reduced and there was support
from the franchisor,'' he said.
Graeme had looked at three franchises and settled on Chem-Dry because
he felt they had a more professional approach: ''They were quite happy
to supply me with names and addresess of those who had joined them and
encouraged me to speak to them about the franchise.
''I felt it important for me to speak to those who were currently
doing the work. They are the people who have put out their money and
know exactly what the business is like,'' he said.
Graeme did not lose sight of the fact that the franchisor was trying
to sell him something and he sought to find out all he could about the
company while also taking advice from various professional bodies.
''Most reputable franchisors will be keen to meet you and I visited
the company's headquarters near Hull. Company representatives also met
me at home to discuss the business,'' he said.
For the Chem-Dry franchise, Graeme Sim had three-and-a-half days
training at the company's headquarters. He had bought his own van for
the job and after the training period he loaded up with the kit and
headed for home ready to start. He has to pay a monthly service charge
which is a fixed amount and he is not tied to his turnover. He also has
to buy the company's cleaning materials.
The franchisor has established a company that is dedicated to
negotiating national cleaning contracts. They allocate work to
individual franchises on a rotational basis.
Graeme has now been in business for a little more than a
year-and-a-half and is finding business good. His expectations and those
of the franchisor far exceed the potential that each thought was
available.
But now that Graeme is his own boss is he finding that he is putting
in a lot of hours?
''Business is a bit seasonal, at Christmas time I found I was working
seven days a week, however, there are times when business is slacker but
generally I find myself steadily employed.''
Graeme's franchisor provided him with a business plan that gave a
cashflow forecast and which can be useful to those who require finance
from the bank.
Chem-Dry has become a leader in the carpet and upholstery cleaning
market. Attractive to many because it is home-based and does not have
the overheads associated with some businesses.

STATUTORY Instrument No: S180, the innocuous-sounding name of a new
piece of legislation that comes into effect on April 1 this year, will
have a significant effect on all commercial building occupiers, owners
and developers in Scotland.
The Non-Domestic Rating (Unoccupied Property) (Scotland) Regulations
1994, to use the wider name, means that empty property will become
subject to Local Authority rates.
Before trying to understand the implications of the change in the law,
and the reasons for that change, we should look at the detail of the
legislation.
From the relevant date, unoccupied property will be liable for the
payment of rates at 50% of the full rate after that property has been
empty for a period of three months.
The principal exclusion from the charge is industrial property, which
will continue to be relieved of rate liability when empty. Also excluded
is property with a rateable value of less than #1000, property subject
to a Building Preservation Notice or included in the Schedule of Ancient
Monuments; Trustees acting under a Trust Deed for Creditors or in an
Award of Sequestration or the executors of a deceased person are not
liable and receivers and liquidators are also excluded.
Effectively, property with a rateable value in excess of #1000, which
is not for industrial use, will be liable for the 50% figure if it is
unoccupied for three months or more.
So, who will this affect? First, we should feel sorry for those
companies who, on the back of booming business in the 1980s, took on
extra accommodation in anticipation of growth, only to find they have
had to retrench as a result of reduced markets. These companies will now
be liable for half rates on any property which they do not occupy.
Companies that perhaps amalgamated and either moved into one partner's
accommodation, thereby releasing the other, or, even worse, moved into
new accommodation and put both original properties on the market, will
now be liable for the 50% rates charge on their vacant accommodation.
Developers and institutions that own property which is unlet or loses
tenants will also be affected with the result that there may be a
slowing up of speculative development.
I have no information on the amount of money which might be raised as
a result of S180 but I suspect it will be very small in comparison to
the total rates bill. The effect on individual companies could, however,
be dramatic and it is the most vulnerable companies that will be worst
hit, ie those companies fighting to survive by trying to reduce the
amount of space they occupy.
I would like to know what was wrong with the previous system and why
this change has been introduced.
Before March 31 this year, local authorities did have the power to
charge rates on empty property. Most local authorities adopted a
common-sense approach. To be exempt, good cause had to be demonstrated.
Some authorities, Strathclyde in particular, took the view that
industrial property represented good cause and property that was being
properly and actively marketed satisfied the good cause requirements.
This was, surely, a sensible and entirely appropriate response.
Any suggestion that a property was being kept vacant, deliberately,
resulted in rates being levied.
The only justification I have heard for the change of approach has
been harmonisation with England.
As most ratepayers will know, a Unified Business Rate (UBR) took
effect in England with a separate UBR in Wales from 1 April 1990. In
Scotland, we retained our individual regional rates in the pound and for
most of the Scottish regions these rates were significantly higher than
in England and Wales. From 1990 to 1994, the gap has narrowed and we
should recognise the efforts of the Secretary of State in achieving this
by providing sufficient subsidy to fund the difference.
Hand in hand, though, there was a reduction in the level of industrial
and freight transport derating allowance. But, as from April 1 this
year, Scotland will have its own UBR, at 43.2p, exactly the same as in
England.
England has had the empty rates charge for many years, indeed since
the time of the Centre Point controversy where it was considered that a
developer deliberately kept an office block vacant so that he could take
advantage of a period of escalating rents and capital value.
But is an empty rates charge relevant in today's economic climate?
I believe that no-one involved in property, whether as a developer,
landlord or tenant, seriously believes that anyone would deliverately
keep accommodation off the market. Even if this had been done in the
past, the good cause provisions would have catered for the situation.
It seems to me that,in order to get the advantage of the Scottish UBR,
we are having to accept the penalty of this 50% rates charge on empty
property.
The tragedy is that in England there is now evidence of property being
vandalised in an effort to avoid this penal charge. Landlords in England
are deliberately stripping out services, toilets, etc from large
properties with the intention of rendering the property incapable of
occupation and therefore free of the rates charge.
Is this what we want in Scotland? Will this help our econony? Above
all, will it help to get empty property occupied. I doubt it very much
indeed.
So, Mr Lang, with many thanks for securing what your predecessors
failed to secure -- parity with the pound rate in England -- I would ask
you to remove this iniquitous proposal to charge empty property rates.
It risks undoing all the goodwill achieved by the creation of a UBR and
could badly affect those companies least able to afford it.

Surveyors, was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

ING, the Dutch rescuer of Barings, last night announced a new board of
directors for the UK merchant bank group that excludes Barings' former
top executive directors.
It said in a release the new directors of Baring Holding Company were
three officers from ING, Hessel Lindenbergh, the new chairman, Onno van
den Broek and Lane Grijns.
ING also listed the new directors of Barings' three main operations,
its banking arm, securities business and asset management operations.
It said that, pending an investigation by the Banking Supervision
Commission into Barings' collapse, Lindenbergh, van den Broek and Ted de
Vries from ING would serve as directors of the banking arm, Baring
Brothers.
ING said it was providing its own directors for Barings'
newly-revamped securities business, Barings Securities International --
Lindenbergh, van den Broek and Lane Grijns.
The only operating business to retain Barings' former senior directors
as directors is the asset management side, where John Bolsover, the
chief executive of Barings' former asset management subsidiary, is to
serve as the new chairman.
ING said each new board of directors would delegate management power
to a management committee.
Peter Norris, the former chief executive of Barings Securities and a
member of the board of Barings, was conspicuously absent from the list
of 12 individuals who will serve on the new Barings Securities
management committee which will include former directors of Barings and
ING officers.
Mr Norris has come under focus as investigators try to determine how
Nick Leeson, Barings' former derivatives trader in Singapore, got
hundreds of millions of pounds transferred from London to Singapore to
help cover his trading losses.
Also absent from any management committee was Peter Baring, former
chairman of Barings. ING said he was one of six members of a new
committee advising the board of Baring Holding Company and providing
liaison between its businesses.

FOR the thousands of Scots enduring the daily grind commuting between
Glasgow and Edinburgh, the magnificent sight of Murrayfield stadium
emerging to the side of Corstorphine Road is a heartwarming sight,
rekindling proud memories of a famous Grand Slam in 1990, and, no doubt
inspiring thoughts of this Saturday's crunch match at Twickenham with
the Auld Enemy.
When you consider that construction on Scotland's now familiar
national rugby stadium only began as recently as March 1992, the
logistics involved in planning, designing and co-ordinating such a large
project -- within the time constraints imposed by a tight SRU calendar
-- take on massive proportions, demanding suppliers that will design to
order and deliver on time.
These two factors have proven integral to the success of this week's
TrailBlazer, Glasgow Brickyard Limited, which supplied the 500,000
custom-made bricks used in the creation of the stadium, and form the
basic philosophy for a company which has grown to become Scotland's
largest brick distributor within the space of 10 years.
Glasgow Brickyard Limited was founded by co-directors Ken Kelly and
Tom Brodie in 1984 from a stockyard just off the M8 in Glasgow, with
little more than the precise vision of where the company was going and
what was required in the way of customer service to achieve it. As Ken
explained: ''Having worked in the building industry for many years, Tom
and I understood the hassles involved for customers in trying to select
bricks, where they were forced to leaf through brochures for hours, or
hold their doors open with bricks because the office was cluttered up
with sample panels.''
Managing director Tom Brodie added: ''With the customers' needs very
much in mind, we were then able to design our new premises. This meant
building a vast library of bricks that allows them to actually visualise
how the bricks will look and perform in situ, and gives our customers
hands-on experience with Glasgow Brickyard products.''
The inventory, in the order of one million bricks -- no mean feat
within an industry suffering a national shortage -- means Glasgow
Brickyard can offer customers a stock holding and just-in-time delivery
service which is second to none.
More than a decade on, Glasgow Brickyard operates two additional
divisions, Technical Brick Services (TBS) and Brick Transport Services
(BTS), and prides itself on a just-in-time policy which aims to deliver
bricks anywhere in Scotland within 24-48 hours of order.
TBS, based in Bridgeton, was set up to cater for customers who require
a tailor-made brick design, and is geared to solve contractors problems
with the manufacture of non-standard bricks. The lead time on ''purpose
made specials'', such as the bricks used in the construction of
Murrayfield, can be as much as 10 to 12 weeks, compared to an industry
norm nearer six to eight weeks. TBS's target maximum is five days.
Brick Transport Services was set up in May of last year and has
already exceeded the directors expectations, providing an intrinsic part
of the quality service provided by Glasgow Brickyard Limited. BTS's
fleet of eight specialised crane vehicles all vary in size and
applications to allow flexibility and further reassurance for customers
that BTS will deliver the right bricks to the right place, and at the
right time.
To guage the success of Glasgow Brickyard's operation, one only has to
look to the company's financial statistics which show a 60% increase in
turnover from #4.2m in 1993 to a projected #7m in 1995.
The service provided by Glasgow Brickyard has secured some lucrative
names amongst its customer protfolio, including Tesco, Hill Crest
Housing, Persimmon Homes and the Govan Housing Association.
Despite some ''big name'' contracts, however, Kelly and Brodie are not
about to stand on any laurels and have tailor-made bricks for the
smallest projects, from private housing to custom-built fireplaces.
Ask the directors what gives them the biggest buzz from the job, and
they will say, ''A satisfied customer with repeat business''. It is the
simplicity of this philosophy and the company's willingness to invest in
making it work that will ensure the company continues to grow.

TWO massive property schemes which are oceans apart in name, are
already trawling in the same waters in the hope of winning new tenants.
This week's announcement that site clearance has started on Atlantic
Quay phase 2, on the Broomielaw, is the opening shot in a battle between
two developers.
As predicted exclusively in The Herald on February 16, the new
development partnership of Pillar Property Investments and Bellhouse &amp;
Joseph is poised to develop a further 133,000 square feet of new office
space at Atlantic Quay.
If the scheme goes ahead this year it could catch the tide of
post-recessionary tenant demand ahead of its rival scheme on the other
side of the river, Pacific Quay, which is located on the former Glasgow
Garden Festival site.
The developers at Atlantic Quay are building on the success of the
first phase, which attracted a wide range of occupiers at top rentals
just before the property bubble burst and the rest of the scheme was put
on hold.
Glasgow is now very short of top-quality, open office space with the
large floorplates favoured by many tenants. Almost one million sq ft of
quality space was taken up last year, which leaves 400,000 sq ft of
modern space available in the city. Most of this space has floorplates
of under 10,000 sq ft.
None of the available quality space is in buildings larger than about
40,000 sq ft.
''We have identified current requirements in the city for around
700,000 sq ft of quality space and have a number of potential tenants
talking to us at the moment,'' says Ed Bellhouse of Bellhouse &amp; Joseph.
After the success of phase 1 he is convinced that occupiers are now
happy to consider Atlantic Quay as part of the city centre. He rejects
suggestions that the rival business park scheme across the river at
Pacific Quay could damage tenant interest in Atlantic Quay, saying that
the river and the Kingston Bridge act like a city wall in defining
Glasgow's business centre.
This view is rejected by his rivals at Pacific Quay, joint developers
Miller Developments and CTP Ltd, who are putting the pieces into place
to start work on their business park development. Phil Miller of Miller
Developments says: ''Glasgow is short of business park space and we are
offering major location opportunities on an inner-city site. We'll be
able to provide low-cost business space, close to the motorway, with
plenty of car parking. I can't think of any other site in Glasgow which
can rival this one.''
Although Miller Developments and CTP are playing their cards close to
their chest, they are secretly hoping that a new bridge will span the
Clyde just upstream from the controversial Bell's Bridge. This would
link Pacific Quay with the city centre via Broomielaw or the Clydeside
Expressway and provide occupiers at the business park with the facility
of avoiding the Kingston Bridge.
Only two or three years ago business parks like Pacific Quay's and
office scheme's like that at Atlantic Quay would have been attracting
very different types of tenant.
But when Mercury decided that its Scotish HQ could be located on a
business park in Lanarkshire, rather than on a prestigious city-centre
site, the writing was on the wall. Offices and business parks are now in
direct competition.
* Meanwhile, the developers at Pacific Quay have chosen MGM Cinemas as
the operator of a nine-screen multiplex cinema which will seat around
2300 patrons and feature the latest technology, with digital sound in
all screens.
The #5m project should create around 70 jobs. Subject to planning
permission, work is expected to start on site later in 1995 with the
opening scheduled for the middle of next year.
Development underway at Goodyear site
CONSTRUCTION work has started on a #21m retail development on the
former Goodyear tyre factory site at Drumchapel. Great Western Park, as
the scheme is titled, will be anchored by a 10,000 square fet B&amp;Q
superstore.
The site had lain derelict and unused for more than 20 years since the
closure of the Goodyear factory.
A total of 180,000 sq ft of retail warehousing will be constructed on
behalf of developers Chartwell Land. Occupants already committed include
B&amp;Q, General George (Allied Carpets), Cantors, Harvey's, World off
Leather, and Pet City. A further unit is under offer to Olympus Sports.
One other unit remains unlet.
On another part of the 54-acre site, Ramjet Developments is building
48,000 sq ft of fast food and leisure facilities. A food superstore and
light industrial accommodation is also scheduled for the site at a later
stage. In total, the projects on the site are valued at over #40m.
David Coleman, development director of Chartwell Land, paid tribute to
the supportive action of the local councillors and people of Drumchapel.
''They were able to share the vision of economic regeneration which was
presented to them. Their support has ensured that a practical and viable
scheme has been initiated on this site, which should prove of lasting
benefit to the local community.''

SPIRITS and retailing giant Allied Domecq says that trading over the
Christmas period was in line with expectations with total volumes moving
ahead.
Ballantine's, Canadian Club, Courvoisier, Kahlua and Beefeater showed
growth. Although Teacher's gained market share in the UK but was hit by
difficulties in the Eastern Bloc.
The devaluation of the Mexican peso has been met by higher prices in
that country.
Retailing saw a 2% rise in the total take in pubs despite a fall in
the number of outlets.
Allied has made the statement as it is changing its financial year to
one of 18 months until August 1995. It has released the results for the
12 months to September 17. These show pre-tax profits of #638m.
On May 16, it will announce figures for the 12 months (the old
financial year) to March 4.

PUBLISHING giant Reed Elsevier increased pre-tax profits last year by
16% to #620m helped by a rise of 1.8% in operating margins to 21.8%
which chairman Ian Irvine explained as the leverage brought about by
quite modest increases in revenue.
Overall turnover of the Anglo Dutch company climbed 9% to #3035m with
the biggest improvement being seen in the professional market with
strong demand for legal publications from the Butterworth's subsidiary.
Reed is entitled to an effective 52.9% share of the attributable
combined group profit because of its 5.8% indirect holding in Elsevier.
The Lexis-Nexis on-line electronic publishing acquisition, which cost
#971m, brought in #37m of sales and #9m of profit in its first month
under ownership. Its 1995 prospects are good and it is expected to
exceed pre-acquisition hopes.
In the UK, the underlying profit in business magazines was more than
60% up on 1993, with particularly strong growth in high-margin
recruitment advertising.
The improvement in the UK advertising market appeared to be
sustainable and Reed Business Publishing expected further growth in
1995.
Reed Regional Newspapers had a record year, due to the strengthening
domestic economy as did IPC Magazines with a 23% improvement in
operating profits after circulation and advertising revenue showed
strong growth.
During 1994 Reed completed the task of adding Official Airlines
Guides, acquired from the Maxwell receivers, to its ABC International
business.
Operating profits in the business travel division rose 40% despite
continuing difficulties in the airline industry and with as yet little
benefit from recovery in the hotel industry.
Reed Consumer Books showed a small decline in operating profit with
the lack of consumer confidence leading to subdued sales and book
retailers reducing their stocks.
The profits included a net #14m of exceptional items arising from #40m
as a final instalment from its sale of the BSkyB holding offset by #26m
of property losses.
Dividends for Reed International shareholders rose 15% to 21.5p with a
14.8p final, covered twice by earnings.

THE pound had an initial boost on the foreign exchanges yesterday
after a 1.2% rise in retail sales in February proved a little more
optimistic than the overnight CBI survey had indicated.
But that was soon dampened by the lower-than-expected 3.5% increase in
average earnings which pointed to no change in base rates in the short
term.
However, the main feature remains dollar weakness so the pound
finished the day up by well over one cent to $1.5999, although against
the German mark, it sank to yet another new low of DM2.2221-- a setback
of over two pfennigs. The trade-weighted index slipped 0.3 to 85.0.
The mark was in substantial demand across the world while the US unit
was again hit by the Mexican crisis with the strong US economic data of
little avail in supporting the currency.
This coincided with concern that the Federal Reserve may not raise US
interest rates for some time yet while there would also be pressure from
the continuing strength of the Japanese yen.

THE UK's largest holiday group Thomson enjoyed a record performance
last year with pre-tax profits exceeding #100m for the first time, its
parent company Thomson Corporation said yesterday.
It said 1994 had marked the 20th consecutive year that Thomson Tour
Operations had been the leader of the UK overseas tour market and the
company was now almost certainly in its strongest position ever.
The number of holidaymakers travelling with TTO increased by almost
500,000 to 4.1 million, giving it a quarter of the total market.
The company also benefited from strong sales early in the season which
enabled it avoid heavily-discounted late season selling and it made
greater use of resources with hotels and aircraft filled to very high
levels.
Thomson said 1994 had also been a very good year for Britannia Airways
with higher profits and passenger numbers. The number carried reached a
record 7.9 million.
Its travel agency chain Lunn Poly was another success story with sales
climbing to #1250m.
The group said its other principal operation in the UK, Thomson
Regional Newspapers, had generated substantial operating profit growth,
based on solidly-rising revenue and a tight control of costs.
Canadian-based Thomson Corporation boosted earnings last year to
#270.3m.

ENGLISH China Clays took something of a drubbing yesterday, dropping
21p to 338p after results for last year which were roughly in line with
most market expectations.
The concern appears to centre on its Calgon business in the US where
there has been pressure on margins reflecting the more difficult
conditions as control of environmental legislation is pushed down from
Federal to state level.
Operating profits from the continuing activities rose 22% to #110m
thanks chiefly to strong performances in the European paper and ceramic
industries.
However, and more positively, speciality chemicals and minerals are
generally steadily improving and English China Clays has enjoyed a
satisfactory start to 1995.
Pre-tax profits rose 5.8% to #93m compared with #87.9m in 1993.
As already forecast at the time of the de-merger of the Camas
construction materials subsidiary, ECC shareholders will receive a 10.9p
final dividend for a 16.25p total and will in due course be paid 3.75p
on their Camas shares to maintain overall income at 20p.
The yield on ECC shares, without Camas, is an attractive 6%.
Earnings per share were little changed at 20.05p.

NORTHERN Electric has done an about-face over the prospect of a
freshly contested bid from Trafalgar House, now graciously conceding
that it should be allowed to go ahead before the normal 12-month
exclusion period enforced after a bid has lapsed.
But there is the proviso that a new offer should await the outcome of
electricity regulator Professor Littlechild's pricing review of the 12
regional electricity companies following his intervention at a critical
time for Trafalgar's original #11-a-share bid and also the sale of the
Government's remaining stake in National Power and PowerGen.
Professor Stephen Littlechild's review could come as early as Friday
week which is the deadline for him to tighten controls but he does not
have to specify what the new controls will be until the end of June.
Holding out until then would certainly prolong the insecurity in the
industry.
Trafalgar House had urged the Takeover Panel to allow its fresh bid of
#9.50 a share to go ahead anyway. The Panel can do this if the bid
recipient company has agreed that a hostile bid can be made within the
normal 12-month waiting period.
However, the Takeover Panel, announced last night that the rule
''should not be waived in the present circumstances'' and ''therefore
Trafalgar House should not be permitted to make its proposed #9.50 per
share offer at this time''.
Trafalgar has appealed against the decision to the full Panel and it
is expected it will be heard on Friday.
Northern's chairman, David Morris, was no doubt influenced by
Trafalgar's evidence that over 50% of Northern shareholders have
indicated their support in principle for a new bid to proceed. It is,
after all, the shareholders who own the company, not the board.
Northern's move was welcomed by Trafalgar but it does not see why it
should have to wait upon the regulator.
As it is, Northern Electric's share price, while recovering on revived
bid hopes with an increase of 44p yesterday to 833p, still stands well
below Trafalgar's #9.50.
Northern Electric insists that there is still enough certainty despite
Littlechild to reject a revised #9.50 offer as an undervaluation. It
had, though, accepted Trafalgar's original offer despite the sudden
worries injected by a new electricity price review. It was natural
enough in the transformed climate that Trafalgar should have decided to
lapse its #11-a-share offer (worth #1230m in total) and try to rebid at
a lower level.
Of course, it is not known what Professor Littlechild's new prices
regime will involve, perhaps not very much at all at the end of the day,
but given the unusual situation that has arisen, shareholders should
surely have been given the opportunity to judge Trafalgar's proposed new
terms without them being arbitrarily dismissed.
Making its case against any delay, Trafalgar argues that the
regulator's June proposals will be followed by a two-stage consultation
process and that Northern's response to the proposals may itself result
in a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It also says
that uncertainty is a constant element in stock markets and that the
removal of one unknown would not preclude others from emerging.
Naturally Trafalgar said that the only fair way to protect Northern
shareholders' interests and resolve market uncertainty is to allow a
revised bid to proceed immediately.
In the meantime the regional electricity companies (Recs) have opted
to continue with the proposed flotation of National Grid, the
electricity transmission system, after their meeting yesterday. National
Grid's board is made up of executives of the 12 English and Welsh Recs.
Professor Littlechild, though, has also thrown this into doubt with his
electricity prices review. Plans for the flotation were due to be
finalised at the end of this month.
The Recs seem determined to go ahead, although no detail of their
thinking were given yesterday, but some in the industry believe
flotation may have to be delayed until next year though September is
thought a more likely date if postponement proves necessary.
Hopefully, much of the uncertainty over both the Grid and Northern
Electric will be dispelled tomorrow week unless the regulator does
intend to twist the knife further.

THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS, a new series by Harry Conroy, takes an
in-depth look at just where Scotland stands when it comes to enjoying
the economic benefits behind the pop hits, films, television soaps and
drama.
THERE has been no lack of Scottish pop groups and singers in the
charts in recent years with Wet Wet Wet, Runrig, Deacon Blue, and Simple
Minds all making it big.
But despite these successes Scotland is still classed as an exporter
of the raw material in the shape of singers and musicians who are then
packaged and sold in London with most of the economic benefits flowing
from this process remaining in the South East.
In musical industry terms, Scotland is little better off than Third
World countries such as Brazil who supply the coffee beans that go to
make the drink which keeps wealthy Manhatten going.
Today, four professionals have come together to form the Scottish
Entertainment Alliance in a bid to halt the process which leads to
promising Scottish talent using only London based professional advisers.
The founding members of SEA are Walter Hecht, joint managing partner
of Walkers, the Glasgow based chartered accountants, Brian MacBride, of
MacBride, Munro &amp; Company, Glasgow solicitors and Eric Longley of CAs
Chantrey Vellacott and Nigel Dewar Gibb of Jens Hills solicitors, both
London.
Explaining why two of the firms should be London based Nigel Dewar
Gibb says: ''For a start I am a Scottish solicitor who happens to work
in London but I spend a lot of time up here and it is important that
Scottish firms tap into the experience which has been built up in
London.''
Eric Longley, the other London-based member of the Alliance originally
hails from Cardiff, and has a long experience is the music industry
having been manager of groups such as Happy Mondays and New Fads.
''I have travelled around the country with groups and found it
difficult to understand why everything was centred in London,'' says
Eric Longley who, as a tax accountant, has advised stars such as Stevie
Wonder, Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones.
The four came together at seminars in Scotland dealing with the music
industry, and gradually the embryo of the idea of forming the Scottish
Entertainment Alliance began to take shape.
''Our aim is to provide legal and financial expertise for the
entertainment industry in Scotland by combining our specialist knowledge
so that entertainers can receive the professional services they require
here without feeling the need to go to London'', explains Walter Hecht,
whose firm already act as accountants to Wet Wet Wet.
The hope is that if entertainers use Scottish firms for their
professional advice then there will be a spin-off in other activities
stimulating growth in the provision of studios, lighting, record
production, and merchandise such as T-shirts.
There is a dearth of statistics regarding the industry in Scotland but
there is an estimated 35 to 50 Scottish record labels already in
existence but their combined turnover is less than #10m. This pales into
insignificance when compared to the #1.54 billion of UK record sales.
Commenting on Scotland having such a low share of the economic
activity surrounding the music industry Walter Hecht says: ''Hopefully
our initiative will encourage other sectors of the industry to do the
same, thus generating employment in Scotland and encouraging economic
growth.''
Brian MacBride, whose firm works for the Musician's Union in Scotland
said: ''Most of the contracts signed by Scottish entertainers are
written in the law of England. We will be working towards having more of
these contracts written in Scottish law.''
Business administration courses related to the music industry are at
present been run at West Lothian Further Education College in Bathgate
but many of the young people completing their studies find that they
have to go to London to seek jobs in the entertainment industry.

An unique competition for managers asked them to look at the big
issues facing Scottish business. Here, Douglas Boyd, managing partner of
KPMG's Glasgow office takes a look at the published findings.
ASK any of the acknowledged pundits in Scotland about the big issues
facing the business community such as education, exporting,
entrepreneurs or management skills and you would get the answers you may
well have seen before.
But what if you ask the senior management of tomorrow, the people who
are currently still growing and developing their ideas and skills -- do
they have the same opinions or will they come up with some surprises?
The Scottish Executive Challenge took managers from both private and
public sector organisations and threw them together as teams of complete
strangers to answer some of the key questions that face the Scottish
business world, with the emphasis very clearly on providing workable
solutions.
Their findings make interesting reading.
Keeping the Scots in Scotland
Surveying personnel managers of major employers, IBM employees and
other leading business people, the team asked the questions of them.
Significantly, of the 160 responses the principle disadvantages of
Scotland were thought to be the climate, distance from major markets and
business centres. Others were a lack of employment opportunities and the
strong, inherent parochialism of Scottish people.
To reinforce this, career opportunities were cited as the overriding
reason for leaving Scotland.
As a result, the team could find thousands of ex-pat Scots, many in
top drawer jobs around the world but how could their experience be
turned to the advantage of Scotland?
Recommendations:
On the Government side a marketing campaign to promote Scotland,
Co-ordination of development agencies and the launch of ''Year of the
Exile'' to learn from the experiences of well travelled Scots.
In the business community the launch of a centre of excellence through
development agencies; as the infrastructure for the Information
Superhighway is in place, encourage businesses to utilise the facility
as a method of doing business; encourage an international perspective.
Through education Scots must continue to raise the general standard of
education through the curriculum; encourage use and exploitatiion of
information technology; change the learning environment to encourage
risk-taking and forward-thinking.
Scottish Business in Europe
Acknowledging that to survive Scottish businesses must look to
exporting this team however felt that, based on the evidence they
gathered, small and medium-sized companies are failing to perform in
Europe (seen as rapidly becoming a ''domestic'' market for Scots) and
warned that they would continue to underperform unless a range of
measures are put in place.
Recommendations: Companies must be hungry to export and the key to
this is to create an export culture which would be encouraged by the
creation of local export circles, using successful SMEs as role models.
Appropriate funding should be available on attractive terms. The early
stages of exporting make heavy demands on working capital, the
recommendation was to create a Scottish Development Bank to provide
finance on attractive terms to those companies with exporting
aspirations.
Entrepreneurial Encouragement
Why do relatively few Scots set up their own businesses? This
project's aim was to encourage more to do so.
Looking at some fundamental issues such as Scottish culture, education
and industry and networking, they examined the pressures on the young.
All of which suggest that starting a business is not a good idea.
Widening it out, they interviewed business start-up advisers, owners,
teachers, careers advisers and parents.
Recommendations: Local entrepreneurial role models should be developed
and parents should be involved in the process of changing attitudes.
Accepting that education is vital to changing culture, a range of
ideas were suggested such as introducing management and information
studies at Standard Grade or developing a computer business game for
schools, and strategic ideas such as tying in the aims of the business
birth-rate research into the aims of the education system.
Building on the current Young Enterprise programme to take the best
projects beyond school; introduce an enterprise badge in Scouts/Guides;
develop an ideas creation mechanism in schools to complement the current
business simulation exercises.
Can Scotland learn from foreign management styles?
Surveying key managers across Scotland this team discovered that there
is no real Scottish style, rather it is seen as British but that no one
country has really developed a uniquely successful style, rather the
elements for success are international.
Recommendations: They concluded that there were 10 essential elements
for enterprise; clear vision and direction, two-way communication,
consultative leadership, risk-taking, learning from mistakes, selecting
the right managers, embracing diversity, rewarding innovation,
empowering individuals and continuous improvement.
It was also felt than an alliance should be developed with university
business schools to develop modules which focus clearly on these
essential skills.

A VERY solid and reliable set of results is what the sector craved and
was duly dealt by Schroders, which can now claim without much dispute
the acme of the merchant banks.
Although pre-tax profits last year were almost unchanged, down
#400,000 to #195.4m, there was a move to quality with the fund
management side rising by 50% to #85.4m.
Funds under management increased 9% to #57.6bn by the year-end and are
now probably over #60bn and within touching distance of the Warburg's
Mercury Asset Management subsidiary, Britain's largest.
As pension fund trustees are reluctant to move unless there is
substantial under-performance, investment management represents a
reliable long-term source of earnings.
Merchant banking saw record performances in treasury and trading
outside the US, where the setback in bond prices on higher US interest
rates earlier in the year caused widespread unhappiness throughout the
industry.
The securities business in Europe and Asia also incurred losses,
partly reflecting reduced volumes, but corporate finance had a good
share of what was available, with involvement in 92 transactions.
Chief executive Win Bishoff said there had been some difficulties
immediately following the Barings crisis with some withdrawals of
deposits, although these have been replaced leaving the overall position
little changed.
The family and management hold more than 40% of the equity, so
Schroders is generally considered an unlikely bid candidate.
It would prefer to grow its business rather than to acquire -- there
have been rumours that it is interested in buying Smith New Court,
although the clash of cultures may could prove a major deterrent to any
get-together.
Average pay rose during the year by #9000 to #70,000 for the 3380
staff.
The dividend total has been raised 24% to 20.5p with a 14.5p final
covered five times by earnings. A one-for-scrip issue is proposed to
reduce the heavy share price -- it rose 38p to 1478p yesterday.

BRITISH Petroleum chairman David Simon received a 20% increase in his
base salary to #431,000 last year whereas the company's other directors
were granted just 3% -- recognised to be in line with current industry
pay levels and general economic factors, writes ANDREW WILSON.
However, Mr Simon did not receive more, at his own request, when he
succeeded Robert Horton after the boardroom coup in April 1992. BP has
since shown a dramatic improvement in performance.
Mr Simon's total emoluments, including a #325,000 performance bonus,
have risen 24% to #763,000 according to the 1994 annual report.
Topically, it carries information about the group's use of derivatives
and its exposure which showed an almost neutral position on December 31,
1994.

SCOTS business leaders are to meet with the World Bank in Glasgow next
month to learn how best to capitalise on important new project funds
from the largest global provider of financial assistance.
Scottish Trade International is the organiser of a UK-wide Winning
Business Through World Bank Financing procurement seminar, seen as
consistent with its highly successful Scottish Export Assistance scheme.
STI director David Taylor said: ''We are all about promoting the
opportunities that derive from such programmes and the seminar is being
staged to help companies get on the inside track to source what
financial funding is available.''
The event, to be held on April 5 in conjunction with the Department of
Trade and Industry, will emphasise the significant export opportunities
that exist in a range of sectors worldwide, with particular attention
paid to procurement, consultancy services, and how firms can secure
payment.
It will be highly relevant to manufacturers, contractors, suppliers,
and consultants in various fields of work.
Paul Blanchet, World Bank senior business affairs advisor, will give
an overview of his organisation's general structure and purpose related
to project development financing, and how British companies can take
advantage of the bank's financial packages.
Other speakers will include Chips Westwood, from the British Embassy
in Washington, who will talk about assistance programmes available from
the World Bank/Inter-American Development Bank.

WHEN the world's largest soft play arena opens at Thurrock in Essex
later this year, first in the queue to shoot down the slides and dive
into the ball pool will be Ken Thompson and Bill Dempsey, who fought off
stiff competition to land the #500,000 building contract for their
Paisley company, Softlands.
The company, which employs seven people, is just one of the firms
which has already entered the Renfrewshire Business Awards.
Softlands was created by Mr Thompson and Mr Dempsey following a
management buy-out in 1993 of the soft play sector of the Andrew
Mitchell Group. In the fledgling company's first year, the turnover was
#350,000, that nearly doubled in 1994, and after only three-months
trading in 1995, Softlands turnover has already scaled the #600,000
mark.
Mr Thompson, whose own background is in marketing, said he and his
partner have the ability to key into a child's mind: ''We analyse
children at play. When other adults are watching, simply happy their
kids are having a good time, Bill and I get on the equipment ourselves
to evaluate how a particular item is used by each child and devise ways
of linking it with another piece so that children are challenged,
stimulated and exercised.''
The soft play industry has mushroomed over the past 12 years.
Previously used as therapy for children with special needs it
incorporates state of the art technology and materials.
Mr Thompson added: ''The 'Action Stations' arena we are currently
constructing at Thurrock with our associated company Zap Play is a #1.3m
development.''
Mr Dempsey, sales director at Softlands, is currently in Dubai to meet
potential customers.
Softlands is one of many companies entering Renfrewshire Enterprise's
1995 business awards venture. There are seven categories: Best New
Business; Best Growth Business; Young Manager of the Year; Marketing
Award; Export Achievement Award; Innovation Award; Best Skills
Development.

HIGHER demand coming on top of benefits from reorganisation carried
out during the recession has done wonders for Marley, the roofing tiles,
plastic pipes and car trim manufacturer.
''In 1994 the group made further significant progress,'' said chairman
Sir George Russell. ''Marley's strong competitive position and low
cost-base enabled the group to take advantage of the better trading
conditions that developed in our main markets.''
Underlying profits soared 61% to #47.8m for 1994, though this still
leaves them short of the peak seen in 1989. That was when Marley's
industry was dominated by boom and bust. Now chief executive David
Trapnell is hopeful the future will be less volatile, allowing the group
to show steadier growth.
This has certainly been the case in recent years for the plastics
business, which is the dominant activity. Its operating profits rose 7%
to #38.1m, while recovery in concrete and clay products provided the
profits powerhouse with a jump from #5m to #16.1m.
Margins in plastics were affected by a 40% surge in PVC prices as
prices could not quite keep track. These prices now look steadier.
Demand from housebuilders is mixed but Marley is aiming to introduce new
products and enter new markets.
It has acquired a plant in Hungary and set up sales operations in
Poland and the Czech Republic, which will be serviced from Hungary,
Germany and the UK.
In the Far East it has established itself in Malaysia and is hoping to
expand sales in the region, which was previously served by exports from
New Zealand.
South Africa is trading well after a slowdown before the election and
this is set to continue. The repair and maintenance market is strong and
increased Government spending on new housing will provide a further
boost.
Efficiency of the tiles and block business has been helped by
rationalisation, with 10 companies condensed into four and a couple of
plants closed. Higher demand enabled the remaining plants to run at
nearly full capacity, so benefiting margins.
Production rates can still be tweaked higher if demand continues to
improve, though 1995 is likely to be flatter.
Last year the tile market was up 9% and the block 18% while in America
the heavy building materials market was 4% higher, though Marley saw a
12% volume gain.
Gearing is down to 31% and Marley is on the lookout for acquisitions
within its core areas.
After a 24% increase to 2.6p in the final dividend, the total is up
from 4.2p to 4.7p.
Marley shares gained 6p to 136p and are a firm hold on a 4.3% yeild
and selling at 12 times earnings, which are likely to rise again this
year.
* HOLDERS of more than 53% of shares in the BES assured tenancy
company, Norcity Homes, have accepted the conversion offer from the
Norcity Residential Unit Trust in the first twelve business days since
it was launched.
Ross Macdonald of Neill Clerk Capital has written to shareholders
pointing out that remaining acceptances should be received by March 28.
Neill Clerk is behind the contested bid for another Glasgow-based BES
vehicle, Westscot Homes.

FROM football to vol-au-vents, success has come to Chris Robinson
through the same brand of management he demonstrates in the boardrooms
of both Hearts Football Club and his successful business Wheatsheaf
Catering.
The catering company is a business Robinson and his wife Elizabeth
began 17 years ago. Today, as one of Scotland's leading caterers, it has
come a long way from its first contract with St Margaret's School in
Edinburgh.
Through careful and calculated expansion Wheatsheaf Catering,
operating from Hopetoun House in South Queensferry, now commands the
specialist catering market in Scotland including Edinburgh Castle,
Culzean Castle, Royal Botanic Gardens, and Stirling Castle. In line with
Robinson's belief that over-expansion can ring the death knell in
business, it is only now that Wheatsheaf Catering is expanding into
another niche catering area -- the sport and leisure industry.
For success, according to Robinson, comes from operating within niche
markets. And on this topic Robinson together with Leo Barclay, of
Rannoch Smokery and Euan Shand of the Bennachie Scotch Whisky Company
Ltd will discuss opportunities within their industry during a special
Business Masterclass organised by Dunbartonshire Enterprise later this
month.
They will reveal how they built their successful businesses from
scratch while providing a refreshing yet enlightening insight into the
industry.
''The company's big break came with Hopetoun House. We concentrated on
delivering an excellent service which, in turn, earned us a very good
reputation. From there we took over the catering operations at
Scotland's leading heritage and historic centres,'' Robinson explained.
In the same vein, Rannoch Smokery was borne. In 1983 Leo Barclay and
his wife Sarah found themselves snowed in for two weeks at their
Perthshire farm. After digging their way out of the front door and
feeding their hill sheep flock the Barclays found quite a bit of spare
time on their hands.
''I decided to try smoking venison,'' Barclay recalls. ''During the
following three years many of our friends were forced to endure endless
'tasting' sessions before I tested the market.''
Rannoch Smokery was launched with Harrods as its first customer.
The Bennachie Scotch Whisky Company Ltd was set up following a
lifelong ambition of its managing director, Euan Shand. He grew up in
the shadows of Glendronach Whisky Distillery where Shand started his
career but would progress through several large and diverse
corporations.
However, the desire to own a whisky company never left and in 1992
Shand realised his ambition.
Today, with three superior blends in the Bennachie portfolio, Shand
has developed distribution links which include South Africa, Hong Kong,
Brazil, Thailand, Singapore and Paraguay.
* The First Steps Business Masterclass entitled ''Success in the Food
&amp; Drink Industry'' will be held on Wednesday March 22, 1995 at Glasgow
Caledonian University's Park Campus. For further information or to

IT is no surprise that D M Hall sponsors Western Union Cricket League.
After all, John Young, the partnership's senior partner was no mean
bowler with Uddingston CC.
He began his playing days alongside Mike Dennes who went on to play
for Kent and captain England.
Neither should it be a surprise to discover that the firm of chartered
surveyors handle a large number of golf club rent reviews and
valuations.
John's other sporting passion is golf and he is a member of three
clubs -- Bothwell Castle, Portpatrick and Prestwick. His home, he says
with some satisfaction, is only 150 yards from the first tee at Bothwell
Castle.
The sporting tradition is strong in the Young family with his daughter
Katie who recently joined the firm as a qualified chartered surveyor
also being a keen golfer and squash player.
But John has not let his sporting interests get in the way of
business.
D M Hall has expanded rapidly in recent years and in January opened an
office in Dumfries giving them a network of 22 throughout Scotland. The
firm now has a staff of 156 including 31 partners and is the largest in
Scotland in the field of residential valuations.
John joined the firm in 1970 to open their Glasgow office but the
rapid expansion did not come until the 1980's when: ''We realised that
we had to take our services to the community,'' he says.

THE Thistle and the Rose. Scott Hastings has been there eight times
before. The record thus far reads two wins, a draw, and five defeats. In
Hastings' book, though, the statistics count for nothing.
''When it comes to Blue on White it's a different ball game every time
we play. The history, the tradition, the nationalism which the matches
evoke among the supporters on both sides. That's what makes it special
every time that Scotland play England,'' he declared.
Hastings, who on Saturday at Twickenham wins his fifty-third cap, is
one of four Scottish survivors from the 1990 Grand Slam decider at
Murrayfield. Only brother Gavin, Craig Chalmers, and Kenny Milne were in
Scotland colours on March 17, 1990, when Will Carling and his men were
sent hameward tae think again.
Scott, who but for injury, had been a fixture in Scottish rugby
campaigns since he made his debut against France in 1986, was dropped
after last November's mauling by the Springboks. His pride was severely
dented. He reckoned that he wasn't the only Scottish player who had been
below par that afternoon.
Nevertheless, he paid the price of defeat and returned to the side for
the victory over Wales 12 days ago only because of the severe cheek
injury suffered by Ian Jardine at Parc des Princes.
But Hastings was already a graduate of rugby's school of hard knocks.
He had experienced Test and series success with Finlay Calder's British
Lions in Australia in 1989 but, with the British Isles tourists in New
Zealand four years later, he was invalided home with severe facial
injuries after only three games.
Last season, against France, he and Gavin won their fiftieth caps
together, but just eight months later, once the South Africans had done
their worst, Scott was out of favour and had to watch the Canadians and
the first two games of the Five Nations' campaign from the sidelines.
That was a difficult time for him. He was desperate to prove the
selectors wrong and his rehabilitation came not only after injury to the
unfortunate Jardine but after a successful outing with the A team
against Ireland.
''Coming into the side against Wales I felt like the new boy all over
again, but the rest of the lads were great. They made me feel as if I
was the missing piece of the jigsaw,'' he said.
Hastings maintains that he is not in an ideal position to compare the
1990 Grand Slam showdown with its 1995 equivalent. ''I played my first
Five Nations' game just over a fortnight ago and so I wasn't emotionally
involved right from the start. Even now, though, with just a few days to
go until kick-off I'm beginning to get butterflies in the stomach.''
He is, however, able to offer a comparison between the 1990 side and
the '95 vintage Scots. ''This side is more about all-round teamwork.
They're really working and winning for each other. In 1990 we were
really relying on a top performance each time out from the back row.
That back-row of Calder, White, and Jeffrey were a superb unit and the
game plan revolved around them.
''This time there is more of an all-round focus and it doesn't matter
whether you're No.1 or No.15, you're expected to be totally involved and
not just in your specialist role.''
The Scots are keeping both feet very firmly on the ground. Despite the
four wins this year, concentration has occasionally lapsed.
Hastings knows better than most that on Saturday Scotland cannot
afford to donate the early tries which they did against France and
Wales.
''The key word for Saturday is focus. Playing England is going to be
an awesome task and a totally focused performance from us is the only
thing which will beat them. It will have to be 101% concentration over
the entire 80 minutes. If we give them an inch then they will grab a
mile.
''We didn't quite do that against Wales. People are saying 'wasn't it
a super performance' but we know that we had a bad lapse in
concentration when we let Rob Jones score within a couple of minutes,
and we didn't take all of our chances in the second half. We're not
letting that win go to our heads.''
On Saturday, Scotland will endeavour to nip England's offensive
intentions at the bud. ''We have to stop them at source before they get
the chance to bring the centres and the wingers into the game. There
will be some big hits going in.''

DONNY Hogg started off in business as a screen printer 15 years ago
doing safety posters for discos in Reo Stakis establishments.
Donny is still into safety but now in a bigger way. His company
En-Sign Studios has come up with a new design of commercial letting
boards which he says are a lot safer.
''The traditional boards are constructed from timber, and could cause
a person or vehicle considerable damage if they were to become detached
from the building they were on and strike someone on the pavement
below,'' explains Donny.
En-Sign came up with a style of board which is ''considerably
lighter'' and would be unlikely to cause anyone an injury.
''My boards are made of polypropylene, and unlike the traditional
boards don't require a great deal to keep them in place.''
Now Donny's new-style boards are starting to pop up on the side of
offices to let around Glasgow as property consultants try them out, and
he has now patented the design.

THE Scottish rugby side is guaranteed at least one honour whether they
win, lose or draw in the Grand Slam showdown against England at
Twickenham on Saturday, writes Derek Douglas.
Edinburgh District Council agreed yesterday to stage a civic reception
for Gavin Hastings and his side to mark the success which they have
already enjoyed in this season's Five Nations' Championship.
The reception is to be held on April 20 and will be for the 26 members
of the World Cup squad and management going to South Africa in May.
Councillor Frank Russell, the council's management and administrative
services convener, said: ''Win, lose or draw on Saturday -- but
hopefully they'll win -- we'll be delighted to see the players and the
Scottish Rugby Union at the City Chambers next month.
''At least twice a year Edinburgh benefits greatly from a friendly
invasion of rugby fans. It seems an appropriate time for the capital
city to show its appreciation.''

ABERDEEN want Dundee United's Jim McInally to help haul them clear of
the bottom-of-the-table position which threatens the club's future.
The Dons' caretaker manager, Roy Aitken, already has made an approach
to United for the man who was once his Celtic team-mate.
And, while the Pittodrie team are short of cash, Scotland defender
Stewart McKimmie could come into the bargaining.
The swop between the two teams would be seen as part of a rescue
package for both.
Aberdeen are second bottom of the premier division while United are
just four points ahead of them in third-bottom spot.
The Tannadice team, who parted company with manager Ivan Golac on
Tuesday, have a game in hand, but their situation cannot be any comfort
to Gordon Wallace who has been asked to take over.
Yesterday, Wallace insisted that he is not in the market to sell
players -- but a swop deal could attract him.
Aberdeen made the approach before United's Scottish Cup quarter-final
defeat by Hearts. Since then, the turmoil at Tannadice has held up any
potential deal.
Motherwell have already tried to buy the veteran who can play a
variety of positions.
But, as well as his versatility, he has a grit and determination which
Aitken must introduce to his side if they are to escape from their
present predicament.
McKimmie, a member of Scotland's European Championship squad, has been
11 years at Pittodrie. He cost a bargain #100,000 from Dundee when Alex
Ferguson took him back to his home-town club.
Recently, however, the player -- who can play at full back or in
central defence -- has been a target for some of Aberdeen's support and
a swop deal before the transfer deadline at the end of this month could
be beneficial to both clubs.
It also would ease problems for Aitken, who has been told that he has
no money to spend as he attempts to escape the drop and land the job as
manager on a full-time basis.
Meanwhile, former Dundee United player Billy Kirkwood has been added
to the list of candidates for the Tannadice job. But suggestions that
the Ibrox coach has already been approached are off the mark.
* A GOAL by Peter Dwyer four minutes from time gave East Stirlingshire
the points against Montrose at Firs Park last night. The Angus side had
Craig Cooper sent off just before full time for a second bookable
offence.

GRAHAM Dawe expects to be fit to take his place on the replacements'
bench for England against Scotland on Saturday -- but his strained calf
muscle has given the selectors an unusual problem.
Dawe is No.2 hooker to Brian Moore, but the third and fourth-choice
hookers are now in South Africa to represent England A against Natal at
the same time as England challenge for the Grand Slam.
If Dawe remains a doubt, England must decide whether to ask Mark Regan
of Bristol or Richard Cockerill of Leicester to fly back from Durban to
understudy Moore. Or they could risk naming a hooker from down the
rankings for the Five Nations squad -- with the possibility that he
could play 79 minutes if Moore came off for the first time in his
career.
The lower-ranked candidates are novice hooker Gareth Adams (Bath) --
who was in the England emerging players front row last week -- or
experienced Wasp Kevin Dunn.
Normally an injury would be covered by whistling up an A team player
-- but not when they are 6000 miles away.

AJAX Amsterdam and Bayern Munich, both three-times winners of the
European Champions' Cup, set up an expected semi-final showdown
yesterday while holders AC Milan wound up with a surprise game against
Paris Saint Germain.
At Amsterdam, Frank de Boer scored with a swerving free kick in 67
minutes, as Dutch champions Ajax, who won the title three years in a row
from 1971, outclassed Hajduk 3-0 on the night following a no-scoring
first leg. Nwankwo Kanu, an 18-year-old Nigerian striker, headed Ajax
ahead in 39 minutes and defender De Boer headed the second five minutes
later.
At Paris, Vincent Guerin scored the winner in a 2-1 victory for PSG
after Barcelona, losing finalists to Milan last season, had taken the
lead. Jose Bakero put the Spanish club ahead, but Brazilian star Rai
levelled the game 18 minutes from the end.
At Lisbon, Milan, five times winners and hoping to tie Real Madrid's
record of six, reached the last four by holding Benfica to a 0-0 tie and
advancing on the strength of a 2-0 victory in the home leg. Benfica
striker Isaias Soares hit a post near the end and it rolled across goal
with no team-mate there. Apart from that, they rarely threatened.
At Gothenburg, Bayern Munich went through on the away goals rule after
a 2-2 draw, following a no scoring draw in Munich. Bayern had to play
with one player short after keeper Sven Scheuer was sent off for
tripping Mikael Martinsson in 20 minutes. Reserve keeper Uwe Gospodarek
went on and the Germans took off their Bulgarian World Cup star Emil
Kostadinov.
The Germans, who won the Champions' Cup in the three seasons that
followed the Ajax run, scored through Alexander Zickler (64 minutes),
and Christan Nerlinger (72). Substitute Mats Lilienberg pulled a goal
back in 77 minutes, but the game was deep into injury time when Mikael
Martinsson scored Gothenburg's second.

IT'S crazy of the Commons Procedure Committee to think about toning
down Prime Minister's Question Time. This was the view of a television
director I met last night in McSonachan's -- a view, incidentally, that
cost me two expensive bottles of Belgian raspberry beer, a Tequila
Sunrise and McSonachan's undisguised contempt.
''PMQT,'' said this gentleman, from inside what looked like a
second-hand rugby strip, ''has balls. It's in-yer-face television, the
only parliamentary stuff worth watching. Mind you it could be
improved.'' I asked how.
At the moment, he pontificated, there were only two kinds of question:
the Question from Behind and the Question from In Front. The first ran
''Would the Prime Minister agree that his smiles-to-camera outside No 10
display firmness of purpose and a good left profile?'' The answer to
this starts: ''I thank my Rt Hon Friend for his . . .'' etc.
This was pretty predictable. You could cover it in a fraction of the
time with an MP standing up and saying ''Question A'', to which the PM
would respond ''Answer B''. What was needed, said the TV man, was a
third kind of question, the Question from Nowhere. This would cover the
real issues that interest television audiences -- the gossip and the
scandals.
Just imagine, he said, an MP standing up and asking: ''Does the Prime
Minister know who is sleeping with whom at the moment, and will he give
figures and frequencies?'' Or how about this one: ''Will the Prime
Minister tell the House how he manages to find space for his backside
between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Home Secretary when he
sits down again?''
Celebrity, rumour, the minutiae of top people's lives. The ''Hello!''
magazine of the small screen. That's what people wanted. The ratings
would go through the roof.
I said, doubtfully: ''That wouldn't leave much time for the actual,
um, politics.'' Exactly, said my curiously-dressed informant.
* Funny name, Cordiant. This is the new one chosen by Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, the big advertising agency -- presumably to stop people phoning
up and asking to speak to Mr Saatchi or Mr Saatchi who, of course, were
kicked out and set up shop down the road.
''I think it must be one of those feelgood words,'' mused The Braces.
''A mixture of 'cordial' and 'antidote', which suggests all-round
heartiness with something that counteracts a poison.''
No, no, I said. It's a combination of ''corduroy'', suggesting
arty-farty jackets, with ''antennae'', which implies a sure feeling for
the market place. ''Rubbish,'' said The Braces. ''Nobody wears corduroy
jackets any more in decent-sized advertising agencies.''
Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, who has a
photographic memory, said that sure enough there is no word in her
dictionary between ''cordial'' and ''cordierite'', a mineral named after
P L A Cordier, 1777-1861, The Frenchman who discovered it. So in
choosing ''Cordiant'', she was sure the people at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi were
being much more subtle than we anticipated. Perhaps they were invoking
the name of Charlotte Corday, a famous Frenchwoman at the time of the
Revolution.
We asked: famous for what? ''She was the assassin who stabbed Jean
Paul Marat in his bath,'' she said. ''Marat could only write in his bath
because he had contracted a disease while hiding in the sewers. He was
buried with great honours in the Pantheon, but his body was turfed out
15 months later amid popular execration.''
Aha, we said, that sounds like advertising all right. Then we changed
the subject.

HANSON chief executive Derek Bonham yesterday pledged to wrongfoot the
City again with the conglomerate's next acquisition, during a two-day
trip north to brief Scottish institutional investors.
With its balance sheet strengthened by the forthcoming demerger of 34
non-core US businesses, Hanson has recently been linked with Yorkshire
Electricity, food manufacturer United Biscuits, and Argyll, which owns
the Safeway supermarket chain.
Refusing to disclose the sectors of the 20 to 30 UK and US companies
on Hanson's shopping list, Mr Bonham said: ''I think we have a great
ability to surprise the market. When it is thinking we are going one
way, we are going totally another.''
He said the recent comments about tighter price controls by
electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild, which have for the time being
scuppered Trafalgar's acquisition of Northern, did not mean Hanson would
not look at businesses in the sector.
Whatever the purchase, Hanson will be looking for value for money.
Mr Bonham said: ''You are always waiting for somebody putting their
foot in it, giving you an opportunity.''

FORMER Prudential chief executive Mick Newmarch has been cleared of
breaching the Stock Exchange's code on directors' share dealings but
Prudential itself has been found to have broken the exchange's listing
rules.
An ouspoken critic of the life companies' regulatory regime, Mr
Newmarch stunned the financial services industry by resigning on January
23, citing disagreement with the regulatory authorities. At the same
time it was disclosed that the Stock Exchange was investigating share
dealings in Prudential by Mr Newmarch.
Last October he exercised options and sold 208,750 Prudential shares
netting a profit of #202,000 just hours before a regulatory report on
the mis-selling of personal pensions was published.
A preliminary inquiry by the Stock Exchange's share listing department
considered Mr Newmarch had broken the rules but now after an appeal the
Stock Exchange's Quotations Committee has concluded that Mr Newmarch did
not breach the model code for directors. But the committee was critical
''of the way in which Mr Newmarch and the Prudential approached their
consideration of the dealings and the information available.''
Mr Newmarch was said not to have broken the code, which states that
directors must not deal in the shares of their company when in
possession of unpublished information affecting the company.
But Prudential was in breach of the listing rules in respect of the
clause which states that a company must adopt a suitable share dealing
code by board resolution and take all steps to secure compliance by
directors and employees who are likely to be in possession of
unpublished price-sensitive information.
Prudential is the largest life insurance group and the inquiry was a
huge embarrassment for a company which has taken such a combative
attitude to the regulators, controversially insisting it was not at
fault over the selling of pensions.
Yesterday the group said it was pleased with the finding that Mr
Newmarch's share dealings had not broken the Stock Exchange code.
''This confirms our view that neither Prudential nor Mr Newmarch were
in possession of information which was price-sensitive at the time,'' it
added.
However there was surprise that Prudential had been found in breach of
a listing rule. Chairman Sir Brian Corby said: ''They seem to be
implying that we didn't follow procedures but we were very careful about
this.
''As far as we are concerned we did take care. We believe our house
rules are adequate . . . so there is a degree of puzzlement.''

THE new Scottish National Squash Centre at Heriot-Watt University in
Edinburgh was opened amid a blaze of colour yesterday by Graeme Simmers,
chairman of the Scottish Sports Council, writes Elspeth Burnside.
With lime green walls and a topaz floor, the competition court
presents a spectacular showpiece to the facility, which includes another
seven squash courts, viewing gallery, and exercise rooms.
The show-court, with see-through front and back walls and permanent
seating for 150, is unique in Britain, and the development raises hopes
of Scotland staging a world-class event in the not-too-distant future.
Peter Nicol, Scotland's world No.5, just failed in his bid to mark the
opening of the centre last night with a win over England's world No.2,
Peter Marshall losing out 9-10, 9-4, 8-10, 9-4, 10-9.
Nicol has never beaten Marshall in a world ranking tournament,
although he has beaten him several times in exhibition matches.

NIGEL Spackman hopes his inspirational courage will persuade Chelsea
to offer him a new contract to end his career at Stamford Bridge.
The 34-year-old midfielder left his sick-bed to lead Glenn Hoddle's
European rookies past Bruges and into the Cup-winners' Cup semi-finals.
He admitted: ''I was feeling bad the whole game. I didn't think I was
going to make it.''
But Spackman was driven by the knowledge that time is running out to
add a European medal to his collection.
''I've won league titles with Rangers and Liverpool and they were
great times. But this was the best night of my career,'' he said. ''It
gives me great satisfaction because I know it's probably my last chance
to win something in Europe.
''It's a great feat to reach the semi-finals of a competition like
this. I never got beyond the third round of the European Cup with
Rangers, and during my time at Liverpool, English clubs were banned.
''Now I want to keep playing well because my contract's up at the end
of the season and I want to stay here.''
Hoddle has too few experienced players to let Spackman go and said:
''He was magnificent against Bruges. He's been in bed for five days with
flu and a stomach bug. But for 34, he's as fit as a fiddle. When you
have a strong mind, that takes over.''
Spackman, who resumed light training only the day before the game,
admitted he wanted to come off. But a knee injury to David Rocastle and
hamstring trouble for Scott Minto forced him to battle on.
''With the adrenalin going, the crowd behind you and the whole team
working for each other, you get through,'' he said.
''I think I do have a strong will. Graeme Souness said that about me
when I coped with being picked for Scotland and then withdrawn. Every
player dreams of playing international football and that was a big
knock-back for me.
''Graeme said I wouldn't let something like that affect me, but of
course you do. You just don't let it show.''
Now Chelsea hope Arsenal can complete an English one-two in Auxerre
and join them in tomorrow's draw to give the domestic game a fillip in
this difficult week.
''It would be great for English football -- and a great night if we
could meet in the final,'' added Spackman. ''But we know that if we want
to get back next year, the only way is to win this cup -- and that's
what we'll be trying to do.''

GLASGOW'S Eleanor Reid and the Stirling trio of Kerry Martin, Pauline
McLean and Forbes Dunlop head a disappointing Scottish entry for this
weekend's British Universities' championships at Crystal Palace, writes
Elspeth Burnside.
The event provides an ideal opportunity to impress the British
selectors for the World Student Games in Japan in August, but a variety
of circumstances have diminished the Scottish interest.
Richard Hope is currently in Lanzarote with the Scottish squad, while
Graeme Smith has his sights set on the European championships in Vienna,
an event that clashes with the World Student Games.
Another Glasgow contender, John Bradley, is still recovering from a
car accident. ''I think many have been put off by the prospect of having
to travel to London,'' suggested the British World Student Games coach,
Mike Peyrebrune. ''But I'm certain there will be a strong Scottish
influence on the final team.''

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns has been fined #1000 and banned from the
touchline until the end of the season by the SFA.
Burns had been called in front of the disciplinary committee because
of an incident at the end of the premier division match against Partick
Thistle in January, when he went into the referee's room to have words
with Bobby Orr.
Former Albion Rovers manager Tom Spence has been fined #300 and banned
from the touchline for one year because of his comments to referee
George Clyde after the third division match against Alloa on January 14.
As he is now out of football the ban will come into effect if he makes a
return.
Stenhousemuir manager Terry Christie has been severely censured for
his after-match comments to referee Graham Allison following a second
division game against Morton.
Selkirk keeper Kevin Massie has also been censured and given a
one-match ban after he left his goal and ran into the crowd at a game
against Gala.
But the committee, while warning him that this will not be tolerated
again, took a lenient view as he had seen a fan remonstrate with his
father, who had been ill, and Massie wanted to come to his aid.

RONNIE O'Sullivan completed an impressive 5-1 victory over Peter Ebdon
in the quarter-finals of the Kloster Thailand Open in Bangkok yesterday
and then admitted: ''I'd swop my Masters crown to win this title.''
O'Sullivan is taking nothing for granted, even though he is on course
for a top-four ranking next season.
''One or two players can still overtake me, which make events like
this far more important than the one I won at Wembley last month,'' he
stressed.
''There was more money at the Masters, but ranking points matter most
and while I can't catch Stephen Hendry at the moment, I've got to start
thinking of knocking him off the No.1 spot, sometime.''
The 19-year-old, still looking for his first ranking event victory
this season, added: ''This is the third semi-final of the season for me
in a ranking tournament so perhaps it's third time lucky. I must have a
great chance now of winning.''
It was Ebdon's seventh defeat in eight matches against O'Sullivan --
who produced breaks of 70, 62, 56, and 53 -- and conceded: ''I don't
think Peter likes playing me. He always gives me lots of chances.
''Perhaps it is something to do with the number of times we played
each other as amateurs. I always seemed to beat him then.''
O'Sullivan will meet either Tony Drago or Cliff Thorburn in the
semi-finals, and Ebdon said: ''Ronnie plays an amateurish type of game.
He takes on a lot of risky shots, but gets away with it because he is so
good. If he changed his style he probably wouldn't be the player he
is.''
Mark Johnston-Allen, twice runner-up in the European Open, reached the
third semi-final of his professional career with a 5-4 victory over
Darren Morgan.
The 26-year-old from Bristol, who tackles holder James Wattana or Gary
Wilkinson for a place in Saturday's final, lost the opening frame on a
respotted black but from then on was never behind. Results and details:
Quarter-finals -- R O'Sullivan (England) beat P Ebdon (England) 5-1.
Frame scores (O'Sullivan first): 89-25, 86-28, 0-116, 73-25, 73-41,
89-32.
M Johnston-Allen (England) beat D Morgan (Wales) 5-4. Frame scores
(Johnston-Allen first): 63-70, 76-51, 72-4, 0-76, 67-2, 18-73, 66-15,
50-68, 64-0.

SCOTLAND'S leading women's team has been selected en bloc to represent
Britain at the Youth Olympics this summer, writes Doug Gillon.
Nine of the Tryst Ladies club from Cumbernauld, all of them under 16,
will form the nucleus of the UK team which competes at Bath in July at
what will be the biggest ever sports gathering in Britain, surpassing
the number of competitors at the London Olympics of 1948, the
Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh (twice) and Cardiff, or the World
Student Games in Sheffield.
One Welsh and two English players complete the squad, whose coach and
manager are also from the Tryst.
There is no league structure for under-16s in Scotland, so the girls
have been playing against senior opposition. Despite this, the club has
already reached the British Cup semi-final this year, and the British
Handball Association has offered to stage the final at Cumbernauld on
May 13.
If sponsorship can be obtained, the BHA chairman, Jeff Rowland, has
promised the gate receipts will be given to the girls to help with their
preparations.
The Scots have been playing together from the age of 11, but the best
of the rivals whom they face at Bath will have been together from age
seven, according to team manager Melanie Menzies.
Their section includes several of the world's leading nations: Russia,
the Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Norway -- the last of these
being the women's world champions.
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council have made training facilities
available free to the team, and the European Handball Federation is
paying for leading German coaching guru, Armin Emrich, to come to
Scotland for three special coaching weekends which also will be attended
by the Welsh and English members of the squad.
But such dependence on outside help perhaps explains why Britain has a
100% failure rate to get any indoor team-only sport (basketball,
volleyball, handball) into the Olympics. ''We have leisure halls in this
country, not sports halls,'' said Rowland. ''It is virtually impossible
to get enough quality hall time to train properly.''

SKYE Camanachd's controversial Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup tie against
Oban Camanachd, already postponed twice, is to be played at a neutral
venue, writes Hugh Dan MacLennan.
A one-and-a-half-hour special general meeting of clubs and affiliated
bodies of the Camanachd Association decided that Oban were guilty of
''wilfully and deliberately'' misleading association president Duncan
Cameron in order to gain an advantage from the postponement of the tie.
But club representatives, many of whom had overcome atrocious weather
conditions to attend the meeting in Fort William, voted by 18 votes to
three against the ultimate sanction -- disqualification of the south
champions.
Stuart Jackson, Skye's second-team manager, had presented a document
detailing his club's version of events leading up to the postponement.
The key to the case was a complex sequence of phone calls between
association officials and the two clubs. Oban fixtures secretary Colin
MacDonald and president Duncan MacIntyre argued that their club had no
case to answer.
Oban took umbrage at the suggestion that they had misled the president
and insisted that they had done nothing outwith the competition rules.
They blamed association officials, and fixtures secretary John Willie
Campbell in particular.
President Cameron reminded representatives of the gravity of the
situation and the importance of the votes about to be taken. He said:
''There can be no appeal, and whatever sanction you decide to impose,
the decision is final.''
The first vote, on whether Oban had wilfully and deliberately misled
the president, was upheld by 12 votes to 9. On the second issue, of a
suitable penalty, the representatives predictably drew back from the
ultimate sanction.
0 Oban Camanachd were reprimanded, and instructed to play the tie on a
neutral venue, Spean Bridge, in the first instance, with Kingussie
ultimately being chosen for this Saturday. Ironically, heavy snow in
Lochaber and Badenoch make the prospect of play this weekend extremely
unlikely.
Clearly unhappy about the outcome, MacDonald said he intended to take
legal advice on the allegations that he had misled the president.

MANY small business people have had a mountain to climb when it comes
to starting their business but Deborah Campbell has had more than most,
writes HARRY CONROY.
To get her started she had to climb 10 of them, and this week she is
off looking for more.
We are talking about Munros. Deborah has made it her business to paint
the mountains she climbs and sell limited edition prints.
She has been climbing for 12 years and so far has climbed 65 Munros
but she only began painting them about two years ago when she decided to
turn her hobby into a business.
Trading as the Munro Collection she has found that there is a great
demand for her work. At the recent Made in Scotland craft trade fair in
Glasgow a Japanese company bought 12 framed prints.
''At present I am only selling the prints which are each a limited
edition of 600, but the original will not go on sale for at least
another three years,'' said Deborah Campbell.
By the time she sells the originals, Deborah will have added a few
more peaks to the Munro Collection.
This week she is starting her own grand tour of Scotland, talking to
outlets who are interested in selling her prints and, in between
business calls, climbing and painting a few more peaks.
Weather permitting her ascents will include the Five Sisters at Glen
Shiel and Ben MacDui in the Cairngorms.
''When I am near the summit I photograph and sketch it,'' she
explained, ''then I paint it in my studio in Glasgow''.
Later this year Deborah is off to the Himalayas with a friend where
she hopes to climb the Annapur'na -- or at least most of it.
''We will hopefully get to 18,000 feet, but I don't have the
experience to go any further. I enjoy mountain climbing but I don't
fancy the prospect of dangling on a rope on some rock face,'' she
laughed.
Needless to say her sketch pad will accompany her up the mountain.

RETAIL sales bounced back strongly last month, but the recent trend
remains flat as consumers continue to be squeezed by higher taxes and
interest rates.
The figures were seen as a further indication that rates would not be
increased when the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the
Bank of England meet next month, unless sterling collapses meantime.
The volume of retail sales rose by 1.2% in February, precisely the
amount by which it had fallen in January after an upward revision from
0.9%. The year-on-year rate jumped from zero in January to 2.6%.
Sales are in fact back to the level recorded in December, after
allowing for seasonal adjustment. The figures came as a surprise to the
City where analysts, looking for an increase of around 0.5%, had been
biting their finger nails overnight after the CBI's distributive trades
survey had indicated a further decline in February.
Unlike the confederation's monthly and quarterly industrial trends,
which are closely monitored by the Bank of England, the distributive
trades survey has at best a mixed record in forecasting retail sales.
This is not the first time that it has been completely misleading.
Analysts are also sceptical about the quality of the Central
Statistical Office's retail sales data between December and February.
The extraordinary volatility of the monthly figures this year and last
has led independent forecasters to question the seasonal adjustment
weights over the Christmas and New Year period.
The City was also wrong-footed over the average earnings figures for
January. The consensus had expected the growth rate to edge up from
3.75% to 4% in response to the strength of recent pay settlements.
Instead it dropped back to 3.5%, mainly because of lower bonuses paid by
financial institutions.
Gilts took some heart from the unexpected retreat in average earnings
but the effect is expected to be temporary. A bounce-back in the figures
through the 4% mark can be expected in the second quarter once the
distorting impact of bonuses has worked its way out of the equation.
Unemployment fell by a seasonally adjusted 27,400 to 2,364,700 last
month, and the percentage rate edged down to 8.4% from 8.5%. But the
pace at which unemployment is declining seems to be slowing down. The
average drop in the latest three months was 34,500 against 38,200 in the
latest six.
But the workforce in employment is expanding again. In the fourth
quarter of last year it increased by 115,000 to 25,626,000 after a rise
in the third quarter of 152,000, revised up from 140,000.
Hopes that consumption will recover from current lack-lustre levels
depend on personal incomes which should be boosted by an upturn in pay
settlements and increased numbers in employment.
Offsetting this are the tax increases scheduled to come into effect
next month, but with higher excise duties from January replacing the
second tranche of VAT on domestic fuel proposed for next month, part of
the fiscal tightening has already been absorbed.
In the latest three months retail sales grew by just 0.1% and were
2.1% higher than in the same three months a year ago. Analysts are not
sure how much of the recent weakness is because of seasonal adjustments
problems and how much to the success of the National Lottery, which is
taking in the equivalent of 2% of retail sales.
The weakest sector is other non-food retailers, which covers small
traders, whose sales fell by 1% in the latest three months and were 2.8%
lower than the same three months a year ago.
Food sales were unchanged in the latest three months though 2.9%
higher than in the same three months a year ago. Mixed retailers sported
gains of 0.4% and 2.5% respectively. Comparable figures for clothing and
footwear were 0.8% and 3.3% and for household goods 0.6% and 3.8%.
The Retail Consortium's trading policy director, Hugh Clark, said,
''After a miserable start to the year in January, retail sales were more
encouraging in February and this trend has continued into March.
''The underlying trend, however, is still very competitive with
margins under pressure. Consumers continue to be cautious and reluctant
to spend, seeking out exceptional value. Trading is particularly
difficult for small retailers.''

THE biggest order for double decker buses in more than a decade is
rapidly taking shape at the Volvo truck and bus plant at Irvine. The
first of the 210 buses, for Perth-based operator Stagecoach, are due for
delivery in May.
The #22m order is split between Volvo, who are building the chassis,
and Alexander, the Falkirk-based bodybuilders, who are adding the
superstructure. This latest order, thought to be the largest order for
double deckers for twelve years, further cements the relationship
between Stagecoach and these two Scottish suppliers.
The first buses will be used locally on the A1 service between
Ardrossan and Kilmarnock. Fifty two of the new buses are bound for
Stagecoach group companies operating in London and another forty are
bound for Newcastle. The initial order was for 100 units but has
subsequently more than doubled.
''People are tending to spend on smaller buses, with the result that
bigger units on the road are getting older and older'' says Stagecoach
chairman Brian Souter. ''These buses will all have engines meeting the
latest European emission controls.''
Stagecoach, with a total fleet of 6300, has 550 new buses on order in
total this year.

PARTICK Thistle will let supporters in for half-price when they meet
Hearts at Firhill on Tuesday, April 4.
The match was originally abandoned after 57 minutes, because of snow,
a fortnight ago and Thistle could have charged fans the full price for
the re-scheduled game.
Club secretary Robert Reid said: ''We feel it is only fair to make
this gesture and we are hoping for a big crowd to help us in our fight
against relegation.''
* MOTHERWELL'S Eddie May yesterday admitted he did use a hand when
Partick Thistle were denied a penalty during Tuesday's premier division
0-0 draw at Firhill.
Last night May said: ''I thought referee Andrew Waddell was certain to
give a penalty -- the ball definitely hit my hand. I was the most
relieved man in the ground when he waved play on. To be fair, though, it
was not deliberate. I was facing my own goal when I went to clear an
awkward, bouncing cross and the ball shot up and hit my hand.'
MANCHESTER United will be the best supported club at next month's FA
Cup semi-finals -- just as they are in the Premiership.
But United's 21,281 allocation for the Villa Park clash against Wolves
or Crystal Palace is still less than half this season's average Old
Trafford attendance. Their opponents will receive 16,546 for the April 9
tie.
In the other semi at Leeds, Tottenham have have been given 18,478
tickets while Everton receive 17,609.
* HUNTLY have signed Dave Morland from Cove Rangers for #7500.

ENGLAND manager Jack Rowell will keep captain Will Carling waiting for
12 more days before endorsing him as leader of the World Cup campaign in
South Africa.
Rowell is concentrating only on Saturday's Grand Slam decider against
Scotland -- whom he rates ''our most difficult opponents of the season''
-- at Twickenham.
''I have not thought about formally naming Carling as captain,'' said
Rowell. There seems little doubt, however, that Carling's leadership
will continue into June.
Rowell has taken both opportunities before him to extend Carling's
leadership over the past year. The manager instantly named Carling for
the job when he was appointed as manager a year ago and, before this
season began, he told his skipper to carry on through the Five Nations'
Championship.
''Will has been at the helm for a long time and worked hard. He is a
better captain now than when he was first given the task as a
22-year-old back in 1988,'' said Rowell.
Carling has led England 47 times, is playing some of the best rugby of
his life, and has no rival for his place or his position in charge.
Looking ahead to Saturday, Rowell said: ''The jury is still out on
whether we have a successful season.''
England cannot afford to flop again in the last match when going for
the championship -- as they did in 1989, 1990, 1993, and 1994.
But Rowell warned: ''The odds on England, at 1-6, are over the top in
a two-horse race.
''We sometimes need the Dunkirk spirit to force us to play our best,
but if we really are favourites I would like to think that we can impose
our skills and wills on the opposition.
''But we are on an upward curve, whatever happens. We have had a
staggering mid-season spell, with five varied wins between November and
February. I have enjoyed it.
''It has been good for English rugby, and some of the English nation
is living through this team.''
Certainly, Carling's squad are providing more regular good news than
their football and cricket counterparts.
''I am uplifted by what the team has achieved and, if we overcome the
Scots, we will be catapulted into the World Cup,'' says Rowell.
''But we want to add more width to the power game and use the
Underwood brothers, Jeremy Guscott, and our attacking full back, Mike
Catt.''
Rowell persisted in praising Scotland. There is no sign of a war of
words so far that has disfigured the prelude to some recent
Anglo-Scottish fixtures.
''After their selection surgery the whole rugby world has been
impressed with the Scotland team,'' he said.
''They have gone back to the traditional Scottish game and their
strategy has gone well. I have to rate them our most difficult opponents
of the season.
''We would have been pleased with their margin over Wales and to win
in France represents true credentials as we know, because we have done
it and consequently impressed other countries.
''Gavin Hastings is an icon, but what we have got to fear most is
Scotland playing as a team -- a collective unit.''

THIS should be the best of times for Bolton's veteran hit man John
McGinlay, who has spent most of his career dodging around the lower
reaches of the game.
On his immediate horizon are Scotland's European Championship
qualifying clash with Russia in Moscow and the Coca-Cola Cup final with
his club at Wembley. Further ahead there is the strong possibility of
promotion to the Premiership at the end of the season.
But, instead of basking in the glow of these achievements, the
30-year-old from the Highlands is agonising over a club-and-country
dilemma. The problem is that Scotland team manager Craig Brown wants
McGinlay to report to Hampden on the Saturday before the match in
Moscow. That would mean McGinlay missing a league game at Portsmouth --
with a possible knock-on effect which could jeopardise his cup-final
place the following week.
Now McGinlay intends to make a personal plea to Brown asking him for
permission to play at Portsmouth.
The striker points out: ''The international team manager has already
allowed Colin Hendry to play for Blackburn on a Sunday before a game.
This time I would be with the squad on the Saturday night. Essentially,
all I would miss is the fairly light training workout on the Saturday
afternoon.
''I was a member of the Tartan Army in Spain at the World Cup Finals
in l982, just there as one of the punters, and it's important to me that
I have been picked for the team.
''But then there is the final coming up and I'll never see another
final -- or I don't think I will -- and the chance of playing at Wembley
is dream material.''
McGinlay's club manager, Bruce Rioch, has already spoken to Brown,
who, so far, has not relented.
Explained Rioch: ''I asked Craig if John could play at Portsmouth and
then we would rush him to Heathrow so that he could be with the rest of
the lads on Saturday night. So far he has said no, even although our
other international players, Jason McAteer and Mixu Paatelainen, don't
have to join the Republic of Ireland and Finland until after the
Portsmouth match.
''It's difficult for me and for John. Both of us are passionate about
Scotland, but there is a lot at stake for the club, too.''
McGinlay hopes to have the best of both worlds when the discussions
over the issue are settled. He wants to play for his club in their two
games, and for Scotland against the Russians.
''Obviously, I want to play in the Russian match. I also want the
opportunity to play alongside Duncan Ferguson again. We played together
in Athens, but it didn't work out as well as we had hoped. Now, I'm sure
it would work.
''Big Duncan is amazing. Every time I watch him on the box he is
Everton's best player. He is playing out of his skin and I'm sure I
could nick a goal if I was played beside him.''
That's a view Bruce Rioch shares. He bought McGinlay for just #120,000
after having taken him to Millwall and he summed him up like this: ''In
this game there are great goal scorers, and there are the scorers of
great goals. The first will get you 30 or so goals a year, the second
will get you half a dozen. They will all be special -- but they only
count the same as the others.
''John McGinlay is a great goal scorer and, to get the best out of
him, you play him in the penalty box and you never ask him to go wider
than the 18-yard line. He will always get you goals if you play him that
way. At any level.''
He will, of course, be an even more potent threat if he is happy with
his lot. The ball is passed to Brown. If he wants a happy strike force
in Moscow, then he should allow McGinlay to be with his club at
Portsmouth.
He has fudged his demands for players before -- Colin Hendry is a
major example -- now he should listen to McGinlay's plea and do it
again.

TWO Scots, Allison Rose and Trudi Thomson, were named yesterday to
represent Britain at the World Marathon Cup, to be staged over the
original course, from Marathon to Athens, on April 9.
The 27-year-old Rose made her Great Britain debut last year at the
European championships in Helsinki, while 36-year-old Thomson is an
ultra-distance specialist.
It is 99 years since the marathon was first run on the same route at
the inaugural Athens Olympics. The men's record (2hr 11min 07sec) has
stood to Britain's Bill Adcocks since 1969.
That record, however, is certain to be under threat, for substantial
prize money is on offer -- a total of $364,000, plus a further $36,000
in ''start pocket money'' -- an International Amateur Athletic
Federation euphemism for appearance money.
The men's and women's winners will receive $30,000 each, with a
further $21,000 for the leading men's and women's teams. British team:
Men: M Croasdale (Lancaster), W Foster (Blackheath), I Bloomfield
(Chester le Street), R Nash (Westbury), D Rathbone (Brighton). Reserve:
T Clark (Poole). Women: C Horne (Crawley), Z Marchant (Bath), A Rose
(Edinburgh WM), T Thomson (Pitreavie), L Turner (Rowheath). Reserve: C
Hunter-Rowe (Pudsey).

MEXICO yesterday pulled out of staging the 1997 World Athletics
Championships in Mexico City because of the country's economic problems.
International Amateur Athletic Federation president Primo Nebiolo said
''a number of alternatives'' were available. Madrid has already
expressed an interest in hosting the championships.
Seville has already applied for the 1999 championships, while Paris,
Manchester, Athens and Johannesburg are also expected to bid.
Two weeks ago Mexico told football's world governing body FIFA that it
no longer wanted to host the 2002 World Cup.

STRICTLY in golfing terms, Sam Torrance is regularly afflicted with
the two-year itch. The rash appears whenever the contest for places on
the European Ryder Cup team again sharpens, to the extent that only in
one of the last seven successive seasons when he qualified to play
against the United States has Torrance failed to win at least once.
Having finished equal second and equal fifth in two of his last three
outings Torrance has moved from eleventh to ninth in the points table --
surprisingly, the only player to have promoted himself into the first 10
despite the infrequency with which most of the leaders have competed.
Severianno Ballesteros has already as good as confirmed his place, and
Bernhard Langer, Colin Montgomerie, Jose Maria Olazabal and Ian Woosnam
have established footholds on the ladder from which the rank and file
professionals, scrapping busily among themselves, are finding it all but
impossible to dislodge.
Torrance, who won consecutive Portuguese Open titles in 1982 and 1983
-- although neither over Penha Longa, where the thirty-ninth
championship begins today -- can consolidate his position. The 6900-yard
course, laid out on hilly terrain between Cascais and Sintra to the
design of Robert Trent Jones Jr, opened only two years ago.
Although Torrance, one of 10 Scots taking part, was disappointed not
to have won in Morocco on Sunday after having led with a round to play,
he was not despondent.
''I played well, but was just swamped by great golf,'' he reflected
with a reference to the sub-70 scores with which Mark James won and
David Gilford, Robert Carlson and Alexander Cejka overtook his
respectable 71, one under par.
Ironically, James inflicted the damage with his newly adopted
long-handled putter, an implement long used by Torrance and which
Christy O'Connor Jr will start using this week. Torrance's reaction to
those developments was terse: ''I'm surprised it's taken them as much
time to catch on.''
James's victory not only was the first by a British professional in
the eight tournaments completed this winter but actually was the first
in 14 events (including the Dunhill Cup), since Woosnam's victory in the
British Masters last September. Four first-time successes by
Continentals have emphasised their growing presence.
The field of 132 includes three of them -- Santiago Luna, Jarmo
Sandelin, and Karlsson -- as well as James as they challenge for the
title won last year by Philip Price, by coincidence the first victory of
his career. The championship also marks the return to the competitive
fray by Jim Payne.
The 1992 Rookie of the Year's most recent outing was in the Dutch Open
as long ago as July last year. Persistent back trouble, often suffered
by golfers as tall as he is at 6ft 4in, led to an operation in September
for spinal fusion and this tournament marks Payne's first tentative
re-entry on to the tournament stage.
''My back feels fine, but for the next couple of months I'm not too
worried about how well I do. I just want to ease myself back into things
at first,'' he said.

SCOTLAND'S Myra McKinlay fell victim to the tough world of the
American Express Tour inaugural qualifying school yesterday at La Manga,
Spain, where she missed the cut with a second round of 82 for a halfway
aggregate of 164.
McKinlay was too upset to discuss her disappointment, but clearly she
had put herself under too much pressure with her opening 82, when she
had to use a borrowed sand wedge.
Nor were yesterday's conditions made for climbing back. A firm breeze
early in the day became a strong wind by the time McKinlay set forth in
the afternoon with a birdie at the tenth hole, her first.
Alas, it flattered to deceive as McKinlay, a member of the Curtis Cup
side last year, took 40 to reach the turn before dropping five strokes
in as many holes after the turn.
Lindsey Irvine was the best of the Scots. A second-round 77 left her
on 154, two ahead of Jill Kinloch with Tracey Craik on 159. Morag
Wright, the former Scottish internationalist, joined McKinlay on the
sidelines.
Irvine, 27 and a former Scottish schools internationalist, had been
six over par for the day after 11 holes but completed the remainder of
her round in one under par.
None of the field were able to catch Stephanie Dallongeville, 21, from
France, who added a 70 to her first round of 73 to lead at one-under-par
on 143.
Out in the calmer early morning, she started from the tenth and
reached the turn in 33. She birdied two of her next three holes, dropped
a shot at the thirteenth, and ran up two more bogeys in the last three.
Leading second-round aggregates (British and Irish unless stated):
143 -- S Dallongeville (France) 73, 70.
145 -- M Arruti (Spain) 74, 71.
146 -- R Bolas 73, 73.

NICK Faldo may have started a revolution with his decision to leave
Europe and concentrate on the US PGA Tour. Several other European
players this week having been giving serious consideration to doing
something similar.
Sandy Lyle describes himself as 99% certain that he will rejoin the US
Tour next year when the five-year ban he incurred by resigning at the
end of 1990 is up.
Bernhard Langer, whose wife is American and who already spends much of
the year at his home in Florida, is also a likely candidate for 1996
membership. Colin Montgomerie is also rumoured to be giving the idea
some consideration. Jose Maria Olazabal admitted this week that he came
within a hair of joining Faldo this year, and the only thing preventing
him from playing over here was concern that the 15-tournament
requirement would overload his schedule.
Faldo said yesterday: ''There's a few that have talked to me. I won't
say who -- I don't want to get them in hot water -- but they can see the
advantages, in the weather and in the facilities and in the consistency
of conditions when you play over here.''
Faldo, himself, is a living advertisement for the benefits of the
American golf tour. He had a victory at Doral, is second on the
money-list, and is clearly happy and thriving over here. Faldo said:
''I'm enjoying life, and that was a goal of coming over here. It's been
great. Everyone's been really nice and supportive.''
US PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem, who took over from Deane Beman
last year, hinted last week that the tour is considering a way to relax
the strictures on foreign players. Currently non-members can only play
five US events, plus the majors and the Players' Championship.
This may in part be further insurance against another attempt to
create a rival world tour. If most of the world's best players are over
here in America, as they already are, with the exception of several
Europeans and Japan's Jumbo Ozaki, then the US Tour becomes a de facto
world tour.
This week at Bay Hill already has a world tour feel to it. The top 23
ranked golfers in the world are playing here in Arnold Palmer's
tournament, the Nestle Invitational, and 39 of the top 50. There are
eight Europeans in the field, including Faldo, who is trying to keep up
his streak of high finishes, with a win and a second place in the last
two weeks, as well as last week's third-place finisher, Ian Woosnam, and
Olazabal, playing in just his second tournament this year.
Olazabal, who will defend at the Masters in three weeks, was concerned
about how well he would fare against such formidable competition this
week; his game is still creaky after weeks of enforced rest following
foot surgery at the start of February.
Olazabal said: ''I'm concerned to get my game in shape. I have played
only one tournament in three months, and I'm going to have to pay the
price for that. I'm going to make mistakes, but I knew that when I
decided to have the surgery. These are going to be tough weeks, with
tough fields and my game not being as sharp.''

It may not register on the Richter scale, but Stirling's MacRobert
Centre looks set to cause a stir with its Great Shakes! showcase. John
Fowler spoke to the organiser, Sylvia Dow
BLANKET Shakespeare is what Sylvia Dow calls it. ''We're going to bomb
the MacRobert with Shakespeare,'' she says. ''No one around can escape
it.''
For one week this month the MacRobert Arts Centre on Stirling
University campus is to be the scene of blitz on the bard. Dow, who put
the programme together, says that though there's a particular focus on
youth, anyone is welcome to drop in for a bout of ''Great Shakes!'' --
as she has called the season.
Opening night is Saturday, when members of the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra will perform music from The Tempest. The composer Purcell, now
all the rage in his tercentenary year, gets the credit on the programme
but Dow admits this may be misleading. ''There's a slight doubt whether
The Tempest is by Purcell after all,'' she admits diplomatically. ''But
it's lovely music.''
She adds: ''We've snuck in a few other things.'' These include
readings by Harriet Buchan (of Taggart fame) and a brisk dance and music
performance based on themes from A Midsummer Night's Dream by pupils
from Central Region. One of the items to be read by Buchan is a new
sonnet written for the event by Edwin Morgan, called Ariel Finally.
Beforehand, members of the youth theatre dressed in Elizabethan
costume will rove the foyer offering members of the audience the chance
to buy a sonnet: pay up and you get a quick 14-liner on the Dark Lady.
On the Monday morning the charismatic actor Brian Cox holds a public
master class, putting students from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music
and Drama through their paces in scenes from the plays.
A Midsummer Night's Dream gets a lot of exposure. All week on the main
stage the Compass Theatre Company presents its much praised version and
on the Thursday night Stirling Youth Theatre perform their version in
the studio theatre -- ''very individual, fast and funny'' -- according
to the blurb.
From stage to screen: four widely different films can be seen,
starting with the Japanese director Akira Kurasawa's spectacular and
chilling version of Macbeth, Throne of Blood. ''I held out for that
one,'' says Dow enthusiastically, ''I love it when he dies with all
those arrows in his neck.''
It's not all screen violence. There's Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet,
remarkable amongst other things for the youth of its cast. Olivier's old
warhorse Henry V comes galloping out again, remembered most vividly for
the charge of the French cavalry at Agincourt, but fascinating also for
its transition from Elizabethan playhouse to filmic naturalism, and the
Russian director Grigori Kozintsev's King Lear, ''the best King Lear
ever'', according to Dow.
She has one regret. She and, the MacRobert's film officer Scott
Donaldson, failed to track down a print of the 1930s black and white
Midsummer Night's Dream featuring Mickey Rooney as Puck and a starry
cast directed by Max Reinhardt.
Throne of Blood has an evening showing, with the others screened in
the morning. In each case you can stay on and hear Stirling University
lecturers talk about the films.
Among other items, the Scottish Early Music Consort returns to the
MacRobert after a decade's absence with a programme of Elizabethan songs
and instrumental music, Edwin Morgan reads from his poems, and there's
an exhibition of pictures by primary pupils using Shakespeare titles as
a starting point. Each evening before the shows there are free
performances in the foyer by professional and amateur musicians, and
there is a series of workshops for young people.
Great Shakes! was conceived by Sylvia Dow when she was arts officer at
the MacRobert (she is now arts education co-ordinator for Central
Region). Originally she entered it for a national funding award, but
when that went elsewhere she determined to go ahead anyway.
''My blood was up,'' she said -- and she set about raising the
required 40,000 from sponsors. Central Region chipped in. So did the
Baring Foundation -- fortunately that money is not affected by the bank
collapse.
''People -- young people especially -- might ask what relevance there
is in all this today. Well,'' she declares, ''I hope to make Shakespeare
live.''
* Great Shakes! is sponsored by BP and is at the MacRobert Arts
Centre, Stirling, from Saturday to March 25.

ST ALOYSIUS' College will play today for a place in the final of the
Bank of Scotland Schools Cup when they face Earlston High School at
Bangholm, Edinburgh.
In their 52-5 victory over Morrison's Academy last weekend, Scottish
School wing James Craig scored four tries and kicked six conversions for
32 points, and in the cup quarter-final against Peebles last week he
scored 18 points from two tries, two penalty goals, and a conversion in
their 23-18 win.
Outwith the cup, the College will play Glasgow High School in a match
rearranged for a week on Saturday. That will a tough test, as High
School have lost only four matches this season.
Colin Mair, Glasgow High School's first XV coach and the former West
of Scotland full back, explained: ''In contrast to other seasons, we
made an impressive start, with wins over Glasgow Academy, Glenalmond,
and Dollar Academy.
''Although it's been very much a team effort, scrum half Lyall Gibb
has been inspirational. He scored two cracking tries against Fettes and
Heriot's with breaks of 40 metres.''
Gibb, No.8 Murray McLure, centre John Millan, hooker John Masclay, and
lock Peter Ross all have appeared for Glasgow Schools this season.
Within the city, High School beat Glasgow Academy by 30 points this
season and also defeated Kelvinside Academy, but lost to Hutchesons'
Grammar School.
Apart from Mair, who also coaches West of Scotland, the first XV is
helped by Dave Barrett, head of physical education Charlie Forsyth, the
former flanker, and a number of other members of staff.
Mair, who took the first XV on tour in October to Germany, where they
played under-19 teams in the Heidelberg area, also had useful input from
a Scotland cap. ''Early in the year Alan  Watt took a couple of sessions
with the forwards.  That was a valuable exercise,'' said Mair.
Musselburgh XV 5, Scotland Under-19s 22
SCOTLAND'S Under-19 team, preparing for their match against England on
April 1 and then for the FIRA championship in Romania next month, were
given a testing workout at Stoneyhill last night by a Musselburgh side
containing eight first-team regulars.
Stand-off Graham Hay opened with a penalty and then converted a fine
try by left wing Danny Bull after full back Scott Tomlinson's perfectly
timed pass.
The lead was stretched when Bull intercepted and ran from his own 22m
for a try under the posts converted by Dalgleish. Russell Kennedy
provided the pass for Geoff Caldwell to score the third try but
Musselburgh were consoled when centre Cliff Livingstone crossed for an
unconverted try.
Musselburgh -- B Stewart; G Dignan,  M Steedman, C Livingston,  F
Rowberry; B Grant,  A Duncan; S Young,  D Lindsay, G Talac,  A O'Brien
(Preston Lodge), S Dunn (Currie), A Bonthron, A McLeod, D Logan.
Scotland Under-19s -- S  Tomlinson (Selkirk), replaced  by B  Wright

SCOTTISH artists have triumphed again. A handful have been selected to
represent Britain at the Venice Biennale, in its centenary year. They
are Douglas Gordon and Louise Scullion, graduates of Glasgow School of
Art, Matthew Dalziel and Louise Wilson, who trained at Dundee, and
Wilson's twin sister, Jane.
All are under 30 and are making new works to be unveiled at Venice in
June.
Gordon, Scullion and Dalziel will occupy the whole top floor of the UK
presentation of New Art From Britain to be held in the seventeenth
century Scuola San Pasquale.
In 1990 David Mach, Kate Whiteford and Arthur Watson represented
Scotland at the Venice Biennale with great success. In 1993 two women
joined this elite: Christine Borland and Julie Roberts -- both Glasgow
graduates now teaching at the School of Art.
''Nowadays it's impossible to ignore Scotland,'' says the British
Council's visual art director Andrea Rose who helps select artists for
Venice.
Several other exciting young Scots, including Roddy Buchanan and
Claire Barclay, both from Glasgow, were also considered for Venice but
lack of space prevented their inclusion.
In Venice, the top gallery will be blacked out to accommodate Gordon's
hard-hitting, slow-motion film and Dalziell/Scullion's light sculpture.
This long, open-ended channel is full of shimmering blue-green water --
or so it seems. Gordon also plays on our perceptions, but in a
psychological way. His disturbing 1905 Italian film depicts a
psychiatrist inducing a hysterical fit in a woman patient.
FOR Gordon it's been an annus mirabilis with the Pompidou Centre
buying his work and high-powered shows in London, Leipzig and Sweden.
Today he flies to New York for his first American solo show. On March 23
he's back in London at the Serpentine Gallery for an exhibition called
Take Me I'm Yours. Here, in the interests of access, he will raffle
himself. ''It's a tombola, tickets #1, prize an evening with me -- and
we have to spend all the tombola money!''
The Dalziel/Scullion partnership are closer to home. Their show, about
perfume, The Most Beautiful Thing, is touring schools in Grampian.

HOLDERS Scotland and main rivals England both opened their home
international indoor championship campaign in Nottingham yesterday with
victories.
England were the first in action, and after looking down and out they
hit back to edge out Wales 134-132. By comparison, Scotland's 116-95 win
over Ireland last night was comfortable. Despite winning by only 21
shots, the Scots didn't have a losing rink, finishing ahead on five and
all square in the other.
The biggest win came from Commonwealth gold medallist Richard Corsie.
Despite suffering from flu, the Edinburgh man declared himself fit
enough to play and led his rink to a 22-15 victory over Stevie Moran.
Robert McCulloch and Angus Blair both added five-shot wins, McCulloch
beating Noel Graham 22-17 and Blair beating David Corkill 17-12. Alex
Marshall added a 23-20 win over Gary McCloy and Robert Provan counted a
last-end double to edge out Roy McCune 18-17. But Sammy Allen picked up
two on the last end to force a 14-14 draw with Willie Wood.
England looked to be heading for defeat in their match with Wales when
they trailed 114-126 with just two ends to play but they picked up 16
shots for the loss of one on the penultimate end thanks mainly to a
count of seven from world indoor singles champion Andy Thomson in his
match with Jason Greenslade.

AS American Doug Swingley smashed all records to win the Iditarod race
in Alaska yesterday, Scotland's first-ever competitor was poised to mush
his dogs into the top 20 and among the prize money.
David Milne, from Dundee, was running twenty-fourth of the 53
survivors from 58 starters, driving his team into Koyuk with 161 miles
to go. He is down to 11 huskies of the 16 with which he started -- he
has retired the others. There have been no dog fatalities during the
race so far.
With only two-and-a-half hours covering places 20 to 24, Milne hopes
to overtake a few more rivals, subject to successful negotiation of the
ice-bound Bering Sea.
Twentieth is the last place for which prize-money ($6500) is paid, but
Milne, blooding a young team for his employer, Rick Swenson, will be
delighted just to finish. Record five-time winner Swenson finished
tenth.
For Swingley, however, the rewards are more than incidental. Victory
in the 1150-mile race, in a record time of 9 days 2 hours 42 minutes,
brought him $52,500 and a $30,000 pick-up truck, plus a further $9000 in
stage bonuses. Swingley, a Montana rancher, is the first non-Alaskan to
win in the 23-year history of the race, which commemorates the
rescue-running of diptheria serum from Anchorage to Nome in 1925.
Milne, a former accountant, has a mandatory eight-hour stop at White
Mountain, and is expected to finish tomorrow.

ROSINA Bonsu describes it as if that huge Lottery finger had shimmered
through the ceiling and said: ''It's YOU!''
''THE Vicente Saez has asked me to audition for him!'' she says.
Her excitement is mixed with disbelief and rueful laughter. Saez and
his company are in Glasgow as part of New Moves Across Europe. On the
Saturday morning, despite feeling under par, Rosina chivvied herself out
from under the duvet and over to the Tramway for his masterclass.
You could run the national grid off the energy Bonsu radiates. Nothing
may come of the Saez invitation to Valencia, but anything might happen.
Her bank balance will not be able to stand it, but then that's what most
independent dance-makers face.
''Tell me about it,'' says Rosina. She's disappointed at the
compromises this has forced on her programme at the Ramshorn Theatre
this week, but she's refused to abandon her goals.
''Originally I'd wanted this programme to bring together my 'abstract'
solo pieces -- Past Noted, Discovering Realities and So -- because of
the perspective they offer on my life, and my relationship with my
father. I'd thought of Bob Pringle's lighting being the unifying factor,
and I'd thought of having some more film in it -- and new music for So.
But the funding came too late.''
Taking Panic as a working title, she embarked, out of necessity, on
another of her ''talking pieces'' -- spoken text intermingled with
improvised movement -- and this will form part of her solo performances
at the Ramshorn Theatre tomorrow night and Saturday.
ROSINA's just one of many dance-makers still keen to work in Scotland
who survive through teaching or by contributing to other projects --
Rosina herself will be involved in Fablevision's site-specific piece for
the Eastwood Festival and she's booked to teach in Vienna. Somewhere in
between, she'll prepare work for a Mayfest programme, again at Ramshorn.
''Funding? I haven't even started chasing that yet. But I'll go ahead
anyway -- I'll call it an investment in myself. Just like the plane fare
to Valencia.'' Some people don't wait for the Lottery.
* Rosina Bonsu's solo performances -- Minding My Own -- are at the
Ramshorn Theatre tomorrow and Saturday.

THE National Farmers' Union of Scotland has appointed Michael Dalton
as area secretary for Aberdeen and Kincardine, replacing Sheena Hunter
who leaves at the end of this month. Mr Dalton is a graduate of
Newcastle University, with a BSc (Hons) degree in agricultural
mechanisation and management. He previously worked in the agri-business
sector.
Meanwhile, the Game Conservancy Trust in Scotland has appointed Dr
John Hughes to head a new project which will investigate ways of
improving the game and wildlife potential of farmland in the lowlands.
Dr Hughes has previously worked with St Andrews and Dundee
universities on agricultural projects. The new appointment, which is
expected to be for five years will be mainly financed by the proceeds of
the Game Conservancy Scottish Fair held every year at Scone. Other major
contributors include Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Office
environment department.
Ian McCall, the Game Conservancy Trust's Scottish director, said the
new project would include an examination of how a number of important
game and wildlife management techniques worked in Scotland. The
development of game and wildlife friendly set-aside practices and
grassland management problems specific to Scotland were high on the
agenda, he added.
In another new appointment, Dr Fraser Macleod, director of the
Scottish Crofters' Union, is to join the executive board of the
pan-European organisation representing small farmers -- Co-Ordination
Paysanne Europeenne (CPE).
Welcoming the appointment, Alistair MacIver, acting president of the
union, said he was enthusiastic about the possibility of regular
representation in Brussels.

Power Generation's evidently funktastic Exodus album.
At 1.51am, the NPG began an hour of inspired jam-session funk. If the
material itself was rarely staggering, TAFKAP's presence was that of a
real star not far from the peak of his creativity and freed from the
shackles big venues and audiences impose.
His vocals soared; his musicianship was nothing short of phenomenal;
his performance was as involving as it was intense.
The hitherto-unheard material draws on Sly Stone, George Clinton, and
James Brown, with one verse of Girls and Boys slipped in. The one truly
incendiary moment came when he told us to hold on to our wigs before he
picked up his bass and proceeded to career through Days of Wild.
It ended with a kiss for Mayte and the injunction to ''all go home and
have safe sex tonight''.
Inevitably, his own-brand Purple Rainmate condoms were available in
the foyer at #2 each.
As he escaped into the waiting stretch-limo which had reversed at high
speed the wrong way down one-way Sauchiehall Street for him, we knew we
would never be able to stare into the blackness of his Raybans from this
close a vantage point again.

SEEING this production for a second time, now nestling cosily into the
King's after the less intimate expanse of the National's Lyttleton, I am
reminded even more forcibly how great a play Lillian Hellman's
60-year-old drama really is. You're unlikely to have seen it on a
British stage before now, yet it is up there with the Arthur Miller,
Eugene O'Neill and Tennessee Williams standards that more commonly fly
the flag for American playwriting from the first half of this century.
The subject matter - an is-she isn't-she exploration of lesbian
leanings in a New England girls school - is now routine material even
for TV soap operas, but Hellman sustains the play across its three acts
by the emotive power of her characterisation, the tough, dead-pan wit of
her language and her recognition of the raw potency of sexuality.
In this last respect, Emily Watson is a startlingly good Mary Tilford,
the scheming schoolgirl who sets off rumours about the 'unnatural'
relationship between two of her teachers. Fired by the insight of
Hellman's writing, Watson dances on the cusp of childhood innocence and
burgeoning sexuality, her character understanding just enough to realise
the censorious power of adult morality.
But the great joy of the production is the double-act of Harriet
Walter and Clare Higgins who, as the accused teachers, have a rare
physical comfort, an off-hand familiarity that suggests a long, dynamic
friendship, a friendship that never cracks even under the most intense
pressure. As the play switches from schoolroom banter to high-intensity
intrigue to despairing aftermath, Walter and Higgins retain a resilient,
respectful and ultimately tragic presence at the centre of this
affecting drama.

SCOTTISH land owning and farming leaders presented a divergent picture
of rural support in the next century when they met members of the
Commons Scottish Affairs Committee in London yesterday.
John Ross, president of the Scottish National Farmers' Union, remained
implacably opposed to the removal of production controls and aids, while
Graeme Gordon, convenor of the Scottish Landowners' Federation, foresaw
further de-coupling of support from production.
Mr Ross started off with the assertion that he was more optimistic
about the future of the Scottish farming industry now than he had been a
year or so ago because of the success of the CAP reforms.
However, in reply to Ayr MP Phil Gallie he did admit there were some
problems with supply controls and bureaucracy. Pressed by Robert Hughes
(Aberdeen North) to expand on this, Mr Ross said that despite these
problems a totally free market would not work for Scotland. It would
result in a major shift in production of many commodities to the more
fertile areas of Europe such as East Anglia, the Paris basin and
Germany. Livestock production in the less favoured areas would not be
able to compete.
''It is important for the whole of rural Scotland that we retain a
diverse agriculture and food processing industry. A totally free market
would not allow this,'' he said.
Mr Hughes suggested that supply controls helped to keep up prices.
This was refuted by union chief executive Tom Brady who pointed out that
between 1987 and 1995 inflation had been 46%, while food prices had
increased by 33% and farm gate prices by only 17%. This meant that in
real terms farmers' prices had been falling.
Mr Hughes asked how had this affected land prices. These had risen
because the farm policy reforms were working and interest rates were
coming down, Mr Ross replied. Mr Hughes enquired whether this was a
barrier to young entrants. The high level of investment needed,
including buying up quotas, was a barrier, Mr Ross admitted. But quotas
also ensured the survival of smaller farms.
Cross-compliance -- the payment of subsidies in return for
environmentally approved work -- was given a fair airing, but Mr Brady
maintained that the prime reason for the CAP was to provide food for
Europe's 366 million consumers. Mr Ross added: ''It would not be
acceptable to see the CAP driven by environmental considerations only.''
Graeme Gordon reaffirmed landowners' support for the reformed policy
and added that a move to a New Zealand type of unsubsidised agriculture
would be a disaster for Scotland. But he said he would be quite happy to
see a choice of different ways of using money from the taxpayer to
support the rural economy in, say, 10 years. This could involve more
de-coupling of payments and leaving products to find their own market
level. Support for environmental activities would be part of this
overall rural plan which would replace an agricultural policy, he said.
He added that the SLF was working on just such a policy.
This fundamental difference apart, the two teams found themselves in
broad agreement on many issues thrown at them by MPs. They were both
concerned by supermarket power and both favoured greater farmer
involvement in co-operatives, farm assurance and quality schemes as a
means of meeting this challenge.
They agreed there was a strong element of social support in the
current farm policy, but pointed out that without the backbone of the
farm industry many rural areas would become like deserts.
Finally, they agreed -- and found total support from the committee --
in condemning BBC Scotland's plan to axe the daily Scottish farming news
broadcast. There had been no consultation with the industry and it would
prove a great loss to the rural community. The committee unanimously
agreed to support the industry by writing to the BBC. John Ross and Tom
Brady spent much of the rest of the day at Westminster lobbying MPs for
further support.

FOR is it not written that the Blues begat Metal, Metal begat Punk,
then did Punk lie with Metal and out of the sin of their iniquity they
brought forth Thrash and Grunge? And the people exalted Grunge, but unto
Thrash they did say: ''We know thee for what thou art: chuffin' Metal.
Get thee hence unless thou com'st in natural fibres and a better
haircut.''
And lo, it is Megadeth, leading their flock to higher pastures. Is
Dave Mustaine writing tunes these days? Sure seems like it. He still
resembles an angel with the voice of a malevolent hobgoblin, still duets
some dynamite harmony guitar with Marty Friedman, so you may say that
little has changed in nearly nine years, give or take some personnel.
Indeed you might call this performance traditional.
But Mustaine seems a happier man than the one who is said to have
almost joined that stupid club last year, and the songs from the
Youthanasia album have something extra. Traditionalists can rest assured
that the Megadeth machine still propels itself like a high-speed
juggernaut, but one that turns on a 5p coin. This is thanks to bassman
Ellefson and one whom I take to be Menza behind his new beard,
thundering from the snazzy chrome and perspex drum control unit.
Good to hear a band that can take possession of a favourite like
Sabbath's Paranoid, allowing scribes to describe Megadeth's riff
delivery as ''crunching''. I left before the anticipated cover of
Anarchy in the UK but I'm sure that those who looked upon it found that
it was good.

LARGE-SCALE, succulent programme this week from the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra, whose chief conductor, Ivor Bolton, is at the helm.
Everything in the programme, unveiled last night at the City Hall, is
unknown or brand new, and spreading across three centuries.
First the new. There's a pleasing sense of continuity in Haflidi
Hallgrimmson's new Cello Concerto, which received its world premiere
last night. The Icelandic-born composer, himself a superb cellist, was
at one time a principal cellist in the SCO. The new work's commissioner,
and its performer last night, was William Conway, also a former SCO
principal cellist for a period of 10 years.
The concerto, for cello and string orchestra, is masterly; absolutely
no hesitation about committing an opinion on that score. It's a big
work, a full half hour. The concentration and focus of the work itself
never slips. Shot through with episodes of nervy energy and animation,
and dramatic climaxes, the concerto is none the less, at root, a deeply
melodic, poetic and reflective work.
From its opening, throaty statement, deep in the instrument, the cello
sustains a role that is characterised by a quiet assured confidence to
which it repeatedly returns, even when bustled by outbursts of
excitement in the orchestra. It sings and it soars, becoming intense and
impassioned, but always settles back into its restrained, mature
eloquence.
The captivating piece, beautifully played by William Conway and the
SCO strings, is the more ravishing -- and reflective -- because the
composer has consciously allowed striking influences from his own vast
musical experience to infiltrate the core of the work and occasionally
surface. There's a huge range of these, but the most breathtaking of
these is a haunting appearance of the fifth movement from Messiaen's
great Quartet for the End of Time -- the movement featuring the cello. A
commanding work.
Flanking the new work were two gems, each featuring incidental music
for Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Both contained some middle-drawer
stuff but also some beauties. Sibelius's Suite has an unusually lumpy
dance but also some gorgeous, atmospheric music. Purcell's music for the
play is apparently of extremely dubious authenticity but, with a
superior cast of six singers, the SCO and its chorus in luminous form,
and some cracking dances, it's a real curio, well worth hearing. Same
show tonight at the Queen's Hall.

William Russell reviews a varied foursome of new releases, ranging
from a thoughtful study of sex and churchmen, to a mind-numbing Natural
Born imitator
WITH fortuitous timing Priest, directed by Antonia Bird, written by
Jimmy McGovern, opens just as the issue of homosexuality and the
priesthood is being publicly debated.
The Vatican's hard line has been softened by Cardinal Basil Hume's
pronouncement that ''love between two persons, whether of the same sex
or a different sex, is to be treasured and respected.'' The former
Scottish Episcopalian Bishop of Galloway and Glasgow has revealed his
homosexuality, and the present Anglican Bishop of London, responding to
the appalling behaviour, tantamount to blackmail, of the pressure group,
Outrage, has confessed that his sexuality is a ''grey area'', although
he is celibate. Plenty of controversy there.
McGovern is a highly skilled writer of issue-driven television drama,
but he has yet to master the art of writing for the cinema. This, his
first film script, is too long and as well as covering too many topics
sets up too many opportunities for viewers to nip out to the kitchen and
make a cup of tea.
There is also no central character with whom the audience can
identify. This can work on television, but in the cinema there has to be
a hero, no matter how flawed, for the audience to latch on to.
The principle character, Father Greg (Linus Roache), is far from
sympathetic and his odyssey does not make him sympathetic, while Father
Matthew (Tom Wilkinson), who might have filled that role, is not allowed
by the plot to occupy the film's centre. What is missing is an
uncomplicated, decent priest.
Greg, a narcissistic, priggish 30-year-old right winger who reads the
Times, arrives in a rundown Liverpool parish to discover that Father
Matthew, a clap-happy, Guardian reading chap, who sports woolly jumpers
and sings in the local karaoke, is sleeping with the housekeeper. He is
scandalised. But not for long. It is off with the dog collar, on with
the black leather and away on his bike to a gay disco where he eyes the
throng and collects Graham (Bobby Carlisle), a vulpine piece of Scottish
rough trade with whom he indulges his passions.
When a teenage girl tells Greg in the confessional that she is being
sexually abused by her father he is placed in a dreadful dilemma.
Already racked with guilt because of his own sexuality, this is the last
straw. He is bound by the seal of the confessional.
The girl refuses to let him talk to anybody about her situation, his
only means of escape, and her father, who finds out what she has done,
tells him to mind his own business. Greg and Graham are found by the
police having sex in a parked car, which leads to his disgrace and
abandonment by the bishop. One of the film's weaknesses is the way the
hierarchy is caricatured.
The most interesting of the issues raised is that of the confessional.
The seal cannot be broken, yet the girl has made a cry for help. She has
not confessed her own sin, but a sin against her.
How does a priest get out of this appalling situation? In the film God
works in mysterious ways -- or at least McGovern does -- because the
truth is revealed by accident. The mother, a church activist, goes home
early one night because Father Greg, tormented by his own sexual
problems, has ended a parish meeting prematurely, to finds her husband
having sex with the girl.
There is an argument to be made against having a celibate priesthood
because celibacy does impose unnatural strains on both men and women.
There is equally a case to be made for the seal of the confessional
being inviolable, but surely evil-doers should be stopped at all costs.
The priest, forced to allow the abuse to continue, can find no answer
when the outraged mother confronts him with the damning charge that he
knew all along. But, as a good Catholic, has she grounds to complain?
Priest is a film to argue over and enjoy, both for its intelligence
and the quality of the performances, as is Robert Redford's superb Quiz
Show. This immaculately directed and performed film restores one's faith
in Hollywood's ability to examine serious issues damaged by trivia like
Disclosure.
Paul Attanasio's excellent script is based on the true story of a
young, East-Coast academic, Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) who became
a contestant on a 1958 quiz show called Twenty One. He was resident
champion for weeks on end and became a celebrity, making the cover of
Time magazine and a lot of money. But he was being given the answers, as
was the man he replaced, Herbie Stempel (John Turturro). Van Doren, a
handsome WASP, is a ratings attraction, whereas Herbie, an autodidact,
is not even an appealing underdog. The decision, taken by the producers,
but with the connivance of the sponsors and the network, was purely
commercial. And if it was cheating, it was only entertainment.
The activities of the hugely popular quiz shows come under scrutiny by
a Congressional sub-committee whose investigator, Dick Goodwin (Rob
Morrow) comes up against a wall of silence. As a piece of detection it
works well enough, but it is the way Attanasio has looked at the the way
the people involved react which makes the film out of the ordinary.
Van Doren, the beloved son of a distinguished academic, Mark van Doren
(Paul Schofield reasserting his claim to be one of our greatest actors)
lives in his father's shadow. He is driven by greed, seduced by fame, by
being his own man for once. Goodwin, a Jew, first in his law class at
Harvard, deeply envious of this golden youth's background, is reluctant
to expose him. He is also repelled by Stemple, who comes from exactly
the sort of immigrant background he has left behind.
Schofield's pride in his beautiful, clever and suddenly famous son is
conveyed with often little more than the twitch of an eyebrow, a pulse
in the throat, and his grief when he realises how flawed the young man
is, comes over most affectingly. He gives the film's best performance,
but it is one of those films where everyone gives of their best.
Attanasio, by the way, also wrote Disclosure, but one should not hold
that against him.
In I.Q. Meg Ryan plays Albert Einstein's niece, a Princeton
mathematics lecturer, determined to wed a scientific genius. Instead she
falls in love with a garage mechanic, Tim Robbins. It is gentle
undemanding stuff, enlivened by a vintage performance from Walter
Matthau as Einstein backed by a trio of Jewish savants in similar
eccentric form played by Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher. Stephen
Fry, in his first Hollywood role, is Miss Ryan's stuffy British fiance.
Maybe he should have absconded to the Continent sooner.
As for S.F.W., it is Natural Born Killers without the wit. The title
refers to the catchphrase of the hero (Stephen Dorff), held hostage by
terrorists in a convenience store. National television makes him a
celebrity until a new hero is found, a new catchphrase coined. The title
stands for what you think and says it all.
All films open tomorrow.

WHEN the Charing Cross Tower Hotel opens officially tomorrow, a new
era will have dawned for eminently affordable hotel accommodation in the
centre of the city. Quality rooms for under #40 is the value for money
theme of this #4.8m initiative in Elmbank Gardens.
Business and independent leisure travellers will benefit from the
much-needed facility in the Continental and American convenience
stop-over style without breaking the bank. With 275 single, double or
twin rooms on its 14 floors plus an inexpensive self-service restaurant
and bar on the first floor mezzanine, the Charing Cross Tower is playing
its part in bringing more business to Glasgow.
The innovative Charing Cross Tower Hotel is only 15 minutes away from
Glasgow Airport and 40 minutes from Edinburgh Airport by car. Close to
the M8 motorway, linking effortlessly into the UK national road network
and into the rail network by way of Charing Cross station next door, it
makes a handy touring base for trips to Ayrshire's Burns country and the
Clyde coast. Scotland's highlands, islands and even Trossachs are within
easy travelling distance.
Glasgow amenities like the Stock Exchange and the surrounding business
quarter as well as the flourishing arts community are close at hand. The
SECC and Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum at Kelvingrove are close at
hand, the renowned Burrell Collection is not too far and the King's
Theatre, the Theatre Royal and the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall are but
brisk steps. The shopping centres of Sauchiehall Street, Buchanan
Street, Princes Square and St Enoch Centre are convenient attractions
nearby.
To appeal to the health-conscious, the top eight floors of the Charing
Cross Tower are no-smoking areas and key fobs with a green dot reflect
this. The lower floors are for the smokers, with red dots on their key
fobs to signify.
All bedrooms are bright, airy and spacious with double-glazing to
eliminate traffic noise and offer panoramic views of the Glasgow
cityscape. En suite bathrooms and higher than average ceilings impart a
sense of luxury and a skillful art deco effect has been achieved by the
intelligent use of lighting and maple wood furniture. Direct dial
telephone, tea and coffee equipment are standard, but a bonus for the TV
fan are a number of Sky television services including Sky Sports, Sky
News and a Sky Movie Channel at no extra charge. Complimentary parking
is another customer bonus.
The mezzanine on the first floor of the Charing Cross Tower Hotel
houses the informal and inexpensive restaurant and comfortable lounge
bar. Here the accent is on quiet relaxation, better than average value,
and service with a smile. Prices are moderate with a full Scottish
breakfast, all self-service, for under #5, three courses and coffee
lunch for #5.50 and an enticing three courses and coffee dinner package
for #9. There are so many quality restaurants in the vicinity that
guests are spoiled for choice if they don't want to eat in. A
comprehensive dining-out list is available on request which includes
some of the best Chinese, Indian, Italian and Good Food Guide
establishments in Scotland, only minutes along the road.
Main contractors for the revolutionary new hotel were Taylor Woodrow
Scotland Limited who handed it over to its owners, Glasgow-based
property development company Surveylink Projects Limited in a novel way
on St Valentine's day, well in time for the St Patrick's day opening. A
giant heart was created in the heart of Glasgow by utilising bedroom
lights on two sides of the 14-storey building, giving the electrical
system a final test in the process.
The extensive refurbishment contract, valued at #3.65m transformed the
former office tower designed in 1974 by Centre Point architect Richard
Seiffert. Glasgow's own Centre Point has now become a focal point hotel
looming above Charing Cross as a hospitality industry landmark.
The combination of its convenient city centre location, service and
quality value for money accommodation means that the Charing Cross Tower
Hotel has already been chosen as a new Glasgow destination by a host of
travel companies, including Trafalgar Tours, Studio Reisen, Blue Chip
Travel, Voyage Tavel, Anglo World and Continental Connections. The
conference market too has been quick off the mark to take advantage of
the keenly priced facilities. Already booked are a World Science Fiction
Convention and a gathering of Junior Chambers of Commerce.
At its peak the new venue created over 100 construction jobs, as well
as more than 40 permanent positions for hotel personnel.

THE new Charing Cross Tower Hotel is a made in Glasgow achievement.
Following research which highlighted the need for 600 value-for-money
quality hotel bedrooms in the city by 1995, Bill Forbes and Hugh Deans
of Surveylink Projects Limited, the Glasgow-based property development
company, responded to the challenge.
They seized the initiative to transform the focal point of
internationally-renowned architect Richard Seiffert's Charing Cross
Tower office complex for the 1970s, into a 275-bedroom convenience
stop-over hotel for the 1990s.
They harnessed the talents of a locally-based design and construction
team to create one of Scotland's first international hotels of its type
and have probably revolutionised the hotel industry north of the border
in the process.
Opportunity, expertise, circumstance and market forces played their
part, with support for the centrally-sited new concept hotel coming from
the Scottish Tourist Board and Glasgow City Council.
To find a suitable manager for the new project was no easy task but
the appointment of Eric Barlow, a graduate of the Glasgow College of
Food Technology with over 20 years in the trade on both sides of
Hadrian's Wall, prompted Bill Forbes, general manager of the Tower Hotel
Group to comment, ''Eric brings with him a wealth of expertise in
hospitality and customer care and we are delighted that such a seasoned
professional who is also a native of Glasgow will lead the management
team for this exciting new venture.''
He continued, ''We intend that the Charing Cross Tower Hotel's highly
competitive rate of #38.50 per room per night will set the benchmark in
the city for quality service and value for money in this exciting new
sector of the market. The new hotel will appeal specificially to the
business and conference visitor and to independent leisure travellers
and their families.''
The new hotel is operated by Castle Ventures Sixty-Two Limited for
Surveylink which has offices on the top floor. Preferential rates are
available for corporate clients as well as specially-negotiated terms
for conference delegates and groups. There is ramp access for the
disabled to the left of the revolving door.
There is a business centre and as there is no room service the
mezzanine floor is devoted to a self-service restaurant with seating for
100 and a cosy bar which holds 50 comfortably. The emphasis is on
flexibility, choice and value. Food is available throughout the day from
7am until 10pm. The bar hours are 11am until 2pm, and 5pm until midnight
from Monday to Saturday, and 12 noon until 2pm and 6.30pm until 11pm on
Sunday.
Eric Barlow is a real Scot who believes that a hearty breakfast sets
you up for the day. His breakfast menu from 7am in the mezzanine is
impressive. There is an extensive selection and cooked items include
eggs -- boiled, fried, poached or scrambled -- grilled back bacon, lorne
and link sausage, black and fruit pudding, potato scone, mushrooms,
tomatoes, hash browns and kippers. You can have a full Scottish early
morning tightener for #4.90 including tea and toast.

POLICE in West Lothian are hunting for two youths after a blazing gas
cylinder was fired 100 yards from a hut on to the roof of a Livingston
house. Mrs Annie Carlin, 55, her husband, Francis, 57, and son, Francis,
33, escaped unhurt from their home in Cameron Way, Knightsridge. The
impact knocked tiles from the roof but did not cause serious structural

VOTERS in the Broughty Ferry West ward of the new Dundee City Council
will have an interesting new party to vote for. Kenneth Singer, who is
actually standing for the SNP, got it a wee bit wrong on his nomination
form.
Under the bit headed ''Description'' he should have put his party
details. Instead he wrote ''retired master mariner''. Which is how it
should appear on the ballot paper.
This may lose him votes with the nationalists but might help with some
other voters. The Broughty Ferry ward takes in the lifeboat station and
Royal Tay Yacht Club.
* THE above cock-up is, at least, an improvement on a previous Dundee
election nomination when the candidate wrote under ''description'' the
words ''Five foot six tall, dark hair.''
* STILL on the local election front, football has reared its ugly head
in the Kilwinning East division of North Ayrshire Council. A Mr Dean
Adamson is standing under the Hands Off Abbey Park banner.
Abbey Park is the home of Kilwinning Rangers, the legendary junior
football club. The stadium is under threat as a local property developer
plans to build houses on the site.
There are those who would see the obliteration on Kilwinning Rangers
as a very sound electoral stance.
Sole searching
SOME of you people out there have not been taking seriously the Diary
competition to win a Scotland rugby jersey and an odd-shaped ball, both
signed by big Gav and the lads.
The goodies are provided courtesy of Famous Grouse, sponsors of the
Scotland team. Since the low-flier whisky company also sponsors the
forthcoming Rugby World Cup, we gave our quiz question a South African
theme.
We asked what Nelson Mandela would most likely take to the world cup
final: a hip flask of Famous Grouse, an All Blacks scarf, or his
official car. The answer was, of course, his official car. Our favourite
entry, however, was: ''Not a packed lunch made by his wife Winnie.''
The correct answers have been put into the hat but there is a
groundswell of opinion that we should have set a Scottish rugby
question. So here goes:
* Who played David Sole's partner in the TV series Starsky and Hutch?
Answers to Grand Slam Competition, Herald Diary, 195 Albion Street,
Glasgow G1 1QP. Correct entries will also go into the hat for the grand
draw next week.
Upwardly mobile
THE annual report of the Scottish Prison Officers' Association shows
an unhealthy obsession with uniform. Black socks, Nato-style jumpers,
and girls' blouses all feature.
Most worrying, however, is the reference to ''Trouser specification'':
''Management have now agreed to change the present trouser pattern to a
new specification to allow more movement for individuals.'' We have no
details as to the failings of the current style of prison officer's
breeks but the association, at their annual conference this week in
Peterhead, are pledged to pursue ''a better quality of trouser''.
Just your Donald
WHEN we mentioned last week Donald Maclean, the Western Isles
councillor who reserves the right to be confused, we did not know we
were dealing with a legend.
The councillor from North Uist used to be in the Glasgow polis and a
former colleague writes to tell us Donald was renowned for his
pawkiness. He cites one example. When Donald was a constable on the old
Southern Division, his beat took in the General Terminus Quay where ore
boats from South America docked with their cargo.
At that time, bobbies had to sign off at the end of their shift by
telephoning their divisional switchboard from one of the Dr Who-style
police boxes. Woe betide anyone who failed to call in, since the shift
inspector had to account for all his men before he could go home.
One night-shift, PC Maclean went on board one of the ore boats where
he was known to the crew members. He partook of a meal and a dram with
the stewards. So good was the hospitality that Donald the Polis failed
to notice the ship had set sail on its return journey to South America.
This presented the immediate problem as to how he was going to phone
in and clock off. Luckily for him, the ship's course doon the watter
took it close to a river police signal box manned, luckily, by one Peter
McKinnon, a chum fom the Isle of Coll.
Donald was able to attract Peter's attention and shout an instruction
to phone in on his behalf before he was carried off down the Clyde.
PC McKinnon duly obliged, but wondered if he'd ever see his pal again.
Donald's journey was mercifully short. The ship's pilot took him off on
the cutter at the Tail of the Bank and had him driven back to Glasgow.
Too bad really: he could have ended up as el presidente of some banana
republic rather than Cooncillor Maclean from Lochmaddy.
Variations
COLOURFUL demotic variations continue to surface on the old saying
''hauf past ten and not an erse skelpt''. Jack Angus of Glasgow offers
this version: ''Hauf past nine an' no' a hoor in the hoose waashed an'
the toffs comin' at nine''. Rob Parker of Skye remembers it differently:
''Hauf past ten an' there's no' a dish in the hoose washed an' the
toon's full o' American sailors''.
Hard bitten
THE Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow continues to defy belief
and, possibly the Trade Descriptions Act, with some of its art
exhibitions. The latest is the work of one Janine Antoni who, they tell
us, first attracted attention with a piece which ''consisted of two
600lb cubes, one moulded from lard and the other from chocolate. Antoni
literally chewed at these forms and remade the masticated excess into an
elegant display of chocolate hearts and lard-based lipsticks, leaving
the cubes as eroded minimalist motifs.
''Using her body as a tool to make art -- chiselling with teeth,
mopping with hair, moulding with the body -- she has continued to
explore ideas around beauty, female identity and art history.''

IT'S not clear if people, as opposed to politicians, give a toss about
the behaviour of newspapers. Journalists are despised (and quite right
too) but the belief that the press is a mad dog fit to be muzzled is
confined, by and large, to party poodles with sick grins who've just had
some bad publicity. Reassuringly, such individuals are even less popular
than those paid to write about them.
Whatever the scandals, we still elect politicians and still buy
newspapers. A peculiar British combination of prurience and deference
means that press freedom is both applauded and deplored, sometimes
simultaneously, by the sort of people who could misquote themselves and
not notice.
Rampaging tabloids are damned by parliamentary moralists yet the
great, listless British public goes on lapping up charmless revelations
and squalid exposes. Governments, Tory Governments in particular, are
always just about to do something about the papers. Their difficulty is
that of anyone preparing to bite the hand that feeds: do it and you
won't know where your next meal ticket is coming from. Conservative
papers, meaning most of the English titles, have done the party more
than one good turn. Why welsh on a deal that's proved so useful?
Privacy, in the politicians' definition, is a convenient cover.
It was the peculiar Michael Portillo who made a couple of speeches not
so very long ago to the effect that Britain is afflicted by cynicism.
How dare we refuse to trust our ''great institutions'' or the people
who run them? How could we drag a blameless monarchy through the mud, or
doubt the word of great statesmen at every turn? Shorn of claptrap it
was a demand for more deference, but it sounded like the whining of a
political class that has just been rumbled. Portillo, perhaps
unwittingly, put the argument in context: the people who actually run
Britain were growing increasingly irritated by a press doing its job.
It is easy to see why, and we should be clear about the reasons. In
the past few years the newspaper industry has curbed most of its
excesses.
Petty outrages involving private citizens are fewer now.
Self-regulation, as embodied by the Press Complaints Commission, has
succeeded (though no-one should speak too soon) in injecting a small
dose of ethics into the trade.
Calls for controls, such as they have been, have come from Tory MPs
(would a Labour Government really be different?) protecting their own or
using the royals as a shield.
So we arrive, amid absolutely no public demand, at the long-awaited
White Paper on the press due to be published next month. According to
leaked copies, National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell plans to
introduce a compensation fund, paid for by the industry, to provide
payments of up to #5000 for victims of press intrusion. Additionally, he
wants new criminal offences to ban electronic eavesdropping and the use
of telephoto photography, a ''hotline'' by which editors would be warned
of possible code of conduct breaches, and a greater independence of
approach in appointments to the PCC.
At this point things become interesting. Last year the commission
investigated 2300 complaints. Of these, only 9% dealt with privacy, and
of that number more than a few involved institutions rather than
individuals.
Of the 10 privacy complaints finally upheld, a grand total of five
involved a disgruntled Prince Edward, that notable man in the street,
who failed to appreciate being snapped kissing a girlfriend.
From all this a reasonable person might assume that the behaviour of
the British press is no longer a great social problem, if it ever was.
With libel laws among the toughest in the world, a PCC that is seen to
be functioning, and a pattern of media ownership which ensures that the
political dice are loaded in their favour, Government Ministers, in
particular, get an easier ride than they have any right to expect.
Contrast all this with the fact that David Hunt, our ''open
government'' Minister, has failed conspicuously to make officialdom any
more transparent, add the ludicrous Official Secrets Act and the
Draconian powers adopted by quangos, particularly in the health service,
to ensure that employees keep their traps shut, and you have a joke
Orwell might just have appreciated.
Nevertheless, Dorrell now expects editors serving on the PCC to act as
judge and jury and impose cash penalties on their peers.
It is not a major philosophical point, but one worth asking
nevertheless: if the newspaper industry is not self-regulating how can
it possibly be free? If the press is not meant to be free, what kind of
system is it that all these brave Westminster democrats are defending?

THE problem was complex. How was I to reach Cheltenham in time to make
considerable donations to the Bookmakers' Retirement in the West Indies
Fund? I could have driven but to be honest the M6 holds few charms, with
or without the lorries tossing back the muck on to your windscreen; I
should arrive feeling like a burned-out fan-belt.
I could have flown -- to London, then across country or even, someone
informed me, to the little airport just outside Cheltenham itself. But
you and I know that wee airports are served by wee planes and I am most
unhappy in them.
It was when the stewardess crawled back with the coffee on a minor
American airline last summer that I swore never again.
No, it was take-the-train time, the first long trip by rail for a
considerable period. All aboard the Cornish Scot.
Yes, that is what this particular train is called and it runs from
Edinburgh to Penzance, stopping twice at Motherwell. It halts there on
the first stage of the journey to Glasgow and, just in case you have
missed a shot of Ravenscraig, it calls in again en route to Carlisle. I
waved merrily to the crowds of Conservatives lining the platforms!
At all points on this cross-country run we were kept fully informed by
our senior conductor. ''I am sorry,'' he intoned gravely, ''that we
cannot enter Glasgow Central Station. This is because there is no
platform for us.'' Let's hang on, I voted.
Despite this mishap we were soon dieseling deep into the English
countryside. At Penrith I was joined in my section by an elderly lady,
by Lancaster we had discovered mutual friends, by Stafford I had bought
her a coffee, she had supplied a pheasant sandwich.
I have been on hundreds of flights in my life and no caterer has ever
capped that.
The buffet attendant was insistent that he had ''a full stock of
alcoholic beverages'' and I thought it was only polite to purchase a gin
and tonic. No car, no problem.
As we pulled into Wolverhampton a Scottish party began to take shape;
the leader of it informed his pals that I was an MP who had his own
television show and wrote for the newspapers. I signed his book ''Jack
McLean'' and he went off happy as Larry. If he writes to Jack he can
tell him who Larry was.
At Cheltenham Spa we pulled in at 3.40pm precisely, right on schedule.
The old lady waved her walking stick in a jolly goodbye and I was rather
sorry to leave.
Now, I remember, only too well, the bad old days of BR. ''This train
is late because of a delay,'' and ''nothing to do with me, sir, I don't
make up the timetables''.
There was no-one ever prepared to accept responsibility for anything.
These days have gone; and they have departed, though you will never
hear a railwayman admit it, because a Tory Government demanded new
standards of behaviour and efficiency. My party has nothing to apologise
about the railways, nor about the privatisation of British Airways, of
British Telecom, or of British Gas. All of those companies, and their
customers, have benefited.
A couple of weeks ago we had a gas leak. A British Gas man was there
in half-an-hour, identified the problem in 15 minutes and fixed it in
10. The cost? No charge.
So I am an enthusiastic privateer, a shareholder -- I even bought
PowerGen and I am not in the least put out that they had a slight fall
-- and proud to recognise the drop in domestic bills and the rise in
profits. Do you remember what we had to shell out from the public purse
in the ''good old days''? But I'll tell you this, colleagues, I fear we
are about to make a porker's petit dejeuner of the railways
privatisation, and I believe it to be the most popular policy since the
poll tax. Townee Blur and the boys must pray every night that we do not
ditch the whole idea.
When Willie Whitelaw says he is worried about the future of the West
Coast line I share all his concerns. When Chris Green scarpers from
ScotRail you have to wonder who thought this whole policy through. When
Sir Bob Reid says it is being done in the wrong way are we not better to
pull into the sidings for some thought? These are men I know and
respect, at least two of them Tories. Their objections cannot surely be
on ideological grounds.
What troubles me most of all is the Government's failure to spell out
how the new privatised companies will operate. I asked six intelligent
people at dinner the other night whether they could interpret the
Government's plans; not a single one could do so.
Yes, we all knew that one company is to own the track, several others
the trains. What we all failed to grasp is how that is going to make the
operation more efficient.
Where will you be able to buy tickets for where and for how much is
shrouded in smoke.
Maybe there is a clear explanation; if so, I suggest someone other
than Dr Brian Mawhinney, a kind man from whom one would hesitate to
accept directions, takes over the task.
I do not know whether, under the replacement Clause 4, which reads
like an Inland Revenue form on guidance to Schedule D rather than a
statement of great principles, means Labour would, if they had the
opportunity, take the railways back into public ownership. If they
wanted to be popular they almost certainly would.
With the General Election not too far down the track, with the
Conservatives making little impact on the opinion polls, the bottom line
is this: who is going to buy shares in these new companies? Not me. Mrs
Thatcher didn't like trains; most of the present Cabinet show little
interest in them either.  They should perhaps ride the rails again
before they are stuffed in the guard's van.

Robbie Dinwoodie reports on a clear answer to a simple question
LIKE crampons on an icy slope, publicly funded, independent academic
research showing that the English are 51:44 in favour of devolution
could be just what is needed to prevent the issue slipping off the
political agenda.
For it will be very hard for the Government simply to dismiss these
findings, which give a clear answer to a simple question, and the result
may just serve to stiffen Labour's flagging resolve on constitutional
change south of the Border.
Labour have continued to claim strongly that the cases for devolution
for Wales and Scotland stand on their own merits and are not dependent
on regional governance in England going ahead, but this is to ignore the
reality of the hurly-burly of political debate.
English devolution not only answers the West Lothian question -- even
if many deny the validity of that question -- but provides a
philosophical consistency which underpins the case for constitutional
change.
There are interesting comparisons -- as well as underlying
similarities -- between these early findings of the Public Opinion and
Local Citizenship survey, which is funded by the Economic and Social
Research Council and conducted by the University of Strathclyde and
University of Glasgow, and last month's poll of English voters carried
out for The Herald by System Three.
Our poll found a relatively narrow majority against the specific idea
of assemblies for Scotland, Wales, and the English regions if this was
subject to a referendum tomorrow. This gave 35% in favour, 39% against,
and 25% saying they didn't know.
The Herald/System Three poll did, however, give ''don't know'' as a
stated option among the answers and was also fairly specific in
describing what was, in effect Labour's overall scheme. Conservative
hostility (on a 60:24 ratio) was therefore more explicable.
The Strathclyde/Glasgow academic study asked a broader, perhaps more
aspirational question: ''Would you support or oppose giving greater
powers of self-government to (your region, by name), by means of an
elected council or assembly for the whole of (your region).''
The option of a ''don't know'' was not offered, although people could
insist on stating this as their view. The result was a dramatic
concentration of minds, slashing through the apparent apathy and
indecision we had found (25%) and reducing this to a mere 5%.
The result of the Local Citizenship survey is also interesting in
terms of the overall result, the party breakdown, the English regional
breakdown, and also to some extent the Scottish implications.
The fact that even in England there was a 51:44 response in favour is
bound to startle the Prime Minister's policy advisers, who have been
assuring him that the status quo is a vote-winner. Wales too, is seen as
markedly more enthusiastic, in favour by 58:37.
Another way in which the two surveys bolster each other is the general
consistency of the English regional breakdown. East Anglia came out
negative to change in both, perhaps unsurprisingly given that it is
strongly Conservative and doing well as a region, gaining the benefits
of proximity to the South-east without the problems of the metropolis
itself.
The region most strongly in favour of devolution in the new poll is
London itself, a 63:28 clarion call for the return of some form of
Greater London Council. The South-east outside London is the only other
region to reject it, 54:42. Our poll, which did not treat the two
separately, was marginally in favour.
Elsewhere, all the other five regions were in favour, with majorities
largely dovetailing our results last month when the undecided were taken
out of the equation. Yorkshire and Humberside had a 10-point margin in
favour, the North-east 12 points, and the North-west a whacking 25
points.
What are the implications of the Scottish result? Well, 72:22 is a
crushing margin by any standard, especially given that some of the 22%
may be strong independence voters who distrust or reject devolution.
This latter doubt may also have contributed to a fractionally
higher-than-average number of don't knows, at 6%.
But one reading of the Scots view expressed is that within the
overwhelming demand for greater, though unspecified, self-government is
the possibility that they are happy to take devolution as a step towards
independence.
Given that neither of these two words is specifically mentioned, the
poll result will not pose problems for the SNP, while it will be
particularly welcomed by Labour and the Scottish Liberals. For
Conservatives, however, whether north or south of the Border, it makes
grim reading.

James Freeman reports on the gun madness hitting the streets of
Paisley.
BY A superb irony, when Chief Constable Leslie Sharp of Strathclyde
Police today announces another set of improving figures, they will
include a 10% crime reduction in his Renfreshire (K) Division which
covers Paisley, Johnston and Linwood -- those towns where the headlines
point up an outbreak of gun war in the streets.
Even now he may be redrafting his notes. No chief constable, even such
a successful motivator as Leslie Sharp, could have bargained for the
events of the last fortnight.
The local criminals appear to have gone totally mad and, almost
inevitably, the root cause is the drug trade.
In the early 1980s, the streets and the housing schemes of Glasgow
were carved up by a handful of localised criminal gangs or ''teams'',
each headed up by a powerful leader or family -- men who were full-time,
career criminals. The names are well known and trip off the tongue.
The sums of money involved are not in themselves spectacular, not when
compared with giant business frauds or the unimaginable figures lost --
many would say criminally -- on currency or futures markets, but a few
thousand pounds a week means a substantial income for a common street
criminal in areas of extreme poverty.
When cases come before the courts it is easy to be surprised at how
mean the sums of money involved actually are compared to the horrendous
levels of violence.
The point was that the market in Glasgow achieved a certain
equilibrium after such turf battles as the Ice Cream Wars (when the sale
of heroin was a factor) or the warfare in the East End in more recent
years which eventually prompted a serious police crackdown when the East
End was squeezed until the pips squeaked.
The result of that has been a diminished level of extreme violence, at
least the very public kind, which accompanied drugs.
That has not been the case in some of the peripheral communities
around Glasgow where control and domination in the criminal underclass
has been less clear cut.
While recent shootings in Larkhall and its neighbouring communities
can be discounted as family feuds the reality is that each one of the
small communities of Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Ayrshire, even rural
Argyll, now has a drug scene, a section of its youth whose culture is
based on poly-drug misuse.
Equally, an enormous industry based on public funds has arisen around
this comparative handful of young people, aimed at dealing with the drug
abuse fall-out, reducing the harm they do to themselves, their families
and their communities by education and persuasion.
That in itself, stemming from the current thrust of Government policy
towards drugs, would appear to imply a tacit acceptance that a certain
level of drug misuse is with us to stay. The methodone distribution
programmes in Glasgow, based on similar efforts in Edinburgh where
claims are made that the culture of injecting has been changed with
benefits for public health, is a perfect example.
It is on that pervasive drug culture in the Renfrewshire burghs that
the spotlight currently falls. Two criminal families and their
associates have in recent years been deeply involved in the immediate
vicinity but neither has gained ascendency in the supply of drugs. The
increased availability of illegal firearms has brought a new dimension
to their warfare.
Informed sources in the area recount tales of youngsters being forced
to take part in shotgun robberies on banks, building societies and post
offices in order to erase heroin debts. Some, it is alleged, have then
been shopped to the police, just to encourage the others to keep paying
up.
In some cases of shootings or attempted shootings the young hit men
are said to be ''recruited'' on the same basis -- take part to cover
your debts or you will be the victim.
Totally innocent local people, including the hapless couple through
whose ceiling a pair of young men who had allegedly threatened police
with a handgun crashed and held them hostage earlier this week, have
been caught in the cross-fire.
Several people utterly unconnected with drug dealing or crime have
reportedly answered their doors to find themselves facing weapons and
threats, victims of mistaken identity. One man said calmly to the young
criminals: ''I think it's next door you want'', and received a hasty
apology.
Yet the market involved in Renfrewshire may actually involve as few as
2000 people. One man with his finger on the local pulse says that the
majority of these abusers will be of school age, from around 12 upwards.
Many will still actually be at school although a high proportion of
these will be experimenting. Very recently, David Bryce of the famous
Calton Athletic recovery group in Glasgow's East End was addressing
three school classes in the city, 60 young pupils of whom only three had
not used drugs. And Paisley, Linwood, Johnstone, Barrhead and Renfrew
mirror the Glasgow scene.
There are now indisputable links between poverty, deprivation and
unemployment and abuse of drugs -- especially alcohol and tobacco and
their associated health problems. Samples gathered by the Scottish Drugs
Forum from abusers coming into contact with a variety of agencies
indicate that Paisley has even higher levels of some forms of abuse,
including injecting, than Glasgow.
Owen Taylor, leader of the Labour Group on Renfrewshire District
Council, is in little doubt that poverty and unemployment which is
higher than the Scottish average are significant factors.
''Paisley and its surrounding towns were once the centre of great
thriving industries -- textiles, cars, engineering -- which in the past
provided young men with gainful employment. Government policies have led
to the destruction of these industries. There is no employment for these
young men. But they are full of energy.
''At the same time this government was elected 15 years ago as a law
and order government, yet crime has more than doubled in that period.
People were urged to question community responsibilities, to look after
number one. They preached self advancement at the expense of the
community. When you see government ministers taking #1000 for asking a
question then all bets are off.
''The drugs trade is a legitimate expression of Thatcherism -- take
what you can, profit out of misery. Youngsters here see one man in the
street with a flash car and flash clothes. Is it surprising they get
involved?''

Joan McFadden puts the case for a more open attitude towards the
benefits of breast feeding
RESEARCH has produced continuing evidence of the benefits of
breast-feeding, but even the strongest supporter of late-weaning admit
to being surprised at claims by an American professor that the
biologically natural time for humans to wean is when their child is
between three and six years of age.
It is thought that the great majority of babies in Britain were
breastfed until the 1930s, but by the mid-1960s, 49% of infants in
Scotland were not breastfed. By 1990, breast-feeding rates in Scotland
were the second lowest in Europe with only 50% of women feeding from
birth. Of those who started breast-feeding, 40% gave up within six
weeks, with less than 10% continuing to feed at nine months.
The traditional reasons for this lack of enthusiasm are varied. One is
that breasts are valued only for their sexual potential, an attitude
held by both men and women alike. Some men find the idea of their
partners breast-feeding totally abhorrent, which also colours their
partners' approach to nursing.
The younger the mother, the less likely she is to breastfeed.
Organisations which promote breast-feeding, such as the National
Childbirth Trust and La Leche League, have it seems made limited
in-roads.
Health authorities and professionals have not been blameless. In the
past the benefits of breast-feeding for both mother and child were only
occasionally discussed, but many clinicians were totally unprepared to
offer the necessary encouragement and support needed by novice nursing
mothers.
Within maternity units, baby-milk manufacturers had, and continue to
have, a field day, openly promoting their products by providing free
samples ready for use in handy sterile bottles. The work involved in
sterilising bottles and teats, making up feeds and heating them quickly
enough for a screaming baby was rarely explained.
During pregnancy, ante-natal classes skimmed over the practicalities
of breast-feeding, neglecting to mention possible difficulties. This
lack of information resulted in many mothers who had planned to
breastfeed giving up at the first sign of problems. They were not told
about teaching a baby to suckle properly, how to avoid or treat painful
nipples and what to expect as the child settled into its feeding
pattern.
When advised: ''Just give them a bottle,'' by a so-called expert, many
women did just that, unaware that by so doing, they were diminishing
their milk-supply and effectively signalling the end of breast-feeding.
It appears that until recently breast-feeding was an all-or-nothing
issue. Either you were wholeheartedly in favour of it, or totally
against it. However, the last few years have heralded a change in
attitude and practice which is becoming prevalent.
Most health authorities are now actively promoting breast-feeding and
attempting to educate and reshape opinion at grass-roots level. However,
within many health organisation there are individuals who refuse to
update their approach.
Judy Inglis, a health visitor at Springburn Health Centre, in Glasgow,
fervently hopes that the old ways are on the decline. Within her area,
where mothers of all ages traditionally bottle-fed, she is delighted to
report an increase in breast-feeding, paralleled by a similar rise in
partner and family support for nursing mothers.
She cites the Bloomsbury Workshop, for midwives throughout Glasgow,
where the staff are trained to support and encourage nursing mothers, as
being a moving force in the promotion of breast-feeding. The workshops
encourage expectant mothers to attend along with their midwives for part
of the time.
Kathy Harding, a midwife at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, agrees that
times are changing and positive education is the key. A baby-friendly
hospital initiative is currently in operation within the Grampian
Region, looking to change public attitudes to breast-feeding in general.
With a firm ''get them young'' policy, a poster competition
encouraging breast-feeding is planned for schools throughout the area. A
competition last year among school children for a campaign slogan came
up with the caption ''Mothers' Brew is Best For You''. Harding says this
aptly summed up current thinking, and, she hopes, it will reflect the
attitude of the next generation of parents.
The practical aspects of easy and relaxed breast-feeding in every
situation are being catered for in much greater numbers by local
businesses and shops, as more and more provide clean and attractive
feeding and changing rooms.
Similar developments are taking place in maternity hospitals
throughout the Lothian region, according to Dr Anne Wallace. As
consultant in Public Health Medicine for Lothian Health she is involved
in promoting improved support for mothers who wish to breastfeed. Having
examined services in the context of the World Health Health
Organisation/UNICEF Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, Lothian's
maternity hospitals aim to improve their approach to breast-feeding
across the board.
Its Health Promotion Department is helping with the training of
midwives in Bloomsbury techniques and it hopes in time to extend the
same initiatives to health visitors and develop a uniform approach
across the service.
This prevailing feeling of optimism amongst the experts comes as no
surprise to Jenny Warren co-ordinator of the Scottish Joint
Breast-feeding Initiative. The SJBI was launched in 1991, with
objectives of care and support, education and audit. The audit commenced
in November 1992, aiming to determine women's feeding intentions,
measure success in establishing feeding, and analyse factors
contributing to that success or failure.
While the study is still underway with publication expected in June,
Warren feels that early indications suggest that the duration of
breast-feeding is increasing.
In 1968, in a paper written for the National Childbirth Trust's
conference, D W Winnicott wrote that a baby suckling at the breast is
''gathering stuff for dreaming''. Nearly 30 years later many of the
pro-feeding experts would say that their dreams are finally coming true.

SCOT Andrew Dougal, an accountant from up here who's doing rather well
down in London, is set to become finance director of Hanson PLC -- one
of the UK's biggest and most exciting companies.
Shareholders of the acquisitive Anglo-US conglomerate are expected to
approve the recently announced demerger of 34 non-core Hanson businesses
in the US, clearing the way for the 43-year-old former Paisley Grammar
lad's promotion.
He moved back to Hanson's head office only about 14 months ago so the
US Industries demerger allows him to move up in June -- more quickly
than he had anticipated.
Current finance director, Bill Landuyt, is returning to the US as
chief executive of Hanson Industries, succeeding David Clarke, who will
become chairman and chief executive of the demerged US Industries.
Mr Dougal was somewhat surprised when he received the call back to
headquarters from UK aggregates operation ARC, to be deputy finance
director and an associate director of Hanson.
He said: ''At that point I think I was optimistic that, in due course,
I might become finance director of Hanson. However, I probably expected
it would take quite a few years for that situation to develop.''
However, the coals, chemicals, material handling, tobacco, propane,
building materials and timber conglomerate then decided to demerge its
non-core US businesses, which have annual revenues of $3000m and include
Jacuzzi Whirlpool Baths.
Suddenly Mr Dougal, who lives in Surrey with PE teacher wife Margaret,
15-year-old daughter Alison, and sons Gavin and Calum, aged 12 and two
found himself with a new challenge.
Although he has been away for a while, Mr Dougal, who was educated at
Greenock Academy before going on to Paisley Grammar, has certainly not
forgotten his Scottish roots.
His fervent belief that the Scottish rugby squad will emerge
victorious from Saturday's Grand Slam showdown at Twickenham appears to
be one of the few bones of contention between him and chief executive
Derek Bonham.
Mr Bonham was the man who hand-picked Mr Dougal for Hanson in 1986, in
line with the company's policy of selecting relatively youthful
high-achievers who are not set in their ways, giving them responsibility
and letting them get on with it.
The finance director-in-waiting's mum Muriel, a lawyer's secretary who
now lives in Barrhead, can be rightly proud of her son's progress.
After graduating from Glasgow University as a Bachelor of Accountancy
in 1972, Mr Dougal took his fledgling steps up the corporate ladder at
accountancy firm Arthur Young in Glasgow.
Ernst &amp; Young, formed by the merger of Arthur Young and Ernst &amp;
Whinney, is currently Hanson's auditor.
Colleagues' high hopes for Mr Dougal, a popular and respected
character who trained with them worked for Arthur Young until 1977, have
certainly proved well-founded.
Ian Ogle, who became the first managing partner of Arthur Young during
Mr Dougal's time there, remembers him as a ''rising star''.
Mr Ogle, 60, now a senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young, said: ''He was
certainly one of the chaps that we all wanted to get on our jobs.''
Ernst &amp; Young audit partner Ian Lee remembers Mr Dougal well, even
though he was never out on any audits with him.
Mr Lee, 47, said: ''I remember we were disappointed when he left
because he was reckoned to be a high-flier. I am not totally surprised
to hear of his latest exploits.''
During his time with Arthur Young, Mr Dougal progressed to acting
audit manager for its principal clients, including the mighty
Distillers.
In 1977, he moved into commerce with Scottish and Universal
Investments or SUITs, the Fraser family's industrial holding company
whose interests included the Glasgow Herald (as it was then called) and
the Evening Times. Mr Dougal considered SUITs to be ''the most
progressive, productive, efficient and growing Scottish quoted
company''.
He remained there for six years after the takeover by Lonrho in 1980,
no doubt gaining invaluable experience from the conglomerate's use of
its SUITs subsidiary as the vehicle for acquisitions, a subject very
dear to Lord Hanson's heart.
Taking the view that SUITs was becoming secondary to Lonrho's
preoccupation with the acquisition of House of Fraser, in which SUITs
had a 30% stake, Mr Dougal, by that time acting finance director,
decided the time was ripe for a move.
After replying to an advertisement in the Financial Times and a
meeting with Mr Bonham, Mr Dougal joined Hanson as financial controller
in 1986.
He became finance director of ARC, the largest subsidiary of
Consolidated Goldfields, in 1989. In 1992, Mr Dougal was appointed
managing director of ARC Southern, ARC's largest subsidiary.
In his new role, he will find himself working with energetic chairman
Lord Hanson on a one-to-one basis for the first time.
Mr Dougal said: ''In my involvements with him so far, I certainly find
him to be a dynamic character and one of the real entrepreneurs.
''He is quite rightly credited with tremendous success in growing
businesses from almost a standing start.''
Mulling over the outlook for Hanson but failing to satisfy the City's
curiosity about its next swoop, Mr Dougal said: ''We are very positive
indeed about the prospects for the group profits for the next few years.
''We don't feel under pressure to make an acquisition. An acquisition
would be at the right time, when the right opportunity arose.''

The Prestwick Airport chief delivers a strong message. David Steele
reports
MATTHEW Hudson's message to a conference on transport yesterday was
clear. Tourism should be far and away our most successful industry but
has been failed by successive Governments.
His choice of targets may not sit easily with some but it is certain
that, as before, the thoughts of chairman Matthew will lead to vigorous
debate in the tourism and transport industries.
Mr Hudson, the Canadian-born businessman who led a consortium which
took over Prestwick Airport on April Fool's Day 1992, has never been
backward in coming forward on a wide variety of subjects.
Yesterday he turned his attention to tourism and told the conference
in Falkirk that unless government allows the industry -- and the
commercial concerns therein -- more freedom to operate then it will
continue to die a slow death.
While Mr Hudson displayed to his audience a traditional willingness to
champion the cause of his airport, and attacked his usual betes noires,
he took the argument a stage forward and sought to trigger a wider
debate than that of the stultified Prestwick versus Glasgow argument.
He described tourism as the national cottage industry, the largest
market of which is overseas, but warned that the business plan is flawed
because we do not have direct delivery systems capable of accessing
prime markets at competitive cost. Mr Hudson said that the cost of
linking to the London gateway remains prohibitive and announced that PIK
in partnership with an unnamed airline and the railway companies are
hopeful of introducing an #80 package from London to any Scottish
destination by air and rail via Prestwick.
He added: ''This is one example of the handcuffs which are put on
Scottish operators. We hope that the authorities will unlock these
handcuffs by coming forward with route licences between Prestwick and
London.
''We still do not have a Scottish aviation policy and most, if not
all, value-added industries in Scotland are thus needlessly handicapped.
This includes tourism and electronics to name but two.'' Mr Hudson
called on the Government to pull down the barriers which inhibit
Scottish tourism, in particular the obsession with the London gateway
and the failure to recognise that Scotland needs more aviation freedom.
He also urged the same kind of approach for tourism as is taken with
inward investment and a similar bank of support services such as the
Scottish Office and Locate in Scotland to be on hand to help.
Mr Hudson continued: ''Tourism is the world's number one industry. It
is ''export'' sales in their best form, instead of moving a small number
of goods and services to the foreign customer, tourism is the business
which moves the foreign customer to all of our goods and services.
''If Government regarded tourism as a good industrial investment, and
therefore worthy of targeted, project-oriented financial assistance, it
would be possible to develop the missing mechanisms to enhance
Scotland's earnings and employment from tourism on a sustainable
basis.'' Mr Hudson cited the example of services between Prestwick and
Dublin which have seen the market double without Government help.
The PIK chairman said that the lack of a common rating on fares
through London discouraged people coming in to the gateway airports from
heading north to Scotland and called for an initiative to attract a
wider range of carriers offering a wider range of services linking
Scotland with other important markets.
Mr Hudson would like to see a data base set up which gives tourists
the ''building blocks'' with which to create their own package holidays
and an encouragement given to companies to invest in an all-Scotland
reservations system.
In a radical approach to international air travel Mr Hudson said that
routes which touched Scotland on the way to Europe from North America
should be encouraged and that, with the breaking down of barriers,
tourists could stop off en route and their places be taken by tourists
heading for a short-haul trip to Europe.
On the role of the Scottish Tourist Board, Mr Hudson praised its
''past experience and present dynamism'', but added: ''Against this, one
must also acknowledge the paucity of its funding and its reliance on the
British Tourist Authority. Both are unhelpful.'' Mr Hudson suggested
that the STB and a consortium of local enterprise companies could own
and operate a Scottish reservations system and charge customers a levy
and percentage on sales.
In the beginning, he said, the system may have to be funded but he
predicted that it would be a money spinner and would create funds for
additional marketing overseas.
He called for the creation of low-cost services from the London
gateway as well as regional airports in North America and Europe and for
the setting up of more Scottish package holidays of varying length.
In a further reference to the Scotland/Ireland comparison he said that
the markets are so similar that it must only be the better ''delivery
mechanisms'' across the Irish Sea which are spawning such success.
Mr Hudson called on the Government, which he accused of failing to
believe in free and open competition in the transport market-place, to
''release the shackles'' and allow everyone to compete.

BARELY a day seems to go by without hearing news of another company
chairman or chief executive earning a telephone number salary. Perhaps
this is the real reason why British Telecom has just added an additional
digit to every telephone number.
Anyone would think that a prerequisite for running an efficient
business, whether in the public or private sector, is a top table full
of fat cats. In the case of the privatised regional electricity and
water companies there has been a justified outcry over the huge salary
increases awarded to the industry bosses for doing little more than they
did when the industry was in public hands.
In many cases what diversification there has been away from the core
business has proved disastrous. This has led to costly restructuring
resulting in wasted money and the loss of a vast number of jobs.
Company bosses justify their hefty salary increases and generous share
options by saying they are necessary to attract the right people. But I
am sure there would be no shortage of willing and competent takers for
these jobs even if the renumeration packages were halved.
If money is the only consideration taken into account when seeking to
fill a post then it does not necessarily follow that the right sort of
person will be in the job. Doctors, teachers, nurses, and many more
essential roles in society pay considerably less money but attract
excellent people.
Not all large companies feel the need to be as greedy. The John Lewis
Partnership is an excellent example of a responsibly run profitable
organisation. As far as anyone working there can remember, it has never
lost a senior executive to a rival organisation despite the fact that it
offers a lower salary than many of its competitors. In addition, because
it is a partnership and not listed on the London Stock Exchange, there
are no lucrative share options.
Everyone from the board down to the shop floor benefits when times are
good. Last week, the company announced a 12% bonus for all its 34,000
permanent staff (called partners), equivalent to six weeks' extra pay.
This was in recognition of the 25% increase in profits last year to just
under #117m on the back of a 6% rise in sales to just over #2500m.
Commenting on the results, Chairman Stuart Hampson said: ''Partners
can take real pleasure in sharing the reward for all the hard work that
has made these results possible''. All too often the rewards are shared
among just a few at the top.
However, at John Lewis Partnership, the chairman's salary has
historically been capped using a formula related to a multiple of the
salary of its lowest-paid shopworker in central London who also has four
dependent children. This is enshrined in the group's written
constitution established in 1929.
Effectively this caps the chairman's current salary at between
#450,000 and #500,000, but in reality he earns much less than this. In
last year's accounts Chairman Stuart Hampson earned #274,000 including
bonuses and fringe benefits. This is in contrast to the #1.3m earned by
Geoffrey Mulcahy, chief executive of Kingfisher, the troubled retail
group that includes Comet and Woolworths.
John Lewis sets an example that many other firms are increasingly keen
to follow in terms of worker participation. As well as sharing in the
profits, the staff are kept fully informed on a regular basis of what is
happening within the business. This is done through a weekly magazine
and various committees and councils on which the staff are represented.
Mr Hampson believes that it is important to recognise that there are
many stakeholders in the business including the staff, customers, and
suppliers. It is refreshing to hear such corporate responsibility when
the pursuit of profit irrespective of wider social obligations appears
to be the norm.
During the boom of the late 1980s when consumer excess was in vogue,
John Lewis was thought to be a little tired and old fashioned, a bit
like a favourite aunt. But it has come into its own in the 1990s when
people have once again focused on quality, service, good value, and
reliability. This despite the fact that it remains committed to trading
in the High Street while rivals drift out to out-of-town retail parks.
It runs 22 department stores in major towns and cities across the UK
including Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Negotiations are at an advanced stage
on a site in Buchanan Street in Glasgow, opposite the concert hall.
Many organisations pay lip service to the notion of being one big
happy family from the boardroom down to the shop floor but in reality
there is a big chasm between the managers and those who are managed. The
same is true for customer service which has become the corporate
buzzword in the more cautious trading environment of the 1990s. In
reality, though, there still seems to be as many surly, unhelpful sales
staff as ever.
John Lewis has shown there is a better, more sensitive way of trading
which is actually putting them at a competitive advantage.

EDINBURGH Zoo yesterday unveiled its newest addition -- a
three-week-old pygmy hippopotamus called Hope.
The rare 17kg infant is the ninth and final calf -- and the last
''hope'' -- for her 25-year-old mother, Frieda, and 19-year-old father,
Fred.
Despite the winter sunshine, the cute black youngster shivered under
the watchful eye of mum in their outdoor pen -- a million miles from
their usual habitat in west Africa.
Hundreds of schoolchildren have been delighted by the new arrival,
which weighed 7kg when she was born on February 22.
Edinburgh is one of only two zoos in Britain successfully to have bred
the solitary reclusive hippos, which are under threat because of the
destruction of their native rain forest homes.
The zoo is sending Hope's sister, Cleo, to Canada to establish a new
breeding group of the protected species at Toronto Zoo. Cleo earned her
name after developing a taste for swimming in evaporated milk after her
mum developed mastitis shortly after her birth in 1992.

A DRUG addict may have been responsible for a raid at a Scottish
hospital, during which a batch of dangerous drugs used in transplant
operations were stolen.
Yesterday, as detectives investigated the incident, management at the
Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh launched an internal inquiry into the
break-in at an operating theatre.
Officials are trying to establish how the thief penetrated the
stringent security.
Lothians and Borders Police has issued a warning to the public about
the drugs, which are used to relax muscles but if injected
inappropriately are likely to prove fatal.
In the raid, which happened some time during the past five days, a
quantity of Tracrium, Pancuronium, and Scoline disappeared. They are
contained in clear ampules in dosages of 2mls and 5mls.
A police spokesman said: ''We cannot rule out the possibility that an
addict may be responsible, but the fear is that they may be discarded
and come into contact with the general public.
''Should anyone find these drugs they must contact the police
immediately,'' he said.

From MURRAY RITCHIE, European Editor, Strasbourg
THE European Commission yesterday approved aid packages worth #52m for
north and west Grampian, rural Stirling, and upland Tayside.
The money will cover part of EU spending on so-called Objective 5b
areas of Scotland and is meant to assist rural development. It was made
available as part of an increased structural aid programme by the
Edinburgh summit in 1992.
Various proposals for how the money should be spent have now been
agreed and will require matching funding from the Government. The
decision yesterday is the culmination of years of campaigning by local
authorities and the Scottish Office for Euro-funding.
The money will be spent on five main areas: diversified farming;
economic activity and job creation; better infrastructure for economic
development; development of human resources; and development of natural
resources and the environment.
North and west Grampian will receive #30m and most of that will be
spent in the area bordering the Highlands and Islands which already
receives Objective 1 funding, the richest source of structural aid for
needy areas in Europe.
The commission noted that the area of Grampian under review had
suffered falling employment in fishing and farming in the past decade.
Its remoteness and the small scale of its local market also posed
problems.
''The region's major asset is its high-quality environment,'' the
commission reported. ''Stress will be laid on developing this through
tourism. The food industry offers good development prospects for
processed products with high value added.''
The idea is to create 4400 extra jobs and 420 new firms and to raise
training activities in the area.
The commission said #20m would go to rural Stirling and upland
Tayside, areas also heavily dependent on farming. ''However it is a
fragile rural area with a weak population structure,'' the commission
noted.
The commission formally agreed this latest tranche of structural
support for Scotland after a proposal from Mr Franz Fischler, the
farming commissioner.

<HEADLINE>Bank loss over jailed Russian and a cheque</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Bank of Scotland has failed in a court action to recover #16,000
from a Russian who is in Dumfries Prison facing deportation.
Bank staff were also strongly criticised by Sheriff James Smith, who
spoke of an astonishing tale of incompetence.
Alex Nicholas Valentine Kond was sued by the bank after he was
convicted last August at Stranraer Sheriff Court of stealing a cheque
from Mr Richard Cunningham of Portpatrick and uttering it as genuine.
While in Scotland in April last year, Kond had befriended retired
civil engineer Richard Cunningham, 57, of Station View, Portpatrick, and
had stayed there for a time.
In a written judgment, Sheriff Smith says that on April 20, Kond, at
the Stranraer bank had presented the stolen cheque made out to pay cash
for #16,410 but the signature was not Mr Cunningham's and the cheque was
not even completed properly.
Kond was a stranger and spoke with a heavy Russian accent. ''One would
have thought that such a bizarre circumstance would have set every alarm
bell ringing in the bank's system. Instead the teller began to complete
the cheque in her own hand, before having second thoughts and speaking
to a controller,'' the sheriff said.
''It was then found there were insufficient funds in the account to
meet the cheque, by some #15,500. In such circumstances one would have
thought the bank staff might have contacted Mr Cunningham at once,
retained the cheque or attempted to detain the man until the police
arrive.'' But he added: ''Instead the cheque was blandly handed back to
the defender.''
The sheriff said that later the same afternoon, the identical cheque
appeared in the same bank brought by a director of a local garage, an
established customer.
Suspicion was still not aroused, and this time it was discovered there
was enough in all of Mr Cunningham's acounts to meet the cheque. After
the bank transactions, the garage supplied Kond with a new Rover and
gave him #3668 in cash.
He says the bank's transactions were ''botched ones. Likewise in my
opinion this action is ill founded. They have chosen to peril their
claim thus far, upon a plea of recompense, which in my opinion is an
inept one.''
Kond's appeal to the High Court against the conviction where he was
admonished but recommended for deportation, has been refused.
The Bank of Scotland is considering an appeal.

AUTHOR Salmon Rushdie yesterday urged the British Government and other
Western countries to take action against the ''terrorist state'' of
Iran.
In a speech to the human rights body, the Council of Europe, Mr
Rushdie said the Iranian state was ''classically able to be pressured''
but condemned Western leaders for failing to act against it.
The author of The Satanic Verses, on whom Iran passed a fatwa or death
sentence six years ago over the book, said Britain appeared to have no
plan to exert any pressure on Iran for the sentence to be lifted.
He did not wish to be considered a victim, but the fatwa constituted
an attack on basic human rights, Mr Rushdie told a council debate on
freedom of thought and expression.
Mr Rushdie, accompanied as always by a Special Branch detective,
attacked Western leaders for their failure to exert pressure on Iran. He
included the Government which had protected him with ''great skill''.
''The world makes deploring noises but business proceeds as normal,''
he said. ''This, after all, is a state whose involvement in terrorism is
better documented than any other state.
''We have to confront the Government of Iran and make it understand
there will be consequences if it does not change its view.
''But nothing happens. People do not place human rights as high on the
agenda as they say they do.''
Mr Rushdie added: ''The Iranian Government is weak and is classically
able to be pressured. It is dependent on Western technology and finance
to rebuild its war-shattered state, and is increasingly unpopular at
home.
''If we value human rights like we say we do, we should work to bring
Iran back towards a more civilised posture.''
Mr Rushdie told reporters after the debate there were some segments of
the political system, particularly on the Conservative Right, who wished
that he would ''shut up''.
He said at a previous meeting with former Foreign Office Minister
Douglas Hogg, the view expressed had been that until there was a change
of regime in Iran there would be little chance of settling the dispute.
Mr Rushdie said: ''I do not share that view.''
He added that his increased public profile did not mean the problem
had gone away.
''The issue remains that another state is trying to kill a British
citizen. It is an act of state terrorism.''

<HEADLINE>Missing lawyer with #250,000 debts struck off</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979370242</RECORDNO>

A ''RECKLESS'' lawyer who has gone missing leaving behind personal
debts of #250,000 has been struck off by the Scottish Solicitors
Discipline Tribunal.
The tribunal ruled that Mr Iain Wallace, 31, who practised on his own
under the name of Sinclair Wallace, from Cathcart Road then St Vincent
Place, both Glasgow, was guilty of professional misconduct.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, the tribunal stated that Mr
Wallace's present address was not known to the Law Society of Scotland,
the solicitors' ruling body.
His last known home address was Queens Park Avenue, Glasgow, but he
had been evicted.
The tribunal said the Law Society of Scotland carried out an
inspection of Mr Wallace's business books in September and October 1993
and petitioned the Court of Session for a judicial factor to be
appointed after finding a number of serious irregularities.
As at October 5, 1993, there was a shortage of #18,416 on his client
account and in May 1994 the Law Society had to pay #45,838 out of its
guarantee fund.
This arose from a transaction carried out by Mr Wallace the previous
year in which he had received cash from a bank to remortgage a client's
home but failed to pay off the existing mortgage to the building
society.
He also used for his own purposes #20,000 which he had received as a
loan for clients.
The tribunal was informed by the judicial factor that Mr Wallace could
not now be traced and the deficiency on his estates was in excess of
#250,000.
It also noted that there had been a previous finding of professional
misconduct in July 1993.
The tribunal added: ''Having regard to the further catalogue of
failures it is apparent that Mr Wallace, having got himself into
financial difficulties, acted in a cavalier and reckless manner with no
regard to the safekeeping of clients' money entrusted to him.
''It is clear that he is not fit to remain a solicitor.''
In a second case, another Glasgow lawyer, Mr Thomas Millar, 36, of
Larchfield Road, Bearsden, was suspended for five years after the
tribunal found him guilty of professional misconduct.
Mr Millar practised under his own account under the name of Millar
Maclean and Co., at Clarendon Place, St George's Cross, Glasgow.
He admitted he had practised from November 1, 1992, until February 5,
1993, without renewing his practising certificate, professional
indemnity insurance and without contributing to the guarantee fund.
On a number of occasions he had failed to look after the interests of
his clients by not recording standard securities for lengthy periods.
In another case he failed to proceed with a case for a client after
legal aid had been granted to the other side.
The discipline tribunal found him guilty of professional misconduct
over his conveyancing failures, failure to attend to court proceedings
and carrying on business without a practising certificate or indemnity
cover.
The tribunal noted that Mr Millar had admitted a previous finding of
professional misconduct in December 1993 and that he had been restricted
to acting as a qualified assistant for at least five years.
That decision took effect from February 1993. He had not practised
since that date and it was explained to the tribunal that his estates
had been sequestrated. He was now working outside the legal profession.
There was no suggestion of dishonesty, but Mr Millar had caused
considerable distress to certain clients and put the affairs of other
clients seriously at risk.

Beijing, Wednesday
CHINESE scientists have obtained DNA from a fossilised dinosaur egg in
a remarkable parallel to the hit film Jurassic Park, in which dinosaurs
were brought back to life.
Professor Zhang Jun of Beijing University first discovered organic
substances that contain amino acids in a ''cotton-like'' part inside the
egg's cavity.
The scientists say this is the first gene material found in a
fossilised egg.
The egg, found in central Henan province, is believed to be 70 million
years old, from the later Cretaceous age in the Mesozoic era.
Researchers found DNA in the egg and succeeded in obtaining a variety
of gene fragments, it said.
In director Steven Spielberg's fictional thriller Jurassic Park,
dinosaurs were brought back to life by cloning a sample of DNA, the
substance from which all life is formed.
''Scientists at Beijing university could not disguise their surprise
at the great discovery,'' reported the Xinhua news agency.
Also in China, a team of Chinese and German scientists say they may
have found a clue to the disappearance of the Jurassic giants -- an
imbalanced diet, traced to the diseased shell of fossilised eggs.
The team have been studying fossilised dinosaur eggs dug up in
southern Guangdong province since 1983 and have found traces of disease
in the thickness of the shells, their texture, and trace elements.
After experiments the researchers were convinced the shells were
diseased as a result of an imbalance in trace elements contents in the
dinosaurs' diet, Xinhua said.--Reuter.

A MAN serving a life sentence for murder was jailed for a further two
years yesterday for fleeing during a home visit to his sick father.
William Ferris, 45 -- whose brother, Paul, was cleared three years ago
of murdering drugs dealer Arthur Thompson Jr, -- admitted escaping while
on an escorted visit from Perth Prison to the family home at Hogganfield
Street, Blackhill, Glasgow, on April 14, 1993.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that he climbed out of the bathroom
window. Mr John Service, prosecuting, said that Ferris, convicted of
murder in England in May, 1977, remained at liberty for two months. He
was finally caught in Blackpool, and later jailed for nine months for
drug offences committed while on the run.
Sheriff Kenneth Mitchell, jailing Ferris for two years, told him:
''What I don't understand is why you escaped at a time when you could
have been considered for parole.''
Mr Peter Forbes, defending, said Ferris had not planned the escape and
had simply taken the opportunity. Ferris's father had died five months
later. Ferris was now back to being a category C prisoner and his parole
could still be several years away.

A LABOUR MP said yesterday he was optimistic that the Government would
legislate in the next five years to stop advertising and promotion of
cigarettes for public health reasons.
Mr Kevin Barron, MP for Rother Valley, said in Edinburgh: ''The
evidence suggests this is inevitable.''
Addressing a seminar organised by ASH Scotland, he said the Government
was reluctant to act, but it would not meet targets for the health of
the nation unless it became more active in this area.
Last year, Mr Barron promoted a Private Member's Bill in Parliament to
ban tobacco advertising, but it was talked out at the report stage.
He said that much more needed to be done to stop smoking by young
people who had newly started. Anti-smoking campaigning mainly had been
about getting adults to stop.
About 150,000 children under 16 in the UK took up smoking in 1993,
more than enough to replace the 110,00 smokers who died of lung cancer.
It was estimated that about 21,500 children in the 11-15 range were
influenced to start smoking by cigarette advertising.
According to an answer given in Parliament, it was estimated that 842
million cigarettes a year were smoked by children in this group and #80m
was raised in excise duty. The Government allocated only #2.65m last
year on a teenage non-smoking programme, he said.
The seminar was aimed at helping different organisations interested in
tobacco and health issues to form alliances and work together for
effective action.

SCOTTISH MP Bill Walker (Tayside North) is one of nine Conservative
MPs who so far have signed an Ulster Unionists' Commons Motion calling
on the Government not to open ministerial talks with Sinn Fein until
''huge progress'' has been made in decommissioning arms.
The motion quotes the words used earlier by the Prime Minister as an
apparent condition for opening ministerial talks.
Since then, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew has
indicated that talks could go ahead if there was evidence that they
would ''accelerate'' the decommissioning process.
The motion, sponsored by Mr Ken Maginnis (Fermanagh and South Tyrone
-- UU) notes Sir Patrick's assertion earlier this month that Sinn Fein
was inextricably linked with the IRA.
It also notes ''that the IRA retains its terrorist capability in full,
continues to identify potential targets, continues to raise funds to
maintain its operations, continues to recruit and train and continues to
terrorise the community with brutal punishmemt beatings.''
The signatories say that while these conditions prevail ''any contact
between Government Ministers and Sinn Fein would be incompatible with
both the Prime Minister's stated position and accepted democratic
protocols.''
Apart from Mr Walker, the signatores are Mr David Wilshire, Mr Bill
Cash, Lady Olga Maitland, Mrs Teresa Gorman, Mr Stephen Day, Mrs Ann
Winterton, Mr Nicholas Winterton and Mr Barry Porter.

ALTERNATIVE medicine is no longer people with sore backs hobbling
along to the nearest osteopath, or a whiff of aromatherapy at the
hairdresser's. Not since the days when every community had its own
herbalist have there been so many practising therapists in Scotland. A
recent survey of homeworkers in Lothian uncovered 500 people running
some sort of alternative-medicine business.
Stressed, aching, or disillusioned with a disintegrating health
service, we are turning not just to acupuncture and massage but to more
abstruse regimes. The latest craze is manual lymph drainage
(butterfly-light massage) but Japanese reiki (laying-on of hands) and
shen (unblocking the physical barriers around difficult emotions) all
have their aficionados.
It is not only the traditionally stressed middle classes who are
seeking out the massage table, the essential oils, and the counselling
sessions. For four years Easterhouse has had a Stress Management Centre
staffed by therapists with a qualification from the College of Holistic
Medicine which has been running courses in massage, and counselling, in
Glasgow for 11 years.
Next weekend the Scottish Alternative Health Exhibition offers 30
lectures and 100 stands where the cautious can satisfy their curiosity
without committing themselves to a course of treatment or a particular
therapist. Lecture subjects range from the unknown Watsu to
well-established Alexander Technique.
As publisher of the Scottish alternative-health magazine Connections,
Ronnie Robinson knows most of the people who have turned their interest
in alternative therapies into a business. He reckons there are between
200 and 300 people making a living from alternative medicine in
Scotland, but many more who treat friends and relations while holding
down a full-time job.
Most of them move gradually from one to the other, as he did. After
many years as a travelling salesman for a firm of office-furniture
suppliers, he gave up his job to teach Tai Chi and run a small desktop
publishing business. For the record, Tai Chi is a series of energising
movements in which the life-forces are carefully channelled which
originated as a martial art.
''What happens with Tai Chi and, I believe, with some of the other
therapies, is that people start from their own personal interest and
gradually want to learn more,'' Robinson said.
''One of my main concerns is that people think they can make a living
from these areas when only a very small proportion will be able to do
that.''
He is well aware of the difficulties the uninitiated feel on
encountering the bewildering variety of therapies and practitioners
available. ''I try to encourage people going to a therapist for the
first time to be suspicious. They should be asking questions.''
Robinson, who began Tai Chi in 1981 because he knew he needed some
exercise, now runs nine classes a week. Students range from elderly
people who want some gentle exercise to the young martial arts
enthusiasts.
Financial adviser, Gayle Hajducki, now the owner of the Edinburgh
Holistic Health Centre, found that most of her financial clients were
self-employed people with a variety of interesting careers -- and
included a number of therapists. Some of them began to refer people to
her for financial advice because their ailments were not going to
disappear until their money problems had been sorted out. In turn she
recognised some of her own clients had problems which would benefit from
therapy.
After her children had left home, she found she had a spare room in
her house and invited some therapists to work from the basement. ''Three
years later, they have taken over two-thirds of my house,'' she said.
Now her financial business takes second place to the health centre.
Andrea Batterman offers shen therapy -- described as ''hands-on energy
field intervention'' -- at the centre as well as working part-time as a
physiotherapist in the NHS. She finds that her expertise there
complements her shen work and leads to a greater understanding of her
patients.
Alternative health exhibitions in Edinburgh and Glasgow held recently
managed to attract 3000 visitors over a weekend. It indicates that
during the recession alternative therapies have become a growth area as
people who have become redundant see an opportunity for a second career.
''Usually it starts as a cottage industry. Most people come into it
later in life when they are looking for something which gives them
greater control over their own lives. To do something which is more
satisfying and less stressful they are willing to suffer the
disadvantages of self-employment such as no sickness benefit and no paid
holidays,'' said Ian Holland, one of the organisers of the exhibitions.
He has worked as a massage therapist for 16 years, at home for the
first seven and from a centre for alternative medicine for the next
seven. He also teaches evening classes in massage and says that he now
has a full-time business in which he is ''as busy as I want to be''.
The Scottish Alternative Health Exhibition takes place on March 25 and
26 at the Assembly Rooms, George Street, Edinburgh. Admission #3. Full
programme 0141-334 5846.

ELEVEN women photographers have put health under the microscope using
their camera lenses to create a remarkable and inspirational exhibition
in Edinburgh. Our Bodies Ourselves is so all-embracing it straddles
three venues -- with a map to guide visitors to the Out of the Blue art
space, Blackfriars Street, The Royal Infirmary, Lauriston Place, and the
KJP Gallery in Marchmont Road (all within easy reach of the city
centre).
Focusing on the pain of illness, the pleasures of good health, and
''fighting back'' breast cancer, eating disorders, ME, and pregnancy,
the aim is to increase understanding between men and women, doctors and
patients, the healthy and the sick.
Most poignant, perhaps, is the work of Jo Spence, who had established
a reputation as a radical contemporary photographer when she died of
breast cancer three years ago.
Clare Park and Nancy Honey are among exhibitors from Britain, Norway,
and New Zealand who use their cameras to translate personal,
life-changing experiences into powerful and sometimes disturbing images.
The exhibition comes to Scotland from Nottingham, where 50,000 visitors
were attracted by its pioneering approach to medicine and art.
Associated events this weekend include a complementary therapy session
and a health forum. Admission to these and the exhibition, which runs
until April 1, is free. For information phone 0131-556 5204.

* STARTER for 10 . . . what do a housewife (or househusband, come to
that) and a trapeze artist have in common? Answer: Both share hazardous
occupations. Even vacuuming emerges as potentially dangerous in a new
report, with osteopath Angela Mortimer warning heavy machines can twist
the pelvic joint. Her advice: avoid long sweeps and jerky actions and
don't try to do the whole house in one fell sweep.
Other tips in the report, for the current issue of House Beautiful:
use an adjustable ironing board at a comfortable height; get on to your
knees to load the washing machine; walk round the bed when changing
sheets, rather than leaning across. According to Dr Mortimer, housework
can be every bit as strenuous as heavy lifting in a factory. But there's
no shop steward to look after the interests of ''her indoors''.

EMPLOYMENT Minister Anne Widdecombe yesterday clashed with a
Tory-dominated committee of MPs on calls to improve the conditions of
Britain's working mothers.
Denouncing a unanimous report by the all-party Commons Employment
Select Committee as ''an expensive menu with no prices,'' she said it
could lead to reduced employment by effectively landing the creators of
wealth and, therefore, jobs with huge additional bills.
The committee said Britain's working mothers get a poor deal compared
with their European and especially their Scandinavian counterparts.
The committee recommends that the Government implements a series of
reforms to help Britain's growing number of mothers in employment as
women move closer to becoming 50% of the labour force.
These include:
* Improved maternity and paternity pay and leave.
* The review of the benefit system in order to remove the poverty trap
which, it says, discourages means-tested parents from seeking work.
* The introduction of a minimum of five days' family leave for all
employees' to help overcome family crises.
The committee -- which was exclusively male until Ms Angela Eagle,
Labour MP for Wallasey, was drafted on last April -- emphasised that
Britain was ''failing to secure the best from its workforce and not
giving the best to its children if it continues to delay the
introduction of a decent regime of maternity rights, childcare and other
provisions designed to benefit women with dependent children.''
The committee wants the Government to begin on its own doorstep by
introducing proper childcare arrangements at the House of Commons.
Other recommendations include extending maternity pay rights to women
earning below the National Insurance threshold, and making all mothers
entitled to at least 28 weeks' paid maternity leave.
TUC general secretary John Monks said the report deserved a warm
welcome, and he hoped that the Government would consider to its
wide-ranging and constructive proposals.

Singapore, Wednesday
THE Singapore Government announced that it will go ahead with the
execution of a Filipino maid convicted of a double murder, despite pleas
from the Philippines president.
Last-minute testimony by defence lawyers has failed to postpone the
execution and prove the innocence of Flor Contemplacion, 42.
A statement said there still was no evidence that Mrs Contemplacion
did not commit the May 1991 murders of another Filipino maid and a
five-year-old Singaporean boy.
President Ong Teng Cheong therefore replied to President Fidel Ramos
today that there was no basis to justify the stay of execution.
A Philippines Embassy statement said Ramos expressed his deep regret
and sadness at the decision. Mrs Contemplacion earlier said she
preferred to have ''an early end to everyone's suffering'', it said.
Murder carries mandatory death penalty in Singapore. Mrs Contemplacion
is scheduled to hang on Friday.
At the Philippines Embassy, her four grown-up children wailed and
screamed when they learned of the decision.
''There is no justice . . . because I see my mother being condemned to
die when she is innocent,'' said her son Sandrex.
0 The case underscores Singapore's strict legal system, which was
first highlighted when American teenager Michael Fay was flogged last
May for vandalism despite pleas for clemency by President Clinton.
The statement said it took Ramos's appeal seriously and studied the
testimony of another Filipina working next door, who overheard
conversations suggesting that the boy had drowned in the bath and that
his family killed the other maid in a fit of rage.
The Government investigated this claim and found it to be untrue, it
said.--Reuter.

HE MAY be an old fox, but he was far from stuck in his lair last
night. Sir Edward Heath, Prime Minister from 1970 to 1974 and now Father
of the House, was giving evidence to the Commons Select Committee on
Procedure, which is holding an inquiry into how Prime Minister's
Question Time is conducted.
If his evidence, together with that of another old soldier, Lord
Callaghan, is anything to go by, then the twice-weekly session of PMQs
will remain, but in a slightly different format.
Lady Thatcher, who sent the committee a written submission the other
day, also wants the adversarial nature of PMQs retained, and argued that
the present two sessions are ''televised and admired in many other
countries.''
The problem, according to both Lord Callaghan and Sir Edward, is that
they are nothing of the sort, and have become trivialised. Lord
Callaghan said on Tuesday that they were regarded by Amercans as a
comedy show and yesterday Sir Edward said that not only was it true to
say PMQs were regarded as a ''funfair'' in the US, but that was how the
public in this country regarded the sessions as well.
Sir Edward's solution, unsurprisingly, was to go back to the good old
days when, of course, it was all taken much more seriously.
What he wants, and what Lord Callaghan made clear he wants, is for the
Prime Minister to be asked specific questions about particular matters
of national or international importance, of which he should be given at
least 72 hours' notice.
That gives his civil servants time to dig about in the background and
come up with substantive answers instead of, as Lord Callaghan put it,
''the bludgeon replacing the rapier.'' Anything really urgent which
occurs overnight and has to be dealt with on the day can, in Sir
Edward's view, be dealt with either by a statement from the Prime
Minister or an emergency question answered on the floor of the House.
Sir Edward said that in his day the questions to the Prime Minister
were always about his contacts with other heads of state, international
problems or major questions at home.
The questions also were short, which allowed him to give an answer
which was equally short. Nowadays, the whole business was much more
theatrical. ''It should be a serious examination of the major problems
with which the Prime Minister is concerned, but it is nothing like that
today,'' he said.
The public did not regard it as a revelation of the proper purposes of
government; they regarded it as a ''shouting match.'' Also, it was not
good enough that MPs were handed planted questions by the whips when
Prime Minister's Question Time was meant to be dealing with the serious
issues of the day.
Mr Tony Banks (Newham North West -- Lab.) lowered the tone slightly
when he tried to express the nervousness felt by your average back
bencher asking a question of the Prime Minister of the day. It was, he
indelicately said, ''underpant-filling,'' and he wondered whether Sir
Edward had felt the same sensation.
''I never noticed that,'' Sir Edward said diplomatically. He
continued: ''You always feel a slight tension and unless you have it you
don't make a success of it. But it doesn't make you shudder as you pass
the Speaker's chair and go back.''
At the end of the day, nothing much is likely to happen to the way in
which Prime Ministers' Question Time is conducted, but there clearly is
some concern about the mechanics.
One MP pointed out yesterday that there is nothing like it anywhere
else in the world, but Sir Edward took the view that while the
experiment had started well it was not necessarily working now, and he
particularly highlighted how it was perceived in the US.
''When it first appeared people were impressed, but then as it
developed they said it was fun, all these people shouting at each other,
and they have less respect for it. And I think the same is true in
Europe as well.''
This is democracy in action.

As has been evidenced by these pages this week, women are well aware
of health issues. Now, it seems -- in the North-east at any rate -- men
are taking an interest too. Judy Mackie reports from Aberdeen
IN THE heart of Aberdeen's city centre, nestling between a camera shop
and a shoe shop halfway up Union Street, is a health store with a
difference.
There are no signs of dried beans, veggie meals and organic wines
within its startling yellow-and-black interior. Instead, the curious
customer will find rows and rows of leaflets, a bank of computer
terminals, and a team of friendly advisers offering assistance. There
are also no cash registers: the goods supplied by this health shop are
free to everyone.
The first of its kind in Scotland, Grampian's Health Promotions Shop
has brought health advice and information into the high street in an
attempt to capture the interest of passing shoppers and city-centre
employees with a range of leaflets covering more than 400 topics, a
computer database of useful contacts, and staff from a variety of health
backgrounds.
What its organisers had not anticipated is that since its launch last
December the shop has attracted far more than a passing glance from men.
''We expected most of our customers would be women, given their
perceived greater interest in health matters, but we've been delighted
to find that 30% of visitors on weekdays and 45% on Saturdays are men,''
says HP public relations officer Shaunagh Kirby.
Men of all ages, from schoolboys to pensioners, are asking for advice
and information on a range of topics, from prostate problems, testicular
self-examination and fertility, to stress management, drug and alcohol
abuse and healthy eating. Many are also interested in women's health and
family-related issues.
Shaunagh believes such a healthy interest reflects a new trend of
greater concern being shown by men over their own and their families'
wellbeing -- a fledgling challenge to the myth that men are ostriches
when it comes to understanding how their bodies function.
Customer Dave Parkinson, 38, agrees: ''Men are becoming more aware of
the importance of being healthy. Traditionally we have tended to ignore
our health until something goes very wrong and we need treatment, while
women are generally more interested in the preventative side and seem to
know what to watch out for.''
His reason for visiting the shop is concern over the result of a
recent cholesterol test, which is too high to ignore. He is surprised at
the wealth of health information available, and leaves armed with
leaflets on healthy eating, exercise and stress management, determined
to incorporate them into his busy lifestyle.
According to Shaunagh, Dave is typical of many of the shop's male
visitors, who have a problem and have been advised to do something about
it by their GPs. By far the greatest demand, she says, is for advice on
losing weight and stopping smoking, mainly from men threatened by the
twin spectres of high blood pressure and heart disease.
As a result, Health Promotions also runs a series of stress
management, smoke-busting and male and female-only slimming courses, for
which they charge an administration fee.
Hotel general manager Ewing Stewart, 37, who suffers from high blood
pressure, joined the ''Slimmin' Without Women'' course in January, after
a five-year struggle to shed three-and-a-half stones, on the advice of
his consultant. Five weeks into the eight-week course, he is pleased to
have lost just over eight pounds.
''My previous attempts at losing weight were disastrous. I need moral
support when I'm dieting, but I found I was the only man at the slimming
clubs I joined. I did lose three stones on a crash diet, but that made
me feel really ill and I ended up putting it all back on again,'' he
says.
However, on the new male-only course, which has attracted 25
participants, Ewing is finding both the support he needs and plenty of
advice on how healthy eating -- and not dieting -- will help reduce
excess weight.
''It's really an education process. The dieticians have taught us how
to swop fatty foods for lower-fat alternatives by reading food labels
and knowing more about what we're eating. We had a tasting which showed
us low-fat spreads, cheese, pate and cream substitutes are just as tasty
as the 'real thing'. I've now managed to convert my wife too!''
Spurred on by the early success of their shop, and encouraged by the
interest shown by other Scottish health boards in following their
example, Grampian Health Board's HP team promise plenty more goodies for
the health-conscious in the coming months. According to Shaunagh Kirby,
these will include an exercise class for couch potatoes. That, too,
should go down a treat with the male population.
TEN TIPS FOR TODAY
* Share your feelings -- talk over your problems with someone you
trust.
* 'Listen' to your body and be aware of any changes.
* Know what sensible drinking means (no more than 21 units a week for
men) and never drink and drive.
* Have your blood pressure checked regularly.
* Always use a condom every time you have sex.
* Examine your testicles every month -- ask a health professional for
advice on how to do this.
* Exercise regularly -- choose an activity you enjoy.
* Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables -- aim for five portions every
day.
* Learn to relax; find a technique which suits you.
* Cut down on fat, salt and sugar, and eat more fibre.

<RECORDNO>979370254</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TORY Party chairman Jeremy Hanley was at the centre of a political row
yesterday after branding Labour councils corrupt.
Labour described his attack as ''disgusting'' and ''disreputable.''
Mr Hanley, launching his party's local election campaign in England
and Wales, said he would be using the campaign to expose what he called
Labour's ''rotten boroughs''.
He told a news conference at Conservative Central Office:''There tends
to be corruption among Labour councils and even the Labour Party admits
it.
''Labour's record in local government is the story of socialism in
practice -- high taxes, profligate spending, incompetence, waste,
corruption, poor services and political posturing.''
That provoked a furious response from Shadow Environment Secretary
Frank Dobson, who was quick to draw attention to the Conservatives' own
record in Westminster where the Tory council was being investigated for
gerrymandering.
''Mr Hanley should immediately withdraw his disgusting slur on Labour
councils and Labour councillors. If he has any specific evidence he
should give it to the police immediately,'' he said.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said Mr Hanley's comments showed
that the Government was running scared. ''Tories get extremely nasty
when they get frightened,'' he said.
Labour-controlled Birmingham City Council was accused in the Commons
yesterday of misusing public money to gain political advantage.
Senior Tory Dame Jill Knight (Birmingham Edgbaston) levelled the
charge to angry Opposition protests.
Dame Jill claimed that money was being used in a what appeared to be a
''blatant attempt to buy votes''.
She urged Lord Nolan, whose committee currently is investigating
standards in public life, to look into her allegations.
Dame Jill was bitterly condemned by Labour's former deputy leader Roy
Hattersley (Birmingham Sparkbrook) who accused her of peddling largely
unsubstantiated ''smears''.
The Tory MP accused the council of wasting money on a women's unit and
an international women's festival which offered subsidised tea dances
and courses on lesbianism, Egyptian dancing and assertiveness training.
While money was going on this, Birmingham residents were being
deprived of badly needed services, she said.
Mr Hattersley raised separate allegations of ''grants for votes'' and
claims that Labour Party supporters had been able to jump the queue for
housing grants.
Labour recently suspended four local parties as it launched an
investigation into the claims that up to #2m of taxpayers' money was
being used to buy support in a row over parliamentary seats.
Mr Hattersley said: ''There is a crisis about housing improvement
grants in Birmingham. But it is a crisis that has been brought about
because there is so much decrepit property and so little Government
assistance in putting that property right.''
Former Tory Party chairman Sir Norman Fowler (Sutton Coldfield) said
Mr Hattersley had given a ''very unconvincing defence'' of events, at
times with ''indescribable pomposity''.
Sir Norman said that, by setting up its own inquiry, the Labour Party
''self-evidently'' believed there was a case to be answered.

<HEADLINE>Howard plans new sentencing approach</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979370255</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SINGLE sentence to replace the existing range of community service
and probation orders south of the Border was proposed yesterday by Home
Secretary Michael Howard in a move to address public concern that some
punishment was a soft option.
He also suggested scrapping the need for offenders' agreement to
non-custodial punishment.
The Government believed that earlier interpretation of the European
Convention on Human Rights which forbids ''forced or compulsory labour''
may have been ''over-cautious''.
The green paper published yesterday by the Government -- Strengthening
Punishment in the Community -- advocated a ''mix and match'' range of
powers available to courts.
Mr Howard wants to give magistrates, not the probation service, the
power to say what ingredients should be in a community sentence.
However, probation officers and penal reformers questioned the need
for further changes to the criminal justice system, saying it would do
little to address the effectiveness of such sentences.
Under the proposals someone convicted of criminal damage to a shop,
for example, could face a combination of hard manual work and be
prohibited from going near the shop for a period of time.
They might also be made to attend an alcohol education course or drug
rehabilitation centre as part of their sentence.

Strasbourg
THE European Union last night claimed victory in the halibut war with
Canada when a judge in St John's, Newfoundland, released the Spanish
freezer ship Estai on bail of #236,000. The money was put up by the
ship's owners.
While this did not qualify as the unconditional release demanded by
the EU, Mrs Emma Bonino, Commissioner for fisheries, hailed the move as
a ''victory for the firmness of the Commission's stand and the first
step showing the Canadians are trying to be reasonable''.
The Canadian action came after the EU noticeably softened its line on
punishing Canada for seizing the Estai in international waters. The EU
and Canada are expected now to scale down their threatened gunboat
confrontation and trade war by moving towards a resolution of the North
Atlantic halibut war at formal talks later this month in Brussels.
After insisting there could be no negotiations with the Canadians
after their act of ''piracy'' in arresting the Estai, Mrs Bonino told
reporters last night in the European Parliament: ''I hope a solution to
the whole story can be found.
''I am ready to begin informal discussions with the Canadians in
preparation for a multi-lateral meeting. I hope this is the first step
in reducing tensions and creating rational discussion of the whole
issue.''
Mrs Bonino said the Brussels talks, under the auspices of the North
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (Nafo), would include the difficult
subjects of implementing fishing laws and controlling quota catches.
She said the release had not involved any promises by the Spanish
vessel which would affect its right to fish in the zone where it was
arrested. ''That was not discussed,'' she said.
Mrs Bonino rejected suggestions that the Canadians' controversial
action had turned the issue into one of conservation and environment.
''That is quite different,'' she said. ''This controversy has raised
only the question of the rule of law on the high seas.''
Earlier, Mrs Bonino was noticeably reticent about the trade sanctions
promised by the Commission if the Canadians did not back down. She
merely produced figures suggesting Canada had more to lose than the EU
in a trade war.
In the background the Council of Ministers was reported to be pushing
hard for an end to the crisis.
The transatlantic damping down of tempers was accompanied by a
crumbling of EU solidarity after the revelation that the Estai was
carrying a catch of undersized fish and was said to have used a double
log book giving a false account of its haul.
The nets cut by the Estai when it was challenged by a Canadian patrol
boat have been found and are being taken back to St John's,
Newfoundland, where the vessel was taken after the Canadians seized it.
Canada wants the nets as evidence in its claim that the mesh used by the
Estai must have been illegal.
Poland and the EU requested the extraordinary meeting of Nafo,
invoking a condition which states that only two signatories to the
agreement are enough to command a full attendance of members. Officials
have pencilled in the talks for March 22-24.
''We will try to start all over again and to make new proposals -- and
we will try to win,'' a European Commission spokesman said.
Spanish diplomats were reported to have promised the EU's powerful
committee of permanent representatives that it would not meantime raise
the stakes in the dispute, in which the Canadians are held by other
fishing nations to have acted illegally and the Spanish are widely held
to be morally in the wrong for destroying fish stocks.
Until the news of the Estai's release, the EU's call for new talks
looked close to a climbdown. Mrs Bonino, urged on by Spanish fishing
interests, had taken a tough line, threatening economic sanctions and
refusing to budge until the Canadians released the Estai
unconditionally.
All the British political parties in a divided European Parliament
yesterday expressed support for the Spanish, but will today seek to
soften a tough resolution condemning Canada.
The debate produced some curious allies with the socialists in
agreement with the SNP and the Rev Ian Paisley expressing support for
the strident criticisms of Spain by an Irish Green MEP.
Dr Allan Macartney (SNP, North East Scotland) will vote against
sections of the Spanish-inspired resolution which calls for a complete
suspension of contacts with Canada. He will also seek, with cross-party
support, to insert a passage on preserving endangered fish species.
''The essential thing is to de-escalate this affair in which the
stakes have been raised by the despatch of a Spanish gunboat and threats
to make Canadians visiting Spain require visas -- a move which is
against EU law,'' he said.

FORMER Cabinet Minister David Mellor (above) is to be challenged to

Mr Mellor, 46, will face calls to step down because of high profile
extra-marital affairs.
His opponents also will cite poor attendance record at the Commons and
his extensive outside business interests.
They want Mr Mellor to stand down in time for the party to select
another candidate to fight the marginal south-west London seat at the

However, Mrs Alexis Elliott, chairwoman of the party, said: ''David

Istanbul, Wednesday
FRESH violence rocked Istanbul today, spilling over to its Asian
shores as angry Alawite Muslims buried their dead from three days of
violence on the city's European side.
Clashes between Alawites and riot police left four people dead today,
and soldiers stood guard as thousands thronged the funeral of
demonstrators killed in battles earlier this week.
More than 2000 members of the Alawite sect fought with security forces
in a protest against police handling of riots this week in Istanbul and
the capital Ankara.
Four protesters were killed and 25 people were injured in today's
clashes and gunfire was heard, Anatolia news agency reported. A curfew
was imposed in the extreme left-wing stronghold of Gazi.
About 5000 mourners attended the burial of six Alawites in the Gazi
district. Mourners shouted slogans against the government and called the
police ''murderers''.
The violence began on Sunday, when radical Islamic gunmen killed three
people and wounded 25 in Gazi, an Alawite neighbourhood.
On Monday, enraged Alawites demonstrated against the attack and police
opened fire. The death toll was in dispute, with the government saying
15 people died and protesters claiming double that figure.
Meanwhile, the government replaced police with soldiers in Gazi and
announced the dismissal of the local police chief.
A general met Alawite representatives in the street, and convinced
them to re-open roads they had barricaded since Monday.
Moderate Alawites, who are about one-third of Turkey's 60 million
people and support its secular system, remain at odds with Islamic
radical Sunni groups.--AP/Reuter.

LABOUR MP Calum MacDonald called yesterday for a comprehensive
register to be compiled of the owners of Scotland's wilderness areas.
In a Commons debate, he also suggested that a tax should be imposed to
discourage the ''speculative lottery'' under which people were able to
buy up large areas of land, seeking profit.
The debate took place against the recent controversy over the future
of Loch Lomond, and allowed MPs to voice their concerns over Scotland's
natural heritage.
Mr MacDonald, MP for the Western Isles, said that wilderness did not
have to mean emptiness, and that the future of such areas should not be
left to speculators.
He said a comprehensive land register would show who owned what land
and how much, and he added: ''We should be looking at taxing land values
as a means of taxing land speculation out of existence.''
He called for protection of some of the less remote areas, such as
Loch Lomond, and his comments prompted an attack on the Government's
plans for Loch Lomond by Labour Front Bench spokesman John McFall.
Mr McFall, MP for Dumbarton, accused Scottish Secretary Ian Lang of
abdicating his responsibility on the issue, and said the Friends of Loch
Lomond had described the Government's recent document as
''procrastination.''
He said there should be no further delay in taking action over Loch
Lomond and that it should be established as a national park. ''At the
moment it is nothing other than an unregulated pond,'' he said. ''Anyone
can come up, take a boat on the loch and go at any speed they want.''
Liberal Democrat Robert Maclennan (Caithness and Sutherland) backed Mr
Macdonald's suggestions as being worthy of further debate.
He said: ''Sadly, it is not the case that all is well at present in
the Highlands. What is clear is that there are significant conflicts
still. There is currently even an eviction case in my constituency.''
SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing said the memory of the
Highland clearances was ''seared into the psyche'' of Scottish people
and coloured their attitude in these matters.
''We want to see positive action taken to ensure our peoples can
remain in their glens and earn a decent living in the modern context,''
she said.
For the Government, Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro argued
that it was not the ownership of the land that mattered but how it was
managed.
He hailed the Government's recent announcement to hand more
responsibility for Loch Lomond to the local authorities in the area, and
said it now would be possible to implement ''no-go'' areas in the loch.
Sir Hector said #3m was being put into improvements for Loch Lomond
and the Trossachs. About #340,000 would be provided over three years for
assistance in setting up a water-based ranger service, #200,000 was
being made available for the provision of paths and tracks in the
Trossachs.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd moved
last night to try to rescue the Prime Minister from the embarrassing row
about ''fat cats'' of British industry taking huge pay and perks while
cutting the number of employees.
Mr Clarke and Mr Hurd -- on the left wing of the Tory Party --
combined to try to defuse the public row about the salaries, share
options and bonuses of the new chairmen of the privatised utilities.
They seek to separate their earnings from those of the heads of
companies who have to compete for business with the rest of the world.
The Chancellor told BBC Radio yesterday: ''One day, this country will
decide that good businessmen are entitled to be paid at least as much as
good footballers.
''I am in favour of good footballers being paid quite a lot. But a
good guy who runs his business successfully, and is as good at running a
business as a footballer is at scoring goals deserves to be paid a
lot.''
Meanwhile, the Foreign Secretary said in a speech at Birmingham: ''The
privatisation of the utilities has had its ups and downs in terms of
public perceptions -- but few people challenge its basic intellectual
thrust. We are regarded as the pioneers, and governments around the
world, left and right, have been beating a path to London to find out
how we did it.
''Everyone now wants to deal with British Steel and British Airways.
It was not so very long ago that they were disparaged and shunned.''
The view of the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary is reflected by
the majority of the 29 captains of industry who returned yesterday from
the Middle East with the Prime Minister after a big selling exercise for
British industry in Israel and Jordan.
On board the Prime Minister's chartered BA aircraft were the chairmen
of Marks and Spencer, Sir Richard Greenbury, who has been given the task
by the CBI of reviewing ''fat cats'' pay and perks.
Also on board was Mr Richard Giordiano, chairman of British Gas and
the highest- paid utilities chairman in the UK. He agreed with the other
heads of British industry on the Middle East tour that the controversy
over pay for the top men in British industry had got out of hand.
Sir Richard is expected to report to the CBI in June and the
indications he gave his fellow industrialists on the trip was that,
despite reports, he would be hard on those who do not have to compete
with Americans, Germans and Japanese.
The interventions by the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary
yesterday indicate that the Government is feeling for a consistent
political direction on this issue which they feel they are losing to the
Labour Party on emotive grounds.
The Tory Party is already involved in a plethora of committees in
trying to find a theme for the next General Election.
Mr Hurd said last night: ''There are two possible courses open to us.
we could take to the boats and row rather desperately towards the
horizon in search of a new ship, a new set of ideas. or we can stay on
the ship and repel boarders. It must be right to stand our ground. We do
not need to fortify ourselves with great new rafts of ideology.''
The two Cabinet Ministers signalled an attempt to rally round Mr Major
and repulse the demands of their Thatcherite colleagues.
Shadow Trade and Industry spokesman Brian Wilson said: ''I think most
gas consumers would happily give Mr Clarke a free transfer.
''He makes a silly and demeaning comparison. Labour is talking about
monopoly businesses which are dealing in the basic essentials of life
and have been privatised by the Tories as licences to print money.''
* Margaret Thatcher's favourite businessman Lord Sterling said
yesterday that he could do business with a Labour Government.
The P &amp; 0 chairman, long seen as one of the Tory Party's staunchest
supporters, confessed he would be happy to join a Labour Prime Minister
on a future overseas trade trip.

Rome, Wednesday
PRIME Minister Lamberto Dini called a parliamentary confidence vote
today to save his emergency budget, risking survival in a gamble that
could lead Italy to an early General Election if he loses.
Fears of a Dini defeat in tomorrow's ballot sent the lira spinning to
a new record low of 1220 to the Deutschmark after news that his
predecessor Silvio Berlusconi and his conservative Freedom Alliance
intended to vote 'No'.
That would leave the former central banker, Treasury Minister in the
Berlusconi government that fell in December, relying on Marxists for
support in the Chamber of Deputies, where he has no secure majority.
Dini opted for a confidence vote to try to stop his crucial
supplementary budget for this year from being wrecked by parliamentary
amendments.
He told the Chamber that the changes to the 20 trillion lire (#8000m)
package would, if adopted, add eight trillion lire (#3300m) to this
year's state deficit alone.
''I hope that in this vote each one of you will be ready to bear in
mind the interests of the Italian people,'' Dini said.
Victory would sweep aside the proposed changes to the mini-budget,
designed to keep the 1995 deficit from exceeding 138.6 trillion lire
(#54bn) and one of four pillars in the programme of Dini's stop-gap
technocrat government.
Defeat would oblige Dini to resign and could leave President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro with no choice but to dissolve the divided Parliament for
a General Election four years early.
Aware of the stakes, Dini broke into English to tell reporters: ''When
the going gets tough, the tough get going.''
Dini and his Cabinet of experts from outside party politics were
confirmed by the Chamber in January thanks only to abstentions by
Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance.
Media mogul Berlusconi has pressed for a swift return to the ballot
box since the government he built after winning last year's election was
toppled in a mutiny by his then partner, the Northern League.
When MPs of his coalition met today, Berlusconi and his chief ally,
hard-right leader Gianfranco Fini, had recommended a 'No' vote.
''The question isn't even under discussion. Freedom Alliance deputies
will vote against Dini,'' said a member of Fini's National Alliance.
The Communist Refoundation party could hold the key to Dini's victory
or defeat.
The party leadership has recommended a 'No' vote, but political
sources said about 15 of its 38 MPs wanted to back Dini or abstain
rather than back Berlusconi. This would facilitate a Dini
victory.--Reuter.

MEN popping vitamin pills? Well, there is growing evidence that they
are following the trend set by women as they become increasingly health
conscious. So an innovative new Scottish company, du Natra, has launched
a ''vitamin bubble'' for men.
This daily bubble contains two capsules of fish oil -- one of Vitamin
C, Vitamin E, Vitamin A, and another of multi-vitamin and mineral.
Paul Fisher, director of the Strathaven-based vitamin company, says
that a similar bubble is produced for women.
Experts from Glasgow Caledonian University and Glasgow University,
headed by Professor Mike Lean of the Department of Human Nutrition,
created the DailyVits package.
Women take most of the vitamins but men are catching on now, Fisher
said.
A week's supply costs #2.99. Available from the following outlets:
Glasgow: Sinclair Pharmacies, Great Western Road and Central Station;
Forrest &amp; Niven Healthfoods, St Vincent Street; Park Road Pharmacy,
Kelvinbridge.
Edinburgh: Stockbridge/Lloyds pharmacies; Lindsay &amp; Gilmore (selected

THREE leading football players in England, held overnight in cells
over allegations of match-rigging, were yesterday ordered to surrender
their passports before being released on bail.
They have been instructed to report back by Hampshire police at a
future date.
Bruce Grobbelaar, John Fashanu, and Hans Segers, have been told that
the investigation is likely to take up to two months.
Until then they have been told that they cannot leave the country
without permission.
A Malaysian businessman, Mr Heng Suan Lim, was also freed, under the
same conditions. Mr Fashanu's girlfriend, Ms Melissa Kassampsi, was
detained for further questioning before she too was eventually set free.
A 12-strong team of detectives investigating allegations of fraud
seized a number of documents when the five were arrested on Tuesday.
It will take some time before these can be processed in what is an
extremely complex investigation, a source said last night.
A Hampshire police superintendent had extended by 12 hours the 24-hour
detention period for some of those detained to enable further
questioning.
However, all of them were eventually released without charges being
laid.
Solicitors representing the players insisted they were innocent of all
the allegations.
Grobbelaar, the former Liverpool and current Southampton goalkeeper;
Segers, Wimbledon goalkeeper; and Fashanu, the Aston Villa and former
Wimbledon striker who co-hosts the Gladiators television programme, were
held in seperate police stations.
Mr Fashanu, through his solicitor, denied any involvement or knowledge
of the issues being investigated by Hampshire police.
''He has refuted and continues to refute in the strongest possible
terms that he has any knowledge of or has had anything to do with this
affair,'' said Mr Henri Brandman.
''He very much regrets the hysterical coverage of the matter so far as
he is concerned. He has not been charged with any offence. He is
completely innocent.''
Justin Fashanu, who played with Hearts and Airdrie, yesterday refused
to enter the controversy over his brother's arrest.
He declined to comment when approached by The Herald at his home in
Polkommet Road, Greenrigg, near Harthill, Lanarkshire. He would not say
if he had contacted his brother during the past few days.

A FISH-FARM worker died yesterday when he was struck by lightning.
Mr John McPhail, 25, of Lorne Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, was
feeding fish at the Lakeland Marine fish farm at Old Poltalloch,
Kilmartin, Argyll, when he was struck by lightning during a hailstorm
and fell into the water.
He did not regain consciousness and was pulled from the water by
colleagues. He was taken by ambulance to the Mid Argyll Hospital,
Lochgilphead, where he was pronounced dead at 3.20pm.
Mr McPhail's mother, Josie, is well known for her singing at the Mod
and has two daughters. It is understood that Mr McPhail had recently
bought a flat with his fiancee.
Lakeland Marine is a subsidiary of a Norwegian fish farm group which
took over the farm at Old Poltalloch about two-and-a-half years ago. The
farm, a shore-edge operation at the mouth of Loch Craignish in an
isolated part of mid-Argyll, has been in existence since 1982.

British contenders include the stars of The Madness of King George,
Nigel Hawthorne and Helen Mirren -- possibilities for the best actor and
actress awards.
The film's writer, Alan Bennett, has been nominated for the first time
for best adapted screenplay. The film is also up for best art direction.
Sir Tim Rice and pop star Elton John are among Britain's brightest
hopes for their music for Disney's hit The Lion King.
Paul Schofield's performance in Quiz Show has given him an Oscar
nomination, while Four Weddings and a Funeral has been named in the best
picture category. Writer Richard Curtis is also competing for best
original screenplay.
Other British contenders are Miranda Richardson and Rosemary Harris
for Tom and Viv.
Film 95 presenter Barry Norman will be reporting on the ceremony for
the BBC, which is also screening a highlights programme on BBC1 later

<HEADLINE>Private sector work of NHS doctors 'must be addressed' Warning to moonlighting consultants</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ALAN MACDERMID, MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979370266</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE sector moonlighting by hospital consultants to the detriment
of their NHS work was a problem that had to be addressed, a doctors'
leader admitted yesterday.
However Dr Peter Fisher, the chairman of the NHS Consultants'
Association, said that the problem was not as great as a report by the
Audit Commission suggested.
The commission claimed that one in three consultants missed more than
one-in-ten of their out-patient clinics or operations and were not
fulfilling basic requirements.
Junior doctors in some hospitals were having to perform operations
beyond their competence because there was no senior surgeon present to
supervise them, the report said, which covered the NHS in England and
Wales.
It acknowledged: ''This is undoubtedly due, in some cases, to factors
outside their control such as shortages of operating theatre and clinic
capacity. But for others, private practice means that they do less NHS
work than their colleagues.''
Dr Fisher said that, if juniors were working out of their depth, it
was more likely to be because insufficient consultants had been hired to
take account of the reduction of junior doctors' hours.
''Problems arising from private work are something we can't ignore,
but I think the figure of a third is an exaggeration,'' he said.
''Most consultants I know work pretty hard, but there is no doubt that
there is a group of cowboys who have to be called to account -- ideally
by the profession, or else by the managers -- because they are giving
the rest of us a bad name.
''Junior doctors have had their hours reduced, quite properly, but
they are having to do the same amount of work in a shorter number of
hours. It can only work if the consultant grade is expanded, as has been
promised but has never happened. I think juniors are getting more of the
emergency work to do than is proper.
''The private practice problem is, to a large extent, confined to the
big cities, and particularly London where there is a lot of work from
overseas.''
Scotland is widely acknowledged to be less seriously affected by
private work -- there is less of it, and a higher proportion of
consultants per head of population. ''We can keep a pretty tight grip on
things here,'' a Scottish Office spokesman said.
''Every consultant must have a job plan agreed with the local
managers; if they are whole time, they can't earn more than 10% of their
salary privately, and, if they opt for maximum part time, it is clearly
set out how man hours they have to serve.
''There are about 2000 consultants in Scotland and the numbers went up
by 2% last year. There are 120 vacancies which we have tried to fill but
there are difficulties in some areas, particularly anaesthetics and
psychiatry.''
The British Medical Association in Scotland pointed out there were
consultants all over the country working over their contract hours.
''Consultants here are very supportive of juniors,'' a spokesman said.
A Scottish representative of the NHS Consultants' Association, Dr
Matthew Dunnigan, of Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow, agreed that the
Scottish medical tradition did not involve a lot of private practice,
but he warned of trouble ahead if the English experience spread here.
''We all know people who are not doing their full whack, it depends
where you are,'' he said. ''As the NHS frays at the edges, which it is
doing fairly rapidly down South, and here to a lesser extent, the
problems will accentuate.
''The Audit Commission were implying they (the consultants) do not
turn up for clinics -- I don't think that happens here, but in London
you have got registrars running the clinics while the consultants are in
Harley Street.
''The problem with the juniors here is the sheer workload, though I
don't think they are being simply left adrift.''
However, Dr Dunnigan warned: ''Morale is lower, the problems are real,
they are increasing, but we are three years away from the English
experience. I think the market system is going to create a much larger
private sector.''
Mr James Johnson, the chairman of the British Medical Association's
Consultants' Committee, defended the consultants.
He said: ''The main reason for not attending out-patient clinics at
the moment is because the management has called some sort of management
meeting, which I must say have mushroomed, and doctors just have to go
to them.''
He questioned the commission's understanding of how consultants work.
''Misunderstandings include a failure to take account of consultants'
on-call commitments in calculating hours worked, misleading conclusions
on the work of individual consultants based on false comparisons between
them, and contradictory findings on private work.
''All these mistakes undermine other more welcome aspects of the
report and merely perpetuate unfortunate myths, such as the totally
unfounded allegations made recently about consultants neglecting their
NHS duties for private practice.''
Dr Andrew Carney, the chairman of the BMA's Junior Doctors' Committee,
added: ''This report provides further evidence that hospitals rely too
much on junior doctors to treat patients.''

TWO hillwalkers sparked an intriguing mystery yesterday after they
claimed to have sighted a black, five-foot puma or panther on Ben Venue,
near Aberfoyle.
Mr George McCann and his wife Mary, both 69, who have a timeshare
apartment at Kinlochard, were on their way down 2386ft Ben Venue when
they spotted the big cat just above the tree line.
Mr McCann, of Castle Douglas, said: ''It was just about 10.30am when
we were startled by the movement of what was either a black panther or
puma. It was five foot long with a tail to match. There is no
possibility that it was a stray black retriever.''
Mr McCann said the mysterious animal had been no more than 70 yards
away when it disappeared ''with one 10 or 12ft bound''.
Mr McCann reported the sighting to the local police. Constable Duncan
Brown, of Aberfoyle, said it was the first such incident in his area for
15 years. ''We are logging the incident and keeping an open mind. Mr
McCann is genuine, and I can't argue with him.''
Heavy snow prevented him from immediately investigating the sighting.
''However, I will go up Ben Venue when the weather clears,'' he said.
Constable Brown said there had been no reports of missing animals,
although one local farmer had reported a wild black goat with horns on
his land. ''But you wouldn't mistake that for a puma.''
Mr Richard O'Grady, director of Glasgow zoo, said that at the risk of
offending people who thought they had seen pumas or panthers, it had
been found time after time that their eyes had played tricks on them
when there was no scale to measure the animals against.
He said that what Mr McCann had probably seen was a Kellas cat -- a
cross between a domestic and Scottish wildcat.

THE dream has finally come true for Beatles fans. The three remaining
members of the group have secretly recorded new songs to be released at
the end of the year.
Paul McCartney broke the news in New York. George Harrison and Ringo
Starr have been working with McCartney on the material in a London
studio and will release the tracks to coincide with their TV
documentary, The Beatles Anthology.
McCartney said: ''George played some great guitar on this, we did some
beautiful harmonies, so much so that Ringo said 'it sounds like the
bloody Beatles'.
''Normally I don't show off about tracks beforehand but I have to say
in this case that they are really very cool songs. I think you're going
to like them.''
He added in a telephone interview with New York radio station WNEW:
''It's spooky to hear John singing lead but it's beautiful.''
Persuading the three remaining Beatles to work together was achieving
''the impossible, but one way or another we've pulled it off. . . It was
a joyful experience, it was magic.''
Last year the trio recorded an unfinished John Lennon song, Free As A
Bird, featuring the murdered Beatle's voice.
Until yesterday, this was believed to be the only new Beatles material
for the 10-hour documentary which brought them together for their first
major collaboration since disbanding in 1970.
The announcement was made at a New York news conference to launch a
drive for talent for McCartney's new Fame-style school in Liverpool.
He sent a message saying: ''I'm sorry I can't be there with you but
I've got the best possible excuse -- I'm working in the studio on a
couple of tracks from a sixties beat group you may have heard of, The
Beatles.
''These tracks will be released at the end of this year as a couple of
cherries on the cake of The Beatles Anthology.''
McCartney has spent the past five years fund-raising for the college,
the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts, to be housed in the
building where he and Harrison went to school. Even the Queen gave a
donation.

THE Spanish tenor Jose Carreras is to make his second appearance in
Scotland this summer when he gives an open-air concert at the Gleneagles
Hotel in June.
The concert, on Saturday June 17, will be given in the gardens of the
hotel. A specially designed arena will be constructed to hold an
audience of around 9000. Carreras is expected to be on stage for around
two hours, and will be accompanied by the BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra.
For the occasion the grounds of the Gleneagles Hotel will be
transformed into an opera village with hospitality marquees and picnic
areas, rather along the lines of the Glyndebourne model.
Carreras -- now associated world-wide with the Three Tenors act (he's
the wee tense one) -- last appeared in Scotland in December 1991, when
he gave a sell-out performance at the SECC in Glasgow.
Though in a statement issued yesterday through the singer's agent, he
seems to have forgotten the fact. ''I am absolutely delighted to be
finally getting the chance to sing in Scotland,'' he said.
In the years since the 1990 World Cup in Rome, when Carreras, Domingo,
and Pavarotti collectively first took the world by storm, the box office
currency of the Three Tenors has slipped a little, due to a combination
of diminishing interest and inflated prices. One scheduled Pavarotti
concert was cancelled when it failed to sell.
Perhaps that fact is reflected in the top ticket prices for this
summer's Carreras extravaganza, which will include choreographed
fireworks. In Glasgow in 1991, top prices for his SECC concert were #65
and #45. For the Gleneagles concert, parallel prices will be #55 and
#35, with the cheapest seat costing #25.
Carreras's agents, the International Management Group, remain
ebullient. They pointed to his sell-out concerts in recent years, held
in Bath, York, and Cardiff Castle. ''We expect the demand to be just as
fierce in Scotland,'' said David Heartfield, the concert's producer.
The career of the Barcelona-born tenor underwent a revival in 1987
after a remarkable recovery from leukemia. Within 12 months of the
illness, he was back on stage in Barcelona giving a concert to 60,000
fans. His only concession to illness was to cut his appearances from 100
per year to around 40.
Tickets for the Gleneagles Hotel concert will go on sale on March 25.

ANY innocent person could have been killed by Mr Andrew Wylie on the
day he stabbed a doctor to death, a court heard yesterday. Just a wrong
look as they passed him in the street could have turned them into a
victim.
Psychiatrist Dr Isobel Campbell, 40, told the High Court in Glasgow
she had interviewed Wylie not long after he had killed Dr Donald MacKay
in his Airdrie surgery on October 19 last year.
Mr Wylie, she claimed, told her just before the alleged murder he
decided he had nothing to live for. He said that earlier in the day he
had attended a court case and felt uneasy. There was a crowd outside and
he formed the impression they all hated him.
Mr Wylie told the doctor that as the day went on he felt increasingly
down and thought about all the things which had gone wrong in his life.
He went home, picked up a kitchen knife, and set out determined not to
take any more ''s...'' from anyone.
The court has heard in earlier evidence that Mr Wylie killed the
doctor in revenge for the death of his sister, Ann. He blamed the doctor
for failing to diagnose her cancer.
Dr Campbell said Mr Wylie, 33, claimed he had not set out to kill Dr
MacKay. He had not been brooding about revenge for his sister's death
and was not entirely clear as to what he was going to do when he left
the house. But Mr Wylie told her that when he passed the surgery he
thought about the doctor and formed the idea to kill him.
Dr Campbell told Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, that if anyone had
given him a funny look en route to the surgery he could have stuck the
knife in them. Mr Wylie, 33, denies murdering Dr Donald MacKay in Bank
House Medical Centre, East High Street, Airdrie, by repeatedly stabbing
him on the head and body. His defence counsel, Mr Gordon Jackson, QC,
has not contested the evidence that he stabbed the doctor to death.
The jury has been told the issue is his mental state at the time of
the killing and whether his responsibility was diminished by mental
illness.
Dr Campbell, who was in the witness box for three hours, said she had
concluded that Mr Wylie was suffering from paranoid psychosis. She
recommended he be remanded to the State Hospital at Carstairs for
further examination.
Dr Campbell told Mr Bonomy that Mr Wylie was not a paranoid
schizophrenic because he did not hear voices in his head telling him to
do things. When he saw people, however, he thought he heard them talk
about him in disparaging terms and he talked back to them and challenged
them.
Dr Campbell described Mr Wylie's condition as a low-grade mental
illness called alcoholic hallucinosis which could have been brought on
by his alcohol and drug abuse.
She said: ''In my view, his state of mind at the time was severely
disturbed by mental illness and, in my opinion as a psychiatrist, his
responsibility was diminished at the time.''
Dr Campbell admitted, however, that when she saw Mr Wylie in Carstairs
in January he exhibited no signs of mental illness. She said his
condition could have disappeared because his supply of alcohol and drugs
had ceased.
''In my view at the present time, his condition doesn't warrant being
treated in a mental hospital,'' she added. She agreed Mr Wylie was now
fit to live in the community but, when asked if she thought he was
dangerous, she replied: ''Yes.''
On the first day of the trial, the jury heard how Mr Wylie walked into
Dr MacKay's surgery and stabbed him. The doctor received multiple stab
wounds, three of which sliced his heart, lung, and bowel. There were
numerous wounds in his back and some on his head which damaged his
skull.
The trial continues.

A TORY councillor yesterday accused Labour of ''an act of revenge''
after work to outfit a new library was cancelled.
Councillor Norman Dunn said it was retaliation by Labour-controlled
Dumbarton District Council against Helensburgh which had chosen to join
the new Argyll and Bute authority.
Already, #365,000 has been spent on the the library, but it will now
remain empty until the new authority takes over and decides its plans
for the two-storey building.
Dumbarton District Council had originally planned to spend #395,000 on
furnishing and stocking the library, designed to replace the town's
existing facility, but has now decided to cancel that stage of the
project.
The council has allocated #10,000 to cover the costs of protecting the
empty building.
It has also come in for criticism for plans to spend #30,000 moving a
greenhouse from Helensburgh to Dumbarton.
Councillor Dunn, chairman of the local Conservative Association, said:
''This really is an act of revenge by the Labour-controlled council on
the town for having decided to join Argyll and Bute.
''Helensburgh provides more than 40% of the council's income yet we
get nowhere near the level of service or investment other areas receive.
''I'm absolutely incensed by this council's actions, which really are
nothing more than asset-stripping.''
Mr Dunn's anger was shared by Helensburgh Community Council, which has
written to Mr Ian Lang, the Secretary of State for Scotland, calling for
an investigation into the district council's actions.
The community council secretary, Mr Kenneth Crawford, said yesterday
they were ''outraged'' at what they saw as the district council
''reneging'' on its commitment to the town.
The community representatives also called for ''fair dealing'' from
the district council until its abolition in 1996, when it will become
the Dumbarton and Clydebank authority.
However, the leader of Dumbarton's Labour administration, Provost
Patrick O'Neill, dismissed the claims as political manoeuvring.
He maintained that the cancellation of the library project was merely
one of a package of cuts the council had been forced to implement across
its area as a consequence of a 20% reduction in the Scottish Office's
allocation.
Mr O'Neill said: ''We had to cut #1.81m across the district and there
have had to be reductions in every single project.
''The library lost out when we were assessing which cuts to make
because it was an all-or-nothing scheme, not one in which we could cut
thousands of pounds.''
Mr O'Neill rejected the suggestion of a ''revenge pact'' and insisted
there was no question of a vendetta against Helensburgh.
''I have said repeatedly that I will happily go with anyone to
Edinburgh and stand before Ian Lang asking for our money back. And if
we're successful then I'll back any moves to complete the library,'' he
said.
He also suggested that leaving the building in its current state may
actually prove advantageous for the incoming Argyll and Bute authority,
as it could be used for offices instead of its initial purpose.
Mr O'Neill added that the town already has a public library which
would continue to be used.
He insisted that the decision to switch the greenhouse was taken on
purely economic grounds.
He also pointed out the district council had spent #20,000 this year
on a project to refurbish Helensburgh's open-air pool.

THE Aberdeen-based OILC and the Stavanger-based OFS offshore unions
have announced they are planning to join forces to create a single union
to represent oil workers in the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North
Sea.
Their aim is to ensure that British offshore workers' terms and
conditions are raised to the level of their Norwegian counterparts, who
are anxious to maintain their position at a time of major economies.
The move follows a weekend of talks in Aberdeen, and they are now to
set in motion a strategy for the merger.
They plan to establish common agreements with employers and to take
joint action if necessary to maintain and improve terms and conditions
of employment. As a first step, they have established a steering
committee which will make proposals on a joint constitution and consider
other steps necessary to fulfil their objective.
The steering committee will be drawing up a joint submission to the
European Commission on the working hours directive.
''Norwegian offshore workers enjoy vastly superior terms and
conditions -- high wages, fewer hours, and a far less demanding shift
system -- compared to their British counterparts, despite the fact that
conditions in both sectors are dictated by the same big oil companies,''
said OILC general secretary Ronnie McDonald.
''Both sectors are now subject to massive cost-cutting exercises, and
the Norwegians have no wish to see their standards being lowered to
those of the British sector. Their stance is, in fact, that British
standards must be raised to the Norwegian level.
''A common trans-North Sea union of 10,000-plus members is seen as a
potent weapon in achieving this aim.''
He said the Norwegians also had concerns about the European dimension
because, although Norway is not in the EU, its workers are fully exposed
to employment and safety directives because the country is a signatory
to the European Economic Area Agreement.

AN INNOVATIVE travel package is being put together by the owners of
Prestwick Airport aimed at stimulating autumn tourism throughout
Scotland.
Mr Matthew Hudson, chairman of airport operators PIK, announced
yesterday that he is working with a variety of partners to provide a
combination of air and rail travel from London to any Scottish rail
station from #80 return.
Speaking at a transport conference in Falkirk, Mr Hudson called on the
Government to ''release the shackles'' on commercial operators in order
to stimulate tourism.
He declined to name the airline he is working with, although Prestwick
has a healthy working relationship with Dublin-based Ryanair, and
conceded that the package hinges on route licences being made available.
Mr Hudson said: ''The nub of the problem is that we are shackled by
Government regulations which are weighted towards the London airports
and the major airlines.
''What we need is for those shackles to be released and freedom given
for innovative ideas like this one to come to fruition. We must not
forget that 10 years ago Ireland, which has great similarities to
Scotland, was a distant second in terms of tourism and now it leads.
''In 1985 Ireland's only connection to the London gateway was provided
by the two Government carriers, British Airways and Aer Lingus, with a
shared monopoly and fares to match.
''Since a small private carrier began to serve the route at #99 return
the route has grown at a remarkable rate -- there are five carriers and
three million passengers.''
Mr Hudson also called on the Government to remove restrictions on
freight which mean that his freight customers can only offload cargo in
Scotland but not pick up for other European destinations.

A FORMER Gulf war hostage, taken prisoner when her plane landed in
Kuwait hours after the Iraqi invasion in August 1990, has launched an
appeal against a court decision to dismiss her damages action against
British Airways.
In her #100,000 action at the Court of Session, Mrs Judith Abnett, of
Tadley, Hampshire, says that her flight landed in Kuwait early on August
2, just after the invasion began.
She alleges that, on the day of the flight's departure from Heathrow
to Kuala Lumpur via the Middle East, British Airways advised 15 members
of the Kuwaiti royal family to cancel their seats on the aircraft.
She also says that 32 members of the SAS, bound for a covert operation
in Kuwait, boarded the plane two minutes before it took off and that
other passengers should have been given a chance to disembark.
She argues that British Airways had a duty not to fly knowingly into a
war zone.
BA denies that SAS men were on the flight and says it was advised by
British embassy staff at Kuwait, on August 1, that there was no imminent
risk of an Iraqi invasion.
Mrs Abnett was one of a number of passengers taken prisoner by the
Iraqis, and is claiming damages for nervous shock and mental distress
she says she suffered.
In December 1993 Lord Marnoch dismissed the case against BA and said
the situation was governed by the 1929 Warsaw Convention on
international carriage by air.
This stated that an airline was liable for damage sustained in the
event of death, wounding or bodily injury.
Mrs Abnett is claiming that Lord Marnoch was wrong in ruling that the
Warsaw Convention provided the exclusive legal solution to her claim.
The appeal is being heard by Lords Allanbridge, Mayfield and Clyde and
is expected to last four days.

A ROAD construction firm working on the conversion of the A74 Glasgow
to Carlisle road to motorway, was yesterday fined #15,000.
Barr Ltd, of Ayr, faced two pollution charges when the case was called
at Dumfries Sheriff Court.
The firm admitted permitting polluting matter to enter the River Annan
at Cleughbrae, near Johnstone Bridge, in April last year.
It also admitted a similar contravention of the Control of Pollution
Act at the Cleughbrae Burn in August.
The court was shown a container of brown silt taken last April and
depute procurator-fiscal Stuart Macfarlane said samples at the time
showed a reading of 141,165 milligrammes of solids per litre compared
with an EU directive recommending a maximum figure of 25 milligrammes
per litre on an annual basis.
He added that solids in excess of 185 milligrammes per litre were
likely to damage fish life and the long-term effects had yet to be seen.
The prosecutor stressed that when the solids settle they form a crust
over the natural sand and gravel on the river bed and this smothers
plant and fish life including fish eggs.
He said the readings in the offence in August weren't as high and
since then there was more co-operation between the firm and the Solway
River Purification Board.

<HEADLINE>Shake-up of dentists' pay after row over NHS treatment</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979370277</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SHAKE-UP in the way dentists are paid will be unveiled shortly by
the Government.
The move, announced by Health Minister Gerald Malone, comes after
claims that dentists are striking off hundreds of thousands of NHS
patients because it is no longer worth their while treating them.
Mr Malone attacked the allegations by Mr Alex Carlile MP, the Liberal
Democrat health spokesman, that 829,719 patients had de-registered
without choice.
''I totally reject Alex Carlile's suggestion that NHS dentistry is
under threat. The Government has a clear commitment to support NHS
dentistry and we will shortly be bringing forward a framework of
proposals for reform of the way dentists are paid,'' he said.
''Mr Carlile is looking for a crisis that simply does not exist. What
matters is the overall number of patients receiving NHS dental care.
''Alex Carlile claims that one patient is de-registered every two
minutes, but overlooks the fact that 45 patients join a dental list in
the same two minutes.
''Dental lists are constantly changing when, for example, people move
or dentists retire.
''Nearly 21,000,000 adults and over 6,000,000 children are currently
registered with an NHS dentist and there are over 15,800 dentists
practising in the NHS -- 500 more than two years ago.
''In Kent nearly 750,000 patients are registered with a dentist, in
Devon over 500,000 and Norfolk over 400,000. These figures hardly show a
lack of commitment to NHS dentistry.''
However, Mr Carlile told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a
''North-South divide''. He said: ''In Barnsley no patient has been
de-registered by their dentist.
''In Kent, top of the 'ditching dentists' league, 58,204 have been
ditched by their dentists.
''The dentists have only done this because of the Government's
attitude. They want to privatise NHS dentistry and they are succeeding
by stealth.''
Mr Carlile's claims were immediately attacked by the profession. Mr
Joe Eisenberg, who runs a dental practice in Blackheath, south-east
London, said that he treated children and pensioners on the NHS, but now
had to treat ordinary adults as private patients.
''It is simply not true that dentists are dumping their NHS patients.
I have to make #600-a-day before I can eat.
''And I nearly went bankrupt a few years ago because of the current
system,'' he said.
He used to treat NHS patients ''but in the end my bank manager said I
was #50,000 overdrawn and so something had to be done''.
Mr Eisenberg, who now runs the surgery with his son, Philip, said that
charging patients fees was the only way to stay in business.
He added: ''The fees I charge are not exorbitant Harley Street rates.
But there is no way I can exist on charging #3.75 for an extraction. I
would need to do about 20 to 30 an hour to pay my daily overheads and
that is impossible.''
Mr Mike Watson, a spokesman for the British Dental Association, said:
''It is an exaggeration to say you cannot get NHS dentistry. People can
and still do, but one recognises there is a problem.''
The Liberal Democrats said figures showed that more than 850 patients
a day had been de-registered in the past two years.
This was because of fee changes in 1992. Many dentists now refused to
take on new NHS patients as part of action against Government policy, Mr
Carlile claimed.
Last year the Government published a Green Paper, Improving NHD
Dentistry, but many of the proposals were rejected by the profession.

<HEADLINE>Safety campaigners claim Government is trying to fob off critics with lap restraints plan.  New bus seat belt rules 'insufficient'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ELIZABETH BUIE</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979370278</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BUS safety campaigners last night condemned the Government's new seat
belt regulations as insufficient and an attempt to ''fob off'' its
critics.
The proposals would require coaches and minibuses used for
transporting children under the age of 16 on organised trips to be
fitted with lap belts. Operators would be given 12 months after the
regulations are laid down to fit the belts.
The Government also wants an immediate end to the ''three for two''
concession on public service vehicles which allows three children under
the age of 14 to share a double seat.
However, the proposals do not cover double-decker or service buses,
often used for school transport.
Mrs Sherlie Gallant, chair of the Carnwath-Biggar Belt Up School Kids
(BUSK) campaign, described lap belts as no more than ''decorative
items'', which were not suitable for restraining children.
A person wearing a lap belt still went flying forward, she said, and
most school buses were not compartmentalised and therefore more
dangerous if a child was flung forward.
Mrs Gallant said Strathclyde Regional Council had already made
three-point belts obligatory on all minibuses used for transporting
schoolchildren. ''If a local authority can take its duty of care
seriously, then why can't our Government do it?
''To date there are 34 children dead. I do not want to see a number
35, and I certainly don't want it to be mine.''
She said that coach operators and the transport lobby would have to
put their hands in their pockets to find a way to fit three-point belts
in all coaches.
''A year ago, nobody thought minibuses would be fitted with
three-point belts. Now LDV have them and Ford will have them shortly.''
Mrs Gallant welcomed the announcement that the Government planned to
end the ''three for two'' concession.
Mrs Shona Cousins, whose 13-year-old son, Tony, was one of two boys
killed in the Biggar bus crash in February 1994, welcomed the
announcement.
She said: ''I can't believe it, but it looks like we have won. It is
certainly great news. All the BUSK people wanted three-point seat belts,
but I suppose lap belts are safer than nothing.''
Mrs Cousins is standing in the elections for the new unitary
authorites on a platform of bus safety for children.
Mrs Helen Mackenzie, Scottish co-ordinator for BUSK, called for
greater supervision of children, because without such supervision the
children would not wear the belts provided.
She added: ''We will continue to campaign for phasing out of all
double deckers on contract runs, because regulations do not apply to
double deckers on contract runs. We want road management schemes which
would prohibit HGV vehicles on narrow country roads for one hour in the
morning and one hour in the afternoon on school bus runs.''
The Labour MP for Clydesdale, Mr Jimmy Hood, described the Department
of Transport's statement as a ''fob-off job'' and an attempt to stop
Government politicians being given ''a roasting'' over delays in
introducing compulsory seat belts at a select committee sitting today.
Mr Hood criticised the Government for not acting sooner, even though
the Department of Transport said it was acting ahead of the European
Union.
He added: ''It is well known that school bus safety is a matter which
can be decided by individual member states. It should have been done
many months ago instead of all the delay.
''Nowhere in the Government's statement does it say it will make seat
belts compulsory on all school transport. I shall be grilling the
Minister about why this vital issue has not been settled, more than a
year after two teenage boys were killed in the bus crash at Biggar.''
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dr Brian Mawhinney, said:
''Minibuses and coaches already have a good safety record, but parents
are right to be concerned that we are doing everything possible to
protect their children when they are travelling in these vehicles.''
He added: ''Together with proposals expected shortly from the European
Commission, covering the future fitting of seatbelts in all new
minibuses and coaches, these measures should go a long way towards
improving the good safety record of these vehicles and allaying the
concerns of many people.''
Clamour for action on minibus and coach safety reached a crescendo in
November 1993 when a teacher and 12 children from Hagley School in the
West Midlands died when their minibus hit a stationary lorry on the M40,
near Warwick.
Eight days before that, a coach overturned on the M2, near Faversham,
Kent, killing nine American tourists and the driver.
In February, 1994, two teenage boys were killed at Biggar when their
school bus was involved in a collision with a lorry.
The Confederation of Passenger Transport UK said it welcomed any
action which further improved safety in transport. But its director
general, Ms Veronica Palmer, said the Government had to address the
question of driver qualification and vehicle testing in the voluntary
sector.
''Anyone, provided they are 21 and have a valid car licence, can drive
15 passengers from Land's End to John o' Groats in a vehicle they have
never driven before. What is worse, the law does not even require
special training and testing,'' said Ms Palmer.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: ''We are glad
the Government is going ahead with this, as it is something we have been
pressing for.''
But a RoSPA spokesman added: ''We want to see compulsory training for
minibus drivers. Seatbelts are an important issue, but 90% of accidents
are caused by human error or lack of ability to deal with a situation.''
RAC head of campaigns Edmund King said: ''We have been campaigning for
the compulsory fitting of seatbelts on new minibuses for a number of
years. It is an anomaly that our children must belt up in our cars but
can roam free in minibuses. We need urgent action to save lives.''
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher said that is was ''frankly
not acceptably'' that operators would have until March 1996 to fit
seatbelts -- nearly two-and-a-half years after the M40 crash.
He added that he was unhappy that the Government proposals had merely
said that lap seatbelts should be a minimum requirement in vehicles
carrying children.
''Lap belts are ineffective, because children can jack-knife over
them. They should introduce three-point lap and diagonal belts as used
in cars. If older vehicle floors are not strong enough to take these,
then the floors should be strengthened,'' said Mr Meacher.
A Department of Transport spokesman said three-point belts could be
fitted if operators wanted to do so.

LORD Mulley, who died yesterday at the age of 76, was the Labour
Defence Secretary who very publicly fell asleep while sitting alongside
the Queen at a flying display to celebrate her silver jubilee in 1977.
The fly-past of V-bombers, Phantoms, Lightnings and Harrier jump-jets
and Jaguars failed to wake the then Fred Mulley from his slumbers at RAF
Finningley, near Doncaster.
Later, Mr Mulley apologised to the Queen for ''a momentary lack of
attention''.
But the incident, which was pictured in newspapers throughout the
world, remains indelibly stamped on his career, more than anything else
he achieved during a lifetime of public service.
Frederick William Mulley, who was born on July 3, 1918, the son of a
Leamington Spa labourer, suffered from what one of his contemporaries
cruelly described as a ''charisma by-pass''.
One commentator wrote, when he entered the Cabinet in 1975 as
Education Secretary: ''It is hard to find distinctive achievements with
which to credit him. He is seen as a politician with no distinguishable
past and little discernible future.''
But he nevertheless had a distinguished record in the Labour Party. He
was a member of the ruling National Executive, on and off, from 1957 to
1980, and served as party chairman between 1974 and 1975.
Through much of that period, as a recognised Labour right-winger, he
was a constant and valuable ally both of Harold Wilson and James
Callaghan.
It was probably this reputation for loyalty which caused him to fall
victim to the left, under Labour's new candidate re-selection rules, in
1982.
He was ''deselected'' by his local Sheffield Park Labour Party after
representing the constituency at Westminster for 32 years.
He had been in conflict for years with the left over defence,
rejecting the increasing campaign within the party for unilateral
nuclear disarmament.
Two years later, Mr Mulley was rewarded with a life peerage.
As Education Secretary, he acquired the reputation of a ''hatchet
man'' during his 15 months there. He presided over a multi-million pound
cutback in spending and is remembered as one of the least successful
Education Ministers for years.
But he did abolish all direct-grant grammar schools and introduce the
Bill to compel all local authorities to go comprehensive.

THE driver of a fire engine was cleared at Glasgow Sheriff Court
yesterday of causing the deaths of two women in a crash.
Firefighter James Donald, 34, was racing to a house fire when he
collided with a taxi in which the women were passengers. A jury took
less than an hour to find him not guilty by a majority.
He was also found not guilty, unanimously, of an alternative charge of
driving carelessly at the junction of Glasgow Road and Ledgate,
Kirkintilloch, near Glasgow, on February 22 last year.
Mr Donald, of Thistle Street, Townhead, Kirkintilloch, said after the
verdict: ''It has been a nightmare. I'm just glad it is all over, but
express my deepest sympathy to the relatives of the women.''
The victims, Mrs Marie Farmer, 32, of Campsie Road, and her aunt, Mrs
Margaret Ferrie, of Derrywood Road, both Milton of Campsie, were
returning from a social function when the tragedy happened near
midnight.
With them in the Vauxhall Cavalier private cab was Mrs Agnes Younger,
58, of Mount Pleasant Crescent, Milton of Campsie, who was mother and
sister to the victims.
She was badly injured along with taxi driver Ms Lorraine Dean, 24, of
Ellisland Drive, Kirkintilloch.
Mrs Younger, who has no memory of the crash said after the hearing:
''I am very disappointed at the verdict.''
Mr Donald had denied driving dangerously and at excessive speed going
through red lights at the junction.
Mr Donald told Mr David Hunter, defending, that he was driving at
between 25 to 30mph when he entered the crossing with the lights at red.
All his lights were on fully, his blue beacon light was flashing, and
the klaxon horn was sounding.
He thought the way was clear, but a firefighter behind him suddenly
shouted: ''Watch, Jim,'' and the taxi came out of Ledgate to his right.
Mr Donald said he was braking at the time and thought the way was clear.

EDINBURGH district planning committee yesterday granted permission for
the renovation of Hibernian Football Club's stadium in Easter Road.
However, its management committee continued consideration of a request
from the club for a donation to help with the work.
The planning application for the erection of three new stands will
enable the club to conform with the requirements of the Taylor Report.
The first phase of the work, which begins next week, is for the
construction of new north and south stands at a cost of around #4m. The
second phase is for a new east stand.
When the work is completed, the ground capacity will be 17,880 all
seated. The committee was told that a letter had been received by the
Lord Provost from Hibs, requesting a donation from the council.
It said that supporters who donated #100 or more would have their
names recorded on a roll of honour in the new Hibs museum. So far, some
#116,000 has been raised. Businesses or organisations were being asked
for a minimum donation of #250.
The committee, which was told the Lord Provost had made a personal
donation, agreed a move by convener Frank Russell, who said there was
some #10,000 in the grants' budget, that applications be considered at a
special meeting in two weeks.

A MOTHER and a minister who led the prayers for her dying son are
standing against one another in the elections for the single-tier
councils.
Mrs Shona Cousins, whose son was fatally injured in a crash between a
school bus and a lorry in Biggar, is the Belt Up School Kids
organisation's candidate for the Carnwarth ward in the new South
Lanarkshire authority.
The Rev Bev Gauld, who spent hours at Tony Cousins's hospital bedside
following the crash in February last year, is standing for the SNP, the
favourites to win.
As Tony, 13, lay in a deep coma, Mr Gauld, the Carnwarth minister, and
Mrs Cousins said prayers for him. He died after five weeks.
Mrs Cousins, 31, who is campaigning for better safety on school buses,
said: ''The Rev Gauld was a tremendous comfort after the crash. He knows
I will always be grateful no matter what happens. This is one election
where there is a rivalry in the best possible sense.''
Mr Gauld, who took the service at Tony's funeral and that of the other
bus crash victim, Francis Scorgie, 15, said: ''Obviously, this is an
election with a difference. Shona has been through an awful lot and she
knows she will always have my best wishes. It was a very tragic time for
her and I did what any other minister would have done.''
Mr Gauld is also campaigning on school bus safety. He said: ''We have
the resources in Scotland to make roads safer. Here in Carnwath,
Scotland's gas is being piped to England by British Gas which makes #40
a second profit. Yet in Carnwath, there is no gas available to
villagers.''
The other candidate in the ward is Conservative Mr Michael Ashmore.

THE housing charity Shelter Scotland warned yesterday that housing was
in danger of falling off the political agenda in the run-up to the local
elections.
Depute director Kate Caskie said the new single-tier councils would
inherit the legal responsibility for homelessness. If that
responsibility were to be taken seriously, the new councillors must put
the whole issue at the top of their agenda from day one.
She warned that housing was ''in danger of becoming a Cinderella
service''.
Meanwhile, the national housing agency Scottish Homes announced it was
set to invest a further #5m in housing in the Borders over the next 12
months, with a further #3.5m expected to be attracted from the private
sector. The agency's plan will help to provide more than 180 new or
improved homes.

THE Scottish Liberal Democrats yesterday launched their Aberdeenshire
manifesto with an attack on Independents, who are contesting 31 of the
47 seats on the new authority.
Candidate and existing Banff and Buchan councillor, Mr Sam Coull,
said: ''You need a party with a game plan and one which knows where it
is going. We have thought things through, we have a plan and a way
forward.''
He added: ''Can you imagine what will happen if a lot of Independents
are elected? It is a recipe for chaos. Humpty is going to fall off the
wall and there are very few scenarios for him to be put back together
again.''
Councillor Rhona Kemp, former convener of Grampian region, continued
the attack by saying: ''When you vote for a bunch of Independents you
are voting for a pig in a poke. You do not know what you are getting.
Policy changes committee by committee.''
The Lib Dems, who concede that no single party is likely to have an
overall majority, may well have to go through a marriage of convenience
if they want power in the Aberdeenshire administration.
At the heart of their policy for Aberdeenshire is the decentralisation
of power, with decisions on the provision of local government services
and the future planning of the area taken as close as possible to the
individual communities.
Their plan is to limit the headquarters' function of the new council
to a central policy-making role, with an appropriately limited staffing
complement. They also intend siting the headquarters of the council
within the area of the new authority.
They plan to limit the number of services committees covering the
whole area of the council by amalgamating responsibility for related
services -- such as housing and social work, transportation and roads,
and economic development and planning -- in a single committee, in order
to reduce the amount of time councillors have to spend in meetings, to
allow them more time to service their own communities locally.
''This is a radically different approach to the running of local
government from anything in Scotland that has been seen before,'' said
prospective parliamentary candidate Mr Nicol Stephen.
''If any single party gets overall control, and frankly I feel that is
unlikely, it is very clear that in a large authority like Aberdeenshire
a large part of the area would not be happy with whichever party was
dominating the authority.''
Liberal Democrats also pledge to co-operate with neighbouring
authorities and local enterprise groups to promote strategic economic
development planning, and encourage inward investment.

A FOUR-YEAR-OLD row threatens to spoil Tory chances in the unitary
authority elections in Argyll and Bute, with claims that senior party
members have worked to undermine an official Conservative candidate.
Councillor Robert Currie, who is standing for election in Mid Kintyre,
says he has been sidelined by his Conservative colleagues since 1992,
when he remained loyal to the deselected parliamentary candidate, Mr
Bill Hodgson.
Mr Currie now claims that senior party members have conspired to back
an Independent candidate in his ward, in an effort to remove him from
the council.
It is a claim supported by Mr Hodgson, who says Mr Currie is being
persecuted for his loyalty. However, a senior constituency party member
said the allegations were ''rubbish''.
In December 1991 Conservative Central Office, in an unprecedented
move, disbanded the Argyll and Bute Conservative Association after a
four-month-long row over Mr Hodgson's parliamentary candidacy threatened
Tory chances in the 1992 General Election.
In January 1992 a new constituency association was formed, but more
than a third of the former members refused to join, claiming that local
democracy had been undermined by Central Office.
Mr Currie rejoined, but continued to give public support to Mr
Hodgson. Four months later he retained his seat on Argyll and Bute
District Council in the district elections.
However, within two weeks of the election the Conservative council
group voted against his nomination to chair the high-powered
environmental health committee. The same group also combined with
Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat and independent councillors to strip Mr
Currie of his honorary position as a Justice of the Peace.
Mr Currie said yesterday: ''I was pushed from all council offices.
Even the constituency chairman, Betty Waddell, president, Baldy
McCallum, and the organising secretary, Noel Faccenda, voted against me.
''They said it was because I wouldn't join the ruling group they had
formed with Labour and others, but it was also because I remained loyal
to Bill.
''Now I have been told that at least one councillor wants to get me
out altogether. Dirty work is going on behind my back to support Gordon
Black -- an Independent candidate -- against me.''
Mr Hodgson said party activists were using the same tactics that they
employed to ditch him in 1991. He claimed the plot against Mr Currie was
organised by Mr McCallum, a former chairman and president of the
constituency association.
''They are determined to rid themselves of anyone who showed me
loyalty,'' he added.
However, Mr McCallum said the claims were ''rubbish''. ''Gordon Black
telephoned me and asked me to help him fill in his nomination forms --
that's as far as it went.''
He added: ''We voted against Robert for the chair of environmental
health because that was the position taken by the ruling group. It was
nothing personal.''
Mr McCallum said he supported the decisions taken by the ruling group
on the council even if they were prejudiced against Conservative Party
members.
''We are not in it as a party,'' he added. However, he said he would
find it impossible to give active support to Mr Currie's candidacy as he
would be too busy fighting his own political battle in South Kintyre.
Last night a spokesman for Conservative Central Office said the
alleged activities against Mr Currie were a matter for the constituency
association.
Mr Black was unavailable for comment.

SCOTTISH Militant Labour yesterday launched its own whiter-than-white
brand of socialism which it will try to sell in the run-up to the April
6 elections.
Opening its campaign in Glasgow, SML national convener Tommy Sheridan
said that after the Scottish Labour conference's decision to tear up its
own principles Scottish Militant Labour was the only socialist party
left in Scotland.
Mr Sheridan said: ''Labour, Liberals and the SNP have become like soap
powder sellers all promoting the same brand of free market capitalism
wrapped in different packages.
''We will stand in 28 seats. We believe that the ideas of genuine
socialism will only be on offer in these seats.''
He said SML's first motion under a new Glasgow authority would be to
propose an amnesty for poll tax non-payers.
''Our other major theme will be opposition to the Great Rain Robbery.
We believe that more than words will be needed to save our water and
sewerage industry. We believe there must be no recognition of the Tory
water quangos. They must be boycotted and destroyed.''
Mr Sheridan said he would also be campaigning for more action on
housing.
Some 19 candidateswill stand in Glasgow, where they currently have
four councillors.
Mr Sheridan said he believed they had an excellent chance of becoming
the official opposition party.

THE Labour Party launched its bid to capture control of the new
single-tier Edinburgh City Council yesterday with key commitments on
nursery education and concessionery travel.
The present Labour leader of the regional council, Mr Keith Geddes,
claimed the citizens of Edinburgh faced a clear choice -- whether to
elect a council dedicated to providing first class public services or
one interested only in putting private greed before public need.
He said it was also a choice about whether to go into the next century
as a prosperous European capital city under Labour or to revert to being
a provincial backwater under the Tories.
Labour leaders are confident of taking control of the 58-seat council
by winning between 30 and 35 seats but yesterday they promised to fight
for every vote in all parts of the city.
Councillor Geddes, at a press conference in the city chambers, said
the region's plan to provide nursery education to all four-year-olds had
been fulfilled.
The committment was now being extended to three-year-olds.
Labour believed that the early access to nursery education provided an
excellent start to the education of our young people.
On concessionery travel, he said the break-up of Lothian region must
not be allowed to lead to the ending of the concessionery travel scheme
for the elderly and disabled.
''At an early stage in the life of the new shadow council we plan to
sit down with neighbouring councils and reach agreement on a scheme
which will not restrict travel between council areas'', he added.
Labour also promised to promote high quality public transport
services, to give priority to job creation, tackle homelessness and
expand play facilities for children.
Councillor Lesley Hinds, Labour leader of Edinburgh District Council,
said both the region and the district had been Labour-controlled at a
time when Edinburgh had delivered quality services and become a major
player on the international stage.
Under Labour, she claimed, the city had develped a new sense of
purpose and energy. It now had such internationally renowned facilities
as the Festival Theatre, the International Conference Centre and the
Gyle shopping development.
Councillor Hinds said a Labour administration would also give priority
to dealing with the problems caused by anti-social tenants.

THE bodies of two climbers were found on Lochnagar by rescue services
last night. They appeared to have fallen from the south-facing buttress
of the mountain.
Their discovery brings the total number of deaths on Scottish
mountains this year to 16, with six other climbers still missing
presumed dead.
Grampian Police said they had been unable to immediately identify the
men last night, as no climbers had been reported overdue in the area.
They were checking vehicles in nearby car parks for clues to their
identities.
''We can't tell at the moment how long they have been out there or who
they are,'' said a police spokesman. ''They have both been confirmed
dead and as soon as their identities are established next of kin will be
notified.''
The alarm was raised by a group of four climbers who discovered the
bodies roped together at the foot of Parallel Gully, one of the most
inaccessible parts of the mountain. They marked the position before
climbing out to alert rescue services.
A Sea King helicopter was scrambled from RAF Lossiemouth, and both the
Grampian Police and Braemar mountain rescue teams took part in the
operation to recover the bodies, which were airlifted to Braemar.
Weather conditions in the area were ''reasonable'' said the police.
''They were found by a group of four climbers who had no major weather
problems, and the helicopter was able to fly. So it appears to have been
OK,'' the spokesman added.
Among those still missing on the Scottish hills are a father, his
18-year-old son, and the son's friend, all from West Yorkshire. Mr Allan
Lang and his son Richard, from Dewsbury, and Mr Paul Bower, from
Wakefield, are feared to have died in an avalanche on Buachaille Etive
Mor three weeks ago.
Two men have been missing in the Cairngorm area for two weeks. Mr
Allan Mitchell, 22, of Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester, and Mr Graham
Holland, 22, of Rossendale, had been on a week-long climbing trip when
they disappeared in heavy blizzards.
Mr Mitchell, an experienced climber who worked in a mountaineering
shop in Keswick, had been pursuing an ambition to become an instructor
at the Glenmore Lodge Outdoor Pursuits Centre in the Cairngorms.
Another climber from the Manchester area fell through a snow cornice
in early February.
This year's tragic death toll includes Mr Roger Chippendale, who was
trapped on Lochnagar for 23 hours last month. Heroic attempts to reach
the injured man by mountain rescue teams and helicopter crews were
thwarted by 100mph winds, snow, and hill fog.
Mr Chippendale had fallen 200ft and become trapped on a ledge on the
north face of the 3700ft mountain.

A LEADING Scottish rugby player may raise a civil action over an
on-the-field injury after the failure, so far, of a police
investigation, instigated by him, to produce sufficient evidence to
justify a criminal prosecution.
The court move is being considered by North Berwick RFC player-coach
Ken Macaulay, formerly with Gala, who claims his head was stamped on by
a Duns opponent in a league clash at the East Lothian side's Recreation
Park.
''I know who did it,'' Mr Macaulay, 37, who played for the South of
Scotland, said yesterday. ''He burst a blood vessel and there was blood
everywhere, so I had to leave the pitch immediately.
''I needed 13 stitches in the wound and reported the incident to the
police.''
Mr Macaulay, who works for the Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh, said
that he had since been told by the police that ''nobody saw it'' and
that, without the necessary witnesses, a criminal prosecution could not
be initiated.
''I'm now investigating going through the civil courts. My son plays
mini-rugby and I am doing this to make the point that this sort of thing
has no place in the game,'' he said.
Mr Macaulay, who said he had no intention of naming the alleged
culprit at this stage, told of how he received his injury in the match,
on February 25: ''All I remember is that I was tackled and put the ball
back. The next thing, my head was stood on. We have to make sure this
sort of thing cannot be allowed.''
Following the incident, the North Berwick club wrote to Duns asking
the Berwickshire club what action it proposed. It sent a copy to the
Scottish Rugby Union.
The SRU's chief executive, Mr Bill Hogg, told The Herald that action
might be taken if the outcome at club level was inadequate.
''We have written to both clubs asking what action they are going to
take, and for their views, but so far we have had no reply,'' he said.
''If they are not taking any action, and once we know the full facts, we
might call for an inquiry if we deem that this has been serious
enough.''
However, Mr William Angus, secretary at Duns, said: ''We haven't had
anything from the SRU so far, and I didn't know about it being reported
to the police.''
''We knew of the chap getting injured, but how it happened I just
don't know. However, I am still making inquiries.''
A senior police spokesman said last night: ''In a very preliminary
inquiry which we carried out, several witnesses were interviewed, but
there was insufficient evidence to bring a charge. However, if further
evidence was brought to our attention that justified further inquiries,
we would follow that up.''
Mr Macaulay said that he was perfectly happy with the police response
to his complaint.

CRITICISM was last night mounting at the Government's treatment of
students who, in the face of the highest graduate unemployment for 12
years, are under major pressures, both academically and financially.
It came in the wake of the death of 20-year-old Inverness student Iain
Fraser who, faced with vital Edinburgh University exams, inhaled
chloroform in an attempt to control his sleeping pattern and help him
study longer.
One welfare officer within Scotland's student population said the
Government must ''carry the can'' for the rising stress and claimed its
attitude was ''a recipe for disaster''.
Another said it was ''outrageous'' students had to take part-time
work, often late into the night and hours before important lectures,
just to survive financially.
Mr Fraser, in his third year as a student in science and engineering
and approaching final examinations this summer, collapsed in his flat in
Edinburgh's Old Town apparently having misjudged a dosage of the
potentially lethal poison.
It is understood he began inhaling chloroform to knock himself out
when he returned from afternoon lectures so he could wake up later and
study through the night.
Figures released yesterday by Strathclyde University, showed eight
students a week are using the counselling services offered by its
Students' Association.
And between 75% and 80% of those who seek help display some sort of
stress.
Ms Michelle Sherlock, vice president (welfare), said her association
had students who talked about suicide and others who had been referred
for psychiatric assessment.
She said: ''There has to be a long hard look at the state students are
in. I think the Government carries the can.
Students, who no longer got benefits, were expected to study
nine-to-five, work part-time in the evenings, and seek out vacation
work, she said.
''They are trying to make ends meet,'' said Ms Sherlock, who said it
was not unknown for them to take Pro-Plus, a tablet with a high caffeine
content, ''to keep them going''.
Ms Lynn Wallace, vice president (welfare) of the Students' Association
at Edinburgh's Queen Margaret College, said Mr Fraser's death
illustrated the strain on students.
Mr Douglas Trainer, National Union of Students president in Scotland,
described the tragedy as a ''poignant'' example of the pressure
confronting the student population.

A COLLECTION of books from the Scottish library of the Marquess of
Bute, at Mount Stuart on the Isle of Bute, was sold at Christie's in
London yesterday for #1.8m, by order of the executors of the late sixth
Marquess.
Top price of #166,500 -- 15 times the estimate -- was paid by an
anonymous telephone bidder for a first edition of the New Testament in
the Basque language. It was dedicated in 1571 to the Protestant Queen of
Navarre, Jeanne d'Albret.
The first book printed in Irish, an ABC and catechism from 1517, was
sold for #47,700, double its estimate, to Trinity College Library,
Dublin, and the first edition of the Bible in Irish tripled estimates at
#29,900.
An American dealer paid #75,200 for the first newspaper printing of
the Declaration of Independence, and an early Spanish cookery book from
1556, Libro de Cocina, by Roberto de Nola, sold for #34,500.

THE family of a 91-year-old Dundee woman at the centre of a proxy
voting investigation is to have talks with the regional assessor over
alleged irregularities.
However, after an investigation, it emerged yesterday that there were
no plans for action by the returning officer
The situation arose when the woman, who lives in a sheltered housing
complex in Dundee, discovered that unknown to her, the person nominated
to cast her vote was a Labour Party activist.
She had changed her postal vote to proxy after being canvassed in the
run-up to next month's elections for the new unitary authorities.
Independent councillor Ian Borthwick intervened earlier this week,
stating that he was ''extremely concerned'' after being contacted by a
relative of the elderly woman.
Under the Representation of the People's Act, signing any application
when not authorised to do so carries a fine of up to #2000.
Yesterday, a spokesman for Tayside Regional Council said certain
matters were drawn to the attention of the electoral registration
officer, and that a comprehensive investigation had been carried out
into the proxy voting regulations.
He added: ''Following consultation with the director of law and
administration, no matters emerged which required the electoral
returning officer to take further action.''

EXCLUSIVE
THE Government has sunk a secret plan which would have helped create a
huge new community-led development on one of the most important city
sites in Scotland.
The Herald can reveal that Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser of
Carmyllie yesterday rejected a proposal which would have been the first
step on the way to turn part of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary site into
a ''village'' within the city.
The nineteenth century hospital is due to close in six years, and the
future of the site just off the Meadows has been the centre of
speculation.
A new hospital to replace it is to be built at a cost of around #180m
at Little France on the outskirts of Edinburgh.
There had been detailed discussions by hospital chiefs to dispose of
the historic hospital site, believed to be valued at #78m, to Edinburgh
District Council.
The plan hinged on the proposal being approved immediately by Health
Minister Lord Fraser.
An immediate decision was needed so the district council could take
advantage of local government finance rules due to be scrapped in
sixteen days, the last day of March, which allowed it a way of finding
the cash to pay for the hospital site.
However, Lord Fraser told Edinburgh Central MP Alistair Darling that
the site was ''a sensitive one'' and no decision should be taken on its
future without more consultation.
He did not rule out selling it to a single body like the district
council in the future, but said more time had to be taken.
Last night Mr Darling and Edinburgh District Council leader Lesley
Hinds accused Lord Fraser of putting the future of the area around the
hospital at risk.
Mr Darling said: ''Lord Fraser has effectively killed any hope of the
district council acquiring the site. The Government rules will prevent
the council from acquiring the site from the end of March.
''The decision taken by Lord Fraser today could have disastrous
consequences. There are very real fears that the site could be put in
the hands of a developer and that instead of low-cost housing we would
be faced with hotels and offices which would be a nightmare.
''I am also very concerned that the site may even be offered to a
developer in return for funding the new Royal Infirmary. Hotels and
offices on this site is a price that most people would find
unacceptable.''
Councillor Hinds said if they had been allowed to take over the site
they would have been pushing forward a community plan put together by a
local working group.
Councillor Hinds said: ''Everybody agreed this is the best thing for
the site.
''It would have turned it into a living, vibrant area. However, there
is no way we could have afforded #78m in ordinary circumstances and we
had to do it under the notional capital receipt scheme which is scrapped
at the end of the month.
''We are concerned that the site will be given over to a private
developer who will try and develop it piecemeal. The site is one of the
best and most important in Edinburgh and our concern is the nature of
the development put forward by any private developer may be tacky and
not in keeping with the feel of the area.''
The decision not to allow the district council to push ahead with its
plan immediately was given to Mr Darling at a half-hour meeting with
Lord Fraser in London.
Under its proposals, the council would keep the land in public
ownership and support a community-based redevelopment plan, titled New
Lauriston City Community.
It was put together by a team of local people made up of councillors,
health officials and architectural groups. They talked of a bustling
community with a busy market place, restaurants and attractive city
streets and squares.
The director of Edinvar Housing Association, Mr Robin Burley, who came
up with the idea, said the negotiations between the district council and
the hospital chiefs had been so secret he had no idea they were going
on.
Under the council proposals, there was a 25-year lease in which the
district council would lease back the hospital to the trust which runs
it at a cost of #700,000 a year until it closes down for good and moves
to Little France.
The Royal Infirmary NHS trust confirmed yesterday that discussions had
taken place on the subject.
Ms Carol Wood of the trust said that like all trust sites the land was
effectively owned by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and the final decision
on any such matter lay with him and the Scottish Office.

MRS Irene Adams, the MP for Paisley North, yesterday called on
Strathclyde Police to revive Operation Dove, the high-profile
stop-and-search campaign which successfully quelled knife crime in the
town in 1992.
Mrs Adams wants a similar police drive aimed at gun crime, in the wake
of a wave of shootings, believed to be related to drugs, which
culminated in the murder on Tuesday evening of a 31-year-old Linwood
man.
The senior officer in charge of policing in Paisley yesterday vowed
that the gun criminals responsible for the recent violence would be
relentlessly hunted down.
The call by Chief Superintendent Michael Currie came as he appealed
for public co-operation to catch the men responsible for the killing of
Mr Andrew McLaughlin, who was shot outside his home in Armour Place,
Linwood.
In a letter to Mr Leslie Sharp, Strathclyde's chief constable, Mrs
Adams expressed her grave concern at the shootings.
She is to meet with Mr Currie to discuss the violence and also wants
to meet with Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the Scottish Office Home Affairs
Minister.
She said yesterday: ''Most of these shocking incidents seem to be drug
related. It is very worrying that people imagine that it is only those
involved who are at risk. I am extremely concerned that with so many
guns on the street it is just a matter of time before innocent people
get caught in the crossfire.
''We need a special initiative to get these guns off the street. We
must also tackle the underlying problem, drugs,'' she said.
Police are following a number of clear inquiry lines in the murder
hunt, although no immediate motive had yesterday been established. A
local battle has been running for weeks, however, for control of the
supply of illegal drugs in Renfrewshire and this is believed to be
behind the upsurge of gun violence.
Mr McLaughlin's murder could be directly linked with two shootings in
Paisley on Sunday night.
Mr John Kennedy, 51, was beaten and shot in the ankle in a town centre
car park and Mr John Kelly, 30, was wounded in the head in a bar close
by only a short time later. Both men are still in hospital.
It is believed there were six other gun incidents in the area in the
48 hours before the murder of Mr McLaughlin.
Mr Currie said of the general pattern of shootings: ''Since January my
officers have been involved in high-profile operations in various areas
of this division, targeting people involved in this type of serious
crime.
''We are now seeing what appears to be a resurgence of the gun
culture. My message to them is simple -- you will be relentlessly hunted
down.''

A SEVEN-year-old boy was seriously injured when he tried to save his
sister yesterday.
Craig Falconer and five-year-old Kirsty were crossing a busy road in
Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, when they were hit by a car. The boy was
dragged beneath the wheels and his skull was fractured. Last night, he
was fighting for his life in the city's Western General Hospital.
Witnesses told of him pushing his sister away as the car crashed into
them.
Last night, Kirsty was expected to be allowed home after receiving
treatment for minor head injuries.
In Fife, one man died and another was seriously injured when a vehicle
crossed the central reservation of the Thornton by-pass between
Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes, and collided with one travelling in the
opposite direction.
Police named the dead man as Mr George Finlay, 52, of Beath View,
Dunfermline. The other driver, Mr David Arnold, 41, of Ardross Place,
Glenrothes, was taken to Dunfermline's Queen Margaret Hospital, but his
life is not thought to be in danger.

<HEADLINE>Home rule boost from England Poll backing for assemblies</HEADLINE>

A SURVEY has shown that a clear majority in England are in favour of
regional devolution, findings which were being hailed last night as a
boost for constitutional reform.
The evidence that the Prime Minister may have erred in putting the
defence of the status quo at the heart of his policies comes,
ironically, in Government-funded research by a joint team from the
Universities of Strathclyde and Glasgow.
They found that support for elected assemblies was overwhelming in
Scotland (72% to 22%) and Wales (58% to 37%), but that even in England
there was a clear majority in favour by 51% to 44%.
This would give an all-Britain majority of 54% to 41%.
Apart from contradicting confident Conservative assertions that there
is no demand for constitutional change in England, the findings indicate
the Labour Party may have been too hasty in appearing to back away from
its commitment to devolved regional assemblies in the South.
In the poll of 1241 adults, part of the Public Opinion and Local
Citizenship Survey funded by the Economic and Social Research Council,
only two English regions were against change, the South-east outside
London and East Anglia. Support for regional assemblies was strongest in
London itself and in the North.
Staff of the Shadow Home Secretary, Mr Jack Straw were last night
studying the research and its implication for Labour policy on regional
democracy.
The findings were immediately welcomed by Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson. ''This poll clearly shows considerable support for
devolution and decentralisation not just in Scotland but throughout the
UK,'' he said.
''It also shows that people have seen through all the Tory lies and
scare stories and that Labour is winning the constitutional argument.
''If John Major thinks that he is on to an election winner by
attacking devolution and defending the status quo he had better look at
these figures and think again.''
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, who has aligned himself with the Prime
Minister's strong defence of the status quo, was in Rome last night on
European business.
But sources close to him said he was dismissive of ''meaningless
questions'' which did not detail consequences such as costs, powers and
implications for other tiers of government.
However, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Jim Wallace,
said: ''It is clear from these findings that from Plymouth to Peterhead,
home rule all round has popular appeal.
''This is a breakthrough for federalism, which even Government
Ministers have been forced to accept as -- in Ian Lang's words --
intellectual integrity and balance. It also shows how emphatic support
is for home rule in Scotland and that therefore Scotland must come
first.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said the poll showed far greater pressure for
change in Scotland than elsewhere. ''We have always recognised arguments
for decentralisation in England,'' he said.
''It is clear that John Major's do-nothing attitude is as unwelcome
there as it is here. But the case for constitutional change in Scotland
has advanced -- we are a nation, not a region.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, said: ''The
sunshine and applie pie scenario always surfaces in this type of survey.
It is obvious that most people will answer 'yes' if asked whether or not
they want their own regional government.
''Once people start to scratch the surface and they realise that their
own parliament or assembly will mean more bureaucracy and higher taxes
they will be markedly less enthusiastic.''
He added that despite the findings of a ''vaguely-worded poll'' Labour
was still stuck on the hook of the West Lothian question and its recent
U-turn on English assemblies left the matter unresolved.
There was a delighted reaction on Tyneside from the Campaign for a
Northern Assembly, where Mr Brian Hall said: ''This confirms our belief
as a campaign that there is an increasing demand in various parts of
England for devolution and that the case needs to be presented in the
strongest fashion.''

EMPLOYEES of Highlands and Islands Airports yesterday rejected a pay
offer and are due to meet management next week.
The workforce voted by 139 to 27 (84% to 16%) not to accept an
enhanced pay offer of 4% plus a package to buy out time related premiums
which compensate 120 employees, such as firefighters and air traffic
controllers, who have night, weekend, and holiday working.
Mr Michael McCann, Scottish officer of the CPSA, one of the three
unions involved, said: ''The ball is now in the management's court and
we will listen very carefully to any new offer. We do not want to hold a
gun to anybody's head.''
Mr McCann, however, said the unions would be keeping their options
open and he could not rule out industrial action by the 190 staff in the
summer if it was not resolved.
The ownership of HIA passes from the Civil Aviation Authority to the
Scottish Office on April 1 where it will remain under the Treasury's
tight public spending guidelines. These demand that salaries are in line
with 1993/94 figures.

<HEADLINE>Scots victory as BBC outside broadcast unit tendering ends</HEADLINE>

BBC Scotland appears to have gained a significant victory over the
corporation's ''producer choice'' ethos with the announcement that the
controversial tendering process for its outside broadcasting unit --
which was widely expected to be won by an English outsider -- has been
halted.
Instead, BBC Scotland is to embark upon a much wider review of its
needs for the medium to long-term future, a move which is widely
regarded as positive for Scottish broadcasting.
The top management at Queen Margaret Drive is acutely sensitive to the
public's concern over director general John Birt's all-important market
forces strategy. This latest development calls into question the
effectiveness of his ethos in Scottish terms.
The news that the OB unit was under threat, coupled with last week's
announcement of job losses in the design and costume departments, was
strongly criticised by politicians and pressure groups.
However, BBC Scotland's Controller, Mr John McCormick, denied
yesterday that the decision to halt the tendering process had been made
in the light of the recent criticism. Nevertheless, he hoped the critics
would welcome the latest development.
He also reaffirmed BBC Scotland's commitment to maintaining a craft
base in Scotland. ''It is very, very important that broadcasting talent
stays in Scotland and we should be the key player in that. We are public
funded and we are the cornerstone of the industry, providing more
creative opportunity in television and radio than anyone else in
Scotland by far,'' he said.
Since the OB contract was put out to tender earlier this year,
''significant new factors'' had emerged which had convinced the BBC to
halt the process and institute a widescale review.
It will be conducted by Mr McCormick, Mr Colin Cameron, head of
television, and other senior figures at BBC Scotland, and is expected to
be complete by the summer.
Mr McCormick said: ''Since the tendering process was started, a number
of different factors have emerged and it was decided that a wider
strategic review should be conducted.''
This, he explained, was partly due to the developments in the latest
internal budget for 1995-1996 (details of which were announced last
week, including an extra #10m for network programmes from Scotland) and
partly due to the fact that the BBC nationally had embarked upon a
10-year review. To take a decision on the tender at this stage, he
explained, ''might not be in the best interests of the BBC''.
Mr Cameron said there was now a realisation throughout the BBC -- and
not just in Scotland -- that there was a need for a strategy review of
resources in Scotland.
This was partly due to a recent and ''particularly eloquent
intervention'' by the BBC's national governor for Scotland, the Rev
Norman Drummond.
''This does have an impact on the resource base in Scotland as a whole
and that is where the wider issues come in. You cannot look at the OB
unit in isolation,'' he added.
BBC insiders described the latest development as a points win for BBC
Scotland. For the first time, they said, a question mark hung over the
previously sacrosanct ''producers' choice''. Indeed, there were even
some suggestions that the decision (by BBC Scotland) to go ahead with
the tendering process was a deliberate ploy designed to show London that
the ethos, which might work for England, was seriously flawed in
Scottish terms.
This was strenuously denied by Mr McCormick who said that he had
received a great deal of help from his colleagues in London over the
decision to institute a strategy review.

THE Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is set to take the
Government to court over British Rail's decision, announced yesterday,
to end Motorail and some sleeper services to Scotland on May 28.
Cosla's lawyers have been asked to prepare a recommendation and will
report back within one week on whether the railway franchising director,
Mr Roger Salmon, has exceeded his powers in eliminating the services
without consultation.
Last night, it emerged that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang was not
notified of the announcement, despite BR's claim that the decision had
been taken in consultation with the Scottish Office.
Mr Lang was said to be furious at the move, which comes just weeks
after repeated assurances from Ministers and Prime Minister John Major
that the future of the services would be subject to formal consultation.
Mr Lang believes the subsidy required to keep services running until
the consultation period planned for later this spring would have been
minimal. He is disappointed that neither the Department of Transport nor
BR was prepared to pay it.
The developments were greeted with anger in the Highlands. Fort
William GP Dr Michael Foxley, who is also Highland regional councillor
for Mallaig, Ardnamurchan, and the Small Isles, said: ''It is quite
clear that we are going to have to intensify our campaign.
''Marching up and down Fort William High Street is not going to be
enough. We are now looking for substantial demonstrations of public
support and anger. This is not just about somebody getting on a sleeper
in London. It is about the whole future of the Highland rail network.
''Central government is treating the Highlands with contempt and a lot
of people here in Lochaber are going to lose out. There is obviously
going to have to be more and more direct action, peaceful of course.''
Mr Neil Clark, chairman of Lochaber District Council, said: ''It
doesn't really surprise me but it just shows how morally bankrupt this
Government is. They promised consultation but now it is not to be until
after the services have been withdrawn. You can't have proper
consultation about something that has already gone.''
The convener of Highland Regional Council, Councillor Duncan
McPherson, said he would be meeting ScotRail's new director, Mr John
Ellis, next week and would highlight the lunacy of maintaining but not
using the rolling stock in the height of the tourist season.
Yesterday, Opposition MPs accused the Government of reneging on its
promise to consult and warned that the loss of services which brought
tourists and their spending power to Scotland would effect the nation's
tourist industry.
The London to Fort William and the Plymouth to Glasgow and Edinburgh
sleeper, and Motorail, will cease to operate from May 28 because, BR
said, of the ''high cost of overnight trains''. BR claims the measure
will save #7m annually.
Scottish Tory back benchers last night called for an early meeting
with Mr Lang. The group's secretary, Ayr MP Phil Gallie, said: ''We feel
that this is premature. We did expect there to be consultation.''
Labour transport spokesman Mr Henry McLeish called for an all-party
campaign to reverse the decision, and for the resignation of Mr Salmon.
''We are bitterly angry at what is now the longest running farce in
BR.''
The matter was raised in the Commons by Liberal Democrat MP Charles
Kennedy. He said the announcement was made despite a promise from Mr
Major that he would meet concerned MPs to discuss the decision. ''That
promise has been made a mockery of by a grotesque breach of faith,'' Mr
Kennedy said.
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney, appearing before the Commons
Transport Select Committee yesterday, said the subsidy required to keep
the services running amounted to #360, excluding charges to Railtrack,
per passenger. ''The franchising director, uncomfortable as it may be
for some, has a responsibility given him by Parliament to make good use
of public resources,'' he said.
At present, sleeper services to Scotland are provided by five trains
from London and one from Plymouth. The London trains go to Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Inverness, and Fort William, while the Plymouth
trains services Glasgow and Edinburgh. Under the cuts, the five London
trains will be reduced to two, serving the same destinations except for
Fort William, and the Plymouth train is dropped.
Meanwhile, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which has been criticised
for failing to speak out in support of the threatened services, also
entered the fray last night.
HIE chief executive Mr Iain Robertson said: ''This is a premature
decision which pre-empts the planned public consultation, makes future
provision of the services a tougher proposition, and takes no account of
the rising groundswell of opinion in the Highlands and elsewhere in
support of retaining services.''

<HEADLINE>Guide tells court of mother's death. Driver of bus weeps as video reconstruction of route shown</HEADLINE>

A GIRL Guide told a court yesterday of how her mother died, one of
five victims, as a bus roof was ripped off by an overhead bridge.
Andrena Dougall, 19, said the driver ''went upstairs then came down
holding his head, saying 'Oh no, God no' . . .''
Her mother, Mrs Robina Dougall, 47, a Guide leader, had been upstairs
on the return trip from Wonderwest World at Ayr.
Gillian Keenan, 17, of Southdean Avenue, Drumchapel, Glasgow told how
the driver covered his head with both hands and said: ''I didn't know it
was a low bridge.''
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard how the Guides had been singing, then it
turned to screams. One of them was found lying dead on the road.
Mrs Dougall, of Boon Drive; Mrs Mary McGreskin, 39, of Drummore Road;
and three Guides, Catherine McKnight, 10, of Pitmilly Road; Margaret
Riddick, 11, of Bankglen Road; and Laura Cullen, 10, of Belsyde Avenue,
all Drumchapel, Glasgow, were killed.
The bus driver, Mr Campbell Devlin, 30, of Rannoch Street, Cathcart,
Glasgow, denies a charge of dangerous driving and causing the deaths of
the five and injuring 15 other Guides aged between 10 and 12, on
September 18 last year.
He denies failing to observe warning traffic signs for a low overhead
railway bridge. He further denies driving the bus while the recording
equipment was defective and the sender unit from the gear box was
missing.
Andrena told Glasgow Sheriff Court how she went upstairs where people
were lying in the aisle. She told prosecutor Miss Elizabeth Munro: ''It
was all quiet, then I heard a wee girl crying.''
Guide district commissioner, Mrs May McKinnie, 59, of Moraine Avenue,
Blairdardie, Glasgow, said the Guides were screaming and running off the
bus and how she tried desperately to resuscitate a young girl lying on
the road.
Mrs McKinnie administered first aid until ambulancemen arrived to take
over.
She said Mr Devlin was standing nearby in a state of shock and told
her: ''I am sorry . . . what can I say?''
Another Guide leader, Mrs Mima Dunlop, of Gorsewood, Bishopbriggs,
alleged that the driver was not sure of the way home from Ayr and how
she drove in front of him in Pollokshaws Road, in Glasgow's South Side.
She turned from Kilbirnie Street into West Street heading for the
Kingston Bridge, looked back and saw a bus stopped at an overhead
bridge.
Mrs Dunlop said she thought it was an open topped bus and then
realised it was the bus with the 29 Guides, aged between 10 and l2.
She thought: ''Oh my God, the bus'', turned and went back.
One girl was lying on the road beside the bus roof and other girls
were standing about.
After phoning for help Mrs Dunlop said she took the girls into a
garage repair yard, checked names and descriptions and then went to
hospital.
Mrs Dunlop said they left Ayr at 5pm, but the driver did not know the
way and he followed her.
Earlier, Mr Devlin sat weeping loudly in the dock as the jury was
shown a reconstruction on video of the route taken by the bus.
Policeman Leonard Warren, 28, said there was a warning sign before two
overhead rail bridges showing the height as 10ft 6in.
A police commentator on the video recording said at the first bridge
the bus used in the reconstruction stopped and then moved slowly under
the bridge.
The commentator said that at the second bridge the nearside of the bus
struck a girder which crumpled the roof, which struck and killed the
five victims sitting at the nearside.
Others on the top deck were injured.
Mr William Rutherglen, 32, a chartered surveyor of Battlefield
Gardens, Glasgow, said he was driving behind the bus and became
mesmerised by it as it approached the bridge.
He said: ''I wondered if it was going to hit the bridge, and then it
hit a second bridge which was lower and the roof came tearing off.''
The trial continues.

GLASGOW'S Citizens' Theatre was last night celebrating the receipt of
a #10,000 windfall, courtesy of playwright Harold Pinter.
Pinter was named yesterday as the winner of the David Cohen British
Literature Prize for 1995. The #30,000 award comes with an additional
#10,000 to be presented by the winner for the commissioning of new work.
Pinter requested that the money be given to the Gorbals theatre, whose
work he has admired for many years.
Citizens' artistic director Giles Havergal said last night: ''This
will give us an opportunity to seriously help young playwrights.''
The Citizens' Theatre's last staging of a Pinter play was in November
1992, a studio production of The Birthday Party.

THE Sinn Fein president addressed a fund-raising lunch in New York
yesterday. Earlier it was revealed loyalist representatives would be at
President Clinton's St Patrick's Day lunch which Mr Gerry Adams will
also attend.
Mr Adams told celebrities, including Bianca Jagger and real estate
developer Donald Trump at the 200-dollar-a-plate event in Manhattan,
that it was time for Mr Major to stop making excuses and start making
peace.
He said he wanted to unite Ireland as a country for loyalists,
republicans, Roman Catholics and Protestants.
He responded positively to the news that Mr Gary McMichael, the leader
of the Ulster Democratic Party, would also attend the St Patrick's Day
party.
''I think that's very good. We want to see an Ireland that is
inclusive and St Patrick's Day is not a nationalist holiday, it is an
inclusive Irish celebration and I welcome everyone into that
celebration.''
Mr McMichael, chairman Joe English, and vice-chairman John White leave
for Washington today.
Mr McMichael, whose father was killed by an IRA bomb attack in
December 1987, said they had agreed to accept the invitation after much
consultation.
The two main Northern Ireland Unionist parties and another loyalist
fringe group, the Progressive Unionist Party, have all refused.
But Mr McMichael said it was necessary for them to go. He said:
''Gerry Adams has been given credibility and legitimacy, and we are
going there to counter that.
''The Americans do not acknowledge the validity of loyalist opinion.
We will not influence that by staying at home.''
He said he was not interested in shaking the hand of the Sinn Fein
president, saying he did not trust him and thought his commitment to the
Northern Ireland peace process was less than clear.
Mr McMichael added: ''We understand the gravity of the decision we
have taken. We have consulted within our party and also with our wider
community, and we are satisfied we are making the right decision.''
The Clinton administration pressed Mr Adams to take a new step towards
peace by pushing the IRA to scrap its weapons.
Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke told the House
International Relations Committee in Washington that Mr Clinton had
taken a risk by inviting Mr Adams to the United States and it was now up
to Sinn Fein to show it was serious about ending violence.
''The ball is in their court now to show that they are serious about
removing the gun from the political arena in Northern Ireland,'' Mr
Holbrooke said.

EXCLUSIVE
THE Government is to be asked to approve a change in the law which
would enable a Scots court and jury to sit abroad for the purpose of
trying to the two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing.
Mr Allan Stewart, the Conservative MP for Eastwood, has tabled the
proposal as an additional clause to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill
which goes to a Commons committee next week.
Yesterday he said: ''This could break the log-jam whereby at the
moment Libya is refusing to hand over the two accused men for trial.
Mr Stewart suggested that The Hague, seat of the International Court
of Justice, would be a suitable site for the trial, although the clause
would allow the court to sit in any country whose prior agreement had
been obtained.
He said: ''I think it offers a way out of the impasse. The Scottish
law officers rightly take the view that the integrity of the Scottish
legal system must be upheld and therefore the idea of going to The Hague
for a trial before a panel of international judges is not a way forward.
''On the other hand, the Libyan Government are clearly concerned about
influences they see affecting the Libyan case and, I suspect, are
particularly worried about what would happen if the two accused were
freed by a Scottish court.
''Another complication is the lack of a mutual extradition treaty
between the UK and Libya.''
The coincidence that the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill is going
through Parliament offered a unique opportunity to amend the law to
allow a High Court sitting outside Scotland.
Mr Stewart said his new clause, which would not fall to be discussed
until near the end of the committee's deliberations, was in no way
intended to embarrass Ministers or the law officers. He had tabled it
early to enable them to give it due consideration.
The clause was drafted for him by Professor Robert Black, Professor of
Scots Law at Edinburgh University. Its result would be a normal Scottish
jury trial, with the jury selected in Scotland, but held outwith the
country. The accused would have the same right of appeal as all persons
convicted under solemn procedure in Scotland. If sentenced to jail they
would serve their sentence in any Scottish prison selected by the
Secretary of State for Scotland.
The additional cost of transporting the court to The Hague or some
other venue could not be the overriding consideration in a case of such
importance.
Although the clause was widely drafted, he would not expect Ministers
to agree for the court to sit, for example, in Libya itself. The choice
would be made by Ministers through an Order in Council.
Meanwhile, relatives of Lockerbie victims yesterday took their
campaign for a full inquiry into the fate of PanAm 103 to the European
Parliament and hinted that their campaign could yet end up before the
European Court of Human Rights, writes Murray Ritchie in Strasbourg.
Dr Jim Swire and others who lost family members at Lockerbie handed a
10,000-signature petition to Mr David Martin, who is a vice president of
the parliament and the most senior of Scotland's eight Euro-MPs.
The petition urges the European Parliament to request the European
Commission in Brussels to launch a full inquiry into the circumstances
leading to the loss of PanAm 103 and the deaths of all 259 passengers
and crew at Lockerbie more than six years ago. The dead included
citizens of seven European Union member states.
The petition will go before the EP's petitions committee, one of whose
members is Mr Alex Smith (South of Scotland) whose constituency includes
Lockerbie.
British Euro-MPs from all parties are backing the move to have a full
Europe-wide inquiry. Mr Neil Kinnock, in his new role as European
transport commissioner, is sympathetic to the families' campaign.
The EP has power to summon commissioners, according to Mrs Anne
McIntosh, the Tory transport spokesman, but there is doubt about whether
it could demand the presence of Ministers.

A TEN-year-old girl and her black and white collie will compete at
Crufts for Scotland tomorrow. Gemma Dear is believed to be one of the
youngest Crufts competitors and qualified for the
internationally-renowned dog show when she was only nine.
As she set off for the Birmingham show with her 22-month-old pet,
Ghillie, Gemma said: ''I am very excited and a wee bit nervous. I just
hope Ghillie will be OK on the train. He's never been on one before but
he's a good traveller.'' She added: ''I'm looking forward to a day off
school.''
Gemma, a pupil at Powrie Primary School, Dundee, will compete as a
member of the Scottish Regional Obedience Team. She trained Ghillie, her
first dog, with the help of Dundee trainer Elizabeth Campbell, who
praised Gemma's efforts. ''Gemma has done very well. It's quite an
achievement.''
