A #5.3m housing project in Dundee has preserved one of the city's
major historical landmarks from the jute era.
The Victorian, grade A-listed High Mill building, part of the world
famous Camperdown Works, has been converted by local developers
Cox-Johnston Developments into 74 flats. The building, renamed Braehead,
has attracted #2.6m GRO grant assistance from Scottish Homes.

A FORMER church which is a landmark listed building is what letting
agent John Boyle suggests could well be called a heavenly abode.
Officially, this exclusive development in Paisley is now St George's
Gate, and offers, unusually, two luxury flats to rent out of the 12
apartments. They are close to the town's many amenities and handy for
air, sea and road links.
The building has a central glass-roofed atrium to show off to your
visitors. The flats are fully furnished, and come with garden and
parking area.
Standard features include electronic door entry system fitted carpet
and curtains, telephone, modern kitchen with waste disposal and
washer-drier, fitted bathroom with electric shower, management of common
areas. Available for #450 a month.
''People should think about the South Side when they're looking for a
place to rent,' says John Boyle. ''It's really very good value. Granted,
this converted church is an exceptional opportunity but there are others
available as well.
''With a property management place in Battlefield Road, I have always
concentrated on the South Side. I was born and bred in the area, and
obviously know it well. I sometimes feel that West End properties can be
a bit over-priced.
''But there's no doubt in my mind that demand for well-presented
houses and flats in the West of Scotland generally will continue to be
strong right through to the next century.
''There is what you could call a widely perceived shortage of housing
units. And the rental market - even if you exclude any seasonal changes
- is definitely feeling the effects of a recovering economy. You could
translate that in broad terms as meaning property is a bit easier to let
now, so get in quick if you see something you really fancy.''
Looking around the Paisley area, then, what is available? Well, on the
south side, a two-bedroom modern flat with door entry system, electric
shower in the bathroom, and gas-fired central heating comes at, say,
#400 a month.
Into the centre of town, an attic flat - nicely done up, idea for a
single person - with one bedroom, door entry, washing machine and
electric shower is more like #295. In the west end, a choice of
three-bedroom flat at #375 and single bedroom at #320.
In nearby Houston, there is an example of the larger property, a
three-bedroom semi-detached villa. Gas-fired central heating, large
kitchen, utility room, shower in the bathroom, good gardens and a
garage. More for the family this one, with a bit of space to move
around. Try somewhere in the region of #575.
''We have properties in Shawlands and Queens Park,'' John Boyle adds.
''Typically, a single bedroom with usual amenities or a two-bedroom
property for choice, is around #375 or #340 a month. But I'd have to
admit, we just can't get enough of these good properties at the moment.
There is a very strong demand.
''Professional people want them. Those moving into the area for a
relatively short time want them. All kinds of people want them.

IS this the largest timber-frame building in Edinburgh since the
sixteenth century? Developer Mike Earrey is convinced that nothing quite
so large has been built in the capital by the timber-frame method since
the High Street was put up.
Craiglockhart Dell, a 21-flat project by his Roselink Developments in
Lanark Road, Edinburgh, has been designed to provide varied rooflines
and slate colours so that the building will chime in with the historic
Slateford House next door.
''Purchasers can expect dramatic savings in their heating bills
because of the high standard of thermal and acoustic insulation which is
among the main benefits of timber-frame construction,'' says Mike
Earrey. ''Each flat is going to be very economical to run, and people
are impressed by the high standard of construction, finishing materials,
and workmanship.''
The development overlooks the imposing Slateford aqueduct and viaduct
to the north and the wooded banks of the Water of Leith to the south.
The Water of Leith walkway, currently being extended, is a popular
recreation area in Edinburgh.
The 21 apartments are double-glazed and equipped with gas central
heating. There is a wide selection of different apartment layouts. Ten
of the flats -- including the two penthouses -- have been sold since
prices were released in December, 1994. Prices of the remaining flats,
all of which have two bedrooms, range from #62,500 to #67,500.
Mike Earrey says: ''There's no doubt that the Edinburgh market is
beginning to bubble along again. People who visit the site say they are
keen to buy but admit that they are nervous about selling their current
home -- but then they find that they are selling their home very
quickly. That has to be a good sign.''
He believes that one factor in holding back the market at the moment
is the number of overpriced properties that have been advertised
unsuccessfully for a year or two, giving the impression that the market
is dead, whereas these homes would find ready buyers if they were more
realistically priced.

TODAY'S douce residents of Crieff, and its generally genteel visitors,
are a far cry from the bandits, horse thieves and drunken drovers who
congregated in the wild frontier town at the hub of the old Highland
drove roads in the years up to the '45 uprising. In one of many violent
incidents, Rob Roy Macgregor's outlaw son was chased through the streets
by soldiers and killed.
In Victorian times Crieff, set on a hill facing south over the valley
of the River Earn on the fringe of the Highlands, became a popular spa
town, and Crieff Hydro is nowadays an institution among families who
return year after year, for healthy holidays.
The population of about 6000 people is boosted in the summer by
holiday-makers attracted by the Strathearn scenery, the wooded hill near
the Hydro called The Knock, and a dam called the Turret. Surrounding
Crieff there are visitor attractions such as Buchan Pottery,
Innerpeffray Library and the Glenturret distillery.
There is no rail station, but improved roads and the Dunblane by-pass
mean the town can be reached from Edinburgh and Glasgow in about an
hour. Commuters work in Perth, at Gloags, Bells and General Accident,
though the road to Perth can be nasty in the winter.
Tourism is the town's main employer, with 240 working at Crieff Hydro.
Managing director John Leckie tells me he hopes to employ another 10
full-time staff when the new wing with its extra 35 bedrooms opens in
September. Seventy of the staff live in, and the rest live locally.
The Hydro and its many facilites, including tennis, swimming, yoga,
riding and a golf centre, attracts 110,000 visitors a year. As a local,
you can use some of the facilities by joining the other 2000 members of
the Hydro's Lagoon Club.
Plans for a public swimming pool and sports centre in the town are
still at the talking stage.
Many of the shops in Crieff, as you might expect, set out their stalls
for the tourists, but there is a Gateway supermarket and the Penny Lane
mini-mall. Perth, a major shopping centre, is 17 miles away. The Athena
Greek restaurant is the place to dine out at the moment.
Education is well provided for, with state schools Crieff Primary, St
Dominic's and Crieff High School, and in the private sector Ardvreck
preparatory school and Morrisons Academy for day pupils and boarders. A
new cottage hospital is due to open in the autumn.
The delightful Macrosty Park on the Comrie Road has a bandstand,
tennis courts, playground, putting green, picnic spots and acres of
pleasant walks. Kate Beattie, a resident for eight years and property
manager at Drysdale Anderson, says: 'We are minutes from the countryside
and I go hill-walking to Aberfeldy on a Sunday. We could always sell
more country properties. Everyone is looking for an idyllic cottage, a
few acres, a stream and roses by the door.'
There are many traditional Victorian and Edwardian properties,
especially around the Hydro on the north side of town. There are some
older flats, and quite a lot of new-build.
Tay Homes has built on the eastern edge of town. On the western edge,
Bett is building four-bedroom family homes, and Thomas Mitchell is
building in the town, mainly bungalows.
Other streets have been developed on a small scale by local builders
such as Shaws, Dodds and George McOmish. New development was limited
until recently by the town's sewage capacity.
The property market in Crieff itself is moving slowly, but the onset
of fine weather traditionally boosts sales. The market tends to be
locally based, using local estate agents. About five years ago prices in
Crieff were almost on a par with city prices, but they have fallen
behind.
Nik Mayall, of Clark Thomson in Crieff, says: 'The market has been
quite good this year, but it has been difficult in the A90,000-plus
bracket for quite some time.
'However, static prices mean that Crieff is considerably cheaper than
Dunblane and Perth. Stone-built semis costing A85,000 to A90,000 in
Crieff would cost A120,000 in Perth, and the differential in stone-built
detached is even greater.'
Helen Tocher at General Accident Property in Perth says: 'We are often
asked for Crieff.  There's a snob value attached to the high sid

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns was yesterday convinced he had pulled off
one of his best 'signings' since he took on a managerial role when he
announced that 22-year-old central defender Brian O'Neil had agreed a
new three-year deal with the Parkhead club.
O'Neil, whose contract is up at the end of the season, was being
targeted by several clubs in England, but the youngster, who is arguably
the most-improved Celtic player over the last year, appears to be on the
verge of staying on.
There was, however, an air of mystery over the issue at Parkhead
yesterday after the manager had spoken. The player said: ''I know what
the manager has told you, but, if you don't mind, I have nothing to say
at the moment.''
Whether that was the youngster being careful not to be quoted until
the last 'i' had been dotted and 't' crossed, or if there has been a
hitch in the negotiations, will become clearer later this week. There
was a hitch in earlier negotiations.
But Burns said: ''As far as I'm concerned, we have agreed a deal and
I'm delighted. Brian has been a big, big part of things this season and
has got better and better.''
''The bigger the occasion the more he enjoys it, and I have no doubt
he is as good as anyone going about at the moment. I'm not prepared to
say what Brian is worth in terms of cash. All I will say is that I
wouldn't like to have the problem of trying to replace him.''
Another defender who is definitely staying with Celtic is Tony
Mowbray, who, along with Charlie Nicholas, is expected to sign a
one-year contract by the end of the week.
The only other senior player still to be fixed up is club captain Paul
McStay. Burns said: ''I don't envisage any problems and would hope to
have the situation sorted out by the end of the week.''
McStay is doubtful for tonight's match against Hearts at Hampden with
an ankle injury.
Left back Tosh McKinlay is very doubtful with a hamstring injury.
Definitely out is striker Pierre van Hooydonk, and he is likely to be
missing for a couple of weeks. Mowbray has been added to the squad.
Hearts -- Celtic are the only team they haven't lost to this season --
need the points for a different reason. Four successive league defeats
has seen them dragged back into the relegation issue, and a huge injury
list has added to their problems.
The latest casualty is John Millar. He is unlikely to face Celtic,
while Davie McPherson, John Robertson, Kevin Thomas and Steven Frail are
still missing. Jim Bett and Brian Hamilton will be given fitness tests.
Hibs, who are battling with Motherwell and Celtic for runners-up spot
in the championship, take on Falkirk at Easter Road (5pm kick-off),
still looking for their first win of the season over the Brockville side
who also see themselves as live candidates for second place.
There is a chance that Hibs captain Gordon Hunter, who has missed the
last three matches because of a thigh injury, could be back, while
Falkirk add striker Paul McGrillen to the men who beat Motherwell.

THE only balls bowled at Chester-le-Street yesterday were snow balls,
as Scotland's cricketers saw the second of their one-day ''warm-up''
matches against Durham frozen off because of sleet and snow.
Spirits were high as Gordon McGurk (above left) and Donald Orr showed,
but director of cricket Jim Love conceded it was hardly ideal
preparation for their opening Benson and Hedges Cup tie against
Worcestershire on Sunday. ''We haven't learned very much, except how to
bowl in very cold conditions,'' he said.
If the team was frozen out yesterday, it appears as if Bruce Patterson
has frozen himself out of the team after a row concerning the Ayr
opener's failure to attend a recent nets practice.
''It was Bruce who pulled himself out of this trip, so he won't be
considered,'' said Love.
Patterson or not, Yorkshireman Love, who will captain the Scots, is
confident that his side will provide a test to the recognised county
sides.
The team will be announced today for the game at Worcester, with the
same sqaud likely to take on Derbyshire at Titwood next Tuesday.
Wicketkeeper David Haggo, who had injured a finger, will be fit,
though Freuchie paceman David Cowan is struggling with a knee injury.
Poloc all-rounder Keith Sheridan also is available having arrived back
yesterday after wintering in Australia.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown, obviously lifted by his team's last
result in Moscow, named an almost identical squad for the qualifying
game against San Marino next week.
And afterwards he followed Rangers' manager Walter Smith in a spirited
defence of the state of the national game. At the weekend, Smith had
refused to accept an increasingly-pessimistic view of the domestic game,
pointing out that Rangers have played to near sell-out gates at Ibrox
throughout the season.
Yesterday, Brown also climbed aboard that particular bandwagon
insisting: ''I don't see that you can say the game is in crisis, I don't
think that Walter Smith or Tommy Burns or some of the other leading
managers would think so either. I am sure that they would expect to do
better in Europe next season at club level than they did last time
around.
''And you can hardly talk about a crisis when the under-21 team has
won its last three games -- and two of them away from home. Then we have
the under-16 team going into the European Finals in Belgium and that
can't be bad either.''
Brown believes that San Marino, unlike some of the other 'minnows' of
European football, have not made any great improvements since Scotland
played them last, but he worries over the surroundings.
''Our players will have to focus all their attention on the field of
play and forget about the stadium and the lack of atmosphere,'' he
warned.
''It is not what they are accustomed to. You are looking at a ground
with a capacity which is maybe half of what you get at Meadowbank. Since
the last time we played there, one side of the ground which had a kind
of stand, has now been left empty. But I believe this squad is
professional enough to handle all of that.''
He also admits that he would expect to beat San Marino every time
Scotland faced them and has selected a squad with a higher than usual
number of strikers in it to emphasise that.
''We have five front men,'' he pointed out, ''and we are looking for
goals. John McGinlay, for example, and Duncan Shearer are players who
can always get you goals.
''They have that knack about them and that is what we need. Then Pat
Nevin can carve out openings and that is what we will be looking for.''
Brown looks sure to stick by his preferred three-at-the-back defensive
formation which worked so well in Russia in the draw the Scots gained
there last month.
Alan McLaren, Colin Calderwood and Colin Hendry are already inked in
and this time they will be under less pressure than they were in Russia.
The squad is:
Jim Leighton (Hibernian), Nicky Walker (Partick Thistle), Steven Woods
(Motherwell), Tom Boyd, (Celtic), Colin Calderwood (Tottenham Hotspur),
Colin Hendry (Blackburn), Stewart McKimmie (Aberdeen), Alan McLaren
(Rangers), Brian Martin (Motherwell), Stephen Wright (Aberdeen), John
Collins (Celtic), Gary McAllister (Leeds United), Billy McKinlay (Dundee
United), Paul McStay (Celtic), Darren Jackson (Hibernian), John McGinlay
(Bolton), Pat Nevin (Tranmere), Duncan Shearer (Aberdeen), John Spencer
(Chelsea).

EXCLUSIVE
CELTIC could find themsleves in further ''tapping'' trouble with
Scotland's soccer officials after what appears to be an extraordinary
gaffe by the Parkhead club.
I understand that in their submission to the tribunal, which has been
set up to investigate the season-long row over the illegal approach made
to Tommy Burns while he was manager of Kilmarnock, Celtic have admitted
approaching another premier division manager while he was under
contract.
The manager in question is Ivan Golac, sacked by Dundee United last
month, but, at the time Celtic were looking to appoint a new manager, he
was still basking in the glow of that Scottish Cup victory just a month
or two earlier.
My information is that Celtic and chief executive Fergus McCann have
given details of this in the evidence they have put forward to be
considered by the tribunal when it eventually sits.
It was scheduled to meet last week, but that hearing was postponed to
a future date.
Celtic, of course, have already been fined #100,000 by the Scottish
League after they were found guilty of making an illegal approach to
Burns while he was still player and manager at Kilmarnock.
There were further fines for the club, and for Burns and his assistant
Billy Stark, from the Scottish Football Association and now still
further punishment could follow on the admitted approach to Golac.
My information is that Dundee United have been alerted to the Celtic
statement and a complaint from them to the Scottish League could lead to
another fine.
Even without a complaint, there appears to have been yet another clear
breach of the rules by Celtic.
When they were fined before, and appealed the decision, they were
supported by just one other club. This time they could find themselves
standing alone, because, whatever Fergus McCann may think, football has
its own rules and clubs, directors, managers, and players must abide by
them.
The row between Celtic and Kilmarnock has embarrassed Scottish soccer
throughout the season. It becomes an even bigger embarrassment when
Celtic admit to a further flagrant breach of the rules.
Despite rumours of an interest in Golac last summer, following the
sacking of Lou Macari, there was never any suggestion that the Tannadice
manager had been ''tapped''.
For some strange reason, Celtic themselves appear to have handed over
this fresh revelation which could cause still more trouble for a club
which was always held in high respect by the rulers of our national
game.
* A PRIVATE specialist is expected to confirm today that Everton
striker Duncan Ferguson is out of the FA Cup final.
The controversial Scot, who has become something of a folk hero among
the Goodison Park fans since moving from Rangers in October, returned to
action after a month out through suspension at Sheffield Wednesday only
on Monday.
But the #4m man -- still under the shadow of a possible jail sentence
following his clash with Raith's John McStay last season -- lasted only
30 minutes at Hillsborough before limping off. Manager Joe Royle fears
the man he calls ''Big Dunc'' will need a hernia operation.
That would almost certainly rule the 23-year-old Ferguson out of the
FA Cup final against Manchester United on May 20 as well as Everton's
continuing battle against relegation and Scotland's European
Championship qualifier against San Marino next Wednesday.
The loss of Ferguson for the FA Cup final will be a major blow for
Everton. The Scot caused United's central defenders Steve Bruce and Gary
Pallister no end of problems in the Premiership clash at Goodison in
February before netting the only goal of the match.

Motherwell 2, Aberdeen 1
THEY have unearthed a genuine togetherness and willingness to fight to
the end but it looks as if Aberdeen have left it much too late. They
gave as much as could be expected in a thriller of a contest at Fir Park
last night but, like their attempts to get out of the relegation trap,
it was not enough. They are stranded at the bottom, four points adrift
of the pack and have only three games left. Their demotion for the first
time in the club's history appears virtually assured.
They had the misfortune to come up against a Motherwell team playing
in the kind of style that hoisted them to the second spot in the table
many months ago. With their back four, midfield, and front-line all
using the ball intelligently and the entire team clearly motivated for
this one, Motherwell were always that bit smarter than their opponents
but they were never certain of victory until the end, simply because
Aberdeen refused to abandon their cause.
They had gone a goal behind in 38 minutes to a goal by Shaun
McSkimming but came back with admirable courage to level matters four
minutes afterwards from a Billy Dodds strike.
There was not a great deal between the sides until Motherwell went
ahead again early in the second half from a strike by Dougie Arnott and
from then on it was pulsating action, with Motherwell just hanging on in
a ferocious finish.
In the circumstances, it was perhaps not surprising that Aberdeen
manager Roy Aitken was not ready to concede defeat. He had waited on the
touchline at the end to speak to referee George Clyde who was involved
in a series of controversial decisions.
Aitken was particularly upset by a decision near the end when
Motherwell's Brian Martin handled the ball in the penalty area. ''The
referee made a statement that the hand ball was not deliberate, but the
boys and I are bemused by that,'' he said.
''We do not expect any favours but equally we do expect a fair crack
of the whip. With Dundee United's win tonight it makes things very
difficult for us and it means we must take nine points out of nine to
have any chance.''
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish said that Martin insisted the ball hit
him on the hand. McLeish felt that Motherwell just deserved to win.
''We showed a passion that wasn't there on Saturday and the players
owed it to the fans and themselves to put on a committed performance,''
he said. ''It went for us this time.''
Aberdeen's sizeable following gave their team immense backing right
from the opening minute. Their singing and chanting was much louder and
more constant than is the norm at Pittodrie, let alone away from home,
and although Motherwell looked committed enough, the response from the
northern players was easy to detect. They chased and harried and ran,
which they needed to do as Motherwell rediscovered some of the passing
movements that had been missing recently.
One slick manoeuvre ended with a cross being deflected just out of
McSkimming's reach and a ferocious drive by Jamie Dolan might well have
been on its way to goal but for the intervention, albeit involuntarily,
of an Aberdeen defender's foot.
The Dons had their attacking moments, too, especially one low,
hard-hit Brian Grant cross which raced across the front of goal with the
Motherwell defenders transfixed and Dodds only a few feet away from
touching it over the line.
Grant put over another fine cross from the other wing a little later
on and Paul Kane might have done better with his volley that hit it over
the bar from just inside the penalty area.
Dodds did reach another well-placed ball to the heart of the
Motherwell defence, this time from Joe Miller, but he could only help it
further into the air and the grasp of Stevie Woods.
The first man to have the yellow card waved at him was Peter
Hetherston, who could have no complaint after his flying body check on
Dolan.
Strikers Tommy Coyne, of Motherwell, and Duncan Shearer, of Aberdeen,
followed him into the book in quick succession for dissent.
With 17 minutes left Motherwell replaced Miodrag Krivokapic with Andy
Roddie and signs that Aberdeen were getting frustrated were shown by the
booking of Miller for a swing with his boot which fortunately missed the
ball and Eddie May. Aberdeen tried one more change, Stephen Glass
replacing Gary Smith, but time had run out on them, in every sense.

I SPENT the Easter weekend in London and took a busman's holiday trip
out to Richmond to watch London Scottish take on Nottingham. Our exiles
lost a fairly dire encounter by a single point, thus reviving fears that
they might yet slip into the English Third Division.
I do not believe that is likely to happen -- they were considerably
under-strength on Saturday -- yet I was not over-impressed by the
standard of play from either side. The best player on the park was
34-year-old Chris Gray, 22 times capped by Scotland, without whom
Nottingham would have toiled to win any lineout ball.
Otherwise, the back play was predictable with much aimless kicking
while, on the opposing put-in, forwards would simply leave the scrum,
stringing themselves across the field and making it even easier to
stifle enterprise. Are we not always being told how much better things
are South of the Border? ''The trouble with English rugby,'' folk
hurried to inform me, ''is not that there are too many foreign imports,
including Scots, Irish and Welsh, but that most of the best players are
concentrated at a very few clubs.
''Bath, Leicester and Wasps do have internationalists in their second
fifteens. It would be a far healthier situation if these guys were to
play for other First Division clubs.''
As I shared a jar with London Scottish officials before the start, the
game of the day, Leicester versus Bath, was being shown live on Sky. In
no time at all the touch judge was calling Yorkshire referee Stuart
Piercy's attention to skullduggery off the ball.
Before Leicester won through 31-12, two props had been warned for
stamping, opposing flankers Steve Ojomoh and Neil Back had staged a
lengthy wrestling match far away from the play, Bath full-back Jon
Callard had been warned for a high tackle and his team-mate, England
prop Victor Obogu had shouted at the ref following a penalty for
collapsing the scrum.
Even more astonishing, since the conclusion of the game, has been the
war in print. Players have criticised their opponents, accused each
other of over-reacting, Bath have slated the referee and a player -- a
member of England's World Cup squad -- has even suggested an RFU
''plot'' to keep the club from winning all the trophies.
Let me give you a selection of quotes from the English press. Ben
Clarke, Bath and England, 6ft 5ins, 17 stones: ''Aadel Kardooni, the
Leicester scrum-half, tried to have me sent off. It could have had
disasterous consequences for me. I pushed him and he dived. If he wants
his acting card from Equity he will have to do better than that.''
Kardooni, 5ft 8ins, 11 stone 8lbs: ''I would never do that. The
referee was consulting a touch judge and I tried to move in quickly so
we could get on with the game. Ben swore at me and clipped me across the
head.''
Bath captain John Hall: ''Ubogu was wrong to lose his cool, but I can
understand his frustration. We never collapse scrums -- ever!'' Stuart
Barnes, former Bath and England fly-half: ''The trouble with English
referees is that they apply the rules -- they simply do not in most
other countries.''
Mike Catt, Bath and England threequarter: ''The penalty count against
us in the last three matches has been unbelievable and he (Mr Piercy)
was the worst referee I have encountered. I don't know if the RFU are
upset that we keep winning all the trophies and are paying referees to
pull us up.''
I don't know either, Mike, but I am absolutely certain if you came up
with a line like that in Scotland you would find yourself meeting the
disciplinary panel the very next week. Indeed, in most other sports,
this kind of public whingeing would not be tolerated for an instant.
Imagine if Eric Cantona slagged off referees -- in French or English,
say Walter Smith claimed there was an SFA conspiracy to stop Rangers
winning too many trophies, just think what would happen if Celtic
accused referees of being paid to cheat. It's not on.
I am the last person to want to put a gag on players, I speak to them
all the time. But there are some in the England squad who believe they
are bigger than the game itself, and there is little evidence that the
RFU are prepared to taken any action.
Brian Moore should have been disciplined for his remarks after the
Calcutta Cup match. Not only were they an attack on the Scottish style
of play, they were a thinly-disguised dig at the Irish referee.
Such tactics are not embarked upon lightly, maybe next time the ref
will try harder to please the prima donnas, maybe England will gain an
advantage by intimidating officials. If their own union are not prepared
to back referees like Mr Piercy, where is the game going?
For I will tell you this -- whether rugby union is to be an amateur or
a professional occupation, it will still require, in such a physical
sport, discipline to be maintained off and on the field. That's
something they learned a long time ago in rugby

SCOTLAND under-21 coach Tommy Craig mapped out a familiar way to the
European finals for his team yesterday.
He brought in just one newcomer to the squad who will play in San
Marino next week -- West Brom's 18-year-old goalkeeper Gary Germaine
from Edinburgh -- and then warned that the hard work still lay ahead for
his players.
''I know that, on paper, the hardest games are now past,'' he pointed
out yesterday.
''We have gone to Greece and Russia and won the games there, but we
have a habit of slipping up when we look certain to win matches which
will help us reach the finals.
''I don't want that to happen this time. We had a setback in our first
game in Finland, but the last time we qualified for the knock-out stages
of these European Finals, we lost our first match then too.
''I have kept faith with the players. Only Charlie Miller of Rangers
is out and that is because he is suspended for this match. ''These young
players are getting used to working together. There is a good feel about
the squad, and if we can keep our concentration and win the remaining
games, then we can reach the finals.
''Surprisingly, the Finns are going to be the biggest danger, and
before the tournament began, I would not have thought that would be the
case.''
Scottish under-21 squad:
Bollan (Rangers), Combe (St Mirren), Crawford (Raith), Dailly (Dundee
United), Freedman (Barnet), Germaine (West Bromwich), Hannah (Dundee
United), Harper (Hibernian), Jupp (Fulham), Lavin (Watford), Liddell
(Barnsley), McCann (Dundee), McDonald (Falkirk), McLaughlin (Celtic),
McNamara (Dunfermline), Murray (Rangers), O'Neill (Clyde), Pressley
(Coventry), Stillie (Aberdeen).

THE UEFA Cup final will be an all-Italian affair between giants
Juventus and potent new Euro force Parma.
On a bad night for Germany, Parma stormed to their third successive
European final when they beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 in their UEFA Cup
semi-final second-leg to complete a crushing 5-1 aggregate win.
Colombian Faustino Asprilla scored twice and created the third goal
for Gianfranco Zola as Parma, a third-division outfit as recently as a
decade ago, became only the tenth team to reach three European finals in
a row.
They won the Cup-Winners' Cup in 1993 and were beaten finalists in the
same competition 12 months ago.
Already 2-1 ahead from the away leg in Germany, Parma made the perfect
start when Asprilla seized on a rebound to shoot them further ahead in
only the third minute.
Zola set up Asprilla for the second after 55 minutes and the Colombian
returned the favour for Zola 12 minutes later.
Superstar striker Roberto Baggio clinched a 2-1 victory for Juventus
over Borussia Dortmund.
He curled in a free kick in the 31st minute of the semi-final second
leg to give the Italians a 4-3 win on aggregate after their nervous 2-2
draw at home in the first leg when they needed a late equaliser to stay
in the tie.
Sergio Porrini gave Juventus an early lead with a diving header in the
seventh minute before Brazilian defender Julio Cesar equalised for the
Germans from a free kick three minutes later.
But Baggio curled the ball brilliantly into the top left-hand corner
to put three-times champions Juventus in their sixth UEFA Cup final. The
Turin club will be aiming to pick up the trophy for the third time in
six seasons after victories in 1990 and 1993.
* MANCHESTER United yesterday insisted that they have no intention of
allowing Inter-Milan to prise Paul Ince away from Old Trafford.
The Italian side, who already had a #5.5m offer for Eric Cantona
rejected, revealed their intentions to make a double swoop.
But United's assistant secretary Ken Ramsden said: ''It's true that we
did have an inquiry from Inter about Paul some time ago, but Martin
Edwards slammed the door firmly in their faces at that time and nothing
has changed or happened to change our view.

Partick Thistle 1, Dundee United 3
DUNDEE United defender Brian Welsh made his farewell appearance of the
season at Firhill last night and, in the process, may have helped his
club to safety in the premier division.
For Welsh, turned striker for the night, scored two goals to hoist
United four points clear of bottom side Aberdeen and just one point
behind last night's opponents and Hearts in the battle against
relegation.
Welsh had been thrust into a striker's role in a gamble by new manager
Billy Kirkwood.
Afterwards, the player admitted: ''I have never played there before
from the start of a game. Obviously, there have been times when I have
been pushed forward late in a match when we are maybe trying to salvage
a result.
''But that's the first time I have started off up front. The manager
only told me before the game but I had played there in training with
Scott Crabbe yesterday.
''I was just delighted to get the goals because I start a four-game
suspension now and won't be able to help the team any more.
''I will be cheering them on from the stand but I wanted to go out
with some kind of gesture. This was perfect.''
Welsh's goals came in the second half when United had the best of this
relegation battle.
His first arrived after 66 minutes when a ball was played into the
Thistle penalty area. It was partially cleared and broke towards the
18-yard line. Billy McKinlay -- another Tannadice player who will miss
the rest of the season through suspension -- won a tackle and stabbed
the ball towards Welsh, who hit a low shot past Nicky Walker and into
the net.
That gave United the lead for the second time in the match. They had
gone in front as early as the sixth minute when David Hannah had headed
a cross from David Bowman into the net at the far post.
Thirteen minutes later Thistle had hit back. A cross from Alan Dinnie
was half cleared by Jim McInally. It dropped to Steve Pittman just
outside the United penalty box and the Thistle full back hammered a shot
into the net.
It had remained that way until Welsh's first strike. Then, 11 minutes
from the end, Welsh put the game beyond Thistle's reach.
This time it was a more typical goal from the big United player. A
corner from second-half substitute Andy McLaren reached him and he sent
his header past Walker for his own second goal, and United's third.
Welsh left the field a minute from the end to be replaced by Sergio
but, by then, his job had been done.
Kirkwood, celebrating his first victory since taking over at
Tannadice, admitted: ''When you are in this kind of situation then you
have to try something different, you have to gamble.
''We did that by playing Brian up front. We had discussed it
previously and decided it would be right and it paid off for us.
''Obviously, the other result went in our favour but we know that
there is still some hard work to be done in the three remaining games.''
The battling qualities which have pushed Thistle towards safety over
the past few weeks deserted them in a match which might have guaranteed
their place in the top flight next season.
Manager John Lambie said: ''This was a match which could have meant so
much to us. We could have left United and Aberdeen stranded -- but we
lost the opportunity.
''To be honest, United deserved to win as they always looked the
hungrier side. I don't know what happened to us but I've told the
players what I think and also what is needed from them in the remaining
games.''
There was just one booking in a match, Gordan Petric for barging
Thistle substitute Rod McDonald late in the game.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, Dinnie, Pittman, Watson, Welsh, Turner,
Grant, Craig, McWilliams, Cameron, Taylor. Substitutes -- McDonald,
Milne, Cairns.
DUNDEE UNITED -- O'Hanlon, Perry, Malpas, Petric, Welsh, McInally,
Bowman, McKinlay, Crabbe, Hannah, Dailly. Substitutes -- McLaren, Gomes,
Garden.
Referee -- G A Evans (Bishopbriggs).
* EAST Stirlingshire leap-frogged Ross County into the second top spot
in the third division last night with a 3-2 victory over Queen's Park at
Firs Park.
* RANGERS last night retained the BP Youth Cup with a 2-0 victory over
St Johnstone at Hampden, with Brian McGinty and Paul McShane scoring the
goals for the Ibrox side.

<HEADLINE>Ayr show loses space to golf range</HEADLINE>

A PLANNED golf driving range at Ayr racecourse, which has not yet
materialised, means that the Ayrshire Agricultural Association's annual
show will lose about 20% of the space normally available to it.
Show directors were in a bullish mood about the prospects for the
two-day event yesterday, however, explaining that the enforced
compactness might turn out to be an advantage rather than a
disadvantage.
Under the new arrangements exhibitors and companies renting trade
stands will be able to park in the centre of the showground, relieving
pressure on spaces in the public car parks. A one-way system will
operate, with separate gates for entering and leaving the ground.
James Guthrie, show chairman, said that it was in the autumn of last
year that they had learned that less room would be available to them
because of plans to create a golf range at the racecourse.
Subsequently, in January, they had been told the land could be
available but by that time they had completed negotiations with trade
standholders on the new basis. They were now anxious to see how
successful the new arrangements would be and negotiations were
continuing over the show's future at the racecourse.
The 152nd annual show will be held on May 3 and 4 and the organisers
are hoping for a turnout of about 25,000 people over the two days. A
special effort is being made to attract schoolchildren and about 1000
are already booked for a visit, helping to fulfil the association's
educational remit.
Ayr is traditionally regarded as the curtain-raiser for the show
season, being the first of the major events to get under way.
Yesterday's snowfalls over much of Scotland illustrated the problems of
going for an early slot in the show calendar. The first week in May has
in the past offered days of high summer or deep winter, sometimes with
serious affects on the box office.
The fact that the show is held midweek also placed a restriction on
possible visitor numbers but the trade exhibitors, for one, are opposed
to any change in that regard. ''They have told us that an important
factor for them is the 'quality' of visitor to the show,'' said director
John Duncan.
''Most of the people who come to Ayr are from the agricultural
community and, therefore, are potential customers -- which suits the
trade very well.''
For the first time at the show there will be a heavy horse
championship with champions competing from three sections -- Clydesdale,
Highland, and Mountain and Moorland -- for the Henry Murdoch perpetual
trophy.
Livestock entries this year are generally down and the number of dairy
cattle on show will be down from 302 last year to 272 this year. The
main disappointment in the cattle section is the withdrawal of the
British Limousin classes due to lack of support. There were only eight
entries from two exhibitors and show rules require at least three
exhibitors and nine entries. There are 74 Highland cattle entered this
year, a substantial increase.

<HEADLINE>South-west farmers beat cold weather Maize Group reaps benefits of plastic</HEADLINE>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>978813056</RECORDNO>

FARMERS in South-west Scotland are beating the cold weather by
planting their maize crop under plastic.
This year's crop is being drilled more than three weeks earlier than
last year because of the purchase of a new ''state-of-the-art'' machine
brought from France.
With its own machine the Solway Maize Group is reaping the benefits of
the recent fine spell by getting the maize into the ground under a sea
of plastic.
The cold spring weather has been a major stumbling block for maize
production in the northern areas of the country. But using the plastic,
the mid-April sowing is expected to give a better quality crop, earlier
harvesting operations in the autumn to allow the drilling of grass for a
double crop of the field.
The Solway Maize Group, made up of three South-west Scotland farming
partnerships, is pioneering the plastic with the purchase of the machine
which lays the plastic as the seed is planted.
Maize production has increased steadily over the past seven years in
Dumfries and Galloway, the Borders and further north as new varieties
are brought out to suit the colder, wetter Scottish climate.
Now the new French-made Jeantill plastic maize-planting machine -- the
first of its kind in the area -- is set to improve production on a
number of farms in the region.
The farming partnership of David Yates of East Logan and Firthhead,
Robert Gemmell of Brownfield Farm, Kirkton Road, Dumfries, and Buccleuch
Estates at Thornhill will plant more than 100 acres under plastic.
Maize on a number of other farms will also be planted under plastic
during the next few weeks.
''Last year we hired a machine but by the time we got it we were into
May and we had lost a lot of the advantage, said Mr Yates who farms with
his brother Brian.
''So we decided that we would buy one for ourselves and we are three
weeks earlier this year with the drilling. They say that a week at this
time is worth about double in growth terms and we are hoping to reap the
advantage in the back end,'' he added.
They have 240 dairy cows on the 750 acres and have been using maize
for seven years. ''We believe in the maize and we think this will give
us a better quality crop which we should be able to harvest at the end
of September, about a month earlier.
''This will allow us to seed the field and have a double crop,'' said
David who runs the farm contracting business. ''We expect to put in
about 300 acres of maize throughout the south-west and we have even had
a request from as far away as Kinross.
''As new varieties are brought out I think more and more people will
turn to maize. We have been converted to maize because of its benefits
and general health of the stock.''
Another of the partners, Robert Gemmell, said he was doubling his
acreage of maize this year from 15 acres last year to 30. ''Although it
is still in its infancy in this area more farmers are turning to it and
with the bio-degradable plastic.
''It gives us a good start because of the colder weather we have in
this area. The plastic holds the moisture and raises the temperature,''
added Mr Gemmell who has 160 Holstein Friesians on his farm.
He added that within a few weeks the plastic disappears but it gave
the crop the ideal start.

REVITALISED housebuilder CALA, which has just enjoyed its second best
week of 1995, is promoting young blood to take it into its next stage of
development.
Meanwhile, group managing director Tony Kelley, 51, who has been
concentrating on his responsibility for England as managing director of
CALA Homes (South), will return to the centre of the Edinburgh-based
group to support executive chairman Geoff Ball.
Robert Millar, 41, who has been with CALA in Scotland since 1985 and
was most recently development director for the East of Scotland, will
succeed Mr Kelley south of the Border.
The Midlands operation, for which Mr Kelley was also responsible, will
be developed as a separate entity.
Alan Brown, 34, who joined the group in the south of England in 1986,
has been appointed managing director of CALA Homes (Midlands). He has
had particular responsibility for the group's Midlands operation during
the last six months.
Mr Ball said: ''What we are doing is promoting some of the younger
guys in the company to take us forward into the next stage, having
stabilised the ship.''
Meanwhile, Donald Sutherland, 55, will join the board of CALA as a
non-executive director on July 1.
He retires on June 30 from Ernst &amp; Young, where he is involved in the
accountancy firm's strategy and operational management, with particular
responsibility for its south region.
Last month, CALA announced a near-500% increase in pre-tax profits, to
#1.98m, for the six months to December, although the rise was
exaggerated slightly by exceptional factors.
Edinburgh-based broker Bell Lawrie White is forecasting full-year
profits of more than #6m, an increase of at least 60% on the previous
year's figure of #3.76m. If achieved, this would be CALA's best result
since 1989.
Mr Ball, who is happy with market forecasts, said second-half sales
were on target.
In the week to Good Friday, CALA sold 21 houses in Scotland and
England. This was bettered only by the last week of January, when it
sold 24.

THE currency markets were slow to get back into their stride after the
Easter holiday weekend.
However, dealers are in agreement that the direction of the dollar
remains firmly southwards. Weak US housing starts fuelled speculation
that US interest rates will not be raised at least in the near future.
Meanwhile the pound suffered at the hands of a strong German mark
which pushed it down to 84.1 on a trade-weighted basis, dangerously
close to its all-time low of 84.0.
Against the German currency the pound lost almost three pfennigs to
DM2.2027. However, it maintained its firmer tone on the dollar in quiet
trading, gaining two-thirds-of-a-cent to $1.6139.
The minutes of the monthly meeting on March 8 between Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George
published today will be watched for hints on interest rate moves given
the recent weakness of sterling.
* GOLD reached a 6[1/2]-month high of $394.10 yesterday morning before
easing to end $4.75 up on Thursday's close at $394.
The interest had been sparked by a sharp improvement in silver
inspired by Comex last week where a major operator exercised call
options forcing those who had gone short to cover their positions and
the metal ended the day 34 cents higher at $5.65.

A SWINGEING record fine of #200,000 has been imposed on stockbroker
Greig Middleton by the regulatory body, the Securities and Futures
Authority (SFA), which has also reprimanded and fined the firm's
chairman, Mark Kemp-Gee, #5000 and director Valerie Marshall #10,000.
The company and its two directors have run foul of the SFA over a
failed #11m Docklands enterprise zone trust launched in 1991, the second
Grieg Middleton Enterprise Zone Trust. They were reprimanded for
breaching the Securities and Investment Board rules over the trust.
Because some of the investors who purchased shares in the trust are
taking action through the courts to recover alleged losses of the issue,
and the firm is pursing third-party claims in that action, Greig
Middleton had asked for an adjournment of the SFA's proceedings but this
had been refused.
The trust was launched to take advantage of tax benefits available in
enterprise zones by acquiring an office block in docklands. However, the
building is still empty and clearly worth far less than its original
#12m valuation.
Greig Middleton, which was acquired by discount broker King &amp; Shaxson
last March, made clear yesterday that it would fight the legal action
pending against it despite the SFA's criticism and fines. And both
Kemp-Gee, who has headed the firm since 1978, and Marshall, would be
retaining their postions.
A company spokesman said that since there is no suggestion of
dishonesty or malpractice, the company does not feel their position has
been undermined in the firm.

DRESSER Industries of the US yesterday declared its 34p per share cash
offer for Edinburgh-registered North Sea Assets wholly unconditional.
The US group announced that valid acceptances had been received in
respect of 49.5 million shares -- or 93.9% of the issued share capital
of North Sea Assets -- by 3pm on Thursday.
Dresser's offer for the company, whose head office is in London, will
remain open for a further 14 days, after which the US group intends to
implement the compulsory acquisition procedures laid down in the 1985
Companies Act.
When the offer was announced last month, the US group had already
secured acceptance undertakings in respect of 32.1% of North Sea Assets'
issued share capital.
Dresser Industries is a major force in the oil and gas services
sector.

has an annual turnover of about #40m across seven franchises in Aberdeen
and Dundee.
It may acquire a further dealership in Aberdeen and is also examining
expansion opportunities elsewhere.
Emphasising the importance of customer service, chairman John Clark
said: ''There has been considerable focus recently on bad news for the
motor trade, with talk of gloomy new car sales figures.
''However, we are not alone in viewing the future with confidence.
There has been quite considerable investment in the motor trade in the
north-east of Scotland in recent months.''
The investment by 3i, in Ordinary and Preference shares, gives it a
25% stake in the John Clark Motor Group.
* MEANWHILE, expanding Hawick-based knitwear exporter Stuart Noble has
received #350,000 of equity funding from the Glasgow office of 3i.
The firm, which was founded only three years ago and now employs 60
people, supplies Saks Fifth Avenue, Maceys and Burberrys in North
America, as well as Christian Dior and Giorgio Armani in Europe.
Stuart Noble, which weaves cashmere, silk, cotton, merino, wool and
blended knitwear, also supplies a number of large trading houses and
department store chains in Japan.
Managing director Roger Lindop said the 3i investment would enable the
business to build on its recent success and continue expanding its
customer base from a strong balance sheet position.

Washington, Tuesday -- World economic conditions are the best for
years and closer trade links among nations are fuelling global growth,
but the Mexico crisis shows governments have less room for error,
according to the World Bank.
In a report on the outlook for the world economy and developing
nations, growth over the next decade is forecast at 4.9% a year in
developing countries -- up from the 2% estimated for 1994, and 2.8% in
industrial nations -- down from the 3% estimated for last year.
East and South Asian countries are expected to enjoy the fastest pace
among developing countries, with the Middle East and North African
regions lagging. The study says that while the economic climate is
bright, wide gaps exist among nations.
The bank said world trade will be a major source of growth over the
next decade. It said the integration of developing countries into world
trade and capital markets is perhaps the best way to boost incomes in
rich and poor nations alike.
''The sea change in policies in developing countries, and their
increasing integration into world trade and finance, are underpinning
the prospects for economic growth in these countries and for growth in
trade,'' said Michael Bruno, the bank's chief economist.
He said the merging of developing nations into the global economy
carries major benefits for wealthy nations. ''But, as the recent
difficulties in Mexico show, the process of integration will not
necessarily be smooth,'' he added, arguing that governments must follow
sound policies or risk incurring the wrath of financial markets, as
Mexico did.
''It is more important than ever that governments everywhere maintain
sound macroeconomic fundamentals and strict discipline in their economic
management,'' said Bruno.
The report said economic globalisation is being driven by more open
access to nations' markets for goods and services.
Technological changes are tearing down physical barriers to global
transactions, with big investors able to shift huge sums of money across
borders with the flick of a button.
If efforts to remove trade barriers continues, the market for trade in
goods is projected to grow more than six percent a year over the next 10
years, the fastest pace since the 1960s. Trade in services is expected
to grow more rapidly, driven by advances in information and
telecommunications technology.
Over the next decade, the bank forecasts average growth for the
following developing nation regions:
* Sub-Saharan Africa -- 3.8% a year.
* Middle East and North Africa -- 3.2%.
* South Asia -- 5.4%.
* East Asia -- 7.7%.
* Latin America and the Caribbean -- 3.5%.
* Europe and Central Asia -- 3.4%.
Income growth per capita between 1995-2004 is expected to range from
0.6% in the Middle East and North Africa to 6.6% in East Asia.
The study cited benefits for wealthy nations from the integration of
developing nations into the world economy:
* Gains from trade with developing countries tend to be larger than
from trade among industrial countries.
* Developing countries now account for a quarter of the market for
industrial country exports, and they could account for more than a third
toward the end of the next decade.
* Increased foreign direct investment allows firms in industrial
countries to reap the benefits of specialisation in production and
distribution on a national scale -- Reuter.

EDINBURGH Racers' management last night rejected cash problem claims
just 48 hours after having reached the British Championship final.
Club management -- who watched the side go down 7-2 by Sheffield
Steelers in Sunday's final at Wembley -- are gearing up for next season
but admitted: ''We need the Edinburgh public to get behind us.''
Racers, who were saved by a last-gasp rescue plan from a group of
Edinburgh businessmen 12 months ago, finished a respectable fourth in
the premier division and also reached the semi-final of the Benson &amp;
Hedges Cup.
General manager Alan Maxwell said: ''It's been a very satisfactory
first season but we're only in the first year of a four-year plan.
''Our aim is to get Racers into Europe and to do that we've got to
follow Sheffield's example and win the premier division title.''
Maxwell said: ''The fact that the club was almost extinct 12 months
ago is history now. Rumours of cash problems are a lot of rubbish.
Certainly, we need a major sponsor as commercially we're in the third
division. Naturally, we'd like more fans to come and see us but we've
laid a plan and we're moving forward on that.''
He added: ''We've got a great family sport and are playing in a
British league that gives the city a national platform. All we're asking
is that the public give us a chance.''

STUART Cowie's decision to switch allegiance from England has paid
dividends and he will make his first senior international appearance for
Scotland in the European Championships in Amsterdam next week.
Cowie, England's leading under-18 player last season, was able to
change nationality because his father is from Aberdeen, and he comes in
to replace Derek Ritchie from the side that won the bronze medal last
year.
The rest of the line-up -- Peter Nicol, Martin Heath, Dave Gordon, and
Barry Sutherland -- all retain their places.
''Getting into the Scottish senior side has been my main aim this
season, so I'm delighted to have made it,'' said London-based Cowie, who
currently is at No.82 and expects to rise into the top 70 when the next
world rankings are announced next month.
''I'm really looking forward to next week, and I think Scotland have a
chance to do really well. It will be a thrill to be part of the side.''
Cowie clinched his place in the team by finishing second to
Belgium-based Gordon in last weekend's final trials at Heriot-Watt
University.
Nicol and Heath already were automatic choices while Sutherland, who
suffered only one defeat all season, secured his spot through his
efforts in winning this season's Scottish grand prix.

THE Scottish Badminton Union will meet in the next two weeks to
discuss the Scotland Under-18 side's abysmal performance in last week's
European Junior Championships in Nitra, Slovakia.
The team came second last out of 16 countries, losing heavily to
Bulgaria (5-0), Finland (5-0), and Norway (3-2). They only managed a
face-saving 3-2 win over another relegated nation Wales.
The poor showing means the Scots drop out of the prestigous bi-ennial
competition to play in the lowly Finlandia Cup.
Scotland coach Alison Fulton believes that sweeping coaching advances
made by rival nations in recent years are largely responsible for the
Scots' decline. She also maintained the introduction of badminton as an
Olympic sport was a factor.

SNOOKER: JAMES TRAYNOR reports from The Crucible
THE sentence if a verdict of guilty is returned will be a life ban.
Jimmy White could live with that. After the events of recent weeks Jimmy
White could live with anything.
So far as this ''half-reformed toe-rag'' -- his own description -- is
concerned, snooker, indeed all sport, was put into perspective recently
when he was diagnosed as having cancer.
Fortunately, the removal of his left testicle was sufficient treatment
and gave him the right to take out a new lease on life. He returned to
the Crucible and the 1995 Embassay World Snooker Championship claiming
he was feeling ''sweet as a nut.''
The lopsided smile was back in place but, as is usually the case with
White, another crisis was lurking.
He has been summoned to a World Professional Billiard and Snooker
Association inquiry into alleged match fixing and, while the prospect
doesn't strike him with the same dread it might have a few weeks ago, it
is a concern, although he will confront his WPBSA inquisitors boldly. He
couldn't go quietly, that wouldn't be his way.
White will protest his innocence and expect to be cleared completely
when the inquiry sits this afternoon in Sheffield's Grosvenor Hotel. The
only way the 32-year-old will leave the championships is by being
dismissed on the table.
The lacklustre, almost inept manner, in which his first-round opponent
South African Peter Francisco tried to win prompted the game's
authorities act quickly in setting up their inquiry after they had been
alerted by the Betting Licence Association who became suspicious of the
number of bets being placed on the outcome of White's opening match.
Money was being offered on him to win 10-2 -- which he did -- and
concern increased dramatically. The speed with which the hearing has
been arranged has veterans of Crucible campaigns fearing the worst for
the sport.
They are anxious that their sport avoid the sleaze and corruption
which has been seeping into other major sports as inexorably as rising
damp.
Today, however, questions will be asked and answers demanded. If John
Spencer, chairman of the WPBSA, and his colleagues are not satisfied,
sanctions could follow, but no-one really expects White to be condemned.
Informed opinion, offered in hushed tones and in corners of The
Crucible Theatre says White, the Artful Dodger of the snooker world, is
likely to walk away with his reputation intact. Already the most
influential figures in the sport have rallied to the Londoner as he
prepares to face yet another crisis in a career which has been anything
but smooth.
His own manager, Barry Hearn, sprang to his defence as you would
expect, of course, but Ian Doyle, who manages current world champion
Stephen Hendry, also offered words of comfort.
''I've known him a long time and he wouldn't be involved in anything
like this,'' said Doyle. ''The other guy? To be honest, I don't know
much about him at all.''
Together, Doyle and Hearn can make White sound like a choirboy while
often the player, who has returned to The Crucible anxious to wipe away
the painful memories of six defeats in the final of the Embassy World
Snooker Championship, has appeared determined to play a different role
altogether. His ghostly-white complexion and his slightly-hunched frame
suggest he has just emerged from the backstreet halls where snooker had
its beginnings.
In the early days, a cigarette burning away in the ashtray enhanced
the image of a Jack the Lad who scorned authority and convention,
preferring to walk on the wild side. He also seemed to be padding along
in the footsteps of another rascal, Alex Higgins, and tales of his
drinking bouts which have tested the love of his wife, Maureen, beyond
reasonable limits are legendary.
He is a boy who refuses to grow up and, like Higgins before him, he
finds refuge in snooker, a game he plays from the heart in a way Steve
Davis never can, despite his devotion to practice. White is pure
instinct, his only fuel adrenalin.
He plays for more than points and bank notes and his game has greater
passion than that of anyone else. Often, it looks as though he
experiences genuine joy only when hurtling around a snooker table
potting balls with a swift nonchalance which makes the impossible look
easy.
Snooker brings people like White and Higgins to life. They are
adventurers, cavaliers who have to be different within a sport which is
so structured and proper.
However, life on the edge is not without casualties. Sometimes people
fall over and when Higgins began to self-destruct, White was left to
carry the non-conformists' banner on his own. It was fitting that he
should succeed Higgins as the people's champion and it is peculiar that
the two players with whom most people have been able to identify have
the dishevelled image snooker's governing body would rather not see.
There is something of the spiv in White, a cocky man who lives up to
the popular image of the pre-Crucible snooker player and each time he
walks into the arena he looks as though he has just come from one of the
old smoke-filled rooms where snooker survived before being cleaned up
and made presentable for television.
The WPBSA have moved smartly to hold their inquiry, perhaps anxious to
prove to the sponsors like Embassy who direct millions of pounds into
the sport that they are determined to investigate any irregularities
alleged or otherwise and keep the game clean.
However, while White may not be a sponsor's dream, he is innocent as
many of the people at The Crucible will tell you.
''He isn't capable of anything like this,'' said Hearn and Doyle
added: ''Jimmy White couldn't possibly cheat. I've known him for years
and he just wouldn't do it.
''He's much too honest. I've seen him call fouls against himself at
crucial times in matches. I know he isn't exactly an angel, but there is
an open honesty about White and he wouldn't do anything intentionally to
harm his sport.''
This is the way the people see him also and many of them have come to
Sheffield hoping to watch him win the world championship.
He has lost six times in the final here, but move among the audience,
the elderly women who want to mother this wayward son, and even the
players and everybody will tell you the same thing -- Jimmy White is a
winner.

AC MILAN v PARIS ST GERMAIN
HOLDERS AC Milan go into their European Cup semi-final second leg
against Paris St Germain tonight with an outstanding chance of reaching
the final for the fifth time in seven seasons.
Milan take a one-goal lead into their San Siro stadium thanks to an
injury-time winner from Croatian striker Zvonimir Boban in the first leg
in France two weeks ago.
Winners of the trophy in 1989, 1990, and 1994 and beaten by French
club Marseille in 1993, Milan are pinning everything on reaching the
final again having given up hope of winning the Italian league for the
fourth time in a row.
''This is a semi-final that is worth the whole season to us,''
vice-president Adriano Galliani said.
Milan were beaten 3-1 by Internazionale in a competitive and exciting
league derby on Saturday. ''We lost, it's true, but we played some good
football and we're alive and well,'' Galliani said.
Milan welcome back captain Franco Baresi, who was suspended for the
Inter game, and French midfielder Marcel Desailly and striker Marco
Simone, who were both rested.
Simone summed up the cautiously confident mood of the Milan camp,
saying: ''We had better start off as if the scoreline were still 0-0 and
not 1-0 from the first leg, even if we know that mathematically we are
the obvious favourites. A place in the final is well within our reach.''
Simone will line up with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in attack, while
Desailly joins Demetrio Albertini, Stefano Eranio, and Boban in
midfield.
Suspended defender Alessandro Costacurta will be replaced by Filippo
Galli alongside Baresi in central defence.
PSG's Liberian striker George Weah still believes his side have every
chance of reaching the final.
Weah, tipped to join Milan at the end of the season, dreamed PSG would
win the second leg 3-1, just as Inter did on Saturday.
''At the San Siro, we've got to abandon any inferiority complex and
get stuck into Milan with our attacking game,'' he said. ''The ideal
would be to score a goal early in the game.''
PSG coach Luis Fernandez rested almost the entire first team and still
achieved a 3-0 league win over Montpellier last Friday. He then took his
players off to the countryside retreat of Pouligny to finalise
preparations.
''At the San Siro, we'll attack from start to finish and we'll see how
it goes . . . I'm certain we can pull it off,'' Fernandez said.
The French champions expect much of Brazilian midfielder Valdo, left
out of the first leg in favour of Rai but now recalled in place of his
compatriot.
Valdo will feed a two-man attack of Weah and David Ginola, while the
defence will be entrusted to the experienced pairing of Brazilian
Ricardo Gomes and Alain Roche. Probable teams:
AC MILAN -- Rossi, Panucci, Maldini, Albertini, Galli, Baresi, Eranio,
Desailly, Boban, Savicevic, Simone.
PARIS ST GERMAIN -- Lama, Kombouare, Colleter, Gomes, Roche, le Guen,
Bravo, Guerin, Weah, Valdo, Ginola.

OVERALL confidence among Britain's businesses remains high with nearly
eight out of 10 companies expecting to increase sales, according to the
latest survey by business information service Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which
also reports that there has been a small but significant drop in the
number of companies expecting to increase their prices during the second
quarter of this year.
The survey also shows that Scotland is still lagging behind the rest
of Britain in terms of business optimism. But the prospect for increases
in sales and new orders are improving. Prices are also expected to
increase.
Conducted between March 28 and April 6, the survey drew responses from
over 1700 managing directors in all areas and sectors of British
business. The optimism is calculated by subtracting the percentage of
respondents forecasting decreases in sales, new orders and other key
indicators over the coming quarter.
For Scotland, there is a positive 43% expecting an improvement in net
sales, up from 40% in the first quarter but still well below the UK
average of 57% and in fact trailing all the other parts of the UK.
Scottish export expectations looked to have slipped from the first
quarter's positive 24% to 22% but the fall is much in line with the UK
as a whole where fewer retailers expect to increase their exports but
there has been an increase in export confidence amomg the manufacturers
of non-durable products.
Companies are overall less confident about increasing profits.
Optimism indicies have fallen from 46% for the first quarter to 41% for
the second quarter. The biggest drop in among wholesalers where there
has been a decline of 11 points.
The survey suggests that that there will be a slowing down in the rate
of inflationary increase during the second quarter of this year as
compared with the first quarter.
Three months ago the percentage of firms expecting to increase prices
during the first quarter of the year (compared with the same period of
the previous year) increased from two-thirds to 70%. It has now dipped
slightly to 69%.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's senior analyst Philip Mellor commented:
''Consumers, however, will not immediately benefit as prices in the shop
continue to increase in the short term.
''The survey shows that the proportion of retailers that expect to
increase prices has risen from 66.5% to 69.5%. However, the pressures
from the wholsalers appears to be receding making the long-term
prospects for lower inflation encouraging.''

LEGENDARY American football quarterback Joe Montana, who led the San
Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowl championships, announced yesterday
that he is to retire.
''I will be retiring from the NFL,'' Montana told a packed news
conference, ending months of speculation that he would hang up his
helmet.
Montana, considered the best quarterback ever to play the game, said
he has had 16 wonderful years, most of them in San Francisco.
''That day happens when you wake up and you realise it was not so much
a game any more and it really felt like a job,'' Montana said, who has
been with the Kansas City Chiefs for the past two years.

BILL Davis lit up a large cigar when his son resumed his first-round
match against Crucible debutant Andy Hicks yesterday, writes James
Traynor. He drew contentedly as his boy, Steve, fought back from 8-3
down to 8-7, but when Davis senior started chewing on what was left of
his smoke there was no need to look towards the table.
It was obvious Steve Davis, six times world champion, was being edged
towards only his eleventh defeat in snooker's most prestigious
tournament by 21-year-old Hicks who claimed his 10-7 triumph over the
No.2 seed as the ''best moment in his career.''
Davis, MBE and ever the gentleman, conceded defeat in the seventeenth
frame then admitted he had been outplayed. ''Andy was better than me.
That's all there was to it,'' he said while munching on a ginger snap
and sipping tea from a mug.
The 37-year-old was doing his best to appear calm even though, inside,
he must have been damaged severely.
Champions -- no, sporting legends -- are not expected to succumb to
unknowns and Davis' departure from these championships was greeted with
stunned astonishment.
Davis, who made his Crucible debut in 1979 when Hicks was only five,
had been beaten by the Tavistock player in the Skoda Grand Prix in Derby
this season, but The Crucible is a different arena altogether. Only the
mentally tough survive here, as John Higgins discovered the other day,
and no-one tipped Hicks to win again.
Even the defending champion, Stephen Hendry, who is now certain to be
the world's No.1 for the sixth year in succession because Davis was the
only player who could have gained enough points from this competition to
overtake him, looked on in silence.
Hendry, who begins his second-round match today against Tony Drago,
couldn't believe it and, although he ought to have been happy another of
the major threats to his crown had departed, he seemed sad, which was in
stark contrast to the broad smile which had spread across the face of
his manager, Ian Doyle.
Perhaps Hendry knew how Davis must have been feeling and maybe he felt
he was witnessing the end of an era even if Davis himself stressed that
he would not give up. However, he was unable to say whether or not he
had a seventh world championship within him.
''I'm not sure. I really couldn't say. I still hate losing and it is
still a wonderful feeling when you are fired up for a match,'' he said,
''but it takes longer for me to get motivated. You know, to get focused.
''Perhaps a defeat like this might help. Maybe a kick up the backside
will help me, I really don't know. I know I am one of the oldest players
now but I've got to keep fighting against the fear of playing like one.
''Just look at Terry Griffiths. He's 47 and he's still in the
tournament and I think that's wonderful. I think he's wonderful, in
fact. He is like granite, which is a lot harder than I am at the moment,
but I have to say Andy played really well.''
Hicks was ahead 6-3 when the match resumed from Monday night and when
he moved 8-3 in front he was cruising, but the real Davis emerged for a
spell and won four frames on the trot before faltering badly in the
sixteenth frame. He missed an easy black at a crucial stage in the next
frame and it was all over.
The clock showed 19 minutes past six in the evening. It might well
have been the precise moment time ran out on one of the true stars of
world snooker. First-round results:
W Thorne (England) beat T Pichit (Thailand) 10-6.
Frame scores (Thorne first) -- 40-66, 57-69, 76-0, 87-48, 65-28,

BRITAIN'S golfing world No 1 Laura Davies has broken her own world
record for the longest drive by a woman. One of three runways at
Philadelphia's international airport was closed for 30 minutes to allow
Davies to hit a ball 376 yards and better her mark of 341 set in Hawaii
in 1988.
Davies, who is averaging 269.1 yards a drive on the course this year,
hit 10 shots off a grass tee adjacent to the 5460-yard long runway in
the record attempt.
Amateur golfers will have the chance to out-fire her next month during
the Ford Classic at Chart Hills, Kent from May 18 to 21 -- her first
European Tour appearance of the season.

Ross Finlay enjoys a rising star's down-to-earth approach.
CAR companies with substantial competition budgets do not invest in
motorsport just out of the goodness of their hearts. They have to see
the benefit, not simply in publicity terms, but also in sales. It is
curious to an outsider that Subaru, not one of the biggest
manufacturers, should be so prominent in international rallying.
However, the performances of drivers like Colin McRae and Carlos Sainz,
in the highly modified works-team Subaru Imprezas run by Prodrive of
Banbury, do attract business to the showrooms. Subaru may be quite a
modest operation in this country, but last year it boosted its sales by
almost a fifth, with the Impreza figuring strongly in the marque's best
results since it arrived here in 1977.
Even connoisseurs of car manufacturing history find it fairly
difficult to back-track through the story of Subaru. It started as an
aircraft company offshoot which became so big that in 1950 it was split
into 12 smaller parts, five of which soon re-merged themselves. They
went into car production in 1958. Ten years later they joined the Nissan
group, but Subaru design, manufacturing, promotion and sales all remain
entirely independent.
The Impreza 1.6-litre GL two-wheel drive saloon is a far cry in image
terms from the 4WD rally cars. Subaru has its own ideas about body
design. This four-door saloon has a curious silhouette, absolutely no
exterior brightwork, and very few styling elements to link it with
current fashions. Many people will find that quite refreshing. It is
certainly easy to pick out an Impreza in a crowded car park.
That unusual roof and rear-screen line provides good headroom inside.
The Impreza has a practical cabin layout, with simple instrumentation,
the occasional eccentric switch location, and a fascia-top tray. All
versions come with power steering, a tilt-adjustable steering wheel and
headlamp height control. At #10,749 the GL adds central locking,
electric window and mirror operation, headlamp washers, and a
height-adjustable driver's seat. Boot space is good and, although this
is a three-box saloon, the back seat has a 60/40 fold-down split.
Until 1994, all Subarus sold here were four-wheel drive. What still
remains a Subaru trademark is the use of a horizontally-opposed engine
layout. The 1597cc engine has an alloy block and heads, four valves per
cylinder and short-stroke dimensions.
It peaks at 88bhp and, as you might expect from the basic
specification, low-down torque is not its strongest suit.
With that unmistakable ''beat'' which flat-four engines tend to
produce when slogging hard, it will hit 60mph in about 12 seconds and
reach a test-track maximum around 108mph. Steady-speed fuel consumption
figures are about 46mpg at 56mph and 35 at 75, compared with 28mpg in
city traffic.
I put in nearly 1000 miles in the test car, part of that distance on
motorways in order to get to Berkshire and back, but also a fair mileage
in the Pennines and the Yorkshire Dales, just to vary conditions on the
journey. High up on spectacular roads like the top-of-the-world route
over the Tatham Fells to Slaidburn, and the B6160 across the watershed
from Wharfedale to Wensleydale, the Impreza was true to its heritage and
design.
The suspension allows for a fair balance between ride comfort and
handling agility. A flat-four engine provides quite a low centre of
gravity, and the car is generally stable, but I was surprised that the
GL was so much affected by wind on a motorway cruise. There may be some
unexpected aerodynamic influence here.
On the winding hill roads, steering and brakes were well up to the
mark, but the high-geared 1.6 is certainly not a car in which to try
pass-storming in the upper ratios. To keep it on the boil, you need to
stay down the box. It is no Colin McRae-style performance car, but then
this practical production saloon comes at a keen price rather than
demanding a blank-cheque rally car budget.

AJAX v BAYERN MUNICH
TWO giants of the 1970s will attempt to recapture past glories tonight
as Ajax Amsterdam take on Bayern Munich for a place in the European Cup
final.
The two clubs, who between them won Europe's premier cup competition
six times in succession from 1971 to 1976, played out a goalless first
leg in Munich a fortnight ago, making Ajax favourites to reach the final
for the first time in 22 years.
The Amsterdam club, who have a seven-point lead in the Dutch first
division, have played 477 minutes in the European Champions' Cup since
last conceding a goal.
While Bayern continue to be plagued by long-term injuries to several
key players, including skipper Lothar Matthaeus, French striker
Jean-Pierre Papin, and Bulgarian internationalist Emil Kostadinov, Ajax
have no injury worries.
The only absentee will be free-kick specialist Frank de Boer, out
through suspension after having picked up his second yellow card of the
tournament in the first leg. The Dutch international defender will be
replaced by Winston Bogarde.
Finnish striker Jari Litmanen and veteran Frank Rijkaard return after
being rested for Sunday's 4-2 league win at Groningen. Patrick Kluivert,
who scored twice in that match, vies for the central striking role with
Nwankwo Kanu.
Ajax, who had much the better of the first leg against a largely
inexperienced German side, expect a similar pattern tonight, with Bayern
defending and hoping to capitalise on the counter-attack.
''We need to be alert to a quick break. If they score one, we have to
score two. But we're averaging two or more goals at home this season,''
Ajax coach Louis van Gaal said.
Ajax, bidding to record their one-hundredth win in European
competition, have smashed eight past Sparta Rotterdam and seven against
Willem II in league matches in the past month.
''It's easier to play defensive football than to attack. That's why so
many coaches opt for defence,'' van Gaal said. ''We play seven men in
front of the ball, the rest of the world plays with just three. Maybe
Bayern will play just one up front.''
Bayern coach Giovanni Trappatoni remains confident his side can still
reach the final, boosted by their 5-2 win over Eintracht Frankfurt on
Saturday.
But club president Franz Beckenbauer warned: ''Ajax are a different
calibre to Frankfurt. But Frankfurt was a good game for us. I'm much
more optimistic now about the game in Amsterdam.''
Sweeper Thomas Helmer, who was substituted midway through the first
half on Saturday, is set to retain his place, and defender Oliver
Kreuzer is fit after a knee ligament injury.
Defender Hansi Pfluegler, a member of Germany's 1990 World Cup squad
who last played European football in 1991, travels to Amsterdam and may
make a surprise comeback.
The Dutch ANP news agency said around 400 police would be on duty at
the Olympic stadium, a normal precaution against trouble at Ajax's
bigger games. Probable teams:
AJAX -- van der Sar, Reiziger, Blind, Rijkaard, Bogarde, de Boer,
Litmanen, Seedorf, George, Kluivert (or Kanu), Overmars.
BAYERN MUNICH -- Scheuer, Helmer, Babbel, Kreuzer (or Kuffour), Frey,
Schupp, Scholl, Nerlinger, Ziege, Zickler, Witeczek (or Sutter).

CHRISTIAN Salvesen announced yesterday that it had withdrawn from a
financially disastrous venture into the rock music business in order to
concentrate on its core activities of distribution and plant hire.
The Edinburgh-based group said that it had sold its Light &amp; Sound
Design subsidiary to a management buy-out team for #2m in cash. This is
#6m less than Christian Salvesen paid for the firm, which provides
lighting for rock concerts, in 1991.
Christian Salvesen chief executive Chris Masters said Light &amp; Sound
had been running up losses and was outside the group's mainstream plant
hire business, which focusses on industrial power and temperature
control equipment.
Light &amp; Sound, which operates out of offices in Birmingham and Los
Angeles, is the second ''non-core'' business which Christian Salvesen
has sold this year as part of a drive to concentrate on plant hire and
distribution.
Last month it sold Salvesen Brick, a firm which manufactures
engineering and facing bricks, for #63.5m.
The group's profitable Vikoma subsidiary, which manufactures equipment
for clearing up oil spills, is also being lined up for sale.
''We are hoping to conclude a deal on Vikoma in the next few weeks,''
Mr Masters said, but he declined to identify the prospective buyer.
One Edinburgh-based analyst estimated that Vikoma, which employs about
150 people at its factory on the Isle of Wight, would fetch between #4m
and #5m.
The chief executive said Christian Salvesen had no immediate plans to
balance its current programme of disposals with new acquisitions.
But he noted that the group had an option to buy the remaining 60% of
German industrial distribution firm Wolfhart in 1996. Christian Salvesen
bought an initial 40% stake in Wolfhart for around #2m earlier this
year.
Although Christian Salvesen decided to cut its losses with Light &amp;
Sound Design, Glasgow-based investment managers Murray Johnstone feel
confident enough about the firm's future to invest #3m of venture
capital in assisting the management buy-out.
Murray Johnstone investment manager Gary Tipper said Murray Johnstone
would take a majority stake in Light &amp; Sound and expected the business,
which employs about 100 people and has an annual turnover of about #12m,
to make a profit in its first year of operation under new ownership.
He admitted that there had been problems in its UK operations, which
contributed towards Light &amp; Sound missing a lucrative contract to
provide stage equipment for the current Rolling Stones tour, but said
the US wing of the business remained profitable.
Mr Tipper described Light &amp; Sound Design as ''a bit of a strange fit''
with Christian Salvesen, but he added: ''They have got a very good
management team, particularly in the US.''
Christian Salvesen shares shrugged off the #6m loss from the Light &amp;
Sound sale, gaining 5p to close at 251p.
Salvesen made a pre-tax profit #74m in the financial year to March 31,
1994, and is expected to show a slight improvement to about #77m when
results for 1994-95 are announced on June 12.
Earnings per share are seen slightly improved at 19.5p up from 19.0p
in 1993-94.

IF you are planning a new bathroom, you can choose one in any style
from country cottage through Victorian to French Provencal.
But if you want the ultimate in bathroom design, choose art deco --
this era was the one in which separate, purpose-built bathrooms were
widely installed for the first time, and all the exuberance of the style
was employed in their decoration.
Walls were clad in marble, or more likely wood or plaster painted to
look like marble, and sheets of mirror or black and white tiles were
fixed in graphic patterns.
The pyramid-inspired stepped shape that is a main feature of art deco
can be used to adorn almost every part of a large, stylish bathroom.
Choose huge, white sanitary fittings with a characteristic stepped
design, and build in a sunken bath for an extra luxurious touch.
Install taps and accessories in highly polished chrome, and store
plain-coloured towels on deep glass shelves supported by matching chrome
brackets. Have the front corners of the shelves gently rounded off to
give an art deco look and to get rid of potentially dangerous
protrusions at the same time. To echo the shape of a stepped pyramid,
have the row of shelves graduated so they increase in size from top to
bottom.
Near the basin, fix narrower shelves of similar design on which you
can display a collection of toiletries in suitably shaped and decorated
boxes and bottles. There's no need to search the antique shops and pay
the earth for authentic art deco items, since many modern manufacturers
take their inspiration from this heyday of the packaging designer's art.
You may even be able to find a tinted mirror in a stylised sunburst
shape which is small enough to be fixed over the basin from a city
centre department store, or a specialist bathroom fitments supplier.
Most sophisticated and stylish bathroom designs won't mix well with
children -- the choice is often between a sybaritic paradise with
scented bubbles and soft lighting or a dull, but practical bathroom
which is easy to keep ship shape. If this is your dilemma, then art deco
is the answer -- just forget about the glass shelving until the children
have grown, make sure to include a sturdy towel rail, and have somewhere
to store the plastic ducks.
Art deco was the first totally machine age style, its shaped colours
and materials merged applied art with industry and popularised
mass-produced design. The age of art deco began in Paris in 1925 at the
Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, a long-winded
title which the French quickly abbreviated to the now familiar term.
The revolutionary look with its geometric forms -- circles, ovals,
octagons, stepped bases, straight lines, gentle curves and dramatic
zigzags drew from many ancient and modern influences. Motifs originating
in Egyptian, Aztec and American Indian cultures mingle with echoes from
the Cubist paintings of Picasso and Braque.
The colours were inspired by Leon Bakst's costume designs for the
fashionable Ballet Russes -- pure, vibrant oranges, yellows, green and
reds teamed with black, grey and cream. Characteristically stylised
versions of specific motifs came to be associated with the art deco
idiom and are still immediately recognisable today -- the neat female
nudes, closely grouped flowers, attenuated animals, pairs of doves,
fronds, spirals and sunbursts of all kinds.
Innovative and appealing in its novel combination of motif, design and
colour art deco made its greatest impact, however, with its imaginative
use of modern materials. Instead of polished timber, furnishings and
accessories were made from plywood -- often given a lacquer-like gleam
with several coats of gloss paint -- chrome, plastics, including
Bakelite, Xylonite and Perspex, and glass. Strengthened plate glass had
just come on the market early this century, in a version suitable for
tabletops and shelving.
The art deco style is also perfect for a bedroom with an en-suite
bathroom. To set the scene for the art deco look, the rooms should have
plain-coloured walls, and be free of intricate architectural details
like cornices, picture rails and dados. Instead of small collections of
pictures and prints, hang one or two dramatic murals or panels. Use
blond wood for the furnishings, and go for geometric shapes,
re-inforcing the look with collections of female images typical of the
style, and perhaps including a framed sheet music score from the period.
An example of quintessential art deco furniture is an expansively
mirrored dressing table, designed to show off the expanding range of
beauty products which were becoming available in their distinctive
packaging. Art deco ashtrays and odd saucers found in junk shops can be
used to hold earrings and cuff links.
Reproduction art deco lighting is widely available. Consider having
semi-circular or fan shaped wall lights with frosted glass close to the
dressing table, or stand a scantily clad lady holding a spherical glass
shade aloft at one side of the dressing table. An ordinary divan bed
with a semi-circular headboard would tie the look together very nicely.
Floors should be pale -- a plain cream wool carpet in the bedroom
would be luxurious without spoiling the look, and would also be an ideal
contrast to a floor in a bold art deco style the ensuite bathroom.
Choose diagonal stripes, zigzag or checkered patterns, or call in an
expert specialist firm to make a sweeping curve by cutting the vinyl
tiles into the required shape.
If you are creating an entirely new bathroom, plan to site it as near
as possible to the water supply and drains in order to save money on
plumbing. If you are installing a second bathroom, two bathrooms are
best placed side by side or on top of each other, or next to the
kitchen, or above it. These are the ideal situations from an economy
point of view, but a new bathroom can be installed virtually anywhere --
in part of a hallway or landing, over a garage or porch, or in a
specially built extension.
A specialist installation firm will ensure that your new bathroom
conforms to planning regulations. A bathroom which contains a lavatory
must not open directly into a kitchen, workroom or living room -- there
must be a lobby or passage in between. The exception to this rule is
when a bathroom opens off a bedroom or dressing room, provided the
lavatory isn't the only one in the house. If there isn't a window or
skylight available, you must have a mechanical extractor fan wired to
the light switch to prevent condensation and smells.

ARSENAL have slammed speculation Tony Adams is set for a #4m move
after reports that the England defender is set to quit Highbury in the
summer.
The Gunners captain, in his thirteenth year at Highbury, has rejected
Arsenal's opening offer to extend the four-year deal he signed only last
season which has alerted Manchester United, Blackburn, Newcastle,
Rangers, and even North London rivals Tottenham.
But caretaker manager Stewart Houston insisted: ''Tony is staying. He
has told me that is what he wants and we've had discussions about
possibly giving him a new contract.
''All I've talked to Tony about in the last few weeks is football but
I've no reason to believe he's changed his mind. His contract does not
expire at the end of the season as I've read in the press. He is on a
four-year agreement but I can understand very few players of his stature
wanting to commit themselves for longer.''
Adams, a towering figure in the two Easter victories over Ipswich and
Aston Villa which have virtually secured Arsenal's top flight status in
a traumatic season, said: ''My contract is between me and the club. It
is nobody else's business and I'm not talking about it.''
He clearly wants to keep his options open because at 28 there can be
only one more chance of a lucrative move. He was disappointed with only
a small attendance for his ill-timed testimonial at Highbury just before
the start of the season and Arsenal have resisted overtures to grant him
another.
But Adams, who leads Cup-winners' Cup holders Arsenal in their
semi-final second leg against Sampdoria tomorrow, owes the club some
loyalty after they continued paying his wages when he was sent to prison
four years ago on a drink-related driving charge.

BIBLE black, quiet as a domino, Milk Wood slumbers beneath a canopy of
painted beds, strung on wires above the Olivier theatre's vast stage.
They are joined in the firmament by cart-horses and schooners, a panoply
shouting: countryside! seaside! starry night! A parade of children
appears, each shouldering a dinky model cottage with twinkling windows.
What is this? Disneyworld? No. It is designer Willian Dudley hovering
dangerously close to whimsy.
Thankfully, Dylan Thomas gets the upper hand and slowly his evocation
of a Welsh coastal village emerges as vibrant as ever. Here's Polly
Garter, who has too many babies but far more men. And Mrs Cherry Owen,
adoring two husbands: one sober, one drunk, both Mr Cherry Owen. And the
Reverend speaking only in verse and Mr Pugh, dreaming of hemlock but
serving tea.
A strong, predominantly Welsh cast beautifully convey the wild
individualism lurking behind serene surfaces, a riotous celebration of
universal eccentricity summed up in Polly Garter's remark: ''Isn't life
a terrible thing, thank God!''
If lavish staging does diminish the magic of this perfect radio play,
director Roger Michell does produce one true coup de theatre when Blind
Captain Cat, in his dotage, is visited in a dream by the ghost of Rosie
Probert. Here the use of flying wires is magical as captain and old
flame drift and bob in an ocean of air, or water, or memory.
By dying aged 39, Dylan Thomas sidestepped Delcroix's assertion that
to be a poet at 20 is to be 20, but to be a poet at 40 is to be a poet.
39 will do nicely.

VICTIMS of pensions salesmen might be forgiven for thinking that they
will be in the grave before they actually see the compensation they have
been promised by the regulators.
But the wheels are grinding away slowly and shortly the Personal
Investment Authority (PIA) will be telling its members how they should
go about compensating victims of mis-selling.
The report will set out priorities. Those who have retired since being
badly advised to leave a company pension scheme and take out a personal
pension policy or the beneficiaries of those who have actually died
should be treated as urgent cases and dealt with first.
Many retired people will be worried about their pension and the widows
or widowers of those who have died will be uncertain about where their
future income will come from.
In all some 1,500,000 people are thought to be affected by the
pensions mis-selling scandal and about 350,000 are in the urgent
category. The PIA will call on its members, which include virtually all
insurance companies transacting pensions business and nearly all
independent financial advisory firms, to compensate them if possible by
the end of this year.
The next level down of priority will be those coming up to retirement.
Younger people will have to wait their turn until these categories
have been dealt with and they are unlikely to be assessed this year.
The PIA's directions follow closely those given by the Securities and
Investments Board (PIA), the overall regulatory body, last autumn, and
it is surprising that it has taken five months to firm up those
proposals. The SIB indicated that the mess should be largely sorted out
by December 1996, though accepted that the loose ends could drag on
until the end of 1997.
The debacle will be difficult to sort out and will inevitably take
time. This is all very well for those a long way from retirement, so
long as they are confident they will not be forgotten, but it places
those coming up to retirement under strain.
It is going to cost the industry a lot of money, upwards of #2000m to
put things right, so it is hardly surprising that it has been dragging
its feet.
The aim of the regulators is to ensure policyholders are not worse off
from being mis-sold a personal pension. The favoured approach is to
reinstate them in their company pension scheme and there was a plea for
these pension schemes to be sympathetic.
However, there are signs that some pension schemes are being
ungenerous to the extent of actually quoting exaggeratedly high costs to
allow defectors back in. There is perhaps an element of feeling that
those who quit the company scheme were being disloyal and so should be
treated accordingly, which is plain mean-minded.
If re-instatement is not possible then the personal policy has to be
retained and topped up so it can provide similar benefits. This can be a
difficult calculation.
There will be borderline cases where it could be argued that the
customer will not be disadvantaged through having a personal pension
policy. The scope for complexity is immense. For example, the
policyholder may no longer be employed by the company whose pension
scheme he left.
The original financial adviser might have merged with another firm or
left the industry and in any case may simply not have the resources to
pay compensation. In these cases the industry as a whole will have to
pick up the tab.
Instead of procastinating the industry would be well advised to sort
the whole thing out as quickly as it can so it can then rebuild the
public's trust. This loss of trust has come just at the wrong time, when
universal state benefits are becoming parsimonious, making it imperative
for people to save more for retirement, health and long-term care
purposes.
The industry's practices have improved enormously since the pensions
scandal but it will take time for this to offset the current mistrust,
which is hitting sales of pension products.
The Prudential's new business figures for the first quarter show UK
single premium pensions business dropped 18%. Within this category
individual pensions were down 65%. However, sales of annual premium life
and pensions products were almost maintained at #63m.
In contrast, weak demand for PEPs caused sales of regular premium
investment products to plummet by 50%. Indifferent stock markets are to
blame for this.
While wrongs clearly have to be righted the regulators have to tread a
fine line between enforcing this and not making the cost excessive
because existing policyholders one way or another will end up footing
much of the bill.
The proprietary-owned companies should load it all on to shareholders,
but no doubt won't, while the mutuals have no option but to take it from
policyholders who are their owners.

RECORD collectors and devotees of Russian music should stand by for a
flood of releases in the West from the historic Russian record label
Melodiya.
An 18-year exclusive licensing deal has been signed between Melodiya
and the multi-national conglomerate, BMG Classics, in which the archives
of the Russian label will be systematically explored, re-engineered
using state-of-the-art equipment, and released throughout the Western
world.
The output of many artists -- some familiar only by their name and
reputation -- will, for the first time, become widely available. The
Melodiya catalogue will be released in waves each autumn and spring.
The first batch of releases, hitting the shops now, consists of 26 CDs
divided into three categories -- the Russian Piano School, Russian Vocal
Music, and the first volume of an Evgeny Mravinsky Edition, featuring
music performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and the
legendary conductor who shaped and presided over its sound for more than
35 years.
The Melodiya label has been, for over 30 years, the keystone in the
record industry in Russia. The industry itself was formally founded in
1919, when Lenin signed a decree nationalising and transferring all
workshops, warehouses and retail outlets for the fledgling phonograph
industry to the Educational Department of the People's Commisariat.
Only in 1964, with the setting up of the Melodiya complex, was the
unification of all recording studios and record factories in the Soviet
Union affected. This led to the establishment of a studio network that
embraced locations throughout the union.
At the same time, the main Anglo-American source of Soviet recordings
(which had been spread unsystematically across a bewildering range of
entrepreneurial companies) was transferred to EMI. In 1965, BMG itself,
through its Ariola label, acquired some distribution rights for Melodiya
recordings in a handful of Western countries.
With the birth of digital technology and the CD era, the Japanese (who
else?) were the first to get their hands on Melodiya material. Eight
years ago the enterprising British label, Olympia, entered the scene,
accessing some rare and valuable recordings.
The fundamental problem with all of these (apart from the confusion
caused to collectors, who sometimes found themselves buying the same
thing twice on different labels) was the poor quality of source
material. Even when not drawn from broadcast or pirated recordings,
Western issues of Melodiya material were based, at best, on second
generation tapes -- copies -- or at worst on transfers from vinyl discs.
The new Melodiya/BMG deal gives BMG exclusive access, for the first
time, to original master tapes. From these, digital transfers will be
made, and BMG has installed the latest equipment in the Moscow studios.
Every tape will then be processed in a laboratory in Berlin, using
20-bit Digital Audio Processing and a gamut of noise-removing gizmos to
produce, hopefully, performances of the highest quality from the
Melodiya treasure chest.
And what a treasure chest. The choral music in the first set of
releases, complete with ritual bell ringing, is of a sonority that will
blow the mind; only Russian choirs sing like this. The first set, from
the Russian Piano School, contains extraordinary characters. Of course
there are the familiar greats: Emil Gilels, Lazar Berman, and Sviatoslav
Richter.
But there is also Heinrich Neuhaus, teacher of both Richter and
Gilels; and Alexander Goldenweiser, who duetted with Rachmaninov, was a
close friend of Tolstoy and went on to become the most famed of Russian
teachers. His list of pupils is like a who's who of the next generation
of greats.
The great dictator of the Leningrad Phil, Mravinsky, gets a 10-CD
edition to himself, with more -- much more -- to follow in the autumn.
Opera also follows in the autumn. Currently being processed are
recordings of Shostakovich's The Nose, Rachmaninov's Aleko, Prokofiev's
War and Peace, Borodin's Prince Igor, and Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov,
several of them featuring the Bolshoi Opera.
It would be an exaggeration to say that there is no end to the riches
being uncovered in the Moscow archives. A spokesman for BMG Classics,
however, did say that there are ''forty million minutes of Melodiya
material on original master tapes awaiting digital transfer''. That
sounds like no end to me.

THOUSANDS turned out in glorious sunshine to watch the launch of a new
ferry at Ferguson Shipbuilders on the Lower Clyde yesterday as
speculation about the yard's future ownership continued.
HRH Princess Alexandra officially launched the #16m ferry Isle of
Lewis -- which was built at Ferguson's Port Glasgow yard for ferry
operators Caledonian MacBrayne -- at a ceremony attended by Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang and other dignatories.
The board of directors of its holding company, Ferguson Marine, is
expected to make a formal recommendation to shareholders within the next
few weeks to accept one of two bids to buy the shipyard.
Mr Frank Dunnet, the 80-year-old millionaire owner of the Holland
House electrical wholesale company, has bid more than #3.5m, while
Ferguson Marine chairman Sir Ross Belch has offered a sum believed to be
slightly less than the Dunnet bid.
At least three of the five Ferguson Marine directors considering the
bids favour Mr Dunnet's offer but none are able to comment because they
are constrained by the rules of the Takeovers and Mergers Panel.
However, one company source said: ''The highest price will get the
vote because the directors' first obligation is to the shareholders.''
Mr Dunnet, whose offer prompted the company's management buy-out team
to withdraw its takeover plans, yesterday broke his silence on the
matter to respond to concerns of the workforce about their future under
a new owner.
He said: ''My idea would be to expand the yard and put a little bit
more back into shipbuilding,'' adding that he hoped the workers would
have no problems if his bid succeeded.
The 660-tonne Isle of Lewis, which CalMac will operate on the busy
Ullapool-Stornoway route from the end of July, will be the largest
vessel to sail to the west coast islands.
It will carry almost 1000 passengers and 123 cars, more than doubling
the passenger capacity and carrying 50% more vehicles than the ferry mv
Suilven, which she replaces.
It also benefits from the latest navigational and marine safety
technology -- which comply with changes brought in after the Estonia
ferry disaster last autumn -- and will reduce current travel times on
the 40-mile route by about 30%, from three-and-a-half to two-and-a-half
hours.
This is expected to open up the possibility of day trips from the
mainland to the Western Isles and could provide a significant boost to
local tourism, according to Western Isles Tourist Board.
Earlier this year, the yard announced a new #12.5m contract for a
sophisticated North Sea platform supply vessel, taking its orders to
more than #100m since it was privatised in 1989. It made a #1.5m profit
last year on a turnover of just under #20m.
Mr Bill Scott, Ferguson's chief executive, said the ship reflected the
yard's ''unique ability'' to combine Clyde-craftmanship, teamwork, and
workforce co-operation with the latest technology.
Ferguson's employs more than 320 workers and currently has #48m worth
of vessels to deliver.

ALABAMA: Rescue crews searched a wooded area near Alexander City
yesterday for clues to the crash of a military jet that killed eight
people including an assistant secretary of the Air Force. The plane, a
military version of a private Lear jet, was on a ''passenger mission''
en route from Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, to Randolph Air Force
Base near San Antonio, Texas, when the it crashed.

REMEMBER Saturday morning children's TV? The middle-class kids stuck
in front of Swap Shop trying to trade a keyboard for Kerplunk!, while
the weans of the workers raved to Tiswas, danced the dying fly and
cheered the black-cloaked flan flinger.
The divide was never so clean-cut, but when Zoe Ball bounds around
studio A in Queen Margaret Drive this Saturday on the dynamic debut of
Fully Booked, the BBC's new network children's programme, she is sure to
remember a personal slice of Saturday Superstore.
The daughter of Johnny Ball was 14 and in the audience as dad answered
kids' questions then waved her down to draw the winner of Spandau
Ballet's pop contest. At 24 she still smarts with embarrassment at
meeting one of the giants of kids' TV, Mike Reid.
''I nearly died of embarrassment. It was bad enough that your dad was
on TV, but then he dragged me on; and I fancied Martin Kemp. It's hard
to look cool like that.''
Along with Noel Edmunds, Chris Tarrant, Sally James, and
contemporaries such as Phillip Schofield, Reid was a hero to millions of
pre-teen kids. The onus to repeat such success slips on to the shoulders
of Zoe Ball and co-presenter Grant Stott, as BBC Scotland take over the
cameras and produce the show.
Traditionally, BBC children's programmes have been produced in London,
but in a bid to avoid centralisation, plans were drawn up by John Birt
and the BBC board which ensure that 20% of all children's programmes
will be produced at BBC Scotland by the year 1997.
Fully Booked follows on from programmes like MegaMag and F.O.T, but
will be broadcast throughout Britain for 26 weeks starting on April 22.
Tucked inside a colourful, magazine-style mixture of music,
competitions, games, and cartoons is a comedy drama.
Entitled Weekend Break, the seven-minute slices feature young
Glaswegian schoolchildren navigating through the course of true love.
The hope of executive producer Edward Pugh and head of television Colin
Cameron is that the series, or one in similar style, could develop into
a successful network spin-off.
But the main criterion is to deliver a high-standard show and maintain
an audience of around a million. At yesterday's press launch, Anna Home,
head of BBC-TV children's programmes, said: ''I think live transmission
is important, and we'll have that advantageover ITV which, in a few
weeks, switches to pre-programmed cartoons and shows on a Saturday
morning.
''We feel it's very important that we should reflect the whole of the
United Kingdom, and we very much welcome the opportunity to have a
Scottish perspective.''
Among the Scottish perspectives is Morag the cow. The landlady at
Fully Booked is a bovine -- one of those huge, cuddly creatures that
should roll over on a plate, but instead can carve you up. Inside the
costume is Julie Westwood.
''I started as a puppeteer five years ago. I've done Gilbert's arm;
then a wolf's arm for the opposition. At the BBC I was a pair of lips
called Ms June in a show called Happy Birthday. Oh, and a cardboard box
in Allsorts.''
Now all the parts have come together in the fussy cow. ''Morag's posh,
she's a few steps up from the barn and she doesn't like the mess the
guests make.'' As Westwood does improvisational comedy, there'll be room
for witty ad-libs at guests.
The electricity behind Fully Booked's live buzz will, of course, be
the presenting partnership of Zoe Ball and Grant Stott. Grant, the
brother of Blue Peter's John Leslie, presented STV's Wemyss Bay 902101.
The pair met for the first time during Stott's stint over Christmas at
the Edinburgh King's in Babes in the Wood.
However, the fizz which flows through the show's trailers failed
last week on Live And Kicking when Ball forgot Stott's name. ''Yeah, she
was nervous, but I made her write it out 200 times after the show.
Saturday will be fine,'' said Stott.
''God, yeah, I know! I was just nervous and it came out all wrong,''
laughed Zoe.
Both are delighted to be invading television sets round the country at
such an early hour on a Saturday morning. But only Grant can remember
how to do the dying fly. ''Tiswas was brilliant,'' he says, lifting up
his legs and waggling them about. ''Because of work I haven't really
been watching the more recent Saturday morning shows. If I'd known I was
getting this job I would have watched them closely. Still, it should
give me an edge.
''Though it's set in a hotel, this simply means that we have an excuse
to do stupid things. We don't try and convince the viewers it's real,
they know it isn't,'' said Zoe -- a veteran of The Big Breakfast and The
O Zone.
Both, however, are preparing to run riot round the hotel, set with
live guests such as Baywatch's Jason Simmons, Jimmy Nail, and Bobby
Davro. The game Dash To The Flash allows young callers to steer
celebrities round the set searching for prizes. And every week Kriss
Akabusi tackles a brand new sport.
A new strand for lassoing young viewers is a holiday segment, Pack It
In which, though sounding like a mother's angry retort, takes young
heart-throbs from Byker Grover and Grange Hill and asks them to provide
a pint-size view of different holiday destinations.
The tradition of Saturday morning cartoons has not been sidelined,
with a Casper cartoon appearing alongside Mighty Max. Alarm-clocks
should be set on for 8.30am.

The town is immaculate. No trace of litter anywhere -- streets,

This in itself was like a holiday to me, an escape from the littery

CIVITAVECCHIA: Judicial authorities yesterday said that they had
lifted a ''custody order'' on a statue of the Madonna whose reported
tears of blood have caused thousands of Italy's faithful to flock to
this port city. Magistrate Antonio Albano lifted an injunction ordering
the local bishop, Girolamo Grillo, to keep the statue locked in a sealed
closet in his home pending the results of an investigation into the
whether the bleeding was a hoax. Albano did not say why he had revoked
the order.

GAVIN BELL'S article on the present state of the Knoydart Peninsula
will bring back gloomy memories of the Knoydart land raid and its
aftermath to many Highlanders (April 11).
In brief, here was a group of local men who had served their country
and who passionately believed they had a right to form crofts and work
land that was being left to waste. Alas, it was not to be. The power of
the state and Highland landlordism was against them and there was no-one
strong on their side.
What marked Knoydart apart from other land disputes was the negative
attitude of the then Labour Government towards the claimants. It must
have come as a great blow to the Knoydart men to find opposition in the
very quarter where they had expected support. It was a blow, too, for
the Highlands in general for it resulted in the demise of a segment of
Highland society.
There is little to be said for Labour over the Knoydart affair. Then
as now Labour Party spokesmen were loud in their condemnation of the
powers held by landlords in the Highlands, yet, when it came to the
test, they offered little or nothing to the land-hungry Knoydart men.
They have no excuse for at that time the Government was engaged in
nationalising huge swaths of British industry. In comparison, the cost
of settling the land question in Knoydart by creating small holdings
would have been trifling.
The then Secretary of State for Scotland did not meet the men who had
petitioned him at the beginning of the dispute. The nearest he got to
Knoydart was to view the land through binoculars from the deck of a
Government vessel. All that was missing was a basin of water wherewith
to wash his hands.

WE were enjoying a quiet drink in Glasgow on Easter Sunday, which
means that we were squashed in a crowded bar playing an impromptu game
of Name That Tune, racing each other to list the tracks and artists
blaring out over the pub stereo.
I was winning on the contemporary front; ''Blur!'' ''US3!'' ''Take
That! I mean . . . um, maybe it's Take That, it was, like, just a guess,
obviously I wouldn't really know for sure.'' But then the bar staff got
into a disco groove and Paul, the photographer, romped ahead; ''Curtis
Mayfield!'' ''Sister Sledge!'' ''Barry White, ah, this is my kind of
music.'' He's the same age as me but was temporarily locked in the
stranglehold of nostalgia.
''Mutter, mutter, mumble, mumble,'' said Steve the Queen, the
heterosexual nurse from Cheltenham. ''Speak up!'' we shrieked, too cool
to succumb to the temptation to moan about the volume of the music, too
fearful of seeming untrendy and, heavens forbid, past it.
''It's a pity we can never find a club that plays our kind of music,''
he shouted. ''Nonsense,'' we bawled back. ''That might be true of
Cheltenham (spitting the name out with suitable disgust) but not here.
This is Hipville, Strathclyde, and we can wander out into the night and
find any kind of sounds that we want.'' We paused and grimaced. ''As
long as we get there before half past 12.''
On cue, one of those implausibly beautiful, sickeningly fashionable
young things who waft around town like little fireflies, destined to
blaze brightly briefly, drifted past our table leaving behind her a
trail of club fliers advertising a be-there-or-be-square style Tarantino
Tribute Night. Steve managed to sigh and shout at the same time, which
was pretty impressive; ''but it's not like when we were young.'' We
stared, aghast. ''We are young,'' we wailed.
Asserting this youthfulness, Paul marched us up to a club, which, he
claimed, hosted a Latin night. ''You'll love it,'' he assured a
suspicious-looking Steve. ''It's really hot.''
''I feel old,'' I said 10 minutes later, staring dolefully into my
Margarita, as Paul's ''Latin'' club blared out some dreadful techno
drone, the DJ's little ''hah, hah, it's after the curfew, you can't go
anywhere else now'' joke. Steve dared me to ask the DJ to play something
by the Sugar Cubes. I felt even older.
''Let's go home,'' I said mournfully. ''We should have gone to Reds,''
admitted Paul. ''It's disco night there.''
When it comes to packing us twentysomethings on the dance floor disco
is the magic word, which is quite ironic considering that for most of us
it is a word inextricably linked with ''school''. Older generations and
newspaper headlines might still use it to describe young folks'
nightlife, as in ''are you going to the disco, dear'' or ''Disco War
Goes To Court'' but that usage is quaint and anachronistic.
We went to the disco -- the church disco, the summer camp disco, the
school disco, the hotel disco on holiday -- when we were young teens. We
wore lip gloss and highish heels and danced around white plastic
handbags with hi-energy abandon. Well, we girls did anyway.
Then punk came and left us reeling and puking and bleeding from all
those safety-pin holes, and with cod Cockney accents -- well, no it
didn't 'cos we were all really tucked up in bed when all that gobbing
was going on but it seems like a fun fashion retrospectively to hijack
-- and afterwards the discos looked the same but we all knew by some
strange form of cultural osmosis that they were no longer discos but
clubs.
High heels were dumped in favour of Doc Martens and if you took a
handbag it was de rigueur to check it in at the cloakroom. And we got
attitude and we got it bad but frankly that New Romantics period is
still too painful to reminisce about, and the comeback careers of Duran
Duran, Adam Ant, and Toyah Wilcox are definitely doomed.
Disco almost immediately became a word that dried up in your mouth. It
sounded as silly and outmoded as your parents talking about going to a
''hop''. If you forgot and accidentally asked your mates if they were
going to the disco you were instantly publicly reviled.
People would queue up to laugh in your face, while you flailed and
frantically tried to recover your street cred; ''slip of the tongue, I
meant club, I meant club.'' Get this and get this good: disco was a
musical genre, not the building in the High Street, even if it did still
have a mirror ball and blinking coloured lights.
But disco has been back with us for some time now. For a while the
hippest club nights have been those favouring disco classics but,
further, the notion of actually going to a disco is finding favour. One
of the biggest events this Mayfest will be the massive Discorama at the
SECC, a dance celebration attended by 2000 which is already sold out.
By hook or by crook I intend to blag myself a ticket and in the
meantime I'm practicing at home, trying to pick up the courage
nonchalantly to announce, in public, that I'm going to a disco. But I
suspect that my secret top desire will be thwarted.
Sadly, I reckon it will never ever be cool again to dance around your
handbag.

BECAUSE of politicians' worship of the totem of free trade (read
forced trade), living animals have to endure long, stressful journeys
from one end of Europe to the other, with death the inevitable outcome.
Recently 300 out of a consignment of 400 sheep sent from the UK to
Greece died on the journey.
We must end the insane cruelty whereby British sheep can be sent for
slaughter to Spain while Spanish sheep arrive, sometimes in pitiful
condition, to be killed here. The animals' suffering must no longer be
seen as a matter of no importance compared with farmers' and dealers'
profits.
Some of the taxpayers' money given to some farmers for doing nothing
(set-aside) should be channelled instead into improving animal welfare
throughout the EU.
It could also be used to bring smaller British slaughterhouses up to
the EU standard (cynically ignored in some European countries) that is
forcing the closure of many, and increased journey times for animals
going for slaughter.
The NFU and SNFU must, if they want to keep public support, bluntly
tell their members to start moving fast towards a carcase-only trade.
Then British meat can be sold abroad as genuinely home-killed.

FOR some years I have been waging a one-man campaign to have the Scots
poems and songs of Robert Burns spoken or sung in Scots.
In all that time I have not been able to get one member of the
academic world or entertainment world to comply. Even to get them to
pronounce ''Scots wha hae'' or ''Ae fond kiss'' (Scoats whaw hae and Yay
foand kiss) would have been looked on as a great success.
I have done my homework, which is more than I can say for the
performers whether academics or entertainers.
Between about 1910 and 1930 a great deal of research into Burns
dialect was carried out, much of it at the instigation of the Vernacular
Circle of the Burns Club in London. This research confirms that I am
correct.
Professor W A Craigie was a major instigator. He supports my
pronunciation.
Professor Main Dixon and William Grant produced their Manual of Modern
Scots which says I am correct. William Grant became editor of the
Scottish National Dictionary.
The later editor, David Murison, also confirms that my pronunciation
is correct. The definitive work on Burns dialect is that of Sir James
Wilson who shows that I am correct.
Of late we have had a plethora of performances of Burns's minutiae
coupled with a paucity of performances of Burns's dialect. To me, this
is Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.
The only reason I can think of is that somewhere between my generation
and today the whole language has been lost to such an extent that modern
performers are so ignorant they do not even know they are ignorant. What
a sad state of affairs!
With the approach of 1996 and the many celebrations of the bicentenary
of the Bard's death, I wish to make a heartfelt plea. Would The Herald
throw its considerable weight behind my renewed campaign to have Burns's
dialect poems and songs performed in Burns's dialect?

THE Government has a desperate wish to remain a member of the
exclusive nuclear club. It also wishes to avoid the political
embarrassment of admitting that it has purchased a #10billion weapons'
system for which there is no longer a credible purpose. The collapse of
the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War removed the only valid
strategic justification for the deployment of four Vanguard-class
Trident nuclear missile submarines with a combined potential for the
delivery of more than 500 atomic warheads.
Under Cold War planning, most of these would have rained down on or
around Moscow and its airfields and command bunkers. But the absence of
a readily identifiable alternative enemy is only one of a number of
problems now besetting Whitehall.
The five-member ''official'' clique of nuclear powers -- the United
States, Britain, France, China, and Russia -- are united in a single
common goal. That is the maintenance of atomic hegemony. It is a goal
which must sit badly with the publicly stated aim of reducing and
finally eliminating nuclear weapons. Within that clique, however, there
are many divisions. A fragmented, economically bankrupt Russia makes for
poor stewardship of the ultimate arsenal. The United States would dearly
love total control of production and deployment of all fission weaponry
worldwide. It already exercises a high level of nuclear primacy where
the United Kingdom is concerned. Britain's missiles and their guidance
systems are US-designed and built. The Royal Navy depends on American
goodwill for their maintenance and availability. In the unthinkable
scenario of a unilateral British launch against a third nation, US
satellites would be vital for mid-course correction of targeting
information. In effect, there is not and never has been an independent
British nuclear deterrent, although growing cooperation with the French
might overcome at least part of the satellite requirement if the two
found strategic common ground.
The ''black magicians'' of the Defence Ministry who try to set out
global military probabilities for the UK's government of the day work
two decades in advance, sifting international currents for potential
threats, and the means to meet them. Trident was born in the 1980s as
the solution for the 90s and beyond, predicated on the continued
existence of the Soviets. The Royal Navy is now trying to rationalise
use of a system which has consumed up to 20% of the total defence budget
and will continue to eat up hefty chunks of a diminishing financial cake
for the next 20 years.
While public credibility is important, there is no peace dividend for
the Government in cash terms. The money has been spent; there are no
refunds. But Trident, despite increasing US pressure for disarmament,
retains a unique kudos in that it grants Britain a seat at the highest
international councils by dint of the military power it can no longer
afford to project by conventional means. That is why Britain will
prevaricate at the current meeting on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and push
for an indefinite extension of its right to bear nuclear arms.

TURKISH police today detained two Britons and two Turks who allegedly
attempted to defraud a public Turkish bank of $416m (#260m).
Police said that the men had used US-based securities, which were
believed to have been obtained illegally through the Nigerian central
bank, to submit to the Turkiye Halk Bankasi in Ankara as guarantee to
get a $400m loan.
Ankara police have asked Interpol to help investigate the suspects'
alleged connection with the Nigerian central bank.
Police officials identified the British men as Mr Robert Kevin Forster
and Mr Peter Howard Farmer, and the Turks as Mehmet Yavuz Bayramoglu and
Muammer Turan.
Two other members of the gang vanished after they learned that
officers had uncovered the fraud.
One of the two still at large forged signatures of Halk Bankasi
personnel in the bank's Polatli branch near Ankara and produced false
documents to transfer $16m (#10m) from a branch of the Britain's
Barclays Bank, they said.
The scam was blown when Barclays Bank became suspicious of the
signatures, they added.--Reuter

THE largest science festival on earth has come to an end, so quietly
that some of us may not have noticed. Science tends to be a low-key
subject and gatherings of its devotees don't normally hit the headlines.
But here on our doorstep has been the seventh Edinburgh International
Science Festival, which bills itself with pardonable chutzpah as the
biggest event of its kind in the world. This year's festival suffered a
small drop in attendance, the direct result of curtailed funding. But
the programme was stimulating and varied, ranging from learned
discussions to pleasurable hands-on experiments for the young and the
scientifically challenged. It is still a fledgling festival compared to
its glitzy neighbours on the cultural front, the Edinburgh Festival and
the Fringe, and it struggles to survive on a shoestring. But it deserves
to flourish and it merits sustained financial support as part of an
elightened approach to the popularisation and dissemination of
scientific knowledge.
The gap between scientific achievement and public appreciation can be
bridged and the Edinburgh Science Festival plays a useful part in this
process. The barriers are coming down. A recent television series
tackled some of the fundamental questions of the universe in an
accessible and attractive way. Underpinning that series were the ideas
of Stephen Hawking, who in spite of crippling physical disabilities has
coupled scientific rigour with a determination to help the lay person
understand the fundamentals of his difficult subject. His books are best
sellers. What Hawking has done for the origin of the universe, Richard
Dawkins has matched in his popular works on the origin and evolution of
life. And there are writers such as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C Clarke,
both equally at home in fact and fiction, both ardent apostles of
science for the common man and woman.
Questions of life, the world, and its environment, and our place in
the universe often seem beyond our grasp. But there are many points
where the most abstract research yields practical results, impinging
directly on the way we live and think. A prime example is the discovery
and analysis of the genetic code DNA and the way in which it has entered
our everyday thought and speech. The spin-off from scientific and
technological advance may touch our lives in unsuspected ways.
Who would have thought that subsidy fraud by European farmers could be
unmasked by the all-seeing eye of a space satellite? This is just one of
the capabilities of a European satellite scheduled to be launched this
week. One of its more significant functions is to record precisely the
state of the earth's protective shield against cancer-causing radiation.
This is where scientific research touches us most closely. Science is
not something arcane practised by men and women in white coats in
laboratories shut off from the everyday world. It affects us all, and
the more at home we are with it the better.

THERE are questions to be asked concerning the vexed subject of live
calves in transit.
When Lord Justice Simon Brown, unequivocally condemning the port
authorities for banning the trade, reduced the case to ''the rule of
law'' against ''mob rule'', did he feel no sympathy at all for genuine
peaceful protesters, for whom it is a matter of conscience?
Do farmers who persist in the trade feel not the faintest scruples?
Are their dreams never haunted by the pitiful plight of one of their
struggling, crated calves?
What is the extent of the ''ruin'' facing breeders if the export of
live calves were banned? How did they survive before? Or was this going
on long ago without our knowledge?
I saw it suggested that the calves kept in crates for weeks were at
least lucky to be alive rather than having been slaughtered at birth. If
the calf were capable of holding an opinion, would that really be its
choice?
Prestwick Airport authorities, after sounding public opinion, agreed
to ban exports from the airport. If they were prepared to forgo a deal
which no doubt would have brought them profit, they must have judged
that it was wrong.
It is unfortunate that unruly elements have latched on to the protest
and given it a bad name. I still believe the protest to be morally
justified and trust that people engaged in this cruel trade will think
again.

MARY Morris, founder of Scottish National Ballet and the Mary Morris
Movement, saw life through kaleidoscope lenses.
Eastwood writer Pat Gerber's skilful monologue brought a neglected if
self-centred, talent into the limelight at Giffnock Library last night.
The one-hour reprise of the life of Glasgow-based dancer, painter,
writer whose art and exercise movement spanned six decades, was part of
Eastwood's Artfest.
Morris was partner to Scottish artist J D Ferguson but ''a mover'' in
her own right, rivalling the more famous Isadora Duncan. The play was
the reminiscences of a 70-year-old, now part of actress Pene
Herman-Smith's repertoire.
Name dropping was impressive. Morris played a part in the life of
everyone from John Galsworthy to Gielgud who made his debut at
nine-years-old in one of her salons.
Unkindly, it was difficult to cast out the shadow of one of Just
William's arty ladies and may well have been the basis of this
character. For all that, Morris was hugely influential in the
development of dance. She was undoubtedly part of the revolutionary
womanhood that pervaded the twenties and thirties and a tribute to Pat
Gerber's skill that it comes across in this Home Is Where The Art Is
production.
Born of Welsh-Irish parents in 1891, Morris was conducting classes in
Glasgow up until her death in 1980. And one former pupil had drifted in
to cast an eye over the life of the stern disciplinarian who devoted her
time to her art rather than family. She certainly influenced other
people's children.

TOWERING over Thornliebank's Main Street stands the church of St
Vincent de Paul. Inside, not a vaulted arch in sight. Instead, an airy,
elegant interior, all cool classical lines with a newly re-ordered
sanctuary and a superb acoustic to match. This was the framework for
last night's outstanding concert by Cappella Nova, given as part of
Eastwood's week-long Artsfest.
And the group couldn't have asked for a more appropriate opening as
they stood on the altar, bathed in the late rays of the sun which
streamed through the stained glass Rosary window. (Okay, okay, I know
it's a bit romantic, but it was striking to the eye.)
Just as striking -- to the ear -- was the cleverly devised programme
through which Alan Tavener steered his choir. Ranging from the sacred to
the secular, it celebrated Easter and spring. Not only was it
well-shaped overall, but there was a delicious progression within. The
first half moved from the austerity of the opening motet by Robert
Johnson, through the immaculately sculpted, seamlessly fluid four-part
Mass by William Byrd, to the same composer's exultant Haec Dies.
Beautiful singing throughout, especially in the Byrd Mass, with a
gradual shift from the soft, luminous singing of the Kyrie to the
exultant ascent of the voices at the climax of the Credo.
In the second half, the group shifted to more earthly delights,
uncovering at least one absolute gem of a piece in Vaughan Williams's
Springtime of the Year, introduced by lovely, sonorous humming and, in a
short space, displaying the full expressive and dynamic range of the
choir. Britten's Choral Dances were dazzling, and the folk songs a
charm. An exquisite night.

Kibeho, Tuesday
EIGHT people were killed today when gunfire triggered a stampede at a
Rwandan refugee camp and sent 100,000 people fleeing.
Government troops firing into the air around a camp in South-western
Rwanda sent terrified occupants rushing in panic.
UN special envoy Shaharyar Khan said that the eight were crushed to
death when tens of thousands of refugees stampeded at Kibeho camp.
''There was no violence directed towards the refugees. There was no
search of the camp. The Rwanda Patriotic Army said they did not intend
any harm to the people in the camp, but they wanted them to go home,''
he said.
UN officials had believed the troops of the Tutsi-dominated RPA had
staged a ''cordon and search'' operation of Kibeho camp which holds an
estimated 120,000 people.
However they later established the soldiers cordoned off the camp and
fired in the air, but did not go in and search.
A witness who flew over the camp estimated 100,000 people were
swarming with their meagre possessions up a hill in an effort to seek
sanctuary near a church.
He said that one in every five huts was destroyed by fire or in
pieces. Fleeing residents wrapped possessions in blue UN plastic
sheeting torn from the roofs.
Two plumes of smoke rose from the camp while a patrol of Zambian UN
blue-berets picked their way through the debris.
Rwandan army chief of staff Colonel Sam Kaka later flew to Kibeho and
told the people clustered on the hill that they would be given food and
shelter -- but none moved.
Hundreds of thousands of displaced people in Rwanda and some two
million refugees abroad are members of the Hutu majority who fled during
genocide and civil war a year ago.
Most say they cannot go home, despite government demands for them to
do so, because they fear attacks in revenge for the killing of up to a
million Tutsis in the war.
The refugees include former Hutu militiamen who carried out the mass
slaughter across Rwanda.
A UN official said today's army operation represented ''strong-arm
tactics by the RPA to force the refugees to go home'' against their
will.--Reuter

NICKY (Harold Finley) is a 27-year-old New York queen who is such a
perfectionist he ''could have grown up in Joan Crawford's house and not
even been slapped''. Adapted from William Barber's novel by Neil Wallace
this play bristles with terrific one-liners -- ''opera is just camp from
the past'' -- as Nicky quips and quivers his way through a year of
fashion, fun and stab-in-the-back style friendship, with lots of
Oscar-worthy histrionics en route.
Luc Georges's design sets the monologue against a massive painted
backdrop of a day-glo New York, dominated more by a big pink triangle
than by the Statue of Liberty. The dame that counts round here is Nicky,
whose petulant pouts and sultry sulks put every other diva in the shade.
Silk banners are unfurled in synchronicity on either side of the
stage, marking the changing seasons as Nicky passes through phases of
fashion obsession, showbiz ambitions and ruinous relationships, donning
various outlandish outfits and sporting an outrageous pair of
scissor-shaped specs.
Wallace could have done with taking the scissors to some of the
script, which, while consistently bitchily amusing, is too lengthy for a
one-man-show. Finley has both the talent and energy to sustain the
demands of over two hours of performance but the format is too wearying.
Finley's face is in constant animation and he makes an entertaining
raconteur but the events he describes -- even a sleazy murder -- are too
humdrum to provide sufficient dramatic scope. The show has more froth
than a cappuccino machine and Nicky's delight in the trivial might
induce wry smiles but is not that infectious.
However, a change of mood in the final sequence which deals with Aids
briskly but with dignity brings a much-needed darker tone and allows
Finley the chance to hint at hidden depths beneath Nicky's brazenly
superficial demeanour.

LAVINIA GIBBS makes a fair point (April 11). However, the Gibb family
are feudal superiors of much of north-west Arran. In this capacity they
recently demanded #800 from that most rare of species, a Scots craft
worker, to convert the use of a garden shed on land which he owns to a
craftshop.
Additionally the Gibbs decreed that the craft business could not
advertise itself nor sell goods from the craftshop. This was after the
democratic process had awarded planning permission.
Lavinia Gibbs ponders on better ways of spending much public money. I
suggest the funding of an independent land commission which, if natural
justice was upheld, would surely end the ridiculous and iniquitous
feudal system.
We Scots are from an ancient Celtic society that believed in the
community ownership of all land. The concept of absolute ownership is
alien to us and has no place in Scotland today.

Bujumbura, Tuesday
HUTU gunmen killed two soldiers in North-east Burundi today in an
assault on an army post in which five attackers also died. Police said
that the gunmen, armed with automatic weapons, attacked the post at
Gasorwe village earlier this morning.
The gunman were presumed to be Hutu guerrillas stepping up their
hit-and-run operations against the mainly Tutsi army. State-run Burundi
radio said that the two soldiers and five of the attackers were killed
and eight people were wounded including a soldier seriously hurt. It
said that the gunmen were of Rwandan origin.
A police spokesman said they had been spotted yesterday near the
Tanzanian border and had earlier ambushed a truck carrying troops. The
number of casualties from that attack was still unknown.
Gasorwe, 125 miles north-east of the capital Bujumbura, was the scene
of a massacre of hundreds of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers and
civilians in late March, according to the US ambassador, aid workers and
survivors. The army denied any slaughter had occurred.
In another incident, a mine exploded today in the Doyen Hotel in the
heart of the capital Bujumbura, destroying two rooms on the first floor
but causing no casualties, witnesses said. As in neighbouring Rwanda,
Burundi has a big majority of Hutus. However, in Burundi the Tutsis
dominate the army and civil service.--Reuter

PROFESSOR Fred Edwards's plea for a fairer redistribution of
Scotland's wealth, along with his warning of the possibility of the
development of an underclass (April 15), could not come at a more
appropriate time, hot on the heels of Peter Lilley's latest nightmare,
the incapacity benefits scheme.
I only hope Professor Edwards's fears were expressed in a venue where
the Government cannot pretend to have been unaware that he had expressed
them.
No street-wise individual could possibly question his fears of
escalating crime and the insecurity that this is likely to create for
the wealthy in our society.
Unfortunately, one must question whether any of the members of the
present Government or their most senior Civil Service advisers are in
the least street-wise.
And while Professor Edwards was careful to stress that ''he was not
forecasting a bloody revolution,'' I am sure that he would not write it
off as a complete impossibility if the Government were to spend two
years before the General Election in continuing with what to many
appears little more than a scorched-earth policy towards health and
social welfare.
The only disagreement which I took from Professor Edwards's reasoning
was that perhaps all my life I have been too cynical to believe that the
social policies of the UK were reached through the altruistic concerns
of right-wing governments rather than through political expediency.
It is true that in Britain we never had to suffer anything as extreme
as the French or Russian Revolutions to gain a minimum of succour for
the poorest of our society. Yet in pre-Tudor days, I question that it
was the charity of the monasteries, or the occasional benevolent feudal
lord, which helped the lot of the poorest Englishmen rather than the
after-effects of the Black Plague and changes in the labour market.
By the time Good Queen Bess introduced her Poor Laws it was only to
try to solve the problems of the bands of marauding vagabonds who were
terrorising the country.
The Union of the Crowns certainly did nothing to ease the lot of
Scotland's poor, and if it had not been for the deplorable physical
state of those poor or working-class men who were needed during the Boer
War and First World War it is doubtful if much social progress would
have been achieved by the start of this century.
The reason why I believe that revolution cannot be considered as
utterly impossible is because we are now not so much faced by a
situation where a Government is failing to provide for its needy but is
in fact intent on taking away what little they have.
Where I find myself more fearful than Fred Edwards is that I do not
believe you can systematically reduce the bulk of British society to
penury without a violent backlash.

THE political exercise of April 8 is over and the structure of local
government set for 1996 to change from that of the reform of 1974. To
those of us who were involved in the Wheatley Committee's so-called
local government reform it is a time of reminiscence.
Few of the citizens of Glasgow ever knew the effort of the struggle
required to maintain the civic dignity and proper place of the Second
City of the old Empire against the newly-born colossus known as
Strathclyde region.
Many of those elected to the region at that time assumed an arrogance
becoming to their self-considered upper-league status. They did not
appreciate that, in view of the region's geographical area and civic
divorcement from local issues, in time, apart from education, they
should become ghost-like whilst the district councillor remained,
through housing and cleansing in particular, along with licensing
boards, parks, and libraries, the public's constant companion.
At the time when the creation of the region was being proposed, the
then Glasgow Corporation relevant committee selected to monitor any
reform of local government (which I chaired and led to the Commons and
the Lords) suggested that it was an ill-conceived idea doomed to fail
and an economic albatross on the necks of our city ratepayers.
They had financed the services enjoyed by many from the surrounding
areas who delighted to use the city but had chosen to sleep elsewhere.
The Glasgow citizen is unkindly portrayed by otherwise unemployable
theatricals in a most unflattering caricature -- this for their selfish
gain, with no realisation of the name of the city and the decent vast
majority's detriment.
Small wonder, then, at the early stages before reform, that our
Glasgow deputation to preserve the city's power did not merely waste
time and effort in London but wept to observe in Commons and Lords those
who had once been citizens, later elected to serve in non-Glasgow seats
or appointed to the peerage, move against our view.
Still, it has come to pass that either for good economic reasons (as
the corporation argued) or as a Government side-show to divert the
nation's opinion of growing political impatience -- it matters little --
the tide has now come in with good opportunity.
What a legacy has been left for 1995 of expensive failure of long ago.
Money spent, much lost, new buildings built, old buildings fabulously
furnished and taken over, and the tragedy of officials and employees who
now may be uprooted or, worse, encouraged to take voluntary redundancy
or be paid off.
Sometimes the ratepayers were critical of the region's services, and
more often of the new bureaucracy in its seeming remoteness which was
patronising or dismissive.
Still, that is set to change, or so it is hoped. Glasgow by the
election takes back lost power to some extent. The city is almost a
one-party local authority. Whether right, left, or centre in a political
dogma the situation is dangerous.
Therefore, while Labour's victory is, as many of us believe, good for
the city, the annihilation of the opposition is a disaster for
democracy.
Human nature requires constant encouragement for effort and to act in
responsibility when constructively criticised. Politicians require their
critics to prompt them to act with energy and to accomplish.
It will be no service to Glasgow ratepayers if the critics come from
internal party opposition, leading to ''party civil war''. Such conduct
might be acceptable to those elected but will be little tolerated and
considered detrimental by the ratepaying public.
Glasgow has seen many changes in her 1200 years. She can make changes
or, better still, adapt change to her advantage, for the man in the
streets of Glasgow is no innocent abroad.
Still, it was a day to remember, with a feeling of Glasgow pride that
the city is to be sole mistress of local affairs. One hopes the coat of
arms fought for at the Lyon Court in 1974 to retain old St Mungo is
still to be the city symbol. We still need that old monk's prayers. He
must for all seasons be preferred to that pathetic Jaffa orange.

FRESH from their Easter holidays, City analysts gave the thumbs-up to
the possible merger of drugs groups Fisons and Medeva.
On Monday, Medeva revealed that it was considering a merger with
Fisons worth more than #900m.
City analysts believe that a merger between the restructured Fisons
and its smaller rival Medeva would make sense for both companies,
offering both a good geographical fit and substantial synergies in
respiratory medicine.
Fisons does around a third of its pharmaceutical business in Europe, a
market which Medeva has found more difficult.
Medeva has a strong presence in the respiratory field through its
Adams Laboratories subsidiary in the US. Fisons produces the asthma
drugs Intal and Tilade. Both companies have advanced technology in
delivery products for their drugs such as metered dose inhalers.
The #3 per share that industry sources believe that Medeva wants for a
recommended offer by Fisons is seen viewed as fair in the City given
that it would put Medeva on 18 times propsective earnings, a figure not
out of line with other deals that have taken place in the sector in
recent times.
Medeva is expected to increase its earnings per share from 14.6p to
16.9p during the current year.
Given that 40% of Medeva's stock is held by US investors as American
Depository Receipts (ADRs), analysts believe that Fisons may have to
launch an all-cash bid for Medeva. Assuming a price of #900m, such a
deal would leave Fisons with net debt of around #400m and interest
charges of around #30m a year. However, it could add 5% to Fisons'
earnings in 1996.
Medeva has benefited from the rationalisation and period of change
which is sweeping through the pharmaceutical industry in Europe and the
US, after almost half-a-century of vigorous growth and little structural
change.
Drug companies have responded to the more cost-conscious trading
environment in a variety of ways. There has been vertical integration
such as that seen at SmithKline Beecham, horizontal integration a la
Glaxo/Wellcome, the formation of alliances and diversification into the
over-the-counter non-prescription market which can prolong the
profitable shelf life of drugs that have gone off patent.
Since its formation in 1990 Medeva has grown by acquiring new products
and businesses, many of which have been divested by larger groups
looking to concentrate their resources on core activities. If combined
with Fisons it would have greater clout in negotiating with drug firms
looking to license out products.
News of the merger talks marks a significant turnaround in the
fortunes of Fisons, largely since the arrival of Stuart Wallis from
Bowater in the chief executive's chair. Fisons has itself been a
perennial bid target given its steady stream of operational and
management difficulties in recent years.
The recent clear-out of under-performing businesses such as its
scientific instruments division was thought to make Fisons even more
attractive to a potential predator.
Yesterday Fisons shares were 4p cheaper at 174p, while Medeva jumped
31p to 257[1/2]p.

Geneva, Tuesday
AT least 62 people, mostly women and children, were hacked to death in
Liberia last week in the latest of a series of reported massacres in the
West African state, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said today.
A UNICEF spokesman said it was not known who was responible for the
massacre, which occurred on April 9 in the small town of Yosi, near
Buchanan.
The area is controlled by the National Patriotic Front of Liberia and
claimed by a smaller militia group, the Liberian Peace Council.
UNICEF spokesman Damien Personnaz said the attackers surrounded a
group of around 200 people in Yosi.
''They were encircled by fighters -- we're still not clear on their
identity -- and they were told they would be killed with machetes and
that's what happened,'' Personnaz told reporters.
No UN personnel had been able to visit the town and the information
had been pieced together from the testimony of survivors who had been
treated in Buchanan, Liberia's second city.
He said 10 survivors reached Buchanan last Wednesday and received
treatment. They included a two-month old baby with a cut head and a
young pregnant woman who was probably raped and later miscarried.

AT last it can be told. Anyone in Perth and Kinross wondering if they
will ever be allowed to vote for an MP again can thank the soaraway
Sunday Times Scotland for explaining just why Ian Lang decided to
postpone their by-election.
''It was a grand and noble gesture,'' said a sage editorial at the
weekend, ''to defer to local issues on April 6 . . .'' Ah indeed, so now
we know.
Left to his own devices, the Scottish Secretary would have behaved
like the democrat he is and instructed his candidate to lose hands down
at the earliest opportunity. Nobly, however, he realised that the people
calling themselves Tories at the local elections were entirely different
from the other sort and must be given the chance to be slaughtered for
having absolutely nothing to do with the Tories (no relation) who run
the country. Blue rosettes can be so misleading.
The ST(S) also decreed: ''It can no longer be acceptable to attempt to
force Scottish public opinion to act against its will.'' Now why didn't
they mention that 16 years ago?
Walk tall
EVERY good charity needs a slogan, and the Cancer Research Campaign,
against which we will hear not a word, is no exception. The other week
it ran a series of job advertisements under the unexceptional rubric
''Corporate fundraising opportunities''. Below came the slogan: ''Pick
it up and run with it''.
Lassie come home
THE course of true love is rough, but some people deserve all they
get.
Thus, the lonely hearts column of the Guardian recently contained the
following terms of endearment: ''WEST YORKS LAD, 32, full of usual crap,
seeks lass''. Heartwarming, no? The same column also contained a forlorn
message whose appeal, we judge, may be equally limited: ''PACIFIST
CHRISTIAN ANARCHIST, 38, interested in the arts, currently locked up,
seeks female penfriend''. They're still locking up Christians, then?
Day to remember
WE have as much time for holidays as the next diarist just back from
swanning around Barcelona. Take as many as you can get, is our motto,
and as often. What we'd like to know, therefore, is when, if at all,
we'll get our day off to celebrate the anniversary of VE Day.
England and Wales, having abandoned May Day as an incitement to people
who refuse to vote on local issues, will party on May 8. In Scotland,
however, there seems to be some confusion. The best we can gather is
that the holiday is still classified as ''optional''.
Does this mean there is some doubt over who won?
French lessons
PUTTING your foot in it: the Press Association reports that the
saintly Eric Cantona has embarked on the spell of community service he
incurred for taking his boot to a fan. ''Cantona kicks off coaching
session for kids'', says the headline.
Not to be outdone, an Edinburgh freesheet provides advance information
on a martial arts seminar. That, too, ''kicks off tomorrow''.
Chew it over
THE really bad news is that, even as we gag, Forrest Gump
''commemorative'' boxes of chocolates are on sale in the States. The
less truly awful news is that the wizened comic book artist R Crumb has
also put out his own candy bar to mark the appearance of a documentary
on his work.
Entitled R Crumb's Devil Girl Choco-Bar, the confection makes no
concessions to health or taste. On the bar's wrapper, Crumb promises
''Seven Evils in One!'', each of which we have seen fit to share with
all of you still guzzling improbably large Easter eggs.
''1) Delicious taste; 2) Quick cheap buzz; 3) Bad for your health; 4)
leads to hard drugs; 5) Waste of money; 6) Made by sleazy businessmen;
7) Exploits women.''
We have no news, as yet, on whether a Devil Girl Choco-Bar will help
you work, rest, or play.
Time will tell
STILL in the land of the free, we bring hope for those among you who,
for no sane or logical reason, have thus far failed to win a fortune on
the National Lottery and commenced to tell the bank manager precisely
where he can lodge his credit agreement.
The tale is of a young man named Michael Marcum. Michael was arrested
a couple of months ago in Stanberry, Missouri, for the theft of six
350-pound power company transformers. Pressed by the prosecution, he
eventually admitted he needed the equipment urgently for a machine he
was building -- a, if it please the court, time machine.
Marcum's plan, had he got away with it, was to transport himself a few
days into the future, find out the winning lottery numbers, and return
to buy a ticket. For some reason, he was not readily believed.
Believed, but only just, was the convict in New Brunswick, Canada, who
late last year had 15 days added to his sentence after an escape
attempt. Donald Snow had just nipped out to a local convenience store to
buy a lottery ticket. Incredibly, the authorities couldn't see his point
of view.
Pecking order
WE were intrigued at the weekend to read Allan Laing's preview of
BBC2's adaptation of Jane Austen's dull but worthy Persuasion. As Allan
noted, the TV version ends with Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth
engaged in a kiss which, unaccountably, Austen forgot to mention.
The scene was included, it seems, at the insistence of the US
producers helping to pay the BBC's bills. Elsewhere, we learned that one
of the said Americans had described the clinch as an ''obvious emotional
pay-off''. See that Jane Austen? Hadn't a clue.
But we wonder. How many other classics could do with exposure to the
aesthetic imperatives of modern international co-production? With that
in mind we offer: Waiting for Godot: Stan Godot arrives early in Act I,
says he's really sorry about the mix-up but, hey, guys, there's a party
over at his place. Ulysses: Molly Bloom has an early night with a good
book. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde: the doctor swears off the Buckfast on page
52. Romeo and Juliet: the kids do a bunk and wind up on a Club Med
holiday.
Join us next week for another exciting episode.

Tokyo, Tuesday
A BRITISH ship carrying 14 tonnes of high-level nuclear waste will
arrive at a northern Japanese port next Tuesday, completing a
controversial two-month voyage from France opposed by 30 countries.
In an announcement today which broke a news blackout about the
shipment, the Japanese Government said the Pacific Pintail would dock in
the northern port of Mutsu-Ogawara on April 25.
The 14 tonnes of hot, liquid nuclear waste, a by-product of Japan's
spent nuclear fuel reprocessed at a French plant, will be stored at a
special cooling facility in the small village of Rokkasho, on the
Pacific coast near the northern tip of Japan's main Honshu island. It is
near one of Japan's most earthquake-prone regions. Japan has no
reprocessing plant of its own.
Secrecy about the ship's journey was nullified by the conservationist
group Greenpeace, whose own boat shadowed the Pacific Pintail (above).
As many as 30 countries said they were opposed to the ship steaming
through their 200-mile exclusive economic zones.
Four of them -- Spain, Portugal, Brazil, and Chile -- dispatched
warships to make sure the Pacific Pintail did not enter their waters,
Greenpeace claimed.--Reuter

MY constituents are noted for a practical streak which extends to
their sense of humour. Detractors might suggest that facing life with a
smile is a prerequisite for survival in our wild and windy corner of
Scotland.
Even the early Christians hesitated to tread in the rougher country of
the North-east and this explains why it was Buchan which hosted the
twilight of Druidic worship up until at least the seventh century.
It should be said that Buchan people have more than made up for lost
time in their present enthusiasm for a large variety of Christian
denominations both large and small.
A mere two centuries after the saints came marching into Buchan the
monks at the Celtic Abbey of Deer wrote and illustrated a remarkable
gospel book containing the whole of St John and parts of Matthew, Mark,
and Luke.
These were written in Latin but the introduction in Old Gaelic is
memorable in itself. It reads: ''May it be on the conscience of everyone
with whom this splendid little book shall be that he should give his
blessing on the soul of the poor wretch who has written it.''
Even the dark ages in central Buchan were lightened with a twinkle of
humour. However it was the practical side of the North-east which came
to the fore after a further two centuries when the monks used the blank
spaces of the book to set down the title to the Abbey's landholdings in
Buchan -- waste not want not. These notes were written in Common Gaelic
(ie, common to Scotland and Ireland), this being the language spoken
over most of Scotland, including Buchan, in the twelfth century.
They were almost certainly a response to the growing Norman influence
in Scotland and the pressing requirement to codify legal title and
exemption from lay service and taxation.
The book, the introduction, and the later Gaelic notes all constitute
a key part of the precious and rare written history of Celtic Scotland
but are currently housed in the Cambridge University library.
The Book of Deer was given to Cambridge as part of an
eighteenth-century bequest although it then lay undiscovered for the
best part of 150 years. How it was removed from Deer in the first place
is shrouded in mystery but, in common with many important Scottish
relics, it was probably pillaged during the less successful years of the
Wars of Independence.
If that is the case then the Book of Deer is rather like the Stone of
Scone which has not been officially returned despite an international
treaty requiring its surrender.
However, the Book of Deer was lost to Scotland and my strong feeling
is that it should now come back to Deer and that children from the
North-east share the chance to see it as part of their living heritage.
If that is not possible then the furthest it should be from home is the
university library of Aberdeen not of Cambridge.
For much the same reasons I think that the Glasgow Museums should now
offer the Sioux back their Ghost Shirt. From press reports it seems that
our museum officials were pretty reasonable with our native American
visitors and I can appreciate their point of concern about the fate of
other exhibits.
However, the principle at issue is a question of who has prior claim.
It seems that the garment was taken from the body of the member of the
Lakota Sioux after the US Army slaughtered more than 200 men, women, and
children at Wounded Knee in December 1890.
There seems little doubt therefore that the significance of this relic
must be infinitely greater to the native Americans than it could
possibly be to the natives of Scotland.
I suggest with a generosity of spirit with which St Mungo would
approve that the Kelvingrove Museum should henceforth display a replica
of the Ghost Shirt perhaps with an inscription saying that the original
has been returned to its rightful owners by the people of Glasgow.
I don't know if Mungo gets a mention in the Book of Deer. I rather
think that Columba and Drostan were the main men for the monks of the
North-east. However, if we learn to respect the rights of other peoples
we could build the self-respect which is a prerequisite for being
comfortable with demanding our own national rights.
Scotland should now give the Sioux their due and then claim back what
is rightfully ours.

WHY is the West of Scotland so sleazy? These folk customs seem to go
back a long way. If we look only at the last half century, we find that
the wartime Secretary of State, Tom Johnston, was so horrified at what
he found slithering in the recesses of Glasgow City Chambers that he
threatened to suspend the council and send in special commissioners to
run the place.
During the 1970s, outrageous fiddles in housing allocation helped,
miracle of miracles, to rob Labour of control in one of the district
elections. The 1990s have already revealed a can of worms in Monklands.
Now an even nastier smell rises from Renfrew, and from the allegation
that a publicly subsidised company is a front for traffic in drugs.
All this may be just a chapter of accidents, which ought not to sully
the image of a great conurbation with its dynamic popular culture,
stirring proletarian history, etc. Still sleaze is such a hardy
perennial on the banks of the Clyde that perhaps we should rather speak
of a tradition, and ask what has made it grow.
A range of social and economic factors has no doubt contributed. But a
political one of special interest is that the West of Scotland has long
been akin to a one-party state. Regardless of which party runs any such
state, it is a bad thing. Where maintained by coercion, as in the former
Communist bloc and in Africa, it has caused not just the corruption of
the party but the collapse of society.
To strain the analogy, ill-effects have been obvious even in Britain
where a Conservative Government has usually been faced since 1970 with
an opposition to all intents and purposes unelectable. As a result the
Tory Party is, heaven knows, no paragon of virtue just now. Years of
easier power have softened its sinews, its brains, and its morals.
The same happens to any party staying in office too long. Yet while we
can readily see the Conservatives being thrown out at the polls next
time, it is hard to discern what might loosen Labour's grip in the West
of Scotland. If anything, the grip has been tightening. And
unfortunately, the forces of the left are more prone to the evils of a
one-party system.
This is because they want to extend the power of the state. Of course,
they often set about it with the best of intentions. People of high
integrity have genuinely believed socialism was the way to human
happiness, have espoused it, and selflessly worked for it on those
grounds. But lofty ideals and immaculate virtue, while desirable, are
not themselves the guarantee that all will be well.
Let me take the example of the sainted John Smith, a fine man whom I
knew and admired myself. I still find it hard to believe he had no
inkling at all of the peccadillos in Monklands District Council. No
doubt, had he chosen, he might have waded in there, banged some heads
together, bumped a few of the shiftier operators and cleaned the whole
act up. But nobody can do everything: the time and talents of Labour's
leader were obviously better devoted to making his party capable of
running the country again than to mucky parochial in-fighting.
So unavoidably, much of the day-to-day business of politics has to be
turned over to those more calculating in their motives and less austere
in their rectitude. Just look at the way Labour has built its stronghold
in the West of Scotland. It always helped to have a Labour Government in
London, though during the long era of Keynesian Consensus that did not
matter too much. The local authorities were anyway armed with every
power they wanted.
They started with housing, and in the erection of vast schemes
constructed electoral blocs where votes were bought with cheap rents.
Burgeoning public services, with the officials and workers to man them,
created another huge clientele.
Groups like teachers, who had once thought of themselves as bourgeois,
were drawn into the net. In a region of industrial decline, many thought
their livelihood depended on subsidies -- and which party was going to
provide the biggest subsidies?
We do not have to damn this entire gamut of policy as cynical. On the
contrary, much of it met a need, by means that seemed sound enough at
the time, even if hindsight tells a different story. The net result was
at any rate to wrap up the West of Scotland for the Labour Party, to put
it there in an unassailable position.
Such a sprawling edifice has to come under the detailed control of
machine-men, who assess the competing claims on them, who decide what is
right, sometimes indeed for the public, but inevitably sometimes for the
party, for its electoral advantage, or for people they like, their
relations, friends, and hangers-on. Once tempted to bend the rules with
little favours, even if at first out of the goodness of their hearts,
they soon attract a different type of customer.
Every local businessman, every contractor, every pressure group, every
faddist with an interest to press, will see where power lies, and will
flock round with their own favours to offer in return. As the rot sets
in the flymen follow, the fiddlers and the parasites: then at last, for
all we know, the drug barons.
That, in a nutshell, explains the West of Scotland's sleaze. The only
way of wiping it out is by, to coin a phrase, rolling back the power of
the state, and of its agents. There is already reason enough for
Conservatives to rue not having done so properly. The final cost to
Labour, to its ideals, and to a region it has cherished so much, could
be higher still.

FEROCIOUS competition among Scotland's house builders is ensuring that
selling prices are pared to the bone. At the same time, customers are
demanding a higher quality product, while material prices are rising and
skilled labour is scarce.
For the builders, keeping their accounts wind and watertight is made
even more difficult by the continuing shortage of development land.
These are among the main conclusions of the most comprehensive survey
ever conducted into the workings of the Scottish house building sector.
In an industry where information is scattered around like bricks on a
building site, Glasgow University's Centre for Housing Research and
Urban Studies has gathered the facts together and built a convincing
picture of an industry that is surviving against very difficult odds.
Some 160 firms in Scotland were surveyed and around 80% of them were
independent. About 15% of respondents were developers, 49% were
contractors, and the other 36% combined these two roles.
''Builders in Scotland have cut their profits to the bone; getting
work is more important than profits in the current market,'' says Ken
Gibb of Glasgow University, one of the compilers of the survey. Shortage
of land is the other big issue. Local authorities are not releasing
enough land, while such land as is released does not take account of
where the real market demand lies.
''Scotland's builders are obsessed about land release and land banking
strategies,'' says Ken Gibb. This is not too suprising. During the last
boom many builders built up large land banks at vast cost, only to see
their values evaporate when the market went into meltdown.
Barratt almost hit the financial rocks and was only put back on course
when founder Sir Lawrie Barratt came out of retirement to take the helm.
But builders who don't have their own land bank are compelled to join in
a land rush for any sites that come onto the market, and prices are
spiralling upwards.
From Aberdeen to Ayrshire, development is being held back because of a
shortage of land. The planners would like the builders to use brownfield
sites (previously industrial or derelict land), but cleaning and
preparing such sites can be very expensive and there is no agreement yet
as to who should pay for reclamation.
Greenfield sites are more popular with the builders (and buyers) but
planners often demand that builders contribute some form of ''planning
gain'' by paying for an underpass, playground, or other item on the
local authority's shopping list - even if it is not directly associated
with the proposed housing development.
Planning gain can provide civic amenities at no charge to the council
tax-payers, but somebody has to pay - and the buyer of the house will
usually find that the bill is added to the price tag for their new home.
The Glasgow University survey reveals that more than two-thirds of
builders use a landbank to supply their site needs, a further 20% buy
land as they need it, and 14% act solely according to contract.
The shortage of development land is pushing up the price of sites,
especially if they come with planning consent. ''Assuming the green belt
policy does not significantly change, decontamination may well be the
issue of the last half of the decade,'' says Ken Gibb.
Price competition is the other key challenge faced by Scotland's
builders. To find buyers, houses have to be priced extremely sharply
and, on many sites, incentives such as carpet and curtains or
part-exchange schemes have to be thrown in.
The survey reveals that the lowest acceptable margin for all builders
averaged 10%. This did not vary very much by turnover or volume, but it
did vary significantly according to the type of builder. Developers
required an average 13% profit margin, while contractors could get by on
8%.
Figures like these indicate that buying a new house offers
considerable value for money. When a product comes with a 10-year
guarantee, uses the the latest materials, and includes energy-saving
features, a 13% mark-up is not excessive.
the builders accept that, in the current market, low prices backed by
incentives will continue to play a key role in achieving sales.
They also know that the customer is expecting a constant improvement
in quality, both inside and out. Virtually all new homes come with an
en-suite bathroom, an unheard-of feature only a decade ago. Double
glazing, cupboard space, good security, fully fitted kitchens and
bathrooms are an expected part of the package nowadays.
On the outside, buyers want to know about how the site will be
landscaped, and they like to see variations in roof-lines and banding in
the bricks.
Other looming problems revealed by the report include the
''Anglicisation'' of house design and the over-use of centralised
designs in the speculative market.
There is a growing skilled labour shortage. Training provision is in
steep decline and the culture of price-cutting contradicts the need for
investment in human capital. The builders expect there to be major
skills shortages over the medium term.
The report concludes with an interesting question. ''The dominant
adjective used about the state of competition is 'cut-throat','' it
states.
''Will such an environment produce the best form of  housing stock for
Scotland in the decades to come?''

Sarajevo, Tuesday
FRANCE called today for an emergency United Nations Security Council
session on Bosnia and threatened to withdraw its troops if a truce is
not extended.
Bosnia's Prime Minister said that such a withdrawal of peacekeepers
would play into the hands of the killers.
Attention has focused on the safety of UN peacekeepers in Bosnia after
two French soliders were shot dead by snipers last Friday and Saturday.
A total of 33 French peacekeepers have now been killed in former
Yugoslavia.
The latest deaths have set off a sharp debate over Bosnia in France's
presidential election campaign. ''The question of withdrawal is now
posed,'' French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said today, after an
emergency meeting on the killings with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and
Defence Minister Francois Leotard.
''The worsening of conditions in which UN forces fulfil their mission
seriously jeopardises peacekeepers' safety, as the cowardly murder of
two French soldiers showed, and risks calling this mission into
question,'' Balladur's official statement said.
He called on the Security Council to draw up new measures setting
conditions for the continued presence of 4500 French troops, the single
biggest contingent in Bosnia.
The council must ensure that the peacekeepers could fulfil their
mandate, and a fragile ceasefire between the Muslim-led government army
and the Bosnian Serbs, due to expire at the end of the month, must be
extended, the statement said.
In the Croatian town of Split, the UN special envoy to former
Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, said that if killings of peacekeepers
continued, the countries contributing troops to the UN mission in Bosnia
might have to review their participation.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said a withdrawal of
peacekeepers would reward the killers of the two Frenchmen.
''A French withdrawal would be most unfortunate because it would be
rewarding the killers and giving them exactly what they wanted,''
Silajdzic said.
The two men were shot by snipers, but a UN investigation into the
deaths has proven inconclusive. The UN has not blamed either of Bosnia's
warring parties who blame each other.
Silajdzic said that he did not understand France's threat to withdraw
if the much battered truce was not extended because ''their soldiers
were killed during a ceasefire''.
Despite the four-month truce agreement fighting has persisted in
various parts of Bosnia, particularly in the Bihac enclave in the north
west and more recently, following Bosnian army offensives, in the
North-east and centre of the country.
Bosnian Serb forces today mortar-bombed a supply route west of
Sarajevo and had shelled a suburb of the city last night.
UN spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Gary Coward said that the Bosnian
Serbs had targeted the supply route on Mount Igman with the mortars and
raked the road with small and heavy machine gunfire.
A UN flight into Sarajevo had to be aborted in mid-air today after
Bosnian Serbs objected to the presence of civilians on board and
withdrew a guarantee not to shoot at the plane.
''The Bosnian Serb liaison officer at Sarajevo airport reviewed the
(passenger) manifest, where it was plain that four civilians were on
board, and said he could not guarantee the safety of the plane,'' a UN
official said.
The plane had been in the air about 30 minutes when the UN commander
of Sarajevo airport ordered it back to Zagreb.
Serb forces object to UN planes carrying Bosnian government officials,
and have been pressing for a right of veto over who flies in and out of
Sarajevo airport. They have closed the airport for three out of the past
four weeks by shooting at the unarmed relief flights.
Some flights resumed over the weekend, carrying UN military personnel
only. UN officials said that they planned to slowly reinstitute flights
with the full range of passengers, including civilians, as in the past.
However, when US Ambassador Victor Jackovich tried to board a plane
out of the city yesterday the Bosnian Serb liaison officer objected and
the UN refused to overrule him despite US protests.
Jackovich eventually left the city using a dangerous mountain road
which comes under frequent fire from Serb gunners.
All four civilians on board Tuesday's flight were United Nations
employees and included Colum Murphy, the head of public information for
the UN in Bosnia.
The Bosnian Serbs surrendered the airport to the United Nations in
June 1992. UN officials say an operating agreement signed at the time
provides for all categories of passengers to be carried under UN
supervision.--Reuter

THAT great judicial farce, the trial of O J Simpson, has just entered
its fourth month in Los Angeles, and could well drag on another six. It
is a travesty of justice, a blustering, posturing nonsense that is
reducing the American criminal justice system to imbecility -- or,
rather, revealing that system's basic imbecility.
Now it is true that the judge, Lance Ito, it particularly inept. A
tough-minded judge -- John Sirica, for instance, who presided over the
Watergate trials here 20 years ago -- would never have put up with all
the defence's and the prosecution's posturing.
A detective was on the stand for the ninth day yesterday, endlessly
nagged with trivial and silly questions that the judge should never have
permitted.
It is also true that the defence team, a dozen or so highly skilled
lawyers, are making most of the running, dragging out the process
interminably: one of their tactics is to drive the jury to distraction
so that it will never reach a verdict.
But the heart of the matter is that the system is so deeply flawed
that it can only be saved by radical surgery. The new Republican
majority in Congress is obsessed with trivia, like the Public
Broadcasting System, or meaningless demagoguery like extending the death
penalty for murdering zoo-keepers. If it wanted to do something about
crime it should start with the judicial system.
Consider the jury, for a start. Because the First Amendment to the
Constitution permits newspapers to publish just about anything, there is
no way the courts can stop the papers discussing major cases in
excruciating detail. In Britain, we have to wait for the evidence to be
submitted in the trial to discover what the case is all about -- and
then the papers are not allowed to discuss it.
So the courts here have decided that in difficult cases the way to
ensure that they have an unbiased jury is to prevent them, physically,
from reading the papers or watching or listening to the news. So they
are sequestered.
I have yet to discover what clause in the Constitution gives the
judges the power to lock juries away for months on end: perhaps one day,
one of them will invoke the ancient principle of habeus corpus to get
out. In the meantime, locked up together with total strangers for months
together, the jurors and alternates bicker, fight, and often build up
such high levels of hostility to each other or to one side in the case
that they lose all ability to judge the evidence on its merits.
It took Mr Ito months to choose the jury. He sought 12 jurors and 12
alternates from among that small selection of people who had no
knowledge or opinion of the case. Another nonsense.
The British have improved the jury system by permitting majority
verdicts. Ten will convict, or acquit. In the United States, unanimity
is still the rule. If they had majority voting, jury selection would be
far simpler and defence teams would no longer devote so much effort to
seating a few really stupid jurors who can be relied on to misunderstand
everything and reach the wrong verdict.
Another all-American absurdity is the exclusionary rule.
Various Supreme Court decisions have instructed judges to throw out
all evidence that was not gathered according to the strictest rules. If
you drop a bag and a policeman picks it up, and finds it full of
cocaine, your lawyers will say that was an illegal search and the drug
cannot be used at trial.
Simpson's lawyers spent weeks arguing that blood found at the murder
scene, or in his house, could not be used because the police had
neglected some formality in collecting it.
What has that to do with justice? Purists say that it protects
innocent citizens against corrupt police planting evidence. They are
confusing problems and solutions. Argue that there was no blood (the
Simpson defence team tried just that, with an over-exposed photograph
that did not register red stains), but do not say that the blood is
irrelevant.
Procedure has taken over the American courts. The lawyers spend half
their time arguing over what they may say, or what evidence may be
submitted, or whether the other side is cheating -- while the jury
slumbers or simmers.
So what has this to do with the search for truth? Society invented
judges and courts to protect its members against criminals and to mete
out justice to them. In America, the criminal justice system is now a
spectator sport, like basketball, and an entertainment, like a soap
opera. If Newt Gingrich is really a revolutionary, he should start with
that.

MANY of Scotland's rural schools are getting their jotters. The spread
of the car, combined with cash-saving efforts by local authorities,
means that a way of life in the local playground is passing for too many
children.
A way of life has also passed for the rural teacher, who would once
have enjoyed a reasonable living in a schoolhouse set in pleasant
surroundings. These, too, are surplus to requirement and an increasing
number of them have found their way on to the open market.
Slater, Hogg &amp; Howison is marketing the Old Schoolhouse in Glendevon,
a substantial detached home with fishing rights in the river at the
bottom of the garden. The Schoolhouse is close to Gleneagles golf course
and has extensive views on all sides.
The accommodation includes lounge/dining area, family room, fitted
kitchen, utility room, WC, conservatory, four bedrooms. There is an
established garden.
Slater, Hogg &amp; Howison is looking for offers over #129,000.
Meanwhile, rural agents Langley-Taylor are marketing the stone-built
schoolhouse at Ferness, by Nairn, which is owned by Lord Balgonie from
Glenferness, and dates from early Victorian times, together with
adjoining buildings extending to some 1740sq ft.
The original schoolhouse possesses two reception rooms, three double
bedrooms and a kitchen as well as a bathroom and a separate garage.
Planning consent has been granted and listed building consent given for
its use either as two dwelling houses or as one single spacious
residence.
The school buildings have additional useful accommodation. A garden
surrounds the property and more land could be available by negotiation.
Offers in excess of #90,000 are invited for the property as a whole.
The schoolhouse is within 13 miles of Grantown-on-Spey, 10 miles from
Nairn, and 20 miles from Inverness Airport.

Washington, Tuesday
PRESIDENT Clinton has ruled that the great majority of government
papers should be released automatically after 25 years, including all
those of the security and intelligence agencies.
Only papers covering highly sensitive matters of national security may
remain hidden longer than that, and in each case they will require a
certificate from the head of the relevant agency that secrecy is still
required.
What is more, any paper withheld from the public will be reviewed by a
special panel whose remit will be to publish whenever possible, rather
than to keep secret.
The directors of the CIA, the National Security Agency and other
spooky institutions all opposed the new rule, which will liberate
millions of documents over the next five years. They persuaded the
president to modify somewhat the suggestions made by the National
Security Council, which wanted almost total disclosure.
But not by much. The United States has always been far more open than
most other countries. As the new directive comes into force, it will
become yet more exceptional.
It is already possible for British historians to circumvent British
rules by visiting Washington. Many of the revelations of the Philby case
and other British disasters have come from the archives here, or in
Moscow, while British secrets are still closely guarded.
Donald Maclean, the most senior of the ''Cambridge spies'', sent top
secret documents to Moscow concerning British cabinet discussions that
remain closed in London though they have been published in Moscow.
Historians' task will now be made much easier. Everything British
politicians told American ambassadors, or British intelligence agents
told their American counterparts during the 1960s will now be freely
available, and in nine years we can start reading the secrets of the
Thatcher government.
The state department succeeded in persuading the president that it
need not reveal papers that would ''reveal information that would
seriously or demonstrably impair relations between the United States and
a foreign government'', but here again the rule is that each case must
be justified to the review panel which is instructed to err on the side
of candour.

<HEADLINE>HCI looking for 100 staff Rescued private hospital to expand</HEADLINE>

THE controversial private medical centre, Health Care International at
Clydebank, is to recruit around 100 new staff in anticipation of an
increase in the number of UK and overseas patients.
The move is the first recruitment drive since the hospital was rescued
from collapse in February by the Abu Dhabi Investment Company and
promises were made to recruit 450 staff over the next two years.
In an announcement expected later today, Mr Rick Taylor, HCI's
director of business development, will say the hospital is to recruit 70
full-time staff and 20 to 30 part-time, shift, and temporary staff. The
jobs include 22 nursing posts, 22 pharmacy, radiography, and
physiotherapy posts, and 26 non-clinical jobs in the hospital and hotel
complex.
A hospital spokesman said last night the clinical posts would be
advertised throughout the UK and it was hoped that they would be filled
within two to three months.
He also told The Herald that HCI intended to expand the range of
clinical services on offer from five core areas at present to
''virtually every clinical speciality''. The hospital has a 260-bed
capacity but the spokesman would say only that currently it is operating
at less than half capacity.
The recruitment comes in anticipation of an increase this summer in
patients from overseas, particularly the Middle East, as a consequence
ADIC's connection to the emirate state, and from within the relatively
small UK private health care sector.
Mr Taylor said the hospital would also continue to treat National
Health Service patients referred to HCI by Scottish health boards
attempting to reduce their waiting lists to meet the Government's
12-month waiting-time target.
Mr Taylor said the announcement was an indication of the confidence
ADIC had in the future of the #180m complex, the high standards of care
on offer, and the professionalism and expertise of existing staff.
''We are seeing a gradual upward trend in patient numbers following
our takeover by ADIC. As well as being active in the international
market, HCI has gained accreditation by most major medical insurers and
will become more active in marketing its services to private patients in
the UK.''
However, the news was greeted with anger by Mr Jim Devine, senior
regional officer with Unison. He said the Scottish Health Minister, Lord
Fraser, needed to clarify the status of the hospital. ''There is clearly
a deal between HCI and the Scottish Office. Is this to remain a hybrid
hospital with half NHS patients and half overseas patients?''
He said the recruitment of staff trained by the NHS was another
example of how HCI was being subsidised by taxpayers' money.
Reservations were also expressed by the Labour MP for Clydebank and
Milngavie, Mr Tony Worthington. He wanted HCI to give exact patient
figures and details of from which countries they had come. He also said
HCI had to make an effort to employ people from the Clydebank area.

A CACHE of firearms, including five sub-machine guns, found during a
house search was put on show by police yesterday.
The biggest weapon discovered during the five-day operation in
Chester-le-Street, County Durham, was a Mark I Bren gun, capable of
firing 500 rounds a minute.
Although dating from the Second World War, Brens remained in service
with the British Army until relatively recently.
The five sub-machine guns included one thought to be a home-made
version of a Mark III Sten gun. The others appeared to be of British,
American, and Italian make but have not yet been fully identified.
In addition, there were three handguns, a smoke grenade, and thousands
of rounds of ammunition. The search could go on for two more days, said
police, who were helped in the search by Army experts.
The search began last Thursday at the request of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, which carried out similar checks and made similar
discoveries at Holywood, near Belfast, at the weekend. The RUC said it
believed its arms find was linked to loyalists.
* Two men and a woman were arrested in Northern Ireland following the
Holywood arms discovery and appeared before Belfast magistrates on
Saturday.
The search was at the home of Irish-born Des Lindop, 42, a quality
control manager at the Royal Ordnance Factory at Birtley, Tyne and Wear,
who is in custody charged with possession of 400 rounds of ammunition,
12 sub-machine guns magazines, and 1000 primer caps.
His brother Dennis, 46, of Holywood, was also remanded in custody
charged with firearms possession. Dennis's wife, Myrtle, 42, is in
custody charged with withholding information.

THE Commons will vote tomorrow on recommendations to suspend Tories
Graham Riddick (Colne Valley) and David Tredinnick (Bosworth) over the
cash-for-questions affair.
Leader of House Tony Newton, in a short statement changing
parliamentary business, announced the date to debate the report by the
Committee of Privileges. It has called for both MPs to be suspended
without pay.
The ban on Mr Tredinnick is recommended for 20 sitting days and that
on Mr Riddick for 10.
The pair where alleged to have been prepared to take #1000 for tabling
Commons questions.
However, the Sunday Times, which reported the allegations last summer,
also was reprimanded by the committee.
Mr Newton said there would be two debates on the issue.
Neither of the two MPs was in the Chamber to hear the announcement.
Shadow Commons Leader Ann Taylor welcomed the debates: ''Some MPs may
wish to have had more notice but I think it will not come as a surprise
to many and it will be welcomed by the House as a whole.''
Mr Simon Hughes (Southwark and Bermondsey), for the Liberal Democrats,
asked whether the Government would seek to impose any whipping of MPs on
how they would vote.
Mr Newton said: ''By convention it is the case that House of Commons
matters of this kind are not the subject of whipped party votes.''

POLICE in Dundee have given young thugs two weeks to turn in their
knives before they launch a stop-and-search campaign to clear the city's
streets of such lethal weapons.
Operation Combat was launched yesterday in the wake of three murders
in the city involving knives and a spate of stabbings and slashings.
The police believe that carrying a knife has become fashionable with
youngsters and has led to a big increase in violence.
A knife surrender until April 30 will allow knives to be dumped at
police stations around the city.
From May 1, all police in Dundee will be under orders to make full use
of powers to stop and search anyone suspected of carrying a knife.
Chief Superintendent Bob Sutherland, divisional commander in Dundee,
explained: ''The level of violent crimes involving knives and other
weapons in this city is at an unacceptably high level.
''The message is quite clear. No person should be under any illusion
that the carrying of knives or other offensive weapons can be considered
fashionable, necessary, or justifiable in any circumstances.''
Posters graphically illustrating knife injuries will be displayed
across the city, with the message: ''You Can't Turn Your Back On This.''
Other posters will warn that knife carrying can lead to a maximum
sentence of two years in prison.
Schools, pubs, nightclubs, and knife retailers will be targetted in
the campaign and a freephone number will be set up for information on
weapon carriers.
In Dundee last year, three out of six murders involved a knife, as did
19 out of 36 attempted murders. Knives were used in 52 robberies and 105
serious assaults. Police brought 312 cases of carrying knives and
possession of offensive weapons to court.
Parents are also being encouraged to use the surrender period to
dispose of any items they think might be used as a weapon by their
children.
The enforcement phase of Operation Combat will last for four months.

Despite UK moves to scrap 200 nuclear weapons, the reality is that our
capability has been doubled, reports Ian Bruce.
THERE are two great constants in the perfidious world of international
politics. The first is that those with a perceived advantage will fight
tooth and nail to retain it. The other is that the disadvantaged will
try to change things and lose.
The month-long conference on the future of the 25-year-old Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty which opened in New York on Tuesday looks set
to become a prime example.
The United States, Britain, and France have already lobbied hard and
will set their own agenda as three of the five members of the existing
and fairly exclusive nuclear club. About 90 of the 178 participating
countries are believed to be in their pockets before the debate opens
properly or a single vote is cast.
At stake is the nuclear weapons' safety of the world and international
policing of wanna-be nations hoping to upgrade their military arsenals
to atomic levels. Of these, Iraq and Iran, as the most unstable regimes,
are causing most concern.
The US and its allies want a new treaty to run for an indefinite
period, allowing them, together with Russia and China, to continue to
dominate the nuclear scene. Emerging countries would prefer a five or
10-year limit before the next landmark conference. They would also like
to see some sign of major disarmament by the ''haves''.
Both the United States and the former Soviet Union have used the end
of the cold war to scrap thousands of obsolete warheads and delivery
systems in the name of peace. What is left, amounting to about 30,000
weapons of various types, is still enough to wipe out the planet's
entire population several times over.
There is also an accord to cut their joint holdings further to 6500
warheads apiece by the year 2003. Most of those warheads will be mounted
on land or submarine-based missiles capable of striking with an accuracy
of about 100 feet at a range of between 5000 and 6000 miles.
Previous stockpiles were vastly less sophisticated. The Americans
calculated that defences round key Soviet targets in the early 1980s
would mean that a saturation policy would have to be adopted to ensure
their destruction. Each primary target would have been bombarded with 30
or more warheads. Soviet technology, five to 10 years behind, meant that
50 or more warheads were assigned to each strategic bullseye.
Britain has now jumped on the bandwagon of visible decommissioning by
declaring that its 200 WE177 freefall nuclear bombs and depth charges
are to be rendered harmless by the end of 1998.
The bombs were nearing the end of their shelf-life in any case, and
with modern anti-aircraft systems, could not be delivered on target with
any degree of confidence or accuracy. The day of a manned bomber
fighting its way through missile and gun defences to nuke Moscow are
long gone.
And while Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd emphasises in New York that
the move is a unilateral gesture on the part of the UK, he will omit to
mention that Britain's nuclear firepower has potentially been doubled
with the introduction of Vanguard-class ballistic submarines and their
D5 American missiles.
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind has said that each Trident boat will
carry only 96 warheads. The Polaris system they are replacing could
deliver 48 per submarine. And up to one-third of those were decoys
designed to lure away defensive fire and confuse an enemy's radar
picture.
On the face of it, the UK is up-gunning at a time when everyone else
is slimming down its firepower. However, there are other factors at
play.
Britain does not manufacture its own missiles. A total of 70 were
ordered from the United States, and only about 50 have so far been
delivered. At 16 launch tubes per submarine, that would be enough to
equip the first three Vanguards.
The UK is totally dependent on the US for the servicing of these
missiles, particularly in the field of guidance systems. Each has to be
returned to King's Bay, Georgia, periodically for routine maintenance.
The warheads, developed at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at
Aldermaston, are a British design, and will be returned to the nearby
Burghfield weapons' plant for safety checks and overhauls before being
stored at the Royal Navy's Coulport weapons' depot on the Clyde.
In the original design at the height of superpower confrontation, the
D5s were developed as a three-stage missile tipped with a re-entry
''bus'' containing up to 12 individually targeted warheads. Even the US
has now scaled that back to eight per missile.
The UK also faces growing reluctance by the Americans to supply the
hardware for an increase in British firepower. Washington sees itself,
with some justification, as the world's pre-eminent nuclear power.
And while the US will welcome British support for an indefinite
extension of the non-proliferation treaty over the next few weeks, it
must be looking ahead to a time when it can literally force Whitehall to
reduce its arsenal by delaying or withdrawing technical support.
The Royal Navy, conscious of this international political dimension,
is also looking at a groundswell public reaction to a #10,000m
investment whose reason for existence largely evaporated along with the
threat of Soviet military power.
To that end, Trident is set to become an all-singing-all-dancing
deterrent over the next 10 years.
A smaller ''sub-strategic'' warhead is being developed to allow the UK
to use the D5 to make a tactical, battlefield-scale nuclear strike
against an aggressor if necessary instead of a devastating blow which
could cripple an entire region.
The Defence Ministry is also negotiating for the purchase of a number
of 1000-mile range US Tomahawk cruise missiles which can deliver
pinpoint conventional attacks with no warning. These cost around
#750,000 apiece.
While it cannot be denied that Trident provides Britain with a
virtually failsafe, long-range and almost invulnerable deterrent,
politicians might wish to question its continuing drain on a shrinking
military budget.
The Defence Ministry claims that the system will take up no more than
about 8% of the annual defence budget. When support and maintenance
costs are brought into the equation, that figure rises dramatically to
nearer 20%, about the equivalent of the cost of the French nuclear
submarine fleet.
On the face of it, the UK is
up-gunning at a time when everyone else is slimming
down its firepower

William Russell on the harm done nationally to political parties by
local authority scandals
CORRUPTION in City Hall is a prospect which sends shivers down the
backs of all party leaders. The scope for it is immense, in spite of all
the checks and balances introduced by the then Prime Minister, Edward
Heath, as a result of the Redcliffe-Maude inquiry following the Poulson
Affair in Newcastle 20-odd years ago.
Unlike back-bench MPs, who have only an alleged influence on ministers
to exploit, and whatever opportunities for asking questions or tabling
the early-day motions the Commons Order Paper permits, councillors
control the levers of real power -- they award contracts, take planning
decisions, spend money, and borrow it.
They are also far from being under the control of party headquarters.
While the behaviour of back-bench MPs is supervised, if not completely
controlled, by the Whips, local councillors are often a law unto
themselves, left to get on with the job provided they cause no waves
nationally.
The Conservative chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, tried last month to
launch a corruption scare as far as Labour local authorities were
concerned, but this particular Tory-inspired war of words fell pretty
flat. Mr Hanley's so-called dossier was significantly not backed by his
boss, Mr John Major.
The Tories have had their own share of bad local government publicity,
notably over Westminster, about as rotten a borough as they come, and it
was arguably a case of yet another Hanleyism. The allegations by Mrs
Irene Adams, Labour MP for Paisley North, following recent drug-related
shootings in Renfrewshire must have been welcome news to him at least,
even if they come too late for his dossier.
Labour has been bedevilled over the years by plenty of damaging
publicity because of the behaviour of some of its local authorities --
at one time Sheffield was known as the People's Republic of South
Yorkshire, Lambeth was dubbed Tirana on Thames, and Islington became,
and remains, a euphemism for left-wing craziness. But belonging to the
Loony Left does not mean an authority is necessarily corrupt. It may be
inefficient, extravagant, and ideologically blinkered to the point of
folly, but that is not the same thing.
However, when something goes wrong locally it can be very damaging
nationally, even if in the end nothing is proved, as Tony Blair
recognised last month when he ordered an urgent investigation into the
latest allegations of sleaze in Birmingham, the jewel in Labour's local
government crown. Four of the city's constituency parties were suspended
to allow the vote-rigging claims to be looked into.
In England three local authorities have given Labour the most problems
-- Liverpool, once a Militant Tendency fiefdom, Lambeth, notably in the
days when it was ruled over by ''Red'' Ted Knight, although some of the
worst excesses appear to have occurred after he was disqualified for
refusing to set a rate, and now Birmingham.
The Liverpool corruption charges related to land deals involving the
selling off of derelict sites, obsolete farms, and playing-fields in the
1980s when Militant ran the city. Last month Derek Hatton was cleared of
the last of 14 charges brought against him, most of which related to
those allegations of corruption in the land deals.
In Lambeth much the same applies. Labour lost control of the council
last year, but prior to that there had been allegations that some #9.5m
had been spent on road schemes without permission, contractors had been
paid hundreds of thousands of pounds in unauthorised payments, a select
list of acceptable contractors had operated, inacurate and inflated
bills had been submitted and paid for contracted work, and council
accounts were closed years late.
Accounting chaos was said to reign in the borough, but, as the former
chief executive, Mr Herman Ouseley, said, while there was a lot of
corruption, it was hard to prove.
The current row affecting Labour is over events in Birmingham. In
February it was alleged that Labour Party supporters were being helped
jump the queue for housing grants and that local party officials had
tried to buy support using some #2m provided by the Government for
renovation schemes.
In March further allegations surfaced that the electoral roll in
Sparkbrook, the safe seat currently held by Roy Hattersley, who retires
at the General Election, was being ''packed'' with fictitious names, or
the names of people who had long left the area.
Party headquarters have suspended the four local parties -- Ladywood,
Perry Barr, Small Heath, and Sparkbrook. Labour's general secretary, Mr
Tom Swayer, has instructed the party's organisation director, Mr Peter
Coleman, to carry out an investigation into the allegations that rival
candidates for Roy Hattersley's seat have been soliciting support.
The other charge involving Birmingham is that in the run-up to last
year's local elections some #7m had been spent by Labour to buy votes.
The problem for the national party with all local government scandals
is that they make news when they break, but soon get forgotten. The
allegations can be hard to prove, can take a long time to investigate,
and, if the authority changes its political colour in the meantime, the
electorate will almost certainly have lost interest in the outcome. But
the damage done to the party by the initial charges can be serious.

The Green Belt will be put under increasing pressure as unitary
authorities take over: Margaret Vaughan explains the threat.
A WARNING that Scotland's Green Belts are under threat from
encroachment by rapacious developers has come from two prominent
environmental conservation groups.
The Cockburn Association, a civic trust in Edinburgh, and the
Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland fear further incursion
into the grassy swathes surrounding towns and cities unless the
Government acts to toughen controls.
Terry Levinthal, secretary of the Cockburn Association, predicts the
move to the new unitary authorities will increase pressure on the Green
Belt, particularly in Edinburgh's. He fears that the dismantling of
regional councils which have responsibility for strategic planning will
lead to a rush of developers who will view the Green Belt simply as a
land bank.
''It is the ultimate nightmare. To consider planning a city, or a
town, without at the same time and under the same regime planning its
hinterlands is such a farce -- it's staggering that somebody could come
up with the idea.''
At the moment, he says, the regional councils are responsible for
structure plans. Under the new unitary authorities, structure plans will
be the responsibility of individual authorities. The Scottish Office is
currently consulting on which areas might join together to become joint
structural authorities.
But, Levinthal points out, evidence is abundant that cash-strapped
councils will implement strategic planning as they see fit, using the
interpretation of the local structure plan that suits them.
He cites the example of proposals for an industrial and housing
development on the Green Belt at Burdiehouse in Edinburgh. The district
council supported the plan, but Lothian Regional Council opposed it. It
called in the application and refused planning permission.
''If the unitary authority had been in force, there would have been no
second tier. The district council would simply have granted permission
and the Green Belt would have been breached again.''
The Scottish Office hotly disputes Levinthal's views, arguing that the
new unitary authorities will have the same responsibilities for
structure plans as the regional councils.
Levinthal responds by claiming developers are using ''planning gain''
-- where they offer something by way of compensation for gaining
planning permission, such as a community resource or money for new roads
and other infrastructure -- as clear inducements to breach the Green
Belt: ''It's a little game invented by developers to buy planning
permission. In other circles you might call planning gain simple
bribery.
''Consider how cash-starved councils are at present and you can begin
to see the dangers for the future.''
Levinthal takes a somewhat apocalyptic view of the future of
Edinburgh's Green Belt. He believes, that if current trends continue, it
will have vanished completely by the year 2025.
The city's Green Belt was created in 1957 to limit the expansion of
the city into the countryside and prevent the coalesence of communities.
It was designed to prevent the loss of farmland and preserve the
landscape setting of the city.
The Cockburn Association argues that instead of constantly looking
outwith the confines of the city for new land for housing, creative
thought should lead planners to look at existing inner-city sites.
''There are spaces in Edinburgh which could be developed without
encroaching into the Green Belt.'' He points to land owned by the Forth
Ports Authority in Leith and Portobello and to neglected acres at
Granton.
The regional councils have to maintain a five-year supply of land for
housing, which he argues is perverse: ''Oxford, for instance, doesn't.
One of the purposes of the Green Belt is to maintain the site of a
historic town or city. Oxford forced the Government to recognise its
specific needs. Why can't we have that dispensation?''
The two main threats to Edinburgh's Green Belt identified by his
association are substantial areas of land, one at Currie, the other at
Craigmillar/Danderhall, earmarked for development in Lothian's new
structure plan, which is currently with the Scottish Office for
approval.
Last week, the Secretary of State dismissed the latest batch of
appeals relating to a number of proposals for commercial and housing
developments in Edinburgh's Green Belt.
These included planning appeals by developers to site superstores at
Sheriffhall and Melville Nurseries, both near Dalkeith; the Burdiehouse
develpment and housing developments at Niddrie/Cauldcoats Farm were also
refused.
The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland joined the
Cockburn Association in welcoming the move to prevent further incursions
in Edinburgh, but both want to see tighter protection to keep developers
out of the ''lungs'' of towns and cities: ''It's obviously a matter of
great concern,'' says APRS manager Elizabeth Garland.
She does not share Levinthal's somewhat pessimistic projections for
the future of the Green Belts under the new unitary authorities,
believing that as a national planning policy, the Government retains
power to ensure it is not dismantled. However, Garland is concerned that
existing controls are not tough enough. ''We do need new planning
guidelines from the Scottish Office.''
The last circular to local authorities was in 1985. Yet England has
had two since, in 1988 and 1995.
''The threat is coming from developers who see the Green Belt as an
appropriate place to build or to develop new roads. One of the purposes
of the Green Belt is to provide an escape, offer recreation facilities
in the countryside for town and city dwellers.''
But since much of the Green Belt intrusion proposed in Edinburgh runs
near the new city by-pass, hardly a green swathe for gritty city eyes,
could there not be an argument for declassifying land immediately
surrounding the road?
''Sadly, as in that case, new roads driven though Green Belt act as
magnets for development,'' Garland points out.
The senior vice-president of the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities, Keith Geddes, also a Lothian Regional Councillor, concedes
there will be difficulties with strategic planning when the new unitary
authorities take power: ''Yes, it will be more difficult where there is
not one single body with an overview. It will mean a lot more
consultation and it will take a while for us to learn the new rules of
the game.
''Undoubtedly it will be more bureaucratic. But it's to be hoped that
where, as in Lothian, we have four Labour-controlled authorities, we can
sit down and discuss issues of common concern.''

A huge traffic jam had mushroomed on the Yugoslav side of the Lipovac
motorway crossing since the inspectors started enforcing the sanctions
one week ago.
Chris Gunness, a spokesman for the UN peacekeeping mission in Croatia,

THE Government yesterday resisted new pressure to begin ministerial
talks with Sinn Fein.
Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour Party leader, accused
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew of unnecessary delay but
Sir Patrick said he was still not satisfied that the IRA would not
return to violence if Republicans failed to get their way at the
negotiating table.
Sinn Fein, whose representatives made fresh contact with senior civil
servants yesterday in an attempt to end the deadlock, claimed the
Government was trying to relegate the party into second division
dialogue and fragment nationalist consensus.
A party spokesman said: ''The Government's position is as inflexible
and as intransigent as it has been for some time now. There is nothing
to suggest they are about to change their position and allow us to move
out of this crisis.
''This issue about decommissioning is a distraction. We are prepared
to discuss all these issues, indeed any item on the agenda with a view
to solving them. The British know that.
''We cannot allow the British to treat Sinn Fein as less than equal
with all the political parties. We are not a second division party. We
have to be treated on the same basis as everyone.''
Nearly eight months into the IRA ceasefire, senior nationalist
politicians on both sides of the Irish border are becoming more and more
irritated over the delay.
Mr Hume confirmed their exasperation when he asked: ''Would Sir
Patrick Mayhew please explain to the public in Northern Ireland why he
is not talking to them?''
The Government's handling of the situation, he said was ''amazing''.
The SDLP leader added: ''If he is going to engage in talks with
different parties in Northern Ireland and not going to engage in talks
with Sinn Fein, what's the point? What's he at? I don't think there's
anyone in Northern Ireland who knows why he's not talking.
''Talk to anyone in the streets. They all expect such talks to take
place. Nobody is going to be angry at such talks. They all expect them
to take place.''
Sir Patrick was unmoved by the outburst. He said: ''If we sit down and
talk to people who have used arms in the past for their political
purposes and have not made any progress at all in getting rid of them,
they are implying that if they don't get what they want around the
table, then they are prepared to go outside the door and cause their
arms to be picked up again and used.
''Now that is fatal for democracy. And not only we but others,
including Mr Hume, have said that that can't happen.''

BACK from the Easter hols, the Commons considered militancy good and
militancy bad. The Tory back benchers heckled Mr Blair, the Labour ones
Mr Major, but neither were up to the standard of the militant National
Union of Teachers' hecklers.
Mr Peter Mandelson (Hartlepool -- Lab.) leapt up to condemn the NUT
before any Tory could. In an earlier incarnation, he was a spin-doctor
par excellence, a man who preferred the stiletto to the bludgeon, the
whispered aside to the full throated yell.
Mr Major stood shoulder to shoulder with him in condemning the
harassment of Labour's Education spokesman Mr David Blunkett. It was
perhaps surprising that no animal rights-inclined MP spoke up for Lucy,
Mr Blunkett's guide dog, who cannot have enjoyed being imprisoned in a
room with demented instructors of youth hammering on the door and
yelling.
Mr Blair also condemned this form of militancy before engaging the
Prime Minister in debate on education cuts to which he gave ''Cuts, what
cuts?'' replies, buttressed by layers of helpful statistics, of which
the Downing Street briefing service never runs short.
Earlier, Mr James Wray (Glasgow Provan -- Lab.) demonstrated a new
technique for demoralising Ministers with spectacular success.
Invariably to be found on one of the front Opposition benches, he moved
to the back terraces. Mr John Bowis, a Health Minister, not spotting
this move, assumed his absence and shifted along the Treasury Bench away
from the despatch box.
When the number of Mr Wray's question, appropriately 13, was called,
there was confusion amongst the Health team somewhat similar to Hyde
Park corner in the rush hour as each tried to work out who should be at
the box.
Mr Bowis, a solidly-built Minister, managed to execute a complete
circling movement, not easy in the confined space between bench and
table, before ending up at the box. ''The Honourable Member has moved,''
he muttered by way of excuse and produced a halting, disoriented reply
to Mr Wray's supplementary.
Regularly-attending Opposition MPs may now ''hide'' in unaccustomed
spots in the Chamber and confuse Ministers by popping up where not
expected. Happily for the Government, most MPs become attached to the
area in which they sit and don't like moving. But Mr Wray is a free
spirit.
Buoyed by this success and the fact that he was also called to
question the Prime Minister, he tore into a massive denunciation of the
Government's failure to do anything about unemployment in his
constituency, escalating into a demand for Mr Major's resignation which
was only slightly marred by his cheerful grin immediately on sitting
down. Triumph in politics is all too often followed by disaster.
Perhaps Mr Wray had not noticed, purred Mr Major, that since he took
over as PM unemployment in Provan had fallen by 28%.
Militancy of another kind was applauded from all sides, with ''plucky
big Canada'' the hero of the hour for singeing the Spanish beard with
''brave, determined unilateral action'' to quote Mr John Wilkinson, an
unwhipped Tory.
Mr William Waldegrave, the Agriculture Minister, emphasised Britain's
go-between role in a bid to rewrite history or at least erase the bits
the Government prefers not to remember.
Mr Peter Shore (Bethnal Green and Stepney -- Lab.) an elder statesman
with bite, didn't let him get away with it, reminding the House that at
an early stage of the dispute the Government had talked of having to
reassess its relations with Canada.
Mr Dale Campbell-Savours (Workington -- Lab.) argued that when you
know you are right a bit of militancy is in order. The difficulty with
that is that the Spanish fishermen and the NUT militants also ''know''
they are right. Perhaps, as a rule of thumb, one might say that militant
action is best restricted to opponents more formidable than a blind man
and his dog.

Passions in Northern Ireland run high despite the hopeful headlines
of peace: Russell Edmunds reports from Belfast on the barriers of
thought that could yet make a mockery of attempts to reconcile
the two opposing traditions.
ON BELFAST'S Ormeau Road on Easter Monday, the threat of sectarian
confrontation and possibly violence was averted only at the last minute.
As they claimed to have done since the turn of the century, the
Ballynafeigh branch of the Apprentice Boys wanted to parade the entire
length of the road crossing the bridge over the River Lagan, thenheading
on towards the centre of Belfast, past a betting shop where five
Catholics were murdered by loyalist gunmen one afternoon during ''The
Troubles''.
The Ballynafeigh marchers found that times had changed on the Ormeau
Road, as they have across Ulster after 25 years of bloody conflict. A
strong line of police straddled the river bridge, barring the marchers
from their traditional route and ensuring, instead, that they veered off
to the left, safely away from the Catholic streets beyond, and the
betting shop.
What the RUC feared might become serious public disorder was narrowly
avoided, but not without bitter recriminations from the re-routed
marchers. ''They have trampled on our rights,'' said one. ''The
Government talks about parity of esteem for Catholics. What about
Protestants? After seven months of the new post-ceasefire Northern
Ireland, it was a small but significant example of the passions and
tensions still aroused and still unquenched behind the headlines of
peace.
Two weeks earlier, the queue outside the Queen's University main
concert hall was long enough to suggest a big star was on the campus.
But the 1300 or so people who filled every seat to the balcony were on a
night out of serious politics rather than entertainment.
Every one of them was a graduate of the university. Most were
Protestants and the meeting had been called to reject a decision by the
university to stop the playing of God Save the Queen at graduation
ceremonies.
Speaker after speaker rose from the mainly professional and
middle-class audience, proving, if proof were needed, that Ulster's
divisions, even without terrorism, are not confined to the poorer, less
academically-minded sections of its community.
Lawyers, doctors, business executives, lecturers and professors, drawn
from the Unionist and Nationalist communities, held the rostrum and
bared their political souls for two hours of often heated exchanges. In
the end, the pro-Union graduates vastly outnumbered the rest. They won
the night, but entrenched arguments go on.
As a consequence, the singing of the national anthem has cast a dark
shadow and deep division across Belfast's 150-year-old university, just
at a time when its students have a chance to experience a conflict-free
environment.
Seven months on, the truth about Northern Ireland is that while the
barriers erected against terrorism are being removed, many others remain
in place in people's minds.Certainly, everyone appreciates the new-found
peace, but building upon it politically is still a problem, with few
obvious answers and the potential for more trouble ahead if one or other
side feels left out of the solutions.
Easter has been an important milestone to pass in the peace process
that began effectively on August 31 last, with the announcement of the
IRA ceasefire, and was added to six weeks later by a similar decision
from loyalist groups.
Government ministers in Belfast have argued, along with many other
observers of the Ulster scene, that the longer the peace holds, the
harder it will be for the terrorists to return to violence.
Significantly, in its pre-Easter message, the IRA seemed upbeat about
the peace process, strongly indicating that a resumption of violence was
not contemplated. However, the comments and speeches over the weekend by
the Sinn Fein leaders, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, have caused
disquiet and unease.
After months of skirting around the issue of disarming terrorist
groups, no-one seems any closer to its resolution.Mr Adams says there is
no historical precedent for the IRA handing over weapons. If it were
even to consider this, then all guns in Northern Ireland should be
treated similarly, including those held not only by loyalist terror
groups but also the security forces.
Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, backed by the Prime Minister,
says Sinn Fein cannot be included in talks on a political settlement or
with other parties until and unless, guns and explosives are
decommissioned. The Unionists are even more entrenched on this line,
while the loyalists in the hardline UDA and UVF say they will only
consider disarming if the IRA does so as well.
Against this circular argument, the room for compromise looks dismal.
Sir Patrick, responding to criticism yesterday that he is responsible
for stalling the peace process, emphasised yet again that the security
forces and the terrorist groups could not be equated. Disarming
terrorists could not be balanced by disarming security forces, he said.
At the very least, he is seeking some further evidence of the IRA's
intent not to return to violence. According to security sources, he has
good reason to do so. Even after a seven-month ceasefire, both police
officers and soldiers in Ulster are distrustful of the IRA, continuing
to claim that it is still carrying out ''dummy exercises'' and using the
more relaxed freedom of movement on the streets to target their homes
for possible future attack.
Another concern is that terrorist weapons and personnel are being used
to impose gangland pressures on local communities. A police survey,
published yesterday, identified drug-trafficking as the emerging No 1
problem, and it is known that terrorist groups, particularly on the
loyalist side, are behind much of this underworld racketeering.
With Easter over, the Government is now coming under a wider criticism
of its strategy than simply from Sinn Fein leaders. The SDLP leader,
John Hume, claims there is increasing frustration with what he terms
''stalling the peace process''.
He has levelled outspoken criticism at the Ulster Secretary, demanding
that it is time ministers met directly with Sinn Fein. He says it is
unrealistic to demand that IRA weapons are handed over, and that so long
as the IRA gives a commitment not to resort to violence, that should be
enough to allow talks to start.
Meanwhile, the Unionists watch and wait. Deeply distrustful of the
Government's motives, especially since the recent publication of the
Framework Documents outlined closer links with Dublin, they, too, are
uncertain of what the future holds.
Surprisingly, both James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley held talks
last week with John Hume, but, given their respective attitudes to the
issue of disarming the IRA, to talking to Sinn Fein or even the future
relationship between London, Dublin and Belfast, common ground will be
hard to find between them.
The peace process continues uneasily, but even if any return to
violence is highly unlikely, the political rocks loom larger as Easter
ends and the summer approaches. The Government's next big gamble is if,
and when, to talk directly to Sinn Fein. To do so will annoy the
Unionists. Not to do so, especially since junior minister, Michael
Ancram has already met the loyalists, may prove increasingly difficult
to defend.
The odds, therefore, are on Ancram meeting a Sinn Fein delegation in
the very near future, but with the issue of decommissioning weapons in
Northern Ireland high on the their agenda.
That will be another milestone in this painfully slow process. But, in
itself, the meeting will not break the deadlocks on taking guns out of
the hands of terrorists, or reaching a political settlement on Ulster.
If there is something that all sides agree upon, it is that welcome as a
peaceful Ulster is, solutions are much further away. And where to march
and what anthem to sing are no small part of the problem, too.

LAWYERS for former Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson yesterday lodged
papers at the High Court in Edinburgh seeking access to television
pictures of two games where trouble broke out.
Ferguson, who was described as c/o Everton Football Club, Goodison
Park, Liverpool, is due to stand trial in Glasgow next month for the
alleged assault of John McStay in a premier-division game against Raith
Rovers at Ibrox last season.
He denies the charge and in his defence is seeking access to Scottish
Television footage of two other games where violence erupted -- the
Scottish Junior Cup Final between Glenafton Athletic and Largs Thistle
last May and a Raith Rovers and Hearts friendly which was played at
Kirkcaldy last August.
Ferguson, who has been capped for Scotland, is seeking an order to
recover copies of footage of both games.
His lawyers say that Scottish Television has denied them access. A
judge is expected to decide on the order next week.

<HEADLINE>Government to set up financial review    Mounting fear for avalanche alert system</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978813134</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE avalanche warning system that covers some of the busiest climbs in
the Scottish Highlands could be scrapped, it was revealed yesterday.
Introduced seven years ago to stem the number of accidents and deaths
in the hills, it offers daily reports on the risk of avalanches in
Glencoe, Lochaber, and Cairngorm.
However, it costs #68,000 a year to operate and the Government wants
to make sure it is giving value for money. A Scottish Office spokesman
said a committee would be set up to look at the scheme's future with
''the widest possible remit''.
Many climbers and rescuers believe the review, expected to report by
next winter, could spell the end of the warning system.
Some climbers -- particularly those from England -- have criticised
the warning system, claiming they knew nothing of its existence. Others
claim it should be either extended to more areas of the Highlands or
scrapped in favour of local volunteers offering advice.
The budget could also be switched to provide more education and
training for mountaineers, or split between some of the busiest mountain
rescue teams, which need up to #40,000 a year to operate.
Others say many climbers obviously ignore warnings in their
desperation to make the best use of their weekend in the Highlands.
At least three people have died in Glencoe this winter as a direct
result of avalanches.
Yesterday, Terry Confield, leader of the Lochaber Mountain Rescue
Team, which covers Ben Nevis, said: ''The service is as important as the
weather forecast.
''It would be a great mistake to think of disbanding the service. Some
people may not take notice of warnings but the vast majority do.
''How can you quantify the number of people who take heed of the
warnings and make sure they climb in safe areas?''
He stressed that no-one had been killed in the Lochaber area this
winter by an avalanche -- proof that most climbers and hillwalkers took
the warnings seriously.
Mr Blyth Wright, co-ordinator of the warning system, said: ''Figures
support the view that the service is reducing the rate of avalanche
fatalities.
''But there is a perception that some of the budget could be better
used in other ways. I don't agree.''
Mr Wright said that in the 14 years before the system was introduced,
there were 28 fatalities due to avalanches in the areas now covered.
Since its introduction, the number of deaths in these areas had fallen
to 10.
He said the number of accidents, too, had fallen in places where the
avalanche warnings were given, while accidents in other districts had
risen.
Mr Confield wants the warnings -- posted in local police stations,
climbing shops, and on notice boards below mountains -- extended to
cover Creag Meagaidh, on the north-east border of Lochaber.
Rescuers in the Torridon area of Ross and Cromarty also want a similar
warning system introduced following its success around Ben Nevis.
Warnings used to be issued on Lochnagar, on the edge of the Balmoral
estate.
''There is some feeling that we should be back there too,'' said Mr
Wright, who fears that the whole service could be restricted to weekends
only.
Hillwalker Alex Mason said: ''Most people pay attention to the
warnings. The trouble is people from south of the Border coming up and
being so intent on getting in a climb that they ignore the warnings. But
that is no reason to consider scrapping the system.''
A Scottish Office spokesman stressed that no decision had been made
and that the service even could be extended if recommended by the
committee.
Yesterday, veteran mountaineer and former Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team
leader, Hamish MacInnes, revealed that the Government had already
considered scrapping the avalanche warning service.
However, Mr MacInnes, who was partly responsible for its introduction,
along with former Scottish Minister for Sport Michael Forsyth, said the
Scottish Office had been persuaded to keep the service running for
another season.
He said: ''It is absolutely vital. A lot of people going to the
mountains these days don't have the accumulated knowledge and
experience, but this information can allow them to plan ahead.
''It is just as essential as the weather forecast. They will be
writing out death warrants if it is withdrawn.''
* Police yesterday said that the body of a climber found in Coire Leis
on Ben Nevis on April 13 had been identified as that of Anthony John
Marsh, 39, an accountant, of Palatine Road, Manchester, who was reported
missing on February 18. It is believed he fell through a snow cornice.

MR Geoff Knights, the boyfriend of EastEnders actress Gillian
Taylforth, was granted conditional bail when he appeared before
magistrates on a wounding charge yesterday.
A self-employed consultant, he is accused of unlawfully and
maliciously wounding Mr Martin Davies with intent to do grievous bodily
harm.
Mr Knights, 40, of Macaret Close, Whetstone, north London, was given
bail on condition he lives and sleeps at his brother Stephen's address
in Hertford. He also must not contact Mr Davies or Miss Taylforth, 39.
Mr Davies, 33, is Miss Taylforth's driver. The alleged incident is
said to have taken place late on Sunday outside the house in Macaret
Close.
A solicitor for Mr Knights read a statement which said: ''Although Mr
Knights did not cause Mr Davies's injuries, he feels deep remorse that
those injuries were sustained, and for any distress caused to Gillian
and Jessica (the couple's daughter).
He added that ''he strongly denies the charges and will be contesting
the allegations in due course''.
The case was adjourned to May 30.

THE Government will do what is necessary to defend the British tuna
fleet against Spanish trawlers in the Bay of Biscay this summer,
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave told MPs yesterday.
Explaining the recent agreement which resolved the dispute between
Canada and the European Union over fishing in the North Atlantic, Mr
Waldegrave said it was a ''victory for good sense and ngotiation''.
He dismissed as inaccurate reports that the British ambassador to
Spain, Mr David Brighty, had been summoned by the Spanish Foreign
Ministry to hear criticisms of Britain's sympathy for Canada.
''Media reports of this meeting bear little relation to what
transpired,'' Mr Waldegrave said.
''Mr Brighty used the opportunity to make clear that we had throughout
the dispute tried to promote a negotiated settlement favourable to
conservation, involving effective enforcement of the rules amd
acceptable to both the EU and Canada. That has now been achieved''.
Mr Waldegrave was asked by whipless Euro-rebel Tony Marlow to take
action to protect the tuna fishermen. ''It is, to say the very least,
just possible that the Spaniards might make it rather hot for our tuna
fishermen when they go about their lawful business later this year'', he
said.
Mr Waldegrave replied: ''The same thought had occured to us, and we
will deploy the necessary resources.'' The Government has indicated it
will deploy Royal Navy ships to protect the British trawlers.
Another whipless rebel, Sir Teddy Taylor, whose emergency question
prompted Mr Waldegrave's statement, was one of several MPs on both sides
who praised Canada for ''showing courage and determination against
over-fishing and illegal fishing which threatened to destroy fish
stocks.''
Mr Waldegrave said: ''The much tougher enforcement, which has been the
major gain out of the agreement, is an achievement in itself for that
fishery, but also sets a powerful precedent for other fisheries.
''I believe it gives warning to the fishermen of all nations and any
nation who are tempted to breach the rules that that is not going to be
tolerable in the future or in any other waters.''
Earlier, the Prime Minister assured MPs that the Royal Navy stands
ready to ensure ''strict enforcement'' on rules and agreements on
fishing.
Mr Major made clear British warships, if necessary, would help any UK
fishing boats prevented from going about their legal business because of
Spanish actions.
His comments came in reply to Tory ex-Minister Patrick Nicholls, MP
for Teignbridge, who asked for an assurance ''that the Royal Navy will
maintain its policy -- which goes back some centuries now -- of curbing
Spain's maritime pretensions, and that the Royal Navy will go to the
assistance of any British fishing boat that is prevented from going
about its legal business by Spanish actions''.
To Tory cheers, the Prime Minister replied: ''I can confirm that.''
He added: ''We believe in strict enforcement, and the fisheries
protection vessels of the Royal Navy will ensure that rules and
agreements are respected.''
Liberal Democrat Matthew Taylor (Truro) later called for tougher
enforcement nearer home, demanding: ''It's time to turn our efforts to
protecting our own fishermen now, following that course set by the
Canadians.''
Mr Waldegrave promised: ''The Government will take the necessary
steps, as it has in previous years, to enforce the law in the
fisheries.''
Tory David Harris (St Ives) said: ''There is a golden opportunity now,
now that world attention is focused on the problem of over-fishing.
''It's up to heads of government, including our own Prime Minister, to
take the lead in trying to get a sensible policy.
''Unless we do, we're going to have a repetition time and again of the
incidents of recent weeks.''

EDINBURGH District Council has been left with an #8000 bill after a US
singing group, The Drifters, walked off stage just 20 minutes into their
performance because of a legal dispute.
Councillor Steve Cardownie, the council's leisure and recreation
committee chairman, said the local authority may have to take court
action to get the money back. Around 1000 people had to be refunded from
council funds.
The Drifters, whose hits have included Up On The Roof and Under The
Boardwalk, had been booked to play at the council-owned Usher Hall on
Monday evening. The show had been widely advertised for months.
The group sang seven short numbers before the promoter came on stage
and announced they would not be able to continue due to ''unforeseen
circumstances''. They left quickly, without changing from their outfits,
avoiding hundreds of disgruntled fans who had each paid up to #10.50p.
''There wasn't any explanation about what was going on,'' one onlooker
said. ''People were going bonkers and demanding their money back. They
were very angry. It wasn't the sort of scenes you would expect in the
Usher Hall.''
Councillor Cardownie said he was angry and upset. He said there was
nothing the Usher Hall management could have done to stop their walking
off stage.
''They just left the stage and Usher Hall staff were left to explain
what had happened. The manageress of the Usher Hall had to come on stage
to explain the situation. We will be refunding everybody who was at the
concert and we face paying out around #8000,'' he said.
''Obviously we will be taking action to try and recover that money
from The Drifters' management and legal action may have to be looked
at.''
It is believed a long-running wrangle between The Drifters and rival
group The Sound Of The Drifters over who can use the group name led to
the walk off. The Sound of the Drifters are believed to have been
granted an interdict on The Drifters just before the show, which stopped
the Usher Hall paying for their performance. Rather than carry on
without payment, The Drifters' management decided to take the group off
stage.
A spokesman for The Drifters' booking agents, Mark Lundquist
Management, said they had no idea where the band or its management were.
The spokesman added: ''I spoke to The Drifters' lawyers this morning and
he told me the group was disappointed at what had happened.''

TEN people were arrested and three women injured in violent struggles
between police and animal rights demonstrators as the campaign against
live animal exports resumed yesterday.
The clashes happened as three lorries containing 1200 sheep arrived at
the Essex port of Brightlingsea, escorted by 200 police officers.
The sheep, destined for Belgium, were delivered to the dock last night
despite a sit-in by activists.
Earlier, angry demonstrators tried to halt the convoy at the dock
gates. Police warned that any disruption would be dealt with under the
1986 Public Order Act. When the trucks approached the dock, 20 people
sat down on the road but police moved in to make arrests.
The crowd shouted ''what a waste of money'' as officers carried
protesters into a waiting prison van.
Several people were slightly injured in the crush. Some protesters
alleged they were hit by police.
Demonstrator Ms Kim Howell, 32, was treated by ambulancemen after she
fell over in the surge. She claimed that a police officer had struck her
in the face. She received treatment for a bruise to her cheek. She said:
''I just saw a black glove but he must have used some force because the
next thing I knew I was on the ground, then in the ambulance.''
Another demonstrator, Mrs Marie Maynard, 41, claimed she had been
pushed in the ribs by a policeman.
She said: ''I am only 5ft 2in, just a bloody woman and I am not going
to take on the police but one of them pushed both hands into my ribs.''
People carrying Socialist Workers Party placards were amongst some who
fought with police.
One woman collapsed and was trampled during the struggle in which more
arrests were made.
The three-month Brightlingsea protest has cost the Essex force more
than #2m and drained manpower from other areas of the county.
Assistant chief constable Charles Clark, in command of yesterday's
operation, said schools' officers and beat policemen had been withdrawn
from normal duties because of the dock protests.
Plans to enforce the Public Order Act were made known in a police
letter last week to townsfolk. This was spelt out again by loud-hailer
before yesterday's convoy arrived.
The threat of legal action already has forced the local campaign
group, Brightlingsea Against Live Exports, to disband for fear that its
leaders would be held liable for the disruption.
Mr Clark admitted he had deployed a large force because of potential
trouble from people using the occasion to campaign against the new
Criminal Justice Act.
''We didn't know what to expect,'' he said: ''We have tried to reduce
the numbers of officers during the dispute because we do not want to
arrest people.''
He denied that the Public Order Act had been used to incite trouble.
He said the letter to townsfolk was intended to open a dialogue with
those who supported the protests.
He also said he regretted that the local action group had disbanded,
since police now had no-one to negotiate with over future protests.
''The export of live animals is a lawful trade just as it is lawful
for the people to demonstrate against it. We are the unlucky ones in the
middle of it. It is a major drain on policing in Essex,'' said Mr Clark.

A CONFERENCE in Glasgow on Friday will open with the words: ''Karaj
amikoj, bonvenon al Glasgovo okaze de la 90-a Skota Kongreso de
Esperanto'' -- and the international delegates will all understand
perfectly.
Next weekend marks the 90th annual conference of the Scottish
Esperanto Federation, with visitors expected from Belgium, Germany, and
Poland.
Mrs Mia Casey, a geography teacher from Bishopbriggs who is Croatian
by birth, will speak the opening words. She met her Esperanto-speaking
husband, Jack, in the former Yugoslavia.
The language's greatest advantage is that it aids communication and
helps people with different native tongues to speak to each other on an
equal footing, she believes.
She said: ''For the first years of our marriage, we communicated
through Esperanto as I spoke no English.
''Many people in the world speak English but their English is never on
the same level as native speakers. With Esperanto, there is never any
reservation about speaking.''
Interest in Esperanto in Scotland is growing gradually. Its speakers
include the Conservative Party chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, and the
Shadow Education Secretary, Mr David Blunkett.
Esperanto was devised by Dr L L Zamenhof in 1887 as an international
second language that would allow people to retain their own languages
and cultural identities. Its advocates today are lobbying for it to be
adopted officially by the European Parliament and associated
institutions which spend 60% of their administrative budgets on
translators and interpreters.
Mrs Casey said: ''Using one language would be a lot easier. The
language is so well developed that it has original literature and
translated literature.''
Delegates, expected to number between 45 and 50, will have a programme
including a studgrupoj, a visito al la Glasgova Artlernejo, mastroverko
de CH Rennie Mackintosh, the occasional lunco and kafpauzo, and a
promeno lau la rivero au tra Glasgow Green Parko.

THE conversation after a car crash in Lewis would have been ''fairly
muted'', a court heard yesterday.
The drivers were second cousins, had the same name, and were both
elders of the Free Church.
At Stornoway Sheriff Court, 80-year-old Donald Morrison, of Kennedy
Terrace, Stornoway, admitted driving without due care and attention when
he collided with a car being driven by his second cousin.
He also admitted driving without an authorised licence.
Mr Ken Macdonald, who appeared for Mr Morrison, said his client had a
medical certificate showing that he was perfectly fit to drive.
He had been driving for 40 years and this was his first accident.
As he had approached a road junction, there had been a vehicle parked
on the double yellow lines which restricted his view.
Mr Macdonald added: ''Both drivers are second cousins and both are
elders in the Free Church. I think the conversation would have been
fairly muted therefore after the accident.''
Sheriff Ian Cameron imposed a fine of #100 and five penalty points on
the first charge and admonished Morrison on the second charge.

THOUSANDS of tons of rubbish could be dug up on Uist and dumped on its
larger Western Isles neighbour, Lewis.
However, people living close to the proposed dump at the village of
Bennadrove near Stornoway, yesterday said they would oppose the plan.
Council officials came up with the idea after problems arose over
plans to extend the Rueval rubbish dump on Benbecula.
They now plan to send the loads by road to Lewis in three bulk
carriers each week.
After hearing of the plan, one Bennadrove housewife said: ''What a
wonderful tourist attraction -- lorryloads of pooh on the island roads.
I can't wait.''
Although planning permission and consent to discharge effluent was
obtained five years ago, negotiations to take the land for an extension
at the Rueval tip out of crofting tenure have still not been settled.
It may take several years for the deal to be agreed in the Scottish
Land Court -- but at the current rate of use, the Benbecula dump cannot
be used safely after April next year.
The only way to prolong its life, according to a report to island
councillors, is to dig up the rubbish and transfer it somewhere else --
like Bennadrove.
A waste management plan is also being drawn up which, in the face of
new Government and EU policy to tax heavily councils in an attempt to
halt landfilling, would likely propose that all Western Isles rubbish be
carted to Bennadrove.
The report, by environmental services director Hamish Fraser, stated:
''The coming pressures to centralise waste disposal and divert waste
away from landfill are unavoidable.''
Bennadrove resident Peter Macleod was horrified when he learned of the
plan yesterday.
He warned of heavy traffic destroying the heart of their
recently-improved village.
He said: ''When dumping began at Bennadrove, there were very few
houses here.
''Now there are houses along the road into the dump as well as a brand
new Scottish Homes development which these bulk carriers would have to
go through.
''There's also a lot of quarry traffic already on this road.
However, environmental services councillors will be urged to agree to
the Uist rubbish being dug up and transferred to the large Bennadrove
council tip from April 1 next year.
Up to 50,000 tonnes a year, almost a quarter of the Western Isles'
rubbish output, could then be sent by road to the tip.
Mr Alex Macdonald, chairman of Laxdale Community Council, which takes
in Bennadrove, said: ''I think this plan is crazy.''

A SCOTTISH university stands to earn a small fortune from a miniature
laser which was invented by two of its scientists and believed to be a
world first.
The laser, which generates a beam of green light, can be used to count
cells for biomedical research, make plates for colour photographic
printing, and examine tiny integrated circuits used in computer
memories.
The breakthrough was made at St Andrews University, which has licensed
its patent to an American laser firm for mass production.
Dr Bruce Sinclair and Dr Neil MacKinnon spent four years developing
the revolutionary mini-laser.
The development has won an award from a major US trade magazine as the
most innovative laser product of the last year.
Dr Sinclair said: ''We believe our invention is a world leader. People
have been trying for years to come up with a compact low-power laser. It
has been difficult to get something this complicated into such a compact
size.''
He added: ''This is the first of its kind in the world that we're
aware of and is the first time that anyone has got the technology down
to this size.'' The system measures only two centimetres.

DRESS for success is an eighties' cliche that designers in the
nineties have been doing their utmost to live down. In five years we've
had grunge, wispy-thin slip dresses, killer corsets, and cantilevered
backsides. (Are bustles and cushion padding a realistic option?)
Only now, after seasons of chaos, are designers cottoning on to a look
that is classic, streamlined and confident for the professional woman:
the sort of clothes she can wear to hail a cab at 8am or catch the
Glasgow InterCity without looking as though she didn't go home last
night.
Armani, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan and Nicole Farhi are some of the few
designers who have always understood a career woman's needs. So is the
Irish designer Louise Kennedy, who like them knows how to conceive
classy faultless clothes that can take a woman anywhere.
Hers is a new name in the fashion pantheon although she has been
dressing Dublin's career set for nine years. At the top of that list is
Ireland's first lady, President Mary Robinson, whose amethyst moire
taffeta inauguration outfit Kennedy designed.
''She is a perfect size 10, extremely elegant with great legs and she
is pro-Irish design,'' Kennedy remarks. Now the American ambassador to
Ireland, Jean Kennedy-Smith, some of the Tony O'Reilly clan, plus
corporate women and political wives turn to her for their clothes. What
they find are simple, classic designs in beautiful fabrics which are
also wearable.
Kennedy's clothes travel well, don't distract, yet look sleek and
feminine. ''Career women want to know their clothes make the right
statement, but many designers would rather say what they want to say,
regardless. Mary Robinson is a fantastic ambassadress for Irish
design,'' says Kennedy, who supplies a lot of her suits. ''She
understands the importance of clothes which mustn't overpower her but
give her all she needs, so she can forget about them.''
The key to Kennedy's collection is the jacket, invariably long and
lean, with its dipping hem elongating the body. Her other favourite
shape this spring is narrow at the shoulder, flaring out over the hips
with a neat Nehru or scrolled collar, which she teams with tailored
trousers or a variety of skirts -- short and flared, tulip shaped or
long wrap styles.
This flexibility is the answer for women on the move. Different,
softly-tailored looks can easily be created with exquisite hand-painted
silk chiffon scarves, dresses (which the singer Enya snaps up), and
palazzo pants providing the luxurious touch.
''Louise uses beautiful fabrics, beautiful prints and cuts them
simply,'' explains Susan Kincaid, the fashion buyer at Jenners, who has
just introduced Kennedy's collection to the store. ''They are quite
understated and basically ageless.''
THE collection is not intrinsically Irish in the way John Rocha uses
Celtic motifs and Paul Costelloe focuses on Irish linen and tweeds. It
has a more cosmopolitan appeal. Fabrics are her weakness, most of which
are tender, muted Italian cloths (one of her suppliers also works for
Armani), mixed with jerseys and suede.
However, she does bow to Ireland's prestigious tailoring heritage:
''There is a great perception of quality, finish and old techniques in
tailoring here,'' she says. It is a skill she has harnessed for her own
finely constructed separates.
* Louise Kennedy's collection is available from a selection at Jenners
in Edinburgh, Simpsons in London and Brown Thomas in Dublin.
* ABOVE: achieve the height of understated elegance in a sand striped
jersey tunic, #199, paired with narrow linen pants, #199.
* ABOVE RIGHT: turn heads wearing this simple yet stunning olive
jersey dress with an unusual tie-string back detail, #225.
* RIGHT: enjoy the flattering lines of a navy jacquard jersey body,
#199, and elegant matching palazzos, #249.
* LEFT: be perfectly suited for any occasion in a grey linen jacket,
#335, teamed with matching slim trousers, #199, and a luxurious large
hand-painted silk wrap, #249.

DOUBTS clouding the appointment of a hospital chaplain to the board of
an NHS trust were yesterday dispelled by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang.
He confirmed the appointment of the Rev Ian Miller, chaplain at the
Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria, as one of five non-executive
directors on the board of the Lomond Healthcare NHS Trust, the last of
the new Scottish trusts to be created.
It had been reported that the trust's chairman, Mr Stephen Newall, did
not favour Mr Miller's appointment but, last night, Mr Newall dismissed
the reports as ''absolute rubbish''.
Mr Newall told The Herald he had no power in suggesting potential
board members; nor could he influence their selection, a decision which
was taken by an advisory committee in Edinburgh.
''Reports of a row are absolute rubbish. My relations with Mr Miller
are extremely cordial and I have never told him I did not consider him
suitable. On the contrary, he is eminently suitable for the job and I am
extremely happy to welcome him to the trust.''
A Scottish Office spokesman denied that the reports, carried on
Monday, had any bearing on the prompt announcement of Mr Miller's
appointment.
''The decision was taken last week and it was only the combination of
the Easter break and a power cut which stopped it being announced
then,'' said the spokesman.
Mr Miller, minister at Bonhill Parish Church in Dunbartonshire, was
delighted by his appointment but confused by the row over it. He said
his only direct contact with Mr Newall had come when the chairman called
to congratulate him on his appointment to the board.
''I am not aware of any machinations that went on in the background,
if they did or not, but I'm delighted to be offered the position,'' Mr
Miller said. He had developed a strong affinity with the staff at the
Vale of Leven hospital and was looking forward to representing their
views.
His only dilemma now was to decide how to use the salary from the
position, which he believed was in the region of #3000. ''I'm not going
to do this for personal gain,'' he said, and added that he would assess
which one of his projects could best use the money.

THERE were moments during the last London collections when it seemed
fashion was flagrantly marching towards extinction, stripped down to a
bare bum and unadorned mammaries as it made its farewell to the world.
Well, histrionic nudity may be the only thing left to some designers,
but there are others such as Ben de Lisi whose aesthetic way with fabric
and cut has never been more in demand. How significant, then, that at a
time when the bottom is falling out of fashion for too many of his
colleagues, de Lisi picked up the British Glamour Award during October's
Fashion Week.
He is, of course, no stranger to the shortleets for the rag trade's
most illustrious prizes. In 1990 he was nominated as one of the most
innovative designers in London and for three consecutive years his name
was among the contenders for the glamour trophy. And it is in that realm
of clothes for after-dark that his reputation mostly resides. Yet there
is nothing precious or excessive about his style. He is, after all, one
of those languid New Yorkers whose forte is blase chic.
''I don't gild the lily but I know how to shape cloth in a manner that
allows the whole look to be fluid and unforced,'' he explains. What
baffles de Lisi, however, is that he has been working compulsively in
this vain since 1982 when he first arrived in London, but it is only in
the last couple of years that wide recognition has reached his door.
''Britain has been good to me and I seem to have built a niche in the
market as someone who has reinvented the dress.'' His success, he feels,
is linked to his respect for women's intelligence. ''I never
underestimate them, and I don't agree with those male designers who feel
they must parody women. In October I had great reviews from my catwalk
show, without having to resort to bare buttocks.''
Much of de Lisi's understanding of clothes as quality items stems from
his Italian American childhood. ''My parents weren't involved in fashion
-- my mum is a musician, my dad an aeronautical engineeer -- but my
grandparents were a sample maker and a tailor. So we were raised with a
knowledge of what good clothing comprised. As children my two brothers
and myself wore gaberdine trousers and camel coats with velvet collars.
I wasn't allowed to have a pair of jeans until I was 18 -- jeans in the
eyes of my family were for farmers.''
His folks, he says, were typical of that immigrant generation who
didn't possess upper-class money but were focused on giving their
offspring a cultivated upbringing. Together the de Lisis went to
concerts and art exhibitions: Ben himself trained as a sculptor before
branching into fashion; one of his brothers is a builder, the other an
opera singer.
''My collection knows no particular age or shape and my customers are
self-assured women who don't need male approval when they buy their
clothes. They are also women with womanly bodies and we take account of
what is flattering for them and what is not.'' One might feel this
should be the cardinal rule of every fashion designer but de Lisi is
scathing of the buttocks pedlers. ''I understand why they do these
things but it's not fashion, it's tragi-comedy and the reason why
British fashion is not treated seriously abroad.''
Equipped with his glamour accolades and the grace of his simplicity,
de Lisi has the authority to speak out against strip shows masquerading

THE new Highland Council met for the first time in Inverness yesterday
and elected Mr Peter Peacock, the independent vice-convener of Highland
Regional Council, as its first convener.
Councillor Peacock, 43, who represents Ardersier, had to overcome a
challenge from the Scottish National Party which put up its own
candidate, Dingwall Councillor Mrs Margaret Paterson.
Mr Peacock was the clear favourite. He was proposed by Mr Duncan
McPherson, convener of Highland Regional Council.
Strathspey councillor, Dr Iain Glen, said that, though the SNP was a
minority group on the independent dominated unitary authority, it was
the largest party political grouping and had attracted 17% of the vote
-- the largest share of any of the parties.
Mr Peacock, however, secured 52 votes to Mrs Paterson's 15.
In his first speech as convener, Mr Peacock made a clear appeal to
members from regional and district councils to forget the sometimes
bitter debate over local government reform which had divided them in the
past.
''We all of us in the past few weeks have gone to the electorate and
been elected to the Highland Council and whether we come from a
background of district council or regional council experience or come to
this chamber as new councillors, I do hope we can all look forward and
commit ourselves and our energies to fashioning a vision of the future
of the Highlands and making sure we deliver quality service to people
wherever they are and whatever their needs may be.''
There was a three-cornered fight for vice-convener. After two votes,
Lochbroom Councillor David Green, 43, who chairs Highland region's
finance committee, defeated Lochalsh Councillor John Farquhar Munro,
chairman of Skye and Lochalsh District Council, by 46 votes to 23.
Ferindonald councillor Valerie MacIver, who chairs the regional
education committee, dropped out after the first round of voting.
The Highland Council later agreed to set up a general purposes
working-group of 24 councillors based on electoral wards in each
division, plus the convener and vice-convener. This group will make
recommendations to the council on a range of issues, including the
appointment of a new chief executive.

<HEADLINE>Protection pledge in drug war Police put pressure on a 'handful' of Paisley thugs</HEADLINE>

THE heat was increasing yesterday on the four Paisley brothers at the
centre of the drugs violence scandal which has left the image of the
town in tatters.
Detective Chief Inspector John McGowan, one of the senior detectives
involved in investigating the series of shootings directly related to
the current turf war, told The Herald the force would offer protection
to potential witnesses, including new addresses, in an attempt to break
the deadlock.
''There really is nothing much between what exists at present in
Ferguslie Park and a decent existence for a large number of decent
people who live there,'' he said.
''What we are trying to do is to alienate a handful of thugs from the
rest of the community, and to do that we are willing to relocate people.
Hopefully, that would only be for a short time until the culprits are
put away,'' he said.
With the media spotlight firmly turned on Paisley, rumour is flying
and speculation about criminal involvement is rife. The community
business, FCB Security -- part of Ferguslie Park Community Holdings,
whose finances are being investigated -- has been named as a focus of
allegations of intimidation.
The police are aware of these and many other allegations but are
desperately short of actual evidence of wrongdoing. The evidence of
direct intimidation has been limited, despite all the media claims.
Another detective close to the inquiry believes that this is probably
the same for the local MP, Mrs Irene Adams, who has likely been told
many of the same allegations -- particularly those against the criminal
family at the centre of most of the recent troubles -- but lacks any
firm evidence.
The irony is that much of the present morass of tit-for-tat violence,
which has now brought to the surface a nasty local political scene
involving the Labour Party, has stemmed from one man's personal drug
habit.
This particular criminal had become in recent years more or less
''respectable'', running a business on the outskirts of the Ferguslie
Park scheme. His personal cocaine habit had, however, driven him towards
a cash-flow crisis. Simultaneously, a leading Paisley criminal who had
control of the drugs trade locally had been removed from the streets and
was in jail.
The opportunity for a takeover was there and was seized in the only
way the criminals knew -- with brutality and guns, a predatory expansion
into territory they had lost. It seems to have been almost coincidental
that another member of the same family was working at that time in the
local community business. The police view appears to be that, while the
business itself is blameless, that particular criminal was not.
FCB Security may simply have been used as a convenient front for the
violent activities of one man and his criminal cronies. There is nothing
to suggest criminal involvement on the part of any of the directors of
the community business. The alleged major influence of the jailed
Paisley criminal, supposedly pulling strings in the battle from behind
bars in Barlinnie, is also very doubtful.
Similarly, claims that the entire Paisley imbroglio has been
orchestrated as some kind of proxy war by a group of Glasgow
''heavies'', or indeed by one Glasgow-based ''Mr Big'', are dismissed by
detectives on the ground as the purest fantasy.
The fact remains that the Paisley detectives face a tangible fear
factor which has made progress on their various inquiries painfully
slow. The present inquiry began six months ago with attempts to head off
the factional warfare which developed, but the same problem was
apparent.
''We have to break a barrier,'' says Mr McGowan, ''and as long as we
do not get there, we are all going to be spectators. Meantime, we are
assembling the evidence, moving in a specific direction. We have to keep
trying to get into the heart of the communities, because otherwise we
will be imposing policing on this situation when what is required is
policing from within.
''Ferguslie Park is not a difficult housing scheme to police but we
must get this group of gangsters out of it. Take out this hard core of
individuals and it will be a decent place with a much better life for
everyone,'' he declares.

<TEXT>
CLYDEPORT, the privatised Clyde Port Authority, said yesterday that it
had carried out dredging operations in parts of the upper reaches of the
river near Glasgow city centre that it has been accused of neglecting.
It was responding to concerns expressed by public health experts that
the build-up of silt on the Clyde could block sewage outfalls and create
a potential public health hazard.
There has been controversy over Clydeport's dredging role before and
since the management buy-out which led to last November's windfall of
nearly #5m for two directors, when their #75,000 shareholdings soared
after the firm applied for admission on the Stock Market.
In the past, Clydeport has claimed that, as a commercial organisation,
it was not economically feasible to continue dredging further up the
river than Meadowside Quay without a financial contribution.
However, a spokesman said yesterday that sandbanks as far up as the
former Renfrew Ferry, which is now moored upriver of the Kingston
Bridge, had been cleared.

THE family of Ice-cream War murderer Thomas 'TC' Campbell protested
last night that the supply of powdered food he took back to Shotts
prison with him yesterday after a week in Law Hospital had been
immediately taken away by warders.
Campbell was returned to jail after doctors at Law stabilised his
physical condition after three months of self-inflicted starvation.
His wife, Elizabeth, and sister Mrs Agnes Lafferty had taken him a
supply of powdered food at Law Hospital in the hope that the prison
authorities would relax the rules to allow him to use it in jail.
Earlier, a Scottish Prison Service spokesman said that this compromise
would last until the supply was exhausted, when Campbell would, once
again, be offered prison food.
Mrs Campbell said last night: ''The compromise does not seem to have
lasted very long or Shotts Prison are taking their own view. Tommy was
told by the doctor that he would be sent out on the basis that he
continued to eat the powdered food we had brought.
''But when he got into Shotts he phoned us to say they had taken
everything from him, including all the food, his personal papers and
documents. We do not know what is going on. They did not even leave him
with a tea bag for the night.''
Campbell is half way through the 20-year minimum part of a life
sentence imposed on him in 1984 after his conviction for the murder of
six members of a Ruchazie, Glasgow, family in a dispute over ice-cream
van territories in housing schemes. He has protested that the evidence
against him was falsified and has gone on hunger strike.
Last week, his condition at the hospital in Shotts Prison had caused
sufficient concern for him to be transferred to Law.
Before his return to prison yesterday, his wife had said: ''He is
still very shaky on his feet but he is cheerful. He intends to get
sufficient of his strength back to resume the fight for justice. He will
never stop.''
The Scottish Prison Service was not available for comment last night.

A RAINBOW coalition emerged yesterday to control the new single-tier
Borders Council, amid claims that pledges to keep politics out of local
government in the region had been broken.
As 58 new councillors elected earlier this month met for the first
time behind temporary desks in Kelso's Tait Hall -- more usually the
venue for pantomimes and concerts -- it was announced that an
administration would be formed under the umbrella title Border Alliance
made up of 11 independents, 15 Liberal Democrats, eight Scottish
Nationalists, and two Labour councillors.
Convenerships and vice convenerships of key committees will be shared
out on a basis of half to the independents and the remaining half
between the three political parties.
Thirty seats went to independent councillors on April 7 but it became
clear in succeeding days that no ruling independent group could achieve
an overall majority because some councillors wished to maintain freedom
of action and declined to join a formal grouping.
Now any opposition on the new council will come from the 19
independents outside the alliance, plus three Tories.
The man elected yesterday as convener of the new council is a former
vice convener of Cosla, Mr Drew Tulley of Galashiels, who is also
currently chairman of the powerful Borders region planning committee.
On election night, he described the returning of 30 independent
councillors as a powerful endorsement of a stated determination to keep
politics out of local government.
Yesterday, non-Alliance independents said it was now clear that
power-sharing meetings had been held without their knowledge very soon
after the election but the situation became clear to them only when some
independents in the coalition group failed to turn up for a policy
meeting yesterday morning.
Councillor Tulley himself admitted yesterday that the ruling group
agreement was in place 10 days ago.
Berwickshire Councillor George Finlay, who sits as a Tory on
Berwickshire District Council but stood as an independent for the new
body, said: ''To argue now for a power-sharing alliance with any
political group is a betrayal of the electors who gave us a majority,
and smacks of deception.''
However, Councillor Tulley insisted after yesterday's meeting: ''We
have come to a very strong agreement and I expect each group leader to
adhere to that. I want total involvement by the 36 members of the group
in formulating policies before they come into the council chamber. We
will be putting through sound policies based on sound research and the
needs of the Borders.
''I favour a very small management team and a wider structure of
committee chairs.''
The new council will run in tandem with Borders region -- ruled by a
coalition of independents and Liberal Democrats -- and the district
councils of Roxburgh, Tweeddale, Berwickshire, and Ettrick and
Lauderdale. It will replace them completely next April.
Councillor Tulley said decentralisation would be a key area of policy
to be hammered out in the coming weeks, with offices and meetings
devolved to principal towns such as Hawick, Peebles, Duns, and
Galashiels as well as the present regional headquarters at Newtown St
Boswells.

The fourth-year graphic design student is to use the cash to help fund

She said: ''I spent three weeks last year teaching at a school in
Lugazi in Uganda.
''I am really happy about winning the award as it means I can go back
to help at the new school.''
Ms Nelson, 21, of Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, added: ''I'd like to
use my art college skills to assist the local women set up a craft group
so that they can earn income for themselves.''
Sadly, her designs will not be seen on postage stamps just yet. The
Post Office has no plans to put them into production.

MPs WERE urged yesterday to prevent the guilty profiting from their
crime by selling their story to newspapers and to provide new protection
for the identity of those accused of sexual offences like rape.
The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill introduced by Tory back bencher
Michael Stephen (Shoreham) which sought to ban such payments, got its
formal first reading. However, pressure on parliamentary business means
it has little chance of becoming law.
The Bill seeks to ''prohibit payment directly or indirectly to any
person convicted of an offence in the UK . . . or to any person
associated with that person in respect of any book, play, film,
newspaper article or other publication relating to that offence''.
Mr Stephen said: ''It makes a mockery of our system of criminal
justice and causes justified public outrage when a person is convicted
of crime and is then seen to profit from that crime by selling his story
to a newspaper or being paid for his cooperation for a book, a film, a
play or some other publication.''

TEACHERS threatening a campaign of disruption in schools south of the
Border over rising class sizes came under attack yesterday from the
Government, the Labour Party -- and their own leaders.
In Blackpool, as the biggest teaching union voted to ballot on a
one-day national strike later this year, its leader accused delegates of
''living in a fantasy world of unachievable aims, impossible goals and
unattainable targets''.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers,
said the union was in danger of being taken over by extreme left-wingers
totally unrepresentative of ''ordinary members''.
''There is no doubt . . . the Socialist Workers' Party want to get
their hands on the NUT. I am determined they won't,'' he said.
In the Commons, the Prime Minister lined up with Labour leader Tony
Blair in condemning the NUT decision to ballot on strike action.
Mr Major said he ''very much'' regretted the vote and attacked the
behaviour of some militants who jostled Shadow Education secretary David
Blunkett at the weekend as ''disgraceful'' and ''loutish''.
Mr Blair also said strikes ''would be wrong and misguided'', but
accused the Government of peddling its ''own brand of extremism'' by
cutting back on education spending and refusing to fund the teachers'
pay award.
At Eastbourne, Education Secretary Gillian Shephard had blunt words
for the rival National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women
Teachers, which is expected to back withdrawing children from over-sized
classes on a rota basis.
She said: ''The public wants to feel teachers are disciplined.
''They do not want to see more disruption in our schools just as we
are reaping the reward of change, effort and hard professional work.''
NUT leaders tried desperately yesterday to stave off a strike ballot,
fearing it risked alienating the support of parents.
Executive member Tony Brockman warned the conference not to commit its
members to action they had no desire to take.
However, the mood of the conference was clear in the cheers greeting
his warning that parents would view action as a ''directly political
strike against the Government''.
Mr Ron Haycock, a teacher from Waltham Forest who favoured action,
said parents would not be alienated. Their protests were already leading
the way.
''I will be telling teachers in my child's school that they owe it to
my child to go on strike,'' Mr Haycock said.

AN officer who rejoined the Royal Air Force four years after she was
discharged on the grounds of her pregnancy has been awarded #9543
compensation.
Mrs Corinne Thirkell, 45, claimed she was discriminated against on the
grounds of her sex when she was discharged almost 10 years ago.
An industrial tribunal heard that she had joined the RAF at the age of
31. She accepted a demotion from flying officer to acting pilot officer
in order to achieve her ambition of becoming a fighter control officer.
However, she was discharged after serving almost four years when she
found that she was pregnant. The tribunal heard the pregnancy had not
been planned and she had not been married at the time.
Mrs Thirkell, of 70 Muirton Place, Kinloss, Forres, Moray, had her
daughter, Lucy, 10. Less than two years later, she had a son, Alexander.
Four years after her discharge, she wrote, asking to re-enlist, and
was given the rank of flying officer working in air traffic control.
She spent five months on a training course, separated from her family,
then was posted to RAF Kinloss, where her husband was serving. Around
the same time, he was posted to Wales and the couple lived apart. They
separated almost two years ago. Mrs Thirkell is still serving in the Air
Force.
In its findings, the tribunal said it had no doubt about Mrs
Thirkell's commitment to the RAF. She had been determined to succeed
from day one and made no secret of her ambition to achieve a ''thick
stripe'', the rank of air commodore.
She regarded serving in fighter control intercept as the next best
thing to flying.
Mrs Thirkell told the tribunal that she was not particularly maternal,
describing babies as ''dirty, smelly things'', and she made it clear
that she was equally -- if not more -- happy with the company of dogs,
cats, and horses.
The tribunal formed the impression that she was rather content to take
time out of her career to have her family.
Had she not had her first child and her service career had been
uninterrupted, she would probably have been promoted to the rank of
squadron leader, but the Ministry of Defence could not accept
responsibility for the fact that she had a child in the first place.
Mrs Thirkell had been seeking #60,000 compensation for loss of
earnings but the tribunal restricted the award to #9543.

Benedict Brogan describes the political career of MP Terry Dicks --
known for his extreme views on a variety of issues -- who has been
appointed to the Scottish Affairs Committee
ONE of the most outspoken English Tories in the Commons has been
appointed to the Scottish Affairs Committee, where he says he intends to
be strictly apolitical and to defend the interests of Scotland.
Mr Terry Dicks is famed for his extreme views on immigration, capital
punishment, and the arts, and is a favourite with the tabloids for his
willingness to provide controversial comment on just about any subject.
He replaces Ms Jacqui Lait, another Tory with an English constituency.
Because of the shortage of Scottish Tory MPs, the Government has to make
up its majority on the committee by appointing English-based back
benchers. They do not stay long. Ms Lait was a member for less than six
months.
Mr Dicks -- known as ''Phil'', short for Philistine, of which more
later -- is MP for Hayes and Harlington, a tract of west London suburbia
that includes Heathrow airport. He holds the seat by a potentially fatal
53 votes.
Aged 58, Mr Dicks was born into the Bristol working class. He failed
his 11-plus but made it to the Catholic Workers' College at Oxford, and
later took a degree at the London School of Economics.
His reputation for unpredictability and for espousing socially
unfashionable causes and opinions masks his loyalty to the party. He is
not a rebel by inclination or voting record, but he has been known to
leave Government whips distinctly uncomfortable.
Subjects on which the MP, once described by Sir Teddy Taylor as a
specialist in ''bone- headed abuse'', has expressed unusual views
include:
* Football hooligans: he once suggested they should be sprayed with
dye so that ''people know they are sub-human''; in 1988 he criticised
Scottish football fans involved in hooliganism as ''those pigs from
Scotland'' who should be birched.
* Immigration: steadfastly opposed; described West Indians as bone
idle, and once said: ''It's about time the West Indians were given a
kick in the pants -- and the Press Council as well''.
* The Arts: his views on the arts earned him the nickname Philistine;
firm opponent of arts subsidies -- he once asked ''What is the good of
subsidising the arty-farty types?'' Opera is his favourite target: ''I
do not believe that an overweight Italian singing in his own language is
part of my heritage''. The Terry Dicks arts policy? ''I'd scrap the Arts
Council, the whole arts bureaucracy, and make the BBC rely on
advertising.''
* Poll tax: voted against.
Mr Dicks, whose only connection with Scotland is his Glaswegian
mother-in-law, said he would be strictly apolitical in his approach to
Scottish affairs. ''There is no ulterior motive to my appointment. I am
not going there to defend Government policy.
''These committees should not be party political. I will be there to
defend the interests of Scotland. Scottish members have views on English
affairs. I don't think it's detrimental to Scotland for English members
to have views on Scotland.''

THE labour leader of the new South Ayrshire unitary authority, which
meets for the first time today, last night pledged an open and
progressive administration which would give people confidence in it.
Councillor Ian Welsh said that having won control from the Tories who
run the existing Kyle and Carrick District Council, they were determined
to usher in a new style of local government. He stressed that the new
administration would be different from both its predecessor and from
neighbouring authorities which have been under Labour control over the
years.
He was unhappy about a Herald article yesterday about past
maladministration in South Ayrshire -- a geographical and historical
reference not to the new single-tier authority but to the nearby Cumnock
and Doon Valley District Council, where councillors stood trial for
fraud in 1988, mentioned in the context of the current controversy in
Paisley.
''We represent quite the opposite system from some of the councils you
have talked about,'' he said. ''We come in on a fresh wave, an approach
which brings people in rather than excluding them. We believe we have to
be a progressive, compassionate party which breaks from some previous
attitudes.
''Our whole platform in these elections has been about changing the
way local government is delivered and creating a break with the past.
Our commitment is to produce a high- quality local government service
that is very much aimed at the need of users, in an open, communicative
style.''
Last night's Labour group meeting in Ayr would set in motion the
process of appointing a new chief official for the council, setting up a
training scheme for new councillors, and embarking on a consultation
exercise to ensure they delivered the kind of services people wanted.

THE prospect of national identity cards was delayed last night as Tory
rebels dug their heels in, claiming the cards would undermine the
campaign to safeguard British sovereignty in the European Union.
Ministers are now to do more work on a Government consultation paper
which had been expected this week.
This delay reflects Cabinet divisions on whether such cards -- last
used in the Second World War -- should reappear in the fight against
crime.
The Tory rebels on Europe who met last night were also split, but
unrepentant. They claim that identity cards will be linked inevitably to
the undermining of border controls.
Their spokesman, Sir Teddy Taylor, said: ''The Government used to be
opposed to ID cards. Now it seems that they've an open mind about ID
cards. As far as we are concerned, the only thing that has changed is
the threat to lift border controls.''
Fellow rebel John Wilkinson said: ''They could be a supplement to
effective national immigration controls but in no way could they be a
substitute for such controls.''
The green paper is being delayed for a few weeks before its
publication and it will contain no preferred Government option on the
possibilities of reintroducing ID cards.
In a way that will convince back-bench sceptics that the plan in no
way undermines the Prime Minister's trenchant view that Britain will
insist in the EU that border controls will be maintained. After that,
there will be a lengthy period of consultation, so it seems possible
that Mr Major can avoid action on IDs until the making of his next
General Election manifesto.
After a 55-minute meeting, the nine Tories off the whip issued a joint
statement which reflected the split in their ranks. One, Mr Nick Budgen,
has already declared publicly that he is in favour of ID cards. Several
others at the meeting were of the same view. The fight against crime in
this issue is more important to them than European considerations.
Nevertheless, a statement was agreed forcing the Prime Minister to
take the issue of ID cards to EU summit negotiations coming up over the
next 18 months.
The rebels stated: ''This would enable the issue of ID cards to be
considered on its merits rather than as a necessary fall-back position
related to the possibility of the removal of border controls.''
Party chairman Jeremy Hanley claimed the rebels were ''very wrong
indeed'' if they were linking weaker border controls with ID cards.
''The Prime Minister has made it clear that our position on frontier
controls is extremely strong. It has nothing to do with border
controls,'' he told a Westminster news conference.
Mr John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, also dismissed the link
made by the Tory rebels: ''I am a supporter of the EU and I am also a
very strong supporter of border controls. The question of ID cards is
nothing to do with our continued commitment to the kind of immigration
controls necessary for this country within the EU.''
Mr Tony Blair and his Shadow Cabinet are awaiting the green paper
before they announce Labour policy on this issue. ID cards could make
problems for him if he espouses them. Last night, he was content to let
the Tory rebels make the running.

A ROBBER who grabbed a shop's takings and tried to escape in a taxi,
was caught when store staff told a second taxi driver: ''Follow that
cab.''
The second driver gave chase, managed to draw level and explain to the
first driver what was happening. He locked his taxi's doors -- and Paul
Winter was trapped for the police.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday, Winter, 24, was jailed for nine
months by Sheriff Andrew Bell.
He had earlier admitted assaulting and robbing Ms Elaine Wyness of a
bank bag in Hanover Street, Edinburgh, on January 14.
The bag which Winter, of Argyle Street, Glasgow, stole contained
#3932.15 in cash and 14 cheques.
Depute-fiscal Isabel Clark told Sheriff Bell that staff from the
Jeanster shop at 89 Princes Street had gone to put the day's takings in
a bank nightsafe.
Winter came up from behind, snatched the padlocked cash bag and ran
off, chased by the store workers.
He got into a taxi in South St James Street but his pursuers also
hailed a cab, which then carried on the chase.
After being charged, Winter told police officers: ''I needed the money
for a flat, I've not got a weapon and I didn't hurt anyone, I just
snatched it and did a runner.''
Solicitor Vincent Belmonte said Winter was a first offender and the
violence involved was at the lowest end of the scale.
He suggested that a probation order with community service was
appropriate.

THE man who holds the key to the Conservatives' chances of ruling any
of Scotland's new unitary authorities will today end their agonising
wait. At the first meeting of East Renfrewshire Council, Mr Ian Pearce,
the Independent representative of the Netherlee area, could decide the
political complexion.
East Renfrewshire had been regarded by many Tories as the authority
they were most likely to control, as it includes the territory covered
by Conservative-ruled Eastwood District Council. Opponents had
complained that the drawing of the boundaries for the new authority
amounted to nothing less than gerrymandering.
However, the Tories' performance in East Renfrewshire in the local
government elections earlier this month proved to be less than
spectacular. It was not as disastrous as the results they suffered
almost everywhere else in Scotland but their dream of outright control
in what should have been their flagship authority was shattered.
When the votes were counted, there were nine Conservative members on
the new council, eight Labour, two Scottish Liberal Democrats . . . and
one Independent, Mr Pearce.
That is a breakdown which has left power very much in the balance. It
has also made Mr Pearce one of the most important and keenly-watched
figures in Scottish local politics for the time being.
Should the Independent side with the Tories -- and assuming that the
Liberal Democrats align themselves with Labour -- that would leave the
council split evenly -- and the Conservatives would have a chance of
taking control on a cut of the cards.
Last night, Mr Pearce was keeping his own cards very close to his
chest. Asked what he planned to do at today's meeting, he said: ''I have
no comment to make. I will give my decision in public at the meeting
tomorrow. It would be wrong of me to say any more meantime.''
Asked whether he had been approached by Labour and the Conservatives,
he replied: ''No approaches, as such.'' However, he added: ''They have
both put their points of view to me.''
Mr Pearce has represented the Netherlee area on Eastwood District
Council since 1988 with the support of his local residents' association,
and stood under its banner again in the unitary authority elections. He
has consulted the residents' association about the decision he will
announce today.
Leader of the new authority's Tory group is Mr Iain Drysdale,
currently Tory group leader on Strathclyde region. He said of the
prospects for today's meeting: ''There is really nothing I can tell you.
We will just have to wait and see what happens. I think it is all to
play for tomorrow.''
He added: ''I have had a meeting with the leader of the Labour group
to try to ensure that the council gets off on the right lines but we
have still got to see whether our discussions bear fruit.
''My group, having the largest number of members, is looking forward
to playing a major role in the new East Renfrewshire.''
Councillor Owen Taylor, leader of the new authority's Labour group and
currently Labour leader of Renfrew District Council, could not be
contacted for comment last night.

<HEADLINE>Plans for stronger pollution controls backed</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978813173</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Commons last night supported plans to strengthen pollution
controls after Labour said it would not oppose them in principle.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson told MPs that the
Environment Bill, which creates new environmental protection agencies,
had ''many shortcomings''.
However, he welcomed its provisions aimed at making the protection of
the environment more effective.
The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency will be established under
the proposals. The Bill also sets up the Environment Agency for England
and Wales to tackle air, water and land pollution and regulate waste
disposal.
In second reading debate on the Bill, which already has cleared the
Lords, Mr Dobson said that, as many of its proposals were in line with
Labour policy, his party did not plan to vote against the legislation.
However, he warned that the measure ''weakened the conservation
obligations of the National Rivers Authority and makes the agency's
functions subject to challenge in the courts on the grounds of cost''.
This was ''wrong and should be changed'', he said, giving notice of
Labour's intention to try to amend the Bill at a later stage.
Opening the debate earlier, Environment Secretary John Gummer hailed
the legislation as a ''very significant strengthening of our machinery
for protecting the environment and delivering sustainable development''.
He condemned ''green posturing'' by Opposition parties who he said
called for improvements to the environment but were not prepared to fund
them.
Mr Gummer insisted Britain was ''leading the pack and setting the pace
in international environmental control''.
The new agencies will replace the NRA, the Pollution Inspectorate and
local government waste regulation authorities.
The legislation contains powers to deal with pollution from abandoned
mines and creates national park authorities to run the 10 national parks
of England and Wales.
In the Lords, peers defeated the Government by backing an amendment
believed by some to effectively ban noisy sports like power-boat racing
and motorcycle riding from the national parks.
Mr Gummer last night gave no clear indication of how ministers would
deal with this move, insisting only that a balance had to be struck
between the concerns of ''single issue groups''.
He promised Government amendments to establish a national strategy for
clear air quality standards and targets for improvement.
''We are seeking to bring together a myriad of different interests in
such a way as would create a proper balance in the countryside and
town.''
It would take account of those who wanted to walk and fish as well as
those who wanted to farm.
''We don't want a situation in which one group, be they ramblers or
country landowners, have a monopoly of interest,'' Mr Gummer said.
Mr Matthew Taylor, for the Liberal Democrats, said the Bill had wide
support: ''It presents a big opportunity, not simply to integrate the
control of pollution to air, land and water but to take real steps to
protect and improve our environment.''

ONE of Scotland's biggest summer tourist attractions, the Cutty Sark
Tall Ships Race, is presenting the authorities with a major problem --
the threat of rabies.
About a million visitors and ships from all over the world are
expected in Leith between July 15 and 18.
Yesterday, Lothian's director of trading standards, Mr Mike Drewry,
told the regional council's general purposes committee that an exercise
had been held to test the region's contingency plan in view of the
possibility of rabid animals being brought ashore.
Hundreds of ships, including the QE2 and the world's biggest sailing
ship, Sedov, from Russia, will be in the Forth estuary.
Race organisers have advised participants not to bring animals with
them or ensure that they are kept on board.
They have also been advised to make sure that they are not handled by
anyone who might visit any boats.
Mr Drewry also warned that any stray animal found at the docks by
special animal health patrols would be impounded and could spend six
months in quarantine.
Assistant Chief Constable Tom Wood, of Lothian and Borders police,
said he hoped that the measures would prevent any problem.

DARTS player Jamie Harvey, who was sacked for playing in world-class
tournaments while off sick with a bad back, has lost his unfair
dismissal claim.
Mr Harvey, 39, of Netherton Drive, Barrhead, Renfrewshire, who is
ranked seventh in the world, had claimed that his sacking by
ScottishPower after 17 years was too severe.
He had been off sick for 138 days from his job, which involved heavy
manual work, when he was fired for abuse of the company's sick leave
scheme. He was on half pay at the time of his dismissal.
The Glasgow tribunal heard that he played in tournaments in Blackpool,
Canada, and Las Vegas. ScottishPower had previously given him time off
to take part in tournaments but he had not asked for permission while on
sick leave.
He told the tribunal: ''At the time, I didn't think I had to notify
the company. I thought they knew, as I had been in the same events the
year before. I didn't hide anything from them.''
Mr Harvey wanted the tribunal to order ScottishPower to give him
another job.
The tribunal has issued an advance notice, ruling that the sacking was
not unfair. Full reasons for its decision will follow in the next few
weeks.

FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd last night was accused of duplicity as
he pledged in New York that Britain would no longer manufacture
weapons-grade plutonium needed to build atomic bombs.
''I can announce today that the United Kingdom has ceased the
production of fissile material for explosive purposes,'' he told
ministers attending the UN conference to renew the 25-year-old
non-proliferation treaty on nuclear weapons.
Mr Hurd also said that, if there were massive reductions in the
nuclear arsenals of the United States and the former Soviet Union, then
Britain too would consider reducing its nuclear arsenal.
However, the thousands of nuclear warheads that each of the
superpowers hold would have to be reduced to hundreds before the UK
would be prepared to get involved, Mr Hurd told the United Nations.
The UK is now relying solely on the Trident deterrent, based on the
Clyde, Mr Hurd said in New York.
Anti-nuclear organisations, in particular Greenpeace, insisted last
night that promises made by Mr Hurd in New York were meaningless.
They pointed out that, in 1979, the UK had at its disposal 3.2 tonnes
of weapons-grade plutonium. Since that date, only 0.2 tonnes had been
manufactured.
''You can take it from that they have as much as they need for their
purposes,'' a spokesman said. ''They don't need to produce very much
more.''
Plutonium from nuclear weapons that were now being abandoned were also
being recylced into the Trident programme.
''From that alone, you can see that Mr Hurd was not making any kind of
concession.''
Greenpeace spokesmen insisted that tests in the United States had also
proved that nuclear plants such as Chapel Cross in the Borders could
produce fuel that could be converted to weapons grade.
Mr Hurd told the conference: ''At the end of this decade, the total
number of our warheads will be 21% less than in the 1970s. We are
committed to negotiating measures which will impose severe constraints
on nuclear weapons in the future,'' Mr Hurd said.

SNP leader Alex Salmond has asked trade unions to join the shadow
water committees being set up by the nationalists to monitor the three
new water quangos.
His offer is likely to be rebuffed but it is yet another indication of
the SNP's attempts to become more involved in the trade union movement.
So far, politically minded unions are solidly supportive of the Labour
Party. The SNP would like to see the ties loosened, because many union
members are SNP supporters.
The party's shadow committees will consist of councillors who will
follow closely what the new water boards are doing.
Mr Salmond said yesterday, on a visit to the congress: ''Trade unions
represent the people who work in the water industry and they have an
invaluable role to play in helping to monitor the quangos.
''SNP councillors look forward to working with their representatives
on the shadow committees.
''With common objectives over water, we have much to achieve by
working together.''
His comments were made while visiting the stalls outside the main
debating hall. As yet, his invitation to address congress still appears
to be a long way off.

A DRUNKEN reveller who stabbed another partygoer was jailed for five
years yesterday at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Robert White, 21, had ended up in the same bed as his victim after the
knife attack, with both men crying and consoling each other. His victim,
Mr John Wilson, later had to undergo life-saving emergency surgery.
Unemployed White, of Bingham Broadway, in Edinburgh, admitted
repeatedly stabbing Mr Wilson on the body with a knife to his severe
injury and to the danger of his life.
He was originally charged with attempted murder but the Crown accepted
his plea to the reduced charge.
The two men had gone together to a party at a flat in Magdalene Drive
in Edinburgh on December 27 last year.
After a lengthy drinking session, White had gone to bed drunk. Later,
he was woken up by a distressed child who said that her mother and Mr
Wilson were arguing and struggling.
White got out of bed, dressed only in his underpants, went to the
kitchen and armed himself with a knife then stabbed Mr Wilson in the
back and side. He then went back to bed.
Other drunken guests at the party helped Mr Wilson to the bedroom and
put him in bed beside White.
Defence counsel Gary Allan told the court that by this stage White was
crying. He said: ''Both ended up crying, offering one another
condolences for the situation which had arisen.''
Temporary Judge Robin McEwan, QC, told White: ''The case is certainly
unusual.
''The court always has to take a serious view of people who use
weapons, which in this case produced life-threatening injuries.''
He added: ''The whole business was, of course, aggravated by drink . .
. ''
Advocate-depute James Campbell said a considerable quantity of alcohol
had been consumed at the party.
Mr Campbell said White had feared the woman was in danger and had gone
for the knife before attacking the man.
Mr Wilson was later taken to hospital where he had surgery for
internal bleeding from a severed artery.
Mr Campbell said medical evidence had showed that the stab wound to Mr
Wilson's side could have been fatal if not treated promptly.

THE father of toddler Jasmine Dodds, back in Scotland with her mother
after an acrimonious custody battle in Texas, pledged last night: ''I'll
see my daughter grow up come hell or high water.''
Speaking from his home in Austin, Texas, Mr Marcus Chapman said: ''I
am entitled to see my daughter and I will see my daughter. My
understanding is she should not have left Texas until all the civil
proceedings were completed and they are not.''
Ms Sarah Dodds, 31, returned unexpectedly to Scotland on Monday with
two-year-old Jasmine, having left Texas without telling Mr Chapman, her
former boyfriend and the father of the child, that she was leaving.
His mother, Mrs Lawilda Chapman, the headmistress of an elementary
(primary) school in Woodville, Texas, said: ''We are going to fight this
custody case. We were surprised to discover Jasmine had been taken away.
''Jasmine has an advanced ear infection, about which my son had twice
taken her to see the doctor. She was on antibiotics and had been due to
attend the doctor again today.''
Mrs Chapman said they were extremely concerned about Jasmine's welfare
and worried that she would be brought up with immoral values.
''All we want is a relationship with Jasmine but Sarah does not want
us to know her. I was delighted when my son brought Sarah home and said
she was pregnant but Sarah disliked me for some reason. I tried
everything to get along with her. I bought her clothes, I bought her
furniture, but there is only so much you can do. She is a very unusual
person.''
Mr Chapman said he had never intended for the custody battle to become
so acrimonious. He said his lawyer had suggested initially that he ask
Sarah to meet the terms of the Texas Family Code, which he said were the
minimum visiting rights a parent who did not get custody would be
entitled to, but she had refused.
''I am entitled to see Jasmine for six weeks in the summer and every
other Christmas,'' he said.
''My lawyer said, 'Offer her the terms of the Texas Family Code
immediately and save yourself a whole bunch of money and a whole bunch
of grief and you will get the minimum, anyway', and that's what I did.
But she refused.
''I have spent $50,000 or $60,000 in this two-year court battle.''
It is eight months since Ms Dodds and Jasmine left Scotland with no
idea of the trauma ahead -- which included Ms Dodds' spending Christmas
in a Californian jail after trying to flee with Jasmine when an American
court awarded custody to the father and his parents.
The couple met in 1991 and Jasmine was born in May 1992. In February
1993, they moved to Woodville, Texas, near his parents. Shortly
afterwards, the couple split. Ms Dodds returned to the UK but was
ordered to return to the US for a custody hearing in August 1994.
In February this year, a jury in Austin, Texas, eventually decided
that Jasmine's proper place was with her mother and her grandmother,
Forres horse dealer Flora Dempster.
Mrs Dempster had flown to America to support her daughter and, after
the court success, returned to Scotland. Ms Dodds had to remain in Texas
until the maintenance dispute was resolved and, although it is still not
completed, a judge gave her authority to leave the state with Jasmine at
the weekend.
Ms Dodds claimed she was so scared that Mr Chapman might try to
prevent her leaving with Jasmine, she told him she was taking their
daughter for a doctor's appointment and then fled the country.
She said any maintenance money Mr Chapman paid her -- she was seeking
$3000 a month -- would go from his bank account straight to the lawyers,
to whom she owed $120,000.
''We will be staying with my mother initially until we can get some
rented accommodation sorted out,'' she said. ''Then the priority will be
to get a job -- any job -- just to get some money.
''This case has cost me a fortune but I do still have my daughter and
that's the main thing.
''Jasmine looks very happy now, although she has asked about her
father once or twice.
''There is still a lot to clear up in America and I have had to leave
it all in the hands of my attorneys.''
Jasmine's grandmother gave her a surprise early third birthday present
when she arrived in Scotland -- a pony called Pip.

THE 600 workers facing the sack at Rolls-Royce in East Kilbride begin
strike action today with the full backing of the Scottish Trades Union
Congress.
The workers in the company's aero engine research and development
department will stop work for 36 hours, escalating further in a bid
force the company to reverse the closure decision.
Overtime will also stop. In response, the company has threatened to
remove the workers' enhanced redundancy terms.
At the STUC yesterday, the Rolls-Royce shop stewards were heartened by
the enthusiastic support of delegates to their campaign to save the
jobs.
Speakers attacked the Scottish Office Ministers for doing nothing to
intervene in the decision. Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the
white collar union MSF, wondered if Rolls-Royce's #70,000 donation to
the Tory Party had anything to do with Government inaction.
''Scottish Office Ministers will never be forgiven for aiding and
abetting this scorched- earth policy,'' he declared.
Delegates passed an emergency motion condemning the closure as
unacceptable and wholeheartedly supporting the campaign of industrial
action.
ONE of the last remaining purely Scottish unions is likely to become
part of the giant public service union Unison.
The executive of the Scottish Health Visitors Association has agreed
in principle to transferring to Unison.
Although Unison describes the move as a merger, it is not one of equal
parts. Unison has 1.3m members throughout Britain while the SHVA has
only 840 members. It will now ballot them over the move.
If the move goes through, it will leave only five Scottish-only unions
affiliated to the STUC. However, being purely Scottish has not deterred
the Educational Institute of Scotland which is one of a very few number
of unions which has recorded an increase in membership. At 50,000
members, it is now the fifth largest union in Scotland.
A YOUNG woman brandished bottles of heavily alcoholic designer drinks
at conference yesterday, claiming they were part of the exploitation of
young people.
Ms Karen Turnbull, chairperson of the STUC's youth committee, held up
drinks such as Dynamite and Mad Dog. She said: ''These drinks are
subject to heavy advertising -- advertising that plays on the
vulnerability and alienation of young people -- a vulnerability and
alienation directly caused by a Tory Government who have systematically
driven down young people and removed their rights.''
Exploitation of young people was all too common, she said, and came in
many forms. The young needed the help of strong trade unions but unions
themselves needed fresh young blood and there was a problem of unions
not being effective at attracting the young, she added.

HEALTH chiefs who dealt with the disclosure at Christmas that a
Glasgow consultant surgeon had the Aids virus have rejected the idea of
compulsory testing for health-care workers.
Their recommendation is contained in a 55-page report on the case of
Professor George Browning, a leading ear, nose, and throat surgeon in
Glasgow, published by Greater Glasgow Health Board.
The professor has since returned to work and been ''welcomed by his
patients''.
Compulsory testing has already been rejected by the Department of
Health in guidelines issued for the handling of such incidents and Dr
Harry Burns, the board's director of public health, said demands for its
introduction would lead surgeons to demand testing for patients.
''I speak with some feeling on this because as a surgeon I operated on
a number of people I knew to be HIV positive and presumably others I did
not know of. The risk of transmission from patient to surgeon is much
greater than from surgeon to patient.''
Apart from the case of a Florida dentist -- about which there has been
some dubiety -- there was no known case of a patient being infected by a
surgeon.
Professor Browning is unnamed in the report, which nevertheless
praises his courage for foregoing his right to confidentiality --
simplifying the management of the incident, reassuring the patients of
other surgeons, and quashing speculation about a colleague who had been
wrongly named by newspapers.
It states that, after he was diagnosed on December 22, a stored sample
of blood -- taken when he previously underwent a coronary angiogram --
was also tested and proved HIV positive.
Professor Browning, 54, said the angiography had taken place last June
and that yesterday was the first he had heard of the positive finding,
the earliest marker available as to how long he had been infected.
A total of 580 people telephoned a special helpline during the three
weeks of its operation, and 642 patients operated on by Professor
Browning over the past 10 years were contacted by letter, reassuring
them of the low risk of transmission and offering individual counselling
if they wished.
Dr Burns said that 26 had attended the counselling clinic, 18 were
tested for HIV, and all were negative.
Before the letters went out, he added, the names were checked against
the Registrar General's records and it was ascertained that 35 were dead
-- none from an HIV-associated illness.
Although this extended the process by two days Dr Burns felt it was
time well spent, saving the families concerned needless distress.
However, he admitted that the board had been forced to go public
sooner and set up the helpline before the letters had been sent, rather
than afterwards as recommended in national guidelines, because of the
early media interest in the affair.
Professor Browning returned to work last month but no longer operates
on patients or carries out other invasive procedures. He is involved in
out-patient clinics and teaching, and has just returned from a lecture
tour in Pakistan.
At the end of an out-patient clinic at the Royal Infirmary, he said:
''My clinics are very busy: my patients have been fine, they have
welcomed me back, and no-one has objected so far.
''I can't criticise the board officials, or the way they handled the
matter, and I agree there would be no point in having compulsory
testing. You would have to do it repeatedly and if you have never had
anyone infected then the costs would be horrendous in relation to what
would be achieved.''
The patients involved have since been surveyed by board officials to
determine their level of satisfaction with the way the incident was
handled. The results so far indicate that most of them preferred
receiving a letter from the hospital concerned -- the Royal, or
Gartnavel General -- rather than being told by their GP.

KEN SMITH reports from the STUC at Perth
TRADE unions yesterday laid out their shopping list of what they
expect from an incoming Labour Government.
It is a list with an expensive price tag.
STUC General Secretary Campbell Christie even suggested workers being
put on a four-day week, with no loss of pay, in order to create
thousands of extra jobs.
A lengthy debate on the economy yesterday saw the unions demanding
full employment, a specific national minimum wage, taking back into
public control privatised utilities, and massive Government investment
in education, infrastructure, and training.
They also want a shift in taxation back from the poor to the rich, and
more Government intervention in interest rates and the economy.
If Labour was expecting the unions to moderate their demands in the
run-up to the next election, then it will be sorely disappointed.
While the party is unwilling to put specific prices on any of its
proposals, the unions are not so squeamish.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the huge general workers' union,
GMB, claimed it would cost #6000m to take people off the dole and back
to work. He ironically conceded that it was an ''awful lot of money --
enough to frighten a Labour Chancellor''.
Nevertheless, he went on: ''An awful lot of money until you remember
that the total cost of introducing the Poll Tax and the scrapping of it
was not #6000m but #20,000m.
''An awful lot of money until you remember that #6000m is almost
exactly the size of the mistakes that Kenneth Clark made in calculating
the Budget deficit.''
On the face of it, there may be little difference between what the
unions and Labour want. Both want a national minimum wage and full
employment. Where they differ is that the unions want a specific figure
for a minimum wage -- somewhere between #3.70 and #4.15 an hour -- and
want specific proposals to create jobs rather than just vague
principles.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers
union, said a #4 an hour minimum wage would at a stroke transform the
lives of the working poor.
''The critics tell us that the nation cannot afford a statutory
minimum wage. But who are these critics? Exactly the same fat cats who
every single day keep wallowing in their share options while telling the
working poor that #4 an hour cannot be afforded.
''We say to them, 'You try living and bringing up a family on #4 an
hour and see how you get on'.''
Mr Campbell Christie conceded that employers would resist putting
their workers on a four-day week but claimed their opposition would be
for political rather than economic reasons.
He argued: ''They know that if work becomes less important in people's
lives, and their time is freed up, they will begin to think more about
the way society is organised, and in whose interest the economy is run.
''Workers will be less like appendages to machines and more like
people.''
He continued: ''Many industrialists will argue that a four-day working
week would dull our competitive edge. Let me say that, in my view,
productivity would sky-rocket.
''Our industries would benefit from having a less stressed- out
workforce. It is one of the contradictions of our society that
two-thirds of the population are stressed out, due to over-work, whilst
a third are stressed out due to under-employment, unemployment or
poverty.''
The unions fear that the public is increasingly accepting that high
levels of unemployment are here to stay. They argue that full employment
is still achievable.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH trade unionists were told bluntly by Labour's Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson yesterday that getting the backing for the
party's new Clause 4 was ''serious, grown-up politics''.
The new wording of the party's aims which party leader Tony Blair is
seeking was not some ''grand word game'', he said, but about telling the
world outside of conferences and committee meetings that Labour can be
entrusted with their future and with the country.
He was wanting to impress upon the unions how important it was to
Labour that its aims were modernised in order to win over voters, and he
did not shrink from defending the party's changes.
He reminded delegates at the Scottish TUC's annual conference that
they could not assume that Labour would automatically win the election
because the Tories were so unpopular. They had made that mistake in the
past.
Mr Robertson also wants the unions to be patient. He understands that
they want specific commitments from Labour but he wants them to
recognise the problems of the last General Election, when Labour made
too many commitments in too much detail which were then used by
opponents against them.
''This next election is there for the winning -- but only if we work
for it and if we get and keep the trust of those who did not come with
us in those last four lost elections,'' he declared.
Taking a swipe at the current Clause 4, he told them that the new
wording was about ''getting over our intentions and our convictions --
and our passions, too -- in the language of the late 1990s and not the
vocabulary of 1918.''
He added: ''We will not be elected on vague promises, pasted over by
grand sentiments, designed for a distant era, which never, ever said
what we really meant.''
He tried to woo the delegates by emphatically stating that Labour
would pursue the case for a national minimum wage with ''rigour and with
conviction'', describing it as a ''real vote-winner''.
However, in line with party policy, Mr Robertson would put no figure
on what a minimum wage would be set at, again disappointing delegates
who want Labour to be specific.
So far, Mr Tony Blair's re-writing of Clause 4 has received the
setback of the public service union Unison's voting against it.
Mr George Robertson says that in local constituency parties there is
overwhelming support for change, and implies that unions should consult
more with their lay members.
A number of the unions will not take a final decision on Clause 4
until the actual day of Labour's special conference on the subject at
the end of the month, ensuring that its future will be in doubt right to
the last minute.

A North-East dentist who
molested a woman patient while she was under anaesthetic was jailed
yesterday for three months at Stonehaven Sheriff Court.
Michael Evans, who is likely to be struck off, clutched his stomach
and was visibly shaken as the sentence was handed down.
The married man had earlier admitted indecently assaulting the young
woman at his surgery in Banchory, Kincardineshire, in January of this
year.
Evans, 27, had groped her right breast and touched her pubic hair as
she came round from the anaesthetic.
As she left the surgery, he had tried to force her to touch his groin.
The court heard yesterday that Evans, of Davidson Drive, Inverurie,
near Aberdeen, could offer no explanation for his behaviour.
''He said to police at the time that it was a spur of the moment
thing. He told them, 'I do not know what come over me.' And that has
been his position ever since,'' said his counsel, Frances McMenamin.
She denied the attack had been planned by Evans, who had told his
patient he would prefer to put her to sleep for the treatment, gave her
an evening appointment, and sent his nurse away during the course of the
work.
''The only reason she was offered an evening appointment was that he
was going on holiday shortly after and she was working during the day.
''She was offered the opportunity of having an evening appointment so
that she could have the treatment in one go because she was terrified of
going to the dentist,'' added Mrs McMenamin.
''I in no way wish to minimise the gravity of this matter. He does not
shrink from that but I cannot explain why he did what he did,'' the
advocate continued.
The court heard that Evans's wife, who gave birth to a daughter nine
months ago, suffers from depression. Despite his actions, he has the
full support of his wife, and his father-in-law was with him in court.
''When the baby was born, he was trying to find his feet
professionally and had a substantial loan hanging over him for setting
up the practice,'' said Mrs McMenamin.
Urging Sheriff Alexander Pollock to put her client on probation, the
advocate said whatever action the court took would not be the end of
matter.
She said the General Dental Council would discuss the case within the
next few months and it was expected he would be struck off.
''It is going to follow him around for the rest of his life. It is
only the beginning of a long road and a very lonely road for Mr Evans to
walk along,''added Mrs McMenamin.
Sheriff Alexander Pollock told Evans: ''The charge involved is one
which has involved a gross breach of trust, a breach of trust involving
someone from the public who is entitled to expect the highest standards
of behaviour at all times,'' said Sheriff Pollock.
''I have come to the view that due to the gravity of the case and the
conduct involved that the public interest requires a custodial
disposal.''
The Crown had earlier accepted a not guilty plea from Evans in respect
of a similar charge involving a different woman, in July last year.

POLICE investigating the murder of nine-year-old Daniel Handley think
he may have died at the hands of paedophiles whose sexual activities
went wrong.
They confirmed yesterday that remains found last month in a shallow
grave in Bristol were Daniel's.
He was last seen on October 2, 1994, near his home in Beckton, east
London.
Detective Superintendent Edwin Williams told a news conference in
London yesterday that fragments of the red boiler suit which Daniel was
wearing when he disappeared had been recovered, as well as a decorative
patch sewn on to a breast pocket.
He said the area where Daniel's remains were discovered was a
''forensic nightmare'' but he hoped it would yield some evidence.
Daniel's mother Maxine and her partner, Alexander Joseph, made a
television appeal for his safe return during the six-month hunt.
The couple were arrested during the investigation but released. They
are due to appear before magistrates in east London later this month on
child sex charges.
Police refuse to put a figure on the number of children who might have
been killed in similar circumstancesbut some detectives fear that as
many as 20 could have been kidnapped and killed by paedophile rings and
their bodies hidden in unmarked graves.
The true scale of the horrific practice began to emerge after an
investigation called Operation Orchid was set up in the wake of the
Jason Swift case. Jason, 14, a rent boy, was drugged, sexually abused,
and suffocated during an attack by a gang of up to eight men in an east
London flat in 1985. His body was dumped in an Essex wood.
Police believe Daniel was snatched by two men who drove him to the
scene of his grave at Bradley Stoke North, Bristol, shortly afterwards.
A child fitting Daniel's description was seen talking to a man by the
open rear door of a silver or grey car on the day he was last seen
alive. A second man was in the driver's seat.
Shortly afterwards, Daniel's BMX bike was found abandoned nearby in
Beckton.
Mr Williams appealed to the two men to come forward.
''I find it difficult to accept that two men set out that day, both
with the intention of murdering Daniel. It is more likely that Daniel
was taken for sexual purposes and that something went dramatically
wrong.
''How Daniel died, or why Daniel died, are facts known only to one or
two people. Did things go much further than you bargained for? I need
the answers to these questions and more than anything else I need to
prevent other children being placed at risk.
''You, too, may now be afraid -- too afraid to seek proper help or to
talk to me. But you must talk to me before these events are repeated and
another innocent child is hurt. Think carefully about what I have said
and you will find the courage to contact me.''

THE American widow of an executive killed in the Lockerbie bombing was
awarded a record $19m in compensation yesterday.
There was a welcome in Britain to the news but a warning that such a
sum would not be repeated here.
Mrs Faith Pescatore, 37, wept when the federal jury in New York
announced its decision. Her attorney, Mr Aaron Broder, said the ruling
against PanAm was the largest airline disaster award given to one
person.
Mrs Pescatore's husband Michael, 33, was one of 270 killed on Flight
103 in 1988.
Last night, Glasgow solicitor Peter Watson, secretary of the Lockerbie
Air Disaster Group, the legal consortium representing British relatives
of those on board the flight, said he welcomed the ruling as it would
encourage PanAm's insurers to negotiate a settlement with UK relatives
as soon as possible.
''We see this as positive news if for no other reason than to bring
this sad case to a swift end for the relatives affected by it,'' he
said.
Mr Watson, currently lecturing at Nova University in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, on the Lockerbie litigation, said the families could not
properly grieve until their compensation claims were settled. He pointed
out that each case would be settled individually.
Dr Jim Swire, spokesman of the UK Relatives Group, said it would be
another 12 to 18 months before the British cases were heard. He added
that PanAm could appeal against yesterday's court decision over the next
10 days.
''The British victims, however, cannot hope to receive such a large
amount. Many of them did not lose their breadwinner and in other cases
the loss of earnings would not be as big as in the US case.''
Mrs Pescatore's attorney, who represents the families of four other
victims, said the award against PanAm and Alert Management Systems, a
security firm, included $9m for loss of income, $5m for loss of
companionship, and $5m in interest.
Mr Michael Pescatore was a London-based vice president for British
Petroleum Chemicals of America, earning $118,000 a year.
After the two-week trial in the US Federal Court in Uniondale, Long
Island, New York, Mrs Pescatore said it had been a terrible ordeal. ''My
lawyer and the US relatives group have been wonderful during this very
difficult time. I cannot thank them enough.''
Yesterday's record award was in marked contrast with compensation
given to the relatives of the 11 Lockerbie residents who died on the
ground. They settled out court within two years of the disaster. Their
claims have never been made public but they are reported to have
received a total of #16m.
Mr Stephen Flanagan and his brother David, who lost their parents and
young sister, were said to have received a total of more than #2m but
others received less than #20,000 and feel bitter about the huge damages
awarded in the US.
Mr Tom Corrie, 58, who lost his 82-year aunt, Miss Jean Murray, said
last night: ''My sister and I, who were her only relatives, received a
total of $45,000, which worked out at about #11,000 each, less 25% in
fees.''
Mr Corrie, who lives at Clovenfords, Selkirkshire, added: ''I know my
aunt was an old lady but I don't think age should have anything to do
with it. I was very close to her and I suffered a lot of trauma. I am
now on invalidity and I have horrific nightmares. I never go back to
Lockerbie now.
''It holds such terrible memories. I went once to see the spot where
my aunt's house stood in Sherwood Crescent. It was an awful feeling. Not
one particle of her body was found.''
Mr Corrie, married with a grown-up son and daughter, said he had
consulted a QC to find out if he could re-open his claim. ''I was told
it was not possible as I had agreed to a full and final settlement.
Maybe that's the legal position but there are also moral
considerations.''
He said he had received no payment from the Lockerbie Disaster Fund,
which was set up to help victims' relatives.

A SCHOOLBOY with a brilliant academic record is at the centre of a row
over the procedures Glasgow University uses to select medical students.
Conor O'Reilly's hopes of studying to be a doctor at Glasgow
University were dashed when his application was rejected by the medical
faculty -- despite having six Higher passes at band A.
The 16-year-old, whose results greatly exceed those of the majority of
successful candidates, was told there was no place for him after what
his family says was an interview lasting five minutes.
Yesterday, his father, Mr Brian O'Reilly, a prominent Glasgow medical
consultant and honorary lecturer at the university, attacked the
selection process. He said he believed his son might have been
discriminated against because of his excellent academic qualifications.
''The university has given us no reasons for the refusal and we can
only guess at them. They have told me that they don't want too many
academics in medicine and that they are in the business of producing
ordinary doctors.''
Mr O'Reilly has met the Principal, Sir William Kerr Fraser, and
lobbied every member of the medical faculty in his unsuccessful fight to
have the decision reconsidered.
''The medical faculty have admitted to me that they often make
mistakes but they have also told me that they have never changed their
minds on an interview decision,'' he said.
''The interview was exceedingly brief, giving Conor the impression
that a decision had already been made about his application. I strongly
feel that the present interview policy is unjust and discriminates
against the modest candidate.''
Mr O'Reilly said it was wrong to base a decision which would determine
a potential student's career on such a limited impression of the
candidate's abilities. ''If you went for a summer job packing shelves in
Safeway you would get more than a five-minute interview.''
Conor, a pupil at St Aloysius College, has had acceptances from all
four other medical schools in Scotland but his father said he had set
his sights on Glasgow.
''He has strong links with Glasgow University and it has always been
his wish to continue his education here. I feel he has been caught up in
faculty politics and a five-minute subjective assessment should not
result in the university shutting its doors on one of Glasgow's best,''
he said.
Conor, who will be 17 next week, has exam results which put him in the
top 0.2% of Scots pupils. His application was augmented by a glowing
report from his school and evidence of a wide range of extra curricular
activities.
Speaking at his parent's home in Newlands, Glasgow, yesterday he said
he was ''disappointed'' at his rejection and felt his interviewers were
unfriendly.
''Every time I answered a question, they looked at each other and I
felt I was saying something wrong.''
A university spokesman said it was not the university's policy to
comment on the cases of individual applicants. He added that if Conor
wrote to the university, a statement of reasons for refusal would be
given to him.
The spokesman said 10 minutes was the normal period for an interview
and stated a further 21 students with A passes had been turned down for
admission this year. ''Admission to the faculty of medicine is not based
on academic qualifications alone.
''The admission criteria consists of four elements: academic results,
the school report, a personal written statement by the applicant, and
the interview. High academic achievement alone does not guarantee a
place and this is made plain in the university prospectus.
''Each year, there are 2000 applications for 234 places. It follows
that the majority of applicants don't get a place.''

THE M77 protesters yesterday fired their first shots in an attempt to
open up a new front in their battle against motorways.
Three people from the self-styled Pollok Free State presented a model
of a new camp -- the Auchenshuggle Free State -- to Glasgow City
Council's planning department.
They asked for it to be added to the scale model of the M74 extension
currently being displayed as part of the consultation process for the
#200m development.
''We thought we'd better make their model accurate,'' said Sally
Robertson, who has lived at the Pollok encampment. ''For if this road
gets the go ahead, we'll be moving into Auchenshuggle Woods straight
away to try and stop it.''
The model features one protester prostrate before a toy bulldozer,
while a line of painted gun-toting soldiers, representing security
guards, menace other protesters ensconced in model trees.
There is a toy helicopter and some placards, proclaiming amongst other
things: Free Allan Stewart -- a reference to the former Scottish Office
Minister who faces charges for his part in an alleged fracas with
protesters.
The objectors said they wished the model to be lodged as part of their
objection to the M74 proposal, which is understood to skirt
Auchenshuggle Woods.
The model was greeted with confusion from planning department staff,
who admitted this was the first time they'd come across an objection
lodged in such a fashion.
In a good-humoured, light-hearted exchange, the council's chief
planning officer Mr Donald Jamie listened while one protester pointed
out the various features of the model camp, and then he accepted the
model as a submission in the consultation process.
Although one protester admitted that yesterday's action was ''rather
twee'', he pledged that they would exploit the momentum and exposure
created by the Pollok protest in their fight against the proposed M74
extension, a decision on which is expected from the city council's
planning committee by June.
The council has received 620 responses in the consultation process
thus far, with only 40 representations in favour of the #200m motorway,
which stretches from Fullarton Road in the East End to just south of the
Kingston Bridge.
The costs involved in removing the two churches, seven listed
industrial buildings, 100 commercial properties, and 27 homes in the
line of the proposed extension are expected to add about #50m to the
final bill.
The benefits of the development have been cited by Strathclyde region
as the removal of 90,000 vehicles a day from the city's streets,
particularly in the east end and in the Rutherglen area, where traffic
flows in Main Street would be expected to halve.
The region also says it would reduce flows on the M8 between
Baillieston and Charing Cross in the city centre by about 30,000
vehicles a day.
The long-term spin-offs are additionally expected to include making
the West of Scotland more attractive to major inward investors and
improving accessibility to facilities such as Glasgow Airport and the
Mossend Eurofreight terminal.
If approved, the three-lane motorway would be completed in about five
years, subject to funding and Scottish Office approval.

LABOUR MP Irene Adams last night stepped up the pressure on the
Government over the allegations about drugs and money laundering in
Paisley, despite disclosing there had been threats to her family.
The Paisley North MP, who has put herself in the forefront of the
fight against drugs in the area, tabled 14 parliamentary questions on
the matter, in which she demanded answers about the ''Scottish
Office-led Ferguslie Park Partnership'', and FCB Enterprise Security
Ltd.
Mrs Adams has alleged that FCB is being used as a front for ''illegal
activities''. Those close to the matter say she has ''taken leave of her
senses''.
Strathclyde Police has confirmed it is undertaking an investigation
into FCB at Paisley's Ferguslie Park, and last night Mrs Adams called on
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to answer questions about the supervision of
FCB Securities, its holding companies, and its external auditors.
She also wants to know whether the Secretary of State will specify the
scope of any investigation which has been or is being conducted by the
Charity Commissioners into FCB and its holding companies, and when any
such report is likely to be published.
Mrs Adams is following the money. She wants to know, among other
things, whether the Secretary of State will detail the amount going from
Scottish Office sources into the Ferguslie Park Partnership and was, or
is made available to FCB Securities.
The MP flew to London last night leaving behind warnings that she was
acting foolishly, but she defiantly declared at Westminster: ''It is my
job and it is a duty to my constituents. If they come forward and
express their grave concerns it would be remiss of me not to bring them
forward. I would not be doing my duty if I did not express my concerns
in Parliament.''
On the threats to her family, Mrs Adams disclosed that about three
weeks ago her student daughter Kirsty, 21, had been approached from
behind in a Paisley nightclub and told: ''Your mother had better shut up
or will suffer the consequences.''
Her son-in-law, Mr Mark MacMillan, was soon after told by three men in
a Paisley pub: ''We know where you are, where you live and who you work
for. All this had better stop.''
Three separate inquiries have been launched into the activities of the
community business at the centre of the allegations. The police,
Strathclyde Regional Council and the Scottish Labour Party are
investigating various involvements of FCB. A further two inquiries could
be under way by the end of this week.
Last night it was announced that an emergency meeting of the board of
directors of FCB would be held this morning to discuss the allegations,
which are strenuously denied.
During the past two days The Herald has revealed the concern
surrounding the community business which is funded by Renfrew District
Council, the regional council, and the Scottish Office and run by Labour
Party members.
FCB Enterprise Security Ltd was set up with #195,000 of public money
and formed as part of the #47m revitalisation of Ferguslie Park. The
company guards building sites and other properties.
Two local Labour councillors, Mrs Olga Clayton (Renfrew District
Council) and Mr Harry Revie (Strathclyde Regional Council), are members
of its board of directors.
Mr John McIntyre, co-ordinator of the Ferguslie Park Partnership, is
also a director of the FCB group's holding company and secretary of the
Craigielea Ward Labour Party.
Mrs Adams has asked Mr Lang to conduct a full audit of the financial
activities of the security firm and its parent company, Ferguslie Park
Community Holdings, and to disclose details of the firm's employees and
the contracts it has been awarded.
She also claims that she has received information that FCB has been
used as a front for illegal activities in Paisley.
Mrs Adams also alleges that manipulation of the Craigielea branch of
the Labour Party has taken place with appointments of 14 new members
funded by one individual.
She claimed it was part of an orchestrated move to put key Labour
activists in positions of power in Ferguslie.
Her concerns have been supported by Mr Con O'Driscoll, the secretary
of Renfrew District Labour Party. He claims 140 new Labour Party members
in the area had their memberships paid by one senior Labour Party
individual, showing the level to which activists were prepared to go to
control vital interests.
Mr Revie said the rift within the Labour Party in Renfrewshire had
reached new depths and claimed that to make a link in ''any way with
gangland warfare is absolute garbage''.
He claimed that last year's suspension of the Craigielea branch had
been as a result of Mrs Adam's supporters within Paisley North Labour
Party exacting revenge after they had lost their power base in
Ferguslie.
He said that inquiries by the Scottish Labour Party had given the
branch ''a clean bill of health'' and it had been reconstituted last
December.
However, the senior Labour Party source told The Herald that the party
had known about the issue for more than a year, but it was left and
there were hopes it would go away: now it has caught up with it.
Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party,
said yesterday he was first made aware of the complaints within the
local Labour Party five months ago and had acted immediately. Following
further accusations a full investigation into all aspects of party
activity in the Renfrew area was launched immediately following the
recent Scottish council elections.
He said any allegations that he knew about problems at FCB and within
the local Labour Party more than a year ago bore ''no relation to the
facts whatsoever''.
Strathclyde Police is undertaking inquiries into various reports
surrounding FCB, while also following numerous lines of inquiry
following a recent murder in Linwood and drug-related shootings in
Paisley.

THE captain of the catamaran ferry Saint-Malo, which was holed off
Jersey on Monday, had his pilotage licence suspended yesterday by the
island's port authority.
Captain Philippe Penau is banned from taking vessels into Jersey
harbours without a pilot on board. He has held the licence for almost
five years and has to make 36 island trips each year to retain it.
Jersey Harbourmaster, Captain Roy Bullen, said yesterday: ''Whether
that suspension lasts or will be lifted depends on the findings of the
inquiry.''
According to one report, Captain Penau, 35, worked at least three
14-hour shifts on successive days before the holing.
0 However, the owner of the ferry, Mr Frederick Avierinos, managing
director and chairman of French ferry company Channiland, said Captain
Penau had been working ''according to the manning hours of the company
and in accordance with French maritime regulations''.
Meanwhile, two inspectors from the Department of Transport's marine
accident investigation branch have been appointed to head the
investigation into the incident.
A total of 296 passengers and seven crew had to abandon the Saint-Malo
when it struck a rock while sailing through a narrow sea channel off the
Corbiere lighthouse, about a mile from the Jersey coast.
Police said 100 passengers received medical treatment after leaping
20ft on to liferafts as the catamaran keeled over.
About 20 of the 32 admitted to hospital are still being treated for
broken bones.
The DoT inspectors are conducting the inquiry on behalf of the Jersey
Harbours and Airports Committee. It is believed the French authorities
have also launched an inquiry.
Witnesses said they saw the Saint-Malo take a wrong course through the
channel, known as Small Boat Passage, before hitting the submerged rock.
At low tide yesterday, sightseers flocked around the vessel, which is
stranded on the beach at St Aubin Bay, where it was towed on Monday
night.
Channiland engineers hope to refloat the vessel so it can be taken to
France for repairs.
Police who were questioning Capt Penau and his crew dismissed
suggestions of a criminal investigation at this stage but would not rule
out criminal charges later.

A MALE nurse who worked with young, physically-disabled people was
struck off the nursing register yesterday after he was found guilty of
sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old girl in his home.
Mr William Warnock was found guilty of professional misconduct because
he had conducted himself in a ''shameless and indecent manner'' by the
Professional Conduct Committee of the United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting.
Committee chairwoman Mrs Elizabeth Rush said Mr Warnock's name would
be removed from the register. She said the committee had considered
whether the removal should be for a specified period of time, but had
decided this was not appropriate.
Mr Warnock, who worked at Broomhill Hospital, Kirkintilloch, did not
attend the hearing but admitted the allegations made against him.
The committee heard that the incidents of sexual misconduct took place
between January 1 and February 29, 1992, in Mr Warnock's house.
The committee heard details of his sexual misconduct ''in camera''.
Miss McKay said: ''When the matter before the committee became known
(by the hospital authorities) he was invited to a disciplinary hearing.
He failed to attend and was dismissed.''
Meawhile, an enrolled nurse with almost 20 years' experience with
Dumfries and Galloway Health Board was cautioned and found guilty of
misconduct by the same committee, but not struck off the nursing
register.
The committee found that Mrs Rachel West, an enrolled nurse at the
Crichton Royal Hospital in Dumfries, had walked a patient who had
symptoms indicating a fractured neck of femur (or broken hip) back to
bed in the knowledge that she was causing the patient, referred to as
Miss S T, unnecessary pain.
Mrs West told the committee she believed she had acted in the
patient's best interest at the time and that she was therefore not
guilty of professional misconduct.
However, she accepted a separate charge that she had recorded
inaccurate information in the ward report and accident form regarding
the incident.
Mr Brian Toner, who at the time of the incident on the night of
November 13/14, 1992, was director of nursing services with Dumfries and
Galloway Health Board, told the committee that Mrs West had worked in
Browne ward, a psycho-geriatric ward.
He told the committee that Mrs Ward had been sleeping on an empty bed
in the ward during a break when she was called by a nursing assistant to
attend Miss S.T., an elderly patient who could not speak properly, who
had fallen in the day-room, some distance and down two short flights of
steps from her bed.
Mr Toner said that at an internal disciplinary hearing, following
which she was dismissed, Mrs West said that the patient was not able to
''weight-bear'' and that this admission contradicted the ''actions
subsequently taken by her to lift her by the arm and walk her back to
bed''.
He said that in an ideal situation, the patient should have been made
comfortable where she had fallen, any other patients nearby taken back
to bed, and the duty doctor and an ambulance called.
Committee chairwoman Mrs Rush told Mrs West, who has been working as a
care assistant in a nursing home for the past eight months: ''The
committee has decided that although your actions are regarded as
professional misconduct your name should not be withdrawn from the
register.
''In reaching this decision the committee does not condone or excuse
your past actions in any way.''

A MOUNTED police officer has been injured by his horse, which reared,
threw him, and then slipped on top of him.
PC Gordon Alexander, 42, from Peebleshire, had been exercising his
seven-year-old gelding, Reiver, in the paddock area of Lothian and
Borders HQ at Fettes in Edinburgh.
He was trapped beneath the horse, which weighs half a tonne, and
suffered severe back injuries. He was taken to the city's Royal
Infirmary.
Constable Alexander, who has been a police officer for 18 years, four
of them in the mounted section, sustained two fractured vertebrae.
Police said the horse was uninjured.

A POLICE constable died of gunshot wounds last night after being
called to a ''domestic disturbance''.
The 28-year-old officer, who has not been named, died at the Royal
London Hospital in Whitechapel at 10.10pm, about 90 minutes after being
shot in the chest at a private address in Ilford, east London.
A 35-year-old colleague, who was shot in the hand at the home in
Empress Avenue, was also taken to hospital, but was released after
treatment.
The dead policeman was treated at the scene by paramedics before being
taken to hospital.
Superintendent Barry Vincent said two men were arrested outside the
house and were being questioned.
The incident began at 8.30pm when police were called to the
end-of-terrace house.
Ten minutes later there was an urgent call for help after the two
officers were shot.
Neighbours Anthony Lipman, 20, and Philip Silverman, 21, both
barristers' clerks, joked about gunshots when they heard the bangs.
Mr Lipman said: ''We looked outside and saw somebody lying on the
ground. He was surrounded by police and paramedics.''
Police, some of them armed, were still surrounding the building late
last night.
Scotland Yard said the constables had been called to the address in
connection with a ''domestic incident'', but said that the exact
circumstances of the incident were not clear.
A handgun was recovered from the scene of the shooting.
Scotland Yard said early this morning they were seeking a third
suspect in connection with the incident.
A spokeswoman said that when the two uniformed officers arrived
''three suspects attempted to make off from the house. Attempts were
made by the officers to detain them and during the ensuing struggle one
officer was fatally wounded and the other received injuries to his
hand.''
The lengthening toll of police victims of violence has fueled a
growing clamour for officers to be routinely armed.
In June last year PC Lewis Fulton, 28, married with a seven-month-old
son, died after being stabbed when he and a colleague responded to an
emergency call in Glasgow.
Sergeant Derek Robertson, 39, was stabbed to death in February 1994
during a robbery at a sub-post office in Croydon, south London.
PC Patrick Dunne, 44, was shot dead in October 1993 when he went to
investigate gunfire at a house in Clapham, south London.
In March 1993, Sergeant Bill Forth, 34, was stabbed to death on
Tyneside after being attacked while answering a routine call to deal
with youths who had allegedly smashed a window.

Scotland Under-19 5, Romania Under-19 17
THE Scottish trailblazers in the FIRA Junior World Cup played with
pride and passion in Bucharest yesterday but, in the final analysis, it
was not enough.
In the debilitating heat of balmy Bucharest, the Scottish youngsters
led 5-0 at half-time but ran out of steam in the third quarter, when
Romania gained a measure of control which they never lost.
Hooker Chris Docherty damaged his back in the opening minute and had
to be replaced by Gary Hodgson.
Allan Bulloch made a good impression in the midfield, Graeme Beveridge
is a potential prospect at scrum half, and among the forwards Jim Kelly
has improved immeasurably. Iain Sinclair was a live-wire wing-forward
who did much good work on the deck.
Scotland's try came, once again, from Geoff Caldwell. The Ayr winger
is still raw, but has the makings of a deadly international finisher.
The Scots began soundly and for the opening 10 minutes were in the
driving seat. Romania clawed their way into the game, but Scotland took
the lead after 12 minutes through Caldwell's try.
Scott Murray drove from a Romanian turn-over, McLean spearheaded the
attack left and Iain Sinclair performed heroics to secure ruck ball
before play was switched back to the right. Caldwell sprinted all of 40
metres to touch down. Dalgleish's conversion attempt struck the
cross-bar but fell short.
For the remainder of the first period the Romanians were forced to
make telling tackles as the Scots attacked the home line.
In the second period the cumulative effect of so much rugby in such a
short space of time began to take its toll on Scottish legs. Romania
equalised after 47 minutes through Carol Ceauso as the Scots ran out of
tackles. Petre Mitu added the conversion.
The Romanians varied their lineout well and from a throw-in on the
Scottish five-metre line Florin Corodeanu increased their lead when he
strong-armed his way over.
Eleven minutes later, from a scrummage free kick, Sorin Socul barged
over for the final try.
Scotland Under-19 -- S Tomlinson (Selkirk); G Caldwell (Ayr), R
Kennedy (Stirling County), A Bulloch (Hutchesons' GS), A McLean
(Boroughmuir); G Dalgleish (Gala), G Beveridge (Peebles); G Talac
(Musselburgh), C Docherty (GHK), J Kelly (Harlequins), C Hunter
(Currie), S Murray (Edinburgh Academicals), A Cadzow

HS FP). Replacements -- G Hodgson (Newcastle Gosforth) for Docherty
(2min), E Macdonald (Edinburgh Academicals) for McNeill (54).
Referee -- D Davies (Wales).
