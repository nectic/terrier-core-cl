MARCO Pantani added a Pyrenean victory to his great Alpine triumph
four days earlier with a superb solo ride in the rain to win the
fourteenth stage of the Tour de France yesterday.
The diminutive Italian made his move 45 kilometres from the end of the
164km stage from St Orens de Gameville, near Toulouse, as the riders
were on the Port de Lers, the first of four imposing climbs.
No-one could stay with the best mountain rider in the Tour as he kept
adding to his advantage despite the poor weather conditions.
''I decided to go for a long break from well before the finish because
I'm well behind in the overall standings and I wanted to make up as much
time as possible,'' said Pantani, who won the stage by two minutes 31
seconds.
Pantani, who finished third in the Tour last year but missed out on
the stage win he so badly wanted, earned his first triumph on Wednesday
with another daring solo ride at l'Alpe d'Huez.
France's Laurent Madouas, who had chased Pantani on the Port de Lers,
just held off race leader Miguel Indurain, of Spain, to finish second.
The Spaniard was third, in the same time as Madouas and two seconds
ahead of his nearest rival overall, Swiss Alex Zuelle.
With two more days in the Pyrenees after a rest day today, Pantani
will be favoured for another stage win, particularly in the testing ride
over five big peaks to Cauterets tomorrow.

IN THIS country we have a poor sporting underclass that makes up the
vast majority of people, and they are turned away from sports grounds
owned by the rich. I think it all smells and it's causing problems.
Private schools and other bodies whose grounds are not used for many
months should let kids use their facilities in organised games to keep
their minds and bodies alive. The kids rot otherwise. Literally. They go
bad.
In South Africa, the kids that mill around the corners cause all the
trouble, and those patently with nothing to do are the black children
from poor housing who are bored beyond belief.
They have been treated like dirt for two centuries, so their
resentment is transparent. You can almost understand why they feel
negative and aggressive and a good question to ask yourself is: Would
you behave any differently in their place?
They have the weather over there, mind you. White kids go surfing,
even in mid-winter, if there is nothing else to do.
Which is why it's such a shock to come back to this grey, little place
called Scotland and see so many of our own kids just hanging around.
If it's not breaking bottles then it's smoking fags -- or worse,
causing fires, drinking, getting into fights, or being chucked off the
local private tennis courts, or football pitches, or parkland, for
trying to get a little game of something or other going.
I will never forget watching a well-structured football game between
two teams of 14-year-olds. It was class. They didn't argue with each
other. They looked like talented kids. Then they were thrown off the
private pitch they had been using and turned into monsters who spat at
and abused their ejector and then assaulted two boys they came across 50
yards from their one-time game.
It's a fright to see the state of some of these young kids, who are
under-fed, badly clothed, and have that gaunt look to them that shouts
out their poverty. We have a lot of poor people in this country. It's a
complete bloody disgrace, but it's true.
Coming back from South Africa I suddenly see that we have let a
generation of kids develop dangerously.
This Fair fortnight we will have many kids just spoiling for trouble
in and around Glasgow's leafier suburbs and its city centre. Not even
the most naive person would dare suggest it is only the poorer people
who cause trouble -- the rich young darlings of society do it just as
well. But the poorer schools have the worst facilities, with unforgiving
blaes pitches and that's about all, while the number of parks that
exhort potential Gazzas to lay down their balls is beyond a joke.
In my absolute dream land, this is what would happen during off
seasons: each sporting authority would liaise with the private
facilities or parks about the use of their pitches, or courts, or
whatever. The local kids would then be told, through their schools
before the holidays, of a detailed timetable of skills training at
specific venues, after which there would be games, for the rest of the
summer. Or for the rest of whatever holiday it happens to be.
If it was football, then the SFA would approve the course. Likewise
rugby, or tennis.
Those who can afford to pay to use these facilities usually play on
them after work. The kids need to be occupied during the day. It seems
there are ever more poor, unhealthy, unhappy kids around. It has to be
halted. A partnership between privately-owned ground and the sports
authorities could make one heck of a difference.

OBSCURE Ted Tryba won the Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic in Williamsburg,
Virgini, yesterday, but don't look for him at this week's Open
Championship.
He is not exempt to play at St Andrews, but his first US Tour victory
earns him a berth in next year's Masters at Augusta National.
Starting the day a stroke behind overnight leader Jim Carter, the
strapping 6ft 4ins Tryba shot a closing three-under-par 68 on the
Kingsmill course to triumph by one stroke over fellow American Scott
Simpson.
Looking cool, calm, and collected in the sapping humidity, Tryba
finished at 12-under 272 to collect $198,000.
Several Open entrants tuned up for St Andrews with promising
performances, including Simpson, who shot 67 to finish runner-up for the
second successive week. Last week he finished a shot behind winner Billy
Mayfair at the Western Open.
''It'll be fun. The more I played it the more I liked the golf
course,'' Simpson said of St Andrews, where he finished in the ''middle
of the pack'' at the 1990 Open.
Tryba, 28, is playing his fourth full season on the American Tour and
his previous best result was a tie for third at the 1993 Walt Disney
World Classic.
If he was feeling nervous at the prospect of breaking his duck, Tryba
had a funny way of showing it. After a bogey at the first hole, he
stormed back with birdies at the third, sixth, seventh, and eighth holes
to take the lead.
A bogey at the ninth, where he missed a short putt, temporarily halted
Tryba's run, but a birdie at the par-4 eleventh gave him a four-shot
lead with seven holes to play.
After a two-putt birdie at the par-5 fifteenth, he still had a
three-shot lead, but it wasn't over yet. He bogeyed the sixteenth after
finding a greenside bunker and when, seconds later, Simpson birdied the
seventeenth from four feet, the margin was only one stroke.
But Simpson hit a poor drive at the last and made par, leaving Tryba
needing to par the final two holes for victory, which he duly did after
finding the heart of both greeens and two-putting. Final scores
(Americans unless stated):
272 -- T Tryba 69, 67, 68, 68.
273 -- S Simpson 69, 69, 68, 67.
274 -- S Hoch 67, 69, 71, 67; L Clements 68, 69, 69, 68; J Carter 66,
69, 68, 71.
275 -- M Dawson 68, 71, 73, 63; C Strange 72, 70, 65, 68.
277 -- J Sluman 72, 69, 67, 69; D Ogrin 71, 71, 66, 69; F Funk 68, 68,
70, 71.
278 -- J Rassett 71, 70, 69, 68; G Day 70, 72, 69, 67; M McCumber 74,
68, 69, 67; M Bradley 67, 71, 71, 69; P Stewart 70, 68, 71, 69; K Gibson
71, 70, 66, 71; K Triplett 66, 71, 70, 71.
Others included: 279 -- J Gallagher 69, 65, 70, 75. 281 -- J Haas 72,
69, 69, 71. 288 -- C Van Der Velde (Netherlands) 67, 72, 77, 72.
* SWEDEN'S Annika Sorenstam reeled off three consecutive birdies and
survived a shaky finish to capture the fiftieth US Women's Open for her
first LPGA victory.
Sorenstam, capitalising on third round leader Meg Mallon's
triple-bogey debacle at the fourth hole, shot a two-under-par 68 for a
one-stroke victory on the Broadmoor Golf Club's East Course in Colorado
Springs.
Britain's Laura Davies, the US Tour's leading money-winner this year,
had a 74 to finish on 288, 10 shots behind Sorenstam.
Birdies at the ninth, tenth and eleventh put the Swede two shots in
front, a lead she extended to three, helping her overcome bogeys on the
fifteenth and sixteenth.
''I was five shots adrift starting the day,'' said Sorenstam. ''I went
out with the attitude that I had nothing to lose.''
Mallon had a chance to tie at the final hole, but missed a 20-foot
birdie putt. Her 74 gave her a 279 total. Defending champion Patty
Sheehan finished with a 69 for a 283 total. Top amateur was Sarah LeBrun
Ingram, who finished with a 74 for a 294 total.

TOM McKean and Brian Whittle, who made their major breakthrough on to
the British athletics stage at the same UK championships 10 years ago,
almost certainly reached the end of the international road together
yesterday.
The pair, great pals, were united in disappointment as they departed
from the Birmingham arena with no hope of being in the World
Championship team which will be named this morning.
They suffered dismal defeats at the KP AAA championships, but there
were significant Scottish triumphs -- titles for three women,
predictably by Yvonne Murray (1500m) and Mel Neef (400m), and one
literally out of the blue, in the javelin, for Edinburgh Woollen Mill's
Lorna Jackson.
The 21-year-old Scottish champion reached a lifetime best of 55.48
metres to confirm her arrival as one of Britain's most promising young
throwers.
Jackson suffered a nervous afternoon, launching her winning throw in
the opening round, before almost surrendering it in the last to Sharon
Gibson. Though winners of all events are guaranteed a place in the team
for Sweden, they must achieve the qualifying standard, and Jackson is
well short of the required mark of 60m.
Motherwell's Murray, the Commonwealth 10,000m champion, holds the
unique distinction among UK athletes of having achieved the qualifying
standard in three events (10,000m, 5000m, and 1500m), and there was no
great opposition to prevent her winning a sixth AAA title.
She came home comfortably clear of a modest 1500m field in 4-11.47.
She will have her last world warm-up race over 2000m at Sheffield on
Sunday. ''I owe a lot to David McLean, the Scottish Rugby Union fitness
advisor, who has helped get me back in shape,'' said Murray.
''I thought I had a hamstring injury, and was really worried, but
David has identified the problem, and fixed it.''
European Cup champion Neef successfully defended the one-lap title,
first Scots woman to do so. The City of Glasgow runner clocked 51.63,
winning by more than a second.
''I'm also due to race in Sheffield, over 400m,'' said Neef who is
likely to be offered a further race, overseas, before the worlds, with
Lindsey Macdonald's 15-year-old Scottish record of 51.16 the target. I
know that I can run inside 51 seconds.''
McKean showed a glimpse of his old self in the heats, charging out
when boxed in.
But there was no escape in the final. The Lanark and Lesmahagow runner
threatened briefly to take control after the opening 200m, but it was
Craig Winrow who snatched the initiative, and McKean disappeared
backwards.
Curtis Robb stormed clear to claim the title, but Govan-born David
Strang fought off the pursuit to give himself a chance of a place in the
Sweden squad.
As McKean hung his head in despair, the jubilant Strang, for whom the
former world indoor champion was a role model, confirmed he was ready to
take his chance of an international reprieve.
Having finished runner up to Robb in 1min 47.06secs, outside the
qualifying mark, Strang revealed that coaching director Malcolm Arnold
has offered him two chances this week of reaching the 1-46.5 time
required - a thinly disguised confirmation that Strang he will be named
today.
''I have been told I have a place in the Oslo 800m on Friday, and at
Sheffield on Sunday,'' said Strang.
McKean and Whittle both have the required standard from last year, but
that will make no impact after yesterday's performances.
McKean was left treading water, second last in 1-50.70, while Whittle,
fourth best in Europe last year, but plagued by injury this year,
dropped out of the 400m final with cramp before reaching the half
distance.
It was at the 1985 UK Championships that McKean took his first major
British 800m title, while unknown Whittle made his breakthrough with a
medal.
McKean indicated earlier if this season went badly his career would
almost certainly be over. His times have got progressively slower in
recent years, since he split with his former coach, Tom Boyle.
''No comment,'' was the reply last night from both athletes when asked
if they would retire.
Martin Bell set a Scottish record (41-16.30), taking third in the
10,000m walk, and ken Campbell lost the hurdles bronze by just one
hundredth of a second, with 13.98, his best time of the year. But
Commonwealth high jump bronze medallist Geoff Parsons failed to record a
height.
Doug Walker was tantalisingly close to the World Student qualifying
time in the 200m with 20.88, but failed to reach the final which was won
by John Regis in 20.37.

WILLIE Wood produced a vintage display at Westburn Park yesterday to
recapture the Woolwich Scottish Masters title and pocket the #3000 first
prize when he edged out Scottish international team-mate Richard Corsie
by 7-2, 4-7, 7-5.
Corsie, who lost out in the final last year to Andy Thomson, had to
settle for the runners-up spot again despite coming from behind to take
a 5-4 lead in the final set.
Wood had forged into a 4-1 lead, but Corsie produced the shot of the
match on the next end, trailing the jack away from Wood's shot bowl to
pick up a maximum 4 and move 5-4 ahead.
''I thought then that I might get my hands on this title at long last
but it wasn't to be,'' said Corsie.
''You can't take anything away from Willie -- he hit back with a
double and single and that really was the story of the match -- his
opening bowl on every end was on top of the jack and it kept me under
all sorts of pressure.''
Wood had needed just five ends to wrap up the opening set, counting on
four of them to take the set 7-2.
He then moved 3-0 ahead in the second, but Corsie hit back to take the
set 7-4 and tie the match.
That set the scene for the decider and Wood's great finish gave him
victory again.
Earlier, Wood had edged out Swansea's Stephen Rees 7-4, 4-7, 7-5 in a
25-end marathon.
Wood led throughout the opening set, but then saw Rees hit back to
take the second set with a similar 7-4 scoreline after 10 ends. Rees
then looked poised for victory when he went 5-4 ahead after six ends of
the decider, but Wood piled three bowls within inches of the jack on the
next end to wrap up the set by 7-5.
Corsie secured his final spot when he edged out former world indoor
champion John Price in the best match of the championship.
The Scot was all at sea during the opening set, losing 7-2 in just
four ends, but he then battled back to take the second 7-5 and he went
on to repeat that scoreline in the next set.
A delighted Wood said after his final win: ''I was really pleased with
my form from the opening day on Friday.
''It's the best I've played for a long time and I really enjoyed all
my matches.''
He had reached the knock-out stages as the only unbeaten player in the
field after Friday's section matches, racking up straight-set wins over
Scottish junior champion Robert Paterson, Ireland's Noel Graham, and
Price, who moved through to the knock-out stages as the runner-up in his
section.
Wood's quarter-final victim was fellow Scot Graham Robertson, whom he
beat 2-7, 7-4, 7-5, while Corsie beat world outdoor champion Tony
Allcock 7-1, 1-7, 7-5.
The Welsh duo clinched their last-four spots when Price beat Scottish
champion Colin Peacock from Marchmount, Dumfries, 0-7, 7-4, 7-5 and Rees
beat Jersey's David Le Marquand 4-7, 7-2, 7-1. Results:
Quarter-finals -- R Corsie (Scotland) beat A Allcock (England) 7-1,
1-7, 7-5; J Price (Wales) beat C Peacock (Scotland) 0-7, 7-4, 7-5; S
Rees (Wales) beat D Le Marquand (Jersey) 4-7, 7-2, 7-1; W Wood
(Scotland) beat G Robertson (Scotland) 2-7, 7-4, 7-5.
Semi-finals -- Corsie beat Price 2-7, 7-5, 7-5; Wood beat Rees 7-4,
4-7, 7-5.
Final -- Wood beat Corsie 7-2, 4-7, 7-5.

JEREMY Bates beat Andrew Foster to win the Mercury Communications
Challenge at Bristol yesterday -- then put in a plea for more British
tournaments.
The former British No.1 picked up a cheque for #5000 after his 6-7,
6-4, 6-3 two-hour victory over the 23-year-old from Stoke.
''I am convinced that, with more sponsors for tournaments here, we
would see more home players getting to the top,'' said Bates.
Foster, the British No.8, broke Bates' serve at the start of the match
and quickly made it 2-0 with a service game that contained three aces.
He fired 16 aces in all but the match began to turn when Bates broke
through in the seventh game of the second set.
And when he passed Foster to take the opening game of the final set,
then held his own service to love, Bates was well on his way to victory.
* SECOND seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov, of Russia, had to work hard to
overcome Swiss Jakob Hlasek 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the men's Swiss Open
final yesterday.
The match, which lasted just over two-and-a-half hours, was
interrupted for 88 minutes by rain, with Kafelnikov a break up, leading
5-4 and poised to take the second set. He held his service on the
resumption to clinch the set 6-4.
Hlasek finally got the break he needed in the second game of the third
set, which he won 6-3 when play was resumed again after a further
48-minute break.

discus (39.66m) while Lee McConnell recorded 1.69m for second in the
high jump and 25.44sec for third in the 200m.
Scotland finished second behind England in three of the four relay
races, with the 4 x 400 team of Kriss Stewart, Richard Singer, Richard
MacDonald, and Ahmed Al Kowarri recording 3min 22.12sec to better the
Scottish age-group record. Results:

JONATHAN Pankhurst, who last year became the first player to win both
the 18-and-Under and 16-and-Under boys' singles events in the Scottish
Junior Closed championships, rewrote the record books when he retained
both titles at Craiglockhart on Saturday.
The 15-year-old from Kingussie confirmed his class when he dropped
only one game in his 58-minute dismissal of Mark Gilmour in the 16s
final, but was made to work harder for his 18s win over Bridge of Allan
clubmate Nick Bradley.
Pankhurst led 5-1 in the first set but the 16-year-old from
Auchterarder pulled back to 5-4 and saved three set points before
surrendering his own serve in the tenth.
The Kingussie player appeared to have the match within his grasp when
he established a 5-2 lead in the second, but Bradley survived three
match points in the tenth game as he reeled off four successive games to
go 6-5 up. But Pankhurst broke back to force a tie-break, which he won
7-3.
Mhari Brown picked up a hat trick of titles when she added two singles
championships to the 14-and-Under doubles crown she won with Karen
Paterson on Friday.
The 13-year-old Kirkcaldy prospect upset top seed Claire Young 6-2,
6-3 in the 16s final before retaining the 14s crown with a 6-2, 6-0 win
over Pippa Downes. Final results:
Boys: Singles, 18-and-Under -- J Pankhurst (Kingussie) beat N Bradley
(Bridge of Allan) 6-4, 7-6. 16-and-Under -- Pankhurst beat M Gilmour

JOHN Cleland celebrated his forty-third birthday on Saturday and
yesterday he gave himself a belated present by driving his Vauxhall
Cavalier to victory in the Auto Trader RAC British Touring Car
Championship at Silverstone.
It was a fourth straight win for Cleland and extends his lead to 52
points with 10 rounds remaining.
The Scot, however, did not have things all his own way. From the off,
he duelled with New Zealand's Paul Radisich in a Ford Mondeo, with
Renault's Swiss driver, Alain Menu, in close attendance.
Cleland and Radisich swopped the lead countless times, until Cleland
made his move towards the end of the fourth lap.
With Menu, and Volvo-driving Swede Rickard Rydell, pitting for
attention to a steamed-up windscreen, Will Hoy in the second Renault
assumed third place, and he followed Cleland past Radisich to finish in
second spot.
Radisich meanwhile slipped back and into the clutches of Tim Harvey
(Volvo), James Thompson (Vauxhall), Kelvin Burt (Ford), and Julian
Bailey (Toyota), who staged a titanic duel for third place. Harvey
slithered off the track on lap 11, handing third to Thompson as Radisich
slipped down the order. Bailey took fourth place.
Victor in the Total Cup for Privateers was 1990 champion Robb Gravett,
driving a new Ford Mondeo.

GREG Rusedski yesterday completed the latest phase of his crusade to
lift British tennis back to the top by spearheading the Davis Cup team's
first whitewash win for 10 years -- and then waved goodbye to his
adopted country until November.
The Canadian-born world No.49 will be back again in four months to
underline his commitment to the British cause again by playing in the
Guardian Direct National Championships at Telford, instead of the much
more lucrative Paris Indoor Open.
Having opened the way for Britain's first Davis Cup win since 1991 by
obliterating Monaco's Christophe Boggetti on Friday, Rusedski polished
off the principality's leading player -- Sebastien Graeff -- with even
less fuss in the first of two dead rubbers.
Tim Henman, the British No.5 who has sufficient potential to join
Rusedski in the world's top 50, cemented the 5-0 success at Eastbourne
by crushing Boggetti 6-1, 6-4, following yesterday's doubles win over
the Monaco pair by Neil Broad and Mark Petchey.
Rusedski said: ''It was great to see so many young people coming to
watch the matches at Eastbourne, because that is what the game needs
most of all here in Britain.
''We need to capture the imagination of kids between about seven and
12 so that they decide to pick up a tennis racket instead of a
football.''
Rusedski's almost evangelical zeal in taking up the British flag will
certainly extend fully to the Davis Cup.
He insisted: ''Only injury can keep me out of future matches. I
believe in this team and think we have a real shot at reaching the world
group again within three years.''
To do that, Britain must win at least their next five matches, the
majority of them likely to be away on hard-court or clay surfaces,
instead of the grass which is usually such a home comfort.
Beating Monaco merely maintained the modest status of division two in
the Euro-African Zone for another year, and Rusedski and company could
be drawn against any one of 15 nations of varying quality for the next
fixture in April.

WELSHMAN Brian Huggett narrowly failed to snatch victory from Italian
Ronato Campagnoli in the International German Seniors tournament in
Idstein, Frankfurt, yesterday.
Former Ryder Cup star Huggett, winner of the Windsor Senior Masters in
April, shot a five-under-par 67 to finish two adrift of Campagnoli.
The 51-year-old from Firenze never lost the lead to pick up the
winner's cheque of #13,350. He carded a 71 for an eight-under-par
aggregate of 208 and his first overseas victory. Fellow Italian Alberto
Croce was joint second with Huggett after taking only 28 putts in his
67.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):

SCOTLAND'S young cricketers made a sensational start to the Youth
World Cup in Holland yesterday when they hammered Bermuda by 88 runs.
Dougie Lockhart's side rattled up 189 from their 50 overs, then
skittled their opponents for just 91.
Arbroath's Greig Butchart top-scored with 77, including six fours and
one six, while Neil McCallum of Watson's College chipped in with 38.
The Bermudans never looked like threatening Scotland's total after a
blistering opening spell by Steve Blackie and 16-year-old John Blain.
The Penicuik kid, who became the youngest player ever to represent
Scotland at this level, earned special praise from coach Jim Love who
said: ''John bowled with real fire and even hit one of their openers on
the shoulder in the first over. After that they lost any hunger for the
battle.
''Blain could develop into a fine cricketer. But it wasn't a one-man
effort. Everyone contributed.'' Strathmore's Steve Blackie outshone
Blain in the wicket-taking department with four scalps, and spin-twins
Ross Mitchinson and Kevin Stott had two each.
The Scots will draft in Alan Sievewright and Rahim Razak, who missed
out yesterday, for today's clash with Ireland. Scoreboard:
Scotland Under-19 189 (G Butchart 77, N McCallum 38, S Moffat 20);
Bermuda Under-19 91 (S Blackie 4-24). Scotland won by 88 runs.

ROBIN Carrick was managing partner of the Ship Bank in Glasgow from
1775 to 1821; his portrait now hangs in the Glasgow chief office of Bank
of Scotland. He was born in Houston, Renfrewshire, in 1737, and his
father, a minister, had been tutor to Andrew Buchanan of Drumpellier,
one of the founders of the Ship Bank. In 1752, at the age of 14, young
Robin was given a position as clerk at the Ship Bank at a salary of #25
a year. Six years later he became accountant and later cashier.
He became a partner in the Ship Bank around the time when the River
Clyde was dredged, enabling ships to pass up to the Broomielaw for the
first time. Although the American War of Independence had severely
damaged the tobacco trade, Glasgow's trade to the West Indies improved,
bringing cotton, rum and molasses into the city and creating a new
business area (the district now known as the Merchant City).
Robin Carrick soon moved the bank office to the corner of Glassford
Street and Argyle Street to be closer to the centre of activity.
Business was conducted methodically and slowly; any customer wanting a
bill honoured had to wait while it was taken to ''Auld Robin'' for
approval. His phrase, ''It's no convenient'', meant a rejection; he also
marked the corner of a rejected bill with his thumb-nail so that he
would know it instantly if it ever reappeared.

SCOTS felt the full weight of Spanish golf yesterday when they went
down 5-2 in the final of the European women's team championship in Milan
and 6-1 in the third/fourth place play-off in the equivalent boys' event
at Woodhall Spa.
The women, attempting to emulate the achievement of the Scottish men
who won their tournament at Royal Antwerp a fortnight ago, fell at the
last hurdle in the sweltering heat of Milan.
The match was much closer than the scoreline suggests. Two of the
games went to extra holes and both were won by Spain, who built the
foundations for their success by taking both of the foursomes, the
second at the seventh extra hole, where Scots Alison Rose and Lesley
Nicholson three-putted.
At one time in the afternoon the Scots were down in three of the five
singles, but Windyhill's Janice Moodie and Turnberry's Mhairi McKay
fought back gamely.
McKay was two down to Ana Larraneta with eight to play but won at the
seventeenth.
Moodie, two down at the midway stage, reduced the deficit at the tenth
and after a succession of halves, won the sixteenth and seventeenth to
put her nose in front. However, at the last she pushed her second shot
into trees and lost the hole to be pegged back. The match went into
extra time and Spaniard Iziar Elguezabal got a winning birdie 3.
Unknown to Moodie it was all over anyway. Sharon McMaster had lost,
and Lesley Nicholson, one up with six to play, lost two in a row and
eventually went down at the last, where she drove into trouble.
Details:
Scotland 2, Spain 5 (Scotland names first): Foursomes -- J Moodie and
M McKay lost to A Larraneta and M Pons, 2 and 1; A Rose and L Nicholson
lost to S Beautell and A Sanchez, at 25th. Singles -- Moodie lost to I
Elguezabel, at 19th; Rose beat Sanchez, 2 and 1; S McMaster lost to
Pons, 5 and 3; Nicholson lost to Beautell, 1 hole; McKay beat Larraneta,
2 and 1.
Third/fourth place play-off -- England 4[1/2], Denmark 2[1/2].
Final order of countries -- 1, Spain; 2, Scotland; 3, England; 4,
Denmark; 5, France; 6, Italy; 7, Sweden; 8, Wales; 9, Norway; 10,
Ireland; 11, Germany; 12, Holland; 13, Austria; 14, Switzerland; 15,
Belgium; 16, Finland; 17, Portugal; 18, Iceland; 19, Czech Republic.
At Woodhall Spa, following Saturday's semi-final reverse against
Sweden, the Scottish youngsters struggled to raise their game. They lost
both foursomes matches and were always facing an uphill task after that.
Chris Kelly and Graham Fox lost their 100% record but only just as
they extended Jose Lara and Rafael Vera to the second extra hole. In the
singles, only Steven Young managed a victory.
In the final, holders England beat Sweden 4-3. Details:
England 4, Sweden 3 (English names first): Foursomes -- C Duke and J
Little beat J Backstrom and C Petersson, 2 and 1; D Lucas and L Donald
beat P Davidsoon and F Lindblom, 5 and 3. Singles -- Duke lost to
Backstrom, at 19th; R Duck lost to Lindblom, 4 and 3; Lucas lost to
Petersson, 1 hole; Donald beat C Ekebergh, 3 and 2; Little beat
Davidsson, at 19th.
Spain 6, Scotland 1 (Spanish names first): Foursomes -- S Garcia and R
Quiros beat S Young and G Campbell, 4 and 3; J Lara and R Vera beat G
Fox and C Kelly, at 20th; Singles -- G Csatanio lost to Young, 2 holes;
Lara beat Kelly, 3 and 2; Garcia beat P Cunningham 4 and 3; Quiros beat
Campbell, 1 hole; Vera beat Fox, 2 holes.
5/6 place -- Italy beat France 4-3. 7/8 place -- Denmark beat Germany
4-3.
Second flight: 9/10 place -- Ireland beat Belgium 5-0. 11/12 place --
Norway bt Wales 3.5-1.5.

Scottish Open, Carnoustie.
WAYNE Riley, for winning the title, Nick Faldo and Colin Montgomerie
for making their pursuit of him interesting, and Gordon Sherry for
having the best finish ever achieved by an amateur in a European Tour
event -- all took away something from the Scottish Open at Carnoustie.
However, as always, coming events in the shape of the Open
Championship, which begins on Thursday at St Andrews, cast their shadow
over the tournament, and, as an indicator of the possible outcome this
week, the form of Faldo and Montgomerie concentrated attention even more
sharply on their prospects.
Faldo, second in his competitive re-entry after his moderate
performance in the US Open, will return to the scene of his 1990 victory
in a positive frame of mind. ''The best thing was that I played well
under pressure,'' he said. ''It's only in the heat you find out how good
your game really is.''
Bernard Gallacher, Europe's Ryder Cup captain, will have taken hope
that Faldo may yet gain one of the 10 automatic places on the team. From
twenty-fifth before the Scottish, Faldo rose to fourteenth and his
placing in the Open, next month's US PGA, and in any other counting
tournament, could yet give Gallacher greater freedom over his two
selections.
Montgomerie, although he asserted he was not achieving the results his
game deserved, still regarded his third-place finish a success. But he
took 35 putts to follow 36 in the third round and remarked: ''You can't
win putting like that. I'll have to sort it out, and putt and putt and
putt again until I get it right.''
Indeed, Montgomerie attributed his failure to win in Dubai and in the
English, Irish, and Scottish championships to his frailties on the
green. But that, of course, might simply be a reaction to the unbearable
heaviness of trying -- too hard, that is -- by a player for whom winning
is not the best thing, but the only thing.
After five holes of the final round, Faldo was eight strokes behind
Riley, but subsequently, there was no evidence of lack of give in his
game. Indeed with only two holes remaining, the margin was down to two
and the stocky, resolute Australian became safe only when he holed his
only substantial putt, from 30 feet to birdie the seventeenth.
However, the defining moment of the championship occurred at the
fourteenth. Faldo was desperately unlucky that his drive finished so
close to the edge of the left-hand bunker that he had to stand in it to
address the ball, opposite a point between knees and waist. Using his
putter, Faldo smothered the ball into beaten-down grass and the birdie
chance had gone.
With his three-stroke advantage, Riley could afford to navigate the
twisting loops of the Barry Burn prudently for par. Faldo fought
indomitably to the last shot, his bunker recovery to four feet for a
birdie proof that, although his shot execution may be fallible by his
exacting standards, his will remains strong.
A lead as substantial as the five strokes Riley took into the last
round has its own problems, not least when the playing partner has the
presence and carries the threat of a Faldo.
Riley, winless since his 1991 Australian Open victory, exulted: ''I
feel a burden has been lifted. It's been a long time in coming, but I
always said it would happen and here it is. I'm no longer that good
player who never wins a tournament.''
Handsome though his reward of #108,330 was, Riley's first victory in
Europe was what mattered to him most. On Scottish followers of the game
the irony would not be lost that this was a third victory of an
Australian, after Craig Parry and Peter O'Malley, and that in 10
championships no domestic sideboard has groaned under the trophy's
weight.
On which topic Riley may have captured the title, but Sherry -- all
6ft 8in, 18st, and size-13 shoes of him -- did likewise with the
imagination of the galleries. The Amateur Champion's 69, his third
successive score below par, for equal-fourth place -- worth #30,015 to a
professional -- was a huge achievement and, justifiably, enjoyed by the
player.
It came immediately after an exhausting week during which he had led
Scotland to victory in the European Team Championship, in which, Sherry
reflected, there was more pressure. ''If you hit bad shots in that, you
let your team-mates down; in a tournament, only yourself,'' he added.
''At the start I was knackered, but the spectators kept me going.''
Sherry's next objective is the Open's amateur medal, for which he will
renew rivalries with his American counterpart, Tiger Woods, from whom he
won a #1 bet for the lower total. ''It was my suggestion,'' Sherry
admitted. ''I'm a poor student, but come to think of it, so is he.''
Recently in the St Andrews Links Trophy, Sherry was nine under par
over the Old Course as runner-up to Graham Rankin. Today, he and the
European champion, Stephen Gallacher, will take on Sam Torrance and Carl
Mason in a practice match. The forty-something pros may have to be on
their mettle.

AXA SUNDAY LEAGUE
GRAHAM Thorpe and Darren Bicknell both scored centuries as Surrey
ended their winning drought on a day when rain dominated proceedings in
the AXA Equity &amp; Law League.
Surrey's 19-run victory over Gloucestershire at The Oval was their
first over a first class county since May.
Thorpe made 112, three short of his highest score in the 40-over
competition, and opener Bicknell 102 not out as they compiled Surrey's
highest Sunday League second wicket stand of 203.
It comfortably passed the previous mark of 187 by Alan Butcher and
Roger Knight set in 1983 and guided Surrey to 265 for two with
Gloucestershire's reply 246 for eight.
Skipper Jack Russell made an unbeaten 76 for Gloucestershire -- his
highest score of the summer -- but off-spinner Andy Smith sealed their
fate with a Sunday best three for 36.
A sixth wicket stand of 109 from Kevan James (62no) and Adrian Aymes
(41) steered Hampshire to only their second Sunday League win of the
season as they beat Durham by four wickets at Chester-le-Street.
Replying to Durham's 170 for five, Hampshire slumped to 61 for five
before left-hander James led the fightback with his unbeaten knock
securing victory on 174 for six with four balls to spare.
The weather played a major role in the other four fixtures with Essex
taking advantage to climb to second in the table.
They beat Leicestershire at Chelmsford as Nasser Hussain (58) logged
his fourth successive Sunday half-century. Chasing an Essex total of 211
for six, Leicestershire's reply was halted after 35.4 overs on 186 for
five -- gifting Essex victory on a faster scoring rate. Leicestershire,
with openers Vince Wells (42) and Nigel Briers (37) putting on 89,
needed just three more runs to have edged victory themselves.
Defending champions Warwickshire won their sixth successive Sunday
League match as their success on a faster scoring rate against Middlesex
maintained their surge up the table. The game at Edgbaston was initially
reduced to 33 overs and Middlesex had reached 100 for four in 24.3 overs
when rain forced a lengthy interruption. When play resumed, Warwickshire
were set a reduced target of 82 in 20 overs. Opener Dominic Ostler hit
an unbeaten 46 as the hosts reached their target with 3.5 overs to spare
for the loss of two wickets.
Leaders Glamorgan were denied the chance of stretching their advantage
when rain cut short a promising start to their reply after they
restricted Somerset to 196 for nine at Taunton.
Glamorgan raced to 16 without loss in three overs before heavy rain
ended the contest with each side taking two points.
The match at Derby was also cut short by rain. Derbyshire lost two
wickets to Ed Giddins while putting just a single run on the board in
their reply after Sussex posted 198 with skipper Alan Wells making 85
off 99 balls.

GOSPEL Song, a winner of two insignificant handicaps at Hamilton Park
and Thirsk, is Scotland's sole representative in the #33,000 Tennents
Scottish Class at Ayr today but would appear to have no chance against
his classier rivals.
The Group 3 race for three-year-olds and upwards, which replaced the
Scottish Derby, is the only group race held in Scotland and always
attracts quality horses from the south.
Gospel Song, trained at Duns by Tom Kemp, was fifth to Thatched at
Edinburgh two weeks ago, but if the form holds up is unlikely to figure
in the finish.
Captain Horatius, from the in-form stable of John Dunlop, was
runner-up to Laroch in a Group 2 race in Rome in May and will be
strongly fancied. He is fresh after a seven-week lay-off and, with
Willie Ryan as his partner, must be in with a good chance.
The one to beat is Baron Ferdinand, trained by Roger Charlton and
ridden by Kevin Darley, who won a listed race over today's distance at
Goodwood in May and was second to Marildo in France last month. Owned by
Lady Rothschild, he has won more than #100,000 in win and place money.
Revere, ridden by Stirling-born Richard Quinn and trained by Paul
Cole, is another worth consideration. A proven front-runner, he outpaced
Young Buster at Kempton two weeks ago.
The Irish challenger in the race, Phil the Bill, won a handicap at The
Curragh only a few days ago.

PUNCH AND Judy and the noise of the holiday crowd at Scotland's first
Sunday race meeting upset the hot favourite Batabanoo, who finished last
in the big race at Ayr, writes Tom McConnell.
The race for the Tennent Trophy, the feature event of the afternoon,
was won by Highflying, at 9-4, who led for every yard of the 15
furlongs.
Batabanoo, who won the race a year ago, trailed in more than 33
lengths behind the winner and jockey Kevin Darley was sending out
distress signals at the halfway stage.
The Stewards inquired into the disappointing performance of the
favourite and Darley told them the highly strung six-year-old had been
upset by the ''noises off'' and had sweated up in his box. The Punch and
Judy show and other attractions were introduced specially for the Sunday
crowd of almost 7500, who included about 1500 children who had been
admitted free of charge.
The Stewards accepted the jockey's explanation for the poor
performance of Batabanoo. Darley said that when the others quickened,
his horse could not go with them and ran ''flat''.
Trained by Mrs Mary Reveley and running in the familiar colours of
Peter Savill, he had won by a head last month at Carlisle and was well
fancied to win the Tennent Trophy, which was first raced for at Ayr 32
years ago.
Highflying made winning look easy. Apprentice Jason Tate took him to
the front from the stalls and never looked like being overtaken. The
winning prize money of more than #8000 took Highflying's career winnings
over #100,000. His greatest success was last year when he won the
Northumberland Plate. Trainer George Moore plans to run him again at
Ascot on Friday in the Brown Jack Stakes.
Highflying completed a 28-1 double for trainer and jockey, who had won
the preceding handicap with Flashy's Son at 8-1.
A furlong out it looked as if Al Wujid, Tom Dyer's smart sprinter,
successful at Newcastle and York recently, had it sewn up but Flashy's
Son came with a late burst of speed to catch him a few yards from the
line and win by half-a-length. Flashy's Son is not unknown to Scottish
punters, having won a five-furlong seller at Hamilton Park only nine
days ago.
He has only been out of the frame twice in 11 runs since joining the
yard from Micky Hammond.
The first race to be run on the Sabbath in Scotland went to the 4-6
favourite Code Of Law, owned by Robert Sangster and trained by Peter
Chapple-Hyam. Brett Thomson took him to the front after two furlongs and
was three-and-a-half lengths clear of Far Ahead at the post.
Detachment, 4-7 favourite and from the same stable, finished third to
Royal Mark, 7-1, in the maiden race for two-year-olds.
Freedom Flame, owned by Sheik Mohammed and reputed to be the best
two-year-old in Mark Johnston's yard, just failed by a neck. Johnston
had earlier been successful with Bailey's Sunset in the Joe Punter
selling Handicap.
* PURE Grain, third to Moonshell in the Vodafone Oaks at Epsom, took
yesterday's Kildangan Stud-sponsored Irish Oaks at The Curragh to give
Michael Stoute his tenth Irish classic success.
Never out of the first three under John Reid as Musetta and Larrocha
made the running, Pure Grain got the split between Musetta and the
French filly Valley of Gold early in the straight and was in front at
the two-furlong marker.
From that point, it was just a question of by how far Pure Grain would
win and the 9-2 chance, easy to back after an afternoon of heavy rain,
effortlessly drew clear to win by six lengths from the home-trained
filly Russian Snows, who came from off the pace to chase the winner
unavailingly over the last furlong and a half.
Valley of Gold kept on for third place, four lengths further back,
with a neck to Musetta and a short head to favourite Larrocha.
For John Reid it was a fourth Irish classic winner, and a very
comfortable win it was.

IAN Cameron's Largs-based Jeanneau One Design took a rare double on
the first leg of the Clyde Cruising Club's traditional annual Tobermory
Race.
Cameron's Looney Tunes was first to break the Ardrishaig finish line
on Saturday and first on corrected time in Class 1.
After a running start under spinnakers in a pleasant easterly breeze,
the wind -- as is customary -- dropped and flitted back and forth in
different directions to slow progress through the Kyles of Bute and past
Tighnabruaich.
The consoling feature of this Fair Saturday was that there were
glimpses of sun and the rain never quite arrrived.
With the wind shifting in direction it became a beat for Ardlamont
where the right turn for the long leg down Loch Fyne is made.
The winning strategies universally employed down the six classes was
to head for the Tarbert shore where there remained more breeze
throughout the afternoon.
Exploiting this lucrative seam of better wind Cameron soon shook off
the unwanted attention of Frank Lee's First Class Europe Mr Vain and
sailed on to an eight-minute win, taking first gun at just after four on
Saurday afternoon.
In Class 2, Neil McLure's Highpointer broke away to overhaul Billy
Russell's Heroic Dosser by more than half an hour on handicap while Ian
Abernethy's Victric, a class winner in this race last year, also
contrived a comfortable winning margin over Class 3.
Winners and losers alike will be preserving their strength for today's
second leg, from Crinan to Tobermory which starts at the ungodly hour of
4am. Results:
Class 1: 1, Looney Tunes, I Cameron 7hr 24min 36sec; 2, Jus Do It, I
Darby 7.32.43; 3, Highlander, S Chalmers 7.37.48.

VETERAN Australia winger David Campese, the world record try-scorer,
has been dropped for next Saturday's first match in the Bledisloe Cup
series against New Zealand in Auckland.
The 32-year-old's omission from the 21-man squad signals the possible
end of an international career spanning 91 Tests.
After a disappointing World Cup tournament, he failed to hold off the
challenge of Joe Roff and Damian Smith for a place in the squad.
Front-row forward Phil Kearns was named captain to replace fly-half
Michael Lynagh, who retired from Test rugby earlier this month. Forward
Troy Coker, who missed the World Cup campaign because of injury, earned
a recall.
Campese failed to impress Australia's three-man selection panel,
including national coach Bob Dwyer, with his performances during the
inter-state series.
He played in the New South Wales side which wrapped up the series 2-0
yesterday with a 30-23 win over Queensland but made several handling
errors.
He was unavailable for comment on his return to Sydney last night.
Six other World Cup squad members were also dropped as selectors
reacted to the quarter-final loss against England in South Africa.
Second-row forward Rod McCall, scrum-half Peter Slattery, centre
Daniel Herbert, full-back Matt Pini, prop Tony Daly, and flanker Ilie
Tabua missed selection.
The only newcomer is scrum-half Steve Merrick, who sealed his position
with two fine performances for New South Wales, including a try in
yesterday's match in Brisbane.
Their other tries came from winger Alistair Murdoch and full back
Matthew Burke, who also kicked three conversions and three penalties.
Centre Jason Little scored two tries for Queensland, the southern
hemisphere provincial Super 10 champions, John Eales converting both and
landing three penalties. Squad:
Scott Bowen, Matthew Burke, Troy Coker, Dan Crowley, John Eales,
Michael Foley, Tim Gavin, George Gregan, Mark Hartill, Tim Horan, Pat
Howard, Phil Kearns, captain, Jason Little, Daniel Manu, Ewen McKenzie,
Steve Merrick, Willie Ofahengaue, Joe Roff, Damian Smith, David Wilson,
Warwick Waugh.

SIMON Bray, the winner in 1992, regained his British amateur road race
title over a 115.5-mile course on North Humberside yesterday.
Cardiff-based Bray, 28, launched his winning attack with less than
half-a-mile to go. He crossed the line five seconds ahead of Devon's
1991 national junior champion Jeremy Hunt, who was taking time out from
a season racing in France in his bid to take the senior title.
Teesside's Paul Curran, former double Commonwealth Games champion and
the most experienced rider in the field, captured the bronze medal ahead
of Hertfordshire's Matthew Stephens.
A group comprising Hunt, Curran, Stephens, Hampshire's David Rand, and
South Wales rider Matthew Postle went clear of the field after 89 miles,
Bray spotting the danger and quickly bridging the gap from the next
bunch of 11 riders.
With one lap of the nine-mile circuit left, the six escapees held a
lead of just over two minutes before Postle and then Rand lost contact.
Details:
1, S Bray (Team Energy) 4-38-53; 2, J Hunt (CC Giro) at 5sec; 3, P
Curran (Optimum Performance RT) 6sec; 4, M Stephens (N Wirral Velo) same
time; 5, D Rand (CS Purbeck) 51sec; 6, M Postle (Team Energy) 1-56.

WIMBLEDON champion Steffi Graf says she is considering leaving Germany
following recent problems with the tax authorities, including a
much-publicised raid on her house.
The multi-millionaire star, whose tax affairs have been front-page
news in her homeland this week, said she believed her financial affairs
were all in order.
But, asked whether she might be leaving the country because of the
affair, the 26-year-old star told German television: ''My thoughts are
going in that direction. I would like to stay in Germany. I have been
here all my life and I have felt very happy here.
''Of course, it is not an easy subject. I am thinking about it and I
need some time to do so.''
German tax inspectors confirmed this week that they had searched the
homes of Graf and her father, Peter, in May. In her first public
reaction to the affair, Graf said she had been told that the
investigation could take between five and 10 years.
The German, whose career has been hampered by a serious back injury,
said the difficulties could hit her game.
''It could affect me (on court). It is not easy to deal with it. I
have enough problems,'' she said. ''I want to concentrate on my
tennis.''

RANGERS striker Ally McCoist looks certain to miss the club's
pre-season tour of Denmark after having been injured in the second of
their closed-door games against St Mirren at Love Street yesterday.
The 32-year-old striker, whose career has been savagely interrupted by
injuries over the past two seasons, gashed his left knee during the
game, which Rangers won 3-1.
He was taken back to Ibrox by the club doctor to have several stitches
inserted in the wound and last night his hopes of flying to Denmark on
Thursday morning seemed at an end.
Last season McCoist was injured while on the club's pre-season tour
and was flown home from Germany. Eventually, he played only four full
first-team games, appeared another five times as substitute, and scored
just a solitary goal.
His troubles with injury began back in April, 1993, when he broke a
leg playing for Scotland against Portugal in Lisbon. Since then, he has
had a series of injury worries which have limited his appearances for
the club.
However, manager Walter Smith said last night: ''This has no
connection with anything which has gone before.
''It's a straightforward cut on the knee, something which can happen
to any player in any game. It required stitches and that's enough to put
him out of the Danish tour. He would not have been able to play in any
of our three matches there.
''He is better at home, allowing the gash to heal. We will assess him
for our tournament when we return.''
The pre-season tournament at Ibrox involves Spurs, Sampdoria, and
Steaua Bucharest.
In yesterday's game, Paul Gascoigne scored again, just as he did
against Stirling Albion in the first of these private games on Friday
night. The other Rangers goals came from David Robertson and Brian Reid.
Meanwhile, Hearts manager Tommy McLean will be at his Tynecastle desk
as usual this morning, despite reports which said he had quit the job.
Tension remains between McLean and the Edinburgh club's board of
directors, who promised him cash to spend on players when he accepted
the job just over a year ago but have since failed to give him the money
he needs to strengthen his first-team squad.
Dundee United are on the trail of Aberdeen's Paul Kane, who last week
was told he had no future at Pittodrie.
The 30-year-old had talks with manager Roy Aitken about a new contract
only to be informed there was no offer on the table and that he could
leave.
Now United, desperate to add further signings to their squad before
launching their bid to return to the premier division in one season,
could make an offer of around #200,000 for Kane.
Tannadice manager Billy Kirkwood confirmed last night that he is
interested, but stressed that he had several other players in mind after
already snapping up Rangers goalkeeper Ally Maxwell and Motherwell
defender Rab Shannon.
United are still awaiting confirmation that Jerren Nixon is joining
Swiss club FC Zurich in a #250,000 deal.

WORLD champion Michael Schumacher and his closest and most bitter
rival, Damon Hill, earned official reprimands when they took one another
out of the British Grand Prix yesterday, presenting the young Scot,
David Coulthard, with the opportunity to win the first Formula 1 race of
his career. But an error -- a penalty for speeding, would you believe --
cost him highest place on the podium.
Coulthard had to settle for third place behind Johnny Herbert and Jean
Alesi, but that was no consolation at all to the 24-year-old, who could
and should have become the first Scottish driver since Jackie Stewart in
1971 to win at Silverstone.
As Herbert, regarded by many as the quickest of Britain's active
Formula 1 drivers, brought his Benetton Renault home after 61 laps to
secure his first grand-prix win in 71 attempts, Coulthard was left to
lament his second 10-second pit-lane speeding penalty this season, while
Hill and Schumacher glowered at one another in the pits.
Union jacks were fluttering, but not with the gusto which would have
been evident had Hill been able to win here for the second time in
succession.
The majority, who had come to hail Hill and bury Schumacher, not to
praise him, were caught off guard by some dramatic, not to mention
reckless, driving when the struggle for supremacy between the Englishman
and the German, who each had been in the lead, ended on lap 46.
Hill, who had made his second pit stop and knew Schumacher would have
to go in for a second time also, rather foolishly tried to pass on the
inside at Priory. Schumacher closed him off, wheels touched, and bits
flew off both cars as they slewed to a halt.
Both drivers climbed from their stricken machines about 20 yards apart
and stomped off towards the pit lane. They exchanged not a word, but
tried hard to kill with their looks, although it was too much for
Schumacher, who later accused Hill of having attempted ''a crazy
manoeuvre.''
Hill and Schumacher were later given a rap over the knuckles. The
world's top two drivers were severly reprimanded and warned about their
future conduct after the incident. The stewards said both drivers were
partially responsible for the collision -- despite the claims from the
German camp that Hill had been foolhardy. The decision was taken after
hearing both drivers and reviewing video replays. Both were told that
future actions could result in severe penalties.
McLaren's Mark Blundell and Rubens Barrichello (Jordan) also were
reprimanded for their private battle, which also ended with a collision.
However, if just about everyone among the capacity 90,000 crowd was
taken by surprise by the identity of the winner, at least two were not
at all shocked. Since the middle of last week, two little girls, Amy and
Chloe, Herbert's daughters, have been seen around the circuit wearing
T-shirts bearing the message ''Go Johnny, Go Go!''
He did, and they saw dad, now 30, rewarded after seven years' hard
labour, and for a short spell at least he is out from the long shadow
cast by his team-mate, Schumacher, and basking in the warmth of triumph.
Few deserve such days more than the soft-spoken Englishmen, and it was
a decent and fitting finale after the clamour of another grand prix.
Herbert was applauded into the interview room, a courtesy not shown to
Hill or Schumacher, but then the story of the new winner's struggle
makes him real in a world which often is out of touch with reality.
In 1988, when he was regarded as Britain's brightest young hope, he
crashed at Brands Hatch and, as a consequence of major surgery, both his
legs are an inch shorter than they were.
He fought back to health -- ''I have to thank my wife, Becky, for
helping me through all the difficult times,'' he said yesterday -- and
still believes firmly in his ability. Yesterday's success will help
others -- not least his team, who have always regarded him a distant
second to Schumacher -- to believe also.
As Herbert enjoyed his moment, Coulthard, who has suffered because of
mechanical failure in three of the season's eight races, was in
consultation with his race team complaining about the electrical failure
which denied him first prize.
''It happened after I had come in for my first stop and I knew I might
be speeding in the lane because of that failure,'' Coulthard said. ''I
thought my gearbox was going to go next and I was thinking about
stopping when Damon and Michael went off.
''Then I thought: 'This could get interesting,' and I kept going. My
team didn't tell me about my penalty until a couple of laps after it,
but I knew, because I saw it being relayed to the crowds on one of the
giant screens around the circuit.''
Nevertheless, Coulthard managed to overtake Herbert on lap 48, but was
called in three laps later to accept his 10-second punishment. ''Rules
are rules and I paid the price of breaking one,'' he said.
The penalty was yesterday's second mishap for Coulthard, who had to
hitch a lift to the track on the back of a passing motorbike after
getting stuck in a traffic jam on his way to the morning's practice
session.
The attitude of the combatants -- Coulthard commented ''While I am
disappointed, I am happy for Johnny'' -- was all so civilised and a
pleasant contrast to the bickering between Schumacher and Hill, who are
still first and second respectively in the drivers' championship.
Many suspected they would be unable to keep their animosity off the
track and on lap 46 these doubts may have become reality, although Hill
insisted: ''It was just a racing accident. I think I was justified in
the manoeuvre.''
Although the race stewards said both drivers were equally at fault,
Schumacher was adamant that Hill caused the crash. ''I understand he
(Hill) wanted to win his home grand prix, but it was crazy to try to
pass on that corner,'' he said.
''It was Damon's fault and it was stupid. I'm very surprised.''
A spokesman for the Benetton Renault team added: ''Everyone could see
Schumacher had the corner.''
Herbert said: ''I want to feel this good again, and I don't think it
will be long before this man (he pointed to Coulthard) experiences
victory also.''
With that, Herbert went off to prepare for the barbecue which
traditionally rounds off Silverstone and at which some of the more
musically-minded of the drivers stage a rock show. Hill plays guitar and
Herbert drums -- Schumacher would probably be the bouncer at the door --
but last night he was planning a song.
Go Johnny, Go Go Go? ''What else?'' he asked.

GILLIAN Lindsay, of Clydesdale, led the Scottish medal charge at the
National Rowing championships of Great Britain, being held over the
weekend at Nottingham.
Lindsay, who was selected for Britain's world-championship team last
week, celebrated with a comfortable 17-second win in the under-23 single
sculls, ahead of scullers from Worcester and Leicester in the silver and
bronze positions.
Earlier, Richard Harris and Drew Hendry, from Aberdeen, were just
pipped on the line in the coxless pairs final, having to settle for
silver position by just a few feet after a battling race that lasted the
full length of the course.
Other Scottish silver medals won yesterday went to George Heriot's
School, in the women's junior pairs, a race which had three Scottish
finalists -- George Watson's came fifth, and Nithsdale were sixth.
However, Nithsdale's junior women had a better result in the junior
coxed fours, taking silver in a blanket finish with Bedford High School.
Krystina Krassowska, of Edinburgh University, and Glasgow University's
Katherine Lee fought their way to bronze medals in their pairs final
yesterday evening to complete the Scottish medal haul, which, with
several junior successes on Saturday included, finally tallied one gold,
six silvers, and four bronzes.

IF YOU take a casual glance at some of the weekend sports headlines it
would appear that Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is in crisis.
A majority of fans who took part in a Manchester Evening News poll
want to see him leave the club whose fortunes he has revived over the
past seven seasons.
And the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association and their
spokesman, one Richard Kurt, is demanding that the gritty Taggart
lookalike from Govan should be replaced.
One can imagine Fergie shaking in his shoes as these forces mass
against him.
Apparently less than 1000 fans took part in the poll -- 480 wanted
Ferguson to resign, 418 backed him.
One Old Trafford insider suggested to me yesterday that Kurt's
association has a tiny membership. Maybe only 20 or 30 people are in
that lunatic fringe who have spent the summer months attacking the man
who has done more for the club than anyone else other than the late Sir
Matt Busby.
Certainly we all know supporters have short memories. But how short
can they be?
When United lured Ferguson south it was a club in serious decline,
having tried manager after manager in their search for their own
particular Holy Grail, the championship, which had eluded everyone since
the Busby years.
Ferguson ended that jinx. He gave United a title to celebrate. Then,
for good measure, he gave them another one.
Oh, and just to jog the memories of Mr Kurt and his followers, he also
produced two FA Cup wins, a League Cup success, and victory in the
European Cup-winners' Cup.
Last season, he guided the Old Trafford team to second place in the
Premiership and led them to another Wembley appearance in the FA Cup
final.
The fact that he finished second in each of these major tournaments
has now been tagged failure.
What arrant nonsense!
What unmitigated rot!
As for the supposed disagreements with players -- Paul Ince left
Manchester because he was offered a great deal of money to go to Inter
Milan.
My understanding is that Ferguson told him he did not have to go to
Italy, that he could stay, and the whole affair would be forgotten.
Ince, though, did go, after being wooed by Inter for months during
last season.
Mark Hughes went to Chelsea and while he was always a fans' favourite,
it was his decision to go. In any case, collecting #1.5m for a striker
who is approaching 32 years of age would seem to be sound business sense
when you have other front men at the club.
As for Andrei Kanchelskis, the Russian internationalist told me
several months ago, before Scotland played in Moscow, that he wanted to
leave Old Trafford. Since then he has repeatedly claimed he wants a
transfer.
None of these things needs necessarily to count against the manager.
Every club, at times, has player problems, especially in these days of
freedom of contract. United would not be immune from them whether Alex
Ferguson is in charge or not.
The real Old Trafford problem lies with people such as Richard Kurt
being given a platform as if they are the spokesmen for a huge
dissatisfied army of supporters. Kurt does not appear to have that kind
of constituency.
The demands for Ferguson to leave cannot even be described as a naked
display of ''fan power'' -- because only a tiny proportion of the red
army have said they want change.
The trouble today in football is that the stakes are now so high that
managers are being sacked even when they are successful.
Of the eight managers who lost in the European Champions 'Cup
preliminary round last season, six were fired -- yet months earlier
these men had lifted their countries' national titles.
Is the football world going mad?
Are the Richard Kurts of the game simply going to be allowed to air
their grievances, and to rail against managers, such as Ferguson, who
have known great success in the game?
I would hope not.
I would hope, instead, that United's board of directors will allow
their manager to manage and then sit back and wait for the inevitable
success he will bring back to Old Trafford.

''Hi, ho, de Silva's away,'' cheered a bunch of rather inebriated
Lancashire fans in the grandstand at Lord's late on Saturday evening.
For them the departure of Kent stroke-maker Aravinda de Silva meant
the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup was going back to Old Trafford and the real
celebrations could commence.
The Sri Lankan batsman collected the Gold Award for man of the match,
his magnificent 112 the highlight of a captivating day's play.
But de Silva had been the lone ranger as Kent chased Lancashire's
total of 274. And even skipper Steve Marsh conceded, after his side's
35-run defeat, that had the Test star received more support, the spoils
would have gone south, rather than north.
However, while de Silva carried the fight all the way, ultimately, it
was his early error in the field that cost his club dearly.
Facing only the fourth ball of the day from Tim Wren, England captain
Mike Atherton top-edged a pull shot down to de Silva at long leg. Kent's
hired hand made 20 yards to reach the ball, but spilled the chance.
Given that life, Atherton went on to make 93. With fellow opener Jason
Gallian -- who played despite a broken finger -- he helped to give Lancs
a rocket start, their first-wicket stand worth 80 in just under 20
overs.
It was Atherton, in tandem with John Crawley, who put the Red Rose
county firmly in command of this trophy decider.
They scored all around the ground, a mixture of orthodox and
improvised shots, and some good running between the stumps. In total,
their partnership for the second-wicket was worth 121 off just 154
balls.
At that stage, 300 looked a possibility. Atherton though, was left
with an eleventh B&amp;H half-century rather than a deserved ton, the opener
falling seven runs short of three figures, while Gallian made 83 from 89
deliveries.
Kent stuck to their task, and limited Lancs to 274 for seven off their
55 overs.
It was going to take a record-breaking overtaking manoeuvre to set
those from the White Horse county home happy, and it almost came off for
them.
Trevor Ward went for 7, David Fulton 25 -- both to Glen Chapple -- and
Neil Taylor 14 to leave Kent toiling on 81 for three, with all hopes of
victory resting on the Sri Lankan's shoulders.
It wasn't until the sixty-second over that the first maiden was
delivered in this run-infested match, Ian Austin the bowler. But the
Lancashire all-rounder was soon to suffer.
De Silva pulled Austin over deep mid-wicket into the Tavern Stand for
successive 6s, then off the bowler's next over, smacked him for two
equally venomous boundaries. Austin had suffered, but revenge would be
his.
Kent required 86 from the last 10 overs, although they had been losing
wickets, spinner Gary Yates taking three for 42, but all eyes were on de
Silva and his approaching century.
Chapple attempted to bounce the diminutive Sri Lankan, only to see the
ball vanish over deep square-leg for another 6, the man from Colombo
moving on to 98 with that hit. Next ball, de Silva brought the capacity
crowd to their feet with a classic cover drive, his century taking just
88 balls, including three 6s and ten 4s. He added another boundary to
his collection, before Austin was reintroduced to the attack with Kent
requiring 61 off seven overs. And it proved an inspired change.
Austin bowled, de Silva again lofted the ball to leg, but managed only
to find Graham Lloyd in the deep. Again the crowd rose to honour de
Silva, but it was Lancashire who were about to take the top honours.
Next ball, a slower one from Austin, Marsh caught a leading edge, and
Crawley took the catch. Having been savaged during the mid-part of his
shift, Austin still achieved returns of 11-4-36-2. And his involvement
wasn't over.
With all hope lost, Wren went for glory, hitting the winning captain
Mike Watkinson miles into the sky. Austin, at long-on, waited under it
-- for what seemed like an eternity -- but comfortably pouched the ball
to give Lancashire the trophy. Scoreboard:

THE announcement by Prime Minister John Major of a #100m academy of
sporting excellence, paid out of our weekly Lottery bets, is the latest
in a list of ploys by the establishment to gain popularity and keep
their jobs by playing the sports card.
The new Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is angling for reflected
glory by announcing an initiative on schools sport.
Even the Scottish Football Association is courting public opinion by
announcing major changes in the game at school level. Superficially, the
new approach sounds promising. The emphasis will be on skill, with
seven-a-side games, three 20-minute sessions instead of two long halves,
discussions on techniques at the intervals, no referees, kick-ins
instead of throw-ins, smaller goals, less emphasis on competition, with
no medals or trophies to play for.
The idea is to emulate the Dutch and produce scores of world-class
players. But will it? Or will it just succeed in destroying the
essential nature of the Scottish football.
For a start a whole generation of players will have to relearn the
cliches. A game of three thirds. Football is all about the seven men on
the park.
With kick-ins instead, words like ''shy'' will disappear entirely from
the soccer lexicon. If there is no referee, who will the Willie Millers
of the future have to complain to? Without a mason in black to control
the game, will the players have to learn to compromise and, heaven
forbid, play fair? Will midfield tussles be replaced with an attitude of
''After you, Claude''?
When Walter Smith holds up the blue jersey and reminds the Rangers
players of the next century what they're playing for, will they nod but
add that you have to take into consideration the point of view of the
boys in the green-and-white hoops?
With all this discussion at both half-times, will the Scottish players
become too cerebral? Will Super Ally McCoist have to be appointed a
national coach, specialising in teaching the players to be cocky and
chipper and a bit of a lad?
With an emphasis on all-round skills, will the schools FA bring in a
crack squad of English teachers and elocution specialists to eradicate
the ''I done'' and ''I went'' from the speech of the soccer stars of the
future? Will Scotsport ever be the same if they do?
And with no medals to be won, what are proud fathers to talk about in
the pub? With no silverware at stake, what is mum to put on the
mantelpiece?
With the proposed crack-down on the boys' club soccer scene, what is
to become of the legions of enthusiasts who devote their time to running
teams of under-nine schoolboys as if it were the Argentine national
squad? They will have no tiny tots to force into cold showers after a
defeat. Or weeping eight-year-old strikers doing 20 press-ups because
they failed to chase back even though the score was 25-0 in their
favour.
Just where will the team boss manque channel his psychopathic
energies?
The centres of sporting excellence may well produce more skilful
players but I fear they will lack that special Scottish dimension.
Lisbon Lion Jimmy Johnstone, for instance, learned his skills in the
hallway of his childhood home, using a stuffed sock as a ball and
jinking between rows of milk bottles.
Pat Crerand spent endless hours as a lad in the back court of his
Gorbals tenement spraying pinpoint passes to dustbins (a skill which
became uncannily appropriate when he played in the Celtic team of the
early 1960s). Eddie Gray perfected his amazing shooting power by
practising against a gable wall in Castlemilk.
Perhaps what we need for the next crop of Scottish stars is not a
system of hothouse-training under earnest professional coaches, but the
setting-up of a nationwide chain of Jinky Johnstone Lobeys, Pat Crerand
Tenement Back-Court Dustbin Target Ranges, and Eddie Gray
Top-Left-Hand-Corner Gable Walls.
* THE very nature of Paul Gascoigne's hairstyle necessitates regular
visits to the salon for attention to the roots. We are told that when
the great man turned up at a Glasgow hairdresser's last week, there were
three people already in the premises getting a Gazza. Presumably he was
able to tell his coiffeuse to give him a cut ''just like those guys''.

FALKLAND skipper Brian Watson is currently holidaying in Majorca but
he made a point of phoning home on Saturday evening for news of the
side's progress. Doubtless his sangria tasted all the fruitier when he
learned that Falkland had defeated Stenhousemuir at Scroggie Park in the
only Ryden East League match to beat the rain.
The home strategy was to put the visitors in on a damp pitch and pin
them down to a score somewhere around the 150 mark.
In the event, they conceded slightly more than that -- 177 for nine --
Alan Hamilton claiming four victims, but there was no Graeme Gardner, no
Willie Taylor, nor Terry Leahy in the Stenhousemuir attack, so the
homesters still fancied their chances.
At 25 for two, the rain came for the first time and, with several
stoppages thereafter, it looked as if the game was going the way of all
the others. But it never developed sufficiently for the umpires to
abort, and Cheany Pandya and Manoj Parmar, both with half-centuries once
again, led the troops to victory.
Meanwhile, neighbours Freuchie looked like doing them a favour at
Edinburgh Academicals, whom they dismissed for just more than three
figures. The match looked well under the Fifers' control until the
deluge put paid to any prospects of a resumption, much to Accies'
relief.
A motorway traffic jam which delayed some of the bowlers may well have
been the undoing of Grange at Corstorphine.
Johnny Everett toiled manfully, bowling 21 overs for a return of seven
for 74 as the home side accumulated 185 for five, 51 of them to Kevin
Azam.
But while tea was being taken, the heavens opened and further play was
ruled out.

SHIVNARINE Chanderpaul's century was the highlight of a one-day clash
between the West Indies and Ireland which ended in a rain-affected draw
in Dublin on Saturday.
The tourists enjoyed much the better of proceedings, declaring on 306
for four before a 70-minute rain interruption left Ireland facing an
impossible target for victory.
They were set a target of 307 in 60 minutes plus 20 overs and finished
on 187 for three as a crowd of almost 4000 went home damp but satisfied
with the memory of a run glut.
Chanderpaul, who was promoted to opener in place of Sherwin Campbell,
scored 101 off 84 balls, with seventeen 4s, before he was third out in
only the thirtieth over as the West Indies scored at six runs an over
throughout their innings.
Brian Lara made just nine before he gave a return catch to Neil Doak,
whose second wicket for Ireland will probably remain his most treasured.
Arthurton was unbeaten on 94 off 97 balls at the declaration and
shared a fourth-wicket stand of 114 with captain Richie Richardson, who
hit four 6s and two 4s in his 57.
After a long tea interval, Ottis Gibson took two wickets in his first
three overs to reduce Ireland to five for two and when captain Alan
Lewis was caught behind off Vasbert Drakes for eight, the West Indians
probably thought of going for victory.
A 50 partnership between Stephen Smyth and former Leicestershire
opener Justin Benson saw off the front-line bowlers and both teams had
agreed the draw half-an-hour before stumps were drawn with Smyth 98 not
out. Details:
West Indies 306-4 dec (S Chanderpaul 101, K L T Arthurton 94 no, R B
Richardson 57); Ireland 187-3 (S G Smyth 98no, J D R Benson 74no). Match
drawn.

IF goodwill was enough, golf's players, officials and fans would soon
have Seve Ballesteros swinging in the old cavalier style that made him
the world's favourite golfer not so long ago.
You would have been hard pushed to find a cynical voice in the bars
and tents of Carnoustie as theories and cures for the great Spaniard's
ails were offered, discarded and resurrected from the moment he
completed two of the worst rounds in his life, an 81 followed by an 80,
at Thursday lunchtime.
There were those who felt he should go home, lie in a darkened room
and think blank thoughts. Others reckoned he should not lift a golf
club, not even look at one, for six months.
Then there was the ''expert'' tuition from rather unsteady bar-room
swingers, lining themselves up in a variety of bizarre stances and
contorted grips, any one of which would have left the great man with a
hernia to go with his bad back.
However, among the madness are some sane voices, two or three with the
authority and track record that allows them to give credible opinions.
One, Bob Torrance, only watched Seve on television, but that is
sufficient for a teacher with his penetrating eye to see what might be
wrong with the current Ballesteros swing. In that category, too, is
Colin Montomerie's coach, Bob Ferguson, a Yorkshireman whose analytical
talents are greatly admired.
Perhaps surprisingly, considering they all have their own ways of
teaching, these two came up with very similar views on the Ballesteros
problems. Independently, each said Seve -- who played the Old Course
with Paul Azinger yesterday for a television programme to be shown later
this year -- is swinging too flat compared with his best days.
''It may be something to do with his bad back,'' said Ferguson, ''or
it could be that swinging flat is putting pressure on his back but, in
my opinion, that is what is different about his swing.''
He acknowledges that Seve's confidence has been severely dented and
adds: ''Personally, I would start him off on shots of 100 yards and I
would gradually try to get the swing more upright.
''It is not for me to be critical of a player like Seve, because the
game needs him badly, without any doubt. We also need him for the Ryder
Cup.
''The way he used to play was the way everybody dreamed of playing.
Wonderful to watch. He did everything correctly; he stood to the ball
correctly, gripped the club correctly. I feel he has just lost his way
somewhere along the line.
''Without having a word with him and asking him what he is trying to
do, it is difficult to be certain but, at any rate, the sooner he gets
back to form the better for everybody.''
Torrance, who echoed all of those sentiments, did offer advice to
Ballesteros earlier in the year.
''I worked with him for a little while before the Spanish Open, which
he won, but I first saw Seve when Sam pointed him out to me on the
practice range when he was just a kid. Seve has got it all and he has
been tremendous for the game.
''Looking at him, I think he is possibly swinging too flat. He seems
to be swinging round a wee bit, but then he tries to flatten it.''
Torrance, unashamedly, is a Ballesteros fan. ''He is such a
magnificent shot-maker with a wonderful short game, but that seems to be
suffering because of his other problems.''
The Largs man can recall discussions with Seve as far back as 1987
during the Ryder Cup at Muirfield Village. ''He was getting various
suggestions about what was wrong with his swing when he came up and
asked me. 'It is your take-away,' I told him, 'but that is a winter
job.' He asked David Feherty what he thought. He told him I was right.''
Torrance had a folksy analogy for the various attempts to sort out
Ballesteros' problems. ''If you remember, Willie Henderson had a bunion
which hurt his toe. If they had cut off his toe he wouldn't have played
as well. It is easier to get a bigger shoe.''
The solution, therefore, to Seve's woes may be much simpler than all
the amateur golf doctors imagine. Whatever it is, the sooner he gets
back to his game, the better for golf.
The man who looks after the new stars of the Scottish amateur game,
Gordon Sherry and Stephen Gallacher, used the same basis for the work
with them as he did with Ballesteros.
''The player has to agree with what you are doing. With Seve, I
explained what I felt we should do to help his swing. If he agreed we go
ahead, if not we don't. That is the only way it can work.''
Bob insists that the best years for Seve are still in front of him.
''Every great player has to accept that the best days are over. Palmer,
Hogan, Nicklaus, they all had to face up to it, but Seve is nowhere near
that stage yet.''
The biggest names among his peers are also concerned about
Ballesteros' slump. ''He is obviously hurting and you feel for the
guy,'' said Nick Faldo. ''He is working very hard and it is even more
frustrating when you are getting nothing out of it.''

WHAT burning ambitions there may have been at the weekend among clubs
to peg back leaders Clydesdale were quickly extinguished, rain being the
only winner on Saturday.
Just one match survived the elements, Cambusdoon seeing a full day's
play, but a draw at the end of the Ayr-Ferguslie game.
Iain Kennedy gave a captain's lead for Ferguslie, an example partly
followed by brother Stuart. Kennedy Sr made 82 and Kennedy Jr 33 as the
Paisley side clocked up 178 for eight.
Ayr were up with the clock as they chased, but Gary McLaughlan took
three quick wickets, and Stuart Kennedy weighed in with four for 53 to
leave Ayr eight down at the close, with pro Adrian Holdstock unbeaten on
70.
Uddingston had reached 113 for four against Clydesdale, George Reifer
looking good for his 46 not out, before the rain set in, while in
another corner of Lanarkshire, Drumpellier were 77 for three against
Kilmarnock before the same clouds knocked that match.
No play was possible at Whitehaugh or at Shawholm. All of which, has
only strengthened Clydesdale's chances of a first DM Hall Western Union
title in 15 years.

WILLIAM Funnell earned due reward for his consistency by winning the
final event of Hickstead's Royal International Horse Show last night.
The 29-year-old, one of Britain's contenders for a European
Championship place in September, took the West Sands Holidays Classic on
Comex after some near misses in the four-day meeting.
Funnell picked up a third place for the third time earlier in the
afternoon with Impressionist, on which he also had an opening-day second
place.
He also came third in Saturday's Men's Classic and the King George V
Gold Cup won by Ireland's Robert Splaine, on Heather Blaze.
Surrey-born Funnell earned the #3000 first prize with the only clear
round in a five-horse jump-off.
Funnell was third in the Speed Grand Prix earlier in the afternoon,
won by Geoff Glazzard, with Hello Feliz. Results:
The Speed Grand Prix: 1, Hello Feliz (G Glazzard, GB) 78.15sec; 2,
Vantage (G Luckett, GB) 78.40; 3, Impressionist (W Funnell, GB) 78.6.

MENTION the name Salmond anywhere in Scotland and the well-publicised
face of Scottish National Party leader Alex immediately comes to mind.
Unless, of course, the subject happens to be cricket. Arbroath
County's version is George, who has been in sparkling form so far this
season, as his unbeaten 116 proved in the Caley 80/- Counties League
victory over West Lothian at Lochlands on Saturday.
It was a result that propelled Arbroath to second-top of the table,
only one- half of a per cent behind Strathmore. Salmond's contribution
in his county's total of 176 for eight almost speaks for itself. The shy
25-year-old has been with Arbroath since he was 10, but George would
rather give credit for this season's success to others -- particularly
younger brother, John, and Kevin Ritchie, the team's opening batsmen.
''John and Kevin have been fantastic this year. Very rarely have I had
to come in at No.3 with less than 30 or 40 runs on the board. It takes
the pressure right off.''
Unfortunately for the Salmonds on Saturday, John was out in the first
over, but George more than made up for it as Arbroath chased West
Lothian's total of 172 for three.
And speaking of pressure, how's this for a week's cricketing work.
After Saturday, club skipper Salmond was due to turn out yesterday for
the Arbroath Seconds against Meigle, before preparing for the Triple
Crown internationals against England, Ireland, and Wales on Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday in Belfast. Then it's back on Saturday morning, and
straight into action in the home match against Ayrshire. That's six
games in eight days.
Salmond, however, still found time to describe the West Lothian club's
50 over declaration on Saturday -- they could have taken another four --
as ''very sporting, indeed.'' He added: ''They told us they were here to
win, and wanted the extra four overs themselves to try to bowl us out.
With eight wickets down, they almost did it, too.''
West Lothian can take consolation from the fact that Willie Donald
with 64, David Fleming (47), and Sanjay Patel (34), are still in
excellent form with the bat.
With a lunchtime thunderstorm wiping out Aberdeen's match against
Stirling County at Williamfield, Strathmore were able to take over at
the top thanks to a 117-run victory over Clackmannan County at Lochside
Park.
Mark Mudie hit a splendid 72, backed up by Nigel Hazel's 42 and Kevin
Thomson's unbeaten 37 as Strathie powered to 241 for six. But despite
Alastair MacEwen's 35 and Steve Johnstone's 32, the Wee County were all
out for 124.
It's the bowling figures, however, which make strange reading.
Clackmannan pro Malcom Howell decided to bowl right through, and was
hammered for 106 runs in 25 overs, taking four wickets. Strathie's Steve
Aktinson, on the other hand, managed seven for 20.
The storm clouds gathered a bit earlier down at Prestwick, and
off-loaded round about midday. Ayrshire's match against Forfarshire did
manage a late start although, by the evening, the home side must have
wished it had not taken place, as the visitors travelled north with a
38-run win in the bag.
John Philips made 71 of Forfar's total of 158 for nine with, Javid
Ashraf taking four for 41, and David Harper three for 65. But Ayrshire's
batsmen stuttered, Paul Coffey making 34 and Harper 30 as Gordon Walker
weighed in with three for 44 to help bowl the home side out for 120.
There was not a lot of fun in what ended up as an abandoned game at
the North Inch when Perthshire played Fifeshire. Despite the rain
causing a couple of interruptions, Perthshire managed 196 for seven.
In went Fifeshire, and after 18 overs they were reasonably placed at
58 for two until Ashok slipped going for a run. The umpire then decided
the pitch was too wet and slippery. End of game.

FROM the earliest days the Bank of Scotland has recognised its staff
as an invaluable asset. Today the bank encourages all staff, as part of
their career development, to equip themselves with the best
qualifications available, particularly membership of the Chartered
Institute of Bankers in Scotland -- a qualification with university
degree status.
Last year, Bank of Scotland staff won the prizes awarded to top
students in all subject categories, while more than half of the 250-plus
students who graduated MCIBS were from the bank.
This impressive achievement is, in part, due to the bank's commitment
to fulfilling a responsibility that attracts and retains quality staff.
Some 30% of its employees and 86% of managerial staff now hold
recognised qualifications which include accountancy, law and surveying.
Some 25 years ago, high turnover of young staff was a major concern
for the bank. Potential recruits thought of banking as dull and
old-fashioned, not surprisingly perhaps, since employees had to ask
permission before getting married and apprentices had to fill coal
buckets, polish brass and replace the blotting paper! Today, however,
the bank is a dynamic environment which provides a wealth of
opportunities and a secure framework in which staff can develop their
careers.
Investment in training has never been higher. More than 30,000 places
have been provided on training courses over the past three years by the
bank's training and staff development department. One particular focus
has been the development of interpersonal skills, very necessary in
today's ''selling'' environment.
As a result, the Bank of Scotland branch network received a
prestigious award under the Investors in People programme for providing
a framework to ensure staff training effectively meets business needs.
Bank of Scotland is also unique among commercial High Street banks in
having a ''no redundancy'' policy for staff.
A major factor in staff motivation is the personal involvement in the
bank's performance. Staff are invited to participate in profit sharing
and share option schemes. Today, around 72% of staff (including
part-time employees) have a stake in approximately 4% of the ordinary
stock of the bank. This acts as a valuable incentive, ensuring staff
play their part in the continuing financial success of the Bank of
Scotland Group.

IN THE Caledonian Scottish Counties Cup semi-final, several
outstanding performances ensured West Lothian enjoyed an easy victory
over Stirling County at Boghall. Batting first, West Lothian took a
decisive grip on the game thanks to the third wicket partnership of
William Donald and Sanjay Patel that put on 108. Patel was eventually
caught on 43, with Donald staying on to secure the innings, eventually
falling for 77 as the West Lothian innings finished on 200 for seven.
Stirling County's top order was promptly bowled out for just 10 runs
with Paul Cross and Graham Welsh taking two wickets apiece. Ian Bevan
cleaned up the middle and tail orders by taking four wickets in three
overs for no runs.
West Lothian will meet Strathmore County at Lochside Park in two weeks
time after the Strathmore side won a closer match against Forfarshire in
the other semi-final. The Angus men were first into bat. However, no-one
was able to put together a substantial innings and this fact was
compounded when Strathmore's Andy Monteith took three middle order
wickets in just four overs leaving Forfarshire on 162 for eight.
Strathmore had a shaky start and were at one stage 65 for four but the
fifth wicket partnership of Colin McQueen and Kevin Thomas put on 60,
helping them to victory. McQueen stayed in for the remainder of the
innings to hit the winning run with 10 balls to spare.

CURTIS Strange will this week return to St Andrews, where he holds the
course record.
That will end a three-year absence from the Open because Strange, 40,
has not played in the championship since he missed the cut at Muirfield
in 1992.
The most prominent of a handful of American players who have often
skipped the Open in the past decade, Strange has had a change of heart.
''I'm exempt. I need to go,'' said Strange. ''It's a major
championship. I'm going to go the next four or five years.''
Strange, a double US Open champion, denied his new-found attraction to
the Open had anything to do with the deal he has signed to commentate
for the ABC network.
''It sounds like a package deal, but it's really not,'' he said. ''I
was going to go anyway and ABC said 'since you're going, can we talk'.
''I'm going to play golf and when I finish I'll do a little
commentary. I'm not going to do TV and play a little golf on the side.
That's what I want to get straight.''
Strange's decision to play this year's Open no doubt was made easier
by the venue. His course record 62, set at the 1987 Dunhill Cup, still
stands.
He also won all five of his matches for the United States in last
year's Dunhill Cup.

A four-page special Herald advertisement feature commemorates the
tercentenary of the Bank of Scotland and examines how the bank has
developed its services to meet with the demands of today.
FOUNDED by an Act of the Scottish Parliament passed on July 17, 1695,
Bank of Scotland's initial nominal capital was set at 1.2 million Scots
pounds (#100,000 Sterling). Its proprietors (as the shareholders were
called) were granted limited liability and any foreigner who took a
holding worth 1000 Scots pounds (#83.33 Sterling) could claim Scottish
nationality -- a provision which remained in force until 1920!
In the words of Sir Bruce Pattullo, the present and 21st governor,
Bank of Scotland's history is a ''remarkable story of tenacity and of
lessons learned the hard way...''
The bank's early days were precarious, threatened by competitors, an
agricultural slump, and even by a great fire which destroyed its
premises in 1700. The Jacobite uprising of 1715 was a major interruption
to what was becoming a prosperous business. When Bonnie Prince Charlie's
army occupied the city of Edinburgh on September 16, 1745, the bank
closed for eight weeks, moving all its cash, ledgers and books in three
iron chests into the Government-held Edinburgh Castle for safekeeping.
From 1775 to 1805 Bank of Scotland had extensive control over the
banking system in Scotland. This stemmed from Henry Dundas, a director
of the bank from 1768 and later governor. He was appointed Lord Advocate
in 1778 and all Scottish parliamentary business passed through his
hands.
Dundas acquired a majority of Royal Bank shares in a complicated
series of transactions. The two banks co-operated on a greater scale
than before: senior officials met regularly; banknotes and information
were exchanged. The message to London was that the Government party in
Scotland was supported by the most sophisticated and stable banking
system in Europe and there was no place for the Bank of England.
The bank's influence was increased by the spread of branches and
agencies throughout Scotland: Dumfries, Kelso, Kilmarnock, Ayr and
Inverness. This network brought new problems such as frequent robberies:
a loaded pistol became a normal part of a bank clerk's equipment.
This banking system provided underlying stability and also capital for
industrial and agricultural development, achieved against the background
of the American War of Independence and the French Wars of the 1790s.
Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank co-operated in the role of a
quasi-reserve bank for Scotland.
While peace in 1815 meant retrenchment for many of the bank's
iron-founding and textile customers, its farming constituency suffered
even more. The agricultural boom of the Napoleonic Wars was over; prices
of oats, barley and wheat fell steadily. From 1813 to 1820 the bank's
net income from its branches, mostly in rural areas, declined from
#61,363 to a mere #859.
By 1825-6, however, Bank of Scotland had begun to expand once more,
opening branches at Fort William, Leith, Stonehaven and Falkirk, and
lending to new industries.
In 1853 Bank of Scotland took its first steps towards ''new
technology'' with an electric telegraph connection of head office in
Edinburgh to the London agent; London Stock Exchange prices became
instantly available.
By 1860 Bank of Scotland had 43 branches; the head office on
Edinburgh's Mound was extended between 1864 and 1870, and a new Glasgow
chief office was built at St Vincent Place from 1865-69 at a cost of
#48,654. Bank of Scotland opened its first London office in 1865.
Scottish banking faced a serious challenge to its expansion plans in
1875 when London bankers, concerned about strong Scottish competition,
tried to persuade the Government to remove existing Scottish banks from
England. As a result Scottish banks gave an undertaking that they would
not open new branches in England; in return, English banks would not
open in Scotland. This understanding stood for a century.
The rapid spread of branches into new middle-class suburbs and country
towns, 123 by 1895, meant that most were taking in deposits almost twice
as great as the sums of money lent. Finding profitable opportunities for
lending was a constant difficulty in the late nineteenth century. Bank
of Scotland began to look towards supporting new industrial
technologies, such as aluminium smelting, optical instrument making and
motor manufacture in Scotland.
Union in 1907 with the Inverness-based Caledonian Bank gave Bank of
Scotland an abiding interest in whisky and distilleries, particularly on
Speyside, and farming, fishing and supporting industries.
The bank's success in the period before the First World War was
bolstered by its foreign investments and Government securities. The
situation changed dramatically during the war when these had to be sold
off at low prices and replaced with Government stock which depreciated.
Although women first appeared on the bank's staff during 1916, the
bank was reluctant to employ them: by Armistice Day there were only 39
female employees out of a staff total of 804.
The Bank of Scotland (1920) Act extended its powers so that it could
for the first time open branches in other countries. The same year the
Married Women's Property (Scotland) Act gave married women the right to
have bank accounts, independent of their husbands, paving the way for a
major expansion of the bank's customer base.
For most of the 1920s, heavy industry was in the doldrums; Bank of
Scotland pushed instead to attract savings by expanding its branch
network, from 179 in 1920 to 240 in 1930 and 266 in 1939, many based in
the new residential suburbs of Scotland's major cities.
By spring 1939, the general managers of the eight Scottish banks had
finalised their war plans, including carrying account balances in
duplicate, air raid precautions and fire drills. It was agreed for the
duration of the war that no new branches would be opened, branches would
lend cash to each other and all banks would reissue each other's notes.
Between 1948 and 1951 the bank made a major strategic error in
continuing to purchase Government securities (gilts) on the assumption
that they would retain their value. In 1951 a collapse in the gilts
market eliminated the bank's inner reserves and therefore limited its
ability to expand.
Recovery from the low point of 1951 took until the mid-sixties. During
that period, the Union Bank of Scotland's dowry of shipbuilding and
steelmaking customers dominated Bank of Scotland's lending book. The
bank's first computer was installed in 1959 and a programme of branch
modernisation began. Middle-aged clerks and tellers were gradually
replaced by younger men and women. Female employment began to be taken
seriously.
In 1968, for the first time, the bank brought in a design consultant
to review its corporate image, standardise stationery and lettering and
develop a logo. Staff assessment and training were also given priority.
The 1970s were dominated by the discovery in 1969 of oil in the North
Sea. Bank of Scotland moved quickly to develop oil expertise, joining
the first consortium to develop the Forties Oil Field. It concentrated
on development of oil and gas reservoirs, rather than exploration.
Developments since then have come thick and fast . . . autotellers,
self-service banking, a computerised branch-located information system
for customers, HOBS, TAPS, support for the electronics industry,
creation of a management board which has become the ''engine of
progress''.
Banking is a cyclical business; Bank of Scotland's story reflects the
ups-and-downs of Scottish social and economic history. Moreover, the
story is also inextricably interwoven, as in the tapestry produced by
Edinburgh's Dovecote Studios to commemorate the bank's tercentenary,
with the country's weft and warp.

IF goodwill was enough, golf's players, officials and fans would soon
have Seve Ballesteros swinging in the old cavalier style that made him
the world's favourite golfer not so long ago.
You would have been hard pushed to find a cynical voice in the bars
and tents of Carnoustie as theories and cures for the great Spaniard's
ails were offered, discarded and resurrected from the moment he
completed two of the worst rounds in his life, an 81 followed by an 80,
at Thursday lunchtime.
There were those who felt he should go home, lie in a darkened room
and think blank thoughts. Others reckoned he should not lift a golf
club, not even look at one, for six months.
Then there was the ''expert'' tuition from rather unsteady bar-room
swingers, lining themselves up in a variety of bizarre stances and
contorted grips, any one of which would have left the great man with a
hernia to go with his bad back.
However, among the madness are some sane voices, two or three with the
authority and track record that allows them to give credible opinions.
One, Bob Torrance, only watched Seve on television, but that is
sufficient for a teacher with his penetrating eye to see what might be
wrong with the current Ballesteros swing. In that category, too, is
Colin Montomerie's coach, Bob Ferguson, a Yorkshireman whose analytical
talents are greatly admired.
Perhaps surprisingly, considering they all have their own ways of
teaching, these two came up with very similar views on the Ballesteros
problems. Independently, each said Seve -- who played the Old Course
with Paul Azinger yesterday for a television programme to be shown later
this year -- is swinging too flat compared with his best days.
''It may be something to do with his bad back,'' said Ferguson, ''or
it could be that swinging flat is putting pressure on his back but, in
my opinion, that is what is different about his swing.''
He acknowledges that Seve's confidence has been severely dented and
adds: ''Personally, I would start him off on shots of 100 yards and I
would gradually try to get the swing more upright.
''It is not for me to be critical of a player like Seve, because the
game needs him badly, without any doubt. We also need him for the Ryder
Cup.
''The way he used to play was the way everybody dreamed of playing.
Wonderful to watch. He did everything correctly; he stood to the ball
correctly, gripped the club correctly. I feel he has just lost his way
somewhere along the line.
''Without having a word with him and asking him what he is trying to
do, it is difficult to be certain but, at any rate, the sooner he gets
back to form the better for everybody.''
Torrance, who echoed all of those sentiments, did offer advice to
Ballesteros earlier in the year.
''I worked with him for a little while before the Spanish Open, which
he won, but I first saw Seve when Sam pointed him out to me on the
practice range when he was just a kid. Seve has got it all and he has
been tremendous for the game.
''Looking at him, I think he is possibly swinging too flat. He seems
to be swinging round a wee bit, but then he tries to flatten it.''
Torrance, unashamedly, is a Ballesteros fan. ''He is such a
magnificent shot-maker with a wonderful short game, but that seems to be
suffering because of his other problems.''
The Largs man can recall discussions with Seve as far back as 1987
during the Ryder Cup at Muirfield Village. ''He was getting various
suggestions about what was wrong with his swing when he came up and
asked me. 'It is your take-away,' I told him, 'but that is a winter
job.' He asked David Feherty what he thought. He told him I was right.''
Torrance had a folksy analogy for the various attempts to sort out
Ballesteros' problems. ''If you remember, Willie Henderson had a bunion
which hurt his toe. If they had cut off his toe he wouldn't have played
as well. It is easier to get a bigger shoe.''
The solution, therefore, to Seve's woes may be much simpler than all
the amateur golf doctors imagine. Whatever it is, the sooner he gets
back to his game, the better for golf.
The man who looks after the new stars of the Scottish amateur game,
Gordon Sherry and Stephen Gallacher, used the same basis for the work
with them as he did with Ballesteros.
''The player has to agree with what you are doing. With Seve, I
explained what I felt we should do to help his swing. If he agreed we go
ahead, if not we don't. That is the only way it can work.''
Bob insists that the best years for Seve are still in front of him.
''Every great player has to accept that the best days are over. Palmer,
Hogan, Nicklaus, they all had to face up to it, but Seve is nowhere near
that stage yet.''
The biggest names among his peers are also concerned about
Ballesteros' slump. ''He is obviously hurting and you feel for the
guy,'' said Nick Faldo. ''He is working very hard and it is even more
frustrating when you are getting nothing out of it.''

All over the world
people like
Sunday. Except
here. The major
day for sport
everywhere else
is the major day
for kill-joys in
Scotland. The
Presbyterians
don't worship
God: they worship
Sunday.
JOCKEY Scroon is a bastard. Well, so says Damon Runyon. He could have
said the same about Keiron Fallon, whose horse, Ramborette, cost me my
entire fee for today's piece. The horses were all lovely spirited
things, like ballerinas. Margot Fonteyn in lace. Except Ramborette. It
was practically El Fideldo with a drink in it.
When I get the chance, I am going to eat Ramborette, out of badness,
in a mushroom sauce. It cost me over a hundred spondulicks, not counting
the 40 I won in the first race (most of which I won on an each-way on
Top Skipper, which came in third). I might eat the horse but I am going
to enjoy eviscerating jockey Fallon even more.
This is not entirely true, and in fact there is not a note of veracity
in the above account, for I had a smashing day out at the Ayr races on
Sunday, even if I did lose a bob or two.
The Ayr Races on Sunday? Well it was Ayr and it was racing and it was
Sunday. Now there's a thing. Because this was the first ever Sunday upon
which horseracing has been permitted in Scotland. Recent changes, and
long overdue changes at that, in the law have meant that Sunday can
permit a lot of things to happen, quite against the spirit of releegious
demands.
Elsewhere in Europe, Sunday is a joyous day; one to be enjoyed and
savoured and for families and friends.
A wee drink, a splendid luncheon, footy and boules, wee lassies in
nice dresses, and wee boys trying to kill each other in so-called games.
All over the world people like Sunday. Except here. The major day for
sport everywhere else is the major day for kill-joys in Scotland. The
Presbyterians don't worship God: they worship Sunday. Yesterday in
Scotland there was a race meeting on a Sunday.
England has had four so far this year. Scotland's first day was
yesterday, a rather sultry day indeed but dry, and the horrified
Presbyterians might just want to note that it was a very successful day
indeed, except for punters like myself who vote for horses which seem
somehow more philosophical than practical. I always back dreadfully
philosophical horses. In fact, the horses I back are so extremely
existential that they deserve getting boiled down to their hooves
anyway, and maybe their hooves as well.
But let us go back to the Sunday Meet. There were six races and all of
the Elcho Bar punters were looking forward to every one. The minibus
left from there of yestreen morning. If you count McLean as a possibly
Irish title, there was only one name in the list of the retinue which
left that wee South-Side pub which wasn't well, Irish. That was
Hutchison. As it turned out, he was the only one who was Irish, a fact
amply proved when the discovery was made that his rather expensive
casual shirt was inside out. How he buttoned it up inside out is beyond
anybody, though Mick Doherty was heard to suggest that Stevie Wonder had
dressed him first thing in the morning.
It was that kind of bus and that kind of day. Raucous, a bit boozy,
and definitely losing.
At the racecourse, I wandered about with Biff Connor and off to meet
an old chum of mine, the father of Biff and writer for Angus MacPhail
the bookie, Jackie Connor, a legendary character who cycles a squillion
miles a day and is a well-known vet of the bike circuit. Jackie was as
ever debonair and stunningly dapper in his light-blue suit and smart
shirt and tie. I asked him for a tip or two. In a wee casual aside he
gave me one. ''Don't bet, son,'' he said in a whisper. Did I listen? As
it happens, I won, but not for long.
The troops from the Elcho have long dispersed to the bar. The only
lassie, Wilma, was betting enough for the entire cast of Guys and Dolls.
One of the Dohertys wanted to ''see the watter.''
Tojo and the Goose were chatting away to Jim Baxter and his lady
friend. Slim Jim was looking great but ruefully confessing that he
wasn't winning, either. Jim gave me a tip for the next race, though. I
hope he didn't bet on his tip all the same: I lost 20 quid.
What you have to understand about race meetings is that the money
doesn't, or shouldn't, count. People go to the races for fun. Heavens,
there was John Banks, the boy from Anderston and wan o' oor ain, the
millionaire bookie who sold out years back to the City Tote.
John is there for the very first Sunday, him up from Windsor, where he
now stays, just for the crack. An affable fellow in a blazer and Panama
hat, just like masel', he tells me what has stopped Sunday betting all
these years.
''The betting shops,'' he told me arcanely. He explained. The bookies
don't want the betting shops, the middle-class residents don't want the
betting shops. Even the workers in betting shops don't want the betting
shops; not on a Sunday. But the punters want the betting shops. And
indeed they do. Oh, the punters want Sunday racing very much indeedy.
There is Norman, a brickie from Sanquhar, and his wife Elizabeth. He
has three of his weans with him. One is called Kim, one is Shelley, and
the wee-est is Leigh. The wee boy is at home. All the wee lassies are
dressed gorgeously in red-and-white striped dresses. They are all under
five years of age. They are having the time of it and loving every
minute.
Danielle Warner is here, dressed to the nines, from Newton Mearns.
Robin McLean, a primary teacher from the local area and part owner of a
horse which runs today -- Mister Westsound -- is here with his pals,
Peter and Heather.
The famous Linda Perratt, the trainer, is in charge of his horse. Says
Robin about his horse when I ask if it has ever won: ''Dinnae blame the
horse -- it's me that's the idjit.'' Och, put a pound or two on the
beast today.
Then there is Alastair Fulton, constable. There are four polis today
at the course. Alastair has been 15 years on the force, though he is now
getting on for damn-near my age. Great day out for him, too. Officially
he can't put on a bet. I say nothing about unofficially. He is grinning
from ear to ear and chatting away to pals and their wives and weans.
Let me tell you something about the wives and weans. The children have
got plenty of things to do in this gypsy encampment and they are eating
enough from the efficient and decent snack vans which are everywhere to
feed the bairns for days. Don't forget, of course, that these people are
not poor. They might be largely working-class, but they are not poor.
The children are happy and well-dressed, even elaborately so. And they
are very well-behaved indeed.
The ladies are happy, well dressed, and very well-behaved as well, but
they are especially well-dressed, which is probably why they are both
happy and well-behaved. To one used to women-journalists, this comes as
a surprise that such a circumstance should come about among the
weemenfolk. In the smart bars where me and Biff Connor moved, the women
wore sporting clothes which would have made Sophia Loren greet.
Downstairs the men were cheering each other up with a libation and a
greeting or two.
We got a photie of wee seven-year-old Ryan Trodden, standing beside
the stookie of Red Rum.
It was great. I should have bet on Red Rum. Yeterday my horses were
still-er stookies than stookies.

WHAT does the 300th birthday of Scotland's first bank mean for the
many customers whose local branch is their first point of contact with
Bank of Scotland?
When the bank opened its first branches in the 1700s, it was way ahead
of its time; a hundred years later, there were 27 in all. Not until the
mid- nineteenth century did the English banks follow suit and introduce
their own branch networks. Branch banking was a uniquely Scottish way of
delivering a service which was to influence the setting up of similar
systems in countries around the world.
Today, there are more than 300 Bank of Scotland branches, described as
Gavin Masterton, general manager and deputy treasurer, as the ''heart
and lungs'' of the bank. They remain one of Bank of Scotland's greatest
strengths and enable it to establish long-standing relationships with
its customers. However, while Bank of Scotland has always been a
community bank, for personal and business customers, it is also a major
player in the financial services industry and this is an influential
factor in the way the branches of the future will develop.
Today, the bank's branches range from mobile units which service the
remoter corners of Scotland as well as the many highland games and
agricultural shows, to the most technologically advanced designs, such
as Queen Street, Glasgow which opens today. This flagship branch
represents a radical change in terms of traditional branch design,
contrasting strongly with the more basic work environment which
prevailed before. This new concept will be rolled out to a further 50
branches throughout the country over the next six months.
In all of these branches, the new design features an informal layout
that has already been widely welcomed by both personal and business
customers. Rows of tellers and the psychological barriers created by the
old banking counters and screens are in the past; instead everyone is
''on stage'' -- there is nothing behind the scenes.
Customers walk into a welcoming open-plan layout where they are
invited to sit down and discuss their requirements, whether they wish to
arrange a mortgage or deposit cash. This new branch concept has been
developed from a customer's perspective and designed with their needs in
mind.
Commenting on the future of the bank, Gavin Masterton said: ''This is
a change in focus and service and takes the branch into the 21st
century. We are now in the business of selling products and services and
building relationships. For this reason every member of staff in our new
Queen Street branch can be seen by the customer and has received
additional training in customer services. The focus of the branch is on
service, service, service.''

THE withdrawal from the Open Championship of former Masters winner
Fred Couples released another precious place for the 480 players who
yesterday completed the first of two rounds in the final qualifying
competitions. Couples has been suffering from a nagging back injury and
was advised not to travel.
Couples, quoted at favourable odds of 25-1, would in good health
surely have attracted money at that price. In January, he won the first
two European events, in Dubai and Manila, and so far as experience of
the Old Course is concerned Couples finished fourth in the 1984
championship and was a member of the respective winning and losing
United States teams in the last two finals of the Dunhill Cup.
The most immediate fringe benefit of Wayne Riley's success in the
Scottish Open Championship was that as one of the first five, not
otherwise exempt, to finish among the leading 20 places he was able to
avoid the increasingly precarious task of surviving the 36-hole test for
the remaining places.
Riley was joined in the escape tunnel by Martin Gates, whose two
eagles and one birdie at Carnoustie's three long holes, contributed to
the final round's low score of 67, Katsuyoshi Tomori and Olle Karlsson
and Mark Davis, who in a play-off made a stretcher case of Domingo
Hospital.
Thus yesterday, the players competing at Leven Links, Ladybank, Lundin
Links and Scotscraig were left to battle for a minimum of 48 places -- a
one in 10 chance for 12 players from each of the four fields of 120, a
task as daunting as, say, surviving the European Tour school.
At Lundin, Andrew Oldcorn's 65 would have been two strokes higher had
not his caddie, reminded by the starter's warning to count the clubs in
the bag, discovered he had one more than the 14 limit. Oldcorn, winner
of the Jersey Open last month, discarded his No.1 iron.
He finished one ahead of a group including Aberdeen-based Geordie
Craig Cassells and New Zealander Greg Turner, who led the Open after the
first round last year.
Misfortune followed Hospital. He scored a 71 which included a penalty
for his ball moving when he went to tap in a three-inch putt. ''It was
one of those things, I touched it with my putter. I am not having good
luck this week,'' said the Spaniard.
Richard Boxall's 64 led at Scotscraig where, however, much interest
centred on the fortunes of Justin Rose, the 14-year-old who came through
the regional qualifying competition over his home course at North Hants,
where he had previously set the course record of 65 in winning the
Hampshire Hog.
Rose, born in South Africa and winner of the English under-16
championship 10 days ago, did his precocious reputation no damage with a
score of 72, two over par, but he would have been disappointed to have
taken three putts at the last, where his first had been for a birdie.
At Ladybank, the running was taken up with a 64 by Mark Brooks, winner
of four US Tour events. He had the same score in the second round of the
championship proper last year at Turnberry but by one stroke missed the
complete exemption that would have been his if he had finished among the
first 15 and ties.
At Leven, the leader on 63 was Fredrik Andersson, a 23-year-old Swede
who is attempting to qualify for the Open for the first time. In
achieving the lowest score of his career by two strokes, Andersson had
halves of 29-34, comprising eight birdies and no bogeys.
Ryder Cup Scot Gordon Brand Jr faces a struggle today after coming in
with a level-par 71, while 1987 Cup hero Christy O'Connor Jr shot a 69.

A more recent addition to Bank of Scotland's telephone banking service
is Phoneline. This service gives customers access to their bank account
24 hours a day, 365 days a year -- so they can do their banking at a
time convenient to them. Whether a customer wants to transfer money, pay
bills, amend direct debits or standing orders and much more, the bank's
specially trained staff are there to help. The service is free and calls
are charged at the local rate. Since Phoneline was launched two years
ago it has proved to be an invaluable asset to many Bank of Scotland
customers

AMONG the better known subsidiary companies of Bank of Scotland is the
British Linen Bank Group. This is headquartered in Edinburgh with
offices in London and Manchester. Its operations comprise banking,
finance and operating leasing, corporate finance advisory work, fund
management and investment banking.
The principal subsidiary within this group is the British Linen Bank
-- a merchant bank. The other main subsidiaries are Capital Leasing
Limited and Dunedin Fund Managers Limited.
The largest subsidiary in the Bank of Scotland Group is NWS BANK, a
major UK finance house. It was acquired by the bank in 1958 and is
headquartered in Chester. Its primary activities are providing personal
and business credit in the form of loans and instalment credit, and the
leasing of vehicles, plant and equipment.
On the rugby pitch, Scotland and Wales are competitors, but in banking
terms they have been close relations since Bank of Wales joined the Bank
of Scotland Group. Based in Cardiff, this regional bank provides banking
and financial services, mainly to corporate customers in Wales and the
nearby English counties.
Looking further afield, Bank of Scotland acquired Countrywide Banking
Corporation, a retail bank in New Zealand, in 1992. It is currently
introducing innovative, cost-effective distribution channels for its
products and services, using a mobile sales force supported by a
centralised telephone based banking service.
The bank's links with the southern hemisphere are further reinforced
with Kellock Holdings, the factoring subsidiary. There are two
divisions: Kellock Limited which services the UK and Scottish Pacific
Business Finance Pty Ltd based in Australia.
Factoring continues to be recognised as an efficient means of
financing expanding companies and has been endorsed by bodies such as
the DTI and CBI for the role it can play in financing the growth of
small and medium- sized companies. In recognition of this, Kellock has
recently established a Small Business Division.

DUMFRIES and Galloway is a drive of around one-and-a-half hours
through pleasant countryside from Scotland's main areas of population.
And this ease of access makes it the ideal place for a day trip where
little and large villages and small country towns offer a wealth of
interesting diversions. The area's crafts, culture and local delicacies
are also in abundance bringing further pleasure to those who venture
within its borders.
The ''best kept large village'' in Scotland is a boast that Moffat may
feel justified in shouting because it has won many awards in recent
years for its displays of flowers and well-kept parks. Relax amid the
scent of the flower beds in Station Park with its boating pond and
putting green, a popular pastime for the many visitors who have found
the pleasures of the spa town.
But there is more to the town and its many shops have Scottish-made
goods such as woollens, knitwear and tartan souvenirs, however, no visit
would be complete without purchasing a tin of the world-famous Moffat
toffee. If you like the town so much and your fancy is to stay overnight
then you may be able to get a bed in Britain's narrowest detached hotel,
as verified by the Guinness Book of Records.
Around Moffat a short drive along a twisty road will bring you to the
splendour of the Grey Mare's Tail, a 200ft cascade of water set below
the moorland aspect of White Coomb. Head out in another direction and
you will come to the Devil's Beef Tub, a huge natural depression, which
was once used by border reivers.
Some 17 miles south of Moffat lies the county town of Dumfries. Its
fame lies mainly with the connection with Robert Burns and the poet is
buried here in a mausoleum in the town's St Michael's churchyard. When
Burns died in 1796 more than 10,000 people attended the funeral which
started from the Midsteeple, a focal point in the town's High Street.
For the Burns enthusiast the town is a must visit and Burns House, the
Burns Centre and the Globe Inn all record events connected with the
poet's life.
Over the years the town has been well supported by the coach tour
operator, perhaps, because the variety of shops, typical of a county
town in quality and style are much demanded. Walks, parks and picnic
spots are in abundance by the town's River Nith where the caul, built to
harness water power in the last century, provides one of Scotland's most
photographed scenes.
Heading west, a pleasant drive is to take the Solway coast road to New
Abbey. Just before the small picturesque village is Shambellie House
museum which is home to a collection of period costumes in special
settings. In the village, however, is the splendid ruin of Sweetheart
Abbey, a thirteenth-century edifice in memory of John Baliol, husband of
Lady Devorgilla.
The coast road goes by the mud flats of the Solway and Criffel where
from its 1800ft may be viewed the peaks of the Lake District and the
Isle of Man. The climb starts from sea level and the views are really
quite rewarding at different stages of the ascent.
A few miles further is the championship golf course at Southerness and
nearby the recently opened John Paul Jones museum at Kirkbean. After
learning his trade in the Solway, Jones sailed for America where he
became the ''father of the American navy''.
He returned to do battle with the British and attacked the very areas
where he learned his seamanship. His efforts were well rewarded by the
Americans and also the French who gave him a gold sword. Jones is buried
at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.
The coast road eventually moves inland to the small granite-built town
of Dalbeattie near to which is the market town of Castle Douglas. Here
in a town where the A75 Euroroute has seen fit to bypass, is a
flourishing economy. Fashion shops, with clothes bearing the labels of
leading designers, are in depth and at close quarter.
Castle Douglas has indeed shown itself to be a place where not only
the fashion-conscious go but also those in search of a fine piece of
craft work. Designs Gallery has recently opened in the town's King
Street and offers a showcase for the work of Galloway craftsmen.
Lucy and Gus Carlow have had 15 years' experience in the craft world,
making and selling Celtic jewellery. And following their opening of a
small craft shop in Kirkcudbright four years ago, they had the idea of
creating an independent outlet for designers and crafts people from the
region and further afield.
Designs Gallery is an excellent idea and offers the visitor the best
of an area's crafts under one roof. Whether your inclination is towards
pottery, basketry, glass, jewellery or knitwear the best available in
Galloway is on display here in light, spacious and inviting premises.
But westward we go and to Creetown where we encounter an Oscar
nominee. Since its opening the Gem Rock Museum in Creetown has with the
greatest of ease picked up award after award. Best Welcome and Service
Award in 1987 was followed by a best visitor attraction award in 1993
with a Scottish Tourist Board Oscar nomination last year. The museum is
innovative, fascinating and offers the visitor an insight into
jewellery-making; the whole concept is refreshingly different.
The theme of the museum is to show how beautiful and interesting are
natural crystal minerals and fossils, in an untouched form as found in
the ground and then as polished and cut gems fit for any piece of
jewellery.
The museum with its display of natural minerals, crystals and
gemstones is considered by experts to be one of the best and most modern
of its kind. In the crystal cave fluorescent minerals and rare minerals
demonstrate their light emitting properties and when a volcanic eruption
begins it surely is time for Superman to make an appearance.
The road back to Dumfries takes 45 minutes but before we leave the
area or decide to stop over in one of the many village hotels, a trip
north towards Moniaive reveals a house where song is in the air.
Maxwelton House, a splendid fifteenth-century mansion, incorporates
the round tower of Glencairn Castle and is famous as the birthplace of
Bonnie Annie Laurie, the heroine of the well-known love song. The song
was written by William Douglas for Annie and in it he promised to ''lay
me down to dee'' and she had given him ''her promise true'', however,
she was not to be trusted and married another some years later.
Maxwelton House has undergone a major restoration since its purchase
by the Stenhouse family in 1968 and the house with its attractive
gardens has given itself to a museum of agriculture and domestic life.
Nearby is Maxwelton chapel which was built in 1868 by Isabella Laurie.
Its location is truly beautiful, overlooking a duck pond and surrounded
by mature woodland and banks of rhododendrons which supply a festoon of
colour in season.
This is but a sliver of the attractions in Dumfries and Galloway
worthy of a visit but the best thing is to see for yourself, it isn't
far.

COLIN Jackson, so badly injured on Saturday that he withdrew from the
AAA Championships in Birmingham, flew immediately to Italy and collected
a reputed $35,000 for a world-class hurdles victory yesterday in
13.32sec.
''Did he fly via Lourdes?'' was the question posed by cynics at the
KP-backed championships.
Jackson's first success of the season over German giant Florian
Schwarthoff, following three defeats, triggered stunned surprise from
his personal adviser, UK coaching director Malcolm Arnold. ''I am
mesmerised -- I can't understand it,'' said Arnold.
Peter Radford, chief executive of the British Athletic Federation,
could scarcely conceal his anger, and confirmed he will demand an
explanation from Jackson, who may face disciplinary action.
His conduct was the final blow for BAF officials trying to come to
terms with the fact that three reigning track champions may be unable to
defend their world titles in Gothenburg next month.
Sally Gunnell, the grand-slam gold medallist, announced yesterday that
she has definitely ruled herself out of the 400 metres hurdles in
Sweden; Linford Christie will fly today to Germany in a self-professed
state of panic, hoping to find a cure for a knee-tendon problem; while
Jackson, despite yesterday's success, is still doubtful over his
participation.
''If I can sort out some technical problems, I feel I'll be okay,''
said Jackson. ''But I will not decide about Gothenburg until I have gone
through my final training in Monaco.'' However, the UK selectors, who
announce their team this morning, could apply some sanction.
Jackson opted out of the hurdles at the AAA event yesterday, and
instead raced the flat 100m on Saturday, leaving him clear to fly to
Italy in the evening. He withdrew after the first round of the 100m in
Birmingham, pleading a tight adductor muscle.
Radford said it was ''self-evident'' that the sport, fans, sponsors,
and TV had been let down.
''The evidence he gave here this weekend is that he is not fit for a
series of races. I would like to be convinced that he is fit for that.''
Neither Christie nor Jackson has signed a new code of conduct required
by the sport, though many others have. ''The sooner all our leading
competitors are on contracts, the better,'' added professor Radford.
When Britain's team is announced this morning Olympic champion
Christie will be en route for a consultation with Dr Hans-Wilhelm
Muller-Wolfahrt, the Munich guru whose clientele reads like a Who's Who
of sport.
Christie was also at the centre of furious controversy. Chasing a
record-breaking eighth 100m title, he was eliminated after finishing
fourth in his heat. His respect for the occasion seemed in question as
he crossed the line chewing gum. He said he had problems with a tendon
which he hopes will be successfully treated in Germany.
Realising he had let down the crowd, some of whom had paid #18 per
seat, he made an impassioned appeal for reinstatement, which was
initially declined by track referee Maureen Smith. Scotland's former
Commonwealth champion, Ian Stewart, head of promotions, said: ''I take
responsibility for the decision to allow Christie to run.''
This decision, without precedent in the 115-year history of the
championship, saw Christie excluded from the semis, but allowed to run
as a guest in the final, which he won in 10.18sec, showing no sign of
trouble. A small but significant number of spectators booed as he
crossed the line.
Tom McKean and Brian Whittle suffered one of the worst days of their
career and cannot expect to be named today.

RAIL services in Scotland are set to grind to a halt again tomorrow as
members of the Aslef train drivers' union stage the second in a series
of one-day strikes over pay.
The first stoppage last week wiped out all British Rail passenger
services in Scotland and all but a handful of services south of the
Border.
A second strike tomorrow looks inevitable after a weekend of
continuing stalemate in the dispute.
British Rail insisted yesterday that its 3% offer was final but Aslef
repeated that its 12,000 members deserved a higher rise to reward
productivity improvements.
A new row broke out over the weekend when Aslef accused BR of paying
40 senior executives bonuses of up to 20% and challenged the board to a
TV debate about the dispute.
BR countered that paying directors one third of their salaries in
performance-linked bonuses was normal for nationalised industries.
Meanwhile, Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's personnel director, yesterday
accused the Aslef executive of ''blundering'' into trouble.
He said the railways would lose customers if the dispute continued and
maintained that Aslef was ''out on a limb''.
But the union's general secretary, Mr Lew Adams, said the strikes were
the ''inevitable backlash'' after years of below-inflation pay rises.
Tomorrow's strike will also affect some services early on Wednesday.
A ScotRail spokeswoman said eight pre-6.30am services in the
Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive area had been cancelled.
An InterCity East Coast spokesman said the 6.10am London Kings Cross
to Edinburgh would not run, and the 12am Edinburgh to Kings Cross would
be cancelled between Edinburgh and Newcastle and would leave Newcastle
at 1.30pm.
Ballot results to be announced this week are expected to lead to an
escalation in the rail dispute, with plans for co-ordinated strikes by
train drivers and London Underground workers.
About 2000 London Underground engineers belonging to the Rail,
Maritime, and Transport union are expected to vote today for strikes
over a job security dispute. On Wednesday, Aslef's Tube drivers are
expected to back one-day strikes over pay.

''WE counted them out and we counted them back in again,'' said Mossie
as the Irishman left with his little truck to try four of his heifers at
the sale of bullers at Thainstone.
A lot of people wonder why the Irishman was so willing to help Mossie
with his marketing after Mossie sold him his farm for a Buchan record
price.
Well, I think the Irishman is after his revenge. By getting Mossie
back into cattle (which our man hates and refers to as the
''loss-adjusters''), he hopes to inflict some sort of emerald
retribution.
At any rate, 100 loss-adjusters arrived at Moss-side last back-end.
Black heifers, they were bought near the bottom end of the market. They
were maintained on two pounds of the Irishman's patent meal and Mossie's
ammonia-treated straw.
They did well and some even became fat. Others sold quite handily on
to the grass, Mossie is pleased and his banker is delighted. ''Yes,
Mossie's heifers are ahead of budget,'' he told me when I was in to see
him the other day.
''We budgeted for a loss of #50 a head and he's only lost #45 -- some
going, eh?''
Yes indeed, but, as anyone who has kept cattle knows, it is easy to do
well on the first half of the cattle. The problem comes with the
tail-enders. They are proving ''stiffer to cash''.
And I don't know what the Irishman is up to but he seems to be making
it a point of honour, as the original buyer of these cattle, to see
Mossie's losses minimised. So he has been running around with little
batches of heifers trying them in this market and that.
And that is why Mossie was quoting from the Falklands War when he
waved goodbye to the Irishman and his four heifers on Friday. He counted
them out all right.
But Brian Hanrahan on the deck of his aircraft carrier never achieved
with the fighter bombers what Mossie did with the heifers at Thainstone.
When the Irishman brought the heifers back and he counted them back in
there were five heifers where he had only counted four out.
''Well, it's like this, Mossie. It was a cheap sale so I couldn't sell
your heifers. In fact, they were that cheap I thought it was grand
opportunity for to buy. She's a nice heifer, isn't she?''
Sadly, he was asking the wrong man.
Maybe the Irishman is trying to bankrupt Mossie after-all?
I'm afraid I've been in the heifer trade myself. You will recall that
on the spring day I sold 15 of my last season's heifer calves. They were
well grown and all 15 went for breeding which I was very happy about. It
meant my buyers thought they looked well and would breed well.
They were right, too. In fact, they were too right. One has calved
already.
That was not a credit to my stockmanship.
The heifer is less than 15 months old which means she fell to one of
her half-brothers when she was five months old.
It is difficult to know what to do about this. We have stopped
castrating the bull calves. They grow faster with testicles and the
market no longer pays a premium for steer beef so why pay the vet to
come and castrate them? It is not a job I fancy myself, not on either
side of the fence.
We could separate the cows with bull calves from those with heifers,
but when you've only got 40 cows that becomes a bit unpractical.
Anyway, this 14-month-old heifer had been seen calving by a neighbour
and they had managed to get a calf out of her which was not yet dead.
Would I take her back?
Now the rules are that if a beast that sold clean turns out in calf
the seller must take her back and pay full compensation for her
transport feed and medication, offer a rebate of a third of the price or
make other acceptable arrangements. But the seller must be informed
before she calves.
My buyer was too late to have any legal claim, but that was not the
point. The heifer was not going to fit in with his breeding pattern now
that she had calved out of season and she'd never be the sort of big cow
this man was looking for.
I had sold something which did not meet her trade description. It is
bad enough doing that without getting a reputation for being hard to
deal with.
So I borrowed the Irishman's cairtie and off I went to see what fate
had landed me with. I didn't ask if it was a bull because you don't get
told about such bull calves. They carry #100 worth of subsidy into the
world.
The mother was all right, though sore about the backend. The calf was
huge in relation to her teenage mother but not yet on her feet though
this was her fourth day.
I returned the buying bill of #440 and #60 for her keep and a fiver
a-piece to the cattlemen. We loaded them up and off she went back to
Little Ardo.
At #515 the Irishman was not impressed with my purchase. ''Would that
calvie have had its colostrum?''
''Definitely. The cow is very handy and they were able to milk her and
the stockman was most particular that she had had plenty of colostrum.''
The Irishman was doubtful. ''It's just that it might have been the
same 'particular' man who didn't notice that the heifer was in calf
until a neighbour told him she was calving.''
Anyway, all is well. The first day I held her up to suck. The second
day she stood on her knees and now my #515 looks like money well spent.
She is still knuckling on one leg, as I write, but will be gambolling
with the others before you read this.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977354896</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IN this country the growth of grass is not affected by any trace
element deficiencies.
However, the trace element content of grassland herbage is significant
with regard to the diet of grazing animals. The trace elements concerned
are cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum and selenium.
The most important factor which influences the trace element content
of grassland is the type of soil. For example, soils derived from
granitic rocks produce herbage which has a very low cobalt content.
However, other factors, some of which are under the control of farmers,
can markedly affect the trace element content of herbage.
Application of lime increases the soil pH but reduces the uptake of
cobalt, copper and manganese by animals. Therefore, overliming should be
avoided; a soil pH value of 5.8 is quite adequate for grassland.
Sward composition affects its trace element content. Clovers along
with certain broad-leaved plants and heathers are almost always richer
in trace elements than grasses.
As plants mature the trace element content of the dry matter
decreases. At maturity the leaves contain higher concentrations of trace
elements than the stems. The copper content of grasses declines rapidly
as they reach the heading stage. Therefore, hay made from a well-headed
stemming crop of grass can have a rather low copper content. Good
pasture management, keeping the herbage at an immature leafy stage of
growth, has much to commend it.
Phosphate and potash have almost no effect on the trace element
content of individual plants. Heavy dressings of nitrogen may have a
small effect by causing very rapid growth and ''diluting'' the trace
element content of the dry matter.
The main effect of fertilisers is to change the balance of species in
the sward. Phosphate can encourage clover and large applications of
nitrogen often result in pastures composed entirely of grasses.
Before any treatment is given it is essential that correct diagnosis
of any trace element problem in livestock is made. Copper salts applied
to the soil usually only increase the copper content of the herbage by
small amounts. This form of treatment cannot be guaranteed to raise the
copper content to adequate levels for grazing animals.
Copper sprayed directly on to growing grassland may increase its
copper content to dangerously high levels. Like many trace elements,
copper can be toxic as well as deficient. If the diet of grazing animals
contains inadequate amounts of copper it must be fed to them directly or
given by injection under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon.
Similarly, soil applications of manganese do not increase the
manganese content of the grassland to a significant extent. Selenium
applied as a pasture top-dressing results at first in herbage levels of
selenium which may be toxic.
However, the selenium content of the pasture rapidly declines and
after a few months disappears altogether. Therefore, selenium top
dressings are not recommended.
As in the case of copper, animals must be treated directly with
selenium under veterinary supervision. When cobalt salts are applied to
the soil the cobalt content of grassland herbage is usually increased to
adequate levels for at least one year and often more. This increase is
more persistent on organic soils and peats than on mineral soils.

IT LIES beyond the Loch of the Beast, in the land of black fairies and
giants with the second-sight. It is hidden from view by a high moor, and
the road that meanders vaguely towards it has no number.
Few people are aware of its existence, and those who have fallen under
its spell want to keep it that way. It is almost, but not quite, an
illusion.
For centuries, Mellon Udrigal has been the kind of place that dreams
and legends are made of. A hamlet of white-washed cottages by a golden
beach in the West Highlands, its remoteness has enabled it to regard the
passage of time with casual indifference.
Surrounded by the magnificent mountains and seascapes of Wester Ross,
it has been the jealously guarded secret of a few crofters and holiday
makers who prize its tranquillity.
Until its cover was blown recently on Radio 4's Any Questions, that
is. For one brief, unexpected moment, the name of Mellon Udrigal
reverberated throughout the land as the most beautiful place in the
British Isles. The authority who declared it so was Mr Andrew Marr,
associate editor of the Independent, who has been visiting it regularly
for more than 20 years.
Mr Marr's enthusiasm for the place amused his fellow panelists and
intrigued millions of listeners. In the place with the funny name that
nobody had heard of, however, it caused a ripple of anxiety.
To understand why, it is necessary to drive for about three miles
along a single track road with passing places on a promontory between
Loch Ewe and Little Loch Broom. As the road climbs through bleak
moorland, it passes a dark stretch of water with a fearsome reputation.
The Loch na Beiste, as its Gaelic name suggests, was the lair of a
creature which terrorised the local population in the early 19th century
-- until it had the temerity to appear before Mr Sandy MacLeod, an elder
of the Free Church of Scotland. The wrath of the kirk being roused, the
loch was partially drained and 14 sacks of lime were poured into a deep
hole found in the middle of it. The kelpie, or water-horse, was never
seen again.
A little further on, where the road breasts a slight rise, Mellon
Udrigal appears unannounced as a scattering of cottages and caravans,
and a red telephone box, in a valley bounded by low hills and the sea.
Its name is less lyrical than it sounds -- a hybrid of Gaelic and Old
Norse, it means the Little Hill of the Outer Ravine. But enveloped in
rain and mist, it has a mystical, detached air evoking a history of odd
happenings. It was here in 1822 that the bay, from the Summer Isles to
the mouth of Little Loch Broom, was suddenly filled with warships. As
the villagers watched in trepidation, boats filled with soldiers in
scarlet uniforms headed towards the shore. Mrs Morrison, who then lived
at Mellon Udrigal House, buried boxes of valuables in the sand, and
girls fled into the hills as the redcoats reached the beach. But they
never came to the houses, because they were an illusion.
Mr John H. Dixon, FSA Scot., who recorded the mass hallucination four
years later in his book Gairloch, concluded: ''The evidence is very
strong that the soldiers really were seen as stated.''
The community is no longer troubled by ghosts, but it has been
disturbed by the spectre of being inundated by Radio 4 listeners. Local
crofter Ian MacIver expresses a widely held view when he says: ''Life is
rather quiet here, and we would like to keep it like that.
Life is changing, albeit slowly, for the 17 permanent residents and a
fluctuating population of caravan dwellers who descend on the village
every summer. There is still no hotel, no guest house, no pub, and no
shop; but there are only three working crofts left, and ''incomers'' are
beginning to outnumber the descendants of the original Gaelic-speaking
community.
There seems to be no conflict, however. Mr MacIver, who owns the
caravan site, says: ''Most of the campers have been coming here for at
least 20 years. They are well behaved people who are sympathetic to the
place, and it's only natural that some of them want to retire here. We
all get on very well, and they've always been very helpful in the
lambing season.''
When the rain passes and the mist clears, it is easy to understand why
the residents of Mellon Udrigal cherish their solitude. Sunshine
transforms their surroundings into a magical vista of distant mountains
shimmering above a bay dotted with islands. In the course of a single
day, the mood of the landscape changes repeatedly and dramatically with
the weather; the effect is of being inside a giant kaleidoscope.
In their caravan by the shore, Len and Helen Tait have a large framed
photograph of the sun rising over the mountains of Coigach. The sea
beneath is like liquid gold.
''That is the main reason we come here year after year,'' Mr Tait
says. ''Look out that window and you'll see natural beauty that hasn't
changed for thousands of years. If this place was ever developed, its
charm would be ruined. It's selfish of us, of course, but we'd like to
keep it to ourselves.''
The retired teachers from Greenock are quite happy to share their
rural idyll with Mr MacIver's sheep, of course, and with the schools of
dolphin and the occasional whales that cruise around the bay.
They also take a keen interest in aspects of crofting life. Thus we
learn that Miss Ellie, an ancient ewe supposed to be too old for
lambing, recently delivered twins after catching the eye of a ram on a
neighbouring croft.
In the old schoolhouse there is another framed photograph, of angry
seas surging against dark rocks in a winter storm. It was taken by
Cleveland Patterson, a retired university professor from Montreal, who
bought the virtually derelict building as a vacation home 11 years ago.
The dramatic scenery is the main attraction for Mr Patterson and his
wife Margaret, who intend spending four or five months here every year.
''The other thing is the whole pace of life is so relaxed,'' he says.
''The people are courteous and honest. It's a wonderful antidote to the
pressures of life in the city.'' Mrs Patterson, having been born and
brought up in Ireland, felt instantly at home in Mellon Udrigal. ''I
looked at the view and it was so beautiful I just cried,'' she says.
In keeping with the enchanting nature of the place, there is a a ghost
train which occasionally chugs through a kind of fairy glen about a mile
from the village. More than 30 years after it was scrapped, the LNER
Pacific A2/3 engine Dante is running again, trailing hot cinders in a
rush of fire and steam reminiscent of the days when it pulled the Heart
of Midlothian express. The large scale model represents decades of work
by Derek ''Dixie'' Dean, a former BOAC engineer from Hampshire, who
retired to a cottage near Mellon Udrigal with his wife Jane 20 years
ago. The engine in its green livery is a work of art which any museum
would be proud of, and the 400-yard raised track running around a garden
planted with 1500 trees is a remarkable feat of engineering. A principal
feature is a 95ft tunnel blasted through solid rock. Mrs Dean says her
husband built the tunnel in three months, and it took her several years
to clear up the mess.
''We love the peace and quiet, and of course the views are
wonderful,'' says Mr Dean. ''But I can't sit still, I'm afraid. I've
always got to be doing something.''
What he does, with consummate precision and skill, is make beautiful
models of trains and boats and planes. His workshop is a kind of Santa's
grotto of Clyde puffers, gliders, and tank locomotives, each constructed
with meticulous attention to detail. The propellor of a USAF Auster
spotter plane adorns one of the roof beams, and an old flying helmet and
goggles decorating a football evoke the days when Mr Dean used to fly
Hornet Moths for fun.
The only thing he misses in the wilds of Wester Ross is classical
concerts -- he used to play the oboe in an operatic society. In a big
house on the hill overlooking the beach, Mr MacIver's mother Alice and
her sister Jessie contemplate the changing character of Mellon Udrigal
with mixed feelings. In the soft, lilting accent of the native Gaelic
speaker, Alice says: ''The English who live here are very nice people.
They are very good at helping us on the croft, but life is quite
different here now.''
''In the old days,'' Jessie says, ''we had corn and barley, and
potatoes, and turnips, and lovely hay, and we had our own milk and eggs.
Now you can't put anything in the ground for the rabbits. They even eat
the flowers in the garden.''
The ladies are happy to show photographs of their father's thatched
croft house, which is now in ruins on the hillside, and share memories
of the days when they each took peat for the fire in the school. ''The
postman used to come on a bicycle,'' Alice recalls. ''Now we've got an
Englishman that comes in a car.''
''Life is a lot easier now, but it's different,'' Jessie says.
''People used to visit each other a lot more in the old days. But it's
the same all over the Highlands, with the young people going away. The
incomers are very nice, but it's not the same any more.''
Odd things still happen in this erstwhile kingdom of mythical
creatures. One of the strangest and most sinister occurences took place
in the autumn of 1941, when a group of men rowed to an island in the bay
with a canister of brown, soup-like liquid. This they placed on the
ground next to an explosive charge, and then they withdrew.
When the container blew up, Gruinard Island was contaminated by deadly
bacillus anthracis, otherwise known as concentrated anthrax.
The Ministry of Defence claimed to have cleared the island of spores
from its chemical warfare experiment in 1990, but it is still
uninhabited. Periodic hill-burning on Gruinard does, however, provide
local wags with an opportunity to persuade gullible tourists that they
are witnessing a rare volcanic eruption.
The latest tremor, from the Radio 4 broadcast, appears to be
subsiding. No hordes have been spotted swarming over the hills around
the Loch of the Beast, and Mellon Udrigle is gradually regaining its
composure -- and its air of mystery.
One minute it is sparkling in the sunshine, a vision of wild beauty;
the next it is lost in a swirling sea-mist. The departing visitor
looking back at the opaque gloom wonders if Mellon Udrigal, like the
redcoat soldiers, was just an illusion after all.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie island hops to communities which make the most of
their natural assets
COLL and Tiree lie out in the Atlantic, as far west as you can go in
the Inner Hebrides. They are beautiful small islands with white sandy
beaches and, inland, the machair is a blaze of small summer flowers.
Tiree, which figures in many a shipping forecast, means ''land of
corn'' in Gaelic and was once known as the granary of Scotland. Then,
its small fields were rich in cereals. Now, as the small plane swoops
down to the airport, the view is filled with cattle and sheep, which far
outnumber the human population of around 800.
It is a lively community, with farms and a few small businesses, a
couple of hotels, primary and secondary schools, and two churches, all
going about their daily tasks.
Though both are welcoming and friendly islands, neither Tiree nor
Coll, each some 12 by three miles, has been swamped by visitors. There
is a sense of space and freedom that comes partly from the moving sea
all around, warm enough in summer for swimming and sunbathing, and from
the great sweeps of sandy beaches.
On Tiree, the white sheen of the two-mile stretch of Gott Bay is the
result of the crushing of millions of small shells. Coll, though
rockier, has the same mixture and also small lochs and burns full of
fish. It is a wonderful place for spotting seals and otters, with boat
journeys to the isles of Soay or Gunna, where the seals lie thick and
unafraid.
Many know Tiree for Skerryvore Lighthouse, a massive feat of
nineteenth century construction, 12 miles out to sea. Today, the old
storehouses that served the lighthouse bear the name of the builder,
Alan Stevenson, uncle to Robert Louis. The long stone house sits above
the sea at Hynish in the south, and has been restored by the Hebridean
Trust. A Grade 'A' listed building, it can now accommodate parties of up
to 24 people in great comfort.
The trust's aim is to preserve and develop the Hebridean way of life .
. . ''to put something into island areas in the right way,'' is how it
is summed up by Monica Smith, warden at Alan Stevenson House, ''and here
we are open to any groups with a common aim.''
The youngest visitors so far were around 11, the oldest a group of
disabled people in their fifties and sixties. The fresh, local food is
superb, and plentiful enough to fill the eager wind-surfers who are
lured to Tiree by the great Atlantic rollers, particularly during the
autumn competition time.
The trust has also restored the old signalling tower, which linked
base and lighthouse, as a museum commemorating the heroic building saga.
From here, we peered out at the lighthouse through a telescope. But the
biggest restoration has been Stevenson's huge dock below Ben Hynish,
once used for the lighthouse boats and still capable of use today.
The sound of Coll is the strange creaking noise of the corncrake, in
one of its last Scottish sanctuaries. Though the islanders' attitude to
the bird that keeps them awake through the spring and summer nights is a
mixture of love and loathing, for birders, it is better than a Bach
cantata. Much of Coll holds sheep but in recognition of its importance
as a corncrake site, the RSPB has formed a reserve in the west of the
island, some five miles from Arinagour where the ferry comes in.
Walking here, it is essential to avoid the hay-meadows that become the
livestock's winter feed and are the place where the corncrakes breed. In
any case, so stealthy are the birds, that it is difficult to see one. I
only heard them but the volume indicates that the RSPB's policy of
encouraging the old traditional pattern of cutting grass late is paying
off, and Charlie Self, the RSPB warden, conducts guided walks.
With luck, Coll also offers a sight of an otter, has birds from Arctic
skuas to nesting shedluck and the flash of a wheatear. At around 130,
the human population cannot compete but the island has a hotel and
shops, fishing in loch or sea and even a nine-hole golf course. It was
all over too soon but, as the ferry left the dock at Arinagour,
threading its way past Mull to the mainland world at Oban, watching from
the deck it still seemed as though somehow a part of these small islands
had come back with us.

''BRITAIN'S most boring bank''. . . ''has made dullness a virtue''. .
. ''bank's boring old profits''... what is going on?
These are some of the comments from the City pages that greeted Bank
of Scotland's latest results. Are these the same results that showed a
67% rise in annual profits to #450m? Is this the same bank that doubled
its UK market share this decade?
The answer is yes. But to understand the press comment you have to
understand that news is what is out of the ordinary.
This explains why Lex, the respected Financial Times column, went on
to say: ''The business's steadiness helps to explain 300 years of
consistent profitability and, more recently, why the bank has
outperformed the sector by nearly 100% since 1980.''
When Sir Bruce Pattullo asked at the announcement of the results,
''Twenty-three years of dividend growth -- is that boring?'', the answer
could have been: ''Yes, to a journalist or to one or two of the younger
financial analysts.''
To shareholders, customers and staff, however, it is the kind of
steady, predictable progress they all want to hear. When your interest
in the bank is more than finding an exciting headline about it, the
results look far from dull.
The record annual pre-tax profits pushed the share price up by only 1p
because good results had, again, been expected. The fluctuation in the
share prices has been far less marked than most of the sector.
One effect of the results was to raise expectations for next year's
results and the City has put the bank shares on over eight times
earning, a rating which broker Strauss Turnbull described as
''demanding''.
City analysts have something in common with sports commentators: the
better you perform, the more is expected of you.
An important reason why the bank pleases investors and customers more
than journalists is that it is not a victim of trends. As the Guardian
City writer put it: ''It is not heavily into trading or derivations so
has not experienced a devastating downturn in dealing profits.''
She added that ''such a blatant disregard for the go-go practices of
the 1980s'' is the ''sort of stuff that is all too rarely heard in
banking circles''.
The Financial Times was just as clear: ''Shunning the latest fashion,
whether Third World lending or banc-assurance, Bank of Scotland has
continued to grow and make money from old-fashioned lending.
''Its low costs and careful lending policies have borne fruit: while
other UK clearing banks have reported falling operating profits before
provisions, Bank of Scotland raised its by 14%.''
In fact the operating profits of all the London clearing banks were
down around 10%.
The bank increased its total dividend by 15% but made no special
payment because of the tercentenary, in contrast to Germany's Deutsche
Bank which last year marked its 125th anniversary with a special
dividend. Bank of Scotland's decision not to do the same was ''totally
in keeping with the bank's conservatism'', said the FT.
Even The Herald, which is closer to the bank's roots, two months ago
called it ''a bastion of Caledonian conservatism''.
Far from resenting these back-handed compliments, one always gets the
impression the bank greets them with a wry smile. Good business lasts
longer than good headlines.
''I regard it as a compliment,'' said treasurer and chief general
manager Peter Burt. ''We are predictable; being predictable is a great
virtue both for customers and for staff.''
In the same way the fevered speculation about which bank might bid for
which building society was greeted with studied calm. Bank of Scotland
had talked to a couple of building societies but would follow what was
right for the business rather than fashion.
There would be advantages and disadvantages in such a move. While it
would bring more outlets across a wider geographical area, it would also
bring the overheads and staff costs of a larger network.
This is not the caution of indecisiveness or inaction but of thorough
research. For this is the same bank which a decade ago introduced a
non-traditional delivery system so it could enter the English market
without the expense of a branch network.
''We don't need to take over anybody,'' said Peter Burt. ''There is
plenty of opportunity for organic growth.''
Younger analysts may be less aware of the lead role the bank took in
pioneering electronic technology, including the Transcontinental
Automated Payments System (TAPS) which went on to win a Government
contract to pay pensions to Britons abroad, and HOBS, the first home and
office banking service.
Though not taken for granted, electronic banking remains an area of
expertise in the bank. Introduced 10 years ago. HOBS remains a market
leader and the proportion of customers using it is still growing.
The bank has developed niche markets such as lending to housing
associations and nursing homes and is alone in growing its share of the
lending market.
Being alone in achieving this growth led some analysts to question
whether the quality of lending was being maintained but research into
the corporate lending of UK banks by Broker BZW suggested that it was.
The verdict of BZW's banking analyst was the bank was a good lender
and had ''high-quality lending managers''. The bad debt charge in the
accounts, although 29% down on the previous year, appeared
characteristically cautious.
Almost unnoticed by some analysts, the bank provides specialist
finance including management buy-out funding in which activity it
remains a leading arranger of senior debt in the UK, ahead of NatWest
and the Midland with Samuel Montagu.
It has also been able to contain its costs without the redundancies
that other banks have endured. Its cost-income ratio rose by 1.2% over
the previous year but ironically this was mainly as a result of higher
returns on shareholders' funds.
This resulted in higher payments to employees under the Staff Profit
Sharing Scheme, which are included in the cost base figures. Of its
latest profits, more than #27m will go to the bank's 15,500 employees.
Without this increase the cost-income ratio would have risen by only
0.1%. Even with all this, Bank of Scotland still has the lowest
cost:income ratio of all the banks at 49.8%.
Its record of uninterrupted dividend growth for 23 years or
outperforming the sector by 100% in 15 years is a remarkable
achievement. Perhaps no-one can find consistently good results exciting
year after year, but dull? Hardly.

Robert Burns scribbled a poem on the back of a Bank of Scotland
one-guinea note, lamenting his financial situation. The original is
preserved at Burns's Cottage in Alloway.
Wae worth thy power, thou' cursed leaf!
Fell source o a' my woe and grief,
For lack o thee I've lost my lass,
For lack o thee I scrimp my glass!
I see the children of affliction
Unaided, through thy curs'd restriction.
I've seen the oppressor's cruel smile
Amid his hapless victims' spoil;
And for thy potence vainly wish'd,
To crush the villain in the dust.
For lack o thee, I leave this much-lov'd shore,
Never, perhaps, to greet old Scotland more.

rewarding but you should remember that they are risk investments. Share
prices go down as well as up and the value of your PEP can fall below
your original investment. Income derived from share investments can fall
as well as rise. PEPs offer tax breaks. If you do not pay income tax you
are unlikely to derive any financial benefit from a PEP so you probably

Rennie McOwan is inspired by the town which honours a man for all
seasons
SOMETIMES people find themselves in a position to make decisions that
reverberate over the years. We all owe a debt of thanks to a German
commander during the Allies advance towards Rome in the latter days of
the Second World War.
He let the Allied forces know that the city of Assisi, strategically
sited on a long spur of Mount Subasio, had been turned by him into a
medical centre for the wounded of all the clashing armies and this
unforgettable home of St Francis escaped the fate of Monte Cassino.
Italy is rich in hilltop towns and cities, but medieval Assisi is
truly special. Modern administrators and planners have kept a tight grip
of it.
The small city looks like part of an ancient painting -- high,
soaring, white, yellow and brown walls set against a brilliantly blue
sky and with a patchwork of fields and olive groves, golden saffron,
emerald, stretching all around.
Assisi lies in the province of Perugia, in Umbria, the green heart of
Italy. It is attractive walking country on mule trails and forest
tracks, well within reach of a day's coach outing from Rome and worth
spending days on end just wandering and browsing and getting the feel of
the place. It has a population of around 30,000.
There are rounded hills in deep river valleys and plains and the huge
oak woods produce the famous Umbrian truffles -- the higher, mountain
pastures are a riot of flowers in spring and summer.
Wealthy Romans came here centuries ago to escape the demands of the
city -- some things never change -- and to relax in luxurious villas,
the white settlers of their day. Sometimes they got caught up in the
hot-blooded feuds that went on between the fiercely independent hill
towns.
The spirit of St Francis is in the city, with thousands of pilgrims
coming to see the huge churches and the frescoes and to try and
understand this small man with the indomitable spirit who set out to
reform the church of his day and who had a deep and burning love of
nature. Nowadays he would have been on top of the Brent Spar.
A sense of caution is needed when purchasing tourism literature about
St Francis because I read some that made one gulp, such was the
adulation. But the reality is greater than the myths and the stories.
Among other things, Francis gave us the Christmas crib. He founded
hermitages in woods and caves, and when he turned one into a church,
thousands of local people came on Christmas night. A manger-turned-crib
was the centre piece and Francis, who was not a priest, read the
Nativity gospel from the Bible.
He was born around 1181, the son of a prosperous cloth merchant. His
parents' house can still be seen. He became a thorough nuisance,
drinking with his friends, getting into fights, and annoying other
people -- all against the background of a corrupt church and a harsh
world where many ill people, including lepers, were shunned.
He had a Christian conversion and took to the road. He gave away his
material possessions, lived rough, and began helping destitute men and
women. Others joined him and there was much head shaking in his father's
family. He strove to make the Church less wordly and more true to its
mission.
Thousands of words -- and at least two films -- have been written or
made about his relationship with St Clare, a rich lady of Assisi, with
whom he had an intellectual and non-sexual love affair.
She too, shocked friends and family by throwing herself wholeheartedly
into good deeds and works. She became a nun, in the fashion of the time,
and set up a female equivalent of St Francis' band of brothers which
still flourishes. There is a huge convent in Assisi to this day.
Francis and his friends wore rags, lived in huts, and travelled all
over Italy. In a startling show of courage he visited the Saracen leader
in 1219 at a time when the Crusaders had behaved with great cruelty and
talked to him about Christianity.
It would be like visiting Iraq or Saudi Arabia today, insisting on
setting up a place of Christian worship, and preaching the Gospel at
every opportunity in public places. Nowadays, there's a chance he would
never be seen again and the same perils or worse operated in his day. He
survived and was treated as he was, a truly holy person.
He wanted people to live simply and to be joyful by not having an
over-attachment to material things and to have a life of the spirit. He
loved nature and people and if the green movement of today ever needs a
patron saint he surely fits the bill. He founded the worldwide
organisation, the Franciscans, the Order of Friars Minor, (the adjective
was deliberately chosen to be modest) who run hospitals and schools and
look after Christian sites in the Holy Land.
Francis wrote the first, great Italian poem in the vernacular, the
Canticle of the Sun, a hymn of praise to nature, and he spoke of Brother
Sun, Sister Water, Brother Fire and Mother Earth. He saw that the world
was beautiful, but the action of people made it ugly through greed,
desire, and exploitation.
He was not an eco-freak or a hippy drop out. He was frequently
misunderstood and the depth of that misunderstanding can be seen in
Assisi. It is ironic that this back-to-basics man, who lived and
worshipped in caves, huts and grottoes, should be commemorated in some
of Italy's most prestigious church buildings.
Future generations, impressed and moved by his dedication and care for
humanity, felt they had to honour him, but could not break free from the
memorial patterns of their own day. Yet, in a topsy-turvy way, we also
benefit from the great buildings of Assisi and their frescoes and
paintings although they are not what Francis wanted.
The huge St Francis Basilica is two churches, one above the other. It
is said that in the lower church people can pray on St Francis' tomb and
in the upper they can pray directly to heaven. The basilica was begun in
1228, two years after Francis' death. The first stone was laid by the
Pope Gregory IX.
The saint's body had been buried in the church of San Giorgio and was
transferred to the basilica. In the fourteenth century, cardinals and
patron princes enriched the building with pictures and ornate tombs.
The famed frescoes by Giotta and his students, finished in 1228, were
the visual aids of their day, telling a largely illiterate audience of
St Rufino. You can see the font in which Francis and Clare were baptised
and through a small door the visitor descends into the oratory of St
Francis, a kind of cave in which he prayed. The church of Santa Chiara
(St Clare) was built on the site of San Giorgio and incorporates part of
the older building.
Not far from Assisi lies one of the most visited churches in Italy,
Santa Maria degli Angeli, which was built in 1569 and includes an
infirmary cell in which St Francis died.
The centuries pass and things change. The Piazza del Comune, in
Assisi, was once the centre of a Roman city and the columns of the
temple of Minerva can be seen. They were built in the first centuries of
the Roman Empire and the interior was turned into a church.
Soldiers, musicians, boisterous young men, corrupt officials, artists,
flower people, great builders, beggars, lepers, priests, nuns and
thousands of pilgrims have all known Assisi. St Francis will never be
forgotten.
He is truly a man for all seasons . . . and among the people he
influenced was a wartime commander and, in turn, one of Europe's most
picturesque cities survived in its ancient splendour.

FROM its start in the seventeenth century, Bank of Scotland has had
strong ties to the business community. Its founder John Holland was a
prosperous merchant and worked for the East India Trading Company.
He and the East India's auditor-general, Francis Beyer, founded the
bank to support the interests of Scottish merchants based in London.
That tradition of support for business continues today.
''Partnerships are vital in all walks of life,'' said Ronnie Steedman,
director of business banking. ''Good relationships are built on soundly
formed partnerships. Bank of Scotland has worked hard at forming
long-lasting partnerships with our customers.''
At a time when the recession is slowly drawing to an end, this close
relationship is more important than ever. Many businesses are looking to
expand, and the advice and expertise offered by business banking
managers at this stage can make all the difference.
''Our locally-based business banking managers have the authority to
make lending decisions without any reference to head office,'' said
Steedman. ''Around 90% of all lending decisions are made by local
business banking managers.''
''Developing a good relationship with customers is paramount for
business banking managers. Our experience has shown that by working
closely with businesses, soundly formed partnerships can be built. We
believe that partnerships and good working relationships are vital in
giving us a better understanding of our customers and helps us react
quickly to meet their business needs,'' he added.
A broad range of ''user-friendly'' services for customers are
available to take some of the strain of running a business. Home and
Office Banking Service (HOBS) is already well established, and offers
small businesses a flow of essential banking services and information
directly to the office.
Corporate HOBS, for the larger firm, is a more sophisticated
electronic banking service, designed to be part of a computerised
accounting system. Demonstrations of either system can be arranged
through local bank managers.
There is a range of borrowing options suited for either start-ups or
expansion. ''There is one thing that is even more important than the
great business idea,'' said Steedman. ''That's the financial structure
to sustain it. If the correct sources of funding are not in place -- and
that has to include sufficient borrowing -- then the enterprise is
immediately handicapped.''
Having the correct financial structure means more than simply
borrowing enough money; it means the right form of borrowing. Overdrafts
are ideal for certain situations. Others will be better served by a
''term loan'', designed for specific asset purchases and usually repaid
in the anticipated lifetime of the asset purchased.
Commercial hire purchase might be cheaper as payments can be tailored
to suit the income of the business. ''Commercial hire purchase
agreements are much the same as personal HP,'' says Steedman. ''You
achieve ownership on the final instalment.
''For tax purposes, the asset is treated as being owned by the hirer
from the outset, therefore allowing capital allowances on the asset,
although the interest element of the hire charge is an allowable
business expense.''
The commercial mortgage is a flexible product for buying and or
expanding property for business use. Like a domestic mortgage it is
available for up to 25 years and there is no maximum. It can be used to
fund up to 70% of the property's price or valuation, whichever is the
lower.
Bank of Scotland also participates in the Small Firms Loan Guarantee
Scheme, run with the Department of Trade and Industry. Small firms
looking to expand can borrow between #5000 and #250,000, repayable over
seven years, and 70% to 85% of the loan is guaranteed by the DTI.
''Business customers may apply for this assistance when they require
finance but traditional bank funding is not available -- say, because of
the lack of acceptable security,'' says Steedman. ''The principals must
have contributed all available personal assets, and the bank must be
satisfied with the underlying viability of the business.''
Small businesses can also receive help through the Scottish Enterprise
Small Business Loan Scheme, available to manufacturing and business
services firms based in Scotland with less than 250 employees. Interest
rates are capped at the beginning of the loan, and unlike the Loan
Guarantee Scheme, funds can be used partially to refinance existing
borrowing.
''We believe in a tailor-made financial package,'' says Steedman,
''that is affordable and a benefit to the customer. It has to have the
correct blend of support and the right shape of finance.''
Many businesses run into problems when customers do not pay bills on
time. The bank's factoring service, Kellock Ltd, assumes responsibility
for the sales ledger and debt collection. As soon as an invoice is sent
to the factors, they will provide up to three-quarters of the value,
with the rest payable when the invoice is settled in full.
''Businesses benefit from receiving cash which could otherwise be tied
up in invoices for several months,'' commented Steedman. ''And there is
the added advantage that they are provided with sales ledger management
and credit control.''

THE last duel fought in Scotland was on August 23, 1826 between George
Morgan, agent for the bank in Kirkcaldy, and David Langdale, a line
merchant and Bank of Scotland customer. The story had a happy ending,
however, 13 years later Morgan's nephew, Alexander, married David
Langdale's daughter and they went on to found Langdale, Morgan &amp; Co, the
beginnings of Kirkcaldy's linoleum industry.

ONCE upon a time it took just 30 minutes -- two spare shirts stuffed
into a rucksack, a clean pair of underpants to keep mother happy in the
event that I was knocked over by a bus . . . it was always to be a bus,
a toothbrush thrown in, a razor added, War and Peace, and a Mars bar for
the inner man. After which, if I was carrying a passport, the world was
my oyster -- the beaten earth floor of a Breton peasant dwelling, the
prune jam regularity of German youth hostels, snow in the Alps, and only
mild sun-stroke where others more ambitiously sought to see Naples and
die.
Half an hour was all it took and I was ready to take on the world -- a
slow stroll across Mull, a wild weekend night-clubbing in Berlin.
Whatever the call, wherever the action, in less than it takes to air the
world's ills on the Six o'Clock News I would be ready for the off, loins
girt and bag packed, not to be heard again until I wired ''SOS, LSD,
RSVP''. That was then.
As the decades slipped away and the rucksack gave way to matched
pigskin pieces not a lot changed. Leaving the dog with no more than a
carefree pat on the snout and the key to a neighbour's heart, pausing
only to pop the day's haul of parking tickets on the dying coals of the
sitting room fire, I could be in the jump seat of a sports car or the
departure lounge of an airport even faster than Michael Heseltine can
today deny any ambition to take over from the PM.
Alas, what has happened to such streamlined efficiency? To move at all
now seems to demand meticulous planning on a scale not seen since the
mass shipment of men and equipment across the Channel for Operation
Overlord in June, 1944. Nothing now is left to chance and it takes
hours.
Although the risk of going under the wheels of a bus has diminished
with the passing of the years -- for no reason other than that ability
to dash recklessly is now denied me -- I pack, in mother's memory, a
dozen spare pairs just in case. I also include cardies, spare reading
glasses, a note of my camera serial number, and a card offering my best
bits to medical science should the opportunity arise: a middle-aged
version, I suppose, of the underpant scenario.
A weekend in the remote fastness of Laggan, a cheapo quickie in Paris
-- it makes little difference. Stay on my native heath and the car gets
laden with cans of spare fuel sufficient for a crossing of the Gobi
desert. Tools and ropes are added, survival bags and a first-aid kit
adequate for a television hospital series stowed on board. Insurances
are taken out and loved ones made aware of the presence of a will.
Electricity cables are disconnected and gas supplies shut down, the
dairy sworn to secrecy, Neighbourhood Watch alerted, and security lights
switched to over-drive.
Over to Paris and it is passport and papers, travellers' cheques and
health insurance, guide books and dictionaries, maps, letters of
introduction to Her Brittanic Majesty's Ambassador to the Auld Alliance,
just in case, my lawyer's home 'phone number and the SAS Guide to
Survival as adapted for the urban jungle, French xenophobia, and the
supercilium of the waiting classes.
Why? Why is it that as we get older but no wiser, longer in the tooth
but no richer, we are slow to seize the passing hour and make the most
of it . . . especially when the supply of such golden moments reduces at
speed equal to Michael Howard's production of new measures to combat
crime.
Was it that, in youth, we knew little and cared even less of that now,
in maturity going on senility, we know more and care too much? Is there
a happy medium between reckless departure and super-safe arrival . . . a
middle road that leaves us with a sufficiency of spare underwear but
without the burdens associated with a Gold Card?
Certainly travel has become more complex since the days when the bold
set off to watch Byron swim the Hellesport or sit at the feet of RLS in
the Samoan Court of the Teller of Tales with no more succour than a
body-belt of sovereigns and the lastest Travellers' Guide to Pidgin.
Thanks in no small measure to the Financial Services Industry as it
likes to call itself travel has become a matter of anxiety, a hitherto
unimagined catalogue of horrors the pain of which can only be assuaged
by the laying out of money for insurance . . . the alleged balm that
will kiss it all better when your bags are rifled or pocket picked and
the aircraft in which you are travelling makes an unscheduled landing in
a swamp with benefit of neither runaway nor Air Traffic Control. Cover
against such contingencies does not come cheap.
Now, it is worth bearing in mind that none of this insurance
''investment'' as it will be called will actually save you from the
depredations of brigands, footpads, other drivers, freak storm or
tempest and thus, in the mind of the sceptic, the question arises -- why
not a body belt of sovereigns and this year's Travellers' Guide to
Pidgin? Why not?

SIR Bruce Pattullo is only the 21st governor of Bank of Scotland in
300 years, a fact which has given the bank a unique continuity.
You might expect that when asked to what he attributed the bank's
success he would lay great stress on tradition. In fact he chose to use
the word ''experience'' which implies a process of continuous learning
rather than an unthinking reverence of the past.
He listed the four main attributes, in order, as ''experience,
independence, conservatism or canniness, and innovation''. The last two
qualities appear at first glance to be contradictory but they do balance
each other.
''Our experience stems from the fact that we have been around a long
time,'' he said. ''We have acquired a reservoir of banking experience
from 'lessons learned the hard way.'
''Our independence is down to the fact that we know our own mind and
are sufficiently self-confident to make our own decisions and where
necessary stand alone against the views of others.
''Conservatism or canniness means we are cautious and risk averse. We
don't jump into things lightly and we don't overstretch ourselves.
However, we are willing to take educated risks where necessary.
''At the same time, we are innovative: we try to stay ahead of the
game and be as forward-thinking as possible. We pioneered HOBS (Home and
Office Banking Service) and TAPS (Transcontinental Payment Service), our
high-technology computer processing system.
''We introduced Central Banking Services in the early eighties, a
non-traditional delivery system, so we could enter the English market
without the expense of a branch network.''
Learning lessons the hard way is not in itself a virtue: it is only of
value if you can capitalise on what has been learned. ''Banking is a
cyclical industry therefore the same problems and difficulties recur.
''Over our 300 years we have built up valuable experience and we are
able to draw on the reserve and handle things better each time.''
Bank of Scotland has consistently been the leading provider of senior
debt for management buy-out transactions in the UK, a position it
intends to maintain.
''We will maintain and increase the number of specialised and highly
skilled people working for us and extend our market coverage to include
a wider range of transactions, particularly internationally.''
Business banking at all levels is based on close relationships.
Maintaining those relationships requires that customers can get
decisions quickly and locally, from people who know them and their
business.
''Our relationship banking initiative, 'Partners in Business', means
we work together with our customers to form a partnership,'' said Sir
Bruce.
''We have specially trained local managers who can make lending
decisions locally. And of course we will continue to provide a
high-quality, value-for-money service to our business customers.''
Professionalism at all staff levels is a point of pride in the bank
and it intends to keep a lead in this, using the best of training both
in-house and from specialist providers.
''We invest in our staff as we recognise that it is the quality of
service which we provide which sets us apart from our competitors. We
introduced the Training Hour, a dedicated hour per week for staff
training.
''The bank's branch network has an Investors in People award. And we
have a good career progression structure within the bank which provides
staff with variety and the opportunity to gain valuable experience in a
broad range of areas and specialist departments.''
At the same time the branches, which have been called the bank's
'heart and lungs,' will continue to play a major part. ''The branch
network is very important to Bank of Scotland. Obviously we will
continue to look out for ways of enhancing our service to customers
through alternative delivery mechanisms but not at the expense of the
network.''
The approach to the tercentenary reflects the bank's overall
philosophy. Rather than a simple celebration which will leave no lasting
benefit, the theme adopted has been one of 'putting something back
whence it came'.
''It is a recognised landmark in our history,'' said Sir Bruce. ''It
gives us the platform to reflect on what has been achieved and provides
an opportunity to recognise and say 'thank you' to those who have
supported us over 300 years.''
#3m has been pledged to sponsorships and events this year in addition
to the banks' normal programme of sponsorships and donations. Support
covers sports, the arts, education, communities and the environment.
Applications were assessed centrally but each region was allocated an
amount so they could sponsor local events. This also enabled the staff
to get involved.
''We wished to acknowledge publicly that we could not have flourished
without the support of our customers, shareholders and the communities
within which we operate,'' said Sir Bruce. ''This year is an opportunity
to reflect and give something back to those who have helped and will,
hopefully, continue to support us.
''For staff, we should like the tercentenary to be remembered as a
milestone, an achievement of which they can be proud.
''For customers, we would like to think they will remember the
tercentenary as a time when the bank publicly 'put something back' into
the community by supporting projects and events and making things happen
which might not normally happen.''
Milestones are an opportunity to look forward as well as back. So what
are the plans for the future?
''We will continue to provide first-class service and tailor our
products and services to the needs of the customer,'' he said. ''We will
endeavour to keep one step ahead and anticipate what our customers need.
''Customer service is all-important.''
We don't jump into things lightly and we don't overstretch ourselves
It is the quality of service that we provide which sets us apart from
our competitors

I WRITE after reading the article, Killing pain the drug-free way
(July 13).
As a junior anaesthetist I was involved with the development of the
first pain clinic in Glasgow at the Victoria Infirmary and have been
working in pain clinics since then. These clinics are available at most
hospitals (teaching and district general) and in the West of Scotland
alone I can think of at least eight well-established clinics. The writer
suggests there are only ''about a dozen in Scotland''!
I accept that work is hampered by lack of clinic time but it is
amazing how much a keen specialist and nurse can pack into the few hours
allocated to pain.
The range of treatments available includes nerve blocks, medication,
acupuncture, TENS, hypnotherapy, physiotherapy, aromatherapy, and a
great deal of psychological help and counselling. I am certain that pain
clinics and homeopathic hospitals pioneered the use of alternative
medicine in the field of chronic pain.
The Pain Association has recently moved in to my area, Inverclyde, and
I have welcomed it and have been impressed by the enthusiasm of those
involved. I have advised several of my patients to contact the group and
hope that they benefit from the camaraderie and many services which are
available.
I would stress that everyone with severe unrelenting pain must be seen
by a qualified medical practitioner before contacting the association in
case their pain is remediable by conventional medicine.
Likewise it is advisable for patients wishing to try TENS to borrow a
machine which should be tried for some weeks under the instruction of a
qualified doctor, nurse, or physiotherapist. If it is found to be
helpful then and only then should purchase be considered.
These TENS machines can make such a difference to a patient's quality
of life but they are not available on prescription. Every pain clinic
has a limited supply to lend but funding is not available to supply
patients with their own machine.
The aim of all pain clinics is to help the patient manage their pain
better and to improve their quality of life. Another avenue of
assistance is most welcome. Let us all work in unison to help these
patients.

THE Bank of England was yesterday making no comment on weekend reports
that a senior Bank of England man in charge of supervising investment
banks has resigned over the collapse of Barings, writes CHRIS STONE.
The Bank report into the #860m Barings debacle is expected to be
presented to Parliament by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke tomorrow.
Chris Thompson, a bank supervision manager, is said to have quit after
seeing advance details which are thought to contain criticism over
procedure. The Bank did not deny Mr Thompson's departure but a
spokesman, John Footman, said: ''We are not saying anything today. We
will leave all comment on Barings until the report comes out.''
The Chancellor is expected to unveil a report outlining ''massive
failure of internal controls'' leading up to Barings' collapse amid huge
losses run up by rogue trader Nick Leeson.
The report has been drawn up by the Bank of England board of
supervision. It is expected to contain evidence that Barings' senior
directors had evidence of huge derivatives trading losses, but failed to
act before the collapse in February.
The Bank of England has said the report will first take the form of a
detailed narrative on events at Barings. There will also be a second
section on the lessons to be learned.
The Chancellor has always said he will make a full report to
Parliament before the summer recess on Wednesday, ''subject to certain
legal situations''. It is believed that tomorrow afternoon has been set
aside for the Chancellor to present the report to MPs.
City bank analysts say the inquiry by judges into the collapse of BCCI
in 1991 provides the nearest precedent, though BCCI ''was a
long-standing issue'' and Barings in contrast ''blew up quickly''.
The report is expected to criticise bank staff for failing to notice
weaknesses in Barings' controls propriety trading, in particular Mr
Leeson's Tokyo futures dealings.
Publication of the findings comes amid a move by Nick Leeson to try to
plead guilty in British courts and so avoid extradition back to
Singapore. His lawyers say he has a ''high-risk strategy'' of saying he
has a case to answer.
Mr Leeson is facing extradition proceedings to Singapore on 12
charges, several relating to the allegation that he forged a fax early
this year to cover up a #50m discrepancy in accounts that had arisen
from his hidden derivatives trading.

SCOTLAND is experiencing the most rapid rise in business confidence,
according to the latest survey from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the leading
supplier for business information.
The survey, the first national inquiry into business optimism to be
taken after the result of the Conservative leadership election, also
indicates that economic growth is slowing and inflationary pressures are
under control which will lend support to the Chancellor's decision to
leave interest rates well alone.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet says there has been an all-round increase in business
confidence in Scotland, which has brought it back into line with other
parts of the country.
Sales optimism has increased in the same measure as it has declined
elsewhere. Profits optimism has held steady and there are optimistic
expectations for increased orders. As opposed to the rest of Britain,
more Scottish firms expect to increase staff.
Overall, British business is forecasting a period of slow and steady
export-led growth, fuelled by sterling's marked depreciation. ''More
encouragingly, the brakes applied by higher taxes and interest rate
increases are now bringing the economy to a soft landing, heralding a
period of steady and low-inflationary growth by UK standards,'' says Dun
&amp; Bradstreet's senior analyst Philip Mellor.
The survey shows a marked decline in inflationary expectations across
all industrial sectors, confirming the trend revealed in the last
survey, which recorded the first drop for two years in the number of
firms expecting to lift their prices.
The proportion of firms expecting to increase prices over the next
quarter dropped significantly from nearly 70% in the second quarter to
about 65% in the third.
The most confident industrial sector is consumer durable
manufacturing. In particular, they still demonstrate increasing
employment expectations at a time when other sectors appear to be
slowing down. The least confident sector across most fronts is the
construction industry, where only 61.5% of businesses expect to
strengthen sales in the next quarter compared to a national average of
76%.
Overall expectations of new orders remain relatively stable, apart
from the construction sector where only 52.5% of firms now expect an
increase, compared to 61% in the previous survey.
Profit expectations remain steady with the aggregate index falling
just two points. Declining optimism among non-durable manufacturers and
those in construction was offset by strong confidence amid durable
manufacturers.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's survey drew responses from over 1700 managing
directors in all regions and sectors of British business.

THE first estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product growth,
together with retail sales figures for June, will this week provide an
important handle on the temperature of the UK economy.
GDP has been the measure favoured by the Bank of England in recent
months, with Chancellor Kenneth Clarke having tended to focus on retail
sales.
With the Central Statistical Office compiling the GDP figure from data
which is largely not already in the public domain, it is a notoriously
difficult one to forecast.
Industrial production has been relatively flat but a lack of
information about the service sector means that second-quarter GDP
growth could come in anywhere between zero and 1%.
However, retail sales data for June, due on Wednesday, should provide
some clues about the services side.
Adam Cole, UK economist at London-based stockbroker James Capel,
forecasts that June retail sales will be 0.4% higher than a month
earlier, with a rise in the annual rate of growth from 1.1% to 1.4%.
He expects figures released on Friday to reveal second-quarter GDP
growth of 0.5%, for an annual rate of 2.8%, up from 2.7%.
Labour market statistics to be published on Wednesday are expected to
reveal a drop of about 20,000 in unemployment during June. Annual
average earnings growth is expected to have risen from 3.5% to 3.75%
during May.

IT'S a quiet week for company news with market attention likely to
focus instead on a plethora of economic data which will help provide a
lead as to how strong the economic recovery is.
Although there is a dearth of FTSE company result announcements an
indication of consumer demand will come from trading updates at various
annual general meetings such as Vodafone on Wednesday, Thorn EMI, owner
of Dillons and HMV, and Marks &amp; Spencer on Friday.
An ambitious store opening programme is likely to hold back profit
growth at HMV. Most clothing retailers are thought to have suffered from
the variable weather in the first half of the year. M&amp;S is the UK's
market leader in clothing with around 15% market share.
In terms of company announcements, drinks distributor Matthew Clark is
expected to announce a loss of around #14m on Tuesday. This compares
with profits of #10.3m last time.
However, underlying profits should be about #21.4m after a #35m
exceptional charge for Gaymers, which takes Matthew Clark into the
growing cider market.
Interest will be high in Medeva reporting its interims on Wednesday.
Last year was a successful year for the company on several fronts --
sales, acquisitions and licence agreements. The group expects its
half-yearly profits to increase by 30% with earnings per share improving
by 25%.
Rival pharmaceutical group Fisons recently announced that it had
broken off merger talks with Medeva. Medeva is thought to have held out
for 300p a share whereas Fisons was offering a maximum of 250p.
Wednesday also sees publication of a trading statement from David S
Smith, the paper, packaging and office supplies group, which reports its
full-year results. Margins should benefit from the steep rise in paper
prices arising from capacity shortages. Annual profits are expected to
more than double to around #90m compared with #42.2m previously.
Dalepak, a manufacturer of chilled and frozen food, is expected on
Wednesday to report profits of #700,000, up from #500,000, helped by the
small Ross acquisition. Broker BZW expects the dividend to double to 3p.

<ARTICLETYPE>CORRESPONDENCE</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>977354914</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
HAVING read your comment on July 15, I can't help thinking it's time
to redress the balance a little. Yours has not been the first paper to
extol the virtues, whilst casting a veil over the drawbacks, of the new
Skye bridge.
While I am sure that there are some people who welcome the completion
of the bridge, I have never met any of them. The bridge is not needed
economically, aesthetically, or socially, and it is extremely ugly.
As regards your belief that it will benefit the local economy, in
reality this seems unlikely. Tourism is one of the major likely
casualties; while visitors may be happy to pay #5.20 to make the
crossing by boat as a new and unique experience, it is hardly likely
that they will wish to pay more to cross a bridge -- something they can
do anywhere anytime and, what's more, for free.
Those who do cross will be less likely to stay, opting for a quick
drive over, then back off to continue their journey elsewhere.
It is the cost to the commercial traffic, though, that will cause the
real nightmares. The less flexible administration and higher costs, far
from stimulating the local economy, will further increase the prices in
Portree High Street and all over the island. Shops, hotels, and small
businesses all over the island will have trouble in avoiding passing on
the cost to the customer.
It also should be remembered that when winter comes the two remaining
crossings from the mainland to Skye will cease to carry cars and the
bridge will have a monopoly. We islanders will be left with a
pay-or-stay situation with no alternatives to choose from.
Sir Iain Noble's comment on a ferry in competition extending the
longevity of tolls is extremely spurious as few truly believe that the
tolls will cease in our lifetime, if ever.
I can only wish the Skye Boat Company every success and I can promise
that a great many people will opt to cross via the independent ferry
rather than the bridge, irrespective of cost.
A Government which thrives on the ethos of competition and choice can
hardly balk if we exercise our rights to not use the bridge.
Recently all islanders received a questionnaire from the Scottish
Office on the impact of the bridge. This PR exercise is several years
too late. If we weren't listened to before the bridge was built, why
should we believe we will be heeded now?
Furthermore, who is paying for this three-year consultation exercise?
The islanders through the tolls, or the Government? If the Government
can waste money on pointless paper chasing, why not on easing the burden
to the inhabitants of Skye?
The only sensible course to take is to remove the tolls and truly turn
this bridge to an advantage to the island. This is something that we
shall continue to fight for -- this year, next year and for however long
it takes to make the Government see sense. Neither the Labour Party nor
the LibDems have promised to scrap the tolls.
What is needed is a fresh start, with a new way ahead. Until we see
road equivalent tariffs and toll-free bridges, the Highlands and Islands
will continue to suffer from higher prices and to be held to ransom by
the unscrupulous few who seek to take advantage of the situation.
This is one more of the many good reasons to vote for an independent
Scottish government that can provide the environment for real change,
and the direct access to Europe and the funding needed to inject lasting
hope for the future into the Highland economy, but most of all the
confidence to see that we can stand on our own two feet and do a better
job than the current administration does.

SMITH New Court, the last of the major independent stockbrokers,
should this week or next decide which, if any, of the potential bid
contenders it favours after announcing last Wednesday that it was in
talks with a small number of suitors, though merchant bank N M
Rothschild with its 26% stake in Smith will of course have a crucial
influence in the final outcome.
US securities house Merrill Lynch, ''the thundering herd'', and the
German Commerzbank remain the front runners and as original contenders
have a head start over other overseas parties which have now expressed
some interest. These are believed to include French group Paribas, two
German banks, Westdeutsche Landesbank and Bayerische Vereinsbank, and
the US securities house Bear Sterns.
Commerzbank is understood to have been the first on the scene, in
talks with Smith New Court since late March early April. But, more
recently, Merrill Lynch has been wooing Smith's chairman, Michael Marks,
and in the eyes of some City observers is favourite to receive Smith New
Court's backing.
That said, the situation could change, and Rothschild, which has
avoided making any comment on the discussions, could decide it favours
proposals from one of the outsiders.
The merchant bank, headed by chairman Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, is
presumably not unhappy about selling its stake or it would presumably
have tried to sabotage the talks at the start, but it would certainly
want to study the proposals from all of the potential candidates, not
just one or two possibly favoured by Smith New Court's chairman. It
could even conclude that it would prefer to hold on to Smith New Court's
highly-regarded market-making team itself.
Smith New Court has said that there is no need for it to accept any
deal. But if it was to withdraw now, having gone this far, it would
certainly be a blow to its credibility and Rothschild with a useful
profit now in its sights -- mooted price of around 550p a share against
Friday's close of 516p is considered generous -- and piqued by not
apparently being brought into discussions from the start, is likely to
accept the highest bidder if it does not decide to stay in the game in
its own right.
Smith New Court's annual general meeting is being held this Thursday,
and clearly it would be helpful to shareholders if something concrete
was unveiled prior to that. However, with other with fresh potential
bidders apparently entering the frame, it may take a little longer to
make a recommendation.

THE financial sector remains one of the UK's most important overseas
earners in spite of several high-profile problems, the most recent being
the collapse of Barings merchant bank, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Net overseas earnings of the UK financial sector surged by almost a
third to #20.4bn last year.
The rise from #15.5bn in 1993 reflected a sharp increase in banks' net
earnings. These more than doubled from #3100m to #8400m.
Reasons for the improvement included an increase in the volume of the
banks' overseas lending and borrowing and higher income from interest
rate swaps.
Results from other financial sectors were mixed. The collapse of
international bond markets in 1994 caused a sharp drop in securities
dealers' profits. However, lower profitability reduced securities
dealers' profits accruing to overseas parents and affiliates. Insurance
companies claims and expenses paid out during 1994 exceeded premiums
received.
The increase in financial earnings accounted for just over half the
improvement in the UK's current account in 1994. Net earnings from the
supply of services, such as the Lloyd's insurance market and fund
management, amounted to #10.4bn, up from #9500m in 1993, and accounted
for just over half the total. The remaining #9700m was due to earnings
from overseas investments.
Commenting on the figures, Alison Wright, director-general of British
Invisibles, said the financial sector had once again ''delivered a
sparkling performance reinforcing its position as the UK's largest net
contributor to the current account''.

The winner of Britain's top portrait prize, Ishbel Myerscough, is no
flattering society painter, and having seen her abrasive self-portraits,
Clare Henry found it quite a shock to meet a good-looking Glasgow girl
IT'S no surprise to me that Ishbel Myerscough has just won Britain's
top portrait prize: #10,000 from London's National Portrait Gallery BP
Award. Even as a student she was always memorable. I tried to buy the
first picture of hers I ever saw, for the BBC Collection. It was part of
the 1990 Whyte and Mackay Burrell portrait exhibition and the figure's
penetrating gaze and meticulous intensity caught my eye immediately. But
even then she knew her worth. She quoted me what was a high price for a
work by an unknown third-year Glasgow School of Art student and sadly
the BBC budget did not stretch to it. Their loss!
Her winning painting, Krishenda, is a knockout: a big black Jessye
Normanesque nude reclining on a chocolate brown and white goat skin rug.
''There's just one word for it. Majestic,'' declared painter John
Bellany, one of the judges. ''It's a fantastic pose. What I liked was
it's no-holds-barred quality. And it has presence.''
Professor Norbert Lynton, who chairs the jury of nine, said: ''There
was no fight over the decision. She may not look like your favourite
girlfriend, but the portrait has a forthright boldness which we all
favoured, as well as being done rather well.''
Myerscough is the third Glasgow girl to win this important
competition. Rosemary Beaton won in 1984 and Alison Watt, 1986, went on
to paint the Queen Mother. Scots generally do well, with a record 11
(including Mark Gilbert, Des Gorman and Abigail Mclellan) among this
year's 70 pictures selected as ''exceptional among 786 submissions of a
very high standard''.
The show runs in Trafalgar Square till October 15 then, for the first
time in 15 years, travels, happily for us, to Aberdeen Art Gallery from
October 28 -- November 25. ''The NPG and BP are delighted with this
development, planned to continue in future years,'' says the director.
Now 26, Myerscough graduated from Glasgow -- which she loved -- in
1991 and spent two years working in a WASPS studio in King Street before
doing a postgraduate degree at London's Slade -- which she hated. ''At
Glasgow you were encouraged to go your own way, and Sandy Guy was one
really helpful tutor. The Slade is very unfriendly and very rigid. It's
all rulers and set squares. You're supposed to follow their 'grand
master', Euan Uglow, exactly. The tutors were unsympathetic to
everything I did. Someone even said I should 'sacrifice myself to the
tradition of the Slade'.''
For five years she entered the BP competition regularly, twice being
commended (with a #500 prize) in 1991 and 1993 and in 1992 getting the
#4000 second prize. Though the NPG encourages artists to re-enter, last
year she didn't bother. ''It gets embarrassing,'' she laughs. Her entry
this year was entirely last minute. ''You haven't a cat in hell's chance
with that picture,'' she was warned by one art expert.
Her sitter was a Glasgow Art School model, who quit before she had a
chance to paint her. ''So I got her to come to pose for me in King
Street. She was really brilliant. I worked in intense four-hour sessions
and it took four weeks. She's American and wanted to be a midwife. I
think she liked her portrait, but we lost touch. It must be strange
suddenly to see yourself on the posters. She has perfect silky skin,
wonderful to paint. I was determined to paint her on goat skin or
cowhide but couldn't find any. In the end I got desperate and painted
her on a white sheet. A year later I eventually found the skins via a
London film props hire company.''
Myerscough likes to set up her own poses. ''At the Slade they try to
do it by committee! Hopeless! In the end no-one else was interested so a
friend and I chose the models from a book in the office. We had a
Japanese model with a blue fish tattoo, an anorexic ex-prostitute, and
an angular girl.''
Along with the #10,000 cash comes a #2000 commission to paint a
well-known sitter for the National Portrait Gallery collection. Beaton
painted Robin Day. Watt was told to paint the Queen Mum, which created
controversy as she posed her without a hat. Myerscough has the added
problem of being given a choice. ''The thing is I don't fancy anyone on
the list. I want it to be someone I'm really keen to paint.''
Myerscough is, however, no flattering society painter. Indeed, having
seen her tough, abrasive self-portraits, it's a shock to meet a
beautiful, gentle girl. When I observed that Ishbel is very hard on
people, especially herself, even her mother agrees. ''She can make
herself look like an old witch. We laugh about her 'horrid' faces!''
Because of this her sitters are predominantly friends or models,
although Jean Muir asked for a drawing and commissions include Graham
Gooch for Lord's Cricket Ground, masters at King's School, Canterbury,
Antonia Fraser's son, and the wife of the chairman of the NatWest Bank.
Sometimes she paints her boyfriends or Chantal Joffre, a contemporary
from Glasgow who went on to the Royal College. ''I just paint people the
way I see them. I do like blemishes, freckles and vaccination marks. I
don't make them up, I'm just more aware of them.''
Her rather severe portrait of Indian painter friend Shelly was
commended by the judges in 1993 but Shelly's parents reaction was, ''Put
it away or you'll never get a husband.''
She comes from an artistic family. Her father is a musician, one
sister went to the Royal College and runs her own graphic design
company, and her mother studied embroidery and woven textiles at Glasgow
at the same time as Alison Watt's father. Her mum taught at Grays Art
School in Aberdeen before her marriage and exhibits regularly.
''When the kids were at school I used to work on my commissions in the
kitchen,'' Mrs Myerscough told me. ''And I also drew and painted Ishbel
a lot. She's never painted me. I hate sitting for people! But since she
was a little girl she's posed for me. There are several portraits of her
around the world. With her black hair and big eyes, she was always very
saleable! We joke about the sittings. She paints slowly, takes ages and
ages, and needs lots of time for her portraits -- but if I draw her she
wants it done in five minutes!''
Sandy Moffat, head of painting at Glasgow, remembers Myerscough as a
''very gifted girl'' who overcame severe myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).
''She was always a good student despite the ME. When she was ill I would
come into the studio and find her curled up in a little ball exhausted
and fast asleep. Then she'd come to, and start again. It was quite a
feat to succeed as she did. Her work then, and her ability to look at
things and make sense of it, sometimes reminded me of the young Lucien
Freud. It's a talent not to be sneezed at by conceptualists who merely
select a bag of salt and pair of old boots and call it installation.''
What next? Of course there's the NPG commission -- a star of the
ethnic community maybe? Then a trip to America, part of a travel
scholarship she won last year, and back to help judge next year's NPG BP
Award.
Keep an eye on Ishbel Myerscough. Like several other young women
painters from Glasgow -- Jenny Saville, Alison Watt, Helen Flockhart --
she's here to stay.

MARK FISHER finds mime caught in a vicious circle of mediocrity -- but
efforts are being made to set it free
SCOTLAND'S Mime Forum found itself with a problem. It's a young
organisation, made up of a disparate band of performers linked by an
interest in what can loosely be defined as physical theatre.
The task that the organisation first set itself was to raise the
profile of the work of its members, to shake off the outdated images
that even now stick to the word ''mime'', and to suggest to people that
acting need not only be about big speeches delivered from the neck up.
To this end it organised a couple of showcase events, including a
week-long display of performances and works-in-progress intended to show
off the diversity and skills of its members. It also invited performers
from abroad, notably the highly influential director and theoretician
Eugenio Barba and his wife Julia Varley who came to Edinburgh from
Denmark to appear last year.
And herein lay the problem. Scottish physical theatre performers
simply don't cut it when ranked alongside the best international
practitioners. And no wonder. The conditions for them to create
substantial new pieces -- pieces of depth, character, and innovation --
are more or less non-existent in Scotland.
To an extent it comes down to funding. You can't knock up an
acceptable physical theatre piece in the standard three weeks that the
average play gets to rehearse. If you're working without a script (or if
you're creating the script at the same time as the movement), you need
time to develop and shape your ideas -- and that's time few people are
prepared to pay for.
But it also comes down to a state of mind. The Mime Forum recently
conducted a survey of its members to discover why it was so few of them
were working -- or at least why, if they were working, it was as regular
actors with conventional companies and not on their own projects.
It seemed that everyone was keen to run away and work with the
established physical theatre companies like Theatre de Complicite, but
few identified any real opportunities to ply their trade in Scotland.
It's a circular trap: if the standard of the work on display is mediocre
then few will be inspired to produce anything better than mediocre . . .
and so it goes on.
So the Mime Forum resolved to change tack. If the conditions didn't
exist in which its members could work, then it would set itself the task
of creating those conditions. So rather than staging another
performance-based event like last year's More Action, it decided to set
up its own ''performance laboratory'', a small-scale workshop that would
address some of the issues that currently affect practitioners.
All this week, four physically trained actors, two writers, and the
director Pete Brooks (whose excellent L'Ascensore played in Mayfest two
years ago) have been working together on finding ways that words and
movement can be productively created at one and the same time.
It's a timely study. For all the claims that either side of the
equation might make, I still find it as rare to come across a physical
theatre piece that has a halfway decent script, as I do a well-made play
with actors who show more than a passing sense of bodily awareness. The
task of integrating the two approaches is clearly more difficult than
you might expect and it will be illuminating to see what the actors and
writers have to say (and do) for themselves when they have a public
presentation tomorrow at Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre at 7.30pm.
On Saturday there was a closed class for professional writers which
was led by Geraldine Pilgrim, whose work as a designer has been seen at
the Traverse in House Among the Stars, Sky Woman Falling, and Away, but
who was there in her capacity as a director interested in both physical
theatre and new writing. Yesterday afternoon, she and Brooks hosted an
open discussion that posed the question ''Are words enough?''
''We thought of marrying the two things, words and movement, and
throwing a more intense light on the collaborative field,'' says Mime
Forum's Alan Caig.
''Rather than saying 'mime and physical theatre is this, and isn't it
great?', it's more like saying, 'mime and physical theatre have
capacities that can dovetail with other work'. I realised that new
writing and physical theatre are the two major growth areas in
contemporary theatre, so it seems to make an awful lot of sense to join
them up.''

THE cynicism of the UN in Bosnia has reached previously unimaginable
depths. I could not believe what I heard when a UN spokesman on the
BBC's one o'clock news (July 13) said of the Srebrenica refugees fleeing
from the onslaught of the Serbian war criminals: ''They should not have
left without experiencing the Serbs' hospitality''.
Is this what the Allies said to the Jews during the last World War as
they followed the footsteps of their friends and relatives to the death
camps?
I took a little heart, however, from a US Congressman on Newsnight
(July 12) who said his party would be pressing immediately to
unilaterally lift the inhumane embargo against the Bosnian Government
which has prevented it from defending its people for over two years.
I would suggest that UN forces on the ground have also hindered at
every turn the official Muslim-led Government's efforts to defend the
majority population.
When asked if he thought America would be prepared to risk US forces
to help withdraw UN troops from the area, the Congressman replied: ''Yes
-- but under the command of NATO, not the ineffective UN. And if the
Serbs continued to attack UN safe havens, or militarily obstructed the
withdrawal of UN forces, the war would be taken directly to Belgrade.''
If threats on these lines had been made two-and-a-half years ago, the
rape, pillaging, and mass murder would have been minimised, with the
terrorist leaders imprisoned and consigned to provincial history.
Instead, we have heard one excuse change to another from the likes of
John Major, Malcolm Rifkind, Douglas Hurd, Lord Owen, Lord Carrington,
etc, as the goalposts changed but as the geopolitical and racist aims of
the financial elite to create a Greater Serbia remained resolute,
apparently according to plan, a plan that will leave no Muslim-led
Government in place anywhere in the Occident.
I believe that this elite is infinitely more evil, dangerous, and
powerful even than the physical aggressors in the wretched Balkans
region.

IN four key areas the Government is making myopic claims, namely on
taxation, law and order, unemployment, and Europe.
It claims to be the party of low taxation yet taxation in every area
has never been higher.
Law and order is a joke. There has never been a greater need for an
urgent and drastic judicial review to reverse the damage done by the
so-called ''do-gooders'', which has resulted in a total collapse of law
and order and the ability and indeed right of ordinary citizens to go
about their business in safety.
As for unemployment, you only have to ask the many long-term
unemployed who have had their lives devastated by an inability to get
gainful employment, aggravated by Government failure to establish a
level playing field against competitors to ensure a fairer trading
environment.
Promoting ''fair'' trading among the nations of Europe, interchange of
technical or medical research, joint efforts against crime and drugs,
concern for animal cruelty, etc, are all sound goals to strive for.
Getting into bed with them with a common currency is a very different
ball game, one which would ultimately be dominated by Germany.
The Tories are promoting English nationalism to the hilt and
emphasising the dangers posed by the growing dominance of Europe, yet
are opposed to Scottish nationalism which seeks to reverse the dominance
of England over Scottish aspirations.
If the ancient nation of Scotland is to be part of the growing and
evolving Europe we must be able to take decisions effecting the
aspirations of our own people.

I SEE that Allan Macartney advocates a ''seat at the top table'' of
the Council of Ministers in an independent Scotland.
I'm afraid that in the event of an SNP-led Government in Scotland, if
their attendance at the top table was a good as their attendance in the
European Parliament, Scotland would be entirely unrepresented.
Neither Mr Macartney nor Mrs Ewing was present for the vote on the
crucial Coates report on employment on July 13 even although one of them
was present in the building.

As this year's Edinburgh Festive and Fringe lay out their stalls, some
of the offerings imbue Sara Villiers
with an uncomfortable feeling of deja vu
THE jury is still out on the Festival Cocktail designed by Karen
Koren, director of the Guilded Balloon. The bizarre mix of cranberry
juice, champagne and Invergordon whisky certainly looked good -- a
summery, pretty pink -- but proved too heady a tipple for the
early-morning press conference which launched the programme for the
Assembly Rooms, Pleasance and the Gilded Balloon.
As for the Fringe cocktail contained in the pages of the joint
programme -- an eclectic mix of comedy, theatre and cabaret -- well the
jury's still out on that one too.
We'll have to wait until we taste it before delivering a verdict,
although a lot of it has certainly been sampled before. This is the
third year the so-called ''super-venues'' have joined forces to market
themselves and their programme reflects a trend of the Fringe in
general, with a significant chunk composed of shows from last year. The
words ''cult'' and ''festival favourite'' are fast becoming PR speak for
''yes, you've seen it all before''.
So, it's bravo for Borderline Theatre, one of the few Scottish theatre
companies which is actually presenting a new production in Edinburgh,
hoping to follow up the success of The Odd Couple last year with Dario
Fo's Trumpets and Raspberries at the Assembly Rooms this year.
The Assembly Rooms also hosts Trainspotting, with the version adapted
and directed by Harry Gibson seen at the Citizens' Theatre earlier this
year. The press release points out that this is the first time the
Citizens' company has toured in 10 years although in fact this
production is produced by Gibson and not the Citz' and will be totally
recast. Gibson is also rumoured to be adapting Irvine Welsh's latest
novel Marabou Stork Nightmares for a production in '96.
Describing the Assembly Rooms' line-up, Bill Burdett-Coutts' speech
was punctuated with the phrases ''welcome back'' and ''return visit''
and the calibre of such return visits -- eg, Denise Stoklos's Mary
Stuart -- does not mask the fact that there is a distinct lack of new
shows, and new faces.
Perrier award-winners Lano and Woodley, and comic raconteur Sir
Bernard Chumley, might be ''making their first appearance at Stella
Artois Assembly'' but they're not new to the Fringe, while the Modern
Problems in Science comedy team from the States made its splash in
Edinburgh earlier this year at the International Science Festival.
However, the Assembly Rooms, Pleasance and the Gilded Balloon have
confirmed their reputations and made a commercial success out of
showcasing proven Fringe hits so it's hardly surprising that the
programme looks somewhat predictable; a winning example of giving the
public what they want.
The end result is certainly the kind of robust line-up -- and there is
still a sprinkling of the unexpected, such as James Poulter and Graham
Duff's The A to Z of Drugs -- to tempt the more audacious audience.
Christopher Richardson compared the Festival experience to the
sensation of Death by Chocolate. The icing on his cake at the Pleasance
includes some new shows which has the bankable aspect of featuring TV
celebs; Richard O'Brien playing an Evangelistic demon in Disgracefully
Yours, Jack ''Wycliffe'' Shepherd in the jazz play Chasing the Moment
and Annabel Giles searching for romance in her one-woman play Looking
for Mr Giles.
In its 10th anniversary year, the Gilded Balloon is hosting more shows
than before, featuring music, dance and theatre alongside its
traditional stand-up comedy. Sean Hughes, Phil Kay and Alan Davies will
be performing at special Gilded Balloon nights at the Queen's Hall but
the venue offers scope to unknowns as well as big names with its
established So You Think You're Funny? competition.
Speaking at the press conference Koren mentioned that the Gilded
Balloon had recently formed a limited company with charitable status,
and was applying for grants ''for accommodations''.
She confirmed later that this was a move to pursue lottery money.
There is a distinction between Gilded Balloon productions, Koren's
company which manages Phil Kay and also mounts the Gilded Balloon comedy
circuit touring Scotland this year, and Gilded Balloon Limited.
The latter has received #3000 from both the Lottery Fund and Leel
(Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd) to mount a feasibility study into
turning the Gilded Balloon venue, currently leased from the Edinburgh
University Settlement and the 369 Gallery during the Festival, into an
all-year round art centre, hosting exhibitions, a comedy club, and
touring theatre productions. A grant application will be submitted to
the Lottery Fund next month.
''We hope to achieve something similar to what Andy Arnold has done
with the Arches but without its club element,'' says Koren, who
anticipates it will take two or three years to complete. She demurred
over revealing the sums applied for, but admitted: ''It's a lot . . .
but not as much as Churchill's papers.''

YOUR correspondents Derek Young and Norry Wilson (July 13) missed the
main thrust of John Macleod's article (July 11).
Highland Health Board is funding the setting-up and running of a Brook
Advisory Clinic in Inverness without prior consultation with local
health councils.
The health board has operated a ''drop-in'' clinic for contraceptive
advice in Inverness for a number of years. This clinic has shown a
marked success, reflected in the latest figures for pregnancy and
abortion rates.
The Brook Advisory Clinic, on the other hand, has a very poor record
in Scotland based on the figures for Lothian.
Itinerant workers in the tourist industry who fall pregnant and either
have an abortion or go full term are included in the Highland figures.
As a Highland resident and taxpayer I question Dr Stone's
''non-judgmental'' decision. Why is the health board funding the
setting-up and running of a totally unnecessary Brook clinic and at the
same time refusing funding to Lifeline and the Inverness Crisis
Pregnancy Centre? Is this an example of a ''non-judgmental'' objective
decision?
Condom machines in schools, colleges, youth centres, and pubs are not
the solution. Amost three-quarters of pupils in secondary schools are
under the age of consent.
Teenage alcohol consumption is a problem. It is a well-known fact that
alcohol reduces a person's inhibitions and teenagers who have been
drinking and indulge in sexual activity are more likely to ignore the
warnings about unprotected sex.
Instead of spending money on a Brook Clinic based in Inverness the
health board should be increasing the spending on education about sex,
alcohol, and drugs in schools and colleges in both urban and rural
areas.
One can only hope that the regional councillors on the education
committee have a greater understanding of the needs of Highland pupils
and treat the suggestion of condom machines in Highland schools with the
contempt it deserves.

A SPIN-off from 7:84's 1994 project, Glasgow Generations, this
collaboration between the company and the group of Page (Pensioners
Action Group East) proves to be an impressive dramatic development on
their previous work.
Utilising a similar device of reflections on the present invoked by
memories of the past, this show is informed by a more abstract, and
effective, style, deftly directed by John Heraghty. The group share both
their memories and their contemporary concerns -- from VAT on fuel to
hospital closures -- in an informal atmosphere, with some banter between
the cast and the audience and occasional spirited off-stage discussion
among the group.
While the piece effectively puts across their message of the
campaigning muscle of Page, the serious aspects were continually levened
by some spicy humour. Jean Stewart enacts a typical day in her busy
life, stopping to assure her daughter that a troublesome trip had been
''nae bother'', while Bessie MacDonald delivers the acidic aside: ''I'm
here to get used.'' The audience cracked up with recognition and guilt.
Jimmy Hanlon gives a dry commentary as the nosey-parker narrator,
Clarence, and the rest of the cast -- Stewart, MacDonald, Sarah
Gallagher, Pat Woods, Sarah Hart, and Jimmy Fairweather (the latter
rivalling Hanlon's comic crown with some fine character performances) --
enact a series of double-edged scenes which put smiles on our faces but
also gave us pause for thought about the way society views the elderly.

IT WAS a happy coincidence that in the issue of July 8 one letter
should follow another on the Helensburgh shoreline and the dumping of
refuse on the Cove/Kilgreggan shore. Two different problems.
On one journey, Charles Lindsay of Stewarton observed five different
people crossing the road to dump garden refuse. In our monthly Peninsula
Magazine, the editor, John Tidswell, has done everything except being
downright rude in his endeavours to put a stop to this practice but to
no avail.
The people who do this have no shame. They have no regard for the harm
that they do or for the disgusting mess that they make.
What they do have is the financial means to purchase refuse bags and
to make the phone call which within a few days would ensure uplift by
the local authority.
Helensburgh foreshore is and always has been a problem. It always will
be. To compare it with the shoreline of South-west England was hardly
fair.
Down there, the sea current sweeps across sand or shingle. Refuse does
not land; it is swept away as fast as it may be swept in. And there are
types of seaweed which stick to the mud of Helensburgh's shore not seen
down south.
Had Mary Wilson of Umberleigh, North Devon, been in Helensburgh only
one week later, she would have seen the beach scraped completely clean.
She would have still seen the rubbish which litters the roads but that
was not the point of her letter.
Outgoing tides on the Clyde tend to swirl round into the Gareloch and
dump rubbish on to Helensburgh's shore. Such rubbish which escapes that
swirl bends up Loch Long and lands at Arrochar. That, however, is minor
compared to what the incoming tides bring in, especially in wilder
weather.
Volunteer groups do make sparodic forays to clean up, encouraged by
local authorities which provide the bags and dispose of the collection.
The council also makes frequent scrapes of the shore collecting anything
from tree-trunks to cans and containers.
Examination of the rubbish has shown that much of it will come from
jetsam from shipping, from Ireland and, believe it or not, from Canada.
We who live here are just as disgusted at what we regularly see but we
also understand the problem. Nevertheless, I thank both writers. Perhaps
their contributions will go some way towards improvements in this really
lovely part of the country.

Unless some drastic action is taken or ruling is made urgently, the

IF there's global salvation to be done, give me The Happy Gang over
the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. It might not be as exciting but at
least I understand what's going on.
Beth, Spatz, and Mr P are up against the unseen evil of The Grumpy
Gang, who have made off with all the songs. This dastardly deed is not,
thankfully, allowed to interrupt the flow of the show, and the trio's
choice of music sticks to the familiar (She'll Be Coming Round The
Mountain, Ye Cannae Shove Yer Granny Aff A Bus, Sing A Rainbow) -- the
only exceptions being the group's catchy theme tune and one other for
this show. It is all a little safe for a group who look as if they would
like an alternative career in doowop group Darts.
There are faults too in the narrative structure. The lack of any
representation of the baddies might preclude tears from the
babes-in-arms in the audience but is a little disappointing for anyone
over three -- and the involvement of two children smacked of tokenism.
Giving each of the three characters an individual foible overloads the
show and some parents will object to Beth's being an addiction to
touching up her lipstick (although compared with Spatz's gluttony and Mr
P's narcolepsy, it is fairly harmless). But did that sort of thing
bother an audience of singalong toddlers? Not a lot.

IT'S history, but not as we know it. Hopscotch Theatre Company's
version of the Jacobite Rebellion faithfully follows the chronology of
events but playfully mixes fact with fiction, with child-pleasing
references to Take That and Wet Wet Wet -- and an (un)healthy dose of
double entendres prompting adult sniggers.
The wet, wet, wet weather had kept the crowds away but the four-strong
cast easily energised us into a songalong eulogy of the young prince's
talents, complete with some hilariously inappropriate actions --
interpreting ''he can dance'' as ravey boogieing rather than quadrille
mincing.
Ross Stenhouse played the Young Pretender as a hapless but charming
prat, prone to referring to his followers as Jaffa Cakes and likely to
hold up battles while trying to decide between the blue velvet frock
coat or the tartan waistcoat. A right charlie.
Vain and somewhat weak of the brain, his heart, we were left with
little doubt, was in the right place. Wild wooden hobby horses wouldn't
stop him from leading his crusade, he declared, with an apt
demonstration. The rest of the cast had more demanding costume changes,
racing round the simple platform set pulling on and taking off courtly
robes, hooped jerseys, kilts, and the scarlet uniforms of the hated
sassenachs. Boo, hiss, boo!
A show of stamina and spirit, mirth and madness to entertain all ages.
The only disappointment was when it all came to an end.

SOME of Mr Blair's colleagues were unhappy at the Labour leader's
decision to participate in a conference organised in Australia by the
international media tycoon Mr Rupert Murdoch. Mr Blair obviously felt he
had to grasp any opportunity to expound his views and especially to an
audience composed of several hundred of Mr Murdoch's lieutenants in the
world's press and TV. Mr Murdoch's media empire was previously hostile
to Labour in this country -- and to the left generally elsewhere -- but
of late its attitudes to Britain's Tories have been cooling: the regard
for Mrs Thatcher has not been transferred to her successor. It is still
not certain that the Murdoch press will lend its editorial weight to
Labour at the next General Election but the chance is real. Just how
much this is worth is itself uncertain. Labour has won elections before
without the aid of the likes of the Times and the Sun, two of Mr
Murdoch's ''voices'' with very different, but influential, accents. But
prudent political leaders woo everyone. In this case even if formal
endorsement is not forthcoming, Mr Blair may hope for that level playing
field so prominent in politicians' thinking, and so for the chance to
put a fair case. He certainly did himself no damage when making a robust
speech defending the changes he has wrought in his party and insisting
that they have made it electable which, he confessed, it was not in the
eighties.
His speech was similar in tone to that delivered last week to the
Transport and General Workers Union. That is to say, it was confident,
and pulled no punches in its search for support. Mr Murdoch has achieved
a very powerful position in the Western media, but Mr Blair underlined
his, and Labour's, commitment to plurality and diversity in that very
area. He might have been more to Mr Murdoch's liking in his attacks on
the persistence of the British establishment in the law and the City;
Oxbridge as well as the House of Lords. Mr Murdoch, who likes the notion
of being an outsider, himself is critical of many British institutions
(hyper-critical, and even with conscious attempt to damage, some would
say). There was little indication, however, that Mr Blair would have
said much that was different in this context had the venue been
different itself. The opportunity to make his views known has been taken
at little evident cost.
Whether all the Tory press of yesteryear will maintain the hostile
front it presented to Mr Major's re-election prospects last month is
anyone's guess. Mr Major got them wrong, the second time he has done so,
since most wrote him off prematurely in 1992 as well. He is a somewhat
improbable establishment figure, and except for his work in a British
bank, mostly operating abroad, cannot easily be fitted into any of the
areas Mr Blair identified as demanding reform. Ironically, Mr Blair
himself, a public school, Oxbridge-educated, lawyer fits neatly into
several categories, something which could explain his own radicalism as
well as anything. That the choice between the two men will be difficult
to make on ideological grounds could help the former Tory press to claim
that any change of allegiance was in effect slight. The fact is that it
would be elemental. That would be no bad thing. A free press should be
what that implies, able to use its judgment to make new choices in new
circumstances. It need not be thirled to a party or a personality and it
should not be thirled to proprietors.

THE tot next to me was weeping her eyes out, not in terror of the
fearsome King Kong, who made one of the most impressive stage entrances
I have ever seen, but in despair over the fact that he had just been
felled by the artillery of the aircraft (plastic planes on sticks)
circling the Empire State Building.
Performance group Wyrd Arts had certainly effectively inspired our
sympathy for the infamous beast, in an interpretation of the classic
monster movie which utilised cinematic devices of scaled models (while
Kong roared in the foreground, a tiny gorilla toy raced up a backdrop of
skyscrapers in the background, symbolising the famous ascent) and mime
work in an evocation of the silent era.
The company blend theatrical performance with circus skills, with
Kevin Alderson donning stilts and monkey suit to create the necessary
menace. Normally performed outdoors, the cast get maximum effect from
minimum props, causing a minor sensation during this performance when an
artfully aimed smoke bomb sparked off a small fire in the electrics.
It's an ingenious show and highly effective as a spectacle, thanks
largely to the awesome ape. But the plot is too thin, the humour too
obvious for street-smart sarcastic kids, the slapstick comedy lacks
slap, and the pace quickly palls. It's a short show, only lasting about
half an hour, but it still feels 10 minutes too long.

SO this is Mr Showbiz? he ironised himself. Ivor Cutler tells you
things about living in the second half of the twentieth century. Some of
them you didn't know you needed to know. We waited in silence for the
beginning of the show while he changed his hat. He rattled into the
second half before the bar had been closed with a: ''Coming ready or
not.''
''There's no use trying to talk seriously to you because you think I'm
a funny bloke,'' he told us, adding: ''Only in bits.'' For every surreal
take-on existence, every oblique discursion on the unknown properties of
porridge, there is a balancing universal truth. It is delivered not with
pompous philosophical intent but in the manner of a home truth. Not that
you would want to live there.
We might have guessed that the consumption of a pie supper is a
turn-off, but the sexual properties of Velcro were, perhaps, more of a
revelation. That pure mathematics has caused more havoc than organised
religion now seems self-evident, and of course the man himself is the
living embodiment of the wisdom of simulating having a stone in your
plimsoll in the race of life. It seems perfectly feasible that in one
his more relaxed moments an eagle told him: ''My fledglings have all
your LPs.''
With a borrowed harmonium, he sang his inimitable songs, including a
new trio of bizarre cowboy ones. ''If you don't understand, ask the
people who are laughing,'' he advised. As he pointed out
topographically, you have to know what's up and down to be able to make
comparisons.

SO Scotland is to become the Bavaria of Britain if Labour wins the
General Election. We shall be represented in Brussels in the same way as
the German lander (states) under the control of a Scottish parliament.
This means we shall take the Westminster by-pass to the European Union
and have our own national office in Brussels.
The very idea sounds great if you believe in maximalist Scottish
devolution -- or the fast lane of the slippery slope to separatism if
you don't. If you are a Scottish nationalist, it sounds like an
elaborate con.
The Germans call their lander offices ''information bureaux''. In fact
they are embassies in all but name with a reputation for hankering after
ever more power. It seemed like a good idea, therefore, to check out
just what the lander get up to in Brussels and what powers they enjoy.
In Strasbourg I asked one of the heavyweights of the assembly, Mr
Willi Gorlach, who leads the German socialist group. If you want to
learn how the lander system works then Willi Gorlach is your man. For
nine years he was at the heart of the system -- and its relationship
with Brussels -- as a Minister in Hess, a state with a population just a
touch bigger than Scotland's. His portfolios were farming and
environment, both big European issues.
His first thought was one of puzzlement at why the ''United'' Kingdom
(which most Europeans take to mean a unitary state) should feel the need
to adopt a federal model. ''I suppose my Labour friends are doing this
because of the Scottish nationalists,'' he concluded, smartly, making
clear he dislikes the idea of separatism.
But he also defended the principle of decentralisation. ''To German
eyes it is so natural -- regional parliaments are normal for Germans,
regardless of political party. It is hard for us to understand why this
was never done before in the UK.''
Well, I explained, it was hard for some of us to understand, too, but
there you are. What about the lander?
In Germany there are 16 lander. They have no say in foreign policy or
defence. All are entitled to their bureaux in Brussels. Bigger ones,
like Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia, have their own offices. Half a
dozen others share premises. Hesse has gone one better, cohabiting with
an Italian region, apparently with great success.
Lander have the right to send their Ministers as observers to the
Council of Ministers, the premier law-making EU institution. There have
been reports of lander Ministers actually casting votes but Mr Gorlach
could not think of an example. My efforts to find a precedent also
failed.
Mr Gorlach believes the system is more sophisticated than that. When
the council's agenda is drawn up, lander Ministers meet to discuss a
joint approach. They decide policy by, if necessary, qualified majority
voting. Their decision is passed to the federal Minister who is expected
to vote accordingly.
What happens if he disobeys? Mr Gorlach smiled: ''Then Kohl stamps on
the Bonn Minister's head. The Chancellor does not need the political
hassle which would result.''
In other words the federal Minister votes on behalf of the regions --
or else. I wonder what will happen when some future Scottish Labour
Minister is told by his Tory counterpart in Westminster to get lost? The
scope for dispute is wondrous.
Leaving aside the niceties of voting procedures, how do the German
lander benefit from being in Brussels?
Bavaria has more than 30 people in its Brussels office, mostly
concerned with lobbying in the way that Scotland Europa in Brussels
lobbies for Scotland. If you believe Mr Robin Cook, Shadow Foreign
Secretary, Labour's proposed Scottish European Office (SEO) will be
''much more'' than a lobbying centre. It will be staffed by senior civil
servants answering to a Scottish parliament Minister.
Logic dictates that if the SEO is more than a lobbying centre it must
carry some diplomatic/political clout. But what? Labour needs to answer
that. At present Scotland Europa in Brussels lobbies (rather well) for
Scotland and hosts cultural events. It has become a focal point for
Scottish activities in the EU. No-one can easily envisage what more it
could do without moving into the forbidden realm of diplomacy which,
while flying the Union Jack, it would be denied. Labour's plan needs
tested on that score.
Mr Gorlach's strongest point is that lander lobbying is outstandingly
successful. We all think of the Germans as rich, the paymasters of the
EU. But we forget that areas of the federal republic, particularly the
reintegrated east, are needy. Bavaria, rich by Scottish standards, has
seen a transformation in its aid from Brussels since its office opened.
''This is not coincidence,'' Mr Gorlach argues. ''And this is not
simply because structural funding for Europe's needier areas has
increased anyway. It is a direct result of studying how the EU works.
Bavaria and other lander have come to realise that expertise pays big
dividends.
''Without a Bavarian presence in Brussels there would probably have
been no extra money. With it, transfers to Bavaria have multiplied
remarkably. The same goes for all the lander who have opened offices in
Brussels. They have become experts at working the system. Before, they
did not ask. It is quite remarkable how fortunes can change.''
Those who believe in an autonomous Britain, currently one of Europe's
most centralised nation states, must welcome the principle of Labour's
ideas while asking obvious questions. Such as: how much time was spent
thinking this through?
Conservatives will respond with contempt, arguing -- correctly -- that
they already send Scottish Office Ministers to sit at the top table of
EU councils. The fact that their attendance rate is rare and sometimes,
I suspect, done for show is another matter. Liberal Democrats will take
delight in Labour adopting long-standing Liberal federalist policy in
principle while failing to grasp that federalism in a non-federated
state is constitutional dynamite. The Nats will simply fall about.
Labour's heart might be in the right place but its head is up its
constitution. You have only to ask an Englishman why Scotland should
have twice the level of representation in Brussels that England has to
see the problem. On the other hand, that's England's problem.

COULD I just say at this early juncture that if anyone else feels
inclined to remind me that the spouse person and I were furth of
Scotland during an amazingly long-lasting and delightful heatwave (and
that Glasgow was the hottest spot in all Europe at this juncture), I may
just possibly feel able to jettison a lifelong attraction to pacificism.
Never mind, these bearers of unsolicited meteorological tidings have
been wont to add, I expect you had a very relaxing time. No we did not.
And if you think this is yet another occasion when this space will
instinctively seek to blame the Prime Minister of the day you are not
wrong.
For scarcely is the ink dry on the promisory note to the bank
exchanging income for French-type francs than your man chooses to
resign. This is not the kind of news an averagely obsessive political
groupie needs to learn just as she is boarding a jet plane to nowhere.
Or, more precisely, a jet plane to an island village originally selected
for the fact it was the kind of sleepy hollow on which the rest of the
world steadfastly refused to impinge.
The attractions of just such a backwater began to recede slightly when
it became plain that during this self-inflicted absence from one of the
juiciest political dramas of the decade, the only piece of newsprint
available from the village store was Corse Matin. A fine and indeed
honourable organ to be sure, but one which displayed no detectable
interest in the future leadership of the UK Conservative and Unionist
Party.
At length, after much frenzied investigation, it was established that
a port no more than half an hour away might just possibly sell a British
newspaper provided there was an R in the month and the handful of other
expats in town hadn't hotfooted there first.
So the tentative morning plan of warmed croissants, fresh orange
juice, and substantial paperback with the odd dip added for variety
swiftly became transformed into a post-croissant 20-mile race for the
last of the International Guardian which was, on a good day, at least a
day late.
Ah but, you say. Ah but do not these media people never leave home
without the mobile phone, fax, and shortwave radio set in case an
unrefusable offer from Radio Clachnaccudden should emerge. Well nix to
the first two. Mobile phones are now so ubiquitous as to render those of
us still wired to the wall the subject of historical fascination. But
the problem with carrying phones is that people call you on them. So we
don't.
The radio is different. The radio is packed on every occasion lest
some small sporting event is being staged in any corner of the globe
which the husband might risk missing. And is, natch, obligatory when he
wife is crass enough to book hols during Wimbledon. (Only to leave after
the Rugby World Cup and get you back for the Open my angel.)
So all is not lost, I think foolishly. All I need to keep myself fully
and comprehensively posted on Dr Spock versus Dan Dull is to tune into
that familiar BBC World Service news signature tune and I will miss
nothing of note.
From what I recalled of previous World Service encounters, the trot
round the global news was regularly followed by in-depth summaries of
United Kingdom matters. No more. At least no more at any slot I could
detect.
As the contest heated up at home, the BBC kept me up to scratch on the
minutiae of the bloodless coup in Qatar, the plight of the Rawandan
mountain gorilla, the Haitian elections, and assorted unrest in East
Timor. On one bulletin I counted no fewer than three different stories
variously featuring North and South Korea.
But about the turmoil in the Tory Party they were strangely and
infuriatingly coy.
Then came the day the result was due. Surely someone somewhere at
World Service radio news might actually consider this newsworthy. Yes
they did.
Yes there would be a whole half-hour programme giving us the result
and analysing it with the help of people at the very heart of
contemporary politics like Lord Howe. So we lurked by the radio. And
when Sir Marcus Fox rose to make his dramatic announcement, World
Service gave him a quick body swerve in order to check on the Sanchez
Vicario backhand. Who are these people? The following day was the great
reshuffle. To kill time waiting for the big announcement we ran a sweep
as to which Minister would go where; author of least-accurate
predictions buys dinner. And the news came through. Michael Heseltine
was to be Prince Charming, our own Malky was to be clasped to the
relieved bosom of the Foreign Office. And at that the Beeb lost
interest. Not a peep about the rest. We had a 24-hour delay before
Guardian confirmation that the Forsyth Saga was to be re-transmitted
north of the Border.
Now it's a splendid thing that the BBC World Service is in no way
parochial.
And doubtless there were Koreans and Qatarians furiously twiddling
their tranny knobs lest they lost a moment's coverage of their local
drama. But I seem to remember just somewhere in the not-so-small print
of their remit, the World Service is not merely there to tell Britain
about the world, but to advise Britons worldwide what is happening back
at the ranch.
Howandsoever we are back. Mr Major is back. Mr Forsyth is back. I have
availed myself of sufficient back issues of Scottish newspapers to find
out, somewhat belatedly, who did what to whom during the electoral war.
But I have a warning for the PM who, I feel sure, reads The Herald daily
and avidly. But, just in case not, I plan to fax him full details of our
next planned vacation. And if he calls a General Election during the due
dates I could turn a whole lot meaner than Mr Redwood.

WHEN MPs throw their schoolbags into the air on Wednesday night and
head for the Italian lakes, Greek islands, or wherever the holiday
cottage happens to be, few will be more grateful for the break than the
Right Honourable Member for Huntingdon, Mr John Major.
The 1994-95 parliamentary session has been for him what one might
aptly describe as an absolute pig or, as the Queen once put it, an annus
horibilis.
Sleaze allegations, ministerial resignations, the Scott inquiry,
endless squabbling with the Euro-sceptics, a leadership election which
caused more trouble than Mr Major expected and, of course, continued and
unhelpful sniping from That Bloody Woman.
The Prime Minister was written off by many commentators when John
Redwood entered the leadership fray, with a number of them quite sure
that Major was holed below the water line and that there would
definitely be a second ballot paving the way for Mr Heseltine to come
storming into power.
Not so, and it is a tribute Major's undoubted toughness -- which those
close to him will tell you about but which belies the public image --
that he came through wounded but well able to carry on the fight.
The two main problems he now faces, apart from praying night and
morning that there are not too many more by-elections, are the continued
difficulties with the Europhobes and the worry that at any time the
''sleaze'' factor could once again hit the headlines.
As Geoffrey Parkhouse pointed out in these columns last week, those
with strong beliefs on Europe may have been temporarily muzzled by the
outcome of the leadership campaign, but they will continue to put
forward their views and if, towards the next election they get brave
again and decide to be as vociferous as they have been in the past, they
could still spell trouble.
Turkeys voting for Christmas they might be, but these people seem to
believe their cause is of such earth-shattering importance to the future
of this sovereign nation that it transcends all else. In any case they
believe that the vast majority of British people share their scepticism
and that if the Government only would adopt a similar sceptical stance
the Tories would walk the next election.
Mr Major, who has had rather more pragmatic experience of how the
European issue should be handled to keep us as players in the game while
not surrendering that which we hold dear, must dearly wish they would
shut up and take a rather more practical view, if only for the sake of
his party's credibility.
Sleaze could be the big enemy. The public does not expect its
politicians to be lily white, and at least one political commentator of
my acquaintance has remarked that someone who does not have or never has
had a mistress is unfit for Cabinet Office.
Such unfortunate remarks aside, it remains the case that the ''snouts
in the trough'' stuff was in danger of running out of control earlier
this year and that the Tories probably now are irrevocably tainted by
the ''sleaze'' factor.
The House is due to debate the Nolan committee report on Wednesday and
is likely to kick at least some of its recommendations into touch, while
today sees publication of the report of the Greenbury committee into
executive pay. Just how much of the mud from that will stick to the
Government remains to be seen, but rightly or wrongly, and market forces
notwithstanding, there undoubtedly is public anger about power and water
bosses earning National Lottery-style salaries and a clear perception
that this is being done under ''jobs-for-the-boys'' rules.
Mr Major must act, indeed he already may have acted through the Whips,
to make sure there are no more skeletons to come out of the cupboards of
his ministerial team, and indeed his back benchers, because in the run
up to the next election the Tories can ill afford many more damaging
allegations in the tabloids.
All that said, there are some signs that the 1995-96 session will be a
happier one for the Prime Minister. He has a new ministerial team in
place and, of course, there is Hezza.
A couple of debates last week showed that the Cabinet is moving to
turn up the heat on Labour in key policy areas, namely the economy and
social policy, notably the minimum wage.
The Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and his Labour Shadow Gordon Brown
had a real set-to. In one of the few genuine debates seen for some time,
both men repeatedly intervened in each other's speeches and pointed
fingers at each other across the despatch box as Clarke tried to pull
rank over Brown as the man actually in a difficult job making difficult
decisions.
Clarke, in his usual cavalier style, accused Brown of talking
''drivel'', and ''vacuous rubbish''. Brown, for his part, was anxious to
know what was the Chancellor's inflation target, mocking him for not
seeming clear. Clarke retorted he was perfectly clear it was 2.5% or
less and, rounding on Brown, bellowed: ''What's yours? You don't have
one.''
A similar confrontation came in a debate on social and economic
policy, with Mr Donald Dewar once again put under the cosh on the level
of Labour's proposed minimum wage. There will be more of this in the
coming year as the Government tries to turn the screw on Labour over
policy detail and the public increasingly seeks answers from the
Opposition front bench.
The Hezza factor could be considerable, and while he has barely
settled into his new job it is clear that Mr Major has acknowledged he
lacks the presentational skills Heseltine can provide and is giving him
full reign. Heseltine, acknowledging the dangers of the job, has said it
is important it should not be possible to put a ''cigarette paper''
between the two on policy and, providing that holds, he could be a
formidable right-hand man.
Major can only put the past year behind him, produce a belting
performance at the annual conference in October, and hope for the best.
He told his party the other day that they had only 94 weeks to put it
right. That is not a long time in politics.

THE National Lottery is already a remarkable success as far as raising
money is concerned. As time goes on, its worth in distributing cash to
good causes may become clearer but some drawbacks are already obvious
and giving cause for concern. These ought to be capable of remedy; and,
with goodwill, the arrangements can be reassessed and changed. Some
changes may be hard to achieve since they really concern individuals and
not the lottery itself or its promotors. The most striking example is
the way in which the new body seems to have siphoned off much direct
public donation to charity. Those who gamble may be salving the
consciences by thinking they are also ''giving''. That benefit does
exist but only to a very limited extent. Anyone wanting to donate to
charity should do so directly. Buying a lottery ticket is not a
substitute. Indeed the two actions are so distinct that the question
which should be asked by those charities who are losing out, is why do
people donate to us at all? Charitable donation ought to be a deliberate
and conscious act, involving the notion of sacrifice, however modest.
Buying a lottery ticket is an act of indulgence designed in the hope of,
massive, personal gain. The two motives are so distinct, antagonistic
even, that it is hard to see how people have become confused, but they
have. Perhaps the old Roman notion that private vice can be public good
has misled them into imagining that their new gambling could actually
fund the charitable sector of public welfare.
There is, however, the fact, which may explain the confusion, that
most charitable giving, especially from direct donations to street cash
cans or boxes, is small in amount, though considerable in aggregate. It
may therefore seem unimportant to the individual donors. They may be
escaping the social embarrassment of having openly to refuse to give
anything to a good cause, rather than making a small sacrifice for one.
The average punt on the lottery is itself rather small, something which
may add to the mental confusion. There is, however, little doubt that
public opinion needs educating on this score.
Would much change if the lottery were run by a non-profiting body? In
this respect probably not much. But would it have been such a success
without the profit motive which drives Camelot, the highly effective
promotor? Such questions are intriguing, partly because they admit of no
certain answer. And there is no certain answer, though Richard Branson,
a clever profit maker himself, thought that the non-profit-making
formula would have worked. Camelot's profit making certainly seems to be
resented (Branson calls for a windfall profits tax on the company to be
diverted straight to charity). The Labour Shadow Heritage Secretary, Mr
Chris Smith, thinks that Camelot could be replaced, after a decent
interval, by a non-profit-making body. That would be perfectly possible.
Yet what is interesting about all such reactions is the hostility they
display to the profit motive, the very mechanism vital to our national
success as a producer of goods and services for sale at prices higher
than cost to other countries. (It is also one of the most useful
mechanisms for showing whether it is worth investing scarce capital in
particular ventures.) New Labour is supposed to be quite keen on
profits: Mr Smith's thinking aloud qualifies their enthusiasm somewhat.
Camelot is, of course, a monopoly licensed by the state, and that may
make a difference. The licence is not in perpetuity. Its renewal could
be for ever-higher fees. That might make no difference to the profits,
but it could transfer even more of them to the Treasury.

BETWEEN FRIENDS -- The Correspondence of Hannah Arendt and Mary
McCarthy 1949-1975
Edited by Carol Brightman
Secker &amp; Warburg: #25
A LOVER may drive you to murder, a friend will help you hide the
corpse. Within these contorted loyalties lies a certain perception of
each role: lovers are known to induce madness; friends are expected to
clean up the mess.
The association between Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy was never so
perilously tested but their mutual correspondence over oceans,
continents, and decades speaks of something far more profound than
anything that might pass for friendship via the Internet today. For 30
years, in a culture where people still knew how to compose their inner
life on notepaper, they exchanged letters: Hannah, the German thinker
schooled in exalted solitude but making her home amid the raw frenzy of
the United States, and Mary, the irrepressible, much-married American
transplanted by her final love to Paris where her caustic writing did
little to harm her charming celebrity as an able diplomat's wife.
They first met in the New York of the forties, and grew to become
among the most prominent intellectuals of their generation, all the time
building an unassailable road into each other's hearts, laying down
letters as the flagstones of their progress and romance. That
correspondence, now edited by McCarthy's biographer, Carol Brightman,
reads like a travelogue through both the lush uplands of European and
American literary society and the swamps which beset their day --
post-war guilt, communism and anti-communism, the Kennedy
assassinations, Vietnam, the student riots of Paris in the sixties,
Watergate . . .
In all such storms, as well as personal turmoil -- it was Hannah's
unsentimental intercession which persuaded Mary's third husband to agree
to a divorce -- the letters provided a path to sanity and caring, and
although Brightman is fastidious in explaining that the link between the
two women was not sexual, it was not entirely platonic either. The
desire for one another's company is patent, especially during the
sixties after McCarthy had settled in Europe. But the intensity of that
need possesses the ache of homesickness, a plea to be snatched from
alien surroundings by a person of unrationed trust.
Mary to Hannah, from Rome, 1960: I am writing you this note for purely
selfish reasons; because my heart is full of emotion and I want to talk.
As if we were in your apartment . . .
Hannah to Mary, from New York, 1968: God knows why I write only today.
I wrote you countless letters -- thanking you, missing you so much,
thinking of you with new closeness and tenderness. The trouble is that
in order to write you must stop thinking; also thinking can be done so
comfortably, writing is so troublesome. Forgive me.
Here, in fact, Hannah had defined one of the significant differences
between the two. Mary, wreathed in fame but also scarred by jealous
sniping after the publication of her novel The Group, would lunge
towards stationery in jubilation, her thrusting ideas as well as news
and sceptical wit spilling over pages in beautifully crafted prose. But
Hannah only rarely lifted the safety curtain on emotion partly because
Nazism had schooled her, like all Jewish victims, to be instinctively
secretive, and partly because she believed intimate experience was
nevertheless universal and so not worth writing about, unless to weave a
story round it.
Mary McCarthy gave Brightman permission to reproduce the letters, but
had the penfriends been less eminent would their correspondence have
made it into print? Much of the book refers to people unknown by the
public yet its detail remains more than a feast for the intellegentsia's
theses. Its vanished eloquence illustrates the unique pleasure letters
bring in the long-distance caretaking of one friend for another. For us,
too, there is that sly joy of nosing through other people's
indiscretions. From Hannah we read that the anthropologist Margaret Mead
was ''a monster'' of offhand arrogance, while, after a London encounter
with Germaine Greer in 1970, Mary felt compelled to disclose that the
then idol of the women's movement was an absurd Australian giantess.
''And here's another marvellous one,'' she continued, referring to
Sonia Orwell as quoted by Stephen Spender: '''Auschwitz, oh dear no!
That person was never in Auschwitz. Only in some very minor death camp.'
The ultimate English snobbery.''
It wasn't that McCarthy and Arendt were not feminists -- a restless
independence ruled each body and soul. But their pasts had bred in them
a cast-iron certainty of their own merit. Hannah possessed ''an
extraordinary electric vitality'' despite her shyness yet she had a
rootlessness about her, the legacy of an internment camp. Mary, an
orphan of Catholic and Jewish blood, thrived on a sense of embattlement,
especially when it involved other writers. Secure and free in their own
talents, neither woman needed the libbers' pack, but what each exile
found in the other was an emotional home to which they returned again
and again.
Hannah hated flashiness of any sort, especially in a writer,
condemning one of Norman Mailer's reviews as ''so full of personal and
stupid invectiveness (stupid meaning vulgar) that I can't understand how
or why they printed it''. Simone de Beauvoir, lover of Sartre and fabled
existentialist, also earned the women's mutual contempt, Arendt once
complaining to an editor that: ''The trouble is that you don't realise
she is not very bright. Instead of arguing with her, you should flirt
with her.''
As for Mary, she seemed to possess a love-hate relationship with
France. This most sophisticated American in Paris would throw genuinely
hospitable parties devoid of any bourgeois elitism. When she and Jim
West, her popular diplomat husband, were entertaining, a Nobel laureate
would be encouraged to chat to a lawyer's wife from Milwaukee. Yet when
irritated by her chic exile Mary would privately strike out at what she
called the hysterical chauvinism of the French. ''At the slightest
criticism of an apple in the market they start screaming at you about La
France; 'vous etes en France, vous savez.'''
The friends, of course, were sometimes fractious. Hannah cautioned
Mary about her motives and impetuosity in wanting to see the horror of
Vietnam for herself. And Mary readily expressed a pedant's irritation
with Hannah's sometimes slipshod vocabulary. But the correspondence
reveals only one true reprimand when Hannah punctures Mary's outrage
that she and Jim could not marry more quickly because their respective
spouses were loath to grant divorce: ''It seems to me rather obvious''
she noted dryly, ''that you are the victims of your own self-chosen
past.''
Their colds, their rheumatics and influenzas, their trouble with
dentistry and encroaching cardiac problems -- this journey of epistles
takes us from the women's prime into the gallant householding of their
old age. Arendt died first, aged 79, and for the next 14 years one
suspects Mary McCarthy kept up an imaginary dialogue with her, ''a
distinct presence in this room, listening to my words, possibly
assenting with her musing nod, possibly stifling a yawn.''
To the end both women considered illness an intrusion into a mentally
vigorous adventure. But they also knew that precisely because a friend
can die, or leave, friendship is one of the most precious of human
experiences. Here, with every envelope, was proof that the tragedies of
life are not the friends who let you down, but the people who never miss
anyone.

I used to get heckled by snobby Tory women in the constituency
There could be no industrial peace without the pits being nationalised
Barbara Castle broke new ground not only as a woman MP but one who
achieved power in post-war Labour governments. She is still fighting the
good fight at 84, and tells Julia Langdon of the sense of social justice
that continues to inform her work
''We had guts in those days. We did what had to be done. We didn't
look over our shoulders and say: 'We'll be losing votes' or 'People will
be criticising us'. We did what was right!''
THERE is an undimmed passion in the words, an unapologetic
triumphalism in what she says, which, as ever, carries a message for
today. Do you hear her, Tony Blair? There is an undiminished fervour in
the voice, too -- are you listening, Tony Blair? -- which is meant to be
heard in the office of the leader of today's Opposition, as it first was
in the Parliament elected in the glorious optimism that came in the wake
of what her generation will always call ''The War''.
That war, which was followed in 1945 by that election, and which then
produced that famous Parliament: the post-war Labour Government which
started to rebuild Britain's shattered cities, and which constructed a
new social fabric fitting for a new era, fit, indeed, for heroes.
Fifty summers have gone now and most of the main players are dead and
gone, too. But here she is: still vibrant with indignation about one
issue or another, still passionate, still not sorry about anything to do
with her commitments to socialism, about doing what was right then, and
what she has no doubt at all is right today. Is she right, Tony Blair?
She is an old lady, but she is still recognised wherever she goes. And
the voice is unmistakable, for its timbre and its tone as much as for
what she has to say. Fifty years after her first election to Parliament
at her first attempt -- the youngest woman MP she was among the 24
women, 21 of them Labour when there had only been one sole Labour woman
before -- and that voice still carries the same socialist certitude that
she brought with her into the hopeful politics of 1945.
And now here she is, the Right Honourable Baroness Castle of
Blackburn, dignified with the membership of the House of Lords, called
''M'Lady'' by the flunkies on official duty and handled with solicitous
deference by the policemen in the Members' Lobby who are almost
certainly selected for their secondary skills in dealing with the
elderly and confused, among whom this particular lady is not numbered.
A visit to the Lords' Lobby provides the opposite experience to seeing
old television film clippings of today's politicians in their youth,
jogging the memories of those of us old enough to remember how once they
were. It is like straying on to a film-set called something like ''All
Our Yesterdays'', peopled by dimly remembered ghosts whose faces and
physical frames have been subject to some curious fast-forward button.
''It is,'' says Barbara Castle, part humorously and part in horror as we
hasten away to the Tea Room, ''the ante-chamber of Death.''
She does not dress like most 84-year-olds. She is wearing a stylish
suit in a brilliant lime green and cream and it becomes her. The ''fiery
young redhead'' that Blackburn constituency Labour Party was encouraged
to interview in 1944 (when it was suggested to the white male trade
unionists that they should at least consider a woman candidate -- it
was, after all, the women in Blackburn Labour Party, as everywhere, who
were ''doing all the bloody work'') now has a head of pale red-gold
hair. She shows every bit as much interest and concern for her
appearance as ever she did.
She was a borough councillor in London, had been an air raid warden
throughout the Blitz -- ''and in as much danger as I'd ever like to be''
-- and an active politician who was already attracting national
attention.
When she made a speech demanding an immediate start on the
implementation of the Beveridge Report at Labour's 1944 party
conference, her photograph appeared on the front page of the Daily
Mirror. She had a balloon coming out of her mouth with the words: ''Jam
tomorrow but never jam today -- that is what the Government try to say
to the people, but WE WANT JAM TODAY.''
What she got was a husband and a job. It was the journalist Ted Castle
who had put her picture on the front page and who was to seek her out
and marry her. Coincidentally, she also left her job as a temporary
civil servant in the Fish Division, propounding the supposed advantages
of snook, and started working for the Daily Mirror.
''They decided the big issue was going to be housing on demobilisation
and, of course, they were right. The lads wanted out; they wanted to get
married and they didn't want to live with their in-laws.
''A million houses had been destroyed, or so structurally damaged they
couldn't be repaired, there weren't any bricklayers -- they were all in
the forces -- and there weren't any bricks. It was very shrewd of the
Mirror. They made me Housing Correspondent. I remember writing the first
piece about a prefab. It was Labour's answer -- and they were supposed
to be temporary.''
She concedes they were still there 30 years afterwards. They
unwittingly became part of the fabric. Certainly in the middle fifties,
during countless intervals at Arbroath High School, I can remember
skipping to the rhythmn of: ''Down in the jungle/Living in a
tent,/Better than a pre-fab,/No rent!''
But by then the new, young Mrs Barbara Castle had, somewhat to her
astonishment, found herself elected to the House of Commons and,
incidentally, out of a job. The Mirror sent her a telegram of
congratulations on her election and added: ''Sorry, you're sacked.''
They were very decent and gave her a year's pay, Ted had a job and she
was due #600 per annum as an MP. They also lived in London and did not
have children to support. It was very different for other new MPs with
constituencies way outside London, in the North, with families to
maintain, lodgings to pay for, and no system of allowances.
''One of the things that I admired most about that Government,'' she
says, looking back into her memory, recalling those days, ''was that the
Prime Minister just said: 'This is intolerable and we are raising the
parliamentary salary to #1000'. You can imagine what the Tories made of
that. The first thing they did when they got in was to feather their own
nests!
''I used to get heckled by snobby Tory women in the constituency and I
would say: 'You only want to be represented by rich people, do you? A
poor man can't afford to do the parliamentary job on #600 a year! It was
a good courageous thing we did. That was lovely. I liked that.''
The victorious Labour candidates from that election had met to elect
their leader before they took their seats in the House of Commons.
Clement Attlee was chosen without a vote, by acclaim. There were more
than 40 young men among the new MPs who were still in uniform, who had
come straight from the Front to fight the election. Yet Labour was being
depicted in an unflattering light by the beaten Tories.
Even now the memory of it kindles Barbara Castle's anger. ''We said:
'We're not the patriotic party? Who won the bloody war then, for God's
sake?' There was this sort of heads-held-high pride about us: pride in
our movement, our class, our young candidates and in our leader.''
Attlee was a military man and he carried his training with him. There
was no argument. There could have been none about, for example,
modifying Clause 4, she explains with an oblique but still scathing
reference to the Labour Party of today.
''We obeyed orders. He said: 'This is the manifesto on which we were
elected and we are going to carry it out'. Nobody ever tried modifying
it or watering it down or anything.''
She had walked over to the House of Commons on the day she took her
seat to be shown round by her friend, the new Member for Devonport,
Michael Foot. His father had been an MP and he was not as intimidated as
most of the others. He took her into a ''Members' Only'' corridor and
they were stopped by a policeman.
''He said: 'Excuse me, sir. No friends are allowed'. So Michael said:
'This is no guest. This is Mrs Barbara Castle. MP'. And of course the
policeman nearly collapsed.''
Women were about to begin breaking through more barriers. Barbara
Castle did her own bit in those heady days of achieving firsts. Some
were of more relevance than others, but at Westminster some had a
particular significance -- like entering the House of Commons' Smoking
Room, until then a sanctum which no woman had ever been allowed to
penetrate.
She found that the new women MPs did not encounter the scale of
hostility that Nancy Astor had met as an MP in the 1920s. There was a
different response in the 1940s. ''They tried to kill us with
patronising kindness,'' she remembers. ''When they had their ankles
bitten once or twice I think they stopped it.'' She produces a huge
mischievous grin at the memory of it.
She smiles about it now, but it wasn't easy then. She was, after all,
someone whose own career early became attached to the fortune of the
Labour Government, for she was Parliamentary Private Secretary, the
Westminster bag carrier, first for Stafford Cripps and then for Harold
Wilson.
There was a sense which imbued everything that the Government did.
''Nothing was done out of theory. It was all done out of practical
need.'' So it was, for example, that the coal industry was nationalised:
not as a matter of ideology, she emphasises, but as a matter of
necessary pragmatic politics. It was a major industry in which the
workers had been unnecessarily exposed to risks, in poor conditions and
on low pay.
The implications were simple: ''There could not have been industrial
peace in Britain if the pits had not been nationalised, and the men
given decent pay and conditions,'' says Barbara Castle now. And what
about electricity? The nationalisation of the 200 private companies was
also a matter of practical need. She knew that from her own family.
''Ted's parents lived in a little bungalow in the New Forest. It was
all oil lamps and Mum was cooking whatever rations we got on a paraffin
stove -- how she ever managed to cook anything, God only knows -- and it
was one of the areas that didn't have a cat in hell's chance of getting
electricity from any of the private companies that were supplying in the
most prosperous areas.
''When they were nationalised we had electricity and we even had a
little electric oven. Oh my, that stuck in my memory at the time. How
long would they have had to wait? What nationalisation did for this
country was to get a national uniformity of services -- in transport,
electricity, gas, the Post Office; it was the same unifying principle
which said: 'You're entitled to the basic services of a civilised
society and not depending on where you live'.''
The pride of that Government, the jewel, its greatest and most
long-lasting achievement was, of course, the creation of the National
Health Service. Here, too, Barbara Castle interprets its relevance in
personal terms.
Years later, her husband, Ted, needed open-heart surgery and was
admitted to the National Heart Hospital. In the same ward was one of
Barbara's constituents from Blackburn. He shared with Ted the same
consultant, one Donald Ross, for a fabulously expensive life-saving
operation. ''My constituent and my husband had shared the same resources
of the country, in the same crisis in their lives. That to us was the
living embodiment of socialism.''
That was what the National Health Service was meant to be all about.
The former Secretary of State knows what she is talking about here.
She knows about people, too. She and her colleagues learned about the
realities of people's lives very early on in their careers in that
Parliament. She believes they set the pattern for the post-war
relationship between MPs and their constituents, partly because they
introduced innovations such as political surgeries where people could
present their MPs with their personal problems.
There would be 40 there every time in Blackburn. It took Barbara
Castle a little while to learn that she could not take on every
individual problem as her own without becoming ''a worn-out piece of
rag''.
That was 50 years ago and she was in her early thirties. This is
no-worn out piece of anything, though. Yes, the physical frame has its
shortcomings. She had a bad fall last year and still suffers neck pain.
''Can you see? Can you tell?'' she asks worriedly when I ask about the
uncomfortable way she holds herself. She is a widow now and obviously
badly misses Ted. She has the concerns of others of her age, or of any
age, about things like money.
Her literary agent has been badgering her to write another book, a bit
more politically philosophical than her greatly entertaining and
successful memoirs published two years ago, but she complains that she
hasn't got the resources to do it. Wouldn't the advance pay for a
researcher? ''Be your age!'' she snaps sharply. ''It's a terrible time
to publish anything unless you're -- what's his name? -- Jeffrey Archer
or Catherine Cookson or Barbara Cartland.''
We have tried to cover something of this huge canvas of those six
important years of Government. We have also talked about Potsdam and the
restructing of the post-war world. We have skated gently over
potentially treacherous comparisons between the fearless Labour Party of
50 years ago and the New Labour of the 1990s. ''Come on,'' she says,
just a little impatiently, ''that's enough,'' and I fear I have
exhausted her. On the contrary. She is due to go to a party and she
wants to get there on time.
That is because she is wondering whether to go to another two parties
afterwards. She has still got guts, in all sorts of ways, these days.

COLOMBO: Tamil Tiger guerrillas sank a Sri Lankan Navy radar-equipped
command ship and lost three of their own craft in a daring attack on a
naval base in the northern Jaffna Peninsula yesterday. The military said

Have politicians become slaves to the soundbite, and does the public
now find their slick responses a turn off? Nicholas Jones gives his
assessment
HOWEVER much politicians might be derided for communicating through
soundbites there is, as far as they are concerned, no alternative. For
as long as television continues to reign supreme as the electorate's
principal source of political information, the electronic news media
will go on influencing the shape and content of public utterances by
ministers and MPs.
American TV and radio journalists, who first used the term
''soundbite'' in the 1960s, recognised, as did political publicists,
that there was a degree of self-interest on both sides in trying to
persuade politicians to encapsulate their arguments in brief,
self-contained statements or answers.
News programmes are prepared under tight time constraints. Long,
rambling extracts cannot be accommodated. Therefore politicians,
desperate to publicise their hopes and aspirations, know that to achieve
maximum impact they have to supply the broadcasters what they want.
Soundbites tend to last for around 15 to 20 seconds and usually
contain no more than 40 to 50 words. While politicians often feel
constrained at having to limit themselves to three or four sentences
they sometimes forget that viewers and listeners pick up much more than
might be imagined from these carefully-honed responses.
At their most effective, soundbites not only convey political messages
but also reinforce, or perhaps reveal, personal characteristics.
Therefore they can be a highly individualist form of expression.
John Major tends to be at his most memorable when he is on the
defensive, with his back to the wall, as illustrated during his
resignation statement in the garden of No 10 Downing Street. His
challenge to critics of his leadership to ''put up or shut up'' was
hardly a match for Tony Blair's aggressive rallying cry at question time
the previous month. When the Prime Minister suggested the Opposition had
just as many Euro rebels as the Conservatives, the Labour leader
retorted: ''There is one very big difference. I lead my party, he
follows his.''
Close to the top of any soundbite hit parade would have to be ''The
lady's not for turning'', Margaret Thatcher's strident refusal to change
course when faced by a deepening recession and rising unemployment. Her
unforgettable line at the Conservatives' 1980 party conference entered
political folklore: ''To those waiting with bated breath for that
favourite media catchphrase, the U-turn, I have only one thing to say.
You turn if you want to. The lady's not for turning.'' Of all the catch
phrases of the Thatcher era, it seemed to sum up the Prime Minister who
would not give way.
An ill-judged or badly worded soundbite can prove equally enduring.
Harold Wilson did himself incalculable political damage in his
ministerial broadcast after the 1967 devaluation when he insisted that
while the pound abroad was ''worth 14% or so less in terms of other
currencies'' it did not mean that ''the pound here in Britain in your
pocket or in your purse or in your bank had been devalued''. Wilson's
critics regarded the broadcast as epitomising his deviousness.
One important similarity in these two soundbites was that they emerged
from key moments in the Wilson and Thatcher governments. Both were aimed
at shoring up public support for momentous shifts in economic
management. The criticism of the soundbites of the 1990s is that all too
often they are written and delivered to obscure the absence of
decisions. Presentation is being put before policy-making.
Broadcasters are sometimes rightly accused of being seduced by the
slick responses devised by speech writers and spin doctors, of letting
the politicians dictate the news agenda with empty words and meaningless
phrases.
However, the words which form the crux of a speech or interview are
usually chosen with great care and might well have taken weeks of
Cabinet or party discussion to agree. Politicians cannot be expected to
forsake their well-rehearsed replies, nor can they afford to be caught
off guard by making loosely worded policy pronouncements.
While soundbites may have their detractors, they have become part of
the lifeblood of daily political journalism. Lists of the best quotes of
the day or the week are a regular feature in most newspapers. Many owe
their existence not to political phrase-makers but to journalistic
persistence and ingenuity. Patient coaxing can tease out an unplanned
answer from even the most sure-footed politician.
With political discourse increasingly reduced to a battle of slogans
there is a real problem for anyone who wants or needs to hold the
listener's attention for longer than a few seconds. Broadcasters unable
to extract what they judge to be a suitable soundbite from an unexciting
address frequently take their revenge by talking over film of the speech
so that TV viewers have to listen to the journalist rather than the
politician.
This practice of allowing politicians to be seen ''goldfishing'' --
being reduced to the status of guppies in an aquarium, haplessly opening
and shutting their mouths in silence -- is the source of many complaints
to the broadcasting organisations.
Since leaving Labour's front bench, Gerald Kaufman has fought a
one-man campaign against the soundbite. He has suggested that one reason
for Labour's fourth election defeat was the party's readiness to
''amputate its policies to fit into soundbites''. Instead of conniving
with the BBC and ITN in allowing peak-time news bulletins to debase
political discussion by restricting politicians to a few dozen words in
which to put their case, Labour should force its way to public attention
through ''considered speeches and structured arguments''.
I have some sympathy with politicians over their complaint that TV and
radio journalists increasingly shape the questions they are posing to
get the answers they want. Broadcasters have tended to become soundbite
junkies.
However, we should be prepared to defend our craft. In my efforts to
get shorter, less complicated replies, I frequently find myself trying
to persuade ministers and MPs to rehearse their answers. I continue to
ask them the same question, perhaps with a slight variation, until I am
satisfied with the length and content of their reply.
Surprisingly most politicians welcome this and are only too willing to
re-do the interview in the hope of providing a concise answer which will
stand on its own and not need editing. I accept I may be laying myself
open to accusations of collusion, but I see my role as being no
different from that of a newspaper journalist who might compress or tidy
up one of the many quotes recorded in a notebook. I want the politicians
I interview to be as clear and as intelligible as possible in the news
reports for which I am responsible.

Plans to ensure the survival of 17 varieties of endangered Scottish
flora and fauna, including the white-tailed eagle and the Scottish
primrose, are announced today, writes Elizabeth Buie
THE medicinal leech, the European beaver, the Scottish primrose, the
corncrake -- they have all come close to being wiped off the face of the
earth by man. Whether by hunting, over-zealous collecting, commercial
exploitation, or changes in land management, the human race has been
responsible for threatening the existence of birds, insects, mammals,
fish, and flora across Britain.
For some species it is too late. They will never bloom, crawl, fly, or
walk across this land again. But, for a selected 17 species, new efforts
are being launched to aid their recovery and help ensure their ultimate
survival.
Today, Scottish Natural Heritage launches its species action
programme, providing a co-ordinated approach to their recovery by
drawing up action plans for each species. Only 17 are being targeted at
present, although Professor Michael Usher, SNH's chief scientific
adviser, says that this is only the first list to be drawn up.
It was in the 1850s that the Yorkshire Bird Protection Society first
pushed for legislation to protect threatened species. However, it took
until 1992, when the Biodiversity Treaty was signed at the Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro, for the international community to give real
recognition to the need to sustain the variety of life on the planet.
The UK Government produced its own Biodiversity Challenge last year,
which committed its conservation agencies to producing targets and
action plans to aid the recovery of threatened species.
But not everyone will agree with the species SNH has chosen to
concentrate on.
Campaigners to have the wolf, lynx and bear reintroduced to the
Highlands will be disappointed that these large predators do not figure
on the recovery list, although sheep-farmers will raise a cheer.
SNH's decision to list the European beaver may, however, be seen as a
tentative step towards the reintroduction of some of the large animals
that once populated the Highlands.
Professor Usher says he has ''a totally open mind'' as to whether the
beaver can populate Scotland once again, after an absence of nearly 400
years. Hunted for their pelt and castoreum (scent gland), they would
have to be given legal protection if reintroduced.
The European beaver feeds on grasses, leaves and the twigs of
herbaceous plants and soft woods such as willow, aspen, and poplar,
usually near river banks, so it is unlikely to pose a threat to
commercial forestry. It prefers to nest in burrows and unlike its
American cousin, rarely builds dams.
But conservationists will have to satisfy themselves that the habitat
still exists, the animal can succeed, and that it will not damage other
species, habitats and socio-economic interests. Any reintroduction
proposals would go to full public consultation.
Professor Usher said: ''We cannot do everything. When we consider
anything that might be reintroduced, we need to consider the effect on
what is a rather small country. At this stage I do not think we could
give serious consideration to the wolf, bear, or lynx.''
The red squirrel can still be found in parts of Scotland, but their
demise is largely attributed to colonisation by the non-native grey
squirrel. Scientists are not certain whether the greys carry a disease
that kills reds, but there is no doubting that as greys expand, reds
disappear.
Three birds are on the list -- the white-tailed eagle, red kite and
corncrake. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds' senior
research biologist in Scotland, Dr Ian Bainbridge, is particularly
delighted to see the corncrake on the list, given the campaigning his
organisation has done for payments to farmers to manage their
grass-cutting and mowing techniques in a way that gives the bird a
better chance of survival.
The white-tailed eagle has suffered drastically from human persecution
and the small reintroduced population remains vulnerable to illegal
shooting and poisoning. SNH would like to see 20 established pairs by
the year 2003 and wider recolonisation in all suitable areas of
Scotland.
The red kite is internationally threatened, again because of human
persecution. An experimental programme started in 1989 has succeeded in
re-establishing a small population in northern Scotland. By the year
2000, SNH wants to see two Scottish expanding population centres of red
kites.
Marine turtles, and leatherback turtles especially, are now known to
be regular visitors to Scottish waters in summer months. But they are
still harvested for food, leather and shells (the real source of
tortoiseshell), are often caught up by fishermen, and have found that
their nesting and foraging habitats have suffered degradation.
The vendace, or whitefish, has been recorded in only four locations in
Britain -- two in the Lake District and two at Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire
-- but is presumed to have been extinct in Scotland for the past 20-odd
years, making it the only vertebrate known to have been lost from
Scotland in the second part of this century. Sewage effluent, gradual
nutrient enrichment, and the associated increases in populations of
course fish which prey on vendace, are blamed.
Medicinal leeches were used by surgeons for bleeding patients in the
18th century and are still important in medicine for their use in
plastic surgery and the anti-clotting agents which they produce. In the
past, their collection for commercial exploitation may have been part of
the reason for their decline -- now the main threats come from habitat
change.
The only known site of the New Forest burnet moth is a site in western
Argyll, but over-grazing in the 1980s has damaged its habitat of
herb-rich grassland. Fencing off areas to exclude sheep is a possible
solution.
The most famous historical locality for the northern brown argus
butterfly was Arthur's Seat, but it became extinct there in 1869 partly
because of road-building and partly because of excessive collecting by
small boys employed by professional dealers. SNH would like to restore
it to its former kingdom overlooking Edinburgh.
Nearby on the same distinctive landmark grows the sticky catchfly, a
national rarity. Quarrying is blamed for its loss throughout the
country. The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh has successfully
translocated this flower to near where it was first recorded in 1670 at
Holyrood Park.
The Alpine blue sow-thistle is currently restricted to two mountain
blocks in Angus and the eastern Grampians, where it is found in only
four 10km squares of the national grid. It, too, is the victim of
grazing and burning.
The reduction of the Caledonian pine forest is the cause for the
decline in the twinflower, while agricultural and forestry land-use
changes are blamed for the threat to pillwort, a small aquatic fern
relative found at the edges of lowland lochs. Schleicher's thread moss
is known to be located only in an area of a few square metres beside a
burn in moorland near Stirling.
The Scottish primrose, one of our few endemic plants, is found only in
Caithness, Sutherland, and Orkney. As one conservationist said, it would
be politically bad if we lost it.
Some sceptics may question whether we should not simply accept that
the environment changes and some life forms are lost through the process
of evolution.
Professor Usher believes, however, that the issue is whether we
believe there should be a partnership between wildlife and people.
''If there is a partnership between all of the inhabitants of
Scotland, whether it be a squirrel or a person or a Scottish primrose,
then Scotland is the poorer if one of the members of that partnership
disappears,'' he says.

IN its 300 years Bank of Scotland has built up a wealth of experience
in developing products and services to suit every possible kind of
customer needs.
Whether it is savings for seven-year-olds, loans for drivers,
mortgages for newly-weds, or savings plans for retirement, the challenge
is to find the right financial package for the individual customer.
Even services which one might regard as standard -- paying bills,
transferring money and checking balances -- have been raised to a new
level with the pioneering use of technology. It was, after all, Bank of
Scotland which in 1959 became the first British bank to introduce a
computer.
Ten years ago the bank launched another first: HOBS (Home and Office
Banking Service). This links customers via the phone line to the bank's
own computer. The latest enhancement is Screenphone, a telephone which
incorporates a lift-up screen and a foldaway keyboard.
HOBS gives the customer access to all his accounts held with Bank of
Scotland, including credit cards, and displays the details on the
screen.
HOBS opens the bank to personal and business customers 19 hours a day,
from 6am to 1am (midnight at weekends). Payments of bills and transfers
of money can be timed to suit the customer.
Surplus funds can be transferred in and out of special high-interest
investment accounts to increase the return on customers' money.
Customers can view statements as far back as three months and can
instruct payments up to 30 days ahead. Funds remain in the account until
the payment date and this solves the problem of bills which become due
for payment while away on business or on holiday.
Using technology to improve the service to customers is also the
philosophy behind the Transcontinental Automated Payment Service on
TAPS. Three quarters of all state and private pensions paid to Britons
abroad is now handled from the TAPS centre in Glasgow.
The Department of Social Security and more than 300 corporate pension
funds and other organisations use TAPS, avoiding postal delays, lost
cheques and delays for cheques to clear.
The growing range of financial products now available can create the
impression of a ''money maze'' which the customer must navigate.
However, help is at hand. Bank of Scotland has teams of specially
trained financial consultants who can draw up a personal financial
report suited to individual circumstances.
This service is free and totally confidential. Consultations can take
place wherever is suitable to the customer. The bank's financial
services consultants will advise on savings, investments, pensions,
insurance and aspects of financial planning.
Savings needs can alter as individuals' lives change and Bank of
Scotland has accounts ranging from ''Supersavers'' for seven to
12-year-olds, to the Premier Investment Account for those with a little
extra cash who want to see their savings grow.
Other accounts combine the benefits of a traditional current account
with competitive interest rates and a range of additional services
designed to make banking easier.
The bank's Cheque Plus account pays a good rate of interest and offers
a free overdraft of up to #100. The account comes with a Keycard Plus
card which is a combination of Switch, cheque guarantee card and Keycard
for access to the bank's automated cash machines. Customers can also use
their cards with the Link network.
As a vehicle for savings to which customers need less immediate
access, the bank offers a number of products from personal equity plans
(PEPs) to a variety of savings bonds.
General PEPs are managed by the bank and spread the investment across
a portfolio of investment trusts from several different fund managers.
The bank also manages single company PEPs which invest in only one
leading UK company. For the more experienced investor self-select PEPs
leave the destination of the investment to the individual and the bank
follows his or her instructions.
Dividends and tax reclaimed from the Inland Revenue can be paid
directly to the customer's nominated bank.
As well as helping customers to save, the bank can help to make
spending more manageable. Bank of Scotland's Visa Card -- the first
major credit card to be processed in Scotland -- or MasterCard not only
gives customers extra freedom but has a range of ''added extras''.
Each transaction using a Bank of Scotland Visa Card or MasterCard
earns mortgage bonus points which gives up to #600, redeemable when
taking out a new mortgage with the bank. This can go towards paying for
legal fees, valuations, or even the mortgage itself. Mortgage bonus
points can also be transferred to the customer's immediate family. Using
the card to clear outstanding balances on other credit cards will mean
that the bank will reduce the existing balance by up to #60.
The bank's HOMEinSURE policy makes insuring homes and contents easier.
Rather than calculating the cost of possessions, it will automatically
insure the home up to #400,000 and contents up to #75,000. Cover for
contents insurance also includes assurance against legal expenses. Home
and contents insurances are available singly or together, under one
policy.
Other services include help with the will. The bank can act as trustee
and executor, relieving friends and family of that burden, or simply as
trustee, administering on behalf of those chosen to hold these offices.
After 300 years in business, the bank has a long and successful record
of looking after customers' interests from generation to generation.

significant quoted companies and has been involved in all the major
privatisation issues, establishing an excellent track record for service
and accuracy.
As registrar, the bank also provides administration services for
investment trust saving schemes and is now the market leader in the UK.

resolved to step up action against France in protest at its decision to
resume nuclear testing in the Pacific.
The South Pacific and Oceanic Council of Trade Unions at a meeting in
Brisbane pledged more protests outside French embassies and consulates
and interference with French shipping and air services in the region. It
also called for an end to Australian uranium exports to France and for
unions around the world to support opposition to the French nuclear
tests.
* A protester yesterday threw brown liquid he called symbolic blood at
an obelisk in New Mexico marking the site of the first atomic bomb
explosion. The attack on the stone marking the spot called Ground Zero

protester, who was arrested, came from a town near Three Mile Island,
site in 1979 of the worst nuclear plant accident in the US.

THOMAS Watling, a skilled artist and painter from Dumfries who ran a
drawing academy, was arrested in 1788 and charged with forging at least
12 one-guinea notes, a popular target for forgery at the time. He was
found guilty and sentenced to be deported to Botany Bay. The first
professional artist to reach the colony, Watling began to draw the local
wildlife and plants, and made the main visual record of the earliest
decade of British settlement of Australia.
In 1797 he returned home to Dumfries, having been pardoned, and became
art master at the academy at six guineas a year. Perhaps this was not
enough -- for in 1805 he was arrested again for forgery of seven Bank of
Scotland #5 notes. Fortunately for him, the charge was not proven and he
was freed.
Between 1811 and 1814 a series of forgeries of #1 and one-guinea notes
of several banks were discovered. These were traced back to the French
prisoners-of-war held in Edinburgh Castle and in camps at Penicuik. The
forgery was a large-scale effort requiring active co-operation of
outsiders; it was thought that forgeries were commissioned by the guards
in return for favours or improvements to living conditions.

A SCOTSMAN has been chosen as Ireland's International Bachelor of the
Year -- even though he entered the competition only as a last-minute
sbustitute.
MrStuart Elliott, 36, from Annan, near Dumfries, was the toast of the
Mullingar Festival in Ireland at the weekend when he routed a dozen
other contenders from Ireland, England, France and America to claim the
title, plus a #2000 cheque.
Mr Elliott and his rivals had spent the weekend in Mullingar being
assessed by a mainly female jury on their sex appeal, conversation
skills, sense of humour and romantic imagination.
But the 6ft 2in Selkirk rugby forward shouldn't have been there at
all.
He was only drafted in as a late replacement when Scotland's original
standard bearer, Mr Scott Morrison, a healthcare worker in Helensburgh,
asked to be excused amid rumours of romance.
Said Mr Elliott: ''David Taylor, of the Firth Hotel, in Annan, who
organised the Scottish selection, asked me to step in when Scott
couldn't go.
''I'm really chuffed the way things have turned out. When I rang to
tell him I'd won, he called me a jammy so-and-so.''
Mr Elliott, who has his own house in Annan and works as a driver with
British Nuclear Fuels, was a popular winner. ''His kilt made him a big
favourite with the ladies,'' said one festival official. ''His party
piece -- Donald Where's Your Troosers -- brought the house down.''
The winner, who admits to being ''between relationships'', has a
different explanation for his success. ''Early on in the week, I made a
pass at a very attractive woman I met at one of the festival events,''
he confessed. ''She turned out to be one of the judges.''
Half of his #2000 prize goes to charity -- and he has nominated the
Jennifer Hamilton Leukaemia Fund, set up in memory of an Annan girl who
died of the disease.
He is sharing his personal prize money among the nominated charities
of the 11 other contenders.
It was the second time in the six years of the festival that the
bachelor title has gone to a Scot. Mr Gary Robertson, of West Pilton,
Edinburgh, won three years ago, but as an official entry from America
where he worked.
MrElliott won't be returning home in triumph for a few weeks yet. He's
off on holiday to Canada just as soon as he can escape the continuing
celebrations in Mullingar.
''This victory has one big advantage,'' he said. ''Now I'll have to
remain a bachelor, at least until next year's festival.''

SMOKERS who take breaks on the job are working a four-day week,
according to new research.
It is reckoned the equivalent of one day a week goes up in smoke when
workers nip out for a cigarette and a chat.
The research group, Lifestyle at Work, called for a total ban on
smoking at work, and said surveys among workers backed this stance.
Its latest research shows a nine-a-day smoker, who takes an average of
ten minutes on a break, wastes seven-and-a-half hours of company time
every week.
It is estimated to cost British business millions of pounds a year in
lost man hours.
Ms Toni Smith, of Lifestyle at Work, said: ''Employers have got to
realise that smoking is costing them a fortune.
''When smokers have a break they are smoking on company time. And it
makes their colleagues doubly angry.
''They not only have to do extra work, the smoke is killing them at
the same time.''
Smokers, whose immune systems were more vulnerable to colds and
viruses, were also twice as likely to take time off due to illness.
Surveys showed three-quarters of non-smoking workers wanted to close
special smoking rooms and work in completely tobacco-free offices or
factories.
Lifestyle, jointly funded by the Swindon Health Authority and
Thamesdown Council, urged a blanket ban after research found that
special smoking areas at work encouraged smoking breaks.
Ms Smith added: ''It's all about looking after the health and safety
of your staff.
''Employers who provide smoking rooms are paying lip service to health
and giving in to smokers.
''We recommend firms operate complete smoking bans.
''People always say they will go to the loo when that happens. But if
firms make it a disciplinary matter, they won't.''

FOR Gordon Sherry, one of Scotland's most talented young golfers, Bank
of Scotland's tercentenary has given his career a welcome boost. With
the assistance of one of the ''elite'' sports awards which Bank of
Scotland is funding this year as part of its 300th birthday
celebrations, Kilmarnock-based Gordon, 20, can now compete in events to
help him qualify for selection to play for Great Britain and Ireland in
the biennial match against the US for the Walker Cup.
Violinist Rory MacDonald from Milngavie, at 14 the youngest boy in the
National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, this month will attend the
orchestra's week-long 1995 residential training course in Orkney. More
than 100 young musicians gather from as far apart as Selkirk and the
Isle of Skye to receive intensive tuition from professional musicians.
Meeting authors Mary Dickinson and Laurence Anholt on board Bank of
Scotland's ''Book Bus'' was a thrill for youngsters at Sorbie Primary
School in Dumfries. During a five-day whistle-stop tour of the region
the book bus visited nine primary schools, as part of the
''Readiscovery'' year-long campaign to encourage reading and books.
All these young people have benefited from special projects which Bank
of Scotland this year pledged to support as part of its tercentenary
celebrations.
As Hugh Young, general manager and secretary of Bank of Scotland, and
chairman of its tercentenary committee explains: ''When thinking about
how best to celebrate its 300th birthday, the bank decided to allocate
substantial additional financial support for special sponsorships,
events and charitable projects during 1995. These were broadly divided
into four areas -- the community, education, arts, and sport -- with a
particular emphasis on projects which help young people. As the bank's
governor has said, our aim is to 'put something back from whence it
came' and support activities which otherwise might not happen during
1995.''
Less able and disadvantaged people are also receiving the benefit of
funding: a series of concerts by the Council for Music in Hospitals, and
provision of a specially adapted vehicle to transport disabled visitors
from the foot of the esplanade into Edinburgh Castle, are but two
examples. Funding for other charitable projects is being allocated
throughout the year.
Tercentenary support has embraced projects large and small -- from
funding Glasgow School of Art's Challenge of Age project which aims to
design and manufacture furniture for elderly people in care, to
sponsoring an Ayrshire Hospice fun day at Ayr Racecourse.
As well as helping to preserve Scotland's cultural heritage,
tercentenary finance is also enabling more people to enjoy the country's
natural heritage by supporting improvements to the environment.
Iain Fiddes, the bank's director of marketing services and public
relations, cites an example: ''In September more than 400 people will
take part in the biggest conservation event for volunteers in the West
of Scotland. Bank of Scotland's Community Volunteer Day on the shores of
Loch Lomond has been organised by Scottish Conservation Project Trust
with the aim of encouraging responsible use of the countryside.''
Bringing Scottish history to life has become another hallmark of Bank
of Scotland's tercentenary, with the commissioning from Edinburgh's
Dovecote Studio of a specially designed tapestry in the form of a
triptych. Each of the three sections details the development of the bank
and its subsidiaries over 300 years. An illustrated history, entitled A
Very Singular Institution, written by Alan Cameron, Bank of Scotland's
archivist, describes the bank's sometimes turbulent story.
In the tercentenary celebrations, devotees of the arts have not been
forgotten. By supporting three separate tours during June by the
Scottish Ballet Touring Company as well as a new production of Swan Lake
by Scottish Ballet, the bank brought the delights of dance not only to
Scottish cities but also to many towns such as Cumbernauld, Irvine and
Oban. Scottish Opera's The Marriage of Figaro has also given pleasure to
audiences in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Newcastle.
Many of the bank's sponsorships for sport cover the length and breadth
of the country. All 480 secondary schools in the country have been asked
to participate in a tercentenary sports quiz organised by the Scottish
Association of Local Sports Councils; heats for this will take place in
the autumn. Earlier this month a Champion of Champions tennis tournament
was held in Craiglockhart, Edinburgh, and 120 SLTA club teams took part.
Teams from Japan, Canada, and the US participated in the Bank of
Scotland World Junior Curling Championships held in Perth in March. The
bank has been involved in sponsoring Scottish junior curling for more
than 20 years.
As ''The Bank for Youth Sport'', Bank of Scotland is also involved in
sponsorships of the Scottish Young Bowlers Championships and the
Scottish Cricket Union Youth Competition, the finals of both of which
take place next month; rugby union camps and skills schools around the
country; and of hockey, football, netball, golf and squash championships
for young people.
Hugh Young concludes: ''Large or small, local or national, the
multitude of projects which Bank of Scotland is this year supporting
have one thing in common: each is a way of saying ''thank you'' -- to
customers, staff and the public at large -- for the loyalty and goodwill
the bank has enjoyed over the past three centuries -- and, of course,
hopes to enjoy for 300 years more.''

Martin Sime explains why charities are double losers in the National
Lottery game and highlights the irony of low-income groups buying most
tickets but receiving least benefits
IT is only just beginning to dawn on many charity fundraisers that the
free market cuts both ways. In the past they simply had to compete with
other charities for public affection and coins in the collecting tin.
The National Lottery has put paid to all of that in spectacular style.
Not only does it sweep up millions of pounds of small change through
scratch cards and big-money games, with press and TV coverage to match,
but it has the effrontery to suggest that it's all for a good cause.
At first sight this seems to be a case for the Advertising Standards
Authority. We can debate the relative merits of the Churchill family's
#12m jackpot (if anyone agrees with it). But few can argue that the
Government, which is expected to receive a #300m tax windfall from its
12p in the #1, is commonly understood to be a good cause. Nor do the
shareholders of the Camelot consortium, themselves receiving handsome
prizes from the large profits now being generated, come into the
category of the deserving poor.
Aside from the odd lucky sod at 14 million to one, these are the real
and lasting winners. Charities are the real losers. In cash terms,
charities will receive just over 5p in every #1 spent -- this year some
#15m will be recycled in Scotland by the National Lottery Charities
Board. But a drop in fundraising income brought about by competition and
the public's mistaken belief that buying lottery tickets helps
charities, means losses will outstrip income by over 25%.
The first evidence also suggests the more successful the lottery is,
the greater the loss to charities. In other words, every time you buy a
ticket a real good cause will lose.
To be beaten by a monopoly is bad enough, but charities are double
losers in the lottery game. Freely donated income is the prize
possession of all charities. It brings the freedom and independence
needed to make their own choices on priorities -- they don't have to ask
anyone's permission.
The lottery money coming back through the charities board, however,
requires competition for activity-based proposals which are assessed and
decided upon by a Government-appointed quango. However well-meaning
these individuals are -- and in Scotland we can be pleased with the
start they have made -- decision-making powers are being taken away from
charities and centralised in the hands of a few people chosen by the
Secretary of State.
The extent of voluntary-sector activity in Scotland is quite
remarkable. Over 25,000 organisations, mobilising millions of volunteers
and active across the entire range of public life -- from working with
Aids sufferers to protecting the environment.
As the state has retreated through a succession of privatisations and
public-expenditure cutbacks, so charities and other voluntary groups
have sought new ways to resource the needs of the people they work to
support. As poverty, unemployment, and pollution have increased, so the
tasks facing Scottish charities have expanded to the point where they
can never do too much.
The Scottish voluntary sector raises over #2000m each year -- over
half from public donations -- and directly employs some 40,000 people.
Such a major industry cannot simply sit back and watch its funds and
independence ebbing away. Charities must find ways of fighting back.
Our first task must be to avoid shooting the messenger -- neither
Camelot nor the charities board is to blame for the lottery legislation.
One is strictly commercial -- it seeks to raise as much money as
possible. The other is in the business of giving a small proportion of
it away to maximum effect. The Government gets more than twice the sum
coming to charity and needs to be persuaded to part with more rather
than less money to charity. After all, it was warned well in advance of
the likely impact.
Charities must also do more to educate the public -- if you want 30
seconds of fun on a Saturday night, buy a lottery ticket. If you want to
support a charity of your choice there are lots of ways to do so (and
buying a lottery ticket isn't one). In fact, while donations may be the
lifeblood of charity, much more needs to be done to promote planned and
tax-effective giving. Putting #1 into the collecting tin isn't the best
way to help charity -- Give As You Earn, charity cards or covenants get
the tax you've paid back to charities as well.
Thirdly, and against the habits of a lifetime, charities need to get
their acts together on the fundraising front. Trail-blazers like the Big
Hearted Scotland consortium really are the future if the sector is going
to preserve and develop its fundraising base in the face of the National
Lottery.
We may not be able to compete directly with the size and scale of the
lottery, but we have some pretty potent images of the problems we work
with and strong networks of supporters in every community in Scotland
who can be harnessed to get our message across.
Finally, once we've spent our millions on daft ideas to celebrate the
millennium, charities should lobby Government to redistribute its 12p
back to the charities board. Only then will we be just about even for
the whole exercise.
Scots feel rightly ambivalent about the necessity of charity. But many
low-income families and people who have disabilities rely on voluntary
agencies for housing, training for employment, playgroups, advice
services, and the rest. It would be tremendous irony if such groups were
wiped out by a National Lottery which played Robin Hood in reverse. Low
income groups buying most tickets and receiving least benefit are
entitled of a Saturday night to ask ''why isn't it us?''

Charities

THE month from hell for the Clinton administration opens this week.
The Republicans in Congress are in full cry after the president. A
Senate committee opens hearings on the Whitewater affair and a House
committee is investigating the Waco siege, just as four years of
American indecision and vacillation over Bosnia comes to a head.
The Whitewater hearings are being led by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, one
of the nastiest and certainly the most strident of Republican senators.
The fact that his own ethics have been the subject of much debate
deters him not in the least.
His object is to nail the president, to prove that there is something
rotten in the state of Arkansas. The hearings will begin with yet
another trampling of the corpse of Vincent Foster, a close friend of the
Clintons who shot himself two years ago.
Two earlier investigations have found that Mr Foster was depressed by
the strains of Washington, particularly by the row over a minor scandal
involving the White House press office. The president's opponents want
to prove that the handling of the suicide was improper, in particular
that some White House officials removed papers from his office without
telling the police.
Those papers concerned Whitewater, the Arkansas land deal that has
haunted Mr Clinton for three years. The White House has released what it
claims are all the documents, and they do not appear to reveal anything
new or incriminating, but this will not stop the Republicans from
asserting the contrary.
At the same time, conspiracy theorists, including the Sunday Telegraph
and Lord Rees Mogg, former editor of The Times, have plunged down the
deepest recesses of fantasy and absurdity, alleging that Foster was
murdered and that the murder was instigated, or at least covered up by,
the president.
On the other side of the Hill, the House is looking into Waco, where
86 people were killed when the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and
Firearms (BATF) stormed the Branch Davidians' compound on April 19,
1993. Some Americans were allegedly so enraged by the episode that they
blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City two years later.
The charge is that the BATF, and other federal law-enforcement
agencies, exceed their constitutional authority. The National Rifle
Association and the Republican far right accuse the feds of being
''jack-booted thugs'' and suspect them of wanting to take away citizens'
arms.
The paradox is that the strong law-and-order wing of the same party
wants the police to use the utmost force against criminals and drug
dealers. The ''rules of engagement'' which allowed the BATF to act so
irresponsibly in Waco, and a year earlier in the siege of a white
supremacist in Idaho, were drawn up to deal with urban crime -- which is
perceived as a Democratic phenomenon.
At any event, the House hearings will be aimed at the
attorney-general, Janet Reno, and through her at the president. Outside,
the temperature has hit 100F. It will be just as hot inside.

A SCOTS nun, whose work in an Osaka orphanage following the Second
World War inspired a Hollywood film, has returned to Japan for the
institution's 50th anniversary celebrations.
Sister Genevieve McBride, 88, who saved the lives of many youngsters
in her 17 years at the Holy Family Home, has featured on TV programmes
and had tribute paid to her work by former ophans, fellow nuns,
churchmen, civic leaders, and soldiers.
Sister Genevieve, who lives in a Dumfries convent, went to the home in
1947 and found a desperate shortage of food, clothes, and medicine, and
accommodation so primitive that the children had frostbite and were
bitten by rats.
Then the Blantyre-born nun, a member of the Sisters of Charity, met US
Army Sergeant Hugh O'Reilly who was so impressed by her dedication and
sacrifice that he persuaded his unit, the 27th Infantry Regiment -- the
Wolfhounds -- to adopt the ophanage.
Soon every company was contributing regularly and one million yen was
raised to build a new building. The link between the regiment and the
home has continued to this day and over the years the soldiers have
contributed #1.5m.
At the main celebration in the home, Sister Genevieve -- an honorary
Wolfhound -- was reunited with Mr O'Reilly and his Japanese wife, Yuko.
The couple live in Hawaii where the regiment is based.
The guests watched the 1955 film, The Gentle Sergeant, made by
Columbia Pictures and starring Aldo Ray as O'Reilly and Camilla
Janclaire as Sister Genevieve. The sister herself had a small role as
one of the other nuns.
The movie tells how the war-hardened sergeant, who had no love for the
Japanese, is won over by the Scottish sister and falls for Yuko, an
interpreter with his unit.
Mr O'Reilly, 81, a father of six, said: ''Sister Genevieve made so
many sacrifices and worked so hard for the children, so far from her own
country, that she inspired me.''
Sister Genevieve, who became director of the home, said: ''O'Reilly's
kindness, love, and concern won all hearts. Before the children knew his
name, they referred to him as 'The Gentle Sergeant' which gave the film
its name. I will be grateful all my life for what he and his regiment
did for the children. It is wonderful to meet the former orphans and see
how well they have done in life.''
* The Queen Mother, who will be 95 next month, will play only a minor
role in next month's royal VJ-Day commemorations, details of which will
be announced by Buckingham Palace tomorrow.
She has decided not to interrupt her annual holiday in the Castle of
Mey, Caithness, for the commemorations in London on August 19 and 20.
However, she will attend some Scottish engagements.

although perhaps ''canny'' would be a better translation. As a result
the Bank of Scotland's Scottish Account in Germany (Schottenkonto) is

PRESIDENT Jacques Chirac turned one of the darkest pages of French
history today by recognising that the French state shared responsibility
for deporting Jews to Nazi death camps during the Second World War.
''Yes, the criminal folly of the (German) occupier was assisted by
French people, by the French state,'' Chirac said in a speech at a
ceremony commemorating the 1942 round-up of Paris Jews by the
collaborationist Vichy regime's police.
''These dark hours tarnish forever our history and are an insult to
our past and our traditions,'' he declared.
It was the first time a post-war French head of state had fully
acknowledged France's role.
In a clear warning against the extreme-right National Front, Chirac
also urged vigilance against attempts by some political parties to
promote a racist, anti-Semitic ideology.
His statement broke with the line of his predecessor, Francois
Mitterrand, who insisted that the French republic could not be held to
account for Vichy's crimes and owed the Jews no apology.
On July 16, 1942, French police and gendarmes rounded up about 13,000
Jews in the French capital in response to demands from the German
occupation authorities.
The Jews were crammed in appalling conditions into the Vel d'Hiv
indoor cycling stadium before being interned and deported to the
Auschwitz extermination camp. Most never returned. Altogether 76,000
Jews deported from France were killed.
''France, the homeland of the Enlightenment and of human rights, a
land of welcome and asylum, on that day committed the irreparable.
Breaking its word, it handed over those under its protection to their
murderers,'' Chirac said.
''Recognising the errors of the past, recognising the errors committed
by the state, masking nothing of the dark hours of our history, is quite
simply a way to defend the idea of man's freedom and dignity.''
Nazi-hunting lawyer Serge Klarsfeld, veteran leader of the association
of children of deported French Jews, called Chirac's statement a
courageous step forward.
''All Jewish people and all those who fought the Nazis must have been
delighted to hear these words,'' said Jean Kahn, president of the
European Jewish Congress.--Reuter.

At the cutting edge: KENNEDY WILSON sheds light on the forgotten women
of the Second World War who did a man's job for their country
A NEW television documentary is to look at an almost forgotten aspect
of the women's war effort in Scotland. While the Land Girls were famed
for their work on the farms, the less well-known Women's Timber Corps
(founded in 1942) produced vast amounts of much-needed wood for
everything from railway sleepers to telegraph poles. These female
lumberjacks were known as the ''lumberjills''.
Former BBC Scotland weather reporter Vanessa Collingridge has produced
an item on the lumberjills for Channel 4's First Sex series, which will
be screened on Wednesday.
''I first got interested in the subject when I read an obituary of one
lumberjill, Janet Brown,'' says Collingridge. ''The word lumberjill just
jumped out at me. It was something I knew nothing about and as I'm
interested in womens' social history I decided to find out more. It
seemed incredible that there were these women swinging seven-pound axes
around their heads and doing the hardest manual labour.''
After some research Collingridge eventually found a woman called
Bonnie Macadam who had organised a big lumberjills' reunion in 1990.
Through Macadam, Collingridge was able to meet many other lumberjills.
Now, she is organising a book of some of the memories of these
remarkable women, ensuring that this vital part of the history of women
and the Second World War will not be lost forever.
In its first year alone 1000 Scottish women joined the Women's Timber
Corps. Women from all walks of life decided to do their bit for the war
effort and travelled away from home, often for the first time, to live
and work in the most rudimentary conditions.
The camps had huts with wooden beds and concrete floors, and in winter
the women couldn't pick up cutlery because it was so cold it stuck to
their fingers. They had to contend with a gruelling four weeks of basic
training during which their muscles hardened up and their hands became
coarsened.
Timber was important because it was used for railway sleepers at a
time when trains were a vital link for moving troops and munitions.
Timber was also used for the props in coal mines and for telegraph poles
-- many of which were shipped out to Africa for the desert campaigns.
Back in 1944, one embittered woman told the Weekly News: ''We live at
the back of beyond, felling trees in the coldest weather and there is no
glamour attached to our job. We are always hearing about the ATS, Waafs,
and Wrens, but no-one ever mentions the lumberjills.''
The lumberjills were proud of the work they did, and prouder still
when some camps announced higher productivity levels than the male
camps. Why was the work of these women so neglected both then, and now?
Their rural workplaces, says Collingridge, condemned them to anonymity.
''They were out of sight and out of mind, often miles away from the
nearest village, and although they might have been inspired by the great
outdoors they soon found that it was damned hard work.''
Apart from that, the women had to contend not only with the weather,
but with peat bog and mire, 10-hour days and swarms of midges.
Many of the women did not like to tell their families that they were
out in the wilderness chopping down trees. Many of their mothers and
fathers might not have believed them -- these women were not beefy,
big-boned girls but often petite, ordinary women. ''One woman told me
that she received frilly underwear from her parents when what she really
needed was a pair of stout boots and dungarees,'' says Collingridge.
Although many women couldn't take the punishing regime and dropped
out, others enjoyed their new life and their new freedom. Often they
described their war work as the most wonderful time in their lives, and
many made long-standing friendships with their compatriots.
''The camaraderie was very important. Some of these women were only 17
and had never left home before, and there they were in a community of
women which was an incredibly supportive environment,'' says
Collingridge.
With no radio or gramophone they often had to make their own
entertainment. Lucky ones had male lumberjacks from Canada to keep them
company. Romances blossomed and after the Corps was disbanded in 1946
many of the women emigrated with new husbands.
''The lumberjills had the satisfaction of knowing they could do a
man's job and they broke down so many barriers. It was also very
difficult to go back to their so-called ordinary lives after the war. It
changed them, changed their children. And they helped the path of young
women's progress today,'' says Collingridge.
In their isolated surroundings in all parts of Scotland, from Ayrshire
to the Highlands, the women found that there was no point in falling out
with each other, and they learned to survive. ''There was a lot of
making do and putting up with things back then and many of the young
lumberjills didn't question it. They were young and inexperienced and it
was all part of the war effort. They were working towards a larger
goal.''

<HEADLINE>Scots get lottery's charity message. Poll underlines public confusion over who benefits</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>RON MACKENNA</BYLINE>

SCOTS are waking up to the fact that taking part in the National
Lottery is not going to benefit charities substantially, according to a
new study.
However, most people still grossly overestimate the amount that goes
to deserving causes, says the Scottish Council for Voluntary Services.
As pressure grows on the lottery organisers, Camelot, and the
Government over the undesirable spin-offs of Britain's new gambling
craze, the respected housing charity, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation,
warned in a separate attack that the lottery could be fuelling a major
problem of gambling addiction among Britain's youth.
The Rowntree report, by author Luke FitzHerbert, recommends that
Camelot should switch the screening of the lottery draw to a later slot
so that fewer young people watch it, and ban instant-win scratch cards
to stem a potential gambling epidemic among the young.
It also warned that the Government is in danger of losing public
sympathy if such a high percentage of the money raised continues to be
distributed to the rich.
However, the new National Heritage Secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
said that the distribution system would be kept under review, but ruled
out any action to limit people's opportunity to have a ''harmless
flutter'' on the lottery.
Across the UK, Scots are the most realistic about just who benefits
from a gamble on the lottery, but almost half were wrong about how much
charities receive.
The NOP survey, commissioned by the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Services, shows that, although many people are getting the message of
what goes where, confusion still reigns.
In March, two-thirds of the Scottish population thought that buying a
lottery ticket was a good way to donate to charities. That figure has
now fallen to 44% with the UK average at 56%, said the SCVS.
Alarmingly, say the organisation, the average view is that 22p in the
pound goes to charity, whereas the real figure is less than 6p.
Mr Martin Sime, SCVO director, said the latest results were mixed.
''We're pleased people are finally getting the message, but the fact
that most still believe 22p in the pound goes to charities shows much
has to be done to counter false beliefs, in some cases encouraged by
lottery advertising.''
Mr Sime said that the lottery had generated an annual tax windfall of
#500m for the Government. ''Charities are still likely to be net losers
from the lottery. Government needs to act quickly to compensate
charities before jobs and services to vulnerable people are lost.''
Mr Alan Twigg, Camelot's Scottish spokesman, said the company would
dispute any claims that they had misled people. ''We don't think anyone
in the lottery has misled anyone. So far, an awful lot of money has gone
to five good causes, of which charities are one. That has always been
made clear.
''There are a lot of charities that are going to do extremely well out
of the lottery, although there will be some casualties.''
Mr Graham Bowie, of the National Lotteries Charity Board in Scotland,
said the first tranche of Scottish charity money, around #15m, would be
distributed in October or November.
''The first tranche is to help people in poverty. If what the SCVO is
saying is correct, it reinforces the importance of doing our job
properly.''
Meanwhile, Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith said that a Labour
government would aim to cut the profits of Camelot to give more money to
good causes.
Describing the running of the lottery as ''money for old rope'', he
added that it should go to a non-profit-making organisation when
Camelot's seven-year contract expires.
He tells Granada's World in Action tonight that the money being made
by Camelot's directors is ''astonishing''.
Camelot communications director David Rigg responds: ''I deal with
governments when they are in power. The Labour Party is entirely
entitled to take whatever view it feels is appropriate at this stage and
when it comes to power, if it comes to power, doubtless it will carry
out its own careful study.
''If Parliament had set it up some other way and asked a bunch of
civil servants to get it off the ground with such success then we would
have watched with great interest, wouldn't we?''
* Four ticket-holders are today celebrating #2.8m wins on the lottery.
Camelot believed that the #11m jackpot was shared between four winning
tickets -- although it is not known whether they are held by syndicates
or single punters.
The numbers were 1, 4, 20, 31, 41 and 43. Seven people each won
#492,996 for matching five numbers and the bonus ball, number 38.

TWO Americans jailed in Iraq after wandering across the border from
Kuwait were released today after President Saddam Hussein pardoned them.
''What a great day,'' said a smiling William Barloon as he stood on
the steps of a Baghdad hotel with his fellow prisoner, David Daliberti,
and the US Congressman who secured their release, Bill Richardson.
He thanked Richardson for ''coming and getting us''.
''These two are fine young men who tonight will be going home to their
families,'' declared a beaming Richardson.
Barloon's wife Linda, who is in Singapore, said her husband was in
high spirits. The time and place of their reunion had to be decided
later.
The men looked healthy after leaving Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison.
Earlier they were reported to be in poor health.
The Americans, who work for US defence contractors, were arrested
inside Iraq on March 13 on a trip to visit friends among UN military
observers in the border's demilitarised zone.
An Iraqi court sentenced them to eight years imprisonment on March 25
for illegal entry.
Saddam pardoned them today and ordered that they be released
immediately.
Barloon, 30, of New Hampton, Iowa, and Daliberti, 41, of Jacksonville,
Florida, walked from the prison to the US embassy compound.
They will leave Iraq tomorrow with Richardson, who would not say
whether any concessions were made during his meeting with Saddam.
In Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the two
Americans celebrated with pizza and champagne.
He added however that their release would not lead to the lifting of
US sanctions against Iraq.
''This is totally unconnected,'' he said.
Asked about Saddam's motives, Christopher said: ''Perhaps he was
trying to court some international favour.''--Reuter.

<TEXT>
SWISS banks are breaching their traditional secrecy to answer claims
that they hold huge assets left by Jews murdered in the Holocaust, but
say the chances of finding lost fortunes are slim.
Breaking their traditional silence over accounts and customers, the
powerful banks reject speculation that they profited from billions of
pounds allegedly left ownerless since the Second World War.
''I am sure it will be a big disappointment for people who think we
are sitting on a pile of somebody else's gold bars,'' said one banker.
However the banks, accused by some Jewish groups of making it hard for
rightful heirs to find lost accounts, have pledged to speed up searches
for a few so-called ''ownerless'' accounts that they say may still
exist.
''We owe it to the victims of the Holocaust to pursue this issue with
the greatest care,'' says Heinrich Schneider, deputy director of the
Swiss Bankers' Association.
A poll of the three biggest Swiss banks found officials sceptical
about finding many ownerless Holocaust accounts.
''We cannot rule out the possibility of accounts still being left from
Holocaust victims, but there is no indication that large assets are
involved,'' said Michael Willi of the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Franz Raggenbass of the biggest Swiss bank, UBS, said it was searching
its records for accounts left by murdered Jews but added: ''We expect it
would be a very, very small number, certainly fewer than 100 accounts.''
However the head of the Federation of Swiss Jewish Communities, Rolf
Bloch, says between 1000 and 2000 Jewish heirs have in recent years been
seeking information about possible lost accounts.
The bankers' association last week pledged to help the heirs of
Holocaust victims by setting up a central office to ease inquiries about
lost accounts, which now have to be made at each of the country's
roughly 500 banks.--Reuter

<TEXT>
DEPUTY Defence Minister Mordechai Gur, who as a general captured
Jerusalem's Temple Mount for Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, killed
himself today. He had suffered from cancer for years.
Police said his family had found Gur, 65, in the garden of his Tel
Aviv home with one gunshot to the head, his pistol beside him, and a
note in which he wrote of suffering from cancer.
Israeli radio stations said that in the note Gur said he no longer
wanted to be a burden to his family.
A tearful Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Gur's comrade-in-arms and his
partner in politics for nearly half a century, stood in silence in
memory of Gur with the rest of the Israeli Cabinet at the start of their
weekly meeting.
Born in Jerusalem, Gur -- known by his nickname ''Motta'' -- began his
military career before the state was founded in 1948. He was Israel's
10th army chief from 1974-78, including during the 1976 Entebbe hostages
rescue.
However he was perhaps best remembered for having commanded the
Israeli paratroopers who during the 1967 war captured Jerusalem's Old
City and with it Judaism's biblical Temple Mount, including the Wailing
Wall around it.
Israelis were euphoric that after nearly 2000 years their holiest site
was again under Jewish rule.
News of Gur's suicide shocked Israelis, and pushed aside reports on
peace moves with Syria and the PLO.
Libya, however, gloated over the news. In a report by the official
news agency Jana referring to Gur only as the ''terrorist'', it
suggested he was the victim of despair in the Israeli military.--Reuter.

THE killer heatwave that has scorched much of the US Midwest today
left Chicago's mortuary overflowing with bodies and refrigerated lorries
were called in to store corpses.
The toll from the five-day heatwave, in which temperatures in Chicago
climbed to a record 106F (41C), is expected to top 100.
City medical examiner Edmond Donahue said the prolonged high
temperatures had created a slow-motion disaster, surpassing even
large-scale accidents such as plane crashes.
Many victims were elderly, but some were children, including two boys
who died yesterday after being left in a locked vehicle for an hour by
their babysitter.
The official heat-related death toll in the Chicago area reached 60
today, but there were still 113 bodies awaiting post-mortem examination.
In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the medical examiner received 84 bodies in 36
hours, compared to a normal influx of eight bodies a day.
At least three people died in the US capital Washington as heat and
steamy humidity kept tourists and residents off the streets.
Weather forecasters said temperatures would begin to fall to the 90s
tomorrow in the Midwest and along the east coast.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>People of Zepa send cry for help</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977354968</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
RESIDENTS of the Serb-besieged Bosnian enclave of Zepa urged the
United Nations today to help government forces trying to defend the
town.
''The people of Zepa want the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina to ask
the (UN) Security Council if Zepa is still a 'safe area', and if so who
is protecting it?'' asked a letter from town officials, broadcast over
state radio.
''The Serb offensive against us has been going on for eight days,''
the letter continued. ''We have 17,000 people here who have been joined
by 6000-8000 refugees already expelled from Srebrenica.''
UN officials said earlier that Bosnian Serb infantry backed by tanks
had advanced to within a mile of Zepa town.
The remote enclave in eastern Bosnia is one of six so-called ''safe
areas'' taken under the protection of the UN Security Council in 1993 in
an effort to prevent Serb forces from overrunning them.
Srebrenica, also a ''safe area'', fell to Serb troops last week as
Dutch UN troops looked on helplessly.
Zepa's lightly-armed contingent of 79 Ukrainian UN soldiers has been
unable to halt the Serb advance.
The letter said the Ukrainians would share the fate of Zepa's people.
''We shall either live or die together,'' it said. ''Our soldiers will
sell their lives for a high price.''
Meanwhile, it emerged that some of the thousands of Muslims missing
after the fall of Srebrenica had escaped on foot and were nearing
Bosnian Government territory.
''Mostly it's able-bodied men but with them are some wounded and a
smaller group of women, children, and elderly,'' said a government
official in Tuzla.
Most of Srebrenica's estimated 40,000 residents are bottled up in the
town of Potocari, within the east Bosnian Muslim enclave.
''This group did not go to Potocari because the consequences would
have been serious,'' said the official. ''They went to the woods to try
to make it out on their own.''
Serb troops expelled more than 23,000 women, children, and elderly
from the area, sending them to the government-held town of Tuzla, and
detained another 4000 men. The United Nations has demanded immediate
information on those taken prisoner.
The whereabouts of the missing thousands of Srebrenica residents has
been a mystery. Some UN officials have speculated that the original
population may have been over-estimated.
Bosnian Government sources said the first batch of those who escaped
was expected to arrive in the Sapna area east of Tuzla tonight.
''This group was followed by Serbs but the Serbs had a hard time
attacking them because they were so well armed,'' said a government
source.
''The large group was ambushed and broke down into smaller groups, but
may have been able to reunite. We were in radio contact with them until
earlier today.''
Earlier, the Bosnian Serbs agreed in principle to give the Red Cross
access to Muslims taken prisoner in the capture of Srebrenica, but not
for the time being.
Aid workers are extremely concerned about the fate of as many as
several thousand Muslim men separated from their families and detained
by the Serbs last week.
The men were believed to have been taken to the nearby Serb-held town
of Bratunac, and some refugees claimed they saw rows of bodies by the
roadside.
UN relief workers say privately that delays could give the Serbs more
time to cover up atrocities described by refugees who were expelled from
Srebrenica and reached government territory.
''It is a top priority for us to get access to the detainees,'' said
Red Cross official Josue Anselmo.
Meanwhile, four lorry-loads of food aid from Scotland will be
delivered to refugee-swollen Tuzla in the next two days.
A convoy from Edinburgh Direct Aid is making the run across Bosnia
from the port of Split.
EDA deputy chairman Dr Jeanne Bell said: ''Our 10 workers out there
will face some pretty horrific sights, but Edinburgh Direct Aid is in
business to help people in desperate circumstances.''
Her husband Denis Rutovitz, who is leading the convoy, was shot in the
shoulder earlier this year by a Serb sniper on the road into Sarajevo.

GRANDMOTHER Mrs Ann Rollinson thought her bottle feeding worries were
behind her but the latest addition to her family really is a little
monkey.
Mrs Rollinson and her husband, Gordon, keep marmosets at their home in
Oban and two, Jack and Elsa, have just given birth to three babies.
Unfortunately, marmosets will only look after two babies at a time and
the runt of the litter, Rocky, was abandoned on the floor of their cage
while his sisters, Poppy and Penny, were being suckled by their mum.
Now Mr and Mrs Rollinson are taking turns at feeding Rocky from a tiny
pipette with human baby milk every two hours. Mrs Rollinson, 53, said:
''I've got three children and they were a lot less trouble. At least
they were only fed every four hours and sometimes they slept all
night.''
Rocky is now 25 grammes and gaining weight but it will be weeks before
he can go on an ordinary diet of fruit, vegetables, and live locusts.
Normally, he would cling to his mother's back to sleep but, because
she has rejected him, he has to make do with a cuddly toy and has been
isolated in a plant propogator.
Mrs Rollinson said: ''Marmosets traditionally will only take on two
babies at a time. Rocky would just have been left to die but we
discovered him in time and took the job on ourselves. It is a lot of
work and no sleep but it is worth it.
''As he gets older, we will introduce him into the colony and
hopefully his mum and sisters will accept him.''

<HEADLINE>Trump hits out at 'sleazy' Selina Scott after TV interview</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977354971</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION personality Selina Scott and tycoon Donald Trump traded
personal insults yesterday in a furious row over her celebrity interview
with him shown on ITV last month.
The billionaire American property developer branded her ''very
sleazy'', ''unattractive'', ''obnoxious'' and ''boring'' in letters to
her and to King Constantine of Greece, said to have acted as a
go-between.
Dismissing Scott as having ''little talent'' and her questions as
''foolish'', Trump called her ''deceptive and dishonest'' and claimed
she had ''cried and begged'' for him to re-do the interview.
But the 43-year-old presenter, once voted TV's sexiest woman, hit
back, saying: ''If you've got an ego as big as the Empire State
Building, you're liable to get upset if someone dents it.''
0 In his letter to Scott, Trump wrote: ''Up until last spring I had
never heard of you -- and then I received a phone call from 'King
Constantine', formerly of Greece.
''While I had never met nor spoken to him before, I acceded to his
wish when he came to my office and asked that I see you for an
interview.''
The king was ''very insistent, in an extremely nice way,'' that he
should do the programme, Selina Scott Meets Donald Trump.
He continues: ''As most people know, you are not a first class
reporter. The interview and questions were boring and foolish, but I
nevertheless finished.
''I did mention to you that you were both deceptive and dishonest. I
was not 'ranting and raving' when I spoke to you as was reported; rather
I was more disgusted than anything else.''
He assumed she would return to London and do a ''hatchet job'' on him,
he said.
''Instead, about 6pm the same evening, I received a pathetic telephone
call from you telling me that the film had 'cancelled' and would either
not show color, not pick up sound, or maybe not show at all. The camera
your staff was using was defective.
''You cried and begged that I re-do the interview. This was very
inconvenient for me as I was preparing to receive guests for an
important dinner party that night. I nevertheless felt sorry for you in
that you are obviously a woman who has seen better days.''
The letter continues: ''When the piece aired, I saw that it was edited
in such a manner as to be outright false. To show how nasty you are,
despite my having loused up an evening by helping you to get out of your
own mistake relative to a defective camera, the piece was mean-spirited,
snide and in many respects, totally inaccurate.''
He added: ''Selina, you have little talent and, from what I have seen,
even fewer viewers. You are no longer 'hot'; perhaps that is the curse
of dishonesty. You would, obviously, go to any lengths to try to restore
your faded image, but guess what -- the public is aware and apparently
much brighter than you. They aren't tuning in!
''I hope you are able to solve your problems before it is too late.''
He wrote to King Constantine: ''I know it was not willingly or with
knowledge, but you did me no favours by asking me to do an interview
with a very sleazy and unattractive Selina Scott.
''She misrepresented much of the information that I gave her and tried
very hard to make me look as foolish as possible.
''Again, I know that you were well intentioned, so in effect she
stabbed you in the back just as she did me.''
Scott, who has just clinched a reported #200,000 deal to present her
own chat show on NBC Super Channel, said: ''I was very pleased with the
programme. I thought it was a fair portrait of the man, though I didn't
pull any punches. I admit that I was a little mischievous -- and I can
understand his reaction.
''I did actually send him the reviews when they appeared -- but I
haven't heard a word from him.''
The letter to her is due to arrive today, although it was leaked to
the media earlier.
A spokesman for Grampian Television said: ''What we tried to do was
give the British public the opportunity to draw their own conclusions of
Donald Trump, who is a most remarkable person.
''These comments give the British public further insight into his
character.''
The row comes as a surprise after it was reported that Trump was
''absolutely knocked sideways'' by Scott when they met.
One report quoted a source who worked on the programme as saying: ''He
kept taking her out to parties, looking dewy-eyed and saying, 'May I
introduce the legendary Selina Scott from Europe?'''
But Scott was said to have ''hated the way he was always brushing his
hair'', the story said.

INDIAN officials today dismissed the chances of jailed Kashmiri
militants being freed in exchange for five Western hostages, including
two Britons, whom their kidnappers have threatened to kill tomorrow.
The officials believed the little-known Al Faran group holding the
five men in the Himalayas were Afghan guerrillas who had joined the
fight against Indian rule.
Al Faran is holding Britons Paul Wells, 23, of London, and Keith
Mangan, 33, of Middlesbrough, Cleveland, along with an American, a
German, and a Norwegian.
New photographs of the five hostages were released by the kidnappers
today, showing them against a backdrop of a glacier and pine trees.
The kidnappers say they will kill them if India does not release 20
jailed Kashmiris.
''There is no thinking, and there is not likely to be one, that we
should strike deals with foreign mercenaries,'' a senior New Delhi
official said.
Contact with the group was finally established today after several
failed attempts, opening the way for possible negotiations, police said.

<HEADLINE>Transfer of terrorists to Ireland demanded.  Two IRA men in prison 'dirty protest'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977354973</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO IRA prisoners have started a ''dirty protest'' at Whitemoor
Prison, scene of an armed breakout by members of the terrorist group
last year, it was confirmed yesterday.
The pair have spread excrement on cell walls and are wearing only
blankets, said the Prison Service.
''The two have been removed from the main area into a segregation unit
to keep them apart from other prisoners,'' said a spokeswoman.
It is understood the two are Feilim O'Hadhmaill, 36, a former lecturer
at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston, who was jailed for 25
years last November for conspiracy to cause explosions, and Patrick
Kelly, 42, jailed for 25 years in 1993 for conspiracy to cause an
explosion and the attempted murder of a police officer.
The Sunday Times said they had issued several demands, including the
release of all terrorists who have served more than 20 years, and the
immediate transfer of inmates to jails in Ireland.
They also object to a new regime which requires them to carry out
cleaning work. The Prison Service said only one prisoner had complained
about conditions.
There are fears the campaign could spread to other mainland jails
holding Irish terrorists and escalate into hunger strikes. The last
prolonged ''dirty protest'' in Northern Ireland culminated in the death
of 10 republican hunger strikers in 1981.
Meanwhile, it was reported that four IRA terrorists captured in 1975
after the Balcombe Street siege and later jailed for a string of
killings and bombings, could be repatriated to an Irish prison.
They could go free six months later, according to a newspaper article.
Martin O'Connell, Hugh Doherty, Edward Butler and Harry Duggan
unleashed a reign of terror on mainland Britain.
Their victims included TV personality Ross McWhirter, shot dead on his
own doorstep.
They were jailed in 1977 with a recommendation that they serve at
least 30 years on 25 charges of murders and bombings.
But the Mail on Sunday claims the Government is set to authorise their
transfer from British prisons to a jail in the Irish Republic under a
''secret deal with Dublin''.
The newspaper says that the move is a ''goodwill gesture by the
Government towards the Ulster peace process'' and could be made in
September to coincide with the first anniversary of the IRA ceasefire.
It adds that the prisoners, now all in their late 40s, could be
released within six months by the Irish Justice Department if the
ceasefire is maintained.
Other victims of the gang included cancer specialist Professor Gordon
Hamilton-Fairley, who was killed by a car bomb, and bomb disposal expert
Roger Goad, blown up by a device which exploded in a shop doorway.
The four were also responsible for bombings at the home of former
Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath and at some of London's most fashionable
hotels and restaurants.
They were captured after a six-day siege during which they held Post
Office supervisor John Matthews and his wife Sheila hostage at the
couple's flat in Balcombe Street, Marylebone.
A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said: ''There is no repatriation
agreement with Dublin.''

Major planned cuts in the Royal Ulster Constabulary have been put on
hold because of the recent widespread civil unrest in Northern Ireland.
The 13,500 officers in the force were told by the Police Authority
that their jobs were safe for the foreseeable future.
There had been concerns in the force that the ceasefire would lead to
big redundancies.
But the rioting, hijacking and arson attacks sparked by the release of
Private Lee Clegg and confrontations with Orangemen in Portadown and
Belfast have put paid to any early cuts.
About 30 people yesterday held a demonstration outside a Catholic
church following a spate of arson attacks on Orange halls. The hour-long
protest by Orangemen took place during mass at St Mary's Chapel,
Newtownabbey, north Belfast.
An Orange hall at nearby Greencastle, County Antrim, was targeted
twice by arsonists last week. The hall at Drumcree parish church, near
Portadown, County Armagh -- used by Orangemen during their 48-hour
stand-off with the RUC -- was attacked by arsonists two days ago.
In an apparent retaliatory attack, a newly-opened Catholic church in
Windsor Avenue, off Belfast's Malone Road, was targeted on Saturday
night. A fire at the front door was put out by police and damage was
minor.

AN Argyll airfield used by gliders and a flying club could be
developed for scheduled air services.
Council leaders have discussed the possibility of upgrading North
Connel airfield, six miles north of Oban, with an un-named company
interested in developing the services.
Oban councillor Ian Smyth, who attended the talks, said: ''This could
open up all sorts of possibilities. As far as I'm aware, the airfield
has been kept in pretty good order over the years.
''Campbeltown, Islay, Barra and other places have an airport and it
would seem reasonable that the facility at North Connel could be
upgraded and opened up for public use.
''I'm quite sure that, as far as the west coast is concerned, it would
be well used.''
He added that while Oban enjoyed strong links with the Western Isles,
air travellers had to fly to Glasgow then travel north by road or rail
to reach the town.
Mr Smyth, who is vice-chairman of Argyll and Bute District Council's
development committee, also maintained that upgrading the airfield would
boost business and help to attract firms which, because of modern
technology, no longer needed a city centre location.
The prospect of oil exploration off the west coast made upgrading an
even more viable proposition, he added.
He declined to name the company interested in developing the airfield
for reasons of commercial confidentiality. ''We had a meeting with them
and they have gone back to have a look at their proposals,'' he said.
The airfield runway was originally built during the Second World War
Two and in recent years has been maintained by Strathclyde Regional
Council.
The president of the 200-strong Oban and Lorn chamber of commerce, Mr
David Webster, welcomed the news, saying: ''If we have a recognised
airport, then it is automatically listed as such around the world. I
think it has tremendous potential.''
Modern small planes, such as the type used in the City of London's
airport, were ''extremely quiet'' and he did not foresee the level of
use as causing disturbance.
He felt that the best way forward was for an independent assessment to
be carried out into the future development of the airfield.

THE most bizarre victims of the tremendous downpour which hit Glasgow
on Friday have been discovered floating dead in the River Clyde -- more
than 100 fish, including some magnificent specimens of salmon.
While people who struggled through the storm may have been muttering
''Great weather for fish,'' it turned out not to be the case.
The riverbed of the Clyde became the deathbed for a variety of fish,
including the salmon, which have been returning to the river in stronger
numbers in recent years as efforts to reduce pollution succeed.
What appears to have killed the fish, according to Clyde River
Purification Board chief inspector, Mr Stewart Ross, is low oxygen
levels, although tests will be carried out on specimen fish later this
week to find out exactly.
But the theory, if confirmed, is that the recent hot weather has
raised the water temperature, which has reduced the available oxygen
within it for the fish.
Then came Friday's downpour which, in a short period of time,
threatened to engulf Glasgow's sewerage system. Water from the streets
flows into the system, which can usually cope. But when the level gets
too high, the excess, including some sewage, flows into the Clyde.
Normally, the river level rises with a lot of rain, and can thus cope
with the extra sewage, but the intense storm was over so quickly that
the water level did not rise, while the sewage did.
The bacteria in the sewage, when breaking down, uses up even more of
the oxygen supply and the fish, already stressed by oxygen levels below
normal due to the hot weather, could not cope, and died.
Mr George Parsonage, of the Glasgow Humane Society, said he had seen
more than 100 dead fish in the past few days while patrolling the river
from his boathouse at Glasgow Green.
''I've never seen salmon in the river before, although it's been
talked about for some time. It's tragic when the only ones you see are
dead ones.''
The only crumb of comfort came from Mr Ross. ''In one sense, it is an
indication that the river is improving. In the old days there were no
fish in the river to die off,'' he said.

A WOMAN died in hospital yesterday after an accident during a pony
demonstration at a village show.
School cook Ann Sutherland, 31, suffered serious head injuries when a
horse bolted and she was thrown from her gig. The vehicle overturned and
collided with another trap.
The accident happened after a pony demonstration at the New Deer
agricultural show, Grampian, on Saturday. Trap driver John Strathdee,
63, was also thrown from the trap, but suffered minor injuries.
Mrs Sutherland, from Mulben, Keith, was taken to Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary and died in intensive care. Grampian Police said a report
would be sent to the procurator-fiscal in Aberdeen.
The accident happened as horses and ponies competing in the carriage
driving class were leaving the arena. Eye-witness Linda Robertson, from
the nearby village of Cuminestown, said one of the horses suddenly
bolted towards the exit gates.
Mrs Robertson, who has owned horses for a number of years, added: ''It
began to stretch out into a gallop, and I could see the look of horror
on the driver's face.
''It hit another carriage and I just saw people flying off. The
injured woman was lying under a big cattle float. I think she was thrown
against it. It was one of these horrific situations. I was frozen to the
spot wondering what was going to happen.''
Mrs Robertson said the black and white cob which bolted must have
weighed just over half a ton. She said the driver of Mrs Sutherland's
gig, Mr John Strathdee, probably did not see the other horse coming
because of the suddenness of the incident.
''There did not appear to be any reason for it to bolt, but it may
have been stung or it may have seen the gates opening and said 'I am
going for it','' said Mrs Robertson.
Mrs Sutherland, from Walkerstrough, Mulben, near Keith, was a groom in
the carriage which was struck. Her husband, James, was understood to
have been at her hospital bedside last night.
Show president Gray Gall said the accident had come as a great shock
to the organisers. ''It is a terrible thing. We are all devastated. We
thought yesterday she was badly hurt but that she would be all right --
but today things do not look so rosy.
''It has really put a cloud over the whole event because it had been
such a tremendous success until that point. We will have an
investigation, but it seems to have been one of these things that no-one
could have done anything about,'' said Mr Gall.

A GARAGE employee has lost her case of sexual discrimination and
constructive dismissal against her employer, whose fiance allegedly
sexually harassed her.
But the tribunal had no doubt that another employee was subjected to
''unwanted attentions'' from the same filling station manager, who
allegedly touched her frequently, wanted sex with her, paid her extra
out of his own pocket, and said he loved her.
Mrs Laura Lee, of Gentlecroft, Braco, took Ms Caroline Marshall, the
franchise holder of two Shell filling stations, to an industrial
tribunal over acts allegedly carried out by her fiance, Mr Hugh Craig.
She worked at the Balhaldie filling station on the south-bound
carriageway of the A9 north of Dunblane and gave ''forceful evidence''
which was denied by Mr Craig.
The allegations were not reported to Ms Marshall because Mrs Lee liked
her and knew she was engaged to Mr Craig.
Noting evidence by former employee Miss Fiona Johnston, the tribunal
stated: ''We have no doubt that the main recipient of Craig's unwanted
attentions was not the applicant, but the 21-year-old Miss Johnston.
''She had entered the employment some months before the applicant.
From an early stage Craig started to comment on her body and her
clothing. He touched her frequently.
''He told her he wanted sex with her. She threatened to leave because
of his conduct. For a period, as an inducement for her not to do so, he
paid her an extra #10 per week out of his own pocket.
''She had a boyfriend. Craig told her that he was jealous and that he
loved her and would do anything to keep her.''
The tribunal also noted that Mr Craig told Miss Johnston's boyfriend
and relatives that she was involved with drugs and when the girl went to
tackle him about this: ''He backed her up against a wall, grabbed her by
the throat, but then released her.
''He apologised, saying it was because he loved her.''
Miss Johnston didn't complain immediately to Ms Marshall, but
consulted the Citizens Advice Bureau before telling her employer of the
physical ''attack''.
The tribunal noted that, ''for obvious reasons'', Ms Marshall was torn
between various courses of action and considered dismissing her fiance,
but instead transferred him to her Kincardine Bridge filling station at
Airth.
Ms Marshall also spoke to Mrs Lee about Mr Craig's conduct towards
Miss Johnston, and wasn't under any impression that she had suffered
sexual harassment by Mr Craig and, indeed, Ms Marshall never made any
such allegation to the manager.
Mr Craig returned to Balhaldie as manager, and it is in this period,
from August 1994 and Mrs Lee's resignation on October 23, 1994, that the
employee regards victimisation as having taken place but there is ''no
suggestion that in this final two-month period there was any renewal of
sexual harassment on Craig's part''.

THE majority of men seem unconcerned about the risk of skin cancer
when sunbathing on beaches in the UK, a survey carried out at several
locations, including Ayr, has revealed.
According to the Cancer Research Campaign, people sunbathing at home
were reluctant to use sunscreens and most did not feel it was necessary
to build up a tan.
The worst offenders were young men, around half of whom took no
precaution against the sun. Women were more cautious but still did not
feel it was necessary to protect their skins when walking around
outdoors. Abroad, the majority of holidaymakers said they were more
aware of the risks.
But the campaign warned that skin cancer was the fastest growing
cancer in the UK and strong sunshine in Britain could be dangerous to
bathers and holidaymakers.
The survey, jointly carried out with Boots, interviewed people on 11
English beaches and in Ayr and found that one in five parents said their
children went unprotected abroad.
The average holiaymaker spent 3.8 hours a day in the sun abroad,
compared to 2.8 hours on a beach at home. Older people were more likely
to gradually build up time in the sun -- four in 10 over-55s try to tan
gradually, compared to one in five under-24s.
CRC scientific director Professor Gordon McVie said there were about
1300 deaths and up to 40,000 new cases a year in the UK.
''It is clear that, as a nation, we need to examine our attitude to
sun protection outside of the traditional continental beach holiday.
Young men in particular need to show a stronger appreciation of the
dangers of the sun, both here and abroad.''

THE father of a three-year-old polio victim who has had his
life-saving operation cancelled twice has vowed to block the doors of
the hospital to stop his son leaving until he is treated.
Daniel Hadlow has had his operation cancelled on two occasions just
minutes before surgery was due to start, because of shortages of bed and
staff at Southampton General Hospital.
His father, Mark, said last night: ''I do not care who I upset, I am
not letting Daniel leave this hospital until he has his operation. I
will block the doors if I have to.''
The move is backed by his local MP, Mr Barry Field, Tory member for
the Isle of Wight, who plans to raise the matter in the Commons.
Daniel desperately needs the delicate surgery to straighten his spine
and relieve breathing difficulties.
He was first due to have the five-hour operation three weeks ago.
It was cancelled as a hospital porter was wheeling Daniel to the
operating theatre because of a lack of intensive care staff.
Hospital managers apologised to the family and promised it would never
happen again.
Daniel's surgeon, Mr Nicholas Boeree, said staff were so concerned
they volunteered to come in on their day off to perform the operation.
It was arranged to start at 1pm last Saturday but was finally
cancelled at 1.45pm.
Daniel had been prepared for surgery and was already wearing an
operating gown when the family were told that the intensive care bed he
needed had been taken.
Efforts to find a similar bed in a private hospital failed.
Mr Hadlow said the whole family were stunned.
''It is difficult to understand what we are all being put through
emotionally.
''We know this operation is vital, but it could also leave Daniel
paralysed from the waist down.
''Preparing for it has not been easy, but to have it cancelled twice
just minutes before it was due to go ahead is unbelievable.
''I will keep Daniel in the hospital until they operate on him. It is
not fair to treat a little boy this way. If I have to I will block the
doors.''
The 26-year-old builder, who gave up his job to look after his son,
added: ''On Saturday we were told the operation would start at about
1pm.
''Then, at about 1.45pm, the surgeon came up and told us all the
intensive care beds were full and the operation could not go ahead.
''The surgeon was devastated -- almost as upset as us. It is difficult
to remain calm in these circumstances.''
The hospital issued a short statement after the last cancellation.
It stated: ''Southampton General Hospital has been unable to operate
as planned today on Daniel Hadlow because of an unexpected emergency
which prevented the hospital from having an ITU (intensive care) bed
available as expected.
''Daniel is being kept in the hospital and we intend to operate on him
as soon as possible, hopefully within the next few days.
''We have apologised to his parents for this further delay, which has
arisen from circumstances beyond our control.''
Daniel has to sleep in an iron lung after contracting a polio-like
virus when just three months old. He can barely move his arms and legs
and cannot walk or crawl.
When he travelled from his home at Sandown on the Isle of Wight to the
mainland by ferry last Thursday a van load of medical equipment came
with him.
His parents believe he caught polio in a five-million-to-one chance
when he was vaccinated against the virus at three months old.

<HEADLINE>Labour was unelectable, says Blair. Labour leader addresses Murdoch conference</HEADLINE>

LABOUR leader Mr Tony Blair entered the lion's den yesterday and
criticised the establishment after admitting his party had been
unelectable.
However, in a speech to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation
conference in Australia, described by aides as one of his most important
expositions of the role of New Labour, he had praise for Baroness
Thatcher and ex-President Ronald Reagan.
He attacked the ''old boys network'' in the City of London and the
predominantly public school intake of Oxford and Cambridge universities.
He also said Britain's legal system was ''a nest of restrictive
practices'' and the parliamentary system was ''hopelessly outdated'' in
many of its practices and attitudes.
Mr Blair, who was educated at Fettes College, Edinburgh, and St John's
College, Oxford, where he read law, said many of those who supported the
Tories during the 1980s were not really Tories, they were
''anti-establishment''.
He said: ''They saw part of the left as well as the right running that
establishment. But unfortunately many of those Tories never really
wanted to bust the establishment but buy it out. We have in many ways
changed the personnel but few of the attitudes.
''We still have heriditary peers voting on legislation in the House of
Lords. The old boys network is much in evidence, not least in the City
of London.
''The intake at Oxford and Cambridge from public schools has barely
shifted in 30 years.''
In his speech on Hayman Island, off the Queensland coast, Mr Blair
said Labour was unelectable in the 1980s and the right-wing leadership
of Mrs Thatcher and Mr Reagan ''got certain things right'', such as
breaking up some of the vested interests associated with state
bureaucracy.
But, he said, Lady Thatcher was ''in that sense, a radical, not a
Tory'', and the claim that New Left was ''just a fancy way of saying
Tory'' was false.
However, Mr Blair admitted there would be overlap between left and
right politics.
''The value systems and the objectives will differ but there will be
some policy convergence and we should be relaxed, not tribal, about
this.
''The era of the grand ideologies, all encompassing, all pervasive,
total in their solutions -- and often dangerous -- is over. In
particular, the battle between market and public sector is over.''
Mr Blair defended his decision to address the conference, insisting he
was not there to trade policy for editorial support.
But his decision to go created controversy among some Labour
left-wingers who remember how Mr Murdoch sacked print workers in the
1980s and refused to recognise their unions. The last time Mr Murdoch's
Sun newspaper backed Labour at a General Election was in 1970.
Mr Blair's address to the conference is seen as an attempt to sell
Labour's message to the Conservative press, which has recently been
fiercely critical of Mr Major.
The Labour leader told 200 editors and senior managers from News
Corporation that his party had had to reconstruct its ideology and
organisation, a process of change which marked the long march back from
the dark days of the 1980s when ''frankly, we were unelectable''.
It was now literally a new party, he argued, with individual
membership up by over 120,000 in a year, and now on its way to 400,000.
''My leadership is based on this central belief that to become a
serious party of Government again, the Labour Party required not a
series of adjustments but a quantum leap.''
In a short passage, he pressed home the case for plurality of media
ownership in remarks which Labour aides were swift to deny were a shot
across Mr Murdoch's bows.
''The aim should be to create as much choice and diversity as
possible,'' Mr Blair said.
''Chris Smith (the shadow national Heritage Secretary) has already
laid out the principles which should govern this area -- diversity of
content, plurality of ownership, regional strength, quality of programme
making, and the avoidance of excessive dominance by any one company.''

AN investigation is under way at a prison for ''lifers'' after two of
the governor's peacocks were found dead in suspicious circumstances.
Inmates at Kingston Prison, Portsmouth, had earlier protested to
governor John Dovelle about early morning screeching from his three
peacocks.
While Mr Dovelle was taking a summer break, one of the birds was found
butchered in a prison yard. A second peacock was discovered dead a few
days later.
A source at the jail, which houses some of the most violent criminals
in the country, said: ''The first bird was found in a real mess. There
was blood everywhere.
''The problem continued . . . and, if anything, the noise got even
worse as the two peacocks were at different ends of the prison.''
The source added: ''The mating calls used to wake everyone up and even
nearby residents have complained.''
Mr Dovelle declined to comment.

THE mysterious death of a young driver has sparked an investigation by
police and scientists that could lead to a new challenge to the
resources available for law enforcement.
There were no witnesses and, unusually, no apparent cause for the
accident after the Strathclyde Police investigating officer had
eliminated the usual possibilities, like drink or mechanical defect.
Reluctant to leave this loose end, the police had further tests
carried out on blood samples by forensic experts at Glasgow University.
They found a tranquillising drug, equivalent to 4.4ml per 100 litres
of blood, yet the man's medical records showed he had received no
doctor's prescription for such a drug.
Now Superintendent Alistair McLuckie, deputy head of Strathclyde
Police traffic division, fears a hazard far more difficult to detect
than alcohol may be stalking the roads.
In 1993, the year the young man was killed, blood or urine samples
from 256 drivers in Scotland were tested for drugs, and 158 were found
positive and reported to the procurator-fiscal. Last year, 213 samples
were tested and 195 were positive.
Superintendent McLuckie and Dr John Oliver, senior lecturer in
forensic medicine and science at the university, are seeking to
determine whether these figures mask a much greater problem.
According to a study published last month by Greater Glasgow Health
Board, one in three teenagers over 16 claimed to take drugs, compared
with the two-thirds who admitted to drinking alcohol.
Many of these young people will, now or soon, be drivers. How
punctilious will they be about refraining from driving if they have
smoked a joint, injected, or popped a few pills?
The problem, in fact, is much more diverse. Superintendent McLuckie
pointed out: ''You can get problems from prescribed drugs,
over-the-counter drugs, and illegal substances. Even patients who are
taking medicines quite legitimately may disregard warnings about
driving.''
Current and previous Road Traffic Acts place drugs that can impair
driving ability in the same category as alcohol. The problem lies with
detection and enforcement.
Where testing has taken place the drugs most commonly found are
benzodiazepines -- sleeping pills or tranquillisers -- cannabis
products, and temazepam.
One drug directory available to GPs lists 248 drugs they can
prescribe, of which 120 can have an adverse effect on driving, including
confusion, drowsiness, and blurred vision. ''Fifteen of the 120 are
available over the counter without prescription,'' said Superintendent
McLuckie.
There is, however, no equivalent to the breathalyser for drugs
detection.
''We are looking at this because we make inquiries into all sorts of
fatal road accidents, and we are always looking for a cause.
''Where an accident is fatal we can require blood samples to be taken
and tested, but we have to have something that points us in that
direction.
''In the case of non-fatal accidents the driver can be required to
take a breathalyser test for alcohol. If you suspect a driver is under
the influence of something other than alcohol you may take a blood
sample to test for drugs.''
As far as Strathclyde is concerned the downward spiral in road
fatalities appears to have bottomed out, with the figures on the upturn
for the first quarter of this year.
Superintendent McLuckie blames this on crass driving behaviour -- in
many cases what is now called road rage -- rather than drugs.
But he points out: ''The incidence of drug misuse is on the increase,
and inevitably the number of drivers who are affected is increasing.''
Fighting this menace will be expensive even if the target can be
narrowed down to one drug or another.
Dr Oliver pointed out: ''There is a comparatively simple test for
cannabis which shows up the residual metabolites of the drug -- in other
words it will tell you if someone has been smoking it within the past
four weeks.''
The test for the active component, indicating recent use -- the test
which would be relevant in road traffic cases -- is more sophisticated
and a lot more expensive.
The battery of instruments that Dr Oliver and his colleagues uses has,
he believes, kept pace with the increased potency of the drugs they have
to search for. But at a price.
''We could be looking at a fairly comprehensive budget shift if we
decided to screen for every one,'' said Superintendent McLuckie.
Dr Ian McLaren, a consultant in the accident and emergency department
at Monklands Hospital, frequently has to deal with the results of
horrific crashes.
''With the increase in the use of controlled drugs it does make you
wonder how many accidents are being caused by them,'' he said.
''People involved in unexplained accidents who do not report them to
the police are not tested for drugs. Their friends may take them along
to casualty.''
Sometimes he is hampered as to what he can do about his own
suspicions. Taking a sample for testing without consent could be
construed as assault and lead to disciplinary action by the GMC.
Superintendent McLuckie pointed out that refusal to provide a sample
can be pursued in the same way as refusal to provide a breath test.
''There is a procedure for taking a sample in hospital if it does not
impinge on the patient's care,'' he added.
''Our main interest is the pursuit of road safety and the prevention
of accidents.''

THE holiday plane which caught fire shortly after take-off last
weekend was at the centre of a fresh controversy yesterday, with 33
frightened passengers refusing to board after a 12-hour delay at Glasgow
Airport.
A total of 254 holidaymakers were due to fly out to Gran Canaria on
the Spanish-owned Airbus at 11.55pm on Saturday -- the same aircraft
that was forced to turn back seven days before.
But after being kept waiting overnight, they were finally told that
their plane was the same one that had developed problems, and a new
engine had still not been fitted.
Those who boycotted the flight said they would rather lose the price
of their holiday than risk their lives.
The passengers who boarded the plane only did so after the pilot
personally reassured them that it was safe to fly.
Airport duty manager Barney Travers said everything had been done to
look after the passengers.
But widespread criticism of airport staff and tour operators Sunset
echoed complaints last week about lack of information for delayed
travellers.
Mr Bob Couper, 31, of Broomhill, Glasgow, said he arrived at the
airport well before midnight on Saturday. He added: ''When it was due to
take off, we were told there would be a two-hour delay because there was
some problem with the crew.
''Every two hours after that, there were announcements over the
Tannoy, but nobody came down to explain what was going on.
''It was only later that we realised it was the same plane that caught
fire last week. The problem had nothing to do with the crew -- they
couldn't fit the new engine.''
He said some people lost their tempers and police officers arrived to
calm the situation. ''It got quite heated and the police were keeping an
eye on things because there was the potential that it could get out of
hand.''
Airport management explained to waiting travellers that the engine had
been tested and was safe. Mr Travers said engineers had been working
round-the-clock to prepare it for the flight.
But the atmosphere became more tense when passengers were told the
Sunset representative had gone home ''under stress''. Some refused to
fly on the Oasis plane and demanded a replacement.
Mr Alan Campbell, 44, of Larkhall, refused to board and said he would
not be used as a ''guinea pig'' on an aircraft that had not been tested
in the air.
He said: ''I'm bad enough at flying without this happening. The people
on that plane must be either silly or desperate for a holiday. I spent
#1400 on that holiday, but I wouldn't put myself through that for any
money.''
As the arguments raged, several holidaymakers wept and one passenger,
Ms Margaret McGivern, of Blantyre, fainted. A teenage girl had earlier
been taken to Paisley Royal Infirmary for urgent medication to treat her
epilepsy.
Pilot Fernando Checa, who also flew the troubled plane last week, told
passengers: ''If it was not safe I would not be up in it.'' He added:
''I understand why they are upset, a 12-hour delay is too much.''
Alternative arrangements were made for 12 of the passengers who
boycotted the Oasis flight. The remaining 21 were believed to have gone
home after handing back their duty-free goods. Some said they would seek
compensation.
Terminal manager Stewart MacVicar said: ''We did everything we could
to help these people and those who did not get on the plane will have to
go through their tour operators.''
He said an internal airport investigation would be held to find out if
staff acted properly and kept passengers informed.
No one at Sunset was available for comment.
* There were a number of delays at airports around Scotland at the
weekend. Other Glasgow arrivals and departures were affected by a French
air traffic controllers' dispute. A flight to Toronto, Canada, was also
delayed for 24 hours due to ''technical problems''. A plane returning to
Aberdeen from Ibiza had to be diverted to Edinburgh on Saturday night
after it missed the Aberdeen Airport's 10.30pm curfew.

THE Scottish Liberal Democrats are to court the business community in
the run-up to the next General Election to win support in a sector they
believe they have neglected.
SLD leader Mr Jim Wallace has set up a business advisory group to help
him get across his party's message, particularly on the potential
benefits of a Scottish Parliament.
The Liberal Democrats are following a clear trend among opposition
parties which feel the Conservatives have been given too clear a run in
claiming the business community for their own.
Labour has formed the Scottish Industry Forum to establish such links
while the SNP recently revealed that salmon-farming company Marine
Harvest's chief Mr David McCarthy is one of its supporters.
Spearheaded by leading industrialist Mr Stefan Kay, the Liberal
Democrat group's first task will be to prepare a policy statement
setting out principles on investment, education, infrastructure, and job
creation to go before the party's Scottish conference next spring.
Mr Kay led the successful management buy-out and Stock Market
flotation of paper and board manufacturer Inveresk plc, making him a
multi-millionaire on paper in two senses of the term. He is current head
of the British trade organisation for the industry.
He stressed that Inveresk had no political affiliations and his work
for the Liberal Democrats was in a purely personal capacity. He had been
an active party member for many years and had been contacted by Mr
Wallace about the initiative.
''He thought the Liberal Democrats were not saying enough to the
business community,'' said Mr Kay. ''It started with discussion of what
our policies should be on industry and quickly developed into the issue
of how we can generate more employment in Scotland.''

A 20-YEAR-OLD student was dancing with her twin sister in an Aberdeen
nightclub when she collapsed from the effects of a fatal drugs cocktail,
it has been revealed by Grampian Police.
Miss Julia Young died three days later of liver failure as her parents
and twin, Lara, waited by her hospital bedside.
A police spokesman said inquiries were under way to trace anyone who
may have supplied the student with amphetamine-based drugs either at the
nightclub or before she went there. A report has been submitted to the
procurator-fiscal.
The circumstances of Julia's death were related by her sister at the
family's home in Penicuik, Midlothian, while the girls' father, civil
servant Mr James Young, 51, said: ''Don't let our lovely daughter's
death be in vain. Let every youngster know it could happen to you.''
Julia had completed two years of a computer studies course at Robert
Gordon University in Aberdeen. Her twin, Lara, studying for a business
degree at Edinburgh's Napier University, travelled north to join her
sister at a party night in the Palace nightclub in Bridge Place,
Aberdeen, last weekend.
''I was dancing with her,'' said Lara. ''We were holding hands. We had
loved dancing together ever since we were five. She was bubbly, full of
joy and happiness.
''Ten minutes later, she came off the dance floor. She appeared to be
dizzy and pointed at the door as if she wanted fresh air. I thought she
had fainted.''
Lara and a friend called an ambulance, which took Julia to Aberdeen
Royal Infirmary's intensive care unit early last Monday morning. Lara
said: ''It was the first time she ever took drugs. I would have known if
she had tried before. We were so close and shared every thought with
each other.
''If she had been a regular user I would have known. Julia could not
have hidden it from me. We were almost telepathic. We even bought
exactly the same card for Father's Day.
''Julia tried drugs just once and it killed her. Julia was the most
wonderful, warm, loving, and caring person you could ever meet. She was
also my best friend. I'm devastated.''
Mr Young, said his daughter died from a deadly cocktail of ecstasy and
amphetamine. ''At present, the police don't have evidence to connect
anyone with her death,'' he said.
''Julia was the happiest, sunniest, most loving and caring person you
could ever wish to meet. She had a wonderful, sunny disposition. She was
always smiling.
''Her death is a terrible, terrible waste. But we hope it will serve
as a warning to others, especially the young. Don't ever try it. And if
you are a regular user of drugs, stop now. You will not get away with it
forever.''
The twins' mother, Mrs Jan Young, 48, a management consultant, told
how the family kept vigil at the hospital bedside for three days,
praying their daughter would survive. ''Doctors told us that because she
was a young and healthy girl there was some chance that she'd pull
through,'' she said.
''They tried everything. They were loving and caring to her and to us.
But eventually Julia's liver failed and we lost her.
''Julia was special to everyone who knew her. She was a beautiful,
intelligent, and very happy person. Now all of that has gone because of
some impulse to see what it would be like to take drugs.
''With all our hearts, our family is asking all others to let our
daughter's death serve as a deadly warning. As we sat by her hospital
bedside, we saw what drugs did to our beautiful daughter.''
Julia's funeral is expected to take place in Penicuik on Wednesday.

FOR those whose idea of a Highland crofter is an old man in a bunnet,
smoking a pipe, first sight of Charlene MacLeod, 26, in ski pants and
T-shirt, comes as a shock.
But Charlene is, never the less, a crofter, and the first of three
successful entrants in Skye and Lochalsh to be approved for the ''croft
entrants'' scheme.
The scheme, a joint project by the local enterprise company and the
Crofters Commission, is aimed at bringing new blood into crofting.
Through it, Charlene's father, Skye-born Alistair Cameron, 61, has
passed over the tenancy of his three-and-a-half acre croft at Drumbuie,
between Kyle of Lochash and Plockton, to the youngest of his three
daughters. His son Donald, 29, already has a croft.
Said Charlene, who presently lives in a flat in Kyle with her joiner
husband David, 33: ''This is a dream come true for me. Getting a croft
is far from easy. I was brought up on one and loved all aspects of the
life.''
Laughing, she added: ''Although I was the youngest I think I was more
ready than my sisters to muck in.''
Helped by her husband, she has already cut all her hay on the
''bareland'' or houseless croft, which has spectacular views over the
sea to Skye and the island of Raasay. The next job is to harvest the
corn and weed and earth up the potatoes.
Charlene has hired a digger to help clear rocks from a previously
unworked part of the croft with the help of a #1000 grant from her local
LEC.

THE call of the sea lured at least 250,000 people to Leith yesterday
to marvel at the 100 sailing vessels mustered for the Cutty Sark Tall
Ships Race and to mingle with the crews.
The massive attendance followed a turn-out of 100,000 on Saturday, and
the organisers fully expect the total to have exceeded 1,000,000 before
the armada sets sail for the race itself tomorrow.
Leith's dockland became so busy yesterday that one-way rules were
imposed on pedestrians in some areas, particularly over a bridge linking
different berths.
The giant Russian vessel Sedov, the world's largest working sailing
ship, and the only slightly smaller Kruzenshtern, proved particularly
popular.
The Sedov crew offered visitors a chance to win Russian tea-urns at a
quayside stall. Among the smaller prizes, and also on sale for #1.50 to
#3, were a range of badges, including obsolete Soviet versions bearing
Lenin's profile.
The police estimate of 250,000 visitors yesterday covered only the six
hours from 10am to 4pm. Thousands more arrived later.
Over the same period, 10,000 private cars used the park-and-ride
spaces set aside for the event. Police praised motorists for using the
system and the special public transport that was laid on.
Thousands more are expected to inundate the docks today, when the
carnival continues, leading up to a spectacular fireworks display
tonight.
Tomorrow, an estimated 500,000 people are expected to line vantage
points on both sides of the Forth to watch the Tall Ships go through
their paces in the Parade of Sail.
The Princess Royal will fire the gun signalling the start of the first
leg of the great adventure, from Leith to Bremerhaven.
* Three protesters from Friends of the Earth were arrested at the Tall
Ships event after staging a demonstration at the stand of Scottish
Nuclear, sponsor of one of the vessels.
Police held them following an alleged incident beside a dockside
crane.
Later a spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said the arrests were
in connection with alleged public order offences. He said a report would
be submitted to the procurator-fiscal.
The arrests came only hours after Stockbridge Parish Church, about a
mile away from the Port of Leith, commemorated the first atomic
explosion.
It was one of many churches throughout Scotland ringing bells 50
times, one for every year of the nuclear age.
The parish had invited people to remember those whose lives had been
destroyed by nuclear weapons and to pray for a global ban.
Among those taking part in the vigil was SNP deputy leader Dr Allan
Macartney.

SCOTTISH Tories and the SNP found themselves singing the same song for
a change yesterday as they pounced on reports that Labour was about to
announce a reduced commitment to English devolution.
Both claimed the ''U-turn'' showed Labour leader Mr Tony Blair's
constitutional policy was in tatters and placed a question mark over his
pledged Scottish parliament.
But Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson last night insisted
that plans for a Scottish parliament remained unchanged.
In a consultation paper to be published later this week, Shadow Home
Secretary Mr Jack Straw is expected to announce a dilution of Labour's
commitment to the introduction of directly-elected regional assemblies
for England.
That policy has been criticised by the Government as costly and
bureaucratic. Instead, Labour's new plan proposes that local authorities
nominate councillors for ''regional chambers'' which will consider
matters such as economic development and planning policy and oversee
quangos.
Labour will stress that directly-elected regional assemblies remain an
option, albeit in the long term, where there is strong local support.
But Labour's opponents in Scotland claim the new plan leaves the party
with no response to the West Lothian question, which is how, with a
devolved Scottish parliament, Scots MPs could vote at Westminster on
matters affecting England when English MPs would have no say on many
Scottish issues.
SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond said yesterday: ''Labour's answer to the
West Lothian question has now come crashing down around their ears and
the most worrying aspect is that they seem to have caved in under Tory
pressure.
''As recently as January, Gordon Brown was flagging up English
devolution as going hand in hand with constitutional reform north of the
Border and so the great fear must be that Labour will now try to crawl
out of some of its limited commitments to Scotland.''
Mr Salmond claimed Mr Blair was lukewarm, and his close advisers
openly hostile, on devolution. ''The Blairite Labour Party will look for
any excuse to downplay their already limited proposals in Scotland.
Nothing is sacred to Tony Blair in his pursuit of power.''
He added: ''Blair is someone who has torn up his party's constitution.
Now he is tearing up his constitutional plans for England. The only
guarantee that he won't renege on his commitment to constitutional
change in Scotland is fear of the SNP.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, said the
move showed that Labour had not thought through its devolution policy.
''When they originally came up with regional assemblies, they were meant
to be the magic solution to the West Lothian question.
''But under the spotlight of scrutiny, Labour's devolution policy has
fallen apart. This was Tony Blair's flagship policy but it was holed
below the water line.''
Sir Michael made it clear the Tories would be stepping up their
efforts to persuade Scottish voters that a devolved Scottish parliament
would mean paying more tax than in any other part of the UK.
''When we get going on the tartan tax, I predict that Labour will try
to do another U-turn. They are in a real mess and no amount of smarmy
sound-bite policies will disguise the chaos of their constitutional
policies.''
But Mr Robertson said: ''The plan for Scotland remains firmly in place
and the timetable is unaffected.
''Labour's plans for a Scottish parliament are clearly different and
distinct from what is now on offer in England. The plan for England is
designed for England where the debate is nowhere nearly as advanced as
it is in Scotland.''

THE first commercial ski operator in Scotland, White Corries Ltd at
Glencoe, is to merge with the Glenshee Chairlift Company to create an
east-west axis and the promise of new facilities for skiers.
The merged company, which will operate under the name of Glenshee
Chairlift Company, will offer a combined season ticket giving skiers the
opportunity to choose either centre, depending on whether snow
conditions are better in the east or west.
White Corries chairman Robin Fleming will join the 12 directors on the
Glenshee Chairlift board.
He said: ''The future joint operation will bring benefits to both
companies with opportunities for economies of scale in a number of
areas.''
Among the developments will be Glencoe becoming a seven-day-a-week
operation. Until now it has been closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays,
Mr David Stewart, executive director of the Glenshee Chairlift
Company, said there would be an immediate investment in a piste-grooming
machine and new snow-fencing aimed at improving snow-holding ability at
Glencoe. He added: ''There will also be a new beginners' tow for the
plateau area. We have earmarked up to #200,000 for Glencoe for the
coming winter.''
Mr Stewart said the merger had come about following discussions
between the chairmen of the two companies.
The Glenshee company is also aiming to expand its operation throughout
the year by building an 18-hole golf course, clubhouse, and ancillary
facilities at Alyth in Perthshire.

THREE people died in separate road accidents in Lanarkshire over the
weekend.
Audrey Tobin, 15, of Millstream Crescent, Caldercruix, was killed when
the Ford Escort in which she was a front-seat passenger apparently went
out of control on the A73 at Monkland Bridge, Airdrie, and collided with
a Rover travelling in the opposite direction.
The driver of the Escort suffered serious injuries and is being
treated at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie. The occupants of the other car
were treated for minor injuries.
Police have appealed for witnesses to the accident, which happened
shortly before 10pm on Saturday, to contact them.
Meanwhile, Mr Brian Cosgrove, 29, of Priory Avenue, Lesmahagow, was
found dead on the hard shoulder of the M74 near Canderside Toll shortly
before 4am on Saturday.
Police have appealed for anyone who saw a man hitchhiking or walking
on the south-bound carriageway of the motorway at Larkhall to contact
them. They believe Mr Cosgrove may have been hit by a vehicle after 3am
on Saturday.
Shortly after midnight on Saturday, Mr Thomas Lister, 31, of Newton
Road, Strathaven, died after being knocked down by a car in Camnethan
Street, Stonehouse.

THE last surviving member of Britain's 1930s' generation of
heavyweight poets, Sir Stephen Spender, died yesterday aged 86 after
collapsing in his north London home. His wife, the concert pianist
Natasha Litvin, was with him when he died.
Born the son of a journalist in 1909, Spender was a contemporary and
friend of literary figures such as W H Auden, Christopher Isherwood,
Louis MacNeice, Cecil Day-Lewis and Edward Upward.
This group of poets, who were to dominate British verse for decades,
met while Spender was a student at Oxford.
Although briefly a member of the Communist Party, Spender was never
entirely committed to far-left politics, and described his
disillusionment with the party in his essay in the 1949 collection of
recantations by former Communists, The God That Failed.
As the Second World War started, Spender took up the joint editorship
with Cyril Connolly of Horizon magazine and served as a London fireman.
Spender, whose poems were first published in the early 1930s, remained
active in intellectual life well into his 80s, writing and giving
interviews until shortly before his death.
He was co-editor of the magazine Encounter from 1953, when it was
founded, until his discovery in 1967 that it had been funded with CIA
money. Later he fought for freedom of speech through the journal Index
on Censorship.
Spender married his first wife Agnes in 1936, and wrote about the
painful breakdown of the marriage in his much-praised 1941 collection
Ruins and Visions.
His marriage to Natasha Litvin in 1941 produced two children, Matthew
and Lizzie.
Spender's wide circle of friends included eminent figures from all
corners of the world of art and letters, including Igor Stravinsky,
Henry Moore and David Hockney.
He was professor of English at University College, London, from 1970
to 1977, was awarded the CBE in 1962 and was knighted in 1983.
Among his famous works are the verse play Trial of a Judge (1937) and
the autobiography World Within World (1951). His Collected Poems
1930-1985, published in 1985, contained a vast array of work from six
decades.
His 1939 collection Poems For Spain reflected his passionate
commitment to the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War.
Spender was always actively engaged in political debate, and his most
famous poem, The Truly Great, is a meditation on the few great figures
who have shaped history.
0 Throughout his life, he compared his talents unfavourably to those
of his contemporary Auden, describing himself as a ''minor poet'' by
Auden's standards.

<HEADLINE>MP calls duke 'a chancer' in estate storm</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Duke of Atholl was described as ''a chancer'' by an MP yesterday
for calling in the Territorial Army to repair a riverbank on his
Perthshire estate with the taxpayer footing most of the bill.
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, SNP MP for Perth and Kinross, added: ''The
arrogance of people like the Duke of Atholl knows no bounds.
''These soldiers would have been far better involved in enterprises
that benefit the public, who do not have the duke's wealth.''
The 64-year-old bachelor duke, who owns 135,000 acres in Perthshire
worth #140m, is one of Britain's richest men and has his own private
army, the Atholl Highlanders.
However, when the River Tilt was eating into a bank on his estate and
also threatening a private house, a team of Royal Engineer Territorials
was called in to straighten out the river.
The Government is to foot the bill for the 12-day operation by the
volunteers.
The 6ft 5in Old Etonian duke, known as ''Wee Iain'', was criticised
earlier this year when he applied for a #400,000 Forestry Commission
grant to plant trees on his estate.
Controversy also erupted when it was revealed that he was charging
motorists #5 to drive along a pot-holed road on his estate to a beauty
spot.
Mr Ewan Dow, leader of the SNP administration on Tayside Regional
Council, said yesterday: ''This man is milking the system, despite his
own personal fortune.
''I think it's ironic that a man who has his own private army has to
get in the taxpayers' army to do some handiwork on his estate.''
An Army spokesman explained that the Territorial Army ''sometimes
involves itself in military aid to the civilian community''.
The Duke was not available for comment at his flat at his home of
Blair Castle, at Blair Atholl. A spokesman said he was ''down south''.
However, Mr Andrew Gordon, Atholl Estates factor, scoffed at
suggestions that the bill for the operation would be #30,000. He said:
''If we'd gone out to tender, it would have been half of that.''
Mr Gordon explained that the River Tilt had been eating into a bank on
the Atholl estate and also below a private house on the opposite side of
the river.
''We got on to the Army to see if they could help. They've worked for
us before. They come and train all over Atholl ground as a matter of
course anyway.
''They've straightened the river out to try and get it back on its
original course so that it stops washing away this person's house. It
was a community effort as much as anything else.
''Any private individual in this country, if they'd been in that
position, could have got the Army to do that for them.''
Mr Gordon defended the duke against his critics. He stressed: ''The
business about him money-grabbing from the state is total nonsense.
Everyone's having a go at him and it makes me very cross.''

THE Duke of York suffered driving problems when he teed-off to open a
#7.5m golf course at St Andrews yesterday.
The Duke had driven a Range Rover to play the first round at the
Duke's Course at Craigtoun Park.
But while he played nine holes with former Open champion Ian
Baker-Finch and retired Scottish rugby captain Gavin Hastings, the
vehicle developed an oil leak.
And the duke had to be transported by the police to RAF Leuchars to
catch his flight back to England.
Prince Andrew played the inaugural shot yesterday on the parkland
course, which was designed by five-times Open winner Peter Thomson.
The 18-hole course has been developed by the owners of the Old Course
Hotel at St Andrews, and is the first inland, championship-standard
course to have been opened at the ''home of golf''.
The Duke joked with the crowd before he played the first shot and
asked the course designer for directions to the first green after he had
teed off.
Work on the course started just under two years ago. It has a par of
72 over its 7171 yards.
* IT had been expected to fetch a ''fore-figure'' amount . . .
yesterday, however, at an auction house in Scotland, a rare feather golf
ball was bought for almost #20,000 -- a new world record price for one
ball, writes Raymond Duncan.
Officials at Phillips Scotland were delighted but surprised at the
outcome of the sale in their packed auction room in Edinburgh's George
Street, because the ball which established the record was not the one
that was expected to top the sale.
That had been a ''feathery'' made by Tom Morris, the legendary Scots
ball and club maker, in 1849. Signed by him and produced in the last
year of feather balls, it fetched #7060 -- close to its estimate.
Instead in an auction where the top six balls attracted bids totalling
#60,000 -- almost double the amount anticipated by Phillips -- attention
swung to a feather ball made by D Marshall and stamped RHB -- Dr R H
Blaikie, a founder member of Loughness Golf Club in East Lothian -- it
was bought by dealer Mr Titus Kendall for the Valderama golf venue in
southern Spain for #19,995.

A MAN threw his two young children more than 30ft from a third-floor
balcony, killing one of them, then leapt to his own death.
Three-year-old Jubyra Amorim-Pimenta was critically ill on a
life-support machine yesterday, 24 hours after the tragedy.
His mother, Natasha, who was separated from her husband, Jose, was by
his bedside at the Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, east London.
Jubyra's five-year-old brother, Asunto, died on Saturday, a few hours
after being thrown to the ground.
Neighbours said yesterday that the 42-year-old father, a former
professional footballer from Brazil, saw the children at weekends.
Mrs Margaret McBrian, 58, said: ''He took the children along the
balcony to watch a friend of his leave on a motorbike.
''He told the children: 'Say goodbye to your friend'. They said
goodbye and he threw them over -- one after the other -- and then threw
himself down, head down.
''It was all over in a second. There was nothing anyone could do. I
went over to the bodies and knelt down and prayed the children would
live.''
The father died minutes later at the council block of flats, Havering
House, in Seven Sisters Road, Finsbury Park, north London.
He came to Britain from Brazil in 1976 and had been working as a
painter-decorator. In his youth, he had played for the Rio team,
Flamengo, as a junior.
Mrs McBrian, a mother-of-six, said: ''This is so tragic. If the man
wanted to kill himself, let him, but why hurt the children? What had
they done?''
Mrs McBrian said the dead man was well-mannered and courteous. He had
''never showed any signs that anything was wrong''.
Mrs Tricia Page, 31, who lived next door to the dead man, said: ''The
children used to play with my boys. They were never any trouble. We
cannot believe what has happened. He seemed an ordinary, pleasant man.''
Mr Jose Brito, the dead man's flatmate, was quoted as saying he had
been quite normal shortly before the incident. His wife had telephoned
from her new home in King's Cross to check that the children had arrived
safely.
* Police investigating the deaths of a mother and her two young sons
in their seaside home last night charged a man with their murders. The
bodies of Ms Deborah Brackhahn-Hughes, who was in her 30s, and sons
James, seven, and Matthew, six, were found in three rooms of the house
in Hemsby, Norfolk.
Mr Martyn Hughes, 37, was charged with the three murders and will
appear before magistrates in Great Yarmouth today.
Post-mortem examinations showed all three victims died from
asphyxiation. They were found in the house on Friday night.

THE eagerly-awaited Greenbury Report into top people's pay, to be
published today, urges companies to be more open about their
remuneration policy, but it has already come under fire from Labour for
not going far enough.
Sir Richard Greenbury's committee, set up in January by the
Confederation of British Industry to tackle public anger over the level
of boardroom salaries, also calls on the Government to abolish tax
concessions for executive share options.
But the Labour Party complained yesterday that the report stopped
short of ending the ''abuse and greed'' in the privatised utilities, and
pledged to continue its campaign.
It will today call on the Government to commit itself to introducing
tough controls on executive pay, particularly in privatised industries.
A leaked copy of the report shows that Marks and Spencer chairman Sir
Richard, and the other 10 members of his committee, have made a number
of recommendations in a bid to answer public disquiet.
The committee calls for shareholders to have increased accountability
for directors' pay packages and a new code of best practice which firms
should follow.
Other main recommendations include:
* Remuneration committees should consist exclusively of non-executive
directors.
* Annual reports to shareholders should include full details of a
company's remuneration policy.
* Annual bonuses should be linked to directors' performance.
* Privatised water and energy companies should review remuneration
packages, including share options, and alter them on a voluntary basis
if necessary.
* No share options should be granted for at least six months in future
privatisations.
Labour wants the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, to
make a Commons statement this afternoon.
Its deputy leader, Mr John Prescott, said his party did not believe
the CBI report would go far enough to end executives' abuse of their
power.
A key recommendation, which the Opposition will support, is that
executive share options should be taxed as income rather than capital
gains, which generally means a smaller tax bill.
Mr Prescott, interviewed on the BBC's Breakfast With Frost TV
programme, said Labour wanted a ban on share options being offered to
executives in any other industries that are to be privatised.
Labour wants the regulators of privatised industries to cut prices to
consumers rather than allow huge salary and bonus pay awards for their
executives. Mr Prescott said such large pay rises should be allowed only
if voted for by shareholders.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown accused six National Power directors of
a ''pre-Greenbury gold rush'' following reports that the group,
including chairman Mr John Baker, cashed share options worth #1.98m in
May and June.
Labour claimed the #366,000 made by Mr Baker takes his share earnings
above #1m. The party alleges that he cashed #713,000 worth in November.
Mr Greville Janner, Labour chairman of the Commons Employment Select
Committee, said the Greenbury Report did not go far enough because it
had not dealt with the abuse of monopoly power which had led to the
''scandals'' of executive pay in privatised utilities.
Nearer home, the Opposition will propose on Wednesday that the public
should be able to inspect a record of all MPs' contracts for providing
parliamentary services to outside organisations.
The Government will urge MPs to give the all-party committee
considering the Nolan Committee Report on Standards in Public Life
longer to work out how the recommendations should be implemented.
During Wednesday's debate on Nolan, Commons leader Tony Newton is
expected to announce that the Government has decided against proposing a
public interest defence for Ministers who withhold information from
Parliament.

<HEADLINE>Gorazde threatened as military chiefs hunt for Bosnian solution. Serb guns to turn on    Britons.</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE MILITARY chiefs from Britain, France, and the US ended their
emergency talks in London last night, as the Serbs showed their contempt
by pounding one safe haven, and issuing a chilling warning to British
troops.
Bosnian Serb troops burst to the very edge of the UN safe haven of
Zepa, meeting little resistance from outgunned government soldiers and
the tiny group of just 79 UN peacekeepers.
Zepa's mayor broadcast anguished radio appeals for help from the
United Nations, but they were pleas which held little fear for Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
As he derided the idea he might be tried for war crimes, he dismissed
the very concept of UN ''safe areas''.
He served notice that his forces intended to conquer all the land
between Sarajevo and Serbia, one of the rebels' main war aims.
''The Muslim enclaves in Bosnia are no longer viable and have to
disappear. If not we will take them by force,'' he told Spain's El Pais
newspaper.
He said Zepa and the British-guarded enclave of Gorazde must be
disarmed completely and put under dual UN and Serb control.
There are 200 British troops, of the Royal Welch Regiment, and 100
Ukrainians guarding Gorazde.
Once the Serbs seize Zepa, which seems only a matter of time, they are
expected to turn the full force of their guns on Gorazde, the remaining
UN safe haven in eastern Bosnia.
The military has warned that if Gorazde falls, the capital Sarajevo
will follow, and the UN mission in Bosnia will be at an end.
It was that crisis which was concerning the military chiefs last
night. The talks broke up after five hours with little clue as to their
outcome.
The Ministry of Defence released a statement saying: ''The chief of
the defence staff, Field Marshal Sir Peter Inge, held discussions with
his French and American counterparts this evening, as forecast in the
press announcement issued by the Prime Minister on 14 July. They
discussed the situation in Bosnia and will now report to their
respective governments.''
Those meeting Sir Peter were French Admiral Jacques Lanxade and
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Any proposals thrashed out will have to be approved by their political
chiefs before any military options could be pursued.
The five-nation contact group -- Britain, France, US, Russia and
Germany -- meet in London on Friday. That meeting will also be attended
by representatives from the UN and Nato.
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said the allies were looking at
military options concerning the future of Gorazde, an area of about
60,000 people, the supply of Sarajevo, and the future of the UN
protection forces.
A French official said, ahead of last night's talks, that the military
chiefs were likely to agree on a plan to reinforce Gorazde and open a
supply route to Sarajevo.
It was understood that plans to be presented at the meeting involved
using US Apache or Cobra attack helicopters and Sea Stallion heavy-lift
helicopters to reinforce Gorazde and protect a link to the capital.
But as the talks went on, so did the Serbian advance. ''Bosnian Serb
infantry supported by tanks and heavy mortars are within 1500 yards of
Zepa,'' said UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko.
''They're approaching from the west. The troops are in front and the
tanks are behind the line firing. We have Nato air presence over the
area. From what we understand there's not much Bosnian government
resistance.''
Only 79 Ukrainian peacekeepers were stationed in the area to protect
its population of 15,000 frightened Muslims.
Before the attack started, Bosnian government troops themselves
overran three Ukrainian UN observation posts and seized weapons and
ammunition, on the assumption their UN protectors had little intention
of resisting the Serbs.
Zepa is the second UN ''safe area'' for Muslim refugees in eastern
Bosnia to come under Serb attack in a week of fighting that could prove
to be a turning point in the three-year Bosnian war.
Serb forces captured Srebrenica last Tuesday, forcing most of its
40,000 people to flee in a wave of ''ethnic cleansing''.
Mr Ivanko said as far as he knew the UN had not requested Nato air
strikes in Zepa, but Allied jets were flying over the area. Two strikes
last week failed to stop the Serb advance on Srebrenica.
With the situation on the ground worsening by the hour, US Secretary
of State Warren Christopher said in Washington that America is ready to
lend military equipment to help the UN forces, but will still not send
ground troops.
''We will not inject American troops into the situation in Bosnia,''
he said, adding: ''American equipment is certainly a possibility.''
In Belgrade EU envoy Carl Bildt said a Bosnian Serb general had agreed
to give the Red Cross access to several thousand Muslim men taken away
during the capture of Srebrenica.
At the same time a UN spokesman said all 64 Dutch peacekeepers seized
in and around Srebrenica had now been freed by the Serbs.
Two people were killed and three others wounded when a pair of mortar
bombs slammed into Sarajevo's old town.
Three others had been wounded earlier in the day in Serb shelling of
Hrasnica, a western suburb held by the government army.
The Bosnian capital's old town district was rocked by two blasts
shortly after 7pm, a time when the city's streets have been dangerous in
recent weeks.
Bosnian Serb forces laying siege to Sarajevo have stepped up shelling
attacks on the city since government troops launched an offensive last
month aimed at easing the Serb stranglehold.
The Pope condemned attacks on the ''safe areas'' as crimes against
humanity.
''What is being carried out under the world's gaze is a defeat for
civilisation,'' he said in one of his strongest outbursts on the Bosnian
war.
He added: ''These crimes will remain one of the saddest chapters in
the history of Europe.
''The news and the images from Bosnia, and in particular from
Srebrenica and Zepa, show how much Europe and mankind have plunged
further into the abyss of wretchedness.''
Former Labour leader Michael Foot said that if Britain could save the
Falkland Islands, it could certainly save Sarajevo, and UN forces had to
be given the power to resist Serb aggression.
Former Defence Secretary Sir John Nott accused Mr Major of ''gross
incompetence'' in his handling of the crisis.
He branded the Government's failure to act as feeble and said Mr Major
should lift the arms embargo.
''We must be able to lift the arms embargo because in the end, this
question will not be settled by diplomacy,'' Sir John told Sky News.
The Bosnian Minister responsible for UN contacts, Hasan Muratovic,
claimed at an emergency government session that the Ukrainian commander
had requested Nato air strikes three times in the past two days.
The government demanded to know why the United Nations had been so
slow. UN official said they knew only of requests for air presence.

A MISSING schoolboy, thought to have gone abroad to join Greenpeace,
has turned up in Nottingham.
Last night Steven Marcinkiewicz telephoned his parents in Menstrie
Road, Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, to let them know he was safe and
well.
The 16-year-old six-footer's disappearance 10 days ago sparked off a
search by helicopter and mountain rescuers in the hills near his home,
which was called off after it was found he had withdrawn cash in
Stirling.
His family feared he had run off to join Greenpeace.
But last night his father, Mr George Marcinkiewicz, said: ''Steven has
phoned home to say he is safe and well. He didn't say where he was or
where he was going.
''But, with the phone dial-back facility, we know he was calling from
Nottingham. We are only too glad to know he is safe.''
The Marcinkiewiczes had handed out 2500 leaflets in Glasgow city
centre begging for help in tracing the boy.

<TEXT>
RENFREW district could be in line for thousands of new jobs if fresh
proposals to develop the remainder of the former Linwood car plant site
are approved.
Tilbury-Phoenix, a company involved in a major regeneration of the
area, has announced proposals for a #140m mixed-use development which
could create employment opportunities for up to 7000 people. It has
already submitted outline proposals to Renfrew District Council.
Initial details will be revealed to councillors at an economic
development committee meeting in Paisley tomorrow.
The latest proposal involves a massive expansion on sites to the north
and south of Linwood Road with additional factory and warehouse units
and special-build premises being erected to extend the existing Phoenix
Business Park, for commercial, leisure, retail and, most importantly,
industrial use.
Tilbury-Phoenix said the entire project would have to be spread over
10 years. Plans include an upmarket American-style warehouse club,
industrial and business parks, fast-food outlets, restaurants, and
entertainment complexes spread over a 2,500,000sq ft area.
Development officers who have drawn up the package, said they were
confident it would be given full approval by the council.
Renfrew's planning officials are almost certain to call for an
environmental impact study in advance of any decision, since the scale
of the proposal will involve construction of new access roads and
attract large volumes of traffic into the area.
Local MP Mr Tommy Graham welcomed the announcement as the ''best news
for Renfrewshire'' in many years.
He said: ''What is most encouraging is that these are not just retail
jobs that are being created but industrial jobs too and that's exactly
the kind of work we desperately need to keep Renfrewshire alive.''
Senior development officers from Tilbury-Phoenix will be involved in
discussions with officials from the council's economic development and
planning departments over the next few weeks. It is anticipated that the
planning application will then be considered by councillors in about
eight weeks.
* When the Linwood car plant was in full production in the mid-1960s,
it employed almost 8000 workers but it hit troubled times by the
mid-1970s. When Talbot finally shut the factory in 1981, 5000 workers
were laid off.

SIR Richard Greenbury is a workaholic boss who puts in a 90-hour week
in a career which cost him his marriage.
The 59-year-old Marks and Spencer chairman admitted that his tireless
devotion to his job had ruined his marriage.
Sir Richard leaves home at 8am, attends business dinners three nights
a week, and visits one of his stores at the weekend.
He issued a statement in May saying he and his second wife, Gabrielle,
who is 20 years younger than him, had decided to separate.
Sir Richard's own pay jumped by 17% last year to #807,000, prompting
criticism from opposition parties over his role as chairman of the
committee investigating executive pay.
Born in Yorkshire, Sir Richard went to school in London and has lived
in the South most of his life.
He joined Marks and Spencer, probably Britain's most respected
company, at the age of 16 as a management trainee, rising through the
ranks via the busy store in London's Marble Arch before moving to head
office.
His starting salary was just #4 a week. He spent nine years on the
shop floor before climbing the management ladder right to the top,
becoming chairman in 1991.
He lives in a flat close to Marks and Spencer's Baker Street
headquarters in the week and has a house near the Royal Military Academy
at Sandhurst in Surrey.
He has two sons and two daughters by his first marriage, which ended
in divorce in 1985.
Sir Richard, a keen footballer and tennis player in his youth, finds
time to watch his beloved Manchester United in the soccer season.
Despite heading a top company, Sir Richard has a reputation as a calm,
hard working leader who is prepared to listen to other views and is
popular with his staff, although is known to be blunt and direct.
''In Yorkshire, we speak our minds,'' he once said.
He took on the most difficult job in business by agreeing to chair the
committee on executive pay following the public outcry of a 75% pay rise
for British Gas chairman Mr Cedric Brown.
Despite expecting to recommend a new code of practice on publishing
details of executives' pay as well as changes to share options' tax
arrangements, unions and Labour are bound to attack the findings as a
whitewash.
Sir Richard has told colleagues that chairing the committee was the
worst job he has ever taken on.
Labour led the wave of protest over Mr Brown's massive pay rise,
singling out bosses in privatised utilities for accepting huge increases
while charges to consumers rose and thousands of workers lost their
jobs.
The Government was faced with increasing levels of criticism for
failing to tackle the problem, leading to the Greenbury Committee being
set up in January.
The 11-man committee, chaired by Sir Richard, was established by the
Confederation of British Industry with the Government's backing.
Ministers hoped the move would take the heat out of the controversy
but the row continued to rage with every new detail of executives' pay
rises.
Mr Brown faced a backlash from British Gas's own shareholders at the
company's annual meeting when he was forced to defend his #475,000
salary.
Bosses of privatised utilities have been criticised by Labour over
executive share options.
Directors of the National Grid were condemned in May for transferring
shares worth more than #650,000 into their wives' names to avoid paying
tax.
The Prime Minister himself told the Commons earlier this year he found
executive pay rises ''distasteful'' and said he would consider any new
legislation if recommended by the Greenbury Committee.
The cross-party Commons Employment Select Committee launched its own
inquiry into the controversy, quizzing a succession of the country's top
businessmen, including BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance, as well as Mr
Brown.
The furore is unlikely to subside, despite publication of the
Greenbury report.
* The 11 members of the Greenbury committee investigating executive
pay earn almost #3m between them.
The highest earner is Sir Richard Greenbury. Other committee members
and their salaries (where known) are:
Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of BT -- #599,000 in salary and bonus
payments.
Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN -- #441,000.
Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Whitbread and Boots -- #302,000
(#163,000 from Whitbread and #139,000 from Boots).
Mr David Simon, chairman of BP -- #240,000.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors
-- #160,000.
Mr George Metcalfe, chairman of component distributors Umeco -- around
#100,000.
The salary of Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of the Rank organisation,
will be published next year following his move earlier this year from
ICI.
The other members of the committee are Mr Geoff Lindey, head of UK
institutional investment at JP Morgan Investment Management, Sir David
Chapman of Newcastle-based stockbrokers Wise Speke, and Mr Robert
Walther, investment director of the Clerical Medical and General Life
Assurance Society.

NORTH SEA oil workers are now getting a taste of home while at sea --
with curry becoming one of the most sought-after dishes on offshore
menus.
The days of a diet of fish suppers, roast beef and mince and tatties
being sufficient to satisfy appetites are gone. So much so that an
Indian chef has been hired to feed the men in exile on the rigs.
Mr Rajiv ''Joe'' Pathak takes up his master chef role officially
tomorrow, secure in the knowledge that he will have an appreciative
clientele -- according to a recent survey, what the workers miss most
about being at sea is not their womenfolk but their curries.
Mr Bob Cotton, spokesman for caterers Gardner Merchant, said: ''Curry,
in all its shapes and flavours, has emerged as a clear favourite.''
Mr Pathak, 35, from Glasgow, spent years working at the Indian Cottage
restaurant in Kirkintilloch and now has his own restaurant, the Prestige
of India.
He said: ''Life on the rigs can be a pretty lonely affair and the men
really look forward to their food. The majority of them are high earners
and as such are pretty discerning diners, so it is only fair to give
them authentic cuisine.''
After two trial tastings the men are already converted. ''There's been
a tremendous response'' said Mr Pathak. ''Feeding 200 to 500 men in the
space of a couple of hours is a fairly daunting task, but they are
appreciative and it is worth every moment.
''I suppose it must have been difficult trying to order a takeaway
from the middle of the ocean.''
Gardner Merchant now plans to supplement its specialised offshore
staff with Italian and Chinese chefs. ''Curry might be a hot favourite''
said Mr Cotton, ''but not even bears can eat it every day.''
