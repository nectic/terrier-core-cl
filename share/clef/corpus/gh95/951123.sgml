AN initiative has been launched which could boost the earnings of the region's
food and drink industry by up to #110m by 1998. The aim of Scottish Enterprise
Tayside's Food and Drink Strategy is to increase the industry's annual turnover
by 33% to #445m, with exports rising by 60%, from their 1994 level of #25m up
to #40m in 1998.
Central to the strategy will be a scheme to assist selected companies to enter
new markets, and the successful Meet the Buyer programme will continue to
introduce Tayside companies to top retailers.
The focus will be on structured initiatives, progressed and funded in distinct
stages, while ensuring companies gain improved access to vital market
information.
The Perth Food Festival in 1994 and 1995 helped to promote Perth and
Perthshire's food producers and traders and enhance the area's reputation as
home to some of Scotland's finest hotels, pubs and restaurants.
It is also a festival for local people, all of whom are invited to take part in
the series of events which this year took place over nine days in May. The
Perth Partnership stepped in to support the Festivals' promotional activities,
and the Perth City Hotel Managers' Association organised the programme of
events.
Highlight of the festival was the Gala Dinner in May, which brought together 12
Perthshire chefs and their teams to produce a seven-course banquet.
As the association's chairman, Douglas Stanfield, of the Station Hotel, said:
``It is unusual in that it brings together different hotels which would
normally be competing with each other.''
Since it was established in 1979 Highland Spring Ltd has invested more than
#30m establishing one of the most modern natural mineral water plants in Europe
at Blackford in Perthshire.
Today it is the largest producer of natural mineral water in the UK, and
exports to more than 30 countries world-wide. The company is the largest
employer in Blackford, with some 130 staff.
The 1995 figures from the British Market Research Bureau show that Highland
Spring retained its No.1 slot for the third year running as Britain's favourite
bottled water.
A light, fresh water with a clean taste and low mineral content, it is
available as still, light sparkling or sparkling.
The water is sourced from the Ochil Hills in Perthshire, and its catchment area
of 2000 acres is protected so that the source is completely free from any kind
of farming, industry or building. This prevents pesticides, fertilisers or
animals from polluting the rainfall as it slowly filters through the rich
mineral-bearing rock strata.
Rainwater takes some 30 years to reach the source hundreds of feet below the
Ochil Hills. The rainfall absorbs the natural minerals as it passes through
thousands of fissures in the layers of rock.
To qualify as a ``natural mineral water'', strict EU and UK regulations must be
met. The water must undergo tests which can take up to two years and be bottled
at source, receiving no treatment other than filtering.
A Perth company which has more than doubled its workforce in the past 18 months
has had its plans for continued growth boosted by a major grant from the
European Union.
Perth Fresh Meat Ltd, which has more than 350 employees at two sites on the
Inveralmond Industrial Estate, has been awarded #275,000 under an EU initiative
to assist firms which process and market agricultural products.
The grant, which was won with the aid of Scottish Enterprise Tayside, will help
to spur on the firm's plans to increase the Perth workforce by up to a further
150 employees over the next two years.
A key supplier of packaged beef, lamb, and game to leading UK supermarket
chains and the export market, the company will use the funding to invest in
leading-edge packaging technology.
Morris Bond, chairman and chief executive of the Beck Food Group, parent
company of Perth Fresh Meat Ltd, said: ``Last year we succeeded in winning
significant new business with some of the UK's top retailers.
``I am delighted that we have been successful in obtaining this grant from the
EU which will help our company to continue its expansion into these markets.''
Alastair Byres, responsible for the food and drink sector with Scottish
Enterprise Tayside, said: ``This award will enable one of Perth's major
employers to win new orders in an intensely competitive market.''

INDIAN negotiators have offered guerrilla abductors a deal to free a Western
hostage in Kashmir, a senior official said today.
The official, who declined to be named, told foreign correspondents in Srinagar
that India could offer a guarantee to Al-Faran militants through independent
diplomats that jailed militant Masood Azhar would be tried speedily, possibly
leading to his freedom.
The negotiators are trying to secure the release of American Don Hutchings,
said to be critically ill. Hutchings is known to be suffering from frostbite.
A senior official said today that Briton Paul Wells, who was suffering from
viral fever, had now recovered.
Fellow Briton Keith Mangan and German Dirk Hasert are the other hostages,
kidnapped while trekking in the Himalayan region. A fifth captive, Norwegian
Hans Christian Ostroe, was found beheaded on August 13.
The latest approach over Hutchings signalled an easing of procedures linked to
tough anti-terrorist laws, under which suspected terrorists can be held in
custody for long periods without trial.
Officials in Srinagar, the summer capital of the troubled Jammu and Kashmir
state, confirmed Al-Faran's offer for the exchange of a sick hostage earlier
this week.
India has officially refused to exchange prisoners for hostages, but says it is
willing to release Kashmiri prisoners as part of a routine review. It has ruled
out a rescue raid, saying it could endanger the lives of the hostages.
A senior official in Srinagar, who declined to be named, had said earlier this
week that Al-Faran wanted India to free Azhar, a leader of the Pakistan-based
Muslim group Harkat-ul-Ansar.
Indian officials say Harkat-ul-Ansar has a large number of Afghan war
activists, helping a five-year-old rebellion in the province - the only state
in India with a majority of Muslims - where some 20,000 have been killed since
1990.
After Al-Faran captured the tourists in July, it demanded the release of 22
jailed separatists, including three members of Harkat-ul-Ansar, in exchange for
the hostages.
It later softened its demand, asking for the release of 15 separatists
including Harkat-ul-Ansar members.
India claims Al-Faran, which was unknown before the kidnappings, is a front for
Harkat-ul-Ansar, and accuses Pakistan of arming and training guerrillas
spearheading the separatist revolt in the disputed region.
Pakistan, which rules over one third of Kashmir, says it provides only
diplomatic and moral support to the rebels.-Reuter.

FOR many people one of the great appeals of working in Perth and Kinross
District is the chance to live in one of the area's attractive small towns and
villages, such as Crieff.
Today the town's residents and its visitors are a far cry from the bandits,
horse thieves and drovers who congregated in this frontier town on the fringe
of the Highlands in the years up to the '45 uprising.
Set on a steep hill facing south over the valley of the River Earn at the hub
of old drove roads, Crieff was once a thriving cattle market. In Victorian
times it became a spa town, and the Crieff Hydro is nowadays an institution
among families who enjoy healthy, traditional holidays.
Many of the town's 6000 residents commute the 17 miles to Perth for work at at
Gloags, Bells or General Accident, however, this population is swelled by
visitors in the summer. There is no rail station but new roads and the Dunblane
by-pass mean that the town is only about an hour's drive from Glasgow and
Edinburgh.
Surrounding Crieff are visitor attractions such as Buchan Pottery, Innerpeffray
Library and the Glenturret distillery. Tourism provides the main employment in
the town, with some 250 staff working at the recently reopened Crieff Hydro.
The Hydro and its many facilities, include tennis, swimming, yoga, riding and a
golf centre, attracts 110,000 visitors a year. Residents can also enjoy the
leisure facilities at the hotel's Lagoon Club.
Many of the shops in Crieff set out their stalls for tourists and between a
mixture of craft shops and national stores are a host of cafes and eating
places. The Athena Greek restaurant currently enjoys preference among many.
Crieff primary, St Dominics and Crieff High School provide schooling in the
public sector and, Ardvreck preparatory school and Morrisons Academy for day
pupils and boarders, in the independent.
Golf, hunting, shooting, fishing and watersports are all on the doorstep. And
in Macrosty Park tennis, putting, and picnic spots can be enjoyed amid acres of
pleasant walks.
There are many traditional Victorian and Edwardian residential properties in
Crieff, especially around the Hydro on the north side of town, as well as some
older flats and new build.
Tay Homes has a development on the eastern edge of town. On the western edge,
Bett is building four-bedroom family homes, and in the town Thomas Mitchell is
building bungalows. Other streets have been developed on a small scale by local
builders such as Shaws, Dodds and George McOmish. New development was limited
until recently by the town's sewage capacity.
Kate Beattie, a resident for eight years and property manager at Drysdale
Anderson, said: ``We are minutes from the countryside and I go hillwalking to
Aberfeldy on a Sunday. Countryside properties are always popular. Everyone is
looking for an idyllic cottage set in a few acres with a stream and roses by
the door.''
The property market in Crieff tends to be locally based, using local estate
agents. Nik Mayall, of Clark Thomson in Crieff, said: ``Houses are considerably
cheaper here than in Dunblane and Perth. Stone-built semis costing #85,000 to
#90,000 in Crieff would cost #120,000 in Perth, and the differential in
stone-built detached is even greater.''
The holiday home market is small but busy. Helen Tocher, at General Accident
Property in Perth, said: ``We are often asked about Crieff. In some months we
have up to a dozen houses, and then none for a month or two.''

HONG KONG: Governor Chris Patten has vowed to veto any attempt by China to set
up a rival government-in-waiting well ahead of the 1997 handover.
He was responding to predictions by an influential Hong Kong adviser to
Beijing, who set alarm bells ringing in the colony when he said China would
establish a shadow government about six months before the deadline.
Talks offered
ABUJA: Nigeria's military government said it was willing to hold talks with the
Commonwealth to resolve the row over the hanging of nine minority rights
activists. ``We resolved to educate our friends, who were hoodwinked into
taking their positions,'' said junta member Commodore Victor Ombu.
Graf: `no deal'
BONN: The Finance Minister of Steffi Graf's home state of Baden-Wuerttemberg
yesterday denied striking any preferential financial deals with the German
tennis star, who is under investigation for suspected tax evasion. Gerhard
Mayer-Vorfelder was being questioned by a parliamentary committee investigating
the case. Graf's imprisoned father Peter is expected to appear before it next
month.
Bible found
BONN: The Latin Bible used by Protestant reformer Martin Luther to translate
Christianity's holy book into German has been found after being lost for over
200 years. The volume, signed by Luther and covered with notes he made in its
margins, was among thousands of Bibles stored at the Wuerttemberg State Library
in Stuttgart, its librarian claimed.
Iraqi blast
NICOSIA: An opposition broadcast claimed a local headquarters of the country's
ruling Baath party was blown up in northern Iraq last week, killing 12 security
guards and wounding more than 20.
Rapists lose
STRASBOURG: The European Court of Human Rights has upheld decisions by British
courts to send two men to jail for raping their wives despite their protests
that 17th-century rulings effectively said this was not a crime. The two men
were sentenced to three and five years in prison in 1990 and 1991.
Polio drive
NEW DELHI: Some 75 million Indian children under four will be vaccinated
against polio next month in one of the most ambitious chapters of a worldwide
drive to eradicate the crippling disease by the end of the century. Rotary
International is helping to fund and organise the drive.
It's just bull
CANBERRA: Australia's sex industry is attempting to stop the export of tons of
bull's penises to Asia, claiming they do not work as a male aphrodisiac. ``The
libido-enhancing claims are fraudulent in the extreme,'' said Robbie Swan, a
spokesman for the Eros Foundation. ``They are about as much use as a bull's
tongue.''
Skyscraper fire
NEW YORK: Fifteen people were slightly injured and the Empire State Building
was evacuated on Tuesday night when an electrical fire sent smoke spiralling
from the basement up through the famous Manhattan skyscraper.
Landmine plea
GENEVA: The Red Cross is launching its first global advertising campaign, to
swing public opinion in a battle against landmines, which kill 2000 people per

Clancy duped
WASHINGTON: Thriller writer Tom Clancy, author of The Hunt for Red October, was
reportedly the biggest loser in an alleged #4m shares fraud. He told the
Washington Post he invested almost #1m of his own money and #350,000 on behalf
of others in what authorities said was an illegal, unregistered mutual fund
after striking up a friendship with Virginian Richard Scott during a baseball
game.

A WOMAN will tonight publicly plead for a court to let her mother die, in a
case which will make legal history.
In Scotland's first ``right to die'' case, the Court of Session in Edinburgh
will decide next week if Mrs Janet Johnson, 53, should have her feeding tube
withdrawn.
She has been in a ``persistent vegetative state'' for three years with no
evident hope of recovery.
Her daughter, Ms Linda Bryce, will tell TV viewers tonight: ``I just hope the
court give us the sanction and let her go, because it'll be the kindest thing
they ever do, kinder to my mother and kinder to the family.
``She definitely died three and a half years ago. It's definitely not my mother
in that bed,'' she tells BBC Scotland's Frontline Scotland TV programme.
In a landmark ruling in England, the House of Lords ruled that Hillsborough
football stadium victim Tony Bland could have his artificial feeding tube
withdrawn, but Mrs Johnston's is the first case in Scottish law.
Law Hospital in Lanarkshire and Mrs Johnston's family are agreed that she
should be allowed to die with dignity, but the case is going to the Court of
Session as the legal position in Scotland is unclear.

Frankfurt, Wednesday
NICK LEESON was tonight on a plane bound for Singapore to stand trial on
charges relating to the #860m collapse of Barings Bank.
The former trader and his wife Lisa had an hour-long meeting this morning at
the Frankfurt jail where he has been held for nearly nine months.
Afterwards he spent about two hours talking to his British and Singapore
lawyers Stephen Pollard and John Koh.
``He's pretty positive and he's ready to get on with it,'' Mr Koh said before
the meeting. He added that his client was prepared to tell the truth.
Hoechst prison governor Hadmut Jung-Silberreis said 28-year-old Leeson had left
the jail alone and unhandcuffed after saying ``friendly'' goodbyes to a number
of prison staff.
The 12-hour flight was due to arrive in Singapore tomorrow afternoon.
A reporter on board the aircraft said Mr Leeson, wearing a Manchester City
shirt under a grey-green track suit, was flying on the upper deck of the jumbo
jet, in business class.
He was accompanied by his wife, Mr Pollard, and Mr Koh.
Mr Leeson is being extradited to stand trial on 11 charges of fraud and forgery
in a trial expected to start before Christmas.
German police took him to the airport, where he was arrested on March 2 in the
wake of the bank's crash, and handed him over to the custody of Singaporean
officials in the offices of the border police.
Rumours of his extradition had been fuelled by an announcement by airport
officials that the visitors' terrace would be closed shortly before the
take-off of a non-stop Singapore Airlines flight.
Police armed with machine-guns surrounded the aircraft more than an hour before
departure on the flight and passengers checking in for flight SQ325 were put
through intensive luggage checks.
Hordes of foreign journalists have converged on Singapore for his return.
Mr Leeson dropped his fight against extradition to Singapore last month and
apologised for doubting that he would receive a fair trial.
His dramatic U-turn followed publication of the island's official report into
the crash, which blamed the management of Barings for the bank's collapse,
allaying fears that he would be made a scapegoat.
The charges he faces carry a maximum 14-year sentence, but lawyers suggest he
could expect to receive three to six years if he pleads guilty.

TEENAGER Kelly Holland - found hanged in her cell in Cornton Vale Prison near
Stirling in June - could have taken crucial evidence about the unsolved death
of Hamilton student Amanda Duffy to her grave.
The fatal accident inquiry that opened yesterday into the deaths of Kelly and
fellow inmate Arlene Elliot, both 17, heard evidence from Kelly's father and
Arlene's mother of the changes in their daughters from confident schoolgirls to
suicidal teenagers.
Arlene's mother, Roseanne McKay, 40, of Caledonian Crescent, Edinburgh, said
drink and drugs had ruined her daughter's life. She said that until she was 14,
Arlene was a quiet girl. ``She used to play the cello and go to church. The
drugs changed her,'' she said.
But the most dramatic evidence came from Kelly's father, Mr Edward Holland, 44.
He said Kelly, of Hillhouse Road, Hamilton, changed overnight from cheerful
schoolgirl to suicidal teenager when she went missing in May, 1992.
Mr Holland told the inquiry: ``She was missing at the same time that Amanda
Duffy was found murdered in Hamilton. She was found 100 yards from where
Amanda's body was found.
``Whether she saw anything, we don't know, but I thought there was a dramatic
change in Kelly since then. She had been so bright in school it made you happy
inside to talk about her.''
Mr Holland said his daughter immediately began to exhibit signs of self-harm.
She was found wandering the streets of Newcastle with a bottle of 100
paracetamol tablets in her pocket.
She was sent to Kerelaw Assessment Centre in Ayrshire, where she was found cut
and bleeding, apparently after falling through a window.
She was sent to a psychiatric hospital in Livingston, where she cut her hands
and face. She continued to try to harm herself - throwing herself out of a
second-floor window just a few weeks before she died.
He said: ``We asked all sorts of people for help - social workers,
psychiatrists, key workers. Nobody gave us any answers.''
Mr Holland said his daughter's behaviour became increasingly bizarre. She would
go missing for days at a time, always leaving the house by the window, never
the door. When she was found again, she did not seem to realise where she was.
He said a noose had been found in her cell at Cornton Vale during previous
remands, and he and his wife had tried repeatedly to warn the prison
authorities she was suicidal.
The inquiry heard that Kelly was remanded in custody by a sheriff at Hamilton
on June 23 after being arrested for being disorderly.
Police who picked her up in a Hamilton park found her hiding a piece of broken
glass up her sleeve.
A deputy prosecutor in the procurator-fiscal's office in Hamilton was so
concerned that she telephoned police at the court to ask them to warn Cornton
Vale that Kelly might try to kill herself.
But Constable Adam Angus, whom the depute fiscal had said she had telephoned,
claimed he never received any such call.
Mr Holland, who was in court the day his daughter was remanded in custody, said
she was very distressed as she was led to the cells, and he had intended to
phone the prison the next day to warn staff she could be suicidal.
He never got the chance. She was found hanged in her cell at 1.30am.
Arlene, of Dumbarton Road, Glasgow, was found hanged in her cell four days
later.
Both parents criticised the prison system for not taking better care of their
daughters.
The inquiry continues.
Amanda Duffy's father, Mr Joe Duffy, said yesterday it would be tragic if Kelly
had kept quiet about information about his daughter's death and taken it to the
grave.
He said he wanted to talk to Kelly's father about his suspicions.

CHILDREN as young as 11 are already worrying about their weight, their health,
and their job prospects, a major survey of schoolchildren in the West of
Scotland revealed yesterday.
The Medical Research Council, which published the findings, said most of the
3000 children in the study were healthy, happy, and optimistic about the future.
Nevertheless Drs Patrick West and Helen Sweeting, from the council's Medical
Sociology Unit at Glasgow University, were taken aback at the number who had
been suffering symptoms of physical or psychological problems.
More than half said they had had headaches, stomach aches, and colds or flu
during the previous month, and one in three said they had been unhappy or had
difficulty sleeping.
Other complaints included loneliness outside school (19%), in school (9%),
being teased (14%), and being bullied (5%). All of these experiences were
associated with poorer psychological health and lower self-esteem.
The researchers found that 11% of girls and 7% of boys were on diets of one
sort or another.
``We don't know how many were on diets prescribed by their doctors for medical
reasons,'' Dr West said yesterday.
The findings are the first to be released from a research project that will
track the 3000 through from their final year at primary school until the age of
16 and possibly beyond, with the aim of mapping out the factors that influence
teenage lifestyles.
Dr West said the findings called into question the traditional idea that this
particular age was the healthiest time in people's lives.

THE 200 miners of Monktonhall colliery in Midlothian, who each invested #10,000
to re-open it three years ago as a co-operative, have been offered a #15m
lifeline which would cost them their dream.
Waverley Mining Finance, which helped save the pit, has offered 10,000 ordinary
company shares in exchange for the miners' 51% holding which would mean the
miners losing control. The Waverley shares are currently trading on the stock
market at 100p.
Waverley director Anthony Johnston warned the pit would close if the offer was
rejected.
``We couldn't go on supporting it. The board of Monktonhall would have to take
the decision to just shut it down,'' he said.
Yesterday, miners forecast the offer would be accepted.
Waverley stated that, if the share offer was given the go-ahead, it would
result in #15m being put into the pit, allowing re-investment in machinery, and
the opening of a new coal face which could extend the life of Monktonhall for
at least 16 years.
Ironically, the offer of a financial lifeline from Waverley comes as the 240
miner owners of Tower Colliery in Mid Glamorgan announced profits of #2m,
having invested #8000 each.
Monktonhall has been losing money but Mr Johnston said an investment of #15m
could see production in the opening of a new coal face rising from 275,000
tonnes a year to 540,000, also providing an additional 80 jobs, including
apprenticeships in the industry.
He said the proposed issue of shares would be subscribed by institutions and
current shareholders, amounting to #5.5m, with a similar amount ploughed in by
the company. An additional #4.1m would be received by the Department of Trade
and Industry's coal subsidy scheme.
Should the miners - who have three weeks to decide - accept the share offer,
they would not be allowed to cash them in, or trade them, for three years.
When Waverley stepped in with cash aid, it had 49% of the shares, with the
miners' consortium holding the balance.
Mr Johnston added: ``Yes, it is a buy-out proposal, but we want to protect the
interests of the miners.''
The man who led the battle to reopen Monktonhall, former miner Jackie Aitchison
- now personnel manager at the pit - described the offer as ``fantastic''.
``Not only is it safeguarding jobs and allowing continuity of employment, it is
going to create 80 jobs, which will include trainee miner apprenticeships.''
Shareholder Edward Kimain, 59, of Penicuik, a miner for 30 years - the last
three at Monktonhall - summed up pitmen's feelings.
``It's not too bad really. We have not actually got much choice. If we don't
accept it, we'll lose the pit. This way we'll get something out of it.''
Colleague Paul Davidson, 27, of Edinburgh, said: ``It secures the mine's
future. It is basically good for the company.''
Later yesterday, Midlothian MP Eric Clarke, former general secretary of the
National Union of Mineworkers in Scotland, said: ``I hope the company puts its
money where its mouth is, protecting the jobs of the Monktonhall men, and
providing extra jobs, which I would certainly welcome.''
Mr George Bolton, president of the NUM in Scotland, added: ``There are massive
coal reserves able to be worked from Monktonhall, but it does require
investment in new machinery to reach them.
``It is capable of providing quality coal for the domestic and industrial
market, and if more jobs are available, I am delighted.''

FRANCE'S fourth nuclear test in the South Pacific provoked outrage today while
a French expert expressed doubts that computer simulation could viably replace
actual testing as intended by authorities.
President Jacques Chirac has said France will probably stage six tests rather
than the eight he originally announced in June. But he denied the series has
been cut short because of the protests.
Chirac has promised to sign a treaty banning all tests forever once the series
is completed, by May 31 at the latest. He claims France needs the tests to
validate a new warhead for its submarine-based missiles and acquire simulation
capacity.
However a critic of Chirac with close ties to nuclear-test experts released a
report expressing doubts that France could develop new nuclear weapons in the
future without more live tests.
Jacques Baumel, an MP of Chirac's own Rally for the Republic party but who is
estranged from him, said he was ``sorry the president had excluded the
possibility that France could in the future carry out a further small number of
tests''.
Baumel said the computer simulation programme would cost F16bn (#1980m) instead
of the F10.5bn (#1350m) initially estimated. He further claimed it was unclear
where F2.5bn (#320m) of the total would come from.
He added that the programme would depend on delivery by the United States of
advanced giant computers of a type France had been effectively barred from
purchasing in the past.
Specialists said Baumel's statement was seen as part of a running campaign by
backers of defeated presidential candidate Edouard Balladur to snipe at Chirac
rather than an attempt to change policies.
Meanwhile in Wellington, Greenpeace staged a rooftop protest at the British
High Commission against the ``UK-French entente nucleaire''.
Eight protesters wearing masks of Prime Minister John Major and French
President Jacques Chirac climbed on to the roof unfurling ``Union Jacques''
flags and blowing hooters and whistles.
The demonstration lasted about an an hour and ended after a Greenpeace
spokesman met with a commission representative.
Asian nations unequivocally condemned the latest test. Japan's Foreign Minister
Yohei Kono summoned French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Ouvrieu to lodge a formal
protest.
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, who has announced a campaign to rid the
world of nuclear weapons, said he was appalled.
``(France) has further isolated itself from international thinking on nuclear
issues and significantly devalued its international credentials,'' Keating
said.
In Seoul, South Korean protesters tossed scores of eggs at the premises of the
French embassy over its main gate. ``Stop nuclear testing'', they wrote with
paint on the road.
A small group of Greenpeace activists also set up road signs at the
Franco-German border today, warning motorists heading into France that they
were entering a country which carries out nuclear tests.
``Warnung, Atomteststaat'' (Warning, State Carrying Out Nuclear Tests''), read
the signs erected east of the French city of Strasbourg. There were
demonstrations at other border crossings.
The first test in the current series took place on September 5, the second on
October 2 and the third on October 27.-Reuter.

Colombo, Wednesday
A PLANE belonging to the Sri Lankan Air Force was feared to have crashed into
the sea today with 62 people on board, air force sources said.
They said the Antonov aircrafttook off from the Ratamalana air base near
Colombo at 1150 GMT headed for the northern Palaly base.
It got in touch with the northern Jaffna control tower before disappearing
without trace off the Karinagar naval base.
The sources said the Russian-built AN-32 plane had 54 troops, six air force
personnel and two crew members on board.
There was speculation that the plane had suffered a technical problem or come
under a guerrilla attack, they added.
The air force lost a Chinese-built Y-8 cargo plane on Saturday when it was shot
down over the sea off the Palaly airbase. Only one of five officers on board
survived.
Another AN-32 crashed mysteriously into the sea near Colombo last month killing
more than 70 troops.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam shot down two British-made Avro transport
planes at Palaly in April killing 90 servicemen and showing the world that the
rebels, fighting for a homeland in the north and east, possessed surface-to-air
missiles.
On October 17, Sri Lanka's military launched a massive advance on Jaffna town
from Palaly and the troops are now surrounding the town, which is believed to
be largely deserted.
Any final push is expected to be painstakingly slow as the troops pick their
way through mines and other booby-traps.
Army commandos today cut off a key supply route for up to 2000 rebels believed
to be holed up in the northern town.
The army also banned travel on the Jaffna Lagoon, tightening control over the
main waterway used by civilians and Tiger rebels to reach the mainland from the
northern peninsula.
A military statement said the capture of the Jaffna-Kandy highway, the main
supply route for the town, followed a fierce battle on Tuesday afternoon in
which 45 rebels were killed and more than 100 wounded in the Ariyalai area, in
the eastern suburbs of Jaffna.
The battle for Jaffna is now being waged by the army's elite reserve strike
force of commandos, better trained for fighting in urban areas, who took over
from regular soldiers on Monday.-Reuter

<TEXT>
POPE John Paul yesterday urged Irish electors to block the introduction of
divorce in a referendum tomorrow.
Speaking to Irish pilgrims in Rome, the Pope called for reflection before
voting on ``the unbreakable bond of marriage''.
The papal comment came with opinion polls pointing to a tight finish in the
nationwide divorce poll.
Though a ``yes'' vote has been backed by all government and parliamentary
opposition parties, surveys have highlighted a steady drift away from the
referendum recommendation to scrap Ireland's constitutional ban on divorce.
Two months ago, around 60% of the electorate were behind divorce. The most
recent poll this week showed 45% for the reform, 42% against, and 13% still
undecided.
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and his deputy, Mr Dick Spring, were launching
final appeals for support yesterday.
But anti-divorce campaigners reported increasing confidence that the law change
would be turned down.
In what could prove to be an important intervention, the Pope said Irish people
should pray more intensely for ``the welfare of marriage and family in
Ireland''.

THE controversial scheme to give parents a #1100 voucher for the purchase of
nursery and other pre-school places for their three or four-year-olds became
the focus of a row between the Scottish Office Education Minister and Labour
spokeswoman Helen Liddell yesterday.
Mrs Liddell said it was time for Mr Raymond Robertson to ``grow up'' after he
dismissed Opposition criticisms of the scheme as no more than ``the tired
jargon of political abuse''.
The Minister's comments are contained in a letter to Mrs Liddell which was
released yesterday.
Mrs Liddell had written to Mr Robertson about the scheme after a survey showed
that only 16% of respondents to the Scottish Office consultation exercise on
vouchers supported the creation of a marketplace for nursery education.
She wondered how he could justify such a ``flawed and unworkable'' proposal
which was being rushed through for political gain - amounting to a pre-election
bribe damaging to pre-five education.
Mrs Liddell added that more stringent inspection methods than the
``light-touch'', self-monitoring proposals put forward by the Government were
essential, and expressed concern about appointing a private company to
administer what looked like being a costly bureaucratic nightmare.
Bids have been invited for the year-long pilot scheme beginning in August which
the Government has earmarked for testing vouchers, and Mrs Liddell said the
strictest of conditions should apply to it.
In his reply, Mr Robertson said the Scottish Office planned to learn as much as
possible from the pilot.
He continued: ``You say that `light-touch' inspection is not acceptable, yet at
the same time you suggest that our proposals are bureaucratic. You must make up
your mind.
``What we intend is a system which has firm and robust quality guarantees, but
not one which is tangled heavy-handedly in red tape.''
The appointment of a business services company to handle the voucher pilots
throughout the UK would bring economies of scale, he predicted.
Mr Robertson reminded Mrs Liddell that the Educational Institute of Scotland
had recently accused Ministers of delaying nursery education in a ploy to save
money.
``I am left feeling that if we are attacked both for going too fast and for
going too slowly, we have probably got things about right,'' he said.
Mrs Liddell said last night that she had hoped for a ``more mature response''
to what were crucial, unanswered questions about vouchers.

MASSIVE disruption of postal services throughout the UK was threatened last
night after peace talsk collapsed. They had been an attempt to resolve a
dispute which was originally triggered by unofficial action by workers at a
local office in Edinburgh.
Thousands of Scottish postal staff had earlier yesterday come out in support of
their Portobello colleagues.
Talks had got under way last night in Edinburgh after more than 1000 workers in
Glasgow had voted unanimously to continue their unofficial strike action.
Following the failure of the talks to resolve the dispute, which will leave
most of central Scotland without any deliveries today, divisional officer for
the Communication Workers Union, Mr George Robertson, said last night: ``We
tried to put something to Royal Mail that would have been a way forward to
settle the original dispute at Portobello but they rejected it.'' He added:
``We will continue to tell our members to go back to work but it looks as
though the dispute goes on.''
A Royal Mail spokesman said he hoped talks would resume today.
The spread of the unofficial action is like a domino effect. As one sorting
office takes action, management steps in and delivers mail to another office,
where the postal workers walk out in protest at the management's
strike-breaking tactics.
One senior trade union official called for an end to the ``madness'' and a
leading Scots businessmen forecast a ``devastating'' impact on the country's
business community.
The workers attending meetings in Glasgow and Edinburgh were given letters
saying their action was repudiated by the CWU, an attempt to stop Royal Mail
management from taking it to court where it could face punitive fines for
unofficial action.
Union officials had planned to hold a ballot for official industrial action but
ballot papers had been held up in the post by the dispute.
Mr John Keggie, CWU divisional officer, said the situation was becoming
``crazier by the day'' and there were fears of huge delays for Christmas.
Around 4000 staff throughout Scotland are involved in the action which has
resulted in a huge backlog of mail. Postal and processing staff are involved in
the row over staffing changes.
Mr Peter Dunn, acting director general of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce,
said it was a sad reflection on modern management and employee relationships.
He warned: ``This strike could cost the business community millions. It must be
fairly obvious the business community will not tolerate this too long before it
seeks alternative methods of doing its work.''
Mr Geoff Runcie, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, also warned
customers might use alternative services and not return to the Royal Mail.
There is a strong belief among workers that management is deliberately loading
as much mail as possible into the first delivery so that in time second
deliveries will be eliminated, jobs will be lost, and costs reduced.
Mr Keggie said: ``We are heading into the Christmas period where we want to
operate properly and effectively. At the moment the public are being denied a
service because of management's refusal to negotiate a compromise and a
sensible back-to-work agreement.''
Mr Robertson said members were finding it difficult to work under a
``heavy-handed, bullying, and threatening regime'' imposing unnecessary
changes. He said it had not happened yet but it appeared the dispute was set to
spread over the Border.
The Royal Mail said it was ``bitterly disappointed'' the union had failed to
get staff to give up their illegal strike action.
Delivery director Alex Gibb said: ``This illegal action is taking place because
some members do not want to make changes to improve the service for customers
who want to get their mail as early as possible.
``Claims that Royal Mail is trying to get rid of the second delivery are total
rubbish.''
The Royal Mail said any changes were not new, had been fully worked through
with active staff involvement at Portobello, and agreement had been reached.

<HEADLINE>The 20-year killing spree. Murder mystery of how they kept their secret</HEADLINE>

AS the cell doors closed behind mass murderess Rosemary West, attention
immediately shifted to how she and her husband Fred had managed to carry out
their killing spree undetected for at least 20 years.
There are also fears that the final tally of deaths may never be known.
Sentencing her yesterday to 10 life terms, trial judge Mr Justice Mantell
wasted few words: ``If any attention is paid to what I think, you will never be
released. Take her down.''
It had taken the jury of seven men and four women only two hours to return the
last seven guilty verdicts, unanimously convicting her of murdering 10 young
women and girls.
The jury had decided on the previous day that Rosemary West was a triple
killer, having murdered her Scots-born step-daughter Charmaine, her own
daughter, Heather, and lodger Shirley Ann Robinson, who had been made pregnant
by Frederick West.
Within two hours of the final verdicts being delivered, police admitted they
fear the Wests killed many more than the 12 highlighted during the horrendous
trial at Winchester Crown Court.
Locally people were talking of a figure in excess of 60. There is a good deal
of gossip over killing fields. The police say they just do not know.
In Gloucester alone officers believe nine girls associated with 25 Cromwell
Street could well have been murdered by the Wests.
Yesterday they announced a fresh investigation into the movements of these
girls. They hoped the inquiry might reveal they are still alive. However,
police stressed there would be no digging or searching for possible further
victims in the immediate future.
Other forces, especially Strathclyde Police, are anxious to interview Rosemary
West in a bid to determine if her husband killed while living in Scotland and
if so how many.
The truth is the police do know more young girls have died, but they do not
know where to continue their diggings. It is unlikely for the moment that
Rosemary West will point them in the right direction.
Circumstances surrounding the victims would appear to have made it relatively
simple for the Wests to cover their tracks:
q Only five of the 12 victims discovered during the inquiry were ever
officially reported as missing.
q  Most of them were adult.
q  The victims vanished in different places.
q  Nothing marked most of the disappearances as being out of the ordinary.
Serious questions will also be raised over the social services' involvement
with the West family.
q Medical staff saw some of the West children a total of 16 times over a
period of 14 years.
q Social services were not told of a court case in 1973 in which Fred and
Rosemary West were fined for assaulting a teenage lodger.
q Two of the West children, including the murdered Charmaine, went into social
work care five times.
q Social services had only five contacts over a five-year period, and only one
contact in the 18 years before Fred and Rosemary West were arrested, in 1992.
Still maintaining her innocence, Rosemary West is to appeal. Her lawyer, Mr Leo
Goatley, says she has the support of her family. He said she was devastated by
the verdicts.
Five of her seven living children are in care and their names have been
changed. The press is forbidden from publishing anything that might identify
them in their new lives.
Yesterday Rosemary West had recovered some composure when she returned to the
dock to hear the jury deliver their final verdicts which ensure she goes down
in criminal history as perhaps one of the most evil killers known.
After being detained for some days in the cell specially built for her at
Winchester Prison, it is likely Rosemary West will be transferred to Durham.
There she could meet Moors Murderer Myra Hindley. They are the only two women
in the country who now know they have no chance of ever being released from
prison.
Rosemary West knows that from now on she will not be able to come into contact
with people other than those whose duty it is to guard her. ``She would not
last more than five minutes if she ever tried to mix,'' said one recently
released prisoner who met her in jail.
She was reconciled to her fate when the jury delivered their final verdicts.
Their final decisions came just a little more than 20 minutes after the judge
responsed to two questions put to him in a note.
``Yes,'' was his answer, telling them they could convict in the absence of
direct evidence if they accepted ``similar fact'' evidence that Frederick and
Rosemary West had cruised the streets to pick up young girls to take them back
to Cromwell Street, where they were sexually assaulted.
Immediately the jury retired on this direction from the judge, defence counsel
Mr Richard Ferguson QC objected by declaring Mr Justice Mantell had not given
the jury the defence claim that it was a huge chasm to leap by assuming such
activities made Rosemary West a murderess,
Mr Mantell abruptly dismissed the application by declaring he would not change
his direction to the jury.
In less than half-an-hour the jury returned with unanimous verdicts on seven
counts of murder.
They had been left in no doubt about the horror which must have followed the
abduction by the Wests of these seven girls and young women. They had been
bound, gagged, and taped.
Most horrific of all was the taped mask which covered the head of 15-year-old
Shirley Hubbard, who disappeared in 1974.
Inserted between the tape bindings were plastic breathing tubes. That alone
indicated that these girls were sexually tortured for hours if not days before
they were killed.
The judge told the jury they, like him, might like to believe that their bodies
were dismembered after, rather than before, death.
Immediately the final verdicts were delivered, Mr Justice Mantell did not waste
many words in sentencing Rosemary West to life imprisonment on each one of the
10 murder charges.
At that stage there was a cry of ``hooray'' from the public gallery and someone
else shouted: ``Quite right.''
It was the first and only suggestion of any kind of outburst throughout the
trial, which has lasted almost eight weeks.
Throughout yesterday's proceedings Rosemary West stood impassive before the
judge, her hands folded in front of her.
Upstairs in the public gallery her step-daughter, Mrs Anne Marie Davis, a key
witness for the prosecution, and whose evidence had played a major role in
determining the verdicts, asked a minder next to her to hold on to her arm. She
still slumped to the floor.
Outside the court there was a crowd of about 150. They watched the white prison
van, accompanied by police motorcycle outriders, carry Rosemary West for the
last time on the short journey between court and prison.
It was the nearest Winchester has shown an interest in what has been happening
in their town. ``We only came on this one occasion to make sure that she is
leaving here for ever,'' said one local.
Inside the court the jury was being offered counselling services. The judge had
told them that they would never have a more important job to do in their lives.
Meanwhile it was revealed that the ashes of Rena West and her daughter
Charmaine are to be brought home to Scotland. Mrs Davis hopes that returning
the ashes of her murdered mother and sister to their native Scotland will help
ease the pain.
While Mrs Davis, now aged 31, left Scotland as little more than a toddler, she
considers herself very much Scottish.
She thought her half-sister Charmaine had returned to Scotland to live with
their mother. It was only when the police began to excavate at 25 Midland Road,
Gloucester and at Letterbox Field that she learned the truth.
``As Charmaine and Rena's closest relative, Anne Marie had the remains cremated
together,'' said a friend. ``Now the trial is over she is determined that their
ashes be taken back home to Scotland.''
Fred West maintained until the end that he did not kill his Scottish nannie Ann
McFall, who was carrying his child.
The police discovered her body in a field near the burial ground of Rena West,
his first wife. ``The exception out of the 12 victims found was Ann McFall,''
police said yesterday. ``Frederick West never admitted involvement in the
murder of that young girl.''
Nevertheless he did indicate the field where he thought she might be buried. He
was right. Her remains were recovered.
Meanwhile, the Lord Chancellor commissioned a report into the way key witnesses
in the trial were paid money by the media for their stories.

THE author of an inquiry into the West murders last night demanded a national
shake-up in information networks between child protection agencies as he
published a report showing action could have been taken earlier to protect
youngsters in the family.
Mr John Fitzgerald, director of the independent Bridge Childcare Agency, said
``much more sophisticated'' ways of sharing information between police, health,
social services, and education officials must be found. The Bridge report,
commissioned by Gloucestershire area child protection committee, reveals how
files were opened and closed on different members of the family by various
agencies over a period of more than 30 years.
But no-one made a link or established a connection between events that might
have set alarm bells ringing about possible abuse.
Communication between agencies was rare. Unlike today, there was no requirement
to share information with one another. The report makes a number of
recommendations and claims proper health information is critical to detecting
possible abuse.
Last night, Mr Jeff James, chief executive of Gloucestershire Health, said
there were lessons to be learned in the light of the case.
He added that all the health organisations were reviewing their arrangements
for protecting children and would draw on external advice.

<TEXT>
AN internal inquiry by Gloucester Police has identified nine reasons why the
murders went undetected.
q Only five of the 12 victims were reported as ``missing persons''. The
disappearances of Heather and her half-sister, Charmaine, eight, Catherine
Costello - Fred West's first wife - nanny Anne McFall, and lodger Shirley Anne
Robinson went unreported. The victims who were reported missing - Lynda Gough,
Carole Cooper, Lucy Partington, Therese Siegenthaler, Shirley Hubbard, Alison
Chambers, and Juanita Mott - had no known connection with each other.
q The victims vanished in different places, ranging from London and Worcester
to Cheltenham and Gloucester.
q Most were adult ``missing persons''. During the seventies, thousands of
people were reported missing each year - most of whom turned up alive in due
course.
q There was nothing remarkable about the disappearances, except for Lucy
Partington. Her disappearance on the night of December 27, 1973, was given
considerable local and national publicity.
q There was no apparent link to Cromwell Street. Some of the victims were
abducted, or were on the run from local authority care, or had lodged at 25
Cromwell Street, or were members of the West family. There was no apparent
pattern of kidnappings. Victims vanished on weekdays, at weekends, and at
differing times of day and night. No-one saw anything.
q Some victims had been in care. Shirley Hubbard was fostered in Droitwich when
she was six, Alison Chambers often absconded from local authority care in
Gloucester, Carole Cooper was staying at a children's home in Worcester when
she disappeared, while Shirley Robinson was in care for petty offences. Their
backgrounds perhaps only became significant after police discovered 25 Cromwell
Street was a haven for the runaways.
q Gloucestershire had only a small police force. With just over 1000 officers
to cover the whole county in the early seventies, missing persons inquiries
were noted by constables and sergeants, with an inspector reviewing progress
later, and officers generally acted on information from relatives. Limited
resources meant few in-depth investigations.
q The time scale. The Cromwell Street killings went undetected for more than 20
years. The victims had to be seen against a background of thousands of adults
who went missing over that period.
q The secrecy of the murdererers. Frederick and Rosemary West wanted their
activities to remain secret and were prepared to kill to ensure this.
One senior officer on the inquiry said: ``Those who died were to some extent
victims of their time . . . just missing persons in a foot-loose society. Even
given today's sophisticated detection and publicity methods, it is perhaps
unlikely that their deaths would have been detected earlier.''

Charmaine
West
SPRING 71: Fred West's step-daughter from his marriage to his first wife,
Catherine.
West was living with Rose, though they were not yet married, when Charmaine
disappeared, aged eight. During the trial the court heard of Rose's dislike for
Charmaine which was often directed at the girl through violence.
After spending periods in care, Charmaine went to live with Fred and Rose at 25
Midland Road, Gloucester and disappeared in the spring of 1971.
Charmaine had gone to live with her mother. However her mother, Catherine had
already been murdered by Fred.
Charmaine's remains were discovered buried under the kitchen window at 25
Midland Road on the tenth day of the search. Fragments of coal were found with
the bones, evidence that Charmaine's body had been stowed in the coal cellar
before her burial.
Lynda
Gough
APRIL 73: The eldest of three children, Lynda left school to become a
seamstress in Gloucester. She was known to have been friendly with lodgers at
25 Cromwell Street.
Shortly before her 20th birthday she moved out of her parents' home to a flat
in Gloucester, and then vanished. Her parents reported her missing, but there
was no trace of her.
Lynda's mother visited 25 Cromwell Street in search of her daughter. The woman
who answered the door was wearing Lynda's slippers, and some of her clothes
were hanging on the clothes line. Mrs Gough was told that her daughter had
moved away.
Her remains were found in a former car inspection pit in a garage, which had
been converted into a bathroom, at 25 Cromwell Street. With the remains was two
separate pieces of tape, a bootlace and fragments of fabric.
Carol Ann
Cooper
NOVEMBER 73: The first victim buried in the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street,
Carole Ann was just 15.
Her parents separated in 1962, and she went to live with her mother. After her
mother's death she lived with her father, who had remarried, but was placed in
care in 1971.
Known as Cass, she was in the care of Worcestershire County Council and living
in a council home in Worcester. She was last seen getting on a bus to return
there after a night out.
She was not known to have had any connections with the Wests, and detectives
concluded that they picked her up while she was hitch-hiking.
Her remains, decapitated and dismembered, were found under the cellar floor. It
is believed she had been bound and suffered sexual abuse before being killed.
Around her skull was the remnant of an elasticated gag.
Lucy
Partington
DECEMBER 73: A Medieval English student at Exeter University, Lucy, 21,
disappeared two days after Christmas, 1973, while on the way home from a visit
to a friend.
It is thought that the Wests picked her up as she waited for a bus to her home
at Gretton, near Winchcombe.
The trial was told that Lucy, a gentle and chaste girl, was not the sort of
person who would have any social contact with Fred and Rose West, and she would
never have gone to the house voluntarily.
Her remains, decapitated and dismembered, were found under the floor of the
cellar at 25 Cromwell Street. There were pieces of cord tied around the skull.
Seven days after Lucy disappeared, Fred West went to hospital with a cut on his
hand which, the prosecution said, indicated that Lucy may have been held alive
in the cellar, the victim of sexual abuse, for a week.
Therese
Siegenthaler
APRIL 74: Swiss-born Therese, 21, a sociology student at Woolwich Polytechnic
in London, set out to hitch-hike to Ireland to visit a friend who was a priest.
She had no known connection with Fred and Rosemary West.
An experienced hitch-hiker, she had planned to make her way from London to
Holyhead to catch a ferry to Ireland, and was due to return to friends in north
London on April 21. She was reported missing two days later.
Her remains, decapitated and dismembered, were found under the floor of the
cellar at 25 Cromwell Street, where they had been forced into a small area.
Near her skull were the remains of sticky tape, which appeared to have been
used as some form of gag.
Prosecution counsel Brian Leveson told the court: ``How she got to Cromwell
Street, the Crown cannot say. She must have been abducted.''
Juanita
Mott
APRIL 75: The second of three sisters, Juanita was 18, and had left her family
home in Gloucester soon after leaving school. Her parents had split up.
She lived in various bedsits in the Gloucester area, including 25 Cromwell
Street, and worked as a bottler with a local soft drinks firm.
Juanita had promised to take care of her landlady's children while she attended
a wedding, but she disappeared the night before.
Her decapitated and dismembered remains were found in the cellar of 25 Cromwell
Street. Lengths of looped and knotted rope were found with the bones, and
material, apparently from her own clothes, was wrapped around her head.
Soon after Juanita's death, the floor of the cellar - the bodies beneath
arranged neatly - was concreted over, and the room was turned into a bedroom
for the Wests' children.
Shirley Anne
Robinson
MAY 78: The Wests' lodger and Fred's lover, to whom she became pregnant, she
flaunted the pregnancy early on, but later attempted to distance herself from
the family, apparently to avoid Rose West's mounting jealousy.
From a broken home and under the supervision of Gloucester Social Services,
Shirley Anne typified the Wests' victims, drawn by their apparent friendliness
and the offer of a home.
Last seen when eight months pregnant, staff at the benefits office tried to
contact her and were told that she had moved away from Cromwell Street, leaving
no forwarding address.
The Wests told people she was in Germany and had given birth to a son, Barry.
Shirley Anne's body, and her unborn child, had been buried in the garden of 25
Cromwell street. Her right leg had been amputated.
Alison
Chambers
AUGUST 79: Born in Germany, where her father was in the Army, Alison, 16, was
taken into care after her parents split up, and later moved to a children's
home in Gloucester, from where she went missing on a number of occasions.
Described as ``a bit of a rebel'', she was a frequent visitor at 25 Cromwell
Street, and was known to have lesbian tendencies. Rosemary West, who was also
keen on lesbian sex, began to lure her into her confidence.
Alison wrote to her mother saying she had left the children's home and was
living with a ``homely'' family, doing the housework and caring for their
children. She had left her job in a solicitor's office.
Her remains were found in the garden at 25 Cromwell Street. She had been
dismembered. Around her skull was fastened a buckled belt, which was intended
to silence her screams as she was abused.
Heather
West
1987: The first body discovered at 25 Cromwell Street, Heather, 16, was the
last known victim of the Wests' serial of murders.
Fred and Rosemary's first child, born prior to their marriage while they lived
at 25 Midland Road, she was never reported missing by her parents, though they
pretended to several people that they had.
The Wests concocted several stories to explain her disappearance - gone to
Wales with a lesbian, run away from home, or was living in Gloucester or
Brockworth and was regularly in contact.
Rosemary West claimed she had given Heather #600, but could not explain where
she drew the money from.
The truth was simple and grisly, Heather had been murdered and dismembered, and
buried under the garden patio.
Before any of the other bodies were found, Fred West had told police he alone
was responsible for her murder, the final lie to be laid to rest.
Heather's former headmaster remembered her as a ``very pleasant'' girl.

STEVE Munro, the former Scotland winger, has told the Diary that his club, Ayr,
is to hold a crisis meeting on Wednesday at which the future of the club is to
be discussed.
I gather that there is deep unrest at the club, and suspicion about the funding
of three New Zealanders who are at Millbrae but do not have jobs.
Munro, and fellow club member Malcolm Wilkinson, are to make presentations on
the evening.
``We have to define what being a member of the first XV at Ayr means, and I
think we have to define it as a largely amateur role. But, for clarity's sake,
it has to be spelt out and everyone has to be aware of what we are about,''
said Munro.
``There will be a standard package, perhaps, which includes blazer, boots, and
a tour every two years. I see two or three areas to progress. We need someone
as director of coaching, perhaps one full-time professional as an employee of
the club, and we need to add a multi-sport role, and a multi-sex outlook, to
Ayr rugby club.
``There may be 10 quid given to the players after a match for beer money, but
that would have to be spent at the club.''
Munro has consulted with SRU director of rugby, Jim Telfer, and Keith
Robertson, to examine the club structure at Melrose. ``We are in the fourth
division, and we want to be challenging at the top,'' says Munro.
``I think if we clearly define ourselves in this way, players will be
attracted. I think that many clubs will follow Ayr and Melrose as they try to
define what it means, for players and clubs in Scotland, to enter the
professional era. If you don't spell it out you're whistling in the dark.''
Out of tune
IT was good to bump into Alex Moore, the former Scotland winger, on Saturday.
Alex, who won six caps as an Edinburgh Accies player in the early nineties, was
on police duty at Murrayfield and I saw him deep in the bowels of the stadium
in the players' tunnel.
We exchanged greetings. ``I tell you what,'' said Alex. ``If the team plays
like that at Murrayfield for the Five Nations' then at least we have something
to look forward to . . . the Tina Turner concert.'' Ouch.
Sick joke
THESE North and Midlands boys are tough. No wonder they beat the Samoans. After
the game Martin Waite was sick over Brian Ireland, and the lads stole Rowen
Shepherd's rear wipers and let down the tyres of his car. Not a sheep in sight,
honest.
Just joking
I AM intrigued at the lengths many of our clubs are going to in order to
entertain precious spectators by making match programmes that little bit
different.
Allan Glen's have a picture of Mike Gibson, the famous Irish centre of the
seventies, on their cover. A dangerous liaison surely.
Pride of place in the Diary's collection goes to an offering from referee Eddie
Crozier, who sent along the Whitecraigs match programme. Under the proud
legend, ``Lochaber RFC'' where there should have been a team list, there was,
instead, the following: ``Sorry boys, could not manage to get your names.'' On
the facing page is a racy message of welcome from the club president, who
wishes everyone an enjoyable afternoon's rugby.
Beneath that is a cartoon depicting one player leaving a scene of quite obvious
injury to another. The downtrodden player, lying flat on his back and in great
pain, is seen to be saying: ``An enjoyable day's rugby, you've got to be
f*****g joking.'' No letters are blanked out in the Whitecraigs programme. See
South siders? Any more out there?
Time check
THE Diary understands that the Western Samoan manager let slip at the
post-match dinner on Saturday that Bill Hogg, the SRU chief executive, has very
little grasp of time. When rumours of Western Samoa cancelling their tour were
rife, Hogg phoned the Southern Hemisphere to check, but at two o'clock our
time. Which raised our friend from the middle of his slumbers. Sounds likely to
me.

WATCHING the new Bond film, Goldeneye, I was irresistibly reminded of those
lines allegedly written by the Poet Laureate, Alfred Austin, about the illness
of the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII - ``Across the wires the electric
message came, He is no better, He is much the same.''
Forget the hype, all that stuff about this being a Bond for the nineties. The
seventeenth in the series is the same old nonsense, albeit with slightly higher
production values, one outstanding stunt, and a new, sexier, although slightly
lightweight Bond, Pierce Brosnan. It should delight fans of the series because
it represents a return to form.
I am not one to knock Timothy Dalton's Bond films. His two outings as 007 were
competent enough adventures and he had both the looks and the weight for the
role, although he was a bit short on charm. The films were an attempt to
redefine the series after it had, in Roger Moore's latter years, gone off the
rails a bit, becoming too tongue in the cheek, too full of irrelevant glamour
girls. As for Moore, he had become a shade too old for the role.
That the attempt did not work was not Dalton's fault. But it meant there was a
six-year hiatus between his last film, Licence to Kill, and the present one. In
that time the world's political climate had changed: the Cold War, the basic
requirement for a Bond adventure, had ended and political correctness had
arrived. Changes in the name of PC are minimal. The heroine, Izabella Scorupco,
is allowed to give 007 a dressing down for being a callous brute about all the
women he has loved and killed, which sticks out like a sore thumb amid the
carnage.
Dame Judi Dench makes the most of her two short scenes as M, although to tell
the truth any old English character actress could have done as well, and
certainly any of the other Dames. She delivers the coup de grace with relish,
telling Bond he is a misogynistic chauvinist male dinosaur, but being a woman
she really thinks he is pretty terrific underneath the frost, you can tell.
Directed by Martin Campbell, the film's pace seldom slackens, and he has
created that stunt. It takes place within the first ten minutes, during the
obligatory pre-credits mini adventure, and is never improved upon when the film
proper begins. The tank chase through the streets of St Petersburg is
excitingly shot, and the studio street fits in with the real locations
brilliantly, a tribute to the skills of Peter Lamont, the production designer.
But they do drive the tank up and down it once too often because one starts to
recognise the buildings. As for that stunt, I don't want to spoil things, but
it involves a pilotless bi-plane, a precipice, a runaway motorbike and Bond and
is breathtaking in its audacity.
The plot is pretty hopeless, but plot was never among the series' strengths,
and occasionally a little too familiar. We have been here before. At the
climax, looking for the site of the radar telescope which controls Goldeneye,
Bond flies over a lake deep in the mountains of Cuba and professes himself
stumped as to where it is. One is tempted to shout look at the lake, you fool,
because he has romped over a similar lake in the past.
A renegade agent, 006 (Sean Bean, like Brosnan an alumnus of the Citz) and an
ambitious Russian General (Gottfried John, impressively nasty), are out to
acquire the Goldeneye, a device which will allow them to hold the world to
ransom and do terrible things to the international computer networks. Robbie
Coltrane appears as a Russian arms dealer, and Alan Cumming hams it up madly as
a bent Russian computer expert working on the Goldeneye project, both making a
decent impression in underwritten roles. Famke Janssen slinks around as Xenia
Onatopp, a Russian sadist who kills her victims by strangling them between her
thighs. Miss Scorupco, the obligatory love interest, is terrific as another
computer operator. She displays spirit, and may, if she is lucky, escape the
curse of Bond. Few, if any, of the other 16 leading ladies went on to better
things.
Brosnan looks good enough to eat, wears his clothes with style, manages the
fights well enough, and should have a career ahead of him as 007, if he wants
it. He has, however, been ill served by the script. The obligatory double
entendres are crude and unfunny. Given that disaster was forecast by the
Cassandras of the film world, the result is a triumph.
Demi Moore may be the highest paid actress in Hollywood history, but she is
also one of the worst. Her performance as Hester Prynne in Roland Joffe's
lavish, handsomely photographed, but incredibly dull version of Nathaniel
Hawthorne's novel, The Scarlet Letter, is wooden and lacklustre, and one of the
reasons why this expensive affair is a disaster. The other is they ditched the
book.
Free spirit Hester, furnished with an amazing wardrobe and lots of make-up,
arrives in a Puritan colony in seventeenth century Massachusetts, to set up
home for her husband (Robert Duvall) and in no time is upsetting the locals
with her willful ways. One day, walking the woods, she spies a young man
bathing, and one flash of his buttocks is all that is needed to make her fall
in love. He turns out to be the local preacher, Reverend Dimmesdale (Gary
Oldman), who reciprocates the passion.
Meanwhile, her husband is apparently killed when the Indians attack the ship
bringing him to the colony. But Hester's pregnancy is a problem, because she
must wait seven years for his death to be confirmed before consorting with
another man. When she refuses to say who the father is, the elders condemn her
to life as an outcast, branded by the scarlet letter A for adultery pinned to
her dress. Then her husband returns from the dead.
Joan Plowright, as a randy old biddy, doing her celebrated impersonation of
Beryl Reid, is one of the few good things in the film, although it does seem a
pity that she is not burnt at the stake for heresy. It would have cheered
things up enormously. All is solved when the Indians attack the settlement in
the final reel. Would that they had done so two hours earlier and we could all
have gone home sooner.
Patricia Rozema's When Night is Falling is a glum tale about an affair between
two Canadian lesbians, Camille (Pascale Bussieres), an academic at a theology
college, and Petra (Rachel Ward), a circus performer. Camille is forced to
chose between Petra and her dreary boyfriend, but it is hard to care. Night
does not fall quickly enough.

IN A small room in a Dundee clinic mothers discuss what was once the
unimaginable - turning carer for your terminally ill child. But many of these
women have also been forced to think of their grandchildren's future.
This is the double trauma of carers whose children are HIV positive.
There is little evidence of bitterness or self-pity among members of the
Tayside Carers' HIV Support Group, and this is their strength. The prime
function has been to act as a channel to release emotions, and provide a
sanctuary where carers can meet and talk freely.
One, Elizabeth, whose daughter was in her thirties when she died, explains:
``To begin with I couldn't speak to my husband about our daughter. I was a bit
apprehensive about coming to the group, but you need someone to talk to and
this gave me the confidence to talk to my husband.''
Talk is therapeutic, but Marion had other reservations about opening up:``I
went to my first meeting three weeks after my daughter had died, and sat and
cried throughout the meeting, it was the first time I had really spoken about
her death.''
``But I was kind of frightened, because there were others there whose sons and
daughters were still alive, and I didn't want to mention that my daughter had
died.''
Being a parent of someone who is HIV means entry to a closed society, Marion
goes on: ``At home people can get fed up of listening to you, but everyone here
understands my fears.'' These fears include imagined inadequacies as mothers,
not being protective enough, and Marion summed up a universal view: ``It's the
only time in your life where you are powerless to do something for them.''
For Marion now the HIV cause has become a crusade, a complete turnaround of her
previous views: ``Before my daughter's illness I would not have shaken hands
with someone who was HIV.''
Absorbing the news is then followed by thinking through the implications,
Margaret explains: ``You are very selective about who you tell because of the
fear of prejudice.''
And then the anxiety spreads to the grandchildren and the effect of the
parent's illness on their school pals, leaving primary age youngsters open to
being marked as modern day lepers. For Marion continuing education is the
answer, because she argues infection is still happening, and stressed: ``We
can't really be getting the message through because young people are still
getting HIV because they don't think it will happen to them.''
The Tayside group celebrates its third year on Monday, and any suggestion that
meetings are depressing is brushed aside, instead there is joking about the
fictitious names which will be used in this article.

Council Social Work Department, Dundee Royal Infirmary (01382 346648).

<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>12</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975241247</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FEMALE lawyer yesterday claimed she was unfairly sacked and sexually
discriminated against by a leading Scottish legal firm.
Mr Cameron Fyfe, managing partner for Ross Harper &amp; Co, yesterday admitted to
an industrial tribunal that he had sacked Mrs Eileen Paterson, 36, of
Pollokshields, without asking about her personal circumstances after she
refused to work at night.
The tribunal also heard that another lawyer in Ross Harper &amp; Co was excused
from working nights because he became medically unfit at the prospect of
cross-examining police officers in court.
Mrs Paterson, who is married to advocate Robert Skinner and has two chilren
aged nine and four, worked in Ross Harper &amp; Co's offices in Ingram Street,
Glasgow, for nine years before being sacked earlier this year after refusing to
take part in the night call-out rota covering weekdays and weekends.
Prior to the introduction of the rota, Mrs Paterson had been excused from night
call-outs because of her family commitments.
Asked by Mr Jack Quar, representing Mrs Paterson, whether he had looked into
her family circumstances, Mr Fyfe said: ``I knew she had two children. I knew
she was married and my assumption was that her husband could look after the
children or someone else.''
Mr Quar: Don't you know her husband is frequently away at night?
Mr Fyfe: I know from my own knowledge how busy a junior counsel is but I don't
believe a junior counsel is busy every night of the week.
You made no investigation into how often he was away from home and the nature
of his practice? - I cannot see what further investigation I could have made. I
know enough about an advocate's life from my own experience. He could be the
top QC in the country and I don't think they would be busy every night.
So you proceeded on the assumption that daddy could look after them? - I
understood her husband, a neighbour, or whoever could look after the children.
So you thought it reasonable for Mrs Paterson to give her children up to the
care and custody of whoever? You don't think it would have been incumbent to
make investigations about her domestic situation? - No I didn't.
Earlier, Mr Fyfe had told the industrial tribunal in Glasgow that the
management of the criminal office in Ingram Street, previously done by himself,
had been transferred to Mr John Caruthers who had produced a policy document
late last year which called for all qualified solicitors to go on the night
call-out rota.
He agreed that the partners in the Ingram Street office, prior to Mr Caruther's
arrival, had allowed Mrs Paterson to be excluded from the rota.
Asked why it was essential for Mrs Paterson to go on the rota, Mr Fyfe said it
was necessary to create a bond between clients and lawyers by having the
solicitor who spoke to them while in custody also represent them next day in
court.
He said also that another criminal lawyer, who worked in Ingram Street, was
excused from going on the rota.
The tribunal continues.

From Our Correspondent
THE first few hundred Nato troops will go to Bosnia next week, and the main
movement of what will be an army 60,000-strong will begin before Christmas.
Meanwhile, President Clinton will try to persuade Congress of the wisdom of the
move.
Both Houses expressed continued scepticism of the need to send US troops into
the Balkans, but were less openly critical than before the Dayton agreement.
Last Friday Congress passed a resolution that would forbid the president to
spend money on a Bosnian peacekeeping operation. Congress appears less obdurate
now.
His spokesmen, starting with the vice-president, today repeated the claim that
there could be no peace without a large Nato force, which the United States
must lead. They argue that the alternative is a resumption of the war.
Critics say the appearance of peace has come because of the winter. All sides
must go into winter quarters and are preparing to resume the battle next spring.
The weather is a serious concern for the Americans and their allies, who will
have to house the troops in inclement conditions.
The Americans are to patrol the central front. The French are to take Sarajevo
and the British, western Bosnia. Other contingents will add to the total,
including a a small number of Russians.

n BABIES of smokers may be up to nine times more at risk of cot deaths than
those of non-smokers, suggests new scientific research carried out at the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.
Cot death is still the single biggest killer of babies over one week old in
Scotland. The Scottish Cot Death Trust has launched a campaign to raise
awareness of the issue with a series of posters asking the public to ``Donate
money to an unknown cause'' featuring a hard-hitting image.
Information from the Scottish Cot Death Trust, Royal Hospital for Sick
Children, Yorkhill, Glasgow (0141-357 3946).
n After The Herald coffee mornings come the afternoon cup of tea. Jane Asher is
launching an appeal in aid of arthritis research and asking people to invite
friends in for a cuppa and a piece of cake.
Although Tea Week does not take place until March 10-16, 1996, to celebrate the
Arthritis and Rheumatism Council's diamond jubilee, volunteers are needed now
to help organise the event.
Write to Jane Asher, Arthritis and Rheumatism Council, PO Box 177,

n A FREE Winter Warmth helpline has been set up to give advice to the elderly.
Sponsored by three charities and the DoH, the line is open between 10am and 4pm
on weekdays on 0800 289404.
n SYNTHETIC pillows may account for more than half of severe asthma in
youngsters. A study of more than 1500 children between the ages of 11 and 16
found they were almost three times as likely to have a wheezing attack at least
once a month if they used non-feather bedding.
According to the British Medical Journal, researchers at St George's Hospital,
London, believe it may be due to the compounds given off in the foam.
n ABUSE of the elderly is slowly gaining recognition as a major social problem.
Now a pilot helpline, funded by the Department of Health, has been set up for
victims. The Elder Abuse Response Line provides advice on 0181-679 7074.
n HIGH intakes of Vitamin C could reduce the risk of osteoarthritis, says a
recent report in GP magazine. It also points out that if sufferers switch to a
high intake of Vitamin C they are less likely to experience so much pain. The
American study involved 640 people. The researchers told a recent American
College of Rheumatology meeting that they also noted the disease progression
could be reduced by high intake of beta-carotene and Vitamin E.
n A WORLDWIDE competition, ``Paint Your Asthma'', invites young people and
carers to put their feelings on the problem into art. Organised by the National
Asthma Campaign, it aims to bring to public attention what it feels like to be
one of the three million people in the UK, over a million of whom are children,
who suffer from asthma.
There are four categories: up to 11 years, 12-17 years, 18 years and over, and
carers (all ages). Closing date is January 31, 1996.
Entry forms are available from Nicole Bettelley, Burson-Marsteller, 24-28
Bloomsbury Way, London WC1A 2PX.
An asthma helpline, run by the NAC, is open from 9am-9pm Monday-Friday, and
staffed by specialists on 0345 01 0203.
n THRUSH is a common complaint affecting four out of five women in their
lifetime. The most common symptoms include vaginal itching, soreness, and a
discharge.
Often it can be treated simply but women are reluctant to seek medical advice.
Now a new Thrush Advisory Service, with a free telephone helpline, has been
launched. By calling 0800 132649 women will be able to find out more about the
symptoms of thrush as well as the best way to treat it.
For a free leaflet write (enclosing sae) to the Canesten Thrush Advisory
Service, 12C Hillreach, Woolwich, London SE18 4AW.

A COURT was told yesterday how a young receptionist was grabbed round the neck
as she left a nightclub and had her head banged three times against a police
car. A policeman denies five charges of assault and four of breach of the peace.
Constable Graham Howie, 31, of the Tayside force, is alleged to have committed
the offences in Perth between July and October of last year.
He is accused, at Perth Sheriff Court, of assaulting two women in separate
street incidents. He is also alleged to have frightened and alarmed women by
shouting at them while they were in police cells, and trying to induce one of
them to drop a complaint against him.
Further charges accused him of assaulting two men, one of them twice, and
committing breaches of the peace by shouting and swearing in the street.
One of the alleged assault victims, Miss Sarah-Jayne Devlin, 24, of Glenartney
Terrace, Perth, said that she was approaching a taxi rank after leaving a
nightclub at 2.30am when another woman pushed her for no reason.
She said that as she fended off the woman she was grabbed round the neck from
behind and dragged backwards on her heels to a police car.
She said she was then knocked to the ground and had her head banged three times
on the side of the car before a foot or a knee was used to pin her head against
her chest with such force that she could hardly breathe. The witness said that
she eventually saw that it was a policeman - she identified him as the accused
- who was involved.
Miss Devlin said that she could not remember biting Mr Howie while she was on
the ground but might well have done so.
She said that when taken to the police station she was charged with police
assault, resisting arrest, and breach of the peace.
She was later prosecuted for breach of the peace only and found not guilty.
Miss Devlin said that while in the police station she told Mr Howie she wanted
him charged with assault. ``He replied: `Your type cannot afford that' and
called me a bitch. I couldn't believe it. He was shouting, more or less
spitting it out.''
she denied that she was involved in a drunken full-scale fight with another
woman when she was arrested.
The trial continues.

STRATHCLYDE Police have come up with a new drugs deterrent to help clean
Glasgow's streets of dealers - Taz the retriever.
He looks just like any other family pet but the alert three-year-old has a
finely tuned nose which can sniff out an illegal substance in seconds.
Taz is the only police sniffer dog in Britain with the skills to detect drugs
on the human body. The black short-haired hound has already pounced on a number
of drugs carriers and suppliers in the past four months - many from queues of
people waiting to enter the city's clubs and pubs.
Yesterday, he demonstrated his skills in Glasgow's busy Central Station by
screening the crowds and detecting three separate decoys carrying ecstasy,
cannabis, and heroin.
On detecting the drugs carrier, Taz sits beside his target until an officer
arrives. He is then given a ball to play with as a reward for his work.
Taz took six weeks to train at a cost of #3000. He will be joined by two more
dogs, one of which will be used on city streets.
Taz's handler, PC Jardine Smith, said: ``Taz is taller than other sniffer dogs,
which means he has good access to places where people carry drugs such as
pockets, waistbands, and underpants.''

IN THE Middle East, Palestinians and Israelis proclaimed a ``peace of the
brave''. In Dayton, Ohio, the warring factions in the Balkans finally conceded
a peace of the exhausted, defeated, resentful, and bitterly disappointed.
Resolving the fate of the West Bank and Jerusalem is simplicity itself compared
with sorting out Bosnia in the wake of its horrible civil war, and the fate of
Yitzhak Rabin is no doubt a reminder to Slobodan Milosevic and Alija
Izetbegovic of the dangers they face.
There would have been no peace in either conflict without relentless American
pressure, and the agreement on Bosnia will certainly fail without continuing
American leadership of a great international effort to make it work. Tens of
thousands are dead and hundreds of thousands of refugees have lost their homes
because leaders vacillated for years, while Bosnia burned.
The bottom line is that Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who played a large part in
igniting the first Yugoslav war in 1991, has got most of what he wanted while
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has renounced, at least for now, his hopes of
creating a Greater Serbia. The Muslims of Bosnia, history's victims, ground
down between those unforgiving tyrants, have been forced to accept the
partition of their country under a fig-leaf central government.
The agreements have to be ratified by the people on the ground, starting with
the Bosnian Serbs whose first reaction was to reject the Dayton agreement out
of hand. Their representatives refused to attend Tuesday's ceremony when the
three presidents initialled the document.
They will have to allow their two most popular leaders, General Ratko Mladic
and their titular president, Radovan Karadzic, to leave office (there is not
much hope that they will ever be prosecuted for their crimes). They must give
up their control of western Sarajevo and admit that the city will be reunited
under the control of the Bosnian Government.
Furthermore, they must give up territory along the front lines in the east and
open a wide corridor to the Goradze pocket, which will be enlarged.
They must pull their troops back from the confrontation lines, to allow the
Nato peace-keepers to interpose themselves between the two sides. Lastly,
within two years, the last pocket of Serb-controlled Croatia must be handed
over. Its leaders have already denounced the agreement.
It will require all Mr Milosevic's authority to bend the Serbs to the
inevitable.
They have also had to renounce their hopes of enlarging the Brcko, or Posavina,
corridor in the north. That heavily-fortified pass will be taken over by the
Americans, who will this way control the movement of Serbian forces and
supplies between eastern and western Bosnia, with all the dangers that implies.
In exchange for these concessions, the Serbs will recover a swathe of territory
in the west that they lost in the last Croatian-Muslim offensive. This will be
a bitter pill for the Muslims to accept, because they must abandon hope of
controlling a direct road between central Bosnia and Bihac in the east. The
British will have the task of separating the two armies there.
Furthermore, thousands of Croatian and Muslim refugees who were summarily
resettled in the area, around Mrkonjik Grad, will have to move again. The
Muslims have no choice: the territory is controlled by the Croatian army.
There are 500,000 to one million Muslim refugees, driven from their homes in
eastern Bosnia, from Prijedor and Banja Luka in the west; and the victims of
Croat ethnic cleansing in south-central Bosnia, still camped on the hillsides
and public spaces of central Bosnia.
The Dayton agreement specifies that all refugees will be allowed to return
home, but no-one seriously believes that the people of Srebrenica will return.
President Izetbegovic said on Tuesday: ``This is not a just peace, but it is
more just than a continuation of the war.'' The refugees who have nothing to
hope for may not agree.
Winter has come early this year and the first task of international relief will
be to provide for them: there are hundreds of thousands of Serb refugees, too,
in Banja Luka and eastern Bosnia, and in Serbia itself, who were driven out of
Krajina.
The people who have come out best from the war and the peace are the Croats.
They have recovered almost all their national territory and are promised the
rest, Eastern Slavonia, within two years. They have driven almost all the Serbs
out of Croatia, at least 150,000 people, to form a nearly homogeneous state.
Bosnia has been partitioned into three. The Serbs have the lion's share, 49% of
the territory for a third of the population. The Croats, too, have done well.
They had 20% of the population and now control at least a quarter of the
country.
The only victory the Muslims can claim, besides the bare fact of their
survival, is Sarajevo. The future central government, which will supervise both
the Bosnian-Croatian Federation and the Serb Republic of Bosnia, has what the
Serbs call ``a paper roof''.
It has no army and no arrangements yet for a police force. But it will control
the capital, and if Sarajevo can recover its pre-war cosmopolitan, democratic,
and liberal ways, that oasis of civilisation may eventually spread to the rest
of the country.

THE Scottish Enterprise Trust envisages that the Perth Business Park at Glasgow
Road, immediately opposite the swimming pool and ice-rink complex, will
eventually accommodate a total of 100,000 sq.ft of office space in a mixture of
one and two-storey buildings, with plenty of car parking.
As well as a new road through the site, street lighting, electricity, gas,
water, telephone and drainage services were installed to each plot.
Landscaping and tree-planting has also been carried out to enhance the quality
of the site, and more landscaping is planned for each plot when building is
complete.
The opening of Robertson House in the new Perth Business Park heralded the
arrival of a major new force on the Tayside property scene.
This purpose-built, multiple occupancy building is the first major development
in Tayside by construction and development company Robertson of Elgin Ltd, and
the first speculative office development in central Perth for several years.
It provides 10,000 sq.ft of open-plan accommodation on two floors, with each
floor capable of sub-division into four separate units. A total of 40 parking
spaces has been provided.
David Sawyer, chairman of Scottish Enterprise Tayside, performed the opening
ceremony in the #1m development, and a ceremonial key was presented to Colin
Anderson, manager of the Perth office of Chartered Trust plc, the development's
first tenants.
Mr Robertson said: ``Robertson House is a major step in our overall strategy
for organic and geographical growth. We see a number of construction and
development opportunities in the Tayside area, and our base in Perth gives us
an excellent platform from which to continue our growth.''
Mr Anderson of Chartered Trust said: ``It was almost eight years since we
opened a Perth office, with a major increase in business and a workforce
expanded to 13, and new premises were a must to keep pace with this growth, and
they had to be more accessible than our previous offices.
``I am pleased to say we have found attractive modern premises at Perth
Business Park which are both spacious and accessible. Most important was the
open-plan accommodation which we found was at a premium in central Perth.''
As well as Chartered Trust, Robertson themselves will establish their Tayside
office in one unit of the new development, and there is strong interest in the
remaining space, with further tenants expected to be announced soon.
Scottish Enterprise Tayside developed the Perth Business Park for exactly this
kind of project, and assisted Robertson with its development.
Mr Sawyer said: ``Perth Business Park constitutes an important step towards
freeing development in Perth from its present constraints and helping the city
to fulfil its undoubted potential to prosper as a key business centre for
Tayside.
``That a company of the calibre of Robertson has been quick to seize upon the
opportunities afforded by a presence in Perth Business Park is surely an
encouraging omen.''
As well as Robertson House, another five out of nine plots on the development
are now spoken for. Robertson themselves are planning a similar block next
door, while work has also begun on a further two 9000 sq.ft blocks nearby.
The Traders restaurant development opposite Robertson House is almost finished,
and site investigations for a general practice surgery are under way on a fifth
plot.
Perth-based chartered surveyors Bidwells has been appointed by Scottish
Enterprise Tayside as selling agents for the Perth Business Park, and also
appointed by Robertson as letting agents for Robertson House.
Bidwells partner Gilmour Strang said: ``The scheme provides much-needed modern,
high-specification office accommodation in Perth, and the location is an
obvious attraction for many companies and their staffs, who recognise the
considerable benefits of being in the city centre, within easy walking distance
of shops and recreational facilities.
``It is the only centrally-located modern office accommodation available within
the city centre, with on-site car-parking space and yet within a convenient
five-minute drive of the motorway network.''

CHRIS HOLME argues that increases in NHS patients treated is not necessarily a
healthy sign
EXTRAPOLATION is a new disease afflicting Cabinet ministers and health analysts
alike. Triggered by a diet of too much raw data, it often leads to chronic
verbal diarrhoea.
The Government boasts how increases in funding and patients treated show the
health service in good shape. Opposition politicans and unions fall into the
same trap, seeing mere bed numbers as totems of the welfare state's vitality.
But their mistake is not to see the NHS for what it is, an illness rather than
a health service. Society's sense of well-being is usually in inverse
proportion to how busy its hospitals are.
Lothian's director of public health, Dr Helen Zealley, has developed this theme
in her annual report. It chronicles a variety of increases in self-injury,
self-poisoning, divorce rates, hospital emergencies for unspecified complaints,
and higher rates of mental ill-health and distress.
``All of these appear to be symptoms of a society which seems to be in danger
of losing the vital feature of neighbourliness,'' she says.
This also shows itself with Lothian now having the highest rates of abortion
and unwanted pregnancies in Scotland.
Abortion rates in the region have risen two-thirds over the last decade among
women under 20, to the extent that more than 40% of healthy teenage pregnancies
now result in termination. So much for the extrapolated myth of young women
using childbirth as a passport to housing and benefits.
The overall abortion figure increased by 10% last year to 2281, leaving
Edinburgh with a rate 50% higher than the rest of Scotland.
``These are matters of concern which need to be addressed,'' Zealley says.
``I am pleased at the reduction in births but I am sorry to see that it is
being achieved through termination. What is needed is better education about
sexual relationships and use of contraception, including the morning-after
pill.''
Education, she argues, should start with reinforcing young women's confidence
to say no to sex in a relationship.
There are other familiar home truths of a changing society. Use of recreational
drugs like ecstasy was increasingly common among teenagers.
``Importantly, for those seeking to address the dilemmas, illegal drug use was
seen to be the norm, even among those who did not use drugs themselves,''
Zealley says.
Her report reveals that heart disease continues to decline and is no longer the
biggest single killer in Lothian, a position it has held every year since 1959.
It has been overtaken by cancer, where rates among women are still rising due
to increased smoking.
Those searching for the feel-good factor in reams of NHS statistics are more
likely to find a sick society instead.

IT is still happening. In the sleepy Middle American town of Wenatchee
(population 24,000) well-intentioned state prosecutors claimed two weeks ago
that dozens of children had been systematically raped and molested over a
seven-year period by as many as 80 adults, including the local pastor and his
wife. The devil, it seems, continues to make work for idle hands.
But whose hands? The accused or the accusers? There is little doubt where the
sympathies of television dramatist Michael Eaton lie. There is, he declares, a
social phenomenon around. It centres, not just on accusations of child abuse.
Not even on accusations of ritual child abuse. It centres on bizarre claims of
the organised international satanic-inspired abuse of children.
It started in the States during the eighties, moved to Australia, and
eventually raised its rather ugly and sordid head in Britain just a few years
ago. In Scotland it manifested itself in two celebrated cases, in Ayrshire and
Orkney. Children were removed from their mothers' arms - sometimes for years -
in a frenzy of institutional hysteria.
Eaton, who graduated with a degree in social anthropology, does not believe a
word of it. Which is why he has attempted to redress the balance by writing a
controversial fictional drama on the subject. Flowers of the Forest, a powerful
and harrowing film starring Pauline Collins, Lia Williams, Clive Russell, and
Annette Crosbie, has just completed shooting in Scotland. It was commissioned
by BBC Scotland and will be shown as a Screen Two movie next year.
To Eaton controversy is a familiar friend. He wrote the script for ITV's Shoot
To Kill drama-documentary about Northern Ireland which was accused of being
pro-IRA. More recently, he wrote the acclaimed religious drama series, Signs
and Wonders.
It is a brave move, perhaps even a foolhardy one, on Eaton's part to tackle the
ritual child abuse issue as a television drama. He may well be on a hiding to
nothing; a no-win situation. Indeed, before he even put pen to paper he was the
target of strong criticism. For research purposes he visited Orkney and, along
with BBC Scotland, was immediately accused of making a tasteless bid to grab
the ratings. Fears were expressed that, by setting the film in an un-named
Highland village, viewers would immediately think that the events portrayed
were what really happened in Orkney or Ayr.
Eaton is quick to stress that nothing could be further from the truth. He is
also anxious to make the point that Flowers of the Forest is an entirely
fictional account and not based on any particular case.
``These accusations of systematic child abuse are incredibly disturbing to me.
Social workers seem to have an agenda and believe only the answers that confirm
their hypothesis. They put words in the children's mouths. And yet there is
still the perception around - and not just in social work departments - that
there is no smoke without fire. I wanted to write a drama that says that it is
perfectly possible for there to be smoke without fire. I have tried to look at
the subject dramatically in order to get behind the headlines,'' he explains.
The film centres on the fictional Mid West Highland Social Work Department. Two
young children from a local village are brought in because they have been
running wild. Senior social worker Janet Hinton (Williams) suspects that they
have been abused. When Aileen Matthews (Collins), an expert from the Christian
fundamentalist New Morning Trust, is brought in, they become convinced of the
existence of a widespread network of ritual abuse.
The drama then explores the devastating effects which the allegations have upon
the tight-knit community. Why did Eaton choose Scotland? England, after all,
has had more than its fair share of such cases - in Rochdale, Cleveland, and
Nottingham. One reason for setting the drama North of the Border was the simple
fact that BBC Scotland had expressed an interest in commissioning the piece.
But, more importantly, Eaton believes that the absurdity of the child abuse
phenomenon is magnified in Scotland because, unlike England, our legal system
offers an extra layer of protection in the form of the Children's Panel system.
``People I know in the social work profession in England told me that they were
particularly surprised when the Orkney and Ayrshire cases came up because they
thought the Scottish system was so much better. In England social workers seem
to be able to do what they want.
``It is also the case that Lord Clyde's Report on the Orkney case was the first
to say publicly that the children were being interviewed in disclosure sessions
by people who were not trained child psychologists. They didn't know how to ask
the questions or how to deal with the information they had,'' adds Eaton.
Of his research trip to Orkney, he says: ``I went there and spoke to quite a
few people and there was this press speculation that I was writing a
drama-documentary about the Orkney case. That is not the case.
``It would have been not only morally wrong to do a drama-documentary about one
case in particular, but also legally impossible because the information that
one needed in order to make the points, was not available.''

DO you skip meals because you haven't time to eat properly, drink too much
coffee, take work home with you, find you haven't time for exercise or
relaxation, and work long hours because you are worried about losing your job?
Have you cut back on your social life and has your marriage suffered? Are you
worried that you don't have enough money for the things you need? If you can
answer yes to even half of those questions then you are part of today's
stressed workforce.
Six years ago stress in the workplace was an unknown phenomenon. Today it's on
everyone's lips. The major cause is the restructuring of the workforce,
bringing with it job losses and uncertainty.
Some companies are beginning to tackle it, though many are afraid - regarding
it as a huge can of worms which, once opened, they will have neither the skill
nor the resources to handle.
But the problem has to be tackled if long-term damage to people's health is not
to happen. Lothian Health Trust, with its 25,000 employees, have taken a
positive step forward with their Healthy Workplace Strategy. They sent a
questionnaire to employees, analysed the results, produced a report, then held
a one-day seminar on Stress in the Workplace in Edinburgh.
They invited top organisational psychologist, Professor Tom Cox of Nottingham
University, to give the keynote speech as part of their plan towards developing
the strategy.
Cox quickly dismissed the idea that the solution lay in bringing in outside
stress consultants with their armoury of alternative therapy. Sending a nurse
for aromatherapy may temporarily alleviate her stress problems but it would not
tackle the root cause. ``You have to ask yourself why your employees need these
things in the first place,'' he said. ``The key lies in good management. Find
out what causes the stress then devise ways of coping with it.''
He used the analogy with fighter pilots. They are under tremendous stress, but
they handle it. Why? Because they are highly trained for the job. They get
tremendous support and they have control over what they do.
Only by introducing similar systems with the emphasis on training support and
giving people more control over their work will we see stress levels reduced.
Workplace stress must now be taken seriously following the landmark court case
involving social work manager John Walker who sued Northumberland County
Council in November 1994 for #200,000.
If people say they are ill they are ill, said Cox, and they are likely to die
sooner than those who are unstressed.
So, how do you define stress? Cox said quite simply it's placing more demands
on a person than they have the ability to cope with. The effects of
work-related stress include poor timekeeping, increased sickness, and a high
staff turnover.
He added that the most effective method of reducing stress is to train people
to do the job properly. Managers had a variety of tools to help them reduce
stress in the workplace ranging from redesigning jobs, restructuring work,
better training, and more effective management systems, to counselling, health
screening, group discussions and even helplines.
But we also have to rethink what we mean by work, he said. Just back from
Helsinki where he had taken part in an international conference on
tele-working, he added: ``The issues raised by tele-working touch fundamentally
on the structure of future workplaces. A significant portion of people will be
involved in tele-working and an even greater number will work from home.''
He said the process of moving us all back into the home, which is similar to
that prior to the industrial revolution, is already under way and it poses all
kinds of problems: do we design homes differently in the future to take care of
this? Do we have to recreate a new set of health and safety regulations and do
we have to go around and inspect homes?
Already the European Commission is investigating how some quality of working
life for people can be maintained when they are no longer gathered together in
traditional workplaces.
He said: ``In one sense we are going back and in another sense we are going
forward by exploiting telecommunication technology. People will be able to do
their jobs wherever they are, whether at home or on a park bench.''
The ``virtual company'' of the future can be one or two people with a bunch of
contracts and those people need not even be in the same country. Already some
of our major companies have their clerical work carried out on the other side
of the world and as a user of that company's services you would never know, eg,
an airline ticket booked in Manchester is processed in Delhi where a vast
source of skilled cheap labour exists on the Indian sub-continent.
Cox says these major social changes are both exciting and also potentially
stressful, especially for the individual whose job is changing rapidly.
He offers the following advice:
If you are worried about your job then try to seek more information so that you
are better informed about the changes taking place within your company. You
should try to become part of that process otherwise there is a danger of
finding yourself pushed aside.
Often people worried about their jobs withdraw so they don't know as much as
they could about what is going on. Secondly, seek support from colleagues. If
you have a medical or psychological problem then go and consult your GP.
But these issues have to be tackled at an organisational level too. Managers
need to be asked if they are managing the process of change in the best
possible way. There's evidence that the uncertainty of job changes damages the
staff who remain, as well as the staff who leave. A good manager will not want
to damage the survivors because it is on them that the company is going to rely
heavily in years to come.
The Edinburgh seminar received a mixed response from workers within Lothian
Health Trust because the trust is in the process of negotiating more staff
cuts. Des Loughney, a member of Edinburgh Trades Council, said: ``Stress in the
workplace is a political problem as well as an educational one. There are some
managers using stress as a disciplinary weapon to get rid of people they don't
want.''
Stress, added Cox, is like the old song: It Ain't What You Do, It's The Way
That You Do It. ``At the end of the day it comes back to good management.''

Settlement rests on thin ice
THE Dayton peace treaty is likely to push Bosnia off the front pages in coming
months and bring relief to civilians tormented by three winters of savage
warfare. However it is a peace of exhaustion, not of reason.
No meeting of minds has occurred between the protagonists during their 20 days
closeted together in middle America. The chief war party, the Bosnian Serbs of
Radovan Karadzic, were not even there, but were quick to denounce a sell-out by
President Milosevic, acting on their behalf. The unpalatable terms of the deal
have also opened up divisions within the Sarajevo government and between Bosnia
and Croatia, locked in a loveless marriage known as the Muslim-Croat federation
of Bosnia.
Only Croatia and Serbia seem to have turned over a new leaf. Zagreb is ready to
normalise relations with Belgrade now that it has recovered its lost territory.
But this may only fuel the territorial ambitions in Bosnia of Croat leader
Franjo Tudjman.
It was territorial disputes that produced the nail-biting finale to Dayton and
may yet give rise to a still-born peace.
The main concern of the Bosnian Serbs has been to safeguard the narrow corridor
of land across northern Bosnia through which most of their supplies come. It is
vulnerable to a Muslim-Croat attack following the losses suffered in the
autumn. President Milosevic's insistence on security guarantees for the
Posavina corridor made the talks run beyond Monday's US deadline but he got
little thanks from the militants of the self-styled Republic of Srpska, who
view him as a traitor to the Serb cause.
The final loss of the Muslim enclaves of Zepa and Srebrenica has produced
similar ill-will within the Muslim camp. One remaining enclave, Goradze, will
remain linked to Sarajevo by a corridor, presumably defended by Nato forces.
Meanwhile, in northern Bosnia where Muslim forces made big gains in the autumn,
the peace deal is likely to be treated with contempt by the army. It prevents
further advances on what were once mainly Muslim towns like Prijedor, the scene
of brutal ethnic cleansing in 1992, which Bosnian troops are now virtually in
sight of. They are convinced they could capture this land and they may press
forward regardless of any orders not to do so.
The danger is that populist politicians will try to exploit both the unrest of
the military and the refugees from which the Bosnian army is now largely
staffed. Muhamed Sacirbey, the foreign minister, offered his resignation at the
weekend perhaps to distance himself from a deal which amounts to partition by
any other name and is likely to divide his government.
The status of Sarajevo itself remains in doubt after Dayton. The Serbs still
hope to partition it while their opponents hope it will be the seat of a
unified Bosnia.
Constitutionally, Sarajevo will be the capital of a two-state country. A single
government and parliament are envisaged after internationally-supervised
elections. But how it can work in a Bosnia where Serb nationalists retain
institutions like a separate police force and security service is not clear.
Public figures found guilty of war crimes by the Hague Tribunal under Judge
Goldstone are barred from political life. But even if Karadzic and General
Milosevic retire to the shadows, it is hard to see how co-operation can grow
among the bitterest of foes to make a rickety constitution last for more than a
few weeks or months.
How citizens traumatised by war can be expected to trust a new government
composed of former enemies is hard to imagine. Most Bosnians (the highest
estimate being 2.7 million) are now refugees. They have the right to return and
vote in their own localities according to Dayton. But how can they be expected
to return to areas controlled by those who expelled them?
The fate of Muslims driven from their homes in Mostar during the 1993
Croat-Muslim civil war, suggests that no return will be possible for most
refugees: despite the federation uniting former enemies, the Croats running
most of Mostar simply thumb their noses when the European Union official
supervising the reconstruction of the city asks for the right of return.
It is likely that the Nato forces enforcing the Dayton agreement will be unable
to guarantee safe passage to refugees who wish to occupy their own homes again.
Tuesday's agreement does not require the demilitarisation of Bosnia which will
probably make a mockery of the promise of freedom of movement through the new
state. Weapons will flow to the Muslims but the US appears likely to block the
arrival of heavy weapons which is what they mainly lack. The beleaguered Serbs
in their stronghold of Pale are already receiving military assistance from
Belgrade despite the bad blood between them. So an enduring peace seems a
chimera if it is accompanied by an arms build-up.
Dayton holds out little comfort for the large numbers of ethnically-mixed
Bosnian citizens, even less for millions of refugees who enjoy little prospect
of rebuilding shattered lives. Despite the brilliant solo effort of Richard
Holbrooke, ``the Balkan Kissinger'', the initiative could be blown away by
another rogue missile attack on Sarajevo or a Muslim attack on a Serb area.

BEFORE campaigners gathered in Portree last night to consider future strategy
against the Skye bridge tolls, it emerged that none of the protesters who have
refused to pay the tolls since the bridge opened on October 16, will appear in
court this year.
One of the organisers of the Skye and Kyle Against the Tolls (Skat) campaign,
Skye councillor Gavin Scott-Moncrieff, claimed this was evidence of the
strength of public feeling on the issue.
``By our calculations there must be some 400 reports sent to the
procurator-fiscal in Dingwall since the bridge opened and obviously that has
delayed the process. We are pleased to have demonstrated by force of numbers
how strongly people feel about having such unjust tolls imposed on the people
of Skye, but our aim remains to get into court so we can challenge the legality
of the tolls,'' he said.
Procurator-fiscal David Hingston confirmed yesterday that there would be no
court case in 1995 but said he couldn't say how many reports of non-payment he
had now received.
Last night's meeting in Portree was called in order to show the strength of
local feeling in advance of tomorrow's meeting in Inverness of the new Highland
Council to maximise support for a motion tabled by all six Skye and Lochalsh
councillors urging measures to persuade the Scottish Office to change its
policy on skye Bridge tolls.

A SHERIFF heard how a ``completely out of control'' teenager became addicted to
Temazepam at the age of 14.
At Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday, John Logan, 17, was sentenced to two years
in a young offenders' institution after admitting 11 separate charges.
The court was told he stole from his mother, a church, and social workers who
were trying to help him.
Procurator-fiscal David Green said the youth abducted two schoolboys, aged 15
and 12, and took them to a close in Paisley where he threatened to slit one
boy's throat.
The youngsters had been given money by their parents to buy school clothes and
Logan robbed each of them of #25.
Defence agent Paul Lynch said Logan's crime spree had coincided with his period
of addiction which was totally out of control and cost his client over #100 a
week.
The court was told that he stole from his stepfather and aunt and even robbed
his friends' families to get items to sell for cash.
Defence agent Paul Lynch asked with the sheriff to impose a sentence which
would allow his client to receive specialist counselling for his drug taking
and revealed that no such facility was available to inmates detained in Polmont
Young Offenders' Institution. He said that Logan had a chronic dependency on
Temazepam.
He added: ``Temazepam is synonymous with crime in the Paisley area.''
The solicitor urged Sheriff Dunlop not to sentence Logan to a further period of
detention, claiming that drugs were freely available to prisoners, and asked
for a disposal which would enable the teenager to put his wrecked life back
together again.

BALLOT papers were posted out yesterday to 20,632 voters in Caithness asking
them if they supported Dounreay's proposal to reprocess spent nuclear fuel from
33 research reactors worldwide.
The referendum has been organised by the Caithness Against Nuclear Dumping
group, which has raised #10,000 to pay for the independently conducted poll.
The referendum begins as the Government was accused of endangering jobs and
safety in the nuclear industry by pressing ahead with its privatisation plans.
Mr Tony Cooper, general secretary of the Engineers and Managers Association,
giving evidence before the Trades and Industry Select Committee yesterday, said
nuclear privatisation would also accelerate the so-called ``dash for gas''.
Mr Cooper added: ``There is pressure to bring forward the planned date for
privatisation from next summer because the Government needs to fund tax cuts.''
.q.A reactor at the Hartlepool nuclear power station in Cleveland has been out
of action for 10 days after a leak of mildly radioactive carbon dioxide gas, it
was revealed yesterday.
The plant's other reactor had not been operating following a fire in a nearby
transformer last month. The station is expected to be operating again by
tomorrow.

HUTCHESONS' Grammar School face an exacting test on Saturday against Irish
opponents Presentation College from Bray at Auldhouse, a fixture which,
according to Magnus Brown, a former Watsonians' back-row forward and the master
in charge of rugby, will provide his young charges with a different kind of
experience.
``Irish schools rugby is more like our club rugby. They play a really hard game
and are not inclined to take prisoners,'' says Brown, who reasons that the type
of uncompromising rugby played is a result of their participation in the Irish
Schools Cup.
``The cup is a high-profile competition which, in the later stages, attracts
huge crowds and involves big money. Teams like Presentation College train five
or six days a week, such is the pressure on them,'' says Brown.
Very few leading rugby schools have opted to take part in the equivalent
Scottish competition but Brown believes that situation could soon change.
He said: ``Schools are becoming more professional about rugby. More than one
school offers sports bursaries.''
As to Hutchesons' following the example of St Aloysius' by going into the cup,
Brown has mixed feelings. ``We have a good fixture list now. It is balanced and
well-structured round the district scene. We could fall into the trap of
playing too much rugby, dropping good fixtures to play less meaningful cup
games.
``But if a sufficient number of the leading rugby schools came into the
competition, we would need to allocate certain Saturdays for cup games.
Perhaps, too, some measure of seeding would be necessary.''
A week after the match against Presentation College, Hutchesons' will play
Strathallan in what Brown expects could be his side's hardest domestic fixture
this season. Fortunately for the Glasgow school, they will be back to nearly
full strength.
``We have been badly hit by injuries, particularly to sixth-year boys,''
explains Brown. But he added: ``We were forced to play a number of younger
players, including some fourth-year boys. That, however, should be good for the
future.'' And perhaps, too, for a strong Hutchesons' team in the Scottish
Schools Cup?

<HEADLINE>Princess of Wales heads for a nation with a passion for powerful women Argentinians await the new Evita</HEADLINE>

THE Princess of Wales last night headed out for Argentina and prepared to face
the renewed attentions of the world's media following her extraordinary
Panorama interview, which the BBC has so far licensed to be shown in 37
countries.
With the furore over her revelations continuing at home, 7000 miles away she
was set to be feted by macho Latins as an icon of womanhood.
The Princess may not want to be cast in the mould of former Argentine
President's wife Evita Peron, but to a tango-loving nation with a passion for
powerful, beautiful women, the temptation is too great.
The hard-hitting significance of the Princess's Monday night interview, in
which she admitted adultery and cast doubt on the suitability of her estranged
husband to be king, will be lost on her hosts.
Argentina's President Carlos Menem, a self-confessed ``seducer'' who is
separated from his wife, is more interested in being seen with the world's most
famous woman. Officially, the Princess is in Argentina on a semi-private
working visit at the invitation of a charity. Unofficially, however, the
four-day visit, beginning today, is official, laid on for the benefit of
President Menem.
She flew out as Argentine television broadcast the Panorama interview on
Channel 13 at lunchtime yesterday.
The princess was smiling as she boarded British Airways flight 267 from London
Heathrow airport bound for Buenos Aires at 9.15pm.
Wearing a knee-length black dress under a waist-length red jacket with a black
collar, she looked relaxed as she embarked on what is being seen as her new
career as ``ambassador'' for Britain.
In the TV interview, the princess marked out a future role as an ambassador for
Britain abroad, a role the visit to the Argentine will help develop.
On arrival she will visit a number of hospitals and an old people's home,
showing the caring side of her nature, and will meet President Menem in person.
Meanwhile senior Tories were claiming a divorce between the Waleses was
inevitable. Mr James Hill, secretary of the Tory back-bench constitutional
affairs committee, said MPs were now virtually unanimous in the view that a
divorce was the only option - in which case the princess could not become Queen.
Downing Street insisted there had been no Ministerial discussions about the
prospects for a divorce.
q.The Queen last night paid her first visit to the Queen Mother since her hip
replacement operation last week. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the
Queen spent 40 minutes at the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers in London's
Marylebone.
q.Betting is being invited on who will be the next Queen - and the Princess of
Wales has started as even-money favourite. Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles is quoted
as 5-2 second favourite by bookmaker William Hill.

A FARMER continued feeding his cattle after being told a bridge had collapsed
into a river, a fatal accident inquiry was told yesterday at Glasgow Sheriff
Court.
Mr William Stark, 51, said that the bridge where two teenagers drowned was
``not my responsibility''.
Lawyer Mr Andrew Pollock said: ``Is feeding cattle more important than saving
lives?''
Mr Stark: ``Are you trying to say that I should have had the road coned off and
it was my responsibility?''
Mr Pollock: ``Yes, I am.''
The lawyer then said that Mr Stark had not bothered to telephone the police or
done anything to stop a vehicle going into the river. ``You had washed your
hands of the whole thing,'' said Mr Pollock.
Mr Stark: ``I didn't wash my hands of it. I didn't expect anyone to go down the
road to the bridge.''
Mr Stark, of Twechar Farm, Twechar, said he was busy and carried on with his
work.
He was giving evidence during the inquiry into the deaths of John Furay, 17,
and James McClement, 17, both of Twechar, who drowned when a VW Polo driven by
John Furay plunged into the rain-swollen River Kelvin when Gavell Bridge near
their homes collapsed last December 11.
A third youth, James Gibson, 18, also of Twechar, escaped by kicking the car
door open and raised the alarm.
Mr Stark told Mrs Margaret Porter, leading the evidence, he had decided to
check his fields earlier that morning and drove a tractor over the bridge. He
said the water was higher than the arch.
That afternoon he was working in his farm when a youth stopped his car and told
him the bridge had collapsed. He carried on working and went in to feed his
cattle.
Questioned by Mr Pollock, for John Furay's family, he said the four fields
surrounding the bridge were his but added: ``The bridge is not my
responsibility.''
The inquiry continues.

DEFENSIVE back Dave Wilson will stop playing Cupid to keep a date with the
Scottish Claymores for next season.
There were fears that Wilson, who runs a dating agency with his girlfriend
Jodie in his hometown of Los Angeles, would stand the Claymores up. But Wilson,
who signed halfway through last season, will close his dating agency down for a
couple of months next summer to re-join the Claymores - and leave some
Californian romantics with broken hearts.
``Jodie knows how much it means to me to come to Scotland to play and she is
fully supportive,'' he said. ``I'm really looking forward to the new season.''
Head coach Jim Criner also announced that 6ft 7in defensive lineman James
Spencer will re-join the team. He was signed from Barcelona Dragons with just
three games left last season but made an instant impact.

``She was really convinced she was going to walk away from this.
``She is a tough person but the thought of being in prison will be more than
she can cope with.
``I really fear she will try and kill herself.
On the verdict, he added: ``We were prepared for it, but it has still come as a
tremendous shock.
``I tried to prepare the children for the worst - but how on earth can you
prepare for something like this.
``There was always a fear that she would be found guilty and now it has
happened we will have to try and go away and rebuild or lives.''
The magistrate who fined Rosemary and Fred West for a brutal sex attack on a
teenager 22 years ago said yesterday: ``My conscience is clear.''
Mr John Smith, 86, was chairman of the bench when the Wests appeared before
Gloucester Magistrates charged with stripping, gagging, and indecently
assaulting lodger Carol Raine in 1973.
Just minutes after yesterday's conviction, he said: ``I certainly don't think I
was too lenient.
``I have nothing on my conscience whatsoever. I have nothing further to say.''
A witness in trial called for the death sentence for serial murderers and said
she would happily act as executioner of the woman who tormented her.
Kathryn Halliday, 37, who told the Winchester trial jury she was subjected to
``violent and aggressive'' lesbian sex by West, said: ``I would personally
volunteer to press the button on the electric chair or flick the switch to hang
her.
``That is what she deserves, that is what would give me most pleasure.''
Ms Halliday said she was ``absolutely delighted'' with Rosemary West's fate.
``At one stage we began to fear that she may get off on some of the murders,
but she has got what she deserves.
``I have always said there was a pact between Frederick and Rose West and I
believe there are still many more bodies to be found.''
Tory MP Barry Porter called on Home Secretary Michael Howard to give a pledge
that he would never contemplate the release of Rosemary West from prison.
Mr Porter, MP for South Wirral, said: ``It is simply beyond belief that any
Home Secretary, present or future, could even contemplate the possibility of
ever freeing her.''
Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP for Dover, said: ``The Home Secretary must now
give an undertaking that, within the powers he possesses, he would never allow
her to be released.
``Her crimes were so appalling that this is certainly a case where capital
punishment would be appropriate. However, we need to be assured that she will
remain in prison for the rest of her natural life, never to savour freedom
again.''
Wests' neighbours spoke of their relief at the verdicts.
Ernest and Olive Miles are the longest remaining residents at Cromwell Street
where number 25 stands derelict and boarded up.
Mrs Miles, 76, who has lived with her husband at number 45 for 48 years, said
the guilty verdicts were the right ones.
``What happened there within the walls of number 25 was the work of the devil -
the work of Satan,'' said Olive.
``No-one will ever know whether she was forced into it by her husband or not,
but guilty was the only verdict that the jury could have reached.''
Husband Ernest, 79, called for Rosemary West to be hanged.
``Prison's not good enough for her. She deserves all she gets for what she put
those innocent young women and girls through. How could any woman be party to
the murder of her own daughter and her little step-daughter?
``They should hang her in the centre of Gloucester - most local people would
agree with me and probably enjoy the spectacle,'' he said.
Dave Limbrick, 31, who lives at number 57, said: ``She must have known what was
going on under her own roof.
``I had met Fred West on the street a number of times. He seemed a bit thick
and was always grinning with a stupid smile on his face.
``We just thought he was happy about life in general, but we all know now it
was probably something far more sinister.''
He added: ``No-one noticed anything out of the ordinary. There were no real
clues to what was going on. Fred was always doing jobs for other people so it
didn't seem strange that he was always digging or doing jobs on the house.''
Cathy Barry, 20, is a relative newcomer to Cromwell Street.
The media studies student who lives at number 19 was well aware she was moving
to an infamous road but later found out that her bedroom was built by Fred West.
She said: ``My mother told me not to read the papers during the trial as she
thought it would frighten me, but I'm not really bothered. The bodies are all
gone now and life has to go on.
``You hear a lot about what the Wests were like. They seem to be weird but
no-one picked up on any clues.''
Miss Barry added that she and around a dozen other residents of Cromwell Street
had been paid to appear on ITV's The Time The Place discussion programme today
to describe what life is like living on Cromwell Street.
She said: ``Some people say they are tired of all the attention, but most love
it really.''
Last night, the wilting remains of bouquets of flowers laid in tribute to the
victims were on display outside number 25.
The doors and windows of semi-detached house were boarded up and the gate to
the back garden was locked to deter sightseers.
As darkness fell and people returned to their cars, television crews lit up the
neighbourhood with powerful lights.
Locals jeered at camera crews as they filmed the empty house - complete with a
freshly painted stripe of whitewash to cover obscene graffiti that has appeared
during the trial.
The infamous ``25 Cromwell Street'' iron sign that became synonymous with the
killings had been seized during the course of the police investigation.
Police have tried to ward off souvenir hunters.
Meanwhile, councillors and Gloucester's city mayor spoke of the notoriety that
the Wests' depravity had brought on the cathedral city.
Mayor Rose Workman said: ``We are all shocked and the people of Gloucester will
try their best now to get themselves back to what they were doing before.''
Continuing speculation over the presence of more bodies in the area would no
doubt continue to keep the city in the limelight, but Mrs Workman said: ``All
over the country parents who have had children leave home and who haven't heard
from them since must be wondering whether their children are still alive.
``I urge them if they are still alive, please ring home to let them know
they're OK.''
Despite the ghoulish reputation the city may have acquired during the West
chapter, tourist boss Philip Cooke said there had been no change in the number
of visitors.
One lesson for the future might be learned. A children's charity said adults
must learn to listen to children when they give out signals that there is
something wrong within their family.
Valerie Howarth, executive director of Childline, said it should not be
forgotten that the West murders only came to light after a remark by a child to
a Gloucestershire social worker who took it seriously and alerted police.
``The lesson for us all is that, no matter how fantastic a child's story may
seem, children should be listened to when they give out signals that there is
something very wrong in their families,'' said Mrs Howarth.

FOUR million British workers would gain additional holiday entitlements under
the EU working-time directive due to come into force in November 1996, a TUC
report claims today.
Britain, alone, is challenging the directive in the European Court of Justice.
Launching the report, Give Us A Break, TUC general secretary John Monks called
on the Government to end its ``workhouse mentality'' and endorse the directive.
Due to be introduced on November 23, 1996, the directive will provide an
immediate right to a minimum of three weeks paid annual leave, rising to four
weeks by 1999.
British workers stand to gain most from the directive as Britain is the only EU
member state with no legal right to paid leave. According to the TUC, over two
million British workers - eight out of 10 of them part-timers - get no paid
holiday leave at all while over four million - nearly one in five of all
employees - currently get less than four weeks paid leave per year.
Britain and the Netherlands share bottom place in the EU public holidays league
with just eight a year.

THE bones have long since been removed, but everyone walks around the white
ribbon marking the site where each of the the nine victims was unearthed, as if
it was a grave in a cemetery.
A white ribbon in the shape of a square and a card inscribed with the words
``Heather May West'' identifies the spot in the back garden where the Wests'
eldest daughter was found.
The patio under which she was buried has been dug up now, and the surface of
the Wests' back garden, where they used to hold their family barbecues, is now
one of uneven dirt and gravel.
The place where the bodies of Alison Chambers, Shirley Robinson, and Lynda
Gough were found were also marked with white ribbon and their names marked by
police for benefit of the jury, who walked around in pairs and in silence.
The extension built by Frederick West has largely been torn down, its dividing
walls marked by white and yellow painted stones.
The front door, through which so many victims were hustled, is jungle green
with 15 panels of gold, white, and blue glass.
On the back of an interior ground-floor door is a slightly old-fashioned,
almost life-size poster of a smiling young woman in a black nightdress, with an
unmade bed behind her.
The green door to the ground-floor front room - Rose's Room, as it was for some
time - has a peephole covered by a wooden cap. It is above waist level for
someone of average height, but at a height that would require a very short man,
like West, to stoop only slightly to see what was going on inside.
Inside the room, the peephole is obscured by a lucky white horseshoe. The floor
is covered by cut-up squares of carpet material in garish purple, green,
orange, and blue. Above the place where the bed would have been are two lights
fixed at an angle on the wall and pointing down.
The wallpaper is pink and blue, and there is a painting on a piece of hardboard
of a yellow vase with flowers in one corner. The most striking thing about the
room is how tiny it is, even without furniture.
The other ground-floor room, which was the Wests' bedroom, has a floral
wallpaper with cornflowers and pink stripes. A basin and sink unit with louvred
doors is in the corner, and there is an white artexed ceiling with fake black
beams.
In her statement, witness Miss X, described West's taste as ``naff''. There is
nothing in this room, or anywhere else in the house, to suggest she was being
unkind.
The 15 brown-carpeted stairs and dull green bannister lead to the first floor,
with its green weeping willow tree-pattern wallpaper, peeling as is most of the
wallpaper in the house.
On the first floor at the back, the wallpaper is a pattern of Chianti bottles,
wine glasses, corkscrews, tongs, carriage clocks, old-fashioned lamps, floral
plates, coffee pots, and vases of flowers.
On the same floor is the bathroom, ``the office'' as the Wests used to call it,
with its matching avocado bath and basin.
Nearby is the old bar-room, one wall of which is covered by a Caribbean scene,
of the kind seen in suburban travel agents in the seventies.
On the left in the picture are Bird of Paradise flowers familiar to tourists to
the Canaries and a rocky cliff runs down to the beach and the clear blue sea: a
scene from a tacky rum commercial.
The rest of the room is papered in floral flock, and there are two lamps with
cream shades beside what was once a fireplace.
Up a further flight of 15 steps is the top back room, the mirrors room, which
is papered with a silvery grey tree design. There is a mirror at ground level
as you enter, and mirrors on the fitted, louvred wardroobe. There is a vanity
unit and artexed ceiling with the same fake beams as below.
The doors in both the top-floor rooms have latch-handles and are wooden in an
arched, ranch style.
On the landing a small trapdoor leads to the roof.
In the front room there is a boarded-up fireplace, red floral wallpaper, and a
white skirting board.
Back on the ground floor, two steps, then a turn, then a further six steps lead
into the cellar, where the bodies of other victims were found. Again the places
their bones were unearthed are marked with a simple name card and either a
small circle or square of white ribbon. Anyone of average height has to stoop.
Black beams run through the cellar, and one section has been cut out by the
police. That section contained four holes and it is assumed that bound, taped,
and gagged victims were suspended from here as the West's carried out their
horrific, sadistic, and depraved attacks.
On one wall is a childlike drawing of a couple of cowboys, one with a black hat
and Zapata moustache, the other with a cigar and a pistol in a holster on his
hip. What looks like a squaw, with a feather in her hair, is almost obliterated
by wear.
The phrase ``Tar 4 Ian'' followed by a heart is still visible on one wall and
there are children's scribbling marks in crayon.
Latterly, this was used as the children's bedroom. They slept above the remains
of victims.
The cellar is lit by builders' lights now, and one brick has been removed. You
can hear the sound of music from outside.
The most striking aspect of the house is how tiny it is, how small the rooms
are, and how close together. It would have been impossible for people within it
not to know the business of others.
The bodies were unearthed from tiny spaces. The low-ceilinged cellar is dark
and claustrophic. It is impossible to imagine how terrifying it must have been
for the victims to have been taken in there against their will.

VETERAN entertainer Charlie Chester was seriously ill yesterday after suffering
a stroke at home.
Chester, 82, was taken unconscious to the Kent and Canterbury Hospital in
Canterbury on Tuesday night. His wife, Joan, was at his bedside yesterday.
``There has been some improvement overnight and he is now conscious but he is
to have a brain scan,'' said a BBC Pebble Mill spokesman yesterday.
Charlie Chester's Sunday Soapbox show on Radio 2 has been running since 1969.
The original idea was to have a radio letters page with listeners writing in
with their news and views.
Since then it has become a huge self-help show where people offer goods which
they would otherwise throw out and exchange them over the air. Chester, awarded
an MBE in 1991, is a former King Rat of the Grand Order of Water Rats - the
showbiz charity organisation.

A POST-GRADUATE student, who has conducted a long-running campaign of abuse
against Aberdeen University and its Principal, Professor Maxwell Irvine, now
faces the prospect of imprisonment.
A judge has found Peter Dow in contempt of court and breach of interdict for
continuing his campaign.
Mr Dow, 29, has disrupted university meetings and issued thousands of leaflets.
He has likened Professor Irvine to Hitler and Stalin and described him ``and
his criminal gang'' as potential killers.
In a written judgment issued at the Court of Session yesterday, Lord Kirkwood
said that, in 1991, Dow, of Hollybank Place, Aberdeen, had his dissertation on
the subject of magnetic resonance imaging - a medical scanner technology -
failed by the university and he lost a series of appeals.
Mr Dow started a campaign against the university and in particular against the
Principal. He claimed that lives were being put at risk because his expertise
would not be available to the public.
In court, Mr Dow, who conducted his own case, admitted that he had continued to
publish and distribute thousands of leaflets. His position was that everything
in them was true and that the university was trying to stop him from telling
the truth.
The judge said Mr Dow had demonstrated quite clearly that he was incapable of
accepting any decision that went against him. His allegations were totally
without substance.
Another court hearing has been fixed for December 14 to consider what sentence
should be imposed.

THE future of the house at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, is still uncertain.
The early Victorian building, stands with its windows and doors bricked up, and
no firm decision has yet been taken. Its future rests largely in the hands of
the West family and solicitors.
The adjoining three-storey property, which is also privately owned, is unfit
for human habitation. Like its neighbour it was once divided into flats.
Number 25 has been gutted by the intensive activities of police search teams.
Its infamous cellar contains tons of concrete poured in after the digging to
preserve the foundations from collapse.
Restoration to any sort of habitable condition is likely to be costly.
Cromwell Street lies just outside an inner-city area which is expected to
attract #15m in regeneration grants.
But the 142-year-old West home - once owned by a former Mayor of Gloucester
from 1974-5, Mr Frederick King - is unlikely to attract much cash aid.
The house forms an important part of Fred West's estate, and automatically
falls to be divided among his widow and his children.
Gloucester City Council holds the mortgage, which is nearing the end of its
term. As the planning authority, it has an interest in any proposals for the
house and its site.
The council has not declared support for any particular option, but is unlikely
to favour schemes which might bring the ghoulishly curious to the area. It is
believed to prefer proposals which would have broad community support.
One scheme thought to be under consideration is the erection of a memorial in
the nearby central park - on the opposite side of which stands the Wests'
former home at 25 Midland Road.
A church group has proposed buying 25 Cromwell Street, razing it and creating a
memorial garden.
One wealthy local businessman, Mr Keith Gardner, raised more than #15,000 to
help the inter-faith group's bid. But he withdrew his support after it emerged
that the group also planned to build an office on the land.
Mr Gardner now plans to form a co-operative to buy the site.
Rosemary West could still benefit financially from her husband's estate of
which the house forms an important part.
As he died without making a will, she is entitled to a share of his estate
which could now be quite considerable.
However the real money-spinner for Rosemary West and the couple's children
could be documents and materials created as a result of the police inquiry.
Rosemary West's solicitor, Mr Leo Goatley, maintains: ``She does not wish to
benefit from Frederick West's estate. Anything of realisable value that is
legitimately within Frederick West's estate she would gift to her children.''
Up for sale are transcripts of more than 100 hours of taped police interviews
and taped interviews by Fred West's first solicitor, Mr Howard Ogden; papers
relating to Fred West's defence and, perhaps most sensational, a lengthy
document he wrote while being held on remand.
The document, thought to be a resume of his life story, and entitled ``I was
Loved by an Angel'', was recovered with other papers after he was found hanged
in his cell.
Potential buyers are likely to be the media. The material could command a
significant price. Already some members of the West family have attracted
five-figure sums for their life stories.
The Official Solicitor of the Supreme Court, Mr Peter Harris, has been
appointed to administer Fred West's estate.
A spokesman for Mr Harris said: ``However distasteful some of the material may
be, his legal duty as administrator of the estate is to obtain the best value
he can for the assets, in order first to satisfy legitimate claims on the
estate.''

MOTORSPORT
COLIN McRae yesterday completed an emphatic victory in the Network Q RAC Rally
to be crowned Britain's first world rally champion and the youngest-ever winner
of the title.
To achieve his second successive win in the British event the Scot tamed his
team-mate and rival Carlos Sainz to triumph by 36 seconds at the end of 28
testing special stages and four days of hectic action.
More than 2000 fans chanted ``easy, easy'' at the official rally finish at
Chester Racecourse while McRae sprayed champagne from the bonnet of his Subaru
Imprenza with co-driver Derek Ringer.
``I am sure this will be the first world championship of many for Colin, the
way he is driving at the moment,'' said team manager David Richards, whose
controversial decision last month could have cost 27-year-old McRae the title.
The relationship was strained almost to breaking point when Richards imposed
team orders on the Catalonia Rally in order to ensure that Sainz won, sending
both into the final event level on points.
McRae belatedly obeyed, but all that was forgotten in the moment of triumph
yesterday as he celebrated victory with his father Jimmy, who won the Historic
Rally, and brother Alister, who was fourth overall.
Colin deserved the title for the way in which he battled back after two
punctures had come close to deflating his championship dream on the second day.
``Colin had his setbacks in the early part of the rally, but there was never a
moment when he did not give the impression that he was in total control and
knew he could get the time back,'' added Richards.
The Lanark-born racer - whose previous successes have ensured a luxury
lifestyle, with homes in Switzerland and Monte Carlo - kept himself in
contention by hammering his broken suspension into shape with a log. He had
seen his lead wiped out in killer Kielder Forest in Northumberland, McRae
responded by gradually clawing back the 74-seconds deficit on Sainz.
McRae had to finish ahead of the double champion to take the title and
gradually gnawed away at the Spaniard's lead with a series of storming drives
in the rain-lashed, mud-splattered forest roads of Wales yesterday.
He won six of the seven timed tests to regain the lead on the final stage and
hold a 17-second cushion when the drivers returned to Wales for the climax.
McRae extended that to 38 seconds by winning the first four legs - taking his
rally total to 17 out of a possible 28 - before Sainz finally got the better of
him by three seconds. But he was never going to threaten further.
Richard Burns ensured Subaru added their first manufacturers' title by
finishing third - having nearly gone out on the first stage when his steering
broke - 6min 39sec down on the winner. ``This is just fantastic, especially as
I thought our rally was over after stage one,'' said Burns.
Final positions - 1, C McRae/D Ringer (Britain) Subaru 5-09-19; 2, C Sainz/L

PERTH can claim to be Scotland's most popular shopping centre outside Glasgow
and Edinburgh, its pleasant surroundings offering an attractive and individual
environment.
The city has one of the highest proportions of independently owned specialist
retailing businesses in Britain, and with many of the well-known High Street
stores located there, the consumer is spoilt            for choice.
The city centre boasts famous names such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Frasers, Austin
Reid, Laura Ashley, Ernest Jones, James Thin and Waterstone, and the indepedent
sector is represented by McEwans of Perth, a department store with a trading
history of 125 years.
There are many small speciality shops offering a wide range of wares such as
international designer clothes, antiques, home furnishings, art and health
foods. Independent shops such as Ringmaker, Sandalwood Shoes, and Cairncross
the jewellers are also represented.
At the nearby St Catherine's Retail Park, the DIY enthusiast has Textile World,
Texas, MFI, Carpetwise, Concepts, B&amp;Q, Currys and Halfords. There is a Safeway
supermarket in the park, and the city also has Tesco and Asda stores.
Within the past few years, Perth has carried out some structural and
environmental improvements. Sign posting, pedestrianisation, street furniture
and hanging baskets have all received unanimous approval from retailers and
consumers.
There is ample long and short-term parking within a five or 10-minute radius of
the centre, and parking charges are low compared with other cities.
Excellent hotels and restaurants offer high quality cuisine including game,
salmon, beef, lamb, seafood and Scottish fruits. In celebration of the
district's produce and cuisine, Perth has established an annual Food Festival.
In fact, Perth is very much a city of festivals, with a Festival of Jazz and
Festival of the Arts as well as many sports events, including the Perth
Scottish Rally and Perth Golf Festival.
Recently the Fair City was recognised in Europe as the UK entry in Entente
Florale as Perth in Bloom - a city of lovely gardens and colourful hanging
baskets. The Perth in Bloom initiative has encouraged the whole community to
work together to protect and enhance Perth's natural setting and agricultural
inheritance.
It is this blend of civic pride which has brought national and international
awards to a city also renowned for its cleanliness and concern for the
environment.
House prices in and around Perth compare favourably with other areas in
Scotland. The average cost of a two-bedroom flat is #33,250 and a three-bedroom
semi-detached averages #46,600.
Here is how the housing stock breaks down: private 40,594 (sheltered 50), local
authority 13,230 (sheltered 132), housing association 690 (sheltered 174),
Scottish Homes 204.
The Band D council tax of #659 is below the Scottish average    of #670.

ONLY two Scots remain in the men's singles for day one of the Scottish Open
proper. Most hopefuls fell at the first hurdle when confronted with a top-class
international field at the Kelvin Hall.
Former Scottish champion Jim Mailer was the sole survivor of the men's singles
pre-qualifying and will join current national champion Bruce Flockhart in the
main draw.
Stirling's Mailer put out fellow Scot Alan Gooding by 15-2, 15-1 and followed
up with a 15-2, 15-7 victory over Yannick Gosselin of Canada.
Mailer will have his work cut out against former European champion and English
No.1 Darren Hall in the first round, but Flockhart should progress at the
expense of Jean Francois Mercier of Canada.
The women fared worse, with only Anne Gibson, who was given direct entry, ining
up in the singles today. Gillian Martin was a surprise casualty, going down to
Pernille Harder of Denmark in three games 11-4, 2-11, 4-11. Qualifying Scots:
Men's singles - J Mailer (Scotland) beat A Gooding (Scotland) 15-2, 15-1;

SEVERAL farmers suspected of selling cattle from herds infected with ``mad
cow'' disease BSE face prosecution, Strathclyde Trading Standards officials
warned yesterday.
It is believed that up to six cases are currently under investigation and
reports are being prepared for the procurator-fiscal.
The announcement follows the conviction of an Ayr farmer who admitted
submitting false documents relating to the sale of six cows. Richard Wilson was
fined #400 after he admitted four charges under the Trades Description Act.

A MAN accused of sexually harassing two women was called various abusive names
by colleagues, an industrial tribunal was told yesterday.
One of the women alleging harassment, a 37-year-old office worker, denied
calling or ever hearing colleagues call the man a ``left-footer'', a
``poofter'', or an upstart.
However, giving evidence on the second day of her sex discrimination case
against a Glasgow based company, she agreed he had been called Mr Perfect, a
weirdo, and Hitler, and claimed he described himself as ``the wee brat that
sits in the corner''.
She and another woman claim they were sexually harassed by a male colleague.
The tribunal has ruled that none of the parties involved can be identified
until the panel's decision is issued.
Solicitor David Walker, representing the alleged harasser, suggested to the
37-year-old woman that another woman, who she claimed had left because of the
way his client had treated her, had actually returned north to her family home
because of a business problem there.
She also told the tribunal that she did not know of a nickname being used for
him, and said she had never heard of him being called a rent boy, but agreed
she may have heard of him being called a weirdo, and it had been said he was a
``wee Hitler'', but not a ``poofter'', nor a ``left-footer''.
She said he had responded: ``I'm just the wee brat in the corner'' when someone
asked how he was.
``I don't think I called him any derogatory names, that I can recall. I don't
have a high opinion of him and have spoken to that effect, but I never called
him names.''
She claimed a female colleague would not speak out for fear of being a future
target.
The tribunal was told that he suffered from stress and the allegations made him
ill.
The hearing continues.

Sarajevo, Wednesday
BOSNIAN Government leaders returned home tonight to the cheers of hundreds of
Sarajevans who hope that they at last are seeing an end to the war that has
kept them bottled up in their besieged capital for three-and-a-half years.
A guard of honour stood at attention outside the presidency building in
Sarajevo and people threw flowers as President Alija Izetbegovic and Prime
Minister Haris Silajdzic arrived home from peace talks in the United States.
``Alija, we love you,'' people yelled, applauding their leader and the peace
they hope he has brought them.
However Silajdzic cautioned that the key to a lasting peace was full
implementation, something for which the international community and a Nato
force of up to 60,000 troops - one-third of them American - will be essential.
``We have peace on paper,'' Silajdzic said. ``Implementation is everything
now.''
``Sarajevo is a free town once this peace is implemented,'' he said. Provisions
in the peace deal reached in Dayton, Ohio, yesterday allow for Sarajevo to be a
united city under government control. Parts are currently held by Serbs.
That was a key government demand, and the spontaneous gathering of about 600
people to welcome him reflected the high hopes of Sarajevans that their city,
under Serb siege since April 1992, will again be free and united.
``I hope there will be no more war,'' said Haris Muratspahic, 11, who joined
the crowd on his way home from school. ``In peace, first I would like to go to
the sea.''
While Bosnian Government leaders reluctantly accepted the peace deal, Bosnian
Serbs angrily rejected it, claiming they were sold out at Dayton by Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic, who negotiated on their behalf.
Their defiance has scuttled previous plans, and could be crucial once more.
Momcilo Krajisnik, a rebel leader, said the Bosnian Serb leadership rejected
the plan because it kept Sarajevo in Bosnian Government hands, allowed a land
corridor linking the Bosnian capital with the government-controlled enclave of
Gorazde, and did not give the Serbs a wider corridor linking their lands.
The summit deal was also met with silence by Bosnian Serb ``president'' Radovan
Karadzic and his army commander General Ratko Mladic.
No statement came from the pair, who led the Bosnian Serbs through
three-and-a-half years of war and have been indicted twice by the UN for war
crimes.
Hard-liners demanded a session of the Bosnian Serb republic's parliament, which
they control, to oppose the agreement negotiated in their name.
Trifko Radic, president of the war presidency of Serb Sarajevo, said: ``World
powers, and even Yugoslavia, can make different calculations for their own
interests, but more than 150,000 Serbs in Serb Sarajevo cannot accept such a
solution after so much killing and suffering.''
However the Serbs made no threat to break the ceasefire in Bosnia and at least
one senior officer, defence minister Milan Ninkovic, broke ranks to praise the
agreement.
In Belgrade, the Serbian capital, the agreement was welcomed with joyous
anticipation that the United Nations would lift economic sanctions, imposed for
Milosevic's role in fomenting the Serb rebellion against Bosnia's secession
from Yugoslavia in early 1992 that started the war.
Tonight the UN Security Council indeed voted unanimously to lift the strict
trade embargo on Belgrade, and to lift an arms ban on the rest of former
Yugoslavia for a six-month period.
Milosevic, who was portrayed as a hero by Serbian state media, said on his
return to Belgrade: ``The goal.......was peace. That goal has been successfully
reached; a just peace for all nations who live in these regions.''
In Zagreb, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said the peace deal had
implications beyond former Yugoslavia.
``We got peace,'' Tudjman said. ``Peace for Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but
also peace for Europe, peace for the world.
UN officials noted that repatriating refugees would be difficult.
``We certainly hope that the peace will work, we would like it to work and for
people to come back,'' said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees.
However he urged foreign countries hosting about 700,000 refugees ``not to be
too hasty in trying to send people back''.-AP/Reuter.
q FOREIGN Secretary Malcolm Rifkind welcomed the ``historic'' Bosnian peace
agreement and urged all the warring factions to back it, writes William Russell.
Mr Rifkind pledged to MPs at Westinster that Britain would play a central role
in helping to bring about a lasting peace and announced a Peace Implementation
Conference in London on December 8 and 9, three days after the peace agreement
is signed in Paris.
He cautioned against over-optimism, saying: ``The first requirement is that the
parties live up to their commitments.
``Unless they abide by what they have agreed, and work to make that settlement
a success, the documents initialled at Dayton are just pieces of paper.''
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook also welcomed the agreement, but warned
that ``implementing the peace accord will require as much effort and patience
as getting agreement to it in the first place''.
Mr Cook offered support for any responsible plan to reinforce British troops in
the region to implement the peace plan, saying: ``The nation will now want
British troops to finish the job by helping to establish the peace.''
Some 15,000 British troops are expected to be deployed, as opposed to the 5000
at present, with a further 3000 based in support services.

HEALTH boards who were slow to take their patients back have left the State
Hospital at Carstairs close to being full twice this year, general manager Dick
Manson said today in his annual report.
The hospital, which has a capacity of 236, has come within half-a-dozen
patients of that, partly because of increased demand as well as the pace of
return to home health boards.
Carstairs houses and treats patients who are too dangerous to themselves or
others for mainstream psychiatry services, and Mr Manson said: ``We aim always
to have available beds to immediately admit dangerous people who need to be
here for treatment.''
Greater Glasgow is understood to be one of the boards principally involved, but
a spokesman for the Greater Glasgow Community and Mental Health Trust said
yesterday it had been taking more Carstairs patients than in previous years.
``Since 1990 we have averaged 20 a year, but since July this year we have taken
back 16. There have been occasions when we have been unable to take patients,
but this is for a number of reasons.
``One important one is that some of them have worked their way through the
system to the point where they are living in flats on the perimeter of the
state hospital to get used to independence, and our psychiatrists think it
would be a retrograde step to go from there to a locked ward at Gartnavel, for
example.''
q A schoolboy of 15 has been put in a locked psychiatric ward with adults
because there are no facilities for dealing with patients his age in Scotland.
The boy from East Kilbride was in the Adolescent Psychiatry Unit at Gartnavel
Royal Hospital in Glasgow until an incident when he brandished a knife and a
teacher had to disarm him.
Since then he has been in the secure ward at Hartwood Hospital in Lanarkshire.
Now his parents have been told he may have to be transferred to Manchester to
get appropriate treatment in the only unit of its kind in the UK.
His father said: ``He began suffering depression over the past year, missing
school and getting into trouble, and he lost his friends. Now he has been
diagnosed as suffering from psychosis.''

COLIN McRae's first steps towards winning the biggest prize in rallying and
becoming the first Briton to win the World Rally Championship began two years
ago with a limited overseas programme, driving a Subaru Legacy.
Team manager David Richards secured the then 25-year-old McRae under contract.
The Scot began repaying the investment in his burgeoning talent with two
victories, New Zealand and Malaysia.
Last year - at the wheel of a Subaru Impreza 555 - he added the Network Q RAC
Rally and Rally Australia to his win in New Zealand. But 1994 also had its
downs. In Monte Carlo, he crashed and was relegated to tenth. Portugal ended
with a fire, and Corsica after an accident. In May's Acropolis Rally, he was
excluded after a verbal clash with officials, and he crashed out of the Rally
Argentina.
He won the final round of the series but it also created new pressures. Colin
and Derek Ringer - his co-driver of nine years' standing - were now tipped as
hot favourites to win the 1995 championship.
In January's opening round in Monte Carlo McRae crashed out on an icy corner.
In the snowy forests of Sweden he retired with engine failure. After two of the
eight rounds he didn't have a single point. He managed third place in Portugal
and, after fifth in Corsica, New Zealand again was the watershed. His
domination was total.
After the Asia-Pacific, it was in September's Rally Australia that a new,
mature McRae emerged. Lying first equal with Kenneth Eriksson's Mitsubishi, he
let the Swede take victory and settled for championship points.
The seventh round was in Spain - home ground for Carlos Sainz, a rival for the
title.
Starting the final day, he was second to Sainz but team orders dictated they
should hold their positions. It was only after much persuasion by Richards and
Colin's father, Jimmy, that McRae reluctantly booked in late at the final
control, letting Sainz win.
The scene was now set for an emotional and public showdown on McRae's home
event. Fairly and squarely the better man won.

IRISH Prime Minister John Bruton last night criticised Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew for displaying ``immutability'' in a speech on the
peace process.
Mr Bruton, currently caught up in negotiations with Mr John Major aimed at
resolving the impasse, also said that risks had to be taken to overcome the
current problems.
His comments came after Sir Patrick repeated Britain's demands for IRA moves
towards decommissioning their weapons ahead of Sinn Fein's entry into all-party
talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
Mr Bruton said: ``If we are going to move forward, we must recognise the need
for compromise. You cannot lay down a set, immutable position - as I feel Sir
Patrick was laying down today - and expect there are going to be compromises.
``There must be mutability, not immutability, in this area.''
His remarks were seen as a signal of the Dublin Government's concern over the
address delivered by Sir Patrick in Londonderry.
The tone of the Secretary of State's remarks were regarded by some sources
close to the Irish Government as unhelpful in the present climate.
Mr Bruton also emphasised last night that the so-called twin-track approach
evolved with Mr Major earlier this year had to deal with the arms and all-party
talks issue if it was to succeed. ``Otherwise it is a waste of time,'' he said.
Sir Patrick said yesterday in Londonderry that the paramilitaries had to
provide the confidence necessary to prove that they were committed to democracy.
But they could not expect to ``keep a foot in both camps, to sign up as it were
to `democracy a la carte'.''
He emphasised the need for progress on decommissioning, and insisted that it
did not amount to a demand for ``surrender of the IRA or even IRA weapons''.
The Government had an open mind about how actual decommissioning should happen
in practice.
US President Bill Clinton's is due to visit to Britain and Ireland at the end
of next week.

GLASGOW Under-21s, who open their district campaign against South next
Wednesday, just edged a testing match at Braidholm last night.
The students led 11-6 at half-time through a try by full back Richard Bailes
and two penalties by Dundee centre Neil Paterson against two penalties by
Martin Hose.
Two tries by winger Geoff Caldwell and a conversion and penalty by Hose put
Glasgow into the lead but two penalties by Paterson and a drop goal by
Edinburgh centre James How almost produced victory for the students.
Glasgow Under-21 - T Greenshields (West of Scotland); G Caldwell (GHK), A
Bulloch (West of Scotland), C Sangster (Stirling County), J Craig (West of
Scotland); M Hose (Edinburgh Academicals), J Weston (Watsonians); D Porte

q WALES stand-off Neil Jenkins kicked Pontypridd to a comfortable win by 31-12

He landed eight penalties and converted the only try - from David Manley - as
negative play from both sides ruined the Pool C game. Milan had flanker Massimo
Giovanelli sent off for butting in 67 minutes, after he had been warned in the

MI5 ``watchers'' targeted two men codenamed Speaker's Choice and Bad News in a
Scottish pub, the High Court in Glasgow was told yesterday.
The surveillance operation, which spanned four days, started in Tam Bain's, a
pub in Mary Street, Laurieston, Falkirk, and continued with security service
agents shadowing a Renault estate car as it headed south.
They were even watching as one of the occupants of the car was sick near the
front entrance of a motorway service area on the M6. The watching brief ended
outside another pub, this time in Liverpool.
Yesterday, three of the MI5 ``watchers'', their names given in court as Mr C,
Ms D, and Mr G, gave evidence behind a screen so that their identities could be
protected.
It is the first time that MI5 officers have given evidence in a Scottish court,
and only the second time that witnesses have been screened from the public for
security reasons.
On trial are six men - three Scots from Laurieston, Bonnybridge, and Airdrie, a
Liverpudlian, and two men from Northern Ireland.
They are Mr John Johnston, 49, of Campbell Crescent, Laurieston, Mr Francis
Hives, 45, of Liverpool, Mr William McArthur, 41, of Ure Crescent, Bonnybridge,
Mr David White, 29, of Northburn Avenue, Airdrie, Mr Alexander Davidson, 23,
and Mr Lindsay Robb, 28, of Lurgan, Northern Ireland.
Mr Robb was one of the loyalist team involved in peace talks with the
Government at Stormont earlier this year.
All six deny conspiring in their homes and in pubs to further the cause of the
Ulster Volunteer Force by acquiring firearms, ammunition, and explosive
substances intending to endanger life in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
Part of the conspiracy alleges drug trafficking to raise money for use in
connection with terrorism.
The court was told that Mr Johnston was identified by the MI5 watchers as
Speaker's Choice, and Mr McArthur as Bad News.
It was claimed they were joined by Mr White for the journey in Mr McArthur's
taxi to the Market pub in Liverpool.
The agents told Mr Ian Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, how they watched comings and
goings at Tam Bain's, beginning on July 19.
Mr C claimed that one of the men in the pub resembled Mr Robb, and he told how
Bad News - Mr McArthur - possibly identified him, because he was very alert.
Earlier, the court was told of a police search of Mr Johnstone's home, during
which a handgun was found.
The trial before Lord Sutherland is expected to last one month.

KYLES Athletic, who declined to take part in this season's national premier
league, face their stiffest test to date when they re-enter mainstream
competition in the Bank of Scotland Celtic Society Cup.
Kyles lead the new South first division by six points and are unbeaten in
league games. They face Oban Camanachd, last season's South champions, who
languish just above the foot of the premier division and have yet to show any
of the form which took them to within an ace of causing a major upset in last
year's Camanachd Cup final.
Camanachd will go to Kyles as underdogs. They are weakened by the continuing
absence of Dougie MacIntyre and Dave McUish, who could be out for six weeks
with a broken hand. But they have Alex MacVicar back after a five-game ban,
although it is not clear where he will play, the defence having played
reasonably well in his absence.
Kyles are likely to persist with the ploy of playing the vastly experienced
Andy Irvine up front.
In the north, Kingussie should comfortably defeat Skye in the MacTavish Cup and
premier side Newtonmore should beat Caberfeidh at home.
The Camanachd Association say they are willing to meet Lochaber District
councillors about their proposals for the upgrading of An Aird Park in Fort
William. Council officials have gone to great lengths to explain that their
plans for national status for the field do not involve a monopoly of major
finals, as had been suggested. Association president Duncan Cameron has
welcomed this clarification.

Sheila Waddell meets the men behind a successful management buyout
GAELIC Factors is moving towards its twentieth year as a new independent
company. Formerly part of James Finlay, the Glasgow-based tea traders, the
company was recently bought out by its existing management for #1.25m.
James Finlay had previously announced the intention to sell-off the company's
financial interests in order to concentrate on core tea-growing and
confectionery businesses, and the management team of Gaelic Factors seized the
opportunity to buy-out the company.
Managing director David Russell, who set up the company in 1976, explained:
``James Finlay were keen to divest themselves of their interests on the
financial side, and we felt this was an excellent business to purchase. This
also enabled us to maintain our independence from other larger factors or
banks, as well as protecting the jobs of our 30 staff, jobs which were not
guaranteed had the business been sold to another party.
``During the buy-out we were advised by the corporate division of Touche Ross,
who introduced us to several financial institutions and eventually found us a
highly satisfactory package from the Bank of Scotland, who were the company's
first bankers in 1976. The package from the Bank of Scotland means that all the
company's banking will now be carried out at 110 Queen Street, where the
company has enjoyed a tremendous relationship over the years. The legal work
for the buy-out was handled by Semple Fraser.''
Gaelic Factors is basically a finance company which assists in financing the
cashflow of small to medium-sized companies by providing a facility against
their debtors. Rather than waiting for money to come in from invoices - a
process which takes on average 72 days - companies send their invoices to
Gaelic Factors who advance 75% of the payment within 24 hours of the invoices
being sent in. Gaelic takes the legal assignation over these invoices, and the
customers of the company pay them. Gaelic then remit the further 25% to
clients, minus their charges, when they have collected the total amount due.
Charges vary according to the industry a company is operating in, the size of
the company and its turnover, as well as the length of time clients take to
pay.
Gaelic Factors charge on a weekly basis, and, relating costs to turnover, they
expect the total cost to be in the region of 1!s%-45/8, with their interest
charges varying in line with those of the base rate of high street banks.
Finance Director John Doyle pointed out the tremendous growth potential of the
business. ``According to the Bank of England, only 10% of companies who could
benefit from factoring currently use the system, so there is an enormous
potential for growth. It is now being recommended by Government bodies like the
Department of Trade and Industry, because it is sometimes difficult for
companies without the necessary security to obtain loans from a bank or even
overdraft facilities.
``The CBI is also encouraging its members to use factoring services as a tool
to expand their businesses and ensure a smooth cashflow.''
Director James Cameron said: ``We have a wide range of clients in industries as
diverse and printing, engineering, food processing, security, contract cleaning
and grass cutting. Many of these businesses are labour intensive, and therefore
benefit from a smooth cashflow to ensure prompt payments of wages and
suppliers.''
The company prides itself on giving a very personal service. David Russell
emphasised: ``Because of our size we are able to offer a more personal service
than the major players. We have clients throughout the UK, including a large
number recommended by chartered accountants in London. Because of our personal
service we can relate to our clients and understand their needs.''
The company has around 150 clients, the bulk of them small to medium sized
companies. The average company they assist has a turnover of
three-quarters-of-a-million pounds.
The target market is any company with a turnover of between #150,000 and #5m
although, strictly speaking, there is no upper limit.
The benefits of the fast, efficient service Gaelic Factors offer are obvious.
For example, security companies employing factory guards find they can send
their invoices in the morning. If they arrive before 11 o'clock a cheque is
written and ready for that afternoon to pay the guards' wages.
Since 1976, annual turnover has risen from #750,000 to #85m and David Russell
and his fellow directors aim to continue the steady growth of the company,
without losing its service ethic.

GAELIC Factors, which operates from Finlay House at 10-14 West Nile Street, was
originally set up by David Russell in 1976.
Within a year it became part of the James Finlay Group, a move that helped
raise its profile, lengthen its reach and allow it to take advantage of
opportunities in a growing market.
The management buy-out completed last month will enable the company to maintain
its independence and its position as the only factor with a head office in
Scotland.
The company is headed by managing director David Russell, 53, an accountant and
company secretary in the printing industry before he became managing director
of City and County House Purchase Company in 1969. When this was bought over in
1975 he established Gaelic Factors.
In 1978 the senior management team was strengthened when James Cameron, 58, a
banker with 20 years experience in the finance industry, joined the company as
general manager. James, who had previously worked with David Russell at City
and County House Purchase, is responsible for the day to day operations of the
business.
The third member of the Management Buy Out team is John Doyle, 43. Formerly a
chartered accountant with Dallas Nicol and Company in Paisley, who were
Gaelic's auditors, John joined the company in 1985 as finance director.
The company also has four managers: sales manager Robin Russell, general
manager Jean Tunmore, senior credit manager Scott Melville and office manager
Jim Walker.
Gaelic Factors places a heavy emphasise on personal service and does not employ
salesmen. Normally inquiries are handled at sales manager or director level.
Because they are dealing with principals of the company, clients receive a
quick decision, certainly within 48 hours compared to the industry norm of
several weeks. This personal contact continues with customers after they are on
the books, as the three directors are available to help with any problems.
With factoring, a regular weekly cashflow is generated, relieving clients from
the worry of temporary difficulties over the payment of wages and accounts.
Through factoring, raw materials may be bought in bulk or at keener discounts
through early settlement. Savings can also be made in labour costs, while
business profitability should improve through savings on bank interest.
Unlike a bank overdraft, there is no limit to the amount of cash available on a
client's account. The only limit to factoring as a source of finance is the
client's own ability to manufacture and sell its goods and services. Gaelic
Factors are members of the Association of Invoice Factors and have credit
facilities from the Bank of Scotland.

ONLY two Scots remain in the men's singles for day one of the Scottish Open
proper. Most hopefuls fell at the first hurdle when confronted with a top-class
international field at the Kelvin Hall.
Former Scottish champion Jim Mailer was the sole survivor of the men's singles
pre-qualifying and will join current national champion Bruce Flockhart in the
main draw.
Stirling's Mailer put out fellow Scot Alan Gooding by 15-2, 15-1 and followed
up with a 15-2, 15-7 victory over Yannick Gosselin of Canada.
Mailer will have his work cut out against former European champion and English
No.1 Darren Hall in the first round, but Flockhart should progress at the
expense of Jean Francois Mercier of Canada.
The women fared worse, with only Anne Gibson, who was given direct entry, ining
up in the singles today. Gillian Martin was a surprise casualty, going down to
Pernille Harder of Denmark in three games 11-4, 2-11, 4-11. Qualifying Scots:
Men's singles - J Mailer (Scotland) beat A Gooding (Scotland) 15-2, 15-1;
Mailer beat Y Gosselin (Canada) 15-2, 15-7.
Men's doubles - B Flockhart and C Johnston (Scotland) beat G Simpson and B
Sutherland (Scotland) 15-2, 15-0; Flockhart and Johnston beat Y Gosselin and S
Methot (Canada) 15-7, 15-6; Flockhart and Johnston beat D Forbes and R
Lethbridge (Scotland) 15-10, 15-10; D Gilmour and G Haldane (Scotland) beat G
Brockie (Scotland) and T Sorensen (Denmark) 15-4, 15-0: Gilmour and Haldane
beat C Dow and I Nixon (Scotland) 15-8, 15-2; L Dewart and A Dillon (Scotland)
beat B Hogg and B Kinnaird (Scotland) 15-9, 15-11.
Women's doubles - L McCallum and L Robertson (Scotland) beat K SNeddon and A
Thain (Scotland) 15-6, 15-8; McCallum and Robertson wo, H Blair and K Graham
(Scotland) scr.
Mixed doubles - D Murray and C Tedman (Scotland) beat G Simpson and K Sneddon

<FLAG>John Beattie's Diary</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>975241291</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
STEVE Munro, the former Scotland winger, has told the Diary that his club, Ayr,
is to hold a crisis meeting on Wednesday at which the future of the club is to
be discussed.
I gather that there is deep unrest at the club, and suspicion about the funding
of three New Zealanders who are at Millbrae but do not have jobs.
Munro, and fellow club member Malcolm Wilkinson, are to make presentations on
the evening.
``We have to define what being a member of the first XV at Ayr means, and I
think we have to define it as a largely amateur role. But, for clarity's sake,
it has to be spelt out and everyone has to be aware of what we are about,''
said Munro.
``There will be a standard package, perhaps, which includes blazer, boots, and
a tour every two years. I see two or three areas to progress. We need someone
as director of coaching, perhaps one full-time professional as an employee of
the club, and we need to add a multi-sport role, and a multi-sex outlook, to
Ayr rugby club.
``There may be 10 quid given to the players after a match for beer money, but
that would have to be spent at the club.''
Munro has consulted with SRU director of rugby, Jim Telfer, and Keith
Robertson, to examine the club structure at Melrose. ``We are in the fourth
division, and we want to be challenging at the top,'' says Munro.
``I think if we clearly define ourselves in this way, players will be
attracted. I think that many clubs will follow Ayr and Melrose as they try to
define what it means, for players and clubs in Scotland, to enter the
professional era. If you don't spell it out you're whistling in the dark.''
Out of tune
IT was good to bump into Alex Moore, the former Scotland winger, on Saturday.
Alex, who won six caps as an Edinburgh Accies player in the early nineties, was
on police duty at Murrayfield and I saw him deep in the bowels of the stadium
in the players' tunnel.
We exchanged greetings. ``I tell you what,'' said Alex. ``If the team plays
like that at Murrayfield for the Five Nations' then at least we have something
to look forward to . . . the Tina Turner concert.'' Ouch.
Sick joke
THESE North and Midlands boys are tough. No wonder they beat the Samoans. After
the game Martin Waite was sick over Brian Ireland, and the lads stole Rowen
Shepherd's rear wipers and let down the tyres of his car. Not a sheep in sight,
honest.
Just joking
I AM intrigued at the lengths many of our clubs are going to in order to
entertain precious spectators by making match programmes that little bit
different.
Allan Glen's have a picture of Mike Gibson, the famous Irish centre of the
seventies, on their cover. A dangerous liaison surely.
Pride of place in the Diary's collection goes to an offering from referee Eddie
Crozier, who sent along the Whitecraigs match programme. Under the proud
legend, ``Lochaber RFC'' where there should have been a team list, there was,
instead, the following: ``Sorry boys, could not manage to get your names.'' On
the facing page is a racy message of welcome from the club president, who
wishes everyone an enjoyable afternoon's rugby.
Beneath that is a cartoon depicting one player leaving a scene of quite obvious
injury to another. The downtrodden player, lying flat on his back and in great
pain, is seen to be saying: ``An enjoyable day's rugby, you've got to be
f*****g joking.'' No letters are blanked out in the Whitecraigs programme. See
South siders? Any more out there?
Time check
THE Diary understands that the Western Samoan manager let slip at the
post-match dinner on Saturday that Bill Hogg, the SRU chief executive, has very
little grasp of time. When rumours of Western Samoa cancelling their tour were
rife, Hogg phoned the Southern Hemisphere to check, but at two o'clock our
time. Which raised our friend from the middle of his slumbers. Sounds likely to
me.

BLACKBURN'S Champions' League nightmare reached humiliation level in the
Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. The three goals conceded to Group B leaders Spartak
were the least of the Ewood Park side's problems.
They suffered the indignity of having captain Colin Hendry sent off for a
professional foul on Andre Tikhonov. However, even that was over-shadowed by
the astonishing incident when Graeme le Saux, David Batty, and Tim Sherwood
were involved in what appeared like an exchange of blows at each other.
Batty and Le Saux went for the same ball and collided with each other as it ran
into touch. Their reaction astonished all present. Batty and Le Saux traded
insults, moving on to pushing and shoving, and then the full back appeared to
throw a left hook into Batty's throat.
Keeper Sherwood came racing in to separate them, but could only thrust his
forearm towards Le Saux as the defender appeared to be winding up for another
blow. Hendry and Henning Berg then intervened, managing to pull the players
apart as manager Ray Harford rushed from his dugout across the ice-bound
running track, gesticulating furiously.
Even when well apart Le Saux and Batty continued to shout at each other and the
fractious nature of the Blackburn dressing room was also indicated 23 minutes
later when Hendry and Sherwood squared up to each other after the captain had
lost possession and then committed a foul 25 yards out.
The Batty-Le Saux affair summed up Rovers night in their attempt to lift
Europe's main prize but if the lessons needed to be made clearer they were in
the shape of the goals from Alenitchev, Nikiforov, and Mamedov.
The Russians opened the scoring after 28 minutes through Alenitchev, and just
after the interval it was 2-0 when Nikiforov picked up the ball on the halfway
line and galloped down the right before laying off to Alenitchev and sprinting
for the return before drilling the ball home.
Seven minutes later is was three, a goal of remarkably similar construction to
the second, this time scored by Mamedov.
Then 14 minutes from time the humiliation was completed when Hendry received
his marching orders.
Valeri Ketchinov played the ball forward, Tikhonov got goal-side of the
Scottish defender and when Hendry brought him crashing down on the edge of the
box, Italian referee Pierre Luigi Pairetto had no hesitation in showing him the
red card.

TUMBLING softwood prices knocked profits of timber importer and builders'
merchant Meyer International back 27% to #20.1m for the six months to September.
The group does not expect its second half to be as bad, helped by its recent
purchase of branches from Wickes which made the group one of the largest
builders' merchants in Scotland. But full-year profits are still seen falling
below 1994-95's #51.6m. The interim dividend is pegged at 4.2p.
Meyer paid #2m for 21 Builders' Mate branches from Wickes when the latter
decided to pull out of this business. Ten are in Scotland, doubling the number
of Meyer outlets here. The whole chain is being revamped to improve
performance. The group has 210 outlets and is keen to add another 100.
Not much improvement in market conditions is seen for another year yet, though
demand should stabilise earlier. Despite a volume decline of 7%, Jewson held
trading profits at #13.6m in the first half.
The timber importing business saw profits tumble 41% to #5.7m and the similar
Dutch operation was down 43% at #4.4m. There was a glut of timber on the market
as a result of the cyclical upsurge in pulp prices which encouraged a higher
timber cut.

BOXING
PAUL `Silky' Jones climbed up from a first-round knock-down to claim the World
Boxing Organisation light-middleweight title in Sheffield last night.
Jones beat the holder from New York, Verno Phillips, on a split decision to
complete a tremendous boxing comeback.
British judge Roy Francis made him a clear winner by 116 points to 111, while
the Puerto Rican officials, Nelson Vusquez and Cesar Ramos, had it 113-113 and
114-113 - and that after the challenger had a point deducted for a head-butt in
the ninth round.
Jones pulled away from Phillips in the last four rounds as the champion visibly
tired. His early work often lacked conviction, but there was little doubting he
was the master overall.
He constantly switched from an orthodox stance to southpaw to confuse Phillips
- and overall the tactic paid off.
q STEVE Collins, who puts his WBO super-middleweight title on the line against
Cornelius Carr in Dublin on Saturday, last night refused point-blank to defend
against Ray Close.
Close drew then lost against former champion Chris Eubank, but was denied a
third clash when he failed a brain scan.
He went on to pass subsequent examinations in Ireland and America, but Collins
is not convinced. ``I'm not prepared to accept responsibility for Ray's
health,'' said Collins.
``Ray is a friend of mine and I have no intention of doing anything that might
jeopardise his health.''
q MIKE Tyson's postponed clash with Buster Mathis Jr will take place in
Atlantic City on December 16. The fight was scheduled for November 4, but was
postponed when Tyson damaged his right thumb.

BEHIND the statement from Forte that shareholders should take no action because
the offer totally fails to recognise the group's value, perhaps there is a
secret feeling of relief from Sir Rocco. Certainly he will have to battle very
hard to persuade a sceptical City that the hotels and catering group should
remain independent.
Broker reaction was initially one of surprise but the later view was that Forte
had been asking for it - admittedly sentiment has been swayed by the cogency of
the Granada arguments on hotel branding. There Forte appears to have simply too
many names on the roadside and has positioned Travelodge too closely to Post
House.
Moreover, Whitbread is moving up fast to take market leadership with its Travel
Inns. But these are arguments that will be rehearsed time and time again over
the next several weeks including the unassailable fact that the Forte purchase
of the Meridien chain of luxury hotels is the best thing it has done for many a
year.
Granada said it will raise #500m through the disposal of peripheral assets such
as Lillywhites, Alpha Airports, and the Savoy. That will bring great
unhappiness to the Forte family given that so much blood, sweat and tears have
been shed in acquiring the 68% equity holding over the years.
But there are several honeypots of surplus hotel assets, particularly in London
where the value of properties like the Grosvenor House on Park Lane run into
many hundreds of millions of pounds.
These could be sold and leased back to create an immediate substantial cash sum
and provide a valuable tool in reducing the apparently horrendous gearing of
130% postulated for September next year after the assumption of Forte's #1300m
debt.
As far as the City is concerned, Gerry Robinson seems to walk on water but he
cannot afford to make a slip. However, while this offer may be an initial one,
it will not have to be increased that much to ensure success.
Better way
THE Chancellor of the Exchequer is thought to have enough scope to cut the
basic rate of income tax by 1p to 24p in Tuesday's Budget. Kenneth Clarke
himself fuelled the speculation yesterday by reiterating the Government's
long-term aim of reducing basic rate tax to 20p.
On its Budget race card, chartered accountancy firm Coopers and Lybrand quotes
a 1p reduction in the basic rate as the 1/2 favourite. According to
stockbrokers at UBS, the cost would be #1600m next year and #2000m in 1997-8.
Another route to a 20p basic tax rate would be to increase the band covered by
the 20p lower rate, which currently applies to the first #3200 of taxable
income. Raising this by #2000 to #5200 would cost in the region of #2000m.
So far Mr Clarke has not displayed the same enthusiasm for the lower rate band
as his predecessor Norman Lamont who introduced it in 1992.
A James Capel poll of 1035 individuals who voted Conservative at the last
election shows that only 13% favoured cutting the basic rate, against 19% who
would prefer increases in personal allowances and 37% who supported a reduction
in the 17.5% VAT rate.
The bulk of the extra tax raised from the personal sector in the last three
years has been achieved by not indexing tax allowances against inflation and by
reducing the value of the married couples allowance and mortgage interest
relief.
To those on lower incomes the point at which they start to pay tax is of much
greater significance than the rate at which it is levied. The same is also true
of the Conservative Party's natural constituency among the better off middle
income groups.
It is estimated that since 1989 the number of higher rate taxpayers has
increased by 700,000 to 2,200,000. The higher rate threshold was frozen in the
three years to 1994-5.
For a cost of #2650m the Chancellor could increase all personal and married
couples allowances, the lower rate band, and the higher rate threshold by 10%
above the rate of inflation.
Indexation of allowances and thresholds at September's 3.9% inflation rate is
due. So the overall effect would be to increase the personal allowance by #490
to #4015, the lower rate band by #445 to #3645, and the higher rate threshold
by #3375 to #27,675.
Such a use of the money Mr Clarke has at his disposal would be much more
equitable than a token cut in the basic rate. It might also turn out to be
politically astute.
Cadbury II
A SUCCESSOR body to the Cadbury Committee on Corporate Governance has at last
been formed and fortunately a heavyweight chairman has been found in Sir Ronnie
Hampel, chairman of ICI. He will be supported by other leading business figures
like Sir David Simon of BP and Chris Haskins of Northern Foods.
There had appeared to be some reluctance on the part of top businessmen to take
part in Cadbury II, as it will be known, and it was important that it contained
top business people to have full credibility.
The row in the summer over executive share options involving Sir Richard
Greenbury is thought to have put people off.
Business grudgingly went along with the Cadbury proposals but has baulked at
some of the Greenbury decisions, such as much greater disclosure of
remuneration and performance criteria. However, if public cynicism about big
business is to be checked it is vital that the proposals are implemented and
the Cadbury II members should have the clout to attack any backsliding.

AC MILAN coach Fabio Capello is thinking of switching clubs next year after
five seasons that made the Italian side the leading lights in Europe.
Capello claims that he has been offered a two-year extension by Milan, the
Serie A leaders, but was unhappy with certain clauses. He said he had until
April 30 to make up his mind.
``By then it will be too late to choose,'' he said. ``I could find a club
before then and not accept the offer from Milan of a contract without (those)
clauses.'' He would not elaborate on the contract tussle.
Capello was talking as speculation mounted that the club was hunting for a
replacement and had several candidates in mind, including Italy manager Arrigo
Sacchi, who moved to the national side from Milan.
Capello dismissed the speculation but added that he felt Milan had not backed
him fully this season. And he said he felt he should have quit after Milan
overwhelmed Barcelona 4-0 in the European Champions' Cup final in Athens in
May, 1994.
``It was really a magic moment. We'd reached the top, so high you couldn't go
higher. Yes, that was perhaps the right moment. There was no lack of offers,''
he said.
q COLOMBIAN defender Albeiro Pico Hernandez, of Club Envigado, was shot dead by
unidentified gumen yesterday in the northwest city of Medellin.
The gunmen is said to have shot seven rounds into 23-year-old Pico as he was
leaving his home for an early-morning training session.
The player had been playing with Club Envigado since 1988. Police said they had
no immediate clues as to the reasons for the killing of the footballer or who
might be behind it.
Medellin has Colombia's highest murder rate. Defender Andres Escobar was gunned
down in the city in 1994, not long after having scored an own goal in a World
Cup finals match against the USA that Colombia lost 2-1.

Washington, Wednesday - The Federal Communications Commission today unanimously
approved Westinghouse Electric Corporation's $5400m acquisition of CBS,
enabling the deal to go through.
The transaction, approved in a 5-0 vote, had been delayed by the federal
Government shutdown and by an internal squabble among the agency's
commissioners over Westinghouse's pledge to air three hours a week of
educational television for children.
FCC chairman Reed Hundt wanted to link the commission's approval of the
acquisition to Westinghouse's pledge. But three other commissioners rejected
such an approach.
In the end, the commission acknowledged Westinghouse's pledge on children's
television but said approval of the deal was not conditioned on implementing
the plan. Each day of delay has added $850,000 to the price tag Westinghouse
must pay for CBS, under terms of the buyout agreement. - Reuter

CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE
ROUND-UP
ROSENBORG gave their chances of reaching the quarter-final stage a considerable
boost when they defeated Legia Warsaw 4-0 in Trondheim to move to within one
point of the Poles in Group B.
Roar Strand opened the scoring after 17 minutes and just before half-time,
Harald Brattbakk added the second. Then Jahn Ivar Jakobsen put Rosenborg three
up before Vegard Heggem completed the scoring in the last minute. Now Rosenborg
have a great chance of joining Spartak in the next round.
In Spain, a goal from Jari Litmanen after 20 minutes gave Ajax the lead against
Real Madrid in Group D. The Dutch side, many people's choice as favourites to
take the European title, added a second through Patrick Kluivert after 75
minutes, and this victory means that they cannot be caught at the top of the
section.
Bobby Robson's Porto really needed a victory against Nantes to put real
pressure on the French champions in Group A. And the night did not start too
well for the Portuguese side when Reynald Pedros opened the scoring after just
three minutes for Nantes. However, the lead did not last too long for Ljubimko
Drulovic equalised for Porto after 11 minutes.
Halfway through the half, Nantes regained the advantage when Pedros scored his
second but Porto's Jose Carlos equalised after 56 minutes to earn his side a
point.
In the same group, Alexis Alexoudis scored in the first minute to give
Panathinaikos the lead over Denmark's Aalborg in Athens, a second goal coming
after 38 minutes through George Georgiadis, and that is how the tie finished.

CHAMPION'S LEAGUE
ROUND-UP
GREEK champions Panathinaikos clinched their place in the last eight with a 2-0
win over Aalborg, with goals from Alexis Alexoudis and George Georgiadis,
joining Spartak Moscow, Juventus, Ajax, and Dortmund in the quarter-final stage.
With only one round of the six Champions' League matches to play, Panathinaikos
cannot be caught in Group A, with either Nantes or Porto, who drew 2-2 in
Portugal last night, now joining them.
Nantes play Panathinaikos in their last match on December 6, while Aalborg host
Porto.
``It is a great night for Greek football,'' Panathinaikos' Argentine coach Juan
Ramon Rocha said. ``We now have our last match in France and we will try to
keep the first spot in the group.''
Panathinaikos are the only Greek club to reach the European Cup final,
achieving the feat in 1971 when they played Ajax in London, losing 2-0 at
Wembley.
Last night Porto wasted their best chance when striker Domingos Oliveira missed
a penalty in 75 minutes. ``The game was there to be won,'' said Porto manager
Bobby Robson. ``It was a wonderful opportunity for us,'' referring to the
penalty. ``But I never criticise players who miss penalties.''
Nantes keeper Casagrande guaranteed the draw when he made a spectacular save
from a shot by Hungarian midfielder Peter Lipcsei in injury time.
In Group B, Spartak Moscow were through even before outclassing Blackburn
Rovers and they will be joined by either Rosenborg, who thumped Legia Warsaw
4-0 in Norway, or the Polish champions.
Legia face Spartak in their last match with Blackburn at home to Rosenborg. If
Rosenborg draw with Blackburn and Spartak beat Legia, the Norwegians will
qualify - despite having lost three of their matches to date.
Defending champions Ajax's 2-0 win over Real Madrid in Spain and Ferencvaros's
3-3 draw with Grasshoppers Zurich in Budapest means either Real or Ferencvaros
will join Ajax in the last eight from Group D.
Ajax, who meet Brazil's Gremio in the Intercontinental Cup in Tokyo on Tuesday,
could have settled the issue in the first 20 minutes when their fast-flowing,
one-touch football left Real floundering.
Marc Overmars, Jari Litmanen, and Patrick Kluivert all had well-struck shots
come crashing back off the crossbar, while Kluivert hit a weak shot straight at
Buyo.
However, Ajax won the match with goals from the Finn, Jari Litmanen, and
Patrick Kluivert, anbd their last game is against Ferencvaros, while Real
travel to Zurich.

FALLING raw material prices should benefit chemicals group Courtaulds but they
came too late for the interim results which showed a 16% decline in profits to
#68m before tax.
However, the trading performance was not as bad as some industry watchers had
expected and with the company still optimistic about its long-term prospects
the shares jumped 39p to 399p.
The problem areas were the acrylic and viscose fibre businesses. Profits in
fibres and chemicals were down 38% on the previous year, although sales grew by
12%.
It proved difficult to pass on higher costs to customers. What higher selling
prices there were had an adverse effect on demand. The UK market was notably
difficult.
Courtaulds said quarterly contracts prevented it from taking immediate
advantage of sharply-falling acrylonitrile prices, which had soared since the
summer of 1994.
It will not feel the benefit of these lower prices until next spring. However,
there are encouraging signs that other raw material prices may also be on the
way down.
The company said that pulp prices had peaked although they have yet to fall.
However, it emphasised that lower raw material prices do not necessarily feed
through into higher profits because customers postpone orders until they feel
that prices have reached the bottom.
Some parts of the fibre business did well with Tencel sales volumes moving
ahead strongly. A second manufacturing plant is due to open shortly to meet
increased demand. There was also a positive performance in the rest of the
group with profits from Coatings &amp; Sealants up 14% and those in Polymer
Products jumped 33%.
Coatings sales volumes in the Far East rose by more than 15% and the
profitability of the European operations benefited from earlier
rationalisation.

THEY said it couldn't be done. They said no-one would dare. But they had
reckoned without Her Majesty's Government. At last: the privatisation of John
Selwyn Gummer.
Or so we must believe, given an invitation from the press section of the
British Embassy in Brussels, no less, informing the recipient that he would
shortly receive notification of a Royal Institute of International Relations
lunch at the local Hilton.
There our Environment Minister (or ``drittsek'' to give him the title EU
protocol demands) would deliver a speech on, of all things, environmental
policy, followed by a press conference on same.
Given the laws of supply and demand, the conference would of course be free. As
for the lunch, however, only a bank transfer of 1500 Belgian francs ``will
secure your place''.
Or to put it in layman's terms: one absolutely unforgettable John Gummer speech
delivered as part of the ministerial duties for which we pay him well? That
will be #34, please.
Half-cocked Robin
``SEND your Christmas post off to a great start,'' says the advertising copy,
``with Royal Mail's new festive stamps featuring Britain's best-loved bird -
the robin - a traditional symbol of the season.'' It adds: ``So why not post
your Christmas cards early and allow your family and friends to enjoy them
longer?''
Why not indeed? Presentation packs of these lovely stamps are available,
apparently, from the British Philatelic Bureau, 20 Brandon Street, Edinburgh -
where 600 post boxes have just been sealed because of a strike by distinctly
unfestive postmen.
Breeding violence
NOT WEIRD, just American. Last month 21-year-old Jeremy Brown was arrested in
Dover, New Hampshire, for beating up his girlfriend in a dispute over whether
the O J Simpson jury had reached the proper verdict.
Fast mover
A SPLENDID example of consensus politics is being set in the Borders, where
Councillor Jim Nairn, elected as an independent to represent Gordon and
Greenlaw, has just switched to the Liberal Democrats.
Two years ago Mr Nairn defected from the Tories after being elected to
Berwickshire District Council as a Conservative candidate. Last year he won the
West Berwickshire seat on Borders Regional Council as an independent, and this
year was elected to the new Scottish Borders Council as an indie before
deciding recently that, on the whole, he'd rather be a Lib-Dem.
This is not as surprising as it might sound, since before moving to
Berwickshire and joining the Tories Mr Nairn was (but you guessed) a staunch
Liberal. The local Lib-Dems are, in any case, delighted, stating: ``Jim Nairn
has the potential to be a good Liberal Democrat as he has a lot of experience
which we will take full advantage of.''
Somehow you just bet they will.
Taking stock
THE TORIES have been keeping busy meanwhile, attempting, after only 16 years in
power, to discover what people really think. Thus Ian Lang has sent out no
fewer than 10,000 questionnaires to his constituents in Galloway, at a cost
estimated by his agent at #5000, to ``measure public opinion'' on a variety of
issues.
Funnily enough, Michael Forsyth, with a majority even punier than that of his
Scottish Office predecessor, has also been bombarding voters in Stirling with
forms for the filling in of. There seems to be an awful lot that these vastly
experienced politicians don't know.
Still, all this might be regarded as open government, or an example of local
MPs taking a deep interest in the views and wishes of their constituents, were
it not for the admission by Lang's agent that ``all the information is fed into
computers at Central Office''.
Thus, for the first time, Tory headquarters in London's Smith Square will have
scientific proof of the existence of Scotland.
Name-dropping
IT OCCURS to us, though, that among the questions Galloway voters might ask of
Ian Lang is how anyone can mislay around a million pounds. The trouble is the
MP himself doesn't seem to have an answer.
Thus the president of the Board of Trade, a member ``name'' of the hapless Rose
Thompson Young syndicate (1092 members; #428m down the plug-hole), has joined a
High Court action claiming that Lloyds of London was negligent in its
underwriting procedures.
One small snag: Mr Lang runs the Department of Trade and Industry; the DTI
regulates Lloyds; and the president is suing that institution for big numbers.
Not to worry: earlier this year Lang delegated responsibility for the insurance
market to a junior minister, Anthony Nelson.
That's all right, then. After all, we couldn't have anyone suggesting that
outside commitments were preventing the president from carrying out a fairly
crucial part of his job.
Cudgel thy brains
BULLETIN, Edinburgh University's newsletter, is running a competition for which
the prize is a pair of tickets for any night in the final week of the Royal
Lyceum's production of Hamlet (``by William Shakespeare'', it says here).
It's one of those fill-in-the-missing-word jobs, and a real toughie.
Thus: ``Alas poor Yorick, I knew him . . ?''
Should Edinburgh's esteemed department of English literature fail to win we
will, of course, draw our own conclusions. Next: ``The capital of Scotland is .
. ?''
n AND WHILE we're at it, a little quiz of our own for the arts department of an
Edinburgh morning newspaper. Is ``Fraser Hood'' a) a terribly well-known actor
who will star in the BBC's forthcoming series Bad Boys; or b) just the name of
a character played by said terribly well-known actor whom you interviewed at
length yesterday in the clear belief that he is actually called ``Fraser
Hood''?
Prizes for the real name, when you find it, will be small and deeply
patronising.
Thought for
the week
``HEREDITARY succession is a burlesque upon monarchy. It puts it in the most
ridiculous light, by presenting it as an office which any child or idiot may
fill. It requires some talents to be a common mechanic; but, to be a king,
requires only the animal figure of man - a sort of breathing automaton. This
sort of superstition may last a few years more, but it cannot long resist the
awakened reason and interest of man'' - Thomas Paine, 1792.
Yes, as recently as that.

New York, Wednesday - The Dow Jones industrial average pushed further into
record territory today, one day after closing for the first time above the
5000-point level, as investors bet that an interest-rate cut was on the horizon.
The Dow ended with a gain of 18.06 points at 5041.61, eclipsing the record
close of 5023.55 set yesterday.
In the broader market, advancing issues led declines by a small margin on
active volume of 408 million shares.
The broader market was flat ahead of the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
``There's confidence on the Street that 5000 was a speed bump to higher
numbers,'' said Charlie Crane, a director of research at Spears, Benzak,
Salomon &amp; Farrell. ``People are looking through the current economic
sluggishness.''
US stock markets will be closed tomorrow for the holiday and will shut early on
Friday.
Meanwhile, the Morgan Stanley cyclical index jumped six points, or 1.85% to 343.
``Stocks with a cyclical flavor are having a good day,'' Mr Crane said.
``Investors are envisioning the next Fed easing and looking into 1996 and
seeing a sluggish economy with no sign of inflation on the horizon and
anticipating the next acceleration.''
Christine Callies, a technical analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, said the
``rally was only in the Dow components. It is probably the narrowest rally the
market has had all year.

<HEADLINE>EU expansion could pose difficulties for Scotland</HEADLINE>

THE expansion of the European Union to include the former Communist states of
Eastern and Central Europe could have important implications for the future
plans of many businesses in Scotland.
While there is widespread support in principle within existing EU member states
for expansion, the timing and nature of what will happen is very uncertain.
The countries which have so far made a formal application to join the EU or
have expressed a very serious interest in joining are Bulgaria, Poland,
Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and
Slovenia. In large part the timing of their entry will be determined by their
economic, adminstrative, and political readiness.
Together these countries would add more than 100 million people to the EU (an
increase of around 25%), yet their income per head is currently only 25% to 45%
of the EU average. Their growth rates over the next few years are at best only
likely to be a little above those in Western Europe, so it will take them a
long time to catch up with the west.
Their unemployment levels vary but many have rates above the European average.
Most have at least 10% of their workforce dependent on agriculture - compared
to an EU average of 6% - and some, like Poland with around 30% in agriculture,
have an employment structure that is far from that of the more modern European
economies.
Annual inflation rates vary between 10% in the Czech Republic to more than 130%
in Romania (the average rate in 1994 was 45%).
By comparison, the two poorest members of the EU as it currently stands have a
combined population of 20 million, income per head of around half of the EU
average, below average unemployment, around 20% of their workforce in
argriculture, and inflation averaging 6%.
In 1994, the EU had a trade surplus of #5000m with the countries of Eastern and
Central Europe, with exports of #32bn and imports of #27bn. Trade between the
EU and Eastern and Central Europe grew by around a quarter between 1993 and
1994. Germany was by far the dominant partner with over half the imports and
almost half the exports. UK exports were #1800m (5.5%) against imports of
#1900m (6.8%).
The prospects of countries like the Czech Republic and Slovenia being ready to
join the EU in the relatively near future are much stronger than other
countries in the region. There seems to be little point in delaying the
membership of those that are ready while others try to catch up.
Closer links to the EU and eventual membership are a vital part of any
effective economic development strategy for Central and Eastern European
countries. If their economies don't develop strongly their citizens could
quickly become disillusioned with economic and political reforms; this could
result in a return to less enlightened governments and a much greater degree of
insecurity on the EU's borders.
As well as the security problems posed, such an outcome would also represent a
wasted opportunity to build on the economic potential of these countries, not
least as thriving markets for Western European products and services.
The EU, therefore, has a strong self-interest in supporting the development of
these countries.
As well as the Central and Eastern European countries being ready to join the
EU, the Union also needs to be ready to accept them. One of the hurdles to
expansion, which will be on the agenda of the Inter Governmental Conference of
EU members next year, is reforming the Union's decision-making processes to
handle more members. As well as revamping the decision-making procedure the EU
faces other problems.
The economic condition of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe would
result in all of them being major recipients of the EU budget. According to a
recent report from the Commission, the EU budget would have to rise by 38bn Ecu
a year - an increase of around 50% - to accommodate the new members if there
were no change in current policies.
Despite the political attractions of expansion eastwards to net contributors to
the EU budget like Germany, it is hard to see them being willing to foot such a
bill. So an overhaul of the agricultural and structural policies of the Union
will be needed.
A transition phase where new entrants agree to stay outside the full scope of
some common policies is also almost certainly needed if the current major
beneficiaries of the agricultural and structural funds are not to be scared off
and to veto expansion.
To begin this phasing in process, the most important thing that the EU could do
would be to further open the single market to companies from the East. This
would give a major boost to economic development in the eastern countries and
demonstrate a real commitment to integrating them into the Union. This will
also benefit business in the West, with easier access to a developing market of
100 million people who will require investment goods, consumer goods and
business and personal services.
Problems for poorer regions in the exisiting EU will doubtless result in them
seeking some form of compensation in return for their agreement to open up the
single market. Such compensation would be on top of any rich-to-poor financial
transfers needed to get economic and monetary union off the ground and to keep
it airborne.
This increased compensation to the poorer areas of the Union could create some
problems for areas like Scotland which currently benefit from EU structural
policy but which are nowhere near the foot of the development league table.
They may well be required to make sacrifices to accommodate increased
compensation elsewhere.
For Scotland as a whole, sacrifices in the short term needed to ease the entry
of East and Central Europe into the EU should be an investment that will pay
off handsomely in the future.
However, individual firms, industries and areas will need to consider carefully
what the threats and opportunities for them will be. The timing and terms of
any expansion will be critical to determining the implications and planning an
appropriate response.

A FRESH row over ``fat cats'' pay erupted yesterday as it emerged that the new
managing director of the National Grid would receive a #460,000 package on top
of seven-figure earnings for the year.
The deal brought an immediate call from the Labour Party for a last-minute
postponement to the flotation of the Grid next week.
Figures published yesterday in the prospectus for the new GridCo company show
that  Roger Urwin, former chief executive of London Electricity, would receive
pay and perks worth #253,000 and shares worth #207,000.
He is already estimated to have earned #152,000 in the six months from April at
London Electricity and stands to make a total of more than #1m from a variety
of share deals and options.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown dubbed the package ``the biggest privatisation
scandal so far'' and accused the Government of riding roughshod over the
proposals of the Greenbury Committee on executive pay.
The prospectus also revealed that Mr Urwin was being hired on a fixed two-year
contract despite recommendations that top executives should be employed on
rolling renewable contracts designed to reflect performance.

immediate horizon, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Thanks to the #137m rights issue in June, the company has a cash balance of
#38m as well as a reputation as a shrewd purchaser.
In the six months to September, pre-tax profits rose 26.7% to #39.4m on
turnover 5.3% higher at #429m to leave group margins improved from 9% to 10.4%.
The interim dividend has been raised 10% to 2.2p.

UK share prices hit a record high, boosted by Granada's mega-bid for Forte and
fresh gains on Wall Street.
``The rally is not over yet. Wall Street looks like it will go a lot higher,''
one senior dealer said as the Dow Jones Industrial Average cruised higher after
breaking the 5000 barrier on Tuesday.
``But with Thanksgiving tomorrow, we may have to wait until next week before we
see any new highs,'' he added.
In London, the FTSE-100 index of leading shares climbed 28.3 points to an
all-time closing high of 3632.4, beating the record of 3628.8 set on Monday.
Today's Thanksgiving holiday in the United States is likely to cool the
temperature on Wall Street until next week, dampening upward pressure on UK
shares as well.
Second line shares again lagged behind blue chips. The FTSE Mid-250 index
closed up only 8.1 points at 3949.3.
Bonds made modest gains in quiet trade, boosted by German bunds and the pound's
recovery on the foreign exchanges. The December long-gilt future closed up
17/32 at 108-27/32.
Granada's #3400m hostile takeover bid for the Forte hotels and leisure group
stunned the City which had been expecting an offer for either Ladbroke, the
hotel, casino and betting shop empire, or the Pearson media organisation.
Forte raced ahead 72!sp to 347!sp, while Pearson, which owns the Financial
Times and Thames Television, dipped 11p to 648p.
Granada has announced plans to raise #500m from selling off several branches of
the Forte group to avoid a clash with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,
dropped 48p to 649p.
These include Forte's motorway service stations and its 68% in the Savoy hotel
group. Savoy shares rocketed 142p to 1025p.
Stakis, the Glasgow-based hotel and casino operator, rose 2p to 85p amid the
euphoria.
Cable &amp; Wireless jumped 37p to 466p after chairman Lord Young and chief
executive James Ross announced they were quitting to resolve a personality
clash in the boardroom. The announcement on Tuesday evening came after the
stock market had closed but prompted renewed takeover speculation yesterday.
Courtaulds was another strong performer. The textiles and chemicals group
gained 39p to 399p after saying that steep increases in the price of raw
materials had peaked.
Vodafone was a major faller, shedding 23p to 21p, after heavy selling overnight
in the US in the light of Tuesday's disappointing results.
After the recent excitement of the electricity sector, it was the turn of water
stocks to enjoy strong rises in the expectation of merger moves. North West
Water gained 15p to 605p, while Thames Water firmed 10p to 570p.
Thorn EMI bounded ahead 20p to 1543p in the afterglow of Tuesday's stunning
results.

Final 1994-95 1993-94

Pre-tax profit #351m #265m
EPS 39.1p 32.0p
Dividend 11.75p 10.0p
CORONATION Street to roadside restaurants giant Granada yesterday took the City
by surprise with a #3400m takeover bid for the Forte hotels and catering group.
The hostile offer was immediately rejected by chairman Sir Rocco Forte who said
it was strategically flawed and totally failed to recognise the group's value.
Granada is offering a mixture of four new shares and #23.25 in cash for every
15 Forte shares.
Granada shares tumbled 48p to 649p yesterday so the offer values Forte at 328p
compared to last night's closing price of 347!sp, up 72!sp, on turnover of more
than 47 million shares. The price movement indicates there could be more to go
for through either a counter-offer or an improvement in the Granada terms.
Granada chief executive Gerry Robinson, who will become chairman in succession
to Alex Bernstein next year, said he had been planning the takeover move for
the past three years.
The Forte brands include the Happy Eater and Little Chef restaurants which Mr
Robinson claimed were becoming ``tired''. He said Granada had the highest
margins in the industry and suggested the profitability of the Forte outlets
could be improved by introducing Burger Kings which now account for 40% of the
Granada turnover in this sector.
A Forte failing had been the confusion of hotel branding, he added, with Post
Houses and Travelodges coming too close together. The misfits would be sold as
would the peripheral interests such as the 68% holding in the Savoy, the
Lillywhites sports shop and the quarter stake in Alpha Airports catering, he
said. Together these should raise about #500m.
The Meridien hotels which Forte acquired last year from Air France would be
further developed as an international brand, while the existing Forte Grand
hotels would be incorporated into the chain. These include the George V in
Paris and the Ritz in Madrid as well as the Waldorf in Warsaw.
Mr Robinson is credited with turning Granada round since he moved to the
company from the Compass catering group in 1991 as successor to Derek Lewis,
who went on to run the prisons in England and Wales until earlier this year.
Mr Robinson had tried to contact Sir Rocco first thing yesterday morning but
apparently he was on a shooting holiday.
One possible threat is that, while the Forte family including Sir Rocco's
sister Olga Polizzi own about 8% of the shares, effective voting control is
vested in the Council of Forte.
That is an historic remnant of the merger with Trust Houses in 1970 when the
temperance hotels company, founded in 1904, had its identity assured by a board
of independent trustees. It is chaired by Hugh Astor and its members include
former Labour Prime Minister Lord Callaghan.
The council owns just 780,000 Forte shares but has 50% of the votes. In 1971
Allied Breweries bid for the then Trust House Forte and the council stood aside
under a Takeover Panel dispensation, again renewed, to allow shareholders to
decide for themselves. The offer was dropped.
In the past five years, Forte profits have disappointed, falling from #176m in
1991 to a low of #49m, which resulted in a reduced dividend, and recovering to
#127m last year.
In contrast, Granada has shown a sharp improvement, albeit from a very
depressed base, with it too having to cut its dividend and requiring a rights
issue in 1991. The profits for the year to September have shown substantial
growth with the pre-tax total rising to #351m.
The impetus for this came mostly from television with strong underlying growth
and a full-year contribution from LWT as well as from the 10.8% stake in BSkyB
which is now worth almost #700m.
There was also a good performance in road services including Pavillion Lodges
as well as from the rental and computer services operations. The dividend total
has been raised 17.5% to 11.75p with a 7.9p final.

The evidence against Rosemary West was at best flimsy, argues James Freeman who
points out the trial would almost certainly not have gone ahead North of the
Border. What questions does this raise for Scottish and English justice?
DESPITE one of the most exhaustive police investigations mounted, no one ever
found a shred of concrete evidence against Robert Black.
No fingerprint, no bloodstain, no damning fibre, no witness placing Black with
one of the young girl victims was ever traced. Black was convicted nonetheless.
It would be hard to find one soul, particularly among those who listened
throughout to the case, who would disagree with the Newcastle jury's verdict.
Similarly with Rosemary West. Not one witness placed her beyond reasonable
doubt in the presence of any of the hapless girls who died in the most
appalling circumstances imaginable in the Cromwell Street cellar, and neither
did any vital shred of forensic evidence. Yet she was convicted.
Both were convicted, legitimately, in English Crown Courts under the English
doctrine of evidence of similar facts and the harsh reality is that, while no
one seriously questions their guilt, the chances of either being prosecuted in
Scotland would have been so small as to be non-existent.
They would literally have walked away Scot free, out of legal reach because of
the Scottish requirement for corroboration and the basic requirement of
fairness.
From the first moment that both Black and West appeared before the jury the
atmosphere was poisoned. In both cases the Crown began by introducing their
previous criminal convictions, rehearsing the gory details in technicolour,
lingering over the brutality and the horror. In both cases the Crown then went
on to say, essentially, that, although we have no real evidence against them,
because they had behaved like this in the past they are guilty of multiple
murder.
In the trial of Rosemary West, the evidence of Caroline Owens, who was raped
and sexually abused after being given a lift by Fred and Rosemary West and of
Miss A, who was lured into a trap of sexual assault by the couple, was
considered in advance of the trial to be strong enough to help prove that the
couple operated two definite systems for finding victims.
It was also used to rebut Rosemary West's defence that she knew nothing of the
killings, which she blamed on her husband.
On the other hand, the use of this technique allowed two monsters who were
patently guilty to be locked away forever and the public thereby protected.
This begs the question of whether evidence of similar facts could usefully be
adopted in Scotland.
Most lawyers here appear to be against it, but then most have been bitterly
opposed to the small changes - designed to move back towards the centre a
pendulum perceived by many to have swung too far in favour of the accused -
which have recently been made. These include modest measures such as the
removal of the right to challenge jurors' selection, the removal of the right
to know jurors' occupations, and the Crown's right to remark on accused's
refusal to answer questioning.
In Scots law there exists the Moorov Doctrine, little known to the public at
large, and Professor Fraser Davidson at Glasgow University Law School says that
in England similar facts is being used in a very similar way. Under Moorov if
the Crown has only one piece of evidence in relation to a particular crime, but
there is a causal connection between that and other actions of the accused,
evidence of these individual acts may be used to corroborate each other.
In England the idea is close to that, but without the need for corroboration.
If someone is charged with a number of offences similarities in the evidence
can be drawn out to persuade the jury that it is not coincidence.
Evidence of similarity can be drawn from cases not actually being prosecuted
against an accused at that particulare time - an anathema here.
Profesor Davidson says that while the Moorov Doctrine goes along with the idea
some of the way, the English have ``a very elastic concept of what similar
facts are''.
He adds: ``It really is no more than saying that this person is the kind of man
who would abduct a child, and if that is really all you are saying then it is a
doctrine of giving a dog a bad name and condemning him. That is why the law has
to walk a tightrope. You cannot just convict people because of their general
character.
``They have to find some very striking similarity linking a number of cases and
while I can see the attractions of using similar facts the law is walking a
tightrope.''
It has got to the stage in England, Professor Davidson believes, where they are
using the doctrine to say ``this is the kind of person who might commit such
offences therefore he did commit them. In the West case the Crown was basically
saying she was sexually depraved therefore nothing would be beyond her.''
It is difficult, Professor Davidson says, when looking at something like the
Black case to argue that the English have got the balance wrong, yet he still
believes it is a shaky basis on which to prosecute.
``The English,'' he says, `` go too far, saying that the slightest evidence of
similarity allows you to bring in character evidence under the heading of
similar facts.''
Cameron Fyfe, the Glasgow lawyer, takes a cautious but more positive view,
however.
Involving, as it does, the disclosure at the outset of an accused's previous
criminal record, it requires a very delicate balance. He comes down in favour
of disclosure of convictions, which, he says, need not always be prejudicial,
in circumstances where the balance clearly lies with an overwhelming public
interest.
Defence lawyers, including himself, have no hesitation in using evidence of a
man's good character when he has a blameless past to persuade a jury. Why, in
all fairness, cannot the Crown do that in reverse, he asks?
Mr Fyfe points to the Robert Black case, where, as he was led below, Black
turned to the detectives a yard behind him and said:``Well done,lads'' - taken
by most to be an admission the police had got the right man. If that is correct
then the similar facts doctrine worked well in the public interest.
Cameron Fyfe believes that it can never be cut and dried, that there is always
a risk of prejudice when an accused's past character is introduced. But that
could be balanced by a warning to the jury from the Bench, or by defence
counsel in the closing speech.
He admits to the weakness of the principle, put memorably by one counsel when
he said that introducing past character was like bringing a skunk into the
courtroom, taking it away and then expecting the jury to ignore the smell.
``With some misgivings, I would say that in certain cases with a major public
interest I would be in favour of the use of similar facts here, but is always
going to be a close call,'' he says.
Other lawyers, however, reject similar facts as a dangerous road to take. David
Pirrit, of Ross Harper and Murphy in Hamilton, a member of the Law Society of
Scotland's criminal law committee, says that in Scotland the Crown would never
get a conviction on the basis of association but that the accused has to be art
and part.
While rejecting complacency about the law here, he says: ``You may live in a
house with a man who has murdered people and buried bodies in the house. There
may have been knowledge that there was something untoward, or something you
ought to have found untoward, but that does not make you guilty of murder.
``I have misgivings about the West case, that someone could be convicted
because she was married to a maniac. She has confessed to nothing. I would not
like similar facts to be enough - you would have to have some direct evidence.''
Kenneth Pritchard, secretary of the Law Society of Scotland, declares: ``The
law here is that previous convictions are not disclosed until the accused is
convicted of these charges on which he is being tried at that precise moment.
Similar facts simply amount to bringing in evidence of previous convictions
early on.
``There is no good reason advanced, only emotion, to suggest the law here
should be changed. A vast amount of emotion surfaces around cases such as Black
and West with a strong public feeling that they must be convicted at all costs
and if you can use evidence of previous convictions then you should do so.
``I would not like to see it in our law because it would be sure to prejudice
the minds of juries. Emotional cases do not justify changing the law by
shooting from the hip.''
But would it not have been monstrous had Black, or Rosemary West, walked away
Scot free for lack of direct evidence, probably missing because of the passage
of time?
Mr Pritchard: ``We have to live with this. The problem is that you are so
anxious to get someone convicted that you lose sight of what could happen in
thousands of other cases coming along thereafter. By introducing what an
accused has done in the past it of course ignores the fact that he or she may
have in the interim changed their ways and that is deeply unfair.''

HOW many more bodies litter the trail of Frederick and Rosemary West, and where
do they lie?
That now is the question uppermost in the minds of the authorities concerned
with the investigation, although direct interrogation of West will have to wait
until after her appeal.
It is that questioning which will hold the key to any future discoveries.
Yesterday, Gloucestershire's chief constable, Mr Tony Butler, said his force
would be ``reviewing potential areas for further investigation'', and whether
or not Strathclyde Police becomes involved will depend on Mr Butler.
There are many precedents. Following the conviction of Robert Black, the most
recent serial killer prior to West, and the rejection of his appeal, police
forces in whose areas girls went missing in strikingly similar circumstances to
Black's known victims, sought to question him further.
Black has never cracked, but Rosemary West may not be so strong.
Strathclyde Police yesterday reiterated that, at the moment, it has no direct
interest in the case, but that might change in the light of the further
interrogation of Rosemary West.
Should she choose to confirm what many people already believe - that there are
further bodies - then any search in Glasgow would have to concentrate at the
site of Frederick West's former allotment in Gower Street, Kinning Park.
According to witness John McLachlan, who took The Herald to the spot, the
allotment has been largely built over, although portions may remain in the form
of back gardens.
Mr McLachlan has repeatedly said that West often spent many hours at the
allotment by himself, sometimes until the early hours of the morning, and that
he may have been using a hut there to meet girlfriends.
Police have never closed their file on teenage waitress Mary Bastholm, who
vanished from a bus stop in Gloucester in 1968, and became a key figure in the
trial of Rosemary West nearly 30 years later.
Mary, 15, was last seen alive on a Saturday evening in January, 1968, while
waiting at a bus stop outside the city's Avenue Hotel.
But police believe that instead of taking the bus to the home of boyfriend Tim
Merrett at Hardwicke, five miles away, she might have accepted a lift because
it was raining.
Officers mounted a huge search for her, and inquiries were made throughout the
country, but the trail went cold until Frederick West admitted she was dead.
Voluntary worker Janet Leach told Rosemary West's trial that Fred West had
admitted to her that Mary Bastholm was dead, and that her remains were ``in a
farm''.
West also told her during their confidential conversations that he knew Mary,
and had picked her up, Mrs Leach said.
Mary's brother Peter, 50, who still lives in Gloucester, but was serving with
the Royal Navy, in Singapore, at the time she disappeared, said he now believes
she was one of West's victims.
Police yesterday appealed for information on the whereabouts of nine women who
visited the Wests and have since disappeared.
The women were aged between 13 and their late 30s when they were known to have
been at the Wests' Cromwell Street home.
However, in a statement released after the verdicts in the trial, detectives
said there was as yet no evidence that the missing women were victims of the
Wests.
Missing are:
q Marilyn, a white woman in her late 30s in 1973, and thought to have been a
devout Christian.
q Donna Lynn Moore (or similar), described in 1973 as white, aged 13 or 14,
slim and pretty, and who spoke with an American accent, and may have been the
daughter of a US serviceman from an East Anglian airbase.
q Name not known, but police issued a photograph of the woman which is thought
to have been taken when she visited in 1975. It shows a full-faced brunette
with rosy lips.
q Maria Ann, a white woman in her early 20s in 1991. She had long, blonde hair
and may have been a student.
q Mireeker or Marieka (or similar), a white woman in her late 20s in 1977/78,
who may have come from Holland.
q Name not known, a white woman aged between 18 and 20 in 1978.
q May have been called Ingrid, a white woman aged around 18 in 1978/79, who
possibly spoke with a German accent.
q Marilyn, aged 18 or 19 with long, blonde hair in 1973.
q Name unknown, a white woman aged 17 to 20 in 1973, with blonde hair and who
spoke with a Swedish or Dutch accent.

PAUL Gascoigne offered the fleeting possibility of glory, but Rangers were
disabused of any grand and ultimately ridiculous notions by an efficient team
from Romania, and also by events which unfolded eslewhere in the footballing
world.
Even before the crowd had deserted Ibrox last night, it was clear Rangers'
Champions' League campaign was over so far as qualification to the final stages
was concerned.
Walter Smith's side had to win on their own turf, and also hope that the
Italian champions and comfortable leaders of Group C, Juventus, would beat
Borussia Dortmund for a second time.
But success could not be secured on either front.
Rangers' draw with Steaua has left them at the bottom of their section with
only two points after five matches, and they will be travelling to Dortmund in
a fortnight with only the desire to restore some credibility.
The Germans, on the other hand, know they have secured second place. To keep
their pride absolutely intact, they will want to beat Rangers.
If they can go to Turin and beat Juventus 2-1, as they did last night, then
they must be favourites to win at home against Rangers, while Steaua are
unlikely to beat the Italians, who would still win the section even if they
were to lose.
The Germans also have a superior head-to-head record over Steaua, as well as a
better goal difference should the Romanians catch Juventus sleeping.
Rangers' most damning examinations in this contest were against Juventus, but
it was the failure to win any of their matches so far against the other
also-rans in Group C which caused them greatest damage.
The fans were left still wondering what might happen if Brian Laudrup and
Gascoigne were able to produce their best on a regular basis, especially in
Europe.
One flash of Gascoigne's brilliance was enough to inject fresh enthusiasm and
hope into the 30,882 crowd which was the lowest Ibrox attandance this season.
However, he faded, and Laudrup, playing in only his second match after having
returned from a lengthy idle period because of injury, tended to be anonymous
as he remained out wide. In fact, Steaua's coach, Dumitru Dumitriu, delivered a
telling assessment on Gascoigne after the match.
``He is dangerous if you let him have the ball at his feet. He has vision, and
he is good with free kicks, but I don't think he can play for 90 minutes,'' he
said.
The Romanian also was critical of the other Rangers players, pointing out:
``They seem to be waiting all the time for Laudrup and Gascoigne to do things
when they should be trying to do things for themselves.''
It was also Dumitriu's belief that his side would have won had they not been so
anxious to subdue Gascoigne, but Steaua did play with much more momentum in the
second half when Andy Goram had to produce another series of marvellous saves.
``It was obvious, I think, that we had more chances to win than Rangers,''
Dumitriu said.
Apart from offering Goram, who had memorable saves from Antonel Pirvu, Daniel
Prodan, Ion Vladoiu, and Marius Lacatus, his thanks again, manager Walter Smith
also praised his captain, Richard Gough, who has played pretty well throughout
even though the statistics suggest the opposite.
Rangers, who have scored only four goals in five matches, have conceded 12, but
Smith said: ``I thought Gough was outstanding tonight.''
Gough's defensive partner, Gordan Petric, was not mentioned, but then he was at
fault for the Romanian side's equaliser in 55 minutes. He played a poor pass
forward to Stuart McCall, who had to stretch and lost possession allowing
Steaua to surge forward.
They shuttled the ball ahead quickly and Adrian Ilie, who had given Alan
McLaren such a difficult time in Bucharest two months ago, raced into Rangers'
box and placed the ball in the net.
If the truth be told, however, Rangers were already being shown the door
because Dortmund were leading Juventus.
Indeed, the Germans were ahead before Rangers scored their goal, but that
didn't dampen the wild celebration of Gascoigne's contribution in 31 minutes.
A high Petric clearance fell to Laudrup just inside his own half, and he played
the ball inside to Gascoigne, who immediately started forward.
But when he had crossed into enemy territory and looked up, he saw not one of
his colleagues in an ideal position.
No choice, then, than to sprint into the heart of Steaua's defence and all
around him defenders panicked.
Gascoigne seemed to increase pace, and from about 18 yards out, he put the ball
beyond Bogdan Stelea's reach and into the net.
It was Gascoigne, not Gazza. It was the footballing genius and not the
bad-tempered loutish character who often is the more dominant personality
within this troubled player.
It was the player Rangers believed they were buying when they paid Lazio #4.3m
in the close season.
Walter Smith started the match with John Brown at the heart of the defence with
Gough and Petric and McLaren filling in at right fullback for the suspended
Alex Cleland, but even though Gascoigne gave the side hope, the midfield was
not functioning properly, and Ally McCoist, with Ian Durrant playing just off
him, was too often isolated.
Support rarely arrived in time for McCoist, who had only one chance to score.
A minute into the second half, a Gascoigne free kick from the right, flicked on
by McLaren, arrived at the far post and, somehow, Stelea managed to dive to his
right and slap McCoist's powerful header away. It was a save of which even
Goram would have been proud.
Two Rangers players, McCall, who injured his groin and is doubtful for
Saturday's match against Hibernian, and Petric, were booked.
It was Petric's second caution of the competition and he will miss the final
game in Dortmund.
Lacatus will sit out Steaua's last game because he, too, received his second
caution, and another Romanian, Vladoiu, also was booked.
RANGERS - Goram, McLaren, Petric, Gough, Brown, Robertson, Gascoigne, McCall,
Laudrup, Durrant, McCoist. Substitutes - Miller, Murray, Bollan, Boyack, Scott.
STEAUA BUCHAREST - Stelea, Filipescu, Dobos, Prodan, Csik, Pirvu, Militaru,
Bucur, Lacarus, Vladoiu, Ilie. Substitutes - Rosu, Panait, Nagy, Raducan,
Gherasim.

<HEADLINE>Deal for airline will expand Edinburgh tour operator's route network Globespan buys Excalibur</HEADLINE>

GLOBESPAN, the Edinburgh-based tour operator, has bought Excalibur Airways, a
charter airline, to expand its long-haul route network.
The price of the transaction has not been disclosed, but is believed to run
into several million pounds.
Tom Dalrymple, the chairman and owner of Globespan, said the deal would enable
his company to start charter flights from Scotland to Australia next winter.
It would also lay the foundations for expanding Globespan's route network to
areas such as east and west Africa, the Far East and the Caribbean, he added.
Until now the company has concentrated on charter flights from Scotland and
England to a dozen destinations in the USA and Canada using planes chartered
from North American airlines.
Globespan also runs charter flights to Majorca and seasonal services from
London to Johannesburg and Sydney. But it has often found difficulty obtaining
planes to operate long-haul routes outside the transaltantic sector.
Excalibur Airways, which was founded in 1991, operates five leased 180-seat
Airbus 320A airliners on charter flights to European destinations.
But it will take delivery of two McDonnell Douglas DC-10 350-seat planes in the
spring which are ideal for long-haul routes.
The airline, which is based at East Midlands airport, carried 700,000
passengers last year. Although it makes a profit during the busy summer months,
a slump in winter traffic has plunged it into loss for the last two years.
``It is their purpose for selling. They could not solve the winter problem, but
we can,'' Mr Dalrymple said, noting that Excalibur made a loss of #1.6m last
year on turnover of #52m.
Globespan can solve this problem by using Excalibur planes on long-haul
services during the slack winter months. It plans a new weekly flight from
Glasgow to Sydney which will start in October 1996.
``The purpose really of buying the airline is to run charters to Australia,''
Mr Dalrymple said.
Globespan has made a profit every year since it was founded by him in 1974.
The company, which arranges package holidays as well as charter flights, made a
profit of #2m on turnover of #53m in the year to October 1994 and carried
180,000 passengers.
``We expect an increase in both turnover and profits for the year ending in
1995,'' Mr Dalrymple said.
Globespan is a classic case of a business built up from scratch by a self-made
Scottish entrepreneur.
Mr Dalrymple, who is Edinburgh born and bred, left school at 16 in 1961 to work
for Mackay Brothers, which was then the largest travel agency in Scotland.
At the age of 29 he launched Globespan and has not looked back since.
The company has grown cautiously but steadily, avoiding the boom and bust cycle
which many other UK tour operators have suffered and is the biggest tour
operator based in Scotland.
``We started off with straight charter flights, but now we sell almost 50% of
our package holidays on the charter planes,'' said Mr Dalrymple, who is 51.
Excalibur Airways is Globespan's first ever acquisition and the deal was
carefully planned to benefit both businesses.
``We are a very prudent Scottish organisation. This is not a bolt out of the
blue,'' Mr Dalrymple said.
He reckons that Globespan will add up to #17m of extra business each year to
Excalibur's existing turnover.
But the airline will continue to be run by its present management and will
actively seek new business from other sources.
Until now Excalibur's directors controlled 40% of the voting shares, with Air
Malta and the venture capital firm 3i each holding a further 30%.
Mr Dalrymple will become chairman of Excalibur once the deal is completed next
Wednesday, but Bob O'Donnell will stay on as managing director and four other
directors will keep their seats on the board.
``Globespan is an ideal partner for Excalibur,'' Mr O'Donnell said. ``The
ability to add in-house flying to Excalibur's existing portfolio of customers
will allow us to develop the company in a way that would not have been possible
from our own resources.''
Globespan has financed the acquisition of Excalibur entirely from its own
resources. ``We are a very cash-rich business relative to our size,'' Mr
Dalrymple noted.

STEPHEN Gallacher today heads a seven-strong Scottish contingent seeking to
secure their European Tour cards at the nineteenth Qualifying School at San
Roque in the south of Spain.
He makes the often perilous transition from the amateur ranks into the realms
of paid play when he tees off at Guadalmina today at the outset of the 108-hole
event. With a field of 183, competition will be fierce for the 40 available
spots.
With the financial backing of his uncle Bernard - winning European Ryder Cup
captain - Stephen is confident about his chances. ``I'm looking forward to
it,'' he said. ``I am playing some great golf from tee to green and my putting
is solid.''
A record 670 players have attempted to gain access to the circuit this year,
and tournament director Andy McFee said: ``I have been at this event since 1983
and I can safely say it's the toughest one yet.''
Elsewhere, Raymond Russell, Scott Henderson, Andrew Crerar, David Scott,
William Guy, Stephen Thompson, and veteran Brian Marchbank will compete.
q A DOUBLE bogey on the 471-yard par-4 last cost Gary Weir his second outright
win of the season at the East of Scotland Alliance outing after a gap of almost
15 years at Monktonhall, Musselburgh, yesterday.
Stuart Callan also won the handicap Jordan Cup with a better inward half,
three-under-par 32, from Weir and amateur David Smith (Dunfermline), who had a
78 off 9. Results:
Scratch: 69 - S Callan (Dalmahoy), G Weir (Braid Hills DR). 70 - C Brooks
(Glencorse). 71 - F Mann (Monktonhall), P Terras (Goswick). 72 - G Walker
(Royal Musselburgh). Handicap (Jordan Cup): 69 - Callan (b.i.h.), Weir, D Smith
(Dunfermline, 9). 70 - P Ritchie (Bathgate, 10). 71 - A Wight (Glencorse, 3).
72 - R Patrick (Glenbervie, 8), G Johnston (Glenbervie, 7), M Louden
(Glencorse, 4), R Gibson (Newbattle, 3). Assistants: 72 - Walker.
q OPEN champion John Daly, Greg Norman, and Steve Elkington are some of the
star attractions at the Australian Open, which starts today at Kingston Heath,
Melbourne.
There are many Europeans in the line-up, including Volvo Masters winner
Alexander Cejka and the French World Cup pair, Jean Van de Velde and Jean-Louis
Guepy, plus Englishmen Gary Evans, Steven Richardson, and Steven Bottomley.

JOHN WARD has retired as an executive director of IBM after a 29-year career
with the US-based computer company. Mr Ward, above, joined IBM in 1966 and was
appointed resident director for Scotland and Northern England in 1991, with
direct oversight of the group's huge personal computer factory in Greenock.
IBM said he would retain his association with the company in a non-executive
capacity as a member of its advisory board. Mr Ward, 55, ended a two-year stint
as chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland in September.
But he is far from seeking early retirement. Last week he was appointed a
non-executive director of the Glasgow-based Macfarlane (Clansman) packaging
group.

Hibernian 3, Partick Thistle 0
THE lights shone all night at Easter Road but Thistle were left stumbling into
the team bus, bedraggled and beaten by a Hibs team that rediscovered the
shooting form that had been so evident earlier in the season.
The capital side were comfortable winners in the game rearranged after the
floodlights had failed to come on two weeks ago, and in the process,
consolidated their third place in the premier division. They also crept to
within four points of Celtic in second place and ended a hiccup in which they
had lost their previous two games.
They will, therefore, go into their next challenge, against Rangers on
Saturday, in much better fettle than might have been the case and will
entertain a much bigger crowd than the 7137, the lowest in the league so far,
last night.
Thistle were still in with a shout midway in the second half, at which point
they were only down by a Darren Jackson first-half goal, but when Mickey Weir
and then Kevin McAllister scored, the contest was over.
Jackson appeared in the side following a bout of flu, and that was to prove
fortunate, but before then, the international striker felt the full weight of a
tough tackle from Gregg Watson in the first minute and needed attention.
Jackson's namesake, Chris, almost startled the few Thistle fans in the south
stand when he seemed sure to score from a fine pass by Mickey Weir, but a
superb tackle by Alan Dinnie saved Partick.
Thistle had appeared to have withstood the early fire from Hibs, shooting
downhill, and indeed, they came close with a Steve Welsh header from an Ian
Cameron corner, but they were caught out after 20 minutes.
Steven Tweed had done the work, breaking down the inside-left channel, before
the ball broke to Weir, who passed it on to Jackson, and he hammered the ball
home from the edge of the box.
Thistle had to take off Steve Pittman, who had suffered a knock, and bring on
Calum Milne. The former Hibs man soon upset his ex-team's fans with a scything
tackle on Chris Jackson which earned him a yellow card.
Hibs tried to claim a penalty when Weir was hampered by Tom Smith but the
referee was not fooled. Andy Millen had his name taken for persistent fouling
which gave Thistle a free kick and some respite into the bargain.
Thistle began the second half without the injured Wayne Foster. Andy Gibson was
his replacement and the new man let Derek McWilliams in with a chance, but the
midfield player lofted the ball over the bar. The Firhill team looked to be
down and out in 52 minutes, however, when Hibs were awarded a penalty. Darren
Jackson was impeded, albeit marginally, by Tommy Turner, as he worked a 1-2
with Weir, and referee Tait, who was close up, gave the spot-kick instantly.
Jackson hit the penalty hard but Nicky Walker flung himself to his right to
block the ball and, while still on the ground, managed to parry the second
attempt by the striker and eventually grasp the ball to his chest.
However, Hibs went two clear. Joe Tortolano deceived the entire Thistle defence
with a marvellous pass through the middle and Weir ran on to it, got around
Walker and kept his head while being challenged to slide the ball over the
line. Three minutes later the points were safely locked away. Darren Jackson
went speeding through the middle, and timed his pass to McAllister perfectly
for the winger to shoot out of Walker's reach.
Hibs' manager Alex Miller was happy that his team had recovered their form. ``I
thought we showed a wee bit of character tonight, especially after missing a
penalty, because we put up our sleeves and worked hard again.''
HIBERNIAN - Leighton, Dods, Tortolano, McGinlay, Tweed, Hunter, McAllister,
Millen, Weir, D Jackson, C Jackson. Substitutes - Evans, Donald, Miller.
PARTICK THISTLE - Walker, Dinnie, Pittman, Smith, Welsh, Watson, McWilliams,

BORUSSIA Dortmund's victory over Juventus in Turin last night secured their
place in the quarter-finals of the European Champions' League in Group C
alongside the Italian champions.
Well-taken goals from former German internationalist Michael Zorc and Lars
Ricken ended the Italian side's 100 per cent record in the group and gave the
Germans revenge for a humiliating 3-1 defeat at home earlier in the year.
Zorc opened the scoring after 29 minutes with a powerful right-foot shot from
the edge of the box. Ricken made it 2-0 in the sixty-fourth minute, quickly
latching on to a misdirected header from Juventus defender Massimo Carrera and
drilling the ball past keeper Angelo Peruzzi.
Juventus, whose home form has faded after an impressive start to the season,
grabbed an injury-time consolation goal through second-half substitute
Alessandro Del Piero, who has now scored in each of his team's five cup matches
to date.
``We paid for two defensive mistakes,'' said Marcello Lippi, the Juventus
coach. ``My players tried hard, but it was not their best night.''
Ricken, cautioned for the second time in the tournament, will miss Borussia's
last qualifying match, against Rangers on December 6.
JUVENTUS - Peruzzi, Porrini, Pessotto, Carrera, Vierchowod, Tacchinardi, Di
Livio, Jugovic, Vialli, Marocchi, Padovano.
BORUSSIA DORTMUND - Klos, Kree, Schmidt, Freund, Kohler, Sammer, Reuter, Zorc,

BEEF cattle judge Ewen Macpherson of Benderloch, Oban, hailed yesterday's
Scottish National Winter Fair at Perth as one of the best for many years. ``It
is debatable whether we will see any better cattle at Smithfield next week,''
he said.
His choice for the overall championship was a lightweight cross-bred Limousin
steer from A Macgregor (Allanfauld), Kilsyth. Reserve was a 415kg cross-bred
Limousin heifer shown by Ray Grieve of Carlhurlie, Lundin Links, by Leven, Fife.
The champion, which weighed 465kg, is a son of Scottish Livestock Services'
renowned bull Shatton Pedro, which, coincidentally, was put down yesterday at
the age of 16.
The overall championship and reserve in the sheep classes went to the
father-and-son team of Richard and Granville Colegrave of Guardswell, Abernyte,
Inchture, who were showing at their first winter fair. Their winning pen of two
ewe lambs were from a Beltex tup out of a Dutch Texel ewe. The Colegraves have
400 ewes and 130 cows.
Judge Malcolm MacDiarmid of the Perth Fresh Meat Company said the lambs showed
excellent quality stemming from skilled stockmanship. He added they were ideal
for the export trade and that he expected to see many more like them coming on
to the market. His company was currently buying 1000 lambs a week for export.
Andy Hamilton, president of the Scottish National Fatstock Club, was well
pleased with the support for the fair. ``We have had a record number of entries
and numbers through the gate must be at least the same as last year,'' he said.
By afternoon the organisers were having to divert vehicles to an overflow car
park.
Arrangements were already in hand for next year at Perth, he said, but he was
cautious about suggestions that the event could stretch to two days. ``I would
prefer one day which is full of interest all day,'' he said.
Beef championship results: Lightweight steer - A Macgregor (Allanfauld),
Kilsyth; reserve John Y Currie, Southook Farm, Kilmarnock. Intermediate steer -
George McFadzean Jnr, Woodhead of Mailer, Perth; reserve AR Grieve, Lundin
Links, by Leven, Fife. Heavyweight steer - J Scott Watson Balhousie Farm,
Carnoustie; reserve Jack S Wight, Midlock, Crawford, Biggar.
Lightweight heifer - AR Grieve; reserve Hugh Dunlop, Mill o' Shiel, Barbieston,
Ayrshire. Heavyweight heifer - David B Sinclair, Abernyte House, Inchture,
Perthshire; reserve Bertie S Paton, Spott, Glenprosen, Angus. Supreme heifer -
AR Grieve; reserve Hugh Dunlop.
In the carcase section (live) the championship went to David Cunningham,
Walkerdyke, Strathaven; reserve David Robertson, Crail, Fife.
Sheep - champion Monzie Farms, Crieff; reserve Mary Dunlop, Corstane, Biggar.
Pigs - champion J&amp;H Traquair &amp; Son, Wellington Farm, Dalkeith; reserve W.&amp;.AM
Meiklejohn, Pitkennedy, Forfar.

LIVINGSTON'S players are going back to school in an attempt to spread the
football word around the town.
The club are to start a pilot scheme in the primary schools in the area and
hope to extend it to all of West Lothian.
Manager Jim Leishman said yesterday: ``The plan is for all our full-time
players to go into schools on a Monday and Tuesday and carry out coaching when
the youngsters are at physical education classes.
``This is a trial project, but, if successful, I would hope to see it expanded.
If any other schools in the West Lothian region are interested they should get
in touch.
``I don't think there is another club in Scotland attempting this. But it's
another example of the way we are integrating into the area and we now have a
restaurant and a social club open.''
Premier division Kilmarnock will visit Livingston on Monday to inaugurate the
floodlights at the new Almondvale Stadium, and Leishman added: ``It's kind of
Killie and their manager, Alex Totten, to come and we expect another full
house. Tickets are on sale and I hope the Killie fans who slagged me so often
will come along.''
q UNLUCKY Berwick central defender Mark Wilson is heading back to hospital in
another attempt to discover the cause of a mystery injury. And as the Berwick
injury list lengthens, manager Tom Hendrie yesterday pleaded for money to keep
alive their promotion hopes.
Wilson was carried off in the match against Queen of the South on Tuesday and
Hendrie said: ``It is a recurrence of a knee injury and this time we will need
to find the cause. He had a cartilege operation, but then had further trouble
in the knee.
Things are so bad at Berwick that Hendrie was on the bench for a recent match
and assistant, John Couglin, had to be included in the side against Clyde, even
though he had not played in the top team for two years.

q ABERDEEN are odds-on favourites to beat Dundee and lift their first trophy in
over five years. Corals have made the Dons 5-6 to triumph in Sunday's Coca-Cola
Cup final at Hampden while the Dens Park men are 11-4, with a draw after 90
minutes on offer at 9-4. Scott Booth is favourite to score first at 5-1, with
Pittodrie team-mate Billy Dodds 6-1. Dundee's George Shaw is 7-1 and Jim
Hamilton 8-1.
ABERDEEN captain Stewart McKimmie will travel to Hampden on Sunday hoping to
fulfil a lifelong dream he felt had moved beyond his grasp.
McKimmie, who will lead his home-town team into the Coca-Cola Cup final against
Dundee, still remembers the taunts and jeers which followed him for so much of
last season, wants to be the first Aberdeen-born captain of the Pittodrie team
to hold a trophy since Martin Buchan 25 years ago.
``It's something you dream about,'' said McKimmie, ``but last season, when
things were going so badly, I just could not believe it would happen for me.''
Then, of course, Aberdeen were fighting for league survival and McKimmie was
the target for the boo boys, just as other home-town skippers have been down
through the years.
Says McKimmie: ``It has always been the case that Aberdeen-born captains get a
hard time from the support. It happened to me last season, but now it seems to
be in the past. Of course, now the team is playing better and that helps.
``When I was asked to be captain last season I began to think how it would be
to win a trophy and to hold it above my head at Hampden. But the way we were
playing I became convinced that that would never happen. Now there is a chance
to do it.
``It will not be easy against Dundee. They have beaten two premier division
sides already.''
The Scotland international full back believes that the pressure on Sunday will
be on Aberdeen. He says: ``Dundee are not expected to win and people will look
to last season when Raith Rovers defeated Celtic. All of that will put pressure
on us, but we have to be able to handle that.
``The one thing which may work in our favour is that Dundee, like ourselves,
are a team who like to attack. This could be a high-scoring final, because both
of us have so many potential scorers.
``Last weekend we gave our worst performance of the season at Kirkcaldy against
Raith Rovers. They just did not give us any room to play. Teams who close us
down give us problems. But Dundee would have to change their style if they were
to try that.''
The captain and the rest of the Aberdeen players know that their best games
this year have been in this tournament. On their way to the final they had
notable victories over Motherwell and Rangers.
But McKimmie stresses: ``We still don't have consistency. When I first came
here we seemed to be in a cup final every season - and we were winning them,
too. You just didn't think about losing.
``Now there has been a gap of five-and-a-half years since we last won a cup. We
want to win this one and only consistency will do that.''
Manager Roy Aitken also was preaching consistency. He pointed out: ``When we
are at our best we can match any team in the country, but sometimes we let
ourselves down.
``In the quarter-final and the semi-final against Motherwell and Rangers we
showed what we can do. If we play in that manner in the final then we will win
the cup.
``As far as I'm concerned if we do win then that will simply be the start of
something here.
``If we could go on a run of success then I might be able to bring more quality
players to Aberdeen. Players like to be associated with successful clubs. In
fact, it would help me keep some of our good players here.
``This will be an attractive final, a big crowd, a great atmosphere, and is a
challenge for the players we have here at Aberdeen, if they take up the
challenge then we all have a new beginning.''
Aberdeen have just one player ruled out through injury, defender Colin
Woodthorpe, who is still suffering the effects of a broken bone in a foot.
Two more players, Theo Snelders and Eoin Jess, are doubtful, but Aitken
insisted yesterday: ``We have an extra day to get them ready with the final on
Sunday. I'm confident that I'll have both players.''
Meantime, Dundee managing director Nigel Squire yesterday told exiled chairman
Ron Dixon: ``You can have my seat at Hampden.''
Canadian chairman Dixon, whose #2m investment has helped keep Dundee in
business, has been out of Scotland for a year - and was out of contact with the
Dens Park board for more than six months.
But Squire revealed yesterday that Dixon had made a transatlantic call from
Vancouver to wish the club all the best for Sunday's final. ``I've had a
telephone call from Ron and he knew all about the club's progress - the
semi-final win over Airdrie, and the derby win,'' said Squire.
``I told him we would love to see him at Hampden on Sunday, but he has a lot of
business on at the moment. I'm keeping one seat for him if he needs it.''

IMPRESSIVE, imperial, Impreza. Lanark's Colin McRae is rallying's best in the
world, along with his Subaru team. And he's the first Briton to have won the
title.
What was a turbulent Tuesday, with mishaps flying about like the mud of the
difficult courses set for the Network Q RAC Rally, turned into a welcome
Wednesday as McRae charged through the final stages to finish in Chester as
overall winner ahead of rival Carlos Sainz, and take that coveted world crown -
and at 27, he is the youngest to do so.
On top of all that, it suddenly became a family affair, with 24-year-old
brother Alister taking fourth place overall. The previous best by two brothers
was in 1989 when Kenneth and Hakan Eriksson finished first and tenth in the
Swedish Rally.
``It hasn't sunk in yet,'' said Colin. ``I am delighted - this was my, Derek's,
and the team's goal this year. I've struggled for years to get a good result on
the RAC Rally. We put in a very quick time on Monday's first gravel stage which
gave me confidence.''
Co-driver Derek Ringer added: ``There were a few   hairy moments, of course,
but most of the time, Colin drove very smoothly.''
Dad Jimmy McRae, who began the family's celebrations by winning the RAC
Historic Rally on Sunday said: ``I am very proud of them both. I was a bit
worried I'd put too much pressure on Colin by winning,'' he joked.
In third place, behind Carlos Sainz, were Richard Burns and co-driver Robert
Reid from Spittal, near Perth - making it a 1-2-3 for Subaru.
Kilmarnock's Robbie Head finished fifteenth overall in his Renault Clio Maxi,
four places behind was Brian Lyall from Aberdeen driving a Ford Escort.

MOTORSPORT
COLIN McRae yesterday completed an emphatic victory in the Network Q RAC Rally
to be crowned Britain's first world rally champion and the youngest-ever winner
of the title.
To achieve his second successive win in the British event the Scot tamed his
team-mate and rival Carlos Sainz to triumph by 36 seconds at the end of 28
testing special stages and four days of hectic action.
More than 2000 fans chanted ``easy, easy'' at the official rally finish at
Chester Racecourse while McRae sprayed champagne from the bonnet of his Subaru
Imprenza with co-driver Derek Ringer.
``I am sure this will be the first world championship of many for Colin, the
way he is driving at the moment,'' said team manager David Richards, whose
controversial decision last month could have cost 27-year-old McRae the title.
The relationship was strained almost to breaking point when Richards imposed
team orders on the Catalonia Rally in order to ensure that Sainz won, sending
both into the final event level on points.
McRae belatedly obeyed, but all that was forgotten in the moment of triumph
yesterday as he celebrated victory with his father Jimmy, who won the Historic
Rally, and brother Alister, who was fourth overall.
Colin deserved the title for the way in which he battled back after two
punctures had come close to deflating his championship dream on the second day.
``Colin had his setbacks in the early part of the rally, but there was never a
moment when he did not give the impression that he was in total control and
knew he could get the time back,'' added Richards.
The Lanark-born racer - whose previous successes have ensured a luxury
lifestyle, with homes in Switzerland and Monte Carlo - kept himself in
contention by hammering his broken suspension into shape with a log. He had
seen his lead wiped out in killer Kielder Forest in Northumberland, McRae
responded by gradually clawing back the 74-seconds deficit on Sainz.
McRae had to finish ahead of the double champion to take the title and
gradually gnawed away at the Spaniard's lead with a series of storming drives
in the rain-lashed, mud-splattered forest roads of Wales yesterday.
He won six of the seven timed tests to regain the lead on the final stage and
hold a 17-second cushion when the drivers returned to Wales for the climax.
McRae extended that to 38 seconds by winning the first four legs - taking his
rally total to 17 out of a possible 28 - before Sainz finally got the better of
him by three seconds. But he was never going to threaten further.
Richard Burns ensured Subaru added their first manufacturers' title by
finishing third - having nearly gone out on the first stage when his steering
broke - 6min 39sec down on the winner. ``This is just fantastic, especially as
I thought our rally was over after stage one,'' said Burns.

COLIN McRae's first steps towards winning the biggest prize in rallying and
becoming the first Briton to win the World Rally Championship began two years
ago with a limited overseas programme, driving a Subaru Legacy.
Team manager David Richards secured the then 25-year-old McRae under contract.
The Scot began repaying the investment in his burgeoning talent with two
victories, New Zealand and Malaysia.
Last year - at the wheel of a Subaru Impreza 555 - he added the Network Q RAC
Rally and Rally Australia to his win in New Zealand. But 1994 also had its
downs. In Monte Carlo, he crashed and was relegated to tenth. Portugal ended
with a fire, and Corsica after an accident. In May's Acropolis Rally, he was
excluded after a verbal clash with officials, and he crashed out of the Rally
Argentina.
He won the final round of the series but it also created new pressures. Colin
and Derek Ringer - his co-driver of nine years' standing - were now tipped as
hot favourites to win the 1995 championship.
In January's opening round in Monte Carlo McRae crashed out on an icy corner.
In the snowy forests of Sweden he retired with engine failure. After two of the
eight rounds he didn't have a single point. He managed third place in Portugal
and, after fifth in Corsica, New Zealand again was the watershed. His
domination was total.
After the Asia-Pacific, it was in September's Rally Australia that a new,
mature McRae emerged. Lying first equal with Kenneth Eriksson's Mitsubishi, he
let the Swede take victory and settled for championship points.
The seventh round was in Spain - home ground for Carlos Sainz, a rival for the
title.
Starting the final day, he was second to Sainz but team orders dictated they
should hold their positions. It was only after much persuasion by Richards and
Colin's father, Jimmy, that McRae reluctantly booked in late at the final
control, letting Sainz win.
The scene was now set for an emotional and public showdown on McRae's home
event. Fairly and squarely the better man won.

SURVEYS can be very entertaining, though not always particularly enlightening.
I once asked a group of residents whether they wished to have a bus service
introduced into their area. ``Yes,'' replied 98%.
Would they use it? You bet, chorused the same number. Would they be prepared to
have the bus stop outside their front gate? ``No,'' replied 98%.
Would Scottish businessmen like a Scottish parliament? The Fraser of Allander
Institute for the Scottish Chambers of Commerce did not, for reasons best known
to themselves, actually ask that question in their survey entitled
``Constitutional Canvass''.
Instead they invited companies to indicate whether decentralising
decision-making from Westminster would improve business prospects. I would have
thought this was akin to inquiring whether they would prefer dry to wet weather.
No matter, 50.1% of those who bothered to reply - there was only a 19% response
rate so you can judge what a hot topic this is - agreed with the proposition
and 38.1% said it would make not a blind bit of difference.
To my utter amazement this is interpreted as ``Business chiefs back home rule''.
Mr Peter Dunn, acting director general of the Scottish Chambers, declares that
the survey shows ``a tidal move'' in attitudes and posed questions for all
political parties. Like, what's this guy talking about? I wish to see a
Scottish parliament. And an English parliament and a Welsh one and another in
Northern Ireland; for I am a federalist. What I do not wish to come to pass is
the pig's breakfast which is being proposed by the Labour Party, the Liberal
Democrats, and the Canon's kids of the Convention.
And nor, very decisively, does the vast majority of Scottish business. Nearly
70% say a tax-raising assembly would harm their companies' prospects and,
should that come to pass, some of them will think of relocating elsewhere in
the UK. How could this be translated into business backing home rule,
particularly when 74.4% also reject independence?
But the Lib-Dems are terribly pleased with themselves. In Edinburgh their
leader, Councillor Donald Gorrie, a man so enamoured by a Scottish parliament
that he has spent most of his days trying unsuccessfully to get to Westminster,
is forever producing motions congratulating his own party and suggesting we
should all join in the big jamboree next week. If he had any pride at all he
would be putting his kilt over his head.
For the Lib-Dems are perhaps most to blame for the daft scheme which lies on
the table. It was they who sold their souls for a mess of potage.
Don't we all remember the lectures we were given on proportional
representation, the saviour of all mankind? And not just any old PR system
would do.
Councillor Gorrie for one has harped on continuously about the fairness of the
single-transferable-vote method. He is quite right.
So are we to have that? Not a chance. Donald's ducks chickened out. They and
Labour did a dirty deal and adopted the additional-member system. Thus, in a
parliament of 129, we are to have 56 members who will be elected only by the
party hacks. Getting your name on the list will be better than a council job in
Monklands.
Mrs Marilyne McLaren, Donald's left-hand woman, told me on Tuesday this system
was ``reasonably proportional''. A bit like becoming slightly pregnant, one
assumes.
The Lib-Dems wanted a bigger parliament. They lost. The Convention told us they
would impose gender balance. They won't.
We have still to hear the fate of the Secretary of State for Scotland and his
ministers in these exciting new arrangements. Will they even exist? If so, what
are they to be doing - carrying messages from Regent Road to Westminster,
pleading for English hand-outs, trying to persuade foreign companies to locate
in the highest-taxed area of Britain?
The English backlash to these arrangements will not be long in the making. It
will occur, even to the dimmest honourable member, that the Scots are trying to
have their oatcake and eat it too.
We are already over-represented at Westminster. Now we are to have our own
parliament, partly paid for by the rest of the UK, in addition. And we can
still vote on English legislation.
Those are the fundamental flaws in this scheme for an assembly. If it is set up
I do not believe a future Conservative government would ever dismantle the
parliament.
Much more likely would be a move to cut the Scottish MPs and reduce the
contribution from the Treasury. Try keeping the tax at 3p extra then.
The Fraser survey was based on the opinions of fewer than one in five of
Scottish businesses but we should not condemn it for that. Nor should any
Conservatives think they can sit smugly back.
There was considerable dissatisfaction with the status quo. People from all
walks of life feel that the Government is too remote, that decisions should be
taken nearer the grass roots.
We need new, innovative ideas to counter that feeling.
I could be wrong, of course, but I rather think the Secretary of State may have
something to say on the subject this week. Time for another survey, perhaps?

Vienna, Wednesday - Opec today agreed to freeze its output quota into an
unprecedented third year in an attempt to buoy sagging world oil prices.
A ministerial conference of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries ended in an accord to stay with a ceiling on total output set in 1993
at 24.52 million barrels daily for six more months to June next year.
Oil futures prices showed little reaction. Although they may find support for
now, market experts doubted if they would rally strongly.
The Opec meeting ended with no decision on Gabon's wish to leave the cartel
unless it is excused full annual membership fees. This will be discussed when
the organisation meets again in June.
Weak prices below $17 per barrel, compared with an Opec goal of $21, had left
little option for the 11 participating ministers but to extend output quotas.
Ministers also had to address the problem of the alleged quota violations by
several of the 12 members including Venezuela, Qatar, and Nigeria that have
lifted actual Opec volume some one million barrels daily above the agreed
ceiling.
But a communique made no mention of quota compliance.
Geoff Pyne, an energy economist at banking house UBS, felt that Opec should
ideally have cut production.
The quota rollover ``is bad news for producers because prices may soften,'' he
said. ``But a crash is unlikely. Industry conditions have changed.''

NEW flexible lease terms are being introduced north of the Border in a bid to
attract business start-ups into industrial premises. London-based CINIO Estates
believes that the traditional 25-year property lease is frightening off new
businesses which are reluctant to see themselves lumbered with a factory which
is no longer required, or of being unable to buy a property if the business
expands rapidly.
Now CINIO, which recently purchased some 352,750 sq ft of light industrial
space from Glenrothes Development Corporation, has introduced a new flexi-lease
scheme for potential occupiers. The scheme allows new businesses to take short
leases of units at competitive rentals. The initial lease term is for two
years, accompanied by an option to extend the lease or to buy the unit outright
at a predetermined price, if preferred. The incentive is available at CINIO's
Bankhead and Eastfield industrial estates in the Fife new town.
John Sims, managing director of The IO Group, one of the joint venture partners
of CINIO Estates, says: ``At the tail end of a recession we have to stimulate
new business more than ever before, but many potential start up companies,
often with technically brilliant ideas, are scared off by the stringent terms
of traditional leases.
``With flexi-lease we have ended one of the main anxieties of the new venture -
either being stuck with a factory lease when it is no longer required, or
conversely being unable to buy the property if the business takes off.
``We have listened to a lot of people across the UK in devising this scheme,
and we know it is something that the market place badly needs.''
Several units have been let since CINIO initiated its refurbishment programme
in Glenrothes, with new occupiers including Amtrak, Valhope Ltd, and Ryehill
Wines. Other tenants on the estates include United Artists, Apricot Computers,
and Jewsons. The joint letting agents are Gooch &amp; Wagstaff and Graham &amp; Sibbald.
Michael Court of Graham &amp; Sibbald says: ``The inquiry level has noticeably
increased for these premises since the refurbishment has been completed, and we
are finding that potential occupiers welcome being able to tailor the lease
terms to suit their individual requirements.''
The initiative has been welcomed by Joe Noble, director of property and
environment at Fife Enterprise. He says: ''Flexible lease lengths can be
important to expanding companies and therefore this innovation in Glenrothes is
to be welcomed.''

ONE of Scotland's most important industrial locations has no new factory or
warehouse space under construction. A combination of low rents and high land
prices is hindering development in West Lothian, according to a new analysis of
Lothian Region's industrial property sector by surveyors King Sturge &amp; Co.
The report reveals that although West Lothian remains one of the prime
industrial locations north of the Border, speculative development is still
being viewed as uneconomic.
Lothian's highest industrial rents are being achieved in South Gyle and
Sighthill at #5.15 per sq ft. Assuming a land value of #125,500 per acre, the
surveyors calculate that a rent of #4.50 per sq ft should justify new
development and provide an acceptable profit for the developer.
Lothian Region contains some 20.4 million sq ft of industrial floorspace of
which only 30% is situated in Edinburgh, while half the space is in West
Lothian.
The survey analyses the stock by size and reveals that over 80% of all
industrial units offer less than 11,000 sq ft, with two-thirds of the space
being less than 5400 sq ft.
The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a boom in industrial development in
Edinburgh, a trend which dropped off sharply in the 1990s. This has resulted in
over 55% of industrial units in Edinburgh being built in the 1980s, accounting
for 36% of the total industrial floorspace. The lower vacancy rates of 1990s
accommodation indicate greater demand for modern space - only 3.6% of
industrial space built since 1990 is vacant.
Some 8.1% of Edinburgh's industrial floorspace is vacant. The region's highest
vacancy rate is in Midlothian where 11% of the space is available. King Sturge
points to a continued demand for units at the larger end of the market and is
optimistic about the Lothian market's future.
Demand for industrial accommodation has improved over the past 12 to 18 months,
but not sufficiently to raise rental values enough to give developers
confidence to build new property. The situation is exacerbated by a shortage of
suitable development sites, especially in the area west of Edinburgh.
Meanwhile, on the investment side of Lothian's industrial market, deals
involving nearly 1.3 million sq ft of space have been concluded by surveyors
Ryden. The firm has completed five major transactions involving the sale or
acquisition of industrial buildings for almost #7.5m.
Acting on behalf on Macdonald Martin Distilleries plc, producers of
Glenmorangie whisky, Ryden has acquired the Bells bottling complex at East
Mains Industrial Estate in Broxburn.
The facility, which provides more than 840,000 sq ft of bottling, production
and office space on a site area of 30 acres, cost #4.25m.

A MANAGEMENT buyout team headed by two Scots has bought Reed Regional
Newspapers (RRN), which has 129 principal titles, from Anglo-Dutch media group
Reed Elsevier in a #205m deal.
The buyout team is backed by Kohiber Kravis Rovers (KKR), a New-York based
venture capital buy-out specialist, in its first European acquisition.
Jim Brown, who has been chief executive of Reed's newspaper division for five
years, will be chairman and chief executive, while Paul Davidson will be deputy
chief executive of the new company. Finance for the deal has been sourced by
Glenisla Group, the privately held corporation backed by KKR and headed by
former Grand Metropolitan deputy chairman Ian Martin.
The six-strong buy-out team beat off several rival bidders to secure the
company and together will have a ``substantial'' stake in the operation. The
129 separate principal titles, a combination of regional evenings, weeklies and
free papers, have an aggregate circulation of around 4.1m copies per issue and
7.5m readers. Among the titles is the Worcester Journal, the world's oldest
newspaper at 305 years.
KKR said its philosophy in acquiring companies is to become a partner with
management, offering a buy-out team a significant equity ownership stake and
providing support and advice at the board level to assist the company in
building long-term value.
It said the partnership with KKR will create an independent company out of a
larger business and provide the capital and resources.The new company, yet to
be named though likely to be Prospect Media Group, is expected to take over the
business by the end of the year and would ``be looking for sensible
acquisitions in the local paper field,'' said Mr Brown.
Commenting on the acquisition, its attraction and future potential, Scott M
Stuart, general partner of KKR, said: ``RRN has a strong management team led by
Jim Brown with extensive experience of the regional newspaper industry. Most of
the senior management have five or more years experience at board level and
have been the architects in growing the business.
``Already one of the four largest publishers of free newspapers in the UK, RRN
is at the forefront of the development of quality free newpapers, a sector in
which RRN is a market leader. With KKR's backing and support, the management
team is now well placed to accelerate further the growth of the business.
Regional newspapers have particularly good prospects for growth both
organically and through acquisition.''
Mr Brown said: ``The management team were greatly impressed with KKR,
particularly their ambitions to grow the company. We know of their track record
of being patient investors and we are confident that working together with them
we will be seeeing quite a success story in the future.''
Reed Elsevier's divestments of its consumer businesses, the majority of which
were put up for sale in July, has so far raised #685m. It is part of the
group's strategy to focus on more profitable professional publications and
business information.
In addition to the RRN deal, four transactions have been agreed - three in the
Netherlands and one in the US. Perracombinatie, a publisher of Dutch daily
newspapers, said yesterday that it had completed the acquisition of
Dagbladunie, which published two big Dutch newspapers, NRC Handelsblad and
Algemeen Dagblad, for Reed Elsevier.
This is expected to be completed on December 29 to raise #346m. Other
agreements include the sale of a Dutch regional newspaper and also six Dutch
consumer magazines. In the US, K111 Communications agreed to buy the consumer
magazines of Chaners Publishing.
The five transactions result in an exceptional gain of around #385m but this
will be reduced by the non-cash exceptional loss which Reed Elsevier expects to
make on the sale of Reed Consumer Books which is already at an advanced stage.
Restructuring charges relating to the consumer business divestments as well as
further exceptional losses from the planned disposal of other non-core
activities will also reduce the exceptional gain. Meanwhile, current trading of
the group remains fully in line with its expectations in August when it said it
expected further growth in the second half of the year.

WHEN asked about his leading the management buyout of Reed Regional Newspapers
(RRN) from Reed Elsevier, Jim Brown was quick yesterday to point out that two
Scots were behind the deal - himself and Paul Davidson.
Mr Davidson will be deputy chief executive of the new company. Mr Brown, who
has been chief executive at RRN for five years will add chairman to his title
when the deal is completed at the end of December.
Now 60, and from Ayr, he cut his teeth in journalism on the Ayrshire Post,
following his brother Ian on to the paper after leaving Ayr Academy at 16. Ian,
now retired, later became editor of the Scottish Daily Express.
Jim Brown did a six-year stint in as a journalist on the Glasgow Evening
Citizen then moved to the management side of the business at Edinburgh for
Thomson where he was promotions manager.
He then became general circulation manager in Aberdeen for two to three years
before setting off on his travels again, working on various papers before
moving to the Manchester Evening News where he was circulation director and
charman of two groups of newsagents.
Thomson then claimed him back and in 1980 he was a main board circulation
director and after that managing director of Thames Valley Newspapers.
Ten years ago he was headhunted by RRN. Except for his first job on the
Ayrshire Post, he can proudly claim that he has always been headhunted.
Mr Brown, who in his youth found time to play rugby for West of Scotland, is
coy about the exact stake the management team will have in the new company
except that it is ``substantial''.
Any possible flotation on the stock market is still a long way off. ``We've got
to learn to swim first,'' he said. First priorities will be to expand the
business, and acquisitions are in prospect.
Family connections with newspapers are strong. Apart from his brother, the
editor of the Ayr Advertiser is a relative and one of his daughters works as a
journalist on the Daily Mail in London. Another daughter is in newspaper
advertising.
Mr Brown tells the story of how he ``snatched'' the notorious Walter Scott
Ellis outside the Glasgow High Court during a riot which followed the not
proven verdict, after interviews, it seemed, had been promised to everyone.
The car was waiting and he bundled Ellis into it, only to discover it was the
Daily Record car, not the Evening Citizen.
Fortunately the other car had followed and a transfer was managed and Ellis was
rushed to a hotel hide-out at Loch Lomond. A phone call was made but Mr Brown's
brother at the Express had tapped the line and Express journalists had to be
repelled.
Mr Davidson, 40, the deputy chief excutive is from Govan and started his
newspaper career with Thomson in Aberdeen before setting up his own advertising
training business.
Both men's wives come from Kilmarnock but, said Mr Brown, this is pure
coincidence.

<HEADLINE>UTILITIES Heavy demand for National Grid</HEADLINE>

THE National Grid, the electricity transmission network which is to be floated
next month, began trading in the grey market yesterday at 230p.
In heavy trading of around 15 million shares, the price rose quickly to 240p
but ended off its best levels at 228p, but still valued in excess of #3500m.
Although most City analysts believe the shares are worth about 200p, heavy
demand from financial institutions is expected to buoy the share price for some
time.
The shares are expected to be a solid if not spectacular investment. While
there will be a large stock overhang, only 44% of the shares will be on offer,
the business is a monopoly.
Four directors of National Grid are sitting on a #1.3m-plus potential cash pile
since the start of share trading. Chairman David Jeffries and John Uttley, Eric
Chefneux and Colin Gibson together own 590,000 shares in the company, which
have earned them more than #300,000 in dividends. Mr Uttley, the finance
director, has said he will donate his dividend to charity.
The National Grid is being demerged from the 12 regional electricity companies
(RECs) of England and Wales. Only six of the companies are committed to
distributing their holdings to their shareholders.
Midlands Electricity may decide to distribute its 9% holding. REC shareholders
will be asked to approve the Grid distribution at extraordinary meetings on
December 8. Each REC has said that it will cut domestic charges from next April
by a one-off #50 as part of the Grid demerger.
The National Grid increased its interim profits by 25% to #335.5m in the six
months ended September 30. The profit growth came despite increased losses from
its Energis telephone company of #40.1m, up from #19.2m previously. Profits
from the transmission business, which accounts for around 5% of consumer bills,
rose by #38m to #356.8m.
Turnover from continuing businesses rose by #70m to #706m. The directors have
declared an interim dividend of #70m up from #54m previously.
The interim dividend is expected to represent around 40% of total net dividends
and will be paid in February each year. Capital expenditure in the six months
was #107.7m, down from #186.9m previously.
The decrease was mainly a result of lower expenditure in Energis and the
transmission business, with the latter due to delays in obtaining planning
approvals.
Although the business is thought to have scope to cut operating costs by as
much as 30%, political and regulatory worries could dampen some of the
enthusiasm for the stock.

ACCORDING to the press we are all worry-ing about Charles and Diana and the
future of the monarchy. Well, include me out, and I'm a born-again worrier. I
worry about the un-employed, our pensioners, the health service and the sick,
the plight of the Ogonis in Nigeria. I worry about Scottish football and a
myriad of other things you might consider unworthy of worry. I even worry about
not worrying. And say to my-self, ``Why aren't you worry-ing? Who gave you the
right not to worry?''
But confess I must, I've nev-er worried about the royal fam-ily and their
hangers-on. Maybe it's because I don't give a tosser about them and their
lackeys. If the word parasite has any meaning it is for this shower. Princess
Margaret has boozed her way through life, mouthing obscenities, in a golden
carriage, at our ex-pense, and those who get apo-plectic at so-called social
security scroungers say nay a word.
The suffocating snobbery surrounding royalty with its bowing and scraping
subverts our society. The democratic el-ement within our parliamenta-ry system
is called the House of Commons. Last week as the Queen's Speech was being read
in the Lords, the MPs from the Commons stood while their Lordships, unelected
to a man, and a few women, lounged on their seats looking down at them. The
upstart MPs knew their place and deferred like mad.
The Queen wore a crown dec-orated by the jewels of Henry the Eighth who when
tired of a wife had her put down or put away. A power Nicholas Soames no doubt
wishes had been pre-served for monarchs and heirs to the throne. It would save
a lot of hassle. Ta ta Di - off you go to a nunnery, that's a girl.
Like Nicholas Soames, Henry the Eighth was a man of con-spicuous consumption,
but be-fore the phrase was invented. This paragon of the Christian faith
founded the Church of England, so that he could have his way with a string of
young ladies. Among our Queen's many titles is Defender of the Faith. Whose
faith? Henry's.
The British class system with the monarch at the top has made common a term of
abuse. To call a person com-mon means that they manifest the attributes of the
common people. Tut, tut. That will nev-er do. And, of course, common ownership
is bad. Against God's design. Better by far that everything is owned by the
few, as it was in the past, and so it is being done again.
Have I no tears for Charles and Diana? Not really, but at heart I'm a softie
and have a little sympathy. They are vic-tims of a system but it's their
system. Millions more are vic-tims of this system. The prince and princess were
cocooned in wealth from birth. They know nothing of the self-esteem shat-tering
problems of youngsters who were born to fail in all things through poverty and
lack of opportunity.
Their wings were clipped be-fore they could fly, their youth-ful fancies turned
to dust as a lifetime on the dole and social security beckoned. If only a small
percentage of the ava-lanche of concern for the spoiled brats of the Windsors
were shown to the really hard-done-by youngsters in our soci-ety, then maybe,
just maybe, Britain would become a bit more civilised.
And if Diana's avowed con-cern for the common people is genuine why send her
son to Eton? Why not a local compre-hensive? Will he be allowed to move in
circles beyond a taw-dry circle of rich nincompoops? What are the chances of
him meeting and marrying a lass from Castlemilk? Zilch. He will move in the
same society as moved his father, whose mis-tress, now divorced, lives in a
house worth nearly a million quid.
Few of these people have ever earned anything. They've inherited wealth often
based on the robbery, in years long gone, of the common lands of the common
people. Or given by a king to a bastard son. Our aristocratic blue bloods, as
dis-tinct from our working-class blue noses, come from a long line of thieving
illegitimates.
They are proud of this lineage and claim governmen-tal privileges through the
House of Lords and the monar-chy because of these fore-bears. It's like Al
Capone's offspring claiming access to the US Government because Al was a
latter-day robber baron. If they had any decency they would be ashamed of their
an-cestors and seek to make amends. They could then take their place among us,
share our worries, and then legitimately make claims on our love.
In the meantime, as our press sobs for the plight of the poor Windsors, may I
remind you of the words of an old Scottish Presbyterian hymn: ``When wilt thou
save the people oh Lord of mercy when, the Peo-ple Lord, the People, not
thrones or crowns but men.''
TAGGART without Taggart is like Hamlet without the prince, or bam without the
boozle. Last week it started with a summation of the story so far. The
complexities were bewildering and made War and Peace seem like the Beano. More
people had already died than at the battles of the Somme, the Bulge, and the
Boyne, put together.
I switched off. A bad sleeper counting sheep, I don't fancy counting corpses,
trying to re-member names, who did what to whom, and what for, or who gave
somebody what for.
Now I don't want to give Taggart what for. The camera work is brilliant, the
produc-tion gave Glasgow a delightful gritty ambience which is nearer the truth
than the som-bre starkness favoured by ``re-alist'' film-makers. The script was
never trite. But Mark McManus was fundamental to the format.
It didn't matter if you totted up the people topped in the se-ries and found it
exceeded the population of Glasgow. Nobody was counting. The lived-in face of a
decent wee man confront-ing mind-boggling complex-ities, while people dropped
like flies all around, engaged the sympathy of viewers. No smart-alec dick, he
solved murders that would have beat Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot.
Without Mark it's another police series. The plots become implausible. People
start counting. If not rethought, with a new format, the series will fizzle
out. A pity, for it reached parts no other Scottish series had reached. The
Chi-nese loved it. Tongs ya bass.

HUTCHESONS' Grammar School face an exacting test on Saturday against Irish
opponents Presentation College from Bray at Auldhouse, a fixture which,
according to Magnus Brown, a former Watsonians' back-row forward and the master
in charge of rugby, will provide his young charges with a different kind of
experience.
``Irish schools rugby is more like our club rugby. They play a really hard game
and are not inclined to take prisoners,'' says Brown, who reasons that the type
of uncompromising rugby played is a result of their participation in the Irish
Schools Cup.
``The cup is a high-profile competition which, in the later stages, attracts
huge crowds and involves big money. Teams like Presentation College train five
or six days a week, such is the pressure on them,'' says Brown.
Very few leading rugby schools have opted to take part in the equivalent
Scottish competition but Brown believes that situation could soon change.
He said: ``Schools are becoming more professional about rugby. More than one
school offers sports bursaries.''
As to Hutchesons' following the example of St Aloysius' by going into the cup,
Brown has mixed feelings. ``We have a good fixture list now. It is balanced and
well-structured round the district scene. We could fall into the trap of
playing too much rugby, dropping good fixtures to play less meaningful cup
games.
``But if a sufficient number of the leading rugby schools came into the
competition, we would need to allocate certain Saturdays for cup games.
Perhaps, too, some measure of seeding would be necessary.''
A week after the match against Presentation College, Hutchesons' will play
Strathallan in what Brown expects could be his side's hardest domestic fixture
this season. Fortunately for the Glasgow school, they will be back to nearly
full strength.
``We have been badly hit by injuries, particularly to sixth-year boys,''
explains Brown. But he added: ``We were forced to play a number of younger
players, including some fourth-year boys. That, however, should be good for the
future.'' And perhaps, too, for a strong Hutchesons' team in the Scottish
Schools Cup?

KYLES Athletic, who declined to take part in this season's national premier
league, face their stiffest test to date when they re-enter mainstream
competition in the Bank of Scotland Celtic Society Cup.
Kyles lead the new South first division by six points and are unbeaten in
league games. They face Oban Camanachd, last season's South champions, who
languish just above the foot of the premier division and have yet to show any
of the form which took them to within an ace of causing a major upset in last
year's Camanachd Cup final.
Camanachd will go to Kyles as underdogs. They are weakened by the continuing
absence of Dougie MacIntyre and Dave McUish, who could be out for six weeks
with a broken hand. But they have Alex MacVicar back after a five-game ban,
although it is not clear where he will play, the defence having played
reasonably well in his absence.
Kyles are likely to persist with the ploy of playing the vastly experienced
Andy Irvine up front.
In the north, Kingussie should comfortably defeat Skye in the MacTavish Cup and
premier side Newtonmore should beat Caberfeidh at home.
The Camanachd Association say they are willing to meet Lochaber District
councillors about their proposals for the upgrading of An Aird Park in Fort
William. Council officials have gone to great lengths to explain that their
plans for national status for the field do not involve a monopoly of major
finals, as had been suggested. Association president Duncan Cameron has
welcomed this clarification.

SNOOKER
AFTER John Higgins' quickfire 9-1 win over Alain Robidoux on Tuesday, fellow
Scots Chris Small and Stephen Hendry also raced into the third round of the
Royal Liver Assurance UK Championship at Preston yesterday.
Small, the world No.62 from Edinburgh, beat Basingstoke's Mark Flowerdew 9-2.
``The money will come in handy, because my girlfriend is expecting a baby next
month,'' said the Scot, who reached the semi-finals of last season's Regal
Welsh Open. He next meets the 1993 UK winner, Ronnie O'Sullivan, for a
quarter-final place.
Hendry, 6-2 up, completed a 9-3 win last night over Anthony Hamilton, the world
No.31.
Nigel Bond reeled off five frames in a row to beat Tony Knowles 9-4. Dennis
Taylor, now 46, produced a vintage comeback from 8-5 down to win 9-8 against
world No.8, Welshman Darren Morgan.
Steve Lee, conqueror of Steve Davis, beat Neal Foulds 9-7 but 17-year-old Paul
Hunter could not follow up his upset win over Alan McManus. He led 5-3 but won
only one more frame in losing 9-6 to Welshman Wayne Jones. Results:
C Small (Sco) beat M Flowerdew (Eng) 9-2, J Parrott (Eng) beat W Thorne (Eng)

SCOT Alan Burnett's hopes of adding the Embassy IBSF World Amateur Championship
to his world under-21 title ended yesterday when he lost 5-4 in the
quarter-finals to Thailand's Rom Surin in Bristol.
The Ayrshire teenager trailed 3-1, but took the next three frames to lead 4-3.
However, the Thai knocked in a 41 break to square the match, then booked his
semi-final place by potting brown, blue, and pink in the decider.
European champion David Lilley beat Tholmas Ang of Singapore 5-0 and will play
Surin in the semi-finals.

DEFENSIVE back Dave Wilson will stop playing Cupid to keep a date with the
Scottish Claymores for next season.
There were fears that Wilson, who runs a dating agency with his girlfriend
Jodie in his hometown of Los Angeles, would stand the Claymores up. But Wilson,
who signed halfway through last season, will close his dating agency down for a
couple of months next summer to re-join the Claymores - and leave some
Californian romantics with broken hearts.
``Jodie knows how much it means to me to come to Scotland to play and she is
fully supportive,'' he said. ``I'm really looking forward to the new season.''
Head coach Jim Criner also announced that 6ft 7in defensive lineman James
Spencer will re-join the team. He was signed from Barcelona Dragons with just
three games left last season but made an instant impact.
Hockey

Great Britain fought back each time to level the score thanks to Rhona Simpson
and Susan Fraser. Results:
Argentina 1, Canada 0; Korea 3, China 1; Germany 1, South Africa 0; Holland 2,
Great Britain 2.
Latest placings - 1, Germany (8 points); 2, Korea (7); 3, Argentina (7); 4,

GLASGOW Under-21s, who open their district campaign against South next
Wednesday, just edged a testing match at Braidholm last night.
The students led 11-6 at half-time through a try by full back Richard Bailes
and two penalties by Dundee centre Neil Paterson against two penalties by
Martin Hose.
Two tries by winger Geoff Caldwell and a conversion and penalty by Hose put
Glasgow into the lead but two penalties by Paterson and a drop goal by
Edinburgh centre James How almost produced victory for the students.

over Milan with his 26 points in perhaps the worst Heineken European Clubs'
Championship match so far.
He landed eight penalties and converted the only try - from David Manley - as
negative play from both sides ruined the Pool C game. Milan had flanker Massimo
Giovanelli sent off for butting in 67 minutes, after he had been warned in the
first half.

SWIMMING
ABERDEEN Swimming Club's refusal to join a new development initiative within
the city has put it on a collision course with the Scottish association.
Following the decision to stay independent, the club has been informed that it
will be barred from using the Bon Accord pool, thereby losing half its training
time.
Club officials, parents, and swimmers are upset, and Martyn Woodroffe,
Scotland's director of swimming, faces a hard time at a specially convened
meeting in Aberdeen this evening.
``We'll listen to what he has to say, but there are a lot of questions to be
answered,'' said Eileen Adams, head coach of an Aberdeen club that won this
year's Scottish age-group championship and finished top Scottish club at the
recent Cumbernauld international meet.
``It is a case of joining the scheme or being squeezed out. Bon Accord is the
best facility and, who knows, perhaps the next move will be to pull the plug on
us using the school pools.''
The new scheme is a partnership involving the SASA, City of Aberdeen Council,
and the Scottish Sports Council, and a head coach, Alastair Johnson, assistant
at Stockport Metro, has been appointed to start the 25,000 plus post on 11
December.
Adams contends that instead of evicting Aberdeen, the SASA should have provided
assistance to one of the few prospering clubs. ``We're easily among the top six
in Scotland and we're very happy with what we've got,'' Adams said.

BOXING
MIKE Tyson's postponed clash with Buster Mathis Jr will take place in Atlantic
City on December 16 - even though promoter Don King is barred from staging
shows in New Jersey because of the recent court action against him.
Tyson, scheduled to fight Frank Bruno for the WBC title in Las Vegas on March
16, has happy memories of the Convention Centre, where he scored first-round
victories over Michael Spinks and Carl Williams. He also beat Tyrell Biggs
there and stopped Larry Holmes.
The fight against Mathis was scheduled for November 4, but the fight was
postponed when Tyson damaged his right thumb.

<HEADLINE>Feed costs could reach new highs warns UKASTA</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT ROSS Farming Editor</BYLINE>

<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975241338</RECORDNO>

BRITISH livestock producers could be placed under unprecedented pressure by
increased feed costs over the next few months, it has been claimed.
The United Kingdom Agricultural Supply Trade Association fears price rises are
inevitable as world markets for grain and proteins tighten. UKASTA director
general Jim Reed said: ``Experts in the farming and feedstuffs industries can
already foresee most ration prices having to rise by at least another 15% over
the winter, simply to absorb the cost increases already hitting us, let alone
any more which may be in the pipeline.
``UK and European grain prices are already at a 20-year high, dragged up by a
world market shorter of cereals than many of us can ever remember,'' he said.
Mr Reed pointed out that protein prices were now following a sharp upward
trend, with high quality, home-produced rape seed meal in particularly strong
demand due to the very high price of imported alternatives. ``Inevitably this
has driven up the price of all other ingredients in sympathy,'' he added.
Clear reasons for the upward trend had been identified, he said. US soya
production was well below last year's level, with prices approaching 20% more.
World fish meal supplies were also down and prices were fully 30% higher.
Steadily rising demand for vegetable oils and protein meals in developing
countries was helping to push protein prices very much higher across the board.
``Our concern has to date been for the hard-pressed pig and poultry producers,
but we must now recognise that the effects will also be severe for dairy, beef
and sheep producers,'' Mr Reed said.
``No livestock sector will be immune from the cost-push effect. Unfortunately,
buyers of livestock products are largely unaware of these world events which
will mean a much higher cost for feeding animals.''
UKASTA noted the trend in rising raw material prices earlier this year and
lobbied for the European Commission to reduce set-aside sharply and to manage
European markets to restrain prices as far as possible. The cautious measures
taken so far had had little effect, Mr Reed said.
The whole industry should now be lobbying Brussels to renew its efforts, he
added. UKASTA deputy president Pat Lake would be leading a delegation to meet
commission officials to explore the scope for further action to safeguard the
livestock industries throughout Europe.

MANCHESTER was the city of celebration last night, with United narrowing the
gap at the top of the Premiership to three points, while City moved off the
bottom of the table.
Brian McClair inspired United's 4-0 win at Coventry that plunged Ron Atkinson's
side to the foot of the division. The Scot struck twice, with Denis Irwin
opening the scoring and David Beckham putting the match beyond the home side.
The victory was a boost to United's city neighbours, who took full advantage by
snatching a last-gasp 1-0 win over Wimbledon. Niall Quinn netted his first
league strike of the campaign with only a minute left after Wimbledon had
frustrated their fellow strugglers all night.
Bolton missed out on their first away point in the Premiership when Chelsea won
3-2 at Stamford Bridge. The visitors led after 10 minutes but David Lee
equalised five minutes later and Gareth Hall put Glenn Hoddle's side in front
just before the hour.
Scott Green looked to have secured a point for Wanderers after 68 minutes but
Newton's header kept the pressure on the Burnden Park management team of Roy
McFarland and Colin Todd.
q AC MILAN coach Fabio Capello is thinking of switching clubs next year after
five seasons that made the Italian side the leading lights in Europe.
Capello claims that he has been offered a two-year extension by Milan, the
Serie A leaders, but was unhappy with certain clauses. He said he had until
April 30 to make up his mind.
Speculation has been mounting that the club was hunting for a replacement and
had several candidates in mind, including Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi.
q COLOMBIAN defender Albeiro Pico Hernandez, of Club Envigado, was shot dead by
unidentified gumen yesterday in the northwest city of Medellin.
The gunmen is said to have shot seven rounds into 23-year-old Pico as he was
leaving his home for an early-morning training session.

IT became one of those commonplaces, didn't it, to say how impossible it was to
read the terrible, sinister stories that slithered daily from Court No 3 at
Winchester?
To flinch from reading about forms of cruelty so malign, the imagination
whimpered and recoiled and sought a way to switch off. But we can never unknow
things. Even when the knowledge seeping in is dreadful, we can't wipe it from
our minds.
Secrets pull at us like an undertow. Go back to the beginning. Bodies in the
cellar, bodies in the garden, bodies in a field, all on a wet weekday in
Gloucester. A drama unfolding across the road, over the back, round the corner,
so they came with their Thermos flasks of sweet, weak tea and egg sandwiches.
They came carrying babies and cameras, in cars, on buses, on scuffing,
scurrying feet, they came, with the message bags and folding picnic seats. They
came to gawp.
Remember Shain, the unemployed builder who lived across the street and sold
sloppy joes printed with the legend: Freddy's Back, Nightmare on Cromwell
Street. Just #4.50 a time.
Sally, in the bedsit next door, hawking a cup of Nescafe for 89p: Ali Hussan
selling the rights to his churned-up back-green to the highest bidder for #100
to film police digging up the garden.
In Japan they chewed over their sukiyaki and hourly reports of the latest bin
bag of bones beamed by satellite from their excitable man on the spot. In
France they saw the journalist, rain spitting on her suede jacket, gesturing
with an elegant arm at the green windows of La Maison des Horreurs.
The local vicar wondering if the narrow house was evil. The young mother who
took her toddler with wondering eyes on two buses to reach Cromwell Street to
show her the sort of world she would inherit. The pensioners, grabbing each
other's arms, reciting revulsion and collapsing in giggles . . . Oooh yes but
we couldn't stay away could we Betty? We were jes' curious like.
What is this about, we always ask. After the plane crash on the motorway as
police clear sightseers to let rescuers reach the dying. After Lockerbie when
picnickers clogged up rural lanes . . .
Vicarious grief? Ghoulism? Schadenfreude? Some or all of these? But curiosity
is an insistent and maddeningly human quality. There were 21 million curious
subjects riveted to a screen to watch the new Queen of Hearts on Monday. Me too.
For several weeks in Winchester's Court No 3 we have heard about cruelty and
horror so unimaginable we want to turn away. But even when you do, it's lodged
in there. There was life before the trial, and life after, and the before is
blinder and purer.
We need to know what went on at 25 Cromwell Street. A recurring theme of the
trial was the consequence of wilful amnesia. Lodgers who looked away. Families
who didn't know or want to know what daughters were doing, neighbours who heard
terrible things but chose not to listen.
So when we say we could not read about the trial because it was so disturbing,
that is why we should have read about it.
One of its effects may be that the cultural representation of violence or
sexual abuse becomes queasily dodgy territory. Now the images of
sado-masochism, which in mild and titillating form are all around, in
magazines, in films, on television, have moved nearer to the torture chamber.
On the other side from the Queen of Hearts on Monday was Cracker: Fitz, with
his cruel intelligence, his curling self-disgust imprisoned in malodorous bulk,
a bloated creature of the darkness.
Cracker with the huge audiences and the second-highest number of complaints for
its portrayal of torn flesh, and serial murder and chisels shoved up
prostitutes and blood and anguish seeming real. How strange we are that we
entertain ourselves with what we fear the most.
Some believe such ``filth'' harms, that fantasy and fiction haemorrhage into
real life. That fiction is responsible for fact. But is cause and effect ever
so simple? People are brutalised by a collison of causes. As we cannot cure bad
marriages by making divorce more painful, so we cannot legislate away horror by
censoring its image.
There used to be things in our society we never knew about, and so had no
vocabulary for. In the past decade we have had to confront hidden issues such
as child sex abuse, the violence within many marriages: should we expect the
real world to be sealed off from the world of imagination? We can't just look
away. We know already. Closing the book, switching off the film, turning over
the page is not an option. We can't unknow any longer.

<HEADLINE>She will hang herself, says brother</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE brother of Rosemary West said yesterday: ``I fear she will hang herself
like Fred.''
Graham Letts said: ``I don't think she will be able to cope. I sure she will
try and do the same as Fred did and hang herself.
``I think she will be in tremendous shock. I know she thought she was going to
get off.
``She was really convinced she was going to walk away from this.
``She is a tough person but the thought of being in prison will be more than
she can cope with.
``I really fear she will try and kill herself.
On the verdict, he added: ``We were prepared for it, but it has still come as a
tremendous shock.
``I tried to prepare the children for the worst - but how on earth can you
prepare for something like this.
``There was always a fear that she would be found guilty and now it has
happened we will have to try and go away and rebuild or lives.''
The magistrate who fined Rosemary and Fred West for a brutal sex attack on a
teenager 22 years ago said yesterday: ``My conscience is clear.''
Mr John Smith, 86, was chairman of the bench when the Wests appeared before
Gloucester Magistrates charged with stripping, gagging, and indecently
assaulting lodger Carol Raine in 1973.
Just minutes after yesterday's conviction, he said: ``I certainly don't think I
was too lenient.
``I have nothing on my conscience whatsoever. I have nothing further to say.''
A witness in trial called for the death sentence for serial murderers and said
she would happily act as executioner of the woman who tormented her.
Kathryn Halliday, 37, who told the Winchester trial jury she was subjected to
``violent and aggressive'' lesbian sex by West, said: ``I would personally
volunteer to press the button on the electric chair or flick the switch to hang
her.
``That is what she deserves, that is what would give me most pleasure.''
Ms Halliday said she was ``absolutely delighted'' with Rosemary West's fate.
``At one stage we began to fear that she may get off on some of the murders,
but she has got what she deserves.
``I have always said there was a pact between Frederick and Rose West and I
believe there are still many more bodies to be found.''
Tory MP Barry Porter called on Home Secretary Michael Howard to give a pledge
that he would never contemplate the release of Rosemary West from prison.
Mr Porter, MP for South Wirral, said: ``It is simply beyond belief that any
Home Secretary, present or future, could even contemplate the possibility of
ever freeing her.''
Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP for Dover, said: ``The Home Secretary must now
give an undertaking that, within the powers he possesses, he would never allow
her to be released.
``Her crimes were so appalling that this is certainly a case where capital
punishment would be appropriate. However, we need to be assured that she will
remain in prison for the rest of her natural life, never to savour freedom
again.''
Wests' neighbours spoke of their relief at the verdicts.
Ernest and Olive Miles are the longest remaining residents at Cromwell Street
where number 25 stands derelict and boarded up.
Mrs Miles, 76, who has lived with her husband at number 45 for 48 years, said
the guilty verdicts were the right ones.
``What happened there within the walls of number 25 was the work of the devil -
the work of Satan,'' said Olive.
``No-one will ever know whether she was forced into it by her husband or not,
but guilty was the only verdict that the jury could have reached.''
Husband Ernest, 79, called for Rosemary West to be hanged.
``Prison's not good enough for her. She deserves all she gets for what she put
those innocent young women and girls through. How could any woman be party to
the murder of her own daughter and her little step-daughter?
``They should hang her in the centre of Gloucester - most local people would
agree with me and probably enjoy the spectacle,'' he said.
Dave Limbrick, 31, who lives at number 57, said: ``She must have known what was
going on under her own roof.
``I had met Fred West on the street a number of times. He seemed a bit thick
and was always grinning with a stupid smile on his face.
``We just thought he was happy about life in general, but we all know now it
was probably something far more sinister.''
He added: ``No-one noticed anything out of the ordinary. There were no real
clues to what was going on. Fred was always doing jobs for other people so it
didn't seem strange that he was always digging or doing jobs on the house.''
Cathy Barry, 20, is a relative newcomer to Cromwell Street.
The media studies student who lives at number 19 was well aware she was moving
to an infamous road but later found out that her bedroom was built by Fred West.
She said: ``My mother told me not to read the papers during the trial as she
thought it would frighten me, but I'm not really bothered. The bodies are all
gone now and life has to go on.
``You hear a lot about what the Wests were like. They seem to be weird but
no-one picked up on any clues.''
Miss Barry added that she and around a dozen other residents of Cromwell Street
had been paid to appear on ITV's The Time The Place discussion programme today
to describe what life is like living on Cromwell Street.
She said: ``Some people say they are tired of all the attention, but most love
it really.''
Last night, the wilting remains of bouquets of flowers laid in tribute to the
victims were on display outside number 25.
The doors and windows of semi-detached house were boarded up and the gate to
the back garden was locked to deter sightseers.
As darkness fell and people returned to their cars, television crews lit up the
neighbourhood with powerful lights.
Locals jeered at camera crews as they filmed the empty house - complete with a
freshly painted stripe of whitewash to cover obscene graffiti that has appeared
during the trial.
The infamous ``25 Cromwell Street'' iron sign that became synonymous with the
killings had been seized during the course of the police investigation.
Police have tried to ward off souvenir hunters.
Meanwhile, councillors and Gloucester's city mayor spoke of the notoriety that
the Wests' depravity had brought on the cathedral city.
Mayor Rose Workman said: ``We are all shocked and the people of Gloucester will
try their best now to get themselves back to what they were doing before.''
Continuing speculation over the presence of more bodies in the area would no
doubt continue to keep the city in the limelight, but Mrs Workman said: ``All
over the country parents who have had children leave home and who haven't heard
from them since must be wondering whether their children are still alive.
``I urge them if they are still alive, please ring home to let them know
they're OK.''
Despite the ghoulish reputation the city may have acquired during the West
chapter, tourist boss Philip Cooke said there had been no change in the number
of visitors.
One lesson for the future might be learned. A children's charity said adults
must learn to listen to children when they give out signals that there is
something wrong within their family.
Valerie Howarth, executive director of Childline, said it should not be
forgotten that the West murders only came to light after a remark by a child to
a Gloucestershire social worker who took it seriously and alerted police.
``The lesson for us all is that, no matter how fantastic a child's story may
seem, children should be listened to when they give out signals that there is
something very wrong in their families,'' said Mrs Howarth.
She was really convinced she was going to walk away from this. She is a tough
person but the thought of being in prison will be more than she can cope with

AN English Tory MP claimed yesterday that he and his family had been
``threatened'' with a visit by the leader of Monklands District Council,
Councillor Jim Brooks, after giving evidence at the government inquiry into
alleged corruption at the Labour-controlled authority.
Speaking at Question Time in the Commons yesterday, Mr David Shaw - one of the
strongest critics of the council - used parliamentary privilege when he told
the House: ``I have just come back from giving evidence to the Monklands
inquiry this morning in Scotland.
``On my departing from the inquiry, I was given the usual threat by the leader
of the council, who insisted on threatening to visit myself and my family.''
Mr Shaw, who represents Dover, pressed Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth: ``Do
you consider that these sort of people should be in charge of councils in
Scotland, and do you not think the Labour Party has a lot to answer for on the
failings of local government in Scotland?''
Mr Forsyth replied: ``I am sure you will understand why I am not in a position
to comment on the remarks which you have made.''
But he added, ``in defence of the Labour Party'', that he was sure it was as
anxious as Tories ``to ensure the highest standards of conduct in local
government''.
Mr Brooks last night denied that he had in any way threatened Mr Shaw and
claimed the MP had made the allegation because he did not like being called
``Davie''.
He said: ``There is no way I threatened him. I was just teasing him. I said we
would go down to his area to see how good it was because he is up here all the
time. I think he's a silly man.''
The ruling Labour group on Monklands District Council was suspended in June by
party leader Tony Blair following allegations of ``jobs for the boys'',
nepotism, and sectarian discrimination.
For the Opposition, Mr John McAllion protested in the House of Commons that
``ill-tempered, ill-informed, and inaccurate attacks on elected Scottish
councils by the likes of Mr Shaw merely serve to weaken an already very weak
Government case in Scotland, particularly when he in Scotland this morning
admitted that his allegations were based upon circumstantial evidence and
anonymous correspondence''.
A confrontation between Mr Brooks and Mr Shaw occurred in a small foyer outside
the inquiry room at the council headquarters in Coatbridge after Mr Shaw had
given evidence, in which he described Monklands as the most corrupt local
authority in Britain.
Mr Brooks got up from the public seats and walked briskly out of the chamber
before asking Mr Shaw if he had been paid to raise questions on Monklands in
the House of Commons.
Mr Shaw replied: ``No, I was not. Were you paid?''
Mr Brooks then said he and several other councillors would be visiting Mr
Shaw's Dover constituency at the New Year.
Mr Shaw said: ``Remember to bring your company books.''
Afterwards, Mr Brooks said he only wanted to ask Mr Shaw if he had accepted
money to raise questions in the House of Commons ``like some of his Tory
colleagues''.
He added that he and other councillors would be visiting the MP's constituency
at New Year for ``a party''.
Mr Brooks was not available later to comment on Mr Shaw's ``threat'' claims
made in the House of Commons.
Mr Shaw admitted at the inquiry that he had no firm evidence involving
individual cases of nepotism but said there was an ``overwhelming weight'' of
circumstantial evidence which in itself was enough to condemn the council.
His own investigation had uncovered more than 20 cases of councillors'
relatives in jobs at Monklands.
He also admitted that the high profile of two local Labour MPs - the late
Labour leader John Smith (Monklands East) and the then Shadow Scots Secretary
Tom Clarke (Monklands West) - was a factor in his constant attacks on the
authority.
The inquiry before Mr William Nimmo Smith, QC, continues.
q A controversial inquiry into allegations against the council by Professor
Robert Black, whose findings were released in June, was said last night to have
cost less than half the #50,000 the council said would be available.
Mr Archie Strang, the council's director of finance, said a total of #23,000
had been paid for the report, adding that although costs had been on public
display, he had received no comments.
Mr Strang said: ``I do not know how much these things should cost. I'm not in a
position to say it was cheap or expensive.''

<HEADLINE>Chancellor taunts Labour as he pledges Budget aimed at a recovery `that is for keeps' Clarke and Brown in tax battle</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By BENEDICT BROGAN Political Reporter</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke yesterday set out the economic principles that will
define his Budget next week and ``make Britain the enterprise centre of
Europe'' by reiterating his target of a 20p standard rate of tax.
Unable to give details of a Budget that is expected to include vote-winning tax
cuts, Mr Clarke concentrated on attacking Labour. He described Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown's plan to reduce the lowest rate of tax to 10p as
``bizarre and ill-judged.''
The Tories were committed to reducing borrowing to zero and the share of public
expenditure to below 40% of Gross Domestic Product, he said, and to keeping
inflation below a target of 2.5%.
The last day of the Queen's Speech debate turned into a showdown between Mr
Clarke and Mr Brown. The two were evenly matched, Mr Brown's quick-fire wit
against Mr Clarke's bar-room bluster.
Mr Clarke accused Labour of producing light entertainment rather than policies
of its own. At one point, he implored someone - anyone - on the Labour benches
to stand and explain Labour's policy on inflation, interest rates and tax.
``Everybody I meet in the Rose and Crown tells me what they want me to do with
the Budget. (Mr Brown) is the only man . . . with no advice,'' he said. ``It's
not an impossible question on the eve of the Budget to ask the Labour Party
what do they think the basic rate of tax should be,'' he said.
By contrast, he said, he would introduce a Budget ``dedicated to making this
country the enterprise centre of Europe'' based on ``the clear consistent
policies we have had in place for delivering a recovery that is for keeps and
which will increase living standards for families year after year.''
However Mr Brown said nothing the Government could do in the Budget would
restore the 21 consecutive tax increases imposed since the 1992 election.
``This is the Tory strategy to try to win the people of this country - but a
tax cut every five years can never make up for the 21 tax rises in the years
between,'' he said.
Mr Clarke said the only policies Labour had were to introduce a minimum wage
and sign up for the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty on employment
legislation. These would ``drive unemployment up and destroy jobs.''
Mr Brown said the Government would be judged on its claim, made by Mr Major on
Tuesday, that tax increases had been introduced to ``protect people who were
vulnerable. Tell that to the pensioners, the weakest and frailest in the
country who had VAT rises imposed upon them by the Government.''
Mr Malcolm Bruce, for the Liberal Democrats, said: ``There was a time when
Government Ministers on the Tory side took pride in the fact that they were the
sound financial managers of the economy.
``But they no longer listen to their own advice because the General Election is
pressing hard down upon them and good economic management is less important
than kidding the voters that you can somehow deliver them a miracle.''
The Government's legislative programme for the last full session of Parliament
before the General Election was later backed when Labour's attack on the Tories
over their stewardship of the economy was defeated by 298 votes to 271, a
Government majority of 27.
q Twenty Labour MPs want the rich to pay more tax, according to a new survey. A
higher income tax rate should be imposed on the top 10% of taxpayers, the MPs
said in a survey published in today's edition of the left-wing Tribune
newspaper.
q A new opinion poll shows another increase in Labour's huge lead over the
Tories. The Mori poll in the Times today puts the Tories on 26% (compared with
27% at the end of October), with Labour remaining on 56% , a lead of 30 points.
The Liberal Democrats are on 14%, one point higher than a month ago.

<HEADLINE>Firm refuses to insure bull-bar vehicles</HEADLINE>

MOTORING organisations in Scotland last night welcomed an insurance company's
decision to stop offering cover for vehicles fitted with bull bars.
The decision, announced yesterday by CGA Direct, makes it the first in Britain
to take a hardline stance against the bars, which are fitted to many off-road
vehicles used solely for town driving.
A number of people have been killed or seriously injured in accidents involving
vehicles fitted with the accessories
CGA, which is based in Sussex and underwrites policies on behalf of Ganminster,
a French-owned company, said there were social and financial reasons behind its
decision.
Mr Paul Purdy, CGA's marketing director, said: ``There is conclusive evidence
that they increase the chance of injury and death to pedestrians and other
motorists.
``The bars do more damage to other vehicles in collisions, so claims involving
cars fitted with bull bars tend to be higher.''
Ms Sue Nicholson, of the RAC in Scotland, said: ``We would support anything
which encourages the removal of bull bars fitted only for cosmetic reasons.''
The AA also gave the announcement a broad welcome. A spokeswoman said: ``We do
not believe that drivers with existing bars should be punished but we are in
favour of them being phased out.''
Welsh MP Paul Flynn, who has been campaigning against the bars, said: ``This is
a major step forward in the cause of safety on our roads. Hopefully, this will
be the catalyst which will force other insurance companies to follow suit.
``These are bully bars worn by macho owners which transform their vehicles into
killing machines. They are totally cosmetic and have no place in our towns.''
The Association of British Insurers said it would not oppose new legislation,
but was not campaigning for change.

WHEN the Chancellor of the Exchequer drops into the saloon bar of the Rose and
Crown, he told us yesterday, he is bombarded not so much with cries of
``What'll you have, Ken'' as with suggestions about what he should put in his
Budget.
A convivial soul who likes his pint and a good cigar, Mr Clarke cannot help
noticing this taciturn chap who is noted for never joining in with suggestions
of his own. ``It's as if he thinks that talking about economic policy and
taxation policy is not allowed in polite company,'' Ken chortled.
This tall, dark, taciturn figure turned out to be the Shadow Chancellor, Mr
Gordon Brown, who, Mr Clarke surmised, could be a Trappist monk. The
improbability of a Trappist monk regularly frequenting the Chancellor's
hostelry or, indeed, representing Dunfermline East in the Commons, indicated
this was a mere flight of fancy, something which Mr Clarke, who never seems
oppressed by the number-crunching aspects of his job, is readier to indulge in
than most of his predecessors.
Mr Brown might observe that this is because the Chancellor is not a details
man. Mr Brown is. An admission in a Government White Paper that Britain has
slipped from 13th to 18th in the world prosperity league, is snapped up, but
the Shadow Chancellor can delve much deeper than that.
No privatised industry chief can hope to escape Mr Brown and his research
postulants discovering how much his generous pension arrangements are actually
going to cost the company, the shareholders, and the taxpayer.
The Shadow Chancellor lugs into the Chamber an impressive array of files from
which might be plucked a statistic troublesome to the Government or a speech by
the Chancellor when he was something else entirely, advocating policies with
which he either does not now agree or, at least, given the current climate of
the Conservative Party, does not wish to say he agrees.
However, Mr Clarke is resilient and not easily abashed. ``I am one of the last
survivors of the long march,'' he declared proudly. On the scenario being
painted by Mr Brown, this was a Tory hike from being the party of One Nation to
the provider of goodies for small selfish interest groups.
For the Shadow Chancellor is, and was yesterday, quite eloquent about many
things. Where he turns taciturn is when it comes to diving into one of the
folders and producing a taxation policy.
One minute he is denouncing the high level of unemployment, Government waste
and totting up ``the bills of economic failure'' with the fervour of a
revivalist preacher. But, ask ``Is current borrowing, current spending, current
interest rates too high, too low, or about right?'' and, without so much as a
clap of thunder, the preacher has metamorphosed into a Trappist monk devoted to
his vow of silence.
Mr Clarke asked the questions, achieved the metamorphosis, then read out the
favourable economic statistics about which Mr Brown had adopted the Trappist
approach. In a forlorn bid to try to make the Shadow Chancellor feel small, he
then praised the Liberal Democrats. They have the courage of their convictions.
They produced an alternative Budget for all to see and analyse. ``They're not
in danger of becoming the next Government,'' Mr Brown might have thought.
Challenged by Mr Peter Hain (Neath - Lab.) to commit himself to producing a
detailed alternative Budget if he became Shadow Chancellor in a year or two, Mr
Clarke behaved like the man in the saloon bar who realises it's his round next
and made an excuse for moving elsewhere.

<HEADLINE>Clinton set to delay visit to Britain and Ireland</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975241349</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is almost certain to postpone by one day the start of
his planned trip to Britain, Ulster and the Republic of Ireland next week, it
emerged last night.
The delay will enable him to court American support to send US military
personnel to join the Nato peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
This is bound to lead to a major re-scheduling of the President's engagements
which include an address to both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday.
Downing Street said last night it ``entirely understood'' the reason behind the
delay.
There have been hopes that President Clinton can use his influence to try to
end the deadlock in the Ulster peace process.
He is now expected to curtail his visit to Ireland, visiting only Dublin after
engagements in Northern Ireland and Britain and calling off a schedule of
events in the west of Ireland.
He will leave Ireland early to visit US troops based in Germany, who are facing
duty in Bosnia.
Meanwhile, last night Irish Prime Minister John Bruton criticised Northern
Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew for displaying ``immutability'' in a
speech on the peace process.
Mr Bruton, currently caught up in negotiations with Mr Major aimed at resolving
the impasse, also said that risks had to be taken to overcome the current
problems.
His comments came after Sir Patrick, speaking at Londonderry, repeated
Britain's demands for IRA moves towards decommissioning its weapons ahead of
Sinn Fein's entry into all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
Mr Bruton said: ``If we are going to move forward, we must recognise the need
for compromise. You cannot lay down a set, immutable position - as I feel Sir
Patrick was laying down today - and expect there are going to be compromises.''
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said that the peace process semed to be in
a state of ``stalemate.'' He did not think the current approach of the British
and Irish governments was ``going to go anywhere.''
Mr Trimble suggested that, instead, a Northern Ireland assembly should be set
up and elections held quickly as they would ``clear the air.''
He believed they would see the eclipse of some of the smaller groups that had
sprung up since the process began but which had, he thought, little popular
support. They also would show whether there was any mandate in Northern Ireland
for significant change in the present constitutional arrangements.
Elections also would force Sinn Fein-IRA to put forward more detailed policies
which could be scrutinised and questioned and tested by the voters. Mr Trimble
said: ``We know the private armies are still there.''

EUROPE is making economic progress towards a single currency but there is still
much room for improvement, according to three reports published yesterday.
Two of the reports - from the European Commission - confirmed Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke's claims that the British economy is on track to meet the
conditions for joining a single currency as laid down in the Maastricht treaty.
Britain has the right to remain outside a single currency if it wishes.
More significantly, the report - published yesterday by EU finance commissioner
Yves-Thibault de Silguy - points to progress by the French in meeting the
so-called Maastricht convergence criteria for monetary union. It suggests
France is likely to meet targets on debt as a percentage of gross domestic
product (GDP), one of the most important criteria.
French participation in the birth of a single currency is seen as critical to
the success of the venture, which is expected to be launched by an exclusive
group of EU member states with the strongest currencies.
Under the Maastricht timetable for a single currency in 1997, the EU member
states must make their economies converge in areas including inflation,
interest rates, currency stability, debt, and government deficits.
Mr de Silguy, reporting progress towards the single currency as positive, said:
``The situation is largely satisfactory as far as inflation and interest rates
are concerned but much less so regarding budgetary performance.''

COUNCIL workers and locals clashed yesterday over tree felling in a Glasgow
park.
Protesters tried to stop the workers cutting down more than 20 trees which line
Govanhill Park.
The council's environment department said they had Dutch elm disease.
However, the residents claim it is to enable the Glasgow District parks and
recreation department to make way for a park development.
Ms Alice Caldwell, 47, yesterday confronted the council workers. ``I asked them
what they were doing and when they told me I informed them there was no way
they were going ahead with it,'' she said. ``I just stood in the way so they
couldn't go near it.''
She added: ``They only got away with cutting down a sapling earlier because
no-one noticed them doing it.''
Pensioner Sheila Thaw, from Copelaw Street in 1951, said: ``I'm really angry
about the way we've been treated by the council.
``If the council get their way there'll be none left. It's disgraceful.''
The council's environment manager, Mr Brian Atkinson, denied they were cutting
down healthy trees.
He said: ``Nineteen trees will be removed. All are either at different stages
of Dutch elm disease, or have come to end of their lives.
``We have had extensive consultation with community groups concerning our plans
and have indicated right from the beginning that trees would be removed.''

SCOTLAND'S political parties were at war yesterday as the argument over
devolution dominated Scottish Question Time in the Commons.
At a Westminster news briefing, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said that he
had sat down with his officials within a week of taking office and had spent
most of the summer working on the matter.
He gave away few details of what his proposals - to be announced next Thursday,
St Andrew's Day - will contain, but he confirmed that he had contacted Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson over a plan to hold 12 sessions of the
Scottish Grand Committee at different locations in Scotland between now and
June of next year.
Mr Forsyth also praised the input of the Prime Minister to the debate on
Scotland's future. He said: ``People must wait and see, but the proposals are
my best shot, the best we can do. We will never have proposals which will
damage the Union and harm Scots by making them pay more tax.''
He acknowledged that the Government had to respond to the feeling of the people
of Scotland that they wanted more say in their own affairs, and that the
accountability of the Government north of the Border had to be improved.
``I started with a clean sheet of paper and asked officials to look at all the
options on how we can improve the governance of Scotland,'' he said. ``The
Prime Minister is passionate about the Union, and is very concerned that we
take proper account of the Scottish dimension.
``He has been a very doughty and stong ally. Without him I doubt if we could
have agreed on the proposals I will announce next week.''
In the Commons, Mr Forsyth insisted that Scotland got a good deal from its
Union with England as he resisted demands for a separate parliament. He said
spending per head was currently running at #4185 a year, 21% higher than for
England.
Mr Robertson accused him of using ``smears, distortions and downright lies'' to
oppose devolution.''
Despite this, he claimed, there had been a decisive swing towards the idea of a
devolved Scottish parliament among the business community - a reference to the
recent survey conducted by the Fraser of Allander Institute for the Scottish
Chambers of Commerce.
Mr Robertson said: ``When are you going to recognise you have got it wrong and
business opinion now realises devolution will be good for Scotland, for Britain
and for British business?''
Mr Harry Greenway (Ealing North - Con.) said it was naive of Labour and the
Liberal Democrats to expect the high level of funding for Scotland to continue.
Replying, Mr Forsyth poured scorn on claims that a Scottish parliament could
use its powers under a ``tartan tax'' to lower taxation to below the level it
was in England.
For the Liberal Democrats, former party leader Sir David Steel (Tweeddale,
Ettrick and Lauderdale) referred to the recent elections in the devolved region
of Catalonia in Spain and asked: ``Why is it that what is possible and welcome
in Spain is impossible in the United Kingdom?''
Mr Forsyth turned the question round to Canada and asked Sir David: ``In
Canada, the argument was that by going for devolution they would prevent
separatism and that ended in division and disruption. The lesson of Canada is
that you feed the crocodile and one day you get eaten.''
For the SNP, party leader Alex Salmond challenged Mr Forsyth on inward
investment, and he said last night: ``While the other parties argue about
variations on the Union and tinkering with the Scottish Grand Committee, we
have a clear stand on Scotland's future. The tide of opinion appears to be
moving in our direction.''
q Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch claimed at Westminster
yesterday that council reorganisation would allow many of Scotland's new local
authorities to reduce local tax bills next year if they maintained current
spending levels.
However, council leaders have warned Ministers that they face such grave
financial problems as a result of Government policies that council tax levels
are likely to rise significantly while services may also have to be cut.
Mr Kynoch was announcing Scottish Office agreement to Cosla proposals for a
self-financing three year transitional scheme to deal with mismatches over the
allocation of funding thrown up by the break-up of the large regional councils.

THE future of 350 manufacturing jobs at the Harper-Collins book plant in
Glasgow looked increasingly insecure last night after staff rejected a proposed
pay cut of about 25%.
Officials of the Graphical, Paper and Media Union, which represents more than
300 of the workers, said its members had unanimously thrown out the proposal.
The reduction in salaries had been put forward by the prospective owner of the
manufacturing arm of the Bishopbriggs plant, Mr Chris Hardie, who currently
owns a printing company in Berwick.
He is thought to have claimed that the huge cut is a necessary part of a
buy-out package backed by the Bank of Scotland. The plant has made losses of
more than #10m in the past five years.
However, Mr David Munro, Scottish branch secretary of GPMU, said yesterday:
``The ball is back in their court.
``We would expect a new owner to observe the legislation governing transfer of
engagements, which is there to protect existing wages and conditions.''
Mr Hardie was not available for comment.

MORE people are moving to Scotland, according to Government figures released
last night. Since 1988, there has been a net gain of 7000 a year in Scotland's
population. Last year, the migration of people to Scotland from elsewhere in
the UK was 47,000.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said: ``People are coming
in increasing numbers to Scotland in recognition of the standard of living and
quality of life the country offers.''
THE Government promised yesterday to do all in its power to improve safety
standards on cross-channel ferries - but refused to set a time limit on how
long vessels must stay afloat after an accident. However, as the Department of
Transport published its response to a Commons committee's report into ferry
safety, Transport Secretary Sir George Young said the Government accepted the
broad thrust of the committee's recommendations.
LEADER of the House Tony Newton announced that the Commons Christmas recess
will be from Wednesday, December 20, to Tuesday, January 9,

THE four youngest children of the West family are living under new identities
in foster homes far removed from Gloucester.
The programme for caring for them is currently costing around #250,000 a year.
The three girls and a boy - now aged between 12 and 17 - have been given new
names to protect them from the publicity surrounding their parents' infamy.
They are all with foster families at unknown locations outside Gloucestershire.
Another daughter of the West family, now aged 17, is believed to be living with
relatives in Gloucestershire. She successfully applied to have the care order
on her lifted a few months before her mother's trial at Winchester Crown Court.
All the children were placed in care after allegations were made against their
parents in August 1992.
The four still in care are expected to remain there until they are 18.
The fathers of two of the girls are unknown, but Fred West was the father of
the others in care.
Gloucestershire County Council's social services department is footing the
annual bill of around #250,000 a year for the West children, mainly in the
costs of fostering and the special back-up services.
The children are also understood to be receiving special counselling which is
likely to continue for some considerable time - for some, possibly all their
lives.
A High Court Family Division order prevents the media from publishing details
of the children's new homes or making any approaches about their care.
In making a previous order, Mr Justice Thorpe said that he regarded two of the
children as ``extremely vulnerable''. They had been affected by the case and
its publicity, he said.
Meanwhile, their mother's days in prison will be divided between 12 hours
locked in her cell and a routine of exercise, education, and work activities.
That is the basic daily regime of Durham jail's H wing, widely known as ``She
wing'', where West can expect to spend most of the rest of her life.
There are currently 44 inmates, Moors murderer Myra Hindley is the best-known,
in Britain's only unit for long-term women convicts.

PLANS to ensure that a Scottish parliament adopts a consensus approach and does
not slip back into the ``childish confrontation'' of Westminster were unveiled
yesterday by a Labour think tank.
However, the success of the measures will depend on winning over a sceptical
Labour hierarchy which already feels it has conceded enough in agreeing that
the parliament will be elected by proportional representation.
The updated proposals by retired politics professor Bernard Crick and former
Westminster and European Parliament civil servant David Millar were welcomed as
a ``contribution to the debate'' by Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson.
However, it is understood that he already has indicated privately to the
authors that there would be ``problems'' with some of their ideas.
``To make the Parliament of Scotland a model for democracy,'' is an update of
previous work by the authors, and is published by the John Wheatley Centre.
The authors have attempted to ditch almost every facet of Wesminster practice
in favour of more modern, less confrontational practices. For example, the
largest party would not select the Prime Minister and Speaker, posts which
would be voted on in a secret ballot by the parliament as a whole.
The party hierarchies, represented by the whips, would be stripped of much of
their power by handing over to a powerful business committee, chaired by the
Speaker, control over the timetable of business on the floor and in committees.
Committees, in turn, would be far more powerful and would actually be able to
initiate legislation.
The result of this would be a legislature controlled by its membership as a
whole, rather than dominated by the largest party.
``Openness, consistency and the search for consensus'' were the guiding
principles, said Mr Millar yesterday.
The Parliament would meet during office hours and take the Scottish school
holidays, to get away from the unsocial and anti-family nature of Westminster.
However, the admission in the report that the withering of the present Scottish
Secretary post at Westminster may be inevitable in time, will be seized on by
opponents of change, who will claim that Scotland will lose a valuable source
of influence and power.

A Chat between a group of schoolchildren and a beat bobby in a street in
Gloucester started the House of Horrors investigation. Friends of one of
Rosemary and Fred West's children triggered the inquiry when they stopped the
officer on an August day in 1992.
What they told him cannot be published - but it prompted Gloucester County
Council's social services department to take all five of the West's children
who were still under the age of 16 away from their home at 25 Cromwell Street
and into care within days.
Builder Fred West and his wife Rosemary, 12 years his junior, ended up in
Gloucester Crown Court facing charges of sex abuse involving a young girl.
They were acquitted because two main prosecution witnesses suddenly decided not
to testify.
But the investigation which led to their appearance in court set off a train of
events which was to uncover a horrifying trail of murder, abduction, sexual
torture, and depravity.
Investigations started at the West family home, an unremarkable house in
inner-city Gloucester, because of the tenacity of Detective Constable Hazel
Savage.
She heard about a West ``family joke'', which the children told to social
workers, that the couple's missing 16-year-old daughter Heather was ``under the
patio''.
When the West children were taken into care in 1992 there was no sign of
Heather, and efforts to trace her failed. It was believed she had simply left
home.
But Detective Constable Savage eventually convinced senior officers in the
county's small police force of the possibility that the ``joke'' was not merely
black humour - but a macabre veil for a grim truth.
Her insistence led to police asking the city's magistrates, in February 1994,
for a warrant to search the rear garden in Cromwell Street.
The searchers were to uncover what Mr Brian Leveson, QC, prosecuting, told
Rosemary West's trial was a scene ``more terrible than words can express''.
Their discoveries were to destroy the facade of normality which Fred and
Rosemary West had so cunningly projected for so long and expose a tale of
sexual obsession, promiscuity, torture, and sadism.
Fred and Rosemary West were to find themselves ranked among the cruellest and
most depraved murderers of the century, a pair whose grotesque sexual appetites
cost the lives of ten young women - including their own child who was murdered
to ensure her silence.
The trail of horror started, and was to end, at the village of Much Marcle, on
the borders of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire, where Fred West was born on
September 29, 1941.
West, the son of farm worker Walter West and his wife Daisy, who lived in a
cottage in the hamlet, was one of the family's three sons and three daughters.
At school he was described as a ``troublesome'' pupil, and he left at the age
of 15, working on local farms and later as a baker's delivery boy and a lorry
driver.
The youngster, known for his fondness for his 125cc motorcycle, which he sold
after being seriously injured in an accident, was also known for his fondness
for the dances regularly held in the local hall.
But the darker side of Fred West's character was already beginning to show, for
he had a reputation for forcing his attentions on girls.
In 1961, before his first marriage, he was to appear in court charges with a
sex offence against a 13-year-old girl. He was acquitted.
That same year he met Scots waitress Catherine Costello at nearby Ledbury. They
were married at the local register office the following year.
The marriage was to be a disaster and would end in multiple murder.
Catherine was already pregnant. The child - Charmaine West, who was to become
the youngest victim of the House of Horrors tragedy - was not West's but was
fathered by a previous boyfriend.
Soon after the marriage the couple moved to Scotland, where both of their
daughters were born, and Fred found a number of casual jobs, including work as
an ice-cream salesman.
But in December 1965 West was back in Ledbury, claiming his wife was a
prostitute and that he was being chased by Glasgow gangsters over unpaid debts.
The two daughters were to go in and out of care over the next five years.
Fred West and Catherine were reunited, on and off, but Catherine often returned
to Scotland because of their marital problems and West's violence.
By 1966 Catherine West was again in Scotland. West persuaded 17-year-old Anne
McFall, a Scottish friend of his wife's, to live with him in a caravan park
near Gloucester.
She was the child-minder but swiftly became West's lover.
The following year, in July, Catherine West again returned to the family to
take over the care of her children.
Anne McFall, who was heavily pregnant with West's child, was last sighted about
this time.
West told inquirers that she had gone back to Scotland. But she had become Fred
West's first known murder victim. He strangled her and buried her in a field
near Much Marcle.
By December 1969, Catherine West had returned to Scotland yet again.
While she was away, West, now working as a baker's roundsman and living in a
caravan park at Cheltenham, embarked on an affair with 15-year-old Rosemary
Letts - which was to lead them into a downward spiral of vice, sadism, and,
ultimately, serial murder.
In Rosemary, West had found ``the perfect companion'', Mr Leveson was to tell
the trial 26 years later.
Rosemary Letts, who was brought up in Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, was a
stubborn and rebellious teenager, and kicked constantly against her parents'
strict discipline.
She came from a church-going family who were brought up to understand clearly
the difference between right and wrong.
Although she tried to act older than her age she was regarded as being a little
slow and backward.
Her family was not in the least impressed with West - his habit of laughing at
anything and everything was unnerving, he was not very good-looking, and he was
always untidy and dirty.
But Rosemary, fresh out of school, persisted in her affair. Her parents grew so
angry and upset that they put their wayward daughter - by this time pregnant by
West - into care.
On leaving care in 1970 she returned to West's arms. Shortly afterwards the
couple moved to Cheltenham, then to Gloucester, where they set up home in a
flat at 25 Midland Road - a stone's throw from Cromwell Street.
By this time Catherine West had also disappeared. She was last sighted in March
1970, when she visited her daughters at the home of foster parents.
She had also met a violent end at the hands of Fred West and was to be dumped
in a cornfield just a few hundred yards from Anne McFall's grave.
Fred and Rosemary West were still at Midland Road when their first daughter,
Heather, was born, on October 17, 1970.
Within a month, West was in court again, being jailed for 10 months for theft,
motoring offences, and breaching a suspended sentence.
In March 1971 came the last positive sighting of Charmaine, Catherine West's
first daughter. The child, who by now was eight years old, went to a hospital
to be treated for an ankle injury.
Rosemary West was later to tell inquirers - who included the mother of the
little girl's best friend - that Charmaine had gone to live with her mother
``and bloody good riddance''.
Charmaine's body was to be found buried under the kitchen floor at 25 Midland
Road some 23 years later, on the tenth day of a police search.
Fred West was to tell police that he strangled the little girl but police
maintained he was in prison at the time and Rosemary was the killer.
Rosemary West's trial was told that it was obvious that she was having
difficulty with Charmaine. The self-willed Rosemary was, after all, only some
eight years older than her step-daughter, and had a younger step-child and a
baby to care for.
Rosemary West's lies about Charmaine's fate were part of the link which held
her and herhusbandtogether.
The prosecution case was the essence of the relationship between the couple -
what they knew about each other, what they did together, what they did to
others, and how far each was prepared to go.
Rosemary had already, after leaving Fred West and returning home, given her
parents a hint of the darkness in which she was to envelop herself, telling her
father when Fred West arrived to talk her into returning: ``He's capable of
anything - even murder.''
Much of the events which were to follow could, Mr Leveson said, be ``explained
in the context both were obsessed by sex''.
Also binding the pair together was Charmaine's murder.
That knowledge, and their increasingly bizarre sexual activities, were to end
the lives of nine other young women, and damage the lives of an unknown number.
Late in January the following year, Fred West and Rosemary married at
Gloucester City Register Office, when he was 30 and she was just 18.
It was a marriage based on a lie. Fred West falsely described himself as a
bachelor on the marriage certificate, which avoided difficult explanations
about his first marriage. For Catherine had been dead for two years.
Six months later the West's second child, Mae, was born, and the couple moved
to 25 Cromwell Street.
The burly builder rapidly established a reputation as a simple, hard-working
family man, although he was also nicknamed Jackanory - after the children's
television series in which well-known people read fairy stories - because of
his habit of telling tall tales.
But the grim reality of the private life of Fred and Rosemary West was soon to
surface.
The couple had befriended 17-year-old girl Caroline Owens, persuading her to to
work for them as a live-in nannie.
But she moved out after a few months, worried by Rosemary West's peculiar
behaviour - she had taken to stroking Caroline's hair, walking in and looking
at her while she was naked in the bath, and telling her that she had lovely
eyes.
But four weeks after quitting, while returning to her parents' home in
Cinderford after a night out, she accepted a lift from the Wests.
It was to lead to a night and a day of terror and torture at the hands of her
former employers during which she was raped, assaulted, and subjected to sexual
abuse.
She was finally allowed to leave the house the following day, after promising
that she would return to work for the couple as their nannie. Instead, the
terrified Caroline told a friend of her ordeal, then went to the police.
The Wests were subsequently fined #50 each after they admitted indecent assault
and causing actual bodily harm.
Caroline Owens may have been their first sexual torture victim.
She was also to be the only girl abducted to their house and used as the object
of their perverted sexual desires who would live to tell the tale. Others would
not be so lucky - their lives would be simply ``snuffed out'', as Mr Leveson
told the jury.
Alarm signals about the Wests were not sounded because, as they had pled
guilty, the court never heard the full facts about Caroline Owens's dreadful
ordeal.
Instead, the couple returned to the apparent normality of 25 Cromwell Street,
the unremarkable house where five unsuspecting young women were murdered in the
space of two years. Four more were to die before the killings were finally
revealed last year.
For Fred and Rosemary West, the house had a major advantage - a large cellar.
No one would be surprised if a builder improved his own family home - but the
work could also be a camouflage for other activities.
West told Caroline Owens as she lay bound and gagged in his bedroom: ``I will
keep you in the cellar and my black friends will use you. Then when I have
finished with you we will kill you and bury you under the paving stones of
Gloucester.''
Caroline's abduction set the Wests' future strategy. If their victims could not
be trusted to keep quiet they would simply have to be murdered.
The first victim to fall prey to the Wests was 19-year-old Lynda Gough. The
seamstress, whose family was from Glossop, Derbyshire, worked in the Co-Op
store in Gloucester and slept with a number of lodgers at the Wests' home.
She disappeared without trace in April 1973, after telling her parents that she
had a flat in the centre of the city.
Her mother traced to 25 Cromwell Street, where she was told that Lynda had
moved on. She had talked of going to Weston-super-Mare, but, said the young
dark haired woman at the door, she did not know whether she had actually gone
there.
But Lynda's mother noticed the woman was wearing Lynda's slippers, and some of
her clothes were hanging on the clothes line in the back garden.
Lynda's body was found in March 1994, buried under the ground floor bathroom at
the house. She had been gagged with adhesive tape.
The next victim was 15-year-old Carol Ann Cooper, who was known as ``Cass''.
She was in the care of Worcestershire social services, at a children's home in
Worcester.
She disappeared in November 1973, after catching a bus back to the home
following a night out with friends. She had probably been picked up while
hitch-hiking the final leg of the journey to the children's home.
``Cass'' came from a broken home and was taken into care after her mother died
and her father re-married. She had no known connection with the Wests or 25
Cromwell Street.
But it was under the floor in the cellar of that house that her decapitated and
dismembered body was eventually to be found. There were signs that she had also
been gagged and tied.
The final victim of 1973 was 21-year-old student Lucy Partington, who was
studying English at Exeter University and had a promising future specialising
in mediaeval art.
Lucy, a niece of the novelist Kingsley Amis and described by friends as
``gentle and serious'', disappeared just two days after Christmas Day. She had
gone to a village near Cheltenham to visit a friend who was confined to a
wheelchair.
She left the friend's home that evening to catch a bus back to her family's
home at Gretton, near Winchcombe, north-east of Cheltenham, and disappeared
without trace.
The evidence, Mr Leveson told the trial, was that Lucy Partington was kept
alive at 25 Cromwell Street ``for hideous purposes'' for a number of days.
She was doomed from the moment she was abducted as a victim who ``would never
have joined the West household voluntarily''.
Her dismembered remains were found under the floor of an alcove in the cellar
at 25 Cromwell Street in March 1994. She too had been gagged and tied.
The killings continued the following year, with Swiss-born Therese Siegenthaler.
The 21-year-old student at a London college disappeared at about Easter, 1974,
while hitch-hiking to Ireland to visit a priest friend.
Her remains were found jammed into a grave under the floor in front of the
fireplace in the cellar of 25 Cromwell Street. She, too, had been gagged before
she met her death.
Shirley Hubbard was next. The pretty fifteen-year-old lived with foster parents
in Droitwich. She was taken into care at the age of two after her parents
separated.
On November 4, the schoolgirl left home for a day's work experience on the
make-up counter at the Debenham's store in Worcester. She disappeared after
leaving at 5.30pm.
Her decapitated and dismembered remains were unearthed under the floor in the
cellar at the Wests' home. She had been made to wear a head-mask made of thick
tape. Only a three-inch piece of tubing through the mask prevented her
suffocating.
She was kept ``alive but helpless'', Mr Leveson told the jury.
``That can only have been for sexual gratification so that her living but
restrained body could be used or abused at will.
``Furthermore, this wasn't necessarily abuse over a short period of time.
Precisely how long, and when what you may think was the blessing of death came
to her, we can't say.''
Eighteen-year-old Juanita Mott was their next victim. She vanished in April
1975, the day before a friend's wedding. Juanita lived in a number of bedsits
in Gloucester, and worked at a local soft drinks firm. She was probably picked
up as she hitch-hiked back to Gloucester after an evening out.
She too was to become a bound and gagged cellar victim.
There then came a three-year gap before the Wests changed their methods, even
preying on girls who lived or visited their home.
Eighteen-year-old Shirley Anne Robinson, who was put under the supervision by
Gloucestershire County Council's social services department after her parents
split up, moved into the house in about April 1977.
She also fell under West's spell - and within months was pregnant by him.
Shirley Anne was last seen at Gloucester Health Centre in May, 1978, when she
was eight months pregnant.
West had even talked of marrying her. But within days of her medical check-up
she disappeared. Her body and the foetus was buried at Cromwell Street.
She was murdered, Mr Leveson told the trial, because she presented a threat to
the stability of the relationship between Fred and Rosemary West.
The Wests, however, had run out of space to hide bodies in the cellar - where
their victims' remains were buried in clockwise order of death. Shirley Anne,
her head and legs cut off, was buried in the small back garden at the house.
The following year, 1979, 17-year-old Alison Chambers - who was in the care of
Swansea social services and lived at the Jordan's Brook Children Home in
Gloucester - fell into their clutches.
Alison, who ran away from the home several times, finally disappeared after
telling her mother she was living with a ``homely'' family and looking after
their children.
Alison vanished in August that year. Her dismembered remains were unearthed in
the garden at 25 Cromwell Street almost 15 years later. A buckled leather belt
was found close to her skull.
The murders then seem to have stopped for a number of years.
But while killing many victims, the couple were also indulging in bizarre
sexual practices with vulnerable young people they befriended and lured into
their home.
One young woman, Miss A, told of being brutally assaulted, raped, and subjected
to other attacks. She only came forward to tell of her ordeal - shame and
confusion had kept her silent for years - after reading about the House of
Horrors investigation.
Lodgers told how Rosemary West worked as a prostitute. She entertained men -
often more than one at a time - in ``Rose's Room'', a ground floor room outside
which was a red light to warn the children to keep out when their mother was
``busy''.
One lodger told how they became used to the sounds and screams of what they
assumed was ``kinky sex''. They took it as a huge joke - but ``sometimes the
screams became quite frightening, and then the joke went sour''.
It was, as far as is known, to be eight years before the Wests returned to
murder.
But their final victim is the one whose death demonstrates that there was no
depth of evil which Fred and Rosemary West were not prepared to plumb.
The West's oldest daughter Heather, was a 16-year-old who had just finished her
GCSE examinations in 1987. Jack True, her former headmaster, remembered her as
a ``very pleasant young girl''.
But Heather had also been a child at 25 Cromwell Street as her parents embarked
on the murderous spree which turned their own home into a charnel house.
Fred West admitted killing his daughter when he appeared in Gloucester
magistrates' court after her body was found.
The trial jury heard the killer confess how he strangled her and then cut up
her body with an ice saw.
In the taped admission to police, he told how he put her remains in a dustbin
before burying her near a Wendy house in the back garden.
The trail was to lead them to nearby Midland Road and on to Much Marcle, Fred
West's birthplace, where the fields of Kempley gave up the bodies of his first
wife Catherine, baby-minder Anne McFall and her unborn baby.
The Wests, meanwhile, were separately held in custody as murder charges mounted
against them.
On the occasions that they appeared in court together, West wanted to have some
contact with his wife but she ignored him.
It was becoming every woman for herself - a game the manipulative Rosemary West
was well-equipped to play.
Without the woman with whom he had been besotted for so long, he began to
disintegrate, like a character from a Victorian novel.
He finally became isolated and withdrawn, lapsing into brooding sullen silences
for hours on end. In interviews with police he became rambling or utterly
incoherent.
Fred West was found hanging in his cell at Winson Green Prison, Birmingham, on
New Year's Day, 1995.
He had escaped justice, and his wife was left to face the courts, and the
world, alone.

I SUSPECT the Episcopal Bishop of Edinburgh's gradual retreat from the standard
interpretation of the Bible is due to his embarrassment, as an intellectual, at
holding views which depend on the revelation of scripture, rather than that of
philosophical inquiry, for validity (November 16).
Why doesn't he take the plunge and join me in the agnostic camp?

I WAS dismayed to read of yet another leading churchman engaging in this
pseudo-intellectual game of bringing the Bible up to date. If the early
Christians had been Bishop Holloway clones, apologising to Roman society for
Old Testament moral teaching, where would Western civilisation be now?
If he and others like him would spend their time emphasising the relevance of
the Bible to today's society, perhaps churches would find people flocking
through their doors again.
In my experience most of the churches which teach how up-to-date and relevant
the Bible is are full to overflowing, especially with young people.
As an example of this ``outdated moral teaching'', is it a coincidence that, in
25 years, I have only seen three marriages break up in these churches? Of
those, two were as a result of infidelity.
Let's hear more church leaders defend the Bible rather than rip it apart with
these irrelevant (and irreverent) arguments.

I READ with interest Chris Holme's article, Cancer system failing women, which
highlighted the shocking but true breast cancer statistics (November 17).
However, it would be encouraging to hear more of the women who have come
through the experience and find that life is still very much worth living.
Much as I wholeheartedly support new trials and regular screening, especially
for woman under 50, I feel there is too much emphasis on doom and gloom to the
point where, rather than encouraging women to have regular tests, they are
being frightened away.
Having been through the experience myself, which resulted in a radical
mastectomy, I can honestly say that, four years on, life is very sweet indeed
and every day is special.
There are thousands of women who like myself have been successfully treated and
I genuinely believe that if the positive results of early detection were given
more publicity, the number of women going forward for testing would rise
dramatically.

I fully agree with Calum MacKinnon. On nearly every street we see derelict
churches which, together with the declining numbers on the rolls of the Kirk,
would seem to bear out John Lennon's quote (Weekend Extra), ``Christianity will
go. It will vanish and shrink. We're more popular than Jesus now: I don't know
which will go first, rock'n'roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right, but his
disciples were thick and ordinary.''
I may be thick and ordinary but I believe that our island home is a more
Christian place today than it was in the days when kirks were packed to
overflowing.
For it was in these days, among other sacrileges, that coal miners, the less
than human scum of the earth, were forbidden burial in sacred ground.
By legislation and every fair-minded means at our command, health and safety at
work must be of paramount concern. What I find sad is that every hiccup in the
lottery of life should be seen as a possible source of financial compensation.

James McAdam Clark, CVO, MC, BSc, diplomat and scientist; born September 13,
1916, died October 15, 1995
JAMES McAdam Clark, the scientist and diplomat, has died at the age of 79.
Fiercely proud of his Scottish ancestry, he was educated at Edinburgh Academy,
where he was, in his own words, ``undistinguished but not unhappy''. On leaving
school in 1933 he was awarded a Leverhulme Scholarship and graduated from
Edinburgh University in 1938 with first class honours in chemistry.
On the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the Royal Artillery, serving
in the UK, North Africa, and Italy, where as a captain in Heavy Artillery he
was awarded the MC for bravery in the field. Thanks to his scientific
background he was sent at the end of hostilities to the Royal Military College
of Science, remaining there till 1946.
On return to civilian life he joined the Ministry of Fuel and Power as a civil
servant before being transferred to the Foreign Office and diplomatic service.
In a career lasting almost 30 years, he went first to Ecuador, as a young head
of chancery, then to Lisbon in 1956 (where he was appointed an Officer of the
Order of Christ).
From 1960 to 1964 he was posted to Vienna as counsellor and the UK's
representative to the Atomic Energy Authority, where his Soviet opposite number
was the demoted former Foreign Minister Molotov. After a spell in London he was
seconded from 1966 to 1970 to the Ministry of Technology under Tony Benn.
Finally in 1970 he was sent as Consul General to Paris, where he was to serve
under three ambassadors in a seven-year tour of duty. He was appointed CVO in
1972 in recognition of his contribution to the success of the Queen's visit to
France that year.
Retiring to Aldeburgh in Suffolk, he pursued his interests in writing poetry
and lowering his golf handicap.
James Clark met his future wife Denise Dufournier, a young French barrister, in
1939. She was to achieve fame as a Resistance worker for Reseau Comet. Betrayed
in 1943, she survived incarceration in the Ravensbruck concentration camp to
return to England, marry James Clark in 1946, and bear him two daughters. She
died in January last year.

John Collier, FRS, chairman Nuclear Electric; born January 22, 1935, died
November 18, 1995
THERE can be few people who have achieved such sustained success in tackling a
dauntingly difficult task during the last years of their career as did John
Collier before his untimely death.
In November, 1989, when the nuclear power stations were taken out of the
electricity privatisation, John Collier was asked by John Wakeham, then
Secretary of State for Energy, to be chairman of the state-owned company
Nuclear Electric to run the stations in England and Wales.
Nuclear power was at its nadir. Generating costs appeared to be out of control;
construction projects had run over time and over budget; de-commissioning and
fuel cycle costs were not known with any confidence but were expected to be
prohibitively large; and there was little public support for nuclear power.
In the following years, under John Collier's leadership, Nuclear Electric made
improvements on all fronts.
Output rose steadily, costs were reduced, and staff numbers were brought down
without compulsory redundancy. Estimates of decommissioning costs were refined
and reduced. Firm fuel cycle contracts were negotiated. Sizewell B was built to
time and cost.
Safety standards also improved - Collier was convinced that good business
performance and good safety performance go hand in hand - and public and
political attitudes slowly became less hostile to nuclear power.
How was this achieved? John Collier had remarkable strategic vision;
immediately after his appointment he set out key objectives for the company
(with safety and environmental protection dominant) which determined the
company's agenda and which have all been achieved.
He unfailingly led from the front and his intellectual flair and human warmth
enabled him to attract and weld together a group of talented people on the
company's board.
His integrity engendered confidence in the public and staff about Nuclear
Electric's commitment to safety. He gave the firm a belief in itself and its
technolgy which underpinned its rapid progress.
The outcome was the Government's conclusion last summer that Nuclear Electric's
AGR and PWR stations were capable of being privatised. This reversal of the
1989 decision was the crowning achievement of Collier's career.
Aged 16, Collier left St Paul's School to become a Harwell apprentice against
the wishes of his headmaster. From Harwell he went to University College,
London, where he obtained a first class degree in Chemical Engineering. In 1957
he embarked on a career in the chemical engineering division at Harwell,
interrupted by a spell of two years with Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and
three years with Atomic Power Construction Limited.
He worked on the key nuclear safety areas of heat transfer and two-phase flow
where he made outstanding contributions. By 1975, he was head of the division.
The book he wrote at Harwell, Convective Boiling and Condensation, is one of
the standard international texts.
By 1977 it became clear Collier's abilities would enable him to contribute to
strategy and policy and he became head of a central technical policy team in
the AEA. He played a prominent part in achieving a sensible successful outcome
to the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation initiated by President
Carter; he helped assess the safety of light water reactor pressure vessels for
the UK and provide evidence for the Sizewell B inquiry; he worked on developing
joint arrangements between the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and
the National Nuclear Corporation (NNC) for PWR design and construction.
In 1982 he was made director of the UKAEA's Safety and Reliability Directorate.
In 1983 Walter Marshall persuaded him to become director general of the CEGB's
Generation Development and Construction Division. He transformed the division
into an internal contractor within CEGB and oversaw the fusing of NNC and CEGB
staff to form the PWR project group which was responsible for the design and
construction management of the Sizewell B    station.
In January, 1987, he became chairman and chief executive of the UKAEA. By the
time he left in June, 1990 (after some months as both chairman of AEA and NE),
a new business-orientated structure had been set up tailored to the AEA's new
circumstances.
His massive contributions to nuclear engineering, to management in the nuclear
industry, and to increasing public understanding of nuclear issues were
recognised by his election to the fellowships of the Royal Academy of
Engineering and subsequently of the Royal Society.
He worked actively to improve the quality of engineering education and raise
the status of engineers. His efforts were reflected by his election as
president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers.
John Collier was a big man in every sense. He dominated any room by his
physical presence and dominated meetings by the depth of his technical
understanding and the force of his personality. He was essentially a very
private and serious man, though with a ready sense of humour. He had a deep
Christian faith and was a regular worshipper at his village church in
Sheepscombe, Gloucestershire.
The overwhelming memory of John Collier must be of a man of enormous humanity,
modesty, kindness, and unfailing courtesy who was regarded as a real friend by
his many colleagues and contacts.
He is survived by his wife, Ellen, who supported him actively throughout his
career and played a key role in his success, and by a son and daughter.
n.Appreciation by Dr ROBIN JEFFREY, chairman and chief executive of Scottish
Nuclear.

I WRITE to congratulate you on the splendidly balanced political coverage in
the aftermath of the Prime Minister's recent pronouncements on Scotland and the
constitution (November 18).
John Major may yet be hoist with his own petard - and Michael Forsyth up there
along with him - but at last we have a credible heavyweight newspaper agreeing
with him over Scotland; namely, independence is a genuine option.
May we now put behind us the tired old chestnuts: oh, you could never manage on
your own; you would have to go through customs to visit your granny; you would
need to change your currency to see the Scotland football team in England, and
so on.
With regard to the currency, incidentally, many people do that already, so
problematic is Scottish sterling south of the Border. We all know that to be
the case and your leader chooses three interesting small countries to compare
with Scotland - Finland, whose cultural identity, like ours, waxed strong
before the break with Mother Russia; Estonia, which is defying all gloomy
predictions and dire consequences as she has successfully gone her own way; and
Luxembourg, which has the highest standard of living in Europe.
Not a bad choice without bringing in the equally strong Norwegian or Danish
parallels.
Some of us are already detecting a sea change, but given that the
constitutional issue simply refuses to go away, why won't the democratic will
of the people of Scotland force a referendum on this matter?
With regard to the role of Prime Minister, Mr Major ought to understand by now
that when he says ``the UK will be the poorer without Scotland'' he is palpably
compounding a very basic misunderstanding - without Scotland, there is no
longer a United Kingdom.
Would England be the 17th member state of the European Union?

AN impressive line-up of high-profile instrumentalists was brought together by
Music-Makers Organisation for this commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of
the death of Bartok. Link-man appeared to be pianist Gusztav Fenyo who has
recorded with two of the evening's guests, the violinist Susanne Stanzeleit and
clarinettist Michael Collins.
However, first to show his form was the horn player, Stephen Stirling, with a
highly translucent account of his part in the Brahms Trio for piano, violin and
horn. He made it all look and sound so easy, projecting a warm mellow tone with
some vigorous violin accompaniment in the thoroughly enjoyable Scherzo.
With violinist and horn player both standing to play, Susanne Stanzeleit's
particularly physical style of attack was pointed up, an approach echoed by an
equally nimble of foot Michael Collins in the next two pieces. He brought a
delicacy of expression to the Ballade for Clarinet and Piano by Weiner and then
teamed up with Stanzeleit for what became almost a balletic interpretation of
Bartok's Contrasts as both bobbed and weaved their way through the complexity
of breathing and fingering demanded in the writing.
After the interval Fenyo squeezed plenty of rhythmic atmosphere from Kodaly's
original piano version of Dances of Marosszek, setting the scene for an
astounding piece of ensemble playing as Susie Meszaros, viola, and Timothy
Gill, cello, joined Collins, Stanzeleit and Fenyo in Dohnanyi's Sextet.
This formidable array of talent locked together into one dynamic unit, sending
sparks round the theatre. This was playing you wanted to go on and on.

N her article on Dawson International following publication of the company's
interim results Margaret Vaughan made a number of statements which were not
correct (November 17).
While I have an obvious interest as the previous managing director, invited to
resign along with the previous chairman, I do not wish to comment on the
company and its performance other than to set the record straight.
It is stated that I and the previous chairman, Sir Ronald Miller, both received
a settlement of three years' salary rather than two as recorded.
It is suggested that Philip Kemp was managing director of the US shower curtain
business. He was in fact chief executive of the US businesses with the
president of the shower curtain business reporting to him until he (Mr Kemp)
left the company in April 1994. Details of his settlement were recorded in the
rights issue documentation published in May 1994.
Furthermore, a number of initiatives announced following our departure (in some
cases within a matter of days) were in fact instigated and agreed during the
term of office of Sir Ronald and myself: the sale of the shower curtain
business, Dawson Home Fashions; the sale of the weaving business, Premier
Fabrics; and the rationalisation of manufacturing capacity at Pringle of
Scotland and at Blackwoods carpet yarns.

Minty Donald visits an exhibition which puts            the glorious art of
scenography in the spotlight with
THE notion of an exhibition of design for theatre is, on reflection, curious.
How and why would one present an exhibition of something so dependent on its
context, the live theatre performance, for its appreciation or comprehension?
But then, theatre design - or scenography, as some of us, at the risk of
inviting pseud's corner accusations, prefer to call it - has always occupied a
peculiar position somewhere between visual art and theatre, between fine art
and design.
One need only look around the various institutions where it is taught (none,
regrettably, in Scotland as yet) to see these are frequently Drama Schools as
Art Colleges, fine art faculties as departments of interior and
three-dimensional design.
MAKE SPACE! is an exhibition of design for theatre and alternative spaces
currently in Carlisle (the furthest north it gets, to date), and it tackles
this ambivalence head-on. While unavoidably, and unashamedly, inviting
spectators to be seduced by the skill and intricacy, and the sheer doll's house
dinkieness of the models on display, exhibition organisers Kate Burnett and
Peter Ruthven Hall are at great pains to establish the context of each design.
The exhibition is divided into eight sections, according to category of theatre
or performance space. Thus we have sections devoted to design for
theatre-in-the-round, for thrust and open stages, for proscenium theatres,
touring, converted spaces and so on, including one on ``events and non-theatre
performances''.
Each designer's work is accompanied by a statement of intent, supporting the
drawings, photographs and models. It may sound like hard work, more educational
than inspiration, but the display is engaging and accessible; well deserving of
the special gold medal awarded at the 1995 Prague Scenography Quadriennial.
But what of the work itself? Designers will no doubt quibble, as is their wont,
over the selection of exhibits. Undoubtedly, some weak pieces have found their
way into the show, and the concentration on the North and North West of England
privileges the neo-hippy school of rough-hewn visual theatre. Diehards of the
bamboo-and-willow sculpture, puppet, and bonfire, Welfare State International
and Horse &amp; Bamboo perhaps exclude some more innovative work. Where, for
instance, at risk of waving the nationalist flag, is Glasgow's own Stewart
Laing?
But then, you can't please everyone. All in all, the show provides a
representative overview of British scenography from the past five years,
wheeling out the old stalwarts as well as catching the prevalent trends,
fashions, and flavours-of-the-month.
In the grunge corner, we have Hildegard Bechtler's Wozzeck for Opera North, all
pared-down monochrome, but with a scummy, grimy layering of textures, and
fascination with the qualities of ``real'' and ``poor'' materials on stage.
Vicki Mortimer's Turn of the Screw, at Tramway, brings in the properties of the
building itself, enhancing them with ``honest'' and ``simple'' elements such as
tarpaulin, water and earth in her haunting design for Scottish Opera.
At the other end of the scale, the grand, glossy visual metaphors so beloved by
contemporary opera designers are given vigorous reworkings in Mark Thompson's
stunning design for Sydney Opera House's Hansel and Gretel.
This is just a tiny sample of a show which encompasses work from Christine
Marfleet's minimalist gems to Ian MacNeil's  An Inspector Calls.
Such a richly packed exhibition deserves wider exposure, not least north of the
border.
n MAKE SPACE! is at the Tullie House Museum, Carlisle until December 3.

LOOKING at the lists of examination results I was disappointed to see that you
have once again failed to publish one of the key indicators (November 21).
The figure for the percentage of pupils in S4 who gain five or more Standard
Grade awards at levels 1-6 actually tells us more about a school than any other
single indicator.
If this figure is low then however impressive its credit or general awards may
be, the school is manifestly not reaching all the parts.
If, on the other hand, the 1-6 figure is high, it tells us that the school is
managing to get all, or nearly all, its children to keep on coming, keep on
working, finish all the work for the internally assessed components, and turn
up on the day to do their best.
Any school which is doing that successfully is almost certainly being very
effective with all its pupils, whatever their backgrounds or abilities.
More seriously, by failing to mention awards gained at foundation level you are
serving to reinforce old prejudices. The implication is that foundation awards
are indeed worthless and that all the hard work, effort, and good attendance of
the children concerned is of no account.
When will we learn to give due value to the education of all our children?

Jack Finney (Walter Braden Finney), writer; born Milwaukee, 1911, died November
4, 1995
ONE of the enduring science fiction plots of the American cinema, the aliens
who take over human bodies, was provided by Jack Finney's 1955 novel, The Body
Snatchers. It was filmed three times, the first and most celebrated version
directed by Don Siegel in 1956 was Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It was
remade under the same title in 1978 by Philip Kaufman and as Body Snatchers
last year by Abel Ferrara.
The novel's plot is about alien plant pods which arrive from space and give
birth to perfect replicas of the inhabitants of a small American town who
proceed to take over the world as the pods proliferate. It is a chilling tale,
and Seigel made the most of it in a low-budget film starring Kevin McCarthy as
the one man who realises what is going on, losing his fiancee to the
infiltrators. The remakes changed the location to San Francisco and a US army
base without actually improving things.
The strength of the plot is such that both book and the films can be seen as
allegories interpreted variously as anti-Communist or anti-McCarthy. A prolific
novelist and short story writer, whose influence as a model is admitted by the
likes of Stephen King, Finney had other books adapted for the cinema, including
thrillers like Five Against the House, filmed in 1956 with Kim Novak, and
Assault on a Queen, about a plot to hijack the Queen Mary, filmed in 1966 with
Frank Sinatra.
His time-shift comedy, Marion's Wall, was filmed four years ago as Maxie,
starring Glenn Close. His best novel, Time and Again, published in 1970, was
about a man who thought himself back into turn of the century New York.

As the Forte empire comes under attack from Granada, Andrew Wilson recalls past
battles won and lost
THERE must have been a chuckle in Heaven yesterday. For eight tense and
dramatic years, the late Sir Hugh Wontner as chairman of the Savoy hotels group
resolutely fought off the attempts first by Lord Forte and more latterly
In the glorious and sometimes confused and incomprehensible battles that
ensued, Sir Hugh with a wintry smile said at one point:  ``I always thought
that Italians made good hotel managers.''
But that is what seemingly brash Gerry Robinson of Granada disputes - and he
has a point.
The Forte group's origins are the stuff of legend. These include the story of
the 1880s, when a family member was captured by bandits who demanded a ransom.
They threatened initially to cut off his ears and then his nose. The family
paid the money but decided that was valour enough and most emigrated including
Rocco Forte, grandfather of the now Sir Rocco.
He had ventured as far north as Scotland to set up small cafes - until the late
1940s the eastern part of Scotland seemed to be dotted with Forte ice-cream
shops and cafes.
Charles Forte arrived on the scene on November 26, 1908 in the village of
Montfort, south of Rome. He was brought to Scotland to join his father five
years later and was educated at both Alloa Academy and later at Dumfries
College.
He branched out on his own with his own milk-bar chain which spread rapidly
thoughout Britain although most were in southern England and particularly in
the London area. He was growing ever richer as the local prosperity improved in
the late 1930s until the Second World War brought about the shattering blow of
internment with a host of other Italians on the Isle of Man - albeit for just
three months.
The ``Milk Bar King'' became a British citizen in late 1945 and continued to
expand his business. A major breakthrough was the winning of the catering
contract for the 1951 Festival of Britain.
Other firsts included the award of the first motorway catering contract in 1959
- surely a missed opportunity as motorway feeding of the masses gained a
reputation that lasted a full two decades and only now is beginning to receive
critical praise and approbation.
That was four years after being awarded the right to supply Heathrow. This gave
Forte a major opportunity which proved invaluable in precise mass-catering and
portion control for highly demanding customers, as airlines could not afford
delays. That interest was sold off at the beginning of last year in the form of
Alpha Airports, although Forte still retains a quarter share which it does
intend selling off at the appropriate time - as does Granada if it wins the
takeover battle.
Industrial catering under the Gardner Merchant banner became an increasingly
important part of group activities and gave a stable and expanding base which
insulated the rest of Forte to some extent against the vagaries of the economy
and particularly the hotels business.
That began in 1958 when Charles Forte bought the Waldorf Hotel in London,
ironically as        it turned out just a couple of hundred yards away from the
Savoy. The roadside interests were gradually expanded with the establishment of
the Little Chefs and the Happy Eaters which were acquired as a package much
later.
The years 1970 and '71 were among the most important in his life. He was
knighted and also merged with the Trust Houses group. That was established in
1904 as a chain of temperance hotels catering for commercial travellers who
even then had a reputation.
Then came the bid from Allied Breweries which was one of the most vicious
dogfights ever seen in the City. By the end of the day Allied was seen off but
that left deep scars in the Trust House Forte boardroom.
Then came the purchase of the Travelodge motels business in the US although
that has never performed as well as had been hoped - overall the US experience
has been one of disappointment which culminated at one stage in former British
Steel chairman Sir Ian MacGregor being sent out to improve the business.
The wooing and then assault on the Savoy began in 1981 - a year before his
peerage as Baron Forte of Ripley. That was from the platform of the 35 Strand
Hotels acquired from Allied's Lyons subsidiary in 1978 for about #28m.
There was a clash of temperament.
Lord Forte, a close friend of Margaret Thatcher, is blunt and knows his own
mind but is also good at putting people at ease.
That was not enough for the Savoy's then managing director Giles Shepard who
remarked that ``the stewardship of the Savoy could not be entrusted to a vast
combine which, among other things, runs service stations on the main arterial
roads''.
That was a bit rich considering Forte made more money out of them than did the
Savoy despite its ownership of three of London's five-star hotels. In recent
years, partly due to recession, Forte has been seen to be struggling.
Part of that has been put at the door of Sir Rocco who became chief executive
in 1982 and chairman in 1992. But that is perhaps a little unfair given that
there was the recession of the early 1990s. And whatever people say about
Rocco, he does not lack competitiveness. Not only has he finished the London
marathon several times but he is also a keen golfer - he plays Gerry Robinson
frequently and plays to win.
So while he has been nicknamed Prince Charles by some in the headquarters in an
unprepossessing concrete headquarters in High Holborn, there is going to be
quite a fight before the battle is lost and won.

UP until the Renaissance it was felt among those in society who held knowledge
that everything had been learned - the origins of life were explained in the
Bible, the natural world and human physiology had all been explained by the
ancients. Scientists who, in the new spirit of inquiry, began making
discoveries and publishing them frequently fell foul of the establishment,
especially the Church.
Modern economics is rather in the position of the fifteenth-century Church
-man-made explanations of how things are and must be assume the status of a
proven truth which cannot, must not be challenged. One can forgive the
economists themselves for this, imprisoned by their training, unable to break
free of the constraints to independent thought that formal training can so
regrettably create, they can no more question their faith than could those
churchmen in previous centuries.
Politicians, however, are drawn from the population generally, and some at
least should be able to take a fresh look at economic practice, if not theory.
Recent debates between the major parties on tax and benefits have highlighted
the fact this is not happening.
The Herald editorial of November 20 noted this, regretting the absence of `` .
. . a presentation of the theory and political ethics of any Labour tax
policy''. Labour is not the only party guilty of this; most politicians' ideas
on tax are completely shaped by what has gone before (so a tax introduced to
fund the Napoleonic Wars remains the mainstay of fiscal policy 200 years on).
Variations in taxation proposals between the major parties resemble a see-saw
more than anything - Income Tax up or down a few pence, VAT up or down a few
percent, depending on which section of the electorate is being particulary
wooed.
To counter the ``faith'' aspect of how people look at this aspect of the
economy, I have written out, as simply as I can, the 10 commandments of
tax/benefit policy.
1. Tax raises revenue.
2. Tax influences behaviour.
3. If you tax work, fewer people will be employed.
4. If you don't tax resources, people will feel free to use them all up.
5. If tax is raised and spent locally, it can respond to local need.
6. Everyone, including every child, is a citizen and citizenship should be
worth having.
7. The quality of life of even the richer members of society is reduced by the
poverty of others.
8. There will never again be nine to five, Monday to Friday jobs for every
adult, if indeed there ever were.
9. Part-time work, voluntary work, full or part-time study are all good for
society and should be encouraged at any age.
10. The ``cake'' cannot keep getting bigger, so fairness means a redistribution
of what we've got, both wealth and work.
Most of these are obvious. Commandment 10 is the only one likely to be
challenged but common sense shows it to be true; for example, 3% economic
growth per year means a doubling of economic activity in approximately 22 years
- twice the pollution, twice the waste produced, twice the consumption of
resources, twice the traffic in less than a generation - and if recent history
is anything to go by, no corresponding increase in employment.
Mr Blair may have abandoned Clause 4 but unless he has also abandoned fair
play, he will have to face up to redistribution of wealth at some point. We
can't rely on the cake getting bigger to solve poverty.
A party like the Scottish Green Party which is unlikely (though perfectly
ready) to form the next Government has the space to stand back and take a
proper look at the whole tax/benefit system with all its complexities and
bureaucracy. We have produced a thoroughly researched and costed system which
would eliminate the poverty trap (commandments six and nine) tax resource
depletion rather than work (three, four), encourage appropriate development and
promote a fair and just society (seven, nine, 10).
This difference would start as soon as a child is born. What is now referred to
as Child Benefit we would regard as the child's Basic Income which he/she would
continue to receive, increasing between the ages of 16 and 18 until it reached
the level of the Adult Basic Income. This would replace all existing benefits
and personal tax allowance, and would not be lost on taking up employment,
thereby eliminating that particular poverty trap.
It would be simple and cheap to administer and would allow for flexible
working, studying and retiral at an age that suits the person and his/her
employer, rather than at some rigid pre-determined age.
The Basic Income would continue throughout life - no need for an ``old age
pension'' - with the only variation being an enhancement in cases of
disability. Unlike the much-vaunted ``minimum wage'' or indeed Gordon Brown's
low starting rate for income tax, the Basic Income would benefit everyone, not
just those in full-time work.
As commandments one to four make clear, we need to move away from taxing jobs,
as National Insurance and VAT do now, to taxing resource use. We need to
encourage development by replacing taxes like Council Tax which are levied on
buildings and therefore discourage development, to a Land Value Tax which would
encourage development and discourge land speculation.
We need to sweep away the present cumbersome, inefficient and often degrading
benefits system with a simple, cheap and fair alternative and to integrate this
with the tax system. As The Herald editorial referred to earlier pointed out,
it is the benefits system rather than the tax system which is responsible for
the poverty trap.
Above all, we need the debate on tax, benefits and the economy generally to be
enriched by some new ideas.
I began by saying that 500 years ago it was generally held that the ancients
had found all the answers. They hadn't, of course, but they still hit upon some
essential truths from time to time; I believe it was Solomon who said: ``Where
there is no vision the people perish.''

DESPITE European pique and the pettiness of the French government it remains a
fact that only the United States had the muscle and the determination to
persuade Balkan leaders to agree to a peace plan for Bosnia. That said, the
peace plan is a frail creature, much in need of sustenance and support before
it can grow into something worthy of the name. Whether this will happen depends
for the most part on two men. The first is President Clinton who encouraged
that talented bully, US negotiator Richard Holbrooke, to bluster, threaten, and
twist Balkan arms. He did this with enthusiasm and the result is an agreement
which has achieved a reasonable degree of support in former Yugoslavia despite
its apparent rejection by the Bosnian Serbs. President Clinton must take the
peace process a crucial step further by ensuring that the United States honours
its promise to supply one-third of the required 60,000 Nato peacekeepers. His
problem lies in the attitude of his Republican Party opponents in the United
States who have shown a breathtaking ability to take political
bloody-mindedness to new heights of irresponsibility. British involvement is
dependent on US involvement, and although President Clinton will probably win
his peacekeepers it is sad that he should have to argue such an obvious case.
Within former Yugoslavia much depends on President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia. It is distressing to see this man, who carries much of the guilt for
the inception of the Balkan war, feted and courted as a peacemaker. He may make
peace, but only because he wants to remove sanctions from his own country. If
the Bosnian Serbs persist in their opposition to the peace agreement Milosevic
will bully them, although not as gently as Ambassador Holbrooke. Even this may
not be enough to ensure a lasting peace, but it is the best chance the
suffering people of the region have had.

Alan Hull, singer, songwriter and poet; born February 20, 1945, died November
17, 1995
YES - Fog on the Tyne, Lady Eleanor, Clear White Light, We Can Swing Together -
few were the rock festivals and parties in the early 1970s which didn't sway
along to these songs. They were, of course, all sung by the same band,
Lindisfarne; all written by the same man, Alan Hull; and all, remarkably,
written in the same week while Hull was working as a nurse in a mental hospital.
A strict working class Newcastle upbringing gave Hull's writing the common
touch, his experiences as a nurse bringing a sense of realism which sustained
him when Lindisfarne's brief taste of rock stardom came to an end and he turned
his energies towards more overtly political writing.
He began singing as a teenager with a local rock band called the Chosen Few.
They made a few records but failed to make much impact.
In 1967 he formed the Downtown Faction, who a year later became Lindisfarne.
Their first album, Nicely Out Of Tune, initially caused a only few ripples but
when the follow-up, Fog on the Tyne, reached No.1 in 1971, it charged up the
charts.
By the following year, Lindisfarne were vying with Slade as the UK's biggest
selling band. An attempt to repeat that success in America backfired, however,
and ultimately led to three of the band - drummer Ray Laidlaw, guitarist Simon
Cowe, and bass guitarist Rod Clements - leaving to form Jack the Lad.
In 1973 Hull had released a solo album, Pipedream, many of whose songs related
to his nursing experiences, and he followed this up with a book of poetry on
similar concerns, The Mocking Horse, which became a best seller. He continued
to work as a solo artist, releasing the albums Squire (1975), Phantoms (1979),
and On the Other Side (1983).
Lindisfarne re-formed in 1978, scoring a Top Ten single with Run For Home, and
in 1990 joined footballer Paul Gascoigne on his ``Gazza rap'' hit version of
Fog on the Tyne.
Their concerts, particularly their incredible run of 150 Christmas sell-outs at
Newcastle City Hall, retained the 1970s care-free folk-rock party spirit, but
Hull could also still hit the political bullseye with songs such as Mother
Russia from their 1993 album Elvis Lives On the Moon. He was working on a new
solo album when he died following a heart attack last Friday.

David Bowie has released a new album, but    David Belcher hears a hero  crash
landing
ONCE upon a time, long ago and far away, I would have been thrilled to be able
to say I played a part in making a David Bowie album. Woweee, me and Boweee!
Chameleon of rock. Pilot of an inter-galactic ark, the Glam Warrior, upon which
I used to be a willing space-cadet. My hero! He was. Once upon a time, long ago
and far away . . .
Well, we all grow up and grow out of things, don't we? What was that Bowie
song? Ch-ch-changes . . . time may change me, but you can't trace time. A
ringing statement. Although what it meant, I never knew.
As for the current Bowie-Belcher interface? No big deal, really. So what part
did I play in making a disc Bowie has described as ``a non-linear gothic drama
hyper-cycle''? It was by default that I became involved, actually. It's what I
didn't do during the making of his current album Outside that made all the
difference. Kinda Zen, that. Kinda ambient. Kinda Bowie.
But hey, I'm not being a tease when I say that the true story of me and Bowie
must start at the start - in the summer of 1972, with teen-laddie me at home in
Manchester listening to John Peel on Radio 1.
John Lennon might have had his head turned by hearing Chuck Berry. For me it
was Ziggy Stardust, leper messiah, fuzzy guitars and rock'n'roll zip. The birth
of glam rock! Glam: cheap, gaudy, and a two-fingered, two-pronged affront.
For as well as thumbing its cute button-nose at the staid scruffiness of
hippiedom and heavy, lasting bands like Wishbone Ash and Budgie, glam blew a
raspberry at grey-suited Straightsville. Glam was purple lip-gloss;
navel-baring jumpers from Miss Selfridge; teetering tri-coloured platform
clogs, and long feather-cut hair with red and blonde streaks in it. But enough
of me. You should have seen what the girls were wearing.
I went to see Bowie play live that summer, just prior to the Ziggy phenomenon
taking nationwide effect. He wore a blue nylon bomber jacket with a fake-fur
collar, his jeans rolled up to knee-level, baseball boots, plus red and white
football socks. Bowie's hair stood up in a vermilion cockade. Gallus. The
perfect synthesis of soccer hooliganism and rock 'n' roll. And I was there:
ascloseasthis.
What did Bowie and his on-stage gang, the Spiders From Mars, sound like? Crisp,
punchy, fizzing.
I saw Bowie again in the same venue at Christmas. Not as good. The place was
more packed. I was further away from him. Stardom meant Bowie was literally
more distant.
What else? Mick Ronson performed execrable guitar solos; Bowie wore a
skintight, snake-print suit that would have made him the target of a terracing
ruckus rather than the leader of one. Over the next couple of years, I came to
see that mincing around pretending to be a hairdresser was much less fun than
going out with hairdressers - female ones.
A few months after that Bowie gig, I bade farewell to my own brief rock 'n'
roll career as Vincebus Eruptum's deeply-unconvincing leper-messiah vocalist.
We were playing a local school's under-14s disco. I sang Suffragette City.
``Put the records back on!'' the more discerning punters cried. Afterwards, one
lumpy young herbert wearing blue eye-shadow approached and said our Suffragette
City was chuffing great, loads better than Bowie's.
He was incorrect. In a similar way, I came to see Bowie as more flawed as time
passed. Nevertheless, I still bought the albums, still went to see him. Glasgow
Apollo, 1978, in his funky matelot outfit. 1983, Birmingham NEC; All I truly
remember is being several miles from the stage.
Later the same year Bowie played Murrayfield. Heading stagewards, his grey Ford
Granada, surrounded by a flying phalanx of security men, almost ran me over in
the car park. The perfect way to go, I thought. Then it rained a lot, and the
feeling receded. It didn't stop me going to Sunderland in 1987: the Glass
Spider tour. What is a glass spider? One of Bowie's concepts, and therefore not
worthy of rational explanation. The show was awful, with swarms of interpretive
dancers and Peter pigging Frampton on guitar, a rocker whose palpable
uselessness - show me a worse No 1 than Show Me The Way - helped spark the
great punk war in 1976.
Returning to Glasgow by car, my party traded ever-more indecipherable Bowie
lyrics through the night. Lyrics we had once hungrily absorbed, believing them
to be an expression of universal truths. The only truth was that Bowie had
become nostalgia, and empty nostalgia to boot.
Tin Machine? Tinny and mechanical. In 1991, the nadir: Bowie officially
flushing his old hits down the dumper on a tour which visited Ingliston's cold,
insulting concrete wastes.
And now he's back. Supported next week in Scotland by Morrissey. Shouldn't it
be the other way round? Why, Morrissey, why? I can but salute your undying
Mancunian glam-rock loyalty, sirrah. Maybe you and I flounced shoulder to
shoulder all those years ago. Boys keep swinging. I wonder what would you have
looked like as a 13-year-old in blue eye-shadow.
But back to the point: me and Bowie and Outside, the big deal. About a year
ago, I was dining in a swish Islington restaurant when David Bowie grandly
swept in, feet from my table, accompanied by a female aide. Was I excited? No.
Another 20 minutes passed. Holy guacamole! Here's Brian Eno heading towards
Bowie's table. Eno is one of Bowie's ex-collaborators; Eno ends up producing
Outside. Hindsight plainly identifies Outside as the project under discussion
that night in Islington.
Then, after another 15 minutes, in lopes U2 guitar-slinger the Edge. My dinner
companion and I are by now in a state of giggly ecstasy, taking bets on the
identity of Bowie's next guest. Aprs Eno, Bono? Or Ringo? Van Morrison? Jim
Morrison? Ten minutes later it's U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, who's joining
the Bowie table.
So how did I get more closely involved in the process of creative exchange
which ultimately led to Outside? Well, visiting the lavvy, I had to pass
Bowie's table. Asclosesasthis. I wanted to speak to him, but I couldn't. I
don't think he would have heard anyway. Yarking away in blokeish sarf Landan
tones, he was.
I wanted to tell Bowie that in order to re-kindle his muse-sort-of-thing, he
had to re-immerse himself in happening music - other peoples'. I could have
given him a long list. But I didn't. So that's why, without my advice, Outside
turned out the way it did - not very good.
Eh up, Davie Belch and D. Bowie. We've come a long way together over the past
23 years, but maybe not as far as either of us would admit.
n David Bowie, accompanied by Morrissey, visits Aberdeen's Exhibition Centre on
Wednesday, November 29, and Glasgow's SECC the following day.

BRITAIN may not be at ease with itself, but it is not a nation in despair and
fears that the nation's public institutions may be about to collapse under the
weight of criticism or social division appear misplaced, according to a new
report on British Social Attitudes by Social Community Planning &amp; Research
published today.
It reveals growing distrust in, and greater apathy about politics and
politicians, increased fear of crime, highest among those least at risk, and a
growing tendency to back punitive rather than libertarian attitudes. There has
been a marked decline in support over the past decade for the belief that it is
better to risk letting a guilty person go free than convict someone who is
innocent, one of the cornerstones of the British legal system.
As far as the Welfare State is concerned, the report warns politicians who
tamper with it to do so at their peril because the foundations of popular
support have ``never been more solid''. It admits this support is coloured by
self-interest, rather than altruism, but it is none the less real and no
evidence for social divisions threatening the Welfare State's stability was
found. There was also little support for moving away from the mass provision to
the flexible provision of services.
On Europe the report offers cold comfort for the Eurosceptics. Only 17% of the
population, compared with 42% 10 years ago, think we should withdraw, and the
closer links with Europe as compared with the United States, are favoured by a
two to one majority.
What must worry the Eurosceptics most is their failure         to attract
support among the young. They are overwhelmingly pro-integration, although the
fact that more Eurosceptics are Conservative supporters means that the
Eurosceptics will continue to get a sympathetic hearing within that party. On
the other hand, many ``natural'' Conservatives among the middle classes, put
off by an anti-integration stance, could be tempted by Labour's more
pro-European outlook, the report suggests.
Scottish devolution:
THE report found that one           in five Scots, and one in three people in
the UK were opposed to any reform at all. Among     the remainder the most
popular option was a devolved assembly.
q-Asked in 1992 about independence outside the UK and the EU, only 4% were in
favour, compared with 5% in 1994.
q-Asked about independence inside the EU, 9% were in favour in 1992 compared
with 10% in 1994.
q-Asked about Scotland remaining part of the UK with an assembly with some tax
and spending powers 52% were in favour in 1992, compared with 47% in 1994.
Taxation and paying for the Welfare State:
THE report notes the arguments about the need to change the Welfare State, but
it finds that the British public does not wish to either abandon or recast it
into ``new welfare''. People remain firmly wedded to the traditional Welfare
State, the bulk of whose resources are sunk into health, education, and
pensions. Asked if the Government should increase taxes and spend more on
health, education, and social benefits, 32% said yes in 1983 compared with 58%
in 1994.
Although health as a priority for spending started to decline over the 10 years
the report covers, dissatisfaction with the NHS resulted in the trend
reversing. In 1983 74% saw it as top priority, compared with 60% in 1993, and
72% in 1994.
The report found that people were unconvinced by official claims that the poor
are benefiting from rising living standards and is aware of the growth in
inequality over the past decade. Only 25% of those polled thought the poor
lived in need as the result of ``laziness or lack of willpower'', whereas one
in three endorsed the notion that it was due to ``injustice in our society''.
Fear of Crime:
FOR young women their fears about personal safety are linked to the
availability of pornography, while for elderly women fear of crime is most
strongly associated with unease about change in society in general. For elderly
men it is linked to other worries, such      as about their health. What
emerged was that fear of crime was a problem in itself, as           opposed to
being part and         parcel of problems about crime in general.
This casts doubt on whether reducing the fear of crime is something a
government can realistically aim to do. The   only appropriate way to reduce
fear is to cut crime itself by tackling the problem head on and adopting even
more vigorous measures.
Libertarianism in retreat?
ONE of the cornerstones of the British legal system is that the accused is
innocent until proved guilty. Asked whether it was worse to convict an innocent
person, or let a guilty one go free 20% chose the second option in 1985, 24% in
1994, while the don't knows rose from 12% to 18%. While libertarians may be
reassured, the report says the signs are that the cornerstone is beginning to
crumble.
Public support for the reintroduction of the death penalty also remains solid,
with three in five wanting it for all murders. In their eighth report,
following a series of miscarriages of justice, SCPR reckoned this support would
be dented, but they admit they were wrong. ``It seems that public support for
the death penalty is already at an irreducible minimum,'' they conclude.
People are more ready to cede powers to the police, resistance to the use of
surveillance cameras, for instance, having fallen.
q-In 1990 55% said they should be used to detect speeding drivers, in 1994 it
was 70% and there was a similar rise in favour of their use on housing estates
to detect vandals.
q-In 1990 37% were in favour of the introduction of identity cards, 40%
against. The balance is now two to one in favour, 53% as against 26%.
q-Public lack of confidence in the courts has risen from 79% who felt criminals
were getting off too lightly in 1990 to 86% in 1994, and the evidence emerging
is that the more hawkish stance taken by both the Government and Opposition
towards crime is in tune with public sentiment.
q-People have changed their minds about the right of peaceful protest. Asked in
1985 about holding meetings, 59% said they should be allowed. That has fallen
to 48% in 1994, and this is considered ``hardly reassuring'' from a libertarian
point of view.
q-Asked in 1994 if a rich person was more likely to be found guilty of a crime
only 2% agreed, whereas 66% thought if the person was poor they would be found
guilty, 10% up on 1990.
q-It found there was still a good deal of public sympathy for righting wrongs
on behalf of ethnic minorities, with 39% feeling we had not gone far enough in
giving equal opportunities to Asians and others of different ethnic origins.
Travelling people also fared well, with 44% thinking there should be more sites
provided, but homosexuals and lesbians get a raw deal, with 46% thinking things
have gone too far, 18% not far enough.
Growing distrust of, and public apathy about, politics and politicians:
THE sceptical electorate is alive and well. It seems that the British public is
losing whatever confidence it had in its politicians, and fewer than one in
four voters believe British governments of any party place the national
interest above their party's interest.
The monarchy:
WHEN they last asked the question in 1983 the results showed such overwhelming
support the SCPR thought there was little point in including questions again.
But it now finds that in the intervening 11 years there has been a change in
attitudes. Two-thirds still want to retain a monarchy, but in 1983 two in three
people believed it was important to keep the monarchy, now only one in three
take this view.
``The public's long-standing passion for its royal family has distinctly
cooled,'' the report concludes. ``While it is still regarded by the public as
comfortably the safest constitutional option available, it is perhaps no longer
seen as indispensable.''

Macbeth, Greenwich Theatre, London
MARK Rylance's production of Macbeth is his first staging of a Shakespeare play
since The Globe announced his appointment as their artistic director. Rylance
is also artistic director of Thoebus Cart which is producing his current vision
of Macbeth. He and his company have taken the non-traditional approach but in
this case their interpretation is misguided.
Duncan and his thanes are presented as a Hare Krishna-type sect and their power
struggles are set in that context. As a result the characters struggle. Only
Tim Barlow, as an excellent Porter, and Albie Woodington as Macduff, appear
comfortable. The weird sisters, played as dysfunctional youths, add nothing to
the play. Mark Rylance plays Macbeth as a hesistant and gauche American
introvert. Jane Horrocks's Lady Macbeth lacks the steely quality necessary to
convince us that she could persuade her husband to kill Duncan.
While it could be interesting to explore why religion can inspire murder, and
sects can be riven by power politics, Shakespeare does not provide the words to
enable Macbeth to be the vehicle for that exploration. Mark Rylance is an
exceptionally fine actor and only this quality keeps the audience in their
seats.

Professor James W McGilvray, economist and academic; born February 21, 1938,
died November 19, 1995
JAMES McGilvray was born in Glasgow in 1938, and educated at Kelvinside Academy
and later at St Columba's College near Dublin. He grew up at Huntershill House
in Bishopbriggs, earlier the home of Thomas Muir, the exiled reformer; much of
his childhood was spent in the company of his mother's family in Ireland.
In 1960 he graduated with honours in economics from Edinburgh University and
took up a lectureship at Trinity College, Dublin, where he remained for nine
years. Following a year spent at Harvard on a research fellowship, where he
worked with the Nobel Laureate Wassilly Leontief, he was appointed as senior
lecturer in economics at Stirling University.
In 1975 he and I were appointed to the foundation posts of research director
and director respectively, at the newly established Fraser and Allander
Institute at Strathclyde University. His first major assignment there was to
lead the tripartite team, drawn from IBM, the Scottish Council (Development &amp;
Industry), and the Fraser of Allander Institute itself, which in 1979 completed
the compilation of the first ever set of input/output tables for Scotland.
Responsibility for the production of these tables on a regular basis has now
been adopted by the Government. He was also the founder and first editor of the
Institute's Quarterly Economic Commentary, and established the
subscription-based Business Forecasting Service.
At the same time he led the institute's team in a development project in
Morocco, the first of many such projects he was to lead over the next 15 years
in countries ranging from Egypt and Jordan to Angola and Albania. These
projects were typically funded by the World Bank, the United Nations
Development Programme, and the European Commission.
In 1985 to 1988 he took leave of absence to direct the economics division of a
London-based international consulting company, thereby deepening and widening
his experience of the practical application of economics to the problems of
developing countries.
Being responsible for the management as well as the technical content of a wide
range of collaborative projects stood him in good stead when he returned to
Strathclyde University. He became joint director of the university's Overseas
Development Services Office, which acts as a link between the university and
international development agencies in the provision of research. consultancy,
and training services.
From August 1991 to July 1994 he was head of the Department of Economics, and
in August 1993 was appointed vice-dean for Research of the Strathclyde Business
School Faculty.
A recent assignment from the European Commission to survey the functioning of
the official statistical offices in several Eastern European countries, led him
to throw his weight behind the proposal to establish a Centre for European
Economies in Transition.
As well as all these activities, he found the time to write a number of books
on economics and statistics. Only a few days before he died, he completed the
preface of a book jointly written with two colleagues on Natural Resources and
Environmental Economics.
He leaves behind his wife, Alison, his son and daughter, and his mother, who
lives in Dublin, and very many friends throughout the world.

Roy Rogers explains why motor manufacturing employees are ready
again to flex their industrial muscle
FORD and Vauxhall car workers threatening industrial action after rejecting
inflation-busting pay offers against a background of recurring strikes by
Scottish posties and Merseyside firefighters may give the impression that
another ``winter of discontent'' is in the offing.
In fact, Ford and Vauxhall workers are most unlikely to embark on strike
action, the post and fire disputes remain localised even though they involve
national issues, and the overall rate of days lost through strike action
remains at a historical low.
Scottish postal workers are incensed at what they see as Post Office attempts
to undermine second deliveries prior to axing jobs. There is nothing new in
Communications Workers Union members fighting for services and jobs, but on
this occasion they have jumped the gun by walking out before a strike ballot
has been completed.
What is new is that the resurgence of the British motor industry has meant that
car workers feel more confident in their futures and therefore better able to
challenge what they see as the inequities in their sector.
Union officials have decided that the time is ripe to win concessions on hours
for Ford and Vauxhall employees who still work a 39-hour week when their Ford
and General Motors counterparts get paid more for working a 35-hour week in
Germany, workers at Ford's Jaguar subsidiary receive higher wages for operating
a 37-hour week as do employees of Rover Group and Rolls-Royce Motors.
Nissan and Toyota have let it be known that they will follow any Ford-Vauxhall
concessions on hours and Peugeot Talbot would have little choice but to follow
suit.
The unions therefore are keen to bring the rest of the motor manufacturing
industry into line with the bulk of the engineering industry which is already
on a 37-hour week as a result of the highly successful shorter working week
campaign waged by the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions five
years ago.
The CSEU, which has a #10m ``war chest'' left over from the confrontation, is
poised to reopen that campaign in order to mop up any remaining areas of
resistance to 37 hours before seeking to press for further reductions.
So, after years of being in the doldrums during which the UK car industry has
become highly competitive, mainly through having to compete with new
Japanese-owned UK plants, British car workers who had the reputation for
walking out at the drop of a hat in the 70s, feel that once again they can at
least flex their industrial muscles.
Even so, Vauxhall workers are only talking about banning overtime and leaving
two hours early on Fridays and union negotiators are by no means confident of
winning a strike mandate from Ford workers even though several thousands walked
out on unofficial stoppages last week.
National officials including Scottish AEEU councillor Jimmy Airlie and TGWU
national secretary Tony Woodley are expected to tour the Ford plants before an
industrial action ballot is called.
It remains to be seen whether their powers of persuasion can produce a strike
mandate sufficent to convince Ford of the need to concede reduced hours. It
appears most unlikely but, even if thwarted this time round, the unions will
certainly be back pressing for shorter hours when negotiations become due again
in two years' time. The issue will not go away and at some stage the company
will have to face up to conceding shorter hours or facing a dispute.
A winter of discontent therefore appears most unlikely this time round although
one may not be far off as dissatisfaction builds among Britain's 1.5 million
local government workers who have seen their pay restricted by Government
ruling for the past five years and who can expect no respite under this
Government.
The local authority unions, which bore most of the blame for the 1978-9
``winter of discontent'' which was seen as ushering in the ``Thatcher years'',
have yet to be convinced that things would be any better under Labour however.
Labour leader Tony Blair has been told of the likelihood of a dust up over
local authority pay either in the run in to the next General Election or soon
after it. Either way it could spell deep embarrassment for Labour, although
according to union sources Labour has no policy on public sector pay as yet.
A substantial claim is due       to be lodged soon on behalf of the 1.5 million
blue and white-collar local authority staff who come together this year for the
first common claim for a common April 1 pay date.
With a total pay bill of #7.3 billion, some 85% of which comes from central
government, the local authority negotiations are by far the largest and
therefore most significant.
About 350,000 currently earn less than the #4.15 an hour minimum expected to
figure in the unions' demand - with many cleaners and catering staff on just
#3.71 an hour which would require increases of up to 11.8%. It is estimated
that it would cost some 3% on the total pay bill just to bring everybody up to
the #4.15 minimum.
A ``winter of discontent'' is forecast - but probably not this winter.

AM disappointed with the photo caption that appeared on the arts page of The

refer to the homeless as vagrants. I wish to make it clear that I did not use

I am happy with the coverage which the Beat Poets have received over the years
but feel disappointed that The Herald is happy to use such a loaded phrase.

IMAGES of restriction, images of endurance - and ultimately the image of an
inner resilience than can transcend the rigours that beset the physical self.
These are the core themes of Runner, a new project which Marisa Zanotti is
currently showing as a work-in-progress at the CCA.
The ideas started forming a couple of years back, while she was reading Brian
Keenan's autobiography, An Evil Cradling. Zanotti found herself translating his
description of the conditions he endured as a hostage into her own imagined
actuality - what kind of space, for instance, would give her small frame the
same sense of cooped-up oppression as his 6ft ; 4ft cell? What kind of
movements could you achieve to try to keep your body from packing up through
lack of exercise? And how would you keep your spirits from simply crumbling
into terminal despair?
Just over three weeks ago, she started putting together her material - solo
movement, selected music, a snatch of text, some video projections (by Bert
Ross), and, latterly, atmospheric lighting by Bob Pringle. Karen Grant sat in
as an ``outside eye'' to help shape a running order for the piece so far.
Results so far are both promising and effective.
Ross's projections add a stunning extra dimension, not least when a moving map
floods the floor while Zanotti strives to keep her balance - it's as if none of
us knows where we are, even as she tries to find her own place.
The after-show discussion was a useful, informal exchange which probably
encouraged her even as it gave the audience valuable insights into the process
of devising. Running is already worth seeing in its beginning form - repeated
tonight, with hopes of the complete work showing next May.

Sergei Grinkov, skater; born February 4, 1967, died November 20, 1995
RUSSIAN Olympic champion figure skater Sergei Grinkov suffered from severe
heart disease that led to his fatal heart attack on the ice-rink at Lake
Placid, New York on Monday.
Grinkov, 28, had a history of high blood pressure and the twice Olympic
champion suffered from severe arteriosclerosis, according to Dr Francis Varga.
``In an athletic, vigorous young person who is asymptomatic, it is hard to
detect these problems,'' said Dr Varga. ``Sudden death is often the first sign
of heart disease. Unless there is an abnormality that causes pain, there is no
way to detect this.''
He was practising with his wife, Ekaterina Gordeeva, 24, for a figure skating
exhibition on Saturday in the professional Stars On Ice tour.
The two had skated together since he was 15 and she was 11 years old. In the
early years the disparity in their sizes (she was then under 5ft and weighed
less than six stones) produced a certain incongruity in their appearance. But
there were compensations. Katya could easily be lifted overhead with one hand
or thrown into spectacular jumps.
Grinkov and Gordeeva were Olympic pairs champions in 1988 and 1994. They also
won four world championships, two European titles, and the Soviet national
championships as amateurs. Having turned professional in 1990 and subsequently
married, they had competed in professional championships, but then - like
Britain's Torvill and Dean - took advantage of the decision of the
International Olympic Committee to allow professionals to skate in the 1994
Winter Olympic Games.
The Grinkovs brought pairs figure skating to new artistic and athletic heights
with powerful lifts and stunning throws executed to music as varied as Mozart,
Beethoven, and honkey-tonk.
They lived with their three-year-old daughter Daria in Simsbury, Connecticut,
and in Moscow.

COULD I make one or two observations on your editorial, Traffic-island airport
(November 14). The decline in this summer's traffic at Glasgow Airport is now
well researched and known.
The withdrawal of United and Northwest Airlines would, all other things being
equal, have reduced the passenger growth at Glasgow Airport by 1% to 2%. That
was our forecast last year and was achieved in April to June.
Since then two other factors have come into play. Detailed passenger surveys
show that some passengers have transferred from Glasgow Airport to Edinburgh
Airport because of road congestion. By far the most important influence has
been the decline in the holiday traffic. Your newspaper has accurately reported
the tribulations of the tour operators this summer - and these certainly have
not been leaves on the line.
As well as Glasgow Airport the other main holiday charter airports in the UK
have shown identical decline in passengers - for example Manchester Airport's
international traffic was down 4.2% last month. In fact the last two weeks of
October were level pegging and the first two weeks of November have seen
Glasgow Airport back into growth.
But the key issue of your editorial must not go unanswered. There are no
grounds for complacency over the surface transport problems in Glasgow and we
welcome your support.

SHOULD the money of licence payers go on programmes focused on the internal
warring in the House of Windsor? With an autonomous Scottish Broadcasting
Corporation there could have been an opt-out of such trivia. The question as to
whether there should be a non-payment of the TV licence in protest against the
squandering of money ought to merit consideration.

Theatre
MEG RYAN eat your heart out; Paul Blair's opening orgasm scene might not be as
pretty as the Hollywood starlet's number in the deli but it's certainly more
convincing. Despite the graphic content of the play there's no on-stage nudity
but nineties lads are laid bare none the less. Anthony Neilson's superbly
crafted play thrusts into the male psyche with a rigour and insight which is by
turns hilarious and horrific but always compulsive.
As an exploration of the point when the bonds of male friendship turn into
manacles, either corporeal ones through physical intimidation or spiritual ones
through emotional betrayal, it's a devastating account. An evening of banter
between Max (Blair) and his flatmate Alan (Joel Strachan) is transformed when
Max's childhood friend, the squaddie Tadge, turns up with a maniacal account of
persecution, paranoia, and rape at the hands of the so-called ``penetrators''.
The quick-witted humour, flecked with masculine defensiveness of the opening
scenes - which includes an excellent description of dance music as being ``a
three-hour record which sounded like a mixture of international dialling
codes'' - slowly dissolves into an atmosphere of intimidation, as Tadge imposes
a threatening presence. But the real weapon he brings is not the terrifying
machete he carelessly brandishes but the candour of a ravaged mind - forcing
the others into an unwanted exploration of their homosexual and homophobic
desires.
John Kazek delivers an outstanding performance, physically and mentally adroit
at portraying the febrile tension and occasional vulnerability of a psychotic,
while Blair and Strachan offer stolid support in a production directed and
designed by Peter Mackie Bruns which speaks directly, if brutally, to a young
generation.

University status
IT was interesting to read the excellent article by Barclay McBain on the story
of Strathclyde University (November 18).
However, I would like to correct a statement about the actual process of
acquiring university status.
The mistake in his article is made by members of staff of the university and as
the person involved from start to finish I would like to put the record
straight in The Herald as this might finally correct the error.
The University Grants Committee, represented by Sir Keith Murray, took the view
in 1960 that there was no need to make us a university. I fought my case
strenuously and early in 1961 Sir Keith (now Lord Murray) said his committee
had unanimously agreed the Royal College in Glasgow should proceed to request
formally university status.
His committee could virtually guarantee the Privy Council would give us a royal
charter and statutes and he asked me to start writing them. Early in 1962 an
official announcement was made that government had accepted the case for
university status for the Royal College.
It should be noted Glasgow was the first British city to win the privilege of
having a second university. Murray urged me to continue to build strength in
arts and social sciences, where we were making rapid progress.
There was never any condition about ``merging'' with the Scottish College of
Commerce. However the director of that college, Dr Eric Thomson, asked me to
absorb the Scottish College in the Royal College if I could.
So it was a case of absorbing into the Royal College, already sure in its own
right of university status. There was, in fact, a need to persuade the
University Grants Committee, representing the Government, that the Scottish
College of Commerce could be successfully swallowed.
The point I am anxious to make is that the Royal College as such was already
simply waiting for its charter and statutes to be blessed by Privy Council and
the absorption of the Scottish College was a separate step in its process of
growth.
The process of swallowing was difficult but achieved by the Royal College as
Strathclyde over some years.
Privy Council was slow in passing the charter because it hoped to take into
account some ideas of Lord Robbins but no reference to Robbins was asked of the
Royal College.
Robbins advocated others should do what the Royal had done and intended to do.
So Strathclyde became a university on its own and after some time, and partly
with help from Robbins, a number of colleges of advanced technology and science
were given university status.

THERE can hardly be a person in the land who
A senior official in a children's charity reminded us yesterday that adults
must learn to listen to children, especially when they give out signals which
may suggest problems within their family. Paedophiles, she said with utter
truth, are very plausible people. We should remember that the West murders were
discovered only when an alert social worker took seriously a remark made by a
child and reported the ensuing suspicions to police. Thankfully that was one
social worker who refused to be intimidated into silence by the habitual abuse
meted out to that most beleaguered of professions by the tabloid media and
certain politicians. Nevertheless, the lessons which must be learned from the
West case are of particular relevance to health and care agencies who must
always be willing to accept that procedures and practices require constant
updating in the light of experience.
In the particular case of the West family it is clear that school, health, and
social services officials were involved on several occasions with a variety of
the West children. These included incidents of some seriousness, such as
grossly inappropriate health problems for young children, evidence of assault,
and the removal from school of a child still of school age. A criminal court
merely fined the Wests for the serious indecent assault of a teenage lodger and
nobody in the legal system saw the need to pass the results to those who would
investigate further. In retrospect there is an abundance of evidence that much
was wrong in the West household, but that the procedures at the time were
insufficient to ensure that information was circulated between the relevant
agencies.
It is by no means clear that this is a problem which has been solved. It is
true that child protection procedures in the early 1970s were rudimentary
compared with those of today; it is also the fact that the various health and
care agencies and the police were only instructed to work together after the
Cleveland report in 1988, by which time the dreadful events in the West
household had already taken place. Yet it remains the case that few care
professionals today would express complete satisfaction with existing liaison
procedures between relevant agencies. Nor is there yet a sufficient recognition
of the fact that children must be listened to and taken seriously when they
give hints of dark areas in their lives.
What, then, must we make of our society in the light of the West case? It is
the job of government to craft and mould the legislation and practices and to
provide the resources for the various agencies which try to protect society.
There are many areas in which government social legislation can be criticised
over the past two decades; from the notorious assertion that there is no such
thing as society (meant sincerely, whether quoted in or out of context) to the
modern fixation for blaming single mothers, foreigners, and benefits cheats for
the manifest failure of social policy.
Yet in the West case government stands innocent: there are limits to what a
government can do and it is one of the silliest mistakes to blame a few
disparate individuals in Westminster for evils which are hardly capable of
being prevented by the passage of legislation. There is a responsibility which
must be borne by all of us; it rests in the growing lack of community feeling
which separates the sinews and bones of society, one from the other. The West
case reminds us that there are countless missing persons in this small country,
many of them vulnerable youngsters; how can this be? Neighbours turn a blind
eye to the abuse of children and old folk in their own street, whether it be
physical abuse or cold neglect, and the harshness and self-seeking aspects of
our society become daily more evident. Of course we must keep these criticisms
in balance, but will anyone deny their truth? The West case can indeed be a
learning experience for all of us, but only if we are willing to learn.

THE compensation payments to four Glasgow University animal laboratory workers
who contracted asthma raises several questions (November 21).
If conditions in the animal house adversely affected the staff how can we know
that those conditions did not affect the animals and the results of the
experiments in which they were used?
Was this situation unique to Glasgow University or are we about to see a flood
of compensation claims from workers in other laboratories, poultry farms, and
the like?
If, as claimed by one of the injured workers, Government officials carried out
regular welfare checks on the animals, why was their welfare compromised by
allowing researchers to experiment on them and then kill them? The answer to
these questions is fairly simple. If the animals were affected by dusty
conditions it is likely that would affect the results of experiments they were
used in. At #50,000 a shot it is very likely that more claims will follow.
Government inspectors from the Home Office only ensure animals are used within
the boundaries of the 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act which allows
animals to suffer pain, stress, and death.
