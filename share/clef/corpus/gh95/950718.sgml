SAILING
APPROPRIATELY, it was the Clyde Cruising Club's Tobermory race's most
seasoned campaigner, Ivanhoe, which won yesterday's second leg race from
Crinan to Tobermory. The evergreen Class 4 Jolina owned by Douglas
Steedman has reputedly missed only one such race in living memory.
The early start, coinciding with a 4am dawn to catch the tide, found
Crinan awake to a brisk easterly breeze which allowed spinnakers to be
set from the start line out through the Dorus Mhor. Despite the wind
moving slightly ahead, the big coloured reaching sails were held
virtually until the turn into the Sound of Mull.
There, off Duart Castle as is the norm for this race, the wind
departed and the whole 46-boat fleet compressed into a milling
stationary mass. Only two boats, Jack McIntyre's First 42 Thornoxon and
Frank Lee's First Class Europe Mr Vain, successfully escaped the doldrum
to a life-blood breeze on the Morven shore -- Thornoxon going on to win
Class 1.
The wind filled from the south to bring up the slower rated boats to
the sterns of their quicker rivals and the final results in many classes
simply reflect a reversal of handicap order, the slower boats taking a
healthy share of the honours. Results:
Class 1 -- 1, Thornoxon (A McIntyre) 8hr 39min 46sec; 2, Jus Do It (I
Darby) 8-42.10; 3, Moonshine (J and P Fowler) 8-44.22. Overall -- 1, Jus
Do It.
Class 2 -- 1, High Pointer (N McClure) 7-50.26; 2, Saboo (J and M
McIlraith) 8-04.10; 3, Jomora (A and J Robertson) 8-12.35. Overall -- 1,
High Pointer.
Class 3 -- 1, Victric (I Abernethy) 6-26.08; 2, Hydro Vane (J W Currie
and Sir D Miller) 6-29.33; 3, Kerrymaid (A McCallum) 6-31.00. Overall --
1, Victric.
Class 4 -- 1, Ivanhoe (D Steedman) 5-50.31; 2, Qu'appelle (I S
McLellan) 6-04.53; 3, Pointer (B Robertson) 6-11.43. Overall -- 1,
Ivanhoe.
Class 5 -- 1, Arabella (J Kennedy) 7-08.01; 2, Sea Quin (M Broadbent)
7-08.08; 3, Significant (R Wilson) 7-15.40. Overall -- 1, Arabella.
Class 6 -- 1, Alpha Deuteron (A D Horne) 6-42.11; 2, Orrkid (A Orr)
6-47.02; 3, Tara (A Angus) 6-51.03. Overall -- 1, Orrkid.

RUGBY
WIGAN and Leeds yesterday emerged as leading contenders to sign All
Black superstar Jonah Lomu -- if he decides to turn professional --
after Auckland Warriors withdrew their offer to the wing.
Auckland chief executive Ian Robson said his club would not be used to
inflate the offers being made to the 20-year-old.
''We've been dealing with Lomu's agents for quite some time,'' Robson
said. ''But we're looking to the future and we don't want to overlook
other opportunities by committing resources to signing Jonah.
''We honestly don't want to be used to talk up the dollars being
offered by other clubs.''
Wigan and Leeds are both reported to have offered #2m
three-and-a-half-year contracts to Lomu. Sheffield have expressed an
interest and Sydney Bulldogs also have made an offer to Lomu, who
currently is preparing for the first of the All Blacks' two Bledisloe
Cup matches against Australia in Auckland on Saturday.
He has committed himself to completing this season in rugby union
before considering a switch. All Blacks coach Laurie Mains is confident
Lomu will continue to play union, and the New Zealand RFU have offered
All Black squad members lucrative contracts.

ATHLETICS
FIVE Scots were included when Great Britain's team for the World
Championships was announced yesterday, but this represents the nadir for
Scottish men's athletics. For all five were female, and if David Strang
cannot kick open the door left tentatively ajar -- he will be added if
he achieves the 800 metres qualifying standard -- then this will be only
the second time in 91 years that there has been no male representation
at world or Olympic level.
Scotland's reigning and former Commonwealth 10,000 metres champions,
Yvonne Murray and Liz McColgan, are set for their first meeting since
May 1993, over 25 laps in Gothenburg, with McColgan bidding to retrieve
the crown which she won so gloriously in Tokyo four years ago.
Murray, who took the AAA 1500m title in Birmingham at the weekend, is
in outstanding shape, says the UK coaching director, Malcolm Arnold, and
he has high medal hopes for her and and Kelly Holmes, who has been
allowed the unique chance to double at 800 and 1500m in Sweden next
month.
City of Glasgow's Melanie Neef, winner of the Scottish and AAA 400m
titles this year, is the only nominee for the women's one-lap event. But
world and Olympic hurdles champion Sally Gunnell, one of 13 athletes who
must prove their competitive fitness by Sunday, may join Neef in the
flat 400 as well as the relay.
''I hope Sally makes it,'' said Neef. ''She has said that if she does,
she will not run the final leg in the relay, and that I will have to do
it. I'm not sure I fancy that responsibility. Sally is the best on the
anchor.''
Allison Rose (Edinburgh Woollen Mill) and Trudi Thomson (Babcock
Pitreavie) had already been nominated for the marathon -- indeed, with
Karen Macleod also doing the marathon, Scottish women had a monopoly of
the entry. But a foot problem has forced Macleod out, and a replacement
may yet be named.
Arrangements are being made for Strang, European indoor 1500m
champion, but runner-up to Curtis Robb over two laps at the weekend, to
run in Oslo and Sheffield next weekend in the hope of achieving the
qualifying time of 1min 46.5sec.
Tom McKean, a member of every world and Olympic team since 1987, and
Brian Whittle are considering their futures in the sport. McKean, more
distressed by his AAA failure even than some of his major championship
upsets, deserves a better finish to his career, and Whittle echoed his
sentiments, saying: ''I'd rather go out on my own terms than now.''

THE golfer with sore feet may be more obviously at a disadvantage than
one with a sore head as he hirples about the course, and anyway,
hangovers are rather less likely to affect the form of Spain's Jose
Maria Olazabal and Seve Ballesteros than the affliction that has been
identified as something called Morton's Syndrome.
This is not the recurrence of a boardroom crisis at Cappielow, but a
sort of callous between the toes, and anyone who has worn shoes that
pinch will appreciate the bothersome effect any similar discomfort will
have on the swing and concentration of a professional golfer trying to
win the Open Championship.
Yesterday, in his first practice round in preparation for the start on
Thursday, Olazabal, last year's US Masters champion, was still in some
discomfort -- not surprising, since, apart from hitting practice balls
on two successive days last week, this was Olazabal's first serious
outing in the last three weeks.
In 11 previous Opens, Olazabal's best finish was third, three years
ago at Muirfield, presumably the reason why, besides his present
resemblance to a member of the walking wounded squad that the bookmakers
have installed him at the odds of 25-1 which otherwise would be
laughably generous.
Rather as the man who said that it was a relief when he stopped
hitting his head against a wall because the pain went away, Olazabal
said wryly: ''Although I've had rest and taken anti-inflammatory drugs,
the foot only feels okay when I don't play at all. I'll just have to
wait and see how the next day or so goes.
''I won't have an operation before the Ryder Cup, even although that
could involve me in 36 holes for the first two days,'' added Olazabal,
who is 29. ''The toe surgery I had in February has been effective; the
problem now is on another part of my foot. I must be getting old -- two
many tournaments, too much practice, too few women.''
Be that as it may, Olazabal who first confronted the Old course in
1984, the year Ballesteros won his second Open title, is another in the
long line of distinguished sceptics whose courtship by the links began
with a little aversion. ''The more you play it, the more you like it,''
he said and then picked up his compatriot's appreciation of the
seventeenth, the alarming Road hole.
''The blind drive does not inspire confidence and the narrow green
makes the second shot treacherous'' -- precisely what Ballesteros might
have said had he not made the memorable par 4 to which Tom Watson,
attempting the rare feat of winning the championship for three
consecutive years, had no answer.
Needless to say, Ballesteros has vivid memories of that occasion,
especially the No.6-iron which flew out of rough 210 yards to 25ft,
''the precise second'' which Watson, who pushed a No.2-iron over the
road beyond the green, could not match, but which he stubbornly
continues to insist was the right club for him.
Apart from, and probably because of his foot and back ailments,
Ballesteros, who twice failed to break 80 at Carnoustie last week, is
trying to be philosophical about the difficult times he is going
through. ''Life is full of ups and downs and just now I'm going through
a down,'' he reflected.
''Golf means a lot to me, but not everything,'' Ballesteros continued.
''Things are not that terrible as long as they only affect my golf. I'm
just not comfortable with my game and my confidence is low,'' a state of
affairs reflected in his 50-1 odds. ''But I still love the game because
it's given me everything I have.''
At 38, Ballesteros is in his twenty-first full season on the European
tour, where he has had 54 victories and 17 others worldwide, so that a
back complaint is only to be expected.
Both Olazabal and Ballesteros had experienced the exhilaration of
winning, and also being in contention for major titles before Davis Love
had even finished in the first 10 of a championship. This he has at last
achieved this season -- indeed, twice, for he was runner up to Ben
Crenshaw in the Masters and joint fourth behind Corey Pavin in the US
Open.
Having for the first time been so involved at the climax, Love, at
33-1, might be very well worth a consideration. He thinks the Open,
accommodates his game better than the three other majors, and the Old
course above the other championship tests in Britain because ''you can
give it a rip.
''The USGA's six-inch rough keeps the driver in your bag, and the
greens at the Masters and the US PGA are reliable to be scary,'' he
added. ''I think the Open is the biggest tournament in the world -- more
international players, more history make it special.''
There is also a personal and sentimental reason for Love's preference.
In 1969, Tony Jacklin's year, Love's father finished equal sixth
alongside Jack Nicklaus. Later a highly regarded teacher, he was killed
in an air crash five years ago and his regard for the championship has
passed on to his son, for whom victory this week would, for obvious
reasons, be particularly cherished.
Meanwhile, the Amateur Champion, Gordon Sherry, and the European
Amateur Champion, Stephen Gallacher, gave a good account of themselves
in a practice match against Irish Open champion Sam Torrance and Carl
Mason, last year's Scottish Open champion. Playing level, the
professionals won by 2 and 1, but the amateurs at least took the last
hole to square the inward half.
* GARY Player the third professional in history after Gene Sarazen and
Ben Hogan, to win the world's four major championships, will receive the
honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from St Andrews University at a
special graduation ceremony in the Younger Hall this morning.
Player has won more than 150 tournaments worldwide. The only other to
have been so honoured is Jack Nicklaus, the fourth player to capture the
four titles, who received his degree 11 years ago.

BRITISH bookmakers could lose more than #1m if Nick Faldo wins his
fourth Open crown at St Andrews. His odds have been slashed from 10-1 to
7-1 favourite by William Hill, whose spokesman Graham Sharpe said: ''He
looked ominously good the longer the Scottish Open went on, and he is
being heavily backed.
''If he gets off to a good start our liabilities will soar and his
fans could collect a sum well into seven figures from the nation's
bookies.''
Ladbrokes expect to handle #1million in bets on the Open, which
equates to a #5million betting spree. They have Faldo at 8-1 favourite
with Colin Montgomerie having come down from 25-1 to 16-1. Latest
leading odds:
William Hill -- 7-1 Faldo, 8-1 Norman, 10-1 Montgomerie, 12-1 Langer,
14-1 Price, 16-1 Els. Ladbrokes -- 8-1 Faldo, 9-1 Norman, 12-1 Langer,
16-1 Price, Montgomerie, Els.
* TOM Lehman yesterday became the fourth all exempt player to withdraw
from the Open Championship. His wife Melissa is about to give birth to
their third child and so Lehman, runner up in last year's Masters and
third in last month's US Open, followed Fred Couples, Hale Irwin and
Fuzzy Zoeller out of the event.
However, 57 of the first 62 in the Sony world rankings are among the
exempt players. The Australian, Peter Senior, although forty-ninth,
failed to qualify in several categories, but took part in the final
competition for one of the 49 places.
* A REPORT just published claims that 88% of the golf courses built in
the #1.5b construction boom of the 1980s in the United Kingdom are
potentially in financial danger. In just five years, 388 new layouts
were built from more than 2000 planning applications submitted by
developers and land owners.
According to the Golf Research Group, 14 courses are in receivership
but there is no lack of bargains. Last years 24 courses changed hands
for #60m and as far as the future is concerned, golfers previously put
off by waiting lists, handicap requirements, and high joining fees
should try again as most developments are looking for members.
* ROADWORKS on the A8000, the single carriageway link to the Forth
Bridge, are expected to cause delays during peak hours to traffic
heading for the Open championship. Fife police advise golf spectators to
avoid the road at these times.

ALLY McCoist will be fit for Rangers' opening assault on Europe, when
they face Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta at Ibrox on August 9. And,
as a bonus, the veteran striker could also be fit for the Ibrox
pre-season tournament on July 29 and 30.
Yesterday at Ibrox, manager Walter Smith confirmed that McCoist, who
has missed most of the last two seasons through injury, would not make
the pre-season tour of Denmark which begins on Friday.
''He has a gash on his left knee and it is in an awkward position
which means it will take time to heal,'' said Smith. ''Therefore, he
will stay at home while we head to Denmark for the three matches we have
arranged there.
''But he will may be all right for the tournament and will certainly
make the opening European Cup tie.''
Meanwhile, at Parkhead, Celtic will take Tom Boyd and Phil O'Donnell
on their German tour when they leave on Thursday although both remain
doubtful for playing roles after having close-season operations.
Manager Tommy Burns, still seeking a big-name signing for the club,
explained last night: ''Neither Tom nor Phil have recovered completely
after their operations. However, we will take them with us but give them
time to see if they can play or not.''
Celtic supporters face a ticket problem for their two games in
England, following their four-game warm-up programme in Germany.
The Parkhead side will face Birmingham on July 29 when only 4500
tickets will be available to the Celtic fans. And on August 1 at
Goodison, when Celtic play a testimonial match for Neville Southall,
just 7000 tickets will be sold to the Scottish fans.
On Tayside, Dundee United manager Billy Kirkwood signed another new
player when Neil Caldwell, freed by Rangers at the end of the season,
accepted a one-year deal at Tannadice.

Aberdeen and Rangers, meanwhile, are nowhere near reaching a

ATHLETICS:
COLIN Jackson and British athletics chiefs yesterday embarked on a
collision course which could explode in their faces, preventing the
European and Commonwealth hurdles champion from defending his world
title in Gothenburg next month, and leading to a rift between him and
Malcolm Arnold, the man who coached him to the world record.
Jackson sparked fury among officials, fans, and sponsors by his
withdrawal from the KP AAA Championships at the weekend, yet was
conditionally included in the UK world squad announced yesterday. He and
12 other leading competitors who failed to fulfil their obligations in
Birmingham have until next Sunday to confirm their places by
demonstrating fitness.
Jackson abandoned the 100 metres after one round at the AAA event,
pleading injury, then raced in Italy on Sunday for a reputed $35,000 in
a miraculous return to form. But yesterday he returned home to Wales
insisting that he will not compete again before the championships begin
in Sweden a fortnight on Saturday.
His response will almost inevitably be construed as defiance of the
British Athletic Federation: demanding they send him on the strength of
his reputation.
Jackson's agent and the federation have only just resolved a stand-off
over appearance fees for racing in Britain this year.
Following Jackson's nomination, professor Peter Radford, the executive
chairman of the BAF, launched an astonishing and unprecedented attack on
the selectors' decision, demanding a fundamental review of how the team
is chosen.
Radford, former professor of sports science at Glasgow University,
highlights a serious rift within a sport struggling to retain control of
its competitors, and the tone of his criticism will make it difficult
for David Cropper, chairman of the selection committee, to continue in
office.
''After the events of the weekend, the selectors have made what I
believe to be some questionable decisions,'' said Radford. ''I do not
believe these decisions are correct. Nor do I believe it is in the best
interests of the sport, or the other athletes, to select athletes for
the world championships who do not compete fully in the championship
trials, and whose fitness is still so obviously an issue.''
Radford believes spaces should have been left in the team without
actually nominating Jackson, and others such as world No.1 triple jumper
Jon Edwards, 400m runner Roger Black, or former world javelin
record-holder Steve Backley.
''I have communicated my views to the chairman of selectors, and will
contact the other members as soon as possible. Events of last weekend
have serious implications for the future of the championship/trials, and
for British athletics. In future, everyone in the sport -- athletes,
selectors, and administrators -- must recognise that their individual
actions can have a significant impact on the sport as a whole.''
Earlier, in questioning Jackson's behaviour, and the selectors'
failure to impose any disciplinary sanction, I had put precisely these
points to Cropper, a former international 800m runner.
But he appeared myopic, insisting it was the selectors' function
merely to pick the best team for Britain. ''We certainly cannot endorse
Jackson's action,'' said Cropper. ''But I don't think it is the remit of
the selectors -- the issue of bringing the sport into disrepute -- to
get into that debate.''
Radford who does not rule out disciplinary action, spoke to Jackson
yesterday, and they will meet face to face later this week.
Jackson countered Radford's allegations that he had sold ther sport
short. he claims he tried to talk to officials about going to Italy, but
could not, ''because they were in the VIP suite, making sure the
sponsors were kept happy.
''I felt a problem with my right adductor and was advised by my sports
masseuse to withdraw,'' said Jackson of his Birmingham defection.
''Having received intensive treatment, I decided to travel to Padua to
test the extent of the injury. While I was happy to win, I am concerned
with the continued problem, and have decided to withdraw from any
further competitions before the world championships in order to
concentrate fully on preparing to defend my title.''

OPEN QUALIFYING
THE finest moment of Gordon Law's golfing career turned into the
biggest nightmare yesterday when a debut in the Open championship at St
Andrews was taken away from him for what he called ''a triviality.''
The Scottish club pro shot a brilliant 66 to follow his opening 69 at
Lundin and was looking forward to lining up alongside Greg Norman, Jack
Nicklaus, and Arnold Palmer on Thursday. Then his world turned upside
down.
Law, the 30-year-old based at Uphall, near Livingston, was told he had
been disqualified for signing for a wrong score, as was his American
playing partner, Steve Reid. They had forgotten to look at the name on
the top of the scorecards. Although the figures they saw were what they
took, the cards were not theirs.
''I'm devastated,'' said Law. ''It would have been a dream come true
to play in the Open, especially as a club professional. I missed out by
one shot last year. I think it's pretty tough to be disqualified for
what I think is a triviality. The scores were right and the signatures
were in the right place.''
Then he explained how the mix-up came about. ''On the first tee in the
first round we were handed our own cards by the starter and we then
exchanged them in the normal way. For the second round there was a
different starter and he asked us whose card had we marked yesterday. So
we thought that was the card we were given.''
Financially, he lost #325 for what would have been a share of second
place at Lundin plus a minimum of #650 received by all those who miss
the halfway cut in the Open proper. All those who make the cut receive
at least #4000.
Former English amateur champion, Jon Langmead, from Devon, was also in
the group. He thought he had Law's card. In fact, it had Reid's name on
top.
Andrew Oldcorn, the Edinburgh-based Jersey Open winner, later came in
with a second successive 65 and with a 12-under-par total of 130 won by
five strokes from Warwickshire amateur Steve Webster and Wentworth's
Mark Nichols.
A total of seven Scots qualified. Cowal's Russell Weir came through at
Ladybank, Paisley's John Wither survived a play-off at Leven, and
Gleddoch's Dean Robertson continued his fine European Tour rookie year
by making the grade at Lundin where he was joined after a play-off by
Ross Drummond and Bill Longmuir. At Scotscraig, Paul Lawrie and Andrew
Crerar were successful.
Fourteen-year-old Justin Rose, the Hampshire schoolboy trying to
become the youngest player in the Open since John Ball in 1878, had a
one-under 70 at Scotscraig, but knew after his opening 73 that he had
little or no chance.
Former Ryder Cup pair Gordon Brand Jr and Christy O'Connor Jr also
failed. Brand's three-under 139 was not enough and O'Connor was one
stroke further back.
Scot Adam Hunter -- winner of the Portuguese Open in March -- lost out
at the third extra hole at Lundin, where 10 players were after eight
places. Hunter, Aberdeen-based Geordie Craig Cassells, and Australian
Peter Fowler were the last three alive, and Fowler settled it by
pitching to an inch for a birdie.
Pinner amateur Gary Clark qualified in the same play-off, making it
five amateurs in all in the Open. He and Webster join American champion
Tiger Woods, British champion Gordon Sherry, and European champion
Stephen Gallacher, who were all exempt. Qualifiers (British or Irish
unless stated), *denotes amateurs:

What the rules say
DOUGLAS LOWE writes: The mix-up involving Gordon Law at Lundin
yesterday is more than a triviality. It is a fundamental principle of
golf that the player, and no-one else, is responsible for the accuracy
of his scorecard whether in a club monthly medal or in the Open.
Rule 6 covers players' responsibilities and there can be no quibble in
Law's case. Even though it was an honest mistake, he signed for scores
that were not his.
Neither is it the first time such a situation has occurred because
Decision 6-6d/4 covers a similar instance. Disqualification is the only
possible outcome if just one score signed for at any hole is lower than
that actually taken (if higher, the higher score stands).
Having spent several hours on the course, it should be a matter of
routine to spend a few minutes more to check all details are in place.
Missing out on a tilt at the Open is a heavy, but correct price to pay
for such a mistake.

JUAN Manuel Fangio, widely regarded as the greatest racing driver of
all and also one of the most noble of men to grace the sport, died
yesterday in a Buenos Aires hospital. He was 84.
Fangio, who always said his record five world championships were down
to luck, had been suffering from kidney failure and was admitted to
hospital on Saturday after having contracted pneumonia.
The Argentinian dominated grand-prix racing in the 1950s, winning 24
of the 51 races he contested. But once, asked for the secret of his
success, he replied that ''75% of it is the car and the team around
it.'' He added: ''Only 25% is the driver . . . and much of that is to do
with luck. All my life I have been very lucky.''
Aggressive in the cockpit, Fangio was gentle, friendly, and likeable
off the track.
The son of a stonemason from a large family of Italian immigrants, he
started work as an apprentice mechanic at the age of 13. His racing
debut was made in a modified taxi on October 24, 1936, in a local race,
but he was 38 when he started his professional racing career in Europe
just after the war.
Alfa Romeo contracted him for the inaugural world drivers'
championship in 1950. He won his second grand-prix race, and two others
that year. The following season he again won three, enough to take the
first of his five titles.
Fangio drove in a particularly dangerous era. ''Do you know,'' he once
said, ''that in my 10 years of driving in Europe, I saw 30 of my friends
and rivals killed?''
His most serious accident was in 1952 when he crashed his Maserati at
Monza, breaking his neck. Yet, he was back the following season and
regained the world title for Maserati in 1954, retaining it for the next
three years when driving for Mercedes Benz, Ferrari, and Maserati again.
His greatest victory came in the 1957 German Grand Prix at
Nuerburgring, when a long pit stop left his Maserati 48 seconds behind
Ferrari rivals Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins. Fangio broke the lap
record 10 times and overhauled Hawthorn to win by 3.6 seconds.
He quit in 1958 and his record of 24 grand-prix victories puts him
seventh in the all-time rankings behind Alain Prost (France) 51, Ayrton
Senna (Brazil) 41, Nigel Mansell (Britain) 31, Jackie Stewart (Britain)
27, Jim Clark (Britain) and Niki Lauda (Austria), both 25.
Living quietly in Balcarce, near Buenos Aires, he enjoyed advising
younger drivers, including Senna.
The Brazilian, who was killed last year in San Marino, was a committed
Fangio fan and once said: ''Even if I or someone else can equal or beat
Fangio's record, it still will not compare with his achievement. Every
year there is a winner of the championship, but not necessarily a world
champion. I think Fangio is the example of a true world champion.''

JOHNNY Herbert's first Grand Prix victory at Silverstone promises a
new order in Formula 1.
He became the second first-time winner this season -- Jean Alesi did
it in Canada -- and in doing so, he banished all doubts about Benetton
being a one-car, one-driver team built around world champion Michael
Schumacher.
''Now I am very happy for one thing in particular,'' said Benetton
managing director Flavio Briatore, reportedly visited by an apologetic
Frank Williams on Sunday evening after his driver, Damon Hill, had
collided with Schumacher in an abortive attempt to snatch the lead on
lap 46.
''Johnny's victory proved a lot of things about us as a team. People
have said we only supported one driver, but actually we are a solid team
and we work for both drivers.''
Herbert's win hoisted him into fourth place in the drivers' world
title race and established Benetton as clear leaders of the
constructors' championship with 58 points ahead of Ferrari on 49.
Defending champions Williams are third with 46.
Schumacher, who was left frustrated and angry, remained 11 points
ahead in the drivers' series with 46 points to Hill's 35, with Alesi
third on 32. Herbert has 22.
''I know what I can do and I am looking forward to getting all the
support and testing I need to prove it,'' he said.
Hill, who was at home in Dublin with his wife Georgie, who is awaiting
the arrival of their third child, was still insisting the crash was
accidental. ''I felt there was a genuine chance to attack him, as he had
taken a wide line,'' he said. ''I don't think I did anything wrong.''
Hill made no comment on suggestions that the accident, would cause
problems among the sell-out crowd at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim
on July 30.

CYCLING:
GRAEME Obree is fast becoming a globetrotter as he chases gold in the
current World Cup series, and today in Japan his powerful frame will be
stretched out in his new Superman position as he attempts to make it a
hat trick of wins in the current competition.
Last week, he broke the Australian record on his way to winning the
4000 metres pursuit in Adelaide. Today, in the land of the Rising Sun,
the 27-year-old former world champion, who is Britain's one-man team,
aims to turn up the power in Tokyo.
Obree is using the World Cup as a springboard for the world
championships in Colombia in September, but to get there he has to be
under 4min 25sec -- a target that looks on the cards, given his
improvement in the past three months.
On a chilly evening in Adelaide, he clocked 4-27.1 to collect the
Australian record as well as gold ahead of French rival, Philippe
Ermenault. This time was achieved despite a marathon flight and lack of
sleep -- he did not arrive in Australia until the day before the race
because of a visa mix-up.
Obree's other World Cup win came in Athens in May, when he demolished
Austrian pursuiter Dietmar Muller with a time of 4-32.6.
The fortunes of the Irvine flier have taken a dramatic turn since he
was sacked by French club Le Groupement at the start of the year. He
signed up with Die Continentale of Germany in February and started
working on a new high-profile position on his bike after a ban on his
old downhill-ski style.
Now the change is paying off, and he is confident he will make the
world qualifying time.

AYR RACING:
A BROAD hint dropped by trainer Roger Charlton was latched on to by
punters at Ayr yesterday when they backed Baron Ferdinand to win the
#40,000 Tennents Scottish Classic.
Charlton chose the Ayr Group 3 race in preference to a Listed event at
Newbury last Friday and justified favouritism at 100-30.
Not only was Charlton on the spot to see his five-year-old cruise into
the lead more than a furlong from the post, but the owner, Lady
Rothschild, was also in attendance -- her first visit to the West of
Scotland track.
Young Buster and Revere disputed the lead until two furlongs out.
Captain Horatius came from a long way back, but despite a late and
earnest challenge was never able to get to the winner, and was beaten a
length.
Kevin Darley, who won this race two years ago on River North, said
Baron Ferdinand had idled when in front, but ran on strongly.
Tom Kemp's Gospel Song, though out of his class, was not disgraced. Up
among the early leaders, he finished sixth and won #421 in addition to
the best turned out award.
It is turning out to be a tremendous season for Ayr hoteliers, Ken
MacPherson and his wife, Janis.
A week ago, Perryston View, named after their Ayr home, won a
six-furlong sprint at Newmarket, his fourth success of the season, and
yesterday Somerton Boy (11-2), obliged on their home track in the
Holiday Handicap, his second win this year.
The five-year-old took the lead approaching the final furlong and kept
on to beat the fast finishing Persian Fayre by a length. The MacPhersons
have six horses in training with Peter Calver at Ripon.
George Moore, who was successful with Flashy's Son and Highflying on
Sunday, continued the good work yesterday with Shadow Jury in the Daily
Record Handicap.
He just failed to make it four out of four with Anorak, who finished
second to Keep Your Distance in the West Sound Radio Claiming Stakes.
Rich Glow, whose three wins this season have all been at Ayr, appeared
to have the Daily Record Handicap in his pocket two furlongs from home
but he was joined by Shadow Jury who won in easy fashion. Shadow Jury
has now won four of his past six races.
Tom Dyer's Petite d'Argent (20-1 in the morning) was backed down from
10-1 to 7-1 on the course with bets totalling #3000, but although he
disputed the lead three furlongs from home, he soon faded out of the
picture.

CRICKET
SCOTLAND'S budding cricket stars blitzed Ireland on the second day of
the World Youth Cup in Holland yesterday.
The devastating pace of John Blain (2-39) and Steve Blackie (3-21)
reduced the Irish Under-19s to 34-4. They recovered to 129 all out, but
the Scots strolled to a seven-wicket triumph.
Coach Jim Love said: ''We've unearthed a couple of winners in Blain
and Blackie. In both our games they've ripped the heart out of the
opposition batting.'' The 40 extras -- Ireland's top score -- was Love's
only lament.
Dougie Lockhart and Greig Butchart had an opening stand of 116 and,
although three wickets fell, the target was reached with 10 overs to
spare.
Ireland 129 (I Synott 34; S Blackie 3-21); Scotland 131-3 (D Lockhart
55, G Butchart 46). Scotland Under-19s won by seven wickets.

JOHNNY Herbert took to the golf course to clear his head the morning
after the night before, Michael Schumacher was still nursing his wrath,
Damon Hill was pleading his innocence, The Boy David was still waiting
for his first grand-prix win, and Nigel Mansell was threatening to
return and sort them all out.
Silverstone yesterday had fallen quiet after four frenetic days of
traffic jams, screaming engines on the ground and in the air, and
bickering drivers. Peace at last, but not for long.
The modern equivalent of the wagon train, the high-tech trucks which
transport the Formula One machines and their crews around the globe, was
already lumbering towards the next stop, Hockenheim, where Schumacher is
planning to make sure Hill gets his in retaliation for the shunt which
put both of them out of Sunday's contest.
The build-up to the British Grand Prix had been dominated by the war
of words between world champion Schumacher, and Hill, and escalated
after Hill's manoeuvre on lap 46 at Priory when he tried to pass on the
inside. He and Schumacher collided and their contest was over, leaving
Herbert, the German's Benetton Renault team-mate, to win his first
Formula One race.
Hill's Williams Renault team-mate, the diplomatic David Coulthard, who
missed a chance to win his first race, described the overtaking
manueovre as ''ambitious'' -- Schumacher used the words ''crazy'' and
''stupid'' -- and now everyone will focus on Hockenheim, where Hill has
never been a favourite. Indeed, there were rumours of death threats made
against him last year. After Sunday, they might call for an even worse
fate, like being locked in a room for a week listening to tapes of Nigel
Mansell interviews.
The former world champion seems determined to whine on, and made it
clear yesterday that he would be willing to slide back into a cockpit if
the right offer and the right car were made available. He is bound to
get a call or two as the teams have already started planning for next
season and are targeting the drivers they would like.
So far, Schumacher is supposed to be going to Williams, with Hill
moving to Benetton, Herbert is to be ditched, Coulthard is wanted by
McLaren, and everyone is confused. Teams and drivers deny everything, of
course, but the only certainty is that nothing will happen until the
hottest property, Schumacher, decides whose offer he wants to accept.
So far as the majority of the 90,000 spectators -- who paid #63 a head
to sit on a damp patch of grass and watch a blur of sponsors' colours
flash by every now and then -- were concerned, it was all about one day,
race day, but Formula One is more about big business and image. No other
sport is so embroiled in politics, power, and money.
Frank Williams is reported to have once said: ''Racing drivers are
like electric bulbs, you can always plug another one in.''
Always, team leaders are plotting and planning and playing one sponsor
off against another. Around Silverstone, there was talk that Williams,
said to be unhappy that Renault, who are into Formula One for something
like $100m, should have given Benetton the same engines, might renew
former alliance with Honda or go with Ford. BMW might even be making
noises.
Cards are played close to chests, with Bernie Ecclestone, who does all
the commercial deals in the grand-prix world, saying: ''There are only
two things I never discuss. One is last night, and the other is money.''
Money, of course, is what makes this particular world go around and
nowhere is the great divide more clearly illustrated than at
Silverstone, where the wealthy and the corporate clients literally move
above the masses.
While the have-nots and the wannabes trek towards the circuit, forming
long, straggly lines like refugees, or sit in traffic jams for hours at
a time, the rich and the famous arrive by private planes and
helicopters, delivered right into the middle of the circuit. Silverstone
has its own airfield, a former Ministry of Defence bomber training
centre which, on grand-prix weekends, becomes the busiest airport in the
world. As many as 3000 movements can be carried in one day.
And all because of the sight and sounds of highly-tuned,
scientifically-designed cars reaching speeds of up to 180mph. Doesn't
make sense.
Yet, if you let go, if you close your eyes to the ridiculously clothed
fans -- they wear as many sponsors' logos as the cars and Silverstone is
still experiencing fall-out from Mansell mania in that a great number of
skinhead, lager-lout types can still be seen -- and try to enter into
the highly-charged world, it would be very easy to be sucked all the way
in. The frantic operations of race teams, their expertise, and the
ferocious noise of the engines combine to touch something within,
perhaps something basic.
Behind the closed steel doors of the paddock areas, mechanics huddle
over engines, fine-tuning, while drivers look on anxiously. The engines
growl and scream like animals in their paddocks waiting to be unleashed,
and when these beasts of modern technology are seen for the first time,
adrenlin courses and kicks in to the body's system.
It is a heady experience, Formula One racing, and initially at least
it is the addiction to their own adrenalin which may make most of the
drivers take part. After a while, it becomes a question of money,
although for the likes of Herbert, it is still the thrill.
His surprise victory at Silverstone should ensure his drives with
Benetton for the remainder of the season and might also secure him a
contract for next term. He would also like some real back-up for the
rest of this season and greater assistance from Schumacher.
It is thought Benetton, despite their denials, have not been giving
Herbert the same attention and help as their No.1 driver, who only
partly answered criticism earlier this season that he was keeping vital
information from the Warwickshire-based driver to protect and strengthen
his own standing.
Perhaps now one of the unsung heroes will get what he deserves while
Schumacher's countrymen lie in wait for Hill. It all adds spice to an
already intriguing and ferocious sport in which only the strong survive.

PARBUSTERS:
READERS already may be familiar with the exploits of West Kilbride's
Graham Fox on behalf of Scotland in the European Boys' Team Championship
at Woodhall Spa, where he broke the course record with a 67 last
Thursday. Less well known is that it was his second course record inside
a week.
For club golf purposes it is his 63 at the Ayrshire course that we are
interested in. That round, with nine birdies and a bogey, constituted
eight under par -- but a Parbusters score of minus 7 by our method of
calculating against the competition scratch score which went down one on
the day to 70.
Graham already has to concede shots to the course, having been a
plus-one player at the time of the record. Now he has moved to plus-two,
but don't bet on that stopping him winning the handicap categories if he
is going to keep shooting course records.
But for Fox's feat we would be concentrating on Colin Fraser's course
record 65 at Innerleithen, with which he won the Ronnie Eckford Trophy.
His three-under return knocked two shots off the old record and it
included a two-stroke penalty when he drove out of bounds at the
seventeenth. Colin, however, eagled the hole with his second ball.
There was some good shooting also among the women, with
three-handicapper Dorothea Hastings shooting a scratch 72 in the medal
at Haggs Castle. This one-under-par score not only wins the category but
puts her in outright second place on the women's scratch list for the
season.
It was over the same course on their open day that Eastwood's Caroline
Agnew shot a par 73. Caroline, the Eastwood ladies' champion for the
fourth year running, had shot a one-over-par 74 the previous day at
Whitecraigs, where she is also a member.
Also in form was Greenock's Linda McDougall, who shot a three-over
gross 74 at Greenock in a medal and improved on that with a 72 in the
SLGA Brooch.
The winner of the men's handicap section this week was Ian McFarlane,
of Easter Moffat, with a 13-under net 57. That takes him into a
three-way tie at the top of the all-season list, and 11 under is now the
minimum requirement over the closing weeks to have a chance of making
the top 10.
Pauline McDonald shot a net 59 to top the women's handicap category
and the Cowglen 24-handicapper is now in joint-second place on the
season's list. This week's leading scores:

CLUB ROUND-UP
THE tradition of buying drinks in the clubhouse after a hole in one
would have had the members at Balmoral in a merry state after a friendly
foursome last week produced two aces -- at the same hole, writes Bill
Sutherland.
Robert Lawrie was first to hole his tee-shot at the second hole. His
partner, Andy Kemp, might have been forgiven for supposing that his team
were about to go one up -- but Willie Potts then matched it. It was
little wonder that the match ended all square. The other witness to this
tit-for-tat extravaganza was Willie's partner, Ed Bushnell.
Halves all round, you might say.
* HEATHER Stirling and Linda Wemyss finished respectively first and
second among the 30 women who took part in the Midlothian final of the
Pringle Champion of Champions tournament at Ratho Park.
Heather, an Alloa member from Bridge of Allan, who plays off plus one,
shot a gross 66 (net 67) on the par-72 course. Linda, a six-handicapper
from the host club, was runner-up with a best back nine of 37 among four
players on 76. Both qualify for the Pringle National championship at
Dalmahoy on September 10 and 11.
* THE Paisley and District League has finished with Kilmacolm winners
of the Newton Shield by virtue of an 8-2 record and 16 points from their
10 games. Ralston and Erskine have been relegated.
The Newton Quaich has gone to Renfrew, who won the Division B title by
a single point from Cochrane Castle, who also are promoted. The wooden
spoon went to Caldwell.
* THE Scottish Inter-bank competition was played over Broomieknowe and
won by the Bank of Scotland, with a best-three total of 215, three

* This week's tip comes from ANDREW MARSHALL, the professional at
Kingsknowe Golf Club in Edinburgh.
HOLING the three-footers can make or break a score. Watch the
professionals -- they very rarely miss from that distance.
If you are missing from short range, the chances are that you are
moving too much on the shot and taking your eye of the ball. It is
usually because of nerves. As the putt is hit, the player anxiously
looks to the hole hoping to see the ball go in.
It is similar to the putting yips. When the player does move, the
club-face does not stay square, the putt is mis-hit and will almost
certainly miss the hole.
My tip is to concentrate on keeping the eye-line over the ball, and
keep the head still until the ball is struck. In fact, don't look up
until you hear the ball drop into the hole.
By keeping still, it also gives you a chance to concentrate more on
making a good stroke. Practise putting using a pendulum action of the
shoulders.
A steady head, and a good stroke, will improve club-head control. The
club-face will hit the ball square, and send it rolling towards the
middle of the cup.

WHEN Nick Price tees off at the first hole in defence of his Open
title, won last year at Turnberry, his efforts will be followed by an
estimated 200,000 spectators who will descend on St Andrews for the
event. This year will mark the 124th Open Championship, but for St
Andrews it will be the 25th time the competition has been played there.
The first time St Andrews staged The Open was in 1873 when Tom Kidd
emerged champion and won the traditional silver claret jug that had just
been introduced the year before when won by Tom Morris Jnr. Nick Faldo
was the last winner at St Andrews in 1990 when the Home of Golf became
host to a worldwide collection of golfing giants. And this is how the
competition has grown from its early days when the Championship was
played over one day and lasted 36 holes.
Remarkably the Old Course has seen little change with few alterations
having taken place since, when Bobby Jones in 1927, or Sam Snead in 1946
became victors. And Greg Norman, Colin Montgomerie and Corey Pavin will
play a course almost identical to that negotiated by their antecedents.
What will have changed is that Norman and Montgomerie will use a
different method of navigation around the course. Hickory shafts have
been replaced by graphite, and perhaps the greatest single factor of
all, golf ball technology, allows massive distances to be carried in one
stroke. The course when built certainly did not figure on a ball being
driven 350 yards.
St Andrews and the Old Course reek with tradition and have produced a
cluster of heroes whose triumphs have only been eclipsed by the
disasters that have befallen those who had one hand on the claret jug
and the winner's speech all but complete.
Two-and-a-half feet separated Doug Sanders from glory when in 1970 he
was faced with a putt of this length to capture victory. It was not the
easiest of putts, being downhill and with the often unpredictability of
whether the ball will run straight or curve to the left or right.
Amateur golfers will have faced this kind of putt many times and
understand the feeling. But not with a massive gallery, hushed in
anticipation, or an Open Championship title hanging on the outcome. For
Sanders and the golfing world the result is history, the putt slid by
the hole and the pain of it all perhaps lingers to this day.
In the play-off the following day Sanders lost by one shot to Jack
Nicklaus, ironically in that round having a birdie at the last hole in a
final twist of fate.
But it is the tradition that is linked with this royal and ancient
place that makes it something special and although it is the Home of
Golf for many it is where The Open should be played every year. Where
else will players or spectators hear names like Grannie Clark's Wynd,
the Valley of Sin or Hell's Bunker? Where else will they tee-off and
putt-out where the public are going about their everyday business?
The course is ideal for spectators and more than 18,000 seats have
been set up at strategic places around the course. Viewing is enormously
helped by there being seven double greens and players' progress can be
followed on the front or back nine from one position.
If you have not bought tickets for this year's Open in advance they
may be purchased at the gate. The competition does not start until
Thursday, however, today and tomorrow are popular days for the many who
prefer watching players practising and when they are more likely to make
conversation.
Admission today and tomorrow is #10 adults, juvenile/senior citizen
#5. Throughout the championship, Thursday to Sunday, admission charges
are adults #20, juvenile #5, senior citizen #10. As a bonus all those
who purchase tickets will be entitled to free admission to the British
Golf Museum which is situated behind the Royal and Ancient clubhouse on
the day that their ticket is valid.
Players will tee-off between 7.15am and 4.20pm, Thursday and Friday;
8.55am and 3.15pm Saturday; 8.25am and 2.45pm on the final day.
For all visitors to The Open, a trip to the tented village is a must.
This year there are more than 70 stands and the very latest in golf club
technology guaranteed to bring your handicap down, will be on display.
Golfing souvenirs and memorabilia, tuition, holidays, clothing and
official merchandise carrying The Open logo is available at The Open
Championship shop within the exhibition tent.
Rail journeys may be dogged by strikes, however, if trains are running
the nearest station to St Andrews is Leuchars which is about five miles
away. The Golflink service will again be in operation and passengers
after arriving at Leuchars will be transferred to coach for the short
journey to the Old Course. Golflink operates for the championship days
only. Further information may be obtained by contacting Golflink on
01592 414141.
If you decide to travel by road car parking and colour codes will be
signposted to St Andrews. A park and ride facility will also be
available from Leuchars at a cost of #2. This will cover car parking and
return bus journey for all passengers to the Old Course.
If golf is not your game and the #20 entry money into the championship
could be used for, or put to something else, then St Andrews and its
surrounding area will not let you down.
The town has a unique place in Scotland's heritage, taking its name
from one of Christ's apostles. It became an important religious centre
in medieval Scotland where its bishops had great influence over matters
connected with church and state. Today it is a bustling market town and
its pattern of streets and wynds are similar to the character of a
bygone time.
St Andrews can be comfortably explored on foot and the combination of
medieval, Victorian and Edwardian streets combine to make it one of
Scotland's most attractive towns. Landmarks such as the castle,
cathedral and university are sprinkled among a variety of shops,
restaurants, theatres and art galleries.
The town's university is the oldest in Scotland dating back to the
fifteenth century when it was founded by Scottish academics who had
studied abroad. Although many of the university buildings have since
been replaced, a thorn tree planted by Mary Queen of Scots survives in
St Mary's quad.
If you are in the mood for learning about the area a collection of
museums offer the visitor a look into the past. In the museum of St
Andrews Preservation Trust displays include a nineteenth-century
grocers' and chemist shop whereas St Andrews Museum tells the tale of
the town's history.
Round off your day with a visit to the Byre Theatre where professional
and amateur companies put on plays from the classics to the work of
modern playwrights.

YOUR ball lies in a bush after your tee shot. Unwisely, you move it
under Rule 28b, dropping within two clublengths of where the ball lay,
not nearer the hole, under a one-shot penalty. After the drop you
consider the ball still unplayable.
If you then invoke Rule 28a, going back to where it was last played,
can you return to the tee?
YES. Decision 28/6.5 allows this because a real stroke was not
attempted at the first location in the bush.
The total penalty is two shots and you would be playing your fourth
from the tee which might be a good idea. Otherwise you could run up a
cricket score without actually playing another shot.

A CAMPAIGN has been launched by ScottishPower to find out if the
20,000 farmers and landowners affected by its pylons and cables are
happy with the way maintenance work involving access to their land is
carried out.
It is sending out a brief questionaire to every person who is involved
in wayleave agreements, asking if the energy company's staff or
contractors are meeting the standards required in obtaining proper
access and minimising damage.
ScottishPower pays out an average of #1.25m a year in wayleave
payments and compensation, and the newly published Grantor's Charter,
drafted in consultation with the Scottish NFU and the Scottish
Landowners' Federation, details its committments.

<HEADLINE>Illegal trading puts seed potato industry at risk</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977338509</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IT has been suggested that as many as 40,000 tonnes of small ware
potatoes are being sold out of Scotland, mostly into England, each year
under the label of Scottish seed potatoes.
This trade, according to a spokesman for the British Society of Plant
Breeders, is putting the reputation of the entire industry at some
hazard as well as raising serious implications for plant health.
So widespread has the trade become that less than #1m of plant
breeders' royalties was collected in Scotland last year.
A series of court actions are now pending following close co-operation
between the Department of Agriculture and the BSPB, including one
against an Aberdeenshire farmer. The penalties for breaking the rules
can in the extreme see a farmer go to jail. The maximum fine is set at
#25,000.
The BSPB has recently held discussions with the Lord Advocate's
department to stress the implications of illegal trading in seed
potatoes as well as pointing out that falsification of cereal seed
certification damages the entire trade.
Last year a West Lothian farming company was fined #2000 at Falkirk
Sheriff Court after being found guilty on a series of charges involving
seed barley. It is now understood that the Department of Agriculture has
significantly stepped up its supervision of the rules and regulations.
Selling small ware potatoes for seed is not specifically illegal, but
if the vendor suggests that such potatoes are certified then he is in
trouble. The Scottish seed potato industry is worth around #60m
annually, producing 400,000 tonnes -- the bulk of which is sold into
England.
The future of this sector concerns John Bethel, the chief executive of
the Scottish Seed Potato Development Council. He said yesterday: ''The
industry is becoming besmirched by some individuals and their actions.
There is a big black hole appearing which could result in serious
consequences.
''I'm not actually losing a lot of sleep over the small ware issue,
but rather more about plant health. We have an international reputation
which we must protect. It's taken years to establish and should not be
thrown away.''
The potato industry has small beginnings, mostly in Scotland, with
less than 500 seed producers who then sell to 18,000 ware growers who in
turn have 55-million customers who, should they opt to exercise the
ultimate choice, could select to eat no less than 738 different
varieties grown in Europe.
This abundance of choice is one that Mr Bethel emphasises: ''There is
a huge gene pool out there but I am seriously concerned that plant
breeders are not recouping the necessary royalties to give them the
funds for producing new varieties.
''What happens if some new plague was to hit the crop? The Government
has a case to answer in that the Barnes Report into agricultural
research and development said that plant breeding was a near-market
activity and therefore should be funded largely by the industry. Life is
not quite that simple.''

THE growth of Prestwick Airport as a freight hub was boosted yesterday
by the opening of a 58,000 sq ft warehouse to be operated by the Currie
Group as a logistics centre.
The Dumfries-based company will use the warehouse for storage and
distribution as well as for the increasing range of work it does for
Scottish industry.
Among the main customers will be the computer firm Digital, which has
plants at Ayr and Irvine and uses the Currie Group to ''pick and pack''
parts as well as to transport them by road and air.
The new facility was built by airport operators PIK at cost of more
that #2m and has been handed over on a 50-year lease.
PIK's chairman, Lord Younger of Prestwick, yesterday officially opened
the warehouse and praised the ''forward thinking'' of the Currie Group.
He added: ''We are seeing the first freight development at Prestwick
for over 30 years which at the same time is, I believe, the finest of
its kind in the country.
''It will further enhance not only the work of the Currie Group but
also the growing reputation of the airport as a freight hub.''
He called upon the Transport Secretary, Sir George Young, to move the
UK further forward towards open skies for freight and to release the
''handcuffs'' of legislation holding back development.
Lord Younger added: ''We have the Prestwick development plan for a
multi-modal transport hub ready and we hope it will soon be embraced by
Scottish Enterprise, allowing us to move on to the next stage.
''It is particularly satisfying that I am able to open this new
facility at a time when Prestwick Airport is enjoying its best freight
and passenger figures ever.''
David Ross, managing director of the Currie Group, said: ''This is a
further indication of our determination to move the company forward and
to offer a wider range of services to customers than ever before.
''We have moved on from being a trucking company and this new
warehouse moves us on further still.''

LIFE companies have been having a tougher time than they are used to
this year and of course it is their own fault given the abuses of the
past which led to the introduction of full disclosure of sale
commissions and expenses from January and a tighter regulatory climate
in general.
However, Prudential takes comfort that its new annual premiums for UK
life and pensions business were down only 6% to #118m in the first six
months of 1995. But this does represent quite a reverse when compared
with the growth seen in earlier years.
Annual premiums are the more important pointer to business trends as
single premium income is more volatile. But this was well down, by 21%
to #884m.
Apart from general consumer uncertainty, business was hit by the
unfavourable publicity surrounding the sector which inevitably
heightened consumer suspicion of the life industry as a whole. Apart
from this, however, the complexity of bringing in full disclosure and
the need to retrain sales forces caused marketing efforts to falter.
Lack of consumer confidence is more clearly shown in Prudential's UK
sales of investment profits like unit trusts, PEPs and to a lesser
extent with-profit endowments. New regular premiums slumped by 72% to
just #18m and single premiums were down 65% to #35m. The group's
experience is echoed in a sales downturn reported by a much smaller
company, United Friendly.
The difficult market is not just confined to the UK as Prudential's
worldwide new annual life and pensions premiums were down 11% and single
premiums by 10%. The news lopped 6p off Prudential's shares at 340p.
The group reckons the UK market will remain depressed at least in the
short term. There is not much it can do about this, given that its core
business is life, pensions and investment business, though it has taken
some minor steps like introducing a new critical illness policy and
trying out changes to its sales process to reduce the time taken per
sale.
Companies with a broader spread of activities have scope for
offsetting this downturn and here Legal &amp; General stands to benefit from
a new general insurance venture it has set up with the Woolwich Building
Society. Sales of L&amp;G's life and pensions business fell by over a tenth
in the first half of 1995.
The new deal involves setting up two companies, one a service
operation, Woolwich Insurance Services, which will be 90% owned by
Woolwich and 10% by L&amp;G, and an underwriting company, Gresham Insurance,
which not unnaturally L&amp;G will dominate with a 90% shareholding.
The two groups already have strong links and four-fifths of Woolwich's
550,000 borrowers are insured through the society's existing agency
agreement with L&amp;G. So there is not much scope for raising sales further
in respect of borrowers. Instead the new business will direct its
marketing fire at Woolwich's four-million investors who must therefore
stand by for another avalanche of ''junk'' mail.
To get access to such a mailing list is a godsend in a competitive
industry and L&amp;G is aiming to double its business with Woolwich
customers, who already provide a fifth of its household insurance
volume. Woolwich itself will share in the success of the venture.
Now that the controls on what they can do have been lifted, the major
societies are keen to diversify their product offer away from mortgages,
likely to be a depressed market for some time, and savings, which are
under attack from the likes of PEPs. Halifax already provides household
cover and Alliance &amp; Leicester is pondering how to enter the market.
Gresham Insurance will act as a direct insurer, though using Woolwich
branches as a source for sales leads. The beauty of this is that it can
be set up quickly and cheaply.
Given the power of computerisation, the venture expects to employ just
100 when fully up and running, which is a tiny number given that they
will be administering hundreds of thousands of policies. No wonder it
has become such a competitive industry when the costs of entry are so
comparatively low.
It is certainly a much easier sector than life and pensions which have
become a regulatory nightmare for the companies concerned. However, the
present downturn in their volume is bound to be only transitory, indeed
one hopes it will be transitory given the overwhelming need for people
to ensure they save appropriately for their old age as the state
retreats from the provision of pensions and healthcare for the elderly.

AMICABLE Smaller Enterprises Trust stayed ahead of its benchmark index
during the half-year to June 30, but cut back the interim dividend,
reminding investors that its main aim is long-term capital growth.
The trust, managed by Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in
Glasgow, enjoyed a 5.4% increase in net asset value that outstripped a
3.4% rise in the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index over the six-month
period.
Basic NAV stood at 145.55p per share.
But the interim dividend was cut to 1.4p from 1.7p last year, when the
#58.4m trust had to dip into its reserves to meet the payout.
This time the payout was just covered by earnings per share of 1.49p.
Remarking on the lower dividend, trust chairman Hugh Laughland said
the main aim was to achieve ''long-term capital appreciation''.
''Yield is not a primary consideration when selecting investments and
the amount of income available to pay dividends may vary from year to
year,'' he said.
Mr Laughland said institutional investors were returning to smaller
companies because of the increase in profits shown by many of the leaner
and fitter firms in the sector.
They had also been encouraged by current market sentiment that
inflation and interest rates will be held in check, he added.
Mr Laughland said the outlook for continued growth in earnings and
dividends in smaller companies was encouraging.

THE chief executive of a company which six years ago was in danger of
folding but has been transformed by ''a textbook recovery strategy'' has
won Scotland's premier business award.
Hew Balfour, of Fife-based Havelock Europa, yesterday received the
Scottish Business Achievement Award from the Princess Royal at a
ceremony on board the QE2 anchored in the Firth of Forth.
Mr Balfour, whose company is said to be the UK's leading retail store
fitter and manufacturer of prefabricated interiors for shops, banks and
building societies, is the 13th recipient.
Previous award winners have been dairy chief Alan Wiseman,
construction leader Fraser Morrison, Kwik-Fit founder Tom Farmer, and
Sir Ian Wood of the energy services company the Wood Group.
Angus Grossart, chairman of the Scottish Business Achievement Award
Trust's winner selection committee, said 43-year-old Mr Balfour's
leadership was a strong example for those who faced adversity, major
changes in their sector, and the need for decisive action.
''This is one of the textbook examples of management of recovery
taking a company to a new plain as a market leader in the UK.''
Ex-Scots Guard Mr Balfour, a Member of the Queen's Bodyguard for
Scotland, the Royal Company of Archers, said in 1989 the company was
''coming apart at the seams'' and the Scottish financial community had
made determined efforts to ensure it did not disappear.
It had been a long struggle, he said, since he had been appointed
chief executive in 1989 and it had not been helped by the recession and
''the dark days of 1992''.
However, by last year profits had surged ahead to more than #4m, a
rise of 76% on the previous year.
He said the 1989 problems had arisen on the back of the retail boom in
the 1980s when the management team had been unable to manage the growth.
He said his strategy had been based on penetration of new markets,
reduction of production costs, additional design resources, strategic
alliances with others, a strong programme of capital investment.

CONSUMER confidence is recovering slowly but trading conditions remain
tough particularly for retailers. As well as depressed consumer
confidence clothing retailers had to cope with variable weather in May
and June which put further downward pressure on demand. This was the
case for all retailers, from Marks &amp; Spencer, Britain's leading clothing
retailer with 15% market share, downwards.
French Connection, which competes against the likes of Kookai, Morgan,
Top Shop and Miss Selfridge, warned yesterday that its pre-tax profits
for the six months to 31 July are likely to be more than #1m but less
than the #3.1m made during the same period last year.
French Connection shares dropped 91p immediately after the
announcement but won back some ground to stand down 68p at 223p.
Like-for-like sales are said to be running three percent below last
year's level in the UK and are down 10% in the US. Efforts are being
made to expand the sales base outside these geographic areas into
Europe, the Middle East and Far East.
In UK wholesaling, summer 1995 repeat orders for French Connection and
Nicole Farhi are said to be disappointing but forward orders for 1995
are still ahead of last year.
Although the second half usually provides the bulk of the group's
profits, unless there is a serious pick-up in demand in both the UK and
US then full year profits are unlikely to match last year's #6.9m. Gross
margins have been maintained but increased overheads, mainly because of
new shop openings, have held back operating profit. However it remains
French Connection's intention to pay a final dividend.

SCOTTISHPOWER'S hopes of buying a power distribution company in
Australia received a setback yesterday, when the Victoria State
Government refused to exclude its rival Electricite de France (EFD) in
protest at the resumption of French nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Victoria state premier Jeff Kennett said his government could face a
legal challenge if it simply excluded state-owned EDF, which has a
minority stake in a consortium led by unidentified Australian interests.
ScottishPower and the EDF consortium are on a shortlist of four
bidders for United Energy, the first of several power companies to be
privatised by the small state in south-eastern Australia.
A final decision on the sale, which is expected to fetch up to #550m,
is due in early August.
ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson visited Australia earlier
this month to finalise arrangements for the bid.
One industry source said the Glasgow-based company had dropped plans
to team up with a local partner and would probably bid alone for United
Energy.
An Australian partner may be brought in at a later stage if the bid is
successful, he added.
There had been speculation that Australia might veto the EDF bid on
political grounds in protest at France's plans to resume underground
nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific.
This gained strength when Victoria industry minister Philip Gude
cancelled a visit to Paris during a European tour earlier this month.
But Mr Kennett said the EDF consortium had already spent #2m to #4m on
preparing its bid.
''I'm not sure that if we said no to them we wouldn't leave ourselves
open to a legal challenge anyway,'' he told reporters in the state
capital Melbourne.
Even if EDF does fall by the wayside for political or other reasons,
ScottishPower still faces stiff competition from two US bidders, who are
believed to have offered more cash.
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric is bidding alone, while Utilicorp United has
teamed up with North States Power and Australia's Lend Lease
Corporation.
The bid for United Energy, which is only a quarter of the size of most
UK regional electricity companies, is ScottishPower's first overseas
venture.
ScottishPower, which earlier looked at a possible acquisition in the
United States, has had a team on the ground in Australia for the last
six months.

BRITAIN is increasingly becoming a cafe society with eating out a
major leisure activity, particularly for people aged under 40.
This is not formal dining for special occasions but more a chance to
meet friends, catch up on the gossip while having something to eat and
drink. The hot summer weather is perfect for such meetings.
One company which is taking advantage of the growth in demand for this
kind of casual dining is Pelican Group, which trades primarily as Cafe
Rouge. Last year it acquired other restaurant chains, among them the
Dome.
The company made its first foray north of the Border earlier this year
with the opening of a Cafe Rouge in the Italian Centre in Glasgow.
Roger Myers, chairman of Pelican Group, said he was ''much encouraged
by Glasgow'', so much so that a Cafe Rouge will open in Aberdeen on
August 30 and a site has been identified for an outlet in Edinburgh.
Depending on how well they do there could be further openings in
Scotland.
The concept behind Cafe Rouge is to offer good value food and drink in
local neighbourhoods. Its main competition being from the small
family-run local French or Italian restaurant.
Although discretionary spending on lesiure activities in general
declined during the recession and is only showing a slow recovery, Cafe
Rouge prospered during the period.
Last year was the sixth consecutive year in which profits increased
since the group's inception. Profit before tax jumped by 60% to #4.1m on
turnover up 93% to #31.8m. The total dividend was raised by 20% to 1.5p.
In terms of current trading sales for the group are said to remain
buoyant and have already exceeded the level set at the half-year stage
last year.
Over the same six-year period, the number of restaurants and bars
operated by Pelican has risen from one, a Cafe Rouge in Richmond in 1989
to 63 by the end of the last financial year to March 31.
Mr Myers attributes this to its value for money offering. ''We've kept
this at the forefront of what we do,'' he said. The average lunchtime
spend per head is #6.50 for a meal, a figure that rises to just #12.50
in the evening although it is possible to spend less and much more.
The Dome chain, which Mr Myers set up a few years ago, is being
reformatted to be more of a bar than a restaurant. As such it will
complement the Cafe Rouge. Of the 16 acquired from Forte last May, 10
have been turned into Cafe Rouge.
The group currently trades from 72 outlets and is opening new branches
at the rate of one a week. It plans to be operating from 100 by the end
of the current financial year, next March.
Further down the line there could be Cafe Rouge or Dome outlets in
stations, airports and department stores around the UK. There is already
a Cafe Rouge at Windsor and a Dome in Selfridges department store in
London.

TROUBLED United Biscuits, maker of McVitie's and Keebler biscuits,
McCoy's crisps and KP Nuts, yesterday issued a shock announcement that
it was cutting its interim dividend from 5.5p to 3.5p and the final was
also unlikely to be maintained.
The company, which also says it is in discussions to sell all or part
of its Keebler US business which has not performed as expected, had
warned at its annual meeting in May that first-half profits would be
significantly lower than the #80.1m before exceptionals seen in the same
period last year.
But now the wording has turned even more ominous with profits forecast
to be ''very substantially below'' last year's level at not more than
#30m, while second-half profits are expected to be somewhat below the
second half of 1994 although much stronger than the first.
UB's share price promptly tumbled 40p to 281p, well below the previous
low for the year of 303p. It had stood at 331p ahead of the annual
meeting, having touched a 1995 ''high'' of 368p though it has been bid
speculation rather than any trading progress which has acted as the main
prop with Hanson often mooted as a likely predator.
Even this increasingly outside possibility is looking distinctly
faded. UB admits that the financial performance of Keebler, which in
March was said to be going according to plan, has been well below
expectations during the first half of 1995.
The group announced last month that as part of Keebler's streamlining
process the salty snacks business would be put up for sale though City
sources reckoned it would be lucky to raise #50m from the loss-maker.
In biscuits, the US market has seen a marked volume decline and
despite an encouraging improvement in market share driven by higher
levels of consumer marketing investment, Keebler's planned level of
volume growth has not been achieved.
UB says the resultant sales shortfall, combined with under-recovery of
raw material and packaging cost inflation in the face of intense
competition, has contributed significantly to the disappointing
first-half outcome for Keebler.
Given that Keebler has continued to disappoint and fall short of
expectations, UB has decided the necessary resources can be best used
elsewhere. Morgan Stanley has been retained to assist in evaluating
partnership and sale options for part or all of the Keebler operation in
the US.
The company had been expecting to do better in most of its businesses
in the second half as it gained the full benefit of price increases
implemented in the first half and from its strong marketing and new
product programmes.
Acutely competitive conditions in some of its core operations, though,
mean that full-year profits before exceptionals will still fall
''significantly below'' last year's level.
New chairman Colin Short commented: ''In view of the considerable
efforts of the Keebler management to redirect and restructure the US
operations, it is disappointing that market conditions have frustrated
progress. However, it is vital that we focus the group's resources in
markets which offer the best prospects for earnings growth.
''The steps we are taking with Keebler and on the dividend will
strengthen the group's balance sheet and cash flow considerably and will
provide us with the flexibility to pursue our international snackfood
strategy more vigorously.''
Meanwhile, it looks as though shareholders will have to bite the
bullet again as UB's woes continue.

NEILL Clerk Group, which has been guiding other smaller and growing
companies on to the Stock Exchange's new Alternative Investment Market,
yesterday began trading on AIM itself.
The Glasgow and London-based financial services group comes to market
with a capitalisation of #5m, comprising 500,000 Ordinary shares at a
price of #10.
Formed last year by the transfer to a newly-formed company of the
corporate finance team and administration business of Scottish
solicitors' firm Neill Clerk &amp; Murray and the subsequent acquisition,
for shares, of the similar businesses of Terrace Hill Group of London,
Neill Clerk Group recently announced pre-tax profits of #609,000 on
turnover of #3.67m for the 12 months to end-March.
Neill Clerk Group has been an ardent supporter of AIM.
Its Glasgow and London-based Neill Clerk Capital subsidiary, which
provides corporate finance advice, manages unit trusts, and structures
and sponsors issues of investment products, was nominated adviser to
three of the 10 debutants which began trading on AIM on June 19.
It helped Glasgow-based residential property letting companies Norcity
II and Norhomes, as well as London-based investment company Athelney
Trust on to AIM.
The big question in the run-up to the launch of the new market was the
extent to which institutional investors would become involved.
Ross Macdonald, chief executive of Neill Clerk Group, believes
institutions are interested in AIM and are only waiting for the right
deal.
Although some potential AIM entrants, such as Rangers Football Club,
are adopting a wait-and-see attitude in relation to the new market,
Neill Clerk Group believes it has great potential.
Its move on to AIM will allow shareholders who are not directly
involved in the business to trade its shares more easily.
Sir Robin Duthie, chairman of Neill Clerk Group, said: ''Today's
admission to trading is the next natural stage for a young progressive
group. It reflects the enthusiasm of the board and executives to expand
the group into a substantial financial services business.''
Neill Clerk Group's other principal trading subsidiary, Glasgow-based
Park Circus Management, provides company and property management, as
well as administrative services, to existing investment vehicles,
primarily Business Expansion Scheme companies, with a combined
capitalisation of about #300m.
During the last year, Neill Clerk Capital has launched three property
unit trusts. Two are providing exit routes for former BES property
companies and have so far acquired firms with a total value of #12m.
Neill Clerk Capital has also launched two Enterprise Zone property
trusts, two forestry investment funds and two Enterprise Investment
Scheme issues, relating to shipping and pubs.
It also helps UK residents invest in oil and gas partnerships in the
US.

Visual Art
SUMMER exhibitions are traditionally an opportunity for a gallery's
artists to display either a representational or topical piece as a
celebration of the season. The Open Eye has taken this a step further in
producing a show that spans both the whole breadth of artistic form and
allows new artists to exhibit too. Whyn Lewis, a 1995 graduate of GSA,
paints absorbing studies of her dog and herself, while Stephen Mangan
(Dundee, 1994) uses beach imagery inspired by Portobello promenade --
pieces which have a forbidding dark element.
Their freshness and originality infect the whole exhibition -- John
Brown has a strikingly muscular oil of a Newhaven lobster boat's prow,
Linda Farquharson's lino cuts are all delicacy, and Christopher
Wormell's wood cuts are those of a master craftsman. Joan Gillespie's
vivid oils use bright slabs of colour to capture French light and Marian
Leven's rugged view of St Monans portrays the freshness and saltiness of
a Scottish summer.
The applied arts are as varied -- Lucy Dunce's pilgrimware pieces,
Eogan Bridge's fat buddha-like sculpture of horse and rider, and Paul
Waters' beautiful wooden pieces which manage to be both functional and
retain the spirit of the original tree in their fragmented edges.
Hanging in a distinct area, Richard Demarco shows strong prints of his
time on the Maria Assumpta and mixed media work, mostly of Scotland.
They have a storybook quality -- all pastel shades -- but pieces such as
Traquair Orchard also have a wildness, with branches tossing in the
welter of colour.

MARY BRENNAN takes a look at Dundee Rep Dance Company's new
production, based on the unfulfilled dreams of Igor Stravinsky and Dylan
Thomas.
DYLAN Thomas, Igor Stravinsky, and Dundee -- what's the connecting
link? Well, while it is possible marmalade was a favourite preserve of
both poet and composer, the answer is more likely to lie in ID/53, this
year's community show from Dundee Rep Dance Company.
ID/53 -- standing for Igor Dylan/1953 -- refers to a project that
never was. Andy Howitt, guest choreographer on the Dundee production,
sketched in some of the background detail.
Apparently, Dylan Thomas and Igor Stravinsky met in a Boston hotel in
1953 with the object of creating a radical new opera. Sadly, they never
got beyond the initial outlines of the piece and a month later Thomas
was dead.
Everything about that episode -- the personalities, what might have
originated from their collaboration -- has niggled away in Howitt's
mind. Twice before, Dylan Thomas has featured as inspiration for his
choreography. Six years ago, it was the relationship between Thomas and
wife Caitlin that figured in a piece for Diversions Dance Company. Last
year, working with drama students at Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh,
he actually got as far as Thomas and Stravinsky coming together . . .
but still no actual incarnation of that intriguing, unresolved opera.
It felt to Howitt like unfinished business, future commitments
included working with TAG on Lanark (for the Edinburgh Festival) and
with Boilerhouse on their next venture. Then Dundee Rep invited him to
choreograph their community dance production.
Previously the event had a strongly local feel to it, but this time
the organisers were looking to break the mould. As he described it to
them, the opera-that-never-was seemed appealingly different. And so,
ID/53, the dance version of that unwritten opera, has come into being at
last.
So, where do you begin with something that had hardly reached the
point of joined-up thinking, let alone a full libretto and score? Well,
seemingly some notions did emerge from the cross-flow of whisky and talk
in that Boston hotel.
''The opera was going to be based on Adam and Eve and the Serpent,''
says Howitt. ''That's what we've started with. There are three
professional dancers -- they're Adam and Eve and the snake -- and
everything else is performed by members of the community. Over 30
people, ages seven to 45, and they're all on stage throughout the piece
which is some 60 minutes long.''
There was, of course, no music, so composer Keiran Cheung was given
the task of coming up with something appropriate. Howitt's vision of the
work was challenging to say the least -- ''kind of returning to the
energy, the universality of Rights of Spring, yet with the smallness,
the individualities of Under Milk Wood''.
Nine two-hour sessions across June and a solid week in July was all
the time Howitt had with his dancers. With no margin for error, Howitt
and Cheung collaborated closely with one eye on a stopwatch and the
other on the story board that charted each stage of the piece.
Gruelling, yes, but for Howitt massively rewarding.
''Musically, it's the most collaborative thing I've ever done. We'd
sit, in rehearsals, deciding on the style and the length of each
section, even down to the last second -- clicking the stopwatches -- so
that the music and the movement could really work together.''
It was demanding of the dancers too. ''That week in July, we worked 10
till six every day, just like professionals, because I really didn't
want to compromise the choreography, or just say 'Do your own thing,
that'll be fine'.''
More than 40 years after Dylan and Igor conversed about a radical
new Eden that no-one ever sang about, Andy Howitt and Dundee Rep
Community Dance Company have turned the pipe dream into a new reality,
and brought that vision down to earth at the Rep.
* ID/53 can be seen tonight at Dundee Rep, 7.30pm. This is the only
performance.

THE Edinburgh Festival Fringe doesn't just thrive on the
extraordinary, it depends on it. As often as not it's impresario Richard
Demarco who provides it. Last week he gathered a small party of
journalists and PR people on Waverley Station, commandeered a carriage
on the 09.10 ScotRail Edinburgh to Dundee service, and spent the next 80
minutes blowing the trumpet for his city-linking August programme.
Demarco found himself increasingly frustrated about the fast
turnaround times and small performance spaces in Edinburgh stopping him
from bringing many larger-scale productions from abroad. Dundee Rep was
his perfect, if oddball, solution -- a medium-scale, fully equipped
modern theatre, generally unused throughout August, situated in shorter
commuting time than most Londoners spend every morning on the Tube. Get
ScotRail involved and he could offer Fringe-goers an all-in ticket (#22
for your return journey and up to three shows) with entertainment
beginning on the train!
Dundee Rep's artistic director Hamish Glen was amused by the wild
imagination of the idea. He persuaded the Dundee Partnership, a joint
body of civic funders, that the plan would be good for the city and it
contributed #20,000.
Throw ScotRail into the equation and the next thing you know, it's not
even 10am and you're on a train drinking vodka, and watching Richard
Demarco devise a monologue sparkling with outrageous claims, scurrilous
criticism and more than a little good sense.
It's simply not enough for him to admit that this is an inspired but
basically pragmatic way to stage two parts of a reportedly stunning
Lithuanian trilogy (To Be Here and The Old Woman by the Oskaro Korsunovo
Groupe) and a 10-performer dance piece (Yvette Bozsik's The Yellow
Wallpaper). No, Demarco fishes around for more connections and
justifications, so that by the time we reach Dundee he's almost
convinced us that it's a crime no-one's done anything like it before.
As long as someone is around with the passion, politics, self-belief,
and lateral thought of Richard Demarco, the Edinburgh Fringe is in the
thrillingly unsafest of safe hands.

The play Fever Pitch has been a monster success, selling out on its
first national tour. Now it's back, as Sara Villiers reports
HE has performed in Macbeth, Richard II, The Hobbit, a Midsummer
Night's Dream, and The Tempest but now Robin Hodson is putting his
theatrical abilities to the test in a one-man show of which it has been
said: ''The play's one part is likely to replace Hamlet as the most
coveted role in British theatre. Certainly it is difficult to think of
another play which features a hero as rounded, complex, or magnetic as
the hero of Fever Pitch.''
Mind you, we can probably take such accolades with a pinch of Saxa's
finest, considering their author is also the author of Fever Pitch, the
book on which the stage play is based. Further, as autobiographical
narrator of An Obsession With Arsenal Football Club, Nick Hornby is also
that very same rounded, complex, and magnetic hero, if not the most
modest.
Competition with Shakespeare aside, Fever Pitch the play has certainly
been a monster success, selling out on its first national tour,
inspiring critics to ever more desperate footballing puns during an
Edinburgh Festival season -- hitting the back of the net ad nauseam --
and transferring to the West End. Now it's back ''by popular demand'',
as they say in the biz, with Hodson replacing Steve North in the role of
Britain's most famous football fanatic in the play's second national
tour.
So, quite a coup Robin? ''Well, my brother's the producer of the show
and I was the cheapest person he knew who would do it,'' he grins. With
the nepotism out in the open he explains that he had previously stage
managed the show which his brother Paul adapted, produced, and directs.
They had always agreed that when Steve got tired of the part Robin would
take a crack at it. ''It's quite fun working with my brother. Usually
when you join a show there are all sorts of status games to play, but
with us it's just loads of in-jokes and cross-references which probably
drive everyone else mad.''
What has been strange is playing a contemporaneous character. ''I
don't think of it as impersonating Nick -- not at all -- and Steve
didn't either. Physically I am more similar to Nick and when some of his
friends came along to see me in the show they said: 'Blimey that's just
like him'. But it has been purely coincidental. I've drawn on my own
experiences and as an actor you do that whether you're playing Richard
II or Nick Hornby.
''Fortunately, or rather unfortunately, I'm almost as obsessive about
football as him,'' he explains. His team of choice is Norwich, and he
admits to Hornbyesque rituals to ensure his team's victory. Not biting
the heads off sugar mice on the way to the ground, but certainly
lighting ciggies at exactly the same moment in the second half of the
match. If Hodson has made the kind of pact with the devil which Hornby
did -- inflicting years of Thatcher on the nation in return for one
Arsenal cup final victory -- then he's not saying. But Labour supporters
can take comfort from the fact that Norwich were relegated last season.
Such idiosyncratic plea-bargaining is central to both the play's
appeal to the public and Hodson's enthusiasm for the part. ''It's that
humour of recognition -- you can see people in the audience giving each
other side-long glances, thinking 'That's you, that is', and for me the
most enjoyable thing about the play is that it gives me a forum to admit
all the ridiculous things I do. A lot of the book is not to do with
football but simply about a guy growing up. Football supporters might
think 'I'm not going to see a play about Arsenal' but it's about lots of
other stuff, like Hornby growing up in the home counties as a wannabee
Londoner.''
Hornby certainly gave the game away in Fever Pitch, exposing
vulnerabilities and setting a confessional tone about the male psyche
which was exceeded only in his second book, the novel High Fidelity,
which disects men's attitude to relationships and general uselessness
thereof.
It's another Hornby ripe for dramatisation and the brothers Hodson,
who jointly run Brighton Theatre Events, would love to stage it but
suspect Walt Disney, who recently purchased the film rights to the book
for #200,000 and are transferring its Camden setting to America, might
not be so keen.
''We were actually first to get a verbal agreement on High Fidelity
from Nick; he agreed when he was a guest on Steve North's radio show
during the Brighton Festival. Perhaps we should take Walt Disney to
court? Somehow I think not. We simply imagined what it would be like to
get a cheque for #200,000 and thought yeah, fair enough Nick. Channel 4
have the film rights for Fever Pitch but have been really good about
letting us carry on with the stage version but I don't think Walt Disney
would be so understanding.''
* Fever Pitch opens tonight at the Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow. Readers
who present this page at the box office this evening or tomorrow can
have two tickets for the price of one, subject to availability.

THE house known familiarly as ''Number One, London'', because it used
to lie just inside the western toll gate, and home to the Dukes of
Wellington since 1817, has re-opened to the public after a
three-and-a-half year closure and renovations costing just over #6m.
Originally built as part of a neo-classical terrace by Robert Adam in
the 1770s, Apsley House now stands alone at the south side of Hyde Park.
The first Duke, who purchased it after his victory at Waterloo in
1815, was not without a sense of humour: Canova's massive nude statue of
Napoleon dominates the staircase with no more than a fig leaf to protect
him.
The house is littered with gifts fron grateful heads of state,
reminders of the Duke's military career. Many of the paintings came from
the Spanish royal collection, including the beautiful Waterseller of
Seville by Velasquez. There are top quality landscapes and scenes of
everyday life by Dutch and Flemish masters, and Sir Thomas Lawrence's
portrait of the Duke, which served as the inspiration for the old #5
note, is on show again. Dinner and dessert services are also prominently
displayed, including the Sevres Egyptian service commissioned by
Napoleon for the Empress Josephine as a divorce present.

JANICE Gray's watercolours are outstanding, amusing and unexpected.
The few works that were part of the Scottish Gallery's Italian Christmas
Show made an impression, but here, in her first solo exhibition with it,
her watercolours have a vibrant impact. The pieces are mostly of
animals, caught in movement or posing, with little or no background and
Gray's explanatory black writing sprinkled across them.
Her imagery can be curious and verges on the self-conscious -- a pig
traversing a hill of electric pylons, a guineafowl and pig totem pole,
an elephant with kiwi fruit on its back. These are not natural
descriptions but you accept them as part of Gray's personal landscape.
This is an artist full of confidence as well as humour, and her pictures
fairly burst out from the walls.
In contrast to her soluble lightness, Simone ten Hompel's work is
stark and minimalist. Using a wide range of metals she creates a variety
of everyday objects as well as abstract pieces. Closer inspection
reveals the emotional impact of her work in the softness of the
interiors and the sparse but telling use of gold leaf.
The mixed summer exhibition alongside has pieces by most of the
gallery's current artists, with Peter McLaren's Cyclist with a Bouquet,
an energetic rush and spatter of colour, as the central piece.

THE Government and the Stock Exchange moved swiftly yesterday to
implement some of the key recommendations of the Greenbury report on
executive pay -- but still could not dispel growing doubts as to whether
they would curb executive greed, especially in the recently privatised
utilities.
In publishing the committee's much-leaked report, Sir Richard
Greenbury, the #807,000-a-year head of Marks and Spencer, admitted there
was no guarantee that it would ensure there was no repetition of British
Gas chairman Cedric Brown's 75% pay rise which caused the row which led
to the setting up of the committee last January.
However, under a proposed code of best practice to be backed up by
revised Stock Exchange rules -- which it was announced yesterday would
come into force in October -- all executive remuneration should be
explained in detail in company annual reports and accounts and be voted
on at annual meetings.
Privatised water and energy companies are urged to review existing
remuneration arrangements, including share-option packages, ''adjust
them on a voluntary basis'' as necessary and make a full report to their
next annual meeting.
Sir Richard, who made it very clear he had not enjoyed chairing the
study group, said that while most companies paid their directors
''sensibly and responsibly'' there had been considerable controversy
over recent cases where some had shown ''mistaken judgment''.
He also made the point that, in general, British directors and
executives remained poorly paid when compared to their counterparts in
the United States.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke acted immediately to withdraw tax
concessions on executive share options, as recommended by Greenbury and
sought by Labour, but it is understood this will affect the ''fat cats''
only to the tune of a few thousands of pounds.
Board of Trade President Ian Lang welcomed the report as being
''authoritative and balanced'' and said its proposals were already
having an affect on some companies.
He accepted there was ''justified'' criticism of some executives but
denied the changes in tax arrangements for executive share options
represented a Government U-turn. It was a ''limited'' change caused by
''changed circumstances'' and in the light of the Greenbury report.
The Institute of Directors gave its full support to the
recommendations, which were described by Sir Bryan Nicholson, CBI
president, as a positive and constructive response to public concern.
However, TUC general secretary John Monks was ''not happy'' with the
report because it failed to recommend legislation. He said it was
''nothing like good enough as voluntary disclosures backed up by a
voluntary code will not stop greedy executives paying themselves
double-figure pay increases''.
Self-regulation had not worked in the past and there was no reason to
believe it would work in the future.
Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Jack Cunningham welcomed the
proposals but said that they did not go far enough. He said this was
''hardly surprising in a set of recommendations on directors'
remuneration drawn up solely by directors''.
A Labour Government would set up a standing advisory committee --
including shareholders, consumers, and employees as well as directors --
to draw up a code of best practice on directors' pay and corporate
governance.
Stock Exchange rules would be amended to enable it to enforce
compliance with the new code by all publicly listed companies.
Shareholders would be given a legal right to vote on remuneration
packages at company annual general meetings as well as to re-elect the
members of the remuneration committee. To prompt this, legislation would
be introduced to give shareholders the right to receive copies of the
company accounts before the annual meeting.
Institutional shareholders, such as pension funds, would be required
to justify to their shareholders how they vote at annual meetings and to
publish a code of conduct for their voting policy.
Executive share-option packages in the privatised utilities --
including those already privatised -- would be outlawed altogether under
a Labour Government.
Labour also would require that remuneration committees would have at
least one wholly independent member -- such as a shareholders'
representative -- who was not a director of another company.
On the issue of ''golden parachutes'', Labour would require severance
payments to be clearly stated in executives' contracts. Directors who
resigned, or were forced to resign, would not be allowed to retain their
share options.
Dr Cunningham said Labour favoured a development of the American
practice of requiring directors to purchase shares in their own
companies through low-interest loans.
This would expose them to losses if the firm performed badly as well
as bringing rewards if it did well, adding that: ''Such a scheme would
have the important effect of motivating all directors to do their best
rather than just resting on their laurels. It would end the present
'one-way bet' on share options through which those holding them always
gain.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said the report, and the Government's
response, meant it would now be up to a Labour Government to tackle the
problem.
''The Greenbury report stops short of tackling the central problem
that had occasioned its creation -- the unacceptable abuses in the
privatised utilities which have so outraged the British public,'' he
said.
''A review followed by a report by the very people responsible for the
excesses is hardly likely to stop the excesses. Self-regulation in the
utilities -- as proposed by Greenbury -- has failed.''
He said the measure of the problem was that there were still
outstanding share-option schemes worth #100m waiting to be picked up by
around 150 directors and executives in the privatised utilities.
He also condemned Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's previous refusal to tax
share options as income which, he claimed, had cost the Exchequer at
least #400m in revenue.
Mr Brown said it was the second time Mr Clarke had been forced to back
down on tax following the Government's defeat last year on VAT on
domestic fuel.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, said: ''Greenbury
leaves the gravy train wheels oiled and still on track. The
recommendations do not go far enough to curb the boardroom excesses in
the privatised utilities.''
The National Association of Pension Funds welcomed the report, which
it said challenged companies and investors.
''It will improve board accountability and understanding by
shareholders of executive directors' remuneration packages,'' said NAPF
chairman Tom Ross.
''Full disclosure and greater accountability is good news for
shareholders. The use of a comprehensive and authoritative set of
guidelines for remuneration committees removes uncertainty on directors'
pay and will allow boards to concentrate on the management and
performance of their company,'' said Mr Ross.

TRAVEL company Lunn Poly last night reduced the price of late breaks
to the Med by #300 in a new round of the summer holiday price war.
The company is also offering thousands of free places for children in
a bid to tempt families during the school holidays.
The latest move comes as high street chains try to get rid of up to
two million package holidays by the end of the summer.
Lunn Poly -- the country's biggest travel agent -- is keeping its
latest offer open only until Saturday.
A spokeswoman for Lunn Poly said: ''There are still a lot of savings
to be had but many holidays are getting booked very quickly.''

A BAR manager who told an industrial tribunal of being chased through
a hotel kitchen by his mother, who had been wielding a knife, has lost
his unfair dismissal claim.
Mr Rodger Burnett, c/o Strawberrybank Road, Kilmarnock, worked in the
Broomhill Hotel in the town's London Road, which was owned by his
mother.
The 29-year-old claimed he had been sacked by her on February 12 this
year after an argument with her in the hotel over his position and
interference with the way he did his job.
Mrs Heather Burnett denied she had fired her son and said he left his
employment after having an argument with his girlfriend.
Mrs Burnett told the tribunal: ''He had upset customers during his
afternoon off but would not sit down to talk about his problems, which
were that he could not control his girlfriend's spending.''
The tribunal noted that Mrs Burnett collapsed after the argument and
was taken to hospital and, a few days later, her son's girlfriend had
punched her and her 67-year-old husband.
Mr Burnett Jr told the tribunal that his mother had sacked him
''millions of times'' before, including once when she attacked him with
a knife and ripped his shirt and jacket.
On that occasion, he claimed, his mother lost her temper after
discovering there was no ice in the ice-maker.
He added that his mother had pulled out the plug in the ice-making
machine to connect her hair tongs and had forgotten to reconnect the
ice-maker.
The tribunal stated that ''it found the evidence of both parties
largely incredible and unreliable'' but on the balance of probabilities,
it did not accept the son's evidence.

A THIEF'S criminal career came crashing to a halt when a teenage rugby
coach brought him down with a timely tackle.
William Bett, 20, was trying to make his getaway after a housebreaking
near Edinburgh's Boroughmuir rugby club when a 17-year-old who was
coaching youngsters intervened.
Depute-fiscal Neil Allen told Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday: ''He
put his apparent expert knowledge of the game to particular use and
brought him down with an almighty thump.
''It was described as a firm rugby tackle,'' the depute-fiscal told
Sheriff Isobel Poole.
Bett and a co-accused Paul Cameron, 23, described as prisoners,
admitted breaking into a house in North Meggetland, Edinburgh, on March
9 this year and stealing cash, jewellery, and other items worth more
than #2200.
Bett and Grant also admitted one charge each of theft involving goods
worth more than #16,000 from other Edinburgh homes.
Sheriff Poole remanded them in custody until July 31 for reports.

<RECORDNO>977338530</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO women yesterday settled a High Court battle over who had the right
to cremate the body of the man they both loved. The judge had pleaded
with them to see sense.
The wife and mistress of Mr David Brinson reached ''entire agreement''
following an hour of talks in a case which has run up a legal aid bill
unofficially estimated in the region of #10,000.
In what is believed to be the first case of its kind this century,
portrait photographer Sally Brinson, 40, of Rowley Avenue, Sidcup, Kent,
who married Mr Brinson in 1977 and had two children with him, applied
for a court ruling that the certificate allowing release of the body for
cremation should be given to her as the surviving spouse and next of
kin.
The mistress, Lorraine Brinson, 40, of Blythe Hill, St Paul's Cray,
Orpington, who took Mr Brinson's name by deed poll after they began
their affair 12 years ago -- counter-claimed that the certificate should
go to her as Mr Brinson and his wife had separated, leaving her and
their two children as his immediate family unit.
Mr Brinson, a private investigator who became wealthy through property
deals, died intestate at the age of 42 from pancreatitis after
becomingill with abdominal pains in May this year.
After the out-of-court talks, Mr Martyn Zeiderman, appearing for Mrs
Sally Brinson, announced to Mr Justice Owen that entire agreement had
been reached ''on each and every point concerning the cremation of the
deceased''.
The two women had battled ever since Mr Brinson's death over who
should receive the certificate for cremation, to whose house the body
should be taken, and, among other things, who should be the pall-bearers
at the funeral.
Successfully urging them to settle the case, Mr Justice Owen had told
them: ''I can only suggest common sense plays it part. The certificate
doesn't seem to matter two ha'p'orth anyway.''
A lawyer said later the certificate would be issued to an undertaker
and the body taken straight to a funeral parlour ready for cremation
within the next few days.
After his collapse, Mr Brinson was taken to hospital and remained
until his death on a life-support machine -- constantly visited by both
women.
Southwark coroner Sir Montague Levine had refused to release the body
to either, leaving them to fight out their claims in court.

A BUS company is to be put off the road after Government inspectors
found coaches with a catalogue of safety defects.
The Department of Transport crackdown follows widespread concern about
the standard of some public service vehicles operating in Paisley.
DoT inspectors uncovered a series of faults during checks on five
buses operated by Bellview Coaches, which runs 19 vehicles. Traffic
commissioners have ordered the company's licence to be revoked from
August 2.
Inspectors have reported the company on several occasions over the
past five years, during which time 12 of its vehicles have been found to
be unroadworthy.
In the latest investigation, vehicles were found with defective brakes
and tyres, loose wheel nuts, a faulty handbrake, and a jammed emergency
exit door.
Dewvale Ltd, which trades as Bellview Coaches, said yesterday it
intended to appeal against the decision.
Mr John Walker, the company's managing director, said: ''It is our
opinion that these are not major faults that would put the general
public in great danger, but are minor faults which should have been
reported by the drivers.''
While he agreed with the vehicle inspectorate's findings, he said he
felt the company's operating licence should have been ''curtailed''
rather than revoked.
Mr Walker added: ''It is our intention to appeal against this decision
and hopefully be successful when we re-apply for our new licence, once
we have rectified our maintenance system.''
He hoped the firm's 24 employees could be found alternative employment
in the short term and that a ''more professional and more organised bus
company'' would be operated if the application for a new licence was
successful.
The latest action followed a threatened clampdown on bus congestion in
the centre of Paisley.
Strathclyde Regional Council's transportation chiefs want to combat
''chaotic'' conditions experienced by motorists and pedestrians in the
town.
Roads officials asked the traffic commissioners to launch an inquiry
after a survey mounted earlier this year by the National Federation of
Bus Users found that as many as 111 buses were passing through the town
centre in a 17-minute spell.
There are now 10 different operators competing for business. Dozens of
motorists have complained to the regional council that buses have
''taken over'' town centre streets in an attempt to win passengers.
A report to councillors revealed how the volume of buses being
operated was bringing town centre traffic to a standstill and leading to
dangerous double parking -- a risk to passengers alighting from buses.
Serious concerns were also expressed over pollution from engines left
running.
The roads and transportation committee called on the traffic
commissioners to investigate the scale of the problem and take any
regulatory action required.
The latest licence cancellation comes eight weeks after another local
company -- Quarriers Coaches -- was forced off the road when a similar
DoT investigation uncovered a series of defects on vehicles.

SCOTRAIL is using train drivers from another union to ensure that
Aslef does not quite achieve a 100% closure of its network today.
Last Friday, the first in a series of six planned one-day stoppages
over pay, no British Rail passenger services ran in Scotland.
Today, ScotRail will operate a modified Glasgow-Ayr timetable by using
drivers belonging to the Rail, Maritime, and Transport Union, whose
members voted against strike action in their ballot.
However, ScotRail admits this will be the only service it will be able
to run.
Mr Phil McGarry, RMT's Scottish divisional organiser, said yesterday:
''ScotRail themselves took the decision to close the entire network on
Friday. What they have probably done now is analyse which unions
particular employees belong to and see that they have a proportion of
RMT drivers working on the Ayr rail corridor.''
Given that a very small proportion of ScotRail train drivers are RMT
members, he seemed surprised that ScotRail was planning to run as many
as 18 services in each direction between Glasgow and Ayr.
''Because we did not get a ballot result, RMT drivers are duty-bound
under the law to work normally. That means work that they would have
done under normal circumstances. Any change to that would have to be on
a voluntary basis. If anyone is being coerced, then we will have to look
at taking corrective action.''
Asked what effect he thought the use of RMT drivers would have on
Aslef's strikes, Mr McGarry said: ''When you have trains starting to
run, that dampens strikers' morale. But we will do everything in our
power in terms of the law to support their action.''
A ScotRail spokesman said he understood that today's arrangements with
RMT drivers had all been agreed on a voluntary basis: ''I do not think
anybody is being forced to do anything. There is no indication of
that.''
Asked why ScotRail had not made similar arrangements last Friday, he
said: ''It had not been agreed then. We had to wait until there were
sufficient numbers rostered in the right way. It just took a bit of
time.''
Aslef Scottish district secretary Pat O'Connor could not be contacted
for comment yesterday.
South of the Border, too, virtually all BR services will be at a
standstill today.
Aslef general secretary Lew Adams said last night he deeply regretted
BR's ''refusal'' to negotiate over the weekend in a bid to head off
today's stoppage. However, his door was ''still open''.
BR, which insists that its 3% offer is final, conceded that very few
trains would be operating.
* ScotRail plans to run 18 services from Ayr to Glasgow and the same
number in the other direction.
Trains from Ayr will leave at: 6am, 7am, 7.30am, 8am, 9am, 10am, 11am,
12noon, 1pm, 2pm, 2.30pm, 3.30pm, 4pm, 4.30pm, 6pm, 7pm, 8pm, and 9pm.
Trains from Glasgow will leave at: 7am, 8am, 9am, 10am, 11am, 11.30am,
12noon, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm, 3.30pm, 5pm, 5.30pm, 6pm, 8pm, 8.30pm, 9pm, and
10pm.
All the trains will call at Newton on Ayr, Prestwick, Prestwick
International, Troon, Barassie, Irvine, Kilwinning, Johnstone, and
Paisley Gilmour Street.

A DIVORCED father, who grew a #10,000 crop of cannabis in his home to
raise money to start a new life with his son, was yesterday jailed for
four years.
Drug squad officers found 125 plants growing in two bedrooms when they
raided Alexander Fairley's home in Fife. Fairley, 45, had borrowed #2500
to finance his drug-growing scheme and travelled to Amsterdam, using
vouchers from a Sun newspaper offer, to buy the cannabis seeds.
He admitted at the High Court in Edinburgh producing a controlled
drug, cannabis, at his home at Allan Park, Hill of Beath, between August
17 last year and January 17 this year. Fairley also plead guilty to
being concerned in the supply of cannabis on January 17 at the house.
Advocate-depute Paul McBride told the court that police arrived at
Fairley's home with a search warrant after receiving information.
They found five large cannabis plants in one bedroom and a further 120
plants, which were about a month away from maturity, in another room
being grown in a soil-less hydroponic system using high-powered lights.
Fairley told police he was growing the crop to raise #10,000 so that
he and his 13-year-old son could leave the Cowdenbeath area. Mr McBride
said Fairley made it plain his son had no knowledge or involvement.
Defence counsel Derek Ogg said Fairley had secured custody of his son
months before. He had smoked cannabis and found it useful for depression
and stress.
The crop at his home was the first batch of plants he had grown. Mr
Ogg pointed out it was perfectly legal to possess or sell cannabis seeds
in this country and the cultivation system could be purchased from
commercial firms.

BY midday at McGrath's bar in Ballycotton the chat is swerving towards
the imperative: ''Isn't it the divil, lads, that a man can't stand
behind the privacy of his own bedroom window, in his underpants, without
some feller taking a snap of him and then making off like a weasel in a
bush . . .'' A dozen pints are raised in mutual accord. Not since the
word was out about the EU's damning policy on fishing has Ballycotton
been so united in disgust. But let us tell the tale from the beginning.
The other week Marlon Brando's mountainous girth arrived in
Ballycotton, a tiny Irish fishing village on the edge of the western
world. He came amid its 500 people and five pubs, trailing the
incongruous satellites of a movie on location: 120 technicians; three
co-stars (Debra Winger, Johnny Depp, and John Hurt); dozens of
carpenters, painters and tradesmen, and, of course, the trespassing
paparazzi. Hardly had the actor, now 71, touched down in County Cork
than a snooper's lens defied security men patrolling the gardens of his
rented residence, snatching a picture of the actor almost in the nude,
as he tried to open a window in Shanagarry House.
Brando was volcanically upset. He had hoped this movie, Divine Rapture
, would return him to his ''Irish roots'', but now there was talk of his
pulling out of the #16 million production, a possibility already aired
after the April suicide of his daughter, Cheyenne. Yet here we are, one
week on, and Brando, in sunny mood, has been discussing applying for
Irish citizenship with the Minister of Culture.
That mythic Irish grandmother is once again the lure, but Brando also
claims a Dubliner for a great-grandfather, a bold bucko who rode the
seas to Americay, rejoicing in the name of Myles O'Gahan.
Ballycotton will earn about #3 million from Thom Eberhardt's
low-budget black comedy in which the village plays a place called
Glenskillen with Brando its parish priest.
Back in McGrath's on Main Street, the owner, Sean McGrath waits
philosophically for a fight to erupt in the bar, and at least one chair
to fly through the window. Like many premises nearby his has won a role
in the movie which will alter the pulse of Ballycotton for the next six
weeks. The Cliff Palace ballroom has been transformed into the Flamingo
Lingerie factory, and the decommissioned Protestant church has undergone
an overnight conversion to Catholicism, providing the taciturn Brando
with his very own pulpit.
''The film people had hoped to use our own Church the Star of the Sea,
but the local bishop refused permission for fear of it being mocked.
They say the script is a bit strong in places, but all the locals are
very relaxed about it'' says McGrath.
Four miles away is Ballymaloe House, internationally fabled for its
sophisticated Irish cooking; a favourite hide-away, some claim, for
unnamed royals and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Brando, however, is staying in
the home of one of the country's nouveau landlords, an English antique
dealer whose rent is #4000 a week.
''You'll find the locals might buy a new car with their money''
reflects McGrath. ''Or maybe they'll extend the house and do things up.
This film is one more way for us to move into the future because the
days of looking over the half-door are gone. Even so it won't change
much in Ballycotton.''
Six good-sized trawlers are included in the village fishing fleet but
Baile Coitin, the village of small boats ,is mostly known for individual
angling records and the fact that the former Irish prime minister,
Charles Haughey, has cast a line there during holidays.
''I'd say around this area he'd be just as well-known as Brando, and
certainly the more infamous of the two.''
Rural Ireland has often absorbed mega-celebrities into its ancient
rhythms. John Huston put his feet up in Connemara for years, and shortly
Bill Clinton is expected to announce an Irish visit, following in the
path of those American presidents who try frantically to rouse the Irish
vote back home by trekking to their suddenly acknowledged forebears
buried in the paupers' graves of the Famine.
But who today remembers Ronald Reagan's spiritual home of Ballyporeen
where the single legacy of that noisy pilgrimage seems to be some street
lighting and a public lavatory in the town centre? Still, in Ballycotton
they're saying you only have to look at Marlon Brando to see this lost
American goes back to Brian Boru.
Even in the baloney season it's a nice try, but then this is a village
whose only street leads nowhere. That is, nowhere up to now.

Mladen Grbin discusses the language of genocide which is employed to
justify wholescale slaughter
THE tragic conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and the largely Serb
aggression against the non-Serbs, has given us a new vocabulary. The
United Nations, Nato, European security and human rights, when mirrored
against the developments of the former Yugoslavia, have lost their
meaning in terms of denoting the fundamental values we believed we had
learned in the wake of the Second World War.
There is one particular semantic concept which occurs regularly now
across the media, and that is ''ethnic cleansing''. The expression is
often used to accompany the gruesome images of hundreds of thousands of
people on the move who during the last four years have peered from our
TV screens. It is often explained in terms of forced migrations or
removal of people from their homes, with a repeated conclusion that it
is perpetrated by the Balkan people stemming from, some would say,
thousands of years of ethnic and religious strife.
There is an overriding note that all sides in the conflict are to
blame for these excesses, and that this comes out of their almost
congenital propensity for violence and barbarism, enshrined in their
psyche and confirmed through their history.
These so-called explanations are a form of propagandism, which uses a
revisionist view of history, and often denial to obscure, intentionally
or otherwise, the real nature of the conflict, its terms of reference
within, and the meaning of the vocabulary used in relation to it.
Perhaps more important, they are also used to obscure our endeavour in
the West to remove ourselves from the morass, to give an impression that
we are neutral observers with the best of humanitarian motives.
Ethnic cleansing is a euphemism for a method by which genocide is
achieved, a method which, in turn, is underpinned by an ideology of
difference, and therefore racist in nature. The United Nations
Convention for the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide of
1946 defines it as an intent to destroy in whole or in part a national,
ethnic, racial or religious group by killing, causing mental and bodily
harm, and creating conditions where it can be reasonably calculated that
these may bring physical destruction; acting to prevent births within
the group, and transferring the children from one group to another. Not
only is the actual commitment of genocide punishable, but also
conspiracy, incitement, or complicity in it.
We find all these elements within the experience of the non-Serb
people in Bosnia and Hercegovina. The ideology that drives the Serbian
political and military elites to utilise these methods is not without
historical precedent.
The seed of this can be found in the book Nacertanje (Design), written
in 1844 by a Serbian intellectual and politician, Ilija Garasanin. It
argued for the idea of a Greater Serbia based on the principle of ethnic
exclusivity. It also suggested that wherever a Serb might be living,
that land should be assumed within the borders of Greater Serbia.
This notion ran hand in hand with that of another notable
intellectual, Vuk Karadzic, in his article All Serbs and Everywhere
(1836). This referred to most of the territory of former Yugoslavia, and
beyond.
There is a clear continuum in this belief so that, for example, Stojan
Protic, leader of the Serbian Popular Radical Party, and later to become
Yugoslavia's first prime minister, declared, in referring to the ethnic
Muslims in Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1917, whom he called ''Turks'',
that he would give them 24 hours, or even two days, to return to their
ancestral region. Those who did not would be cut down.
In 1938 the Serbian politician Vasa Cubrilovic had a similar recipe
for the majority Albanian population of Kosovo. Equally, after the
collapse of the Yugoslav government and monarchy under the onslaught of
the Nazis in 1941, Draza Mihailovic, a monarchist and former Serbian
officer, who styled himself as a resistance leader of the so-called
Chetniks, and who later collaborated with the Nazi occupiers, called for
a homogenous Serbia, meaning the creation of a Greater Serbia over the
territories of Bosnia and Hercegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Croatia,
and parts of Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. Orders were issued
to cleanse the lands of all non-Serb elements.
The Serbs are not the only nation in the territory of former
Yugoslavia who had such notions and, indeed, put them into practice.
They themselves suffered from ethnic cleansing in the Second World War,
particularly in some parts of Bosnia, Hercegovina and Croatia. However,
this continuum is only evident on the part of the Serbs in their attempt
to marry this notion of territory and the people, and their devising of
a legitimisation process to present it as acceptable. There is sometimes
a tendency to refer to themselves as the ''heavenly people'', therefore
bestowing upon the territorial and political ambition, religious
authority as well.
In this pattern of justification for territorial expansionism, it is
very difficult to discern what may be brinkmanship, negotiating position
or, indeed, pathology. Although this brief glance at the historical
references does not explain what is happening, we can see why it is
happening.
In addition to bringing misery, death and destruction of the cultural
and spiritual heritage, ethnic cleansing is an expression of the
tendencies and ambitions of the political and military elites to fulfil
this most strange concept, mixing ideology, land, national state,
religion and martyrdom, where the aggressor becomes a victim for having
to do these awful deeds in the name of fulfilling a self-proclaimed
pledge.
National existence, in these terms, must then be justified by and
through methods which in turn become genocide. This we witnessed earlier
when Europe lost six million Jews, among others, on account of such an
ideology.
The Nuremberg trials provided redress for the last genocide in Europe.
The genocide in Bosnia and Hercegovina has been confirmed by the UN War
Crimes Commission, and the Warburton Report on systematic rape, and our
own daily witness through the media are evidence. The moral equivalence
between victim and aggressor which is now being offered to explain away
the burden of our own witness to this genocide will be difficult to
sustain in sight of the facts.

POLITICIANS rarely miss the opportunity to be predictable. When the
merger of the departments of Education and Employment was announced,
within minutes Opposition MPs gave the kneejerk reaction of wondering
whether the unemployed were being forgotten about.
Then came the Scottish reaction. Where did it leave Scotland, and in
particular the devolved Scottish Education Department within the
Scottish Office? Inevitably, no-one was looking to see if there were any
positive gains to be made from the merger.
Yet Scotland is already facing its own mini merger which was drawn up
months before the present reshuffle. Although it is still out to
consultation, by November the Scottish Education Department and the
Industry Department at the Scottish Office will become one, under the
direction of Gerry Wilson, the present top civil servant at Education,
but someone with years of experience at industry also.
Fortunately the early retirement of the amiable Peter Mackay as head
of the Industry Department this October makes the changes at the top
occur with the minimum of fuss.
At the next few layers of Civil Service life the merger may be more
painful as up to 30 posts in middle management disappear. It is easy
then to portray the move as simply a cost-saving exercise. But away from
such simplistic reactions the merger of two such important divisions
could at last allow the Government to tackle one of Scotland's most
serious problems.
Everyone has known what it is for years -- why are we not equipping
our children leaving school with the skills they will need to find jobs?
Now Education and Industry can stop blaming each other. With one
department to deal with in Scotland then real progress should be
possible.
Yes, there are worries. Educationalists always want to protect
Scotland's broad-based educational system, arguing there is more to
their job than churning out cannon fodder for capitalism's satanic
mills. Many teenagers though would be quite happy to clock in at a
satanic mill somewhere than turning into their twenties, as many do,
without ever having a proper job.
At least there has been some progress in breaking down the barriers
between education and industry. Enterprise companies have been fostering
partnerships between education and business. More teachers are going on
placements into industry to see how the world of profit and loss
actually works.
Employers are being encouraged to go into the classroom more to say
what they are looking for. And there is barely a secondary school now
which does not have some simulated business scheme to make their senior
pupils at least consider entrepreneurship.
Again, as we all know, as business becomes more global it is the
people with skills who will find work, so are we giving young people the
proper skills?
Certainly it's a word being bandied around a lot more. Scottish
Enterprise has only just created the post of Head of Skills, with the
enthusiastic Evelyn McCann in charge. Funnily enough, Scottish
Enterprise was a bit sniffy about the Scottish CBI suggesting that more
had to be done on skills training, but with this new appointment it
would appear to be that deep down SE agreed with the CBI.
One of the criticisms in the past has been that Scotland's local
enterprise companies have been hamstrung by having to stick to national
training regimes for the unemployed imposed by the Department of
Employment. But that is not the complete story. There has been enough
flexibility in the system for some creative thinking, such as Scottish
Enterprise's Skillseekers programme for young unemployed.
It meant giving the young what are called training credits which could
be spent with actual employers -- modern apprenticeships in effect --
rather than leaving them in the artificial world of training companies.
It leads to more jobs, and is being expanded now throughout the country.
Now Evelyn McCann and Scottish Enterprise are considering what schemes
can have similar successes with adult unemployed, although they accept
the problems are greater.
What has also been identified is the need, obviously, for more
businesses to be started up in Scotland. And this is an area where the
education system may also be failing. If you want a business to succeed
then you want your brightest and most able to start it. Yet many
Scottish university graduates think no higher than accountancy, law, or
a lowly job in a major PLC.
In America, in institutions like the MIT at Boston, students start up
their own businesses before they even qualify. Yet Glasgow University
estimates that only 88 of its students in the past five years, in other
words 88 out of about 15,000, are self-employed. And many of that tiny
number are self-employed musicians and writers who are hardly on their
way to running business empires. Of course others will go on to start
their own companies after a few years as wage earners, but nevertheless
it is hardly a comforting figure.
It seems there is more help for a redundant coal miner to start his
own business -- and how many of them survive -- than a student with a
bright idea who should have his or her naive enthusiasm nurtured.
So even if the Industry and Education merger in Scotland was
originally motivated by financial savings, it does present
opportunities. Of course, how far organisational change by itself makes
a difference has to be questioned.
But if the new department begins with innovative ideas about how
Scotland can produce the skilled people needed to create wealth in an
increasingly competitive world then the merger can prove to be crucially
important for the country. It might even prove to be more important than
the endless chattering about which politician fills which post at the
Scottish Office itself.

Some have blamed general indifference to Bosnia on compassion fatigue.
Images of agony open not only the public's eyes but also purses and
wallets, but as the plight of Bosnia continues, Kirsty Scott explains
how much-needed donations can just as easily dry up as people recoil in
horror
SOMETIMES it takes just one defining image to rouse the public,
something that manages to encapsulate all of the suffering; and the
young woman in the red cardigan may yet do it for Bosnia.
The picture of her hanging from a tree near Tuzla was just one of a
series of pitiful snapshots which made it into print at the weekend as
Srebrenica fell and another batch of refugees were forced onto the roads
in the former Yugoslavia.
Between Friday night and yesterday morning the Red Cross had taken
#35,000 in telephone donations, and other major charities were waiting
hopefully for an influx of cash and concern.
It's been a long time coming. Where the Rwandan crisis brought #10m
for one UK charity alone, and Brent Spar took the man in the street
along to his local filling station with a placard, Bosnia has become the
issue the public wants to forget.
''Within the last few days things have picked up, but prior to that it
was becoming very difficult because the conflict has now been going on
for four years and it seems to become very much more complicated for
people to understand exactly what is going on and who's fighting who,''
said Colin McCallum of the Red Cross.
''When people in the UK see the pictures of suffering, which they have
over the past few days, then the response is a great deal better. In
some ways that is ironic that you need to see the worst sort of images
in order for people to really respond. For an agency like the Red Cross
these sort of things really do make a difference.''
Some have blamed the general indifference to Bosnia on compassion
fatigue, where charitable instincts have been subdued by long-running
and high-profile crises like Rwanda. Most aid agencies, however, say
Bosnia has created its own unique set of fundraising problems.
''It's something special to Bosnia,'' said John McGrath of Oxfam.
''Our experience is that over the last couple of years our appeals for
Bosnia have seen declining returns.
''I think what has depressed people is more to do with what's
happening in Bosnia than compassion fatigue. I think people feel it's a
situation with no end. They feel that if the politicians can't sort it
out or don't have the will to sort it out then what can the public do?
People do like to see a fairly simple situation where the aid agencies
can be seen to be effective.''
Oxfam has just launched a new appeal for the region and has raised
#3000 so far. ''Obviously we are grateful but the fact is that we are
spending about #200,000,'' said McGrath.
At the warehouse where the charity Edinburgh Direct Aid stores its
supplies for Bosnia, spokesman Norrie Bird said it was a constant
struggle to come up with the goods.
''It's exceptionally frustrating because the tragedy in Bosnia is an
on-going thing. People are dying literally every day, whether it be from
murder, sniper fire, malnutrition, or suicide. It's happening day after
day after day for three years. I think also there is a great deal of
awareness of how badly the UN has handled the whole situation. People
don't like to get egg on their face. Because Britain is in the UN, maybe
British people feel that it is our country which is helping to cock
things up.''
For psychology expert Dr Geoff Scobie of Glasgow University the answer
to the indifference may lie in our own instincts to protect ourselves
from distressing or emotional images.
''When we see fairly horrendous pictures that upsets us emotionally
and therefore we have some sort of mechanism which prevents us getting
quite so emotionally upset the next time we see something. When people
are working in an area like this, it's said they become hardened, and
it's that sort of mechanism coming into operation.
''In a vicarious way when you watch television you are not actually
there but you do still empathise and therefore we are affected by what
we see and that defence mechanism operates. If there are lots of other
things being presented or being presented continuously then we become
hardened in that sense.''
Our sense of what's happening may also be tainted by confusion over
fantasy and reality.
''One of the difficulties that we always have is that we see the news,
which is supposed to be real, then we watch Stallone, which is not
supposed to be real, but the same sort of thing is happening, people are
being blown up and so on,'' he said. ''You have to assess the reality of
the situation; what is real, what is true. That's a judgment that is
quite difficult for some people to make. Some people might respond to
the news as if Stallone or Arnie are doing their bit for America. In
that sense it is possible to switch into the fantasy mode instead of the
reality mode in a war situation.''
Yet, while he feels the Bosnian crisis has been distorted by UN
involvement and the fact that people have been apportioning blame, he
doesn't think the apathy will be permanent. ''If the situation is
resolved and the sides get together and say we need millions of pounds
to put things right, people will respond to that in a rather different
way.''
While they wait for the response to change, few aid officials will
credit one single image with galvanising the public. Many say, however,
that unforgettable images can give just the right amount of prodding,
like the picture of the dead mother and baby from Goma, and, maybe, like
the young woman twisting in the wind near Tuzla.
''We have been getting calls where people have been referring to the
sight of all the refugees, the mothers and children walking down the
road and the sense that they only had five minutes to pick up all their
things and leave,'' said Colin McCallum. ''But among the images that
picture of the young woman did make a huge difference.''

ABOUT the wettest part of the July holidays is the expression doon the
watter. In English it means sailing on the Clyde estuary, except it has
not become English. Dictionaries will not have the words. They remain
stowaways. Now is the time for all good users of the language to throw
them overboard. They are phoney.
Worse than a crude invention, they are patronising to boot.
Holidaymakers who went to Clyde resorts as an annual devotion, as to
Mecca, did not say doon the watter.
Regulars who favoured Saltcoats said they were going to Saltcoats. If
Rothesay was the destination, they admitted it. Even if Dunoon, they
owned up. When they talked about taking a day's sail, mumbling about the
watter did not arise.
Yet it must have come from somewhere. If it was never natural usage,
somebody tried to put the words in people's mouths. As for much else
that goes awry, it is tempting to blame the newspapers.
Long after citizens ceased to crowd river beaches at Glasgow Fair, the
newspapers, bless their socks, would not let the story go. Pictures
continued to appear of dwindling Central Station queues. Headline
writers kept sticking yarns about the annual exodus on front pages.
Loyalty to exodus knew no bounds. It appeared for many long wet Julys
after the lieges fled in mobs no more. Exodus was not lightly
surrendered. Newspaper people showed off that they had retained
something from good attendance at Bible classes. Even less lightly will
they give up doon the watter.
Its quaint survival appeared to be a problem to lay at the feet of Joe
Fisher, former librarian, city polymath, and compiler of The Glasgow
Encyclopedia. Regrettably, he accepts the phrase as a genuine product of
the patois. People said it, he said. ''Are you suggesting that some
journalist made it up?'' he asked.
He recalled that the first river mariners were toffs. Even before
Henry Bell puts his Comet in the water, the city's new industrial rich
had started to colonise the firth. With the coming of steam paddleboats
they spread themselves. Some of them commuted to work. Public transport
had to become fairly cheap before working-class passengers got aboard.
Along with their holiday luggage they brought doon the watter. But did
they?
Here and there in his encyclopedia Joe Fisher permits the phrase to
blot his precise prose. For instance, he writes:
''By the 1870s the increasing demand for passenger services (fuelled
by the rise of the tourist trade and by the ability of the working class
to afford and enjoy a trip 'doon the watter') had produced three
paddle-steamers which are now regarded as the best ever made.''
Of these three boats the first was the Lord of the Isles, which went
to Inveraray, followed by the Columba that could carry 2000 passengers
at 21 knots. The third was the Ivanhoe, which was dry. It had nae drink.
What astonishing amounts of refreshment were consumed on most other
boats was a coarse side of river sailing. Many steamers, even on
Sundays, became, floating howffs. Decent voyagers took to tee-total
boats like the Ivanhoe for a peaceful passage.
But however excessive was Clyde boozing, it much enriched the
language. Two colourful phrases came out of it.
Into the local lingo went the idea of going to see the engines, which
translated to the formal declaration by a pater familias that he was off
below decks for a drink. And if he bided, on his return he was said to
be steamboats.
Some strange uncertainty persists about the derivation of steamboats.
In The Patter, the street guide to Glasgow speech by Michael Munro, its
entry reads ''a picturesque if somewhat inexplicable word for drunk.''
Steamboats is straightforward. Although even pocket dictionaries
contain about 100 different ways to say drunk, they have never been
enough for the folk poets who dwell on the banks of the Clyde. They have
always invented their own more precise words. So there came the likes of
stotious. Another beauty is blootered. And there is steamboats. It came
in when the boats did.
Much raw experience went into the coining of steamboats. It took its
shape in the mouths of the people. Doon the watter, for its part, was
manufactured for print. It started as a clever-dick idea.
Notice how Joe Fisher in his encyclopedia fences the phrase with
quotation marks. When it surfaces in the papers, there is almost always
the same cautious scaffolding around it. If doon the watter is still not
an accepted part of the patois, then it never was. It has no roots in
the local tongue.
My guess is it's a comparatively recent fabrication. It could have
appeared as recently as the middle 1930s and around the middle of July.
And, yes, probably in a newspaper.
Manfully seeking another way to express exodus, an inventive headline
writer came up with doon the watter. The words have survived only
because every summer they are refreshed with more ink. Real Clyde
voyagers have never given them cargo space.
Amen to this lesson, except to wonder who was the begetter. An
inventive reporter on a slow holiday weekend for news? On the Sunday
Post, perhaps? Blame for so much of what ails the land and its language
gets lumped on the Post. But it can take it. Its shoulders are broad.

THE news that the Secretary of State is to seek a more positive
attitude from the Department of Transport and the Franchise Director
towards the Fort William sleeper service is most welcome. However, the
sleeper service from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Bristol and Plymouth is
just as deserving of his regard, even though it may lack the
metropolitan glamour of the former.
This service was one of the most convenient of the various ways to
make that journey and one which gives the traveller the longest time at
his destination. Over many years I have used it for business and for
personal journeys, both to the West Country and to the Birmingham area.
Twenty-five years ago that train was one of the heaviest on BR,
frequently loading to 18 cars, including sitting accommodation. In 1978
one joined it at 2355 in Glasgow, or 2340 in Edinburgh. It stopped in
Birmingham until 0700 and reached Bristol at 0848.
Those timings were certainly more attractive to me than the ones on
offer latterly when you had to be on the train in Glasgow by 2130 to be
trundled across to Edinburgh before beginning the journey south at 2255.
You were then decanted to Bristol at 0612, the Birmingham and Cheltenham
stops were no more, also the sit-up accommodation, the only benefit
being an arrival in Plymouth correspondingly earlier.
The quality and marketing of services from Scotland to the larger
English cities not served by trains going to London, never very good,
has overall been in decline for a long time, notwithstanding the very
welcome Intercity cross-country services. The loss of this sleeper
service is a further step down the ladder.
I count many railwaymen among my friends, having once worked on BR,
and I find they share my disbelief in the costs alleged and in the
methods adopted to assess them. The actual savings which would be
realised by closure are most unlikely to reach the sums inferred, while
the loss of revenue, both direct and contributory, will probably far
exceed those savings.
In other words these services are a worthwhile part of the total rail
network. They are quite simply being made the victims of destructive
accountancy.
May we hope therefore that the Minister will seek to preserve, within
the basic framework, both the Fort William-London and the Scotland-West
Country sleeper services.

KNOWING that in my youth I was one of the ''railway children'' -- my
father was a station master and I grew up surrounded by signalmen,
porters, booking clerks, and platelayers -- several friends have said to
me that they didn't know what all the fuss is about with the threatened
privatisation of BR.
After all, they say, before nationalisation in 1946 the railways were
privately owned. I say, ''Yes, but . . . ''
In bygone days there were dozens of small railway companies which
gradually coalesced by 1923 into the big four people remember, LMS etc.
Each of these companies, small or large, was an entity in itself; it
owned its own track, engines, rolling stock, and so on.
What is happening now is that the track is to be owned by one company,
rolling stock to be leased by another, and both charging other companies
for the privilege so one gets the situation where, say ScotRail, has to
pay for the use of rolling stock it once owned. A totally ridiculous
state of affairs.
The idea of having 25 railway operating companies together with
goodness knows how many subsidiaries, track owners, and train renters is
sheer lunacy.

PETER RAMSAY continues to ignore the economic impact which greater
housing investment would have (July 15). In this he is not alone: a
succession of Chancellors and wise men in No 11 Downing Street have
taken the same narrow view. There are a number of reasons why this
neglect is mistaken.
Taking the direct impact on jobs first of all, it is true that many
programmes of public investment may influence the timing or location of
private investment. However, Mr Ramsay is sadly out of touch if he
thinks that the beneficiaries of Shelter's programme of investment would
otherwise be buying homes.
The people who need the additional 36,000 rented homes which we have
proposed are simply out in the cold as far as current housing provision
goes: doubling up with other families, living in ramshackle caravans, or
doing the circuit of hostels and bed and breakfast.
Meeting their needs would hardly affect the home-ownership market. In
fact, separate analysis of the job-creation impact of housing investment
suggests that at least three-quarters of the jobs would be entirely
additional.
The second point is that a planned programme of housing investment
over five years is completely different from the highly volatile
environment of speculative development which currently prevails. This
environment is hostile to training and to enhancing job quality, storing
up long-term problems for the construction industry.
On the other hand, a greater public role input in housing investment
could be accompanied by training schemes, local labour usage, and better
security for employees. This would enhance the long-term productive
capacity of the economy.
The third point is that the housing-economy relationship goes far
beyond the short to medium-term impact of job creation. The experience
of England over the last few years shows that an ill-functioning housing
market has the potential to pull the whole country into deeply damaging
recession.
Scotland escaped the worst of the housing market downturn largely
because of our more balanced share of renting and owning. Yet Scottish
Office policy continues to pursue maximum home ownership as a goal.
Shelter's proposed programme of housing investment seeks a sustainable
balance; true choice between renting and owning. Given that fewer and
fewer people will have steady and secure incomes, this seems entirely
sensible.
The main point of departure between Shelter and Mr Ramsay (and the
current Government) is that we have no predetermined dogmatic view of
public expenditure as bad. Within the finite levels of public resources
all the benefits which public spending would bring have to be examined
along with what our priorities as a society are.
Shelter happens to have the conviction that it is a basic right that
everyone should be able to have a secure and affordable home. People who
do not share that conviction cite economic restraints. Our detailed
analysis shows that such an expedient prop is no longer tenable.

SO now we have another uproar over the amount won by the new lottery
winners. Why? What's so obscene and unfair when an ordinary family hit
the jackpot? What is it that makes church leaders and politicians
clamour for changes to reduce the amounts won by ordinary people?
What makes them think that ordinary people are undeserving and unable
to manage huge amounts of money? And why do they assume it only leads to
misery and discontent for ordinary people?
The same approach is not afforded to the many thousands of extremely
rich people in our country (from royalty down).
We don't hear any clamour for them to reduce their wealth and give to
the poor. Why are they always regarded as having an absolute right to
wealth? And as for the poor -- look around -- they buy more scratch
cards and lottery tickets than anyone else.
It is timely to remind church leaders and politicians, etc, that the
multi-million pounds donated each week by ordinary people to the lottery
have so far been won by the most undeserving -- the extremely wealthy
Winston Churchill, for instance -- and they should make their protests
to the Government to widen the benefits of this ''voluntary tax'' to
more useful, deserving and humane causes, and not left to National
Heritage to decide.
Well done to the new ordinary winners, their win is well deserved. We
wish them every happiness and know that they will be more sensible with
their money than National Heritage.

WHEN Dick Douglas is appointed to chair the Water and Sewerage
Customers' Council he is condemned as ''a lapdog'', as ''working with
the system'', and as ''playing footsie'' with the Government, by your
columnist Brian Wilson (July 14).
And yet I clearly heard the same Brian Wilson ask the following,
rhetorical question on Good Morning Scotland: ''Is it better to be
participants or spectators?''
He was, however, in this instance loyally defending Tony Blair's
decision to play footsie with Rupert Murdoch, providing further
evidence, if it were needed, of the double standards New Labour is happy
to employ in its rush to ''reconstruct ideologies'' (to quote Mr Blair)
in order to win, at any cost, in the South-east of England.

FOLLOWING the contributions of Messrs Russell and Mackay (July 11),
can I share with you the little anonymous quote that arrived on my desk
this morning?
''A lot of fellows who spout so profusely about capital and labour
never had any capital and never did any labour''.
From a very quick reading of the two aforementioned letters, this
seems to me to be a not inappropriate contribution to the subject under
discussion.

WHEN I am old and grizzled I will be able to tell awed grandchildren
that I crossed the Kyleakin ferry on the day the span of the Skye bridge
was completed. A strange day it was, close and thundery. A helicopter
hovered overhead; assorted reporters and TV crews milled about Kyle of
Lochalsh. There was still daylight in the gap of the bridge as we
crossed, about midday. But, a little after four, the last section was
jacked into place.
The bridge should be operational by the end of September. It is not as
ugly as once many feared -- a fine sweeping line -- though its
devastating impact on Eilean Ban, the lighthouse island supporting a
main pier, would appall the late Gavin Maxwell. Unlike the ferry, it
will be weatherproof and safe; a constant, reliable fixed link.
Many of us, though, view the surge in public interest with great
cynicism. There was little coverage given to bridge politics six years
ago, when the scheme was driven through by the authorities. Hence the
people of Skye, and of the Outer Isles served by Uig, had a bridge
forced on them on outrageous Thatcherite lines. The bridge -- unlike
those at Kessock, Kylescu or Ballachulish -- will not be free. It will
be a toll bridge, though all other toll bridges in Britain are optional.
If you don't want to pay your 40p at the Forth you can drive round.
The people of Skye will have no alternative. If they shun the bridge in
summer, they must resort to the other ferry links. In winter, at
present, these ferry links close for months. And the Skye bridge toll is
far from nominal. For at least three decades travellers must pay a
whopping levy, commensurate to the present ferry charge -- #5 and more
for a one-way trip by car.
Even pedestrians will be charged to cross; at present, CalMac carries
them free. And Kyleakin, bypassed by the bridge, will find its shops and
services stripped of much custom.
This bizarre scheme was hatched by the Thatcher Government to save
money: Millar-Dwyadig would build the bridge at its own expense, and
recoup tolls for sufficient time to meet the cost. Government and
company insist that, one day, tolls will cease and the bridge will be
free. Well, we shall see.
Media enthusiam, then, is matched rather less on Skye. There will be
no economic advantage from the bridge; haulage costs will still be
passed on to customers. Skye has lost its island magic without gaining
the asset of free access. Some tourists may shun the island, or spend
far less time on it. Many will begrudge paying a fiver to cross on a
boring bridge, which they would happily spend on a sail.
It is easy to point fingers. Highland Regional Council must bear much
guilt; it was bedazzled into embracing the scheme, when it was
manifestly unpopular in Skye. Brian Wilson and the West Highland Free
Press have powerfully campaigned for ''over the sea -- toll free!'', but
have quite failed to win a manifesto commitment from Labour to abolish
the tolls. The local MP, Charles Kennedy, did not acquit himself well.
CalMac must bear much of the blame. For half a century it operated the
Kyleakin gold mine; only in the past decade, however, did it, in panic,
start to improve the service.
Passengers paid fares until 1984. There was no 24-hour service until
1989. New vessels, urgently needed, did not arrive until 1991, following
two or three summers of appalling delays and some spectacular
near-accidents. The bridge has come anyway and state-owned CalMac is
forbidden to compete with it.
The only fellow enjoying all this is the redoubtable Roddy Macleod,
operator of the private Kylerhea ferry, who stands to gain a great deal
from disgruntled tourists who want to speed on a bonnie boat. But the
Kylerhea ferry, though spectacularly scenic and most charming, has poor
road access and would have great difficulty running in winter.
With what joy, then -- what very joy -- do we learn of serious plans
for a rival ferry service. Angry local entrepreneurs have formed the
Skye Boat Company and plan to acquire a car ferry and run it against the
bridge, using the existing slips. It appeared that Highland Regional
Council might stymie them; the Kyle terminals were due to vanish under
new ''promenade'' landscaping. But, hit by a host of objections, the
council is now sending out plain hints that it may not stand in the
ferrymen's way.
There is one great difficulty: where can they find a boat? Ideally,
the Skye Boat Company seeks a 12-car vessel of drive-through operation.
An elderly CalMac bowloader, one option they thought of pursuing, was
given up as too small and inconvenient. But second-hand drive-through
ships of suitable size are hard to find.
As an expert in the field of Highland ferries, may I make a reminder
and a suggestion? First, there are actually four terminals on the
Kyleakin passage. There are the two steep slips CalMac's double-ended
boats at present use. But there are also two side-loading berths, of
shallower incline, used by the original turntable ferries at Kyleakin.
These, as far as I am aware, are still operable. This increases the
available options. Why doesn't the Skye Boat Company find a
corner-loading craft, or a surviving turntable ferry or two?
There are three corner-loading boats working in Scotland the Belnahua
(1973) at Luing, operated by Strathclyde Regional Council, is probably
too small. At Corran, Highland Regional Council runs much better boats,
the Rosehaugh (1967) and the Maid of Glencoul (1975), refugees from the
Kessock and Kylescu runs respectively.
I gather that the Rosehaugh may be available for sale; indeed, Roddy
Macleod at Kylerhea has his eye on her. (But he must first enlarge his
existing slipways.) There are growing whispers that CalMac may take over
the Corran ferry service using end-loading craft.
Macleod's craft, the six-car Ballachulish exile Glenachulish (1969) is
the last turntable ferry running in Scotland. Others have found new life
as fish farm workboats, or rot on various remote beaches. But there are
three turntable craft which could still exist and may still be operable,
all last heard of in the ownership of Highland Regional Council. The
Queen of Kylescu (1967) was still running in 1984. The old Corran
vessels, Glenmhor (1964) and Lochaber (1974) might still be about. Of
similar design, the first two could carry six cars; the Lochaber, last
and largest of the turntable ferries, could load an impressive nine.
Does anyone know where these boats are now and whether they could
still work as car ferries, or be readily restored to that purpose? Then
the Skye Boat Company might be glad to hear from them.
At present, it talks of buying a second-hand double-ended ship from
Scandinavia. Call me a sentimentalist, but I'd like to see a pair of
turntable ferries back at Kyle, and if old ones cannot be found, then
the Skye Boat Company should think seriously of building a pair. These
craft are part of the West Highland tradition, offered drive-through
operation on a small and convenient scale, and would be hugely popular
with tourists. I suggest replicas of the Troon-built Lochalsh (1957) and
Kyleakin (1960), two of the bonniest Highland ferries ever built.

IT appears that the Union Jack at Inverness Castle has mysteriously
disappeared (July 12).
Why is it that the Union flag was flown at all? ''Ah,'' says the
Establishment, ''the law courts were in session.'' But are we not led to
believe that Scots law is unique and distinctive to our nation? And is
the Union Jack the Scottish flag?
Is it any wonder that it has disappeared? The Lewis Chessmen may be
next!

DEREK YOUNG of Strathclyde University Law School (is the address meant
to add clout to his piffle?) is probably correct in asserting that his
views are more in tune than John Macleod's with school life in the
matter of sexual mores (July 13). Being more specific, I would put his
views around Primary 5 or 6.
Like most of his ilk, young lawman Young defines his own value
judgments, shows how little immature humans subscribe to them, and bows
to the jury. Voila!
Where would people like me fit in his philosophy, not to mention the
hundreds of others I know? We can easily be picked out -- we're the ones
still married after 10 or 60 years with, generally speaking, good
families.
The ones who are like that now because they followed a different
teacher, just as wee John Macleod suggests we do; the ones who
considered it a debasement of all trust and consideration to the
girl/boy you were to marry to ''try'' anyone other than the chosen
spouse.
Maybe the answer lies in the longevity of such couplings. The people
of whom I speak made marriage vows and kept to them. Mr Young's world is
probably populated by the more modern liaisons -- ie, once the magic
goes let's all swop. And to hell with the kids!
There does seem to be a deep-seated inadequacy in the Youngs of this
world. They seem to be quite unable to grow up past the frilly knickers
stage.
Derek Young should go and talk to a middle-aged happily married couple
and ask them their priorities for a lasting, happy home.
Perhaps not. Why shatter his illusions?

THE article by Derek Douglas on Rorke's Drift (July 15) provided not
only a timely reminder of an exceptional day in British military
history, but an insight into the activities of an off-duty rugby
reporter.
Distance occasionally breeds disenchantment, particularly in time, yet
the story of the defence of this mission station never fails to stir
one's admiration. The officer in charge, Lt Rouse Merriott Chard, RE,
had 139 men to repel the Zulu forces, estimated in his own report at
3000 strong.
This account also puts the duration of the fighting from 4.20pm on
January 22, 1879, to 4am on the 23rd, and Chard is very complimentary
about the behaviour of several of his small band, especially Lt Gonville
S Bromhead.
The after-effects of this memorable day for the 11 heroes, winners of
the VC, were varied. After both officers returned to Britain they were
promoted to brevet major and invited to Balmoral to meet Queen Victoria.
Chard attended and was given a gold signet-ring. Bromhead had gone on
a fishing trip and did not receive his invitation until the date had
passed. He tendered his apologies at once but was never invited again.
The incident had thrust a few men from obscurity into the public eye
but they were equally quickly forgotten. Fred Hitch, his shoulder
shattered, left the Army and finished his days as a London cabman. Henry
Hook became a guard at the British Museum.
Corporal Frederick Schiess of the Native Natal Contingent, badly
wounded during the battle, was destitute and ill by 1884. He was offered
passage on a troopship to England with the cost of his rations raised by
public subscription but did not survive the voyage and was buried at
sea.
Chard continued his commission, serving in Cyprus, India, and
Singapore. He was promoted once more but then developed cancer of the
tongue and retired from the service in August, 1897. Three months later
he died at Taunton, Somerset, aged 50.
Bromhead's fame overcame his increasing problem of deafness and he was
allowed to soldier on, although never receiving further promotion. He
died at Allahabad in February, 1891, at the age of 46.

EVERY silver lining has a cloud. New Zealand is a cornucopia of good
things -- beautiful scenery, friendly people, economic wealth -- but
unfortunately has its own form of that perverse philosophy, political
perverseness or political correctness. Here in New Zealand it is
emphemistically known as Cultural Safety.
It is to be hoped that all forms of this perversity will eventually
suffer the same fate as affirmative legislation in the USA. Its nemesis
there followed the success of the Republicans in the US Senate and House
of Representatives.
In New Zealand it has been highlighted in the nursing profession where
a large percentage of time is given to the ethos of Maori history to the
detriment of professional competence.
One nurse, complaining of the amount of time given over to politically
correct policies, encapsulated the whole problem by stating she could
quote authoritatively on Maori Creation Myths, chapter and verse on the
Waitangi Treaty between Maori and the Pakeha (whites), could hold a
discourse on how the Sealord Deal affects Maori health but with one or
two other skills such as obstetrics, gynaecology, etc, she was
struggling.
Knowledge of history counts for so much more than competence in
medicine when it comes to promotion -- or even holding on to one's job.
It is a travesty that is now being given an airing and hopefully its
ramifications and the zealots who are prosyletising it will be nipped in
the bud.

THE Greenbury Committee's proposals on executive remuneration will
seem broadly acceptable to those who feel that a code of best practice
and tighter Stock Exchange regulation will be enough to end what has
been rightly perceived as a scandal in the wake of the privatisation of
the public utilities. Others, and they include the Labour Party, will
not trust businessmen to behave responsibly in this area and want more
formal permanent regulatory bodies, in this case a standing advisory
committee composed of representatives of shareholders, consumers, and
employees. Its findings would have to be accepted, with Stock Exchange
rules being amended to enforce compliance. Labour would also prevent
public utilities including options in remuneration packages altogether.
The first view has the support of the Government, and the Chancellor has
moved at once to make options liable to income tax (and not just capital
gains tax), as the committee recommended, a change which will increase
the ''take'' of the Treasury from such awards.
Those who like the idea of blue water between the two main parties
will certainly find some here, though there could be time enough between
now and the next General Election for Labour to change its mind if the
Greenbury proposals are seen to be working. Greenbury wants total
transparency, greater responsibility and accountability in matters of
executive pay, but is firm in rejecting legislation to that end. The
committee's members believe that ''industrialists, by and large, are
reasonable, sensible, and responsible people''. It is an opinion that
will be widely shared: the privatised utilities, which have led the way,
particularly to option excess, in the behaviour which made Greenbury's
establishment necessary, are hardly typical of British industry. That
was one reason for their behaviour being so strikingly novel as well as
distasteful. That the damage done is wider than many may think can be
gauged by the opinion of one City house that acceptance of the Greenbury
recommendations may actually encourage overseas investors to buy British
equities as the image of corporate sleaze is dispelled.
Generally, top people's pay in Britain is not out of line with levels
prevailing internationally. Indeed in a league of such matters the
position is more modest than outrageous. The option rewards in
utilities, by definition low-risk businesses, were outrageous and made
more dramatically so by the way in which both the water and electricity
companies were, in most cases, originally offered too cheaply. (A
failure of Government and its highly rewarded City advisers,
incidentally.) Their soaring share prices made the options into a
facsimile of Monopoly money, except that it was real. The huge salary
increases, which came as well, simply made everything worse.
Unfortunately, clipping the claws of the fat cats who led this race in
the utilities will affect all executives in every business sector, far
down the ladder to middle management whose enjoyment of such benefits
was far more modest and far more defensible. Labour's notion of banning
options for utility executives seems reasonable, given the nature of the
underlying businesses originally involved, but perhaps less so where
diversification is markedly changing the profile of individual
companies.
It seems this matter will remain a political issue until, and during,
the next election. It has seriously damaged the image of privatisation
and contributed to widespread doubt about its further attractions, in
the Post Office and railways, for example. It has damaged the
Government, which took far too long to react to the public outrage
stimulated by a succession of financial excesses at the expense of
consumers of near-monopoly services. It has damaged business life, and
its reputation for ethical behaviour, generally. Greenbury readjusts the
balance, but late in the day.

I'M ALL EARS, said Michael Forsyth on his appointment as Secretary of
State for Scotland earlier this month. Naturally he wants to improve the
Tories' dismal standing in Scotland and to that end he has promised to
embark on a listening exercise which will involve him hearing about the
hopes and concerns of many Scots. Indeed, he has written to those who
represent all Scottish walks of life -- including teachers' officials --
proposing one-to-one, private meetings. Now teachers' representatives
might have a wry smile on their faces and thoughts of fingers, thumbs,
and salt on the mind when they read about Mr Forsyth's plans. Dialogue
with the teachers' representatives was not a noticeable feature during
his two spells as Education Minister. But compromise, not confrontation,
is the name of the game now. And he is right when he says that it is
grossly unfair to harp on about the past. We must move forward.
Moving forward, at pace, is what we are doing with the Government's
Higher Still reform of upper secondary schooling. Ministers and Scottish
Office officials have argued that the reform must be implemented as
quickly as possible to give fifth and sixth-year pupils the benefits of
a curriculum which is realistic and meaningful, taking account of all
their needs. The Government has opted for a model which builds on the
present system and will result, it hopes, in thousands of extra Higher
awards a year, at better grades. That will be quite an achievement,
bearing in mind that, currently, about 18,000 pupils fail the Higher
each year and only about 8% of fifth-year pupils gain five or more
Highers. Patently the present system is not working. It also represents
poor value for money. But it is worth recalling that it was dedicated to
those who were going on to higher education. That used to be the ''top''
25%. Now nearly 80% of 16-year-olds are staying on beyond compulsory
schooling. Under Higher Still, young people will be offered courses and
units, or short courses, which will provide a bridge to the Higher in
sixth year while giving the option of leaving at the end of fifth year
with qualifications leading to further education, jobs, or training.
There is also provision for the most able.
Higher Still does not have all the answers but it deserves a chance.
Ministers and officials will, however, compromise its chances of success
if they ignore the growing chorus of concern about the deadline for
introduction. It is time to act, particularly now that the Government's
own advisers are reporting that there is so much work involved in
writing new courses and units that the 1997 date for implementation is
unworkable. Insiders have given the timescale the thumbs down and,
unless the Government announces a postponement of at least a year, the
teachers' unions will walk away from Higher Still, concluding quite
rightly that the development will mean more work when they are
campaigning to reduce workload. That is in no-one's interests --
remember this is about providing opportunity for all young people -- and
could herald a return to the type of industrial action which bedevilled
our schools in the mid-1980s. Something on the scale of Higher Still
demands a high degree of consensus. Aside from the educational
arguments, Mr Forsyth knows that there is so much to be gained
politically by acting in a way which is in keeping with professional
advice. By announcing a postponement he has the opportunity to show that
he is serious about listening; to secure the confidence of the teaching
profession; and to avert potential disaster. Over to you, Michael.

WE hear, with some distress, of the selling of the Good Book as if it
were some sort of time share.
Ministers throughout the land have been receiving a communication from
World Bible Publishers, a company in Iowa Falls, Iowa, USA. Included is
a voucher which ''may be redeemed'' for a free copy of God's Word, a
modern American translation of the Bible.
The book is described thus by Mr Skip Knapp, president of World Bible
Publishers: ''God's Word is a completely new type of English Bible
translation which concentrates on translating the actual meaning of the
Bible accurately and literally from its original languages of Hebrew,
Aramaic, and Greek into their closest natural equivalent meaning in
North American English as it is actually written and spoken today.''
This US-speak edition will presumably come in awfy handy for the
Orkney minister who has passed on to the Diary the voucher for his free
copy.
Pastors, and indeed ministers, are invited along to the Chapter House
religious bookshop in Bothwell Street, Glasgow, to watch a video about
this new Yankee Bible where ''well-trained staff will be glad to spend
some time with you discussing this exciting new translation . . . Then
head home and take a few minutes to review your favourite verses . . .
''
Because of possible delays in the US mail from Iowa the ''redemption
period'' for the Bible certificates has been extended until August 31.
Flash point
WE hear that the Arlington Baths, a private dooking establishment in
the Woodlands area of Glasgow, has made a giant leap forward in sex
equality by making the premises mixed instead of all-male on a Friday.
Some of the older chaps are incensed by this and have chosen to rebel
by behaving as if nothing had changed and pretending that the girlies
are not in fact there. Thus the women have been exposed to full frontal
views of some of the older members as they wander around the premises.
The reaction has been mixed. Some of the women have been upset. Others
have merely been amused. Yet others are planning to be amused and point
at the same time.
Welcome party
DEPT of It's a Dirty Job But Someone Has to Do It: Members of the
Scottish rugby squad, newly returned from the rigours of all that sun
and safari in South Africa, have been pressed into service at the Open
at St Andrews this week.
The team sponsors, Famous Grouse whisky, have asked players to be on
hand to greet the public at their 19th hole tent -- actually to be found
near the 16th hole -- where smoked salmon, Aberdeen Angus beef, and
quantities of the low flyer liquid are available.
Wee monster
THE Coalite company is offering 24 prizes of a cuddly toy to young
readers of their Club News magazine. The toy, in the shape of a dragon,
which the weans will presumably give pride of place in their bedrooms,
has been called Burnie.
The Name Game
APROPOS of not a lot we thought we would tell you that the
Westmoreland Gazette of Cumbria runs a Spot the Dog competition based on
snaps from sheepdog trials. One of the outlets where readers may leave
their entries is a newsagent called D&amp;H Woof.
Auld Alliance
winners
AND so farewell to M Jean-Claude Richard, the French consul in
Scotland who said cheerio to these parts last Friday. But not before
helping to draw the winners of the fabulous prizes which he had
organised for the Diary's Auld Alliance competition.
After four years in Scotland, Jean-Claude has been ''promoted'' and is
off to be amabassador in Uzbekistan. This may or may not be down to the
fact that he arranged for the Lothian and Border polis pipe band to pop
over to the Parc des Princes in Paris earlier this year to inspire the
Scottish rugby team to victory.
Jean-Claude was such a popular chap in Scotland that, on the day of
his departure last week, three Scots chained themselves to the railings
outside the consulate in Edinburgh to protest against his posting. (Or
they may have been Greenpeace folk upset about France's plan to resume
nuclear testing in the South Pacific.)
J-C was helped in selecting the winners by his daughter Fleur, a
charming child of 10 years who showed great aplomb by singing Flower of
Scotland to the guests at her old man's farewell Bastille Day party.
This wee French fleur of Scotland admitted a certain tristesse at having
to leave all her wee chums from Mary Erskine school and heading off to
Tashkent. The following are the results of her abilities as a raffleuse:
Air France return flights to Paris: Jean Neilan, Boyleston Road,
Barrhead. A day on an Elf North Sea oil platform: Sheena Reid, Woodrow
Road, Pollokshields, Glasgow. A night at Sir Fitzroy Maclean's Creggans
Inn in Strachur: John Quinn, Lenzie. A case of Vielle Alliance wine from

Edinburgh: Alastair Breckenridge, Darley Crescent, Troon. Gateaux from
Patisserie Francoise, Edinburgh: David Hamilton, John Street,

NEVILLE RIGBY explains why composer David Ward's music resonates with
elemental force
IT CAN be difficult to hear yourself think on the island of Yell.
During five long and gloomy winter months, hurricanes scream across the
peat wastes (locals dismiss the island as ''just a big growbag
surrounded by water'') and the 1000 or so residents who scratch out
their living there tell of the relief in spring, when the winds subside
to the level of mere gales which rattle the chimneys of the scattered
crofts on Shetland's middle island all the year round.
Hard, then, to imagine a composer finding the tranquillity that surely
must be necessary to allow musical inspiration to flourish. However,
David Ward's music contains traces of the shrieks and moans of the
prevailing sou'westerlies.
He is Scotland's most northerly composer, a distinction which slipped
out of the grasp of Peter Maxwell-Davies in the Orkneys, when Ward, 54,
with an impressive record of compositions under his belt, uprooted
himself from the south of England to settle at Sellafirth with his New
Zealander wife, Chrissie, nearly 10 years ago.
They married after a chance meeting at the opera in Covent Garden and
headed almost as far north as they could go -- attracted by the kind of
property prices which would have scarcely bought a garden hut in London.
She set to with the enthusiasm of a novice who no-one had told it could
not be done, and turned her hand to small-scale market gardening with
the benefit of tunnel cloches. Her success brought a selection of fresh
vegetables and lent more than a grain of truth to the growbag jibe.
Between digging for survival and handling the business side of the
composer's life, Chrissie, 46, has written her first novel -- a romance
set around Inverness -- and is about to discover the world of computers
and new technology in a telecroft down the road in the little fishing
village of Cullivoe.
Ward still rolls up his sleeves to push the boat out to catch fish for
supper, while devoting himself full-time to composing. After steeping
himself in local folklore, he produced an ambitious cantata, to a text
by Alan Jamieson, which recalled the Gloup disaster of 1881. Beyond the
Far Haaf focused on the tragedy which claimed the lives of 58 fishermen.
Completed in 1989, the work received its premiere in Lerwick three years
ago, conducted by Jerzy Maksymiuk and the BBC SSO with the mezzo-soprano
Margaret Cable and baritone Graham Titus.
More recently it seemed he was doomed to miss the first performance of
his fourth string quartet because of the expense of travelling from Yell
to London. Sympathisers and sponsors nudged by his old friend Stephanie
Wolfe-Murray, the Edinburgh publisher, rallied round to pay the #600
fare for Ward and his wife to attend the premiere of his fourth string
quartet, the second commissioned by the London-based Bingham String
Quartet.
It would be tempting to try to bracket Ward as a good-lifer seeking to
escape. But that would be far from the truth. Ward, an exuberant
character, says he headed for the fastness of Yell purely for economic
reasons, although he admits to having ''got fed up with the London music
scene''.
He played trombone as a session musician in the 60s, and turned his
hand to musical arrangements for several pop groups and singers whom he
coyly refuses to identify. ''Like many people I've had my stint of
commercial music, arranging pop tunes. I did quite a lot of work in the
pop world. They would sing and play them, I would write them down for
them because they often didn't know anything about music,'' he recalls.
An old friend from those days, Richard Stilgoe, the satirical
entertainer, was responsible for commissioning his first string quartet.
But Ward had already received recognition for a trio of chamber operas
broadcast on Radio 3 and for cello works written for the cellist Ross
Pople, another New Zealander, and the London Festival Orchestra.
Like his music, Ward defies easy categorisation. He has no television
and keeps up to date on musical developments through Radio 3. He comes
from a military family background and was described by one music critic
as having an ''English-gentlemanly'' demeanour. His conversation is
earnest and determined, whereas his music can be whimsical and witty.
His emotional evocation of the storm in Beyond the Far Haaf suggests
much greater depths.
Currently he is working on a piece for Japanese clarinettist Shinobu
Miki and the Saltire String Quartet, due to be premiered at the Sealoft
Arts Centre in Fife in July, and a work for the BBC SSO's lead trumpet
player Nigel Boddice due to be performed with the Swedish Yggdrasil
quartet resident in Aberdeen.
The move to Yell provided Ward with the opportunity to devote a much
longer timespan to the development of some of his more significant
works. He completed his first full-length opera seven years ago. Jack's
Engagement, a three-act comic opera with a libretto by poet Kevin
Ireland, which Ward describes as a ''comment on materialism'', has yet
to receive a complete two-hour performance, although an orchestral
excerpt from the work has again been played by the BBC's SSO.
The finishing touches have just been given to Ward's second
full-length opera, Timone, which he conceived in 1990. Writing both the
libretto and the music, he has transformed Shakespeare's Timon into a
late 20th century allegory of greed. Timone, a rich businesswoman
surrounded by spongers and hangers on, loses her fortune, regains it,
and wreaks revenge on the villain in a stock market crash which she has
orchestrated.
Another comment on materialism. Perhaps from the simplicity of life on
Yell, David Ward is trying to tell us something.

BUSINESSMAN John Slattery has become Scotland's biggest lottery
millionaire with a #2.8m win.
He celebrated further when his 14-year-old twin sons won first and
third places in a boys golf competition at their club in Bathgate, West
Lothian.
Mr Slattery, 43, an Armadale haulage contractor, is a reader of The
Herald. ''I buy it for your excellent golf coverage,'' he said.
His wife Betty, who works part-time in a local bar, and twins Colin
and Stephen, along with brother Liam, 16, were delighted with their win,
said Mr Slattery.
He has yet to decide his future but will take a short holiday with the
family. His numbers were based on family birthdays.
''When my wife and I checked our numbers on Saturday night, I almost
hit the ceiling, jumping up from the settee.
''But I found it the strangest feeling trying to come to terms with
it.
''My wife and I never slept all night, and we went for a walk at 6am
next day to try to relax, although it was impossible.''
After collecting his cheque in Glasgow yesterday, his luck was
compounded when Stephen won a boys' event at his golf club, and Colin
came third.
Two months ago, Linlithgow couple James and Joyce McGurk were
Scotland's first lottery millionaires when they picked up #1.3m. Last
month, James and Audrey Grieve, from the same town, won more than #2m.
Meanwhile, dozens of staff at a North Wales bank were celebrating a
financial coup after becoming the largest syndicate to win a big prize
in the lottery.
A total of 63 staff from the Midland Bank in High Street, Wrexham,
Clwyd, share #492,996, giving each #7825.
Diane Ford, 44, of the bank's lending team, was to have breast cancer
surgery yesterday at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. ''I had been worried
about going into hospital but when we won it was exhilarating and I had
a lovely weekend and went into hospital on a real high,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>Child polio victim has operation after two call-offs</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977338556</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
POLIO victim Daniel Hadlow last night had a vital operation that had
been cancelled twice. Nurses who volunteered to do extra shifts so he
could have the surgery were last night caring for the three-year-old
after it went ahead.
He was taken to the intensive care unit at Southampton General
Hospital after the five-hour operation to straighten his spine and
relieve breathing difficulties. A spokesman said: ''At this stage, the
operation appears to have gone well.''
His parents, who twice within three weeks faced the trauma of
cancellations minutes before their son was due to have the surgery, were
at his bedside.
Accompanied by a vanload of medical equipment, the boy and his
parents, Mark and Louise, had travelled by ferry from their home on the
Isle of Wight to the hospital.
The first operation was cancelled as a hospital porter was wheeling
the youngster, who has to sleep in an iron lung, to the operating
theatre. It was called off because there was a lack of trained staff to
look after him in intensive care.
Surgeon Mr Nicholas Boeree was so concerned that he and his team gave
up their day off to carry out the operation last Saturday but, once
again, it had to be cancelled at the last minute because there was no
room for him in the intensive care unit.
Mr Boeree had to cancel another operation to perform the surgery on
Daniel yesterday afternoon.
Daniel's parents believe he caught polio in a five million to one
chance when he was vaccinated against the virus when he was three months
old.
Mr Boeree said: ''It was a very difficult operation because Daniel is
so young and his spine is so small.
''He will not ever recover fully from polio as it has permanent
effects but I am glad this operation has gone well and, hopefully, it
will improve his breathing.''
Mrs Hadlow said: ''I am absolutely delighted the operation has been a
success.''
Mr Hadlow added: ''I am so relieved that the operation has been
performed and all I want to do now is see my son.''

' There is a real team spirit within the group and the fact that we
are earning a respectable wage is a great incentive '
Course member Janette Shepherd
THE long-term unemployed in Glasgow are being given a stepping stone
back to work by a project offering one year's training and employment in
community health.
Glasgow Works was officially launched last month but has actually been
operating since March. Six women and three men are taking part in the
programme, which centres on Castlemilk and, as well as acquiring
expertise which will help them in the job market, they are using their
skills to help improve the health of their local community.
The project is managed by Castlemilk Economic Development Agency
(CEDA) with the Greater Glasgow Health Board and assisted by Healthy
Cities, a health project also based in Castlemilk. Its main source of
funding is the Glasgow Development Agency (GDA) but it has also received
#20,000 of private sponsorship from Scottish Power.
It is one of 19 projects throughout the city involving more than 250
people and benefiting the community or the environment. GDA's Glasgow
Works project manager Bob Marshall says: ''This pilot programme enjoys
the support of the employment services and the STUC.
''It targets the longer-term unemployed in the city and gives them a
stepping stone back to work through real work, providing economic and
social benefit. It is concentrated on Castlemilk where statistics show
high rates of specific illnesses and deaths among certain groups.''
Mr Marshall also stresses the importance of private sector
involvement. ''We would like more interest from private companies. They
can see for themselves and choose which project they want to sponsor.''
After induction and selection, the nine course members got to grips
with an eight-week lay workers' course designed by Healthy Cities. They
will now spend the next nine months working and training -- three days a
week in a work placement for which they are paid the market rate for the
job, and two days in the classroom, for which they receive a training
allowance. Childcare arrangements are also provided.
As well as a series of classroom lectures and workshops, they will
receive practical instruction in specialist health areas, including
post-natal support, herbal medicine, aromatherapy, Aids counselling and
men's health. At the end of the course members will probably enter the
community health sphere, apply for an educational training course in
health or consider self-employment in health, sport, or fitness.
Additionally, the programme gives members the opportunity for personal
development. Project manager Maggie Gorman explains: ''Course members
can choose to learn something they would not otherwise have had the
opportunity to do, for example, driving lessons or art classes.
''Another major benefit of the programme is that we're taking nine
people who have been unemployed for at least a year and giving them
in-depth training while they work. They go into placements for nine
months in total, each placement lasting approximately three months. This
is to build up practical knowledge and experience of health issues. We
also run seminars at CEDA on a four-weekly basis, picking up on topical
issues and alternative therapies.
''The selection process was rigorous because we had to ensure that the
successful applicant would develop the necessary skills and commitment
to go out into the local community and make an impact on the attitudes
and behaviour of local people towards their health.
''We looked for people who did not necessarily have previous
experience in the field but who wanted to become involved in the
community, perhaps those who had done voluntary work. And we also looked
for adaptability, flexibility and sensitivity.''
Rod Sutherland, general manager at Scottish Power, explains his
company's involvement: ''We offer business expertise as well as
financial help. Glasgow Works is a tremendous initiative, and seems to
be working well even at this early stage. It helps lift people's morale
and self esteem. They feel valued. They genuinely feel they are doing
something worthwhile and we feel the same way.''
Course member Janette Shepherd had been unemployed for 24 years before
joining the course. She sees the project primarily as a way back into
work, but was drawn to it because of the opportunity for personal
development.
''I wanted to do aromatherapy because I am interested particularly in
stress and relaxation. Not only am I getting a job with real work and
training, but I have also regained a great deal of confidence while
doing something that I really enjoy, and which will make a difference to
the health of the people of Castlemilk.
''There is a real team spirit within the group and the fact that we
are earning a respectable wage is a real incentive to do well.''
Two other course members, Kathleen and Angela Morgan, appreciate the
full-time and part-time childcare provided. Kathleen has two children,
aged three and four. ''The childcare makes it possible for me to go out
to work. I would like to qualify as a midwife when I have finished the
course. I think the programme is brilliant. It opens up your mind and
makes you realise what is available. And working with the people of
Castlemilk is great. You understand them if you come from there
yourself.''
Angela also has two children, aged six and 13, so she uses the
after-school creche. She says: ''Childcare was a major problem for me.''
She is interested in stress management, and is keen to join a stress
centre when the course finishes. ''Castlemilk is where I come from so I
feel at home. I am finding the programme very useful,'' she adds.
Both women are currently on placement at Health Castlemilk, a
community welfare project based in Dougrie Drive. Coordinator Joanna
Young, a member of the Glasgow Works steering group, is enthusiastic
about the project.
''It is innovative, and not a ready-made training package,'' she says.
''We are learning as we go along, and it is a complicated process. But
we have a bright approach, and as long as it is done in the right way,
it will be beneficial in the long term.''

MY JOB
The designer
Eric Kennedy meets an artist who proves that good design can be good
business
* JANICE Kirkpatrick regards herself as a ''design evangelist''.
That's not her full-time job, of course, not officially. She is a
designer, and a director of a high-flying design outfit.
She preaches a design gospel. ''It is all about understanding your
environment and culture and being in control,'' she says. ''It is about
analysing situations, environments and objects. It steals bits from
psychology, sociology, and anthropology. It's fun.''
Janice knew that design, and art, were fun when she was a pupil at
Dumfries Academy in the late Seventies. She was good at other things
too. Art was only one of her five Highers when she left in 1980.
In the autumn of that year she went to Glasgow School of Art, spending
the first year in the usual multi-disciplinary and wide-ranging studies
of free art and design.
Art school, she discovered, was like a mini-state, quite mad, with its
own rules and regulations and a terrific sense of community. She lived
in the halls of residence at first, and later moved into a flat with
friends.
She still had no preconceived notions about how to put into practice
what her Dumfries art teacher had identified as a talent. For her second
and subsequent years at art school, however, she opted to go into the
graphic design department as it had the widest range of facilities for
working across the disciplines.
She studied film, film animation, video and some typography. It was,
she says, a wonderful course, imparting the ability to understand the
world and cultures around her.
She graduated BA Hons in 1984 and went on to a post-graduate MA in
Design. She graduated at Christmas 1985, but meanwhile she had become
involved in Graven Images.
She, architect Ross Hunter, and another partner who left soon after,
set up the company, and she and Ross are now directors of a concern
which employs 11 other designers and architects.
Based in its own offices in Glasgow's Merchant City, it operates
across a variety of design disciplines -- graphic design, interior
design, architecture and newspaper design.
This multi-disciplinary approach means the company can undertake quite
complex projects, and it was closely associated with the successful
campaign to have Glasgow declared 1999 Year of Architecture and Design.
Much of Janice's time these days is spent writing: strategic
documents, a monthly column in Design Week, and material for other
publications all make their different demands. She also lectures,
tutors, and broadcasts.
Her first love, of course, is design. ''You have to be good at it to
succeed,'' she says, ''and you have to work at it. There's no point
lying in your bath and awaiting inspiration.
''And yes, I do think it is a worthwhile career. Good design enhances
everyone's lives, even when they don't realise it themselves.''

Lofty entrepreneurial aspirations are gaining support from a new
initiative, as Geraldine Abrahams reports
ONE of the few positive things to come out of the rising unemployment
of the past few years has been the growth in small forward-thinking
companies. While they may not employ the large numbers of workers as did
the giants of the heavy engineering-based industries in the past, they
represent the enterprise of the present and the future.
It is vital that such innovation is nurtured, and in Scotland there
are various schemes, local and national, which are designed to support
small businesses and ultimately create jobs.
One such support is the East Kilbride Entrepreneurship Fund which was
launched in April this year, sponsored by the Clydesdale Bank, and will
run at least until the beginning of the next financial year and possibly
beyond. It is open to companies operating at East Kilbride as well as
those relocating there.
European funding support has been secured for this project in the form
of an ERDF grant which recognises the innovative nature of the scheme.
Colin Robb, chairman of the Development Committee explained how the Fund
came about.
''We felt that there was a gap between the big providers of venture
capital and the immediate requirements of a newly emerging company, and
questioned whether there needs to be a certain point in a company's
development before it can access larger scale funding'' he said.
''Introducing the East Kilbride Entrepreneurship Fund was a way of
helping newly establishing companies to get on their feet. It is
designed to help with costs such as getting the company incorporated, or
having business plans produced, bringing in accountants to advise on
business plans or initial marketing/market research -- the basic,
small-scale outlay that companies have at the beginning.''
The decision to provide funds is based on an assessment of a company's
cash flow projections and their statement about the market potential. A
finalised business plan is not required.
There are three schemes of assistance available: a Business
Development Grant of up to #1000 and/or a Business Development Loan of
up to #5000, and a Tourist Development Grant of up to #750.
East Kilbride District Council is currently assessing the possibility
of increasing the amounts of money available, to make a more substantial
contribution to the start-up costs of a company. This is the first time
it has been involved in providing direct financial cash assistance to
local businesses.
The launch of the Fund has come hard on the heels of a business
creation programme: the Entrepreneurship Programme, which has been
running for the past three or four years, and this has proved to be a
target market for the Fund.
The intention of the Entrepreneurship Programme has been to generate
new high-growth potential businesses in East Kilbride and Lanarkshire.
Initiated by East Kilbride District Council but run in partnership with
Lanarkshire Development Agency (LDA), the Programme is jointly funded,
and has proved to be a successful way of generating a flow of new
companies who have start-up funding requirements. One company which was
on the Programme until two years ago now employs 800 people.
The other target market for the Entrepreneurship Fund is
recently-established companies which have come through the initial
start-up phase and may require a further injection of funding to help
them go onto the next stage of growth and development. This is
considered to be a critical role for the Fund.
So far, there has been a positive response, with several companies
requesting details and a number attending meetings for advice on making
applications.
One company is Mosaic Software, based at the Software Innovation
Centre at the Scottish Enterprise Technology Park in the town. Mosaic,
which has come through the Entrepreneurship programme, was set up by Ian
Rodger. It has designed and developed a new software product for the
banking and finance industry.
''This is the kind of business we are trying to encourage,'' said
Colin Robb. ''It is innovative, it is developing a new product, a lot of
time has been spent in coming up with this new software package and now
it is being sold and installed and serviced throughout Scotland.''
When Ian Rodger first started, he was effectively acting as an IT
consultant. Since then he has taken on a full-time member of staff and a
trainee and there should be further growth.
''Our first product is being marketed throughout Scotland and we are
now hoping to expand in the South. The Entrepreneurship Fund would help
us expand the scope of the product, making it available not just for PCs
but on Windows and Unix operating systems, which will in turn expand the
size of the market'' he said.
''The three Scottish Banks have been helpful in assisting us in
getting a market foothold.''
Another applicant is Mike Rowan, sometimes known as Big Rory, the
giant Scotsman on stilts. Mike, whose company is known as Stiltz, began
to formulate his idea when he was running stilt workshops in Melbourne,
Australia, and discovered that children loved stilts and were very quick
at picking up the technique of using them. He also found that the
existing products were poorly designed, and has spent the past five
years perfecting his stilts and finding manufacturers and distributors
for them.
With support from Alan Herriott of Endeavour Arts Studio, Leith, he
made and tested 20 prototypes, and took them to the Toy Fair at Olympia.
There Sollihull-based Derek Morris of MV Sports &amp; Leisure, who had seen
Mike as Big Rory in Birmingham, agreed to distribute the stilts. After
further design work, a manufacturer was found in Doncaster.
''I would have loved to have had them made in Scotland'' he said ''but
there was no manufacturer capable of making them here. However, I have
insisted that they say: ''Designed in Scotland and made in the UK''.
Stiltz has already received a #25,000 Regional Enterprise Grant from
the Department of Trade &amp; Industry (DTI), and this has been vital in
progressing the development of the stilts, which are selling
successfully through mail order suppliers Index.

R E Dundas reports on fears that executive share option schemes will
now not be able to deliver their intended benefits and that the new tax
regime will encourage directors and executives to sell their shares
AS is often the case when attempts are made to shut the stable door
after the horse has bolted, the innocent suffer while the guilty escape
without pain.
Sir Richard Greenbury's report on directors' remuneration is a case in
point. Among its recommendations, many of which are admirable, is the
abolition of the present tax concessions for executive share options,
the fruits of which have now to be treated as income rather than capital
gains.
The Inland Revenue was up at the crack of dawn yesterday to change the
rules with immediate effect. The move comes too late to catch those
directors in privatised utilities who have already cashed in their share
options, but leaves tens of thousands of directors and executives of
lesser companies counting the cost.
In fact the huge gains from executive share option schemes in the
water and energy industries arise in the main because the companies were
privatised on such generous terms. Water shares, privatised in 1989,
were sold off at 240p each and now trade at around 600p. The 12 regional
electricity companies in England and Wales, privatised a year later at
the same price, trade at around 770p.
It is doubtful if it would have made a great deal of difference to top
directors in these privatised utilities if the gains they have reaped
from their share options had been taxed as income.
To higher-rate taxpayers the charge is 40% whether it be income or
capital gain. The main difference is that each taxpayer (and his wife)
enjoys an annual exemption limit on the first #6000 of capital gains.
This is a useful concession in respect of modest gains from share
options, but it hardly makes much difference when hundreds of thousands
of pounds are at stake.
At least the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke has left
intact the tax reliefs for all-employee approved savings-related share
option schemes, and for all-employee approved profit-sharing schemes.
Participants in approved executive share option schemes, whose
benefits are often related to performance, have not been so lucky. These
schemes, which often have a life of 10 years, are now placed at a
serious disadvantage, argues Barry Laurie, a tax expert at
Linlithgow-based chartered accountants Primrose McCabe.
He is concerned that existing executive share option schemes will now
not be able to deliver their intended benefits and that the new tax
regime will encourage directors and executives to sell their shares. If
so this would run contrary to another Greenbury recommendation that
long-term shareholdings by directors in their companies be encouraged.
From the point of view of the private investor in a quoted company it
is hardly reassuring if his modest shareholding dwarfs those of board
members.
Mr Laurie, who is a former tax inspector, describes the Inland
Revenue's measures for the taxation of gains from executive share option
schemes as income as ''appalling, absurd, unfair, and retrospective.''
The Inland Revenue press release announcing the changes specifically
states that the exercise, on or after July 17, 1995, of any existing
options obtained under such a scheme, and both the grant and exercise,
on or after that date, of any new options, will be ''within the scope of
the normal income tax charge''.
There are three stages in the process. First the option is granted;
second shares are bought at the stipulated price, resulting in the
option being converted; and third the shares can be sold.
Mr Laurie's big fear is that participants in executive share option
schemes could now have a liability to income tax at all of these stages.
At the first two stages this would result in a demand from the Inland
Revenue without any income or realised gains with which to meet it.
Hence his concern that the new tax regime will encourage the sale of
shares which their owners might otherwise have intended to retain.
Encouraging directors and executives to build up equity stakes in
their companies is an important element in the private enterprise
process. The principle has been extended to employees whose
savings-related share option schemes have escaped the Inland Revenue
clampdown.
Nevertheless share options are just one element in the remuneration
package of salary, pension, car, and other perks offered to executives
and directors.
The Chancellor himself noted that tax relief for executive share
option schemes was introduced in 1984 to increase ''the incentive and
motivation of executives and key personnel by encouraging the linkage of
their rewards to overall company performance''.
He added, ''Since then, the use of options and other forms of
incentive scheme has grown, and, as the Greenbury report indicates,
there is now no case for the tax system to favour one particular form of
incentive over another.''
Kenneth Clarke was under pressure to act quickly in response to the
Greenbury report, but it is far from clear that a level playing field is
now being created. Participants in share option schemes may feel that
the rules have been changed halfway through its life. In that sense the
Inland Revenue changes are retrospective.
Mr Laurie was arguing last night that existing schemes should be given
time to adapt to the new regime. Though this was introduced with
immediate effect, the provision to withdraw the income tax reliefs on
the grant and exercise of approved executive share options will be
included in the 1996 Finance Bill.
This may offer the opportunity for some fine-tuning to prevent the
abuse of a scheme by a few resulting in the many being disadvantaged.
As for future privatisations Greenbury is recommending that no grants
be made under any share option schemes for at least six months, and
preferably a year or more, after flotation. In any event the Government,
whether Conservative or Labour, is unlikely to sell off what is left of
the family silver on the cheap. This should greatly reduce the scope for
huge unearned gains.
Sir Richard admitted as much when he said that the withdrawal of tax
reliefs was ''not the heart of the problem''. Company executives and
directors have every reason to ask why they should be paying the price.

Is it to be the capped interest rate? Or a free property valuation? Or
a new car? Margaret Vaughan describes the battle raging on the mortgage
front
IT used to be a ballpoint pen, and a tastefully boring calendar maybe
at Christmas, or if you were really lucky a plastic piggy bank. Now you
have to fend off sing-song voices on the phone, wade through reams of
unsolicited mail, all manner of seductive offers designed to woo.
Taking out a mortgage has never been so fraught with temptation. Is it
to be the capped interest rate? Or the free property valuation? The
cash-back scheme? Or a straightforward home loan from the building
society you've saved with since pocket money came in big, round, brown
pennies?
Yesterday the race to win your mortgage business accelerated. The
Mortgage Business, owned by the Bank of Scotland, is giving away an
#8000 Renault Clio free for a year to anyone who borrows more than
#45,000. They get to keep the car -- fully insured, serviced, and with
RAC cover for a year -- then they can buy it for trade price, of around
#5000, or give it back and walk away.
It is the latest round in the increasingly fierce battle to win a
bigger slice of the home loan business. And it seems set to excite a
deluge of new eye-catching offers from competitors: ''We're looking at a
whole range of potential new deals and a number of offers are being
discussed,'' sniffed a spokeswoman for a rival banking organisation. You
bet. Suddenly, the prosaic offers of free property valuations if you
switch your home loan, or 4.5% discount for first-time buyers seem,
well, staid by comparison.
''So many companies have got deals to encourage people to borrow from
them that it's becoming a bit of a Dutch auction out there. We either
had to get involved in that, or try and do something a bit different,''
explained a spokesman for The Mortgage Business, part of Bank of
Scotland's finance and leasing specialist NWS Bank.
How will rivals respond? Are we in for a flood of offers of, say, free
timeshare holidays for every mortgage signed? Fitted kitchens? Bus
passes? ''I've never heard of any such offer before,'' said a bemused
spokesman for the British Bankers Association. ''Is there a catch?''
Not at all, insists The Mortgage Business: ''Practically all new loans
would qualify as #45,000 is not a big mortgage in today's terms.''
At the moment, the company's market share is tiddly: TMB has 5000
existing customers. But the offer is also being thrown open to anyone
who remortgages with them from another company.
It is a shrewd marketing ploy, but it will not cost TMB as much as it
might seem. Its parent company owns half of Renault Financial Services
which arranges car loans. It also owns a contract car business, so if
customers decline to keep the car beyond a year, it will go into the
pool.
A spokeswoman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders was stumped to think
of any remotely similar scheme: ''It is extremely competitive out there
between the banks and the building societies and they will do whatsoever
they can to help them get an edge on the competition.''
A whole range of different schemes to woo mortgage custom is on offer,
including cash-back deals, big discounts, free valuations, she said: ''I
guess this is a variation on the theme.''
The main driver of the change has been deregulation of the financial
markets. Once banks and building societies were allowed to compete with
each other, during the 1980s, the race to win your custom speeded up. On
top of that is the flat-as-a-pancake property market.
Increasingly, banks and building societies are poaching from their
rivals rather than seeking new customers in a shrinking market. The
surge in home ownership was built around full employment and tax
privileges. As these factors no longer hold, the financial lenders have
to fight harder for a share of the home loan market.

Julia Langdon meets former Lonrho chief Sir Edward Du Cann, who is
raising storm signals to show that he is still a force to be reckoned
with
ONCE he was chairman of everything. In his new book the index list of
his chairmanships alone runs for more than three inches. There are even
more in the reference books. He ran the Tory Party. He ran Lonrho. He
occupied a powerful position of influence in the establishment, and he
ran rings around everybody else. Was that only four years ago? An
inquiry to Lonrho for his current telephone number is met by the
response: ''Sorry. How do you spell Du Cann?''
When we do meet, it is at a wine bar near Victoria Station, chosen by
Sir Edward. It is a modest establishment, serving excellent claret with
a light salad lunch at an affordable price -- which is to say, by his
previous standards, cheap. Sir Edward Du Cann is on his uppers.
He is broke, bankrupt and, perhaps worst of all, bereaved. His wife,
Jenifer, died earlier this year. He is facing trial next January in an
action brought against him by the Department of Trade and Industry for
being unfit to be a company director. The proceedings are continuing
despite the independent findings of two medical examinations that he
has, at some point in the recent past, suffered a heart attack, his
health is deteriorating, and he is unfit to stand trial.
Never, he says, wearily recounting what he calls his Job's journey of
the past several years, has he been more miserable in life.
Yet he looks better than ever he did at the peak of his twin careers
in business and politics, and at the time of his great influence when he
was a figure of authority in the corridors of Westminster, when what he
said, went. He is 71 and sprightly, weather-beaten from walking the dog
-- alone now -- in the winds of Alderney. That is where he would rather
be than anywhere, certainly rather than on a yacht in the south of
France, where Tiny Rowland would assuredly make him most welcome if he
wanted to go, which he doesn't.
It might have amused Jeni to go for a few days, but now . . . why
bother? Alderney is the island where he and Jeni -- the love of his
life, as he repeatedly says -- spent their four short years of marriage,
happy despite her ongoing battle against cancer, his against
circumstances.
A fortnight in the sun is, anyway, no answer to anything and he does
not seek help from Rowland, or anyone. The navy blue Rolls-Royce went
back when he resigned the chairmanship of Lonrho, Tiny Rowland's
company. That was when he had learned of the Government's plan to act
against him in 1991 for his role as a non-executive director of
something called the Homes Assured Corporation. It was set up in 1988 to
help council tenants buy their homes and collapsed a year later, #10m
adrift. That was when everything went for him, too.
Although two fellow directors have been found guilty of trading while
insolvent, the chairman of the company has not been proceeded against,
nor has the full-time finance director, nor the man who controlled the
company.
''If I am guilty of something than so is every other -- no, most of
the directors of private companies in the United Kingdom, including all
the clubs in the Football League.''
He protests, brightly, that he was brought up never to complain. ''I
hope you don't think the book is a whinge,'' he says at one point. ''I'm
not belly-aching,'' he says later. But that is not what he means, not at
all. He means, in fact, to complain a great deal about the way in which
he is currently being treated. That is why he has written this book.
That is why we are here, eating ham and salad over, of all things ''The
Chairman's Claret''.
''Do you miss . . .'' I start to ask, ''. . . Yes, I do, dreadfully,''
he interrupts before the question is finished. I was going to ask about
Westminster, but it doesn't really matter, because, in truth, he misses
everything.
He thinks he has been singled out as the victim in this affair and the
signs are that he has decided to make a fuss. It looks very much as if,
to use the naval parlance that he would enjoy from his own experience in
the RNVR in the Second World War and as a one-time Admiral of the House
of Commons Yacht Club, he is raising storm signals for the Government's
benefit.
They realise that he knows where a great many bodies are buried. He is
giving notice that he does not plan to be interred himself without
making life uncomfortable indeed for a lot of those who are still
around. ''I wouldn't ask for favours. I would just ask not to be
discriminated against -- which I have been,'' he says.
And the mystery is, the question that needs to be answered, the point
that makes all this interesting: why? Given all that power and position,
given what we know about the way the establishment works, why is it
throwing the book at Sir Edward Du Cann, of all people, he who was
promised a peerage and has been rewarded instead with penury?
He who ran the 1922 Committee; who ran the Public Accounts Committee;
who ran the committee which picked the membership of other committees;
who ran the committee of the chairmen of all the committees; he who was
the big I-Am; who fixed the leadership for Margaret in 1975; who told
her later that she should go gracefully, at a time rather before she
wanted to hear the news?
He has little doubt about this, or purports to have little. He
believes that because of the row about the acquisition of Harrods and
the House of Fraser by Mohammed Al Fayed -- so strongly contested by
Lonrho -- two senior civil servants in the Department of Trade decided
that it would be ''a good idea to discredit me''.
Sir Edward, as chairman of Lonrho, was obviously a principal player in
the ever-increasingly complicated game that surrounded the ownership of
the House of Fraser. He told me, in all seriousness, that it would be a
great relief to everybody in the establishment if he fell over in the
street in Victoria as we left after our claret. He believes that he is
an embarrassment. And this is a man, let us not forget, who knows about
more conspiracies and knows more about conspiracy theories than most of
us could imagine, let alone conjure up in a dream.
He believes that there was a view that if he, Sir Edward
in-all-his-pomp, was not proceeded against there would be a view that
the Government was prepared to let off a prominent Tory, one of their
own, and that once the proceedings had been started, they dare not halt
them. And he feels very sore about it all.
He also thinks -- and this is very important -- that nobody knows how
the Tory Party (or for that matter Lonrho) ought to be run these days.
Everyone shouts their mouth off among today's vulgarians and yet no-one
knows what they are shouting about. Sir Edward Du Cann's message, and it
is only just a murmur at the moment, is that he has got a great deal to
tell and there is a distinct possibility he may soon raise his voice.
They are being warned.

Allan Laing scratches the veneer of Glasgow-born TV executive Steve
Morrison, and finds an Edinburgh University student radical of
yesteryear, with a unique management philosophy
IT WAS the middle of a good week for Steve Morrison, the Glasgow-born
managing director of London Weekend Television. First there was the West
End premiere of Jack And Sarah, the movie which he helped produce
through his much-cherished connection with Granada Films. Then there was
the announcement of soaring half-yearly profits, a sparkling #35.3m, for
the station he runs.
If the dynamic Morrison ever needs inspiration, then all he has to do
is look out of the window. From his South Bank office on the 12th floor
of the London Television Centre he can see miles of metropolis -- the
needlepoint of Canary Wharf, the crumbling dome of St Paul's, the twin
peaks of Tower Bridge. And it is all his. This, and well beyond the
horizon into suburbia, is his domain.
LWT is an enigma. In terms of broadcasting hours, it is one of the
smallest franchises in the ITV network. Friday night to Sunday night.
But in that short window of opportunity it packs the small screen with
some of Britain's most popular programmes, involving TV institutions
like Cilla Black, Michael Barrymore, and Melvyn Bragg. It also boasts a
couple of successful dramas in London's Burning and The Knock.
In Who's Who, Morrison, a disarmingly friendly and tenacious man with
the energy of someone half his age (he is 48), lists among his leisure
interests ''talking''. This becomes abundantly clear when you meet him,
for here is a man who, in the nicest possible way, could talk the hind
legs off a donkey. His enthusiasm for his industry knows no bounds. The
reporter's trusted list of questions is almost surplus to requirement
for, unprompted, Morrison touches all the bases.
He came to LWT last year after the Granada Group (he was managing
director of Granada Television at the time) won its takeover bid to gain
control of the London station. The battle was not entirely painless.
Heads, including that of chief executive Greg Dyke, had to roll in the
old LWT boardroom and there were some redundancies among the workforce
as the two companies rationalised their joint operation. But there was
no spectacular hatchet job. For Morrison, television is not a factory
which churns out programmes from a conveyor belt. It is a family of
creative people, each one related to the next through their desire to
produce good and successful broadcasting. He is, he says, in the
business of doing the impossible.
''Everyone wants to do the impossible, but you have to be in the right
company to make it happen, to turn that desire into the possible. What
you have to do is encourage a broad base of managers who never lose
their affection and their appetite for the creative process. Those
people, who I call the editors of television, have to learn how to run a
creative business. They are the ones who shape the television we make.
''And that, I think, is the lesson I learned from managing Granada,
one of the best TV companies in the country. No matter how hard you
drive a company, you must always encourage the people in it to create --
and create more. You are managing a group of highly-skilled people who
are a mixture of anarchists and entrepreneurs,'' he explains.
Steve Morrison -- he remains Stephen only to his mother -- was born
into a close-knit Jewish family in the South Side of Glasgow. His late
father ran a delicatessen in Sinclair Drive (Steve's brother runs it
now). After Glasgow High School he went to Edinburgh University . . .
and thereby hangs a forgotten tale about this bespectacled,
sober-suited, pillar of the broadcasting establishment. Once upon a time
he was a student activist whose actions made front-page headlines. He
smiles wryly at the distant memory.
Of course, all students were revolting in the 60s; that, after all,
was their job. There was Woodstock. There were the Grosvenor Square
riots. There was fighting in the streets of Paris. And then there was
Malcolm Muggeridge, the rarified Rector of Edinburgh University.
Morrison, who ran the student newspaper at the time, was at the
vanguard of a high-profile campaign to have the contraceptive pill made
available on demand from the university's medical centre. Muggeridge, as
the student's elected representative, was asked to champion the cause.
In a celebrated speech (from the pulpit of an Edinburgh church) he
spectacularly declined and, in a blaze of publicity, resigned from the
rectorship.
In a subsequent election for a new rector, Morrison became the first
student ever to stand for the post. It was a damned close-run contest.
He polled more than 650 votes, but was beaten at the post by the late
Kenneth Allsop, the journalist and broadcaster.
''You know,'' says Morrison, ''I thought everyone had forgotten about
that. You're only the second person ever to interview me about it. The
first was Richard Branson!''
At the time of the controversy, the young Branson was running a
magazine called Student. ''One day this guy in a long, Russian overcoat
arrived at my office in our student newspaper and said he knew I was the
person behind the campaign, and wanted to interview me. It was Branson.
I remind him of it occasionally when we meet.
''The thing about the rectorship was that we were actually doing
something very important at the time. It was the fact that it was about
the Pill which caught press attention but, much more important, was that
we were the first to say 'What is the point of having celebrities as the
students' representatives on the University Court if they don't
represent the views and the concerns of the students?'
''If the students wished a matter to be raised, then their
representative should convey that wish to the court. He didn't have to
agree with it. It seemed to us very reasonable,'' he relates.
Steve Morrison's decision to stand for election helped change
attitudes and paved the way for future student rectors (including Gordon
Brown).
After university -- and a brief spell working with BBC Scotland --
Morrison went on to enroll in the first intake at the newly-created
National Film School. It was during this time that he and some fellow
students started filming the Labour Party in South London as part of a
course project. Some of the party activists then became involved with a
new charity and decided to occupy a huge office block in central London
to draw attention to the plight of the homeless. The charity was called
Shelter. The building was Centrepoint. The story was huge.
Morrison recalls: ''They went into this empty building and locked
themselves inside as a protest. I was with them, with this student film
crew. So I phoned Gus Macdonald, who was with Granada's World In Action
at the time, and said 'We're inside Centrepoint. It's barricaded and
locked up. Do you want our film?'
''Gus said he didn't think so because they had plenty of material for
that week's programme. Then he hung up. Seconds later -- it could only
have been seconds -- the phone rang and it was Gus. 'I'm sorry. Did you
say you're inside the building? That it's barricaded and locked? Well,
of course we want the film!''
Not surprisingly, it was shortly after this that Morrison got his
first day job with Granada. There he was, in the canteen, drinking
coffee and sitting across from Macdonald and another broadcast
journalist who looked like a hippy with long hair and a kaftan. It was
John Birt, a man who has moved onwards and upwards into short hair and
Armani suits.
World In Action, generally recognised in its heyday to have been a
kind of university for investigative TV journalism, was a great
learning-curve for the young Morrison. It set him on a course which led
to a managerial career with Granada, eventually becoming managing
director of the station.
He takes pride in the fact that almost single-handedly he set up
Granada's immensely successful feature film enterprise, which produced
movies like My Left Foot, The Field, and now Jack And Sarah. His
original intention was to enlist the help of film producers like Lord
Attenborough, Sir David Putnam, and Jeremy Thomas. But David Plowright,
at the time chairman of Granada, convinced him to do the job himself. It
was one of the best moves he ever made.
His latest challenge, at LWT, brings him to a city which (in his
anti-metropolitan days in Manchester) was regarded as ''the great car
park in the South''. The merging of the two companies is widely regarded
as one of broadcasting's dream tickets. Granada has its unique
reputation for top-class drama, and London Weekend its keen eye for
popular entertainment.
However, Morrison is intent on expanding and improving LWT. To this
end he has persuaded Sally Head to move from her post as head of drama
at Granada to take up a similar position with LWT. For Ms Head, whose
track record is second to none, having brought programmes like Cracker
and Prime Suspect to our screens, it would appear at first glance to be
a curious career move. You can, after all, get only so much drama into
the weekend schedule.
But Steve Morrison believes that she relishes the challenge of
increasing LWT's drama output. Creative scheduling may be the key. He
points towards the possibility of a pre-News At Ten drama on a Friday
night and the development of a regular 10pm start for a series on a
Sunday night. The recent success of Band of Gold, he says, proves that
viewers like tough, hard-hitting, drama on a Sunday evening.
Again, it is back to his ethos of making possible the impossible. And
it is worth pointing out that, to achieve the impossible, Morrison is
part of a tartan mafia at LWT. His boss, Charles Allen, chief executive
of Granada and LWT, is a Scot. So too are former STV wunderkind Eileen
Gallagher, now managing director of Granada and LWT broadcasting, and
Liam Hamilton, newly-appointed director of broadcasting at LWT. However,
this is all more by accident than design. There is no conspiracy to pack
the hierarchy with Jocks.
The abiding impression of Steve Morrison is that of a family man. It's
just that, unlike the rest of us, he has two. Closest to his heart is
the family he lives with; his wife Gayle and the three daughters upon
whom he dotes -- Katie, 15, Claire, 13, and Sarah, 8. But his other
family is London Weekend Television and it is his task in life to keep
it happy and make it prosper. In a cut-throat industry -- and
broadcasting is as razor-sharp as they come -- it is refreshing to find
someone with a paternal streak.

THIRLESTANE Castle at Lauder in the Borders has become the first
historic house in Scotland registered in a scheme launched by the
Scottish Museums Council.
Yesterday marked the second phase of the scheme, designed to ensure
good management, care of collections, and provision of proper services
for the public at the country's stately homes. More than 1600 museums
already take part in the scheme.
The second phase has been designed to play an increasingly important
role in museum development, said Ms Jane Ryder, director of the council,
who visited Thirlestane along with its new director, Mr Timothy Mason,
to meet castle administrator Peter Jarvis.
A spokeswoman for the council explained: ''The environment in which
museums are operating is undergoing significant change and achieving
consistency of standards is particularly important in the new context.
''The introduction of the National Lottery, re-organisation of local
government, and the re-structuring of area tourist boards all represent
challenges to the museum sector, but the care of collections remains a
priority.''

The verdict comes in on top people's pay. . . Calum Macdonald and Roy
Rogers report.
THE chairman of the committee which reported yesterday on top people's
pay denied they were ''fat cats'' and said their recommendations would
lead to more openness.
Sir Richard Greenbury, who headed the Confederation of British
Industry committee into the controversy over boardroom ''greed'', said
the 52-page report had teeth.
The Marks and Spencer chairman, asked at a news conference whether he
had enjoyed chairing the committee, curtly replied: ''No.''
He was flanked by other members of the committee, including BT
chairman Sir Iain Vallance and Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Whitbread
and Boots.
Sir Richard, walking with the aid of a stick because of an injured
hip, said the committee had stuck within the terms of its reference
despite constant pressure to widen its remit in the wake of fresh
controversy surrounding executives of privatised utilities.
Sir Richard admitted that the 11 members of the committee were all
extremely well paid executives of successful companies.
''But I don't see us as fat cats. Not even the Labour Party has
criticised the salaries of successful company chairmen,'' he said.

I GUESS it can't be much fun being the brother of a famous sister. You
have to put up with answering inane questions from hacks who should know
better about what your relationship is like when you'd really rather not
talk about it.
When, in the case of Sinead O'Connor's brother, Joseph, you're also a
celebrity in your own right, it's also more than faintly galling. His
novels, Cowboys and Indians, Desperadoes, and a recent collection of
essays, The Secret World of an Irish Male, have all been best-sellers,
while Red Roses and Petrol, his first play, which just opened in London
after being feted back home, has him now being compared with Ireland's
greats like O'Casey and Shaw.
O'Connor tries to keep the irritation out of his voice but can't
resist responding to my question with a tight, ''I can't imagine what
anyone could probably find interesting about it. We're not close''. End
of subject.
Actually family dynamics is very much to the point of Red Roses and
Petrol, a wild-eyed comedy set around the funeral of a family patriarch,
Enda Doyle -- an occasion that brings family skeletons tumbling out of
the cupboard and a torrent of score-settling between the New York and
London exiled children and their mother.
But no, says O'Connor firmly and perhaps a touch too disingenuously,
his own family background was not the source for it. He doesn't believe
in writing as therapy. ''Therapy is good for therapy. It probably is
true, everybody has one book or play in them. But what makes you a
writer is a much longer-term thing.''
The duty of a writer, of any kind, he says, is to be a storyteller and
tell a story.
Red Roses and Petrol was commissioned by the Dublin-based company,
Pigsback. O'Connor wrote it quickly, in a month, with the stricture that
he had to keep it to four or five actors and in one room. He doesn't
quite know why he picked on a wake as the central focus -- he'd no
experience of one -- but thought it a likely enough reason why people
might find themselves in such a place over a period of time.
''Who knows where these things come from,'' he says, though he also
admits other forces may also have had a hand. ''It was much easier than
writing a novel or short story -- pure joy from beginning to end. It
seemed to write itself, like a gift from the gods -- maybe everyone's
entitled to one gift. I just seemed to have a sense immediately of all
of these people, and exactly what they would sound like.''
Based now back in Dublin after eight years in London (where he worked
for a year with the Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign), he says it's the
most exciting time to be there -- culturally and politically. ''London
is one of the greatest cities in the world but it just got so tiring.
Things are changing here at such a rapid rate. The decisions that are
going to be made, particularly in the political sphere, are going to
affect the future of our countries for a long time to come.''

Following the tragic death of twin Julia Young, Joe Donnelly examines
a special bond which begins even before birth
ANOTHER young person collapses and dies after taking a cocktail of
drugs. Another tragedy, yet this one will have an effect that few people
will be able to comprehend. This victim, 20-year-old Julia Young is a
twin. Her sister Laura, who sat vigil by her bedside until the end, has
suffered the catastrophic loss of friend, partner, her other half.
She will now have to bear the brunt of life as a single person, bereft
of an equal, a gauge, another proto-self. The loss of a child is
unbearable. The loss of a twin is possibly worse.
They are often mirror images. Two halves of a whole who have shared a
womb and a life since almost the instant of conception.
Born under the same star, they are still rare enough to be remarkable,
though in the past decade their proportion in the population has risen
slightly, partly because of in-vitro fertilisation technology. Twins
occur just about once in 80 births, a double delight, or twice the
trouble depending on the point of view.
That instant family, two bonnie babies side by side in a pram can
elicit sighs and fussy clucking from the blue rinse brigade. For the
mother they can be an exhausting bundle of mixed blessings. Women
expecting twins are more likely to have a tough pregnancy, to need more
medical assistance in delivery, and give birth three weeks earlier than
single baby mothers.
Afterwards, they have a higher risk of post-natal depression, suffer
serious fatigue and stress, and even breastfeeding can fail for of a
number of reasons.
The Twins and Multiple Births Association reports that twins can have
problems of their own. They are often six months behind their classmates
in reading and writing, and are more likely to fight.
They, can suffer problems in development, particularly in speech and
language, and in developing individuality. Boys have more problems in
language development.
When they are separated, the dominant child often becomes insecure
while the other blossoms. If treated exactly alike, they can develop an
over-dependency on one another.
The report also suggests that further conflict can arise in teen years
as twins seek to gain independence not just from parents, but from each
other, with difficulties arising over friends and popularity. Later,
twins who have never been apart can find it difficult to separate when
the time comes to start work or go to college or university, and
relations beyond each other can, they say, cause jealousy or feelings of
rejection.
Had Ronnie and Reggie been merely brothers, they would just be two
hoods from a by-gone day. Folk remember Jack the Hat only because he was
murdered by The Kray Twins. In May, crowds greeted Reggie when he was
allowed out of Maidstone jail for his twin's funeral. On the wreath he
gave, white flowers spelt out the words: ''To the other half of me.''
Twins are often thought of as just that, two parts making a whole. A
tandem. A matching set.
June and Jennifer Gibbons, the so-called Silent Twins were sent to
Broadmoor after a series of offences, but they are remembered mainly for
their bizarre lack of communication with all but each other, developing
a language unique to them and unintelligible to even their own family.
They were locked in a strange and bitterly desperate battle for internal
dominance of their twinship.
Twins make it, often because their rarity helps amplify their deeds,
yet often they themselves think nothing of their status and seem to have
few problems with individuality.
Fiona and Donna Robertson, athletes and judo champions, are often
taken for identical, but they are dizygotic or fraternal twins. But they
are as close as identical sisters often are. They grew up in
Campbeltown, sat together in the same class, took up their sport with
equal proficiency, always alternating first and second in the medals.
Now they share a flat together, train together, and are still the best
of friends.
''I have short hair while Donna's is long,'' Fiona says, ''but that's
quite unusual. Normally we look very alike and we tend to dress alike.
We seem to have the same tastes in just about everything.''
Now 26, the Robertson sisters, have experienced pressure from other
people to look and dress differently.
''But we see no point if our tastes are so similar. We are always
together and when we are apart, we always say 'we' rather than 'I'. We
are best friends, a perfect team. We own a flat together, work in the
same place and train together. We never fight. If we argue, it's over in
a minute.
''In Judo, when we are asked to pick a partner of the same height and
weight, then obviously I pick Donna. There is nobody more suitably
matched, either physically or in experience. That's perfect for our
athletic training too.
''It's strange. People see us as being very like each other, but I
never think about it really. Yet, a few times in some clothes shops, I
have seen my distant reflection in a mirror and called out to Donna.''
Peter and John Douglas, from Dumbarton, have been described as the
ultimate movie double feature. They're identical brothers who are joint
chief technicians at the Odeon Cinema in Glasgow's Renfield Street.
John said: ''A lot of people worry about identity, but we have never
had that problem. We have always had the same interests and it seems we
are identical in all respects. We even have the same taste in girls, and
I suppose that's why we never married. We always fancied the same one,
and that wouldn't do.
''If there are problems with being twins, they're difficult to
comprehend, because we have never known the other side of the coin. We
just don't know what it's like not to have a twin. This seems very
natural to us, and we can't imagine what it's like on the other side of
the fence.
''We never experienced problems at school. Both of us did reasonably
well, despite our pretty bad eyesight which was a disadvantage in
education, but not unique to twins. We went through in the same classes.
We wouldn't have liked to be split up.''
Another identical pair, Alan and James Johnstone were born in the same
year as Reggie and Ron Kray. The lives of both sets of twins could
hardly have been different. Last week, the dairy farming brothers were
in Buckingham Palace to receive identical honours, the MBE. A life of
crime is a foreign concept to them. Instead they have lived a life of
honest toil, working for 46 years on a hill farm in Wigtownshire with
nary a Christmas or New Year off. They have worked together all their
lives, captained the golf club, were club champions, and county champs
at badminton.
''If Alan did something, I always tried hard to accomplish it just as
well,'' James said.
''We are just like brothers and we've never had a problem with being
identical. Other people see us as twins, but we see us and each other as
individuals. We have our own views on things, and often differ. But we
are close. We live on the same farm and because we will be retiring
soon, we are building detached houses on the farm land.
''Problems? I can't think of any. We're friends and we're brothers.
What could be the problem there?''
Photographic student Belinda Arthur from Renfrew knows that being a
twin marks one out as different. Last week she graduated BA Hons in
Photography from Napier College. Her degree show, not unexpectedly,
included a series of photographs of twins.
''We weren't identical. My sister Wendy was thin and I was fat. We had
to put up with jibes about Laurel and Hardy. We were close, but
sometimes we resented always being called the twins instead of being
treated as individuals. We sort of came as a package.
''I think people were jealous of the fact that there were two of us
and sometimes we were ridiculed, but all in all, I'm glad I have a twin
sister. We are both arty and Wendy is a student at Art school. We've
gone our separate ways in education for the past four years, but we're
still very close. I think we always will be.''
TAMBA recognise that when death cuts the special bonds which bind
twins, it can be an insurmountable loss. They have a list of help
publications and even clubs to help bereaved twins in the aftermath.
The loss of a twin is the deletion of another half, another whole, a
constant friend, back-up, support, companion, comforter.
For those of us who have never shared a womb, such a loss is beyond
our scope to comprehend.

MOTHERS who breast feed their babies in early infancy stand a better
chance of seeing them build immunity to various illnesses -- and also
develop a greater intelligence than those fed by the bottle.
The claim is made by Scotland's chief medical officer, Dr Robert
Kendell, in the latest health bulletin on the state of the country's
health, published today. It emphasises that breast feeding should be
encouraged.
Evidence gathered over the years pointed to the fact that there was a
compelling argument for the natural method of infant nutrition, with a
need to persuade at least 90% of mothers to breast feed for at least
four months -- a system which had already been achieved in Scandinavia.
Dr Kendell said the benefits of breast feeding had been summarised in
a report last year by the standing committee on nutrition of the British
Paediatric Association.
A study of 750 mothers and babies in Dundee had shown that breast
feeding for 13 weeks reduced the risk of gastrointestinal and
respiratory illness. The study also provided evidence that the early
avoidance of cows' milk protected children against juvenile diabetes.
Investigations had also shown a low incidence of pre-menopausal breast
cancer in women who had breast fed their children.
Dr Kendell added: ''Potentially the most important advantage conferred
by breast feeding, however, is on brain development.
''It has been demonstrated many times, and as long ago as the 1920s,
that breast-fed children tend to show faster cognitive development and
higher IQ scores than bottle-fed children.''
Admitting that surveys and the interpretation of results remained
controversial, he maintained there were entirely plausible reasons for
breast feeding to be associated with higher intelligence.
Dr Kendell concluded: ''We already have a target of increasing the
population of women breast feeding at six weeks from its present level
of around 30% to 50% by the year 2005.
* Reporting on the needs of physically disabled patients in Glasgow
hospitals, the bulletin stated that current thinking on disability
stressed the need for the disabled person's wishes to have a major
influence on their future assessment.
Recognising that although there were now many alternatives to
hospital, the report conceded that many patients still required
admission to long-term care because of overwhelming clinical needs.

Having a baby can be a nerve-racking experience. JOAN McFADDEN finds
reassurance in a guide that draws on the experiences of other new
parents
THERE is a theory that pregnancy is the most natural thing in the
world, and therefore a simple, straightforward experience. There can be
moments like that, but planning to have a baby and the reality of being
pregnant can feel like totally different things. Practical Parenting:
Pregnancy and Birth strikes a good balance between examining the
emotional upheavals involved and the physical changes throughout the
nine months.
Typical of all pregnancy and birth reference books, this is targeted
more at pregnant women than their partners. Nearly every woman finds
herself obsessed with the subject, especially during a first pregnancy,
while men are more able to distance themselves from the proceedings from
time to time. There are some interesting snippets throughout aimed at
partners, but the book's main strength lies in its ongoing empathy with
the average pregnant woman.
Gill Thorn's professional qualifications apart, it is obvious from her
writing that she is also a parent, which makes this a non-patronising
and personal read. Even considering getting pregnant is momentous enough
for the majority, but she manages to avoid the flowery, emotive language
which is too often characteristic of this type of guide.
Having set a personal tone, she sustains it throughout, drawing on the
experiences of other women. Each chapter is prefaced with a quote from a
real-life experience, while there are a range of useful comments from
women and their partners regarding the situations described. One device
I considered very helpful was the practical list in every chapter,
covering subjects from maternity wear to recognising postnatal
depression symptoms. Photos, charts and illustrations are concise and
easy to understand, and a summing up to each chapter consists of a
question and answer section concentrating on specific areas worrying
many women.
The appeal of reference books is their suitability for dipping into
when particular concerns arise. Pregnancy has a tendency to become a
hobby -- absorbing for those directly involved but in danger of becoming
terminally boring for onlookers. Couple this with those daunting
feelings of ignorance which automatically accompany it, and the calmest
of women start to feel neurotic.
The solution is a comprehensive guide and once you discover one you
like, it becomes a bible. You can spend hours leafing through it, while
managing to retain a normal persona in public, and so keeping all your
friends.
There a number of excellent reference books on the subject and it can
be difficult to recommend one above another. As in Pregnancy and Birth,
the best have clear explanations and sound practical advice, with a
comprehensive appendix and index.
However, this book has the edge on a number of counts. There are some
interesting self-help methods of pain relief recommended, based on
distraction, temperature changes, movement and touch. As the body gets
used to a particular stimulus it loses its power to deflect pain, and
another is applied. There are discussions about the possibilities of
anything going wrong, and some advice for women with disabilities.
Information on antenatal care and the tests and choices available is
very up-to-date, which is extremely important for anyone contemplating
these tests. On a lighter note, the advice on basic clothes and
equipment is kept suitably simple, with no suggestions of four-poster
cots, or babies clad only in designer gear!
This book is exactly what it claims to be, while being an enjoyable
and informative read. Good for first-time parents, it would also be fine
as a refresher course for those taking the plunge again. Gill Thorn is
at her best describing the most common parts of pregnancy, whether they
be as mundane as heartburn or as exciting as feeling the child move for
the first time. I wish I had been able to read something along the lines
of the chapter on The Early Days before my first child was born.
The only part of the book which I have to take issue with is Getting
Back to Normal. If Normal is life as it was before children then the
author has achieved something no other parent has managed to do.

IT'S been a sad time in the household. Fourteen of our 15 pets have
left us for better things. Yes, we liberated the tadpoles, now froglets.
It wasn't so much that we were ready to let them go. We came home one
afternoon and found them out of their Tupperware cake box, lined up on
the edge of the kitchen dresser, contemplating a four-foot leap. The
thought of trading on, or tripping over them cliched it.
We gave a good home to a small part of a huge family, most of whom
were probably destined to be heron food. The herons didn't much miss
them, and our children witnesses one of life's miracles. This particular
one being the survival, against the odds, of pets in our house.
The tadpoles kept by the friends who gave us ours didn't fare quite as
well. It was something to do with them not realising these things need
more to eat than just the pond weed they came with.
What attracted us to these particular tadpoles was their unusual
colouring, mottled oranges and a red sidestripe -- sort of designer
taddies. What we did not know was that they had genes by
Schwartzenegger, not Armani. Soon they were huge -- megatads. The
children gave them names, starting with Arnold.
I, as usual, was blamed. Fancy feeding them on carp food, I was told:
after all, how big do carp grow? The real worries started when, as we
fed them, we could see little eyes hungrily fixed on us. But we
persevered, if only because two or three could have made an emergency
lunch.
And now they have gone, to the pond in the back garden where the blue
tits bath themselves. Pity any poor blue tit that has a go at this lot,
it wouldn't stand a chance. Anything smaller than a full grown
pterodactyl might struggle.
But don't worry, if any of our little friends do perish, they are sure
to go to tadpole heaven. The water they were swimming in comes from a
well that was used to baptise early Christian converts. If it can wash
away the sins of your average sixth century Celt, it'll probably work
for our taddies too.
We fervently hope our one remaining pet, Nightingale the hamster,
doesn't turn out as the tadpoles did. The signs are there, though.
Having started out as a fluffy wee bundle, she's now having difficulty
squeezing up and down the tubes of her hamster-environment cage.
My wife once met her at the threshold of the room her -- Nightingale's
-- cage is in. I'm not sure who was more surprised. On another occasion,
a Sunday morning, our son suddenly let out a howl: ''Nightingale's
escaped''. Sunday mornings are not my best time, and searching for a
lost hamster is not high on my list of preferred activities. We
eventually found her, fast asleep, at the back of a bookshelf. having
shredded a paperback to make a nice comfortable bed.
Obviously, pets are not our strong point. Thoughts of having a dog
have receded, and our son has given up asking for a budgie -- he's
concerned it may turn into an albatross.

<TEXT>
THE private Health Care International hospital at Clydebank looks set
to sign a deal with the Algerian Government over the next three weeks to
treat 250 Algerian heart patients.
The deal could be worth up to #3m, with each operation costing between
#8000 and #12,000, and would provide a much-needed boost for the
hospital which went into receivership last year.
The patients will be selected by doctors and sent in groups of 20 from
Algeria's already overstretched hospitals. Around 3000 heart patients
are dispatched overseas by the Algerian Government every year for
operations, the majority to hospitals in France.
The HCI hospital has 260 beds, 48 of which are now in use, and is
treating 20 patients from Greece, Egypt, Turkey, and Abu Dhabi. Since
the Abu Dhabi Investment Company took over the #180m hospital six months
ago, there has been speculation over its long-term future and its
ability to attract private patients from the UK and abroad.
According to the hospital, the occupancy rate has fluctuated from 60%
to 85%.
Recently, the hospital's development manager, Mr Rick Taylor,
confirmed the creation of around 100 jobs at the hospital and the
expansion of core medical services.

EVERY school, hospital, public library, health centre and citizens'
advice bureau will be linked to an information super highway under a
future Labour government, the party pledged yesterday.
Launching its Communicating Britain's Future document, Shadow National
Heritage Secretary Chris Smith said he wanted the information revolution
to sweep the entire country.
''We do not want a nation of information haves and information
have-nots,'' he told a news conference in London.
Under Labour's plans, the party wants to see facilities where:
* A school pupil anywhere in the country can sit down at a screen and
tap into national museum resources.
* A doctor can carry out a diagnosis on a patient and summon an
immediate second opinion from an expert consultant, possibly several
hundred miles away.
* A supervisor on a building site can to call up the architect, show
them the problem and work out a solution.
* Company executives on either side of the Atlantic are able to work
through a detailed document simultaneously
* The elderly are able to have easier contact with friends, relatives
or carers.

ACTION to curb alleged media intrusion into privacy has been demanded
regularly for years by MPs -- some of whom themselves claim to have been
the victims of Fleet Street ''excesses''.
Mr David Mellor once warned the press it was ''drinking in the
last-chance saloon''. He was himself later to resign as National
Heritage Secretary after reports of an affair with an actress led to a
media siege on him.
Then, early last year during an outbreak of ''sleaze'' stories
involving Tories, Tim Yeo had to resign as a junior Health Minister,
after declaring he would not be hounded out of office by the press over
disclosures that a Tory councillor had borne him a child.
Subsequent disclosures, including pictures of the Princess of Wales
working out in a private gymnasium and the recent claim that entertainer
Tommy Steele had an affair with his flautist, have ensured that the
clamour for new curbs has not subsided.
One of the most controversial cases was that involving Gorden Kaye,
the comedy actor and star of the BBC 'Allo 'Allo series.
Kaye was seriously injured when a piece of wood crashed through his
car windscreen and pierced his brain. It was alleged that Sunday Sport
reporters entered his hospital room and took pictures when he was in no
fit state to give permission.
At the time, Lord Justice Glidewell said that was a graphic
illustration ''of the desirability of Parliament considering whether and
in what circumstances statutory provision can be made to protect the
privacy of individuals''.
ANY pay-offs which might await victims of invasion of privacy will
have to climb a long way before they rival the sums being handed out for
libel damages,  despite the regular criticism that such redress has
always been the preserve of the rich and famous.
Only last month, Graeme Souness was awarded #750,000 following an
acrimonious court action against the People newspaper. However that is
by no means a record. The highest damages for libel given in a British
court went to Lord Aldington,  who was awarded #1.5m against Count
Nikolai Tolstoy in 1989.
In recent years, boat designer John Walker, his family and their
company Walker Wingsail Systems (#1,485,000), Elton John (#1m), and Lord
Archer (#500,000)  all have received substantial cash settlements.

MORE than #23m in rental income was lost by local authorities last
year because of the number of council houses remaining empty, the
Scottish Office has disclosed.
The highest percentage loss was in Edinburgh, where the amount was
#3.5m or 5.4% of rental income. Glasgow lost #7.8m, 3.8% of the district
council's rental income.
Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson expressed concern at the
overall losses, although he accepted that the total amount was reducing.
Mr Robertson said unoccupied properties were ''a wasted resource'' and
it was important that local authorities continued to make every effort
to bring them back into use as soon as possible.
However, such criticism was rejected as ''unjustified and
unacceptable'' by the housing convener of the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities.
Councillor Madge O'Neill, from Glasgow, said many houses were empty
because they were uninhabitable or because councils were waiting for a
sufficiently large number to make up a cost-effective modernisation
programme.
She also pointed to the fact that last year an average of 15% of
properties owned by Government departments had been reported as lying
empty. This compared with council voids running at about 2.1%.

THE Educational Institute of Scotland has demanded a public
explanation of why a lecturer who was unfairly dismissed was paid only
#15,300 when an industrial tribunal ordered her to be given #41,000 and
her job back.
The deal was settled out of court but was the maximum The Robert
Gordon University could have been forced to pay if Mrs Sheena Falconer
had continued to fight her case.
After 27 years of service, Mrs Sheena Falconer, 50, was offered
redundancy or an alternative post as a lecturer which would have meant
putting her sister, also a lecturer, out of work.
Colleagues held a series of one-day strikes in support of her after
she was dismissed.
However, Mrs Falconer was dismissed four months before changes in the
law which now prevents employers from refusing to pay compensation
awards made by tribunals and the university has decided not to pay her
the full award.
She believes she was ''betrayed by the institution she gave her life
to''. She claims they refused her final offer, which was simply to give
her her pension rights, which would have cost the university less that
#15,300.
The Robert Gordon University has said that the settlement was in line
with the amount Mrs Falconer would have been awarded under the now
replaced employment legislation, which was in force when she was
dismissed.
However, Mr Jack Dale, further and higher education secretary for the
EIS, said he was at a loss to understand the position of the university
and, in a letter to Principal Dr David Kennedy, he accuses the
university of misleading statements.
He said their statement asserted they could settle only within the
statutory limits.
''You are aware that there was no statutory restriction on the
university's discretion to pay the #41,000 ordered by the tribunal,'' he
said.
''You are also aware that the university refused to use the power
given to it by statute to calculate Mrs Falconer's original redundancy
payment at the higher level.
''The facts of this case show that the university has been consistent
only in exploiting the legislation to treat Mrs Falconer with the utmost
severity. This I find astonishing. It invites serious questions about
the conduct of the university management.''
Yesterday, the university said its position was ''clear, consistent,
and statutorily correct''. It said a full explanation was being prepared
for distribution to all staff and would be available publicly in due
course.

SNP LEADER Alex Salmond claimed yesterday that the Labour Party could
not be trusted to deliver a Scottish parliament and that its support for
devolution could diminish.
He claimed that the weakness of Labour's commitment to the
constitutional question was clear from the way it would ditch devolution
for the English regions in a document to be released this week.
Labour had killed off its policy for the English regions under
pressure from the Tories, and it was equally capable of doing the same
on its Scottish commitments, he said.
Outlining the SNP's summer campaign, in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond said
that the Labour leadership could not be trusted with any issue which
might be seen as controversial to the electorate of middle England.
Mr Salmond contrasted Labour's position now with its stance in January
when Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown had said that English assemblies
went ''hand in hand'' with a Scottish assembly as a means of resolving
the anomalies of devolution.
He thought the SNP would ''have some sport'' over the summer in
reminding Labour of the commitments it had made.
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, who won the Perth and Kinross by-election,
said SNP policies had been seen as extremist in a UK context but were
regarded as common sense by ordinary voters in the by-election. The
people of Scotland now would be given a chance to consider the SNP's
economic and social policies.

A TEENAGER who fired a starting pistol outside the Prime Minister's
constituency home in Huntingdon was fined #250 yesterday.
Robert Gipters, 19, of Alconbury, near Huntingdon, pleaded guilty to
threatening behaviour.
Huntingdon magistrates' chairman David Godfrey told Gipters: ''You
acted in a most irresponsible, stupid way in this action, having
consumed far too much alcohol.''
However, he added that the magistrates accepted it was ''completely
out of character'' and said the teenager would be fined #250 with #50
costs.
Mr Godfrey said magistrates had also taken into consideration the fact
Gipters last week wrote to Mr John Major, apologising for the incident.
Gipters was arrested outside Mr Major's home in Great Stukeley at
1.30am on June 18 and charged with affray.
The charge was yesterday changed to threatening behaviour after the
Crown Prosecution Service decided Gipters did not intend to harm anyone.
Mr Charles Ingham, prosecuting, told the court: ''This was an act of
extreme folly rather than any attempt on the Prime Minister's life or
his safety.''
Mr John Futter, for Gipters, said the teenager, who was forced to quit
his job in a factory following media interest in his arrest, had drunk
seven pints of lager and two bottles of cider that night.
Upon returning home to his mother and stepfather, a row broke out
about Gipters's drunken state and his plans to leave work and return to
full-time education. Gipters packed his bags, taking the starting
pistol, and left home, intending to set up house on his own.
The court heard how he ''stumbled'' over Mr Major's house and fired
the starting pistol as a car passed by, not knowing the Prime Minister
was one of the passengers.
Mr Futter said: ''My client accepts this was an act of absolute
stupidity at a time when he was drunk. He deeply regrets what
happened.''

AN UNCOMPROMISING stance by new Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell
yesterday angered the NHS unions, several of which are about to ballot
for industrial action over pay.
Mr Dorrell issued an unequivocal message underlining his commitment to
local pay bargaining, which lies at the heart of the NHS dispute.
He said: ''The Government's commitment to local pay is clear and we
shall not be deflected from our course.''
His remarks were a clear challenge to health union Unison, Britain's
biggest union, which last Friday launched a ballot of 350,000 of its
members which could result in the first NHS strike in 13 years.
Unison's head of health Mr Bob Abberley said NHS trust employees would
be ''extremely disappointed'' by Mr Dorrell's statement.
Mr Abberley has said he is confident members will vote to strike and
agree to a follow-up programme of limited action.

THE key points of the Greenbury report are:
* Government recommended to abolish tax concessions for executive
share options.
* Privatised water and energy companies to review existing pay
packages, adjust them ''on voluntary basis as necessary'', and give full
report for discussion by shareholders at next annual meeting.

discount awards to be stopped.
* Compensation for loss of office to be reduced through shorter notice
periods in contracts. Anything over a year to be justified to
shareholders.
* ''Robust'' line to be taken on compensation when performance has
been unsatisfactory.
* Companies to consider phasing compensation, and stopping it when
individual is re-employed.
* Extra accountability of shareholders for directors' remuneration
through ''full disclosure'' and a new code of best practice.
* Stock Exchange asked to compel listed companies to make full
disclosure and annual statement to shareholders about compliance with
the code.
* Remuneration committees, made up solely of non-executive directors,
to determine salary packages of individual executive directors.
* Annual report to shareholders by remuneration committees should
include full explanation of pay policy, and explicit details of package
of each director, including pension entitlements earned during the year.
Report to form a separate section or annexe of company's annual report
and accounts.
* Chairman of remuneration committee to attend company annual meeting
to answer questions.
* Remuneration committees to consider whether there are ''special
circumstances'' requiring approval at the annual meeting for pay policy.
* Directors encouraged to have long-term shareholdings in their
companies.

<TEXT>
THE Government yesterday turned its back on calls to make media
intrusion into private life a criminal offence.
National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley instead outraged Tory
back benchers in the Commons by outlining plans to strengthen the
voluntary self-regulation of the media.
Unveiling the long-awaited Government response to a series of reports
on breaches of privacy, she recommended that a new fund be set up by the
industry to compensate victims of media intrusion.
The Government also ruled out a statutory body to regulate the media
and the creation of a new civil law to protect privacy of the
individual.
The Government response followed two inquiries by Sir David Calcutt,
QC, and an investigation by the National Heritage select committee which
all called for a tough crackdown on breaches of privacy.
However, the detailed response issued by the Government accepted that
the press had moved to put its own house in order -- even if more work
was needed.
These are the key findings.
Statutory Complaints Tribunal or Ombudsman: ''A free press is vital to
a free country. Many would think the imposition of statutory controls on
newspapers invidious because it might open the way for regulating
content, thereby laying the Government open to charges of press
censorship.
''The Government does not believe it would be right in this field to
delegate decisions about when a statutory remedy should be granted to a
regulator such as a tribunal.
''For both reasons, the Government does not find the case for
statutory measures in this area compelling. It believes that, in
principle, industry self-regulation is much to be preferred.''
Self-Regulation and Code of Practice: The Government welcomed the
increase in the lay element of the Press Complaints Commission and
called for the principle to be extended to the committee in charge of
the industry code of practice.
It called for a new ''press hotline'' to allow the PCC or the
independent privacy commissioner to warn editors thought likely to
publish a story or picture in breach of the code of the consequences of
doing so.
The paper said: ''The Government wishes to see compensation paid to
those whose privacy has been unjustifiably breached by the press, from a
fund set up by the industry.''
The code should contain a clearer definition of privacy, clearer
language to ensure journalists did not remain on property after being
asked to leave and a tougher requirement that journalists should not
intrude into shock or grief ''unless it is with consent or in the public
interest''.
Criminal Offences: The Government accepted in principle the case for
making press intrusion, for example through bugging or long-lens
cameras, a criminal offence.
However, the paper added: ''The Government has, however, so far been
unable to construct legislation which, in practice, would be
sufficiently workable to be responsibly brought to the statute book. It
therefore has no immediate plans to legislate in this area.''
The decisive factor was the difficulty in limiting the scope of the
offences to ensure that:
* Those concerned knew whether their actions would be in breach of the
law.
* Journalists were not inhibited from investigations in the public
interest.
Civil Law and Infringement of Privacy: The Government decided against
a new civil offence of infringement of privacy following a wide
consultation. The proposal would have given a civil remedy to people who
suffered ''substantial distress'' from a breach of privacy.
Responses from the consultation varied widely and Ministers said they
did not believe there was public support for such a substantial change
in the civil law.
The Government believed that although shortcomings in self-regulation
had been clearly evident, there was a ''serious desire on the part of
the press to make improvements'' and was keen to encourage that.
THE chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, Lord Wakeham,
welcomed the plans to toughen self-regulation of the press.
He said: ''The Government has acknowledged many of the important
strides the press has made in making self-regulation work since the PCC
was established in 1991.
''The Secretary of State rightly states, however, that there is more
to be done -- and her thoughts on the way forward will be an important
focus of debate in the coming months.''
The Newspaper Society, which represents Britain's regional and local
press, also welcomed the proposals.
Society director David Newell said: ''The PCC and the industry can now
get on with the job of making self-regulation work, without the threat
of control by a Government agency.''
The National Union of Journalists dismissed the plans as
''preposterous'' and said it was ''self-regulation gone mad''.
NUJ deputy general secretary Jake Ecclestone said: ''The Government
has failed lamentably. After six years of inquiries by Sir David
Calcutt, a select committee and the Lord Chancellor's department, the
Government has admitted that it cannot define invasions of privacy.''

<TEXT>
TWO Britons and three other Westerners, held hostage by extremists in
India, faced new anguish last night after their captors refused to
extend a deadline to execute them.
Last night, wives and girlfriends of the hostages sat in a heavily
guarded bungalow in northern India anxiously awaiting news.
The separatist group holding the five tourists prisoner earlier
released a statement seeking to lay the blame for any possible deaths at
the door of the Indian Government.
However, a spokesman for the Foreign Office in London warned the
extremist Al Faran group, which has demanded the release of 20
guerrillas arrested by the Indian Government, that it would be held
responsible for any killings. The guerrillas had agreed to extend an
earlier deadline by two days.
Mr Paul Wells, 23, from London, and Mr Keith Mangan, 33, from
Middlesbrough, were kidnapped nearly two weeks ago near Pahalgam, 55
miles from Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Kashmir state.
American Don Hutchings, 42, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostro, 27, and
German Dirk Hasert, 26, also were seized in the area around the same
time.
A five-year separatist rebellion has been raging in the province, the
only Muslim-majority state in India, a mainly Hindu country.
A tape of Mr Hutchings' voice was received yesterday by the BBC in
Kashmir, in which the American said the five were being well treated and
were ''OK''.
However, during the recording, in which the voices of the two Britons
could be heard, Mr Hutchings added desperately: ''We have walked many
days and many nights over the mountains.
''I do not know if today I will die or tomorrow I will die. I do not
know what will happen.''
A statement released by the Al Faran group said: ''We made contact
with the (Indian) government three days ago but the government does not
seem to be prepared for any purposeful talks.
''It appears the government is not interested in the release of the
hostages.''
The extremists called on the international community, particularly
those making appeals for the release of the hostages, to put pressure on
India to secure their release.
But a Foreign Office spokesman warned: ''Responsibility has to lie
with those who carry out the threats and not with those who don't accede
to their demands.''
He said the threats were being taken ''very seriously indeed'' but
refused to discuss the actions being taken by the British government to
secure the hostages' release.
The Al Faran guerrillas said in a written statement to reporters: ''We
will not extend the deadline. After the deadline expires, the hostages
may be killed at any time.''
In another development yesterday, a Muslim leader in Pakistan said he
has been asked to mediate the release of the hostages.
Maulana Fazlur Rehman, head of the powerful and moderate
Jamiat-e-Ulemae Islam political party, said the British Embassy and a
caller who identified himself as an Al Faran member had asked him to
intervene in the release of the tourists.
''I am willing to mediate to save the lives of the innocent
tourists,'' he said in an interview with Associated Press.
In the recording, it was not clear whether Mr Hutchings was talking on
his own or reading a statement prepared by the militants.
The other hostages could be heard making statements on the cassette
but only the comments by Mr Wells were clear.
''My name is Paul Wells. I am from the United Kingdom. I was captured
10 days ago. We are very tired,'' he said.

Larnaca, Monday
THREE British soldiers accused of killing a Danish tour guide last
year after a drinking bout in Cyprus pleaded not guilty today to charges
of manslaughter, abduction, and conspiracy to rape.
The three riflemen were impassive as the trial opened after 10 months
of preliminary hearings and responded with ''not guilty'' to the
charges.
Prosecutor Petros Clerides told the court in Larnaca that the three
knocked Louise Jensen and her boyfriend off his motorcycle, hit her with
a shovel, then threw her ''shouting, crying, and trying to get away''
into the back of their car.
Her body was found two days later in a makeshift grave three miles
away.
''This young girl from Denmark had the misfortune to be found on the
night of September 13 to be in the path of the accused. She paid for
this with her brutal death,'' Clerides said.
Alan Ford, 26, from Birmingham; Justin Fowler, 27, from Falmouth,
Cornwall; and Jeff Pernell, 23, of Oldbury, West Midlands were later
taken in handcuffs to the petrol station in Ayia Napa, where Clerides
said the attack took place.
The case has shocked Cyprus and thrown a harsh spotlight on the
behaviour of off-duty soldiers at the two British military bases.
The three accused are serving with the Royal Greenjackets based at
Dhekelia.
About 50 people packed the small, sweltering courtroom as Clerides
told the court that the soldiers had drunk alcohol at various clubs and
restaurants in Ayia Napa before going to the petrol station at the
outskirts of town.
As they pulled out, a motorcycle driven by Cypriot waiter Michalis
Vassiliades, 22, and carrying Jensen, his 23-year-old girlfriend, tried
to overtake them.
The soldier driving the car swerved into them and knocked them off. As
Vassiliades tried to help a trapped Jensen up from under the bike, a
soldier attacked him with a shovel and he ''ran away terrified'',
Clerides said.
The other two assaulted Jensen, then threw her in the car, he added.
Later Judge Takis Eliades and lawyers visited the petrol station with
the three defendants.
A convoy then wound its way through potato fields on the back roads
along which, police say, the soldiers took the victim.
The court also visited the field outside Paralimni where Jensen's
mutilated body, identifiable only by a ring and rose tattoo, was found
in a shallow grave.
The court was adjourned until Thursday and the three men were remanded
in custody.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office and the Stock Exchange have decided to take
no action over an alleged illegal share option deal involving six
PowerGen directors, the company said yesterday.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of PowerGen, said the regulators had had
access to all the information and had decided to take no action
regarding claims of wrongful dealing, made by the Observer.
PowerGen had instituted proceedings for damages against the newspaper,
a press spokesman said.
The newspaper alleged that six top directors of PowerGen had cashed in
share options in April 1994 after seeing a five-year plan implying that
PowerGen would make unexpectedly poor profits.
Sir Colin told PowerGen's annual meeting in Birmingham yesterday:
''There has been much media and political comment about the events
surrounding the exercising of share options by the executive directors
in April 1994.
''These options were granted in March 1991 in line with what was
widely regarded as best practice at the time.''
Commenting on the Greenbury report, he added: ''I am pleased to report
that virtually all the recommendations are already incorporated in the
remuneration policy accepted at this meeting 12 months ago.''

AFTER doing her stint at the Department of Health, Virginia Bottomley
might have felt that life was bound to be easier at National Heritage --
thinking of grand ways to celebrate the Millennium, taking in a spot of
opera, ballet, theatre, as befitted an arts Minister, popping in to some
museums, galleries, yummy old buildings to keep in touch with the
Heritage one was responsible for -- that kind of thing.
Perhaps when Sir Humphrey placed on her desk the Government's response
-- two years in gestation -- to the National Heritage Select Committee's
report on Privacy and Media Intrusion, she realised that life was not
going to be that much fun here either.
For it hardly needed her former professional skills as a psychiatric
social worker to realise that the MPs listening to her were seriously
disturbed. One after the other, they rose from both sides of the Chamber
to tell her that what the Government had decided to do -- or rather not
do -- was absolutely useless.
''Gutless and supine,'' declared Mr David Ashby, having himself
enjoyed or endured tabloid encounters of the close kind as he protested
that he had only shared a bed with a male friend in France because the
hotel only had one bed available.
The House, as one person, told Virginia that to believe the media can
regulate itself requires the faith of a first-class saint or the
credulity of a world class chump and they had neither. A top-class
politician might have told Sir Humphrey: ''I'm not reading that to
them,'' and demanded time to make her own mind up.
As it was, she got the kind of reception Ministers dread. Everyone was
against her. It resembled the awful occasions when Michael Heseltine
announced the closing of nearly all Britain's remaining pits or Nicholas
Ridley tried to sell leasing the Falklands to Argentina as a good idea.
It was not quite so bad, as MPs made more allowance for Virginia than
the other two.
Sir Giles Shaw (Pudsey -- Con.), her first critic, was politely
critical, but from there on it was downhill all the way.
Mr Roger Gale (Thanet North -- Con.), a former BBC journalist, spoke
of the ''total contempt'' of some journalists and newspapers for the
laws of libel because they knew most victims did not have enough money
to sue.
Mr Joe Ashton (Bassetlaw -- Lab.) thought bits of the press now
resembled the KGB or the Stasi in their harassment of individuals.
Sir Edward Heath shocked us all by declaring that two-thirds of the
media was owned by foreigners ''who have no interest in our welfare''.
Could this be the winner of the Charlemagne prize, the man who dreams of
an ever wider and deeper European Union. Then we realised that he was
thinking about Australians and Canadians who, in Sir Edward's mind,
constitute the real foreigners compared with our kith and kin in
Bavaria, Sicily, etc.
He suggested that no-one should own more than one media unit, not a
suggestion one imagines that Mr Tony Blair had been putting to a certain
Australian magnate. Indeed, the admirable Labour spokesman, Mr Chris
Smith, though still admirable, did seem to have his foot on the brake.
He was disappointed there was to be no legislation for simple intrusion,
pointed out a couple of defects but welcomed the rejection of a
statutory body to oversee the press.
Virginia agreed that ''we cannot imprison the press in a cage of legal
restraint'', a sentence which sounds very odd if you substitute
''law-abiding citizen'' for ''press''.
Mr Smith made a little joke about one of Virginia's predecessors,
David Mellor, warning the media some years ago that they were in the
Last Chance saloon. It looked as if the saloon's licence had been
extended, he said. What MPs wanted was for some of the cowboys to be
charged with being drunk and disorderly.

Lagos, Monday
THE heads of BP and Shell in Nigeria were warned today that their
companies' interests were in jeopardy if Britain continued to be hostile
to Nigeria.
Nigerian Oil Minister Dan Etete summoned the executives to his office.
''The Minister impressed upon them that the unfriendly posture of the
British Government and its general attitude towards the Government and
people of Nigeria might jeopardise their business interest,'' said a
statement.
Britain today piled new pressure on Nigeria's military government over
the secret trial of 40 alleged coup plotters, demanding that it set a
timetable for a return to civilian rule before November's Commonwealth
summit.
Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Hanley told Parliament that General
Sani Abacha's government was flouting a commitment to democratic rule
signed by Commonwealth members in 1991.
''It is difficult to see how Nigeria can play a full role in
Commonwealth affairs until she puts her house in order,'' said Mr
Hanley.
Relations between the two countries have been strained since last
week, when Overseas Development Minister Lynda Chalker said that Nigeria
may be barred from the Commonwealth summit because of the coup
trial.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Major gives pledge on mortgage tax</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977338604</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister last night ruled out any further cuts in mortgage
tax relief for the time being.
Mr Major told the country's builders he was looking at a range of
options to help home buyers and said changes to Miras were not planned
in the current Parliament.
The Prime Minister, addressing the Manufacturing and Construction
Industries Alliance, said the Government's aim was to keep interest
rates as low as possible and increase confidence in the housing market.
The Conservative Party philosophy towards home ownership was
instinctive and ''rock solid''. Government policies would double the
living standards of every British family in the next 20 years, he said.
The Prime Minister said the housing market was an important part of a
balanced economy and Ministers had been giving serious consideration to
a wide range of proposals put to them aimed at helping the homes market.
''We have not yet decided which action would be appropriate or what
action would be effective,'' he said.
President of the Housebuilders' Federation, Charles Gallagher, earlier
warned Mr Major there was a widespread fear home ownership was no longer
a core value for the Government.
''At least one of your colleagues, Prime Minister, is on the record
that houses should not be seen as an investment -- they are an
inappropriate way for people to save.
''Aside from patronising millions of people who profoundly disagree,
these ill-judged remarks strike at the heart of our social and financial
system. They damage confidence,'' he said.
The Federation proposed that the Government introduce a Miras package
for first-time buyers to allow interest tax relief at 25% up to a loan
limit of #50,000.
Mr Gallagher said this would put up to #600 per year into the pockets
of first-time buyers.
Later, responding to Mr Major's speech, Mr Gallagher said: ''I very
much welcome his reaffirmation of Government support for home
ownership.''
MINISTERS plan to scrap state help for homebuyers who lose their jobs,
Labour claimed last night.
Shadow Social Security Minister Keith Bradley insisted in the Commons
that this was the next logical step following a controversial Government
decision to cut mortgage interest benefit, which from October will no
longer be paid to new borrowers for the first 39 weeks of a claim.
Junior Social Security Minister Roger Evans denied the Government had
plans to go further.
Mr Evans said the existing system was not supporting the housing
market adequately.
He said 70% of people who had had their homes repossessed did not
qualify for income support, and three quarters of borrowers in arrears
did not get the benefit.
''There is a better way, a way which encourages private responsibility
and encourages people to take out insurance.''

<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977338605</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MPs LAST night defied the Government to back a cross-party move to
improve the pensions of longer-serving Members.
The Commons supported changes to MPs' pension scheme as well as an
amendment opposed by Leader of the House Tony Newton, who warned it
would cost the Treasury #2.3m to top up the fund.
He emphasised that the move would benefit fewer than one third of
current Members.
The proposal to increase pension rights for MPs' service in the House
before July 1983, when other changes were made, to match those for
service after that date, came originally from the Senior Salaries Review
Body.
Opposing the recommendation, Mr Newton said such a move would affect
only 185 of the 651 MPs.
The other 466 would either be unaffected or only minimally in the case
of those first elected in June 1983, as the change happened a month
later.
However, Mr Peter Fry (Wellingborough -- Con.) complained that the
Government was ready to help MPs' widows when Members died in service,
''but is apparently resisting any attempt to help us while we're still
alive.''
Shadow Commons Leader Ann Taylor, backing the amendment, said the
argument commanded widespread support inside and outside the House.

<TEXT>
Tuzla, Monday
SOME 4000 Muslim men, telling tales of tragedy and survival, reached
safety today after eluding rebel Serbs on a hazardous six-day trek
through forests and mountains from the fallen ''safe area'' of
Srebrenica.
The men -- mainly government soldiers -- who arrived in the government
town of Tuzla said they had survived hunger, thirst, and Serb attacks.
They were among up to 19,000 Muslims said to be missing after the fall
of Srebrenica by Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
''It was a desperate run, but we knew we would be killed or worse,
otherwise,'' said Azem Alkanovic, a 38-year-old policeman.
''There were dozens and dozens of dead bodies on my trail. If you
found a wounded man, you would carry him as far as you could. Then . . .
,'' He left the sentence unfinished.
Bosnian authorities said the 4000 were among an estimated 15,000 men,
including 6000 government soldiers, who last Tuesday began a 60-mile
trek across Serb-held land, and through front lines to try to reach
safety.
''Nobody kept count. Nobody turned his head. Each struggled to save
his own life,'' said Alkanovic, as he described the terrifying march
through woods, under fire from cannon and anti-aircraft weapons.
''We ran for life, in one big group, in a column. There was little
food and no water. We were ambushed twice, and shot at by gunfire.''
Meanwhile, many of the thousands of traumatised women deported from
Srebrenica gave graphic accounts of atrocities carried out in the
aftermath of the Bosnian Serbs' capture of Srebrenica.
Zarfa Turkovic says she watched through half-closed eyes, pretending
to sleep, hoping she would not be next, as four Bosnian Serb men raped a
28-year-old Muslim woman.
The refugees thought the worst was over when they reached a UN base at
Potocari, two miles north of the fallen safe haven.
But it was there, despite the presence of Dutch peacekeepers, that
Turkovic claims Bosnian Serbs chose a young victim from among the
sleeping refugees.
''Two took her legs and raised them up in the air, while the third
began raping her,'' Turkovic said.
''Four of them were taking turns on her. People were silent, no-one
moved. She was screaming and yelling and begging them to stop. They put
a rag into her mouth and then we were just hearing silent sobs coming
from her closed lips.
''When they finished, the woman was left there,'' she said.
Turkovic said she and dozens of other women -- some with children --
lay only yards away, silently praying they would not be next.
''I pretended that I was sleeping, but I didn't dare because I was
afraid that if I fell to sleep they would just kill me and my
children,'' she said.
Her sister, 19-year-old Fetima, gave the same account of the rape. She
said she held one of her sister's four children in her arms, hoping that
the Serbs would be less likely to assault a mother.
''I (also) put a scarf on my head . . . to look older, for them not to
see my face and consider it pretty, because then I would have been
finished,'' Fetima said.
The peacekeepers, who the refugees hoped would be their protectors,
were themselves singled out for humiliation, Turkovic said.
On Wednesday, the day after Srebrenica was overrun, two Serbs
approached the two UN guards posted to ensure the safety of a group of
refugees and ordered them to put down their weapons and strip to their
underwear, she said.
The guards, part of the United Nations Protection Force, did so
without resistance.
''People were just looking in fear, looking at these humiliated
Unprofor soldiers,'' said Turkovic. ''We lost all our hope then. Then we
understood what Unprofor is. Nothing.''--AP.

THE Princess Royal mingled with more than 125 young people from 18
countries at the European rural youth rally at Merchiston Castle School,
Edinburgh, yesterday.
It was the largest number of participants to attend the annual rally,
which was organised by the Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs.
It was the third time the rally had been held in Scotland, the
previous ones being in 1965 and 1981.
The contingents at the rally were from Western and Central Europe and
included groups from Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Greece, Finland, and
Austria. There were observers from Argentina and Chile.
The young people were all interested in country subjects, including
farming, conservation, and healthy living.
Earlier yesterday, the Princess Royal officially opened Edinburgh's
newest hotel, the four-star Stakis hotel at Edinburgh Airport. It has
134 bedrooms.
A Stakis spokesman said the hotel had been built to schedule in 50
weeks and on budget at #7.2m. It is the first hotel to be located within
the boundaries of Edinburgh Airport.
Meanwhile, Rosyth Naval Base did its bit to support the Scottish
Business Achievement Award Trust.
More than 500 guests, including the Princess Royal, who is the trust's
patron, attended a charity fund-raising lunch on board the QE2, which
was moored at No 1 Buoy, Rosyth Naval Base, just east of the Forth rail
bridge.
A Sea King helicopter from 845 Squadron, Yeovilton, lifted off a
Jaguar XJS four-litre coupe by using a special rig, devised by the Joint
Air Transport Establishment in conjunction with Jaguar engineers.
The car was later auctioned off, the proceeds going to King George's
Fund for Sailors.

<HEADLINE>Former verger denies fabricating story of affair with 60-year-old clergyman. Woman tells of 'sex with dean'</HEADLINE>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>

<TEXT>
A FORMER cathedral verger yesterday insisted she was telling the truth
in claiming that she had two sexual encounters with the Dean of Lincoln.
Despite lengthy cross-examination, Miss Verity Freestone maintained
her account that she was intimate with the dean, the Very Reverend
Brandon Jackson, 60, at her home in the city and at the Deanery in late
1993.
The dean, who is the subject of a rare Consistory Court hearing,
denies two offences of conduct unbecoming the office and work of a clerk
in holy orders by participating in intimate sexual acts with a woman not
his wife.
Miss Freestone, 32, now a community carer, wearing a long, pale-green
checked dress, answered questions for the most part matter-of-factly
during four hours giving evidence.
She had been a verger at the cathedral for just three months in the
middle of 1993 and told how in October Dean Jackson came to her home in
Croft Street when her mother was away, attempted sexual intercourse but
could not manage it.
''He was obviously disappointed by it. I was slightly disappointed as
well but it didn't bother me a great deal at the time.''
However, she said he brought her to orgasm by performing oral sex.
She said that, after that, he made her feel that it should end, and
warned it would destroy her before it would destroy him, which made her
feel ''threatened''.
On November 30, she went to the Deanery and he again failed to achieve
sexual intercourse, again bringing her to orgasm by performing oral sex.
Afterwards she felt upset and angry, particularly when he offered #10
for a #1.90 taxi fare home.
''I felt used and that he had just paid for my services,'' she said.
The next day she telephoned him and he said that perhaps he should
have gone to bed with a whisky instead, and she called him a bastard,
she added.
Later, she went to the church authorities.
Cross-examined by Ms Anne Rafferty, QC, defending, she repeatedly
denied she had ''fabricated'' or ''imagined'' any of her story or
''woven a fantasy out of some fact''.
She accepted that she was on anti-depressants from March to December
that year, and had counselling for three months, and went to see the
dean in December 1990 to talk about ''the focus of her witness'' but had
also talked about a mature man with whom she had had a relationship.
She also told the dean about a coach driver with whom she had an
encounter while on holiday in the Lake District in September 1993.
However, she rejected a suggestion that she had found out about the
bedroom in the Deanery, so as to be able to describe it, by looking in
it when going to the toilet while taking Bible study there.
''I never wanted to use the toilet while I was at Bible study,'' she
insisted.
An affidavit from her sister Lois was read to the court, in which she
said Miss Freestone had told her on October 20, 1993, that she had had a
sexual encounter with the dean.
Four assessors are considering the case, in a hearing presided over by
Judge Richard Hamilton, a circuit judge and Chancellor of the Diocese of
Liverpool.
If found guilty, the dean could be dismissed from his post and later
defrocked by his bishop if any appeal failed. He is expected to give
evidence when the hearing resumes today.
* The consistory court system was criticised strongly last night by
the clerical section of the Manufacturing, Science, and Finance Union.
At a news conference nearby, the Rev Stephen Trott, of Boughton, near
Northampton, called for the current system to be replaced by national
civil tribunals as in other professions.
''It seems to us inappropriate that a criminal trial should be used to
deal with moral or ecclesiastical discipline,'' he said.
''It's a court of the bishop, not appointed by the Lord Chancellor.
The bishop appoints the judge, and the prosecutor, and is involved
before and after the trial, particularly with any sentence.
''Consistory court hearings are so rare because people resign rather
than face one.
''The disproportionate publicity and sentencing are not good for the
people involved or the Church, and there must be a better way of doing
things in this day and age.''

THE British Medical Association yesterday condemned as a ''direct
threat to the national nature of the health service'' a Government move
to invite open competition for the provision of hospital services in
Stonehaven.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, has now written to
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth demanding that the proposal be
dropped.
Grampian Health Board announced the plan in April in response to
proposals submitted to the Scottish Office by Grampian Healthcare,
Scotland's largest NHS trust.
In its business plan published last year it proposed to consider the
future provision of services in the town.
The health board agreed to carry out a detailed investigation and
consultation on all possible options and established a group to that
end.
The hospital services involved are GP acute beds, NHS long-stay beds
for elderly people who require clinical care, and all the associated
services for people in North Kincardine and most of South Kincardine.
The group's preferred option was to dispose of the existing Woodcot
Hospital and build a completely new hospital on the site of the existing
Arduthie Hospital. It submitted this recommendation, along with the
information about other options, to the Scottish Secretary last autumn.
It had been expected that after the wide consultation exercise the
Scottish Office would rubber stamp the proposal, but instead the
Scottish Office Management Executive told Grampian Health Board to
invite open competition.
The Scottish council of the BMA has indicated in a letter to Mr
Robertson that, like the BMA council, it is concerned about the
development, and has already taken the matter up with the Health
Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
''We do not accept that the Stonehaven situation is related to the
private finance and market-testing initiatives,'' it told Mr Robertson.
''It goes beyond these by raising the prospect of the provision of all
hospital services for NHS patients in a specific geographical area
becoming the responsibility of the private sector, not the NHS.''
The council's letter states that it views this development ''as a
direct threat to the national nature of the health service''.
The letter says the Scottish council is aware Ministers have said
that, even if the private sector does win the contract, the purchaser
will still be Grampian Health Board and the service will still be
provided free at the point of delivery.
But the letter adds that the Scottish council does ''not believe that
the healthcare of the people of Stonehaven should be a testing ground
for such a controversial initiative''.
Mr Robertson said: ''This is the thin end of the wedge for the NHS.
What is happening in Stonehaven will happen all across Britain unless it
is stopped.
''This letter completely blows out of the water earlier assurances
from the Prime Minister and the Scottish Office that this is simply an
extension of the Private Finance Initiative.
''The Tories are not just using the private sector to design and build
new hospital facilities. Under the Grampian plan private operators could
actually be running hospital services.''
Meanwhile Mr Forsyth referred to the Private Finance Initiative when
he spoke at the Bank of Scotland tercentenary dinner last night.
''This offers enormous opportunities to the financial sector -- and I
hope the Scottish financial sector in particular -- to deploy its skills
and imagination in providing capital, and sharing risks and reward with
Government, to finance the massive investments we need to improve our
physical and social capital.''
He added that Mr Ian Lang, the former Scottish Secretary, had
published a list of more than 50 public sector projects worth #3000m
which required private sector finance, including hospital services.
Mr Forsyth added: ''However, I am concerned that we in The Scottish
Office do more to raise our own profile in London and the City. Our
inward investment record is second to none -- we have just had our best
ever year with about 100 new projects, promising investments of more
than #1bn and 12,000 jobs. But we are hiding our light under a bushel.''
He said that Dover House, the London home of the Scottish Office,
should become a centre of hospitality for Scottish Trade Associations
and a symbol of co-operation between the public and private sector.

THE House of Commons reacted with fury yesterday as the Government
ruled out a legal crackdown on media invasions of privacy.
Both Conservative and Labour MPs attacked National Heritage Secretary
Virginia Bottomley as she made her first Commons appearance in her new
job.
The Government turned its back on calls for breaches of privacy to be
made a criminal or civil offence.
Mrs Bottomley did not absolutely rule out legislation but said it
would be ''a very significant step on a path we have no wish to
travel''. The Government ''strongly preferred'' a proper system of
self-regulation by the media.
Virtually every MP who spoke regarded the decision as a clear let-off
for the press, with some suspecting the Government of attempting to
curry favour with media barons before the next General Election.
Mrs Bottomley was giving the Government's response to the two-year-old
report by the National Heritage Select Committee dealing with breaches
of privacy.
She called for a tougher code of practice, spelling out breaches more
clearly and which was binding on editors. There should also be a fund
set up by the media industry from which the Press Complaints Commission
could compensate victims whose privacy had been invaded.
Ministers also suggest a ''press hot-line'' to allow the PCC or the
Privacy Commissioner to warn editors of the consequences if they were
thought likely to publish a story or picture in breach of the code.
Mrs Bottomley said the independent, non-statutory PCC, set up in 1991,
had been considerably strengthened under the chairmanship of former
Cabinet Minister Lord Wakeham.
However, Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith suggested that the
European Convention on Human Rights, which struck a balance between the
rights to privacy and free expression, should be incorporated into
British law.
He said there was ''severe disappointment'' at the refusal to
introduce a new criminal offence of invading privacy: ''When the
hospital bedroom of Gordon Kaye or Russell Harty is invaded to get a
cheap story, that is something all of us in the Commons would wish to
deal with.''
Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath told Mrs Bottomley: ''You said
we had some of the finest press in the world. We have nothing of the
sort. We used to have and now a large part of it is the worst in the

FOUR people, including a six-year-old boy, were killed and five others
were injured yesterday in three road crashes in Scotland.
Emergency services last night attended the worst collision involving a
coach and two cars on the A77 Stranraer-Glasgow road at Innermessan. Two
men and a woman died and another woman, who was badly injured, was taken
to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.
All four were in one of the cars, a Fiesta. The other car driver
escaped with only minor injuries. Police would not release their names
last night but it is understood that no-one in the Fiesta lived locally.
None of the 45 coach passengers was thought to have been injured,
although some suffered shock and bruising.
The coach hit a crash barrier, after the driver apparently tried to
avoid the collision. It is understood the group was returning to
Northern Ireland after visiting Edinburgh for a Tall Ships event.
The road was blocked at its junction with the A751, which links the
A77 with the A75 Gretna-Stranraer Euroroute.
Police set up diversions but large queues of traffic built up because
of the heavy volume of vehicles using the ferry routes from Stranraer
and Cairnryan.
Mrs Irene White, who lives at Innermessan Cottage, yards from the
scene, said: ''This is a notorious accident blackspot and it is time
something was done. There have been many accidents here and the road is
very busy with ferry traffic.''
Earlier yesterday, a holiday trip ended in tragedy when the car in
which a Scots family was travelling back from France went out of control
and overturned in a field beside the M8, killing a six-year old boy.
The Volvo hit a central reservation only a mile from their home in
West Lothian at 5.30am. The family had driven 500 miles from Portsmouth
after holidaying in south-west France. No other vehicle was involved.
Police named the dead boy as Ian Campbell of Burnside, Uphall. His
parents, Alex and Linda Campbell, are being treated at Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary, where they were said to be comfortable.
Ian's brother Ross, who was thrown out of the car and suffered a head
injury, is in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, where he is stable.
Assistant divisional officer David Young, of Lothian and Borders Fire
Brigade, said: ''This was one of the worst accidents I have attended in
my many years with the fire service. The circumstances are tragic.''
A crash investigation team is trying to establish how the accident
happened. One possibility is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel.
Police are interviewing passing motorists who raised the alarm.
Meanwhile, a lorry driver was trapped for two hours last night when
his articulated lorry overturned in an accident on the A70 near
Ravenstruther, south of Carstairs.
The man, who has not been named, suffered serious leg injuries and was
taken to Law Hospital.
* Meanwhile, four members of a Scottish family were last night
recovering from injuries sustained in a crash with a vehicle driven by
joyriders in Yorkshire.
Mr William Smart, 68, of Park Place, Kinghorn, and his grandson Brian,
15, of Broomhill Avenue, Burntisland, were detained in hospital in
Leeds, while his son Mr William Smart Jr, 41, and other grandson, also
William, 17, were released.

<HEADLINE>Casino owners want 'absurd' rules scrapped</HEADLINE>

CASINO owners yesterday called for the scrapping of ''absurd and
draconian'' restrictions on the industry which they claimed were driving
foreign ''high rollers'' on to the gaming tables of overseas
competitors.
The British Casino Association demanded deregulation of the sector in
line with similar relaxations of the rules governing other gambling
sectors, such as bookmaking and the national lottery.
The organisation, which represents the UK's 119 casinos, claimed the
rules governing the industry set out in the 1968 Gaming Act were
outdated and unfair.
In a pamphlet published ahead of the Government's consultation paper
on deregulation expected in the autumn, the BCA said the industry
provided a ''legitimate and popular leisure activity which employs
11,000 people, contributes #123m taxes, and receives #555m in overseas
earnings out of a total of #2460m staked in the last financial year''.
The association wants the Government to:
* Scrap the so-called 48-hour ''cooling off'' rule which prevents
punters from gambling for two days after they have joined a casino.
* End the ban on advertising by casinos so that the industry can
attract more players, particularly from overseas.
* Relax restrictions on slot machines, at present limited to two per
casino with a #200 maximum prize. The industry wants a maximum of
#250,000 so Britain can compete with Las Vegas and France.
* End the ban on credit and debit card payments by gamblers who are
currently restricted to the use of cash, cheques, or casino chips.
* Change the licensing laws so gamblers can continue drinking after
midnight.
The BCA's chairman, Mr Brian Lemon, told a news conference: ''The 1968
Act has not been updated for nearly 30 years. It is paternalistic,
archaic, and out of step with the Britain of the 1990s.
''We're not seeking wholesale deregulation, but sensible modernisation
to enable us to compete effectively for foreign customers and to enable
our customers to gain under less onerous conditions.''

BUSINESSMAN John Slattery has become Scotland's biggest lottery
millionaire with a #2.8m win.
He celebrated further when his 14-year-old twin sons won first and
third places in a golf competition at their club in Bathgate, West
Lothian.
Mr Slattery, 43, an Armadale haulage contractor, is a reader of The
Herald. ''I buy it for your excellent golf coverage,'' he said.
His wife Betty, who works part-time in a local bar, and twins Colin
and Stephen, along with brother Liam, 16, were delighted with their win,
said Mr Slattery.
He has yet to decide his future but will take a short holiday with the
family. His numbers were based on family birthdays.
''When my wife and I checked our numbers on Saturday night, I almost
hit the ceiling, jumping up from the settee. But I found it the
strangest feeling trying to come to terms with it. My wife and I never
slept all night and went for a walk at 6am to try to relax, although it
was impossible.''

THE night sky over Leith was turned into a kaleidoscope of colour last
night, amid the spectacular fireworks display designed to give the Tall
Ships a special send-off.
Thousands turned up to watch the event, with people in Fife and as far
away as Livingston able to see soaring star bursts and streams of
rockets light up the sky.
Pyrotechnics expert Wilf Scott, already well known in Edinburgh for
his staging of the annual Glenlivet event during the Edinburgh Festival,
had promised it would be special, with the reflection of the fireworks
on the water adding an extra dimension.
Sponsorship of the event was provided by the Bank of Scotland, as part
of its 300th birthday celebrations.
Earlier, the Princess Royal, who will start the Tall Ships race today,
mingled with more than 125 young people from 18 countries at the
European rural youth rally at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh,
yesterday.
It was the largest number of participants to attend the annual rally,
which was organised by the Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs.
The contingents at the rally were from Western and Central Europe and
included groups from Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Greece, Finland, and
Austria. There were observers from Argentina and Chile.
The young people were all interested in country subjects, including
farming, conservation, and healthy living.
Earlier yesterday, the Princess Royal officially opened Edinburgh's
newest hotel, the four-star Stakis hotel at Edinburgh Airport. It has
134 bedrooms.
Meanwhile, Rosyth Naval Base did its bit to support the Scottish
Business Achievement Award Trust.
More than 500 guests, including the Princess Royal, who is the trust's
patron, attended a charity fund-raising lunch on board the QE2, which
was moored at No 1 Buoy, Rosyth Naval Base, just east of the Forth rail
bridge.

<HEADLINE>Timetable hitch hits Higher Still reform</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE,
THE Government's Higher Still reform of upper-secondary schooling is
running into serious time-scale difficulties.
Government advisers have concluded that the August 1997 deadline for
introducing new Highers and an array of other courses for fifth and
sixth-year pupils cannot be met.
Ministers and Scottish Office Education Department officials have
maintained that the timetable is manageable because the reform builds on
the existing course framework.
But it now transpires that, contrary to their expectations, many new
courses will have to be developed if Higher Still is to be fully
implemented.
If the Scottish Office adheres to the time-scale the reform will be
boycotted by the teachers' unions, which fear new courses will increase
workload.
Higher Still intends that young people should be offered a ''menu'' of
about 200 courses, broken into 2000 units, or short courses.
It is understood that senior SOED officials have been told that major
changes will have to be made in the content of about 25% of these units.
The estimate is based on feedback from teachers and educationists on
the 28 specialist working groups which have been responsible for
producing general frameworks for subject groups.
Their proposals are due to be sent out to schools next month for
consultation. The end of December has been set as the deadline for
consultation.
If the 1997 timetable is to be met the subject groups will have to
write courses and units and decide how they are to be assessed by next
Easter.
But it is understood that the senior chief inspector of schools, Mr
Nisbet Gallacher, and his colleague Mr Ron Tuck -- widely believed to
have been the driving force behind the Higher Still blueprint -- have
been told that the job cannot be done in three months because so many
changes in content are involved.
They were given the news at the last meeting of the Higher Still
strategy group, which has an overview of the development and represents
all the key players in the reform.
Mr Gallacher chairs the group, which has about 20 members. The Herald
has been told that Mr Frank Pignatelli, who chairs the Higher Still
curriculum and assessment group which has overall responsibility for the
specialist groups, has concluded that technically the timetable cannot
be met.
It is understood that Mr Cameron Harrison, chief executive of the
Government's main advisory body on the curriculum, also expressed
reservations about the timetable.
Yesterday Mr Harrison said: ''The advice the council offers to the
Government is confidential and on that basis I cannot comment.''
Problems are said to have arisen because Higher Still demands the
marrying of so-called academic courses run by the Scottish Examination
Board and vocational ones offered by Scotvec.
As a result, the specialist groups have produced proposals which are
far more complex than the Government had imagined.
An SOED official confirmed last night that representations had been
made to Ministers asking for a delay in implementation.
Mr Craig Duncan, deputy general secretary of the Scottish Secondary
Teachers' Association, confirmed yesterday that the union would withdraw
from Higher Still if there were workload implications.
The Educational Institute of Scotland, which is boycotting Higher
Still as part of a wider workload campaign, has asked the Scottish
Office for a meeting to press for a delay and more resources. The EIS
deputy general secretary, Mr Fred Forrester, said: ''Everyone will
breathe a sigh of relief if there is to be more time, but a lot also
depends on resources.''
The Higher Still blueprint was produced after the Howie Committee
confirmed that the upper secondary was not meeting the needs of the
growing number of young people staying on after the age of 16. About 80%
of pupils now stay on beyond 16.

<HEADLINE>Chancellor moves swiftly but fails to dispel doubts over executive pay. Dawn raid on share options</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE Government struck at dawn yesterday to abolish tax relief on
executive share option schemes.
The immediate response to the Greenbury report on boardroom pay may
have surprised businessmen but was criticised as ''too little, too
late'' by union officials and described by Labour as an embarrassing
''U-turn''.
The report's recommendations were greeted with doubts over whether
they would be effective in combatting executive greed. Shadow Chancellor
Gordon Brown pointed out Mr Clarke's previous opposition to taxing
share-option profits as income and said the report did little to tackle
abuses over pay.
He called on the Government to ban share options in the privatisation
of the rail and nuclear industries and to give utility regulators
greater powers to cut prices for consumers.
''Just as with VAT on fuel last year, the Government has defended
unfair tax privileges available to only a few, repeatedly refused to
take action in successive Budgets, and has been forced to climb down
only because of both pressure and the public,'' Mr Brown said.
TUC general secretary John Monks was ''not happy'' with the report
because it failed to recommend legislation. He said it was ''nothing
like good enough as voluntary disclosures backed up by a voluntary code
will not stop greedy executives paying themselves double-figure pay
increases''.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, said: ''Greenbury
leaves the gravy train wheels oiled and still on track.''
However, the report was welcomed by the Institute of Directors and the
CBI.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke caught executives asleep by announcing at
6.15am his decision to implement one of Sir Richard Greenbury's main
recommendations. From yesterday, profits from share options will be
treated as income rather than capital gains.
In a parallel move, the Stock Exchange announced it would incorporate
into its rules the code of best practice recommended by the Greenbury
group, which details tough standards for the behaviour of public
companies in setting executive pay.
Mr Clarke's move, announced 15 minutes after the report was published,
was intended to head off any last minute cashing in of share options
following rumours of a rush to offload shares last week.
Because the top rate of tax is identical in each case -- 40% -- the
maximum extra tax that executives would have to pay is #2400, prompting
speculation that middle managers, rather than high earners, would be the
worst hit. The Treasury expects to raise #80m from the change, to be
introduced in the next Finance Bill.
The Greenbury group, consisting of senior figures in the City led by
Sir Richard, Marks and Spencer chairman, was set up in response to the
outcry over the scale of share-option packages awarded to the directors
of privatised utilities, including a 75% pay increase for the chief
executive of British Gas.
In the Commons yesterday, Mr Ian Lang, President of the Board of
Trade, promised that the Government would consider the report over the
summer recess and respond in full in the autumn.
He welcomed the report's conclusions ''in principle'' but reiterated
the Government's bottom line, that ''pay in the private sector is a
matter for companies and their shareholders''.
The Greenbury report proved the private sector was prepared to respond
of its own accord to concerns on this issue, he said. It vindicated the
self-regulatory approach.
Mr Lang also struck a combative note. ''The Government has no
intention of introducing a top people's pay policy. We do not begrudge
top salaries for top performance. Our companies must compete at world
level if our nation is to prosper.''
He also reassured MPs that the measure was aimed at executives:
secretaries, shop-workers, and other low-paid workers who had received
shares from their companies would not be affected by the change.
Introducing his findings, Sir Richard said some directors had
demonstrated ''mistaken judgment'' over pay. ''A lot of people are not
going to be terribly happy with much of this report. We have gone a lot
further than a lot of people would have liked us to have gone, although
we have not gone as far as some people would have wished,'' he told BBC
Radio 4's Today programme.
Labour said it would give shareholders the right to vote on
remuneration packages before implementation at a company's annual
meeting. Share-option schemes would be banned in the privatised
utilities altogether.
Trade and industry spokesman Jack Cunningham said the party had no
objection to gearing pay to performance, particularly for those who
create wealth and jobs. ''We have no objections to high rewards for high
performance,'' he said.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Nick Harvey, trade and industry
spokesman, attacked Labour and the Government for ignoring the ''real''
problems facing the country. ''While people are angry about the vast
sums this handful of top people is earning, many are more worried about
their own lack of job security, about unemployment, about negative
equity, and about inflation.''
The Stock Exchange will amend its listing rules from October to
include the Greenbury code of practice, which require a company to
produce an annual ''self standing'' report on its pay policy along with
its annual report and accounts. The report will have to detail the
components of each director's pay, in addition to participation in share
option schemes.

THE Prime Minister summoned a crisis meeting of his key Ministers last
night as the Bosnian situation deteriorated. The United States has still
to decide whether her air power is to be committed to firmer military
action.
Today, Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind is flying to Washington to
convince the Americans that, without their help, the UN position in
Bosnia could be doomed.
About 200 helicopters are required to reinforce the so-called ''safe
haven'' of Gorazde where 300 Royal Welch Fusiliers are in danger of
becoming beleaguered. The helicopters are needed to reinforce them and
to reassert with military might the future of the safe havens after the
fall of Srebrenica. The Bosnian capital of Sarajevo is also under fire
from the advancing Serbs.
Mr Major has called a conference in London on Friday of all the
Western nations involved to make what is rapidly becoming a final
decision about whether the United Nations has the will to continue or
the means to withdraw.
As Mr Rifkind prepared to leave for Washington last night, he did so
to the echo of a chilling warning from the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, who signalled strong resistance to Nato intervention
against the Bosnian Serbs, traditional allies of Moscow.
Mr Kozyrev predicted drily that Western intervention would stop ''on
the first day CNN shows civilian casualties inflicted by a third force,
or by Nato or others''.
Mr Major is still awaiting a vital decision by President Clinton to
commit American forces to an action that might result in casualties. US
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff,
left a meeting with British and French military chiefs on Sunday night
at the Ministry of Defence to report back to Washington.
The French are demanding that the United Nations take military action
to reinstate the safe havens which are being over-run with desperate
suffering being caused to civilian Muslims.
In Brussels yesterday, Mr Rifkind argued that such action could not be
taken without the practicalities of moving sufficient UN forces to the
endangered areas, which needs the full commitment of the US Task Force
in the Adriatic.
The Downing Street Cabinet committee meeting ended late last night
after nearly three hours of discussion about what to do next. The
Government is now considering testing the views of the Commons in a
debate tomorrow.
No detail of the Cabinet discussions was emerging last night.
So fast is the Bosnian disaster escalating that it now threatens the
relationship between the EU and the Americans whose newly-empowered
Republicans want the US unilaterally to ignore the UN arms embargo.
This in turn could anger the Russians.
Mr Rifkind made it plain he did not wish to see an enforced withdrawal
of UN peacekeepers and that the end of the arms embargo would lead to
huge loss of life. However, he accepted that if the Bosnian Muslims were
armed, the inevitable result would be the withdrawal of UN troops.
The French Foreign Minister, Mr Herve de Charette, said in Paris
yesterday that it was too early to judge if Sunday's meeting of military
chiefs would lead to joint action to protect the Muslim enclaves.
''We have reached the uncrossable red line. The idea that we must stop
giving up more territory to the Serbs is gaining ground,'' he said.
Last night, the crisis meeting at No 10 was working on two things: The
final details of a UN withdrawal from Bosnia, organised by Nato, should
this become necessary, and the various military scenarios discussed by
the defence chiefs on Sunday night.
The most ambitious of these involves recapturing or relieving
Srebrenica and Zepa but the most probable was a plan to reinforce
Gorazde by air and securing a land corridor over Mount Igman to
Sarajevo. US air power is required for both possibilities.
The new Defence Secretary, Mr Michael Portillo, returned from Bosnia
to London last night in order to give the Cabinet committee meeting an
update on the 300 British troops in Gorazde.
Yesterday, war evacuees living in Scotland urged the international
community to take action to protect Bosnians or let them defend
themselves.
They were taking part in a demonstration in Glasgow's George Square,
organised by the Scottish Friends of Bosnia campaign.
