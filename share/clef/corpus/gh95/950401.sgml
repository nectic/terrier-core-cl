THE cultivation of the Americans' taste for The Macallan brands helped
Banffshire distiller Macallan-Glenlivet lift 1994 pre-tax profits by 17%
to #6.69m in what are difficult times for the industry, writes IAN
McCONNELL.
Sales of its sole seven to 25-year-old single malt range were up 28%
in the US, where the distiller uses the Remy Cointreau's distribution
machine.
Double-digit percentage increases in sales were achieved in all of the
company's principal markets, including the UK, France, Spain, the
Netherlands and Italy.
Overall, sales of The Macallan were up 20% year-on-year, accounting
for nearly three-fifths of total turnover, which was up 11% at #17.2m.
Growth of The Macallan, which the company is determined to continue,
offset a further 11% decline in sales of new malt ''fillings'' to other
distillers and blenders for use in their own whiskies.
Macallan-Glenlivet raised its total payout by 15% to 1.265p, after a
final dividend of 0.855p.

PAUL Godfrey is almost one of Scotland's own even if he was initially
part of the Oxbridge brigade. It was Perth and Inverness that gave him
his first opportunities in writing and directing before he was taken up
by the National's studio wing and the Royal Court.
The Blue Ball is his third play, took eighteen months to research and
clearly reflects an obsession. ''Born six months before they put the
first human in space in 1961, I was an unwitting child of this space
age,'' he writes. What, he wonders, did astronauts feel like when they
returned to earth?
Having talked to well over a quarter ofthem, his answer is -- a
terrible nothingness. Writing with spare, eloquent compassion, the
play's essence is ordinariness where we look for wonderment. These
astronauts and their wives are Mr and Mrs Average -- lacking
imagination, unable to communicate, prey to the usual petty human
foibles -- ambition, domestic neglect, tunnel-visioned careerism. Famous
they may have become, but the fame is all in how we perceived them, not
in what they are.
Sometimes the writing and performances feel infected, too, with
ordinariness -- inert, lacking action. Thrillingly though, Godfrey does
present his own play in a way that highlights our own perceptions of
seeing and being seen with characters facing each other head-on in a
spectrum of lights analogous to the spheres suspended above. In a real
sense, though, The Blue Ball is a play of disillusionment.

A JOBS creation scheme worth #500,000 was launched in Argyll
yesterday.
Within minutes of the programme, called Enable, being formally
announced, officials received their first customer.
A spokesman said: ''We expected a prompt start, but this early
response has surprised us.''
Argyll and Bute District Council is providing #250,000 to kickstart
businesses and this figure will be matched by Argyll and the Islands
Enterprise.
Mr David McIntyre, chief executive of Argyll and Islands Enterprise,
said: ''What we have tried to establish through Enable is a practical
vehicle to achieve maximum development and benefit for local people.''
The partnership expects to help create hundreds of new jobs in the
''double our money'' deal. Applicants can receive two sets of grants,
one from the partnership, on top of other funds from traditional
sources.
It is believed to be the first such joint approach to the creation of
economic development in Scotland.
Officials hope that would-be businessmen, who cannot obtain grants
from traditional sources, will benefit from the scheme.
District council chairman, Mr George MacMillan, said: ''The
partnership is committed to recognising needs in the area and making
money work to address these needs.
''The finance will take effect at grassroots level, where we need to
start building the foundations of a better economy in Argyll and Bute.''

<HEADLINE>Leishman finally ends his long affair with Dunfermline.  Sweet rather than bitter without Fifers</HEADLINE>

FEW names automatically bring a smile to football faces in an era when
it appears that to laugh is a sign of weakness. But when the news broke
last week that Jim Leishman was returning to football management, it is
certain that many people within and without the game allowed themselves
a wee grin of pleasure.
Leishman is a rarity in these serious times, a man who enjoys
football, playing, managing, watching or talking about it, and is not
afraid to let it be known.
It would be misguided, however, to suggest that there is not a lot of
depth behind that gag-a-minute exterior.
Leishman's comeback to Meadowbank Thistle is only a sign that at last
he might just have come to terms with the hurt that has persisted since
he was forced out of his job as Dunfermline manager five years ago.
The jokes hide a nature more sensitive than most in a sport where
growing a tough hide is a pre-requisite of survival.
In fact, Leishman gave up his last management post with Montrose two
years ago simply because he could not rid himself of the ache to return
to East End Park.
''I told the chairman at Montrose, Brian Keith, who is a lovely man,
that I was cheating them,'' he recalled this week, ''I had lost the
motivation. I think I realised at that point that I was not going back
to Dunfermline, and I could not find the will or enthusiasm to continue
in the game.''
Not too many managers would have been as brutally honest with
themselves or their employers, but for Leishman there was no sense in
deceiving the club.
The man who spent eight years as a player with the Fifers then, after
a four-year separation, 10 years as assistant and manager, had done a
stint with Inverness Thistle after his orginal attempts to recover from
the shock of being asked to switch to general manager duties at East End
Park.
He stayed, travelling north for six months, loved the club, but found
the commuting from Dunfermline demanding, and when Montrose came for
him, he jumped at the chance to be nearer to home.
When he opted out altogether, Leishman had to turn to other methods of
earning his keep, and admits that in the days since leaving Dunfermline,
he has had to adjust to a less comfortable lifestyle.
''It takes time to adjust from an income in the #35,000-#40,000-a-year
range to #15,000, but you learn to survive.''
His ability to talk has been paramount in that survival. Much in
demand for after-dinner speaking -- ''although a lot of that is charity
work,'' -- he has also been lecturing at Lauder College on sports
management. ''I was very busy and enjoyed it and, to be honest, I didn't
worry about being out of the game.''
That was until six months ago when he confesses the old urge
reasserted itself, and the chance to be part of a club which will soon
be the leisure centrepiece of new town Livingston was more than enough
to entice him back.
''I believe I am ready again, and to be involved with Meadowbank when
they are moving to Livingston will mean that I am part of something
entirely new.
''There will be no past, no history and everything we do will be
firsts. That is an exciting prospect.''
He gets slightly touchy when people suggest he is the ideal front man
for such a venture, pointing out that he does have a fair track record
in the football department, too.
Meadowbank are stuck in second bottom of the second division,
offically twenty-ninth out of 40 league clubs. But, as Leishman
remembers, when he took over Dunfermline, they were thirty-third out of
38. It took him a couple of seasons to get things the way he wanted, but
eventually the Fifers won promotion to the first division, and then on
to the premier division.
He maintains yet that the club would have stayed in the top league if
he had been able to continue his work, but the bitterness which
inevitably clouded his judgment for some time has been eroded to the
point where it is now virtually gone.
''I found it hurtful and strange that we had formed the most
successful Dunfermline team since the sixties, and yet I had to move.
But if I will always be a Dunfermline fan, the pain has eased now, and I
don't have time to bear grudges. It is all behind me now and you have to
get on with life.
''It will not affect me doing my best to make Meadowbank successful.''
He made a good start to that when his team beat league leaders
Dumbarton in his first game, but he is much to long in the tooth to see
that as particularly significant.''
He is not putting himself under any pressure, either, pointing out
that he doesn't believe he has anything to prove to anybody.
There is unquestionably a touch of the old passion apparent in the
Leishman personna as he discusses his re-emergence at Meadowbank. ''I
tell you this, I will be putting my heart and soul into this because I
feel really excited again.
''My problem before was that I kept saying to myself that it was not
the same away from Dunfermline, but I have come to terms with that. I am
sure the people at Dunfermline want to put it behind them,too, and we
both have to get on with our lives.''
Leishman intends in due course to get himself known in Livingston. The
good burghers can expect the hard sell when the old smoothie gets down
to to introducing the new team and the new gaffer to the new town. They
might make a great partnership.
For now though he wants to attend to the important business of getting
Meadowbank away from the relegation zone. Achieving that has to be his
first task.
Some things will never change, of course, as he demonstrated when I
tried to make contact with him to arrange our get-together. Eventually I
reached him on his mobile phone but it was only at the end of our
conversation that he explained he was sitting in the stand at Stark's
Park in the middle of a reserve match.
It is nice to have you with us again, Jim.

IT'S that time of year again, when a team becomes a crew and an eight
has nine members, who all go forward by facing backwards -- except the
cox of course.
At half past two today, the umpire's red flag will drop and the 141st
University Boat Race will be under way. This annual Oxbridge encounter
is rowing's major shop window and, with a world-wide television audience
that now measures in hundreds of millions, it maintains its unique
attraction.
Feelings about the Boat Race are split -- both within rowing and among
outsiders looking in for their annual bout of this baffling sport.
However, whether you like the event or not, it has a number of features
which mark it apart from most other sporting encounters.
First, it is gruelling. The four and a quarter miles of the Thames
between Putney and Mortlake are not for the faint-hearted, and the 16
oarsmen are among the fittest athletes in this or any other country.
To get some idea of how hard this race is, get your hands on a large
bag of potatoes and lift it from your toes to your chest. Now do that 36
times a minute for the next 18 minutes, standing on one foot to give you
an idea of how precarious the balance can be in one of these sleek
racing shells, and in perfect unison with another seven folk to give you
an impression of the precision a crew requires to be effective.
The winners will lift the Beefeater Trophy, while all the oarsmen will
be awarded ''Blues'' and will be invited to join the prestigious Leander
Club at Henley.
Another factor which marks this event apart nowadays is that the
performers are, by and large, world-class. Both of Britain's Olympic
Champion pairs had aboard former Oxford presidents in the shape of
Matthew Pinsent and Jonny Searle, and most years, the race is peppered
with World and Olympic medallists from a growing number of nations.
Last year's winning Cambridge crew was considered to be outstanding.
These are just some of the positive aspects of this great sporting
tradition, but, the event has its downside too, as anyone who has had
the misfortune to be caught among the crowds on their annual visit to
the various hostelries on the riverside can tell you.
The English loudmouth, along with his umpteenth pint of bitter, turns
out for this sporting event, just as he does for Twickers or Sunday
League cricket. However, that unfortunate side-effect cannot be blamed
on this event alone.
Like it or loathe it, the Boat Race has become an institution, as have
some of the jokes surrounding it, so it is fair to make a final comment
on another unique aspect of this race. The same two teams always reach
the final.

PERHAPS it is a sign of the times that the transfer market was stirred
rather than shaken last night, the final day before the deadline
excludes all signings from serious action for the rest of the season,
but in their own terms Kilmarnock made a remarkable intervention by
spending more money than they have ever done.
They set a club record when they paid #340,000 for Paul Wright, the St
Johnstone striker whose career has been at a standstill since he
recovered from a long-term injury. His finest days were with the current
Killie manager, Alex Totten, when he was in charge at Perth and, if the
two can gel again, his eye for goal could prove crucial to the Ayrshire
team as they bid to secure their place in the premier division.
The striker signed a three-year contract with the Ayrshire club and
Totten feels it is money well spent. ''I think Paul is a great player
and I took him from Hibs to St Johnstone when I was manager there. He
scored over 50 goals in a couple of seasons there in the premier
division. He is 27 with plenty of experience.''
The new man, who has started only six games this season, and scored
only once, was injured a year ago last January and did not make his
reappearance until October. He has much ground to make up, starting
against at Pittodrie today as Killie seek a fourth win this season over
Aberdeen.
Wright is a former Aberdeen player and also had a spell with Queen's
Park Rangers. His #340,000 fee makes him Kilmarnock's costliest buy,
although they did spend #530,000 on two Manchester United players, Colin
McKee and Neil Whitworth, last September.
The signing is bound to lift morale at the right time for Killie,
after their recent minor slump.
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken hopes to see his players receive a similar
lift, but from a different source -- the boost his international men
received from performances in Russia in midweek.
''But I have detected a change in the mood of our squad anyway.
Training has been stepped up, they have responded, and form has improved
along with their confidence,'' said Aitken.
''They know the time is right for them to put together the run which
can pull the club to safety.''
Falkirk will go about their own business against Hearts at Tynecastle
and then see if they have benefited from the Pittodrie scoreline. Their
new striker, Maurice Johnston, is not interested in revenge missions
against the team he left a few weeks ago -- ''there is no time for
that'' -- but does believe that the day's events could have immense
influence on who stays in the premier division.
''If we beat Hearts we would go above them and that would give an
enormous lift to a dressing room that is buzzing enough already,'' he
said. ''The spirit here is tremendous and I feel just the same as when I
first joined Hearts, that there is too much quality here to be
relegated.''
Hearts have some very doubtful starters, Brian Hamilton, John
Colquhoun, and Craig Levein.
Partick Thistle, like Kilmarnock, have been making a last-minute
signing, but not quite as spectacular. They have brought striker Roger
Eli, formerly of Burnley, who has just returned from China, to Firhill
on a month-to-month basis. The new man will turn out against Hibs at
Firhill, and Alex Taylor is also in line to return.
Hibs could be without Scotland striker Darren Jackson and Pat
McGinlay, but Gareth Evans and Kevin McAllister are fit again.
Incidentally, their former Dundee United defender, David Beaumont, has
retired in order to join the police.

GAVIN Hastings, the Scottish rugby captain, has called on ITV to
relent over its decision not to show one of Scotland's crucial World Cup
first-round matches live, and last night it appeared that his appeal
might not go unheeded.
ITV, which is spending more than #8m on Rugby World Cup coverage from
South Africa, has snubbed Scotland fans by deciding to show only
recorded highlights of the game against Tonga on Tuesday, May 30.
All of the other first-round matches involving the home unions,
including Scotland's other two pool matches against France and Ivory
Coast, will be beamed live from South Africa but, according to ITV, the
game against the Tongans, with a 7pm kick-off, could not be shown live
because of scheduling difficulties.
However, the following evening, when Wales play New Zealand in a game
with the same kick-off time, even the top-rated soap opera Coronation
Street has been moved to allow uninterrupted coverage.
Hastings declared: ''I'm very disappointed. The public are clamouring
to watch Scotland after the way they have played this year. There will
be a lot of disappointed people if the game against Tonga is not shown
live.
Hastings, who led the Scottish side to a Grand Slam showdown with
England a fortnight ago, added: ''I sincerely hope that the Scottish
television companies will do everything in their power to show the
game.''
Yesterday, it appeared that, even if the match is not broadcast live
throughout the UK, Scottish rugby followers need not necessarily miss
out.
A spokeswoman for the ITV network in London said that Scottish viewers
would not see the Tonga game live because of week-day scheduling
problems. ''We are showing the Wales v New Zealand game live but that is
on a Wednesday night which is traditionally an occasional sports night
for us. It's a pity, but that's just how it is.''
However, Scottish, Grampian, and Border are holding talks this weekend
which could result in live transmission.
A spokesman for Scottish said: ''The position is that the World Cup
broadcast schedule, as issued, came from the ITV network. They are not
showing live coverage of that game.
''However, we do not need to stick to the schedule and are looking at
how we could cover the game live. We will probably make an announcement
next week. We are keen to cover the match even if it means re-arranging
our own schedule.
''We have done this in the past with the Champions' League in
football. We have shown games live when they were not shown by the
network.''
A Grampian spokesman added: ''The situation is that this is a matter
for internal discussion between ourselves, the ITV network centre, and
Scottish. We would expect to be able to make an announcement in a couple
of days.''
A spokesman at Carlisle-based Border, which broadcasts on both sides
of the Border and, in particular, into the heartland of Scotland's rugby
country, said: ''We are discussing this with Scottish and Grampian. The
Scotland v Tonga game is not scheduled to be covered live but it
obviously is a match that we would want to cover, and we will do so if
it is at all possible.''
ITV, which outbid the opposition to screen the World Cup in the UK, as
they did in 1991, will show 65 hours of rugby from the tournament which
runs from May 25 to June 24. Worldwide, the tournament is expected to
draw a television audience of 2.5 billion viewers in 120 countries.
The tournament, involving the world's top 16 teams, is expected to
make a profit of some #20m.

THE 26-strong Scotland party for the World Cup is due to be selected
on Tuesday, with an announcement on Thursday, but a major injury worry
still surrounds the Gala centre, Gregor Townsend.
He had to retire hurt during Gala's Border derby encounter with Hawick
at Mansfield Park last weekend. Townsend has been seen by a
physiotherapist and the injury has, apparently, been diagnosed as
over-extension of the cruciate ligament in the left knee.
The player saw Scottish Rugby Union medical advisers last night and
they will report to team manager Duncan Paterson, who said that he
expected to make an announcement today.
Last night, Townsend said: ''They are still not sure just how bad it
is. I have to go for a scan on the knee in Edinburgh at the beginning of
the week, and we will know more then.''
With World Cup selection only three days away, and the Murrayfield
match against Romania on April 22, the injury to the influential
Townsend is a worry the Scotland management could have done without.
The pre-selection World Cup squad is training at Perth this weekend.
There will be public sessions at the North Inch this morning from 10.30
to noon and tomorrow from 10.30-11.30. The management have invited
members of the public to meet the players in the nearby Gannochy Trust
restaurant at the end of the sessions.
* SCOTLAND Under-19 play their English counterparts at Bridgehaugh,
Stirling, today in a warm-up game for the Scottish youngsters' first
appearance in the FIRA tournament in Bucharest.
The tournament, which takes place from April 10-16, has drawn 26
entries from three continents, and Scotland are in the 12-team top end
of the tournament along with South Africa, Spain, Poland, Italy,
Uruguay, Portugal, France, Wales, Romania, Argentina and Russia, the
latter two nations appearing in the Scotland pool.
* DRAW for the Gala seven-a-side tournament which takes place at
Netherdale today (first tie 2pm):
Boroughmuir v Watsonians; Stewart's-Melville v Hawick; Currie v GHK;
Selkirk v Gala; Kirkcaldy v Kelso; Peebles v Jed-Forest; Melrose v
Langholm; Heriot's FP v Stirling County.
* THE Scottish Rugby Union has announced that Murrayfield debenture
holders will not be disadvantaged as a result of its decision to allow
free entry to under 16-year-olds accompanied by an adult for the match
against Romania on April 22.
SRU secretary Bill Hogg said: ''Any debenture holder who has bought
tickets for the game, including one or more for a youngster under 16,
can get in touch with us and we will provide a refund for the
children.''

of trouble. Alex Evans, Australia's assistant coach between 1984 and
1988 and currently guiding Cardiff's Heineken League title bid, has been
appointed coach by the Five Nations wooden spoonists for this summer's
World Cup in South Africa.
His assistants will be Swansea's Mike Ruddock and Pontypridd's Dennis

BEWARE the House of Shaws. Robert Louis Stevenson's famous line will
be a major part -- obviously he did not know it at the time -- in
today's promotion battle at East End Park between Dunfermline and
leaders Dundee. As in all good dramas, there are the major players.
Taking a bow in front of his new home support is Greg Shaw, signed in
a #50,000 deal from Falkirk. The former Ayr striker, though, has not
exactly been hitting it off in the premier division this season. In
fairness, a struggle to maintain a place in the top squad may have had
something to do with his failure to find the net.
Dundee fans, however, will travel in numbers to support their local
hero, George Shaw, who has a total of 16 goals so far. And after his
double against Airdrie at Broadwood last week, the Fifers literally had
better beware.
Dunfermline have Guido van de Kamp back, Ivo den Biemen hopeful after
having the stitches taken out of an ankle wound, but Neale Cooper,
Hamish French and Kenny Ward are all missing. Manager Bert Paton,
however, puts on the bold front with the statement that ''Jackie
McNamara is back from Russia safe and well, and raring to go.'' Mr
McNamara, after all, has picked up many man-of-the-match awards this
season.
Dundee's Jim Duffy also has central defenders Noel Blake and Kevin
Bain available again, which may keep the player-manager on the
sidelines. After his recent displays, if you believe that, you'll
believe anything.
Elsewhere, there's games but not a lot of fun in store as everyone
fights for points. Say it quietly, but Airdrie -- in the middle of a
form slump -- entertain (possibly the wrong word) Stranraer at
Broadwood. Remember 8-1, colours of red and yellow and all that jazz on
December 3?
Airdrie have Kenny Black, Alan Lawrence and Andy Smith doubtful -- a
mere bagatelle compared to bottom club Stranraer, who have five
suspended, two injured, and defender Jim McCann unable to get time off
work.
Clydebank have put the ''business as usual signs'' back up after a
traumatic past 10 days. They, quite thankfully, have an away fixture at
McDiarmid Park against a St Johnstone side still aiming for at least
second place and a play-off spot for premier division football.
St Mirren, fighting hard to climb out of the relegation area, hope to
overcome the pride of Hamilton, and Ayr United could cause more than a

HAD it come a month ago, the Jarlaw Aberdeenshire Cup final would have
promised to be a mouthwatering affair between the two dominant clubs in
the Highlands.
Yet, in the past couple of weeks the stuffing has been knocked out of
Cove Rangers' season by two successive league defeats while Huntly have
continued their relentless march towards a second consecutive treble.
As a result, today's final looks likely to confirm Huntly's domination
of North football and have their followers celebrating again.
The final, at Keith, does offer Cove a last chance to put one over on
Huntly, however, and the champions' manager, Steve Paterson, knows
better than to take anything for granted, especially in cup finals.
Winger Steve Gray is available again for the cup holders although Dave
Mone is out, while Cove's Mark Murphy is unlikely to be fit.
But defender Dave Morland, who signed for Huntly last month from Cove,
will sit the game out after the clubs came to a gentlemen's agreement
that he would not play in the final.
In the Highland League, crisis club Nairn County could play their last
ever game as they finish their season at home to Fraserburgh.
County's #60,000 debt casts a doubt over their survival although
rescue talks are set to continue in the close season with Inverness and
Nairn Enterprise and the local district council.

DUTCHMEN could hog the spotlight at Hampden this afternoon when Celtic
play hosts to Motherwell in a match that could have major significance
in the chase after the UEFA Cup place which will go with second spot in
the premier division.
Pierre van Hooydonk, who has already made a considerable impact in the
Celtic front-line, will be in direct opposition to one of his
countrymen, Mitchel van der Gaag, who makes his debut for the
Lanarkshire club.
The tussle between the two tall men from Holland promises to be
fascinating as well as informative, because Motherwell manager Alex
McLeish said yesterday that first and foremost he expects his new man,
signed from PS Eindhoven for #400,000, to defend efficiently,
particularly in the air.
Like most Dutch players, van der Gaag is more than just capable on the
ground, but unlike many of his countrymen, he is reputedly well suited
to the less subtle, aerial football that sometimes prevails in the top
league in this country.
''We didn't defend well in the air against Hibs in our last match,
when we lost,'' said McLeish, ''and I will be looking to Mitchel to
improve on that.''
The Motherwell manager is aware that the four-point lead his team
holds over Celtic is an enormously important cushion as the teams enter
the last stages of the season, but he makes the valid point, too, that
Motherwell have only one avenue towards Europe, via the league
positions, while Celtic are still in the running on two counts -- the
league and the Scottish Cup, in which they meet Hibs in the semi-final
next week.
Motherwell, who have not lost to Celtic so far, drawing twice and
winning once, will probably have former Celtic striker Tommy Coyne in
from the start after his recovery from injury, while defender Rob
McKinnon looks close to returning, too.
Celtic, who have won their last three games, expect captain Paul
McStay, who suffered a slight groin strain in the international in
midweek, to be fit, but Brian O'Neil is still suspended. Rudi Vata, who
did well in his first game of the season for the side last week, has
returned from international duty with Albania in good health and looks
sure to retain his place at right back.
''We could do ourselves a big favour if we close the gap on
Motherwell, but we will have to play better than we have done against
them this season,'' said manager Tommy Burns. ''If we can continue the
recent consistent form, the fans will get behind us again and we could
keep this going until the end of the season.''
Burns, who hopes to finalise new contracts for a number of players
next week -- ''I don't think any of them want to leave Celtic. They know
if they are successful here there is no better club in the world to play
for'' -- has a high regard for the passing abilities of Motherwell, but
also believes his own side can prove themselves even better at that art.
Rangers will have Charlie Miller, who did well for the Under-21s in
Moscow in midweek, back after suspension for their visit to Tannadice,
where Dundee United's new manager, Billy Kirkwood, will find himself
taking on his bosses of a few days ago, Walter Smith and Archie Knox.
''I don't think Billy's knowledge of our players will have too much
advantage,'' said Smith, ''because we have had to chop and change so
much I am not sure myself what team will be out.''
There will be fitness tests for Ian Ferguson and Trevor Steven, but
both look doubtful starters, while Craig Moore is still suspended. In
the squad again is Alexei Mikhailichenko, who is just about beginning
his season after a lengthy spell off with injury, but he is more likley
to be on the bench.
Smith insists that complacency has not been a factor in recent
indifferent results, rather the lack of consistency that goes with team
changes, ''but we have made errors that have contributed to that as
well.''
United's new leader, Kirkwood, may bring back Andy McLaren, who has
been in the doldrums since he was put on the transfer list by Ivan Golac
after various breaches of club discipline. Said Kirkwood: ''What
happened here in the past had nothing to do with me. I have always rated
Andy as a good player and he is in my first squad. I said when I was
appointed that everyone would have the chance of a fresh start.''
The man who was part of the great days of the eighties wants to take
United on the road back to that status, but first has more immediate
problems. ''Right now the challenge is to stay in the premier division,
and although I might make additions to the squad, I do believe we have
enough good players to achieve the immediate aim.
''I want them to go out positively against Rangers.''

PLAYING golf on an empty stomach and in heat wave conditions cost
Scotland's Gordon Gray vital strokes in the second round of the Windsor
Senior Masters in Nairobi, Kenya.
Gray overcame a fainting feeling with an on-course sandwich and then
birdied three of his last seven holes for a 70. His 36-hole total of 141
leaves him just five strokes behind leader Antonio Garrido.
''I birdied two of the first six holes and then came over very
faint,'' said Gray. ''My hands were shaking, I was in a bit of a daze
and dropped three shots in the next five holes.
''I ate a sandwich, which made me feel a lot better.'' Leading
aggregates (british and Irish unless otherwise stated):
136 -- A Garrido (Spain) 68, 68.

JIM Leishman, Alex Smith, Terry Christie, Bobby Wilson and Jimmy Bone
all were managers with clubs in the old second division nine years ago,
when Dunfermline and Queen of the South won promotion. All now are with
different clubs, but the musical chairs process of managerial changes
has a habit of bringing about regular reunions.
Only Wilson, currently in charge of third division promotion
candidates Ross County, and Leishman, now manager of relegation-haunted
Meadowbank, would be happy if all five met up in the second division
next season. Meanwhile Leishman, in charge of Christie's old club, comes
face to face with Smith, whose Clyde team need every point to keep alive
the hope of first division football next term.
With the exception of a fixture against the apparently doomed Brechin
City, Meadowbank's closing programme is such that they will have a big
say about which two clubs escape upwards from the division. But Leishman
has his own priority -- survival, with five points to be gained on Queen
of the South if his club are to avoid relegation prior to their move to
Livingston.
Dumbarton must be expected to take three points at home to Brechin,
and manager Murdo MacLeod would not break his heart if nearest pursuers
Stenhousemuir and Morton were to share the points at Ochilview, which
would extend the Sons' lead to four points.
Stenhousemuir ended a short but disturbing winless sequence last week,
when they easily beat Brechin 3-0 and that will have restored their
morale. Morton have Alan Mahood back in midfield, but full back Derek
Collins is doubtful and Mark Pickering stands by.
Morton manager Allan McGraw believes that those teams who are only on
the fringe of the promotion race are beginning to run out of games. That
is the situation for East Fife and Berwick, who meet at Methil, and for
Stirling Albion, who visit Queen of the South.
Forfar seem set for the third division title and today visit Albion
Rovers. Ross County are in third place and must hope to account for
Queen's Park at Dingwall, while hoping that Caley Thistle can do them a
favour by taking something from their visit to second placed East
Stirlingshire.
Alloa must beat Cowdenbeath to stay in the hunt, while John Borgan's
Arbroath go for an eighth straight win away to Angus rivals Montrose, a
team they have beaten already during their recent revival.

GERMANY'S hopes of a comfortable passage into the Davis Cup
semi-finals were jolted by a shock defeat for Boris Becker in the first
singles tie of their quarter-final against Holland in Utrecht yesterday.
But Michael Stich levelled the tie by beating Richard Krajicek.
Dutchman Paul Haarhuis, ranked 30 places lower than world No.3 Becker,
lost the first set before winning by 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).
Becker, troubled by an ankle and shoulder injuries, edged the opening
set. Haarhuis then moved up a gear and, with the German sending down a
total of 16 double faults, he secured victory after a fourth-set
tie-break.
Stich then beat Krajicek 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.
World No.2 Andre Agassi gave the United States a winning start in
Palermo, Sicily, when he beat Andrea Gaudenzi, Italy's top player, 6-4,
6-4, 6-1, and took his Cup singles record to 21 wins in 25 matches. The
weather forced postponement of the tie between world No.1 Pete Sampras
and Renzo Furlan until today.
Magnus Larsson, Sweden's new No.1, brushed aside Austrian Thomas
Muster 6-1, 7-6, 7-5 to give the Cup holders the perfect start in Vaxjo.
Stefan Edberg duly made it 2-0 by beating Alex Antonitsch 6-4, 3-6, 6-3,
6-4.
South African Wayne Ferreira came from behind to beat Alexander Volkov
and level their tie against Russia in Moscow at 1-1.
World No.11 Ferreira recovered from 2-1 down to win 7-6, 4-6, 6-7,
6-2, 6-4, after Russian No.1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov had disposed of South
African Marcus Ondruska 6-1, 6-4, 6-4.

MAJOR League players were ready to go back to work after a federal
judge's favourable ruling yesterday, but the status of the regular
season -- due to start tomorrow -- was unclear as owners pondered their
next move.
US District Judge Sonia Sotomayer issued an injunction against team
owners forcing them to restore salary arbitration and competitive
bidding for free agents -- provisions owners had unilaterally eliminated
before an impasse was reached.
The players' union said it would direct its striking members to return
to work as a result of the injunction and continue bargaining for a new
contract.
But the owners may not welcome them back. Votes from 21 of the 28
teams could impose a lockout rather than face a return to the old rules.

THE president of UEFA said yesterday he fully supported a joint bid by
Belgium and Holland to host the finals of the European Championship in
the year 2000.
Lennart Johansson told a news conference after the executive committee
meeting in Moscow that an announcement would be made at the next meeting
in July. There are no other formal bidders.
Johansson also said UEFA had decided that, starting this season, the
Super Cup between winners of the European Cup-winners' Cup and the
Champions' League will consist of one game instead of two.

Louisiana,
THE last scheduled tee-time in yesterday's second round of the New
Orleans Classic was an optimistic 5.39pm, possibly the lastest scheduled
tee-time ever in tournament golf.
First-round leader J L Lewis finished in almost total darkness on
Thursday at about 6.30pm. Play was called in for darkness at 6pm last
night, and again Lewis was on the last hole, finishing in darkness.
With half the field stranded in mid-round, the lead was held by
Canadian Dave Barr, who had a 68 for a nine-under-par total, one shot
ahead of Lewis, who followed his 64 with a 72.
The plan was to finish the second round this morning, and play 18
holes tomorrow.
Four of the five Europeans were able to complete the second round, but
Sandy Lyle, who had opened well with a 69, had to stop after six holes
last night, having birdied the fifth to get to four under par.
David Feherty, who began the second round so well, with birdies on the
first three holes, ended up with a one-over 73 -- and even his
one-under-par total will deny him a chance to play tomorrow for the
title and an invitation to the Masters.
Jesper Parnevik also started well -- he birdied two of his first three
holes -- and he held it together for a 67 and 138. One stroke behind is
Ian Woosnam, who won here in 1991 before he picked up his first green
jacket that year. His 69 put him at five under par, four behind Barr.
Second-round scores (US players unless noted):
135 -- D Barr (Canada) 67, 68.
136 -- J L Lewis 64, 72.
137 -- D Love III 68, 69; S Verplank 70, 67; M Heinen 66, 71.
138 -- J Parnevik (Sweden) 71, 67; J Maggert 72, 66; S Jones 69, 69; D
Waldorf 70, 68; K Gibson 70, 68; M Wurtz 68, 70.
139 -- I Woosnam (Wales) 70, 69; B Bryant 65, 74; M Bradley 68, 71; D
Reese 69, 70.
140 -- C Parry (Aus) 71, 69; D Martin 69, 71; K Cotner 71, 69.
141 -- F Couples 73, 68; G Kraft 70, 71; C DiMarco 70, 71; R Black 66,
75; B Doolittle 71, 70.
Others included: 143 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 70, 73. 144 -- J-M
Olazabal (Spain) 73, 71.

DOUG GILLON finds that Scot Frank Dick is firmly in the driving seat
OLD perceptions die hard. ''That,'' said Frank Dick, ''must be the
first time a car has failed a dope test.''
Dick, the former UK director of athletics coaching, but now, among
other things, fitness adviser to Formula 1 driver Gerhard Berger, had
just learned how Berger had won the Brazilian Grand Prix -- promoted to
winner at Interlagos, where the cars of Michael Schumacher and David
Coulthard were disqualified for having used illegal fuel.
As Berger waits in the Caribbean to see whether his victory will
survive an appeal by the original leaders, he is maintaining the
rigorous programme devised by the one-time Edinburgh schoolboy and
Scottish national coach.
Dick, who has managed Berger's fitness programme for four years,
believes it is outrageous to suggest drivers are wheeler-dealing with
their weights in order to steal an edge.
That stigma has this week been laid upon Schumacher and Berger -- with
official statistics being cited to back claims that Germany's Schumacher
gained 18lb and the Austrian a stone since last season, and that they
then lost most of it in order to exploit new regulations governing the
all-up weight of car and driver.
''I believe there has been an error,'' says Dick. ''Berger's weight
has not varied by more than two kilos (4[1/2]lb) in the past four years.
I could suggest that dehydration was a factor. That would be true in
many grands prix. The temperature in the cockpit can top 105 degrees.
Suited up in asbestos and all that kit, you can easily lose four to six
pounds in a race. But in Sao Paulo last weekend, it was unusually cool.
''Gerhard plays hard, that's true. But his idea of fun is
cross-country skiing at altitude in St Moritz. It is brutal work.
Afterwards he is into the gym for two hours at a stretch. He also does a
lot of speed and anaerobic work.
''Once you are behind the wheel the heart-rate does not drop below 180
per minute (72 for the average adult) for some two hours.
''When Jim Clark was driving, it was a very physical job. But it
became less so with the advances in technology. Now, however, it has
gone full circle. The new regulations have made the cars lighter, harder
to control and fitness is again at a premium.
''Somebody undergoing physical exertion could not tolerate 180 per
minute for two hours. With racing drivers that is tension and
stress-induced. But they have sudden physical bursts when extra oxygen
is required in the arms and shoulders.
''The heart-rate goes over 200 -- that's like the last stage of an
Olympic 400 metres or the end of the Boat Race.
''At that level it is hard to find extra oxygen. But drivers have to
be fit enough to make that marginal improvement. We are not talking
about the margin between being first or second, but between being alive
or dead.''
Berger, however, seems unaffected by the pressures. ''He's not your
uniform, straight-down-the-track guy,'' says Dick. ''He likes to do
crazy things. His rivals have to watch him even as closely off the
circuit as on it, for he is an accomplished practical joker.
''He took me skiing one day after a training session. We went up this
mountain and got off at the top station. There I was, standing with the
world beneath me, dressed in a purple ski suit with gold and brown
stripes down the sleeves.
''The descent was unbelievable. I just looked at it. He had promised I
would be able to get down, but I hadn't a prayer. 'Remember how bad you
made me feel this morning? Well, now it's your turn.'
''Then he took off and left me. I had to wait until his girlfriend,
Anna, came to rescue me.''

THREE pipe bands want to help speed the Scottish team at the World
Mountain Racing Cup this year, but Scotland's team-manager, Jim Darby,
wants more.
''I don't want 100 pipers -- I want 1000,'' he says. ''I want to line
the route with pipers, and set the runners' feet on fire. I reckon the
music will be worth half a minute to our athletes.''
The first world athletics event to be staged in Scotland since 1978,
is scheduled for Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh, on September 9.
The championships have been underwritten to #40,000, but as yet have
no title sponsor, despite encouraging noises about the possibility of TV
coverage. ''A prospective backer could probably get the event for
#15,000,'' adds Darby. ''The financial situation means the pipers will
have to be voluntary, and I'd like some advice on the music. Flower of
Scotland will be great before the off -- but its too slow to run to.''
Less than a fornight after the invitations had gone out, the 16
acceptors include Kenya, who won the world cross-country title last
weekend. Also included are South Africa, who will be competing for the
first time, USA, New Zealand, Germany, France, Italy, and Slovenia.
As big an attraction as the race is a post-race athletes' ceilidh.
''We want to dance them into the floor, and send them home with a
hangover to remember,'' says Darby.
A word of advice, Jim? Give everyone else a chance. Hold a ceilidh for
the Kenyans the night before the race.

IT'S that time of year again, when a team becomes a crew and an eight
has nine members, who all go forward by facing backwards -- except the
cox of course.
At half past two today, the umpire's red flag will drop and the 141st
University Boat Race will be under way. This annual Oxbridge encounter
is rowing's major shop window and, with a world-wide television audience
that now measures in hundreds of millions, it maintains its unique
attraction.
Feelings about the Boat Race are split -- both within rowing and among
outsiders looking in for their annual bout of this baffling sport.
However, whether you like the event or not, it has a number of features
which mark it apart from most other sporting encounters.
First, it is gruelling. The four and a quarter miles of the Thames
between Putney and Mortlake are not for the faint-hearted, and the 16
oarsmen are among the fittest athletes in this or any other country.
To get some idea of how hard this race is, get your hands on a large
bag of potatoes and lift it from your toes to your chest. Now do that 36
times a minute for the next 18 minutes, standing on one foot to give you
an idea of how precarious the balance can be in one of these sleek
racing shells, and in perfect unison with another seven folk to give you
an impression of the precision a crew requires to be effective.
The winners will lift the Beefeater Trophy, while all the oarsmen will
be awarded ''Blues'' and will be invited to join the prestigious Leander
Club at Henley.
Another factor which marks this event apart nowadays is that the
performers are, by and large, world-class. Both of Britain's Olympic
Champion pairs had aboard former Oxford presidents in the shape of
Matthew Pinsent and Jonny Searle, and most years, the race is peppered
with World and Olympic medallists from a growing number of nations.
Last year's winning Cambridge crew was considered to be outstanding.
These are just some of the positive aspects of this great sporting
tradition, but, the event has its downside too, as anyone who has had
the misfortune to be caught among the crowds on their annual visit to
the various hostelries on the riverside can tell you.
The English loudmouth, along with his umpteenth pint of bitter, turns
out for this sporting event, just as he does for Twickers or Sunday
League cricket. However, that unfortunate side-effect cannot be blamed
on this event alone.
Like it or loathe it, the Boat Race has become an institution, as have
some of the jokes surrounding it, so it is fair to make a final comment
on another unique aspect of this race. The same two teams always reach
the final.

THE hunt for Diego Maradona resumed again yesterday when the
Argentinian fled in a pick-up truck before dawn from the Buenos Aires
hotel where he had been besieged by reporters, and there was further bad
news for the former internationalist, who first disappeared last Sunday,
when his analyst announced he was suing him.
''I'm going to start a law suit (for fees) almost as the last step in
his treatment, because Diego doesn't realise what others do for him,''
said Ruben Navedo.
Maradona was discovered at the hotel on Thursday after a four-day
search which inspired a variety of theories accounting for his
disappearance, ranging from a row with his wife, Claudia, to his
undergoing treatment in a drugs clinic.
The former Argentina captain is still serving a 15-month suspension
for taking banned substances at last year's World Cup. He is also
awaiting sentencing for wounding two reporters with an air rifle outside
his home a year ago.
* PAUL Gascoigne has been given the go-ahead from doctors to make his
comeback next week -- but not from his club.
The England midfielder has lost more than 3st in his fight for fitness
after having broken his right leg a year ago, but Lazio insist they will
not be hurried into picking him.
Coach Zdenek Zeman said: ''I'm not going to put him into a game just
to keep people happy. Gascoigne will play when I feel he's capable of
giving something to the team.''

There are many little-known delights around the Tay, not the least of
which offers Julie Davidson a little bit of luxury
BLIZZARDS and avalanches have been keeping fair-weather walkers like
me off the hills this spring. The other weekend we considered Ben
Vrackie, that pointy peak above Pitlochry, but there was snow down to
2000 feet and, without crampons, the path looked tricky.
So we looked at the map and settled for lower levels on the moorland
plateau east of the A9, where the Forest of Clunie was long since
nibbled to death and there are fine views up the Tay Valley and a
secretive pond, Loch Ordie, to give an outing a focus.
We could have walked forever on the old drove road where Queen
Victoria got stuck in the snow on a crossing from Deeside to Dunkeld.
But four hours felt right for our winter-soft muscles and we had another
piece of Perthshire to explore.
If you stick to the main roads north of Perth you lose the Tay where
it takes a great loop between the A9 and the A93 -- and you lose it at a
point where it reaches its most handsome and useful pre-estuarial
maturity. Here, besides watering farmland and harbouring salmon, the Tay
once powered the mills of Stanley, which has since become a commuter
village for Perth. Fair City folk and serious fishers know the district
well, but otherwise this comely wedge of countryside gathered into the
Tay's crook is an overlooked corner of Scotland.
Ballathie House Hotel, however, aims to put it on the map. Owned by
two local families, managed by ambitious professionals, the hotel has
been transforming its status from ''fishing'' (code for shabby comfort)
to ''country house'' (code for luxury). Last year it earned itself the
title of Country House Hotel of the Year in The Macallan Taste of
Scotland awards.
Unlike many other Victorian piles which get made over by the
homogenous imagination of the interior designer, Ballathie has retained
the best of its antiquities; our bathroom had a basin stand of solid
pink marble, a colossal bath with taps like twin cannon, and a window
overlooking the river, where snow and dusk fell on the fanaticism of
four fishers in a skiff.
There are also some new treasures. Chief among them is Chef Kevin
McGillivray, who trained with Scotland's masters and now produces his
own award-winning menus. Kevin comes from Inverness and when he was a
lad he was so keen to learn to cook he skivvied unpaid in the kitchens
of the Station Hotel, ''when it was still a British Transport hotel''.
Those of us with long memories know the logo BTH guaranteed certain
standards, but one by one the railway hotels were picked off like the
railway lines. In the grounds -- nay, the 1500-acre estate -- of
Ballathie we found another relic of times past: a section of the old
main line between Glasgow and Aberdeen, which was dismantled when BR
rerouted trains from Perth through Dundee.
There was more to see than the remnant of linear molehill; there was a
mighty, ironclad bridge stepping over the Tay on red sandstone piles.
''Warning,'' said a notice. ''Do not trespass on the railway. Penalty
#25.'' As there was no railway on which to trespass we were not
intimidated, and walked above the ample river where once the trains
roared.
Until then I had thought myself new to this neck of Perthshire. In
fact, as a young woman I must have rattled through it many times,
glimpsing the French baronial turrets of Ballathie above the trees,
wondering who lived there. These days (for a price) we can all be the
Folk at the Big House, rates inclusive of four-course dinner and full
Scottish breakfast.

* WHY did no-one think of it before? ''Perhaps they did,'' says
Stephen Wilson, the sales and marketing director, ''but it needs an
advanced level of computer technology to do it properly, and that's
something which has come along fairly recently.''
All credit, then, to London Hotels -- Discounted Reservations for
being first off the mark. This consumer-friendly new business is the
catering equivalent of the air-fare bucket shop. It acts as a clearing
house for hotel beds in London, sparing the diffident British traveller
the embarrassment of negotiating reductions on the rack rate.
You can't choose your hotel but you can choose your district -- west
London, central London or the City -- and you can choose your category,
from budget to four-star where prices, exclusive of VAT, range from #15
to #42 for single occupancy.
All accommodation outside the B &amp; B range includes private bathroom,
and advance reservations can be made up to 30 days ahead, at short
notice or even on the day of arrival, if there's availability.
Rooms can be booked through independent travel agents or by calling
London Hotels on 0171 454 5000. Stephen Wilson says he hopes their
operation will spread to other British cities ''now that the
technology's in place''.
* SMALL local enterprises often get overlooked in these pages, but
word of an enticing new holiday option for amateur artists has reached
us from Skye. I quote: ''We have a spacious studio with such wonderful
views over the Sound of Sleat to the mainland hills of Knoydart and
Morar that you may hardly wish to leave it. But outside, our land goes
down over undulating croftland past old ruined houses and through
woodland to a fascinating broken shore.'' Skyescape Painting Holidays is
the team venture of Ardvasar residents Veronica and Charles Barrington
and artist and art teacher Flora Strachan. Their base is the
Barringtons' characterful home Newton, which already has a reputation as
one of Skye's most attractive bed-and-breakfast billets. I can
personally vouch for the quality of Veronica's warm welcome and creative
cooking.
The first of their weekly or fortnightly courses is launched this
month (April), and it's their ambitious intention to keep their season
running until November. After all, the visual drama of the Skye autumn
is not to be missed, and for non-painting visitors (or those suffering
from brush fatigue) Charles Barrington is organising historic tours on
both the island and the mainland.
Rates per person per week are #102 for the course, which includes
tuition, studio, and equipment, and #108 for B &amp; B at Newton, with the
optional extra of dinner for #85. If the Barringtons can't fit you in
they can recommend neighbourhood accommodation across the price
spectrum. Non-starving artists should bear in mind that the
Armadale/Ardvasar area is the home patch of The Herald's very own Lady
Claire Macdonald, chatelaine of Kinloch Lodge Hotel.

BASINGSTOKE Beavers' Bill Morrison is British championship-chasing
Edinburgh Racers' biggest play-off fear. Morrison visits Edinburgh
tomorrow with the Beavers and Racers tried to sign the Canadian
goaltender last season but were blocked by import restrictions.
Racers' coach Jock Hay said: ''Bill's a great goalie and he's been a
real pain to us all season. We're hoping he's not hot on Sunday as he
can be a difficult man to beat.''
Racers jet back into Edinburgh just before face-off after an overnight
stay in Cardiff where they clash with defending champions Devils
tonight.
The Scots have been whitewashed by Devils this term in the league and
Hay said: ''There's no better time to post our first win.''
Elsewhere, Fife Flyers face-off against newly crowned premier division
champions Sheffield Steelers tonight at Kirkcaldy. Steelers will give
late fitness tests to former Flyer Les Millie and Steve Nemeth.
Tomorrow the Kirkcaldy club travel to long-time league pace-setters
Nottingham Panthers.
Paisley Pirates are desperate to get their promotion campaign back on
track by stinging Bracknell Bees in England tonight.

Everyone travels to Jerusalem full of expectation, but disappointment
can be avoided if you come prepared for a shock, as R D Kernohan
explains
JERUSALEM is a city of great expectations. Whatever our personal faith
or lack of it, we're conditioned to think of it as a holy city. We
encounter it in Blake and Bach as well as the Bible. Every guidebook
dwells on its holiness to three religions. Hints to modern travellers
also take account of its sensitivity in the politics of Zionism and Arab
nationalism.
It's the city of Calvary and of the Temple, whose Western or
''Wailing'' Wall remains a symbol for its ancient people.
Its most modern and poignant holy place is the Yad Vashem memorial to
the murdered dead of Hitler's Holocaust. Its finest single human
achievement is the Dome of the Rock mosque on the Temple Mount, and the
city's Arabic name of El Kuds speaks of its holiness.
But wrong expectations can make Jerusalem a city of disappointments.
Western visitors will best avoid disappointment if they come prepared to
encounter culture shocks, and ready to find tensions within themselves
as well as around them.
The most pro-Zionist Christians may still feel ill at ease adjusting
to being a minority among Jews. The most ecumenical Christians can be
startled when the Church's great cultural divide seems to be between
West and East -- not Protestant and Roman Catholic.
Until this century the main shock to Western pilgrim-tourists came
from dirt, squalor, and the contrast between exalted notions of Zion and
the lowly state of a minor provincial town in a backward Turkish
province. For so Jerusalem was for centuries, until Scots Territorials,
the true ''flower of Scotland'', won a bitter and decisive battle in
1917 for the dominating Judean heights of Nebi Samwil.
Most visitors reacted like the great Scots missionary ''enquirers'' of
1839, Andrew Bonar and Robert Murray McCheyne. As they rode in by the
Jaffa Gate they looked at dark walls, slippery streets, and a poor
ill-clad population, and asked, echoing one of Jeremiah's lamentations:
''Is this the city which men call the perfection of beauty, the joy of
the whole earth?''
But Bonar and McCheyne were inspired by evangelical fervour,
unfulfilled hopes of drawing the Jews into a Hebrew Church, and a
prophetic insight that even this decayed Jerusalem remained the centre
of the Jewish world and would grow great again ''in the latter day''.
Despite its sprawling suburbs, the revived modern Jerusalem is a
clean, stately stone-built city, thanks to the pattern established by
conservationist city-planning policies of the much-abused British
mandate.
But, even when its stones glow against the dark mountain backdrop of
Moab across the Jordan, it can never be dazzlingly beautiful in the
manner of Cape Town or San Francisco.
What makes Jerusalem matter is not the way it looks, but what happened
there. Even those who cannot define that in religious terms will not
avoid the intensity of feelings and experience associated with its
history.
Unfortunately there is still culture-shock for many Christians,
especially but not only Western Protestants, in the ''holy places''.
Some are ugly. Some are bogus. Some are tawdry. It is most intense at
the traditional site of the holiest of all places, where Jesus was
crucified and, not far away, there was a newly-prepared tomb found empty
on Easter morning.
Victorian pilgrim travel-literature is rich in denunciation of the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the way its quarrelsome sects shared
custody of that suite of ill-assorted buildings. Bonar and McCheyne
recorded ''only painful and revolting'' impressions.
In today's ecumenical climate visitors' misgivings and local rivalries
are more muted. Recent reports from Jerusalem warn pilgrims to expect
much scaffolding in the years ahead, as agreement has been reached on
long-delayed repairs. Tour-leaders go out of their way to warn their
pilgrims what to expect in the way of rattling money-boxes, gaudy
trappings, and a startling contrast from anyone's impression of a
''green hill far away'' beyond the city wall.
The party line is to ''look for the holy things behind the holy
places'' and emphasise that concepts of artistic taste and even decorous
behaviour are rather subjective anyway. In other words, be prepared for
anything from very mixed feelings to acute disappointment.
And is it Calvary anyway? The argument in favour is that the tradition
of the site goes back to the early Christian centuries and that the
destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in 70AD and later rebuilding under
Hadrian could not have destroyed continuity of folk-memory. It assumes
that the walls of Pontius Pilate's and Herod's Jerusalem missed out an
area later encompassed in the present ''Old City''. It does not depend
on the improbable authenticity of the relics unearthed in the fourth
century for the church's patroness, the Empress Helena. Jerusalem has
long experience in mixing commerce with religion.
The site's validity may be more likely than not, though by no means
proved beyond reasonable doubt. But the doubts have produced various
alternative suggestions, of which the most impressive was and is
''Gordon's Calvary'', now called the Garden Tomb. It should be on every
pilgrim-tourist itinerary, even if its present evangelical custodians
are mildly agnostic about the ''celestial mathematics'' which influenced
General Gordon of Khartoum.
It lies in an Arab sector beyond the Damascus Gate. It might just be
Calvary -- for what that matters -- and it looks like Calvary, with a
skull-like hill and a tomb. It is also an oasis of calm and simple,
unobtrusive piety amid the bustle of Jerusalem, easily reached on foot
from the Old City without a guide.
For much of Old Jerusalem and its suburbs, however, a guide is a good
investment for independent travellers, especially an Armenian one
relatively detached from local controversies. His fee on a walking tour
is paid for several times over in time-saving, good advice, avoidance of
unnecessary exertion or extortion, and supply of a sense of security in
sensitive areas.
Bus tours do exist but the Old City is unsuited to them; their main
value is to reach the more distant viewpoints and to see the sights of
modern Jewish Jerusalem, the capital of Israel.
I still wish I'd signed up for my Armenian's guidance on the Mount of
Olives (easily tackled on foot) as well as the Old City. I would surely
have found the way to the Russian Church of the Ascension, whose tower
is one of Jerusalem's landmarks, without wandering into Muslim
cemeteries. I wouldn't necessarily have had to let my wife ride one of
the camels kept for unwary visitors. And I certainly would have hired
any camel on a fixed and pre-arranged tariff, without an aftermath of
invocations and lamentations.
Apart from guides, hotels, hospices, and Western churches (notably St
Andrew's near the Montefiore Village and Christ Church on Mount Zion)
are sources of local advice which first-time visitors need. Most ''holy
places'' and sites of major historical interest are still, despite the
formal unification of Jerusalem within Israel after the Six-day War, in
Arab localities.
Its history mingles passions and visions with cruelty and conflict. It
can test unstable or conventional faith, or confirm itself as the place
where ''love and sorrow meet''.
Whatever you think of it, there's nowhere like it.

YOU'VE seen them in their thousands, those trucks with W H Malcolm on
their sides that seem to dominate Scotland's roads.
For some years now one of the heirs apparent to the business has been
playing rugby, but as of this summer some more hours of graft will be
spent at the controls of the business. One of rugby's best grafters on
the pitch will, sadly, be missing from action.
Walter Malcolm, GHK's captain, is to retire at the end of this season,
a year in which his club failed to remain in the top eight teams for
next season's elite Division 1 of the Premier League, and the year in
which the players at old Anniesland voted to sack their coaching team of
Brian Gilbert and Hugh Hamilton with two league games to play.
In the end, a win over Stewart's Melville and a loss last week to
Stirling County were not enough to prevent consignment into next
season's second division.
Malcolm has the basement of his house converted into a gym, and I
caught him after another ''five-mile run'' on the treadmill. It was his
wife, Yvonne, who perhaps summed it up best when she said that she
wondered what he would do now, because ''it's been a way of life for
Walter for sixteen years.'' He reconciles his exit from the game by
saying that he had always wanted to go ''when it was my decision . . .
and not before.''
Now 34, he started out at Paisley Grammarians, went on to play for
Jordanhill for four seasons -- his first game for the first XV was as a
19-year-old with Richie Dixon in the back row and Iain McLauchlan at
loosehead prop -- then he moved to Glasgow Accies, captaining them for
three seasons, two in the first division. Ever since he has been at GHK.
The differences between now and then? ''It's a lot less physical,'' he
said. ''But it is faster. When I started playing there seemed to be a
lot more hard players around, especially in the Borders with sides like
the great Hawick teams, and you knew that if you were on the wrong side
of the ball there would be trouble.''
His big disappointment, you suspect, is that he has played rugby in an
era when no Glasgow city team has mounted a consistent challenge to the
top flight. ''It goes back a long time,'' he said. ''I have always
thought that there was a Glasgow attitude among the players. A softness
about the players. And there have never been enough players who took it
seriously enough in one club to get that club to the top.''
Another point he would make is that whereas Edinburgh has its Bruce
Hays and Dougie Morgans, and the Borders have their Jim Renwicks and
Robbie Lindoreses, Glasgow has few of its top-class players coming back
into coaching to impart their knowledge to willing youngsters.
Or perhaps not so willing. ''I suppose you could say that there's
nothing more off-putting for a coach than to be met by a bunch of blokes
who turn up late, and think that they know it all already. That won't be
the whole reason but it might be part of it,'' said Malcolm. ''There
have been some lazy players, or it may be lazy ex-players. No wonder
ex-players think twice about coming back to coach. I am certainly going
to take my time over that decision, because one of the things I have
found when working with coaches is that they spend more time at rugby
than players do. I want to take some time with my family first, and I'm
really looking forward to that.''
He played for Glasgow in the late eighties, up against Iain Morrison
for one, he crossed swords with the Calder boys, John Jeffrey, and a
host of back-row players that rated Malcolm for his ability, his
strength, and, perhaps above all, his competitive edge that bordered on
the courageous. He was a ground player of consummate ability, swooping
on the ball like an eagle, and a tackler who thought nothing of hoisting
men up to send them backwards. Malcolm was always first to training.
He talked the way he played. ''What I have never understood,'' he
said, ''is the way some people who have it all handed to them on a plate
have not put themselves out that little bit extra to try to get success.
I think that you only get out of something just what you are prepared to
put into it.''
He talks about rugby in the City. ''You just have to look around you,
and if you are honest you will see that rugby in Glasgow is a
middle-class game for the most part.
''It's not mostly working-class anyway,'' he said. ''The game has to
broaden its base to get success. I sometimes think that with most of the
players coming from a certain background it's a miracle that we get
success, but we do get some. Having said all that, I've had a great
time.''
Malcolm's right. The game in Glasgow has to change, and get into the
modern world or it will always remain second league. Malcolm was the
best player I played alongside never to get a cap, and that was sad.
However, if more players in Glasgow had his attitude the place
wouldn't be in the mess it finds itself just now. His enthusiasm for the
game will be missed.
I hope that after a while he finds time to spend less time with the
trucks . . . and more time passing on those skills to youngsters.
He will, if the youngsters have the right attitude, that is.

<HEADLINE>Innovation Trust aims to provide #50m funding for food companies</HEADLINE>

ACCESS to up to #50m of venture capital is expected to be made
available to small and medium-sized food companies from later this year
in a new project to be unveiled in May.
This is the target being set by the Rothschild Asset Management Group
for its Foodchain Innovation Trust which got its first major public
airing at a London seminar yesterday. Initially it aims to provide
between #1m and #2.5m for 15 to 25 emerging food companies with a
starting fund of between #3m and #5m.
''We are not necessarily looking at technology-driven companies. We
are looking at market-driven companies where technology has a role to
play and which have an innovative approach to marketing,'' said Richard
Gueterbock, a former adviser to the Minister of Agriculture and now the
Rothschild executive in charge of the project.
''We are not looking to land management or ownership but if a
farm-based food business approaches us we will consider it. We
originally considered an agri-food technology fund. But considering such
things as the consumer acceptability of new technology and the time
horizons for developing technology we felt this wasn't the right
approach and therefore we arrived at a more consumer-driven
market-orientated fund.''
Smaller companies now have a greater opportunity for product
innovation and supplying rapidly changing consumer demands, he told
delegates to the food technology conference organised by the
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. They suited
supermarket groups' drive for differentiation and broadened interest in
the food market.
The new fund is expected to link in to some extent the Ministry of
Agriculture's market task force which provides some #11m to #12m a year
for marketing and structural improvements in the food and farming
industry. This scheme was set up about three years ago and is currently
aiding the development of some 200 companies.
The announcement was welcomed by Geoffrey John, chairman of Food from
Britain, who also chaired part of the seminar. ''I fully endorse what Mr
Gueterbock has said. There is a rapidly changing market and consumers
are looking continuously for innovation. I believe the life cycle for
many products is getting shorter and retailers and the public are
looking more and more for fashion at the periphery.
''There will always be a demand for the basic products but beyond this
staple range you will have food becoming more and more a fashion.''

IN her last race in Britain, four weeks ago today, Liz McColgan's
victory earned her a wine box, a chocolate Easter egg, a handful of Mars
bars, and two cans of Irn Bru.
That was at the Cupar six-mile road race in Fife. But much more is at
stake tomorrow in the Nutrasweet London Marathon.
First past the post would bring the Dundee woman $55,000 (#34,600),
plus $5000 as first Briton. Performance bonuses promise even more.
McColgan, whose best time is 2hr 27min 32sec, would collect $5000 for
breaking 2-30, $10,000 for sub 2-28, $15,000 for 2-26, and $25,000 for
2-24. A world record (also the course record) would be worth an
additional $125,000, which adds up to a potential jackpot total of
$210,000 in addition to her appearance fee.
Contrary to the belief of some, however, she is not performing for the
money. After two operations and nearly two years plagued by injury, she
is running for her life. ''I can't imagine life without running, and I'd
be doing it if there was nothing to be won,'' she said.
All McColgan wants tomorrow is to negotiate the course injury free,
then be able to run again the next day.
Poison pens are poised to write career obituaries should she fail to
deliver a high placing. Such is her pedigree that when third on her last
appearance, two years ago, it was billed by many as failure.
Illogically, these same hacks will hail any top-five UK male finisher
this weekend as a hero . . . a perverse endorsement of McColgan's
ability.
The truth is that irrespective of her placing, any time inside 2-30,
after what she has been through, would be laudable, and though low-key
by her own standards, would confirm her return to the top flight,
encouraging her aim to do the 10,000 metres at the World championships
this year in Gothenburg, then the marathon at next year's Atlanta
Olympics.
Never one to approach anything half-heartedly, McColgan smashed her
personal best for 20 miles five weeks ago on a solo training run between
Errol and Carnoustie.
Despite the absence of old rival Lisa Ondieki, the London opposition
is formidable. The 5-2 on favourite, Germany's Katrin Dorre, has won the
event for the past three years, and 18 marathons in 31 starts during the
past 14 years. Her fastest time, 2-25-15, was in her most recent race,
at billiard-table Berlin, last autumn. She dismissed McColgan's
front-running reputation: ''Two years ago she was also a strong
front-runner.''
Manuela Machado, the European champion, is rated at 2-1 against
McColgan's 10-1.
If McColgan is not chasing a record, another Dundee athlete is. Former
city councillor, 83-year-old Jenny Wood Allen, is after her own British
record (5-57-20), though she is up against the oldest competitor,
American Mavis Lindgren. She celebrates her eighty-eighth birthday
tomorrow, and ran the Los Angles Marathon three weeks ago. Allen warmed
up by completing the Alloa half marathon last Sunday.
Scots hold six of the veteran age-division bests in a race which this
year boasts the strongest men's field ever, with 17 starters having run
better than 2-11.
Nobody has succeeded in defending the men's title, but that is the
goal of Dionisio Ceron, who has been paid $100,000 to return, and
perhaps even to make headline-provoking comments like: ''If the weather
is fine, I think inside 2-06 is possible here.''
This would be almost a minute inside Belayneh Densimo's world best of
2-06-50, set in Rotterdam seven years ago. Yet when Ceron clocked
2-08-53 into a headwind last year, it was rated as equivalent to the
Ethiopian's mark.
The race is billed as a showdown between the Mexican and Australia's
Commonwealth champion, Steve Moneghetti, who has said he can run
2-07-30.
These predictions were met with overt scepticism by Portugal's Antonio
Pinto, winner three years ago, and in Berlin last year. Well aware of
the toll which the chill winds can take on front-runners on this
twisting course, he said: ''I'll follow with a sack and pick them up.''

Conrad Wilson begins an occasional series on world-renowned opera
houses and their surroundings with a visit to La Scala, Milan
IT IS hard to think of an impractical reason for visiting Milan --
though, as with Glasgow, there are plenty of practical ones. Yet the
streak of romanticism that spawned an opera company in a hard-headed
Scottish city has its long-established Milanese counterpart in La Scala,
most famous of Italian opera houses, with the most ferociously critical
audience in the world. Simply as a scene for scandal, it has its own
unrivalled theatricality. It was where the first night of Madama
Butterfly sensationally flopped in 1904 and where, 90 years later,
Pavarotti was publicly humiliated after botching a top note.
Even the young Verdi was spurned by that least charitable of
audiences. But though the calamity of Un Giorno di Regno (''King for a
Day'') made him swear to give up opera for ever, the success of Nabucco
prompted him to change his mind. True, Aida was subsequently hissed. But
by the end of his career, La Scala was his established domain, and
Otello and Falstaff both received their premieres there. Milanese
enthusiasm, when aroused, can be as great as its scorn.
With space for 3000 people (almost twice as many as Bayreuth) the
auditorium is admittedly too vast for Verdi's mercurial final comedy.
But size, at La Scala, is not the drawback it can be elsewhere. The
horse-shoe auditorium, with its six tiers of boxes, has an unexpected
intimacy. Many of the seats may be uncomfortably cramped, and the
sightlines almost non-existent, yet the atmosphere of the place provides
sufficient compensation. More than elsewhere, you sense that every
performance forms part of the theatre's dramatic history. Thanks to the
voices of Caruso, Callas, Patti, and Gigli, and to the conducting of
Toscanini, Karajan, Giulini, and -- the company's latest musical
director -- Riccardo Muti, the walls of the auditorium have gained their
own rich operatic patina.
Italy's opera season starts later than Britain's. A new production of
Wagner's Die Walkure, with Muti as conductor and Jane Eaglen as
Brunnhilde, launched La Scala's in December. It provoked hostility.
Muti, it was said, should stick to Verdi -- or to Spontini, with whose
mammoth La Vestale (''The Vestal Virgin'') he scored an unexpected hit
last year. ''Muti works miracles,'' declared La Stampa about his
rejuvenation of a work whose libretto Beethoven admired above all
others.
In choice of repertoire La Scala takes more risks than other
world-class opera houses, though this season it is cannily sharing many
of its productions with other companies. This month offers something
relatively safe, a choice piece of early Verdi with Jose Carreras in the
title role.
Then comes Strauss's Salome from Cardiff, followed in May by Berlioz's
Damnation of Faust from Paris. La Traviata (May) and Falstaff (June),
both conducted by Muti, are home-grown, as is the production of The
Tales of Hoffmann that ends the season in July. Giorgio Strehler,
director of Milan's experimental Piccolo Teatro, is in charge of
Falstaff. Already, in Verdi, he has shown that he knows how to shock.
Opera at La Scala alternates with ballet and concerts. For information
leaflets, giving dates and prices, send a bank draft for 20,000 lire
(about #8) to the Ufficio Spedizioni Teatro alla Scala, Via
Filodrammatici 2, 20121 Milan. Seats are nowadays most readily booked by
an exchange of faxes (contact: 010 392 877996 between 9am and 6pm
Italian time). If you don't have access to a fax machine, your
neighbourhood post office may transmit and receive messages for a small
fee.
Bookings can also be made by registered letter, specifying the name of
the work and how much you want to pay, along with three dates in order
of preference. No more than two seats can be reserved at a time. The
booking office will confirm ''only those applications that have been
accepted''. Tickets must be collected from the box-office at least two
hours before curtain-up.
If you decide to wait until you reach Milan before making a booking --
risky if it's a popular opera -- the box-office is beneath the arcade in
Via Filodrammatici, to the left of the theatre. Seats cost from #15 or
so for a distant view to #100-ish for a good one -- about par for the
course in international terms. Standing room costs a fiver. If all this
sounds too complicated, an operatic package deal can be arranged with a
specialised travel agent, such as the London-based Liaisons Abroad (tel:
071 384 1122), which arranges flights, hotels, and seats.
With its elegant neo-classical facade, La Scala is more discreetly
positioned in Milan's historic centre than the grandiose Salle Garnier
in Paris. Many visitors pass by without recognising it, in spite of its
key site between one of the mouths of the lofty Galleria Vittorio
Emanuele and the aptly-named Via Verdi. The Galleria, a triumph of
glass, iron, marble, and mosaic, leads from La Scala to the Cathedral.
Via Verdi leads to the Brera Museum, behind whose austere facade lurks a
collection of paintings gloriously crowned by Caravaggio, Tintoretto,
Veronese, and the Bellini brothers.
Alas, across the road, all that remains of the old Brera Bar -- once a
raffish Milanese pit stop -- is the brass plaque on the floor of its
ersatz successor. But plenty of good local restaurants still go strong,
including the Torre di Pisa at Via Fiori Chiari 21, a bustling sample of
what Milan is all about -- though the cooking, in fact, is Tuscan. Try
the penne with artichokes, the orecchie with turnip tops, and the steak
on a bed of tangy green rocket. A short walk away, at Via Solferino 11,
is the rather calmer Ristorante Rigolo, with a similar sort of menu and
similarly ungreedy prices. For a nightcap, go to the historic Resintina
Bar in Via Mercato, round the corner from the Torre di Pisa. It may not
have quite the range of fine grappas it once had, but, with its
banquettes and bare boards, it's an atmospheric spot to end your
evening.
Milan has some of the best restaurants in Italy, and not all of them
are expensive. Heading from La Scala through the Galleria Vittorio
Emanuele, stop for a stand-up coffee or aperitivo at Camparino, which
retains the authenticity other cafes have lost. From there it's a short
step to the Cathedral and to the top floor of the Rinascente department
store, where Milan's -- some say Italy's -- leading chef, Gualtiero
Marchesi, has established a penthouse cafe and bistro that provide a
view of the Cathedral's spiky roof and a taste of modern Italian cuisine
at a price much lower than you would expect. It's as if John Lewis's
rooftop cafe in Edinburgh had been taken over by the Roux Brothers.
If this is overcrowded, as it tends to be at lunchtime, then go to the
Agnello, a cheerful brasserie in Via Agnello, between the Cathedral and
Piazza San Babila. Osso buco (veal shin with rice) is a speciality, and
the crisp house wine helps to keep the cost down. From here it's a brief
stroll to the Via Montenapoleone for a peep at the fashion boutiques.
Stop at the Caffe Cova for the dearest cup of coffee you'll ever drink.
This was where panettone, Milan's famous fruitcake, was invented in
1817. The service, by prim young waiters, is a study in exquisite
Milanese disdain. The clientele are a fascinating mix of models,
designers, and -- of course -- Japanese tourists.
Anyone who visits Milan mainly for the opera need not stray from the
city's historic centre, though hotels close to La Scala are inevitably
expensive. At #330 for a double room without breakfast, the recently
opened Four Seasons -- a beautiful and tranquil refurbishment of a
fifteenth-century monastery in Via Gesu -- costs even more than the
Villa d'Este at Cernobbio or the Danieli in Venice. As a bonus, however,
it claims to offer the occasional glimpse of Riccardo Muti relaxing
after the opera.
More accessibly priced at #80, and some would say cosier, is the
friendly Albergo Manzoni in Via Santo Spirito, even closer to the opera
house. Verdi himself used to book into, and eventually died in, the
nearby Grand Hotel (#220 a night) in the busy Via Manzoni, where traffic
was rerouted during the week he lay unconscious, trams were forbidden to
ring their bells, and bulletins on his condition, giving his heart and
respiration rates, were hung at the hotel's entrance. To stay there
would be to share yet another bit of Scala history, but visitors might
consider the peaceful Albergo Centro in Via Broletto (#70 including
breakfast) an altogether better bargain.

EMMA Carrick-Anderson took some small consolation from her first title
this week, lifting the British Land British Women's Super G in Tignes,
France.
Despite a top seeding in both slalom and giant slalom, the Dunblane
skier failed to complete her first run in either discipline earlier this
week. Yesterday she found unsurpassed form to take the title by 0.49sec
from Kelly Morris, and went on to help Scotland to victory last night in
the first Home Nations Parallel Slalom Challenge.
In the men's Super G, Graham Bell won by half-a-second from his
brother, Martin, with Scot Alain Baxter a further 1.8sec behind.
Graham Bell proved superior in every department on the fast, rolling
course, raced on well-packed new snow. The two crucial turns -- on to
the steep and off the road section -- were where he took his biggest
advantage.
Kingussie's Andrew Freshwater, who trained fastest on the downhill
course last Sunday, came adrift on the left-hand bend from the road and
did not finish -- a mistake he will hope to avoid in today's downhill.
Graham Bell is favourite for the downhill title, which was last raced
in 1993 and won by Martin, although he has no real chance of winning the
overall title, having missed two of the week's four scheduled
disciplines.
Scotland's team win in the evening came against stronger opposition
than predicted. With 10 teams competing, Scotland's team of Alain
Baxter, Emma Carrick Anderson, and Andrew Freshwater were joined by
Graham Bell -- who is now registered with the Scottish National Ski
Council -- and remained unbeaten. In a thrilling final against Hungary,
the Scots managed to maintain their aggression and explosive starts to
win. England finished fourth. Results:
Men: 1, * G Bell (Henley) 1min 20.83sec; 2, * M Bell (Mortlake)
1-21.31; 3, * A Baxter (Aviemore) 1-23.11; * 4, M Reilly (Perth)

THE development on a non-squashy tomato which would have a longer
shelf life -- likely to be first product of the genetic manipulation of
food -- is a comparatively trivial use of gene transfers, the Rev Dr
John Polkinghorne told a Town and Gown lecture audience at Strathclyde
University.
The same technology could be used, however, to improve the quality of
meat and make it leaner. Even more important was the possibility of
giving crops increased resistance to disease or pests.
Improving crop yields or making it possible for plants to grow in
regions or climates which would normally be considered inhospitable
were, he suggested, ''pretty non-trivial reasons'' for invoking the new
technology.
''The population of the world will continue to increase at quite an
alarming rate for quite a while and we have to find ways of feeding that
population,'' he said.
Dr Polkinghorne, whose first degree was in theoretical physics, is a
Church of England clergyman and president of Queen's College, Cambridge.
He combined his knowledge of scientific and theological disciplines when
he presided over the Committee on the Ethics of Genetic Modification and
food use.
The questions of placing human genes into animals or plants, or
transferring genes from one species of animal into another, did raise a
number of ethical questions, he said. His committee had been able,
however, to reach a common view that small transfers, for specific
purposes, carried no taint of interference in creation or unacceptable
manipulation of animals.
The new technology raised issues of animal welfare and religion. It
also presented a dilemma for vegetarians. Was it possible for them to
eat food from plants which might have been the subject of the transfer
of animal genes?
While arguing that animals must be treated with respect -- and not
merely regarded as objects -- Dr Polkinghorne said that he could not
support those who spoke in terms of animal rights in a way which
asserted that animals were comparable in moral status to human beings.
''I am unable to take the view that animals have rights in that way,''
he said. There were some who would argue that it was wrong to so much as
put a syringe into an animal unless it was for the benefit of that
individual animal.
Science was always opening up new possibilities, which could be used
wisely or foolishly, he said. ''Not everything that can be done should
be done.''
Dr Polkinghorne's committee met groups from different faiths.
Representatives of Islam had strong reservations because of the Koran's
teaching that God's creation is perfect. The only permissible
intervention would be to restore that perfection if it had become
flawed. The transfer of pig genes into another animal would render that
animal unacceptable to them.
The representatives of the Jewish faith, which also disapproves of
eating pigmeat, took a more pragmatic view, however, when presented with
the possibility that a sheep could have in it genes transferred from a
pig. For them it was the whole animal which mattered. ''If it looks like
a sheep -- it's a sheep,'' said the representative of the Chief Rabbi.
As the technology became more widespread it was clear that a labelling
system would have to be introduced so that people could make a choice,
said Dr Polkinghorne. There were worries that labelling might be the
kiss of death -- but that was a commercial question, not an ethical one.
* Dr Polkinghorne's lecture was one in a series sponsored by The
Herald. The next will be on May 17 when the Chief Constable of
Strathclyde, Leslie Sharpe, will be the speaker.

MICHAEL Ayers added a second notch towards outright ownership of a
Lonsdale belt by stopping Birmingham's Karl Taylor in the eighth round
of their British lightweight title bout at Crystal Palace last night.
Ayers made constant use of his right hand, opening cuts over and under
Taylor's left eye before Derby referee Paul Thomas called a halt after
inspecting the injuries.
From round six, it had become only a matter of time before Ayers held
on to his crown, six weeks after having won it with another stoppage of
Preston's Paul Burke.
Now the plan is for Ayers to win the Lonsdale trophy in record time by
making a second successful defence at Potters Bar on May 23.
That would give Ayers the belt in just 95 days, eclipsing the existing
record of 160 days held by former featherweight champion Colin McMillan.
Ayers said: ''It's just started to sink that I am the British champion
and I can have a Lonsdale belt as my own property if I win my next
fight.
''I won the title only six weeks ago and it hasn't really had time to
sink in. With this victory, I am sure it will now.
* RICHIE Woodhall, the undefeated European and Commonwealth
middleweight champion, has been lined up for a summer showdown with WBC
super-middleweight champion Nigel Benn.
Promoters Frank Warren and Don King are said to be keen to stage the
fight, which would be Benn's first since his ill-fated meeting with
Gerald McClellan.
Woodhall, who won the European title by stopping Italian Silvio Branco
in his home town of Telford last month.

WEST Indies slumped to 195 all out after Brian Lara was dismissed in
controversial circumstances on the opening day of the first Test against
Australia at the Kensington Oval in Barbados yesterday.
He went in with West Indies struggling at five for two and they
slumped to six for three with the dismissal of captain Richie
Richardson. But Lara and Carl Hooper put on 124 before Hooper fell for
60.
Lara hit 11 boundaries as he raced to 65 before cutting paceman
Brendon Julian to gully, where Steve Waugh juggled the ball as he fell.
It seemed to slip from his grasp, momentarily touching the ground
before rebounding to his chest. But he claimed the catch and, despite
Lara's mild protest, local umpire Lloyd Barker gave the catch.

With the conspicuous Wheatear come hopes for the spring and memories
of those that have passed for Hugh Ouston
LIKE our own species, the Wheatear comes out of Africa, flying every
summer over the pathways of human migration. Remember, when you see it
flicking its white rear on the machair of the west coast or the marram
of the east, that this most welcome forerunner of spring has crossed the
Sahara, the Mediterranean, and most of Europe.
It is an early migrant and a conspicuous one, both for its habitat --
all wheatears are birds of open country, rock, desert, or grass -- and
for its behaviour. In late March look for the birds prancing like
miniature fighting cocks, squabbling over their acre of land. You'll
know if they are around because roadsides are ideal territory -- plenty
of turf cropped close by black-faced yowes and a drystane dike for a
nesting hole.
Their tails have an inverted black T below the blazing white rump
which gives the true (though often bowdlerised) derivation of their
name. The black eyepatch and wings, the white eyebrow and grey hood and
cloak make a subtle and distinctive pattern above a truly wheat-coloured
body. Across Europe its many cousins make variations on this plumage,
from the pure black and white Black Wheatear of the Spanish Sierras to
the sandy fawn Isabelline Wheatear of the Turkish plains.
Not all migrants passing through Scotland will stay to breed. In April
an expert -- or optimistic -- eye can tell the Greenland race apart by
its larger size and brighter colouring. In Victorian times Wheatears
were trapped on arrival in the south of England and served up as
dinner-table delicacies -- less eating on them than on a good Scots
capercaillie.
I had a friend from Africa. We camped together as young men on the
west coast. He returned to Africa and died there. Whenever I see the
wheatears return each spring I think of him.

PAISLEY fans who attend tomorrow's Scottish Cup final between the
holders, Livingston Bulls, and Glasgow Brightsiders at Meadowbank will
doubtless see lots of old ''Buddies.''
But they will rue the three that got away to play key roles for the
protagonists.
Livingston, who are going for their seventh league and cup double in a
row, will have Bobby Archibald and Iain Maclean, while Glasgow have more
recently acquired Phil Birch. It must be galling to think what the
current Paisley side might have achieved with this trio in their ranks.
On the evidence of last Sunday's Scottish league decider between the
same teams at Easterhouse, the Livingston pair will have the stronger
influence.
Ron Mather, coach of the last Paisley team to win the Scottish Cup
some 17 years ago, rates Maclean alongside the current Scottish
Basketball Association president Bill McInnes as the finest player to be
produced in Scotland.
''They're similar in status and head and shoulders above the rest,''
he declared.
Archibald, who will be 40 in November, won two Scottish Cup medals for
Paisley in the seventies.
* ARBROATH Musketeers snatched a dramatic basket in the last second of
the Bank of Scotland Under-16 Cup final to beat Troon Terrors 81-79 at
Meadowbank last night.
Beefeater Kool Kats again won the Bank of Scotland junior women's cup
despite spirited opposition from Polonia Phoenix.
Portobello High School also scored a fifth win in a row, in the
Scottish Schoolboys Open cup final, beating Tain Royal Academy 85-55.
Glasgow's Eastbank Academy beat Portobello High 64-51 in the under-14
girls' final.

SCARABEN and Sarmatian, trained by neighbours Steve Kettlewell and
Micky Hammond at Middleham, fought out a thrilling duel in the Calder
Handicap at Hamilton yesterday.
Jimmy Fortune, on Scaraben, snatched the lead 100 yards from home and
bravely held the John Carroll-ridden Sarmatian by a neck.
Kettlewell had chosen this extended-mile event a fortnight ago for
Scaraben's Flat racing reappearance. ''He's never going to get ground
conditions to suit him more than here,'' said Kettlewell.
Hammond had to wait only an hour before going one better with Zaaheyah
in the concluding Earn Handicap.
After his Reverand Thickness's success at Edinburgh, Newmarket trainer
Stuart Williams rounded off an excellent two days when completing a
double with Concer Un and Barti-Ddu, both ridden by Kevin Darley.

A return trip by veteran climbers to the scene of their former glories
will give a Scottish artist the chance to paint at the top of the world,
discovers Douglas Crawford
THIS month marks the 40th anniversary of the conquest of Kanchenjunga,
the mountain which raises its vast bulk above the remote and the
trackless country in the far north-east of Nepal not far from the border
between Sikkim and Tibet. To mark the celebration of this 1955 event,
when the climbing of the third highest (28,208ft) mountain in the world
was achieved, four of the original climbing party will be returning to
the scene of their triumph.
In addition to George Band, one of the original summiteers who will be
leading the trek, there will be (Colonel) Tony Streather, Neil Mathew,
and Norman Hardie. (Band, Mathew, and Hardie were also members of the
successful 1953 Everest team.) This will, of course, be a pukka trek, a
trek with a difference, not only because these men, now in their
seventies, will attempt to reach the site of their north and south base
camps, both of these at an altitude of well over 17,000 feet, but also
because they will be accompanied by eight others.
One of the eight is Langholm-based Lincoln Rowe, a graduate of Duncan
of Jordanstoun College of Dundee and an artist who has over the past 10
years made a particular speciality of carrying out his chosen task of
painting at extremely high altitudes.
As 42-year-old Rowe says, ''to be able to spend time walking, talking,
and listening to these people relating their experience in situ and at
first hand will be an unrepeatable experience. I feel it a great
privilege to be asked. These, now elderly men, created a large part of
mountaineering history. It will be a joy to be with those guys.''
Rowe has just returned from Norway, where he was carrying out
commissioned work for 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines during their
Arctic warfare training. And it quickly becomes clear that he has
followed a career which could almost have been taken out of Boys' Own
magazine. After completing his art course at Duncan of Jordanstoun, he
taught. But soon he ''got fed up with the prospect that I might be
teaching for the next 40 years'' and got a job with the London-based
Marine Society. It carries out educational courses at virtually any
level and in virtually any subject -- from French to nuclear physics to
navigation. The work of all subsequently established nautical colleges
in the world is based on the aims and aspirations of this society.
Rowe not only promotes an interest in the arts among seafarers but
also paints as he voyages with them. He sailed through the Australian
Bight on one of the last three remaining 1944 T2 tankers. He was on
board a ship which was carrying a potentially explosive cargo of
naphtha. On this vessel he and the crew had to race through the Gulf of
Oman at high speed at night to avoid being captured by terrorists who
could hold the ship and its cargo and its crew to ransom.
A snake bite put him out of action when he signed up during the
Falklands conflict, although he eventually did get to the Falklands in
November of that year. He spent a month recording the aftermath of the
war on canvas. ''You get a sense of space out in these islands. And it's
a fact that you can see four different weather patterns all at the one
time from their hills.''
He returned to the Falklands four times between then and 1985,
painting some of the 300 wrecks of old sailing ships off the islands.
Then he was commissioned to paint the new airport which was being built
at Mount Pleasant -- ''the biggest military base in the southern
hemisphere''.
It was there that, obliquely, he got his first introduction to the
Himalayas. ''I had only painted ships beforehand,'' he says, but, in the
Falklands he met Colonel Meryon Bridges, and he was to meet him later in
Hong Kong. Colonel Bridges told Rowe that he was about to do a recce for
a proposed joint British-Nepali expedition to Kanchenjunga and Rowe said
that ''if ever you want to take an artist with you . . .'' On his return
to this country, Rowe was called on by Mike Kelford, a colonel with the
Gurkhas, who asked to see some of his work.
As a result, Rowe ''signed up'' to accompany the 1985 expedition to
the 24,000-foot Kirat Chuli. This involved a 21-day walk-in from Dharan.
The expedition was forced back down the mountain by a ''mega'' storm
which hit them at 22,000 feet. ''But I wouldn't have missed this for the
world. The deal was that I would do the painting and that they would
teach me to climb.''
All this activity meant that he could no longer remain with the Marine
Society. In 1987 he was the artist on that year's British-Indian army
expedition to the 25,000ft Saser Kangri in Ladakh on the India-Pakistan
border and he himself reached a height of 23,000ft. On this trip and
from the mountainside he painted views of Annapurna. In 1988 he was on
the expedition to climb Everest by the west ridge and from the Tibetan
side. He was back painting with another expedition to Everest in 1992.
And he accompanied Rebecca Stevens and Harry Taylor on their 1993
Everest climb (when she was the first UK woman to reach the top and
Taylor was the first UK person to reach the top without oxygen).
Rowe wears mitts which have been designed for the Royal Marines and
leave only the tips of one's fingers exposed. All the paintings out
there are done in pastel. Some will be sketches which he can ''scale
up'' in his Langholm studio but the majority remain exactly as they have
been done on the mountain.
Rowe went out to Nepal a month in advance of the actual expedition
(which leaves this country on April 12). He is spending the intervening
period building up a portfolio and going on the Annapurna circuit to do
paintings of Macchapuchare and of the various Annapurna peaks (the
highest being over 26,000ft). On this venture, he hopes to get a new
angle for a painting of Annapurna from the village of Pokhara, about 120
miles due west from Kathmandu.
He also intends to spend a week to 10 days carrying out studies of the
remarkable but, sadly, decaying Newhari architecture in the three old
capital cities of the Kathmandu valley -- Pathan, Bakhtapur, and
Kathmandu itself.
Thereafter he will be joined in Kathmandu by George Band and company
for the trek of a lifetime journeying to one of the biggest mountain
massifs in the world and involving the crossing of three mighty ridges
en route to the north and south base camps of Kanchenjunga itself.
Rowe's work as an artist will provide for his sponsors -- B D O Stoy
Hayward and W &amp; J Burness -- an exhibition of around 30 paintings which
could be used by the companies for ''special previews'' for their
customers and their associates. George Band and others will also be
available to give talks on the trip.

The introduction of an exotic breed to Scottish waters has been hailed
as a pioneering move but, as Rod McGill reports, there is a catch
GOVERNMENT scientists are baffled by the appearance of a piranha fish
in Loch Leven. The fish, which is native to the rivers of the Amazon
Basin in South America, was hooked by angling writer and journalist
Bruce Sandison. ''I was amazed,'' he said. ''I was fishing along the
south shore of Castle Island when it took my fly, a size 14 Black
Penneld, but it simply ate its way out of the landing net.''
Scottish Secretary, Ian Lang, has ordered an inquiry by fishery
scientists from the Government's Freshwater Fishery Research Laboratory
in Pitlochry. Dr Richard Shelton, chief officer of the laboratory, has
promised prompt action and intends to ''pull out all the stops'' and
produce a preliminary report within a year.
The most likely explanation is that the fish was introduced by a
visiting angler. An English law prohibits the unauthorised introduction
of alien species to English waters but there is no similar law in
Scotland: Loch Lomond has suffered from the introduction of ruffe
(gymnocephalus cernua) which now represent a threat to indigenous
species in the loch.
Zander (stizostedion lucioperca), a predator from Eastern Europe, have
colonised much of East Anglia and fishery biologists fear they might be
brought north. Magnus Magnusson of Scotland's environmental watchdog
agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, said: ''There is nothing to stop
people from doing so and the effect on wild fish would be devastating.
Piranha fall into the same category as zander.''
The owner of Loch Leven, Sir David Montgomery, is not concerned: ''We
already have North American Rainbow trout in Loch Leven, so why not
South American piranha? I run a commmerical operation, not a wildlife
charity. I am sure anglers would welcome the opportunity to fish for
these splendid creatures. Personally, I wouldn't mind zander as well,
indeed, the more the merrier.''
But many anglers are concerned that piranha could strip Scottish
waters bare. Mike Spurgan, an Edinburgh angler and international
traveller who has fished for piranha in Guatemala, claims the fish will
destroy sport in Scotland: ''Anyone who knows the havoc these ferocious
fish cause would be alarmed. I have seen the carcass of a cow stripped
bare in seconds.''
However, a Scottish Tourist Board spokemsan said: ''Anything that
extends the holiday season and fills empty beds in Scottish hotels has
to be considered. Stocks of wild fish in Scotland are declining and
something has to be done to attract anglers. Too many spend their money
overseas. If piranha help to bring them back to Scotland it may not be a
bad thing.''
This view is not shared by other countryside users represented by the
Scottish Sports Council. It chief executive, Allan Alstead, speaking in
Edinburgh yesterday, commented: ''I have not seen the report,
personally, but a number of organisations we work with are worried,
particularly canoeists, swimmers, and other water-resource users. These
fish could attack people in the water.''
Stuart Housden, Scottish director of the RSPB, shares this concern:
''Piranha will certainly be predators of wildfowl and place at risk our
Loch Leven Vane Farm bird sanctuary. Furthermore, should they spread
throughout Scotland many rare species will also be at risk. I am
thinking in particular of birdlife in the Flow Country of Sutherland
where we have just acquired the Forsinard Estate. Something must be
done.''
Locating the piranha in Loch Leven's 3500 acres will not be easy. The
option favoured by the owner is a competition where anglers using wire
leaders and live bait trawl the loch for the fish. Teams of six anglers
per boat are to be invited and an entry fee of #50 per angler has been
suggested. Loch Leven has 50 boats and the event is scheduled to last
six days.
Barry Hearn, chairman of ''Matchroom Limited'', organiser of Fish
''O'' Mania 11 -- the quest to find the king of the water -- has offered
to sponsor the event: ''We would guarantee the same prize money for Fish
'O' Mania 11, #25,000, and bring along some very special guests,
including Skye TV and luminaries from the angling world. It would be fun
time for all the family with sideshows and a computerised scoreboard.''
Further information can be obtained from the Scottish Office who have
set up a ''Piranha Hotline'' (tel: 0345 741 741). Anglers are urged to
immediately report any piranha sightings. For competition details,

IT'S a bit like the old Chinese curse. We are living in ''interesting
times''. It's a puzzle for the poor old investor. Are interest rates
going up or down? Is the dollar too cheap or the yen too dear? What will
the Germans do about the mark? Are emerging markets so cheap after their
setback that we should all fill our boots? Is the UK economy still on an
up trend -- and if it is, why don't we feel good about it?
If you are a well informed and active investor, you can perhaps keep
ahead of the game. But for most it is not easy even if you ignore
dealing charges, and a lot of this year's annual PEP and personal
pension valuations make glum reading when compared to last year's.
Collective investment vehicles investment and unit trusts are seen as
part of the answer for the amateur investor. But even with these risk
spreading investments there is a good deal of selecting to do.
If you buy a trust of whichever variety it will in many cases have a
label on it to tell you what its speciality is. This can range from UK
blue chips to something exotic in the Far East or Latin America. And few
of the managers will sell out and go into cash no matter how cautious
they may be. The logic is that they feel they have been given a mandate
to invest in their particular area and they will do their best within
it, leaving you to decide whether you still want to be in it or not.
Back in 1988 money manager Guinness Flight was asked to set up what
might have been called the ''puzzled investor fund''. In fact, it called
it the International Balanced Growth Fund and made it one of its
offshore funds.
The request, which came as it happens from Switzerland, was to set up
a fund which combined all the expertise within the group and removed
from the investor the worry over whether his or her cash should be in
bonds, shares or currencies. The managers would switch into whichever
seemed the most appealing at the time. Also, as a risk averse vehicle,
it had the somewhat unusual ability to switch completely into cash.
A similar fund called the Global Balanced Growth Fund has now been set
up onshore. Francis Seymour, a director of Guinness Flight Global Asset
Management who has been running the original fund since it started and
will also manage the new one, says: ''We are aiming to out-perform cash.
We see our investors as people who are looking for lower risk and are
prepared to accept a lower return. But the returns are better than
cash.''
In sterling terms his fund has so far achieved a 10.8% annualised
return, beating the building society index, which showed 8.1% over the
five years, and the MSCI World Index, which gave 8.7%, and equalling the
10.8% achieved by the Salomon World Government Bond Index. And Seymour
says that out of 130 global risk balanced growth funds over the last
five years ''we were second in terms of performance''.
He also managed to achieve one of the lowest volatility ratings, a
comfort for those investors who like to watch the performance of their
funds. He comments: ''Markets are becoming more and more volatile
because of transparency, ease of trading, changes in trading and the
growth of hedge funds and hot money.
''We see a great demand for low risk funds. Investors are finding
asset allocation decisions more difficult -- it is less clear where the
returns will be -- and are more prepared to delegate to the profession.
We believe this is a particularly timely opportunity given the current
high levels of real bond yields worldwide and the opportunity for a
significant bond rally following the rise in US and UK interest rates.
''There is also the likelihood of an upward movement in international
equity markets prompted by a rise in bond prices.'' And for his fund he
claims: ''The combination of low volatility together with the potential
for attractive investment returns is hard to beat.''
To keep risks on the low side, the fund restricts investments in
shares to a maximum of 60%. At present shares are likely to make up 45%
of the total, with bonds taking 35% and cash 20%. Last year his offshore
fund had only 20% in bonds and 35% to 40% in cash. Over the last three
months he has been reducing the cash element.
The fund aims for a total return rather than annual yield, and the
current indication is that the Global Balanced Growth Fund will have a
yield of around 2.5%.
So far as shares are concerned, he comments: ''I think the UK market
is one of the cheapest in the world.'' It has, he feels, the potential
to rise by some 10% -- ''I think the UK market wants to have a run.''
He adds: ''I think all financial markets are reasonably underpinned.
The rogue card is the dollar. Currencies have the capacity to upset
markets but the dollar is very cheap. Wall Street is not as cheap as the
UK. There is a thousand point differential. The UK goes down when Wall
Street goes down but does not go up when Wall Street goes up.''
Guinness Flight describes the new fund as a hybrid between its Global
Bond Fund, Global Equity Fund and Managed Currency Fund. It will,
however, make its own investments rather than investing in these funds.
The group has particular expertise in currency management, and this will
be applied in managing the new fund. Currency exposure will be managed
separately to the underlying assets to protect the portfolio from
possible losses resulting from movements in exchange rates.
Minimum investment for those wanting to lock away funds long term
without too much worry is #5000.

JIMME O'Neill's life and art is illuminated by many surprising facts,
in the same way that the house which is home to Jimme and his family is
the only one in Coatbridge sporting a frontage so lividly purple that it
has become a landmark among local taxi drivers.
Surprising things about the Silencers and their leader? How about the
fact that the band's current single, Wild Mountain Thyme, is the
transformation of a traditional mournful Celtic air into something
wholly contemporary, wondrously uplifting, and entirely free of
pomp-fake Runnyriggery?
And what about Jimme O'Neill's teenage daughter, Aura, who shares a
most fetching vocal duet with her dad on the same record: with help from
Jimme, Aura made her first single, Witchery Woods, at the age of seven!
And there's Jimme's wife, Sadie, who fronts her own band, Bea Bea Chu
Chu.
And did you know that, once upon a time in his earliest boyhood, Chart
Bite TV presenter Ewan MacLeod used to be the secretary of the
Silencers' Fan Club? Meanwhile, you might be a little shocked to learn
that in the Silencers' prime market, France, their new album, So be it,
is outselling Madonna three-to-one.
And yet another surprising Silencers' fact is that Jimme almost became
the first Scottish painter accorded Official Patronage by the Royal
Court of Wet Wet Wet. He was personally sounded out by yon Marti Pellow,
you know.
Oh aye, Jimme could have been in there with his brushes, years before
the Wets' recent well-publicised decision to swathe their new album in a
sleeve featuring paintings by a plethora of noted native canvas-bashers,
top dab-slappers ranging from John Byrne and Peter Howson to June
Redfern and Lesley Banks.
How did it happen? Let Jimme narrate the tale, story-telling being
something at which he is admirably adept.
''The Silencers and the Wets were both doing an Anti-Poll Tax gig in
Edinburgh, and Marti came up to me and said that he liked my T-shirt and
asked where I'd got it. I said I'd made it myself . . . painted it --
actually, the painting on the T-shirt eventually became the cover of one
of our albums, Dance to the Holy Man.
''Anyway, Marti said it was brilliant, and then he chuckled about me
doing T-shirts for the Wets that would maybe give them a wee change of
image.''
Jimme has never had the time to take Marti up on the offer, although
his painting has continued apace -- as can be seen in the photograph on
this page -- in tandem with the Silencers' music.
''I'd painted from childhood, and was all set to continue my painting
by going to art school,'' says Jimme. ''But then my dad, who was a
schoolteacher himself, took me aside and said that if I went to art
school as a painter, I'd be most likely to end up as an art teacher . .
. and I didn't want to end up as an art teacher.''
Instead, Jimme went to art school to study architecture, first on a
part-time basis in Glasgow for three years and latterly full-time in
London. But the lure of music -- ''or to be more accurate, the lure of
smoking lots of dope and going to pop festivals all the time'' --
eventually elbowed art school and architecture out of the window . . .
before music led Jimme to re-discover his original love of painting.
''Sometime after I'd finished with my first professional band,
Fingerprintz, I was officially signed up as a full-time songwriter by a
London publishing firm, Metropolis.''
Making his mark on the music business in the early eighties was not an
easy task, however. So Jimme deployed another of his artistic talents,
too.
''I began painting shirts with acrylic fabric-paint -- regular shirts
as well as T-shirts -- and wearing them out to all the happening
nightclubs of what was then the New Romantic era, places like the
Batcave, Le Beat Route, the Embassy, the Camden Palace.
''It was a means of self-advertising, basically, a means of signalling
that I was different, of trying to stand out. You see, the publishers'
building that I was in was also home to New Romantic trendsetters like
Marc Almond and Soft Cell as well as Rusty Egan, who was then running
the Camden Palace as the world's hottest club, with the most selective
door-policy in the universe.
''I sold some of my T-shirt designs to an American bloke who shortly
afterwards ended up making millions from the vast success of the Frankie
Goes To Hollywood T-shirt. My arrangement with him didn't result in
quite as much money . . . I didn't understand the fashion business well
enough to be able to do anything commercially with my designs.
''And then no matter how quickly you try to paint a shirt, it turns
into such a time-consuming job that you end up liking the shirts you've
made too much to sell them.''
Jimme has continued painting, turning to canvas but still using heavy,
durable plastic fabric-paints. ''Silver, gold, and pearl are common
fabric-paint colours, and I've used them to create textured, iconic
paintings.'' Hence, as well as Dance to the Holy Man, the painting of
Elvis Died for our Sins. ''And there's one called Discophobia that I
started during a TV interview for Rapido, purely because the interviewer
wanted to film me painting something.
''I've had a little exhibition in France, but while the momentum of
the music business carries me forward with the band, I don't have a
similar disciplined schedule for my painting. And if you're going to do
an exhibition in a gallery, it's based on the gallery selling your
paintings . . . and as I've only got 35, I'd feel lost without them if
they were sold.''
Your paintings aren't quite as immediately accessible as the
Silencers' music tends to be, are they?
''There's a deliberately unharmonious element to some of them. And the
Silencers' music is deliberately harmonious and intended to be available
to people who have different tastes, although there are less immediate
things that you can delve into if you want to. We'd decided right from
the start that this was how it's going to be.
''Fingerprintz had always looked for the jagged and the quirky, and
when I formed the Silencers with Cha Burns, Cha said: 'Oh aye Jimme, you
can keep the lyrics quirky . . . but the music's got to be accessible.'
''There's also the fact that when you're making records, you're
dealing with lots of different opinions . . . from the rest of the band,
your friends, the engineer, the record company, your A&amp;R man . . . it's
like a long set of hurdles. But when you're painting a picture, you're
just doing it for yourself.''
In contrast, So be it is an album that was done for everyone who likes
a classic pop song. Strong tunes; lyrics that are clever without being
clever-clever; propulsive beatiness; chiming guitars.
But what of the O'Neill domicile, now christened the Purple House by
the cabbies of Coatbridge? Jimme didn't paint it himself. Actually, what
happened was that Jimme went off for a tour of road-duty with the
Silencers, bidding his house-painter brother-in-law farewell with a
vague statement that ''purple might be nice for the front door''.
Indeed. But Jimme hadn't banked on large expanses of purple guttering
and purple window frame, too. Bit of a surprise to come back home to,
that was. But like the Silencers, the best surprises are life-enhancing.
* So be it is the Silencers' current album, on the Permanent label.
The band begin a Scottish tour on Arran on April 14, before heading to
Fort William; Inverness; Skye; Aberdeen; Glenrothes; the Lyceum in
Edinburgh, and ultimately Glasgow's Barrowland.

FRIENDLY societies -- a force for the future or an amiable
anachronism? Well, that depends on who you talk to. Friendly societies
have been around for more than 200 years, and before the State took over
the job of paying welfare benefits back in the forties they were
enormously important.
The growth of the welfare state hit friendly societies hard.
Compulsory contributions to the National Insurance scheme took up more
and more of our income, and means-tested supplementary benefits took
away the incentive to provide for ourselves and our families.
What's more, the administration of the State system was nationalised
even though Lord Beveridge had proposed that friendly societies should
retain a central role in the administration of the new scheme.
But now cutbacks in the scope and level of benefits paid by the State
are turning the emphasis back to the principle of mutual self-help on
which the friendly societies were founded.
Changes in the NHS and State benefits, and the fact that giant
financial institutions are turning away from large sections of the
population who simply do not earn enough to be worth bothering about
means some of those who need financial protection the most are being
left out in the cold.
Some believe it is probably the provision of welfare-type benefits to
the less affluent that represents the most significant potential for
friendly societies in the years ahead. They already provide a range of
financial protection for their members, but this could be extended much
further -- into the provision of nursing homes, for example -- as demand
increases.
While these developments may be some way off, societies should soon
receive a more immediate boost to their business. The Government is
proposing to lift the limit on the unique tax-exempt savings plans that
only friendly societies can offer from #18 to #25 a month in early May.
The rise in premiums means these plans should be much better value for
money and be able to take their place alongside PEPs and Tessas in an
individual's tax-free savings portfolio.
''The tax-exempt product is popular across the board,'' says Harry
Gibb at Scottish Friendly. ''Plans can be taken out for children as well
as adults, and we've shown we can out-perform the market in terms of
investment growth.''
There are many different types of friendly society, but most still
have very strong connections with the communities around them and a
commitment to work on behalf of their members -- unlike major building
societies, which long ago abandoned the idea of mutuality in favour of
making profits.
Friendly societies continue to have much stronger links with their
members, particularly as many of them still provide the valuable service
of collecting cash premiums for the range of financial products they
offer.
''We are a traditional friendly society which remains committed to
providing a service to members, including those who do not have access
to a bank account,'' says Ron Baxter, chief executive at Scottish Legal.
Research indicates that some 20% of the adult UK population still do
not have a bank account and, therefore, are barred from taking out life
insurance, where premiums usually have to be paid by standing order or
direct debit.
So societies such as Scottish Friendly and Scottish Legal still have a
very important role to play in giving people the chance to protect
themselves and their families by making cash payments to the agent who
calls to collect their premiums.
Coming right up to date, they may also be instrumental in opening up
personal pension plans, unit trusts and PEPs to savers who might
otherwise feel this type of investment is beyond their means or
understanding.
The fact that there are so many different types of friendly society in
existence has made it difficult for them to get their message across to
the investing public, who are often not sure whether societies are
locally-based social organisations or professionally run insurance
companies.
Later this year societies should be able to speak with a louder voice
when the two main trade associations merge. A new Friendly Society
Association will bring together the Association of Collecting Societies,
which includes the two biggest societies with billions of pounds under
management, and the National Conference of Friendly Societies, which
takes in many of the smaller local societies and workplace-based
organisations.
Many were originally formed as self-help groups for members of a
particular community or trade, and their names still bear witness to
their historical past -- the Ancient Order of Foresters and the
Shepherds' Friendly Society are examples -- even though they may be open
to all. Some of the largest -- the Police Mutual, for instance -- still
offer benefits only to the employees of a particular profession or
trade.
For many smaller societies the social and fraternal aspect of their
activities are at least as important as the financial benefits
membership provides. These can range from free legal aid to cash help
for convalescence and visits to the dentist or optician.
Unlike insurance companies, which have set premiums for different
types of cover and only pay out if strict conditions are met, some
friendly societies can and do make discretionary payments if they feel a
cause is worthy enough.
This may be very reassuring for members who feel they can trust their
friendly society and other members to rally round in times of need, but
it is this type of haphazard financial arrangement that may have to go
by the board as fraternal societies modernise to meet the 21st century.

WHEN a big star's in a really deep career slump, making good movies
can be just as much a waste of his and the box-office's time as making
stinkers. Look at poor old Kevin Costner, who couldn't at present get a
hit if he did 12 rounds with Mike Tyson: until the public decides to
stop being sick of his face, he can walk on water, heal the blind, and
star in pictures as good as Wyatt Earp (rental, cert 12) as much as he
likes and it'll make no difference -- when you're hot, you're hot, and
when you're not, you're not.
Wyatt Earp has been pegged as one of the great flops of all time, and
critics have called it Heaven's Gate II (that was a great film too, by
the way) -- but Lawrence Kasdan's epical and visibly expensive account
of the much-filmed life and exploits of the Wild West lawman fails only
in that it refuses to endorse the noble Western myths of earlier
versions like My Darling Clementine and Gunfight at the OK Corral.
Costner's Wyatt Earp is a grim, complex, innerly driven killer whom you
could never imagine marrying Grace Kelly or being friends with Victor
Mature, and on top of that the film insists on exploring his
psychological history at fully biographical length -- the whole thing
tops three hours.
Yet it's also a film that picks up momentum as it goes, like a
snowball rolling downhill, and by the time we get to the gunfight at the
OK Corral the story has assumed an epic grandeur reminiscent of John
Ford. The mood is downbeat and the tone anti-heroic (which gives it some
trouble in finding itself a conclusion), but serious Western fans will
find it an unusual and oddly un-American addition to the genre -- not
least for Dennis Quaid's ornery but strangely endearing characterisation
of Earp's sidekick Doc Holliday. Reality? Myth? Legend? Who cares . . .
it's a Western.
It's been a rich couple of weeks for classic oldies finally making it
on to tape, and among the most welcome debutantes has been Henri-Georges
Clouzot's 1954 French psychochiller Les Diaboliques (retail, Arrow/First
Class, #14.99). The truly diabolical twists and turns of this
suburban-seedy story of sexual tension, marital hell, and double-cross
murder have been stolen too often -- mainly by British B-thrillers of
the early 1960s -- to retain all of their former surprise, but Clouzot
told the tale (wife and mistress conspire to murder vicious husband, but
the corpse apparently won't lie down) first and best.
And finally: animation buffs who enjoyed Tim Burton's sweet but
sinister fairytale The Nightmare Before Christmas are encouraged to
check out Ladislaw Starewicz: Selected Films (retail, #15.99), a
collection of five shorts by the brilliant but obscure (to Couch Potato,
anyway) Polish stop-motion puppet-maker, dating from before the First
World War to the 1950s.
If Tim Burton hasn't seen these creepy little animal fables and taken
them to heart, then Brian De Palma's never seen a Hitchcock movie.

The Herald's guide to the best sounds around
Compiled by DAVID BELCHER
Din Of Ecstasy, Chris Whitley (Work/Sony)
* IN WHICH Mr Whitley reveals himself to be the cousin of K Cobain, R
Carver, and J Buckley, assaying powerful free-form song-meanderings for
gravelly voice and electric riff-grinder gewtar in a most efficacious
fashion. Highlights include a stertorous version of the Jesus and Mary
Chain's Some Candy Talking. Investigate soonliest.
Succour, Seefeel (Warp)
* Pervade! Pervade! Attain ambience! Court synergy! Seefeel glide
around their studio, twiddling a knob here, a fader there. Patterns
emerge, merge and mesmerise. Perfect for all those who occasionally
fancy modulating their tonalities in a markedly uninsistent manner.
Journey Through The Underground, various (Produce)
* Fourteen tiptop samples from the hardbag genre: ie melodic and
economical dance music with an unremitting 4/4 drive, capable of
inspiring hen parties to shake and shoogle all night round votive piles
of handbags on dancefloors. Best 'uns? Sabrynaah Pope's histrionic It
Works For Me; the pumping Stevie Wonder-derived gospel-house of Take A
Stand by Gerideau; U.N.I.T.E.D's naggingly addictive Black Madonna; and
Bad Boys by Paradise Presents with its delightfully inane chorus:
''Wudja lahk ta boogie? Beep, beep!'' Well, since you're asking, yes, we
would like to boogie . . . and beep, beep indeed.
Anthems Volume 1, various (Streetsounds)
* First released in 1987, this compilation of seventies grooviness is
a free-wheeling jazz-funk lifesaver. Why? Because if you bought this on
vinyl eight years ago, you'll have worn it out by now. Replenish your
soul with this re-issue today and wear out your living-room carpet as
you hustle yourself helpless! Not only do you get Tom Browne's
fat-bassed Funkin' For Jamaica and John Handy's easy-stepping Hard Work,
but there's also Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now by McFadden and Whitehead;
Billy Paul's Bring The Family Back, and Movin' by Brass Construction.
Best take Brass Construction's advice and get yourself together -- huh!
-- and movie it on to your local record store.
Deep Down In Florida, various (Sequel)
* A string-drenched collection of honey'd and soulful balladeering
recorded in the late seventies on Miami's TK label, best known for
having been home to KC and the Sunshine Band, Betty Wright and Gwen
McCrae. Thrill particularly to the godlike Otis Clay and the achingly
majestic Bobby Patterson.
Compiled by MICHAEL TUMELTY
Tchaikovsky, Piano Concerto No 1 (Tring International)
* RECENTLY I was on about CDs at a fiver. Here's more, and cheaper
still. Tring International has contracted the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra to make a series of 125 recordings that will retail at #3.99
per CD. And, to judge from the quality of the first few I've received,
it is sensational value. I'd recommend this Tchaikovsky to any
collector. Ronan O'Hora plays, James Judd conducts. And, with the RPO,
they all go for it from bar one in a big-boned, red-blooded account.
Well-recorded, and grippingly played. Search this one out. Cracking
value.
Haydn, Military and Surprise Symphonies (Tring International)
* Ditto as above. Very good value. Stylish and elegant performances,
not for period instrument freaks, but rather classy all the same.
Compiled by ROB ADAMS
Spiritalk II -- Revelations, Kevin Eubanks (Blue Note)
* GUITARIST Eubanks's third Blue Note album features a strong cast,
including his trombonist brother, Robin. Dave Holland's supple bass and
Smitty Smith's crisp, propellant drumming form an ideal springboard for
Eubanks' airily athletic tunes. Things occasionally get a bit ponderous
(blame it on the flute), but Eubanks's fleet, edgy acoustic solos
provide more than ample compensation.
Folks, Paul Dunmall &amp; Paul Rogers (Slam)
* These Pauls are normally associated with the freer regions of jazz,
although Dunmall's work with Danny Thompson's Whatever should have
lessened the surprise of hearing 20 lovingly-played tunes (and one song
by Polly Bolton) from the English, Irish, and eastern European
traditions. Dunmall plays a variety of saxophones and clarinets plus
penny whistle, Rogers delivers firm, rich-toned double bass: the results
are charming in a rustic kind of way.

SHE started off by denying the whole purpose of our encounter.
''Basically I do not believe in the concept of having heroes or
heroines, because everyone has facets to their personality which are
creditable or discreditable,'' she said. ''The idea of a perfect person
whose example you try to follow would mean they are not really 100%
normal.''
There are times when you wonder about the task in hand. Why was I
buying this woman lunch? Apart from the fact that I have known her for
years, she is delightful company, we both come from small towns in
Lanarkshire, and I wanted her to tell me who her heroes and heroines
were. Fortunately, she proceeded to answer the question.
''Over the years I have seen my heroes and heroines come and go,'' she
said. ''I remember as a teenager in the sixties that John Kennedy was my
idol. Since then I have seen the feet of clay.''
Margaret Ewing, Parliamentary Leader of the SNP, has had two stints at
Westminster. The first was in the glory days when the party seemed to be
about to break the mould and Labour was legislating for devolution. As
Margaret Bain she represented Dunbartonshire East from 1974-9, and then
in 1987 returned again, this time for Moray. She comes from Biggar.
''When I think of special people and what they mean to me they tend to
be those closest to me and therefore top of the list would be my
parents, John and Peggie McAdam,'' she said. ''Dad's been dead for 11
years now and Mum is in residential care. The love and guidance and
support they gave me and my brother have probably made us the kind of
people we are. We were taught real values in life and maybe that is more
important than anything else.
''In the public domain, I have a great admiration for Dr Robert
McIntyre, who was our first MP, elected in 1945, for his guidance and
the stability he gave the party.
''There was my headmaster, James Shepherd, at Biggar High, who is now
dead. He persuaded me that I should go to university, and it was there
that I discovered the world.''
''I admire William Wallace because the whole issue of Scotland's
independence emanated from him. He was a true patriot. Every time I walk
through Westminster Hall I see the brass plaque that commemorates the
spot where he was sentenced to be hanged drawn, and quartered and it
constantly reminds me of the nation of Scotland and the dignity and
normality I want for the people of Scotland.
''I admire Napoleon because he seemed to be such a contradictory
figure, small in stature but extremely large in his aggression.''
She also cited the late Donald Stewart, who sat for the Western Isles.
''I still miss his political guidance,'' she said. ''He was a quiet,
gentle giant of a man, erudite, witty, and like a rock in the tumultuous
seas of politics at that time.''
We turned to the heroines. She started off with Joan of Arc. ''She was
incredibly brave, and she inspired people.''
Then she said she must include her mother-in-law, Winnie Ewing, MEP
for the Highlands and Islands, in her list, not because she was her
mother-in-law, but because it was Winnie who had given the confidence to
consider even being a parliamentary candidate.
''I admire Joy Hendry for her work in Scottish literature,'' she
continued. ''She is responsible for Chapman which is, I think, a
fascinating magazine because it affords opportunities to new poets and
writers and also assists in helping people to understand Scottish
literature and its roots in Scottish society.''
She said, however, that she did not want to single out one individual.
''I am more lost in admiration for all the unsung heroes and heroines
who care for the ill or the elderly, who put in hours raising funds for
charitable organisations, who look after the most fragile in society,
and do it because they genuinely care,'' she said. ''There are many
people who deserve to be honoured and respected whose names will never
be recorded in Who's Who. They are who I admire.''

THE Securities and Investments Board, the chief investment watchdog,
has launched a fresh enquiry into the misselling of personal pensions.
The life insurance industry already faces a #2000m bill to compensate
the estimated one-and-a-half million people in occupational pensions who
were wrongly sold personal pensions. Now the SIB wants to know how many,
mainly low paid workers, were wrongly advised to switch from the State
Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) to a personal pension.
Around two-and-a-half million people have deserted Serps for a
personal pension, so if the SIB does uncover evidence of misselling this
could prove to be another costly embarrassment for the life insurance
industry whose policyholders will eventually have to foot the bill.
Hopefully, these scandals will make life insurance companies much more
reticent in their claims for personal pensions. However, this shouldn't
sign their death warrant. Personal pensions remain one of the best ways
to provide for retirement, and anyone who is self-employed or not
covered by their employer's scheme should seriously consider having one
or even several plans.
The trouble with personal pensions is that the charges can be
complicated. In contrast, those on personal equity plans (PEPs) are much
more transparent. As a result, some advisers now advocate PEPs in
preference to personal pensions for the purposes of retirement planning.
PEPs are more flexible than personal pensions because you can sell
your shares at any time. But it is only pension contributions which
enjoy the benefit of tax relief at source.
There are two aspects to choosing a personal pension: charges and
investment performance. Since the beginning of the year life companies
have been required to disclose their charges. Before this change,
projections of future performance were virtually useless because you got
the same figure whichever company you asked. Now these projections allow
comparison of charges and this is a major step forward.
A recent survey by Money Marketing magazine showed big differences in
charges. For example, #100 a month invested in a personal pension for 25
years would give a lump sum of #19,109 after 10 years if the investments
grew by 9% a year.
Charges for a with-profits pension varied from #1409 at Equitable Life
to #3909 at London Life. Charges on unit-linked pensions varied between
#1415 at Professional Life, which only sells through fee-based financial
advisers, and #3558 at Royal Life.
But charges on their own don't tell the whole story. You can choose
the company with the lowest charges, but if it fails to make your money
grow, you could still end up with a poor pension. The trouble is that
past performance is no guarantee of what will happen in the future.
However, it is all we have to go on.
Two recent surveys, one from Planned Savings and the other from Money
Management, show just what a difference performance can make.
Planned Savings only looked at single premium personal pensions. For
example, a 65-year-old man retiring at the end of last year having
invested a lump sum of #5000 in a with-profits pension 20 years ago
could expect a pension fund of #92,862 from Standard Life, the best in
the survey, but only #48,596 from Royal Life, the worst performer over
this period.
Money Management, which looked at regular as well as single premium
plans, was also able to demonstrate wide variations in performance.
According to its survey, if that same 65-year-old man had been paying
#200 a month into a pension plan for the last 20 years, the best one --
from Axa Equity &amp; Law -- would have produced a pension fund of #347,017,
while the worst -- from Liverpool Victoria -- would have amounted to
just #177,101.
There are, however, problems with these surveys. For one thing, the
effect of different charging structures means that a company which does
well for someone paying #100 a month may not do so well at #200 a month,
and there are those which do better with single premiums than with
regular monthly plans and vice versa.
So Money Management is really putting its head on the block when it
comes up with its five and four-star best buys. Five-star ratings are
given to the following companies for regular premiums: Equitable Life,
Norwich Union, the commission-free range from Provident Life, Rothschild
Asset Management and Scottish Amicable. For single premiums they go to
Axa Equity &amp; Law, National Mutual, NPI, Norwich Union and Sun Life.
Four-star ratings for regular premiums go to Abbey Life and Scottish
Equitable, and for single premiums to Scottish Amicable.
To qualify for five-star status at least half of the company's funds,
including the principal managed fund, must have above average
performance over five years and below average charges up to retirement
and on transfer values. Four-star companies must meet the same criteria
with the exception of low charges on transfer values.
For copies of these surveys contact: Money Management, Third Floor,
Maple House, 149 Tottenham Court Road, London W1P 9LL; Planned Savings,
33-39 Bowling Green Lane, London EC1R 0DA; Money Marketing, St Giles
House, 50 Poland Street, London W1V 4AX.

THE Bundesbank's interest rate pill resuscitated the dollar for less
than 24 hours -- an indication of how sick the patient is. By last night
financial markets were in turmoil again.
Overnight in Far Eastern markets the dollar tumbled again despite
repeated intervention by the Bank of Japan, which also took action to
force short-term interest rates lower. But there was disappointment that
the Japanese central bank did not cut its official discount rate from
1.75% to 1.25%.
The Tokyo stock market shed 2.25% of its value. Japanese companies
cannot profit with the yen so strong.
Shortly after US markets opened the dollar was posting a fresh
post-war low against the yen, and Wall Street was in free fall.
Inflationary fears raised their ugly head again after revised figures
showed that the American economy grew at an annualised 5.1% in the final
quarter of last year, much stronger than the 4.6% previously estimated
by the Commerce Department.
This played havoc with bond markets, and within 15 minutes of Wall
Street opening the Dow-Jones index had posted a fall of nearly 60
points, bringing into effect the New York Stock Exchange's automatic
restrictions on computer programme trading.
All of this was too much for UK financial markets which had been
heartened by the Bundesbank move. Share prices went into reverse and the
FTSE-100 lost 38.3 points to 3137.9, though at the time the Dow seemed
to be over the worst.
The pound was caught in the the crossfire on foreign exchange markets.
Britain's strong trading links with North America expose it to the
fallout from currency crises.
Sterling shed 3.11 pfennigs to DM2.2267, but gained 2.76 cents to
$1.6264 amid extremely volatile trading conditions. The trade weighted
index retreated from 85.6 to 85.3. To all intents and purposes the
benefits of the Bundesbank rate cut had disappeared into the night.
Rumours abounded that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates
later in the session to defend the dollar and that the Bank of Japan
would cut its official discount rate on Sunday.
The Fed denied it had any plans to issue a statement or call a press
conference. The effect of this was to drive the dollar even lower
against the yen. At one point it dropped to 86.30, more than three yen
down on Thursday night's New York close. The dollar also lost more than
four pfennigs to DM1.3680., taking it below its level when the
Bundesbank cut its rates.
The pundits are betting that the Bank of Japan will act soon, perhaps
even this weekend, but it is not clear that even this would stabilise
the dollar. Action to reduce rates in two continents cannot provide a
lasting palliative for the endemic problems of a third.
The source of the trouble is America's twin deficits. The US
authorities have turned a blind eye to the mounting budget and trade
deficits. The huge deficit with Japan is at the root of the dollar's
chronic weakness and yen are needed to finance the shortfall between
Federal spending and revenues. The financial prudence being practised in
the Chancellories of Europe is not evident on the other side of the
Atlantic.
All the time the dollar has been in full retreat in the face of the
might of the yen and the German mark, its relative strength against the
Canadian dollar and the devalued Mexican peso has plagued American
business whose commercial ties with its nearest neighbours have been
strengthened by the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Raw materials are priced in dollars, providing a valuable hedge
against the risks other nations face of a devaluation sparking off an
inflationary bout.
The impression has grown up in financial markets that the US
authorities are indifferent to the plight of the dollar. Attempts to
resuscitate its fortunes by Fed support operations have been
half-hearted and ill-timed, and so far no interest-rate prop has been
offered in times of currency crisis.
Indeed earlier this week the Fed's open market committee stayed its
hand on rates in the hope that the domestic economy was slowing down.
Unless American attitudes change the dollar crisis could run and run.

BOOTS has exchanged contracts with BASF for the sale of its
pharmaceutical business for #840m cash. There may be an adjustment to
the final sum paid over depending on whether there is any difference
between net assets at March 31, 1994, and March 31, 1995.
In addition, Boots is to receive payment of $230m (#141.2m) in respect
of part of the cash balance held by Boots Pharamceuticals Puerto Rico
which BASF will acquire.
The decision to sell the pharmaceutical business followed an in-depth
review of its activities following the withdrawal of its heart drug
Manoplax from the market because of possible side-effects.
The intention to sell the business was disclosed last November along
with a #500m payout to shareholders following a share buy-in programme
by Boots.
Boots Pharmaceuticals employs 5750 people worldwide including many at
its headquarters in Nottingham. Turnover attributable to the business
being sold was #430m and operating profit before exceptional items was
#79m in the financial year to March 31, 1994. Net assets for the
disposed business were about #230m at that date.
Commenting on the deal, Sir James Blyth, deputy chairman and chief
executive of Boots, said that he believed that it was right for
shareholders and staff. ''In this fast-changing industry a business of
its size would have great difficulty in sustaining competitive
advantage.''
In any case Boots' expertise is in retailing where it has leading
market positions in many product categories in the UK.
The pharmaceutical industry is arguably going through even more change
than retail and so it makes sense for Boots to exit from the
pharmaceutical market. Increasingly only the largest players will be
able to afford to do the research and development to discover truly
innovative products and market them worldwide.
Boots did not have the world-class R&amp;D pipeline which would have
warranted its board holding on to the pharmaceuticals division. BASF,
which has made no secret of the fact that it wished to expand its
activities in the UK, is better placed to provide the investment
resources necessary to further develop the business.
Up until now BASF's Knoll drugs division has focused on cheaper
generic drugs. BASF chairman Juergen Strube called the purchase an
''important strategic step''. BASF Pharmaceuticals posted total sales of
around DM2000m (#896m) in 1994.

The animals don't often come in peacefully two by two at Anna
Meredith's Edinburgh Zoo practice. As there is always the possibility
that the giant cassowaries might just rip a vet's technique to shreds,
the exotic patients are lured with treats or unceremoniously darted in
the rump, as George Hume discovers
ANNA Meredith really likes Wednesdays. Rain or shine she drives to
work, zips through the big cast-iron gates, up the brae and over
sleeping policemen sufficient to form a force of their own. Whatever the
day holds she knows it will be a challenge. ''It's wonderful. I love
it,'' she says as she prepares to do her rounds in gumboots and
windcheater: a pill for a particularly hirsute patient, a thorough
medical check-up for another that has the hump, to say nothing of the
opportunity to shoot an old boy in the backside or wing a feisty young
bird in the drumstick. Zoo veterinary work really is different.
A hyena with a headache, a snake with a sneeze, a tapir that has lost
its squeak in the undergrowth -- all in a day's work. ''The reward is
being confronted by an endless variety, learning with wild and wonderful
creatures that never cease to amaze. Many are endangered species. If an
animal is sick and I can get it well I am playing my part in
conservation.''
Then there is Cindy. Cindy is a mother first, a chimpanzee second, and
a co-operative patient not at all. When Ann Meredith tried to dart her
-- the mother to be put to sleep for a few minutes so that the baby
could be removed from her arms and treated for pneumonia -- Cindy was on
her mettle. As the dart with the knock-out flew across her cage -- ''it
was going so fast that I certainly couldn't see it'', says Anna Meredith
-- Cindy reached out, caught it in mid-air and hurled it straight back.
''Luckily she missed or I would have been put to sleep,'' says the vet
whose skills embrace, in addition to ducking and weaving, every kind of
zoo and exotic animal from rodents to rhinos. Thoughtfully she works out
her weight in relation to that of a chimpanzee to calculate just how
long her unsought snooze would have lasted had Cindy's over-arm bowling
been up to the mark.
A visit to Edinburgh on a holiday eight years ago convinced Anna
Meredith that the first place she wanted to be was Scotland's capital:
the second, she knew, was a zoo. ''I joined a small mixed practice in
Edinburgh -- that is to say, small animals and equine -- and helped out
at the zoo on days off. I was always interested in zoo work but knew it
was likely to be no more than an interest unless I was lucky.''
But a vacancy due to retirement came about at the Royal Zoological
Park three years ago and, with a lectureship in zoo and exotic-animal
medicine at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies under her
white coat together with degrees in physiology and veterinary medicine
from Oxford and Cambridge Universities respectively, Anna Meredith won
the day.
And what a day it can be . . . creatures from the cuddly to the
creepy, some with the limpid eyes of puppies, others with teeth like
six-inch nails and the temperament to use them. First on the day's
schedule might be a vasectomy for a polar bear then a queue of chaps on
their way either to or from a formal dinner in identical starched shirts
and black-jacket outfits, 92 of them. They have called round to have
tiny transponder chips fitted under their coats so that Edinburgh Zoo's
Gentoo penguin population can, with a quick scan, be individually
recognised.
Penguins on the make will no longer be able to con the keepers that
they have not had their fair share of fish and, more to the point, when
beaks and flippers are measured during health checks the zoo will know
whose beak and whose flippers. Most of the zoo's penguins are descended
from stock brought back from South Atlantic 30 years ago by whalers of
the Christian Salvesen company. New stock was only introduced as
recently as 1992 when eggs were brought from the Falklands.
''Each penguin now has a number which can be read by a hand-held
scanner. The keepers will be able to tell exactly which penguin is which
-- its history and health record. Otherwise, very difficult,'' says Anna
Meredith, whose first task on taking up her zoo job was to apply to the
police for a firearms certificate so that she could use the two dart
guns necessary for zoo work. She does not claim the crack-shot skills of
an Annie Oakley but says modestly, Cindy being a bizarre exception: ''I
have never missed yet.'' Practice on targets in safe woodland behind the
zoo is the basis of her marksmanship -- bull's-eye proof that zoo
veterinary work is more than just a stethoscope and nerves of steel.
Not all animals have to be darted before they can be treated but many
must be knocked out for their own good as well as the safety of vet and
keepers alike. Birds, for example, can generally be treated while being
held by a keeper. But you will not catch Anna Meredith trying that
cuddly technique on a cassowary, an ostrich-like bird which does not
have its head in the sand when it is down to coping with the species
that comes bearing veterinary skills.
Cassowaries are equipped with a big spike on their feet, no less than
a spear, and come with what the Americans call ''attitude''. ''They will
simply rip you right down the front and therefore have to be darted
before anyone can get close. I simply dart into its drumstick,'' says
Anna Meredith as matter-of-factly as a GP who uses toffees to distract
small boys from the sting of iodine.
The 149 species at Edinburgh Zoo are covered by five broad headings --
birds and small mammals, carnivores, hoof stock, reptiles, and primates.
''A large part of the challenge of working here is that one has always
got to go back to basics. The detail of exotic animals is simply not
taught. But, at the end of the day, a mammal is a mammal and a bird is a
bird although the anatomy and the blood may be different. There are
fundamental similarities and some differences.''
The differences in some cases are of a kind that do not need a vet to
spot. We all know that individual members of the same species, though
sometimes the opposite sex, are frequently not as bright as their mates.
Anna Meredith's current real live example of the genre is to be found in
the caged enclosure that is home to gorillas Yinka and Kumba, female and
male of the species respectively.
Animals of size and power such as Yinka and Kumba are temporarily put
to sleep not only because it is safer that way for zoo staff but
primarily because a knock-out delivery is less stressful to the animal
that has to be examined than being held firmly, possibly attempting to
struggle, in order to be given an injection. New methods of getting a
sleep-inducing drug into zoo animals are being experimented with and
Anna Meredith is currently working to get Yinka and Kumba to reach into
a tube in which a food reward is to be found at the end -- in their
case, peanuts -- as well as a hidden needle. One prick from that and,
five to ten minutes later, time for a snooze.
So far Kumba has performed to order, fallen for the trick, gone for
the peanuts, suffered a quick jag and wound up out for the count. Yinka,
on the other hand, has given the food tube a wide berth notwithstanding
the blandishment of free peanuts. Says Anna Meredith, with not a little
respect for feminine perspicacity: ''I don't think she is as stupid as
he is.''
Other large animals, however, are not to be won over by the promise of
a mere handful of nuts and have to be confronted head-on -- or in one
particular case, the reverse. Kruger is the zoo's male rhino with skin
half an inch thick and the texture of linoleum. Given that there is no
enthusiasm on the part of zoo staff to try their hand at getting Kruger
in a cross-buttock and throw, it is definitely dart time when he is down
for a visit from the vet. Anna Meredith admits that rhinos, viewed from
the rear, present an easy target.
Research going forward at the zoo is of special interest to Anna
Meredith who, in addition to her duties as a lecturer and in the busy
practice at Edinburgh Zoo also contributes to learned journals and, on
the lighter side, appears from time to time on the children's TV
magazine programme What's Up Doc? Free time, such as there is of that,
is spent with Ralph and Eddie, cross-bred dogs of a loving disposition
not to be found in cassowaries . . . except, possibly, when other
cassowaries are involved.
With what emotion do vets whose work is wholly in small-animal
practice -- a round of dogs, cats, and gerbils -- view her daily
challenge of rhino and rat, bear and boa constrictor? ''With jealousy,''
is her immediate response. ''Remember, one is trained to be either a
large or a small-animal vet but never a zoo vet. A zoo is specialist by
not being specialised. If an animal needs, say, dental or orthopaedic
treatment then I will call in the expert in that field. Otherwise it is
challenge all the way.
''The very thing about being a vet here, apart from the variety and
the challenge, is that there is a very relaxed atmosphere: all these
exotic animals with no neurotic owners . . . believe me, I don't miss
them.''

MOST people running companies in Scotland will have had experience at
one time or another of placements: taking in someone temporarily so they
can learn more about the world of business.
The majority of placement subjects are students seeking work
experience, either from secondary schools or FE colleges and
universities. These are not all young people. There are a growing number
of women now going through courses designed to help them return to the
job market after surviving the children.
For those frustrated graduates unable to find employment there is a
widening range of schemes funded by local enterprise companies to
provide basic training followed by placements of up to six months to
carry out specific assignments in companies.
And still there's more. Teachers at both primary and secondary schools
are being encouraged to seek work placements to make them more aware of
the culture of business and enterprise as well as to give them
experience of the pressures and opportunities facing their pupils.
One way or another, companies are coming under growing pressure to
take in people for periods ranging from a day to as much as a year.
At first sight it seems like a lot to ask -- taking in a stranger,
usually unfamiliar with the company's products or markets and often
completely new to the world of business, and then finding something
productive for them to tackle. Inevitably there is a commitment of time
required from senior management, and probably some disruption in the
host department.
For larger companies this is not such a big deal. Most are familiar
with the process and, in the general belief that it is part of their
broader responsibility to the community, have established procedures to
cope. For smaller businesses, it is a different matter and requires
considerable planning. It is not a commitment to accept lightly. Indeed,
I suspect more managers are these days automatically refusing any
placement requests because they do not want the hassle.
They don't know what they are missing. Handled correctly, the right
placement subjects can make as substantial an impact on a business as a
consultant -- and at a fraction of the cost. Listen to this story, about
the rapidly growing Dundee-based convenience store chain Morning, Noon
and Night.
Chief executive Eddie Thompson took a marketing graduate on placement
and decided to set her to work doing something that few companies bother
with these days -- asking customers and non-customers in the street what
they thought about the company's stores. Her report was an eye-opener,
highlighting numerous deficiencies in staff training and customer
service procedures which the energetic Thompson immediately set to
rights.
I have heard many similar stories. In our company we must have had
half-a-dozen placements over the past three years and not one was a
waste of time. The most complex was a group of four women returners from
Queen Margaret College in Edinburgh who over a month put together a
large-scale and most useful piece of market research on one of our
information publications.
The simplest was a trainee graphic designer who slotted into our
visual communications department and produced excellent work for a
month, initially under supervision but then operating almost entirely on
her own initiative. Both parties were so happy with the arrangement that
she is coming in for a few days over the Easter holidays to help cover a
busy spell.
As ever, you get out of the placement process what you put in. Every
growing business has areas where it needs help and advice, but under the
daily pressure no-one finds time to organise it. I'd be willing to bet
that with 10 minutes thought just about every owner-manager could come
up with a project to improve a part of the business.
There are a large number of bright, capable people out there,
desperate to find out what it is like to work in a modern business. They
are available often at a cost only of time.
To find out who and what is on offer, contact your local college,
university or enterprise company. LECs can put you in touch with the
formal education business partnership in your area, an organisation
responsible for building bridges between companies and schools including
placing teachers.
Try the power of placements for yourself. I wholeheartedly recommend
it.

If you think the pound is a risky business these days, the cracks were
much harder to paper over in times gone by, finds Liz Taylor
HAD IT not been for the mismanagement and dishonesty of a few men,
Glasgow, not Edinburgh, would today be the financial capital of
Scotland. In the mid-nineteenth century, there was more money and
enterprise in Glasgow than in the capital, and banks and finance houses
in both cities were intensely jealous of each other. Edinburgh was being
relegated to second position by the 1850s, but then the first signs of
West Coast instability came.
In 1857 the Western Bank of Scotland collapsed owing the monumental
sum of #8,911,932. The bank had expanded too quickly and was speculating
heavily in railway shares (the futures market of the time). When it went
down many shareholders and depositors were ruined and the confidence of
the public was badly shaken.
However, Edinburgh's claim to head the Scottish financial world
continued to be disputed until 1878, when the prestigious City of
Glasgow Bank went down. Its collapse makes the Baring business look like
a small disturbance, because the City of Glasgow lost #6.25m, a
horrendous sum in those days. The effect on the city was profound, and
there was a highly-publicised trial of the bank's board of directors,
Robert Stronach, Robert Salmond, John Wright, Lewis Potter, William
Taylor, and Charles Leresche. They all went to jail after being
convicted of criminal mismanagement.
Within five years limited liability was introduced for all banks as a
protection for the public, but ordinary Scottish people took a long time
to forget their distrust of banks and preferred hiding their money under
the mattress. With low or nil inflation that didn't matter so much as it
would today.
This story is being retold because this afternoon an auction sale of
more than 300 lots of Scottish cheques and banknotes is to be held in
the Roxburghe Hotel, Charlotte Square, Edinburgh. Among the items on
offer are some unused Western Bank of Scotland and City of Glasgow
cheques with counterfoils. The price of around #30 is expected for the
lot. Banknotes from either of the ruined banks are extremely rare, but
there is an 1871 City of Glasgow Bank pound note in the sale and a price
of around #300 is expected.
The collecting of banknotes is a relatively new enthusiasm, because it
only began to attract serious attention in 1982. Today's sale is
conducted by a Carlisle-based company called Banking Memorabailia,
headed by Trevor Jones, who is a mine of information and enthusiasm
about everything relating to paper money.
At first sight the catalogue for his sale looks incomprehensible to
someone not versed in the terminology of banknote collecting but when Mr
Jones begins to explain things, the fascination unspendable folding
money can hold becomes much clearer.
It turns out that, like many things in the collecting world, condition
is of supreme importance and if a banknote was kept under the mattress
and never spent, so much the better.
One of the favourite notes sought by collectors is what Mr Jones calls
a ''horse blanket''. They were big, very big. ''Do you remember the old
black and white fivers?'' he asked. ''Well a horse blanket makes an old
fiver look a luncheon voucher. Some were almost as big as an A4 sheet of
paper and they were issued in denominations of #5 and above by the Royal
Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland in the days when money was
money.
''Anyone with a horse blanket note in their pocket really felt rich.''
There are several more modestly-sized ten-shilling notes also on offer
and Mr Jones said that one of them was sent for auction by a man who
received it as part of his first pay packet in 1947 and never spent it.
Today, because it is in crisp condition, it could be worth around #8.
Mr Jones said that up until the Second World War working men's wages
were paid in ten shilling-notes and silver because larger-denomination
notes were meant to be spent only by ''gentlemen''. Because ten-shilling
notes were therefore subjected to more use than larger denominations
they are now rarer to find in good condition.
Other rare items are guinea notes, which some Scottish banks issued in
the nineteenth century. These notes were apparently very popular in
Dumfries because in the short life of the Dumfries Commercial Bank
(1804-08) there were three separate guinea issues and only one #5 issue.
Notes issued by that bank are particularly attractively designed and a
guinea one in the sale is estimated at around #200.
Another bank that issued guinea notes was the Leith Banking Company
and one of theirs dating from 1825 is reckoned by Mr Jones to be among
the most attractive Scottish notes of the period. Its estimated price is
between #110 and #130.
Then, as now, banknotes attracted the admiration of forgers and Mr
Jones has an example of a possible forgery in his sale. It is a #1 note
issued by the bank of Sir William Forbes, J Hunter and Co, in 1822 and
Mr Jones said: ''Scottish forgeries of that period are very interesting
because they are hard to spot.
''We think that there were two men operating together, one doing the
manuscript work and other producing vignettes or pictorial elements. The
manuscript work is always very very good but errors can be spotted in
the vignettes and that was where they fell down.''
Illegality of that forgery in 1822 -- which would probably have earned
the culprits a sentence of transportation to Australia at least --
doesn't matter now and the forged note carries the respectable price of
around #70 today.
* WATCH out for ''Galle'' glass that is not what it seems. With the
opening up of Eastern Europe, it is suspected that glass which so
closely resembles genuine Galle it can confuse experts, is coming on the
market.
According to a London dealer, the Eastern Europeans mark their glass
with a distinctive stamp but somewhere along the line, this stamp is
often eliminated and the glass offered as real Galle.
Emil Galle, who founded the Nancy school of glassmaking, was born in
1846. He trained as a designer and was much influenced by a Japanese art
which was a craze in Paris in the 1860s. His glassware owes much to this
Japanese influence because he decorated pastel-coloured vases and bowls
with relief flowers and foliage.
He signed all his pieces. After his death in 1904, his factory
continued in operation, but a star was added to his name. Production
finally ceased in 1931.
Typical recent prices for a Galle glass include around #600 for a
glass case about 16cm high overlaid with brambles on a smoky pink
background, and aboaut #1500 for a 30cm high flask-shaped vase overlaid
with a pattern of trees on a smoky matt background.

Lesley Duncan goes on a hunt for a tasteful gas fire -- and is left
cold by the selection on offer
WE BOUGHT our house off the drawing-board 14 years ago. Beguiled by
the builders' motif of bob-tailed bunny, we omitted to check that the
gas-centrally-heated dwelling would come complete with chimney and
fireplace. It didn't. By the time we realised this, it was too late to
incorporate the joint feature. We were months in the house before the
gas heating (an experimental high-pressure system and itself the subject
of various alarms) was functional -- but that's another story. We
quickly realised our sitting-room needed extra heating as well as the
focal point of a fireplace.
Without a chimney, we had the grand choice of one model. Only one
design on the market worked with a ''balanced flue'' -- which seemed to
consist of a hole knocked through the outer wall of the house to take
away noxious gases, while the gas-heated elements of the fire were
sealed off by glass.
Had the fire been a plain utilitarian sort of thing it would have been
acceptable, even if it was perched up the wall (a safety factor,
evidently) and was fed by a primitive gas pipe which was always at risk
of being dunted by the Hoover. But the school of unaesthetic design had
really put their best effort into it. Its stainless-steel grille was
behind safety bars which made dusting a nightmare. It had a mantel of
hideous beaten mock-bronze. The optional extra of ''coal-effect'' had
been easy to resist.
We learned to live with our monster. And to be fair it has proved an
efficient heater. However, with redecorating in mind, I have been
checking the alternatives now on the market.
As with so many things in life, it is much easier to say what one
doesn't like than what one does. High in my list of dislikable
characteristics is the ubiquitous black of today's consumer durables,
electronic and other. In a low-ceilinged house with pastel decor of mint
greens and creams and pinks what could be more obtrusive, except perhaps
tawdry twiddles of brass and pseudo-brass?
Sadly, black surrounds and brass in abundance decorate the current
range of fires in British Gas showrooms -- those designed for chimneys
as well as balanced flues. There are only a handful of models for
balanced flues. Five are of the stove design -- three by Valor, one by
Cannon, and Robinson Willey's Salisbury Turbo. The plainest, and ergo
the least ugly, of them is Valor's Flamenco which costs #429.99 with a
#105 installation charge. It can be surrounded by a conventional
fireplace (distantly-Adam and marble effects are popular) or set on the
wall. The incongruity of a fake coal-fire blazing amid the wallpaper is
lost on the manufacturers who illustrate just such a scenario in their
brochure.
My second choice would be the Salisbury Turbo at #499.99. Its brown
casing looks less harsh than the black, at least in the brochure. It has
a log-effect instead of coal. It also has had the brass treatment.
The alternative is a complete installation of fire, fireplace, and
surround. There is one model, Royal Cozyfires' Royal Harmony. In theory
this should be the answer to my search but its looks do not appeal. The
wooden surround (oak or mahogany effect) seems unnecessarily elaborate,
ditto the decorative tiling (available in several floral patterns which
would look all right in a plainer context). The fire canopy and grate
are black. Ditto, of course, the mock coal. The concept is fine; the
design overloaded. The price is #1299.99 plus #135 installation charge.
Removing the Victorian flourishes would, doubtless, have little effect
on the cost, which is basically for the model's technical features, but
how one sighs for simplicity. So the hunt goes on. Perhaps in
Scandinavia they do things better.
Meanwhile I did spot a fire I would have bought had I possessed a
chimney. At #189.99 the Brava by Potterton Myson does not pretend to
anything other than functionalism, and has svelte, modern lines, a
handsome mahagony casing, and not a hint of brass.
* My recent mention of ceramic Nessies in an article on Scottish
souvenirs has prompted the information that Highbank Porcelain of
Lochgilphead, Argyll, make the beasties (retailing about #9.95).

SOMETIMES the story of how this company or that came to have a
presence in Scotland owes much more to chance encounters than rational
strategic planning. When International Business Machines decided to open
its original plant in Greenock in 1951, the decision to investigate a
Lower Clydeside location owed much to the friendship between Tom Watson,
the son of IBM's founder, and Hector McNeil, the local Labour MP.
The pair had forged a strong bond when they met at the United Nations
in New York. But when Watson toured the Greenock waterfront looking at
redundant shipyard sites which might house an IBM plant he was
unimpressed. Only after lunch, when the official party was driving
through the narrow Spango Valley, south of the town, did Watson's
interest rise.
''Stop the car. What's that over there?'' he demanded, pointing to an
isolated farm beneath the dour hill face. And then, reportedly with only
a few moments of reflection, he announced: ''We shall build our new
plant there.''
The construction group Mowlem is one of the oldest in the UK. It
incorporated a subsidiary, Mowlem Scotland, in 1945, exactly 50 years
ago this month. And the story of how it first came here, a few years
before that, holds many echoes of how IBM came to build a presence in
Greenock.
In the thirties, the Beck family was very influential in the running
of the business. Sir Edgar Beck had been to Scotland on a fishing trip.
On the way south on the train, he fell into conversation with a Mr
Goodbody, who owned a hunting lodge at Invergarry.
The train was late and Mr Goodbody was becoming more and more fretful.
He had business interests in the States. From London, he was due to
travel to Southampton and board a liner bound for New York. With every
hour of delay, that timetable was slipping through his fingers.
Sir Edgar stepped into the breach. The Mowlem car awaiting the train
was despatched, with Goodbody aboard, for the port. By all reports its
passenger made it to the ship as the gangplank was about to be removed.
When he returned from his trip, the grateful Goodbody showed his
appreciation by offering Mowlem some work.
Would the company like to undertake the refurbishment of that Scottish
hunting lodge, Invergarry House? That was Mowlem's first job in
Scotland, completed just before war broke out. ''And on the basis of
that we've remained here ever since,'' says Colin Sutherland, Mowlem
Scotland's managing director. Indeed, registering a separate Scottish
company in 1945, now headquartered at Kilsyth, makes Mowlem Scotland one
of our more senior citizens in corporate terms.
But advancing age does not imply any decline in the corporate
faculties. To bring the IBM allusion full circle, Mowlem's latest big
Scottish contract is for a futuristic #15m leisure complex for the
Inverclyde waterfront to be built on that same Greenock foreshore
rejected by IBM all those years ago.
A complex structure redolent of the exposed ribs of the kind of ships
once built there, an 80-week delivery time, and the fact that this is a
key element in the regeneration of Greenock's waterfront all go to make
this a major challenge for Mowlem Scotland. But that, say Sutherland and
his business development manager Brian Jukes, is what the business has
been about ever since it restored Invergarry House.
One key to the company's longevity has been its ability to forsee
trends in construction and try to alter its balance of contracts
accordingly. In the early years Mowlem Scotland was a major player in
the war effort, building airfields and flying-boat stations. ''We
probably did #80m in today's money on airfield work during the war,''
says Sutherland.
Machrahanish, Kinloss, Turnhouse and Renfrew all figured on the list.
And defence-related work continued to be a mainstay for decades after
the war. RAF Saxa Ford in the far north was one eighties example. Even
today, that expertise in airfield construction has spilled over into the
civil side, with Mowlem about to start its fifth contract at Edinburgh
airport.
After the war, one major challenge was the building of the Hunterston
A Magnox nuclear power station. But the company was also to be found
building hydro schemes in the Highlands. ''But if we'd simply
concentrated on these areas, we would have been left with no work
today,'' says Jukes. ''We've had to adapt to changing markets.''
One feature of that change has been a conscious determination to
replace a few very large projects, with a heavy civil engineering bias,
with a much more diversified range of contracts. ''At any one time
now,'' says Sutherland, ''we have between 20 and 25 jobs live on site.
We will handle up to 40 contracts a year.''
Housebuilding was tried and abandoned in the sixties and seventies.
Mowlem was once a leading hard-rock tunnelling company. But that was
another market which dried up. The Scottish arm was involved in driving
roads in the local deep coalfield, but that too has gone.
In their place is a diverse portfolio of jobs, embracing the
healthcare sector, education and leisure centres, of which Greenock
marks a significant new chapter. Rebuilding the St Enoch underground
station in the late seventies, by jacking the historic ticketing office
on stilts, shows an early flair for innovative techniques. The site
agent was so confident he kept his own office in the building while it
stood on its pillars.
Mowlem came here by chance. But it has stayed by choice. Happy
fiftieth birthday.
One key to Mowlem Scotland's longevity has been its ability to forsee
trends in construction and try to alter its balance of contracts
accordingly

NET consumer credit rose from a revised #527m to #601m in February on
the back of an upturn in retail sales and an upsurge of credit card
borrowing, according to Bank of England figures yesterday, writes R E
DUNDAS.
Despite the half-point increase in base rates to 6.75% at the start of
the month consumers appeared relaxed about borrowing to support their
lifestyles.
A jump in credit card borrowing from #98m to #168m was the main factor
behind the higher level of net consumer credit. The figures were thought
to reflect a 2% increase in spending on clothing and footwear in
February.
However, lending by other specialist retailers fell back from #123m to
#90m despite strong car sales. Lending by retailers also dropped from
#46m to #37m, but the banks increased their dominant share with their
lending rising by #119m to #462m.
Higher credit car lending accounted for #70m of the increase, but the
banks and other lenders were also active in offering competitively
priced fixed-rate term loans.
City analysts thought that the strong credit figures would be added to
the Bank's list of factors likely to justify another increase in
interest rates, most likely in May.

THE motoring world might have been different today if it had not been
for the fact that Kwik-Fit boss Tom Farmer is colour blind. Speaking at
the Tall Ships dinner in Edinburgh's Carlton Highland Hotel, he revealed
that as a young man his ambition had been to join the Navy, but he was
rejected because of his colour blindness.
The Kwik-Fit chairman, who has been appointed ambassador for the Tall
Ships Race when it visits Edinburgh in July, mused that he might have
become a captain if he had been accepted. He told his audience that
coming from Leith his family had connections with the sea and that his
father had been a shipping agent.
He called on the Edinburgh business community to support the #250,000
appeal by the organisers of the Tall Ships event, delighting the latter
when he said his own company would start the ball rolling by
contributing #25,000. One of the organisers of the evening told Business
Diary: ''He took us all completely by surprise. We did not know he
planned to do this.''
He also raised a few eyebrows when he remarked that he was enjoying
being an ambassador and wondered, with all the talk about devolution in
the air, if he might one day become a Scottish ambassador.
If Prime Minister John Major hears any more of that kind of talk one
thing is certain: Tom Farmer will be struck off his breakfast meetings
list.
Gas comes under
fire at dinner
EDINBURGH was a busy place last week for dinners, and the capital's
Lord Provost Norman Irons caused some surprise when he replied on behalf
of the guests at the British Gas dinner in the Signet Library aimed at
''establishing Scottish Gas in the the Scottish community''.
The SNP Lord Provost took the opportunity to make clear his personal
views on the British Gas decision not to site any of its five divisional
headquarters in Scotland. A number of British Gas executives were
squirming in their seats as he described his own, and many other
people's, unhappiness at its corporate policy.
I spoke to him after the event and he told me that when British Gas
had invited him to respond on behalf of the guests, he had said that he
would make his personal views known. ''British Gas did explain how much
they supported Scotland, and mentioned their support for Scottish junior
football, but I told them that much as this was welcomed, it was not the
same as having a corporate headquarters in this country.''
But, despite his criticisms, he left the dinner on good terms with
Norman Blacker, executive director of British Gas, who also attended.
Royal invasion
force tees off
IAN Valentine, managing partner of chartered accountant BDO Stoy
Hayward, will not be able to present his financial report to the annual
general meeting of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in
Glasgow on Friday because other duties call. He is the convenor of the
ICAS Finance and General Purposes Committee and in this position should
have presented the report.
However, he is also this year's captain of Royal Troon Golf Club, a
position which also makes certain demands, and torn between his sense of
duty to both he felt he had to give priority to Royal Troon.
This means that instead of being in Glasgow next Friday he will be in
Perth, Australia attending the centenary celebrations of the Royal Perth
Golf Club.
Before departing Down Under with his wife Elaine, he reflected sadly
on his absence from the ICAS agm: ''There are 30 Royal Golf Clubs
throughout the world, mainly in the Commonwealth countries, and the
captains of each of them have been invited to celebrate the centenary.
It was an invitation I didn't think I could turn down.''
His absence should not prove disastrous though, as Business Diary is
confident there will still be one or two members available who are used
to presenting a set of accounts.
Ian Valentine, of course, will not be a Scot alone when he is in
Western Australia.
Royal Dornoch is sending its vice-president Dr John Grant and member
James Asher, and the Royal Burgess Golfing Society will have its captain
David Walker and member Ian Watt in attendance. The St Andrews Royal and
Ancient Golf Club is being represented by the Hon JM Lindsay Bethune, a
past captain, and Royal Musselburgh is sending council member Bobby
Robertson.
With all these Scots looking for a game of golf, the Aussies had
better watch out.
Cashing in on
Scottish tourism
BUSINESS Diary readers will recall that last week we described how
Scottish Tourist Board chairman Ian Grant, public relations director
Grahame Birse and piper Willie Cochrane were off on a whirlwind tour of
the US visiting Boston, Chicago and New York in the space of four days.
The trio have now returned safely to Scotland from their trip. It was
aimed at taking advantage of the launch of the film Rob Roy to promote
Scotland as a holiday destination and went very well. Grahame Birse
admits to being amused when he read in Premiere movie magazine that the
film was a ''Scottish swordfest starring Liam Neeson in a skirt''.
On a more serious tourist note, Tourism Training Scotland held a
conference this week in Glasgow's Hilton Hotel aimed at exploring how
training and staff development could help Scottish tourism compete
internationally.
TTS took Ireland and Canada as the role models for the conference,
both of them having largely overcome similar problems to those facing
the Scottish tourist industry.
There is no doubt a well trained staff would help the Scots industry,
but so would the type of budget the Irish board enjoys. Ireland plans to
spend #60m a year on its tourist industry over the next 10 years, while
the Scottish Tourist Board has this year a mere #18.5m in comparison --
no wonder Irish eyes are smiling.
Marching on
their stomachs
GUESTS at next week's annual dinner of Scottish Engineering in the
Glasgow Hilton should not be surprised if the top table come in the ''by
the left, quick march''!
After all, Howard Jordan, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, is
brigadier of the Army Cadet Force in Scotland, and the principal guest,
Lord Trefgarne of the Engineering Training Authority, is also
vice-chairman of the Army Cadet Force Association in the UK. In
addition, he is a former Minister of State for Defence Procurement and
Minister of State at the DTI.
Among the other guests attending will be MPs Allan Stewart and Adam
Ingram, while Dr George Bennett of Motorola and Allan McLuckie of
Fullarton Computer Industries will be waving the industry flag. Noel
Davies, president of the Engineering Employers' Federation, is also
coming to Glasgow for the event.
Marathon effort
for hospice
PR man Ken Stein certainly goes to some lengths to keep his clients
happy. Tomorrow he is running in the London marathon to raise #300 for
the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in Glasgow, which is a Beattie
Media client.
He should have no difficulty completing the course as he has already
run in the event twice before and Sunday's outing will be his 24th
marathon.
Meanwhile, one of his colleagues at Beattie Media will be pounding a
different kind of surface when he appears on stage as the second male
lead in the musical comedy Irene at Motherwell Civic Theatre with the
Motherwell and Wishaw Amateur Operatic Society this weekend.

No need to get to get all hot and cross in the kitchen when making
seasonal buns. Dried yeast will ensure that they rise to the occasion
says Lady Claire Macdonald
WHEN I think of seasonal food I don't just bring to mind fruit,
vegetables, and game, but into the seasonal category in my mind come
seasonal dishes. As we approach Easter I drool at the prospect of eating
hot cross buns -- I love them. But hot cross buns have been available in
the supermarkets for weeks now. I saw them first towards the end of
January. Tempted as I was to buy a packet and have a feast of warm spicy
buns dripping with butter, I resisted the impulse (for once) spurred on
in my unaccustomed will-power by the realisation that eating hot cross
buns in January just is not right -- they belong to Easter.
But another good reason for not buying ready-made hot cross buns is
that they are so much nicer when you make them yourself. Don't be put
off by the thought of baking which needs yeast. Providing you bear in
mind a couple of points, there is no hassle at all involved with yeast.
I do realise that to some people seeing yeast listed among the
ingredients makes them want to turn the page to another recipe -- I used
to feel the same way myself until I got to grips with yeast.
Before I go into the yeast details, there is another very good reason
for making your own hot cross buns. They can have the ingredients in
them you like. For my taste, no bought bun is sufficiently spiced. And
personally I hate dreary little currants, and much prefer plump raisins
or sultanas. As two of my children hate mixed peel, I leave that out of
the buns and get the citrus flavour by adding grated orange and lemon
rinds.
No bought bread is seasoned enough for my taste -- I use honey or soft
brown sugar as a sweetner and salt, too, to bring out the flavour of the
bread flour. For hot cross buns you can use either strong-plain, white
flour (and it must be strong flour, ordinary plain flour hasn't got a
high enough gluten content and bread made with plain flour will give a
cakey textured loaf or bun) or wholemeal flour, or a combination of
both.
As with all bread, hot cross buns freeze very well. They only need to
be thawed overnight and warmed in a low temperature oven before serving.
Do beware of ever trying to fast-thaw bread, buns, or indeed any baked
produce in a microwave. I think that the moisture is drawn out of them
and they have the texture of two or three-day-old bread.
My only problem with making hot cross buns lies in the crosses
themselves. I believe that there is a firm which makes thin pastry
crosses for the baking trade, but when I've tried making my own pastry
crosses they have been far too thick. I slice a cross shape in the top
of each bun using either an extremely sharp knife or a razor -- if you
need to press down with the knife you knock the air out of the risen
bun, hence the need for extreme sharpness. When I first started to make
my own buns I used to end up with all different sizes until I started to
cut the dough into half, then each half into half again, and so on,
until I had evenly-sized blobs of dough.
And now back to the subject of yeast. When I first started to make
bread I could only get dried yeast. After a few years an excellent baker
started work in Broadford, our local town, on Skye, and I bought fresh
yeast from him. But I found the taste of the fresh yeast far too
dominant in my bread. After a couple of weeks' bread-making with fresh
yeast I went back to using dried yeast. The important thing to remember
is that taste is a personal thing, and so don't be put off from using
fresh yeast, just try it and see which you prefer.
You will find two types of dried yeast on the market. One dried yeast
doesn't need to be reconstituted in warm water with sugar -- the sugar
activates the yeast -- the other type does. Dried yeast has a limited
shelf life, so mark the opening date on the lid. You don't need to worry
about this if you make bread each day, like we do here at Kinloch.
However, if you are at the experimental stage of bread and bun making,
buy a small tin of dried yeast.
When baking with yeast everything should be warm -- the water in which
the yeast reconstitutes should be hand-hot, the flour should be room
temperature, and not brought in from a cold larder or store-room.
Excessive heat or cold will kill the yeast. It also needs a gentle
touch. Kneading the dough should be a rhythmic exercise, and not a
bashing, aggression-relieving session.
When I am making bread or hot cross buns, I find kneading the dough a
very soothing and therapeutic activity, and the dough must be kneaded
until it is no longer sticky, and it feels smooth and elastic. I don't
bother to glaze my hot cross buns as I prefer the matt appearance of
them.
Hot Cross Buns
Makes about 16 small buns, or 12 large
1 lb (800g) strong-plain, white flour, or wholemeal flour, or half and
half
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground mixed spice
6 oz (300g) raisins or sultanas
grated rind of 1 orange and 1 lemon
[1/4] teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon soft brown sugar
[1/2] pint tepid water with 2 teaspoons sugar
and 2 rounded teaspoons dried yeast well stirred in
Method:
Leave the warm water, sugar and yeast mixture in a warm place until a
head of froth develops equal in size to the water under it. Sieve the
flour, spice, and sugar into a bowl and add the raisins (or sultanas)
and grated orange and lemon rinds. When the yeast has frothed up well,
stir in the yeast mixture and knead the dough on a floured surface until
it no longer feels sticky. Cut the dough in half, then each piece in
half again, and so on until you have 12, 14, or 16 pieces of dough. Roll
and knead each into a ball and put them on to a greased baking tray.
Cover with a cloth and leave in a warm place until the buns have doubled
in size. Gently slash a cross shape on the top of each with a very sharp
knife or a razor blade, and carefully put the baking tray of buns into a
very hot oven, 420[DEG]F, gas mark 7, or 220[DEG]C for 10 minutes. When
cooked, the buns should sound hollow when you tap the base. Cool them on
a wire rack in a warm place -- a cold place or a draught will toughen
the dough. When cool, pack them into a polythene bag and freeze them.

CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society investors and borrowers
yesterday voted overwhelmingly to approve the #1800m Lloyds Bank
takeover of the society.
At an extraordinary general meeting held in the London Docklands
district, 78.9% of eligible investing members voted in favour of the
resolution while while 74.3% of borrowers approved the deal.
Proxies had already been sent in. It means that about 800,000
investors will receive a cash windfall but borrowers get nothing and
investors will need to have been with the society for two at least two
years.
Half of the society's 1.2m eligible investors had to vote in favour
for the deal to go through while at least 75% of those actually voting
had to approve.
Some disgruntled borrowers called a meeting last Saturday to try to
force better terms from Lloyds and Cheltenham. There were plenty of
angry members among the 2000 or so who attended yesterday's meeting,
accusing the directors of arrogance and misinformation. But many of the
borrowers are also investors and the likelihood always was that it would
go through.
Eligible investors in the Cheltenham will get a fixed payment of #500
plus 13% of their balance up to a balance ceiling of #100,000. So the
maximum individual payout will be #13,500.
Last year, the Cheltenham original plan, to pay cash to all investors
and borrowers was partially blocked in the High Court because it
contravened the Building Societies Act. So it had to come back with new
terms, excluding certain categories of investor and all borrowers.
On Tuesday of this week, the High Court approved the proposed merger
of the Halifax and Leeds building societies. But in that case investors
and borrowers are being offered shares in the new company. To those
losing out at the Cheltenham, this must have sounded a much fairer deal.
But the circumstances and the rules are different.
Some Cheltenham members were more concerned, though, about tying up
with Lloyds Bank than receiving money. One man is quoted as saying ''it
is like a virgin being embraced by an old and proven rake.''

* As a regular reader of your Saturday column of questions and answers
on investment, I have noted that you always insist that investments are
spread over a number of companies to minimise risk, and that you often
recommend the use of a stockbroker where large amounts are involved.
However, when a choice of stockbroker is to be made, the eggs are all
in the one basket in so far as the investor is getting the advice of
only one person, albeit an expert.
Can you advise on the criteria you would apply to try to ensure the
choice of stockbroker is a sound one? My request is based on the
assumption that there are very effective stockbrokers as well as
relatively ineffective ones, and it would be sensible, if possible, to
know how to avoid the latter. I assume it would not be practical to use
more than one stockbroker.
* Personal recommendation by a family member or a valued friend often
plays a part in the selection of a stockbroker. It is best to deal with
a fair sized firm where the individual who handles your affairs will be
the beneficiary of the wisdom and research of other colleagues.
Most stockbrokers have buy, sell and hold lists of leading equities,
and publish research on individual stocks and sectors.
Your stockbroker should be someone with whom you feel at ease. If you
want the optimum service from him or her you should be prepared to
confide details of your finances. It is best if you can visit from time
to time to discuss your investments, though this is not always possible.
Private clients are the bread and butter of most Scottish
stockbrokers. Unless you are exceptionally rich, it is unlikely that you
would get the service you want from a firm which majors in institutional
business.
If necessary, the Stock Exchange in Glasgow will provide you with a
list of Scottish firms from which you can pick. You can always consult
several before making up your mind about the one you prefer. As you
point out, in most circumstances it would not make a lot of sense to
have more than one firm acting for you. Each would need to know the
remit given to the other and how it was being carried out.
Stock market indices are published daily, and this makes it easy for
the investor to monitor the performance of his or her portfolio in
relation to market trends.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating. If your investments are
lagging behind the market, you will want to know why, and if you are not
satisfied you can take your business elsewhere.
The point about not putting all your eggs in one basket is that it
helps to limit the unavoidable risks of equity investment and to give
you a wide spread of opportunity to profit from successful stock
selection. Your stockbroker is a middle man and an adviser. You are not
buying shares in his or her firm.
* My husband and I are in our mid-thirties and have a young family. We
are now at a stage where we would like to invest some of our disposable
income on a regular basis. We both have company pensions which are
adequate at the moment.
However, although we have sufficient mortgage endowment policy cover,
we do not yet possess any personal life insurance. We feel the latter is
our priority. Can you offer any advice?
* As parents of a young family it is essential that you both have
adequate life cover, and this can be bought relatively cheaply in term
assurance. This is a straightforward insurance against death rather than
a savings plan with life assurance, which describes your endowment
policy.
Cover can be for the duration you want -- obviously the longer the
term the higher the premium -- and there is no payout if death does not
occur in the period. There are variations in the policies available. For
example, you can have one with gradually escalating cover to allow for
inflation. Or the policy can have the option of conversion into a
savings-type of life policy at a later date without further evidence of
health.
A straightforward 10-year policy would cost very roughly #70 to #80 a
year for #50,000 worth of cover over 10 years, assuming good health at
the outset. Scottish Widows, Norwich Union and Pearl offer among the
best value policies.
Once you have sufficient life cover you can consider an investment to
build up a capital sum, such as through a Tessa policy. No tax is
payable on the interest, though the plan has to be maintained for five
years.
* I am and 65 in receipt of #92 approximately state pension weekly in
respect of my wife and myself but no other pension. We do, however, have
#10,000 to invest for income without too much risk. Could you explain
the tax position if I place the money where the interest is paid gross,
and have you any ideas about what would be a suitable investment in my
circumstances?
* A good low risk option would be to invest in the Pensioners'
Guaranteed Income Bond which currently pays 7.5% without deduction of
tax. Not only is the rate relatively attractive, but the interest is
also paid monthly, which is helpful when you require the interest to
supplement your pension. Your total income will be less than the age
allowances due to you and you will, therefore, have no tax liabilities.
The bond offers a fixed rate for a five-year term, and if you withdraw
funds early you will lose interest for 60 days on the sum withdrawn.
If you feel that you do not want to tie up your funds in this way, an
alternative is the National Savings monthly income bond which pays 6.5%
gross and requires only 90 days notice to uplift funds after the first
year.
If you invest in a bank or building society where monthly interest
accounts are also available offering attractive rates of interest, you
should register as a non-taxpayer when opening your account so your
interest can be paid gross. The bank or building society will give you
the necessary forms to sign.

* Next month we will have had #10,000 invested in National Savings
fourth issue index-linked certificates for five years, and we are having
a hard think about getting more interest on our savings in general.
My husband is 72 and a non-taxpayer -- his Government retirement
pension is taxed at source in Continental Europe. I still pay tax (just)
and receive about 85% of the retirement pension. We rely on bank
interest on our savings otherwise and now this amounts to very little.
We have another #5000 each in index-linked certificates which will
mature later this year and early next. I have a building society Tessa
which is due for its final payment next month. We have around #55,000 in
a 90-day deposit account at 6.1% gross and another #7000 in a 30-day
account at 4.25%.
Recently we took out a three-year stepped bond which rises from 6.5%
to 10%. It appears looking at some building society account rates that
we could do better investing in one of these, rather than the bank.
With the eighth issue index-linked certificates offering 3%, we are
wondering if we should wait before re-investing in National Savings. I
have been told that it is likely there will be one or two more issues of
certificates made this year and I assume the rates will be increased.
Although my husband is a non-taxpayer would it be worth his while to
start a Tessa?
* Your first port of call must be the National Savings Pensioners'
Bond which pays 7.5% gross on up to #20,000. These are only available to
people of 65 and over so just your husband qualifies. A similar rate is
also available for a one-year term from Halifax Building Society for
#10,000 or more.
Apart from these rates, your 6.1% is not too bad, though you could get
6.75% on #25,000 or more in National Savings Income Bonds, and that rate
can be expected to go up should interest rates in general rise. The
Pensioners' Bond rate is fixed for five years. Both these bonds provide
monthly income.
As for new index-linked savings certificates, there might be a further
issue should interest rates go up a percentage point or so, but the
return on top of inflation may be only a little higher.
With your husband a non-taxpayer there is little point in him taking
out a Tessa, as the return will be only marginally more than he can
obtain elsewhere now, and the money will be locked in for five years.
* In November 1993 I invested #5000 in TSB Selector PEP and valuation
as at December 12 last year was only #4686. Should I stick with this PEP
or transfer elsewhere? I already have the maximum in Tessa accounts and
am a standard rate taxpayer aged 67 years. I also hold various National
Savings certificates.
* After last year's fall the stock market has only just recovered to
the level of November 1993, and given the PEP charges it is not
surprising that it was showing a loss last December. It should have
recovered somewhat since then.
You should stick with your PEP, bearing in mind that it is a long-term
investment, meaning at least five years. Transferring elsewhere would
involve additional charges and would not guarantee a better performance.
* I have recently retired and intend selling my present private
residence and moving to another property which I purchased on May 31,
1985, for #45,500 excluding legal fees. Could you please indicate how
the capital gain would be calculated on any future sale of the second
property, and should I take steps to establish the value of the property
on the day it becomes my principal private residence?
* The main residence exemption applies to gains arising in periods
when the property is used as your only or main residence. In addition,
the gain applicable to the last three years of ownership is exempt
whether or not the property is used as your main residence.
It is also possible, where two properties are owned, for you to make
an election which will determine for capital gains purposes which
property is to be treated as your main residence, but this election can
only be made within two years of acquiring the second property.
In view of these rules, the gain on your existing home will be fully
exempt. The period when the second property was not your main residence
from May 1985 until you move will be the only one subject to any future
capital gains liability. This will be calculated on a time apportionment
basis. For example, if you own the property for 20 years and use it as
your main residence for at least 10 of these years, then half of any
gain made will be a chargeable one.
It is not necessary to establish a value when you move into the house
as your original cost plus expenses will be used in any future capital
gains calculation.

BANK of Scotland will receive #23m in cash for its 50% stake in a
credit card company set up with Halifax Building Society in 1988.
The move to bring the Halifax Visa card under its exclusive control
will give the building society more freedom in this part of its business
in the run-up to and after its proposed merger in August with Leeds
Permanent.
However, the decision to purchase Bank of Scotland's stake was taken
before November's merger announcement.
Bank of Scotland will continue to administer Halifax Visa from its

Lord McAlpine, former Conservative treasurer and counsel to the
mighty, is now on the outside and lobbing in firecrackers -- and loving
every minute of it, finds Julia Langdon
ALISTAIR McAlpine bounces back in his armchair, laughing his delighted
laugh, his eyes alight with merriment and with mischief. ''You must
understand this fiction!'' he said, responding to the suggestion that
his new book, a volume of political advice*, was going to get him into
trouble because of the similarity of some of his characters to current
figures in public life. The reality is that he couldn't care less.
This truth appeared a little later in our conversation. ''I can't
think of anybody I'll upset whom I haven't upset already,'' he said. He
was still laughing.
This is not because he has wilfully embarked upon causing offence, but
because he has spent a long time in politics and he is an amusing man
with a highly developed sense of the absurd and he clearly feels, with
some justification, that politicians are fair game.
For McAlpine has now changed sides, and in more ways than one. He was
a political insider: Tory Party treasurer for 15 years, deputy chairman
for four of those years, confidant of the Cabinet, privy to the highest
counsels of the land (which is to say scrambled eggs with Margaret in
the flat above Number 10) and a man whose every public move was worthy
of comment.
His new book -- his third in five years, and there are two more in
preparation -- is an epistolary novel about politics, the letters
written from uncle to nephew, distilling a very great deal that Alistair
McAlpine learned about people and the political way of life during that
period.
The uncle writes: ''When you reach high office do not read the
newspapers, for their opinions are of no use to you, and as for news,
you must make it, not wait for journalism.''
Yet now McAlpine is the outsider, himself the journalist. He earns an
enviable living from journalism to augment his existing financial
arrangements, and he is firmly established as a leading and vehement
political critic of John Major's administration. He uses his sharp pen
and the knowledge he gained on the inside to devastating effect in a
variety of newspapers and magazines.
He does the same in this book and however much he may protest that it
is fiction, that all writers must draw on characters they know,
observations they have drawn from life, there are numerous recognisable
portraits. Indeed, the Prime Minister, a sensitive soul, would perhaps
do well to avoid the book. He would find it very uncomfortable; in fact
he would hate it.
''This prime minister seems gripped by indecision,'' McAlpine writes.
'' . . . This prime minister is worthy of study, he is the model of all
that you should shun. He seems nice, a word I dislike; nice, however, is
a word that might have been created with him in mind, for it exactly
describes how he seems. I say 'seems' for, as he tries to please all, he
must be as confused as everyone else about what he truly feels.''
There is a great deal more of this. And there are many others who
appear in the variety performance that McAlpine arrays before us. Was
that reference not to John Selwyn Gummer? That must be Cecil Parkinson
there, for it is a very precise description of his fall. That is Jeremy
Hanley. Surely that is Norman St John Stevas -- or Lord St John, rather,
of course, these days? And isn't that the chairman's secretary at
Central Office, a woman who has had a ringside seat for many years
observing the political action? There are delicious and nice (in the
proper sense) descriptions of his club, the Garrick, at which he is a
frequent and popular presence; of visits to Chequers; of the function of
the Tory treasurer. McAlpine continues to grin with puckish glee when I
put these references to him, but he is also honest. ''What was it you
said about Michael Heseltine?'' I asked, flicking through my book for
the reference which had made me laugh out loud when I read it. The
author immediately obliges: ''Hair blowing in the slipstream of his
oratory,'' he said.
But for all this fun -- and it is a very good read which will be
greatly in demand among the political cognoscenti -- it is also a
profoundly serious book which could in its way be a textbook on the
state of our political times. It is about love and friendship and trust
and betrayal and, perhaps underlying it all, the fundamental immorality
of modern politics. ''To my mind politics has reached a pretty appalling
state,'' says McAlpine. He thinks his main character, the uncle, is
appalling, too, a man of tremendous conceit who gets a well-deserved
comeuppance. It is a tragedy of manners. Isn't it very cynical? I regard
it more that I am a realist. I realise that people do have failings --
people don't always come up to your expectations, nor do you come up to
other people's expectations.'' He is fascinated by the arbitrary nature
of politics: how people get elected, why things happen, how a
comparatively minor event changes people's lives: the decision to turn
left at the end of the evening towards the bed of the mistress, who
becomes pregnant, rather than choosing the path of rectitude. He was
trying to say that there should be something greater about politics,
that it should be about ideas and principles, instead of convenience,
although he is aware that he has drawn a picture which coincides with
the public perception of the political world.
He started writing in 1976, sending love poems to his wife Romilly,
and taught himself how to use words. He left the political maelstrom in
1990 in order to write about it in The Servant, an adaptation of
Machiavelli's The Prince, and is now engaged in another book applying
the same precepts to the business world. He has also published a
delightful book of essays about collecting.
He loves writing. He does it fast, in bursts, often on aircraft,
having thought things through in advance. He is very cerebral. After
heart surgery a few years back, he walks a great deal in London,
thinking; I would be surprised, he said, by how often he dined alone,
listening, watching, and thinking. He enjoyed the discipline of this new
book and relishes the mad requests he gets as a journalist: he was in
Hanoi recently and was given two hours to write a piece for a Sunday
newspaper which he dashed off with relish in a noisy bar -- and then
they didn't use it. He wouldn't like writing alone on some Hebridean
island -- well, unless there was a local whisky distillery, that might
help. We raise our glasses of his excellent vintage Skye malt.
There is another book in preparation. He is writing his autobiography.
He is only 52 -- but he started young, he said, and his life has
certainly been packed with events. But there are natural breaks in one's
life and he believes that this is an appropriate one for such a project.
It will be enormous fun. ''And this one won't be fiction.''

<HEADLINE>PEPs extended to Eurosterling</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE types of product in which personal equity plans (PEPs) are now
able to invest has been extended to include certain Eurosterling bonds
and convertibles. This follows the Chancellor of the Exchequer's earlier
decision to allow the use of domestic corporate bonds, preference shares
and convertibles for PEPs, writes CHRIS STONE.
The industry welcomed yesterday's announcement from the Treasury.
There had been fears that without Eurosterling, the range of qualifying
instruments would have been too narrow to meet investors needs.
At the same time, the Inland Revenue released its draft regulations
for the new qualifying products. Interested parties have until May 12 to
submit their written comments on the regulations but the Inland Revenue
would like them as soon as possible.
Qualifying bonds must be denominated in sterling, issued at a fixed
rate and have a minimum term to redemption of five years at the time of
acquisition. Financial companies cannot qualify nor can their
subsidiaries. In the case of preference and convertible shares, the
companies must be incorporated in any European Union member state while
for corporate bonds and convertible bonds the firms have to be
incorporated in the UK.
Other requirements are that the new instruments must satisfy certain
listing requirements to be eligible to be held for direct investment in
PEPs. This does not apply, though, where the new instruments are held
indirectly through a unit or investment trust.
Qualifying unit and investment trusts -- those which can accept
subscriptions up to #6000 -- will be able to count eligible preference
shares, corporate bonds and convertibles toward the 50% investment tests
alongside existing classes of qualifying investments. There are no
changes to the rules for ''non-qualifying trusts'' -- those which can
accept subscriptions up to only #1500 -- or for single-company PEPs.
The exclusion of financial companies' bonds, announced at the time of
the Budget is to be extended to their preference shares and
convertibles.
The Government will be monitoring the range of products offered
carefully to ensure that flexibility to invest in non-qualifying
investments or engage in cutting the risk factor does not lead to the
development of products whose overall risk profile is too far removed
from the Government's objectives.

SCOTTISHPOWER is paying about #3m for five Manweb electrical
superstores in north-west England and associated stock, in its first
acquisition since the arrival of new chief executive Ian Robinson,
writes IAN McCONNELL.
Although small in terms of the size of ScottishPower's war chest,
yesterday's move may be a harbinger of greater things.
Mr Robinson, recruited from the construction to shipping group
Trafalgar House, recently announced that ScottishPower was contemplating
an acquisition in the utilities sector and looking more closely at
expansion opportunities overseas.
Any significant purchase might make ScottishPower a stickier bid
target, if a group like the conglomerate Hanson ever became interested.
ScottishPower revealed last week that it was in talks with Manweb,
which is pulling out of electrical retailing.
In relative terms, ScottishPower's latest retail additions do not
represent quite as good value for money as its #16m purchase of 49
superstores and a distribution outlet in northern England from the
receivers of Clydesdale last year.
Chester-based Manweb anticipates that about 100 of its staff will find
jobs with ScottishPower in the superstores in Chester, Warrington,
Liverpool, Southport, and St Helens.
The English electricity company will convert its remaining High Street
shops into stand-alone customer service centres.
It anticipates about 200 voluntary redundancies and an exceptional
charge of #16m on its withdrawal from retail, an area in which it
believes it cannot make an appropriate return for shareholders.
The retail division of ScottishPower has performed well in a difficult
trading environment.

SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle is back on the acquisition trail just days after
confirming that it is in talks with Foster's Brewing of Australia to buy
its Courage subsidiary, Britain's second-largest brewer, writes NICOLA
REEVES.
This time it is joining forces with British Land in a 50/50 joint
venture to buy the freehold and long leasehold interests in 306 Chef &amp;
Brewer pubs from Inntrepreneur Estates for #198m cash.
The joint venture will be called The Public House Company and will be
an associate company of S&amp;N and British Land.
The two parent companies are to use limited recourse bank debt of
#164m to help pay for the deal. The balance of #34m will come from equal
equity contributions to the joint venture made by Scottish &amp; Newcastle
and British Land. Rent from the 306 pubs in the most recent full year
was about #18m.
S&amp;N is also buying 14 short leaseholds from Inntrepreneur and five
from Courage for #2m. Inntrepreneur Estates is a joint venture between
Grand Metropolitan and Courage.
A Scottish &amp; Newcastle spokesman said the timing of the joint venture
pubs deal had no significance in terms of the talks with Courage and he
would not comment further on those discussions. City analysts believe
that S&amp;N is close to agreeing to pay #400m for the bulk of the Courage
assets.

HISTORICAL amnesia is a terrible thing, an open invitation to the
cynical manipulation of peoples who have forgotten -- say -- what war
looks like, or what mass unemployment means. It's therefore a privilege
and, in a bleak sense, a reassurance to listen to veteran BBC
broadcasters like Alistair Cooke and the World Service's John Tidmarsh,
and hear them put today's political earthquakes and alarms so firmly
into a full half-century of context.
In Letter from America, Cooke was actually able without turning a
silver hair, to compare the first 100 days of the new Republican
Congress, of Newt Gingrich and his ''Contract with America'' with his
own direct experience of the atmosphere in Washington during the first
100 days of Franklin Roosevelt's ''New Deal,'' in the spring of 1933.
And Tidmarsh, interviewing an old friend of Martin Luther King's on a
recent edition of the World Service Outlook programme, was able to refer
to his own memories, his own recordings, his own meeting with Dr King,
gleaned in Alabama in the late 1950s.
But there is no doubt that that depth of knowledge and perspective is
going to be harder to acquire, in the BBC, now that the organisation has
moved so far towards the short-contract, no-security culture required by
the Birt revolution.
This week, for instance, Radio 5 Live sent out some publicity about
its forthcoming new food programme Going Bananas, to be presented by a
children's television personality who says that the idea is to offer
something different from existing food shows, which tend to
''concentrate on recipes and culture and ignore the issues behind
food''.
This is said without even so much as a passing acknowledgement of
Radio 4's great flagship Food Programme, presented by the incomparable
Derek Cooper, which has been pursuing the issues behind food production
and marketing relentlessly for over a decade. But then, perhaps in the
new, contracted-out casually-staffed BBC, no-one connected with Going
Bananas has ever heard the Food Programme, or even heard of it.
Which makes it all the more pleasing that this year's fiftieth
anniversary of the end of the Second World War is producing such a rich
harvest of programmes designed to make forgetting difficult, if not
impossible.
Radio 4's shattering six-hour adaptation of Len Deighton's Bomber,
reviewed here last month, has just become available on cassette; and now
Radio Scotland's Dave Batchelor, working with historian Angus Calder,
has produced a seven-part series for Radio 4 called The Home Front, that
seems set to become a little masterpiece of documentary collage, piecing
together fragments of historic recorded material with letters and
diaries written by ordinary British people to create a sense of that
time so vivid you can almost taste the powdered egg, and smell the dank
reek of gas-mask rubber.
What is so seductive about this series is the way in which it allows
the great positive myths of wartime determination and solidarity to take
their place alongside a toughly realistic view that never soft-pedals on
the racism, sexism, and rampant snobbery, that often disfigured the
scene.
All in all, indeed, I think The Home Front would have met with the
unqualified approval of Jack Regan, one of the BBC's finest Scottish
journalists and, latterly, head of news at Radio Scotland, who died this
week at the age of only 53
It seems incredible that Regan's familiar voice -- still urgent,
youthful, full of energy -- should have fallen silent so soon. But if I
remember one particular thing about him, it will be the open-hearted
anger that shook that voice on the day in the 1980s when he went to
report on the break-up of the Chrysler car-plant at Linwood and saw so
many post-war dreams of full employment and new industrial prosperity
carried out and auctioned off with the redundant machinery.
Not his most objective report, perhaps; but one informed by the
passion and compassion -- for a people, a place, a time, and their story
-- that shapes the work of all the best journalists, Jack Regan
included.

A SUCCESSFUL flotation which saw the net worth of the company increase
by around #20m to #31m and a marked improvement in the balance sheet was
the main factor behind the move into the black by Speciality Shops.
Despite subdued consumer spending, the company made a profit of #1.1m
last year compared with a #6.2m loss previously. Earnings per share were
6.6p against a loss per share of 9.1p and there is a final dividend of
1.28p, in line with the prospectus forecast, equivalent to a full-year's
payment of 2.4p.
The group, which specialises in shopping centre management, is on the
lookout for underperforming shopping centres costing between #8m and
#15m in Glasgow, Aberdeen and London, where it is currently
unrepresented.
The Waverley Centre in Edinburgh, one of the group's flagship
developments, performed well last year helped by a strong summer tourist
trade.

The Butlins spirit is alive and thriving on the set of Britain's most
popular TV soap opera. Leila Farrah joins a coachload of devotees to
explore an enduring cult
TONY WARREN, creator of Coronation Street, described it thus: ''A
fascinating freemasonry, a volume of unwritten rules. These are the
driving forces behind a working-class street in the North of England.
The series sets out to explore these values and in doing so, to
entertain.''
The series he was taliking about is now 35 years old and deemed by
each episode's 19-23 million viewers -- and theatrical bigwigs such as
Mayfest director Paul Bassett -- as ''Britain's True National Theatre''.
The cult is also an industry. Early this Thursday at St Enoch Square,
a devotional queue of 90-odd beaming, Corrie disciples bustle on to one
of Strathclyde Buses' five annual pilgrimages to Manchester's Granada
Studios for a tour of The Street's sets and the promise of Percy
Sugden's wartime memories. Profound logistical discussions abound: ''It
takes three hours. If we spend one hour at services, it'll take four.''
These are seasoned coach trippers, hard-core Corrie fans, the
matronesque Bettys and Margarets in comfy shoes, anorak wearers and
crisp munchers, middle-aged men with walking sticks, young couples and
family groups, most clutching packed lunches which will later liquify
under a pounding sun on this round trip of 440 miles. Neil the driver's
every announcement is applauded merrily by his blethering mass
predisposed to spend a cracking day in the vicinity of their cultural
icons.
Under a postcard sky of wispy clouds unfold scenes of frisking lambs
in hazy fields, monolithic passes and finally, the unprepossessing
warehouse wilderness of Manchester's commercial outskirts.
It's not Universal, but last year 780,000 visitors toured the city's
own Granada Studios, a game patchwork of entertainments, a theme park
augured by a towering lot of New York fascia, yellow taxi cabs and pink
Cadillacs, neon, and Bronx tenement backs, with the further stillness of
aspirational Americana evident in giant-headed models grooving to the
Eye of the Tiger.
The Manhattan Playhouse boasts Robocop. But, set off by a yellow satin
flounce on its stage sits a friendly looking chap who could be about to
call the bingo or preside over bowls. This is Bill Waddington, aka Percy
Sugden, that patron saint of all grouchbags, today playing the audience
with a sunny disposition beloved of seaside audiences by recalling his
Army experiences, reading poems from the front and tripping over the odd
line.
It's all to plug his new book, Percy's War (his last was indispensibly
titled The Importance of Being Percy), all proceeds will go to the Army
Benevolent Fund. He doesn't give free interviews so has raised #32,000
for the fund in memory of friends who didn't come back from a war in
which he served in Normandy.
''All the British people have a sense of humour, that's why they win
wars -- they laugh at adversity,'' says the cosy veteran, weaving
homespun philosophies from a wee table where only a flask of tea and
fishpaste sandwiches are missing. He's earnest, too, filling up with
emotion as he imitates -- rather less successfully -- Winston Churchill.
''It's making me feel emotional, is that, honestly . . .''
''Has he memories of Scottish soldiers?'' asks a Glaswegian. ''Fine
men, great soldiers, devils in skirts,'' he glows, recalling his first
stint at the Glasgow Empire, ''a kamikaze booking for English comics.''
And Percy? ''Twelve years ago I was asked to play him but I'd been
making people laugh all my life, and he seemed a miserable git.''
Fade with a little poem about growing old, applause to the Corrie
theme tune, and we're away on the studios tour escorted by the
professionally nice Maxine, who wouldn't go amiss demonstrating safety
regulations at 30,000ft with her ''that's luvvlie!'' manner.
Interaction is the key as a smiling Max buttonholes unsuspecting
punters into production task demos: Glasgow's Molly and Lillie play
director and vision-mixer, Phyllis and Jamie park themselves on a
spreading sofa, that sine qua non of all breakfast show hosts, and in
the azure weather room, Clydeside bus driver Derek mimes those ridges of
high pressure.
The Make-Up Room gets through 90lbs of cotton wool and 50 gallons of
cleansing cream per year (''and that's just Bet Lynch'' quips a
hostess), while the nostril-rich smile of Ken Barlow is whoopingly
identified by all as the single subliminal shot in the Edit Suite.
Onwards to Wardrobe with Annie Walker's ancient furs, Bet Lynch's
(satin explosion) and Gail Tilsey's (pure nylon) wedding dresses, and
the venerable memorabilia of Street greats Hilda Ogden and Ena Sharples.
Through Sherlock Holmes's Baker Street set and Mrs Hudson's Potato
Emporium, where a kind lady from Tamworth offers my chum and me some of
her currant strudel -- the Butlins spirit is everywhere -- we come with
due respect to the inner sanctum: facsimiles of Corrie interior sets.
Jim's Cafe is a Formica/steel dream and Argos-style smothers the
Duckworth's kitchen dining-room, the MacDonalds' and Websters' sets.
Production for Britain's favourite soap is a well-oiled military
machine, as it devours stories ''with the appetite of a whale'', as
boasts the press blurb. There's a four-week turnaround on the production
schedule, with Sundays for outside locations; Monday for outdoor scenes
on the Street set; Tuesday for rehearsals; Wednesday technical runs;
Thursday and Friday interiors.
And the Street itself? A triumph of compact scaling, but a
claustrophobic's nightmare. Here's the Duckworth's blue-and-yellow
frontage, Rita's Kabin, Denise's Salon, Baldwin's Garage, and Reg and
Maureen's corner shop, all built a third down from normal size but
enlarged onscreen by camera angles. Folk are phoning home from the call
box on this holy site, knocking on doors in the hope of raising up a
famous face. (A Corrie ''star'' mingles with punters every day and we've
just missed Rita. Their hourly rate is a reputed #500 for this task
claims one of the four site attendants.)
In a hushed climax of collective worship, our party gathers for The
Coronation Street Experience, a brief film of most dramatic Corrie
moments viewed from a carousel set which rotates through romance,
melodrama, and farewell scenes. The truly devoted can pick from a
gallimaufry of emblazoned souvenirs in the adjacent shop.
The Street's cult has spawned acres of newsprint, a fanzine, books
light and academic, these and pale television imitations, its robustness
of character and plot causing a sudsy mirage which blurs the line
between fact and fiction for many.
One marriage bureau promised a successful outcome to Bet Lynch (Julie
Goodyear) if she registered, folk call Granada to book The Rovers'
Return for Christmas parties, Stan Ogden received requests for window
cleaning and Ena Sharples offers of work after being sacked as caretaker
of the Mission Hall.
Strathclyde's bus cargo recovers in the Corrie Restaurant, which is
hung with mug-shot montages of Street stars, a veritable feast of
changing hairstyles over three decades with bouffants, pageboys,
seventies flicked fringes, and the unchanging Harmony hairspray appeal
of Gail Tilsley.
Pensioners Katherine from Carntyne and the diminutive Mrs Docherty
from Riddrie are exhausted, chuffed with their day. ''Lovely, ooh yes,
aye, very pleasant, it's flown by,'' but have found the food prices
''disgraceful, shouldn't be allowed.''
Laura, Donna, Margaret and Audrey, a bustling bevy from East Kilbride,
away from their weans for the day, are getting in a last snifter before
the haul back and reviewing recent plot lines in a chorus of giggles. An
average of 14 writers work on The Street, to service at least three
stories running concurrently, along with three storyline writers and a
programme historian.
Laura and Co feel that women tend to have the edge over the men; the
Raquel and Tanya saga takes some beating, Mavis and Derek need to ''get
a life'',   gambling Steven needs to be picked up and scolded.
All true pilgrimages must entail a little mortification of the flesh
and ours has been the onset of rigor mortis from nine hours of motorway,
roasting sun on thermal vests uncomfortably enhanced by no proper
ventilation. It all gives those Newton and Ridley coasters and Bet Lynch
keyrings that patina of the hard-won holy relic.

SAFAR So Far is a simple story, like an ABC book of racial intolerance
or a sturdy plank crossing the cultural divide. Nothing fancy is sewn
into the plot of Chander and his departure from India to a
disorientating Glasgow of drunks and newscriers, racism and love.
In its presentation, however, every letter has been beautifully
embroidered, each page pristinely presented -- the spelling may be
simple, but the message is clear. Community theatre company Fablevision,
working with Theatre Action Group of New Delhi, have used bright,
flowing materials and injected imagination to bring trench warfare, sea
waves, factory floors and Heaven's Tunnel Of Light to venues around the
city.
You can often hear people's expectations creak and lower at the
mention of community theatre. And Safar So Far is far from faultless.
Criticisms include an overindulgence in standard ''social issue'' props
-- raves and drug use, inter-racial love -- and a rather predictable
plot. The most jarring moments, when adults play children, are
thankfully blissfully brief.
We all know about the child within, but hair bunches, ''bad teddy''
and open mouthed naivety we can do without. But one moment sweeps aside
all of the above, a moment that elevates Fablevision's community theatre
to the front stalls.
Chander's Scottish son, Vishal (Archie Lal) is nearly broken by
bullies when he discovers a photograph of the Indian wife his father
deserted. Gazing at the picture, she dances behind him to a
heart-breaking composition by Michael Zolker. For a few brief moments he
knows the impossible place where he belongs. And so does the audience.
We belonged where we sat in hushed silence, revelling in the spectacle
of pure theatre.

FORGET faith minimalism. Gorecki, Taverner et al may have tugged at a
few heart strings but real spiritual fodder can only be found in truly
authentic religious music. Last night's concert by the SEMC provided
much to be thankful for in an emotionally charged account of Orlando di
Lasso's The Tears of St Peter.
In setting 20 stanzas from Luigi Tansillo's extraordinary
sixteenth-century poem, di Lasso intended to capture ''the tears, sighs
and laments which came from Peter's eyes and breast while Christ was in
the tomb''. Intrically woven unaccompanied vocal lines for seven singers
reveal all of the agony and heartache associated with St Peter's
remorse.
Accompanying the singing in the SEMC's concert were a number of slide
projections mirroring the musical message -- images of St Peter
Penitent, St Peter's Denial, and The Crucifixion. Although striking and
thought-provoking, pauses between the groups of stanzas in order to view
the pictures tended to interrupt the momentum in the music.
That said, the final stanza, written by the composer himself, in which
Christ speaks from the Cross, was an immensely powerful conclusion,
densely textured yet absolutely clear in expression.
Sung by seven of Scotland's finest young singers, all the complexities
of di Lasso's vocal writing shone through. Complex harmonies blended in
an immaculate ensemble, perfectly poised and assured. Intonation was
generally secure although the odd waver was detectable in the sopranos,
not entirely surprising given the constant demands made in the upper
register.
Directed by Warwick Edwards, the programme is repeated tonight in
Aberdeen's Cowdray Hall.
* Concert funded by Glasgow City Council.

SIR Charles Mackerras can be expected to contribute something special
and unexpected to any concert he conducts. Last night it was a symphony
by Vorisek instead of a promised piece of Johann Christian Bach. It was
also -- with the agreement of his solo pianist Piers Lane -- Hummel's
fascinating elaboration of Mozart's C minor piano concerto, K491,
instead of the barer notes of the solo part printed in the score.
As Sir Charles announced beforehand from the platform, this was the
nearest thing to Mozart's own piano playing we were ever likely to hear.
But just as arresting, if not more so, was the way the conductor dealt
with the orchestral detail, the pointing of woodwind parts, the
intrusion of kettledrums, the ache of the string tone.
Adjusting to the extra flourishes and decorations of the piano part
was not in fact always that easy. Of all Mozart's concertos this is the
darkest, and the stark notes we have grown accustomed to hearing have
come to seem right for it. But if some of the ornamentation sounded
cluttered and somewhat heavy, that was doubtless because Mozart himself
was not there to play it on a fortepiano. It was, nevertheless, a
remarkable performance of the sort that makes you listen to familiar
music afresh.
Vorisek's one and only symphony, on the other hand, was unfamiliar
music, even it sounded at times like an amalgam of Mozart and Beethoven,
shot through with Bohemian charm and impetus. Sir Charles and the SCO
have just been recording it, along with the Arriaga overture (a racy
piece of Rossiniana) they added as an interlude before their closing and
explosively exhilarating account of Beethoven's fifth symphony, filled
with rolling drums, sonorous brass, and wonderfully audible bassoon
tone.

Reports of disaster win the awards but, argues
Martyn Lewis, it is surely as great a challenge to pursue positive
stories
IN April 1993 I started a debate about the nature of television news.
I asked why so much of the news had to be so gloomy, and why there
wasn't more good news. The BBC's managing director of news and current
affairs, Tony Hall, went on record as welcoming the debate I started --
and I am grateful to him for that. But he has said he disagrees with me
over the division of news into good and bad.
He sees it more as the need for a wider canvas with more stories on
science, technology, and the environment -- and fuller coverage of the
UK and its communities, so that new audiences are reached.
I greatly admire his campaign for that, which has already permeated
the BBC's news programmes; but I still see the issue as a broader one.
It goes without saying that I am writing in a personal capacity -- and,
incidentally, as a strong supporter of the ways in which BBC news and
current affairs has been vigorously and formidably strengthened over the
past few years. It is a measure of that strength that this debate is
taking place in such an open way.
That said, there has been some highly selective reporting of my
argument, as a few journalistic colleagues sharpened their knives -- not
to dissect my argument, but to distort it. Whether accidental or
deliberate, whether through laziness or ignorance, it would be
unfruitful to speculate.
But certainly a few of my critics clearly hadn't had the time or
opportunity to read my original speech before they launched their attack
-- and one was subsequently decent enough to admit that. Another wrote
an article which began by acknowledging that my argument had been
distorted, and then proceeded to go on to distort it himself.
Some of the distortion was a product of that gut journalistic instinct
to see an argument in terms of black or white -- a commendable approach
on many occasions, but not when the heart of understanding the point
being made actually involves several important shades of grey. And other
distortions were based on a genuinely felt belief in some quarters of
the journalistic profession that ''news consists of things people do not
really want to know, or see reported''.
It is that long-standing but narrow concept -- as an all-embracing
definition -- which I am seeking to challenge. For I believe that daily
news reporting can and should be about so much more than that.
In a nutshell, what I am arguing is this -- that when we come to
decide the editorial priorities for each day's news we should be more
prepared than we have been in the past to weigh the positive stories --
not artificially created, but as they naturally occur in the news agenda
-- on the same set of journalistic scales on which we weigh the negative
stories.
And the balancing factor on those scales, the main criteria for
commissioning and including stories, should not be the degree of
violence, death, conflict, failure, or disaster they encompass or
represent, but should be based on the extent to which those stories
shape or change -- or have the potential to shape or change -- the
country or the world in which we live.
And they are criteria which will not only allow us to expose the
injustices and the tragedies in the world, but also to give proper
weight to the achievements, successes, and triumphs. So that the 80% of
people who regard television news as their primary source of
information, shaping their view of their country and their planet, don't
feel as often as they do that the entire world is falling apart -- but
are also kept more fully aware of the changes that offer hope, that
uplift the human spirit, that mark mankind's continuing achievements in
all walks of life.
I am simply asking for TV news editors everywhere to bring to news
bulletins as a whole the same balance we all strive for in each
individual video report -- and not to be pushed by the inevitable time
constrictions of half-hour bulletins into reducing or abandoning the
positive stories, which, in my experience over many years in TV
journalism, are usually the first to be demoted or dropped when
pressures begin to mount.
That is what I said.
But, incredibly, my detractors claimed that I somehow wanted a world
where journalists are in the pockets of public relations spin doctors
from politics and business; or bulletins packed with nothing but light,
happy, and trivial stories -- mainly, it seems, about cats and dogs;
that I wouldn't cover Bosnia or, indeed, have bothered with Vietnam.
Curious allegations -- for a quick perusal of my original speech will
reveal that I specifically raised each of those bizarre interpretations
of ''good news'' -- and clearly and roundly rejected them!
But once the distortions were up and running, they were quickly picked
up by a few feature writers and critics who gently lampooned me in
cartoon and comment -- locking into the minds of their readers a point
of view, an argument, a case, which I hadn't actually made. And
''anonymous sources'', tapped into by profile writers, went into
overdrive to denigrate me as a lightweight, by emphasising some lighter
journalistic sidelines of my career to the almost total exclusion of the
more serious work I have attempted over the past 26 years in journalism.
We don't like or understand the argument -- so let's have a slice of
good, old-fashioned denigration.
So, in some quarters, I was labelled as a sort of ''Good News Junkie''
-- either peddling perpetual triviality, or advocating a kind of
Soviet-style sanitisation of the airwaves -- suggesting that people
should be given only what they want to see and hear -- wanting to pack
bulletins with stories that would have delighted either Geobbels or
Jeremy Beadle -- or, as one critic put it, ''the feel-good reports which
gush out at you from so many programmes on American television''.
The whole episode was, in my view, a classic example of one of the
worst faults of journalism -- of how an irresponsible, thoughtless, or
inaccurate interpretation of an argument can be locked into print -- how
a lie can be up and running half way round the world, before the truth
has got its boots on.
But then, there always has been an arrogant streak in some sectors of
the journalistic profession. We quite properly demand the right to
attack, criticise, and analyse every other sector of society; and yet
some of us are surprisingly sensitive when someone -- especially another
journalist -- asks us to turn that same probing spotlight on ourselves
-- to examine publicly what we do and why and how we do it.
Then again -- perhaps, to some journalists, distortion makes for a
better story. To hell with accuracy -- let's just make it up. And TV
presenter-bashing is always good fun!
But when the fun is over we come back to the real point I was making
-- which is not going to go away -- and which I intend to continue to
make and debate and develop in forums like this where one can have a
reasoned and measured hearing and discussion.
I am encouraged by the fact that several senior and well-respected
editors of news programmes in BBC and ITV have acknowledged that a great
weakness of TV news is that we visit people, organisations, and
countries when things are going wrong for them, but seldom return when
there is a substantial turnaround in their fortunes and things start to
go dramatically right. So the impression that lingers in viewers' minds
is the negative one -- because we have not taken the time or trouble to
correct it.
The journalistic hunger for conflict is often reinforced and fed by TV
award ceremonies that lean heavily towards rewarding pictures of
disaster. These rewards are well earned by brave and courageous
reporting teams. But it has become locked in the journalistic lexicon
that those are the kind of winning stories many talented reporters
should aspire to.
It is surely just as great a journalistic challenge to pursue positive
stories -- which don't present such dramatic pictures but are every bit
as important to society as a whole -- and turn them into TV news reports
that people want to watch. We have got to pull ourselves out of the
dangerous whirlpool where the more negative a story the more prominence
it is given.
I believe there is a great hunger among a huge number of people in
this country and beyond for the kind of shift in news priorities I am
proposing.
Since I made my first speech on this issue my mailbag has been full of
letters of support from hundreds of people in all walks of life.
They are still coming in on an almost daily basis -- like this one
from a 63-year-old mining engineer who began by telling me he had just
emerged successfully from a major operation.
He wrote: ''I know from wider reading in the technical press that
there is no shortage of heartening success stories in science,
exploration, and engineering. Mankind continues to strive, aspire, and
regularly to succeed. In my own discipline, performances are being
achieved every week which would have been unthinkable 40 years ago. And
yet, since returning home, I have heard nothing from your broadcasting
colleagues save sob-stories and reports of massacre, murder, disaster,
child abuse, and rapine world-wide. It almost makes me wish to be back
under the anaesthetic.''
I wonder how many viewers feel the same -- and how many aren't
troubling to write a letter, but simply switching off? Might that not be
one factor in the gradual decline in TV news viewing in Britain over the
past 15 years or so? And, if so, what a challenge it would be to pull
those lost viewers back to TV news with an undertaking -- a commitment
-- to report more fairly the positive alongside the negative!
Journalism on television -- and in newspapers too -- has a formidable
track record -- and a great many triumphs to its credit. I submit to you
that across the world we still need a reassessment -- an adjustment (for
it is no more than that) -- of the way in which we are exercising our
colossal responsibilities as an exceptionally influential part of a
rapidly changing society -- yes, by reporting the failures, exposing the
weaknesses and the injustices, highlighting controversies, probing
motives and arguments -- but also by acknowledging rather more than we
have across the past few decades the accomplishments, the successes, and
the triumphs within that vast constituency of viewers and readers who
look to us for a fair and balanced canvas of the world in which they
live.
To sum up, then. We're in danger of vanishing down the plughole of our
negativity -- and dragging our society with us. Despite the debate I
started, there are still many people in broadcasting who believe stories
have to be negative if they are to be worth running.
But many people have understood my argument. Indeed I have received
extraordinary support. The crucial point is that we should be presenting
a more accurate mirror of society -- good as well as bad.
Since I made my first speech on the issue, the BBC has done positive
stories on all the original examples I cited. But there is a long way to
go. The great challenge for news journalists is to turn positive stories
into really interesting journalism. We have too often ducked the real
challenge, which is to present positive stories in a way that makes
people want to watch and listen and read.

AN INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT
Russell Celyn Jones
Viking, #15
SHARON is a small community, ostracised by geography and the
temperament of its inhabitants. The village is spread around a slate
quarry in a part of the world where coal and steel were upstart
industries, where miners climbed halfway up a mountain to reach their
work.
The quarry and its miners attract the narrator, who views the place
with an anthropological attachment. He remains an observer, recording
rather than participating in the village life and work.
It is a curiously insular Welsh community, whose inhabitants are
inspired and directed by their fundamental religious beliefs, though the
Gravano family are liberal enough to shock a visiting American.
Sal Gravano came from Sardinia. He jumped ship at Sharon because the
mountains reminded him of home and settled with Rebekah, who smokes a
clay pipe. The Gravanos and their four children both befriend and are
befriended by Aaron Lewis, though their son Paul is the main attraction.
Aaron Lewis is a detective, working for an agency which has been hired
by the quarry owner to discover the quarry men's collective experience,
to study and document the villagers' inherited powers for predicting the
quality of slate.
He lodges with the Gravanos and observes village life at the rockface,
pub and chapel. He sends a single message, which he thinks is a small
clue, something he suspects is ''of some significance''.
At dusk two quarrymen smeared a section of the rock with oil. One held
a candle while the other studied the light's reflection in the oil. They
told him they were ''looking for ghosts''.
Nearly two months later a strike breaks out and from here the
narrative voice becomes clear. Lewis is thrown into a moral turmoil
which is at the heart of this story, a question of choices and betrayal
which reverberates in Lewis for the rest of his life.
For the story is told in parallel naratives, the first relating to his
original visit in the autumn of 1937, the second covering his return 20
years later. Obviously, opposite sections of the narrative dominate and
the thrust of the story alternates and arguments move across the divide.
Russell Celyn Jones is skilled in the way he releases the details of
how the ghosts of the past affect the community, how work both unites
and divides them. The problem is they often seem like separate
narratives whose focus and actions never really merge.
Paul believes the strike is God-driven and it shapes into a struggle
between good and evil, the old and the new. The strike committee meet in
the chapels with Paul as their leader as the community fights to
preserve their way of life and resist the changes being imposed from
outside. He never comes across as the enigmatic inspiration who
fascinates Lewis. We can accept the fascination rather than understand
its reasons.
The narrative is so tightly controlled that, rather than showing,
Russell Celyn Jones is often forced to tell us, sometimes offering what
reads like profundities that are either obvious or left unexplained.
''Like the mountain itself, Paul's was the remotest of forms,'' he tells
us, later saying Paul ''could have been somebody'' in America without
revealing why ''there was no way up for a man like him in British
society''.
And the differences in the community are underlined by Lewis's love
for Paul's son, Glanmor. Paul is now blind and still convinced he was
right. Glanmor lives in a different world, surfing where his grandfather
landed. ''The past is a wave I've just ridden,'' he says. ''The future
the next wave coming in.'' His ambition is to surf in Huntington beach.

Pop star and pundit Pat
Kane tells Ann Donald
what's on his bedside
table just now, and
introducing a new service
for readers, with a look
at forthcoming events
for anyone interested
in books and writers
WHAT I'm reading at the moment is ''for the job'' as I've got an
interview with Martin Amis about his new new book The Information
(Flamingo), so I've dragged out all my dog-eared copies of his old books
off the shelves. He's one of my favourite authors. I like the way he's
trying to bring in elements of pop culture, US argot, creating
neologisms but at the same time you realise it's all on the basis of
well-crafted English literary style. One of the reasons he seems so
dynamic an author is because he can obviously construct before he
destructs.
The one I'm going through at the moment is London Fields, which is
basically his attempt to do Dickens on amphetamines. It's about the
patch of London that he lives in and using that as a microcosm for all
the modern world's ills. One thing that surprises me is his very
contemptuous attitude towards the working classes. It's more evident to
me now, having read someone like Kelman who is adamant about giving
people their own voice, to re-read Amis and see how he deals with class
structure in such a classic, English, Imperialist, omniscient author's
way.
I've also been about a bit for my pop stuff and one of the things I
picked up when were doing a gig in Dublin was a book by Fintan O'Toole
called Black Hole, Green Card -- The Disappearance of Ireland (New
Island Books) which is absolutely brilliant. It's basically a series of
very, very intelligent cultural essays on Ireland. He's not shy to use
hard economics or French post-structuralist theory or whatever comes to
hand to explain what's going on in his own patch. What the title means
is the black hole through which Ireland emigrates out to the rest of the
world and the green card that makes it happen. He's actually an
anti-nationalist and I love the idea of the diaspora, giving Ireland a
global consciousness.
Another booked I picked up on my travels in San Francisco was The
Millennium Whole Earth Catalogue (Harper Collins) which is just about
the best book I've read in a year. For one thing it's very big -- about
a yard by three foot. It's a sequel to the Whole Earth Book which came
out in 1969 and was the bible to the ''small is beautiful'' movement.
Now in the age of the internet and cyberspace it's got all the tools and
ideas the well-equipped activist of the twenty-first century needs:
names, addresses, fax numbers, places you can get materials and books.
Someone should do one for Europe.
Being a bibliomaniac is actually quite useful for one of the jobs I'm
doing, which is being a flexible pundit. Stuart Cosgrove once said
reviewing one of my books that ''Pat doesn't just have a lust for
knowledge, he has a pornographic lust for knowledge'' which I think is
quite accurate. I do have an absurd budget for books and an absurd range
of interests. No book is ever wasted.

IF ever you doubted that those in film and TV are a self-obsessed,
introspective shower of luvvies, then these doubts will have been
dispelled in the past seven days.
It all started on Sunday, when the Bafta Production Awards took up
several hours of prime television time. The awards season is obviously
upon us and we're also faced with smaller events, all trying to emulate
the Oscars, and convincing themselves that we have any interest in their
self-congratulatory gatherings. Of all the awards ceremonies, the Oscars
are different. They've got a bit more class. Haven't they?
Film-makers are so arrogant that they assume we actually care who was
lead grip in Pulp Fiction or who was the outside caterer for Jurassic
Park. Does anyone go to the pictures thinking ''I'm really looking
forward to seeing a decent bit of cinematography tonight?'' In general,
the average punter will remember only:
1.) Who the star was.
2.) Who took their kit off.
3.) What film that guy was in. Him there. With the hair. Was it Four
Weddings and a Funeral? (To which the answer is usually ''Shut up This
is Four Weddings and a Funeral.''
Almost by definition, good cinema maintains a complete suspension of
disbelief, and you only notice that the complex aspects of film
production have taken place when they are done badly; what should be
termed the ''Roman Soldier With A Digital Watch'' phenomenon.
Awards ceremonies are a demanding task for everyone concerned. The
first lesson in acting school must be one where you learn how to read a
grammatically incorrect sentence. (''And the nominations are . . .'' or
''And the winner is . . .'') with the vital increase in pitch at the
last word. It is important to pause at the end.
This gives enough time for the video to kick in and show the
nominations, or for an exaggerated opening of the envelope (all the
while pretending, of course, that they haven't already had a quick peek
backstage).
Some day, one of these presenters will learn how to remain dignified,
when, having read out the nominations with the right degree of respect
and excitement, the compere announces that, ''Unfortunately the spawny
git hasn't been able to make it tonight, so . . .''
It's not usually a problem at Oscars, but at things like the East
Dorking Film Academy, or the Paisley Baftas (''And the award for Best
Use Of A Live Firearm 1995 goes to . . .'') the sense of anti-climax is
almost palpable. At best, the winner will have deigned to send a video
of him beside his swimming pool in Bel Air saying ''Gee thanks''.
At worst, he will have sent his binman to collect it, so cutting out
the middle man. Of course, we are always assured that he's not here
because of ''prior commitments'', ie he's got an emergency sausage to
fry on the barbeque. The unspoken message to all those stuck in the hall
or sitting at home watching is simple -- ''Get a life, losers''.
The public, however, usually have the biggest gripe with the
acceptance speeches. Tom Hanks in the space of a few minutes went from
being a famous name to being a convenient piece of rhyming slang. I felt
that his wife should at least have had the decency to throw up on
hearing all that guff, but I suppose she is American. As far as the
viewer at home is concerned, there are two categories of acceptance
speech: too short (''He's a bit of a dour git'') or too long (''He's a
bore'').
Even if it is an Oscar, the biggest crime a recipient can commit is to
cry. Never mind that years of toil have finally earned him the
recognition of his peers, that his fees are now quadrupled, or that he
need never star in another TV mini-series again, the viewer, almost
without exception will be sitting at home scoffing, ''Look at him,
what's his problem? He's won, hasn't he? These guys make me sick.
Ponce.'' This usually comes from people like my dad, who, if awarded
Employee of the Month at the local McDonald's, would cry like tired
babies denied a biscuit.
Why the acceptance speech is necessary is unclear. I suppose that
unlike sporting trophies, which are a matter of arithmetic, arts awards
will always be a matter of opinion. It's maybe just as well our football
captains don't have to speak. They are contractually obliged merely to
jump around with the lid of the cup on their head, and that's about as
articulate as they could be.
In arty awards ceremonies the winner has not earned anything, he has
been given the award by his peers and, as part of a process of
recognising this, he has to acknowledge those who have gifted him this
honour. Why he should want to tell them about his childhood and
tearfully thank his favourite orthodontist is still unclear.
At the Oscars, the only thing as inevitable as tears is the British
Oscar. Again, as if proof were needed that these guys are self-obsessed,
we then have to listen to how the ''British Film Industry is on its
deathbed'', and ''only a massive injection of Government funds can save
it now''.
OK guys, I know we can't afford hospitals, decent grants for students,
or a wage increase for nurses, but I suppose it is an emergency
requirement that we push millions of pounds into Pinetree studios.
That'll ensure we can manage to continue on one of the great traditions
of British cinema, ie making dire films that no-one wants to watch.
The reason that there is ''No British Cinema Industry Left To Speak
Of'', is that British studios produce films that even British people
don't understand. These are usually documentaries about pearly kings or
the history of Paddy's Market, and if they're not overbearing, then
they're frivolous and all we get is two hours of innuendo and slapstick.
In general, we make films that are parochial, earnest, and ultimately
bad. Why should we pay to make them when there'll always be some
gullible Yank desperate to pay Emma Thompson to wear an Edwardian
outfit?
Look on the bright side. The fewer British films that are made, the
less chance there is of a Brit making an ass of themselves at next
year's Oscars.
* After last week's article, I've had some people enquiring as to what
swear word ''A***e'' is. This was of course a gratuitous ''*'', the
actual word was supposed to be ''A**e''. It's good to know that there
are people out there on guard against the superfluous asterisk. Far from
being upset, I'm happy that several of you felt bothered enough to get
off your arse to tell me about it.

THE only sensible reaction to the revelation that the Princess of
Wales had wrenched her knee and was, therefore, forced to pout and limp
fetchingly on the ski-slopes this week was who cares?
Nearly as differently interesting was her estranged one's analysis on
what ails our nation. We are apparently suffering loss of global
influence and low self esteem because a mood of pessimism and
introspection is undermining morale. What matters it seems is how you
feel not how things really are. Man, my leg's just fallen off, but, hey,
I'm feeling so-o good.
Coming from one whose internal landscape is as well-mapped as an A-Z
of central London that might seem a mite rich.
Far more alarming is the news that his literary efforts, and I use the
term loosely, have been snapped up by Disney. It seems a story he once
scribbled in a few stray moments to amuse his brothers is to be turned
into a full-length feature film. To the question who cares? comes the
anguished response me. I can't bear it.
We've just finished a three-week run of Aladdin, preceded by a
marathon performance of Basil the Great Mouse Detective. To think that
the video might one day soon be on a perpetual Disney cycle showing the
Old Man of Lochnagar is enough to induce a bout of carpet chewing.
There are other equally worrying literary moves afoot. Louisa M
Alcott's dime dreadful book Little Women has been given the sheen of
political correctness and made into a film. It turns out that the four
heroines of the Deep South, a bunch of smug, simpering goody-goodies
drawn as pen portraits with all the subtlety of a brushstroked canvas
painted by Rolf Harris, were seminal influences for generations of the
women's movement.
It explains a lot. Jo, the tomboy in the garrett churning out reams of
prose, Beth, pooah deeah dead Beth, and Amy and Meg and daahling Marmar:
which I wonder was the role model for Andrea Dworkin, or even more
intriguing, Camille Paglia?
Whatever next? We've already had Postman Pat unmasked as a
three-fingered member of the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. It came as no
surprise, although Mrs Goggins has always seemed a much more sinister
figure. Japanese editions now feature a four-fingered Postman Pat.
Wonder what they did with Jess the cat?
No, for me the real horror was the recent disclosure that Thomas and
James and Gordon are about to be roughly pushed out of the shed by
Mavis, Caroline, and Nancy. Thomas the Tank Engine is to be updated.
That worries me, deeply. I hate Thomas the Tank Engine. And his chums.
The Rev Awdrey has a lot to answer for.
Tears before bedtime in our house means the achingly tedious tales of
James or Thomas or Gordon have been discovered skulking on the shelves,
secreted behind ancient volumes of the Handyman Guides to Home
Decorating.
Has anyone ever actually read them? I don't mean recited them, glassy
eyed, with the aid of a bottle or three of Gordons. I mean actually
deciphered the texts and attempted to extract any meaning from them? The
deconstruction of the tales of Thomas and Harold and James and
Clarabelle might furnish a Phd for anyone stable enough to stay this
side of nervous collapse.
Come and Meet the Author of Thomas the Tank Engine, the colourful
poster outside Stockbridge Library once beckoned. Dutifully we trotted
along and crowded, all nine of us, into the back room. The author
arrived. He was more than dull. He was truly, madly, deeply boring. He
was the son of the original writer: the little chap for whom the
Reverend Gentlemen orginally devised the dreary tales of Thomas, now
grown. He could hardly be blamed for how he'd turned out.
For a long hour, he failed to hold the attention of the small
audience, who shuffled and tapped their feet. The children were much
more ill-mannered and crawled away to crayon all over his brown
briefcase.
It is he who is charged with rewriting his father's lifeworks. He will
bring us some girlie engines, wilful appendages, to challenge the sexist
bias of the original text. This, from a man who names them Mavis, Nancy,
and Caroline. I wonder how he'll get round the problem of a PC name for
the Fat Controller? the Calorificaly-Challenged Controller, the
Differently Sized Privatised Executive?
Anyone who comes up with an answer deserves to be locked in a day-time
television hospitality room with their worst fears and a bound volume of
Thomas Meets Mavis In a Tunnel until they scream to be let out.

BILLIE HOLIDAY
Stuart Nicholson
Gollancz, #14.99
I SNATCHED at this book; had to have it. Tore it from the grasp of my
colleagues. It was my book; it was the biography of Billie Holiday. For
was it not myself who did his Diploma presentation at his art college in
Edinburgh and done well to boot, on the basis of illustrations, album
covers and the like, of Lady Day, the most haunting and perhaps most
influential of the great female jazz singers of all time?
Female jazz singers? There aren't really any others. Louis Armstrong,
Jimmy Rushing, Big Joe Turner are important sure enough but not nearly
as much as females. Ella, Anita O'Day, Sassie Vaughan, Lena Horne, Peggy
Lee, some of them white, some of them brights and yaller girls. Billie
was a yaller girl which probably helped her to break on to the offay --
ie, white -- integrationist bands.
The older girl singers were very black indeed. Bessie Smith who,
astonishingly, was recording as late as 1933 with Coleman Hawkins and
Jack Teagarden (who worked right up until his death in 1964) was black
as black, as was her predecessor Ma Rainey and a hundred others.
Even right into the 1970s Victoria Spivey was giving it big licks and
she was black enough in voice and complexion to get herself banned from
every circuit except the 'shine clubs and the chittling circuit in the
Deep South. Bessie Smith died early of ''personal problems that stemmed
from drink and poor judgment over male companions''. So did Billie
Holiday.
No other black performers seem to have suffered quite so much from
their Negro backgrounds, or have felt racism so keenly. But perhaps
their art arose from that grievance.
Ella Fitzgerald, for instance, came from a possibly more disturbed and
deprived background than Holiday (true name Eleanora Fagan -- the
Holiday came from the alleged real father Clarence Holiday, guitarist
with the Fletcher Henderson band) and was certainly, like Holiday,
sexually abused at an early age, and spent some time in whorehouses in
childhood. Yet Ella managed to survive and even in her late teens, with
the Chick Webb band, seemed a well-adjusted personality.
More; she kept her voice and Holiday did not. More than that too. Ella
was a popular singer, as was Holiday, as well as a jazz virtuoso, and
sang every level of pop song. Billie Holiday kept to a repertoire which
scarcely spanned more than 25 songs over a 20-year period, and
throughout her career her vocal range was slight. Towards the dreadful
end she couldn't pitch anyway and her tonal range wouldn't last an
octave. It didn't stop her art, however, and nothing can take away from
that.
Her last recordings, and I have them, made in 1959, will have you
blurred with tears because, illiterate, drunk, drug-addicted, not even a
very nice person at all, art sometimes transcends. Listen to the
cracked, hoarse, finished, voice of Lady Day in her very last record,
''I Can't Get Started'', and you are listening to the breath of death.
Billie always sang it well, on the few occasions she included it in a
set. ''I've been around the world in a plane/ Even settled revolutions
in Spain, but I'm broken-hearted/ I can't get started/ With you''. She
couldn't and didn't.
Despite the salivating drivel on the flyleaves, this biography, by the
musicologist Stuart Nicholson, tells you even less than her own ghosted
autobiography did. It is fan stuff, largely a musicography, most of it
detailed on who ever played on what disc. The author writes more
pretentious nonsense on the elements of music than you will get out of
Groves. Turgid passages on musical pedantry are there to tell you how
splendid the author's musical knowledge is: you might as well have no
ears the way he tells it.
For instance, the photographs he uses in the book are a giveaway for
they are all dreadful, displaying a rather stout and weary Lady Day.
There were and are plenty of photographs showing a rather glamorous
figure, the style publicity snaps wanted. I know: I used them for the
illustrations I painted all those years ago. But I used her art first,
her music.
Buy the records. Listen to The Strange Fruit. I think of Billie
Holiday in a smart gown and gloves and a gardenia in her hair. I know
about the derelict which she was at the end of her short 44-year life. I
doubt any fan doesn't.
The legend doesn't help: much of it is made up. The true story is that
of an illiterate black girl from a single-parent family whose mother
introduced her early into the squalor of prostitution, whose own
community showed her the degradation of drink and drugs, whose talent
was prodigious but needed more than art: it needed being white, and
having comfort from cradle to grave. The lumpen Baltimore Blacks
afforded none of that for their offspring, only a gaudy pleasure and
misery. You hear them both in Lady Day, every time you put the needle on
the groove; you hear the needle in her arm; you hear the needle scraping
into the artery of Black America.

Anthony Troon writes a new column for the neglected majority
AS a pundit I am frequently asked: ''Doctor, what exactly is bad
taste?'' The reply, of course, is that it's bad taste to call yourself a
doctor when you're not one, just as it is to call yourself ''major'' or
''commander'' when you used to be one. You will look in vain through the
phone book for people calling themselves ''corporal''.
However, it was a very touching letter from a correspondent that made
me realise the subject is not being properly taught. ''My partner is
always accusing me of bad taste,'' it ran, ''although she's never able
to explain exactly what she means. Anyway, I happen to like my
Motherwell FC wallpaper. Can you give me some guidance? Yours -- Pink
Shirt with the Detachable White Collar, Lanark.''
I reassured this patient that bad taste was much more common than he
realised, although it is not given the attention it deserves. Magazines
for home-lovers are packed with advice on what's fondly called ''good
taste'', while those of us who enjoy bad taste have to find our own way
through the minefield.
Other patients have asked me whether bad taste is hereditary, but
sadly it is not. There are many examples of people brought up in
surroundings of the most execrable taste, weaned on flying ducks and
flock wallpaper, yet who ended up shopping at Habitat, Liberty etc. Bad
taste is something that has to be diligently acquired.
Also, there is a sort of conspiracy of silence on the subject. Always,
when you are showing people round your newly-decorated home, there will
be a chorus of ''oohs'' and ''aahs'' but never an ''aargh'', no matter
how much trouble you've taken to pack in a load of kitsch rubbish. Much
of the pleasure in creating your own personal vulgarity zone is lost.
I had hoped to publish an occasional list of well-known people of
outstanding bad taste -- a sort of Outrage of home decorating. And yes,
there might have been a bishop or two in there. But the Homes &amp; Gardens
lawyer took me aside for a quiet word.
Nevertheless, this clinic will strive to give bad taste a higher
profile and to break the curious taboo surrounding it. You will learn
how to develop and express bad taste in the home, even on the most
limited budget. New directions in bad taste will be given special
attention, besides the more traditional well-proven methods. And about
time too.

THE OXFORD BOOK OF EXILE
Edited by John Simpson
Oxford University Press, #17.99
My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here; My heart's in the
Highlands a-chasing the deer; Chasing the wild deer and following the
roe, My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go.
IT WOULD be presumptuous to suggest that Scots were the only nation to
have the experience of exile, but we have had at least our fair share.
Certainly there are plenty of records of what happened to exiled Scots,
writings in which they lament the loss of home, precious little from
which has found its way into this collection. Those lines from Burns
alone would seem to have been worth inclusion, and the same applies to
the Irish, to the American West, or to the far-flung outposts of Empire,
not fields which have been exhausted, although Kipling is in there.
John Simpson, the BBC's foreign affairs editor, who has edited this
anthology, says he tried to stretch the definition of exile as far as
possible without breaking it. Every anthology depends for its savour on
the compiler and Simpson proves idiosyncratic enough to make this highly
personal book throughly interesting. But there are omissions. Some of
those celebrated Scottish and Irish laments for the lost homeland surely
deserved inclusion. He is right to say there is a predictable pattern,
one he is patently trying to avoid following, if one simply accepts the
standard definition of the word. But occasionally the predictable pays
dividends if found alongside the unpredictable. The setting can new-mint
the over-familiar coinage, giving the reader the opportunity to reassess
what could otherwise be mere literary wallpaper.
Simpson says that wherever possible he has used the words of the
people involved, unless there was a better reason for quoting something
about them. On that basis, the extracts from Richard Ellman's fine
biography of Oscar Wilde, arguably the definitive one, are permissible.
But surely Wilde himself had something to say on the subject worth
quoting. He had on pretty well everything else. And while Lady Antonia
Fraser writes movingly about Mary Queen of Scots, the Queen's own
letters would have been infinitely more affecting.
There is nothing wrong with selecting second-hand material, except
that, on the whole, the most powerful extracts are from first-hand
accounts, apt though the fictional accounts may be. Brian Keenan, for
example, writing of his time as a hostage, or Alfred Dreyfus writing to
his wife, both make a deep impression.
It cannot, of course, all be tears. Exile, on occasion, is preferable
to what is at home. Any writer extracting humour from the topic deserves
inclusion. P G Wodehouse on Wooster declaring that New York's a topping
place to be exiled in; Sally Bowles making Prairie Oysters in Berlin; or
Quentin Crisp, bittersweet but amusing, writing of his solitary state in
The Naked Civil Servant all deserve their place. Much the same goes for
Clive James's thoughts on life away from Australia. Exile is many things
-- you can be thrown out, you can have voluntarily left, you can find it
funny, you can find it sad, and the book, divided into sections covering
different interpretations, recognises this. Exile can, for example, mean
getting away from all the restrictions back home as in the hilarious
account of what the Prince of Wales got up to in Paris. He had gone to
the Maison Doree with the Duc de Gramont to meet the generous,
passionate and consumptive Giulia Beneni, known as La Barucci, who
arrived very late and, on being reprimanded by the duke, turned her back
on the royal visitor, lifted her skirts to her waist and said: ''You
told me to show him my best side.'' He had asked also to meet La
Barucci's rival, Cora Pearl, who had appeared before him naked except
for a string of pearls and a sprig of parsley.
Not at all like the home life of the present titleholder? Who knows.
The Prince of Wales in question was Edward VII to be. This is a book to
dip into, one to have at the bedside, and its pleasures are abundant.

ELECTRIC, the Beat Poets last night did what they always do, God bless
them. Instrumental and elemental, as well as just plain mental, they
make primal guitar and organ noises which feature much sax-driven
horniness. If there was last night added oomph and zip to their
performance -- not to mention blart and chank -- it was understandable.
Dick Dale's praises have been tirelessly strummed and hooted by the
Beat Poets for the past nine years -- long before his mighty
guitar-strings kick-started Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction -- so his
Scottish debut, complete with golden axe, had grail-like resonances.
What was he like? He was like Dennis Hopper might be in the lead role
in the as-yet-unfilmed Dick Dale Story, ie, awesome and avuncular. How
did he sound? Fuzzy. Loud. Huge. He dive-bombed us with blinding runs of
such all-enveloping high-speed tremulousness that we might have thought
we were on a roller-coaster. Or the big dipper. Or the dodgems.
Listening to Dick Dale, we were certainly transported to a funfair
somewhere. A funfair in a black and white film from the early sixties,
maybe, one featuring leather-clad ton-up roustabouts . . . and as they
gunned their Vincent Black Shadows into the closing-credits, it was Dick
Dale we heard picking out Ghost Riders In The Sky. Yup, he was that
good.
An all-action showman. Winking at the front row and handing them
plectrums from a special plectrum-dispenser affixed to his guitar.
Leavening metallic keenings with delicate courtly fills. Stalking off to
undertake percussion duets with his drummer. Somehow finding a spare
left arm with which to play his bassist's bass. Dick Dale . . .wow.

MALCOLM Rifkind seeks solitude there; Sir Walter Scott once wrote
there; the High Commissioner of the General Assembly is soon to visit
there; and David Bellamy once judged it the best in Britain.
We're talking about a garden. But no ordinary back yard. The
one-and-a-half acre, semi-wild alpine haven developed over 28 years by
(now retired) Edinburgh general practitioners, Nancy and Andrew Neil,
sets ablaze a hillside of volcanic scree which slopes down to
Duddingston Loch in the village of the same name.
Despite running a busy joint practice from their bungalow and raising
a young son, the Neils were always keen gardeners. ''But when our
allotment, in Morningside, was made into a car park, our minds were
focused on finding another piece of land'' recalls Andrew.
The session clerk of Duddingston church invited them to make use of
wasteground behind the kirk -- part of the manse glebe. ''Eventually,
the minister made it official. Now we pay the Church of Scotland #25
rent a year,'' explains Nancy.
It took two years of back-breaking toil simply to prepare the ground.
Embedded in 20-foot high nettles, rubbish slung over the kirk wall
during its 800-year history had accumulated in lorry loads. Coffin
handles, human bones (''we re-buried those''), empty communion wine
bottles, clay pipes, flints . . . the midden was an archaeologists
paradise (the Neils' son went on to become one).
Prize specimens now belong to the Scottish Museum of Antiquities;
other relics -- such as crypt lids weighing two hundredweight each --
have been manhandled into position as seats. Nancy reveals her medical
training still comes in handy, ''I've used my first-aid kit more in the
last year than ever before in the garden's history. We've done a lot of
risky work. Andrew used a chain saw to cut down 20-foot conifers which
have outgrown themselves. Another day, he was knocked over by a runaway
barrow. We've also tried pushing boulders uphill, using wedges.''
Many retired couples in their seventies are slumped at home with TV
and slippers. The Neils on the other hand, have always relished a
challenge. Before the advent of mobile phones, they gardened at
Duddingston outside surgery hours armed with ''bleepers'' inside
polythene bags. ''It was extremely frustrating -- you had to drop what
you were doing and get to the nearest phone,'' says Andrew. None the
less, loyal former patients still turn out for the annual Open Days.
Visitors to Duddingston always assume the couple started out with a
grand vision. Not so. ''We just worked our way down, top to bottom,
creating plots. The scree soil (in places only two inches deep) dictates
what you do. You exploit the landscape,'' says Nancy.
Others have exploited it too, though through different means of
artistic expression. In 1805, the Rev John Thomson took up the charge of
Duddingston Church, not least because he enjoyed the support of the
village factor -- Walter Scott's brother. The distinguished writer
himself was invited to become an elder.
As a result of John Thomson's own prowess as a pioneer landscape
painter, combined with his friendship with Scott, Duddingston Manse
became a mecca for Scottish artists and intellectuals. Turner came to
stay, as did Sir David Wilkie. The two storey tower at the bottom of the
Neil's garden -- which now houses gardening tools -- provided a quiet
refuge for Scott to write The Heart of Midlothian; and it was the place
Thomson chose to paint in peace.
There is no shortage of inspiration. The most-visited garden in
Scotland rolls down to a shoreline which is home to all manner of water
fowl. The loch is a nature reserve. A flock of waxwings caused a stir
last year; great spotted woodpeckers come by, even the extremely rare
bittern. The reed-edged sheet of water once provided a picturesque
setting for Duddingston Curling Society; and in 1803, the ''roaring
game's'' code of rules was officially drawn up in Thomson's Tower.
''Half our work now is producing plants and young conifers for Open
Days. We pot maybe a couple of thousand alpines a year. Last year we
made #6000 for charity over two weekends,'' says Andrew, who opens the
garden for the Multiple Sclerosis Society and for Amnesty International.
Malcolm Rifkind came down from his house in the village and planted
Amnesty's logo -- Forget-me-nots,'' Andrew laughs. The Inverewe
look-like garden is a favourite also with meditation and reminiscence
groups.
The Neils derive ''tremendous satisfaction'' from healing minds,
nowadays, instead of bodies. Theirs, they feel, is a special garden, as
Nancy explains: ''There is an atmosphere which only certain people feel.
You come through the gate and something happens to you.''
* The Neil's garden opens to the public on Saturday 20 and Sunday 21
May (2-5pm) through Scotland's Garden Scheme.
* The garden is also featured in a new publication out this month
called The Cathedrals, Abbeys ands Churches of Scotland -- 128 churches
to visit (#19.95). Phone/fax 0620 810301.

BERNARD SHAW: THE COMPLETE PREFACES VOLUME 2: 1914-1929
Dan H Laurence and Daniel J Leary, editors
The Penguin Press, #30
SHAW was a Grand Old Man who worshipped himself and others he
considered great men. He admired Napoleon as a Man of Destiny, Mussolini
as a Man of the People, Stalin as a Man of Steel. Shaw suffered from
Supermania.
In his search for the Superman, GBS committed GBH on the literary
remains of Shakespeare. ''I despise Shakespeare when I measure my mind
against his,'' he wrote, and stressed what he took to be the stupidity
of Shakespeare by mocking him as ''a sixth-rate Kingsley''. Shaw may
have been joking about a sensitive old soul but he was idiotically in
earnest when he described Hitler as ''not a stupid German''. Shaw
recognised the Great Dictator as a fellow Supermaniac.
In his preface to Back to Methuselah (1921) Shaw discussed his
contribution to Creative Evolution and his concept of the Superman. The
Superman was larger than life and would live for ever through his
creative efforts. The Superman was, in a word, Shavian. It is evident
from this preface that Shaw's subject was himself. He begins by telling
a tale about himself as a boy in Dublin and ends with a portrait of
himself as the Great Man who gave the world Man and Superman (1903).
This second volume of a three-part edition of all the prefaces of Shaw
shows the Great Man celebrating himself in grand style. For a start
there's the 1914 introduction to Misalliance. Shaw questions the answers
given to children in schools, savages schoolteachers, boasts of his
intellectual independence: ''I did not learn anything at school''. You
get the point. No ordinary man made an impression on Shaw. He created
himself. He created his own image and imagery by making an intellectual
exhibition of himself.
He put himself at the centre of the show he presented to an astonished
world. When, in Common Sense about the War (1914), he denounced the
military mind for inflicting war on this world he did so by asserting
his moral superiority. When he wrote A Preface on the Prospects of
Christianity in 1916 he lamented Christ's lack of insight into Communism
and declared: ''I know a great deal more about economics and politics
than Jesus did, and can do things he could not do.'' Jesus was obviously
too gentle to be a Superman.
Shaw was an effective polemicist because he eschewed subtlety. He
proved his points to his own satisfaction by parading the opinions that
made so much of his personality. Pygmalion came complete with a
characteristically self-congratulatory preface (first published in 1916,
revised in 1941): ''I wish to boast that Pygmalion has been an extremely
successful play . . . It is so intensely and deliberately didactic, and
its subject is esteemed so dry, that I delight in throwing it at the
heads of the wiseacres who repeat the parrot cry that art should never
be didactic. It goes to prove my contention that great art can never be
anything else.'' Note the two epithets Shaw attached to his own work:
successful and great.
With his great conceit of his successful self, Shaw was convinced he
had the answer to everything. He knew how to impose peace on Ireland
(How to Settle the Irish Question, 1917): ''it has been my fortune to
secure by my artistic activities a public position and I can, without
compromising that position, say things that no party politician dares
say.'' He knew how to deal with post-war Germany (so he said in 1919):
''Germany was the first country to recognise me as a considerable
dramatic author.'' Addressing American readers in 1928 he admitted: ''I
have never been to America'' (Shaw first visited the US in 1933) then
claimed: ''I may be said to know almost all about America.'' He was
Shaw, so supposed he knew all there was to know when speaking for
himself.
He was as proud of his prefaces as his plays. John O'London's Weekly
reprinted prefaces to some plays in 1928 and Shaw wrote a preface to the
prefaces. He was, he reckoned rather modestly (since he was greatly
gifted in a number of ways), a ''master of two trades'' -- could write
prefaces as well as plays -- and recommended his masterly prefaces to
readers indifferent to the plays. He was right to praise the prefaces,
wrong to put them on the level of the plays. The plays have the quality
of their characters, the prefaces have the character of Shaw alone.
Saint Joan (1924) has a memorable heroine who seems to speak for
herself on stage and page: ''But I cannot tell you the whole truth: God
does not allow the whole truth to be told.'' In the preface to the play
Joan becomes a Shavian know-all, ''a genius'' able to see beyond
conventional beliefs. In the play Shaw allowed the character her own
creative evolution, in the preface she is caricatured as ''the sort of
woman that wants to lead a man's life''. Another Superman.
For Shavians who accept Shaw's opinion of himself this expertly and
lovingly edited book is a must. And non-Shavians should enjoy it for its
astonishing insights into the mind of one who could be a jester of
genius in his plays and, in his prefaces, a Grand Old Man who took his
Supermania seriously.

SOME blokes can look a million dollars in a Prince of Wales check.
Others look like two-and-a-tanner. Clive Owen wears his suit well. Not a
mark, not a crease. Mind you, this guy could wear a potato sack tied up
with string and still look cool.
What you have to remember about Clive Owen is that he is not Clive
Dunn. He didn't sing Grandad and he wasn't Corporal Jonesy in Dad's
Army. Nor is he Clive James. Or Clive Barker. Or Clive Sinclair. Or
Clive of India, even. He is Clive Owen and he is an actor for whom, I am
reliably informed, some women would die.
There is a normally-sane young lady in this office who, when she
discovered that this reporter had been to meet Clive Owen in London,
wanted to tear my liver out, saute it, and eat it with fava beans. ''Why
didn't you take me with you!'' she raged. ''I would have paid you
money!''
We still don't talk.
Owen has just completed work on a new project, a 90-minute pilot for a
new series for Carlton Television. Turnaround (Wednesday, ITV) is based
on a novel by Mark Timlin and it's a belter of a programme. Owen plays
Nick Sharman, ex-cop turned gumshoe in tough ''Saf Landan''. It's the
best English PI show since Hazell. It's all dodgy boozers, shooters, and
villains in leather jerkins.
Sharman, a scruffy down-at-heel loner, is approached by a shady
businessman (Bill Paterson in excellent, low-key form) who asks him to
investigate a brutal triple murder which has all the hallmarks of a
contract killing. The 'tec is reluctant to get involved but, since he's
short of both work and cash, he agrees.
The case takes him into the dangerous world of machine-gun gangsters
and money laundering. When Sharman's first lead is found dead, he
becomes the chief suspect. Then, as he gets closer to solving the case,
the lives of his girlfriend (Rowena King) and his young daughter come
under threat.
Mark Timlin himself is a fascinating character. He is pure South
London (he says '''Allo mate,'' all the time). A former roadie with The
Who, he turned to writing crime novels when he discovered that no-one in
Britain was writing the kind of books he enjoyed reading.
The great thing about them (there have been 10 Sharmans so far) is
their attitude. He is heavily influenced by the hard-boiled American
detective novel. He writes in a sharp, sparse, uncompromising style with
lashings of violence. Actually, Turnaround, with only a handful of
murders, has probably the lowest body count of all his books (Carlton
obviously wants to break in the viewers gently).
In the books, too, Sharman is a much seedier character. He is not
averse to the odd snort of coke and he drinks like a haddock.
Television, probably by necessity, cleans up his image just a tad.
It was Clive Owen's agent who, more than a year ago, first saw the
potential for a television series in the novels. He had read them all
and passed them on to his client. Owen devoured them and agreed. They
then approached executive producer Tony Garnett (creator of Between The
Lines) who pitched the idea to Carlton.
''The books are very witty and original. They're also very seedy and
cynical. I'm very pleased with the way it's been done for television.
It's formula PI stuff, but it's done in a very classy way,'' explained
Owen.
''I suppose I was interested in it because there is a lot of
opportunity to get into the underworld of South London. Sharman is a
manoeuvrable character who can be put into a lot of different
situations. I took the character very much from the books and the funny
thing is that, when Timlin writes them now, he says he has me in mind,''
he explained.
Owen, of course, is best known as the heart-throb lead in the ITV
series, Chancer. But that was four years ago and Turnaround is his first
major television role since then. So why the gap?
''With a series like Chancer you become immensely high-profile for a
while and to a certain extent, after it finished, I steered clear of
long-running series. But that was just inasmuch as I was waiting for the
right one to come along.
''Most of the things I've done recently have been one-offs. I wasn't
really worried about becoming type-cast with Chancer, but it was just
that it was prime-time television and I thought that it would be good to
get off the screen for a while.
''It would have been very easy just to jump into another long-running
series, but I wanted to make sure that, when I did, it was something I
really wanted to do. Turnaround was it,'' he explained.
Was he worried that, with so many detective shows on television, that
Sharman could get lost among them?
''No. I see this as a particular project on its own. I like the
character and I like the world of the books. I don't think there has
been a PI set in this sort of world before. It has a fresh twist.
''I think the violence is necessary because Sharman inhabits a
particularly violent world. If you handle violence properly then it is
fine. You can't shy away from it. The main objective is to keep to the
world of the books,'' he said.
Casting his mind back to the ''sex symbol'' publicity that plagued him
(and annoyed him) after Chancer, the Coventry-born actor explained: ''I
was very inexperienced with the press at the time and I was being thrown
in every direction by journalists.
''I was under the impression that if someone said a paper wants an
interview, then that was what you had to do. And then I began to realise
that I had a choice. If I didn't want to do it, then I didn't have to.
''So I decided to stop and take stock. Basically, I was just not
properly prepared for all the attention. I had to grow up. Now I
understand that (the publicity) is a necessary part of the project. If
you do something and you are proud of it, then it is your job to go out
and sell it. Now I don't take it too personally.''
Owen once said that the two things he would never consider doing were
adverts and situation comedies. However, he revealed that he was
currently considering ''the germ of an idea'' for a sitcom.
''It's just something that hasn't been pitched yet, an idea for a
half-hour comedy series. Things change and people change,'' he said.
The actor will be seen on television again soon in the BBC Screen Two
movie, Bad Boys, premiered at last year's Edinburgh Film Festival. He
plays an underworld hit man who is contracted to kill a drug-dealing
lawyer.
When the hit goes wrong, he gets caught in a police ambush with his
partner. It is an ultra-violent film, about as tough as you get on
television.
''I loved Bad Boys because it was a highly original script. It is very
violent, but it is also very lyrical and almost poetic. It has a very
unusual structure, with the story being told almost backwards.
''The film is set in a very violent world and I suppose it is
heightened reality, really. It is about two friends and the bond of
trust between them. One goes off on a certain path and there is
betrayal,'' he said.
Owen, who recently married Sarah, his girlfriend of six years
standing, is a happy man these days. His career is on course and his
domestic life -- he lives in London -- is settled.
''I'm enjoying myself. I've been doing a lot of interesting work that
I am proud of. The idea is to keep going. I never stop to think about
what I have achieved.
''It is just constantly moving forward, taking things as they come. I
have no career plan; no specific ambitions. I just try to do things
which I hope will ultimately be good -- and that is all I have ever
done,'' he explained.
* MAJOR changes this week for Saturday night on BBC1. It's Goodnight
Vienna for the appalling Noel's House Party (surely one of the worst
programmes ever invented). In its place comes Confessions, a new
audience participation show hosted by DJ Simon Mayo. The early evening
time slot should ensure that the programme is not designed for members
of Mensa. To be honest, the concept sounds dire. Three unwitting members
of the audience are set up so that Simon can embarrass them with their
hidden secrets. The only saving grace is that the awful Beadle is not
involved. Still, the phrase ''Hold the Mayo'' somehow springs to mind.
* BUGS is a new ''hi-tech action adventure'' series that is a bit like
The Professionals, only less cerebral. Special effects and spectacular
stunts are to the fore in this low-brow nonsense. Mind you, it does
feature the sublimely beautiful Jaye Griffiths (Detective Inspector
Sally Johnson from The Bill), so this writer's eyes will be glued to the
set. She co-stars alongside Craig McLachlan (Neighbours) and Jesse
Birdsall (Eldorado). They're a team of troubleshooting cops who
specialise in surveillance and computer crime.
* Another new Saturday night programme very much in the ''haud me
back'' category is the return of The Lenny Henry Show. Personally, I
have a problem with Henry in that I find his characters tiresome and his
routines unfunny. Apart from that he's terrific.
* Finally, something slightly more promising. Chicago Hope is the
BBC's answer to Channel 4's ER. It is a lot less cinema verite than ER,
which won the ratings battle hands down in America. Starring Mandy
Patinkin (who's a bloke, incidentally), Adam Arkin, and Hector Elizondo,
it is a more traditionally-structured drama about life in a busy urban
hospital and it deals with life, death -- and the whole damned thing,
really.

NATURALLY, Hamish Macbeth (BBC1, Sunday) is a scandal. Even as we
speak steel-nibbed pens must be spitting bile at the letters pages while
fleysome patriots hirple to the defence of ''wir culture'' and all we
hold dear, ken.
It's a travesty, so it is. It's an insult; it's a cultural stereotype;
it's white-settler tourist-fodder trash for the effete southron market.
Any day now someone will be setting up Macbeth Watch and threatening to
burn the Radio Times down to the very staples, and let that be a lesson
. . .
The show is very funny, too, of course, but that's quite another
matter. One of the congenital weaknesses of wee Scots is that the only
way you could get most of us to laugh at ourselves would be by stapling
polyurethane grins to our chins. So consumptively delicate is Scottish
self-esteem, so paralysed by parochialism, that any parody is regarded
almost as an act of war. Hamish is affectionate parody, but in some
quarters that will seen as scant, if any, excuse.
The show draws on a film tradition excoriated, one suspects, because
it has been so vastly popular. Hamish has the ambience of Local Hero, of
Whisky Galore, even of The Quiet Man. It is not quite in that league, of
course, but its fey charm is drawn from the same stock. It uses its
tartanry and its caricatures knowingly -- right down to Wee Jock, the
snow-white West Highland terrier, and a title sequence done up like a
shortbread box -- but it subverts rather than stereotypes.
No doubt southern viewers will miss much of the joke and take it all
at face value. Whose problem is that? In all the arts in Scotland the
obsession with ''realism'' and authenticity has become a vice, as though
truth can only be approached via the factual record.
Hamish Macbeth plays with caricatures and makes a caricature ('No more
than three sheep abreast'') come to life. Highland cattle might seem
like the most risible of Caledonian imagery but in Plockton, here doing
service for ''Lochdubh'', they really do have them wandering around. The
cliche just happens to be perfectly true.
At first glance Robert Carlyle might not have seemed the ideal lead
for these shaggy-coo stories -- comedy not having figured greatly on his
CV -- but in fact his clipped insouciance is perfect for the
dope-smoking, love-lorn, promotion-shy lone polis who prefers home-made
justice to law.
Carlyle's Hamish strides among the comic mechanicals with just the
right mixture of exasperation and affection. The joke of this Macbeth is
on those who can't get the joke.
Should such lost souls have been desperate for a dose of reality they
could have tuned in to the 67th Annual Academy Awards in the ungodly
hours of Tuesday morning. In the Shrine Auditorium (shrine to what,
precisely?) everything was real except the people, the words, the
emotions, and the cheekbones.
The BBC seemed unnaturally proud to have secured the rights to this
year's ceremony, though why there should be any thrill in realising that
at 3am Barry Norman's face really does resemble a piece of tissue paper
fished out of a wastepaper basket must remain a mystery. The
extravaganza began -- and never trust anyone who offers you an
extravaganza -- with a display of technical mastery in which words and
pictures were utterly out of sync.
After 47 minutes, only two awards had been presented and David
Letterman seemed even less funny than usual, if such a thing is
possible.
One billion people were watching in 170 countries, which may say
everything about the condition of the species, yet Letterman behaved as
though this was just another CBS prime-time show, complete with
''hilarious'' animal act. Norman, meanwhile, sat like a disconsolate
wallflower at a studio party trying to interview people so famous they
hadn't been invited to the awards. It's at times such as these that you
realise just how bad Baz is without a script and an autocue.
Or did our ears deceive us when he asked of Tom Hanks, ''Can he win it
twice in a row for playing someone who is, as it were, handicapped?'' Mr
Hanks won his last award, you'll recall, for playing a perfectly
articulate lawyer who happened to contract HIV.
The awards themselves were so predictable they hardly mattered --
life, pace Gump, is no box of chocolates; you knew exactly what everyone
was going to get -- but as an example of just how bad American TV can be
the marathon was riveting. Bear in mind, after all, that this was the US
doing its very best. In celebrating sound and vision it produced
something utterly unwatchable. Therefore you watched, as the dawn came
up like implausible thunder, as though your life depended on it.
SUCH brains as were left to this column for the rest of Tuesday were
devoted to the Without Walls slot (Channel Four) and My Generation: the
Kinks, a tale of fratricide disguised as a story about a rock and roll
band.
Money, one suspects, can be all that has held Ray Davies and his
brother Dave together for all these years, but while they bickered to
camera some useful things were said about music and class, the subject
matter Davies has made his own.
He emerged, unsurprisingly, as an intelligent, reluctant witness to
his own fame. Perhaps the most touching moment was when he observed,
mournfully: ''My work is better than I am. I just don't live up to it. I
wish I was as good as Waterloo Sunset.''
Most scriptwriters must wish they were as good as Jennifer Saunders.
Why is Absolutely Fabulous (BBC2, Thursday) so funny? Role reversal
between the generations doesn't explain all. The splendours of Joanna
Lumley are no longer a revelation. Laughing at media clowns is no longer
a novelty. Yet the thing remains superb.
Controlled hysteria has something to do with it but here, in contrast
to something like Fawlty Towers, control matters more than hysteria.
Even mania has its checks and balances, its advances and reversals. But
how is it done? To this topic we shall return, not least since this is
the last series that will be made. And that's not funny at all.

If you want to get ahead . . . get a
pretty one, and tart it up. Anvar Khan
joins the massed throngs at a
Glasgow convention for would-be
models and hairdressers
THIRTY teenagers in adult outfits sat emotionless while stylists,
make-up artists and hairdressers pitched in. Wannabe models were being
groomed and painted by wannabe famous hairdressers. For this was the
regional leg of The L'Oreal Colour Trophy Event 1995, the entrants'
remit to create ''the definitive look of the year'' using L'Oreal
products. The action was live, performed under the beady eye of the
public. Tonight, four Scottish teams would reach the finals in London in
May. Fifty grand's worth of consumer publicity was assured for the
winner. And everybody wanted to win.
It looked like karaoke night in the Glasgow Hilton Hotel lobby. A
booted, bevvied, bravado of wee hairies from every part of the city were
out for a laugh. Every sunbed in the city must have been fully booked in
the run-up to the competition. But it wasn't just the tanning which was
fast. The girls were too. Someone's pale, underage, undernourished
daughter, in an off the shoulders (why show one when you've got two)
lilac body-jumper nodded to my boyfriend to meet her in the corridor
outside. When that didn't work, she skipped backwards and forwards,
smiling hopefully at him, as we made for the lift. Without wanting to
sound ageist, the fashion business is a young one. Kids love it. They
believe that when you have the right look you have ultimate sexual
power. And some of them want to gauge just how much.
And so to the second floor and the real party. The members of each
competing hairdressing salon, from the top stylist to the lassie who
brushed the floor, were ordering from the bar and then trooping next
door to spectate. The air was chemical with hairspray fumes --
ozone-friendly but bad for the lungs -- and hot with 30 industrial
dryers on full blast. The white cloth-covered tables set regimentally
under the football pitch lights, as if at a wedding.
Large, black electric cables were taped to the carpet floor, snaking
the room as if a mole had taken the wrong underground bypass and doubled
back. Silver accessories the size of buckets decimated the suite:
nozzles, binbags of rollers, tongs, crimpers, metal cases of make-up,
mirrors, giant cans of hairspray, gel, conditioner, wax, brushes of
every thickness and sponges of every shape took up every chair and every
inch of floorspace. People fitted into the rest. Teams of men and women
whose sole remit was to tease, backcomb and twist; squabble over the
reinvention of brunettes, redheads, blondes, browns, blues; drying,
squirting, smoothing, tweaking. There were salon girls on standby with
extra mousse.
The gum-chewing hairdressers themselves were obviously under severe
stress, masticating with a vengeance as the allocated hour ran out.
''Remember,'' a fortysomething five-piece suit badgered his
17-year-old model, ''react to the judges! Pretend you've just walked
into a pub and seen something you fancy!''.
Stillness is an asset during hairshows. Limbs are extraneous during
the make-over, only when the lassies take the catwalk are they used to
the full. Even then, the lack of practice shows. No. 27 was walking the
plank. Stomping No. 30's piece de resistance was throwing open her
blazer to reveal a black wonderbra, more Godzilla than Jerry Hall. The
word in the gents' toilets (don't ask) was that No. 22 was going to win.
The one in the yellow.
Faith in the authority of beauty is strong. If you could choose
between being rich, famous or deeply, deeply attractive, the blessing of
beauty could automatically earn you the other two. The clodhopping
hordes of peroxide hair and bovver boots had come to pay their respects.
This was a generation educated by the success of the supermodel. The
right body, the right face could get you anywhere. World domination was
possible by looks alone. Now they wanted to see how it was done. This
wasn't merely theatre, it was life skills.
''Hairdressers,'' boomed an anonymous voice over the mike and loud,
loud, club music, ''you have five minutes left.''
At the last minute, stylists just went for the spray. The crowd stood
grim-faced to the soundtrack of M-People. The models simpered as the
last clip was extricated from pomanders of curls. Style influences
included TV's Dallas, The Avengers, St Trinian's and the Greek goddess
Aphrodite.
The public and the press gangs, the salon teams and staff evacuated to
leave their models standing five feet apart, in a hip-jutting poise,
like the remaining skittles after a major shot -- wooden and wobbly.
Stepford Ladies Choice, grape-treading the floor signifying the pain of
high heels.
''Could the audience please move back so as not to distress the
models?'' announced a L'Oreal rep to the guzzling and smoking hordes a
mere two feet from the mannequins' toes. A child in a pink suit with a
forties crop and slingback heels swayed, fluttered her lids, and was
quickly manouvered on to a chair. The concerned fetched tumblers of
water. And while she drank they sorted her hair.
''Don't look up at the lights then,'' hissed a well-meaning pal to a
model whose eyes were running because she had focused her false-lashed
eyeballs at the ceiling. Someone stepped out the crowd with a tissue,
and dabbed her cheek. They did the same when her nose started to run.
A judge used her clipboard to block out the light to check the shade
of a golden, Shirley Temple mop. Annie Lennox, mistress of the
make-over, sang plaintively of love. Four winning teams scampered
onstage to screams and wolf-whistles from loyal supporters. And as the
lights faded, the winners whooped and the losers limped home, the
beautiful to party and the ugly to dream; someone's mum, after a sherry
too many, took to the catwalk and spent a couple of minutes wiggling her
bum as her pals in the corner merrily clapped along.

THERE has been much comment and speculation about the possibility of a
university in South-west Scotland, with particular reference to the
Crichton Hospital site. While I would not wish to deny the probable need
for such a development, or to suggest that it will not some day take
place, I do not believe that the project has much chance of success in
the present economic climate.
The Government, presumably concerned about demands on the public
purse, is seeking to set a ceiling on the number of full-time students
in higher education, and a new university, in Dumfries or elsewhere,
would almost certainly lead to an increase in such numbers if
inefficient reductions at other institutions were to be avoided. Added
to this is the fact that there are already 13 universities in Scotland,
of which five have been established in the past two years.
A more productive way forward for Dumfries and Galloway is likely to
be based on the expansion of franchised courses of existing universities
offered, mainly but not exclusively, on a part-time basis in the
Dumfries and Galloway area.
Dumfries and Galloway College is already well established on this
path. In addition to a variety of articulation agreements with a number
of Scottish universities which provide advanced study for our students,
of whom some 500 are engaged on full-time advanced courses, the college
has negotiated a range of degree-level opportunities for locally based
students.
A full-time first-year Napier course in business administration has
now been available for two years and the college has more recently
concluded agreements with the University of Paisley for third-year Cats
degree opportunities in health studies and business administration, both
by part-time study.
In conjunction with Glasgow Caledonian University, the college is
tendering for the provision of pre-registration nursing education and
intends to continue to seek an ever-increasing range of degree-level
courses in collaboration with appropriate universities. Many of these
courses could be delivered on the Crichton site.
I suggest that this is the effective platform on which the university
lobby should build its campaign so that, at some future date, a
degree-awarding institution may be founded in the area.

I WAS, as I imagine were most of my fellow countrymen and women,
delighted to watch Peter Capaldi receive his Oscar for Franz Kafka's
It's A Wonderful Life. Apart from the (increasingly unsettling) sense of
national pride it evoked in me, it was refreshing to witness the
international recognition of a piece of art originating from the west
coast of Scotland which did not insist that characters were only worth
while if they came from a background of social deprivation and spoke in
a parochial, almost incomprehensible, and intellectually limiting form
of ''Scots''.
Missing, but not missed, were the now almost obligatory ex-Barlinnie
inmate with a heart of gold; scenes of domestic violence which somehow
seem to indicate the worthiness in human terms of the recipient; mental
abuse added to physical in the form of alcohol or drug abuse, again used
as some mystifying justification of the character's pertinence;
down-and-outs who we are supposed to see as being as heroic as
characters from ancient mythologies.
With Capaldi's surreal comedy as an example, perhaps those involved in
the arts can become realistic about what would be a positive way forward
for Scottish culture.
He has picked up where Bud Neill left off with the excellent Lobey
Dosser: he has absorbed influences from the alien cultures which have
become part of our daily lives, added to them his peculiarly Scottish
sense of humour and perspective, and produced a work that can be
appreciated within, and shared beyond, this land of self-stifled
potential.

ELIZABETH HURLEY -- a woman famous only for her relationship with
award-winning actor Hugh Grant, and gracing the tabloids in a Versace
dress held together by safety pins -- is now set to become even more of
a superficial star as the new face of Estee Lauder. Hurley will sell the
company's fragrance, cosmetics, and skincare range through an
international advertising campaign.
The actress's appeal as a healthy, wholesome model is not immediately
apparent. Hurley is a cross between Elizabeth Taylor and Princess
Margaret. She was, until recently, often snapped by the paparazzi
holding a fag and a drink, her eyes slightly sozzled with too much
champagne, her thin body leaning Pisa-like, this way or that, either
with laughter or in an attempt to strike the pose she is most sure
flatters. Hurley is as unapologetically hard-nosed as the temperamental,
wilful film star. In her personal life, Elizabeth Taylor feigned illness
to get attention; Hurley feigned success.
Princess Margaret was more than happy to let slip a less than
glamorous image. Hurley offered the same to the snappers who
gate-crashed her and her partner's public-school mob knees-up, thespian
breakfasts at dawn, and various opening ceremonies of various films. In
the Princess's case it was probably an unconscious attempt at appearing
as an ordinary, 60-a-day person; with Hurley, a self-conscious design to
appear as the girl next door. In both cases, you can only slum it if you
are of a high social calibre in the first place. No-one really wants to
have to do it for real.
But all cosmetic houses have enough faith in their abilities to change
any body and face into the desired image. What can't be done with
make-up and lighting can be acquired through the re-touching of
photographs. Models are the bare canvas. The more plain a face the more
make-up it can take. When she recently appeared in court to testify
against a gang of girls who mugged her, 29-year-old Hurley wore dark
glasses, leggings, a tight cardigan, and a leather jacket. Most might
have dressed up in a suit. The difference is clear. Hurley has got very
far without quite making the effort.

I WAS fascinated by John Macleod's investigation into Willie McRae's
death and support his call for a public inquiry. However, Macleod makes
too much of the incorrect map reference at the site of his death.
The offical map reference was, he tells us, 21 95 80 66 (although map
references should never be shown in couplets) and it is obvious that the
error was in including the first and fifth digit, not, as Macleod
supposes, the first and last.
These two redundant digits should only be included when 12-figure
co-ordinates are given. What we are left with is a six-figure map
reference; 195066, which is within 200 metres of Macleod's
interpretation. I have not immediately dashed to the site of the
memorial cairn to check its exact location, though I know the area quite
well. However, checking the map, the reference of 195066 is certainly
close enough to have been reasonably calculated by an intelligent person
equipped with a map but without survey equipment.

JOHN MacLEOD displays all the skills of a fine investigative
journalist in his fascinating article on the mysterious death of Willie
McRae. It is doubtful, however, if the relevant authorities will accede
to his well-argued demand for a police investigation followed by a
public inquiry.
If the authorities do remain inactive, the ordinary citizen will
continue to feel the contemporary lack of confidence in the rule of law
and this cannot be for the public good.

IN an Ordnance Survey map reference the first two figures refer to the
sheet number. Following this sheet number, a four-figure reference
locates an area very accurately.
Is there a possibility that an old OS grid system, for example, before
metrication, was used by the police in the McRae investigation? It is
possible that the local police used an OS map with this outdated sheet
number.

YOU are to be congratulated on the series of articles on the late
Willie McRae. Much has been written in speculation on the circumstances
of his death but at last we have an article by his former partner, Len
Murray, full of joyful recollections of his life.
I have many memories of his enormous energy, great generosity, and
sharp wit during election campaigns in the seventies in Wester Ross. He
had a vast store of knowledge of Scotland, India, Israel, and the Second
World War. There is plenty of material to be gathered up and made into a
book on his life, and this would make better reading than speculation on
the circumstances of his death.
Willie McRae's goal in life was independence for Scotland. He would
talk about making April 6 a day of celebration; it is the anniversary of
the signing of the Declaration of Independence at Arbroath Abbey in
1320.
He maintained it would be more civilised if we made that day the one
to remember rather than the blood and gore of Bannockburn on June 24,
although the weather could be better then for rallies and picnics than
on April 6.
It has for 10 years struck me as very strange that Willie McRae would
take his own life on that day.

THE dictionary defines spectacular and glossy as lavish and lustrous
respectively, and both adjectives were very obviously lacking in the
latest offering from Mr David Shaw's inappropriately named theatrical
company.
Spectacular and Glossy Productions had attracted some of the best of
Glasgow's talent from established amateur companies to produce City of
Angels, which turned out to be something defying the Trade Descriptions
Act.
Apart from the fact that one required a magnifying glass to discover
the amateur status of this group, it also came in handy when looking for
''a roller-coaster ride of hysterical dialogue, fabulous toe-tapping
dance tunes'' -- hysterical, certainly, we almost were, after an
hour-and-a-half of Act One.
Before I hear cries of financial constraint, effort, and hard work for
all involved in amateur productions, etc, let me say that I have been
there and I have done it all. What amazes me is that people with talent,
in their desire to appear in Scottish premieres or fresh productions, do
not first take the trouble to check out the quality of the material.
I hate being conned, and that is exactly how I felt about this show
with the hype, West End prices, third-rate material, and, regrettably,
performances to match.

K A SUTHERLAND can be expected to promote his Railway Development
Society but he and other rail buffs must face reality (March 28). As
rail replaced horses and canals, so road has now overtaken rail as the
means of transport for freight, fuel, food, and people. Only full train
loads of freight are likely to be conveyed by rail.
Franchising is in progress seeking tenders to run the InterCity east
coast line from London to Edinburgh/Aberdeen/Inverness and for an
improved InterCity west coast service from London via Glasgow to Fort
William.
Given a franchise for the commuter conurbation served by Strathclyde
Passenger Transport Executive, preferably by means of a management
buyout dedicated to efficiency and a competitive passenger service, does
Scotland need more rail? Without massive subsidy does ScotRail really
have a future?
Since good road transport has become such an essential ingredient in
the quality of life in the remote rural areas of the far north and west,
would the vast majority of people living there not prefer taxpayers'
money to be spent on improved road links?

COUNCILLOR Gordon and Mr Carruthers (Strathclyde director of roads)
should beware. U-turns on motorways have disastrous consequences -- and
of course a double U-turn means you carry on in the same old tired
direction that has been acknowledged to be wrong.
Mr Carruthers appears to accept the correctness of the Government's
U-turn on motorway policy (ie, no more motorways because they only
create congestion/pollution) but then counters this by saying that
Glasgow's policy will be to continue to expand the motorway network
which will bring traffic ever more quickly into an already choking city
centre and then, having got it there, to make parking space so expensive
and difficult to obtain that the poor motorist will wish he had left his
car at home and used public transport, which Messrs Carruthers and
Gordon undertake to improve without detailing how.
I suspect the crucial factor behind the decision to continue to expand
the motorway network is a political one in that the money has already
been granted and must now begin to be spent before the demise of
Strathclyde or it will revert to the Government. Labour councils don't
refund money to Conservative governments.
It is a sad commentary on the grotesque distortion of our social
values and priorities that while the NHS and all the emergency services
are disintegrating from lack of finances, the council is preparing to
spend #500m between two motorway extensions and a proposed tramway which
we have somehow managed to live without for more than 25 years.
But Glasgow's public officials have a poor record when it comes to
decisions taken ostensibly in the public interest and which have
impacted badly on the welfare of its citizens.

Kirsty Scott examines whether the alarming increase in suicides among
young people owes anything to music with lyrics which might push
depressed and vulnerable listeners over
the edge
RAY and James spent six hours listening to their favourite band,
smoking dope and drinking before they each placed the barrel of a gun
under their chins and pulled the trigger. Ray, 18, died instantly.
James, 20, was horrifically injured but survived for three years before
dying of an overdose.
Their suicide pact became a cause celebre in America after the band
they had been listening to, Judas Priest, was accused, and ultimately
cleared, of contributing to their deaths by subliminal messages in their
songs.
That was a decade ago, but the tortuous debate over music and its
alleged potential to stitch up the patchwork emotions of young minds has
not lessened in the intervening years.
In roughly the same 10-year period suicides among young men aged
between 15 and 24 in Scotland have risen by 120%. New research has found
that up to 20% of Scottish 15 to 19-year-olds suffer from depression or
anxiety, and up to half of Scottish girls are on a diet at any one time.
In 1993, five boys between 10 and 14 took their lives north of the
Border.
Across the UK, surveys paint pictures not so much of Generation X, but
of a generation in exile, devoid of hope and long-term employment,
splintered by broken homes, gazes fixed resolutely inwards. Meanwhile,
many of today's most popular bands, like Nirvana and Manic Street
Preachers, deliver a dead-end gospel of depression and low self-esteem.
''I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo,'' sing Radiohead. ''What the hell am I
doing here. I don't belong here.''
This week the music magazine Melody Maker created a forum for young
people to purge their souls about everything from self-abuse and suicide
to their misunderstood affection for rock idols.
The initiative was prompted by an unprecedented tide of despair
following the recent disappearance of Manic Street Preachers' guitarist
Richey James. James had spoken out in the magazine about his own
depression, anorexia and self-mutilation and had obviously struck a
chord with the readership.
''The response we got to his piece was absolutely astonishing,'' said
MM's Andrew Mueller. ''We felt a bit intimidated and out of our depth.
We are now trying to give people an outlet because they have not got
anywhere else.'' The new issue includes articles from a clinical
psychologist and a representative of the Samaritans.
Mueller said the issues raised by James's disappearance needed to be
addressed but dismissed suggestions that music was the spark which
ignites teen turmoil.
''Issues like anorexia and self-abuse have always been there. It's not
that this cult of self-abuse has sprung up because of one dead and one
missing rock star. There are a lot of people who clearly feel alienated
who will gravitate towards bands like Nirvana and the Manic Street
Preachers, but there are thousands more who gravitate to bands like Take
That.
''The Generation X label irritates me. In the past five to 10 years
popular culture has become more and more fragmented, to such an extent
that it's more difficult to generalise about young people now than it
has ever been.''
Professor Stewart Asquith, of Glasgow University's Centre for the
Study of the Child and Society, has been researching children's
lifestyles in Scotland and in Europe. His findings have revealed an
unprecedented sense of marginalisation and alienation among young
people.
''They feel that they are powerless,'' he said. ''There is a sense of
uncertainty about where they are going in their lives.
''I think we have a generation of parents who are questioning all
kinds of traditional values, beliefs and behaviours. In that respect it
is pretty hard for parents to pass on to kids notions of certainty, of
where the world is going and what their place is.
''I do feel it's more difficult for young people to get themselves
ready for adulthood these days. They are worried about getting a job,
there is tremendous pressure to get qualifications at school and lack of
money is emphasised in a world which is highly consumer-orientated.''
Professor Asquith said research pointed to a correlation between the
state of the labour market and family breakdown, and suicide rates among
the young. Those who blame music for the despair felt by many youngsters
should be looking at the bigger picture.
''Just as music sometimes goes to an extreme, it reflects the fact
that kids can be on the edge as well. I think the music taps into
something that the children are experiencing. It's a neat deflection to
say it's music that's to blame, that it's not the world that we have
created for our kids.''
Joan, an official from the Samaritans in Scotland, said they are
concerned at the rising tide of juvenile despair but could not pinpoint
one factor.
''You can't say there's one thing which causes someone to feel
suicidal . . . it's really how they feel about these things, how these
things make them feel helpless, worthless, with no control over their
lives.
''Certainly there's a lot more uncertainty in life, there are fewer
people living in stable families, there's more unemployment. I think
there is a tremendous amount of pressure on kids who are about 10 years
old. They are thinking about going to secondary school, the TV is full
of things like redundancies, broken homes. Maybe they hear about all the
difficulties in life and they don't have the maturity or the experience
to know how they are going to cope with it.''
On the impact of music, Joan said that anything which contributed to a
feeling of worthlessness was not helpful.
''People who feel suicidal feel they're not good enough for life, it's
not that life is not good enough for them. Any trend towards making
people feel worthless is dangerous. If rock music is saying people are
worthless, that's not a terrific idea.''
Radio Clyde DJ Tom Russell has presented the station's rock show for
14 years and doesn't believe the current crop of bands are more
depressive than those that have come before.
''I think we have seen it in every generation. Think of country and
western songs that were so popular in the forties and fifties: Patsy
Cline, Boxcar Willie, even Sydney Devine. You know the kind of thing --
''my wife has left me I'm feeling so low and so down''. What more
depressing stuff could you get than that? Think about blues music. I
don't think it's anything new, I really don't.''
Russell doesn't believe musicians should have to watch their lyrics,
although they should be responsible in their public lives. Nor does he
think young people are any more starstruck today than previous
generations.
''I don't think that writing a depressing song with depressing lyrics
is negating their responsibility. I don't think we worship rock stars
any more than we used to, either. In the eighties we worshipped Duran
Duran, in the seventies Led Zeppelin, in the sixties the Beatles.''
In the sprawl of Glasgow's Drumchapel housing estate, where young men
are committing suicide at an ever-increasing rate, one group of
youngsters is adamant that downbeat lyrics just don't figure on the
scale of pressures and worries.
David, Mark, Eric and Robert, all fifth-year pupils at Drumchapel High
School, are fairly sanguine when it comes to the influence bands and
musicians have on their lives.
They all have different tastes and the worst they've come across is a
fellow teen who wrecked his room and ran away from home -- briefly --
after learning that Nirvana's lead singer, Kurt Cobain, had committed
suicide.
''It's a bit daft; it's just a person,'' said Mark, 17.
They seem perplexed by suggestions that music or musicians could push
someone to the very edge.
''Some of the music is depressing and some of it isn't,'' said Mark,
who likes grunge bands. ''People would have to be seriously ill in the
head if they took it seriously.''
''Really, it's the generation thing,'' said Robert, 17. ''When the
people who are saying this were young themselves there was probably the
same issue; people thinking that about rock'n'roll when it first came
out.''
Eric, 17, thinks adults should be more worried at young girls'
obsession with bands like Take That. His girlfriend dissolves into tears
every time she sees them on television.
David, who's 16, thinks everyone should lighten up and not trivialise
depression by ascribing it to music.
''In Drumchapel there are many more problems. There's nothing to do
for a start,'' he said. ''I would say it's ridiculous that people are
saying someone listened to music and committed suicide. Something's
obviously happened in their life and they've gone over the edge. You
can't take it too seriously. It's just music.''

STEWART LAMONT, Jack Webster, Ruth Wishart, and others have done the
church generally a favour in the sense that each of them, in their own
way, has recently highlighted the woolly-headed, muddled thinking of the
church in some quarters.
Ruth Wishart and Jack Webster may be said to see the church through
the eyes of the outside observer (though they may be nominal members of
the church for all I know). Stewart Lamont is the enemy within and is
perhaps more representative of the church's heretical element.
It seems to me that the only sane, sensible, and level-headed writer
on church matters these days is John Macleod. A dozen city preachers
immediately spring to mind who are faithful to the old truths of Holy
Writ but they are preachers not writers.
There appear to be plenty of theological fools around who are doing
their utmost to change truth. I call it moving the goal posts.
These theologians and preachers have moved the goal posts as far as
the Bible itself is concerned. Where do these goal posts have their
roots? ''Thy Word is truth.'' The goal posts for centuries have been
rooted and grounded in the scriptures as the word of God.
But the talk now in most theological circles (thank God not in all) is
that the Bible merely contains the word of God and is not necessarily,
in its entirety, the infallible word. So the goal posts have been moved
from their central position. Modern scholarship has been substituted for
the word.

LAWYERS made a basic error when they sued for damages on behalf of a
client -- they failed to ask for any money.
The mistake was not picked up for seven months until legal documents
went to the printers, a judge was informed.
Mrs Williamina Wilson, a school cleaner, from Carrick Crescent,
Easthouses, Dalkeith, Midlothian, sued Lothian Regional Council after
contracting industrial dermatitis.
Her solicitors, Robin Thompson and Partners, instructed an advocate to
draft the summons for Mrs Wilson's action in the Court of Session, but
when it was being typed in the lawyers' office, the demand for damages
of #50,000, plus the expenses of the action, was omitted.
The mistake was made in December 1993, but the case went through
various stages until July last year when the closed record -- the final
version of Mrs Wilson's claim and the council's defences -- was being
drawn up.
When the legal pleadings were sent to the printers for copies to be
made, the printers drew the solicitors' attention to the fact that there
was no sum sued for in the summons.
The case went to the Court of Session where Lord Osborne was asked to
allow Mrs Wilson to amend her case to include a conclusion for #50,000
and expenses.
Mr Paul Cullen, counsel for Mrs Wilson, accepted that it was a
regrettable state of affairs, and plainly there had been a regrettable
failure to comply with court rules.
He explained that if the amendment to the summons was refused, Mrs
Wilson's action would be dismissed as incompetent and could not start
again as it would be time-barred.
Mr Peter McCormack, counsel for Lothian Region, asked the judge to
dismiss the case. He submitted that the summons was in breach of the
rules, and null and void.
He contended that Mrs Wilson and her legal advisers were to blame for
what had happened because, at an early stage, the council had tabled a
plea to the competency of the action and alarm bells should have been
ringing from that point.
Mr McCormack said that there had been a significant degree of
negligence on the part of Mrs Wilson's advisers and her remedy was to
raise a damages action against her solicitors.
Lord Osborne ruled, however, that the summons could be amended and
said: ''From the outset, it was perfectly plain that both parties were
under no misapprehension as to the nature of the claim which Mrs Wilson
was seeking to assert.
''It seems to me that the unfortunate omission from the summons is the
result of an unhappy clerical oversight which has caused no prejudice to
Lothian Region.
''It appears to me that Mrs Wilson ought not to suffer prejudice
herself as a result of this mishap.''
A spokesman for Robin Thompson and Partners commented afterwards: ''It
was a typing error not picked up by the person dealing with the case.
It's the sort of technical matter you tend not to pay a lot of attention
to.
''This firm has handled many thousands of Court of Session actions and
it's the first time anything like this has ever happened.''

THE Pope scores high in many qualities -- sincerity, consistency,
strength of conviction are among them. His latest encyclical, Evangelium
Vitae (The Gospel of Life), exhibits all three qualities. In 194 pages
it restates in firm and uncompromising terms the Roman Catholic Church's
opposition to any form of abortion, euthanasia, and embryo
experimentation. Indeed it seems to go further by suggesting that civil
law which permits abortion and euthanasia ''ceases to be true, morally
binding law'' and imposes a clear obligation ''to oppose by
conscientious objection''.
This could (and probably will) be interpreted by many pro-life
campaigners as a blessing for civil disobedience. Especially since the
Pope goes out of his way to define abortion as murder. ''We need more
than ever to look truth in the eye and to call things by their proper
name . . . we are dealing with murder.'' No qualifications or
exceptions. Murder. Pure and simple. The Pope doesn't call a spade a
spade, or even a bloody shovel. He calls it a murder weapon.
This creates difficulties for some of us who admire the compassion
which motivates the Roman Catholic Church's stance on this issue. Just
because we would allow for some circumstances in which abortion and
euthanasia would be desirable does not make us supporters of abortion on
demand or wholescale slaughter of the weak and defenceless. Our
difficulty is not that we feel guilty about our position (which, I hope
can be admitted, is held with equal sincerity) but that we find it
difficult to be consistent and clear about a moral grey in a world of
black and white moral absolutes.
The strength of the Roman Catholic position (shared by many
conservative evangelical Protestants) is that it is founded upon a moral
absolute and defends this rigorously and consistently. The weakness of
the liberal Protestant is that he appears to saw off the limb upon which
he sits when he advocates abortion in some situations (the most
compelling being that of rape). He emerges looking like someone who lets
the world, or pragmatism, set his moral agenda by being prepared to
ditch a moral absolute (the right to life) to the needs of a situation.
His only real defence is to argue that the embryo is not a life and has
no rights. This does not seem to cut much ice in today's world.
I would like to propose another way of looking at the issue which does
not involve attacking the Roman Catholic position but involves seeing it
as complementary to the promotion of birth control. I am well aware that
artificial methods of contraception are anathema to the Vatican, but
even in his most fervent moments the Pope would not hold that they
murder anyone since by definition they prevent a fertilised embryo. I
would like to see two principles emerge as the moral guidelines on human
life, the bookends between which knowledge is found, the goal posts
between which the game is played.
The first would be sanctity of life (as understood by the Pope), and
the second would be the need to limit and control the creation of new
life according to social, ecological, and individual situations.
Let us look for a moment at the human context into which this week's
encyclical has come. When Christ was born the population of the world
was some 200-300 million. By 1650 it was 500 million and thanks to the
wealth generated by the Industrial Revolution it had doubled to one
billion by 1850. Note that the second doubling took 200 years compared
with 1500 years for the first. It took only 80 years (until 1930) for
the next doubling (to two billion). By 1975 (45 years) it had doubled
again to four billion and by 1992 it was five-and-a-half billion, with a
projection of eight billion by the end of the century.
We have reached a situation in which there are more people alive today
than have ever lived.
Does anyone seriously think this is sustainable in terms of food,
economics, and meaningful employment? The exponential growth of the
world's population is not a staircase to heaven on earth where sanctity
of life will abound, but a crazy spiral which will lead to hell on
earth, especially since the highest birth rates are often in countries
where there is already extreme poverty (as in Brazil) or political
tension (as in Israel, where the Palestinian birth rate is far higher
than the Israeli one).
These facts and figures cannot be ignored. To do so is irresponsible
and morally negligent. Proclaiming the sanctity of life and doing
nothing to promote the positive advantages of birth control and family
planning is a kind of biological time bomb just as threatening to world
peace and stability as the threat of nuclear annihilation once was.
It is good and right that those who share the Pope's beliefs keep
reminding us of our responsibility towards human life, to cherish and
conserve it. But it is also good and right that those who believe in
family planning and population control should keep reminding us that
human life is not something that should be created randomly or
routinely, but responsibly with due consideration of the context in
which it will grow.
For one thing, such an approach is more likely to lead to a reduction
in the discreditable practice of abortion as birth control by
afterthought. Instead of attacking the principle of sanctity of life (or
undermining it by allowing abortion and euthanasia in certain
circumstances) Protestants and liberal Catholics would be better
employed promoting the idea that those who are responsible for producing
human life must do so responsibly. Between those two absolutes a
healthier society might grow, in the middle ground, where quality
matters more than quantity.

DOCTOR John Angus MacLeod, former senior consultant radiologist for
Perth District Hospitals, has died. He was 78.
Educated at Whitehill School, Glasgow, he continued his studies at
Glasgow University, gaining his BSC in 1936. Five years later, he
graduated MB, CHB, also from Glasgow.
His first posts were at Mearns Kirk Hospital and Stirling Royal
Infirmary. He became consultant radiologist at Bridge of Earn Hospital
then senior consultant radiologist for Perth district until his retiral
in 1981. He was also senior lecturer at Dundee University and lectured
at Perth College of Nursing.
He is survived by his wife, Dorothy, a daughter and three sons.

ROCK drummer Bill Berry, 36, from REM, has been released from hospital
and is recuperating after brain surgery, his record company WEA said
yesterday.
Berry collapsed with violent headaches during a show in Switzerland
and was operated on earlier this month for a brain haemorrhage.
The four-piece group from Athens, Georgia, have had to cancel sell-out
shows.
However, they will go ahead with four outdoor concerts in July,
including one in Edinburgh.

Multiple Pulitzer Prize winner Arthur Miller is a staunch defender of
the right to free speech. He is outraged at an incidence of
self-censorship in America where pressure from the extreme right caused
textbook publishers to omit 350 lines from the Shakespearean classic
Romeo and Juliet as being too sexually suggestive
CENSORSHIP is symptomatic, especially in our time, of a certain fear
of the truth; of truth as the destroyer of the peace. Almost all
societies today are held together by very slender threads, which there
is widespread fear that truth can sever.
Governments have been forever trying to possess and control artists,
and through their art to further their control of the people. There is
hardly a place on earth where censorship of the arts does not exist in
some form.
Like lightning, censorship and oppression appear to strike from above
but actually only strike where a negative charge is silently collecting
deep down in the earth.
What person -- Jew, Catholic, Muslim, black, white, Asian -- has not
been outraged by an aspersion against his group sufficient to make him
want to suppress it?
The danger of censorship, therefore, is in our collaboration with it.
Is there a solution to this contradiction?
The solution which the men who wrote the American Constitution came up
with in the First Amendment, which forbids the Government to interfere
with free speech, understood that without such a guarantee there could
be no democracy. They recognised not only humanity's longing for liberty
but its willingness to deprive others of theirs.
After all, many if not all of the men who signed the constitution
owned black slaves. So they lived with paradox and understood it and
unfortunately accepted paradox when it was to their profit. My point
here is that there are no societies of such high virtue as to make
repression impossible.
I must say that it is harder and harder to imagine such an amendment
being passed today.
At bottom, censorship is probably a fear of the alienated, of the
individual with a personal rather than a mass view of life, and will
have to be struggled with until the end of time. The only question
really is what support the legal system will give to those who appeal to
it for the freedom to speak.
In America, there is a never-ending battle to keep speech and
literature and art free of the censors, at the moment mainly from the
far right.
Their object is usually to remove any sexual references from
schoolbooks and curricula, but, of course, the thirst for political
power is at the bottom of it. And it is not a democratic ideal that lies
behind this campaign. The ultimate aim is theocracy, an American version
of Iran, with politics and religion inextricably mixed so that Jesus
Christ will be the big policeman protecting the status quo.
The religious right, where they have the power to do so, forbid any
ideas other than their own to circulate, censoring books in schools and
television programmes in their localities. And in academia a number of
people would feel personally compromised to allow ideas that they think
are false to be taught or published.
It is not only the Government that invokes censorship; it is also a
human problem.
Few will admit they favour censorship, in America at any rate. But a
lot of us, at the same time, don't want to look at or read certain
things or allow others to read them. Censorship and oppression do not
come entirely from above but from within as well.
Most American censorship does not come from the federal Government, in
fact. In place of the communist demon, today we seem to be fitfully
erecting a structure of fear of sexuality that can only be called
quasi-official.
Under pressure from the far right, large American textbook
manufacturers have exised some 350 lines of Romeo and Juliet as being
too sexually suggestive.
Fear, or more accurately hatred of sexuality, consigns tens of
thousands of our high school students to fraudulent versions of these
masterworks. The worst of it is that such censorship, such fear, finally
becomes internalised in the people who are opposed to it.
I know for a fact that artists, poets and writers applying these days
to the National Endowment for the Arts for grants are taking particular
care to avoid any indication that their proposed work might be either
sexually candid, or worse yet, implicitly or explicitly even tolerant of
homosexuality.
Thus the artist becomes his own censor. This is the way freedom is not
only killed but buried without a trace, for the next step after
censoring yourself is to deny that you've done it.
The answer to lies is truth, not silence, but it is sometimes hard to
remember that.
In the end, the only safeguard of the people against the violence of
arbitrary government is free speech, and the rock upon which free speech
stands is law and the faithful tendency of the people in holding on to
the law at any cost.
The fact remains that where speech is free, progress is far greater
than where it is constrained.
I believe that one of the main reasons the Soviet system collapsed was
that the reality of Soviet life was forbidden to be examined -- the
press, for example, was prohibited from looking into the real
backwardness of Russian industry and agriculture -- all in order to
preserve a social cohesion that was specious and fraudulent and finally
could not pretend to function.
One thing is certain, it seems to me: Man is weak and will find ways
to internalise what, in fact, he is being compelled to believe and do.
Censorship is fear; fear spreads; that is its nature.
America is the world's freest society, I believe, not necessarily
because the living have made it so, but because past generations, bred
in tyranny, so longed for liberty that had never existed before that
they created what they had imagined.
We must re-imagine liberty in every generation, especially since a
certain number of people are always afraid of it. To say it is a
never-ending struggle is not to despair but simply to affirm that in our
time, as far as we are able, we will not let down the generations that
preceded us nor the ones who will come after we are gone.
The struggle to achieve the fullness of our humanity can never end.
The attempt to cut it short, to censor it, always deepens despair. But
from the unimpeded search for truth comes hope and joy.

WE have made a promise to ourselves and to you, our readers. In what
follows there will be a strict balance maintained at all costs. There
will be no concessions to emotion or to shallow, silly Scottish
nationalism, even of the sporting sort. (But if the English TV
authorities think they can get away with blacking-out Scotland's first
Rugby World Cup game, they had better think again.) Feeling better? Now
we can look at the issues in what is, by any standards, a remarkably
annoying manifestation of short-sightedness by the authorities at ITN's
network headquarters. It should not have escaped the notice of anyone
sentient enough to breathe that Scottish rugby has reached new heights
of excitement and entertainment this year, with the national team now
the second-best team in Europe. Interest in Scotland's progress through
the Five Nations contest, culminating in the Grand Slam game against
England (lost through bad refereeing and England fielding one decent
player who happened to be able to kick) grew throughout the series, and
expectations have been whetted further by the prospect of the Rugby
World Cup in South Africa.
It would have been reasonable to expect that ITV, which outbid other
companies for the rights to televise the games in Britain, and which
paid #8m for the privilege, could have managed to show all of the
matches featuring British teams, and certainly those of the Grand Slam
winners, England (winners, if only through good fortune), and the
runners-up. Indeed, all opening games are being shown except the opening
game between Scotland and Tonga in Pretoria. There are no dark plots to
be uncovered in this affair. The reason given is that scheduling
problems, at a time in the evening when many viewers will be watching,
have meant that the Scottish game cannot be shown live. It is curious
that the next day, when Wales play New Zealand, the very real scheduling
problem of a clash with Coronation Street has been resolved by moving
the soap to another location. Admittedly, the game between Wales and New
Zealand will be a good one (with neither side relying utterly on one
decent player able to kick), but that is not the issue. Anyone who has
watched the joyous force of the Tongans (who do not kick very much) will
realise what an entertaining match they will have with Scotland.
This whole affair says much about the blinkered approach of many of
those who organise the televising of sport in the southern regions of
this country. There is, first and foremost, a preoccupation with issues
and teams relevant to those regions, then there is a recognition of the
benefits of other matches which may have implications for those teams,
as in the case of the New Zealand game against Wales. Stumbling along at
the end is any recognition of the importance of the rest, by which we
mean Scotland versus Tonga. Fortunately, there are ways around this
tunnel vision. Mr Gavin Hastings (who also kicks, but who does it with
style and in a good cause) has intervened. The Scottish television
companies led by STV have also expressed their determination to screen
the game live. We wish them well and look forward to a game of open,
running rugby.

SCOTLAND'S crumbling architecture has come under the spotlight in a
new report which calls for local authorities and private individuals to
help with their restoration.
The Scottish Civic Trust's annual Buildings at Risk bulletin has
identified almost 100 buildings which are in a state of decay or face
immediate risk of decay.
These range from the remains of a fourteenth 14th century Tayside
castle to a 1940s Edinburgh factory and 13 Railtrack stations. The Trust
claims all are in need of preservation to protect Scotland's rich
architectural heritage.
The most northerly example of the crumbling past is the allegedly
haunted 1707 Windhouse at Mid Yell in the Shetlands which is in danger
of total dereliction as a result of the northern isles weather.
The largest buildings on the new list are the former Springburn public
halls in Glasgow with its gothic architecture and the Argyll Motor Works
in Alexandria.
Torwood Castle at Larbert is litle more than a stone shell of its 16th
century glory and the trust has suggested that with major works it could
be used for residential purposes. The same criteria applies to the ruin
of Plunton Castle near Borgue in Galloway in its ''remote and idyllic
setting'' and Lordscairnie Castle near Cupar in Fife.
However, for sheer antiquity and potential none can match the remains
of the vaulted chambers and lands of the 14th century Ballumbie Castle
near Dundee which carries current planning application for conversion to
a retirement village, hotel, and golf course.
Redcastle near Muir of Ord in Highland Region was one of the oldest
continuously inhabited strongholds until it was deserted in the 1950s.
Castle of Eradour was built here in 1179 and with additions and
alterations -- the last in 1840 -- it is now a roofless shell which is
rapidily deteriorating.
Among examples of Scotland's role in the industrial revolution is
Wylie's Mill with water wheel at Drummore on the Rhins of Galloway. Its
condition is described as ''fair'' and the trust suggests a light
industrial use could be found.
A spokesman for the Scottish Civic Trust said: ''The buildings listed
are nearly all empty and in need of rescue and re-use, their condition
varying from a state of ruin to one of relatively sound repair, but
threatened with prolonged vacancy.
''Many are simply forgotten and neglected buildings which deserve a
better future. The owners may be only too happy to be contacted by
somebody willing to take a problem off their hands.
''Any potential restorers who feel that they might genuinely be able
to rescue one of these buildings -- and our register holds many more --
should investigate the situation further.''
The Scottish Civic Trust can be contacted at 24 George Square,
Glasgow, telephone: 0141 248 3398.

ECONOMICS may be ''the dismal science'' Adam Smith dubbed it, but it
has seldom, if ever, been an exact science, even when lots of numbers
have been at the disposal of its practitioners. This is more than an
academic weakness when practical affairs may turn on economic
calculations, and a perfect example is found in respect of the Scottish
economy and the extent to which it would be affected if it were a
separate entity. The first fact remains that ours is not a separate
economy but one intermeshed finely in the UK as a whole. Providing
precise and purely Scottish statistical evidence is impossible in
certain important areas -- so much depends on assumptions. Revenues from
off-shore oil might be a case in point. England would be entitled to
some, if the existing North Sea arrangements were effectively
maintained, but new lines were drawn within the UK sector to meet the
event of separation (under existing international rules, the
Anglo-Scottish line of demarcation would run north-eastwards from
Berwick on Tweed). The resultant revenues can fairly easily be
''guesstimated'', but the $64,000 question would concern Shetland and
its political future in a fragmented UK. Many other revenues -- and
spending allocations -- are hardly less problematical, defence spending
being a case in point.
The latest thinking on this topic from the Fraser of Allander
Institute in the University of Strathclyde, using the official
statistical evidence, argues what might be called the conventional view
of Scottish public finances. That is that Scotland is a net financial
beneficiary of the Union and would be a significant loser in the event
of separation, but not from devolution which leaves the existing pattern
of fiscal arrangements untouched, except (under the Labour proposals)
for the modest amount a Scottish assembly would be able to raise
independently. Nationalists must oppose such a conclusion since their
ambitions push far beyond devolution in spite of that word's elastic
qualities. They have to argue that a separate Scotland would impose no
automatic and harsh financial penalties on its people. They are acutely
sceptical of the existing statistical evidence which forms the basis of
the Scottish Office view and the Fraser of Allander Institute which uses
the same data. They may find some reassurance in different academic
calculations emanating from Edinburgh University, for these suggest that
such a vital constitutional change as separation would not have such
unfortunate financial consequences as predicated by the analysis of the
official statistics by Allander.
Cynics often complain that the main conclusion of any piece of
academic research is that more research has to be done. In this area a
very bitter debate is likely to develop between now and the next General
Election, and, depending on its outcome, for sometime after. There is a
powerful argument, therefore, in favour of as detached an analysis as
possible of the Scottish role in the contemporary UK economy, and
especially about its contribution to, and benefits from, the public
finances. That work may not convince everyone. It does not have to do
so. It should, however, be able to provide a substantial groundwork of
evidence sufficient to overturn conspiracy theorists and arm all
debaters with common econometric data to consider in their arguments.
People will then be able to make their own assessments, if not of the
raw data itself then of those who deploy it most convincingly to earn
their trust. No-one should be in any doubt that the issue is concrete.
It should not be turned by a collective emotional spasm but by the sort
of hard calculation which Scots are traditionally proud to be able to
make. On existing evidence such calculation still favours a continuing
Union, with more powers devolved from London.

This week, the makers of Pringle sweaters announced swingeing job
cuts, which
is dreadful news for their employees. But should we shed any tears for
their
customers? Anvar Khan thinks not
THIS week it was announced that nearly 500 jobs are to go at the
Pringle knitwear factory in Arbroath, its related knitting site in
Hawick and at yarn manufacturers Blackwood Brothers in Kilwinning. The
official line, to justify the latest recruits to the dole queue, was
that because of the mild winter, fewer people were wearing woolly
jumpers. But to blame climactic conditions instead of the economic, is
daft. And to insist that British consumers buy a Pringle jumper merely
to stave off the chill is false.
Nobody buys a Pringle jumper to keep warm. Everyone buys a Pringle
jumper because ownership signifies a state of mind and a calibre of
lifestyle, both of which have to be as comfortable and safe as the knit
itself. The Pringle logo has always been innocuous, except now where
it's shorthand for Giro.
Tennis has Lacoste, golf has Pringle. The brand is associated with
Sydney Divine on his day off, with Nick Faldo, with Colin Montgomerie,
of doocots in Fraser's where you go to choose a Christmas jumper for
Dad. The Pringle jumper is a uniform for the wet, tired, male, liberal
mind, for men with little enthusiasm for sexual adventure. It is not
that the Pringle jumper doesn't like sex, or even that golf is its
replacement. Just that he can stay the course longer at the club.
The man who owns a set of Pringle knitwear doesn't ask for what he
wants -- that's too gallus -- he merely hedges his bets, as
scientifically as he approaches each tee. Marriage is his option --
weddings are for those who've given up -- it excuses having to try to
get off with the opposite sex any more. Pringle jumpers know their
limits, and embrace their restrictions; the psychological, the emotional
and the sexual, with a Hamlet cigar and a sigh. This is what makes them
so contemptible -- the lack of fire.
The evidence most descriptive of the mindset of the Pringle fan is
when the company felt confident enough to sponsor the first national
sheep-counting championship in Jedburgh in June 1993. Pringle did not
feel a conflict of interest with golf. As they explained at the time:
''Speed-counting of sheep is a subject requiring great mental agility
and methods differ from shepherd to shepherd.'' In an attempt to attract
the hordes, they added: ''The day will include demonstrations of stick
dressing, spinning, shearing, dog-handling, and breed and fleece
identification.''
There have been many reasons put forward as to why Pringle have been
so successful. The legacy of Coco Chanel has even been trampled in the
rush.
''What Coco invented was a fashion whose time had come -- sports
clothes,'' says Axel Madsen, Chanel's biographer.
But Coco used simple, elegant lines coupled with fabrics which had
only ever been used for sport, a testament to her imagination rather
than the hidden charm of comfortable clothing. In truth, Chanel wanted
everyone to dress up, not down. And anyone who seriously believes that
to change into a Pringle jumper is to make an effort is hideously
deluded. Leisurewear has never been the pinnacle of fashion; it would
have been possible to live without shell-suits, tracksuit bottoms and
towelling socks.
The fly-the-flag Pringle pullover which Colin Montgomerie wore at the
Scottish Open in July 1992 proved a big hit. The Herald was inundated
with entries to our competition to win one of the first six saltire
sweaters available when Pringle began full-scale production that
September. Only about 1000 were made and they're collectors' items.
In that same year, Pringle reported huge sales of the sweaters Faldo
endorsed from the Pringle/Nick Faldo collection. At Turnberry in July
'94, he wore a Pringle Trophy Waistcoat, which, it was publicised, was
available in 10 colours.
Clearly, given the effectiveness of such advertising on the back of
players, the numerous men who buy Pringle want to share the world of the
famous golfer. The Pringle specimen likes the sharp, wind-cracking
drive, the consistency of purpose and self-control a professional game
of golf demands. The sainthood of being a good loser, the prestige which
comes with success.
Pringle customers believe themselves to be of a certain class --
''Golf is one of the peacock sports,'' Catriona Wemyss of the knitwear
company once said, ''not as far down the narcissistic scale as ski-ing
or tennis but it's on its way'' -- but golf's groupies, by choosing to
carbon-copy Faldo are no better and no worse than all the kids of
downtown poverty-stricken America who want the trainers endorsed by
basketball star Michael Jordan. The only difference is that consumers of
Pringle have the money to buy.
High street knitwear, from, say, The Sweater Shop, starts at #15. A
Pringle Hugo Polo Shirt costs #79.99; a Ballogie Polo Shirt #54.99; a
Kilmartin T-Shirt #29.99; an Alva Polo Shirt #54.99; and a Barra
Cardigan #110.
Pringle products, like company carriage clocks, are a sign of coming
of middle-age, geologically and economically. It is both right and
proper that any Pringle ensemble be spiritually entwined with golf.
Pringle is the zeitgeist of probably the most boring, most futile of
global sports. Three hours of Barbapapa sandpits, and a demand for the
repeated, clinical annihilation of wild and passionate landscape;
self-serving environmental vandalism itself, as is the need to wear
Pringle.

NEW working practices adopted by staff at a Glasgow maintenance depot
for trains are beginning to pay off.
Polmadie is beating off rivals for contracts -- with the latest a
refurbishment of fourteen 30-year-old carriages used by InterCity Cross
Country. Next week, the depot will take over the servicing contract for
ScotRail's sleepers.
Because of improved productivity, it expects to win a lot more work
from train operating units under the break-up of British Rail.
Polmadie, which is part of InterCity West Coast, is now using the same
principles as a private company in a bid to secure orders.
Depot manager Mr Ken Rigby volunteered in 1993 to follow a business
and resources system produced by consultants for InterCity West Coast.
There was initial staff resistance -- mainly from management rather
than shop-floor workers, but 18 months later the guinea-pigs are winning
work from rival depots.
The latest contract coincides with InterCity West Coast's confirmation
of plans to close a similar depot in Wembley, London, next month. The
closure comes as a surprise, because some facilities at Wembley, where
250 jobs are threatened, are less than 10 years old.
It is officially being blamed on a downturn in maintenance work
because of the impending withdrawal of Motorail services from Scotland,
plus InterCity's transfer of sleeper services to ScotRail. However, it
is clear that Polmadie's efficiency drive has played a part in Wembley's
woes.
Mr Rigby, who likens Polmadie's new working practices to putting
desk-bound bobbies back on the beat, conceded: ''If someone else had
volunteered to try the business and resources planning scheme, then
contracts could just as easily have gone to them.''
The scheme includes basing supervisors and production managers on the
shop floor. Previously, they had worked in offices. There is also
greater flexibility among tradesmen within the depot, in reality a
garage for trains and carriages.
Unions, including the RMT and Aslef, have approved the changes to
working practices, although the 400 staff at Polmadie received nothing
in return for the deal -- except that their futures have never looked
brighter.
The goal is to operate as a stand-alone unit within InterCity West
Coast, in full control of budget, costs and any bids for work from other
train operators.
Polmadie's turnover is running at #11.8m, with 50% of work done for
InterCity West Coast. The new Cross Country contract could result in
further orders to refurbish the remainder of its Mark II fleet, about
200 carriages.
Income will be boosted next year regardless, because of awards for
servicing contracts for the Eurostar and Northstar trains serving
Scotland from next year.
Ironically, the 150-year-old Polmadie works is scheduled for a
compulsory purchase to make way for the proposed new M74 extension,
adding another Clyde crossing close to the Kingston Bridge.
If the motorway plan is approved, the sprawling depot will move lock,
stock and barrel to a vacant site opposite the current premises in
Polmadie Road. Strathclyde Regional Council and the Scottish Office
would be expected to pick up the bills.

I ASSISTED Locate in Scotland by making presentations to potential
inward investors on the basics of the UK tax system.
Very few inward investors are interested in income tax. They make
corporate investments and are far more concerned with the corporation
tax rate. On that score Scotland, as part of the UK, came a poor second
to Ireland which could offer a 10% corporation tax rate.
Income tax is paid by individual residents of the UK. If a US
expatriate manager comes here he will often be protected by a tax
equalisation policy which renders after-tax pay the same as if he had
never left the US.
The effect of a slightly higher tax rate is to increase the cost of
the tax equalisation policy. This will be a marginal figure for the one
or two employees involved.
The Irish do not seem to have suffered greatly with a top tax rate of
58%.
On the face of it, a 3% income tax tail seems unlikely to wag many
inward investment dogs.

Jennifer Cunningham examines whether community service is an easy
option for offenders
MANY a cynic will raise an eyebrow and wonder whether 120 extra hours
showing off his skills with a football is sufficient punishment for Eric
Cantona's attack on a supporter.
''I would look at football, but I think I would prefer to find
something more challenging if I had to find a placement for a famous
footballer,'' said Paul Morron, one of the first people in Scotland
charged with making the punishment fit the criminal rather than the
crime. Seventeen years ago he was responsible for one of the four pilot
schemes to test the idea of community service, then set up the Glasgow
scheme when it was extended to the whole of Scotland.
Offenders with special skills have put their talents to good use in
the past. One who played the accordion was sent along to a wheelchair
dancing club. They were so delighted to have a live musician and he
gained so much from their enthusiasm that he continued as a volunteer
for many years. An unemployed 19-year-old, who said he had no skills,
grudgingly admitted to bird-watching as a hobby and enjoying woodwork at
school. He ended up building hides for the RSPB.
There are few such perfect matches. Placements can be in residential
homes caring for elderly or disabled people or children or they can be
in work squads carrying out gardening or decorating work for people
physically unable to do it for themselves or who cannot afford to pay
someone to do it.
Community service orders now account for 6.2% of all sheriff court
disposals in Scotland and amount to more than 6000 a year. In the past
six years there has been a 100% increase in community service orders
from sheriff courts. According to Paul Morron, now assistant director of
social work for Strathclyde, sheriffs have increasing confidence in them
because they are well-supervised.
''If there is a failure to comply, offenders are returned to court
according to a national standard. Usually it is two chances and then
back to court and a custodial sentence, but the community service
supervisor has the discretion to return to court after one breach,'' he
said, insisting that it is the inevitability of prison which makes it
work. In Strathclyde, one in five is returned to court, a statistic
which, according to Morron, says more about the success of the
supervision than the failure of the system.
Some of the young offenders are taken aback by the closeness of that
supervision, which includes unannounced spot checks. One lad, told he
would have to carry out his order on Sundays thought he was on to a
great skive. When there was a knock on his door at 9.30 one Sunday
morning, he mumbled sleepily: ''What are you doing here? Social workers
don't work on Sundays.'' He got dressed in double quick time.
There are two questions of vital concern to the public. One is whether
you can send thieves and thugs into the homes of vulnerable people
without putting them at risk and the second is whether it stops them
re-offending. To both the answer is a qualified yes.
A six-year study of community service orders by Gill McIvor at the
Social Work Research Centre at Stirling University found that of 567
individuals who had work carried out in their homes by offenders on
CSOs, only one reported a theft. A separate incident in Fife where
someone on a CSO returned to steal from a house where he had been
working has resulted in an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Scotland)
Bill currently making its way through Parliament, which will make that
behaviour an aggravated offence carrying a higher penalty than normal.
In the Stirling survey of 136 offenders who had been given CSOs, there
was a correlation between those who had found it a rewarding experience
and those who did not reoffend.
It is also cost-effective: #17 per offender per week compared with an
average #500 in prison.

THE Dr Marten boot was invented in wartime Munich by a German doctor
called Klaus Maertens with assistance from his engineer friend, Dr
Herbert Funck. Maertens, injured in a ski-ing accident and in need of a
supportive and comfortable shoe, came up with its design; Funck
developed an air-cushioned sole from old tyres to be heat-sealed to the
shoe rather than sewn. But it was not until the two men joined forces
with British company R Griggs &amp; Co, and anglicised the name to Dr
Marten, that the boot took off. The classic eight-hole DM was the first
to roll of the production line in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, on April
1, 1960. The date was used to christen the boot. The company named it
the 1460.
The entire production of more than a million pairs a month, made in
Britain, is exported to 35 countries, and has a turnover of #100
million. To celebrate today's 35th birthday, Dr Martens has produced a
limited edition of the 1460 boot in rough, brown hide. Only 1460 pairs
are to be distributed worldwide, and they are destined to become
collectors' items.
But what do the public think of the streetwise, unisex DM?
* They've got steel toe-caps for protection and they're very light to
wear and hard-wearing. We find them a big advantage going up and down
this warehouse. We cover miles a day on our feet. They're the most
comfortable we've ever had -- David Ewing, distribution supervisor,
Scottish Brewers
* They haven't always been a fashionable item. They were heavy-duty
gear for industry, men's shoes, when they started off -- Annabel
Thomson, secretary
* They can look very attractive on the right person with the right
gear. You get grannies wearing trendy trainers, but not DMs. I have
never worn a pair, it's not that I don't like them, just that I haven't
got around to buying them. I think they'd look great with a long, black
skirt and black tights -- Susan McLeish, beauty therapist
* Dr Martens are big and clumsy, and for that reason they make women
look particularly vulnerable and waif-like. Orphan Annies. You can be as
hard as nails but when you put on a pair of DM's, you become a
cutsie-pie -- Felicity Burns-Kendal, PA
* I think they look really naff. Very conventional. I can understand
they'd be okay for working in if you're on your feet all day, some of my
collegues wear them, but they're not flattering. I wouldn't wear them
out -- Ian Price, hairdresser

A DARTS player dismissed for playing in world tournaments while he was
on paid sick leave is fighting the decision.
Mr Jamie Harvey, 39, of Netherton Drive, Barrhead, who told a Glasgow
industrial tribunal yesterday that he was ranked seventh in the world,
claimed his sacking by ScottishPower was too severe.
The tribunal heard he was dismissed after his employers saw a local
newspaper article about his playing in a darts tournament while he was
off with a bad back from his job as a joiner's mate, which involved
heavy manual work.
While on sick leave, he had taken part in a tournament in Blackpool
and another two events in Canada and Las Vegas. He did not win any of
them.
He was sacked for abuse of the company sick leave scheme.
His chief, Mr Charles Alexander said: ''The playing of darts and
extensive travel associated with that were prejudical to him returning
to work.''
The tribunal heard he had been absent for 138 days suffering from a
bad back and was on half pay by the time he was dismissed.
Mr Harvey said the punishment was too severe when his 17-year service
record was taken into account.
The tribunal heard ScottishPower had accommodated him in the past:
giving him unpaid leave when he used up all his other entitlement to
attend darts matches, and providing him with T-shirts with the
ScottishPower logo.
However, he had not sought permission to participate in the events
when he was on sick leave.
Mr Harvey told the tribunal he received no payment to take part in the
tournaments and it had cost him several thousand pounds in travel and
other expenses. ''At the time I didn't think I had to notify the
company. I thought they knew as I had been in the same events the
year,'' he said.
Mr Harvey said he accepted with hindsight that he should have
contacted the company.
The tribunal will issue its decision later.

While the BBC finds itself under attack, right and left, over
political bias, Margaret Vaughan examines new figures produced by a
viewer survey which will add fuel to the row
VIEWERS do believe there is political bias at the BBC. The evidence is
clear. The problem for senior Conservatives currently slanging
broadcasters for supposed leftist leanings is that viewers believe the
bias is of the opposite slant.
Further fuel for the row will come later this month when the results
of a survey on public perceptions of broadcasting bias will disclose
that three times as many people (22%) perceive a pro-Tory bias as a
pro-Labour (6%) bias on BBC1.
The findings are made in the annual survey on public perceptions of
broadcasting bias, to be published by the Independent Television
Commission. They are no big surprise. They are in line with the results
of audience research conducted every year.
The figures since 1975 have shown that of those who see any political
bias in television coverage, substantially more people believe the BBC
is biased in favour of the Conservatives than believe it favours Labour
or the Liberal Democrats.
Labour waded into the bias row this week with accusations that the BBC
has caved in to the pressure of a concerted campaign by Ministers to
allow John Major two high-profile BBC interviews, including a solo spot
on Panorama and an appearance yesterday on Good Morning With Anne and
Nick.
The conclusions drawn from the surveys might also be taken as evidence
that the attack on the BBC was phoney political outrage designed to
divert attention from the Government's own performance.
For the viewer, it seems not to matter much how many ladlesful of
cultivated political apoplexy -- from whichever direction -- are thrown
into the election soup.
From the results found in the annual Television -- the Public's View,
the belief that the BBC is more partial to the Conservative Party is
consistent. Even the infamous Norman Tebbitt blitz on the BBC in 1986
did not shake the conviction. That year, 18% of viewers clung to the
belief that BBC1 was biased towards the Tories while only 5% shared
Tebbit's view that it was partial to Labour.
The viewers' perceptions seem paradoxical, given that throughout its
history the BBC has been accused by the right of leaning to the left.
The numbers seeing pro Tory bias grew during the Thatcher years,
peaking at 27% in 1989. But the same pro-Tory pattern is consistently
found in the surveys since they were started by the old Independent
Broadcasting Authority in 1975, when Labour was in power.
Thus, one suggestion that the public believes that the BBC is biased
in favour of the Government of the day does not explain the findings.
In 1977, two years before the Conservatives came to power, three times
as many viewers (13%) thought BBC was partial to the Tories as to Labour
(4%).
The surveys show far fewer people perceive political bias on ITV. Last
year's figures show equal numbers (7%) perceiving bias towards both
parties. On Channel 4, the figures are even lower: with 3% seeing a
pro-Tory bias, against 5% for Labour. By comparison, 23% saw a pro-Tory
bias on BBC1 against 5% for Labour. On BBC2 the figures were 14%
pro-Tory, and 3% pro-Labour.
Dr Peter Ayton, a psychologist at London's City University, who has
studied the figures, said subjective perceptions of bias did not prove
the programmes were biased: ''That's why any serious claims of political
bias must be justified by rigorous methodology.''
However, he pointed out, even perceived bias is a serious problem for
any news organisation claiming to be authoritative and impartial: ''That
this is an avoidable problem for broadcasting organisations is well
demonstrated by the fact that the surveys show far fewer people see
political bias on ITV.''
The BBC, which spent the first half of the week defending itself from
attacks by senior Conservatives, is now rejecting Labour's claims that
it is colluding in a five-day media blitz by the Prime Minister.
The Liberal Democrat campaigns co-ordinator, Nick Harvey, has
described the controversial Panorama interview with Major as completely
unacceptable and making a mockery of balanced TV coverage.
The row surfaced after publication of a leaked internal BBC memo from
Panorama's deputy editor, Nick Robinson, proposing ways in which the
programme could publicly defend the timing of the Major interview, which
is three days before the Scottish elections.
The BBC has said the memo was written the day before advance copies of
the speech which signalled the Tory attack, written by Jonathan Aitken,
began circulating at Westminster.
BBC Scotland moved to counter criticisms when it announced that all
four Scottish party leaders were invited to appear on a Scottish local
Election Special programme in advance of next Thursday.
The Scottish National Party, meanwhile, is threatening court action if
the Panorama programme is shown in Scotland. It claims to have been
duped by the BBC which invited leader Alex Salmond to make appearances
on Breakfast with Frost and Newsnight in an effort to deflect criticism
of the Panorama interview.

OVER the past couple of years the Princess of Wales has been the
victim of numerous unpleasant kiss-and-tell revelations in the press,
but there is one person close to the Princess who, you can be certain,
will never breathe a word.
Catherine Walker has a reputation for discretion. So strict is her
policy, that for many years the designer never admitted that the chic
suits and glamorous long evening dresses the Princess wears in public
had begun life on her cutting-room table. In fact, even today the
publicity-shy Catherine Walker would never release any information about
what the Princess has ordered. However, having seen many of her designs
wrongly attributed to Valentino or Yves St Laurent, she will at least
confirm whether an outfit carries The Chelsea Design Company name -- the
label which she hides behind.
The long navy silk dress with the subtle beadwork that Princess Diana
wore with the famous ''flip'' hairdo to the Fashion Awards in New York
is a Catherine Walker. So is the glamorous body-hugging dress she wore
to Versailles -- which many thought was a Herve Leger -- and some of the
suits photographed by the fervent crowds that surrounded her tour of
Japan. The Princess's choice of Catherine Walker's silk gown to present
an award to Liz Tilberis, editor of US Harper's Bazaar and former editor
of British Vogue, was a poignant touch. For it was Tilberis who
introduced the young royal to the French-born couturier soon after her
marriage.
The relationship between royal and couturier has been a long and
trusting one. Catherine (pronounced the French way, Katrine) Walker is a
loyal and sincere person, who has created a look for both the Princess
and her many other clients that would never draw attention for the wrong
reasons. Her design, especially the evening wear, has a dramatic and
devastating simplicity that suits the British taste for subtlety. She
has an extraordinary understanding of the female form and a canny knack
for elongating the waist to add height. As one observer remarks: ''Women
relate to their bodies differently; Catherine's gift is to flatter and
shape the figure, rather than fight it.''
Her innate understanding and haute couture skills have earned the
respect of high-profile clients like Lady Helen Windsor (whose wedding
dress she designed), Joely Richardson, Shakira Caine, and Queen Noor of
Jordan, who have to contend with the fact that looking good in public is
a requirement of their roles. Since she established The Chelsea Design
Company in 1977 as a therapy and means to support her and her baby
daughters on the early tragic death of her husband, Catherine Walker has
built one of the most successful design businesses in Britain. Her most
enthusiastic supporters are her Scottish and Yorkshire clientele who
regularly travel to London to be fitted with one of her exquisite
made-to-measure suits, elegant beaded evening gowns, or stunning wedding
dresses. They, like the Princess, know they are buying a way of dressing
that has presence and dignity.

<HEADLINE>Funding bid for Highland cultural centre</HEADLINE>

A NEW Scottish bid has been made to the Millennium Fund, on the eve of
the deadline for applications. The proposal, for a #20m cultural centre
near Oban, is being led by businessman Mr Sandy Orr and architect Mr
Bill Crerar, both of whom come from the West Highlands.
Their plans are for a new building or group of buildings on the
waterfront at Ganavan Bay, which will house a multi-media history of the
peoples of the Highlands and Islands. The development itself would be
the subject of an international architectural competition.
A steering group has been working privately on the idea since last
August and includes Mr Mark Jones, chief executive of the Scottish
Museums Council.
The Royal Scottish Museum has already agreed in principle to lend
material from its permanent collections.
Also on the founding committee are Mr Jimmy Gordon, chief executive of
Scottish Radio Holdings, Mr Derek Reid, chief executive of the Scottish
Tourist Board, Professor Gavin McCrone, the former chief economic
adviser to the Scottish Office and Mr David McIntyre, chief executive of
Argyll and the Islands Enterprise, who are the joint applicants.
The group sees the centre as a major educational asset, but also a
magnet for international visitors who will have their appetite for
further Highland travel whetted by the range of material available.
In addition to hi-tech indoor displays and films -- including a
multi-screen presentation of the making of the Highlands and Islands
landscape -- the plan is to house one major exhibition every year which
will originate in one of the many countries with strong Celtic
connections.
The hope is that such a year-round facility will generate at least 100
jobs directly in the area, and, as the largest ''charged for'' tourist
attraction in the Highlands, might pull in an initial 250,000 visitors
in year one. The economic forecasting and analysis of general viability
is being done for the group by KPMG Peat Marwick.
The project joins an increasingly crowded wish list from Scotland,
including the plans for regenerating the Caldedonian forest and major
applications from many cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
But Sandy Orr, who chairs the steering group, is convinced that the
Oban bid will prove attractive precisely because it aims to increase
interest in an area suffering from obvious decline and neglect.
''What we hope it would do is start to reverse the rather worrying
trend in Highland tourism, and when you consider all the elements
included in the plans I think people will find it very exciting.
''And now is the time, with the Millennium Fund available, when we can
think about a project of historic importance to the Scottish Highlands
which just wouldn't have been possible without this kind of funding
being available.''
Sandy Orr was born in Oban, as was Bill Crerar. Although both now work
mainly in Edinburgh, Crerar still lives in Oban and is a director of a
hotel chain with three outlets in the area. ''I see this as a natural
focus for regeneration in this area,'' he said yesterday. ''Not just for
tourism and visitors but to help Scots have an environmental awareness
of their own area.''

WHEN the Prime Minister flies to Washington in Concorde tomorrow there
will be a welcome lack of the turbulence that has been buffeting him and
his Government for almost all of the three years since, against
expectations, he won the 1992 General Election.
Hoping to patch up the special relationship with President Clinton, he
will doubtless, on the return trip, give some thought to his special
relationship with the parliamentary Conservative Party, the men and
women who, in the autumn of this year, will have his fate in their
hands.
He can expect a triple whammy of disasters in the Scottish local
elections next week, the English ones next month, and the Perth and
Kinross by-election, which may be put off until June.
If these duly occur and the Tories reach the autumn still trailing
20-plus points behind Labour, the party's thoughts may well turn to
dropping the pilot.
John Major has already made clear he will not go quietly, and has
embarked on a programme of high-profile speeches (one in Birmingham
today) and television appearances to try to counter the media's current
love-in with Tony Blair.
He once said: ''Politics is a roller coaster, and you can never be
over confident as to how things will turn out.'' As an illustration of
just what an up-and-down world politics is, most of us have probably
forgotten that in January 1991 he enjoyed the highest opinion poll
ratings of any Prime Minister since Sir Winston Churchill. He has since
achieved the lowest since polls began.
The longer they go on, the tougher life becomes for Governments. They
can no longer blame the Opposition for the mess they inherited and, in
politics as in other walks of life, people like a change of scene.
Also, less mentioned these days but still potent, is the fact that,
for all Tory MPs elected in 1979 and after, as for many voters, Margaret
Thatcher is the yardstick by which they measure leadership. You didn't
have to like her or agree with her to acknowledge that this was a
formidable personality.
Major, by contrast, is probably the most ''ordinary bloke'' of all
British Prime Ministers, both in his origins and general style. ''I
dislike snobbishness and people who are pretentious. I dislike
arrogance,'' he once said and his ''big idea'', which has never paid
political dividends, the Citizens' Charter programme, was aimed largely
at those in officialdom who demonstrated these characteristics.
The various charters have probably given more people a better idea of
their rights while giving those providing services standards to work to.
They may well be effective in an unobtrusive sort of way.
Unfortunately for John Major, dubbed the grey man of politics,
unobtrusive successes are no good. Ministers will happily reel off
figures of low inflation and interest rates, high growth and export
performance, steady if slowly falling unemployment, but admit that the
''feel-good factor'' remains conspicuous by its absence. Probably never
in the history of statistics has a Government which has so many of the
classic economic indicators pointing in the right direction been so
unpopular.
And on top of voter unease about job security, negative equity on
homes, the NHS revolution, privatisation's side-effects on executive
salaries and the uncertain future of railway services, the Major
Government has been hit by a stream of incidents involving Ministers
which the Opposition happily lump together under the heading ''sleaze''.
Napoleon asked of a general he was being asked to make a Marshal of
France -- ''Is he lucky?'' A good question for a politician too. Major
has been lucky, but not for some time. He was lucky in being in the
right place at the right time to reach high office as Chancellor and
Foreign Secretary earlier than might have been expected. He fitted the
bill for the party when a successor to Thatcher was wanted. Someone less
abrasive, a bruised party thought. Douglas Hurd was in the frame as
well, but the Tories decided they didn't want a toff.
Major brought more than luck to the job when he was forced to take his
party into an election in the depths of a recession. He brought
doggedness and resilience, perhaps his outstanding qualities, to the
task and has developed both, circumstances offering him plenty of
practice, in subsequent years of office.
As one would expect, his success in winning against the odds and the
pundits' forecasts had a big effect on him. In an unconceited way he
believes he can do it again.
I put this to a Tory MP who mused: ''Well, then we had a recession and
Neil Kinnock. Next time we'll have a recovery but Tony Blair.'' He
seemed to think the recovery might not compensate for Blair and, given
voters' stubborn refusal to feel good, he could well be right.
The Prime Minister's confidence that he can win again is not mere
wishful thinking. He can manage one or maybe two more Budgets in which
taxes must be cut. The search is on for legislation the voters will like
in the last full year of this Parliament. He believes that by playing it
long he will increasingly expose Labour's policy difficulties.
Even the Opposition's vast opinion poll lead offers some hope. They
privately acknowledge the lead is unrealistic. If the Tories can start
pulling it back it could be Labour's turn to get nervous and make
mistakes.
Major raised the constitutional issue in 1992 and, against expectation
again, seemed to make it work for the Tories, though to an
unquantifiable degree. Next time he will wrap himself in the flag even
more. With a Labour victory more likely, his warning that their
devolution policies could end the Union may play well enough again.
On Europe, he will make the defence of national sovereignty his theme
and paint Labour as not-so-closet federalists. Blair and Robin Cook,
scenting the danger, are trying to ensure there will not be too much
clear water between the parties when the time comes.
But the odds against him pulling off a repeat performance must be
great. The voters show every sign of being weary with the Tories and no
longer afraid of Labour who in the next election will have a leader who
is an asset not a liability.
To come back to Napoleon's question, Major's luck began to desert him
almost on the morrow of victory. He had no responsibility for the
peccadilloes of Ministers who made the news in a variety of undesirable
ways, some ridiculous rather than alarming.
On earlier occasions he certainly stuck by the culprits too long,
giving the appearance of indecisiveness when they finally went. Now
Ministers know that if embarrassment to the party looms you go, and go
quickly.
Similarly, no Tory leader could prevent his party dividing over
Europe. It is an issue of historic proportions. Convictions are deeply
felt and he has probably held them together as well as anyone could;
that is, not very well but without an irreconcilable split. His
political progress towards the next European summit is crablike,
paraphrased by one of his back benchers as ''a Euro sceptic at the heart
of Europe''.
On a more personal level, he has overcome to a degree his earlier
sensitivity to criticism which he sometimes showed publicly. He has
developed a resilience and public calm which is impressive. Even at the
height of some disaster or other he is now able to give a genuine grin
at a Commons sally, and has coached himself not to get riled except in
private.
He now expects little good from the media, except on occasions that
can, to a degree, be stage-managed. The incidence of trips down the
plane or coach to chat to correspondents has declined in ratio to
increased and, he feels, often manufactured reports of a Government
perpetually in crisis.
Even granting that some in the IRA were looking for a way out of
permanent violence, he has handled that delicate process with skill and
an impressive grasp of detail, another strength in his approach to any
problem in which he is personally involved.
These are pluses which do not entirely balance his apparent inability
to convince the voters that he is in charge. If this year's party
conference finds him weakened by more reverses his pretty dreadful
platform oratory will be a liability before a fatefully attentive
audience. In the past that audience have always given the impression of
never being quite as impressed as they wanted to be by a man most of
them regard as a nice chap.
Few Tories would ever have dreamed of considering Thatcher as the
female equivalent of a nice chap and, if they still feel themselves in
the doldrums in October they, like the MPs, may find their thoughts
turning to the need for a new man to match new Labour and their
comparatively new leader.
The Tory MPs at that conference will court the representatives even
more assiduously than usual for, as Major knowns deep down as he plans
his strategy, it is not enough for him to be confident he can repeat
1992 in 1996 or 1997 -- they have to be as well.

BRITAIN'S nuclear test veterans plan to boycott the 50th anniversary
commemorations of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-Bombs in protest at
Japan's wartime attrocities.
Mr Ken McGinley, chairman of the Johnstone-based British Nuclear Test
Veterans Association, is calling on the Japanese emperor to apologise
for the brutalities inflicted on British service personnel.
He is also demanding that the emperor give a token #10m compensation
to families of the victims.
He said that, although there is much sympathy and pity for ''the
inncocent lives lost in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki'', it is
allied prisoners of war who should be commemorated.
Mr McGinley, whose group represents 3500 of the estimated 22,000
victims of Britain's 1950s A-Bomb tests, is protesting at plans by the
Nuclear Free Local Authorities to host public receptions for bomb
survivors visiting from Japan.
The visits are part of a tour organised by CND.
Japanese attrocities included beatings, roasting of prisoners in
corrugated iron ovens, the use of allied servicemen and civilians for
bayonet practice, the forced filling of prisoners' stomachs with water
followed by pressurised bursting, and mass starvation.
A spokesman for CND said the organisation regretted the stance taken
by Mr McGinley on behalf of his members, but preferred not to comment
further.

Concerted resistance failed to maintain the status quo in Ayrshire's
boundaries. DAVID STEELE looks at what the intriguing outcome might be
THE failure of a vigorous campaign to give Ayrshire back its identity
under local government reorganisation has led to a division into three
parts of the ''county'', and has thrown up a number of intriguing
contests.
Pressure on the Government had come from a variety of directions to
revert to the pre-1974 boundaries and allow one authority to look after
the interests of Ayrshire.
Yet there was movement on just one aspect -- Cunninghame district
remained largely the same to form the new North Ayrshire Council. To the
south the boundaries are along the lines of the current ones which form
the area of Kyle and Carrick District Council.
As in other parts of Scotland there were those who cried foul when the
decision on the South Ayrshire boundaries was announced, because Kyle
and Carrick is one of a handful of Scottish councils run by the
Conservatives.
Whatever the reasons, Ayrshire will be split into three -- North,
South, and East Ayrshire, which will be made up of the areas currently
served by Kilmarnock and Loudoun District Council and Cumnock and Doon
Valley District Council.
It is here that perhaps the most intriguing of the contests will take
place, because the Kilmarnock-based authority, which is a delicate
balance of Labour and Scottish National Party councillors, meets the
council from the former mining community which is solid Labour.
In all, there will be 30 wards in the East Ayrshire Council (one third
of them from Cumnock and Doon Valley) and it is there that the SNP must
make their gains if they are to gain control.
The bickering has begun already, with the Nationalists claiming that
they can sweep aside tired Labour representatives who have had it their
own way for too long. One Labour activist at the centre of things
retorted: ''We are all wondering when the SNP campaign is going to
start.''
What is for sure is that whoever wins control will have to do it by
convincing the electorate that they will continue to fight for an
improvement to the chronic unemployment problems of an area devastated
by the demise of deep mining.
The winning of coal by opencast methods, with its relatively low
employment levels and attendant environmental problems, has been of
little help and in the area the jobless figures are more than 17%.
Provost Daniel Coffey of Kilmarnock and Loudoun said: ''I believe if
we had stayed on the old boundaries we would have won power, but the new
set-up makes the challenge greater. The SNP enjoy a challenge and we are
getting a good response from people who want a change in their area. We
believe we can provide that.''
David Sneller, Cumnock and Doon Valley's leader, responded: ''The SNP
tries to be all things to all men and adopts Labour policies in Labour
areas and Tory policies in Tory areas. I am confident we can hold on to
the existing power base and add greatly to that across in the Kilmarnock
area.''
The Conservatives have 23 candidates in a mixture of town and rural
seats and feel they can make inroads into the traditional Labour
support.
To the north, the battle centres on towns such as Irvine and
Ardrossan, and again Labour is showing confidence that it can increase
its hold on the authority by sweeping aside the Conservatives from their
traditional strongholds.
One Labour party worker said that voters had been showing an interest
not only in local issues but also in the national trend against the
Government. ''We are getting the message across that we have the answers
at both local and national level,'' she said. The Tories around Largs
and Fairlie might have other ideas.
The Labour campaign was dealt a blow by the death of council leader
Teresa Beattie, who had fought so hard for Cunninghame's
''independence''. The voters in the Stevenston North ward which she
hoped to contest will have to wait several weeks before making their
crosses for the shadow authority.
In the 25 wards of South Ayrshire many observers are identifying the
fight as a straight one between Labour and the Conservatives who
currently run the council.
There are two schools of thought on the Tory record in Kyle and
Carrick over the past three years -- one that it has been a businesslike
and successful administration which has done much good for the voters;
the other that it has been operating as testbed for unpopular national
policies on privatisation and co-operation between the public and
private sectors.
The voters will be making a statement on Thursday on which school of
thought they favour, and if this election can be viewed as an indicator
of how the votes would be cast in a General Election then Ayr MP Phil
Gallie will be viewing the result with more than a passing interest.
The Conservative cause has not been helped by the loss of Murray Tosh,
a leading strategist and deputy leader whose teaching post could have
been under threat if he took office in the authority which would
ultimately employ him, and the decision by Councillors Liz Mitchell and
Kirsty Young to resign the Tory whip and stand as Independents.
Both have been critical of the way the administration has conducted
itself on a number of issues. Each has a strong personal following, and
even if they are not returned they will upset the Conservative
apple-cart in a big way.
Despite changes over 20 years in local authority boundaries, Ayrshire
still has a strong identity and it could be argued that if the voters
swing to Labour in the way many are predicting then it will be Labour
which will control all three unitary authorities, with the possibilities
of close co-opertation among all of them and their neighbours to the
north and west.
The Government might have killed off Strathclyde but created something
rather different but largely the same.

KEN SMITH reveals a vitally important health
watchdog at risk in the council shake-up
IT was once a school science block. After a #5m overhaul it became one
of the most sophisticated laboratories in Scotland, and the largest of
its kind in Europe. It is where every day 120 skilled staff test to
ensure the public's water supply is not contaminated, food is safe to
eat, how much contamination there is in the land, and whether
radioactivity can be detected.
Even toys are tested to ensure they don't contain anything which could
poison or maim children. And there is the growing problem of malicious
contamination of food which occurs more often than the public realises.
Yet with the council shake-up, its future is at risk.
The laboratory sits 50 yards within the Glasgow boundary at Colston,
near Bishopbriggs, and is the home of Strathclyde's regional chemist, Dr
Peter Smith, and his staff.
The fact that the public is largely unaware it is there is down to the
quiet, methodical way the chemists and researchers go about their work.
Yet it would be difficult to find such a concentration of specialist
staff anywhere else in the country with a back-up of instrumentation
which includes some of the most accurate and sensitive measuring devices
in the world.
Nor are all the staff stuck in laboratories. A specialist equipment
vehicle is on call 24-hours to help the fire brigade deal with any
chemical incident.
The staff involved are even trained in using breathing apparatus so
that they can work alongside firefighters. It is impossible to imagine
any of the new, smaller authorities providing such a high level of
service.
There is also a slight mathematical problem which the Secretary of
State has appeared to have overlooked.
The legislation states that each of the 32 authorities in Scotland
after reorganisation have to appoint a Public Analyst. But there are
only 11, soon to be 10 when one retires, in Scotland. And no, you need
not apply. It takes more years to become a qualified Public Analyst than
it does a doctor.
So what will the new councils do? Well, the legislation does not
actually state that they have to do all that much more than simply
appoint a Public Analyst. The cheapest option may therefore be to
appoint one in England, and then post down the barest minimum of samples
to check.
It doesn't break the law, but the public could suffer from having a
poorer service.
Dr Smith explained: ''It would be possible to comply with the law by
going down that line, but it would mean that most of the checking going
on would be at a much lower level. Problems wouldn't be picked up as
early as they are now.''
The Colston laboratory checks four food samples and four others, such
as investigating air pollution for every thousand people in Strathclyde.
It is a vast number of samples -- far higher than is accomplished
anywhere else in Britain.
It allows the region to register problems very early, rather than
simply wait and react to an outbreak of food poisoning, which is more
likely to happen if the new councils rely on sending fewer samples to
England.
The spread of information from throughout the West of Scotland coming
to the one laboratory is also important. Dr Smith gave the example of
anti-nuclear campaigners who claimed that iodine detected in seaweed
near the Faslane nuclear submarine base indicated there had been a
radioactive leak from a submarine.
The region's scientists went into action, and collated iodine readings
from the entire Clyde coast.
Dr Smith said: ''On the face of it, it could have been very serious.
Iodine would have suggested a leakage from the nuclear reactor in the
submarine itself. However, analysing seaweed along the entire coast
showed the concentrations growing away from the submarine base, which is
not what you would have expected if there was a problem with one of the
submarines.
''Eventually we were able to trace it to waste from a hospital. It
appears they were using massive amounts on patients which were going in
one end and out the other. There was no health risk, but it was only by
having such an experienced team here that the problem was solved.''
So far, staff morale at the lab is holding up, even though they face
an uncertain future. The first problem is hiving off the water supply to
a quango. About a third of the staff at Colston are involved in testing
water supplies. If the new quango takes the testing elsewhere, then the
laboratory staffing would be down to 80. There are certain fixed costs
in running a laboratory of that sophisticated a level -- reduce the
staff too much and it becomes too expensive.
Will the new Glasgow council be willing to take it on, with the
assumption that it will be able to sell services to the other
authorities in Scotland?
No-one knows. And with the new councils having to sort out the more
pressing problems of the large departments, support services such as the
laboratory may slip down the list.
It is impossible, of course, to cut up a laboratory into 12. But if
its future is not resolved soon, then one of the best facilities in the
country, could be lost, without the public even being aware of what it
had in the first place.

Calum Macdonald reports on the manoeuvrings to capture a seat which
melds two finely-balanced political territories
THE battle for control of East Dunbartonshire is shaping up as one of
the most closely contested in the country.
The merger of the suburban districts of Strathkelvin, and Bearsden and
Milngavie, leaves three of the main parties with a realistic prospect of
power in the new authority.
But, while Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats all
harbour hopes of gaining an outright majority in the 26-seat authority,
the most probable outcome is a hung council, in which case the real
political action will begin after polling closes on Thursday.
At present, Labour holds sway comfortably in Strathkelvin, with nine
members to six Tories. Further west, the Tories and Liberal Democrats
have five councillors each, but work together in a spirit of apolitical
harmony.
Predictions of the outcome in East Dunbartonshire are confused by the
new boundary divisions in Strathkelvin. Three southern seats have been
hived off to North Lanarkshire, and the remaining 12 split into 16
smaller wards.
Labour has controlled Strathkelvin since 1980, and group leader
Charles Kennedy believes the party can now extend its fiefdom.
To be assured of the administration, Labour needs to regain its nine
seats, add four more -- mostly in Bishopbriggs -- and win back its only
Bearsden and Milngavie seat, Craigdhu.
In 1992, it was taken by Councillor Des McGarry. He died last year and
the Liberal Democrats won the by-election. Mr McGarry's widow,
Josephine, will try to emulate her late husband's achievement.
Mr Kennedy is critical of the Government's reorganisation, suggesting
the resulting authority does not cover ''a natural district''. But he
believes the two areas have a lot in common, and Labour's manifesto
features two issues of strong mutual interest: education, and defence of
the green belt.
He ventures on to more contentious ground when he talks of council
finance, and the need to ensure value-for-money. Strathkelvin now has
the most expensive council tax in Strathclyde: #778 at Band D, while
Bearsden and Milngavie is near the bottom of the regional league, at
#668.
Mr Kennedy insists this year's 12% bills rise is the fault of cuts in
central Government grant, and says the district council has cut its
budget by 2.5%. However, the increase has been eagerly seized upon by
Tory election campaign leaders, who claim it is evidence of profligacy
in a Labour-run authority.
Mr David Sharpe, chairman of the Strathkelvin and Bearsden
Conservative Association, confirms that the variation in levels of
council tax is ''the key thing'' in the Tory message to voters. A strong
secondary theme is the benefit from council reform: ''local decisions
for local matters . . . and no more meddling from Strathclyde region''.
The Tories, perhaps aware East Dunbartonshire is one of only a few
Scottish areas where they have any chance of power, are campaigning
hard. They need to reclaim 11 seats they hold on current councils, and
take three more, with Bearsden and Milngavie offering the most fertile
territory.
Mr Sharpe claims the campaign is a two-way battle between the Tories
and Labour, and is trying to squeeze the Liberal Democrat vote in
Bearsden and Milngavie.
However, Liberal Democrat spokesman Robin McSkimming, whose victory in
the 1992 district vote helped propel him into the regional Bearsden seat
last year, says the Tories are vulnerable at both ends of the new
authority, and the outcome will depend on how far the Tory vote
crumbles.
Mr McSkimming's contention is supported by last year's by-election
success for the Liberal Democrats, when the Tory candidate sank from
second to last place, recording 93 votes.
Taking overall control of East Dunbartonshire would, however, require
a Herculean effort by his party, which has only ever had one member in
Strathkelvin district.
An even greater task is facing the SNP, which ruled Strathkelvin as a
minority administration from 1977-80, but suffered a wipe-out from which
it has struggled to recover.
The SNP is the only party fielding a full slate of candidates, but
former council leader Mr Bob Cunning is honest enough to admit all they
can really hope for is a handful of seats in Bishopbriggs.
Unless the SNP mount a comeback, the Liberal Democrats could hold the
key. Would they work with Labour, in line with national allegiances, or
resume their local relationship with the Tories? For now, no-one is
saying.

MORE than 70 MPs have backed four motions in the House of Commons
demanding public inquiries into official secrets uncovered by recent
Herald investigations.
Last night 36 MPs had signed an Early Day Motion, tabled by Labour MP
Mr Alan Simpson, praising The Herald for revealing the extent of the
Government cover-up of the dangers of Britain's atomic bomb tests in the
1950s.
On Monday March 20 we revealed a file of secret documents which showed
that the Government had suppressed vital information and knowingly
falsified information given to the Australian government, in whose
country some of the tests took place.
The motion, whose signatories include SNP parliamentary leader Mrs
Margaret Ewing and Labour anti-nuclear campaigner Mr Llew Smith, calls
for a public inquiry to be established ''to investigate the full
facts''.
A second motion, also tabled by Mr Simpson and seconded by Mrs Alice
Mahon MP, expresses alarm at the safety of maritime dumps of wartime
chemical weapons off the Scottish coast. The details of these dumps were
revealed in The Herald on Tuesday March 21.
Twenty-three MPs had signed the motion by last night, calling on the
Government to conduct a full inquiry into the scale of damage which
could be inflicted by what they claim is ''an environmental time-bomb''.
These motions were tabled at the same time as 13 MPs demanded a public
inquiry into the mysterious death of the Scottish Nationalist, Mr Willie
McRae, in 1985.
Their concern was aroused by the series of revelations in The Herald
this week which have questioned official accounts of how the Glasgow
lawyer allegedly shot himself.
Friends of Mr McRae have frequently speculated in the 10 years since
his death that he had been under surveillance by Special Branch
officers, and some believe he was murdered.
On Tuesday, Glasgow Labour MP Mr George Galloway tabled one EDM,
expressing disquiet over the new evidence and calling on the Lord
Advocate to instruct the procurator-fiscal to conduct a full inquiry. He
was backed by nine other MPs.
On Wednesday the SNP parliamentary group of three MPs signed a similar
motion, requesting that the Lord Advocate reconsider the previous
decision not to order a public inquiry.
Early Day Motions are usually not debated in the House, but give MPs
an opportunity to express their views on current issues.

THE evacuation of 4000 people from a seaside resort town began
yesterday following the discovery of an unexploded half-ton German bomb
from the Second World War.
Social services staff helped 36 elderly and disabled leave the
Portland in Dorset, which is on an island connected to the mainland by a
causeway, ahead of today's Army operation to defuse the device.
Around 100 police have been drafted in to prevent looting during the
biggest evacuation in the area since the war.
At 7am this morning a dozen buses were to tour the streets within a
2000-metre diameter exclusion zone, ferrying people to alternative
accommodation.
Most residents were making their own way off Portland before today's
11am deadline signals the start of the Royal Engineers' operation.
A 24-hour guard has been placed on the bomb, unearthed under an old
football field during quarrying work.
The bomb is thought to have been dropped during a raid in July 1941.
It will be the first to be defused by Royal Engineers Captain Mike Lobb.
He said: ''If I discover the bomb is ticking, I will have a maximum of
two-and-a-half minutes to make my exit.
''So I will be running faster than Linford Christie if it is.''
Major Nick Clark, in charge of the operation, said the device could be
more volatile now than it was when it left the factory.
''If it explodes, shrapnel could fly up to 1000 metres from the device
and the blast waves would break windows, causing flying glass. For this
reason it is necessary to evacuate the entire area.''
Superintendent Brian Thornley, of Weymouth police, said: ''Anybody who
refuses to leave the island will be arrested.''
But at least two people yesterday maintained they would not leave
their homes in the zone.
Local historian Edward Andrews, 71, and Merchant Navy deck officer
Robert Hall, 38, said they were staying put.

ROLLS-Royce workers fighting to save their jobs have been asked to
invest in the company.
The management invited existing shareholders, including hundreds
facing redundancy, to take part in a one-for-five share offer as a cash
raising operation to help fund a takeover deal by Rolls-Royce in
America.
At the design and development unit at East Kilbride 600 workers are
facing unemployment. They have set up a redundancy battle HQ, where one
worker said: ''How can a company be so ridiculous?
''In one hand we have a letter saying we are no longer wanted despite
world-wide recognition of our expertise. In the other an offer asking to
put what will be our redundancy money into a company that has kicked us
out the door.''
Rolls-Royce wants extra money to help finance a multi-million takeover
deal of an American firm, Allison Engine Company.
At the Lanarkshire plant, Mr Owen Thomas, a spokesman for the shop
stewards, said: 'From where I am sitting the waste paper baskets look
pretty full. My colleagues have reacted to this pathetic offer by
throwing the letters in the bins.''
He said there was a strong suspicion the firm wanted to be seen
passing the unit's work on to America, which ''would grease wheels for
the company among those in America who are not happy at RR being allowed
to take over Allison's.''
Employees at the unit will have completed ballot papers for possible
strike action by April 10.
A spokesman for the company in Derby said: 'We are not trying to be
inflammatory in Scotland by making this share offer to employees who are
to be made redundant. We have a legal obligation to make the offer
available to every shareholder irrespective if they have one or a
million shares.''
The shares will cost 154p each.

AN INTERNAL inquiry into controversial privatisation plans by a
Labour-controlled council is unlikely, Scottish Labour Party
headquarters said yesterday.
General Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, Jack McConnell, said
he would be encouraging full consultation between the Central Regional
Council and the new unitary authorities over the region's proposals to
sell off a 50% share in four publicly-owned business parks.
Asked whether the proposal would be subjected to a party inquiry, Mr
McConnell replied: ''I wouldn't have thought so.''
The region wants to set up a joint venture company to own and operate
the parks, probably with developers John Laing, but the move is bitterly
opposed by the Labour administrations of both Falkirk and Clackmannan
District Councils.
Falkirk District Council is pressing ahead with legal action to halt
the move.
Depute director of law and administration, Mary Pitcaithly, said a
petition was lodged in the Court of Session yesterday seeking a judicial
review.
The case will heard on Tuesday.

BANGKOK, Friday
THAILAND'S most famous monk was defrocked yesterday after a Buddhist
court found he had used credit cards to visit brothels in Australia and
New Zealand.
But the handsome Phra Yantra Amaro, 44, who also has thousands of
followers in Britain and across Europe refused to wear civvies --
instead appearing in a set of green robes rather than Buddhist saffron.
Giving his last sermon to thousands of crying followers in Bangkok
Yantra said: ''Everything will be the same, I will change only the
colour of my clothes. Otherwise there will be bloodshed.''
Earlier this week fans of the monk clashed with anti-Yantra
demonstrators outside a temple in Bangkok. A woman riding on the back of
a motor cycle was killed when the violence spilled onto the streets.
The monk has also been accused of a number of other sexual misdeeds.
Last year an accusation that he fathered a child while on a Buddhist
preaching tour in the former Yugoslavia opened the floodgates from
scores of irate female followers who thought they had been the only
ones.
An American Buddhist nun claimed she made love with the monk on the
deck of a Scandinavian ferry; a Danish harpist said they made heavenly
music while he was on tour in Copenhagen and another follower said they
had sex in the back of a van in the Austrian tyrol.
The final nail in the coffin came when a wealthy Thai follower, who
had given him a gold American Express card for his foreign tours found
it had been used at venues such as Diamond Fantasy in Auckland, New
Zealand and Club 25 in Melbourne, Australia.
After checks were made the venues were found to be brothels.
At a hearing on Tuesday, the Sangha Supreme Council -- Thailand's
ruling Buddhist body ordered the monk to disrobe within three days,
indicating that if he did not police would do it for him.
Yesterday, as he emerged in his new green robe Yantra said: ''The robe
is just the outside . Inside I will still be pure. I chose the colour
because I look like a soldier, but a soldier for Buddha, not for
fighting.''

Washington, Friday
THIS is a great day for President Clinton. He is inspecting his troops
in Haiti and formally handing over control of the operation to the UN,
and claiming a great success for his policy.
The trouble is that he gets no credit for it, and a large majority of
Americans see no reason why there are any American troops in Haiti. The
latest poll shows about 60% oppose the US intervention while only 40%
support it.
Mr Clinton insists that Operation Uphold Democracy was necessary and
justified. It has cost one American soldier's life and restored
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, removing the military junta.
Today's celebrations have been tarnished by the murder on Tuesday of a
prominent member of the opposition, who was killed despite vigorous
American efforts to protect her. American authorities heard reports last
week that Mireille Durocher Bertin, a lawyer who was a strong supporter
of the military leader, General Raoul Cedras, was in danger. They
alerted M. Aristide. He offered to send police to protect her, but she
declined.
The Americans thought the Government's reaction to the warnings was
insufficient -- and their fears proved justified when she was shot on a
main street in Port-au-Prince. They suspect that M Aristide's Minister
of the Interior, General Mondesir Beaubrun may have been involved.
President Clinton commented on the affair yesterday, saying that M.
Aristide had done his best to protect Mlle Bertin. Critics and
pessimists fear that when the Americans have handed over to the UN, and
later, when the new police force finally takes over, Haiti will be as
lawless and as hopeless as ever.

Moscow, Friday
RUSSIAN troops today captured Shali, the last major rebel stronghold
in Chechnya, in a turning-point which brought immediate relief at the
Kremlin.
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets said that active military
operations in separatist Chechnya would cease following the capture of
Shali, southeast of the shattered capital Grozny, Itar-Tass news agency
said.
It quoted Soskovets, in charge of a government commission dealing with
the rebel area, as saying in Moscow that ''active combat actions'' would
stop in Chechnya following the victory.
''The remaining points pose no serious obstacles and problems for the
Russian troops,'' a defence ministry spokesman said.
The seizure of Shali, following that of Argun last week and Gudermes
yesterday, gives Russian forces control of the east of Chechnya and
about two-thirds of its whole territory.
The separatist forces of Dzhokhar Dudayev now appear to have no
alternative but to set up operations in the mountains and carry on what
may become a low-scale partisan war, very much out of public sight.
The conflict, in which thousands of people have been killed and tens
of thousands of civilians displaced, is unlikely to come to a quick end.
''We should not simplify the situation. The capture of Shali will not
lead directly to the end of the Chechen war,'' Alexei Morgun, deputy
head of the State Press Committee, said. ''Dudayev's units are still
strong.''
But the fall of Shali comes at a propitious moment politically for
President Boris Yeltsin.
It means that large-scale fighting is nearly sure to be over by May
when U.S. President Bill Clinton and other world leaders come to Russia
to pay tribute to its role in crushing Nazi Germany in World War Two.
Clinton had been under strong pressure at home not to come to Russia
because of its military incursion in Chechnya.
''The seizure of Shali means masses of positive things for President
Boris Yeltsin,'' Dmitry Volkov, deputy editor of Sevodnya broadsheet,
said.
''The West has not strongly protested earlier. Now it will have even
less ground to do so,'' Volkov said.
Shali used to be Dudayev's military capital and the base for his main
force -- a tank regiment.
On the home front, there are other economic and political gains for
Yeltsin.
Moscow now controls a key railroad leading from Russia proper to
Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea and is in a position to try and revive the
crucial oil processing industry of Chechnya.
Politically, the 64-year-old Kremlin leader, now on holiday in the
North Caucasus resort of Kislovodsk, is likely to present himself as a
strong leader who has not hesitated to use all means to preserve
Russia's integrity.
Russia sent thousands of troops backed by tanks and aircraft to end
Chechnya's independence bid on December 11, but has been unable to quell
dogged resistance by local fighters.
Losses on both sides are heavy. Grozny itself was devastated in weeks
of Russian bombardment and street fighting.
Colonel-General Anatoly Kulikov, who heads the joint operation
involving army and Interior Ministry troops, told Tass yesterday that
1426 federal soldiers had been killed in less than four months.
The figure compares to 13,000 servicemen killed during a ten-year
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Russia's Human Rights Commission has said as many as 24,000 civilians
were killed in Grozny alone. No reliable figure for the number of
Chechen fighters killed has been issued.--Reuter.

Prague, Friday
TORTURE has been rife during Russia's three-month war in Chechnya and
the danger of fighting spilling over to nearby regions has increased,
according to a report submitted to the OSCE.
The report to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe
chronicled claims of beatings and rapes by Russian soldiers and of the
torture of captured Russians by Chechens.
Ambassador Istvan Gyarmati of Hungary delivered it to a closed session
of the 53-nation OSCE's Senior Council in Prague after he and five other
OSCE diplomats spent a week in the region, returning last Monday.
The mission interviewed numerous Russian and Chechen officials as well
as people in the Chechen capital Grozny and refugees in Nazran, capital
of nearby Ingushetia.
It quoted Russian human rights commissioner Sergei Kovalyov as saying
all sides continued to commit violations.
''He cited instances of beating, harassment and humiliation of Chechen
detainees by Russian guards, as well as reports that Russian prisoners
in Chechen hands had been tortured and, in one case, that a wounded
Russian officer had been suffocated to death,'' the report said.
In Grozny, the diplomats spoke to residents who said drunk or
ill-disciplined soldiers ''continue to beat, rape and, in some cases,
kill civilians.''
The Russian commander in Grozny, Ivan Garin, told the mission that
such actions were strictly forbidden. ''But city residents, while
confirming some improvement, still contradicted his claims in his
presence,'' the report said.
The report concluded that the danger of the conflict spreading to
Ingushetia and Dagestan had increased.
''It is even more worrying to hear that some commanders of the federal
troops suggest that without 'cleaning up' Ingushetia and Dagestan from
the warriors of (Chechen leader Dzhokhar) Dudayev, the military
objectives of this campaign can not be achieved,'' it said.
Gyarmati said current humanitarian aid in the region was insufficient,
although non-government agencies were getting established.
He told a news conference that the OSCE hoped to have a six- member
long-term mission on the ground in Grozny by mid-April to help the
delivery of humanitarian aid, monitor human rights and aid negotiations
on a ceasefire.
Diplomatic sources said the Russian delegation at the OSCE meeting
dismissed a proposal for an immediate ceasefire but was assisting the
setup of the long-term OSCE mission in Grozny.--Reuter

WHEN a hard transport strike hits Paris the bustle of the city is
transformed. The streets are either unnaturally calm or packed at rush
hour with marching computers. Metro and train stations are one dense
crowd. Thursday, which saw one of the biggest strikes since the 1980s,
when struggling Parisians were driven to work by the army, was like
that. Fortunately, it did not rain as well.
In the midst of a presidential election campaign which monopolises
every radio and television news bulletin on the hour, every hour, the
strike came as a sharp reminder that French unions, especially the
communist-run CGT, can still make themselves felt. It also occurred at a
point in the campaign when the communist, socialist and even Trotskyist
candidates were beginning, at last, to assert themselves. It made one of
the dominant Gaullist arguments in the campaign, that right and
left-wing distinctions are no longer relevant today, seem hollow and
glib.
Fears about the effects of European standardisation on France's huge
and debt-ridden public sector, just as much as pay claims, were behind
the strike. Workers and unions are concerned that profitable parts of
their services could be sold off to private business.
French railways, meanwhile, are #20 billion in debt and last year lost
nearly #1 billion. RATP, the Paris transport board, is heading for debts
of over #3 billion in 1995.
All the presidential candidates, barring the extreme right wing
Philippe de Villiers, who called for public sector strikes to made
illegal, diplomatically expressed great understanding for the strikers.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur stressed his attachment to maintaining
''public services of quality''.
Alain Juppe, Foreign Minister and spokesman for the Gaullist candidate
Jacques Chirac, said that talks with public sector workers would have to
be held after the election. Louis Viannet, general secretary of the CGT,
meanwhile, cocked a snook at the Socialists by saying the strike
reflected ''the profound disappointment felt by the working class after
the elections of 1981 and 1988''.
The man for whom Mr Viannet will presumably vote, the round-faced,
bearded Robert Hue, recently appointed first secretary of the Communist
Party, has been leading a vigorous campaign and now has a realistic hope
of scoring 10% -- as compared with the 6.76% polled by his predecessor
in 1988.
For the first time in years the CP has started renting meeting halls
it is easy to fill. Communist mayors have renewed the tradition of
posing for photographs alongside the first secretary. Mr Hue has at last
thrown off the ancient pro-Moscow lines of the party, admitting Eastern
Bloc countries were imperfect and condemning the Soviet unvasion of
Afghanistan.
On the home front, he warned yesterday that Thursday's strike had not
been just electoral opportunism on the part of the unions and that
industrial action could continue after the elections. Even the
brother-in-law of President Mitterrand, actor Roger Hanin, star of a
popular cops and robbers film, said Mr Hue was ''the only genuine
left-wing vote''.
Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, meanwhile, is still steady in the
polls with around 20% and has a good chance of getting through to the
second round of voting in May. He has also adopted a new radical tone,
anxious to prove himself a genuine left winger by comparison with Mr
Chirac, who is fishing for votes across the board by proclaiming that
the distinction between left and right is obsolete, and to a lesser
extent with Mr Balladur, who is desperately trying to drum up some
working-class votes.

Ngozi, Friday
TANZANIA today closed its border to tens of thousands of Rwandan
refugees fleeing camps in northern Burundi out of fear of renewed ethnic
violence.
A spokeswoman for the medical aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres said
the border was closed at about 12.30pm and aid workers were urging the
Rwandan refugees to stay in their camps in Burundi.
Before the closure, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said
about 3200 Rwandan refugees from northern Burundi had already arrived in
Tanzania and 45,000 were on the move.
Aid workers expected up to 100,000 to join Central Africa's latest
exodus.
France said a peace accord it brokered between rival factions in
Burundi had brought temporary calm but urged the world community to send
food aid quickly and disarm militias.
''The situation is extremely fragile, but we've taken a step towards
peace,'' Cooperation Minister Bernard Debre said after three days of
shuttling between Burundi's Hutu-led ruling party and the
Tutsi-dominated military in the capital Bujumbura.
Nevertheless, the roads of northern Burundi were filling with columns
of Hutu refugees -- almost exactly one year after the Hutu presidents of
Rwanda and Burundi were killed in a rocket attack on their plane,
unleashing the genocide of up to one million Tutsis and a three-month
civil war in Rwanda.
Should demands for revenge recur, ''you can see the carnage that would
cause. There will be two million dead,'' Dubre predicted in Paris.
A spokesman for UNHCR in its Geneva headquarters urged Burundi to
protect the refugees and Tanzania to keep its borders open.
''With the anniversary of the outbreak of the genocide in Rwanda
approaching, tension has risen significantly in the region also and this
may have contributed,'' he added.
More than two million refugees fled Rwanda's bloodbath last year to
neighbouring countries and tens of thousands died of disease in camps in
Zaire. Aid workers are afraid that history will repeat itself.
''There are 45,000 on the move so far in northern Burundi towards
northwest Tanzania. Right now we just hope this doesn't snowball,'' said
UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler in Nairobi.
They decided to leave after more than a week of ethnic unrest in
Burundi, in which at least 200 people died, and the evacuation -- by
plane -- of hundreds of European expatriates from the capital
Bujumbura--Reuter.

Bucharest, Friday
ALL 59 people aboard a Romanian Tarom airlines Airbus were killed
today when it crashed and burst into flames after takeoff for Brussels.
''The plane is completely destroyed and there are no survivors,''
Tarom said in a statement after the Airbus went down in a field during
driving snow and rain at 9.11am.
It gave no clue as to the cause of the crash but a witness told a
radio station he saw an explosion on the aircraft before it crashed near
the village of Balotesti, north of Bucharest, three minutes after
takeoff from Otopeni international airport.
State-owned Tarom said it ruled out pilot error as a cause.
''I categorically rule out any pilot error,'' Tarom general manager
Nicolae Brutaru told reporters .
Brutaru gave no other explanation for the worst crash in the state
airline's history, saying he would have to wait for an inquiry by an
Airbus Industrie team on its way from Toulouse.
He said the weather had been satisfactory, although it was snowing.
Tarom said it was grounding its two other Airbus A310s pending the
Airbus investigation into the crash.
The airline said there were 49 passengers and 10 crew aboard -- 32
Belgians, nine Romanians, three Americans and two Spaniards, as well as
one each from France, the Netherlands and Thailand.
Railway worker Valentin Mocanu told Radio Total he heard and saw a
blast from the aircraft before it hit the ground shortly after takeoff
from Otopeni airport.
''I was very afraid when I saw and heard firstly an explosion in the
air and I saw the plane flying too low with fire coming from the back of
the plane,'' Mocanu said.
''There was a second explosion when the plane touched the ground, it
was a huge explosion,'' he said.
The same Tarom flight to Brussels was the subject of a bomb threat on
March 15 which forced the Boeing 737 aircraft to divert to Timisoara in
the west of the country, where a search failed to reveal anything.
Shortly after today's crash police closed Baneasa domestic airport in
Bucharest after a bomb threat from an anonymous caller. Tarom had no
comment on either bomb threat and police did not publicly link the crash
with the threats.
Another Tarom Airbus was involved in a near disaster over Paris Orly
airport in September when it went into a steep dive. A French
investigation reported in November it had found no fault with the
aircraft.
Little of the aircraft remained after Friday's crash. Wreckage was
strewn over a huge scorched area in a deep crater, littered with
suitcases, debris and human limbs, witnesses said.
Firefighter Vasile Alupoaiei told how his crew battled to put out the
burning aircraft but in vain.
''It was real carnage,'' Alupoaiei said. ''We fought for an hour and a
half with the flames. The scene was terrible with severed heads, limbs
and hands scattered all over the place with the remains of the
aircraft.''

Beirut, Friday
ISRAELI guns, planes and helicopters pounded south Lebanon today in a
major upsurge of fighting after Hizbollah fired rockets into northern
Israel, killing an Israeli and wounding six.
At least eight Lebanese villagers were wounded as Israeli helicopters
machinegunned half a dozen villages and Israeli gunners bombarded
villages across south Lebanon with heavy artillery in reprisal for the
rocket assault.
Security sources said hundreds of shells exploded in all sectors north
of Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone -- the last active frontline
in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Israeli planes simultaneously fired rockets at suspected Hizbollah
hideouts in Iklim al-Toufah, a mountain ridge east of the southern port
of Sidon from which the guerrillas launch attacks on the Israeli zone.
Five Hizbollah (Party of God) militants were wounded in the bombing
and shelling, security sources said. One rocket demolished a school in
the village of Ain Bouswar in Iklim al-Toufah, they added.
Hizbollah guerrillas sparked the heavy Israeli response by unleashing
about 15 Katyusha rockets at Israel after an Israeli helicopter killed a
top guerrilla leader by rocketing his car.
The militant, Ruda Yassin, 48, was one of the top 10 Hizbollah
guerrilla leaders in south Lebanon.
The Israeli helicopter ambushed him after guerrillas killed an Israeli
soldier and wounded one in a rocket and machinegun assault on a
fortified outpost in Israel's occupation zone.
Hizbollah claimed responsibility for the Katyusha attack, saying it
was a reprisal for Israeli ''aggression'' in south Lebanon that had
killed 16 civilians and wounded 60 this year.
Hizbollah Secretary-General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said Israel had
bombarded 75 villages and damaged 212 homes while the world kept silent.
He warned that northern Israel would never be safe while Israel
continued its ''aggression''.
Today's fighting was the worst that south Lebanon has seen in several
months.-- Reuter.

Introducing a new jazz column, Ken Gallacher explains a photograph's
unique place in the history of the music
AFEW weeks ago in New York, in an art theatre in Greenwich Village, I
sat entranced as I watched a film about a photograph. Not just any old
photograph, but one of the most famous photographs in jazz history. It
was the one which appeared in Esquire in l958 when the magazine devoted
a special issue to the music.
I still have the magazine -- and the Daily Express Photonews which
reproduced it -- in the loft. Since then I have acquired a print which
is on sale at the Sweet Basil jazz club, also in the Village in New
York.
It has intrigued me, and probably everyone of my generation of jazz
aficionados, just how the magazine was able to bring 60 jazz musicians
together in Harlem in the morning. Jazzmen, after all, are
night-blooming people. They work late hours, and back then in New York
that could mean three or four o'clock in the morning before they
finished playing.
But somehow the miracle was accomplished and the film, directed by
Jean Bach, tells how it was done. Essentially it came together, as so
many wonderful things in jazz do, by the improvisational qualities which
are basic to the music and to the people who make that music.
The photograph hung on the wall of the late Bob Bach -- Jean Bach's
husband -- for many years. But the lady was always aware of it from the
time it first appeared and from the stories which were told about it by
so many musicians. Let Jean Bach take up part of the story . . .
''The bass player, Milt Hinton, who is in the picture, told me once
that he had some film of the event. That grabbed my interest and I went
on and on at Milt until he found the home movies he and his wife Mona
had made that day.
''Actually Milt was the expert -- he has books of his photographs
published now -- but, back then, he just told Mona to hold the movie
camera and point it in the right direction. She did that and we have
some film which has great historic value.
The musicians who are there on the stoop of the Harlem brownstone give
credence to that view. But Jean Bach knows it, because she has been so
much a part of it herself.
First as a teenage fan in Chicago in the forties, then when she was
married to the trumpeter Shorty Sherock, and, later, in her New York
years as someone who was constantly au fait with the jazz scene and who
could number among her friends Duke Ellington, Roy Eldridge, Billy
Strayhorn, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, Barbara Carroll, Blossom Dearie,
Tony Bennett, Johnny Mercer, Willard Robison -- the list is endless.
Her credentials in regard to making the film are impeccable, which is
probably why A Great Day in Harlem was nominated for an Oscar in the
documentary film section.
If any of the judges had been at the movie-house where I watched it
and been influenced at all by audience reaction, then Ms Bach would have
walked away with the award. The film was applauded as the credits came
up -- as were individual appearances by several of the men who are in
both the picture and the film.
The photograph was taken by Art Kane and the idea came from Robert
Benton, then graphics editor of Esquire but who has since directed many
films, including Kramer v Kramer. Both appear in the documentary to tell
how it all came about . . .
How they could get Count Basie to sit on the edge of the sidewalk
alongside a bewildered gaggle of local youngsters who must have wondered
what exactly was going down in their neighbourhood . . .
How they could entice Lester Young to leave the Alvin Hotel and stand
there in the morning with his so familiar broad-brimmed black hat among
the other New York based stars . . .
How they could persuade the enigmatic Thelonious Monk to turn up . . .
Or how they managed to set up the actual picture when they did
eventually have everyone there.
With great difficulty, is the answer to the latter question. Milt's
home movie and the words of Kane and Benton confirm that. What they had
was a group of disparate personalities, almost 60 famous and fierce
individualists, who spanned the history of the music.
Somehow, Kane, seen running around desperately trying to herd the
various personalities into some form of order, succeeded, although the
trombonist J C Higginbotham, habitually carrying a drink with him, if
you look closely at Hinton's footage, seems ready to sabotage the whole
set-up as he greets old friends!
Yet this little miracle in Harlem worked. You see the great Chicago
drummers Gene Krupa and George Wettling standing together. Then there is
the quirky eccentric of the clarinet, Pee Wee Russell, beside the
classically trained, technically endowed Buster Bailey, once of the
Fletcher Henderson Orchestra.
The legendary Harlem stride pianist Lucky Roberts stands just in front
of the Blue Note star Horace Silver. And, in the middle of the front
row, looking as imperious as only he knew how, is Coleman Hawkins,
without the trade-mark soft hat, but standing there exuding personality
and an innate self-confidence, a knowledge of how important he is and
why he is there centre-stage.
There are absentees, some explained, some not. The cornetist Jimmy
McPartland, a prodigious drinker in his day, had a hangover and simply
could not get out of bed even though his wife, pianist Marian, is there
with another famous jazz lady, Mary Lou Williams.
The making of the film took four years out of Jean Bach's life as she
travelled the States to talk to the musicians in the photograph who
remained on the scene.
Three of them have since died -- tenor saxophonist and founder member
of the Chicagoan school Bud Freeman, and trumpeters Max Kaminsky and
Dizzy Gillespie.
Recalls Bach: ''I went out to Chicago to see Bud who was utterly
charming, as only Bud could be. By this time he was in his eighties and
staying in a retirement home, what used to be the old Edgwater Beach
Hotel, and while it was comfortable I had the feeling that Bud would
have liked something a little snappier. He talked so well of that day
and how it all happened.
''Then I went upstate in New York to see Maxie and, again, we talked
for hours in a little inn near where he was staying.
''Dizzy was more of a problem. Trying to pin him down was very
difficult but finally I discovered he had a dental appointment in the
city -- his wife told me that -- and I knew he would not miss that date.
So I went along and cornered him there and that's how we have him
chatting on film.''
Jean Bach had the help of director Robert Altman's wife Kathryn and
together they have created a jewel of a movie. There is a British
distributor and we can only hope that the film will be shown during the
Glasgow or Edinburgh Jazz Festivals.
As to the Oscar, Jean Bach says: ''There is a lot of skulduggery which
goes on but it was important to get the nomination. Some of the other
entries are pretty doom-laden, one about Alzheimer's disease, another
about Vietnam, but we are just happy to be in there . . . ''
One thing you can't say about A Great Day in Harlem is that it is
gloomy. Even though so many of the musicians have gone, this is a joyous
celebration of the music and the men who made it.

<HEADLINE>Handout to help compete with Lottery. Pools firms win betting tax cut</HEADLINE>

THE Government confirmed yesterday that it was giving pools companies
a huge tax handout to help them compete with the National Lottery.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is cutting the pools betting levy from 37.5%
to 32.5% -- a tax-saving gift of #30m.
The move, which forms part of the Finance Bill and should take effect
from May 6, aims to limit the serious damage being done to pools
companies' business by the enormous popularity of the Lottery.
Littlewoods paid more than #318m in betting tax in 1993-94. The
Lottery is levied at just 12% because 25% of its income also goes to
Government-nominated good causes.
The tax boost comes after a package of other measures introduced
recently by the Government to help the pools firms.
These include allowing betting shops and other retail outlets to
distribute and collect coupons, lowering the age limit for playing the
pools from 18 to 16, enabling prizes that are not won to be rolled over,
and permitting pools advertising on TV and radio.
Pools companies pressed the Government for action after seeing a sharp
fall in turnover. They have agreed that the cut in duty should enable
them to maintain their contributions to the Foundation for Sport and the
Arts.
The Foundation spends two-thirds of its funds on sport and a third on
the arts, and in 1993-94 offered grants totalling about #60m.
The position of the Football Trust, funded by an earlier 2.5% cut in
Pool Betting Duty and Spot the Ball Competitions, is not affected by the
change.
* The National Lottery will not stop most people giving to charity,
Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell said yesterday.
A new study which says far fewer people are giving to charity as a
result of the lottery was ''interesting'' but not ''the whole story'',
he added.
Mr Dorrell was speaking after the National Council for Voluntary
Organistions released figures showing the percentage of the population
giving to charity has dropped from 81% to 67% since the Lottery began in
November.
''The NCVO seems to be saying that people's willingness to donate to
charity is simply and solely related to buying a lottery ticket. Common
sense says that cannot be the whole story,'' he said.
* Cancer charity Tenovus axed 500 jobs this week because of a
''catastrophic'' slump in fundraising. Since November, sales of its
scratch cards at supermarket kiosks had plunged 25%, it said.

BIRD lovers worldwide are awaiting the result of a unique attempt to
bring back the world's most threatened species from the brink of
extinction in the wild.
A Spix's macaw -- the only one of its kind still living in its natural
habitat -- has been offered a partner at long last. However, the
problems are only just beginning.
After years of planning, a captive female Spix's has been released in
the Brazilian jungle at Curaca by the Loro Parque Foundation. However:
* The sex of the wild macaw is not even known -- with further DNA
''fingerprinting'' of eight moulted feathers underway to determine its
gender;
* The lovesick parrot has already paired up with another species of
macaw, the Ara maracana -- which is unlikely to take kindly to the
appearance of a rival suitor:
* The female, which has spent years in a cage, is being played songs
of the wild bird in a bid to stimulate movement and track her intended.
So far, she has flown only 300 metres before resting in pinhao trees.
The small, blue Spix's macaw is endangered because of the lucrative
trade in exotic wild birds, hunted down for sale to pet shops, with
Europe the world's largest market.
However, a breeding programme has raised the caged population to 30
birds. The number of pairs is 10, limited by a lack of females despite
breeding programmes in Brazil, Spain, Switzerland, and the Phillipines.
The female, hatched and reared in the wild, spent many years in
captivity before rescue by the Loro Parque Foundation which has spent
more than #80,000 in the bid for a reintroduction to the jungle.
Mr Wolfgang Keissling, owner of Loro Parque, said: ''If they get
together in the wild, it will be the most sensational step in aviculture
in the last 100 years.''
* Despite the date, the above IS a true story . . . unlike yesterday's
spoof in The Herald that plants which give out as much heat as a 2kw
electric fire would be on sale, from today, in garden centres.

A philosopher's lot is not a happy one, or so it seems to Jim Hewitson
IT'S a sad fact that, in Western culture at least, we have no record
of a happy philosopher. Perhaps like me you find topics such as
political economics, metaphysics, or constitutional history about as
riveting as watching paint dry. Okay, I'm an amoeba, a low life. I like
Bon Jovi, savour Blind Date, support Clydebank . . . and beer is my
cheer. But for me life is no peculiar paradox, it's great fun. Pure Zen,
man.
Truth is that I feel for those folk whose existence centres around
contemplation of the nature of reality and the cerebral stirrings of
highbrows from Democritus to Sartre, I really do. How do they get their
kicks? Do they ever enjoy a wee chortle?
If the life charts of John Stuart Mill (philosopher) and Thomas
Babington Macaulay (historian/essayist) are anything to go by, then the
answer is firmly in the negative. Here we have two very serious little
boys (both with strong Scottish connections, incidentally) who grew up
to be very serious little gentlemen, indeed.
It's perhaps unfair to judge anyone on the basis of one incident but a
classic anecdote draws together Messrs Macaulay and Mill in a melange of
misery. One day Macaulay troops along to see his pal, tucked under his
oxter the manuscript of the first volume of his famous history of the
French Revolution. That evening Mill gives the manuscript the once over
before absent-mindedly chucking it on the fire. Disaster! A few charred
pages were saved, the rest incinerated. The project was set back by
months, if not years.
After the initial despair you'd have thought the pair would have been
philosophical enough about the incident to crack open a bottle of
something sunny and have a good chuckle over the laws of cause and
effect. Not a bit of it. The grinding of teeth could be heard all over
London.
It's only when you look at the childhood of this pair of intellectual
heavyweights that an inability to laugh in the face of the cosmic joker,
a failure to bend with the breeze, becomes more understandable.
Mill (1806-1873), the son of an Angus shoemaker who joined the
ministry and helped found the University of London on moving south, was
kept apart from other children. Play was forbidden. He met his brothers
and sisters only to pass on the reams of information forced on him by
his father. Lessons for young Mill started at the age of three with
Greek vocabulary, by the age of six he was writing biographies and
getting to grips with maths, economics, logic, and experimental science.
Assailed by his father's constant cajoling and sarcasm, John was not a
happy soul. Parents can be cruel.
Macaulay (1800-1859), born into a Scots merchant family in
Leicestershire, apparently was never a child and ''conducted himself
always with the pompous dignity of an adult''. At the age of one he
asked: ''Is the smoke from that chimney coming from hell?'' By seven he
had embarked on his Compendium of Universal History. Over breakfast the
wee man composed hymns and at 12 he was hooked on the classics. It seems
he jabbered incessantly about Plato and Aristotle, much to his father's
dismay.
Both men achieved great success in their chosen fields but one skill
eluded them. They never learned to lighten up. Perhaps above their
studious night-time desks they should have emblazoned my favourite
limerick on the theme of philosophy:
I suppose I could try if I chose,
But the question is: ''Can I suppose
I could choose what I chose if
I chose?'' I suppose if I chose to.
But nobody knows.

John Fowler and illustrator Mark McLellan guide amateur astronomer
through the prospects for April
CARTWHEELS in space? It happens. You are looking at one, courtesy of
Mark McLellan's illustration -- and a little help from the Hubble space
telescope. On October 16 last year, one of Hubble's cameras took a
photograph in the southern hemisphere which has clarified graphically
what we know about a massive collision in deep space between two
galaxies.
Here it is -- the result of a distant galactic collision some 500
million light years away. Two galaxies crunched together in a colossal
cosmic whammy, whereupon one sheared straight through the other. In the
cataclysm vast amounts of energy were released and gas and dust were
vomited into space to create new suns.
The great ring which formed round the central core in the aftermath of
the shock is composed of clusters of newly-born stars -- vast numbers of
them, several billion in all, bursting out in a series of nuclear
explosions.
You might think the result of all this looks not so much like a
cartwheel as a gigantic catherine wheel, throwing off stars instead of a
shower of sparks, but Cartwheel Galaxy is what astronomers have chosen
to call it. Emanating from the centre are drifts and clouds of stars
which approximate to the spokes of a wheel and indicate that the
Cartwheel is already returning to its original form as a spiral galaxy.
It's pretty certain that one of the two smaller sprial galaxies shown
in the illustration is the one that crashed through and set the whole
thing off. Which of the two did the damage is not certain, for each has
features which suggest it could have been the culprit.
The Cartwheel Galaxy is not visible from this part of the world. But a
sky show of a less traumatic origin will be distinctly visible when the
shooting stars known as the April Lyrids appear. The best time to see
them is likely to be during the three or four hours from 11pm on the
night of April 21. Look for them using Vega on the eastern horizon as a
marker (see chart).
There are not many of them -- only about a dozen per hour -- but each
one is bright and leaves a long trail. They are high-speed travellers,
so be alert.
Mark's chosen constellation of the month is Ursa Major or the Great
Bear, but more commonly known as the Plough, which can be seen directly
overhead this month. Such names as the the Great Bear and the Plough are
not very helpful. ''Plough? It looks more like a saucepan to me,'' says
Mark, and who'd argue with that? To locate the Pole Star easily you can
use the stars Dubhe and Merak at the far side of the Saucepan -- sorry,
the Plough -- as pointers. Line them up and the Pole Star is directly
beyond.
Five of the seven stars in the group are technically scattered open
clusters of stars, travelling together through space at the same speed
and in the same direction. The exceptions are Dubhe and Alkaid, which
are single stars.

<HEADLINE>UN asked to referee over Lockerbie bomb dispute</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979108059</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ARAB and Libyan lawyers have called for a special session of the
United Nations' general assembly and an international investigating
committee to resolve the legal dispute surrounding the Lockerbie
bombing.
The plea was included in the so-called Hague Declaration on the
Lockerbie case, which was drawn up after a conference on international
law in the Dutch capital last week.
The Arab Lawyers' Union, the Arab Jurists' Union, the Libyan Bar
Association and the General Syndicate of Libyan Attorneys all backed the
declaration.
Britain and the United States issued warrant arrests in November 1991
for two Libyans suspected of planting the bomb that killed all 259
people aboard the New York-bound PanAm flight 103 and 11 Lockerbie
residents in 1988.
At last week's conference, Mr Alistair Duff, the Scottish solicitor
representing the two accused, renewed calls for a trial to be held in a
neutral country before a Scottish judge.
Referring to Mr Duff's appeal, the declaration said: ''The two
suspected Libyan nationals have a basic human right under international
law to a fair trial before an impartial tribunal with full transparency
and publicity of the proceedings. They have already compromised their
legal rights by agreeing to the above mentioned proceedings.''
It later added: ''We call on the member states of the United Nations
organisation to convene a special session of the general assembly in
order to consider the Lockerbie case in all its aspects and to encourage
a peaceful resolution of this serious international dispute in
accordance with the requirements of international law.''
The declaration strongly condemned all acts of terrorism but said
Libyan law did not permit the suspects to be extradited to Britain or
the US. It added that UN sanctions against Libya should be lifted
immediately.
Mr Duff, who spoke at the conference, said the trial of Abdel Baset
Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhima could be held in The
Hague before a panel of judges headed by a Scottish judge.
He said: ''I call on the Crown Office, the UK Government and the
United States to respond positively to this initiative, which comes not
only from Libyan lawyers and the defence team, but from a broad
international coalition of lawyers and jurists.''
A spokesman for the Crown Office in Edinburgh said it was wrong for
the Libyan Government to ''dictate'' where the case should be tried.
Dr Jim Swire, a spokesman for UK Families -- Flight 103, supported the
idea of holding the trial in a neutral country. But Dr Swire, who was
invited to the conference in The Hague, cast doubt on Mr Duff's
suggestion that it should include a panel of non-Scottish judges.
He said: ''We want a fair trial and a Scottish court is the entity we
would go for. That means a Scottish court as it exists in Scotland, with
one Scottish judge.''
He added that proposals for a trial in a neutral country should now be
examined in detail.

<HEADLINE>Driving ban for rugby star Dooley</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE former England rugby internationalist Wade Dooley, a serving
policeman, was banned from driving yesterday for 18 months.
He had admitted driving while more than twice the legal alcohol limit
after being involved in an accident with a teenage girl, who was
seriously injured.
Dooley, 37, of Weeton, near Kirkham, Lancashire, was also fined #300,
had his licence endorsed and was ordered to pay #48 costs.
Magistrates at Blackburn, Lancashire, heard that Dooley, who has 21
years' police service, now faces disciplinary proceedings from his
force.
Mr John Holt, prosecuting, said the accident happened in Kirkham on
the evening of January 14 this year when Rochelle Muskett, 14, ran out
from behind a bus.
''It is clear that Mr Dooley had little chance of avoiding a
collision,'' said Mr Holt.
A breath test revealed that Dooley, the England team's most-capped
second row forward, had 73 microgrammes of alcohol. The legal limit is
35mcg.
Rochelle suffered serious head and abdominal injuries. She spent
nearly three weeks in hospital but was now back at school, said Mr Holt.
Mr Allan Cobain, defending, said that, after playing for Preston
Grasshoppers in Birmingham, Dooley had drunk three or four pints of beer
on an empty stomach, as was his custom. ''It was this which caused him
to be over the limit,'' he said.
Dooley, who retired from international rugby in 1991, extended his
''heartfelt sympathy'' to the girl.
A Lancashire Police spokeswoman said later: ''The matter will now be
referred to the deputy chief constable, who will decide whether
disciplinary measures are appropriate in this case.''

In a restaurant dominated not by
the food but by a portable fire,
Margaret Hughes discovers that you
really must know your companion well
Two Fat Ladies, 88 Dumbarton Road, Glasgow.
FORGET the chef. Forget the food. What really grabs your attention in
Two Fat Ladies (041-339 1944) is the Valor gas fire. It is one of those
heaters that move around on wheels. No doubt its advertising made
reference to its suitability for those difficult-to-heat areas of the
house. In this case it totally dominates the small restaurant.
If your table is at the front of the restaurant you will not get the
full benefit of the fire. On the other hand, if you sit at the back it
will blaze at you. I sat at the back and found that by turn I was too
hot, and in the throes of removing my top layer, then feeling a bit of
chill, and glad I had held on to my jacket. It was annoying.
Closer inspection of the waitress revealed that each time she passed
the fire she would turn it up or down. . This explained my hot flushes,
and provided even more evidence that this fire dominates the life of the
restaurant. The staff were all at it -- the waitress and the chef could
not pass without a dutiful twiddling of the fire knob.
Even the tables in the back are positioned so as not to be too near
the fire. The effect is that they are all so close together you have to
know the person you are dining with pretty well.
Next time I will request a table in the front of the restaurant and
keep my jacket on. This will mean that I can not only regulate my own
body temperature, but can keep an eye on what is going on in the
kitchen, which is situated at the front of the restaurant.
I love the theatrics of food preparation. The sounds. The smells. The
anticipation. The bliss when the plate arrives and delights the eye, as
well as the tastebuds. I am sure when things are really cooking in Two
Fat Ladies it can be tantamount to a night at the theatre. When I
visited it was very quiet, the chef looked relaxed, and was dressed
casually in jeans. He even had time to answer the phone.
The menu is not extensive and includes a lot of fish, some chicken,
and some lamb. There is salmon, cod, haddock, monkfish, scallops. Most
of it is smoked, as is the chicken.
It is not so much the choice which is interesting, but rather that the
menu is written on glass and stuck on to the wall. At lunchtime, the
waitress recites what is available rather than allowing you the luxury
of perusing the choice. I realise this is a small business, but so close
to university-land, where photocopying is cheap, could it not manage
just the flimsiest menu?
Three courses from the a la carte menu cost #21.50. The two-course
lunch menu is a more affordable #7.75. Lunch includes several choices
from the a la carte, and some of the dishes have supplements added if
they are chosen at lunchtime. The cheaper lunch price is obviously
reflected in the size of the portions, which are not large.
I chose a warm salad of smoked chicken served with a mustard dressing
for a starter. This included a supplement, but, quite frankly, I do not
know why. The chicken was greasy, and very fatty. There was a lot of
salad, of the predictable sort -- lollo rosso, radicchio, watercress
etc, and a little chicken. There was also a lot of grainy, oily dressing
-- while not unpleasant, there was just too much. Most starters included
these salad leaves, certainly a lot cheaper for the restaurant, but less
exciting for the customers.
I went on to choose chicken, smoked again, this time served with a
mustard and cream sauce. It was a heady mixture of succulence and smoky
flavour; very good, with a piquant, creamy sauce. The vegetables were a
disappointment, not because they were not fresh or well cooked. Simply,
they were just too predictable -- boiled potatoes, carrots, mangetout,
and broccoli. .
With so much of the food on the menu smoked, I presumed Two Fat Ladies
must be keeping some little smokehouse very busy. However, the waitress
explained it was all done on the premises, in the tiny kitchen.
Desserts include apple and pear crumble, orange and lemon tart, and
chocolate terrine. I chose the terrine, which comes served with a
strawberry coulis.
The terrine is marbled with white chocolate and is very rich. One
spoonful and I was praising its velvety richness, but two spoonfuls and
my jaws were aching from the sweetness. The coulis was very pink and
very artificial looking -- definitely not fresh strawberries. Any
attempt to distinguish anything more than its sweetness had been ruined
by the overwhelming chocolate.
I had not intended having a dessert, but they sounded so tempting it
was hard to say no. What this means, however, is that a very reasonable
two-course lunch turns into a more expensive three-course one. I no
longer felt I was getting a bargain.
The restaurant has a touch of trendiness about it, but it does not
suffer from the angst-ridden seriousness of other trendy eateries. Any
restaurant which puts the unfashionable word ''fat'' in its name knows
that eating out is supposed to be fun, and memorable.
It is a difficult name to forget. So is the huge mural of two fat
ladies. Unfortunately, if they ever do step out of that picture, Two Fat
Ladies will struggle to accommodate them -- either portion-wise or
space-wise.
If you are wondering why the owners did embrace such a delightful
name, take another look at the address.
* Two Fat Ladies is open for lunch Tuesday to Saturday, and for dinner
Monday to Saturday. Lunch is served from noon, with last orders at 1.45.
Two courses are #7.75, not including drinks. Dinner is served from 5.45;
#17.50 for two courses and #23.50 for three courses, not including
drinks. The pre-theatre menu is #9.75 for two courses and is available
until 7.

ONE broken window at the top of the Ca' d'Oro building provided police
with their only clue to the theft in 1986 of a collection of stained
glass windows from the Glasgow landmark.
A gang had taken 27 panels in heavy metal frames across the rooftops
to a multi-storey car park in Mitchell Street, from where they made good
their escape.
They broke into the former ballroom at the top of the refurbished
building and made off with a haul including the 'Gondola' window. This
was designed by Charles Payne, one of the most innovative stained glass
artists of the time, to carry the Venetian theme of the building's
facade into the ballroom. Installed in 1921, it measures 15ft wide and
10ft high.
Mention the ballroom to Glaswegians of a certain age and voices and
faces light up. They recall its beauty, the springy floor, the queues,
the prices, wedding receptions . . . and the wonderful stained glass.
It's ironic that news of the theft has emerged only now, when the hunt
is on again. Half a century of goodwill and nostalgia could have been
mobilised in 1986 and perhaps made it harder to pass the loot up the
line to respectability and easier to trace.
After the raid, 80 items remained -- not major windows but smaller
pieces, many little more than medallions. These were taken into store.
It took two men three days to remove them, giving an indication of the
magnitude of the theft.
By the end of last century, Glasgow led Britain in production of
stained glass and Mr Michael Donnelly, author of a recent book on
Glasgow's glass, emphasises its quality.
''The thieves needed no special knowledge to choose the Gondola -- it
was so colourful, shining, with St Mark's in the background and with
lovely details in very Glasgow-style colours. It made such an impact
anyone would have chosen it.''
By 1986, apart from groundfloor retailers, the magnificent building
designed by John Honeyman in 1872 as a furniture warehouse was empty and
the owners, the Co-operative Insurance Society had asked architects
Scott, Brownrigg &amp; Turner to advise on the Ca' d'Oro's renewal.
The refurbishment seemed jinxed. Thieves got the pick of the stained
glass just before it was to be removed for re-use. Then three days
later, after workmen moved in, a fire struck Honeyman's iron structure.
But it was resilient enough. Despite setbacks, the CIS was unstinting
in its renewal of the A-listed building and Glasgow's House of Gold has
been reborn true to its 19th century outline.
Of the missing glass however, there was no trace until the March issue
of 'Period House and Its Garden' carried a supplement on architectural
salvage. In it there was an illustration of a showroom with Glasgow's
Gondola window as its centrepiece.
A local architect, now a director of SBT Keppie, who saw the Gondola
in the disused ballroom when working on plans for the Ca' d'Oro in 1986,
contacted the police. Soon he was accompanying a detective to visit
Architectural Heritage of Taddington.
Expectancy quickly evaporated. The firm had bought the window in
November 1986 and after restoration exported it with correct formalities
to America in 1991. That they were still using it to advertise the
possibilities of their establishment says a lot about the quality of the
work.
While the police investigation proceeded, the architect was given free
rein by the owner, Mr Adrian Puddy, to search the extensive showrooms
for other Ca' d'Oro glass but drew a blank.
Asked whether he had purchased any of the other 26 panels, Mr Puddy
replied: ''No idea, I'm afraid. I know nothing about the other pieces.
We don't think they came to us. For us, it was the pre-computer era. It
is very embarrassing. I was very upset for the people further back down
the line I had bought it from. I paid a lot of money for it and a
fortune to have it restored because it had been taken out so badly.''
''Up to five or six years ago,'' he continued, ''Glasgow was tearing
itself apart. I always thought it was a crying shame. At the time of so
much refurbishment and mindless destruction I was buying a good deal of
stuff from a dealer. His brief was to buy, legitimately obviously,
whatever sort of glass he could.'' The name was passed to the police.
''He was bringing down a load a month. It would include doors and wood
panelling and stuff. Much of the stuff from tenements had tremendous
artisan quality. These things would normally have been shipped direct by
the container load to Canada or the US, whatever the quality, so the
dealer was asked to bring down a load a month. If stuff is coming out of
a building you can't blame me for buying things of quality and value --
then they are not lost. They are sold to someone who appreciates them.
''That was the situation wherever 19th century industrial wealth was,
for example in Liverpool. Sheffield had a lot of mahogany panelling in
boardrooms and factories. Where a lot of money was being made it went
into opulence. Glasgow in the late 19th century was the biggest
manufacturer of stained glass in Britain. The second 50 years in a
building's life is always the danger period.
''I bought this stuff perfectly legallly. A lot of things were coming
from demolition. Now the situation has changed, I always ask for a
provenance before I buy. Had the glass been here I would have released
it and claimed from from the dealer I bought it from with VAT and so on
down the line.''
The police statement is terse: ''The matter is being actively
investigated by DC Wardlaw at Stewart Street police station and a report
submitted to the procurator fiscal. Older, empty property with assets
such as stained glass, fireplaces, panelling, or any architectural
fitting of value is always vulnerable. If there is a photographic record
it helps.''

A LARGER than life statue of Scots philosopher David Hume and an arts
centre on Mull will be two of the first fruits in Scotland of the
proceeds of the National Lottery.
The Tobermory Centre, a conversion of the former primary school,
receives the largest of the awards, #85,000.
All of the grants announced yesterday -- totalling more than #180,000
-- were under #100,000, and could therefore be approved by the Scottish
Arts Council's lottery committee.
Figures over that amount require the approval of the council itself.
Mull project co-ordinator, Mary Norton Scherbatskoy, said the award
was the largest grant so far received.
The #25,000 of lottery money is a quarter of the total required, and
Stoddart said yesterday that a similar amount had been promised by the
Bank of Scotland on condition that the work was erected this year -- the
year of its tercentenary.
The eight awards were spread across Scotland, a fortuitous accident
according to lottery director David Bonnar.
Glasgow-based Hopscotch Theatre was awarded #20,000 for a new van, and
Four Acres Charitable Trust, which runs the Cottier Theatre in the
city's West End received #9,500 towards the cost of a new lighting rig.
The Grampian Hospitals Arts Trust has been granted #14,200 for the
commissioning of six artworks for Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, and

John Linklater encounters the model most closely identified with the
late flourish of Sir Russell Flint and uncovers a touching tale
THE curious thing was that complete strangers kept recognising Cecilia
Green. She was a beautiful young woman, and this might have been a
chat-upline, but they kept asking the same thing. Was she Sir Russell
Flint's model? It was an embarrassing enough question, particularly for
one who had never heard of the Scottish artist, let alone seen anything
of his work.
Someone showed her a published album, and she thought that Flint's
plates were ''absolutely brilliant''. She was captivated, and yes there
were some resemblances between Cecilia and the figures in pictures like
Three Gypsies in Languedoc, or between her and the Spanish dancer
Consuelito Carmona, one of the models acknowledged by name in the
compositions.
That was the chance connection. Flint had often used dancers from the
London stage, or ballet performers like Moira Shearer. Cecilia Green's
career as a soloist with the Festival Ballet in London had ended
abruptly when she contracted tuberculosis at the age of 21. She had been
two years in hospital.
''They say in ballet if you've missed a class for one day you know
it,'' she explains. If you miss a class for two days the teacher knows
it. If you miss a class for three days the audience knows it.''
This was 1953 and she didn't know what to do with herself. She had
nothing else to fall back upon. No education. No prospects. Ballet had
been her life since the age of 11. Today she might have gone into
physical theatre, or a less exacting dance form. Back then there were
few options for a working-class girl from East London who had just had
her vocation snatched away from her. There was just this recurring
question about modelling for an artist whose popularity and commercial
appeal had reached its height after he had entered his seventies.
''I was intrigued,'' she confesses. ''But also I needed some money. I
needed some work.'' She says she was persuaded, but she had probably
made up her own mind to seek out Sir William Russell Flint. She looked
him up in Who's Who. She found his phone number in the book. It was a
wet April afternoon and she took the underground over from Hackney to
the unfamiliar world of Notting Hill Gate. There, at the tube station,
she went into a phone box and rang his number.
''He was slightly deaf,'' she recalls. ''I was very naive. I thought
that all famous people would have butlers, but he answered himself and
he was obviously nervous about using the telephone, so he sounded very
brusque. A bit rude and unpleasant. I told him I was a model. He said he
didn't want a model.
''I told him, well, I'm just round the corner. Could you just see me
for a minute? He said, 'You can come if you like. But I don't want a
model.' Bang -- the phone. I thought, I'm not going. But I decided I'd
come all this way. I'd go and see him. He couldn't kill me. I found a
taxi.''
She has said that when the artist opened the door it was as though he
was being confronted by an apparition. He had been trying to paint this
woman all his life. And now she was standing on his doorstep. People
would compare her in those days to Audrey Hepburn, as they would later
compare her to Sophia Loren, her dark, sultry looks inherited through
her Jewish blood, through Russian and middle-European antecedents who
had gone into exile in France, Argentina and now England.
The name had been Grunvogel (green bird) assimilated into simple
Green. She had a magnificent profile, a statuesque neck and a taut,
supple physique, the product of the discipline and stretching exercises
of ballet training.
''I'm sure he smiled,'' she says. ''He had a nice smile. Sweet-looking
man, not handsome. He took me upstairs to his 80ft-long studio, 25ft
high. And that was it.''
Over the next 13 years Cecilia Green would become the artist's
principal model. She became ubiquitous in the late flourish of Sir
William Russell Flint, so that she was identified universally by
collectors as the Flint woman, and this time correctly. He had a star
system for his models that he committed to his diary. Like a
luxuriously-appointed hotel, she was his five-star turn, his favourite,
his inspiration and obsession.
''I didn't like it,'' she says today. ''But then I never liked it.
Never became used to it. But as I say, it was all I could do. I could
have been a shop assistant, or something like that. It paid badly, but
it paid something. I would be earning about 30 shillings a day at the
start.
''He didn't want anybody else. As far as he was concerned, I could
come in every day. But I couldn't stand modelling every day. It was
horrid and boring, and painful, and tiring, and boring again.''
She is talking about this 40 years later. We have met at her West
London home. Cecilia Green, at 63, is still a striking woman. The
profile and the neck are enduring features, but she warns that she can
neither be flattered nor insulted.
She adds: ''I've always been fairly practical. I knew how I was, as
far as I could go. I knew the deficits. It's very difficult to flatter
me, because I flattered myself. And it's very difficult to insult me,
because you could not insult me more than I have myself. I know exactly
what's wrong with me: the arms too short, feet too weak. Now I wouldn't
even begin to criticise my physical appearance, because I'd be here for
a year. Then there wasn't a lot wrong.''
On the sofa we are leafing through one of her books of Flint. She
stops at the 1960 watercolour, A Reclining Nude. ''Isn't that a gorgeous
nude!'' she asks rhetorically. ''It's lovely. Everything about it.''
This has to be taken as an objective critique, because the subject is
patently Cecilia Green. ''Yes,'' she confirms. ''Actually, that looked
like me. That's what I really looked like.''
Then, as afterthought or an explanation, she pursues this idea of her
connection, one that she underplays. ''I never really saw it as me,''
she confesses. ''It was a picture. Even a portrait of 'Cecilia'.
Cecilia's this or Cecilia's that. It's not me, it's a name. There's lots
of people called Cecilia. I didn't see them as portraits of me. Just
pictures.''
She was like an actress taking on a variety of different roles in the
artist's imagination. There was a strongly theatrical element in Flint's
work, and the figures were added back at the studio, after he had
captured the setting on his trips, often in France, Spain or Italy.
''He'd never paint me in a picture on site,'' explains Cecilia. ''He'd
paint in the background. Bring them back from France to paint in the
figures.''
This became a matter of collaborative discussion between artist and
model. ''He'd say, what can we do with this?'' Poses were never dictated
by the artist. The model would agree a theatrical ambiguity, a narrative
element to the picture, and essay her own pose to bring a life to the
picture. Sometimes it was a purely decorative element. Sometimes it
suggested a story that the viewer could follow. Always it supplied the
final dynamic for the work.
It irritates Cecilia Green that the surviving reputation of Flint,
among the collectors and London dealers at least, emphasises the nudes
of the late period, and neglects his sublime skill in watercolours of
rare luminescence and depth, achieving masterpiece after masterpiece
among his landscapes and wonderfully angled observations of buildings
and the human activity surrounding them.
''The British get so worked up because of his nudes,'' she complains.
''It's pathetic and puerile. Because he painted a beautiful woman there
was no way that he could make me or any of his other models, there was
no way he could make us less beautiful if he was going to do it
properly. We did not have pock marks or spots, any of us. We were
gorgeous girls. And why should you make a girl, who is actually
gorgeous, ugly? Who could have done that? Perhaps Lucien Freud.
''Willie was a lovely man, but completely misunderstood by the
critics. They say he must have been a kinky character who,
extraordinarily enough, liked painting beautiful women. That was
considered kinky. If he'd liked painting great, fat models like Bessie
Braddock or Eleanor Roosevelt in the nude that would have been very
successful -- with the critics. But because his models happened to be
the most beautiful girls in London, he is undervalued today.''
Cecilia Green split with Flint in August 1966. She had been wavering
for a while. In 1960, she had made the break for several months and
appeared in television adverts as the Camay girl. Her marriage, in 1958
to John Simmons, reinforced her sense of rebellion, although the husband
and the artist got along very well and she was encouraged to continue
with her modelling. Finally, she had to say she'd had enough. Flint was
distraught. His diaries record his black depression.
''I always hated modelling,'' she confides. ''It bored me to tears.
Though I loved Willie in a way. He was lovely, sweet and gentle. He was
very intelligent, witty in a Victorian way. Clean-minded and decent. But
you take the person you love most and put them in a room with you for
hours and hours without talking, and see how kindly you will feel about
them at the end of the day. I was screaming to get out.''
Cecilia Green remains an authority on Flint. There are prints and
drawings by Flint in her elegant living room, along with a couple of
Rouault mono-prints. An accomplished sketcher and painter in her own
right, Cecilia has made an affectionate parody of the Flint style in
Russell Flint In Piccadilly Circus, in which the model turns artist to
reprise some 35 of her famous poses.
Yet she slightly resents the popularity her name and presence has
given to his prints and reproductions, the ones best remembered by the
public. She is uncomfortable with the fact that a Cecilia now boosts the
price. ''Why me?'' she responds. ''It's nothing to do with me. It's the
way he painted me.''

THE Government yesterday ruled out the rationing of treatments based
on national lists of what was available to NHS patients.
Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley said such a move was ''neither
desirable nor necessary'' as the Government published its response to a
Commons select committee report on priority setting in the NHS.
Arguments over which operations should be available for patients was
highlighted this month in the case of cancer victim Child B, whose
health authority refused to meet the #75,000 treatment bill.
The girl is now undergoing chemotherapy at a London clinic after an
anonymous benefactor offered the funds.
However, the row placed the spotlight on doctors' daily dilemma of
which patients are entitled to expensive and sometimes pioneering
treatments.
Mrs Bottomley, welcoming the committee's support for the Tories'
approach to priority setting, stressed the Government, with the select
committee, rejected the idea national lists should be drawn up of which
treatments are available
She added: ''No one list could ever hope to accommodate the range and
complexity of the different cases which individual clinicians face all
the time.

THE loss of a no confidence motion by the ruling SNP administration on
Tayside Regional Council has sparked off a bitter war of words with
their Labour opponents, with the two sides trading insults yesterday.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson called it ''an
administration in its death throes and unfit to govern'' following
broken promises and the loss of political direction.
Labour's local government spokesman, Dundee East MP John McAllion,
said they had lurched from one blunder to another in an effort to set a
budget.
In an effort to stave off capping, the SNP administration had decided
on #1.5 million in social work cuts and then tried to switch the cuts
onto roads and transport.
At Thursday's meeting the SNP then accepted a Labour amendment, but
this did not avoid a Tory no confidence vote which Labour then
supported.
This led to the deputy leader of the SNP, Dr Allan Macartney MEP,
branding Labour ''thoroughly juvenile'' and an ''irresponsible, wrecking
opposition'' yesterday.
He added: ''Voting with the Tories in Tayside is nothing new for
Labour. They have done so over 50 times since the SNP took over. The
people of Tayside deserve better than such blatant, pre-election
opportunism from the Tory and Labour twins.''

THE Scottish Tory Party was criticised yesterday for not joining other
political parties in supporting a checklist of action needed on
homelessness produced by the pressure group Shelter.
The Conservatives declined to appear at a news conference in Edinburgh
where the checklist received backing from representatives of the main
opposition parties.
Kathleen Caskie, for Shelter, said Mr Roger Pratt, director of the
Scottish Conservative Party, had said in a letter that the checklist
represented a reasonable summary of Government policy. He did not think,
however, it was appropriate for the party to endorse the checklist.

A JUDGE yesterday refused to lift the suspension of a Labour
councillor who intended to stand in next week's single-tier authority
elections.
The suspension, imposed on Mr Paul Mack by a sub-committee of the
Labour Party's National Executive Committee, means that the party will
not now have a candidate to contest Huntershill, in Renfrewshire.
Lord Cameron was told at the Court of Session that Mr Mack, of
Cathcart Crescent, Paisley, is the sitting councillor for the
Huntershill ward of Renfrew District Council.
The candidate for the seat on the new unitary authority withdrew an
hour before nominations closed on March 14 and, to prevent the ward from
being uncontested by Labour, Mr Mack was adopted as the official
Scottish Labour Party candidate.
On March 20 the development and organisational sub-committee of the
NEC decided to suspend Mr Mack from holding office in or representing
the Labour Party.
Mr Peter Hutchison, counsel for Mr Mack, told Lord Cameron that his
client had not been informed that his possible suspension was to be
discussed, and had no opportunity to put his case to the sub-committee.
He had been told in a letter after the meeting that he had been
suspended, pending an investigation into his conduct. He had not been
advised as to what investigations were to take place or when a report
might be produced.
Lord Cameron said that he could not rule at this stage that the
decision to suspend Councillor Mack was unreasonable.
He was also influenced by the fact that, for whatever reason, the
councillor had not come to court for more than a week after the decision
to suspend him.
Last night Mr Mack did not see the court decision as a defeat. He said
that, while Lord Cameron had not granted the interim motion, he had
agreed to continue the case until Tuesday.

POLICE in Glasgow mounted a major anti-shoplifting operation
yesterday* as part of an attempt to reduce further the level of crime in
the city centre.
Superintendent William McMillan said last night that 18 people had
been either arrested or reported for theft during a four-hour campaign,
led by plain-clothes and community officers, assisted by store
detectives.
Most of those detained were under the age of 25, with the youngest a
10-year-old boy, and the oldest a 79-year-old man.
Police said 13 adults had been arrested and five juveniles reported to
the children's hearing.
The alleged thefts involved alcohol, compact discs and clothing.
Superintendent McMillan said he was very pleased at the outcome of the
operation, which could be repeated in coming weeks.

Come chucking-out time in any bar and it's easy to separate the women
from the boys. They may not deserve the brash image of Coronation
Street's finest but, as Joe Donnelly discovers, the pub landlady is
talented and smart enough to deal successfully with any bar-room
backchat, take care of business -- and keep up spirits all round
The number of women running pubs, lounges, hotels, and restaurants is
growing all the time, because they're good at it. They want to make a
career of it
It doesn't matter really whether they are men or women. We just seek
the best talent
SHE's built like an all-in wrestler. She's got a face like a pit bull
and a temper to match. Maybe she even shaves once a day. She's a pub
landlady. A grizzled veteran and victor of many a brawl. She makes grown
men quake in their shoes and slink off quietly at closing time. She is
Bet Lynch and Pat Butcher rolled into one big, blowsy bundle of brawn.
Isn't she?
OK. That's the myth. That's what men imagine to be the truth. She's
the stereotype.
But here's the reality. Ten to one she's young and confident. She's
presentable and she speaks eloquently. She's bright and hardworking. She
can manage her staff and the occasional stupid drunk.
It's odds-on -- better than two to one -- that she's running your pub
tonight. That's the reality in Scotland where the women are showing the
chauvinists across the Border a clean and classy pair of heels and an
array of polished glasses behind the bar.
Forty years ago, a decent woman wouldn't be seen dead going into a
pub. Now the decent women are running the bars. In England, one in 10
pubs are run by women. In Scotland less than half are managed by men.
It's been a quiet invasion. Hardly anybody noticed. A traditionally
male-dominated, male-oriented industry which employs thousands and makes
billions in profits, has been surreptitiously taken over. This gentle
appropriation means that women now manage 50% of Scottish &amp; Newcastle's
premises. They run 60% of Tennents Taverns and between 40% and 70% of
Alloa's bars and lounges.
The number of women running pubs, lounges, hotels, and restaurants is
growing all the time, because they're good at it. They want to make a
career of it. It's their family and social life, work, rest and play.
Today's landlady may be tough, but she's tough in business, adept at
organising, expert at managing staff and she'll have qualifications,
both academic and professional. The chances are she started as a
part-time barmaid while still at college and fell in love with the
business.
Such a boss is Caroline Stuart who has managed the Balloch Hotel,
close to Loch Lomond, for the past seven years; she's been with Alloa
twice as long and been a manager for a decade.
''I trained as a home-economics teacher and after I got my
qualifications, I couldn't get a job. I had worked in bars to support
myself through college and just continued. I liked the work. I came from
a farming family who did bed and breakfast, so I was used to dealing
with people. I don't regret not going into teaching.''
Caroline ran the Ardencaple Hotel near Rhu in Dunbartonshire before
taking over at Balloch, which is a busy venue in the off-season and
needs 50 staff to cope in the summer months. Her husband, Eric, a former
agricultural engineer, is her assistant -- they've always worked
together since they were married -- and the hotel and its staff are home
and family.
''I just couldn't imagine me doing anything else. I'm a traditionalist
and I prefer to run a hotel operation. It's a great challenge and it's a
full-time job. Full-time meaning 24 hours a day if necessary. Very often
it is necessary. I can be up at six for deliveries and still working
beyond midnight. It's a way of life.''
Does she see herself as a Bet Lynch?
''Not at all,'' Caroline said. ''I'm tall, at five-ten, tall enough to
make a troublesome man think twice, but I prefer the gentle approach.
Also, I'm dark-haired. I wear business suits and I have a head for
figures. I don't have any particular ambition to run the company. I just
love my hotel and the business I work in.''
Beverley Murray, manager of the Golf Tavern, a Scottish &amp; Newcastle
bar in Edinburgh's Bruntsfield, says she runs a traditional
establishment, popular with the rugby crowd and businessmen.
''We've a thriving food business here,'' 27-year-old Beverley says.
''We do traditional dishes, like steak pie. Lunchtimes are busy. In the
evening we have a good clientele, many of them regulars. They like this
place because they get good service and a warm welcome. My job is to
make sure they feel, if not at home, then welcome. A manager should
establish the atmosphere and make sure it's conducive to enjoyment and
relaxation.''
She's been in the trade for the past seven years. She started as a
part-time waitress when still at college and she gave up her course
because she decided she loved the work. She believes she's worked in
most of the pubs in Edinburgh. Now she manages a staff of 25.
''I don't regret not finishing my college course,'' she said. ''I
doubt if I would be managing a thriving business and such a large staff
at my age if I had gone into any other business. It's good to know that
in Scotland, women are so much at the forefront of the trade. We're good
at it. The culture of the country is changing and the pubs are changing,
too. I think there are so many of us in the business because we are so
good at managing that change.
''We also enjoy the work. This is my social life and my profession. I
meet so many people here that there's never a dull moment.''
Another Pat Butcher at the Queen Vic? ''I'm blonde and petite. I can
see over the bar, just. And I don't think I'm what you would call a
traditional bar manager. I think I'm a good one, though, and one day,
hopefully, I'll own my own business.''
Liz Tyson, of Cafe Qui in the Italian centre in John Street, Glasgow,
is boss of this upmarket bistro and restaurant in the centre of town.
She took City and Guilds in Hotel and Catering because she wanted to
''do cooking''. She joined Trust House Forte and worked in the Post
House.
''I found it hard to move up in the hotel business so I decided to try
the pub trade. I haven't looked back since.''
The 31-year-old, in charge of 50 restaurant and bar staff, says: ''The
image of the bar manageress has changed. We are running a business here.
My restaurant can seat 160 people. We're popular with businessmen,
students, couples out for the night, so we can cater to the demand.
''There's a kind of stigma, quite unfair, of course, attached to
people working in the trade. You get pigeon-holed. You're supposed to be
rough and ready, tough as boots. But I'm a businesswoman who is good at
her job and proud of it. I wear suits and I see myself as a trained
professional.''
Her ambition? ''To become an area manager for Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
It's another step up the rung.''
And her greatest success? ''I ran the Beehive in Edinburgh for
Scottish Inns. When I started it was making a loss. I took it into
profit. I'm still proud of that. It was my proving ground and I
delivered.''
Cath Fraser, boss of the Northern Bar, an Alloa outlet in Canonmills,
Edinburgh, has worked in the bar for six years and managed it for four.
''I ran a delicatessen and did bar-work for the social life.
Eventually that just took over. Now I'm a professional manager. Alloa
spare no expense on training. I've been through the British Institute of
Innkeeping course, done health-and-hygiene courses, wine appreciation,
and plenty of other educational courses. They want good managers and I
believe they have them.
''I've just achieved a 100% mark in customer care, which involves
incognito inspectors checking us out. That's something I'm very proud
of, for myself and my nine staff. It shows that we are working together
well as a team and it also demonstrates that we do provide a good
service.
''My pub is good for lunchtime food, and at night we have a mixed
clientele. It's always busy and we try to entertain as well as provide a
service. We run discos and hire live bands, because I believe the
customer is looking for more than just a pint.''
Ambition? ''I just like working with the customers. It makes a
pleasure out of business.''
Alloa is the only one of the big three companies to have a woman on
the board so far, but it's only a matter of time. Carolyn Dyer is the
company's personnel manager.
''At the moment about 35% of our premises are managed by women, though
it is often above 50%,'' she said.
''It doesn't matter really whether they are men or women. We just seek
the best talent and then we invest in training, invest quite heavily,
too. We are recruiting, everybody gets an interview irrespective of who
they are because we have a healthy belief in talent and we know there's
plenty around.
''I managed a restaurant in Edinburgh and I've worked as a waitress
and barmaid, so I know the business from the bottom up. I was offered
the post of manageress of the restaurant and five years later a job fell
vacant in Alloa's personnel department. I got the job and they put me on
a two-year postgraduate course at Napier. That shows the investment the
company makes in the staff once they've made a decision.
''Now I'm responsible for the staff in 150 pubs, hotels and
restaurants. I may be the first woman executive member of a major
brewery and catering company, but I won't be the last. With the number
of women who are running our businesses today, there's too much talent
available in the pool for it to be ignored.
''As I said, it doesn't matter whether a person is male or female. It
matters that they are good at the job and are committed to it.''
Carolyn said it's an exciting time for the trade. ''Things are
changing and companies have to change with the times. We have one
manager for each of our premises supported by a team of staff. Most of
them have come up through the ranks, which is the best possible training
ground.''
Scottish Inns management said: ''We have a policy of employing the
best people to do the job, and as you might expect, 50% of our managers
are female. They work successfully across all our different types of
pubs from city centre to disco pubs to those serving local communities
and in all cases they do a very good job.
''The quality and character of our managers is very important to our
customers and we use a range of challenging interview techniques
including situation interviews and business skills to ensure our
recruits are the best.''
So will we eventually see a woman chairing the board? That might take
a bit longer. But a woman who can handle a mean drunk in a city bar, who
can be diplomatic with temperamental chefs, grumpy old men, and noisy
teenagers and still roll out the barrel when she has to; who can master
the intricacies of a busy pub till down to the last penny on a busy
Saturday night; who can still look bright-eyed on the Sunday morning.
She'll handle the suits on the board any day of the week.

SCOTTISH National Party leaders yesterday accused the Labour Party of
juvenile behaviour within local government because its members were
prepared to side with the Tories to try to inflict defeat on the
Nationalists.
They cited Labour's support for the Tories in a vote of no confidence
against the minority SNP administration in Tayside earlier this week and
claimed that Labour had voted 50 times with the Tories since the
Nationalists took control of the region.
At a local election press conference in Edinburgh, SNP national
secretary, Mr Alasdair Morgan, said: ''The SNP were voted in by the
people of Tayside and are not going to give way to an unholy Tory/Labour
alliance -- the only conceivable alternative to the SNP and one which
Labour actually considered after last year's regional elections.
''The people of Tayside deserve better than such blatant pre-election
oppportunism for the Tory and Labour twins.''
In Grampian, where the SNP and the Liberal Democrats share power, he
said Labour had voted with the Tories against some of the most
beneficial aspects of the SNP's ''Warm Up For Winter Scheme''.
In Central Region, Labour had voted against an SNP proposal to
implement a similar anti-fuel poverty package there, he said.
SNP leaders also used figures on council tax and local authority rent
levels to back up their claim that Nationalist-controlled councils cost
less and delivered more.
Average Band D council tax in SNP-run Tayside and in Grampian was
nearly #30 lower than the average Labour council tax, they said. They
also claimed Tory and Liberal Democrat taxes were significantly higher
than SNP levels.

A CONSERVATIVE council will be a cheaper council with improved
services, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang claimed yesterday.
He was speaking during a visit to Ayr to campaign with local
candidates for next week's council elections.
Mr Lang defended the record of Kyle and Carrick District Council
describing it as ''successful, businesslike and offering something to
everyone.''
He said that the voters of South Ayrshire should look carefully at the
record of the Tory-controlled authority and ask themselves what has been
gained over the past three years.
He added: ''The administration inherited a #4m deficit from Labour and
has managed to turn that into a healthy surplus.''
''In addition we have seen the council tax pegged at the same level
for two years while up the road at Strathclyde they are imposing a 14%
rise in their level of tax.''
Mr Phil Gallie, MP for Ayr, conceded that it was ''unfortunate'' that
three Tory councillors had resigned the whip with two standing as
Independents.
He said: ''I believe this was a matter of personality and I am
saddened that this may adversely affect the vote in some wards.''
Later, Mr Lang attended the launch of a #30m regeneration project at
the Ayr Citadel site.
The derelict site will be improved with a new road and ground works in
preparation for a housing and leisure development.

Conrad Wilson
pays due homage
to a great Italian red
THOUGH it does not lack potential usurpers, Barolo remains the pride
of Piemonte -- ''king of wines and wine of kings'' -- more grandiose
than the queenly Brunello di Montalcino, and with a longer pedigree than
Sassicaia, Tignanello, and all the other velvety smooth new-wave Tuscan
reds.
If you want to impress a guest in an Italian restaurant, Barolo is
traditionally the wine to buy. Yet restaurants are rarely the best
places to drink it. For a start, like all great reds, it requires a good
deal of bottle age to make it palatable -- and restaurant proprietors
tend to place a heavy mark-up on older vintages. It also requires to be
cared for, which means that it should not be kept in one of those lofty
bottle racks, subject to constant changes of temperature, with which
Britain's Italian restaurants are prone to decorate their walls.
Even when properly stored, however, Barolo needs special attention,
and must be uncorked hours before it is drunk. Only then does it lose
some of the tannic hardness -- ''firmness'' is the euphemism -- that
forms part of its austere personality. And only then will it give out
all the aromas and flavours -- of tar, truffles, violets, faded roses,
incense, plums, and raspberries, according to Hugh Johnson -- that
connoisseurs imaginatively associate with it.
Good Italian restaurants will prepare a bottle of Barolo for you if
you ask them. They may even decant it for you, if they are sure you will
turn up to savour it. But since most Italian restaurants -- even the
good ones -- tend to permit smoking, you may find that the cigar at the
next table destroys all the efforts that have been made on your bottle's
behalf.
At least one Edinburgh restaurant proprietor, however, has addressed
the problem. Silvio Praino, who runs Silvio's on the Shore at Leith, has
not only banned smoking but has celebrated his achievement by importing,
from a secret supplier in Bologna, a range of Barolos grand enough to
make you imagine you are dining in some famous osteria amid the great
Piemontese vineyards in the hills beyond Turin.
Even before he came upon his latest cache, Silvio -- who is in fact a
Calabrese from the opposite end of Italy -- had no fewer than 18
vintages of Barolo on his list, stretching from 1990 back to 1952. To
these he has now added some further vintages and some of the most famous
names -- Pio Cesare, Prunotto, Ratti, Oddero, Borgogno, Bersano -- which
he recites to you like a litany.
These are not cheap wines, and nobody should expect them to be. But
some of them cost little more than the #15 upwards you are likely to be
charged for an immature, undistinguished Barolo amid the smoke of your
neighbourhood pizzeria.
Valvona and Crolla, as you would expect, stock a few of them in
Edinburgh, including a really regal 1985 Pio Cesare at #15.85, and five
vintages of Borgogno rather more steeply priced. Lash out on one of
these, and you will learn what true Barolo tastes like. It is a wine
with ''conviction'', as Hugh Johnson has put it, and its growers'
palates are ready for as much power as their vines will give them.
High-street chains do not generally sell Barolo of this calibre, and
most of what they do sell -- usually for between #5 and #10 -- tends to
be far too young. On the other hand, it is not necessarily good enough
to keep. Where Barolo is concerned, there seems to be simply no
substitute for the best.

A BELGIAN skipper, cleared by a Scottish court of drug smuggling after
the yacht of which he was master ran aground with #23.5m of cannabis on
board, has been jailed in Belgium for a smuggling offence.
Diver Mr Stewart Locke died in the operation to recover drugs from the
Ambrosia near Peterhead in October 1993.
Its Captain, Peter Ketels, subsequently appeared at the High Court in
Aberdeen charged with drug smuggling and being concerned in the supply
of the drug.
This week Ketels, 36, was sentenced to five-years' jail when he
appeared in court in Ghent on charges connected with a major drug
smuggling ring operating in Europe and North Africa.
Edward Ghos, the 63-year-old owner of the Ambrosia, and Josef Faas,
the principal in the organisation, were sentenced to six and 10 years
respectively.

triangular sandwich was a strange mixture of things -- tomato, egg,
probably a bit of gammon, mozzarella cheese. I asked them to heat it up.
I did a little watercolour in the afternoon (Italians like personal
gifts and I left behind about 10) and then went to a typical Italian
supper at a friend's house. The first course was gnocchi-like little
dumplings made with spinach, dropped in boiling water, and served in
tomato sauce. They had cooked two quite big steaks, one well done, one
medium. I had about a third of the well-done one (I'm not really a steak

chocolate and vanilla -- made into a solid cake.

PLANS to introduce more than 100 new conservation sites in Scotland,
hailed by the Government as effective protection for the country's
natural heritage, have been given only a cautious welcome by
environmental groups.
Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Environment Minister, released the list of
108 proposed sites yesterday. The areas, which form almost 40% of the UK
total, have been put forward for consideration to receive Special Areas
of Conservation (SAC) status which would afford them further protection
from damage and development.
The European Union habitats directive instructed all member countries
to draw up a list of possible SACs. Consultation with interested groups
will now take place and a further list will be submitted to the European
Commission by June 5 this year.
Sir Hector said: ''This announcement is an extremely significant step
towards offering the greatest protection available to those wildlife
sites in Scotland which are not only of importance nationally, but also
internationally.''
He promised ''full and effective consultation'' with land owners and
occupiers, local authorities and interest groups.
He added: ''The Government is committed to taking forward the habitats
directive through positive partnerships with those who live and work on
the land or who earn their living from the sea. Co-operation and
consensus is essential if nature conservation is to be effective and
lasting.''
Scottish Natural Heritage's chief executive, Mr Roger Crofts, welcomed
the publication of the list and said it covered some of Europe's richest
wildlife.
A ski development proposal at Ben Nevis and funicular lifts at Ben
Wyvis and the Cairngorms are among plans which could be affected if SAC
status was granted there.
The Flow Country, in Caithness and Sutherland, and the Scottish
pinewoods would receive some protection, but environmentalist have
warned that the proposals may not go far enough.
Mr David Minns, head of public affairs at the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds (Scotland), said the list was inadequate and ''a bit
last minute''.
He said blanket bogs were still under threat from forestry and peat
extraction and added that only covering part of the Caledonian pinewoods
was like ''saving three Rembrandt paintings and burning the rest''.
He claimed there had not been enough consultation in drawing up the
list and he urged the Government to provide adequate resources for
management of the sites.
''The Government needs to make a continuing commitment to management
of this area with proper resources and I don't see much of that from
this announcement,'' added Mr Minns.
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research at Friends of the Earth (Scotland),
welcomed the extra layer of protection but warned ''two-tier
protection'' could develop.
He said: ''This could leave some of Scotland's best wildlife sites
without adequate protection. Certain areas have been worryingly left off
the list, for instance Loch Leven. There was also no mention of an
increase in resources to cope with the new arrangements.''
The World Wide Fund for Nature described the list as ''meaningless and
obscure'' because sites were ill-defined. Head of operations Mr Simon
Pepper said: ''The Government has taken months to put this list together
but it tells us practically nothing.'' He threatened to take the
Government to the European Court in Brussels if it failed to fully
implement the directive.
A total of 280 areas have been identified as possible SACs throughout
the United Kingdom. The 108 Scottish sites, which incorporated 210 Sites
of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and 15 marine areas, were
proposed by Scottish National Heritage, which is a Scottish Office
agency.

<HEADLINE>Labour economist sparks new storm with calculations on the cost of Scots Parliament.  Lang 'right' on constitutional figures</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBBIE DINWOODIE, SCOTTISH POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A REPORT by the Fraser of Allander Institute, written by an economist
who is also a senior member of the Labour Party, has concluded that the
calculations on the Scottish economy used by Scots Secretary Ian Lang to
attack constitutional change are broadly correct.
Mr Jim Stevens, of the institute at Strathclyde University, maintains
Mr Lang's political conclusions are wrong, even if the figures are
correct, and that the Scottish fiscal deficit is not an argument against
devolution but against separation.
He calculates, on 1992-93 figures, that with a population of 8.8% of
the UK, Scotland raises 8.2% of taxation, rising to 8.6% if two-thirds
of oil revenues are attributed to north of the border. However,
identifiable expenditure ran at 10.3% of the UK total, falling to 9.8%
if other spending is estimated.
According to the calculations by Mr Stevens -- a member of Labour's
Scottish executive and who sparked a row with similar comments earlier
this year -- the Scottish budget deficit runs a #7.25bn without oil
revenues, and #6.4bn if a share of these revenues are allocated.
The report clashes with figures produced by the House of Commons
library staff for the Liberal Democrats this week, and a report which is
about to be published by Edinburgh University researchers.
The latter, ''Scotland's Political Options,'' by Malcolm Slesser and
David Crane, concludes: ''From an economic point of view, there is no
reason why an independent Scotland should not prosper if properly
governed. There is the potential for a higher material standard of
living and more jobs.''
Mr Lang stated in February that ''we raise less than our population
share and spend more,'' and the Fraser of Allander report concurs,
rejecting the ''Scotching the Myth'' argument about hidden subsidies to
the south as relatively insignificant, and adding: ''We have little
difficulty in endorsing the Scottish Office methodology.''
But Mr Stevens insists: ''The existence of budget deficits and
substantial transfers of funds from England to Scotland does not
undermine the basic case for devolution.''
In a comment which will anger many within his party he criticises the
proposal for a Scottish Parliament to be able to raise or lower income
tax by 3p in the pound.
He said: ''English MPs do and will accept voting transfers to Scotland
to support necessary public services. This is part and parcel of being
in a union. However, it beggars belief that English MPs would approve
subsidies aimed at allowing Scots to enjoy tax rates lower than their
constituents.''
The economist is sanguine about the prospect of being criticised,
having already put his argument to Labour's Scottish conference. He said
yesterday: ''The fact is, a lot of truth has been spoken by Ian Lang.
You cannot disinvent the deficit problem.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond reacted angrily, accusing Mr Stevens of
bringingdiscredit on his institute and embarrassment on his political
party. He said that by ''recycling the Tory Party's fiddled figures he
was acting as a propagandist for Ian Lang.''
He went on:''The Scottish people are getting heartily sick of the Tory
and Labour twins saying that Scotland -- the 21st richest country in the
world, with a similar GNP per head as Sweden -- somehow can't stand on
her own two feet.''

TWO Scottish grandmothers were among four women jailed for over four
years in Spain yesterday for trying to smuggle hashish worth #72,000 to
Britain by strapping it to their bodies.
The bungling smugglers were caught because they had wrapped the drugs
in tin foil which set off the metal detector alarm at Malaga airport.
Lawyers for the women -- Gladys McConnachie, 55, from Cleland,
Lanarkshire, her daughter Maihri, 28, Mary Caldwell, 57, from Glasgow,
and Pamela Bell, 30, from Bishops Auckland, Country Durham, argued they
should be fined and expelled from the country because it was their first
offence.
But judges sentenced all four to four years and two months for
breaking Spain's strict public health laws by possessing the drugs and
two months each for attempted smuggling.
The court had been told that they had been befriended by a man called
Pepe at a bar in the holiday resort of Torremolinos, who persuaded them
to take the drugs in return for #1000 each.
Each had three kilos of the drugs strapped to their waists, and were
attempting to board a charter flight back to Gatwick at the end of a
pre-Christmas holiday last December.

THEATRE campaigners in East Lothian yesterday pledged to continue the
battle for fair funding from the Scottish Arts Council, after losing an
appeal against the council's decision to axe funding to the Brunton
Theatre in Musselburgh.
The SAC refused to reinstate grant aid for 1995/96 for the Brunton,
claiming it could not fund three producing theatres in Lothian.
Announcing the move, the SAC's chairman, Dr William Brown, said: ''We
regret this decision very much, but SAC's responsibility is to the whole
range of drama provision across Scotland and to ensure that new theatre
initiatives can develop in areas of Scotland and for groups where there
is little or no provision of live theatre.''
East Lothian District Council immediately pledged to meet the
shortfall, but warned that this could affect its support to other arts
bodies, such as the Royal Scottish Orchestra.
The Brunton Theatre received a grant of #53,541 from the SAC in
1994/95.
Councillor Tom Ferguson, chairman of the Brunton Theatre Trust,
described the SAC's decision as ''unjustifiable'' and said that the
fight for fair funding would continue.
The Federation of Entertainment Unions last night called for the
Scottish Arts Council to be scrapped and replaced by an elected body.

EUROPEAN Fisheries Ministers were hopeful last night they could agree
a revised package to end the North Atlantic halibut war.
A special meeting of Ministers will be held in Luxembourg on Thursday
to try and break the deadlock in the Spanish-inspired dispute between
the EU and Canada.
Britain has enraged the Spanish by invoking Commonwealth links and
heading off trade sanctions against Canada after the seizure of the
Spanish ship Estai in international waters by the Canadians three weeks
ago.
Talks with the Canadians have been going on since to try and work out
a formula to conserve halibut stocks and control fishing on the Grand
Banks off Newfoundland.

AN important step was taken yesterday towards the merger of Scotland's
two school examining bodies when Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said he
favoured the establishment of a Scottish Qualifications Authority.
The option of setting up a new body to take over the work of the
Scottish Examination Board and the Scottish Vocational Education Council
(Scotvec) is one of four set out in a consultation paper on the future
of assessing and awarding qualifications.
Mr Lang said he believed setting up a new body embracing both
organisations and administering the Higher Still reform of upper
secondary schooling had ''considerable advantages.''
The paper said a qualifications authority would:
* Be more efficient.
* Provide the framework for implementing the new awards for fifth and
sixth years of secondary education.
* Streamline the current system for assessing and awarding
certificates for SEB and Scotvec courses.
* Provide better links between education and training at school and
later.
The other options are for one of the two bodies taking the lead for
Higher Still; both taking joint responsibility for implementing Higher
Still; and setting up an independent body to administer the upper school
reform.
The merger of the SEB and Scotvec was seen as virtually inevitable
after the Government produced its Higher Still blueprint, which will
result in both bodies' courses being brought into a unified curriculum
and assessment system.
All Higher Still qualifications, based on courses drawn from current
SEB and Scotvec provision, will be presented on a single certificate,
updated and re-issued each year to take account of pupil achievements.
There will be a mixture of internal and external assessment.
The move to merger was also accelerated by the recent appointment of
businessman David Miller as chairman of both bodies. He said yesterday:
''The consultation process is pleasantly short. Many people in the SEB
and Scotvec are worried about the future, and it is good that the
uncertainty will be resolved soon.''
A deadline of May 9 has been set for responses to the paper. The SEB
will formulate a view on the options at its board meeting early in May.
The main teachers' union, the Educational Institute of Scotland, said
there was a strong case in principle for a single examining body, but
that it should be modelled on the SEB rather than on Scotvec.
Creating a Scottish Qualifications Authority would require
parliamentary approval since the board is a statutory body dealing with
school examinations.
The SEB, which is based in Dalkeith, conducts exams for Standard

through Parliament without properly debating the effect on an accused
person's right of silence, the alleged failure to tackle drug offences
and the problems of poverty linked to crime.

THE TORIES yesterday combined an ''outing'' of Labour leader Tony
Blair with an attempt to regain the middleclass vote. Today the Prime
Minister will re-state the Tory core values -- and these include tax
cuts.
Mr Major's Ministers mapped the way for him in a series of keynote
speeches to the annual conference of Tory activists who made it clear
they would not stand for any further disunity. They were asked to keep
their nerve now that the worst of the recession is over.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke gave a clear signal that direct taxes will
be coming down again in November. ''With the British economy growing
healthier month by month, the day when I will be able to cut taxes is
getting nearer.''
He repeated his pledge that it is just a question of when taxes come
down again, not whether.
The rattled Tories are determined to destroy the squeaky-clean image
of Mr Blair that has put them 40% behind in the opinion polls. A Back to
Basics mark two is being launched to take the gloss off Mr Blair, whom
they see as ''the Trojan horse'' for socialism.
They are building up for a popular attack on Yob Culture, indiscipline
in homes and schools. Renewed attempts to stiffen the punishment of
convicted criminals is on its way, as is a plan to combine tax breaks
for marriages and cuts in benefits for single mothers.
Mr Major, flagging his speech to the conference in Birmingham today,
said: ''Some months ago I set in hand a massive exercise to build the
next phase of Conservatism -- a new agenda, not just for the next
election, but clear through into the next century.
''The work is in its early stages,'' but he intends today to ''lift
the veil on some of the ideas we are developing.''
The rank and file of the Tory Central Council were in no doubt
yesterday as they gathered for their conference what the priorities are
if they are to stand a hope of a fifth term in office: Mr Major remains
leader in a new era of unity.
One speaker from the floor said every MP, inside the Cabinet or on the
back benches, should be reminded their first duty is to the party. They
want the old Tory ideals of independence, self help, neighbourliness,
teachers who are encouraged to discipline their school children. There
is to be a blitz on irresponsible parents and criminals.
Mr Major got the message. He insisted: ''We Conservatives have not
changed our fundamental values for 250 years. Our ambitions and hopes
have moved forward. But our values have been constant.'' This is what he
intends to tell them today to establish a stark contrast between him and
Mr Blair on whom was launched an unusually stern personal attack.
It was begun by the party chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, who appeared to
get maximum loyalty from the voluntary, fund-raising Tory establishment
despite his succession of gaffes. He added to these yesterday by
labelling Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as a ''gnome'' and
suggesting Scotland is a privileged fringe for the Labour Party.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson hit back: ''To say that
Scotland is a fringe nation and a favoured minority is deeply insulting
to Scots. Jeremy Hanley should withdraw his remarks at once and
apologise to the Scottish people.''
Mr Hanley said: ''Blair talks about power for many, but his party is
run by and for the few: the few trade union bosses who control the votes
at their party conference, or the minorites and the pressure groups to
whom they always pander.''
He attacked Labour's ''priority'' of ''the creation of a tax-raising
parliament in Scotland, an assembly for Wales and English regional
government which will mean the abolition of those county councils you
have chosen to preserve.''
0 Trade President Michael Heseltine received the biggest ovation for
his attack on Mr Blair. ''The most startling fact of our time is that
our Labour opponents have been forced to abandon every basic conviction
they held.
''The card-carrying zealots of yesterday are out, advertising agents,
public relations consultants are all the rage. And their task -- to
persuade the electorate that Tony Blair has been a closet Tory all
along.
''All that's new is that he's been outed. In the 1980s he wanted out
of Europe -- now he wants to submerge us in it. In the 1980s he wanted
to march out with CND -- now he's trying to deny he was in it at all.''
Mr Heseltine called for the Tories to find an inner strength
comparable to that displayed by the Prime Minister. ''John Major two
years ago led us to our largest ever popular vote with just a soap box.
It is our task to give him a bandwagon for the next campaign, rolling
forward in an unstoppable campaign to victory.''
Mr Clarke calculated that he should shed some of the prudence he has
adopted over reducing direct taxation again. The Tories now see tax cuts
as being the most dramatic way of getting across to the voters that they
should be feeling better and that the Government really believes that in
two years time they'll be feeling even better still.
''At last October's party conference I talked about reaping a tax
cutting harvest if we had the courage to stick to our economic
principles,'' he said. ''We are sticking to our economic principles and
it is delivering results. I pledged that it was a question of when, not
whether, we return to our tax cutting agenda. I repeat that pledge to
the country again today.'' The time is getting steadily nearer.
Home Secretary Michael Howard gave the clearest markers for the Prime
Minister's new Tory agenda. Priority voters are to be what he called
decent law abiding people all over the country. ''Soft-headed,
Politically Correct attitudes that too many people with too much
influence have held for far too long'' are to be done away with.
''The attitude that victims don't matter. That criminals are not
responsible for their crimes. And that punishment has no place in a
modern society.''
Parents who complain about television violence were told that they
have a weapon to handle it in their own hands which is 100% effective.
''There is no known defence against it. It is called the off switch.''
Back to Basics Mark Two will also include the encouragement of more
voluntary neighbourliness, what Mr Howard calls his Make a Difference
campaign in which young and old give their time and effort to make their
community more secure and stable.

Wendy Jack reflects that it's a small world
...but some of its parts are perfectly formed
Abroad,
whether it's
Italy, France,
or Spain, the
design is
way ahead
ITALIAN furniture, chandeliers, and ceramics . . . Mexican tiles . . .
Chinese and Persian rugs . . . German kitchens . . . in design terms,
the influence of other countries is an ever-growing factor in UK homes.
In today's global village, with our thirst for ever more adventurous
foreign travel, it's not surprising that our national eye is focused on
new, different ideas to bring into our homes.
John Scarlett, the owner of Azteca in Edinburgh, does a huge trade in
Mexican tiles, which are snapped up by customers from the Scottish
islands to London. Mexico and other Latin America countries, he
explains, ''have quite a lot of individuality in each thing that's made.
The pottery, especially the tiles for example, came into Mexico with the
Spanish. They originally got the designs from the Arabians, who brought
them to Spain.
''To an extent the cultures have blended together. It's not so purist
as it once was with Mexican artisans; Spanish designers liked to put
their own stamp on it.''
Typical customers for the tiles, he says, include ''a number of the
Aga-owning classes who go for them in a big way''. Mexican furniture,
which he describes as rustic, has an unfortunate tendency, he notes, to
attract those who can neither afford it nor have a house large enough to
accommodate it.
Totally contrasting with the country looks of Mexico are the
chandeliers and furniture displayed in the Italian Connection shops in
Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Hamilton. Structured formality reigns supreme
here, with glorious sparking chandeliers ranging from the traditional
cascade of crystal and candle-style lights to those designed for the
modern house which hug the ceiling like a glittering skullcap.
At between #400 and #1200, chandeliers don't come cheap, but they
certainly guarantee a stunning focal point which can be handed down the
generations too.
The all-Italian furniture at this shop displays some spectacularly
different dining suites in imitation marble, perhaps in a combination of
apricot and cream colours embellished with gilt, or the increasingly
popular highly lacquered finishes featuring wood effects or a variety of
colours.
Glasgow manager Alex Taylor says: ''In lounge suites more and more
people want leather. It's so practical, a wipe with a damp cloth is all
it needs, and these days it can be invisibly mended if it's damaged. For
people with pets and children leather takes a lot of beating.''
In shades from ice cream pales to rich jewels, their stylish good
looks belie their rugged practicality.
Italy, too, is where much of Casa Fina's ceramic stock comes from:
eye-catching lamps, bowls of flowers, figures, bowls, candlesticks, and
countless other accessories to beautify and complete any room.
Buyer Anne Rodger from the Glasgow shop (branches also in Ayr and
Broughty Ferry) says: ''Customers love the airiness and brightness, the
sunny colours of the ceramics. They're a good contrast to our poor
climate. Women really appreciate these pretty finishing touches.''
Continuing the light and airy theme is Casa Fina's range of canework
furniture. It has a bonus of a degree of customising -- sizes can be
increased or scaled down to customers' needs, and a large choice of
paint colours are available, including the Dulux range, to suit every
room scheme. The shop carries three-piece canework suites, dining tables
and chairs, occasional pieces and bedroom furniture.
The splendid new Linda Reid shop in Glasgow's Giffnock area has a vast
range of ideas for the home, many exclusive to the company -- and mainly
drawn from the Continent.
Manager Eileen Lynn says: ''We've got to go abroad, sadly, for design
and price. It's unfortunate in this country, really, because our
designers just don't get the chance, nobody markets them.
''Our bed linen comes from France, Germany, and Portugal, which are
leaders in design and so advanced. Similarly in furniture design we do
try to give a chance to our own new designers -- we go to lots of
exhibitions -- but there's no-one to back them. Abroad, whether it's
Italy, France, or Spain, the design is way ahead and they back it up
with samples and delivery -- a total package.''

KENNEDY WILSON discovers that a hand-made rug from the Middle East
need not be as expensive as you thought
RUGS at the hearth or side of the bed can give a warm and lived-in
look. Be they modern woollen mats with abstract shapes or traditional,
colourful rag rugs on bare floorboards, rugs can really turn a house
into a home. But nothing has quite the feel of a classic Persian rug,
long the most valuable and sought after. The largest rug in the world is
a Persian rug woven especially for Adolf Hitler's Chancellery building
in Berlin.
For centuries Persian rugs have been imported to Europe and their
colours chosen to suit European interiors and tastes. Traditionally they
have a reputation for being expensive but they needn't be. Now a new
Edinburgh shop sells newly imported rugs from the Middle East. Karabakh
Rugs in Dundas Street is owned and run by Petros Vartanyan, an Armenian
who came to Scotland back in 1966. The shop's name comes from the
besieged Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan where Petros often visits.
Petros has a reputation for the Armenian evenings of food and drink he
hosts for paying guests, but now he has a day job selling hand-made rugs
and kilims from Armenia and Iran (formerly Persia). Prices range from
about #60 and Petros prides himself in value-for-money rugs because ''I
am not in it for money. I love rugs, the colours and the patterns.
''I have some rugs that are more than 100 years old and are still in
good enough shape to be used on the floor. Others are too delicate for
that purpose, and are best hung on the wall,'' says Petros.
One of the most intriguing things in his tiny shop is tall, tasselled
saddle bags designed for carrying cargo on the back of camels. With a
little imagination they can be turned into bolster-style cushions.
Petros's rugs and cushions use natural dyes which make for wonderful
colour combinations of reds, blues, and the spice colours of yellow and
orange. Most are really tough and will withstand a lot of punishment yet
they are very soft under bare feet.
''Many Scottish homes have beautiful timber on the floors and rugs fit
beautifully. A single, simple rug of less than #100 makes a room very
attractive and very warm,'' says Petros.
Petros warns the unwary that many shops fob customers off with cheap,
machine-made imitations posing as genuine hand-woven rugs and he advises
buyers to check the back of the rug -- a machine-made rug will look too
perfect. When a hand-made rug is laid on the floor it should lie flat
and not buckle up.
Here are some tips on how to use and maintain your Persian rug:
* The most popular site for a rug is, of course, in front of a
fireplace, but wherever a rug is placed it can give a luxurious feel and
can also draw attention to a favoured piece of furniture.
* It is important when a rug is on a hard, shiny surface that a
special rubberised underlay is used to prevent slippage and wrinkling.
* Rugs and mats can also be used to protect floor surfaces at busy
junctions at doorways and halls, and this is one main reason for laying
a rug or mat on top of a carpet.
* A soft rug positioned at the side of a bed can also give a wonderful
feeling of welcoming softness to bare feet.
* One of the easiest ways of hanging a rug is simply by using a
wall-mounted carpet gripper strip cut to the correct length.
* Often wall-hanging rugs can attract moths. The rug should be shaken
every six months, the room kept well-ventilated, and mothballs or
mothproofing spray used.
* Karabakh Rugs are at 37 Dundas Street, Edinburgh.

NOT so long ago good Chinese food was only available in restaurants,
writes KENNEDY WILSON. Doing it yourself at home without the proper
ingredients and knowhow was impossible. Now more and more of the raw
ingredients are available in supermarkets. Think of special packs of
stir-fry vegetables washed and diced and ready for use and the array of
stir-fry sauces.
The wok has been called the most basic implement of ethnic cookery and
today most kitchens have one. Quick, easy, and healthy stir-fries have
made Chinese cooking more popular than ever but the variety of woks
available, including electric ones, is huge.
Ken Hom, one of the most famous Chinese cooks, has had several
successful TV series and books but he regularly travels the world
advising hotels and airlines on Chinese cuisine. Recently he has had
another two books published -- the recipe-and-reference guide Ken Hom's
Chinese Kitchen (Pavilion) and Ken Hom's Vegetarian Cookery (BBC Books).
Now a range of woks (in different colours and sizes including a 14in
two-handled, party size version) bear his imprimatur.
Ken is noted for his striving for authenticity in Chinese cooking.
''What matters is to understand the spirit that guided the people who
made the dish originally,'' he says. Too many Chinese restaurants in the
high street serve a Westernised version of Chinese cooking that bears
little relation to the real thing. ''There is hope. A lot of
restaurateurs from Hong Kong and China are setting up not making the
same old cliche dishes.''
The wok's shape gives a relatively even heat on bottom and sides.
Flat-bottomed woks (like Hom's) are best because they can be used on
gas, solid hot plate, and electric (ceramic or induction) hobs. There
are a host of woks available in the kitchen shops, but how do you choose
the best? Recently Ken Hom's super new lightweight non-stick wok (from
William Levene, from #17.99) was voted by a Sunday newspaper as the best
you can buy. There's also professional-gauge carbon steel models -- the
traditional style wok for Chinese food purists.
Because Chinese cooking often used high temperatures for flash-frying
a non-stick wok is ideal for non-experts who have not mastered the skill
of getting the right temperature. If the wok is too hot and you haven't
used enough oil, the food will stick.
The manufacturers insist that you can throw away your other pots
because the Hom Wok is not just for Chinese cooking -- it's ideal for
steaming fish, for pasta, or even frying an egg. Hom's wok is part of a
comprehensive cookware collection which includes cleavers, spatulas,
ladle, turner, and bamboo steamers.
* Ken Hom's Cookware Collection is available from all good kitchen
shops.

If every home in Canada can have a den and a deck, asks
Beverley Brown, why can't we have them in Scotland?
TRAVEL may indeed broaden the mind but it can also induce a longing
for the strangest things. In my case, it was a trip to Canada. Yes, I
thought the CN Tower was a superb, if mildly terrifying, feat of
engineering . . . and I loved Niagara on the Lake and the falls. But
staying in a very average Canadian suburban home left me weak with
desire for an ever so humble den and a deck.
Every Canadian home has them. We would probably call them basements
and verandas, which doesn't quite conjure up the same images. However,
it made me wonder why this particular style of living has never made it
across the Atlantic.
It seems so sensible and Canadians put their dens to a multitude of
uses. Where I was staying, the den was used as the everyday family/TV
room but it was also expansive enough to accommodate a laundry room and
an additional toilet/shower room. Intrigued, I visited several other
homes where dens were used as a gym, games room, playroom, workroom, and
office.
Because they span the length and breadth of the house, these are large
areas that could comfortably form another two or three rooms. By this
time people (fortunately most were relatives) thought I was mad. To them
it was quite simply a question of digging deeper foundations, and voila,
you had a den.
Because the den makes the back door higher, it follows that they also
have a deck. Plain, wooden slats with steps going down to the garden.
The sort of thing we see attached to caravans or holiday chalets
occasionally -- but not protruding from the back of an average suburban
semi. I sat out on the deck with my breakfast cup of coffee every
morning without getting my feet wet or muddy and pondered.
At the same time I also admired their clothes-drying system which is
designed for decks; a two-tiered pulley that allows you to stand on the
deck and peg up the washing without moving. You simply extend the
washing line out down the garden where the other end is attached to a
tree.
This fascination with dens, decks, and washing lines prompted a few
raised eyebrows and more than a few questions as to where I lived back
home. Perhaps they were beginning to think I came from a cave half-way
up some historic glen. I quit before anyone asked me to admire their
sanitaryware. But I came home determined to grill a few builders.
I did . . . but builders looked at me strangely when I posed the den
and deck question. ''It's our weather,'' was the bog standard reply. How
strange. I had noticed weather in Canada too. But Forest Robertson, an
architect with RPM Design, was a bit more forthright. ''Cost would be a
factor but it's really a question of tradition. It has not been the
British tradition to dig down and domestic foundations as we know them
are a fairly new phenomenon,'' he said.
''Many Glasgow tenements didn't have much more than rubble
foundations, hence our problems with subsidence. The other problem is
that builders on the whole can't afford to be innovative. They stick to
tried and tested traditional designs . . . but I worked for one client
in Lenzie who specifically wanted to build a home with a den to house
his model railway. In that instance we dug out 10ft of earth and moss,
put in foundations and concrete retaining walls and tanked it for damp
proofing. It can be done but it's more expensive,'' he added.
I'm mollified, but unfortunately not in the financial position to
build from scratch. But if anyone reading this has a deck I would be
happy to pass on the pulley washing line that I purchased in a Canadian
garage sale and dragged all the way home -- in hope.

I DON'T know what you are supposed to call the entries and stairways
to modern flat complexes, writes IAN WALLS. But, like a large proportion
of Glasgow's population, I lived up a close for years in the West End.
There were certainly no plants on the landings.
Now it is all changed, with secure entries. There are large windows in
modern flats. It is an ideal environment. I find that pot plant growing
is becoming quite a fashion.
There is no problem with central heating, nor is there extreme cold.
The environment seems to suit a lot of plants. If you are lucky enough
to have a veranda, or balcony, this makes things still better.
There is a wonderful lady in Greenock who produces and maintains a
whole range of plants. They go along the balcony where she lives. She
won't take a penny for her efforts from the other residents.
In winter and summer she has a delightful display. While the plants
are open to the elements, the warmth of the building and the overhang
seem to keep frost pretty well at bay. Coupled with this is the
advantage of Greenock's climate, wet but balmy.
In stairways and landings not so well supplied with natural light,
green foliage plants would do best. These go on the window sills,
getting all the light going. A full range can be grown. Lots of people
find this a rewarding way to indulge their pleasure in plants.

QUESTION: I like making my own compost, including riddled soil,
composted leaves, and gritty sand. I find it a nuisance weighing up
fertilisers and lime required. I am told there are products to make the
job easier.
Answer: There certainly are. I have used Chempak, which has a
multi-purpose base, an ericaceous base, a potting base, and a seed base.
These are a blend of fertilisers, slow and quick acting, trace elements
and lime.
They were developed for mixing with peat, but can be used with other
materials and are widely available, reasonably priced.
Q: When I visited your garden last year you had a lovely abutilon in
the front garden. It is supposed to be not very hardy. Why does your one
do well?
A: There are a number of abutilons. The one I have was provided by
Scotplants and is called Suntence. It seems perfectly hardy and has a
long flowering period. Occasional pruning stops it getting floppy.
Pick a sunny spot with reasonable shelter, particularly from
south-west winds and early morning sun.
Q: I like growing vegetables, but not the digging involved. Nor does
my back. I am tempted to hire a rotary cultivator but I'm told I'll
never get as good results as with ''proper'' digging.
A: Rotary cultivators tend to work to a limited depth. Modern types
can be very powerful. If you hold them from running away, you can get
down to a fair depth.
It is claimed a hard pan can result by continual use. This can happen
with heavier soils. I must say I have used these cultivators for years
and never found detrimental effects.
One problem with hiring them is that it may require several
rotovations over a week or so. There is a lot to be said for collective
purchase, as practised by allotments groups. The results can be
excellent.
Q: My ivy plant was doing really well in my sitting room. Then the
leaves started looking bleached, and dropped off. I have tried spraying
with insecticide to no avail. What has gone wrong?
A: From the symptoms, it sounds like an attack of red spider. Look
closely under the leaves and you may well see web-like growths. They're
caused by little spiders.
Looking very closely, you may see the pin-head size spiders. Look long
enough and you may see them moving. They are very resistant to
insecticides.
Persist with a product such as malathion. The trouble is the spiders
get protection from the webbing and there are overlapping generations.
My wife had to get rid of her ivy, as control proved so difficult.
Sorry to be so gloomy. Best of luck.
Q: A reader, much involved in hanging baskets for the Crieff In Leaf
project, has been asking about water conserving materials.
A: I assume that liners are used. In addition, there are several
water-retaining agents on the market. They are from Arthur Bowers,
Chempak, Erin, Fyba, Phostrogen, and Seramis.
I have not used them personally, but will do so this year. I am told
they are very effective, mixed in with compost.
Q: I planted some pansies last year. They did exceptionally well over
a long period. They are pretty straggly now. Is it worth keeping them?
A: Pansies are perennials, but can suffer in an average Scottish
winter. Nevertheless, there can be lots of life left. If trimmed back,
they can go on to great things.
It is pretty early, so I suggest you trim back and keep a close
look-out for new growth. If there is none, they have suffered root rot.

THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday welcomed a decision by Attorney
General Sir Nicholas Lyell to leave the group as an independent body.
SFO director, Mr George Staple, said the news ended the uncertainty
over its future.
The Government has spent two years considering the role of the SFO
after it was heavily criticised for its handling of several high-profile
cases.
However, Mr Staple said Sir Nicholas's decision ''points the way
towards more effective investigation and prosecution of serious and
complex fraud in the future''.
Mrs Barbara Mills, the Director of Public Prosecutions, also welcomed
the conclusions of the Davie report on fraud prosecution, which
recommended keeping the existing system.
''The Davie report recognises that both we and the SFO have important
roles to fulfil in combatting serious fraud,'' she said.
''I look forward to building further on the present arrangements and
to working more closely with the SFO so that we make the best possible
use of the expertise and the skills in each organisation.
''I am pleased that today's announcement ends a period of uncertainty
for all our staff.''
Sir Nicholas told the House of Commons in a statement that the role of
the police in SFO cases is to be ''clarified''.
The SFO, set up in 1988 to act as both investigator and prosecutor in
cases involving more than #5m, has come under heavy criticism.
Mr George Walker, the ex-boxer and former head of Brent Walker leisure
group, was acquitted last October of charges of conspiracy to falsify
accounts in a case which cost #5m.
In December, the Home Office asked the Appeal Court to review the
original Guinness convictions -- the SFO's first and still main success
to date.
However, Sir Nicholas said the criticism was ''often misguided'' and
reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the ''effective and efficient
prosecution of fraud at all levels''.
He added: ''In its seven years of existence to date, the SFO has
brought to trial 141 major cases involving 309 defendants of whom 191
have been convicted.''
More than 75% of cases brought to trial by the SFO had led to at least
one conviction, he said.

HERE'S something for the gardener who has everything -- a floral
clock, writes STEWART FRASER.
Not perhaps as large as the one in Edinburgh's Princes Street Gardens.
But this one comes with a choice of 3ft diameter hands -- antique or
modern -- and a two-year guarantee.
This is said to be the first one for domestic use. There is a ''safe,
low-voltage synchronous movement in a waterproof rust-free box'' and a
transformer links up with the mains.
Coloured stone can be used for numerals, or perennial plants, or
annual bedding to ring the changes, so to speak. The maker, Smith of
Derby, offers a skeleton dial as a further option.
A floral clock is a new venture for this old-established company.
Smith has been making clocks since 1856. It made St Paul's Cathedral
clock in 1893, the largest clock in the UK, and restored Salisbury
Cathedral clock, the oldest working original mechanical clock in the
world.
Price for the floral clock -- #495. Maybe you could buy it on tick?

THE 75-year-old SNP candidate jailed for seven days for refusing to
pay #150 road tax to an ''English Treasury'' was freed from Barlinnie
yesterday after serving only 25 hours of his sentence.
Mr William Gilmour of Cumbernauld -- who described himself as a
thistle in the flesh of the establishment -- said he had no regrets and
would do it all again, at a push.
Last night, as he reflected on his ''prison nightmare'', Mr Gilmour,
said he was none the wiser about why he had been freed so early.
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman explained that prisoners sentenced
to less than four years were automatically freed after serving half
their sentence. Thursday and Friday counted as two days for Mr Gilmour
and Saturday and Sunday were added because prisoners were not released
at the weekend. He said Mr Gilmour had in effect served four days by
Friday lunchtime and was therefore eligible for release.
Mr Gilmour, who is standing as the SNP candidate for Tannochside in
the new North Lanarkshire authority, surrendered himself to police in
Cumbernauld on Thursday.
He had written to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang offering to pay the tax
to a Scottish recipient but had been told by the Scottish Office that
the money was payable to the Exchequer.
This being the case, Mr Gilmour -- who maintains the Treaty of Union
is not legal -- refused to surrender the money along with his principles
and was handed over to the prison authorities at noon yesterday.
Last night, as he sipped a 'half and a half pint' -- a free man again
-- Mr Gilmour relived his ordeal. ''I felt that it was like some
nightmare. I kept telling myself this was not happening to me. You feel
with so many unknowns that you are like a pawn in a big game.''
He said that as he arrived at Barlinnie's forbidding portals he
''tried to put a brave face on it'' but couldn't say he had enjoyed the
experience. However he claimed he had been keen to see how the system
worked from the other side having visited Barlinnie before as a JP.
Mr Gilmour revealed the money for the road tax had been put to good
use. ''I have already sent #40 to charity. Eventually I will give it all
away and a bit more. I'm keen to emphasise that civil disobedience
should not be used to make a profit.''
He added that he had been upset by the SNP's cool response to his
stand. ''I'll live and die an SNP member but it is high time the party
realised that independence isn't going to come on a silver platter with
the blessing of Westminster.''
He promised to be out on the hustings soon in Tannochside. ''I hope
the people of Tannochside believe that I will fight tooth and nail for
them.''

WHILE I was washing the snow off my car the other day, a neighbour
rebuked me for suggesting that it was time to cut lawns, writes IAN
WALLS.
Yet a couple of days later I had to go over to the Carse of Gowrie
on business and found dry soil and lawns neatly trimmed in sparkling
sun.
Golfers know that they can leave a gloomy, wet, snowy Glasgow and be
happily playing at Gailes an hour or so later.
Weather is the deciding factor in all gardening activities. A bit of
protection can make all the difference, especially if you back it up
with some warmth.
I popped into the conservatory house in the Botanic Gardens the other
day. It was an absolute blaze of colour with orchids, bulbs, abutilons,
flowering sage, and many more.
Outside it was cold and bleak. It was a different world in the
conservatory. This is why these buildings are booming at the moment.
A greenhouse is an excellent gardening tool, but not linked so
conveniently to the house. That little walk outside can be remarkably
off-putting, especially if you still have your slippers on.
Without doubt we are heading for a late spring. You can speed things
along a bit with a minimum of heating. The days are warming up nicely.

ERIC CANTONA was told yesterday that he did not have to go to prison
for his flying kung-fu attack on a football supporter. Instead he will
have to spend time passing on his football skills to the young and
deprived.
An order that he spend 120 hours in community service instead of two
weeks in prison was readily accepted by Manchester United's French
player.
The appeal court judge, sitting with two magistrates in Croydon Crown
Court, had said that the provocation leading to the assault had been
such that even the most stoic might have reacted. ''We believe that Mr
Cantona acted out of character,'' said Judge Ian Davies.
With a Gallic shrug of his shoulders the player replied ''of course''
when asked if he was prepared to take on coaching duties in the
Manchester community.
Manchester United fans in court were in tears when the prison sentence
was quashed. As the player left the dock he was hugged. Some grabbed his
hand and kissed it. Outside the court they chanted: ''Eric is free, long
live the king.''
However, following the original 14-day sentence passed by Croydon
magistrates last week and its substitution yesterday by the community
service order, it was made clear that Cantona was now considering
whether his future career should continue in England.
Last week the magistrates court was told he wanted to end his playing
days with Manchester United. Yesterday his French lawyer said that since
sentence was passed Mr Cantona was now re-considering.
His legal representatives spoke of the anguish and suffering that had
been caused both to him and his family. His wife Isabelle is expecting
their second child in June.
His only response to the day's events, and indeed those weeks since
the assault took place, was: ''When seagulls follow a trawler, it is
because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.'' He repeated
it in French and that was that.
''What did it mean? Was this something from Sartre?'' bemused
journalists asked, desperate to understand the significance. ''No it was
Eric's own words,'' they were told. ''It is how he would like to express
his feelings.'' Even his legal advisers were not prepared to interpret
his words.
Earlier court officials had done their best to enable as many press
and members of the public as possible into the tiny court. Such was the
attendance when proceedings began it is unlikely that they could have
managed to squeeze in even a sardine.
One 13 year-old Manchester United fan, who had left home at 5.30 am to
be present, passed the player a sealed greetings card over the glass
enclosed dock. It was a plea that Cantona should stay with Manchester
United amid rumours that he might take up a multi-million offer to leave
the club.
The card had been signed by Sebastian Pennells and his mother.
Sebastian had added a poem. It read:
''Eric is an idol. Eric is a star.
''If my mother had her way, he would also be my pa.''
Wearing a Manchester United football strip bearing Cantona's No 7,
with the word ''God'' above, Sebastian said: ''You can believe it, I
would the first to enrol to be coached by him.''
Judge Ian Davies told Cantona that in his view a custodial sentence
need not have been passed for the common assault charge he admitted.
The player's barrister, Mr David Poole QC, had argued the sentence was
''flawed'' because the Croydon magistrate who passed it last week made
clear he was being imprisoned for his ''high profile'' and because of
the way young people looked up to him. Mr Poole told the judge his
''remorseful'' client should be treated like any normal person.
The incident took place when United played Crystal Palace at Selhurst
Park. The fan involved is due to appear before magistrates on charges
arising out of the incident.
The judge said the defence counsel had declared, with some force, that
whatever the defendant's status he was entitled to be dealt with for the
gravity of the offence committed and not be sentenced to make an example
of a public figure.
He added: ''We express the hope that he will be able to be used in
carrying out his public duty to the community by helping young people
who aspire to be professional footballers . . . and others who merely
aspire to play the game and enjoy it.''
The judge said that young boys, and indeed in this day young girls,
might benefit from his skills.

Nina Noone visits an exhibition of some rare and unusual items that
have been...
MADE IN
SCOTLAND
ESSENTIALS, the name given to an exhibition at the Roger Billcliffe
Gallery at 134 Blythswood Street, Glasgow until April 26, brings
together some of the work of leading designers working in Scotland in
diverse disciplines, and provides the rare opportunity to see their
products, which are usually made to private commission, unseen by the
public.
''Made to be used'' is the theme, and exhibits include furniture,
tableware, ceramics, pieces made from forged steel and silverware. Here
we introduce some of the designers taking part, with examples of their
work . . .
* JOSE P ARRIAGA comes from northern Spain's Basque country, where his
family has a tradition of wood carving.
Working now in Edinburgh, he aims to blend within his furniture design
the culture of the contemporary world while retaining the spirit of his
Basque ancestral craftsmanship. Predominant among his designs is the
juxtapositioning of glass and wood, and his use of modern materials such
as glass and steel embraces contrast in their individual qualities with
textural differences.
Arriaga's pieces -- as demonstrated above with his chest of drawers
and an elaborately-carved chest top -- are remarkably diverse in design
terms, ranging from ornate carvings that echo traditional skills to
minimalistic concepts of simple elegance.
* HELEN MARRIOT, shown right with her fine silver bowl, studied at the
Glasgow School of Art and the Royal College of Art. At the latter she
scooped a prize in the Goddard's Silver Design competition, receiving
commendation too in the Goldsmith's Art Council competition. The
Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths bought a piece of her work for its
permanent collection, and she was commissioned to design two pieces of
silver for presentation by Lord Forte to the city of Glasgow.
* JOHN CREED (above), a part-time lecturer at Glasgow School of Art,
has a long and distinguished pedigree as a metalsmith. Major commissions
have included a chalice and ciborium for the Pope's visit to Glasgow, a
set of commemorative goblets for the Perth centenary of the
Incorporation of Goldsmiths in Edinburgh, to name just two. He has also
worked for the Princess Royal. Creed has his own forge near Glasgow,
where he creates highly innovative designs which can be appealingly
eccentric.
Here he shows his forged steel coat and hatstand and his updated
version of that country house essential, the dinner gong.

SCOTRAIL is planning to run trains late at night on a stretch of track
only a few hundred yards long and list them as passenger services in
order to avoid legal action that could save the West Highland sleeper.
Using a ploy described by a ScotRail insider as ''immoral but
perfectly legal'', managers have amended the timetable to create a
service between Maryhill and Bishopriggs.
Last night, Opposition MPs condemned the move as a ''dirty trick'' and
''chicanery'' and promised to raise the matter in the Commons next week.
The new service will run once a day, after 11pm, and is not expected
to carry any passengers. However, it will save ScotRail from potential
embarrassment in the courts by ensuring that a short link known as the
Cowlairs chord remains legally in use.
The sleeper from London to Fort William, which ceases running from May
28, is the only passenger service currently using the Cowlairs chord.
Under the terms of the 1993 Railways Act, removing passenger services
from a line amounts to closure.
By law, a closure must be subjected to a detailed, lengthy, and far
tougher consultation procedure than that which applied before the Act.
Campaigners in Rannoch have commissioned a legal opinion which
suggests the West Highland sleeper could be saved by judicial review in
the High Court, using ScotRail's failure to apply closure procedures on
the Cowlairs chord and on a section between Greenhill and Cumbernauld
also used by the sleeper.
However, ScotRail believes it has avoided the legal pitfall by
creating a new passenger service using a train being repositioned for
the next day's services. It will run the short distance from Maryhill to
Bishopriggs, before returning from Bishopriggs to Queen Street Station
as empty stock.
ScotRail sources concede privately that because the service will run
on weekdays after 11pm, it is unlikely to carry passengers. A source
admitted: ''If we timetable over that section of track that's our
business. We are doing it because we can, and to stop it going through
the closure process.''
According to the legal opinion: ''ScotRail has not conducted any
passenger surveys to discover whether there is any passenger demand for
a one-way, once-daily, late-night, non-peak-hour service between two
suburbs of Glasgow not at present connected by passenger services.''
Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP Charles Kennedy yesterday promised to table
a series of Commons questions next week on what he described as
ScotRail's ''chicanery''.
He said: ''ScotRail are guilty of a procedural putsch designed to deny
proper public consultation.''
Labour Trade and Industry spokesman Brian Wilson spoke of dirty
tricks, adding: ''It's a pathetic negation of supposed safe-guards that
this kind of trick can be played.''
A ScotRail spokesperson said: ''ScotRail does not view the legality of
the decision as being in any doubt. It is our responsibility to
timetable routes and services. As far as we are concerned there's no
hidden agenda to surreptitiously close routes.''
However, in the opinion, a copy of which has been passed to Transport
Secretary Brian Mawhinney, a ScotRail spokesman is quoted as saying:
''If you do not run a passenger train over a line, that is a line
closure. ScotRail is not in the business of closing down lines. If we do
not want to close down lines we have to run trains over them, and the
Maryhill-Bishopriggs service is the train we have decied to run.''
The opinion claims a judicial review of British Rail's decision to
suspend the sleeper services -- allegedly because they are sparsely used
and require too much public subsidy to run -- would have a
''reasonable'' chance of success.
Meanwhile, in a written Commons answer to a question from Liberal
Democrat MP Sir Russell Johnston, Transport Minister John Watts revealed
the number of passenger journeys made on the sleeper in 1993-94 was
14,600, the same figure as the year before, but up from 13,500 in
1991-92.
He also released figures which appeared to contradict BR's claim the
service is rarely used -- last year the Fort William sleeper ran at 50%
capacity during the winter and 60% capacity during the summer.

<TEXT>
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd last night vigorously defended
Britain's diplomatic service -- insisting the country was not going to
be represented in a ''shoddy or second-rate'' way.
His words came as Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken is
understood to believe that too much is spent on providing luxuries for
ambassadors and their staff.
But in a speech to the Conservative Central Council conference in
Birmingham, Mr Hurd insisted: ''Modernising does not mean giving up the
few historic buildings we own, and retreating to suburban villas.''
Mr Aitken is said to have told friends: ''We spend more than #1
billion on our embassies and diplomats, yet less than #100m of that goes
on the direct promotion of British exports.''
Mr Aitken's words were interpreted as heralding a savage battle
between two leading Government departments in this year's public
spending round.
As chief secretary, Mr Aitken is in charge of Government spending and
the search for cuts.
Mr Hurd said yesterday the diplomatic service was an asset which was
constantly being adapted to keep it up to date.
''We have been cutting the tail to enhance the teeth,'' he said. ''We
have been exploiting new technology to cut back 500 jobs at home so that
we can send 100 extra commercial officers overseas.
''We are not pretending to be grander than we are, but I do not intend
our country to be represented in a shoddy or second-rate way.
''I have never myself been interested in a policy of prestige, the
waving of flags, the coining of pretentious phrases, the summoning of
empty conferences.
''That is not what foreign policy is about.
''Foreign policy is the servant of the nation's effort and that effort
... ranges far beyond the work of Government; it requires clear aims,
well-defined assets, the energy to use those assets to the full.''
The end of the Cold War has seen the birth of 22 new states in which
Britain has 16 missions, most recently Sarajevo. The FO has 215 overseas
posts.
But a Foreign Office annual spending report this month revealed that
the British Embassy in Paris alone -- one of the most expensive to run
-- costs taxpayers nearly #17m a year.

A CHAIR designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for Glasgow's Argyle
Street tearooms nearly 100 years ago is to go overseas after fetching
#210,500 at a London auction yesterday.
The distinctive dark-stained oak chair was among a set of furniture
that Mackintosh was commissioned to design for the tearooms by owner
Catherine Cranston in 1896.
Mackintosh had already been involved with Miss Cranston's Buchanan
Street premises but at Argyle Street he was given free rein to allow his
style to blossom.
Surviving Argyle Street chairs are described by experts as
''exceedingly rare''.
Yesterday's example at Sotheby's was bought by a private overseas
collector for more than twice the pre-sale upper estimate.
* A glass bowl brought to a London auction house, wrapped in
newspaper, by an anonymous Highland couple, has been identified as a
rarity which is expected to fetch up to #200,000.
Bonhams experts identified the bowl, in cobalt blue and opaque white
marbled ''mosaic'' ribbed glass, which measures 6[1/2] inches across and
4[1/2] inches high, as a rare example of the Roman glassmaker's skills,
made between the first centuries BC and AD, probably in Rome itself.

At London's
Ideal Home
Exhibition,
Geraldine
looks at how
we've lived
down through
the years
IF you have not yet managed a trip to London to visit the Ideal Home
Exhibition, then you have just over a week to see what must go down as
the biggest, and arguably the most ambitious, show to date.
One outstanding exhibit is the Bellway Homes Show House Village of
four houses built in 11 days, each one sponsored by a different company,
and another, the central feature of the exhibition, is a terrace of five
homes, each with its own unique story to tell.
At first glance ''Yesterday's Houses, Tomorrow's Homes'', again built
by Bellway Homes, might give the impression that it is yet another
indulgence of the national pastime of looking back through rose-tinted
glasses.
Not so. The construction of four replica houses representing 1908 (the
year of the first ever Ideal Home Exhibition), 1926, 1944, and 1967,
while undoubtedly making people feel nostalgic about those times, will
also act as a reminder of the problems that can occur with an older type
of building. A fifth, fully-built modern house has also been built as a
contrast.
The four period houses have been decorated, styled, and furnished as
they would have been when they were originally built, and the story of
what life might have been like is told through a commentary by four
generations of an imaginary family.
Looking around the four main rooms of the Edwardian home the first
impression is of elegance and comfort, with gas lamps and open coal
fires, yet on closer scrutiny the draughts, the limited hot water, the
unheated rooms, the frozen, cast-iron gutters and the window frames with
their peeling paint, tell the full story.
Eighteen years on, 1926, the year of the General Strike, and a
gramophone plays the Charleston. Despite some definite signs of
modernisation, like electric lighting, a gas cooker, and a solid fuel
boiler, this home has very different problems. The forms of heating are
expensive to run, there is condensation and rust everywhere.
In the 1944 house there is new modern furniture including a drinks
cabinet, but the austerity of the war years is reflected in heat loss,
draughts, and damp.
By the mid sixties, lifestyles had improved tremendously, and the mod
cons that the Americans had already been enjoying for a decade arrived
in Britain. This was the era of plastic, with a vinyl mini-bar and
Fablon-covered work surfaces. Central heating systems, fitted kitchens,
washing machines, and refrigerators were becoming standard. The flip
side is that the 1967 house also has condensation, a flat garage roof
that leaks and there is the inconvenience of having no separate
bathroom/toilet.
Having walked through the houses spanning six decades, visitors then
move on to the home of today, a country-style show home designed by
Bellway's North London Division team. With the interior decorated and
styled by British Home Stores, this steel-framed house is
energy-efficient, safe and secure, and very comfortable.
The modern home has incorporated the kind of features that will be a
standard requisite in the home of the future. So energy efficient is it
that a week's heating and hot water costs around the same as a 4oz jar
of freeze-dried coffee, thanks to good insulation, double glazing,
low-emissivity glass.
The increase of chronic allergy conditions resulting from impurities
in the air has also been dealt with through a heat pump ventilation unit
(HPVU) which has a built-in heat recovery system. Added to this is a
solar heating system which supplies the home with hot water for 230 days
of the year.

THE BBC last night stood firm against Opposition pressure and refused
to alter or cancel Monday's Panorama interview with the Prime Minister,
increasing the likelihood of a legal challenge to the screening of the
programme.
Labour insists that the interview with the Prime Minister violates the
corporation's commitment to impartiality during the Scottish local
election campaign.
The party has received legal advice which suggests that the BBC is
liable to judicial review for breach of its statutory responsibilty to
provide balanced coverage during election campaigns.
Labour in London said they had taken legal advice which cast doubt on
the compliance of the programme with the BBC's own internal guidelines,
while the SNP will meet its lawyers tomorrow to decide what step to take
next.
An application by the SNP for interim interdict at the Court of
Session on Monday to block the transmission, at least north of the
Border, remains a possibility. Another threat is an application by
Labour for a judicial review.
SNP chief executive Mr Michael Russell said last night: ''I understand
from an internal BBC source that the Panorama producers did not even
know until the middle of last week that there were elections in Scotland
next Thursday. That speaks volumes for the so-called world-beating
standards of the team.
''Having belatedly discovered the gaffe that one of their flagship
programmes had made in attempting to broadcast a full interview with the
Tory Party leader just three days before Scotland went to the polls, the
BBC management decided on a flagrant cover-up, as clearly proved by the
leaked memo from Nick Robinson to other senior BBC executives.''
Mr Russell added that time was running out for a negotiated settlement
and warned the BBC that it faced an irreversible collapse in public
confidence if it demonstrated that it could not be trusted to respect
and protect democracy.
Westminster reverberated with rumours last night that Mr Robinson was
leaving his post as deputy editor of Panorma, but the BBC issued a
statement saying that his secondment this summer as a political
correspondent had been arranged some time ago. It was also said to be
temporary and that he would retain his Panorama post.
In a tense exchange of letters between Labour leader Mr Tony Blair's
office and the BBC, Labour called on the corporation either to withdraw
the programme or allow leaders of the three opposition parties in
Scotland to appear on it with Mr Major.
Mr Alistair Campbell, Mr Blair's press secretary, yesterday wrote
twice to BBC head of news Mr Tony Hall, demanding that urgent action be
taken and insisting that the BBC apply its guidelines.
Under the heading ''Balance of Coverage,'' the Producers' Guidelines
state: ''In accordance with this principle the BBC undertakes to
maintain balance, over the period of a campaign, in its recorded
actuality of political speeches and film, videotape, and studio
contributions from politicians.''
It adds: ''Editors must also be aware that the voices of the
Nationalist parties fighting in Scotland and Wales should be represented
in UK coverage.''
The BBC claims that it will provide balanced coverage through all its
programmes during the Scottish local election campaign.
A spokeswoman for Panorama said: ''Our coverage across all programmes
will be balanced throughout the election.''
But the guidelines, under the heading ''Impartiality,'' also state:
''It is not sufficient to claim that other unconnected programmes or
media will ensure that balancing views will be heard.''

GARDENS can look pretty poor at this time of year. But, in case you
had forgotten, spring is officially here. Soon it should all be
happening, writes IAN WALLS.
There are shrubs appearing such as pieris, flowering currant,
rhododendron, and jasmine, ably supported by crocus and daffodils. Lawns
will be losing their drab look. Cutting soon is a must.
Moss is emerging too. Green and luscious. The earlier you treat it the
better, but hold back until it is a bit warmer.
Time is going by if you are intent on producing your own bedding
plants or tomatoes. You need warmth for them but not for vegetables to
plant out.
If you intend growing early potatoes it is time to get them sprouting.
You can do this in a light, dry place where frost does not penetrate. I
am sticking to Home Guard.
For those who are keen on a range of hardy annuals, get the ground
into condition for sowing around Easter.
It takes a lot to beat some gritty sand worked into heavy, sticky
soil. You get an instant effect.
Ground that was terrible can be transformed into something easily
worked.
To be safe and sure, you can sow hardy annuals in pots in a cool
greenhouse in the first or second week of April. Remember to label
everything clearly.
Something else to do is look out hanging baskets. You can get waste
wool material for lining them.
I think I'll give it a try this year.

A RECENT survey by Gardening Which? of 22,000 people showed 14% had
been victims of crime or vandalism in the past two years.
Believe it or not, the top item to be stolen was plants at 24%. Tools
were 19%; containers 8%; fences 18%; and sheds 9%. Less than half of the
victims reported losses to the police. Only a quarter told their
insurance companies.
Only two-thirds were happy with the way things were handled by police
or insurance. Recovery rates were extremely low.
Allotments seem to be prone to thefts and to vandalism. Items can be
stolen easily and sold to gullible customers.
There are measures you can take. Lock up valuable tools. Use security
lighting. Put gravel on paths, to make a noise. Use prickly barrier
hedges. Code tools, or even paint them in a recognisable colour.
Many items can be bolted down. You can buy tree anchors. If you have
specially valuable items you should really list them on your insurance.
Most of all, try not to tempt thieves. They need little encouragement.

A UNIQUE stained glass window stolen from one of Glasgow's most
prominent buildings almost a decade ago has been traced to the United
States.
For 65 years generations of Glaswegians danced beneath the famous
Gondola window in the ballroom of the Ca' d'Oro at the corner of Gordon
Street and Union Street until 1986, when the window and 26 other
important pieces disappeared without trace during restoration work on
the building.
The owners, the Co-operative Insurance Society, believed the stained
glass had been lost forever and commissioned an artist to make a replica
of the Gondola. The total cost of replacing all the windows was believed
to be around #100,000.
Then last month the artist who designed the replacement spotted by
chance a photograph of the original in Period House and Garden magazine.
The photograph was taken in England. The police were alerted and after
an investigation it was discovered the Gondola had subsequently been
sold to an art dealer in New Jersey.
Despite the discovery, there are doubts whether it will ever be
brought back to this country. The CIS has said it is willing to donate
the Gondola to Glasgow's museums should it come back into its hands but
it is not clear who, if anyone, will attempt to reclaim it.
Mr Steve Chatterton, CIS new development project manager, called in
the police after the magazine article was brought to his attention. He
confirmed that the glass could be donated to Glasgow's museums but
thought it unlikely the insurance company would take action to recover
it.
''I'm speaking personally, but if we were involved with legal costs in
the US, I just couldn't see us doing that.''
His opinion was echoed by Mr Michael Donnelly, author of a recent book
on Glasgow's glass. ''I feel it may be very difficult to actually
reclaim it legally. Somebody may have to purchase it.''
However, Mr Donnelly said the Ca' d'Oro glass, designed by Charles
Payne in the early 1920s, was sufficiently important to warrant attempts
being made to bring it home.
Mr David Collin, a director of Glasgow architects SBT Keppie, said the
artist in turn notified him. ''She had designed and manufactured the
replacement from photographs. Then some time later she saw the original
Gondola in a magazine.''
Mr Collin was working on the refurbishment of the Ca' d'Oro when the
windows were removed in an operation which, it is believed, could have
taken days. ''We were thunderstruck, very very shocked that it had
happened. We informed the police immediately as did the owners.''
Mr Vince Taggart, of Glasgow's museums and art galleries, said: ''We
would be interested in acquiring the stained glass.''
Police investigations are continuing into the matter and a report has
been submitted to the procurator-fiscal in Glasgow.
