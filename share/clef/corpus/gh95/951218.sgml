FROM tots to teens, the talent of tomorrow. In all honesty, very few
qualifications have to be applied to the young musicians of the Junior Academy
Orchestra of the RSAMD, which gave two performances of its annual Christmas
concert on Saturday.
When reviewing a performance by youngsters, a critic normally goes along armed
with the language of diplomacy. As these kids played Shostakovich's Festival
Overture, the thesaurus went back on the shelf. Big, brassy, and bronzed, the
overture was launched with a full-blooded quality that oozed confidence. As the
``big tune'' was unfolded on cellos, then passed to the violins, the whole
thing shone with a full, assured tone.
Perhaps the only concession the veteran and venerable James Durrant,
conducting, made to the young 'uns was in keeping the pace very steady and
marginally below its normally hectic velocity. Fair enough.
In Corelli's Christmas Concerto and Britten's Matinee Musicales there were
moments where the music was less certain in its direction, though each grew in
confidence. And no lack of confidence either from the Junior Academy Choir,
strong-voiced in Vaughan Williams's charming and clever Fantasy on Christmas
Carols, which featured student baritone Robin Greenway in sonorous form.
And they don't come more sonorous than Bill McCue, who - with talented young
tuba player, Thomas Walker - featured in Paul Kleinsinger's lovely piece of
musical nonsense, Tubby the Tuba, which, behind its cartoon qualities and
childlike appeal, is actually a brilliant piece of orchestral characterisation,
impressively handled by this well-trained army of young musicians.

TWO people died and four others, including two schoolchildren, were seriously
injured in road accidents across Central Scotland at the weekend.
A 28-year-old man was killed in a collision involving a car and a lorry on
Stirling Road, Airdrie, yesterday.
Mr Dennis McLafferty, of Kirkton Crescent, Carnbroe, was a passenger in a
Vauxhall Astra.
The car driver, Mr Simon Hughes, 19, of Montgomery Avenue, Coatbridge, and
another passenger, Mr Raymond Watson, 23, of Lilybank Avenue, Coatbridge, were
taken to Monklands Hospital.
They have both been detained with serious head and leg injuries. The
50-year-old lorry driver was released after treatment.
The road was closed for four hours. A report is to be submitted to the
procurator-fiscal.
Mr Kevin Sweeney, 27, from Wishaw, died after was struck by a car on the B7015
road near Fauldhouse, West Lothian, on Saturday.
Two schoolchildren were seriously injured when they were knocked down by cars
in separate incidents in the Lothians.
A nine-year old girl is ``critical'' in hospital after being struck while
crossing Bathgate Road, Blackburn, on Saturday.
The girl, who has not been named by police, was taken first to St John's
Hospital, Livingston, and later transferred to Western General Hospital,
Edinburgh.
In East Lothian, an eight-year-old boy was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary
after being knocked down crossing Salters Road, Wallyford, on Saturday
afternoon.
He was transferred to the city's Royal Hospital for Sick Children, where his
condition is described as critical.
In England, a motorist and a policeman travelling in a marked patrol car were
killed early yesterday when their cars collided during a police chase in
Oldbury, West Midlands.
The Police Complaints Authority is investigating the crash which killed Mr Neil
Homer, in his 20s, from Oldbury, and police constable Robert Dallow, 41.

POLICE forces in England and Wales this week will follow the example of
Strathclyde Police and stage an amnesty in an attempt to reduce the number of
knives on Britain's streets.
The initiative follows the murder of headmaster Philip Lawrence outside his
school in London 10 days ago as he tried to protect a pupil from an attacker.
All 43 English and Welsh forces will, from Wednesday, allow people to dump
knives or similar weapons in special bins at police stations without being
asked questions.
The amnesty, which runs until January 20, has been arranged by chief constables
and is backed by Home Secretary Michael Howard.
It was welcomed last night by the Association of Chief Police Officers. Its
spokeswoman, Assistant Chief Constable Maria Wallis of Sussex Police, said:
``There has been overwhelming support from forces for such a campaign at this
time.''
Referring to initiatives such as Strathclyde's Operation Blade, she added:
``Experience from previous campaigns has shown how effective these can be.''
Mr Lawrence's widow, Frances, said she and her four children were
``bewildered'' that such weapons were so freely available.
In February 1993, Strathclyde's Chief Constable Leslie Sharp launched a similar
``surrender programme'' as the first phase of Operation Blade. It brought in
almost 5000 knives or blades in one month.
The amnesty was followed by an intensive stop-and-search campaign, with 30,000
people questioned in a two-month period. Around 600 were found to be carrying
knives or similar weapons.
Operation Blade was seen as being responsible for a marked reduction in knife
attacks in the region.
This weekend, Strathclyde Police searched 5600 people in an unannounced 12-hour
anti-knife campaign, which finished at 7am on Saturday.
Officers recovered 43 weapons, and 43 people face possible prosecution. Reports
are being sent to the procurator-fiscal.

EXPLORER Roger Mear has been forced to abandon his solo walk across Antarctica
after vital equipment failed, his team said yesterday.
Mr Mear, 45, set off last month aiming to become the first person to walk alone
and unsupported across 1700 miles of the icy continent. He was racing against a
rival contender, 33-year-old Borge Ousland from Norway.
Mr Mear was raising funds for the Wilderness Trust, an Eastbourne-based charity
dedicated to the world's remaining wild landscapes.
He is an experienced explorer who has travelled to Antarctica five times before.
For his latest expedition, Mr Mear was pulling 450lbs of food and equipment
with the help of a parawing, a kite that enabled him to travel up to 70 miles a
day.
However, travelling solo meant he was able to carry only a simple transmitter
to convey his condition and position.
Expedition team member Diana Nielson, of the Wilderness Trust, said yesterday:
``We had a message from Roger at midday yesterday saying: `I have an emergency,
please get me out.'
``All we had was his position. Luckily the weather wasn't too bad so a Twin
Otter aircraft with guides and a doctor could land nearby and rescue him. If he
had not been found within a few hours he would have been in a life-threatening
condition.''
The explorer is expected to arrive in Chile within the next few hours and will
return to his Derbyshire home for Christmas.
Fellow explorer Charlie Burton, who crossed Antarctica with Sir Ranulph
Fiennes, said Mr Mear's principal emotion would be one of disappointment. ``It
is always very disappointing to fail, and especially so when it is equipment,
because you choose the equipment and have to rely on it, but if you are
travelling solo there is absolutely nothing you can do when it packs up. ''
Nothing is yet known about the position of Mr Mear's rival, Borge Ousland.

Vienna
CHANCELLOR Franz Vranitzky's Social Democrats scored a victory in Austria's
snap elections today as voters, frightened by the possibility of the far right
coming to power, sought refuge in the leftist fold.
Vranitzky's party won 38.3% of the vote, reversing a 16-year downward trend and
rebounding from its worst-ever result suffered in the last election in October
1994, the Interior Ministry's unofficial results showed.
A robust showing by his opponents could mean drawn-out coalition talks are on
the cards before a new government can be formed.
``I am happy,'' Vranitzky told reporters. ``This is a very comfortable and
successful hour.''
The conservative People's Party (OeVP), which quit the coalition government
with Vranitzky's Social Democrats in October after a bitter row over next
year's budget, gained less than one percent to 28.3%.
Analysts said voters, angry at having been called to the polls three years
ahead of schedule, refrained from backing the conservatives, put off by their
proposals for deep cuts in Austria's generous welfare system to help cut the
deficit.
Austria's budget shortfall is estimated to top 120 billion schillings ($12bn)
this year. Failure to agree on a 1996 budget led to the collapse of the
SPOe-OeVP coalition in October just a year after the last General Election.
The far right Freedom Party (FPOe), whom many had billed as the wild card in
this year's elections, suffered its first electoral blow since Joerg Haider
became leader in 1986 and remained third with 22.08%.
The result was a setback for OeVP leader Wolfgang Schuessel, the Foreign
Minister, who had campaigned to oust the Social Democrats as Austria's biggest
party. ``I clearly admit I did not achieve my election goal,'' Schuessel told
reporters.
The OeVP and FPOe could still join forces to form a centre-right coalition.

A SENIOR official with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service
yesterday expressed surprise at a health union claim that staff had learned of
rationalisation plans for the service through their monthly pay packets.
The health union, Unison, claimed that staff learned of a timetable and
implementation date for changes in a newsletter contained in their December pay
packets, ahead of formal talks between management and unions.
The newsletter also outlined proposals to reduce the number of blood grouping
testing sites from five to two, a restructuring of management, and changes in
funding for the service, the union claimed.
Mr Jim Devine, Scottish health officer with Unison, said: ``We are very
concerned that the Scottish Blood Transfusion Service may be following its
counterparts from south of the Border who recently announced a major closure
and reorganisation programme in order to save #10m.
``The staff of the Scottish Blood Transfusion Service and the public in
Scotland need to be reassured that a cost-cutting exercise is not being
implemented by management through the back door.''
However, Mrs Mairi Thornton, SNBTS national donor services manager, expressed
surprise at Unison's concerns, insisting that unions and 1200 staff had been
kept up to date with the review, which she said had been under way for about 18
months.

BRITISH forces are ready for Nato's peace-enforcing mission in Bosnia despite
blizzards, fog, and ice hampering a deployment of US forces.
``The snow slowed things down but we have caught up and are moving forward.
There is no delay,'' said Colonel Barry Hawgood in Gornji Vakuf, the central
Bosnian town which serves as the British sector's headquarters.
The British, privately relishing their swifter progress with friendly rivalry,
have two great advantages over the Americans, behind whom they form the biggest
contingent in the Implementation Force (Ifor) which starts work on Wednesday.
Firstly, two-fifths of the 13,000 troops the Government has committed to
enforce the Dayton peace accord are already in Bosnia where they served as UN
peacekeepers.
All they have had to do is to paint their white UN vehicles green and brown and
dust off regimental berets, which they will don instead of their blue UN ones
on D-Day, or deployment day, set for Wednesday.
Secondly, the 8000 extra troops, tanks, and heavy weapons which are due to pour
into British-controlled western Bosnia in the next few weeks will be coming by
land, not air.
The worst winter for years has stopped US combat troops from flying into Tuzla
in northern Bosnia, despite mounds of hi-tech equipment brought in to make the
airbase weatherproof.
Blizzards and fog have also made roads treacherous but all main routes the
British will use to enter Bosnia from the Croatian Adriatic port of Split have
been made passable.
Heavy weaponry, including 26 Challenger tanks, will soon be on their way.
On Wednesday, Major-General Mike Jackson, Britain's toughest-looking general
according to The Times, will assume command of Multi-national Division
South-West. The Americans and French will control two other sectors.
Dutch, Canadian, Czech, Polish, and Pakistani soldiers will be among the forces
under Jackson's control.
British soldiers serving as UN peacekeepers have been briefed on their tougher
mandate as Nato peace-enforcers.
``Stop, Ifor - or I shoot,'' was the new slogan they were learning for dealing
with suspicious characters.
With newly arrived Ifor logistics units, British soldiers have also set up
forward bases in a 1000.sq.mile area whose transfer from Croat to Serb control,
agreed in the peace accord, they will oversee.
Most of the British sector belongs to Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation but also
contains the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka, where a British liaison team has
set up base in a hotel.
Brigadier Richard Dannatt, commander of the 4th Armoured Brigade which is to
provide the bulk of the British Nato force, has been there to meet local
Serbian commanders who assured him of their full co-operation when the full
deployment comes.
However Dannatt's spokesman stressed no meetings were planned with General
Ratko Mladic, the head of the Bosnian Serb army who is wanted by a UN tribunal
for alleged war crimes. -Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Family moves to cool temperature after Brixton riot</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE family of the man whose death in custody sparked last week's Brixton riot
distanced themselves yesterday from the former barrister who told protesters
that the police were ``killers''.
The comments were made as Mr Rudy Narayan, 57, criticised police at a gathering
outside Brixton police station to mark the death of suspected burglar Wayne
Douglas, 25.
However, the dead man's brother Albert Douglas, 38, of Battersea, London, said
last night: ``That may be his opinion but it is not mine. I have nothing to do
with it.''
His sister Lisa, 23, of Brixton, said: ``This sort of thing does not help.''
Police believe the speech by Mr Narayan helped spark the trouble but they
insist the violence was caused by a minority of hooligans and did not reflect
the racial tension which saw the south London community twice erupt in flames
in the 1980s. Mr Narayan has denied he had incited the violence or circulated
leaflets aimed at whipping up aggression against the police.
``They incited the violence. They are the small hooligan element and they
incited the violence in Brixton,'' he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on
Saturday.
``They are the killers in the minds of the black community of south London. We
believe, honestly, that they murdered that boy in the police station.''
Police Superintendent Peter Clarke, responsible for the Brixton area, said the
community was firmly behind attempts to maintain law and order.
q Police constable John Tisshaw, 39, whose shoulder was broken in the
disturbances, is recovering at his home in Kent after being discharged from
hospital.

BBC war correspondent Kate Adie was being flown home from Sarajevo yesterday,
after breaking her ankle in the war-ravaged Bosnian city.
The 49-year-old reporter, a pioneer for women reporting from the front line,
was due to arrive at RAF Lyneham, Wiltshire, yesterday, on an air ambulance.
She will then be transferred to a Nottingham hospital for surgery on her
damaged leg.
Ironically, the veteran war correspondent - who has dodged bullets in Tiananmen
Square and braved bombs in Bosnia - slipped on ice as she was walking in
Sarajevo and fractured her ankle.
Miss Adie had been on her present assignment in Bosnia for just a few weeks but
has covered events in the former Yugoslavia since the war began four years ago.
A BBC spokeswoman said: ``It does seem like a fairly serious fracture and she
is being flown back by the RAF.''
Miss Adie made her name covering stories like the student uprising in Tiananmen
Square, where her arm was grazed by a bullet as the Chinese authorities
brutally broke up the protest.
She first came to the attention of the public when she covered live the ending
of the Iranian Embassy siege in west London, when a team of SAS men burst into
the building to rescue hostages.
Among those released was a BBC colleague who had been caught in the building.
For the last 15 years, Miss Adie, who was awarded the OBE in 1992, has been a
regular broadcaster from trouble spots all over the world.

Wellington
MAORI descendants of massacre victims of British explorer James Cook's first
contact with New Zealand natives 226 years ago have agreed to allow a replica
of his ship, The Endeavour, to visit their area.
Tribal elders gave their blessing to the visit at a special weekend meeting of
the tribe, which in 1769 had at least three warriors shot and three taken
hostage by a landing party from Cook's vessel at Gisborne, on the east coast of
North Island.
Endeavour Foundation chairman and replica skipper John Longley was formally
welcomed to the meeting ground and took part in the discussions.
He said he was thrilled the ship would visit the area with the blessing of the
whole community.
Members of the Turanganui-a-Kiwa Iwi (tribe) had threatened to disrupt the
visit because of the 226-year-old grievance.
It resulted from a vigorous Maori haka, or war dance, challenge to the 1769
British visitors, travelling in a sailing ship never before seen by the native
inhabitants.
For Cook and his crew it was their first encounter with the Maori inhabitants
of the newly-found land.
Gisborne tribal elders are to seek a formal apology and recompense from the
Queen and the British Government for the killing of their ancestors by Cook's
landing party, led by botanist Joseph Banks.
The tribe also wants recognition from the New Zealand Government of the
incident, together with a public education programme about the deaths, and
commemoration of them.
The replica of the Endeavour will visit Gisborne next month as part of a tour
of New Zealand ports.
Cook sighted New Zealand's North Island in 1769 and made numerous landings in
the Endeavour in 1769 and 1770 on his first Pacific voyage of discovery.
He was enlightened for this time, and generally had good relations with the
Maori and other Pacific islanders, though he was killed by Hawaiian islanders
in 1779.-AP.

EVERYONE wants to return to the atmosphere of their good dreams. Hanging on my
living room wall is a circular hoop of leather with a kind of cat's cradle or
spider's web in twine across it and which has a hole in the middle. At the foot
of the loop and hanging from the hole is a small pendant necklace of beads and
feathers.
The centre section of the spider's web has a circle of blue stones around it,
like the centre of a target.
It is called a dream catcher and it was made by the Indians of western Canada
and every time I look at it I see hundreds of miles of forests, deep cut
rivers, white, foaming rapids and waterfalls and soaring, gaunt and stupendous
mountains capped by snow and seemingly so high that it is often difficult to
distinguish them from the clouds.
I see the Canadian Rockies, part of that great range, the backbone of North
America, which runs from British Columbia and Alberta in Canada through five
American states until it reaches Arizona and New Mexico and which is also
linked to other ranges, north and south, in Alaska and Latin America.
The scale boggles the mind. All of Scotland can be contained in one, small
section of a Canadian province and yet the Scot can feel at home here with the
great explorers names on the map, like Mackenzie and Fraser, who used the
turbulent rivers as roadways and who joined with the pioneer settlers, the
probing fur hunters, the French voyagers, early geologists, botanists, the rail
pioneers, the miners and Christian missionaries in first entering the ancient
lands of the Indians in or on the fringe of the Rockies.
The idea of the dream catcher is that the spider's net catches the dreams and
holds bad dreams and nightmares in its mesh. The good dreams go through the
hole and pass down into the feathers and are held there to be resurrected once
more. I want to go back to the Canadian Rockies: that's my dream.
I see Patricia Lake, not far from Jasper, with the calm waters looking olive
green against a backcloth of forests running high up a steep mountain face of
pink and red-brown rock and a shining blue sky above.
Our canoe was Indian style, narrow, with one paddler at the front and the other
at the rear with little points at the apex of bow and stern and a constant need
to keep it balanced. It was light and fast, but the need to remember trim is
imperative. A friend stepped from a rock on to the edge of the canoe and was
promptly catapulted into the water.
It was delightful to make a few strokes and then rest and feel the canoe
skimming over the surface and to scan the shores for bears. I recall Dutch
Lake, too, en route to the Rockies from lovely Vancouver Island, when the
evening light began to dim and we slept in a log cabin and a loon (like our
great northern diver) sent its eerie and poignant cry over the water. An Indian
carving of a loon, stylised and symbolic, also hangs on one of my walls.
Into the dream catcher, too, go memories of the burgeoning ski and sports
resort of Whistler which looked as if it had been set down out of the Swiss
Alps - and Swiss guides were prominent in opening up the Rockies for other
mountaineers as was our own Norman Collie - and where at least 800 summer
volunteers have jobs in the ski and sports installations and in aiding
visitors. It takes its name from the whistling call of the hoary marmot.
Helicopters and sea planes bring in visitors as well as the thousands who
arrive by car. Some camper vans are so big nowadays they tow an ordinary sized
car behind them in the manner of a yacht towing a dinghy.
Yet all around this busy resort, buzzing with life and activities ranging from
golf to river rafting, are dozens of snow-covered peaks where the walker or
mountaineer seeking solitude can easily find it.
Because that devouring monster, the sheep, is not here or only in small numbers
and because deer are not around in the same way as the Scottish Highlands, wild
flowers flourish, on average about three times the size of our own.
The colours sparkle in sunshine, red, blue, turquoise, yellow, and they look as
if they had been put on with a paint brush, an appropriate description because
a red flower was ``painted'' there in Indian legend.
I see snow-capped Mount Edith Cavell, named by the Canadians after a British,
heroine nurse shot as a spy by the Germans during the First World War, and
recall standing beside a small lochan with ice floes in it while the morning
sun started to loosen parts of the great, hanging glacier and whose shape
looked like an angel's wings, an apt if grisly name because it could mean death
to the uncaring or unwary.
Dozens of tourists walk up to the glacier, but such is the scale that at the
glacier itself and beyond it is difficult to pick out people against the
gravel-morraine. The ice is retreating in the lower glen and nature is
re-colonising sections with small trees and flowers. Chipmunks are seen and
dozens of jays, known as Whisky-jacks. Some tourism sites are too busy and at
Athabasca waterfall, where the water hurtles through a narrow gap, I was
reminded of the man at Blackpool who said: ``If the woman in front of me hadn't
had pierced ears I wouldn't have seen the beach.''
But, above all, we see the long and lonely stretches of Boulder Pass and
Deception Pass, nor far from the tourism-Mecca of Lake Louise, in Banff
national park, and where there are wilderness trails for walkers and horses.
The names tell a story: Redoubt Mountain (looks like a fort), the Walls of
Jericho (rocks keep falling off it), Merlin's Castle (looks like it) and
Deception Pass itself (you think you are never getting to the crest). I can
still feel the sun beating off the rocks and where a sun hat and dark-goggles
were essential and the cold air and the snow falling steadily on us at the
crest of the pass in August as if it was a Scottish winter.
We revelled in one wild corner of huge mountains, long passes, endless woods,
bears and wolverines, eagles and marmots, navy blue night skies with huge
stars, and, alas, mosquitoes and small insects called can't-see-'ems (keep your
repellant on) and a mystery ``dog'' which ran into a lonely lodge area and out
again and which may have been a wolf.
The poet Rupert Brooke made a clanger when he wrote a much quoted passage in
praise of Lake Louise because he implied the area had no history, a sentence
totally dismissive of the Indians whose names for some mountains are still used.
We went into a craft shop where Indian carvers were at work and saw a notice
which said: ``This is what happened to the last shoplifter who was caught in
here.''
Hanging on a nail was a scalp.

<TEXT>
DR Colin Barron, of the Scottish Association of Care Home Owners, takes issue
with my comments on the cost of residential and nursing-home care for older
people (December 7).
My point in the original article concerned the inadequacy of the funds
allocated by Government to community care. One of the outcomes of this is that
care-home providers - whether private, voluntary, or local authority - are not
adequately reimbursed for the services they provide to people whose financial
circumstances make them dependent on the public purse to fund their care.
The necessity for the Church of Scotland to close several homes for this very
reason bears me out.
Kenneth Clarke's Budget failed to do anything to help these people and the
organisations which care for them. My figures on care home costs were not
intended to compare unfairly the costs of caring for relatively independent
people with frail older people. I was illustrating the range of costs that
might be payable.
The community care budget should be able to meet the costs of care for people
who, rightly, have an expectation that the welfare state that they funded
throughout their lives would not turn its back on them in their old age.

Sarajevo
THE Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, urged Sarajevo citizens today to
find forgiveness in their hearts to allow peace a chance to take root.
``A land that has no room for forgiveness is a land that will live in the past,
it will have no future,'' he told a joint mass in Sarajevo's Roman Catholic
Cathedral.
Dr Carey, pictured right, told a packed congregation they were meeting at a
time of ``hope and repentance'' in the Christian calendar, and acknowledging it
would be difficult to forget, he urged them to try to put 3!s  years of brutal
war behind them.
``We have seen your suffering, your grieving, and shared your pain,'' he said.
After the ceremony, Dr Carey presented Sarajevo's Cardinal Vinko Puljich with a
Celtic cross.-Reuter.

THE boys have at last got their act together in the BSE debate. We've toiled
over a dozen pints of ale and figured it all out. There is a way out of the
predicament, but only one. And the news is not good.
BSE has to be eradicated. It doesn't matter how often the Government tells
people that there is no proven link between BSE and human health. As long as
there is one person with a scientific pedigree who is willing to say there is a
risk, however small, of this disease jumping to humans we will be zapped by
another blaze of publicity which will scare people off beef.
The problem is that scientists, clever as they are, cannot prove that anything
in the real world is impossible. It doesn't matter if they can't get monkeys to
take BSE. It might make it seem unlikely that humans can get it, but you never
know. If we were to inject brains from cows infected with BSE into the brains
of humans they might start to show symptoms.
It is no use saying to the scientists that we are hoping people will eat our
beef, not inject it into their brains. Even if they can't infect us by one
means, who can prove that we cannot become infected by another means?
But even if the said injections didn't enable the disease to jump from cows to
humans that still wouldn't prove that BSE couldn't be caught by humans. All it
would prove is that the disease doesn't spread by the injection of infected
brains. Actually I think we know that.
So, while we should support all attempts to understand as much as possible
about BSE and about scrapie, the disease of sheep which seems to be related to
Creutsfeld-Jacob disease which affects up to one in a million of us, such
research can only damage the farmers.
The only way such research can settle the matter is if they prove a link
between BSE and the human condition. Research, by the nature of its rules of
proof, simply cannot prove beef innocent.
And that's what really bugs the boys in the discussion group. They can't prove
the negative. They might one day prove that beef is dangerous but they can
never prove that it is safe.
The Salmon Inn on Sunday was in uproar as I tried to persuade the boys that I
knew best in this matter. I had been to a fancy school after all, and I'd been
to university for 17 years. ``Hugh,'' said Big Hamish, ``my wife's cousin was
at the university and he came oot efter three years. You couldna have been that
good if you took 17.''
Anyway, I have more or less persuaded the boys that we really have to
co-operate with the authorities and to do all in our power to help solve the
problem of BSE. Every time some farmer is caught selling a beast with BSE for
eating that is more bad publicity, though why anyone would do it we cannot
imagine. Why would anyone sell an old cow to the trade for the average of #500
when he could get #800 or #900 compensation?
If a slaughterhouse is shown to dodge the rules on the removal of the
potentially infectious material from carcasses, then that is another black mark
even if there is no evidence that it is actually infectious. So we should use
such influence as we have with the trade and get them to behave.
But it doesn't matter what we do. As long as BSE exists we will be hit when
some other scientist comes up with another theory about what might happen one
day.
There are only two long-term hopes.
The first is fanciful. Food hysteria might subside. If people get to the stage
where they can say: ``Yes life is all about balancing risks and advantages.
There is a risk from eating steak. If I have high cholesterol, a big steak
dinner could kill me. If the butcher shop is on the other side of the street, I
could be killed going over to get it. And there is a far smaller risk, a risk
so small that you cannot put a figure on it, that I might get a disease people
don't get off beef.
``All those risks are small enough to be no bigger than the risks attached to
the alternative. After all, I could go on a diet of carrots but I don't know
how they kill the carrot fly or whether the insecticide might not kill me one
day.''
The other hope is the eradication of BSE. If there is no BSE then we can stop
worrying about people getting it.
Of course, we would still have Creutfeld-Jacob disease ravaging one in a
million of the meat-eating population and the same number from each million
vegetarians. At the same time smoking would continue killing 300,000 out of
every million heavy smokers. And people would still be unable to see that there
is any significant difference between those figures.
The value of those lovely calves with their ringworm has fallen this week by
#50 a head and it looks like they could be down #100 on the spring day, so the
news is all bad on the cattle front. The scientists may not be able to prove a
negative but they can produce a big negative on my balance sheet without being
able to prove a positive.
If I am right, what that means is that the public are just not sophisticated
enough to handle the information that is coming out. As a democrat I cannot
really propose such a thing, but I cannot resist pointing out that if the
scientists were locked up in their ivory towers and not let out until they had
come to hard conclusions, there would be a considerable saving to the country.

ANCIENT and modern, primitive and sophisticated; Graham Hair's all-female group
of singers teamed up last night with the Chamber Group of Scotland to produce a
brew of vocal music that spanned the centuries.
It's generally assumed that one of the so-called problems with modern music is
its relative complexity for listeners. That there is a paradox within that
thesis was nicely highlighted last night in a selection of medieval carols,
drawn from the collection Musica Britannica, whose rhythmic and contrapuntal
intricacies were so mind-boggling that they make the most fiendish technical
acrobatics of contemporary music seem like child's play.
The paradox was further highlighted last night by the newest work in the
programme, Jane Gardner's Banten for three singers and three percussionists, a
McEwen commision receiving its first performance. Here was music as direct as
it comes: exuberant choral chanting, luminous vocal lines and - above all -
rhythm.
Though the Balinese characteristics were unmistakable, rhythms from rock and
minimalism also seemed to infiltrate the texture: rhythm in all its guises was
the bedrock of the piece. It's tempting to suggest that the highly exotic music
lacked formal discipline, but it was obviously intended to be rhapsodic and
flowing. Further hearing would determine whether the structure matches the
content.
The appealing primitivism of Gardner's new work absolutely complemented the
super-sophistication of Sally Beamish's compelling Magnificat, for voices and a
larger instrumental group, which seemed to lack focus, especially in some of
the percussion playing.

GENNADY ZYUGANOV, leader of the front-running Communist Party, predicted
sweeping changes to Russia's political life after the results of today's
parliamentary election came out.
``The government will not be able to rule in the old way when they see the
voting results, in the army, regional industrial centres, and villages,''
Zyuganov said as he cast his ballot.
``Their policy will have to be corrected. Any government which realises it is
not supported must make adequate decisions. We will see how many votes they
receive.''
Opinion polls, which got the result badly wrong two years ago, put the
communists well ahead of the 42 other parties contesting the election to the
State Duma lower house.
However the Russian constitution gives the Duma limited powers and Zyuganov
admitted that a communist-dominated Duma would be unable to reverse the
situation in Russia.
``Even if the Duma was totally comprised of opposition (to the government), it
would be impossible to change the situation under the present power
structure,'' he said. ``The Duma does not control the implementation of laws
and resolutions.
The Communist Party wants to halt privatisation, increase state controls on the
economy, and hold a referendum on rebuilding the Soviet Union. Its main
constituency includes pensioners nostalgic for security and low prices of the
past.
However Zyuganov said there was no reason to fear him or his policies. ``I am a
very peaceful man, I am the most peaceful man. Just look at me, how could
anyone fear me?'' he said.
Zyuganov nevertheless lashed out at President Boris Yeltsin and his government.
``Yeltsin has four times more power than Clinton does, more than the Russian
Tsar, the General Secretary (of the Soviet Communist Party), and the Egyptian
pharaoh put altogether,'' he said.
``But he does not feel responsible for anything, he is not afraid of the Lord
God Almighty.''
Yeltsin, 64, on Friday he appealed to Russians to reject the ``forces of the
past'' - a clear reference to the communists.
Zyuganov, a burly former party ideologist, said he was ready to co-operate with
any of the parties provided they agreed to respect the integrity of Russia and
the idea of peace and well-being for all its citizens.
He was far from enthusiastic, however, about co-operating with the centrist
bloc of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
``The present government . . . is continuing the destructive policies of its
predecessors. We suggested our economic policy to them, but they did not want
it.''
Chernomyrdin, speaking later after a news conference, said he was not afraid of
a possible communist success.
``No, I am not afraid at all. There is nothing terrible,'' he said. ``We will
find a common language with everyone, with everyone who thinks about Russia.''
However leading reformer Yegor Gaidar, a former acting prime minister, warned
that a Zyuganov victory could provoke chaos and derail market economy reforms.
Still, even he excluded a lurch back to hard-line, Stalin-style totalitarian
rule.
``It is absolutely clear that there will be no more totalitarian rule in
Russia,'' Gaidar said after voting, ``but they can still damage market
mechanisms and deal them a blow.''
Grigory Yavlinsky, head of Russia's main liberal party, the Yabloko bloc, was
also worried about a communist triumph. ``We must be careful, because Communism
is a myth -but (it) is very dangerous,'' he told reporters.
q Russian officials claimed a big victory today for their preferred candidate
to head breakaway Chechnya but journalists cast doubt on the way the vote was
staged.
Fighting disrupted voting in parts of Chechnya, held alongside Russia's General
Election just over a year after Moscow sent in troops to quell a rebellion.
Russian troops confronted rebels for the fourth consecutive day in Gudermes,
Chechnya's second largest town.
Yeltsin's chief of staff Sergei Filatov said that Doku Zavgayev had won from
85% to 90% of the vote in the war-torn separatist region. Official turnout
figures ranged from 50% to 70% although journalists saw few signs of people
voting.
Moscow-backed authorities closed the polling stations at 3pm, seven hours ahead
of the rest of Russia, and began counting ballots, Tass reported.
Zavgayev's main competitors had pulled out of the poll saying it was a fraud
and international observers and peace brokers from the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe stayed away.
Filatov said premier Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia party was leading in the
race for the region's parliamentary seat.-Reuter.

EXCLUSIVE
MONKLANDS District Council has been accused by a trade union of showing
contempt for its workers for apparently seeking to appeal an industrial
tribunal ruling ordering it to reinstate a dismissed painter.
The Labour-controlled council - which was the subject of a Government inquiry
into alleged corruption - is believed to be seeking an extension from the
Employment Appeals Tribunal to a 42-day period in which to appeal against the
ruling, which expired last Thursday.
An industrial tribunal in Glasgow ruled in November that Mr Michael Mitchell,
31, of Lavelle Drive, Coatbridge, had been sacked unfairly in March this year
and ordered the council to give him his job back by December 8 and pay him
#7790 compensation.
The tribunal stated that the council ``drove the proverbial horse and cart
through every possible tenet of good industrial relations'' and described its
conduct at a meeting leading to Mr Mitchell's dismissal as ``little short of
disgraceful''.
Mr Mitchell, who was sacked for incapacity because of ill health, has neither
been reinstated nor paid his compensation.
He has been unemployed and living on state benefit since his dismissal, and
claims he is suffering severe financial hardship as a result of the council's
position.
A divorcee, whose six-year-old daughter lives with his ex-wife, he fears he
will have to seek a bank loan and ask for money from relatives to enable him to
meet the financial costs of Christmas.
A spokesman for Monklands District Council could not be contacted yesterday to
confirm whether it intended to appeal and was seeking an extension of the time
available to do so or whether it would reinstate Mr Mitchell and pay him his
compensation.
Mr Mitchell's union representative, Mr Gordon Casey, Scottish regional
organiser of Ucatt, said he understands that the council is seeking an
extension to the time available to lodge an appeal.
Mr Casey said yesterday that, ``in deciding to appeal, the authority are once
again showing their contempt for the workers who provide a service to the
tenants of Monklands''.
He said the council also appeared to have contempt for the tribunal procedure
and described its performance in the matter as ``amateurish''.
``Instead of learning from the mistakes they made, which were clearly shown at
the tribunal, they are continuing to try to defend a position which has been
exposed by the tribunal as being very unreasonable.
``The council have had every opportunity to appeal against the finding but, in
line with their usual incompetence, they have missed the deadline.''
Mr Casey added: ``I don't think we have any say in whether they should be
granted an extension but I think it should be rejected.
``An extension should be granted to small companies that are busy and for whom
industrial relations are an aside. Monklands are involved in quite a number of
industrial relations issues and should have knowledge and experience of what is
required.''
Mr Mitchell is next due to see his daughter Mairead, a pupil at St Patrick's
Primary School, Coatbridge, on January 6. He said yesterday: ``It's going to be
a struggle at Christmas unless I get the money I'm due and my job back.''

THE organiser of the world's biggest Burns conference expressed his concern
last night that only half the tickets had been sold.
With only three weeks to the conference at the University of Strathclyde in
Glasgow on January 11-13, the organiser, Dr Ken Simpson, said they had sold
only 100 tickets out of a possible 200 for both the Thursday and Friday, while
only 150 tickets had gone from 400 for Saturday.
The revelation follows last week's news that the Burns International Festival
was facing a cash crisis and may have to be altered radically, or cancelled, if
more funding could not be found.
The festival had already been hit by a series of incidents, including top
performers such as Kiri Te Kanawa, Billy Connolly, and Runrig saying they had
not properly been consulted before being touted as potential participants. A
planned satellite link-up of Burns dinners around the world - hyped as the
world's biggest Burns Supper - also fell through.
Dr Simpson, director of the Centre for Scottish Studies at Strathclyde and
himself an eminent critic of eighteenth-century Scottish literature, said:
``While the non-events in the Burns bicentenary have received maximum exposure,
our three-day international conference has not attracted the publicity it has
deserved.
``As a result, the current level of bookings is less than a tribute to Burns in
his bicentenary year.''
Dr Simpson said he had begun organising the conference a year ago and tickets
had gone on sale two months ago.
``I'm hopeful that, once Christmas and the New Year are over, the thoughts of
real Burns enthusiasts will turn to giving the Bard a celebration worthy of his
bicentenary year and prove that Scots' interest is truly genuine with a good
turnout.''
Every major authority on Burns will be in attendance, including scholars David
Daiches, Donald Low, and Thomas Crawford, and writer Iain Crichton Smith, while
younger speakers will include Liam McIlvanney, son of poet and novelist
William, and Kirsteen McCue, daughter of singer Bill McCue.

THE Government has been accused of having a blind spot over the judicial system
in Scotland, by ignoring the ``crying need'' for more full-time judges,
sheriffs, High Court prosecutors, and fiscals.
The accusation is made in the current edition of the Journal of the Law Society
of Scotland, the solicitors' governing body.
The opinion column of the journal highlights the problems at Falkirk Sheriff
Court last month, when the local procurator-fiscal, Mr George Scott, cancelled
the district court because he had no staff to prosecute the 15 cases to be
heard.
The journal takes the view that this was a brave decision which ``quite
rightly'' has brought commendation rather than criticism.
``It served to highlight the predicament faced by the Crown Office, the
procurator-fiscal system, and especially fiscals such as Mr George Scott, in
not having adequate personnel in the right place at the right time to ensure
that the system works.
``There are real and practical problems facing the Crown Office and the
procurator-fiscal service in terms of manpower.
``To keep the criminal courts running, extensive use requires to be made of
temporary Advocates-depute and temporary procurators-fiscal.
``Although the procurator-fiscal's department in Glasgow has approximately 60
legal staff, and 10 part-time legal staff, there is a daily requirement of
anything from six to 10 temporary fiscals to be called in to deal with business
in the sheriff court and the district court.
``It is a strange anomaly that this Government, which prides itself as being
dedicated to law and order, appears not to provide the judicial system with
adequate financial resources.
``There is crying need for more full-time judges, sheriffs, Advocates-depute,
and fiscals.''
The journal concedes that there is a place in the system, and justification
for, part-timers, but argues that they should not be essential to ``keep the
show on the road''.
``The Government seems to have a blind spot about the judicial system.
``It makes much at party conferences of the provision of additional police on
the beat - and rightly so. It boasts about ``tough measures'' and stricter
regimes in prisons and detention centres.
``But we do not yet jump from police investigation straight into prison.
``The Government seems to forget about the step in the middle - the essential
judicial process - but perhaps it sees the courts and those who work in them as
an irrelevance and interference in the investigation and disposal of crime.
``It would do well to give more support and additional resources to the running
of the courts.''

A REPORT on an alleged attempted fraud involving six cows is to be sent to the
procurator-fiscal following a joint investigation by police and trading
standards officers.
The investigation centred on paperwork for the cows, which were due to be
slaughtered. The beasts were impounded when the allegations came to light.
They had been sold at a Lanark auction and then sent for slaughter to an
abattoir at Biggar.
The allegations centre on claims that the beasts were ``switched'' while the
paperwork remained the same. Cows from herds which are certified to have been
free from BSE for the last six years carry a higher value than cattle which
come from farms which have seen some cases of the disease.
Last night, a spokesman for Strathclyde Trading Standards said: ``Our
investigation has been completed and a report has been forwarded to the
procurator-fiscal. There was no suggestion that these cows actually had BSE.''
Cows which are certified as being BSE free can sell for #50-#60 more than other
beasts.
The investigation follows a similar case in Ayrshire when a farmer was
prosecuted. It comes as the Government and the meat industry face mounting
problems over whether beef is safe to eat.
Some shops report a 20% drop in beef sales. Schools have withdrawn beef from
menus and a top expert on diseases of the nervous system, Dr Alan Dickinson,
has attacked Government Ministers who claimed there is no link between BSE and
the human condition, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
Dr Dickinson said: ``No-one can totally rule out a link. What is needed is more
research but the Government cut funding.''

YOU have written some atrocious leaders on the subject of European Monetary
Union but The EMU debate (December 9) must be one of the worst.
You ask why ``75% of the Dutch support a single currency?'' but make no attempt
to explain beyond exclaiming that ``the D-mark rules and that is an end to it''.
Can you explain why 67% of Germans are opposed to a single currency, why the
Danes opted out at the Edinburgh Summit, why the Swedes are losing their
enthusiasm, why the Italians are beginning to ask serious questions for the
first time, and why you persist in pursuing the ludicrous notion that it is
unimportant for member states of the EU who runs their economies, just so long
as it is not their national governments?
In attempting to meet the Maastricht criteria, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and
Sweden have already cut their state benefits substantially, while the proposed
cuts in France are merely a portent of what is to come.
Whatever happened to the Social Chapter and what levels of unemployment will
the southern European and peripheral economies be required to thole so that
Chancellor Kohl may have his place in history as a ``genuine European''?
The central and eastern European states will no doubt be thrilled to know that
Kohl sees them as being no more than ``buffer states'' so that Germany can be
``safely distanced from Russia''.
A few weeks ago you were calling for an informed debate on EMU. I hope your
latest contribution is not an example of how you intend to participate.

WREATHED with the euphoric words ``Long ago at Christmas......'', Oscar
Hijuelos begins his new, delicate fable of love and wonder and reprieve from
the maiming pain of loss.
Caught up in Mammon's town, Mr Ives is raising his family to respect the
mysteries of life. Amid the frenzied avarice of New York he gently pursues the
American Dream, a decent man whose material success has never scarred his
humanity. The nervy, high-priced glitter of the city has danced around Ives
leaving his spiritual wealth intact.
And then the unthinkable happens. Within seconds his only son, who intends to
study for the priesthood, is murdered by a stranger, shot dead on the sidewalk
from three bullets fired by a teenage hoodlum, an angry street kid offended by
the son's good-natured glance in his direction. A look which the killer
translates as invasion, and so he slays the son, ripping his heart and tearing
his femoral artery in two. This is New York, asshole. Bang, bang, bang.
Thus Ives finds himself stranded on the landscape we call grief, his religious
faith ransacked, his eyes cast down, haunted by the shocked bewilderment he saw
frozen on the face of his son, when the police lifted a corner of that cold,
kerb-side blanket.
Hijuelos locates the story close to his own ethnically-mixed neighbourhood in
Upper Manhattan, but the period spans the 1950s and 60s, giving the tale an
elegiac quality of time lost, time retrieved. And within it there is this
nostalgic longing for a less secular age than our own.
Hijuelos, a Pulitzer Prize winner for his most widely known and exuberant
novel, The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, offers us now a courageously
meditative book where goodness, ambushed by violence, tortured by doubt,
eventually defies destruction. With Mr Ives' Christmas Hijuelos challenges us
to consider the unchic theme of one man's tender saintliness.
Yet this book, just published in Britain, is proving a seasonal miracle.
Because of its lyrical verve, its carefully measured emotion and subtle
infusion of joy, the parable of Mr Ives is holding its own in the best-seller
lists of America. Now its progress here is expected to be similar as we
contemplate whether our own culture is so very different. Suddenly, a random
murder outside a London school has made the poignancy of Ives seem more potent
than ever.
On the day that Frances Lawrence wrote so movingly to her dead husband's pupils
at St George's in Maida Vale, Oscar Hijuelos was concluding his book tour only
a few miles away in Soho Square.
``There is always one question which arises from these terrible events: why was
the victim punished for doing the right thing?'' he muses. ``We can't easily
comprehend the answer, but although it may be archaic to say so I am in no
doubt that there is evil in our world, a form of moral narcissism which
excludes the well-being of others and holds goodness in contempt.''
Hijuelos himself is a contemplative man, a first generation New Yorker of Cuban
stock whose own immigrant sensibility always places him ``a little on the
outside, trying to figure why I can't be walking along, happy in my brain
rather than brooding''. But that analysis doesn't form the whole picture. On
encounter Hijuelos exhibits a social lightness often irreverently humorous,
combining Latin courtesy and the you-have-got-to-be-kidding defences of any
beleaguered Manhattanite.
``I used to have a running joke that with Mambo Kings, the audience for my
readings was composed of actresses, exotic dancers, and babes. Now with Mr
Ives, I get nuns and very old widows. OK, just joking, but it's true to some
extent. And, as never before, I have a third element - young mothers and
fathers who have lost children to violence, which is something you can never be
funny about.''
So, this tour, taking him through the States and around much of Europe, has
been emotionally arduous, stripping Hijuelos of his protective wisecracks, and,
as the book had done, it has given him access to feelings never developed in
himself.
``Sure, I am an admirer of people like Ives who go out of their way to be
helpful to others without wanting anything in return. And, when you are
creating a character like that you do become better than you are for a while.''
Like Ives, Hijuelos, who is 44, was raised as a traditional Catholic in one of
New York's ethnic neighbourhoods. ``I still believe in a divinity but while I
think Catholicism is great for art, and is mysterious in the way religion
should be, I reject its rigidity on social issues.''
As always, though, he will go to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve because of the
spiritual pull of mythology. ``We change all the time in ourselves but
Christmas is that still point in life when the past is present, and I find
enchanting mystery in that.''
With some amusement Hijuelos also notes that Mr Ives, as if magically
interceding on his behalf, has restored his standing with the local priest at
Corpus Christi where the author was baptised.
``This is the church, in fact, where Ives goes in anguish and in peace. In real
life the priest there has followed my career with some sense of secret pride
although he couldn't publicly approve of Mambo Kings because it had a lot of
sex in it. The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien had some sex in it
too, so he was pretty silent on that one, also. But Ives he read and adored,
and now he plugs it, holding the book up during sermons.''
That pleases Hijuelos most because he believes Ives, born a foundling and
bereaved as a father, captures the essence of someone we need today. ``In
Britain I read that you have about 286 hand-gun murders a year. Well, in the
States the figure is around 18,000. But it isn't that life is cheaper there. In
fact, given the vast mix of races, life is probably more coveted in America.
``But there is no longer any way of avoiding the fact that our problems are
connected to family breakdown and the way children are treated at home. I know
from my own experience as a teacher that the apple does not fall far from the
tree, that kids do behave according to how their parents behave towards them.''
But Hijuelos also places equal blame on political neglect and a Scrooge
contempt for the poor. ``It's too easy to condemn Tiny Tim as a scam artist.
What about the scam artists with power? For me, books and art can transform
people's perception of how life can be, but in New York so much is predatory
now, with this sinister entrepreneurship in sex and drugs.
``In my neighbourhood, near Duke Ellington Boulevard, you see 18-year-old guys
driving around in $60,000 cars, and you know that they're not stockbrokers. So,
New York is a frontier. But then again my mother, aged 83, also lives in this
tough neighbourhood by herself. She does her shopping and nothing bad has
happened to her, apart from once being mugged, but that was 25 years ago.''
However, despite its frequent proximity to hell, New York for Hijuelos is the
only permanent address worth having. ``It's the capital of the world in that
every aspect of the world is in it. New York is essentially about human
energies and life's crazy diversity in one location. And that makes the whole
of life furiously exciting and intense.''
Hijuelos' father died when he was 17, a quiet man but one whose mood could
change a room. That was around the late fifties, a bereavement which left his
widow and two sons struggling with the deep insecurities of the immigrant: ``We
were consumed by the belief that if we didn't do things exactly right we'd be
punished. My mother would panic that we would be evicted if a bill was paid a
day late, or that the electricity would be turned off for ever.''
Hijuelos has often used his books to pay homage to the exile's valour, and
although he is mostly reticent about his private world, he says: ``I've had
friends who've been shot and killed, so it is not shocking to me any longer to
have the panic and sadness of that kind of tragedy unfold.''
Even so, life has made him impatient with the presumption that violence is
always poverty's malevolent twin. ``It doesn't have to be that way. We grew up
so poor we didn't really have any money for books, and near us there was a
Puerto Rican family who had nothing but their natural intelligence and a work
ethic inherited from their mother. Five sons reared single-handedly by her
without bitterness, four becoming attorneys, the fifth a doctor. A perfect
example of that old first generation immigrant drive towards the professions.''
In the Hijuelos household, however, the two sons skipped that impulse, in order
to become artists, Oscar the writer, his brother a painter. ``But I think that
was because the arts were in our blood from a grandfather who was quite famous
in Cuba as an opera singer and a poet.''
Mr Ives' Christmas began with Hijuelos in ho-ho mood, wanting to write a jolly
fairytale. ``But it was so frothy it didn't have any tension, and that meant
nothing about it mattered very much. Then I began to think about the archetypal
images of Christianity - the baby in the cradle, the man on the cross;
religiousity and sorrow. And in between the two I placed this little, ordinary
guy called Ives who suddenly finds his goodwill challenged in the most
lacerating way.
``Sorrow is such a negative quality but its contrast to everything else
highlights elation. Yet even while I was writing the book I was surprised how
pensive Ives became. In that sense I suppose he is more medieval than modern,
although he would never put anyone on the rack.''
But long ago at Christmas  Hijuelos remembers his own blinding vision of
wonder. He was about nine years old, and to make a few dollars' pocket money,
he set forth on an adventurous pilgrimage to a fancy neighbourhood off Park
Avenue. There he was to deliver a set of engraving plates to a handsome house
in the East Sixties, and as he passed the brownstone's big window the poor
child caught a glimpse of a rich world and what he had always imagined the
ideal Christmas to be.
``There was a grand fireplace, and a tree, and a table covered with cookies,
fruits, and delicacies. At another table there was a kid playing with soldiers,
and in a corner a little girl sitting at the piano.'' Hijuelos went through the
servants' entrance where a black maid led him into the pantry and gave him a
sandwich. ``She was very kind to me. It was a cold, miserable day, and my
father had just suffered a heart attack, so things weren't too cheerful at
home.'' When he was outside again, Hijuelos lingered, mystified by the beauty
of this remote world of Haves.
He has never forgotten that experience. ``But about 15 years later when I was
once walking down that street, with a friend, out of the same brownstone
emerged this beautiful blonde whom, I swear, was the little girl at the
piano.'' He has no proof it was she, of course, but that's Hijuelos for you.
Like any dedicated New Yorker he follows a star of his own devising, sending
out a message of perennial, hardy hope.
n.Mr Ives' Christmas by Oscar Hijuelos. Bloomsbury, #15.99.
The movie of the Hijuelos novel, The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, will be
shown on BBC2 at 9.15pm on Saturday.

A FATHER is fighting for his life in hospital after challenging a gang of
youths who threw beer cans through a window of his home.
Civil engineer Paul Brighton, 44, had his skull crushed after chasing the
youths, who pelted him with bricks and cans.
He underwent surgery yesterday to remove particles of bone embedded in his
brain.
His wife, Susan, 41, said: ``A quiet Saturday night at home with the children
turned into a nightmare.''
Mr Brighton was taken to a nearby hospital before being transferred to
Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
A spokeswoman for the hospital said: ``Mr Brighton has had an operation today
and his condition is critical.''
The Brightons were watching television at home with their children Gareth, 11,
and Christopher, 13, when they heard glass smashing.
Their house, in the village of Orton Waterville, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire,
is next to a public footpath leading to the village from a new housing
development.
Mrs Brighton said: ``A beer can had smashed through the bathroom window. The
boys had just been in the bath and Paul was furious.
``Paul usually works away from home in the week and his weekends at home with
the children are precious to him.
``He is a proud family man. He did not stop to think. He was so shocked that
the children could have been hurt.
``He flew through the door and I telephoned the police. I went out looking for
them and saw Paul being taken into an ambulance.
``Apparently, he had been unconscious but had come round. He was trying to
speak but his words were all over the place.''
She said the family had lived in the village for 15 years and ``loved it''.
``It should be the last place where anything like this could happen. We moved
to this house three years ago through Paul's hard work.
``It seems that just when you have got things as you want them, someone is
there to try to take it away from you.''
A detective said: ``This was a totally unprovoked attack.''
Five youths are being questioned about the incident.
The private housing estate where the Brightons live is often used as a
short-cut by local teenagers, neighbours said.
Streetlights have been broken and fences damaged by the youths.
One woman, who has lived on the estate for five years, said: ``It would be a
quiet, pleasant place to live if it wasn't for these paths they use as
short-cuts.
``There are always problems at night - teenagers larking about, kicking
bottles, and causing as much trouble as possible.
``I'd like to see them close the paths off and leave us in peace.''
Cambridgeshire Police said the five youths being held were also being
questioned about an attack at a nearby store, where a man was robbed of his
wallet.
Sergeant Kevin Feek, of Cambridgeshire Police, said the area was not known for
violence.
He said: ``Orton Waterville is certainly not a trouble spot as far as the
police are concerned.
``It is a quiet area, in fact so quiet it has many police officers living
there.''
Meanwhile, the Government was urged yesterday to create ``exclusion zones''
round schools in a bid to end the sort of gang violence which led to the murder
of headmaster Philip Lawrence in west London on December 8.
Tory MP Harry Greenway, a former headmaster, is planning to table Commons
questions to Ministers, pressing them to introduce such zones in which crimes
committed would attract tougher penalties than if they were committed elsewhere.
This practice has already been adopted in New York and has had a dramatic
effect in reducing school gate crimes of violence and extortion as children
leave for home at the end of the day.
Mr Greenway, in whose Ealing North constituency Mr Lawrence lived, said: ``This
would have the highly beneficial effect of softening and improving the
atmosphere around a school.
``It would make life much safer for children and for the teachers to have this
kind of exclusion zone in the vicinity of schools, in which really severe
penalties would be inflicted on people who chose to break the law.
``The penalties which the courts could impose for crimes committed within these
zones would be much tougher than if the crimes were committed outside them.
``This has been tried in other countries and all the reports suggest that it is
a highly successful development, which we should adopt in this country, even if
only on an experimental basis at first.
``I would, therefore, thoroughly recommend it on both Gillian Shephard,
Education Secretary, and Michael Howard, Home Secretary. I know we are sincere
in wanting to reduce crime at the school gate and reduce the dangers for
children and teachers alike.
``It would make sense to introduce suitable legislation which I am sure would
have the support of the entire House of Commons.''
Mr Barry Sheerman, Labour MP for Huddersfield, has tabled Commons questions to
Mrs Shephard requesting details of cases of teacher intimidation involving
dangerous or offensive weapons in each of the past five years.
Mr Sheerman has also asked what guidelines her department has issued to schools
regarding pupils found with dangerous or offensive weapons while attending
school.

TOMORROW the House of Commons gets the chance to debate Europe's fishing
policy. This touches Britain most acutely: because of our geographical location
we, and the southern Irish, bestride the main fishing grounds of the Union -
only the Iberian states enjoy as advantageous a position, and they have nothing
like the protected grounds of the North Sea. From a British perspective the
common fisheries policy ends the privileges conferred by geography, and opens
up grounds which were formerly a British monopoly to all our partners who are
exploiting the new opportunities with gusto, and with much less restraint than
is enjoined by the conservation rules. Most British fishermen are convinced
that, whereas they themselves are forced by the Ministry of Food and Fisheries
to implement the conservation rules fully, their continental competitors are
able simply to disregard them. British boats consign large numbers of (dead)
fish back to the waves - they should never have been caught in the first
instance - while their Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch colleagues simply sail
off with their illegal catches which are landed and sold.
Nearly everyone agrees that conservation rules are vital, even essential to the
preservation of some well-known species which are over-fished. The common
policy is supposed to achieve this end, but it is impossible to implement the
policy fully, and enough fishermen ignore it whenever they can to ensure that
it is a dead letter. The resentment that this engenders will make tomorrow's
debate a showpiece demonstration of rage and bitterness. The intensity of such
feelings will undermine old loyalties. Euro-sceptics are, of course, already
hostile to the fisheries policy and the way in which it operates. Tomorrow they
will be able to speak along with allies who are normally strong Europeans, but
whose constituencies, mainly along the southern English coast, are having their
economies seriously damaged by the common fishing policy. They will also, in
effect, be supported by Labour which of course wants to use the occasion to
injure the Government. Another Tory split on Europe is easily identifiable,
with at least one member threatening to resign the Whip.
The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary were anxious yesterday to dismiss
this threat and to scatter the extraordinary coalition which presents it before
it eventually coalesces. The key day in fishing, they point out, is not
tommorrow but Thursday when the Fisheries Minister, Mr Baldry, is in Brussels
for meetings designed to establish new fishing quotas. These are necessary if
the fishing industry of the whole Union, as well as individual members like
ourselves, is to remain viable. There is little doubt that over-fishing has
become acute, but in some way that significant matter is less important on this
occasion than the internal Tory battle about Europe and the Tory-Labour
campaign for the next General Election. Whatever the formalities and the
nominal subject, tomorrow's debate is about wider matters than fishing. That
seems a pity when fishing stocks remain essential to the food requirements of
the EU, and when the need to establish and maintain conservation procedures is
everywhere accepted. One of the things the Union should be able to do better
than any single Government is simply that. It encapsulates the wider interest
of Europeans as a whole, rather than distinct national groups, and has the
clout to enforce a sound common policy on all the member states. It may not get
the chance to do so, because the fish that British politicians want to fry
tomorrow is simply not the stuff you catch and eat.

Somerset West
CLOUDS of toxic gas from a blazing South African chemical plant killed three
people and forced the evacuation of 2500.
The fire, which began last night at the plant near the town of Somerset West 25
miles from Cape Town, sent poisonous sulphur dioxide clouds billowing over the
small town of Macassar.
Television pictures showed people being treated in emergency vehicles for smoke
and gas inhalation. Children with tears streaming down their faces were carried
to ambulances by parents with handkerchiefs clutched to their faces.
About 500 firefighters and other rescuers were involved in the operation to
control the blaze and air force helicopters water-bombed the smoking chemical
dump.
Incident commander Heinrich Munnik said no more casualties were expected beyond
the three killed and 100 treated in hospital from the effects of fumes and
smoke inhalation. Most had been discharged.
Tonight officials said the fire was out and residents were returning to their
homes along streets yellow with chemical residue.
Residents, who at first thought the smoke was caused by a grass fire, described
how they fled their homes as choking fumes made their eyes sting and made it
difficult for them to breathe.
``We just saw a bundle of smoke coming over our place . . . we first thought it
was just grass burning but then we smelt gas. Our eyes and noses were stinging
and our chests (were) so tight. We had difficulty breathing,'' said David Ross.
The company which owns the plant, African Explosives and Chemicals Industries
(AECI), said flames from a grass fire had been fanned by 40mph winds and leapt
a 25yd firebreak, setting ablaze stocks of sulphur.
``We never allowed for a 40mph wind to be driving the fire at this time of the
year,'' said Boet Coetzee, managing director of operations.
``Despite the precautions we took, it wasn't effective and for that I am
dreadfully sorry and we regret it.''
AECI said that the sulphur was part of a stockpile owned by the South African
Government and had been there for 10 years. The sulphur was stored in an area
the size of two football fields.
Asked why such potentially dangerous chemicals were being stored near homes,
Chris Nissen, Western Cape economics minister and provincial spokesman for the
African National Congress, replied: ``One must understand it against the
background of bad apartheid planning . . . where black people were located next
to strategic industries.''

Moscow
FORMER Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev predicted a Communist victory in
Russia's parliamentary election, but said the Russian people did not support a
full-fledged return to the past.
``Why will the communists win? Because the people remember that in the Soviet
Union, social guarantees were minimal, but that at least they existed. And the
communists are exploiting this,'' Gorbachev said after casting his ballot in
Moscow.
However the father of perestroika and glasnost said he was not convinced
Russians wanted to see the kind of communism that ruled the Soviet Union with
an iron fist for nearly 70 years.
Nevertheless, the last Soviet president - now widely reviled by Russians for
instituting reforms which led to the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union and
painful market economy changes - acknowledged that the current transition was
painful.
``I heard people in church saying, `We should not return to communism'. But one
old man said he would vote for (Communist Party leader Gennady) Zyuganov
because he would make reforms softer,'' he said.
Gorbachev, who ruled the Soviet Union from 1985-91 and ended the Communist
monopoly on power, declined to say for which party he had voted.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Hapless regulator Davis between axe and grinding wheel</HEADLINE>

NO doubt Mr Peter Davis, the regulator at the Office of the National Lottery,
will be hung out to dry by his political masters today, although he may deny
them by volunteering to go. He has been foolish; that much is certain. It was
silly and ill-advised of him to accept free jet and helicopter flights from the
American company which is part of the Lottery operators, Camelot. It was even
sillier of him to attempt to defend his actions by implying that he had thereby
saved taxpayers' money. It was his misfortune that the disclosure of his links
with GTECH, who have provided technical expertise to Camelot, coincided with
one of Mr Richard Branson's repeated attempts to convince everyone that his
non-profit-making consortium would have been better fitted to run the National
Lottery than Camelot. Mr Branson has his own particular axe to grind with GTECH
and the hapless Mr Davis has been caught between axe and grinding wheel.
Nevertheless it is reasonable to ask why, if Mr Davis is hapless or at least
capable of very poor judgment, he was appointed as the regulator of such a
volatile industry, if only represented by one company, namely Camelot. At first
glance he would appear to have reasonable qualifications. Like his fellow
regulators of other industries he is familiar with handling large sums of
money; but his background is basically that of an accountant in the building
society industry. This may suit a man for many things but not, we would
suggest, for tangling with the gambling industry, especially as represented by
its American cousins. Indeed, of all the regulators appointed by Goverment
Ministers it is difficult to think of one less-suited for this particular task
than Mr Davis. It might have been handled more appropriately by that eminent
toughie Mr Don Cruickshank, beloved by few during his tenure as head of the
National Health Service in Scotland, and now giving every sign of enjoying the
task of harrying BT in his capacity as regulator at the Office of
Telecommunications. Nevertheless it is hard to blame Mr Davis for all that has
happened. He has made mistakes but he operates within a system which is flawed
in a number of respects and which the Government should reform.
The Secretary of State for National Heritage, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, is said
to be anxious with the integrity of the National Lottery; and she should be.
The public may continue to buy tickets and scratch hards with undimmed
enthusiasm but their perception of the lottery, and more particularly of
Camelot and its burgeoning profits, is not encouraging. This perception is not
helped by the stream of reports which assess the impact that the lottery has
had on national life. The charities have had their say and have generally been
rebuffed by the Government which insists that more proof is needed before it
can be said definitively that the lottery has damaged charity receipts. The
prestigious Henley Centre is the latest organisation to suggest problems, with
its estimate that the lottery has permanently changed the spending habits of
more than one in two Britons and that more than #2.5billion which used to be
spent on food, leisure, or traditional gambling, has moved over to the lottery
in the past year. While pondering this, Mrs Bottomley might also consider
changing the rules which allow a regulator to decide who should run the lottery
and then to police them. This is not a system which encourages admissions of
error or, indeed, action to correct error. It is clear that much needs to be
done to ensure that the various regulatory regimes work properly. Resources and
powers should be enhanced so that none may appear in the future as amateurs in
a very professional game.

Clare Henry views an art pioneer's collection of pictures which forms one of
Glasgow's unsung treasures
WHILE Burrell and Glasgow are synonymous worldwide, Sir William Stirling
Maxwell, 9th Baronet of Pollok, is one of the hidden heroes of the city. A
scholar, who published the first major study on Spanish art in English in 1848
(which remained the standard text book till recently), his collection of
pictures is now one of Glasgow's unsung treasures.
Sir William's love was Spanish pictures. In his mid-twenties he travelled to
Spain on the grand tour and became hooked. He bought his first Goya, Boys
Playing, in Seville in 1842. Just under half his collection remains en block,
and was gifted to the city, along with 360 acres of Pollok Estate and Pollok
House, by his grand-daughter, Anne Maxwell Macdonald and her family in 1966.
The pictures have hung at Pollok ever since.
Now, due to major rewiring, re-roofing, and redecorating, Pollok House is
closed till summer. Meanwhile, Sir Wiliam's pictures have moved to the Burrell
where they form a splendid display, Visions of Spain, till April 14 next year.
The exhibition throws new light on these Spanish paintings - in some cases
quite literally! Darkly dramatic, hung high on Pollok walls, some have
previously been difficult to see.
Like many, I've known Pollok for years, taking visitors from Japan and New York
to marvel at the famous El Greco lady, Blake's exquisite Canterbury Tales,
Murillo's Madonna and Goya's see-saw kids, before repairing to its excellent
restaurant, long ago upstairs with lovely views, more recently in the Victorian
kitchen.
Everyone loves elegant Pollok House with its beautiful plasterwork, gorgeous
gardens and fine paintings. I hope its lived-in feel won't be lost in the
refurbishment, but improved documentation on the Maxwell family and their links
with Glasgow via politics, industry, and art, would be welcome.
Sir William was a real pioneer, as Spanish art was highly unfashionable.
Indeed, till recently, it remained a poor relation of the art world, and
compared to Italian or French art, grossly neglected. Pollok has undoubtedly
the best Spanish collection in the UK.
Sir Wiliam's collecting was astute and done around the time he inherited the
Stirling family seat at Keir, near Dunblane. He bought mainly at auction, the
highlight being the 1853 sale, held in London, of King Louis Phillippe's
Spanish Collection from the Louvre.
Here Sir William smartly snapped up El Greco's hypnotic Lady in a Fur Wrap. She
was already incredibly popular, almost a cult, so he had to pay #133! ``Her
countenance is,'' he wrote, ``one of the most beautiful that death ever dimmed,
and that the pencil ever rescued from the grave.''
Sold as a portrait of El Greco's daughter, later it was believed to be
Jeronima, his mistress and mother of his son. She wears ermine - so that's now
thought unlikely, but other candidates include the daughter of King Philip II,
or the Duchess of Bejar, Toledo. The painting dates from around 1577, when El
Greco was 36 and the speculation as to her identity only adds to its magic,
according to Hilary Macartney.
Macartney has been researching these Spanish pictures since 1979 when she
worked at Kelvingrove, before going to the Courtauld. She did the labels and
would love to publish a catalogue (we need it), and to collect all of Sir
William's pictures, now dispersed worldwide, together for an exhibition and a
book, ``so that people have a clear idea of just how important his collection
was''.
Pictures are now scattered to London's National Gallery, the Victoria and
Albert, and Stockholm's National Gallery, while the drawings went to the
Courtauld in the 1920s. Sir William also bought Blake's Canterbury Tales from
Thomas Butts' sale for 10 guineas!
Apart from El Greco, Velasquez, Murillo (a lovely Madonna and Child), and Goya,
few Spanish artists are well known - even by experts. However names like
Cosida, Valdes, Carducho, and Coello, whose swaddled baby we all
sentimentalise, may come to the fore.
Yet Coello's ornate oils of Spanish kings and queens speak of power, not of
personality. Their faces are impassive masks. For these are formal pictures
where no hint of treachery, letchery or greed is allowed to spoil an idealised
image. Whereas Holbein's Henry VIII and his henchmen are obviously hard men
under their silks, velvet, and lace, here only Carrenfio's sombre painting of
young Charles II, King of Spain, as a poor wee soul, made ``weak in mind and
diseased in body'' by generations of inbreeding, rings true.
Sir William was also fascinated by all types of printing techniques and his was
the first art book ever illustrated with photographs. Although Sir William was
rich, he didn't spend massive sums. His was a different agenda: he wasn't
collecting for prestige or status. As a scholar (he also wrote the first
monograph on Velasquez), his motive was research. The pictures were destined
for Keir House, not for Pollok as he never lived there.
On his death in 1878 the two estates, library, archive, and collection were
split between his sons, John and Archibald. His heir, John, chose Pollok not
Keir, maybe because it was near the burgeoning city of Glasgow; perhaps because
Keir, his childhood home, carried his father's stamp. At Pollok he breathed new
life into the house, extending both it and the gardens in 1890, 1901, and 1908,
leaving it as we see it today.
For Visual Arts UK Festival 1996 Velasquez's Rokeby Venus will form the
centrepiece of a show exploring the history of British collecting of Spanish
art at Bowes Museum, Durham. Here Pollok's pictures will be seen alongside work
from Bowes and London's National Gallery. I expect Sir William to shine.

FRENCH Prime Minister Alain Juppe, appealing for reconciliation after the worst

stimulate a flagging economy and pledged that current tax increases would be
the last.
A 24-day public transport strike was running out of steam as rail and Paris
transit workers, claiming victory over the conservative government, gradually
returned to their jobs.
In a television interview, a chastened Juppe said he felt ``understanding
because I have tried each day over these weeks to listen to what French people
were saying....... and reconciliation because I hope we emerge from this crisis
without scars, bitterness, or regrets''.
He made clear his disputed welfare reforms would go ahead, with new taxes and
health cost controls to be imposed by decree in coming weeks, but left the door
open to negotiation on details of health management reform.
After widespread criticism of his handling of the crisis, including within his
own centre-right coalition, Juppe said: ``Perhaps I didn't explain things well
enough.''
The Prime Minister promised to put proposals to help sustain flagging economic
growth to a ``labour summit'' with trade union and employers' leaders on
Thursday.
The country's most outspoken union leader, Marc Blondel of Force Ouvriere,
welcomed assurances by Juppe of a possible fine-tuning of reforms.
CGT union boss Louis Viannet called another day of action for Tuesday, but
other union leaders said the protests could wait until next month.
SNCF state railways said at least half its trains were running in most regions
and services in the Paris suburbs were also back on track. Eurostar trains via
the Channel Tunnel were running again.
Nine of 13 Metro lines were at least partly functioning today, the highest
level since Paris transport workers joined the strike on November 28.-Reuter.

<HEADLINE>I was corrupt and evil, admits Hindley</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

MYRA Hindley has confessed that she was ``corrupt, wicked and evil'' when she
committed the Moors murders 30 years ago.
And she says that in some respect she was ``more culpable'' than her lover and
co-murderer, Ian Brady.
In a letter written to The Guardian newspaper from Durham jail, 53-year-old
Hindley also says: ``I wasn't mad, so I must have been bad, became bad by a
slow process of corruption.''
She admits: ``I never attempted to justify my actions either to myself or Ian
Brady. I was the more culpable of the two.''
And she reasons: ``If we had not met there would have been no murders, no crime
at all. I would probably have got married, had children and now be a
grandmother.''
She adds: ``I take full responsibility for the part I played and I will not
attempt to justify the unjustifiable.''
The extraordinary hand-written letter runs to 12 pages and over 5000 words.
Hindley was jailed for life in 1966 with Brady for killing Lesley Ann Downey,
10, and Edward Evans, 17.
Brady was also convicted of murdering John Kilbride, 12. They later admitted
killing Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12.
Hindley was told 12 months ago that she must stay in prison for the rest of her
life, though her lawyers are seeking to have that decision overturned.
Hindley explains that she wrote the letter as a follow-up to another letter she
penned to The Guardian in October when she objected to being labelled a
psychopath.
``I was aware that the contents of my letter would beg many questions,'' she
says.
``If I wasn't suffering from any kind of mental disorder; if from what was
known of my earlier life I'd been a normal happy girl who gets on well with
relatives and friends; if psychopathy had nothing to do with the events which
led me to prison - how would I explain what led me to the things I did?
``Before I attempt to do this I want to make it quite clear that I make no
excuses for my behaviour in the years I spent with my co-defendant; that I take
full responsibility for the part I played in the offences and will not attempt
to justify the unjustifiable.''
She continues: ``I knew that what I was involved in was indefensible in every
respect: I know the difference between right and wrong and I cared deeply about
that difference, though I locked these feelings away.''
Hindley describes in great detail her infatuation with Brady.
``I knew virtually nothing about him or his past, only that he didn't believe
in marriage or having children, was a fervent atheist, hated black people and
Jews and had a consuming passion for Nazism.''
``He had a powerful personality, a magnet-like charisma into which my own
personality, my whole self, became almost totally subsumed.
``After the first murder, when he'd told me that if I'd shown any signs of
backing out I would have ended up in the same grave as Pauline Reade I felt
doubly doomed: first by the crime itself and also because I believed it was
impossible to envisage or hope for any other kind of existence.''
``Without me these crimes could probably not have been committed. It was I who
was instrumental in procuring the children - children who would more readily
accompany strangers if they were a woman and a man.''
She admits that she was unable to examine the behaviour that led to her crimes
for ``an unpardonable length of time''.
``And because I lacked the courage and decency to do so I could never publicly
express remorse.''
``But the person I am now, aged 52, bears little resemblance to the creature
involved in those crimes.''
Mrs Winnie Johnson, the mother of victim Keith Bennett, said in response to the
letter: ``She ruined my life and she's ruined five more families.''

`AT HARTHILL,'' said Ofpants. ``there's this secret repository where pantos are
stripped down and serviced before transferring from Edinburgh to Glasgow. It'll
be a different show.'' Oh no it won't, I thought. This was a panto I couldn't
warm to last year and I couldn't imagine that the format would have changed
that much even if the cast had been altered.
Oh my prophetic soul. Despite Jimmy Logan's welcome appearances as Nurse Polly,
this is predominantly an evening with Cannon and Ball.
After years of panto-going I feel I don't have to like a routine to respect it
so let's just offer warm congratulations to B and C for maintaining such a high
polish on old chestnuts like the crashing crockery sketch where Ball is the
hapless butterfingers forever heading in the wrong direction. Shoulders heaved
in helpless delight and strong men were seen to mop their eyes during this -
which no doubt makes me a prize meanie. Under pressure to fit in a plot as
well, David Greer's Robin is prone to rush somewhat breathlessly into things
while others, including Charles Kearney's dastardly Sheriff, do nobly by the
tranches of exposition that are often their sole reason for getting a look in
on stage.
Leaving the theatre Ofpants did try to console me: ``You may never look upon
its like again,'' he said. Quite. For if Glasgow's department of performing
arts and venues do alter the complexion of their seasonal entertainments next
year, then this showing by Cannon and Ball may turn out to be the end of panto
as we have known it in Glasgow.

Mans inhumanity to man has reached a stage where I am losing all understanding
of what has got into people. Daily day we face manifestations of this modern
sickness, whether it is a policeman being kicked senseless in Brixton (in riots
orchestrated by mobile phones!) or a Scottish schoolmaster being howled at by
the families of boys in whom he was trying to instil some discipline.
Thankfully, the master in question was cleared by a court which heard that one
of the boys had treated his headmaster to a volley of F-words.
If impossible parents would assume their responsibilities, instead of defending
and doting upon their belligerent little brats, our over-worked schoolteachers
wouldn't be left with the rough end of what should have been smoothed out at
home.
But violent attitudes are with us at every turn, to the point where cases which
might once have shocked become the commonplace of life. We choose to turn the
page, knowing there is only so much the human soul can take before being numbed
into bleak acceptance.
From time to time, however, your eye catches a case which cannot be ignored.
Such was my experience with a recent murder trial in Glasgow, where four young
people were sent to prison for the murder of a homosexual in the city's Queen's
Park.
As the first surprise, one of the accused was a 14-year-old girl, a pupil of
Shawlands Academy. Then came the pictures of the three boys, fairly
normal-looking lads who might live next door.
But, as I read the story, what struck me most was the coincidence of this
murder and another which took place within yards of the same spot 35 years ago.
Murder is murder but, if you compared the evidence of the two - they were both
about robbing homosexuals who were unlikely to report the matter - you would
have little doubt that the 1960 case was considerably less brutal than the 1995
one. Yet in the former, Anthony Miller, who lived nearby, was taken to
Barlinnie Prison where, in this Christmas week, he was hanged unto death. It
was Glasgow's last execution.
Society then adopted a more humane approach to the criminal. Sadly, the
criminal did not pass on the favour to the victim. For, on one night of evil in
June of this year, those youngsters first attacked two other homosexuals in
Queen's Park, kicking and beating and robbing them at knife-point.
Then they set upon their third victim, stabbing him, jumping on his head,
breaking every bone in his skull and face and pulping his brain till the family
could identify the remains only by a mark on his chest.
They tore off his jacket and the boys proceeded to gatecrash a party in
Pollokshaws Road where, still covered in the dead man's blood, they boasted
about their thuggery. Of course they will walk the streets again within a few
years.
Rather chillingly, not one of them had any record of violence. Nor for that
matter did Anthony Miller who was hanged. But, with the peculiar mentality of
those who resort to violence, he and his accomplice again couldn't resist
boasting of their foul deed when they repaired to a cafe in the adjoining
Victoria Road.
In 1960, the Miller case was enough to shock the public even before the
implications of execution. The fact that I lived nearby at the time merely
sharpened my interest.
The gist of the story was that the 19-year-old Tony Miller embarked on a series
of attacks on homosexuals at Queen's Park, along with a 16-year-old boy. The
latter acted as the lure while Miller came from behind with a piece of wood and
applied enough of a blow to facilitate a robbery.
In the case of John Cremin, a man in his mid-fifties, it went too far. While
his accomplice was too young to hang, Miller was over 18 and therefore liable
to die for his offence. Comparisons were soon being made with the English case
of Craig and Bentley, when age alone separated their fates.
A young Len Murray, still to make his name as a court lawyer, was faced by the
bewildered parents of Tony Miller, desperately seeking help. The mother thought
the hanging age was 21, not 18.
In fact, the case would hinge on whose hand actually struck the fatal blow.
Only that person could die. Miller did not give evidence so it depended on the
word of his young accomplice, who said it was the hand of Miller.
The jury found him guilty of capital murder and he was on his way to the
gallows. Lord Wheatley delivered the sentence. An appeal went unsuccessfully
before three judges, including that scourge of the razor-slashers, Lord
Carmont, and 30,000 people signed a petition to the Scottish Secretary, John S
Maclay.
Miller's father and Len Murray made last-minute appeals to the Queen but it was
all to no avail. The boy died at 8.02am on December 22, 1960.
That case turned Murray into a bitter abolitionist. The barbarity and the
futility of it all, he said, were inconsistent with our claims to be a
civilised society.
Today's criminal can breathe more easily, now that that barbarity has been
removed. What a pity that the potential victims in that ``civilised society''
have not been granted a similar reprieve.

AGGRO and, surprisingly, a large dollop of apathy finally put paid to the
oldest international fixture in the world six years ago. The English, a lot
keener to limber up for the World Cup with some quality South American
opposition than the hordes from north of the Border, simply didn't bother to
invite Scotland to take part in the 1990 Rous Tournament.
London had been growing weary of thousands of kilted Scots jumping into
fountains and running riot in the nation's capital anyway - albeit in a
generally good-natured fashion. The prospect of containing the emotions of
70,000 interlopers in a provocative atmosphere was never something the
authorities responsible for security had relished.
The seventies had brought the famous destruction of the Wembley goalposts and a
threatened strike by drivers on the London Underground. As the eighties
approached, each forthcoming invasion by the Tartan Army was treated with a
greater degree of hysteria.
Various wheezes were dreamt up to try to stop supporters crossing the Border,
including a ticket ban in 1981 - 60,000 Scots still turned up - and switching
the game to midweek in 1983. They had little effect.
For the next two years the match wasn't played in the capital but at Hampden.
When the Scots travelled south in 1986 there was trouble again.
It provided ammunition for the tie's opponents to build up a head of steam for
the last game played at Wembley in 1988.
As expected, it resulted in the usual handful of fans from both sides spending
a night in the pokey, but the fallout was enormous and the row spilled on to
the floor of the House of Commons, elevating Tory MP Terry Dicks to the
position of Most Hated Man in Scotland.
Showing remarkable bravado, the MP for Hayes and Harlington inflamed the issue
by calling Scots fans ``pigs and animals'', demanding instant birchings and
claiming miscreants should be imprisoned for five years without remission.
Inevitably Dicks paid a heavy price for his outspokenness - for days his
switchboard at the Commons was jammed by irate callers, he was publicly berated
by colleagues north of the Border, and he was vilified by the Scottish press.
Violence was never far away, however, and it marred the last sporting contest
between the two nations at Hampden the following year. About 120 fans - mostly
English - were arrested in Glasgow during the weekend and summarily dealt with
in a late-night marathon session at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
The air was heavy with claims of provocative action by extremist groups and
troublemakers travelling north simply for a square-go.
While crowd trouble continually haunted the headlines, the reality was that the
fixture, which for decades had grabbed the imagination of every Scot, had
unthinkably lost its grip on the public's imagination.
The glorious memory of Jim Baxter teasing and tormenting the then World
Champions in 1967 lives on for many as our greatest victory on the football
field, but the reality was that the eighties were lean years in terms of
success.
Part of the blame has been laid at the feet of Jock Stein, who had rightly
pointed out that there was more to life than beating England - qualifying for
the World Cup, for example.
Fear of trouble may also have prompted many to stay away from games but there
was little denying that the contest had lost much of its on-field glamour. The
timing of the fixture at the end of energy-sapping seasons removed the spark of
passion, and tired players regarded it as just another match to be negotiated
before their summer holidays.
The game was also packaged within the dreadfully dull Rous Cup Competition,
which failed to excite and in its last incarnation brought Chile to Hampden and
a miserly crowd of just 9000.
It's true that Hampden could still command a near-capacity crowd for the
Scotland v England game but the heady days of the fifties and sixties, where
70,000 could be disappointed on the search for tickets, were long gone. Demand
had fallen to such a level that for the 1989 game at Hampden, to the
astonishment of commentators, tickets were still on sale the day before the
match.
Neither country desperately needed the money generated from the match anyway.
Their respective associations, with both Scotland and England on their way to
Spain for the World Cup finals, had a guaranteed #2m for taking part.
When the inevitable happened and Scotland was dropped from the Rous Cup the
talk was of the tie being suspended for a year or so. There was little outrage
or anger, but then few realised the ignominious 2-0 defeat at Hampden on May
27, 1989, was to be the last time the two sides were to meet in anger for seven
years.

<HEADLINE>The Irish census figures that cause the greatest anguish</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974831651</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MARK Dingwall (December 9) suggests that I am an ``apologist'' for Irish
Nationalism when I am no such thing. I am unaware of anything whatsoever in
Irish Nationalism for which apology is needed.
Mr Dingwall quotes figures from the 1881 Census, compares them to figures from
the 1981 Census and asks that we join him in concluding that the fall in
numbers of the various Protestant congregations over that 100 year period
reflected malevolence on the part of the Irish Government and people towards
the Protestant people of Ireland. Such a conclusion is not correct.
The writing had been on the wall for Britain's imperial occupation of Ireland
long before the Treaty of 1921. With the ending of the British Government in
Dublin its servants, military police, and officials naturally returned home, as
they would also later do from India and Africa. The surprise is not that so
many went but that so many stayed.
If the Census figures quoted by Mr Dingwall are not for me a cause of any great
anguish, those for the years 1841 and 1851 are. They represent a fall in
population in that 10-year period from 8,175,124 to 6,552,385.
Unlike the missing Methodists, these missing people died of starvation or were
forced into a penurious emigration as a direct result of British Government
policy. They did not return to their native homes as the returning Methodists,
Presbyterians, and Anglicans did.
By 1911 the population was down to 4,381,951, with more than a quarter of that
number being in the pampered Six Counties.
I did not, as Mr Dingwall suggests, say that the treatment of Jews in the
Republic ``is to the credit of Eamon de Valera''. What I said was that the
inclusion of a clear reference to the Jewish congregations and the recognition
of their rights contained in his Constitution of 1937 was a credit to de Valera.
Anti-semitism was a problem in Ireland as it was throughout Europe, not least
among the ruling classes of England. In Ireland shameful examples of
anti-semitism were the 1904-06 boycott in Limerick; the treatment of Robert
Briscoe in the 1927 election; the diatribes of Father Denis Fahey; and the
disreputable machinations of the political opportunist, Oliver Flanagan.
I cannot defend or excuse any of this, but disagree that it amounts to an
``appalling'' state of affairs.
Eamon de Valera's inclusion of the reference to the Jewish people of Ireland in
the 1937 Constitution served that people well.
As for the number of Protestants elected to the Dail, it really is irrelevant
when you consider the long and noble tradition of Protestant involvement in
Irish Nationalism - Tone, Parnell, Childers, and many others. The President,
Mary Robinson, even has one for a husband.

<TEXT>
CAN you explain by what criteria or protocol Chancellor Kohl was given such
prominence at the signing of the Bosnian peace treaty in Paris on December 14?
It seemed entirely incongruous that his large presence should loom so
gratuitously on this symbolic occasion, when arguably it was Germany's untimely
and precipitate recognition of the breakaway state (their allies in the Second
World War) without prior consultation and agreement of their European partners
(who then, sheepishly and ill-advisedly, followed suit, in order to preserve a
modicum or semblance of European ``unity'') that caused this war in the first
place.
Setting aside the ill-mannered insult to Britain and her armed forces, who with
France and others have contributed so magnificently to this eventual near
resolution, and will continue to contribute the second-largest contingent
through Nato, there were many more deserving of a prominent seat at the top
table than him, having risked lives and political popularity in joining the
United Nations' efforts to stabilise this Balkan problem.
Unless it can be shown that his bullying presence was vital - behind the scenes
- in securing this peace agreement, there would appear to be no possible excuse
for such gross and unwarranted hypocrisy on such an important international
occasion.
If France was purely grovelling to secure favours in respect of the single
European currency, she shows a cringeing lack of any pretence to be a nation
with any dignity or stature, and deserves no credibility among nations in the
world's first rank. Petain is alive and well! Petainism flourishes in 1995!

<HEADLINE>Kyle urges rethink on proposals for harbour</HEADLINE>

THE people of Kyle of Lochalsh are making a last-minute appeal to Highland
Regional Council to consider altering a development which is supposed to help
compensate the community for the loss of the Skye ferry but which might dash
hopes of it becoming a recognised port for yachts.
Kyle Prospect, costing up to #800,000, would involve tipping rock into some of
the harbour area between the old ferry slipways and the railway pier for
coastal protection, and building a road between the centre of the village and
the railway pier.
There is concern, however, that the plan could seriously restrict the sea area
in the harbour, eliminate one of the slipways, and leave a sea wall unusable by
boats.
Last week, Kyle Community Council agreed there was considerable merit in
counter proposals tabled by architect Iain Begg, who lives near Kyle. These
would see a vertical face being introduced in the new sea wall, creating a quay
which, with the addition of pontoons, could be developed as a sailing harbour
for up to 30 boats.
Local councillor Bill Fulton said Mr Begg's plan had already surfaced before
regional council and its supporters had been told that it would be horrendously
expensive. He said: ``If the money can be found, great, let's do it, because,
while the present plan is a good one, this would be better.'
Mr Begg said savings on rock-handling would keep the extra cost down. ``The
idea of Kyle developing as an important stopping off point for Scotland's
yachtsmen is enormously exciting.
``Where else is there where they could tie up quite literally within a few
yards of shops, hotels, and a railway station? There is even a swimming pool.
Yachtsmen spend money. It would also mean that the door wouldn't be closed on
the likes of a catamaran passenger service between Mallaig, Kyle, and Portree
which is being considered but which needs a slipway.
``All we are asking for is a little time. This development is being handled in
the same heavy-handed way as the bridge.
``There were over 20 objections and we expected a public inquiry but the region
sent it straight to the Secretary of State and like lightning it came back with
permission. A little thought now could mean that something of lasting benefit
is salvaged out of all this.''
A spokesman for the regional council said that if there were to be new
proposals, they should be made quickly: ``The Scottish Office has confirmed
that #250,000 has been ring-fenced in the new financial year for work on Kyle
Prospect. We will be making an application for matching support from the
European Regional Development Fund in February.''

<HEADLINE>Lone voice opposes colliery buy-out</HEADLINE>

ONE miner at Monktonhall voted against the buy-out to safeguard the future of
the colliery and the jobs of its workforce, it emerged yesterday.
He was a lone voice among the 158 miners who met on Saturday in Dalkeith to
vote on the financial package from Edinburgh-based Waverley Mining Finance.
Mr Jackie Aitchison, director of personnel at Monktonhall, which was closed by
British Coal in 1987 but reopened later by a miners' consortium, said the
miner, whom he did not identify, ``was entitled to say no''.
The deal sees Monktonhall Miners Ltd, which ran into financial problems after
reopening the pit, lose control to Waverley, which two years ago came in with
money to keep it going.
The buy-out, with #15m investment, will ensure new equipment to open up a new
face, double production, and create new jobs. The miners, who each invested
#10,000 when they took control of the pit, will all get thousands of shares
which will be unredeemable for three years.
Mr Aitchison said yesterday he was very pleased the deal had gone through.
``Obviously there is a tinge of sadness, with the whole ethos of owning the
mine being lost, but there is a great deal of enthusiasm and optimism with
continuity of employment and more jobs created.''
He said talks would be held today with prospective suppliers to firm up
business deals ``so we can really go to town on the new coal face''.

NATO'S Bosnia peace mission opened with a whimper rather than a bang today as
bad weather and red tape combined to delay the first American combat troops.
A train carrying 103 American soldiers from Germany, as well as tanks and other
armoured fighting vehicles, finally crossed into Croatia after a four-hour
delay at the Hungarian border.
They still did better than 800 US paratroopers forced to kick their heels in
Aviano, Italy, for a second day as low cloud and freezing fog prevented any
flights landing at Tuzla in northern Bosnia, where 20,000 American troops will
be based.
Nato diverted a few flights carrying men and equipment to Sarajevo, leaving
them with a six-hour drive to Tuzla over rough snow-bound roads.
The 60,000-strong Nato mission, the largest in the Alliance's history, got the
go-ahead yesterday after the Security Council authorised it to take over
peacekeeping from the much-criticised UN operation.-Reuter.

SCOTLAND'S rural population must feel that they have suddenly become flavour of
the month with not one but two glossy publications last week devoted to the
problems of those who live and work in the Scottish countryside.
The more comprehensive document was, of course, the Government's White Paper
Rural Scotland: People, Prosperity and Partnership which covered almost every
aspect of rural life.
Of more manageable size was the Scottish Landowners' Federation's contribution
Supporting the Countryside - Future Opportunities. It came up with a set of
problems and possible solutions.
The White Paper was strong on scene-setting but less impressive on providing a
clear indication of the way ahead. However, White Papers are there to be picked
over and represent a stage in the formulation of future policy.
For the ordinary farmer, both carry the implied threat of less support by way
of subsidies flowing from the Common Agricultural Policy. The SLF proposals,
leaving aside any possible reduction in payments under the CAP, want to see an
arrangement where support would cover a wider range of countryside activities -
including sporting activities and species such as goats or deer which receive
no support while sheep qualify for Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances.
Those who have been trying to establish a Scottish cashmere industry have been
pressing that point for some time and would no doubt back the landowners' case.
The SLF view is that the ghillie and the gamekeeper have as much right to see
their role in the scheme of things receiving financial support as have the
shepherd and the cattleman. They also promote the concept that part of the
claim for a share of central funds should be related to the number of jobs
provided by an enterprise. That seems a sensible way of supporting jobs on the
land. One of their declared aims is to reward ``all responsible land use''.
Not all agree. Councillor Rob Gibson, the SNP spokesman on land issues, is
suspicious and interprets the report as an attempt to shore up the finances of
sporting estates. He has a swipe en passant at the recently-formed Countryside
Movement and there we must agree with him.
An explanation of how that body is being financed would be welcome. Until such
information is forthcoming it must be regarded with caution. How many
organisations can launch themselves with a #3m advertising budget?
Compared with the Countryside Movement, the Scottish Office White Paper is
direct and to the point. One of its most practical suggestions is that village
shops which are in danger of going out of business should be eligible for rates
relief.
The Government recognises that the small general store or post office in a
rural village has a special social function, often providing an invaluable and
irreplaceable service for people without cars or ready access to transport. It
is also often a community meeting place and a central point of contact for a
dispersed community.
The Scottish Agriculture Minister, the Earl of Lindsay, has made clear his
personal wish to see the back of quotas and other limitations on production.
The White Paper sets out the Government's aim to press for cuts in
production-related support and for the targeting of remaining support on the
social and economic needs of rural communities.
``The goal of safeguarding and enhancing the rural environment should be at the
heart of a reformed CAP, with policy mechanisms geared towards specific
objectives,'' it states.
``Progressive reductions in production-related support can be expected to yield
large savings. While it should not be assumed that all savings would
automatically be available to farming - or that action at EC level would always
be the best way to approach environmental objectives - a substantial level of
public funding to secure environmental benefits would be justified.''
Emphasising the Government's commitment to agriculture, the White Paper points
out that direct subsidies amounted to #332m last year and could reach #400m
this year. That is a lot of money but there is a further calculation which
gives considerable point to that kind of support - ``It is estimated that the
loss of 1000 jobs in agriculture would result in the loss of 1442 jobs in firms
which supply goods and services to agriculture and a loss of a further 441 jobs
due to the resulting reduction in consumer spending.''
The annual gross output of agriculture in Scotland is put at around #1800m,
generating an aggregate income to farmers and their families of about #450m.
Some 68,000 people are engaged in agriculture - slightly less than half of them
are occupiers and the rest are employees or family labour. In all, agriculture
supports more than 200,000 people in related industries.
About 65% of farms are owner-occupied with an average net wealth estimated at
some #350,000 (which will come as a great relief to a lot of bank managers).
Tenanted farms account for the remainder, with an average net wealth of almost
#150,000.
Looking to the future ,the Government is proposing to establish local rural
``partnerships'' which sound rather like community councils under another
guise. They would be expected to concern themselves with topics such as
land-use planning, transport, use of natural resources and economic
development. The partnerships would be representative of local bodies rather
than individuals.
That concept seems to have caught the imagination of two organisations who
would expect to be deeply involved in putting some flesh on the policy bones
displayed in the White Paper - the National Farmers' Union of Scotland and the
Scottish Agricultural College.
John Ross, union president, forecasts that farmers will look forward to working
in the new partnership system. Professor Phil Thomas, principal of the SAC,
sees the proposals for partnership as constructive and forward looking. As for
me, I think it sounds like another quango.

AN international commission charged with overcoming the arms issue blocking the
advance of the Northern Ireland peace process, met two of the main peacemakers
in Dublin yesterday.
Former Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and Belfast-based Catholic priest
Father Alex Reid were among those to make submissions to the body at
behind-closed-door sessions in Dublin Castle.
The meetings followed 14 hours of talks with the Government and political
parties in Belfast, on Saturday, for former US Senator George Mitchell and his
team.
Today, during a second day of Dublin-based activity, the international panel -
also including former Finnish premier Harri Holkeri and Canadian Defence Forces
Chief John de Chastelain - will see Irish Cabinet Ministers and a Sinn Fein
delegation headed by party leader Gerry Adams.
Mr Reynolds and Father Reid saw the body separately for up to two hours each.
The two men were central figures in moves that led up to the IRA ceasefire in
late summer of last year.
In common with practice established when the commission met formally for the
first time in Belfast, few details emerged from the latest exchanges.
A signal of the importance attached to the arms panel came from Ireland's
Progressive Democrats opposition party chief Mary Harney, who said it ``held
the key to unlocking the impasse''.
She added: ``It is essential that all parties should agree to accept its
findings in full.''
Last week, there were signs that the Government - which is demanding IRA moves
towards arms decommissioning ahead of the entry of its Sinn Fein allies into
all-party talks on Northern Ireland - regarded the international body's role as
mainly advisory.
Senior Sinn Fein strategist Martin McGuinness made it clear yesterday, that his
party would be pressing the commission to examine secret reports on the
so-called shoot-to-kill policy of the Northern Ireland security forces.
q British and Irish Government officials ended two days of discussions in
Dublin last night, without resolving a row that threatens a summit in the
capital on Thursday, between Prime Minister John Major and his Irish
counterpart John Bruton, to give a pre-Christmas boost to the peace process.
The dispute is over an unrelated issue, centring on Britain's blocking of an EU
plan to aid the state-backed Irish Steel company. Further attempts to resolve
the row will be made over the next few days.

OVER the past few months, Britain's three Royal orchestras - the Royal Scottish
National, Royal Liverpool Phil, and Royal Philharmonic - have been
participating in the first Royal Orchestral Exchange, whereby each orchestra
has toured on the others' territory.
On Saturday, bristling with confidence (and fresh from having sacked its chief
executive for mismanagement), London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra completed
the Scottish limb of the exchange with its guest appearance in the Royal SNO's
winter season slot at the Royal Concert Hall. While the programme was
traditional fare - Wagner, Schumann, and Dvorak - the calibre of performances
was sky-high. The reason? Conductor Yuri Temirkanov was back in town. And
whether it was for Temirkanov, or soloist John Lill, or indeed just the novelty
of a London orchestra making a guest appearance, a big crowd turned out for the
occasion.
Did they get their money's worth? Did they ever. Temirkanov, who is principal
conductor of the RPO, was in storming form with his full repertoire of
conducting hi-jinks unleashed in a burnished and golden account of Wagner's
Tannhauser Overture.
His unique temperament - silky breadth and seamlessly-gathered phrases,
combined with an incredibly explosive sense of pace and attack - was lavished
on a sumptuous and volatile version of Dvorak's Eighth Symphony. That the RPO
musicians relish playing for Temirkanov could be measured from their own
applause for the wee Russian after every item.
Centrepiece was a performance of Schumann's fickle and emotionally complex
Piano Concerto to which pianist John Lill, playing with exquisite tenderness
and absolute composure, brought a rare clarity and stability: perfume-free
pianism, characterised by thoughtful poise, with Temirkanov moulding a
ravishing accompaniment.

IAIN CRICHTON SMITH, Grace Nichols, Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill, Michael Longley, and R
S Thomas: forget what these poets do on the page. A reading should be a
performance and poets, when they get up in front of an audience, should be
actors.
Here are some thoroughly eminent writers, working an Arts Council ``Five Cities
Tour'', and representing England, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland. But there isn't a real performer among them.
Michael Longley is a great storyteller. He is charming and funny when talking
about his work. But you don't get much more out of listening to him read than
you would from reading his books.
The same goes for Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill who works with Longley on reciprocal
Irish/English translations. It's not that the poetry isn't special in itself.
It's just that the reading merely mimics what is written when it should be
giving a new and different life to both the words and the performer.
Grace Nichols gives a calypso flavour to her reading and is the best of the
five at communicating verbal sensuality. But there are huge Caribbean rhythms
in the work which remain only half articulated on her voice.
Iain Crichton Smith and R S Thomas are poets of a quality that is indeed worthy
of an Arts Council celebration. But whether they celebrate it themselves is a
different question. Thomas is an old man whose austerity sits well with the
sand-blasted pessimism of his work. True, you catch a bravery in his voice
which is moving. But both he and Iain Crichton Smith (who reads as if the
audience doesn't really want to hear) give the distinct impression that
performing is secondary to writing. It should not be so.

NATIONAL Lottery regulator Peter Davis was under intense pressure last night to
resign as the outcry grew over the revelation that he accepted free flights
from a key stakeholder in Camelot.
The director-general of Oflot was said to be ``considering his position'' in
advance of a meeting to which he has been summoned today with the Permanent
Secretary of the Heritage Department, Mr Hayden Phillips, at which he will be
asked to explain the extent of his connections with GTech, which has a 22.5%
stake in Camelot.
Ministers have so far kept their distance in the increasingly bitter dispute
and may now feel they have no option but to fire Mr Davis.
The chairman of the powerful Commons Public Accounts Committee, Labour MP
Robert Sheldon, cast doubt yesterday on the likelihood of Mr Davis keeping his
job in the light of his admissions.
He said: ``He did have flights with the firm which received a very big
advantage in running the lottery. This is a great prize for them. You need to
have a certain amount of distance.''
He told BBC Radio 4's The World this Weekend: ``There was clearly a failure
there. It is necessary to have a much more distant relationship with those
people that you are regulating than we saw in this case. I think it will be
very difficult for him to justify the way he has acted in this case.''
Mr Sheldon, whose committee is calling for further evidence from Mr Davis, said
it was wrong that the man given the task of appointing the company to run the
lottery should then be allowed to act as its regulator.
``There should be a division between those who award the prize and those who
conduct relationships with those people who won the prize. It is quite easy
following the granting of this licence to try to justify your decision. You
say: `Look, I was right, these are splendid people.' If they prove to be
somewhat less than splendid, one is reluctant to say one was wrong,'' he said.
Mr Davis has admitted staying at the Long Island home of GTech non-executive
director Carl Menges, whose family has been friendly with Mr Davis's family for
20 years.
He told the Commons Public Accounts Committee last week that he had accepted
free rides in GTech helicopters and private jets during a tour of state
lotteries in America last year. He insisted his decision to use the aircraft
had been ``extremely economical'' and had saved taxpayers' money after he
travelled to America at his department's expense.
Mr Davis told one newspaper from his London home: ``I have no intention of
resigning. I have no reason to resign.''
Oflot yesterday refused to comment on newspaper claims that Mr Davis was ``on
the brink of resigning'' but conceded that it would be fair to say he was
considering his position.
On Saturday, Labour's heritage spokesman, Mr Jack Cunningham, called for Mr
Davis's resignation, saying he was guilty of exceedingly poor judgment. He said
he would raise Mr Davis's position again with Heritage Secretary Virginia
Bottomley today in the Commons.
The controversy took a new twist on Friday when Virgin tycoon Richard Branson
began libel proceedings against GTech, whose chairman, Mr Guy Snowden, he
claimed, had attempted to bribe him to drop his bid to run the lottery in 1993.
Mr Branson alleges that GTech, which denies the claim, has accused him of lying
and spreading an ``evil smear''.
Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat president, Mr Robert Maclennan, has expressed
concerns about the appointment of GTech as one of the companies running the
National Lottery, in the light of criticisms of the company's business
practices in the United States.
Mr Maclennan claimed yesterday on the BBC2 Scottish Lobby programme that GTech
had been ``up in the courts in many states of the Union, with criminal charges
running against their senior managers in some cases''.
He added: ``There is a very unpleasant smell about GTech which has been
reported in the Wall Street Journal.''
q A new report published today claims that the National Lottery has permanently
changed the spending habits of more than one in two Britons and dealt a massive
blow to some business sectors.
More than #2500m which used to be spent on food, leisure or traditional forms
of gambling, has been switched to the lottery in the past year, according to
the Henley Centre research organisation.

<HEADLINE>Prisoners have a right to be treated humanely</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>974831662</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE sight of Ministers defending indiscipline in prisons, on grounds of
economy, is profoundly shocking. Prisoners too have rights. Chief among them
the right to humane treatment, in safety, when society has decreed their
removal.
Given the loss of freedom, there is a case for treating them better than ever
before, if it leads to ease of administration, rehabilitation, and improvement
on their release.
The idea that jail should be hell is unacceptable, if only because so many
inmates have been wrongly convicted. No sentence should imply subjection to
physical and mental abuse at the hands of other convicts or warders, only a
removal from society, so that they are unable to repeat their crimes.
No civilised society should be willing to treat prisoners as other than
persons, deserving the utmost care, attention and help.
Yet, in privatising the prison service this ideal has gone, for, in business
decency is as nothing beside profit. So much was obvious from the beginning.
That Mr and Mrs West failed to treat other people as persons is no argument for
their mistreatment. On the contrary, society has an even greater duty to act
towards them as it would have had them act when free.
In Fred West's case we failed; we must hope that we do not fail his wife.
Moral concerns come before politics and economy. Wholesale privatisation is
undesirable. If it deprives a person of his freedom, society has a duty to
deprive him of nothing else; and supply every good in its power.
Even before privatisation, prison conditions were a scandal which no Government
has addressed. The entrepreneurs of the Tory Party have simply taken the matter
to its present, business-driven conclusion, which no moral agent would think
tolerable.

<TEXT>
YOUR editorial (December 9) on European Monetary Union once again conveys the
unmistakable odour of political prejudice since it contrives to ignore the much
greater problem which faces Western Europe, namely, how will it be able to
compete with the emergent economies of the Pacific Rim and elsewhere while
continuing to bear the existing high levels of social costs?
To suggest that, in the longer term, a European superstate will provide the
solution is to misread completely the nature of the technological revolution
now taking place.
Would your leader-writer anticipate the EU dispatching a couple of
aircraft-carriers to sort out the natives or does he believe that
straightforward prohibition by way of hefty import duties is all that will be
required?
I'm not at all sure that there are many who would see Chancellor Kohl's
motivation as being mainly the desire to be ``a good European'' and quite
unconnected with the enormous burden which Germany assumed on reunification
which rather pragmatically, of course, it would be willing to share with the
rest of us.
President Chirac, on the other hand, has little option but to continue with the
present struggle to meet the convergence requirements, well aware that to give
in at this moment would simply open the floodgates further and worsen the
French recession.
It has become increasingly clear that it is one thing to have a ``single
market'' trading agreement but full political and economic integration is quite
incompatible with current global developments which appear to indicate that the
balance of economic power is more likely to be held by smaller, autonomous, and
flexible entities acting in compact groups rather than with the vast, outdated
and unwieldy power bloc presently mooted by the current crop of Luddites.

SCOTLAND'S politicians indulged in a little flag waving at the news of an
England v Scotland clash in an arena where the Scots might actually stand a
chance of victory.
The impeccable behaviour of Scottish fans abroad was held aloft as a national
virtue to be defended as vigorously in the stands of Wembley as the national
team's improving footballing reputation.
n SNP leader Alex Salmond revealed hours after the announcement of the Euro 96
draw that the English were, in fact, ``a duff team'' and that with the Scottish
side ``coming along nicely'' a Scottish victory was in the offing.
But amid such confident speculation came a more serious warning over security
and the need to keep the skin-headed elements among the English ranks well away
from the Tartan Army lest the Celts lose their internationally esteemed cool
and be provoked into unseemly scuffles.
``The most important thing to make sure of is the protection of the reputation
of the national side,'' said Mr Salmond.
He said there was little doubt that the onus lay with the English football
authorities to root out potential trouble makers, particularly those elements
with a more than passing attachment to far-right political parties, who, he
said, had a tendency to hijack football matches, with the intention of
fulfilling their own squalid agendas.
The SNP leader also suggested that tickets should only be allocated to regular
supporters.
``There are real difficulties but hopefully, because England's reputation is on
the line, there will be enough effort made to stop trouble happening.''
n Preventing trouble was also laid at the feet of the English by Labour MP
Dennis Canavan, convener of the all-party parliamentary Scottish sports
committee, whose attentions of late have been focused on the behaviour of
bickering players rather than battling fans.
``I would hope that the English football authorities will take into account the
record of English fans in recent years but I have every confidence in the
Scottish fans. I think this gives Scottish football supporters an opportunity
to show that they are second to none in terms of good behaviour.''
n Labour MP for Motherwell North, John Reid, observed that if the game could
not be played on the fields of Bannockburn then Wembley arena was the next best
venue.
``I think when they cancelled the home internationals they did everyone a
disservice, because they were greatly enjoyed.''
He said that provided the game was not sensationalised, there was no reason for
the scenes witnessed in 1989 in Glasgow.
n Given the long lead-up to the game, football aficionado and MP for
Cunninghame North, Brian Wilson, saw no reason for the football authorities not
to get their house in order.
``There's plenty of time for everyone to adjust their thinking and to make the
necessary preparations. If it's properly planned there's no reason why this
should be anything other than a great sporting occasion.''
n Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West in London, last night declined to
talk in detail about security and potential trouble at the game, stating that
``it's a football match, not a war. It's not Bannockburn.''
A keen football fan and supporter of Chelsea, he said: ``What I am more
concerned about is the wretched nuisance of finding that two of our national
teams are playing each other. The chances are that one of the two will go out.
My instincts tell me Scotland will go out.''
Describing the English fans as ``the lepers of Europe'', he said: It's a matter
of eternal shame for the English - the Scottish don't have that reputation -
but I wouldn't worry about it, because we have acquired the skills to deal with
crowd trouble at football.''
n Another London MP, Bridget Prentice (Lab), said she didn't anticipate any
trouble from Scottish supporters and thought that the police would be able to
deal with any trouble caused by English fans.
Asked if residents of London would welcome thousands of Scottish football fans
descending on the city, Ms Prentice, who is a Scot, said: ``They have seen fans
from across the world arrive at Wembley and I don't think they should have any
more cause to fear fans from Scotland.''

SCHOOL sports champion Louise Hunter has been saved from a lifetime of
drug-taking by a pioneering operation that involved high-frequency radio waves
to correct a heart condition.
Louise, 11, was sports champion of her year but was often forced to sit on the
sidelines and watch friends play because she was plagued by serious chest pains.
Investigations by cardiologists at Dumfries Royal Infirmary and the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow revealed that she had two natural
pacemaking devices in her heart, causing it to race to three times the normal
rate.
Cardiologists call the condition Wolfe Parkinson White syndrome. Normal hearts
have one pacemaker, which regulates and keeps a constant heartbeat.
Powerful drugs that control tachycardia (extremely fast heartbeat) in adults
failed to deal with the symptoms in Louise Hunter's case and doctors were left
with no option but to go into the heart and carry out repair work.
Her mother, Mrs Ileen Hunter, of Moffat, said: ``Eventually, Louise suffered
worrying chest pains, not just playing games but in normal play with her
friends.
``We reached the point where she would come in from the garden clutching her
chest and we became more and more anxious. Beta blockers worked at first but
eventually failed.
``She was the sports champion of her primary six class at Moffat Academy but
often had to sit out during netball and her first love, football.
``It was not always easy to keep her spirits up when she had to watch her
friends on the pitch doing what she loved best. We dreaded heart intervention
because like most parents we were frightened, but we gave the doctors the
go-ahead.
``However, our worries were unfounded because the transformation in Louise has
been wonderful.
``She remained conscious throughout the whole procedure and listened to Oasis
on her sister's personal stereo.''
This pioneering method carried out by the Glasgow cardiology team involved
feeding a wire with a radio-frequency probe up to the child's heart from a vein
in her thigh under continuous electronic and X-ray guidance.
Yorkhill senior cardiac registrar Karen McLeod said: ``We wanted to repair the
heart using radio-frequency because we felt we could save her life-long drug
treatment. The alternative would have been several hours of open-heart surgery.
``The problem about keeping someone this young on heart medication is that
long-term use may result in side effects.
``Using continuous monitoring equipment we fed a radio-frequency probe into her
heart. The high-frequency radio waves created a temperature which cut off and
short-circuited the extra pacemaking device.''
The team at Yorkhill hope that the hospital's plans for a new catheter lab will
go ahead and that this will mean similar pioneering electronic treatment for
children throughout Scotland with fast heartbeat problems.
Louise Hunter, now back on the football field, said: ``I was very upset when I
thought I would have to give up sport but the treatment has made me feel so
much better.
``There are no more chest pains to frighten me and I can play as much sport I
as want now.
``This has also given me the chance to play in the boys' football team, which
was what I really wanted to do.''

Rushdie crashes
on Australian tour
SYDNEY: Author Salman Rushdie and two companions were slightly hurt when their
car collided with an oncoming lorry in Australia, according to television
reports. However, police and hospital officials in Milton, New South Wales,
refused to confirm that it was Rushdie, saying only that the three Londoners
were a 48-year-old man, a 30-year-old woman, and a 16-year-old boy.
Rushdie, who travels under strict security because of an Islamic death
sentence, has been touring New Zealand and Australia promoting his latest book,
The Moor's Last Sigh.
Leader `critical'
ATHENS: Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who has been on life-support
systems in hospital for a month, was in critical condition yesterday and
doctors were waging a ``titanic battle'' against a new secondary infection. The
doctors said the next 24 hours would be critical for the 76-year-old leader.
Murders down
WASHINGTON: The number of murders reported in the United States dropped by 12%
in the first half of this year, the largest decrease in 35 years, the FBI
announced. Officials said it was the the most dramatic drop in the murder rate
since 1960, the earliest year for which the agency has comparable figures.

assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has put the videotape up
for sale at a price of up to $500,000 (#333,000), his lawyers said. The
photographer, who remains anonymous, gave the tape to the commission of inquiry
into the murder but it has yet to be seen by the public. Rabin's widow, Leah,
said she did not want to see it and the fateful moment would remain with her
forever.
Eight massacred
PARIS: Some 30 Muslim guerrillas surrounded a village near Algiers, dragged off
nine villagers, and massacred eight of them in a nearby cemetery, a survivor
told an Algerian newspaper. The report said three men were beheaded with
hatchets and the other five had their skulls crushed with stones, or their
throats cut. The survivor escaped with a bullet wound in his leg.
UN vehicle hit
PORT-AU-PRINCE: A United Nations vehicle was hit by gunfire two hours before
polls opened in Haiti's presidential election yesterday. No-one was hurt. A UN
spokesman said it was an isolated incident and might not have been linked to
the poll.
Prince banished
PHNOM PENH: Prince Norodom Sirivudh, half-brother of Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk, has agreed to go into exile rather than face trial on charges linked
to an alleged assassination plot against co-premier Hun Sen. Sirivudh, who has
denied the charges against him, has been detained since November 21. His French
wife and three children were yesterday due to leave for France, thought to be a
likely place of exile for the prince.
Shops guarded
MADRID: Department stores opened throughout Spain for Christmas shopping
yesterday under police guard after Saturday's bomb attack by Basque terrorists
in Valencia which left one woman dead and eight injured. Police fear the
terrorists have launched a pre-Christmas campaign aimed at civilians after the
second Basque bomb outrage in six days. Last Monday a car bomb in Madrid left
six dead and 20 injured.
Strides a snip
NEW YORK: The leather trousers worn by singer Jim Morrison on the cover of the
Doors album Absolutely Live sold for $43,700 (#29,000) during an auction of
rock'n'roll memorabilia at Sotheby's at the weekend.

Madrid
PRIME Minister John Major faces renewed internal party strife this week after a
difficult EU summit where Britain's problems with the looming single currency
dismayed Tory Euro-sceptics.
Mr Major's post-summit claim that Britain is in a ``classically advantageous''
position on monetary union was aimed at calming Euro-sceptic back benchers
smarting at continuing rebuffs to the British on the EU's blueprint for
replacing national currencies with the Euro.
Euro-sceptics lost on three fronts in Madrid. They watched powerless as Mr
Major was forced to swallow the name of the Euro. Having won the right to opt
out of the single currency, the Prime Minister found himself with few friends
when the name was chosen.
Euro-sceptics also had to suffer a powerful reaffirmation at the summit that
the Euro will appear on schedule by 2002 after founder-member currencies'
exchange rates are irrevocably locked in 1999.
Rubbing salt in their wounds, the Prime Minister and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
then denied the sceptics a General Election manifesto commitment from the
Government to keep Britain out of a single currency during the next Parliament.
To quell the expected resurgence of unrest on the back benches, Mr Major left
Madrid eagerly talking up the advantages of Britain's right to opt out from
economic and monetary union (EMU).
His determination to prevent Britain ``tumbling into a single currency like
lemmings over a cliff'' was coupled with more hints about a referendum and his
insistence that the lonely British approach - with only the Danes for company -
is part of a UK-inspired ``rolling tide of realism'' in Europe.
However, little could hide the fact that Mr Major is increasingly concerned
that the whole EMU train could be moving away from Britain. This week, the
European Commission begins work on a massive publicity blitz to familiarise
Europeans with the Euro. The multi-million pound exercise should be paid for
mostly by the member states - which means that Britons stand to be the least
knowledgeable if and when the switch to the Euro is made. Critics of the
British stand point out that the Government spent almost seven years educating
the public before decimalisation in 1971.
Mr Major put his name to the so-called ``reference scenario'' which is the EU's
masterplan for the currency change-over. This means that EU states meeting the
economic conditions for adopting the new money will be known ``as early as
possible'' in 1998. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke believes this means March of that
year.
After that, the third stage of EMU will begin on January 1, 1999, as exchange
rates are locked. From then on, all monetary policy will be conducted in the
Euros, whose use will be encouraged in foreign exchange markets. New tradeable
public debt - mainly government bonds - will be issued in Euros by those states
in the pact.
By January 1, 2002, at the latest, Euro notes and coins will start to circulate
alongside national notes and coins. No more than six months later, the national
currencies will be history in those states adopting the Euro.
The Madrid summit also put the EU on course for what Mr Major called a historic
challenge when it decided on five other strategic changes to equip the
community for the next century.
After next year's crucial Maastricht II review conference, talks will open with
Malta and Cyprus, who are in the queue for EU membership along with 10
ex-communist countries of east and central Europe.
Agreement must be sought on funding the EU after the current spending programme
- agreed at Edinburgh in 1992 - expires on the last day of this century.
Mr Major called for ``fundamental'' policy reform in various spending areas,
arguing that, without changing the rules of the common agricultural policy and
aid programmes - accounting for most EU spending - the community would ``bust
the bank''.
Asked if he would call a referendum on the single currency, he said: ``I have
never ruled out the possibility of a referendum. I have always said it is
possible.''

Store raid
nets #50,000
DETECTIVES in Clydebank were last night hunting two armed men who stole a
five-figure sum, believed to be #50,000, from the Safeway supermarket in
Sylvania Way, Clydebank.
They entered the store as it was closing, tied up the store's manager and a
female member of staff, and stole the contents of the safe.
New strain
A SEVEN-week-old boy has died of meningitis in Newcastle upon Tyne General
Hospital. The death takes the disease's toll in the North-east of England so
far this month to four. A new form of meningitis has been involved in the
outbreak - officially diagnosed as sub-type 2A of meningitis meningococcal C
strain.
Death inquiry
POLICE in Edinburgh were last night investigating the death of Mr George
Bisset, 40, who had been in a critical condition in hospital with head injuries
since 1am on Saturday. He was found on the road at the High Street and Jeffrey
Street junction, near his home. Police are anxious to trace a man who came to
his aid outside the Royal Archer public house, which he frequented.
Sun on ration
TRAVEL agents are predicting a severe shortage of summer breaks next year. Tour
operators have reduced the number of holidays on offer by nearly a million to
protect falling profits and, as 4.3 million people who invested in Tessa
accounts in 1990 stand to receive a #12,000 windfall in the new year, demand
could be high.
Clan invitation
ASTRONAUT Neil Armstrong, who landed on the moon, is being invited back to
Langholm, Dumfriesshire, in March 1997. He last visited the home of the
Armstrong clan in 1972 to become a freeman.
Factory blast
ONE hundred workers at an Ayrshire fork-lift truck factory were sent home
yesterday after an explosion. A fire broke out in an electricity sub station at
NACCO manufacturing in Portland Road, Irvine, causing a power shutdown. Day and
night shifts at the former Hyster plant were cancelled but power will be
restored today.
Expensive tiff
AN irate husband hurled a briefcase full of cash at his wife in a row at the
weekend. The case, containing #500, missed its target and sailed over the
garden hedge at the couple's home in Grantham, Linconshire. Three passing
youths picked it up and fled.
#8.2m jackpot
ONE ticket held by a bar syndicate of eight in Kentish Town, north London, took
the top prize of #8.2m in this week's National Lottery draw. A further 23
tickets won #109,892 each. The numbers were 7, 8, 23, 28, 35 and 49, bonus 10.

<TEXT>
ALMOST 30 years of continuous patrols by Polaris nuclear missile submarines
will come to an end next year.
Ever since HMS Resolution successfully completed the first nuclear deterrent
patrol in 1968, a Polaris submarine has remained at 15 minutes' notice to fire.
However, three of the four boats have been decommissioned and the final Polaris
submarine, HMS Repulse, will leave active service in late 1996 when Britain's
nuclear deterrent will be carried by just two Trident nuclear submarines.
HMS Vanguard began her first operational patrol late last year and the second
boat, HMS Victorious, was accepted into service earlier this month. The
16,000-ton submarines are twice the size of the old Polaris boats and carry
much more potent D-5 nuclear missiles, although the Government insists the
total explosive firepower will be no greater.
The third boat, HMS Vigilant, is not scheduled to come into service until 1998.
The arrival of Vigilant will give the Royal Navy a ``fully robust'' capability
to use Trident for sub-strategic nuclear strikes as well as all-out strategic
nuclear war.
It will allow the Government to withdraw the WE177 nuclear free-fall bomb from
service with the RAF.

AS the century speeds towards its conclusion, a Glasgow woman is planning to
welcome the year 2000 by organising the biggest chain of Hogmanay parties the
world has ever seen.
With remarkable foresight, the widowed Audrey Mason-Wadsworth, a chartered
insurer with the J Rothschild Partnership, has already fixed up 30 venues in
the time zones of the globe, starting in Fiji, the first place to strike
midnight, and ending up back in the Pacific at Cook Island, where that same
moment is struck 24 hours later.
There are plans to televise the massive undertaking - and the energetic
Mason-Wadsworth, who lives in Paisley, has set up the Millennial Foundation, a
charity registered in Glasgow, and hopes to raise a staggering #700m, which
will be distributed locally, wherever the parties are held.
She herself plans to spend the big night in Fiji, hopping across the
international dateline to celebrate her second Hogmanay within a day.
A travel organisation has undertaken to transport revellers to the destination
of their choice, which can range from the Opera House, Sydney, to The Hermitage
in St Petersburg, the Palace of Versailles in Paris - or the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh.
The money raised for St Petersburg, for example, will be used for the
restoration of The Hermitage, that magnificent building now much in need of
attention, as well as for funding the Bolshoi Ballet.
The package to Fiji and the Cook Islands is costing #4400, which takes in a
nine-day round trip to the South Pacific by Air New Zealand and includes
accommodation at the best hotels.
For Mason-Wadsworth, whose hyphenated name has nothing to do with plummy
accents, it all began in the romantic setting of a beach in Tahiti when she was
on her way to a second marriage at Acapulco in 1988.
Before then, however, she had grown up as Audrey Campbell in the Newlands
district of Glasgow, daughter of an accountant. She left high school at 15 and
went straight into the insurance business, where she reached a substantial
position.
Her first marriage, to Dr Ian Mason, ended in divorce (he died six months
later) and she had reached that beach in Tahiti with her new husband-to-be,
Michael Wadsworth, when he suddenly raised the subject of the datelines and the
intriguing juxtaposition of Fiji and the Cook Islands, so near in distance, so
far apart in time.
Michael was particularly conscious of such things, having been the
youngest-ever navigator on the old Queen Mary before she went out of service in
the 1960s. Since both he and Audrey were in the insurance business, Michael
envisaged an investment policy scheme through which the public could enjoy the
2000 celebrations at 1988 prices.
Sadly, in 1992, he died of a perforated ulcer at the age of 48. But his wife
was determined to see his dream realised.
``We were great travellers and used to celebrate New Year abroad,'' she says.
``The highlight for us was being in Berlin when the Wall came down - and Berlin
is one of the destinations for the Hogmanay Party.''
An additional venue, now being pursued, could be the same Queen Mary on which
her late husband served. It is now a hotel and tourist attraction at Long
Beach, California, just 20 miles south of Los Angeles.
For her Millennial Foundation, Mason-Wadsworth has gained, as trustees, the
active support of Lord Lichfield, the famous photographer, his sister, Lady
Elizabeth Anson, well-known as a party organiser, and Magnus Magnusson.
As well as the trips to various destinations for the big party, there is one
extravaganza which takes you on a 28-day round-the-world air-cruise, including
Christmas at the Great Barrier Reef and New Year in the South Pacific. That
would set you back to the tune of #22,500.
Lord Lichfield will be taking his camera on that air-cruise and his
photographic evidence, along with that from the parties around the world, will
become the basis of a book, with words supplied by  Magnusson.
It is all a huge undertaking, depending so much on the drive and vision of one
woman, backed up by her project co-ordinator, Nicky Sheehan, who is operating
from an office specially set up in Sandyford Place, Glasgow.
If there is one thing Mason-Wadsworth doesn't want to hear about it is the
argument as to whether the century ends in 1999 or the year 2000. Plain
mathematics would suggest the latter but she is going ahead with her world-wide
party at the end of 1999, convinced that that is the date the world will wish
to celebrate.
The ring of ``2000'' will no doubt carry a magic of its own, whether it is
accurate or not!

<HEADLINE>Fox-hunting at Hill of Tarvit</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974831673</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE National Trust for Scotland's defence of its volte-face over fox-hunting at
Hill of Tarvit is disingenuous. This policy change marks the abandonment of any
attempt by the trust to take a neutral stance.
The Fife Foxhounds had never previously asked for permission by the council to
hunt over Hill of Tarvit. All that existed was an unwritten understanding that
the trust did not object - which was fine so long as fox-hunting was
uncontroversial.
In withdrawing this tacit permission the council did not make a moral judgment
on fox-hunting: it simply recognised that the achievement of the trust's
objectives would be needlessly hindered by polarising the membership into
opposing camps over what had now become an extremely divisive issue. And it
knew that no hunt had taken place for some years.
From day one, however, the trust's executive committee - a largely
self-appointed body in which land-owning interests have always predominated -
has lobbied to have this decision overturned.
The standard letter sent to those expressing dissatisfaction with the trust
over this issue acknowledged that the council might be persuaded to change its
mind ``as a result of the extent of the dissatisfaction expressed by members''.
This green light to lobbying led to the boycott of the trust by garden owners
throught Scotland's Gardens Scheme and encouraged the threat of withdrawal of
legacies and donations which so disgracefully influenced the council's
ignominious retreat.
The executive committee has sought legal advice as part of its campaign. The
trust's law agent has assured me that the decision taken in February was in all
respects constitutionally valid. What then is the contrary legal advice which
is apparently being used to justify a policy reversal?
Unless the public is satisfied that trust properties are held for the benefit
of the nation and not for some sectional interest, National Lottery funding for
future trust acquisitions may not be forthcoming.
Rev Archie T Black,
Member of Council,
The National Trust for
Scotland,

SCOTTISH Chambers of Commerce, Scotland's largest business support
organisation, will today put pressure on the Transport Secretary, Sir George
Young, to rethink the Government's approach to transport needs.
Sir George will be asked to form a new authority to ``co-ordinate and
orchestrate'' Scottish transport policy - one of the main recommendations of
the SCC's transport conference, Getting Scotland Moving, in March.
Sir George requested today's meeting with senior members of the SCC after the
publication of the post-conference policy document in July. Mr Gilbert Archer,
president of Scottish Chambers, and Messrs Peter Dunn and Geoff Runcie of
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, will represent the views of 8500 member companies.
Mr Dunn said: ``It is encouraging to see the Government taking steps to listen
to the business community. We intend to put a certain amount of pressure on Sir
George.
``The absence of a cohesive policy that integrates Scotland's road, rail, sea,
and air links with economic opportunity is frustrating Scotland's recovery from
recession and our ability to compete in Europe.
``Although the Government is currently conducting a transport consultative
exercise, this does not reflect the transport situation in Scotland. We will be
calling for a separate consultation exercise for Scotland co-ordinated by the
Scottish Office. We will offer to undertake this on the Government's behalf.''
The Scottish Chambers' representatives are likely to argue that there is
insufficient competition and business available in Scotland to attract private
investment in the Scottish rail network of the level required.

<HEADLINE>Slim hope of early launch for fat `vaccine'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974831676</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NEW wonder slimming injections to destroy fat and reduce appetite are still
several years away, according to scientists.
Even if they are successfully developed, they are unlikely to remove the need
for people to exercise and watch their diets, the researchers say.
The experts will be considering the quest for the ultimate slimming agent this
week at a meeting of the Biochemical Society in Aberdeen.
An estimated one in three Britons carries too much fat and one in five is obese
but the scientists played down news of antibodies that destroy fat cells and a
weight-regulating protein that cuts the weight of obese mice by almost a third
in two weeks.
Dr David Flint, head of the molecular recognition group at the Hannah Research
Institute in Ayr, who is working on a fat-destroying injection, said: ``I think
it would be wrong for people to start thinking that they can be vaccinated
against fat and they can neglect self-discipline.
``What we are looking at is something that we hope will reduce excess fat and
possibly depress appetite and provide individuals with a powerful incentive not
to get overweight.''
Antibody jabs have destroyed targeted fat cells in rats, rabbits, sheep, and
pigs but important questions have to be answered before they can be given to
humans, Dr Flint said.
For instance, what happens to the fat released from cells. ``They may release
triglycerides to be deposited somewhere else - somewhere potentially more
dangerous and threatening.''
It would take at least three years' further research, including testing for
side effects, before a human trial could be considered, he said.
To avoid the possible risk of affecting other tissue organs, this would involve
``local'' injections aimed at specific areas of the body such as buttocks, face
or legs, without affecting fat cells elsewhere.
As for the appetite-reducing protein, leptin, now being developed by a US
company, resulting from the discovery of a faulty gene in obese mice, Professor
Paul Trayhurn, head of the molecular physiology group at the Rowett Research
Institute in Aberdeen, warned it might be one of a chain of regulatory factors.
It was likely, he said, that only a tiny fraction of people had a defective or
mutant gene which inhibited leptin production. It was far more likely that,
just as some diabetics were resistant to the insulin in their blood, some obese
people could be resistant to leptin.
``The precedent set by the discovery of insulin suggests that with leptin we
are at the beginning of what will prove to be a long trail,'' he said. ``In
essence, people will still need to take regular exercise and employ proper
control over what they eat.''

THEY WEAR their hatred like a badge of honour, sneer-twisted faces and flailing
fists dragging the reputation of English football supporters to the lowest
level of hooliganism.
Overseas, in home grounds, and beyond the stadium gates, the behaviour of many
so-called English ``fans'' has offered Scotland a grim premonition of possible
trouble at the Wembley fixture next year. ``Where England goes, violence will
follow,'' says one football analyst, and the shared realities of a conjoined
nation may offer little protection against traditional enmity for the Scots.
Yet behind the footballing facade and the skewed team loyalty, behavioural
experts say the English soccer hooligan is motivated by more complex issues; a
deeply ingrained racial hatred and a culture of violence surrounding the game.
Psychological profiles of the typical hooligan generally come up with the same
print-out: male, working class, low achiever, right-wing, pack-minded, and
dependent on the support of others for social status.
It's a formula which has been exploited to good effect by the extreme right
wing, and the infiltration of the fascist element into the stands at club as
well as national level is well-documented.
In February the bloodied faces and torn terraces that marked the disrupted
England-Ireland game at Lansdowne Road were ascribed to a small core of
neo-Nazi supporters from the British National Party and Combat 18, the
far-right group linked earlier this year to an increase in football-related
violence. The ``18'' is said to stand for the first and eighth letters of the
alphabet; A for Adolph and H for Hitler.
In May there were reports that Combat 18 had already made plans to disrupt the
European Championships but in August of this year the officer in charge of the
football intelligence unit at the National Criminal Intelligence Service,
(NCIS), Detective Inspector Peter Chapman, said there was little evidence of
organised involvement by groups such as Combat 18 in soccer hooliganism.
He said they believed that those responsible for masterminding football
violence in England were a small group of about 350 to 400 ``kingpin
hooligans'' who co-ordinated the set-piece battles in and around football
grounds.
For Professor Rogan Taylor, of Liverpool University's Football Research Unit, a
gathering of English football fans - wherever they are - can be likened to dry
tinder which can be ignited at the slightest spark.
Taylor, who has studied the culture of football violence for many years,
believes the football hooliganism is part of a wider malaise of xenophobia and
violence that affects England as a country and can be exploited in the stadiums
by the far-right.
``This kind of thing runs very deeply in English society,'' he said recently.
``Not British, but English society. We saw in Dublin what was a rather big
eruption, but it's something that goes on every day in every town and city in
the country. It's not about the way people behave at football matches; it's
about the way people behave, full stop. At Lansdowne Road I think we saw a game
hijacked for political reasons by a reasonably well-organised group of 40 or 50
people. It's like dry tinder. You flash a spark and off it goes. It's an awful
cycle and a vicious cycle. When it goes off, children get hurt and upset and
the police get very, very angry. That drives on the English fans, who may have
fascists whispering in their ears.''
Glasgow University sociologist Bert Moorhouse, meanwhile, has always believed
that staging the European Championships in England was going to be risky.
``I think it's dangerous because the situation in English football is thought
to be somewhat pacified now with changes in the stadia, but there is a culture
among a certain group of young men which is `ready for a rumble' and I don't
think that's gone away,'' he said yesterday.
``I don't think the main problem will be in the stadia but in and around the
cities in which the matches take place. I would think there was a reasonably
good chance of there being trouble.''
Moorhouse said violence surrounding the game itself has also helped create the
culture of violence around the sport in general.
``Eric Cantona is a good example . . . or Duncan Ferguson being feted as a hero
in Merseyside. I would have to say that the game itself encourages the same
activities by the supporters.''
Moorhouse does not believe that there is a right-wing conspiracy behind the
violence that hangs around the English game, and he points to other nations,
such as Holland, whose football fans carry similarly tarnished reputations.
Others, likewise, have warned that it would be dangerously wrong to focus
purely on the English supporters next year. Analysts and anti-fascist
organisations say German, Italian and French neo-Nazi groups have organised
behind football fixtures.
The police, meanwhile, have refused to be drawn on which teams might offer the
worst chance of violence at the championships, but Susan Daniels, spokeswoman
for NCIS, said yesterday that they have been planning their strategy for the
past 18 months and are confident of their policing abilities.
The key element is the setting up of a national co-ordinating centre for the
duration of the championships which will be staffed around the clock by
football intelligence experts from all the countries taking part.
In addition, now that the draw has been made, NCIS will be drawing up a profile
of each country and its sporting traditions and will be developing a network of
``spotters'' to accompany fans to particular games.
Bert Moorhouse, meanwhile, acknowledges the efforts being made in general to
clamp down on trouble but thinks the championships may prove just too tempting
for the hooligan element, whatever their nationality.
``Europe coming to Britain gives an awful platform on which to display that
kind of behaviour,'' he said. ``I'm sure the people involved in that kind of
violence, who get a kick out of it, will be thinking: roll on June.''
Since the Scotland and England football teams last played more than six years
ago English fans have gone on to become the scourge of Europe. With the
European Championships to be held in England next year and Scotland drawn
against the old enemy, Herald writers examine the risks of organised hooligans
and neo-Nazis hijacking the games and what Londoners think about a return of

STEWART Lamont's article about me and asylum-seekers is disgraceful (December
16).
It is disgraceful first because of its misunderstandings of the facts. He is
hopelessly confused about two different proposals.
The proposals about social security benefit and the proposals contained in the
Home Secretary's Bill deal with separate issues. When I attacked the social
security proposals I was doing so in the name of the General Assembly and in
terms of the deliverance of 1994 on asylum-seekers.
For Stewart Lamont to call that ``clever chaps pulling the strings of the
Church publicity machine'' is simply ignorant.
More importantly, his article is disgraceful for its interpretation of the
facts. He has fallen hook, line, and sinker for the Government's line that
Britain is a soft touch, holding out a hospitable welcome to all sorts of
scroungers and disreputable characters.
This despite the Home Office's own research which shows that a high proportion
of asylum seekers are in professional, managerial, academic, or skilled
occupations who have much to lose in leaving their own country.
This despite the official United Nations estimate of 27 million people
displaced this year by persecution or war and only 38,000 of them seeking
asylum in Britain.
This despite the fact that 9000 Nigerians have sought asylum here since General
Abacha took power two years ago, and only four have been given refugee status.
A nation which sends 99.8% of asylum seekers back to the country of Ken
Saro-wiwa is scarcely a soft touch.
I could go on and on. Stewart Lamont completely misunderstands the issue about
insisting that claims be made on the point of entry. He fails to recognise that
the comparisons with other EU countries demonstrate not a generous Britain but
a new and hostile Europe.
He produces no evidence whatever to suggest that the rise in numbers of those
refused refugee status is proof of a huge rise in the number of scroungers
rather than a change in the way the rules are operated.
Almost the only thing poor Stewart Lamont has got right is that the Government
does intend to spend more money on asylum caseworkers and adjudicators, and
both he and I seem to agree that this might be a good thing.
What is most disgraceful about Stewart Lamont's article is the vision which
lies behind it: the vision of a cold, unwelcoming, inhospitable, nasty, mean,
isolated, ungenerous, cruel Britain.
I want Britain to be proud, strong, principled, brave, free, and generous.
Stewart Lamont may sneer at my use of words like justice and compassion, but I
am convinced that these values are the very things our country must defend.

FOR his first two books Tommy Ralston went back to sea. During a working life
on the waves he had enjoyed the worst of Scottish weather. He learned to take
the rough with the rougher. So some continuing choppiness was needed when he
sat down to write. He had to have a head of steam to get started.
When he wrote about herring fishermen he used a nostalgia so intense it was a
kind of rage.
His resentment was baited after a visit to the Maidens cottage of Turner
McCrindle, a legendary survivor of the Ayrshire fleet. In his great old age he
writes poetry. He keeps a 18ft open launch in the same spruce condition as all
the ring-net boats he ever owned.
``Ye'll hae seen the wee boat in the garden,'' Turner McCrindle told his guest.
``I gang tak the screenge (a small otter trawl) wi' her in the summer months,
jeest oot here below the hoose. We get a few plaice.''
He gives them away in turn to old people in the village who will make best use
of a fresh meal. Most of them are younger than he is.
Leaving Maidens, Tommy Ralston found he was becoming obsessed with Turner
McGrindle and men like him. They would die one day, with no tangible record of
how they had lived and worked.
``We daily watch so-called celebrities being fawned over by television
interviewers. These self-styled celebrities are mostly balloons filled with
nothing more substantial than their own egos. Why was there not a film producer
somewhere with the vision to capture something of the life which Turner
McCrindle and his wife led?''
For want of any scholarly outsider to record the history of the herring fleet,
Tommy Ralston decided to cast his own net.
From such an earnest, even anguished, embarkation he harvested his My Captains
(#6.95: Scottish Cultural Press), a bountifully human memoir - so funny and
couthy - based on his own time as a fisherman, first out of Campbeltown and
later mainly Mallaig.
He gives a glimpse of a Campbeltown skipper ``more noted for the noise he made
than for his prowess at catching herring,'' the author robustly recalls. This
worthy made himself immortal for a call he gave to his crew from his place in
the wheel house. He cried: ``Look and listen with all the eyes and ears God
gave you, boys, for my home's in a deplorable condition.''
There was the Jackson family of Tarbert, Argyll, of whom it was said with awe
that they could get a shot of herring on a patch of damp grass.
Tommy Ralston conceded he was at a loss to explain to outsiders the mystique of
the pursuit of herring with a ring-net.
``That there is some mystique is beyond doubt,'' he said at home in Lundin
Links. ``For instance, although there are dozens of poems and songs about the
herring, I know of none praising the cod, haddock, whiting, or prawn.''
Fishermen were closer to nature than now with their computers and sonar sets.
All of the senses, except taste, came into hunting herring. Some genuises so
developed their nose they could detect a distinctive raw smell on a sea loch
which meant a heavy concentration of fish underneath. Sharp ears could hear the
splash of herring playing on the surface. Look-outs eyed the behaviour of
cormorants and basking sharks.
Before echo sounders, wily human predators used a feeling wire. From the stern
of a slow-moving boat was trailed a length of piano wire. A trained hand could
feel the jerks of herring bumping into the line as it was towed through an
unseen shoal.
Tommy Ralston's knack in his My Captains - a title induced by poetry as he
explains in his book - is to make such arcane skills exciting to the most
land-locked reader. He frankly heightens the character-building qualities of
the trade. Without apology, he enhances the human interest of fishermen by
trawling through his autobiography some of the tall tales they told.
Much of the hunt for fish was about waiting. In cramped and cold conditions
crews tried to out-shoot each other with competitive storytelling. They showed
much the same ingenuity as went into their nicknames - Old Dubs, Neep, Rin Tin
Tin, Dodie Icey.
When Dodie Icey, from Gamrie, for a treat when he retired booked his first
ocean cruise, he was not short of advice from acquaintances who wished to share
their own experiences as deep-sea luxury voyagers.
Dodie was told that at some stage he would be invited to dine at the captain's
table. He retorted: ````Na, na, ah'm no' peying a' thae bawbees tae eat wi' the
crew.''
Tommy Ralston extends his chronicle to include the fishing communities and the
kind of people they bred. He recounts the raw riposte, insisting it is
apocryphal, of an old lady who lived at Ardvaser, Skye.
Because she had a sore throat she called the doctor, an English incomer, who
decided to cheer up his elderly patient with a small joke.
Sitting on a low chair, she had made no secret that she was wearing long red
underwear with elastic around the knees. When the young doc asked her to open
her mouth as wide as she could while he looked down her throat, he mused:
``Yes, I think that the medicine I have prescribed will do the trick. By the
way,'' he added, taking a second peer in the way that doctors do, ``I notice
you are wearing long red bloomers.''
``Ah, yes, doctor. Now while you are here, will you have a look up my bum and
tell me if my hat is on straight?''
When he gave up the fishing, Tommy Ralston became a fish buyer, while
accumulating 34 years of service as a lifeboatman. After 26 years as the
mechanic, he became for eight years the coxswain. People took to identifying
the Mallaig lifeboat as the Tommy Ralston boat. It became a bit like that for
him.
He recalled: ``I was given a boat worth #1m. That was my boat. I did with it
what I wanted. It wasn't until they wanted it back that it suddenly dawned on
me it wasn't my boat at all.''
Retirement did not come easily to him aged 55.
He recalled: ``I got up one morning and went through to the living-room and saw
the lifeboat going out. Without me.
``There had been no pager, no phone call, nothing. I thought that's not fair.
That's my boat, my crew. Where do they think they are going?''
He turned from the window to Ina, his wife: ``That's enough. We are out of here.
``There is no way that I could stay and see the boat that meant so much to me
going out with somebody else in charge of it, going places, doing things I
don't know anything about.''
The Ralstons upped anchor to another house that is also on the coast, but of
Fife. At Kirkland College in Methil he took computer classes. ``I learned how
to turn it on,'' he said. Out of his early life he hooked My Captains.
Whereas his first book started because he became irked about how little had
been written about the herring fishermen of yore, the annoyance that cradled
his second book struck him from an opposite quarter.
Almost too much attention has been paid to the exploits of lifeboatmen. It
peeved him how little of the output was recognisable from his own experience.
He felt rocked enough to sit down and start writing again. In To the Edge, a
working title, he has aimed to bale out some of the foamier prose and remove
the wilder fancies which that have become encrusted to lifeboatmen.
``Lifeboatmen can't walk on water,'' he said. ``Superior beings they are not.
They make mistakes. But some of them start to believe the rubbish that is
written about them.''
Without scooping his own book, Tommy Ralston described an infuriating encounter
that pushed To the Edge on to his word processor.
He was working on his boat when a visiting lifeboatman stopped to yarn. ``He
was the coxswain on an English lifeboat who was wearing his coxswain's hat. On
holiday!'' he exclaimed.
``He came up to me on the pier. `Hi,' he said. `I'm so and so. You will have
read about the silver medal I got. Well, I'll tell you how it all happened.'
``I couldn't believe what I was hearing,'' Tommy Ralston said. ``I had to tell
him to leave me alone. I was quite rude to the fellow. Maybe, I should have
taken time to tell him that lifeboatmen are ordinary, normal folk. They are not
special.
``They are all like-minded, but so are the people who join a golf club or a
swimming club. They are people who are interested in the sea who want to put
something back into the sea, if you like, including people like me who have
earned a lot of money out of it.''
He conceded they were different from other seafarers: ``Everybody becomes
attached to boats to a degree: a puffer, a fishing boat - fine. It's a means of
making a livelihood. A lifeboat isn't.
``And when you do something in a lifeboat it can be quite dramatic. Very often
you are going out when other boats aren't. You are going out when they are
coming in.''
He volunteered a small insight into his style as coxswain. ``When we were at
sea, there was a committee formed. But I was the sole member. Everybody had an
equal democratic right to say nothing, except me.''
Despite the popular success of My Captains he wondered aloud about whether he
had the writing ability to tell truly how life is on a lifeboat. In the way of
an old fisherman, he told a story.
``With an Arun - which was the class of boat we had in Mallaig - I would trust
it absolutely anywhere. If there is a better boat in the world, I haven't seen
it.
``We were taking the boat back to Mallaig - we were on a passage, not doing
anything - and we came round Ardnamurchan Point. It was blowing a screamer from
the south-east.
``People with longer memories than me said they hadn't known that strength of
wind for 60 years.
``Between Ardnamurchan and Mallaig I wish I could paint a word picture.
``In the wheelhouse you were sheltered from the elements. It was warm. There
was a heater going. All the lights were screwed down as low as they could go.
It was about black.
``But there was a constant torrent of cream water across the boat. Yet you had
total, utter confidence in the boat and machinery. . . '' he paused.
``And I didn't want to go into Mallaig. I just wanted to carry on. Because when
you get in you are speaking to people who are different from us. They don't
know what it is like. They have never experienced it. It is why lifeboatmen
want to stay there in their own wee group.''
To the Edge is hoped to be published in the autumn. Until then Tommy Ralston
offered the hint that one memory it will contain was how the Mallaig boat once
took part in a mountain rescue. Meanwhile, aged 59, he thought he might try a
novel. Whatever piece of gritty irritation may have started that idea he kept
to himself.

TWYLA THARP has produced a wonderful Christmas present: a thrilling and daring
three-act ballet for the Royal Ballet set to the music of Rossini. Mr
Wordly-Wise (as a character in the ballet he acquires a hyphen) is a selfish
show-off, intent on occupying centre stage.
Successful at business, he experiences a dark night of the soul along with his
apprentice, Master Bring-The-Bag. Help is at hand, a Mistress Truth-On-Toe,
who, in the second act, reveals a vision of heaven. This helps transform
Worldly-Wise into a man in a state of grace. In the third act he dies and
enters Elysium, leaving Bring-The-Bag as his heir.
Don't expect a modern dance epic from the choreographer. Here is a witty,
oblique tribute to classical dance that shows this company in the best possible
light. There are splendid opportunites for Irek Mukhademov at his most mesmeric
as the selfish hero.
Tetsuya Kumakawa, as the apprentice, flies, leaps and spins in a way that would
give Wayne Sleep (in his prime) a run for his money. Darcy Bussell is at her
most commanding when giving a dazzling account of the only principal female
role spiced with wit and danger.
A tip-top quartet of subsidiary soloists: Leamme Benjamin, Deborah Bull,
William Trevitt and Stuart Cassidy front a corps de ballet, all at their
considerable best. Tharp's wonderfully imaginative choreography is matched by
David Roger's splendid setting and costumes which include some amusing and
unforgettable vegetables. The whole evening is a triumph for the Royal Ballet.

LABOUR yesterday accused the Scottish Office of wasting more than #400,000 of
taxpayers' money in the introduction of the new water and sewerage authorities.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, made the claim after a
written question in the Commons to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Mr Forsyth said in reply that the Babtie Group, a firm of consultants, had been
paid #407,000, under two contracts, to assist with the transfer of water and
sewerage assets to the new authorities.
Mr Robertson said: ``The removal of Scotland's water from democratic control is
scandalous enough. It is even more disgraceful that the taxpayer has to pay for
this loss of democratic accountability.
``These are just the figures to date. Labour will be tabling questions to find
out exactly how much in total the Babtie Group stands to gain from these
lucrative contracts.''
Mr Robertson also released a letter in which Mr Forsyth says he is considering
how to calculate the costs incurred by the new unitary councils in billing and
collecting water charges on behalf of the water authorities.
Mr Forsyth says: ``We have issued a consultation paper suggesting a figure of
4% of the amounts collected. That is within the range of administrative costs
currently incurred by the regional and island councils.
``It is, I acknowledge, at the lower end of the range but ......there is no
reason why all authorities should not match the performance of the best.''
Mr Robertson said: ``Michael Forsyth blithely assumes that all councils will be
able to meet the cost of billing and collection through greater efficiency.
``But the reality is that we will now have 32 authorities responsible for
billing and collection, where before we had only 12. Thus, huge economies of
scale will be lost and the cost of billing is likely to rise, not fall.
``The price of lower water charges will be higher council taxes and poorer
services.''

<HEADLINE>Lack of cash again curbs scope of avalanche alerts</HEADLINE>

ALMOST half the number of climbers killed in avalanches in the past seven years
perished in areas not covered by Scotland's official avalanche prediction
service.
As the service today begins its eighth year of warning climbers and hill
walkers of the threat, the Scottish Office is coming under fire for not
extending the service to cover all the dangerous peaks.
A #5000 Scottish Office survey of hill walkers and climbers is being carried
out this season for their opinions on covering more areas.
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service, run by Cairngorm climbing veteran
Blyth Wright, this morning resumes its daily checks of the northern Cairngorms,
Lochaber, and Glencoe.
They post regular warnings on the Internet, mountain car parks, and on a
telephone hot-line and fax-back services. The telephone numbers are the police
recorded message, 01463 713191 and fax back 0374 506999, a standard rate call
subsidised by the Met Office.
However, areas such as Torridon in Wester Ross, Lochnagar in Deeside, and Creag
Meggaidh in the Loch Laggan area are still not being monitored.
In the last seven years, there were 23 avalanche victims, with 11 of them in
uncovered areas. Six of them (two each) were in the emergent black spots of
Torridon, Creag Meggaidh, and Lochnagar. The five others were distributed
around the country.
Although there were fewer avalanches than previous winters, more people were
killed than ever before.
It emerged yesterday that an official request by Lochaber Mountain Rescue team
for Creag Meggaidh to be included last winter was rejected because of lack of
funding.
Ms Catherine Herd, 28, a Peterhead doctor, was killed in an avalanche in
Torridon in January. The result of a fatal accident inquiry into her death six
months ago is still awaited.
Her mother, Margaret, said yesterday: ``Some lives are going to be lost with
this service not being introduced in those areas this winter.
``If warnings were comprehensively available in the past, then some of those
victims may well be alive today. Anything that contributes to mountain safety
is of tremendous value but it needs to be in place now.''
Sir Russell Johnston, the Inverness, Nairn, and Lochaber MP, said: ``It seems
extraordinary that a review has not been undertaken more urgently. It is not
likely to produce any kind of result until after the most risky part of the
year is over.
``If one third of deaths occurred in areas not covered, then swifter action to
extend the SAIS should have been taken.''
Mr Wright says it will cost around #20,000 in each area for the service to give
complete cover.
He called upon public bodies such as Highlands and Islands Enterprise to
consider funding the service.
Mr Wright said: ``It costs about #120 a day for two observers to go out and
check the dangers. They can only assess the risk by going into
avalanche-threatened territory themselves.
``We have had a number of incidents but, fortunately, no-one has been hurt.
They take elementary precautions like roping themselves together.
``But it is fact that we have never had a fatality in an area covered by us
where a considerable or high hazard factor has not been identified.
``There were two triple fatalities in Buchaill Etive Mor in Glencoe this year,
accounting for half the death toll. But in both those cases, we had issued a
high hazard warning.
``There is a tragic lesson to be learned there.
``Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team asked us to include Creag Meggaidh last year,
after one climber was avalanched, but we couldn't because we didn't have the
cash.
``They recognise the benefit of the service because they have only had one
fatality due to an avalanche on Ben Nevis since we started.''
Since the SAIS was introduced in 1988, the number of fatal avalanche accidents
has fallen by around 40%.

TWO masked men used axes yesterday to force their way into a church house in
Milngavie and steal more than #1500 from the weekend's collections.
Included in their haul were the proceeds from a special collection, estimated
at #1000, which was destined to help needy children throughout Glasgow.
The incident, at St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, involved the press
secretary of Cardinal Thomas Winning, Father Noel Barry, 39, who is assistant
priest at the church.
Police said both Father Barry and the 61-year-old female housekeeper, who has
not been named, were uninjured but were badly shaken.
The men, wearing balaclavas and carrying axes, arrived at the front door of the
house, which is behind the church, at about 4.45pm.
One held the housekeeper and demanded to know where the collection money was
kept. She pointed upstairs to the office of Father Barry.
When the other man entered Father Barry's room, he showed them the money, which
was stored in eight carrier bags in the dining room. They put the bags in a
holdall and fled.
Father Barry said last night: ``It was a very unpleasant experience. But when
you see someone threatening a woman with an axe, you can hardly refuse.''
Parish priest Father Michael McCabe, who was at a service elsewhere when the
raid happened, said last night the money stolen had been collected at four
services over the weekend, when a total of more than 700 parishioners had been
at church. It was to have been banked this morning.
He said: ``I suppose this is very much a sign of the times, but it is
especially sad when the people who are most affected are the poor in Glasgow.''
Catholic Church spokesman Father Tom Connelly said yesterday had been
designated by the Archdiocese of Glasgow as Caring Sunday, when church members
were urged to think of the needy and give generously to the Pastoral Care
Trust, set up several years ago by the then Archbishop Winning.
Detectives at Maryhill police station are leading the hunt for the two men,
both of whom were wearing dark clothing. One is 6ft tall, the other about 5ft
6in. They escaped in a small, light-coloured car.

POLICE last night launched an investigation after the discovery of a woman's
body in Kilmarnock.
The woman, who has not been identified, was discovered at around 3pm in
McKinlay Crescent, behind the Stagecoach bus depot. Police are treating her
death as suspicious.
Strathclyde Police would not confirm whether the body was that of a 16-year-old
girl who had earlier been reported missing.
A forensic examination is being carried out to establish the woman's identity.
With the area around the bus depot sealed off, Stagecoach warned that its
services in and around Kilmarnock would be severely disrupted today.
All Stagecoach school services have also been cancelled.

RUSSIA'S Communist Party took an early lead in yesterday's parliamentary
election, according to the the first official preliminary results from Far
Eastern regions hit hard by free market reforms.
The initial results were only a fraction of the total results due to trickle in
throughout last night, but they showed the mainstream communists took about a
fifth of the early vote in 12 of the country's 89 regions.
Most opinion polls published before the election showed that the Communist
Party led by Gennady Zyuganov could emerge as the single biggest faction in the
State Duma lower chamber of parliament.
Such a result might put pressure on President Boris Yeltsin to slow reforms.
But as he voted yesterday the 64-year-old Kremlin chief was adamant that the
present course would be maintained whatever the election outcome.
Asked if a communist comeback was possible, Yeltsin growled: ``No, and no
again.''
However, the first preliminary results showed a clear swing in favour of the
communists who were not taking votes from pro-reform parties but from
ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party.
The Communist Party won 20.9% of the vote in the party list section of the
vote, with Zhirinovsky's party in second place with 15.2%.  Half of the 450
Duma seats are allocated to parties under proportional representation. The rest
are individual constituencies.
Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalists were the strongest party in the Far East, and
in the country as a whole, in the previous election two years ago.
Electoral Commission chief Nikolai Ryabov said the figures were from 220
polling stations out of a total of 3000 in the Far East and 93,000 in all
Russia.
The only definite information on voting issued so far was on the turnout, which
easily surpassed the 25% barrier required to make the polls valid.
Presidential aides said the turnout was likely to be higher than 60% and
indicated that this would boost the chances of reformers and restrict a swing
towards the Communist Party.
q Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Social Democrats scored a major political
victory in Austria's snap elections yesterday, while the far right suffered its
first electoral blow since Joerg Haider became leader in 1986.

EXCLUSIVE. UNDETERRED by the Govan selection debacle with its accusations of
racism, a leading Asian lawyer in Glasgow said yesterday he was considering
standing as an MP.
Mr Dilip Deb, who specialises in criminal and immigration law, said he had been
approached informally about standing as a prospective parliamentary candidate.
However, he refused to say which party had targeted him and which constituency
he might fight to become the first Asian MP in Britain.
Mr Deb, who lives in the west end of Glasgow, refused to be drawn into
speculation that he had been tapped by the SNP. The SNP moved at the weekend to
make political capital out of the Govan debacle when Mr Bashir Ahmed, convener
of Scots Asians for Independence, urged all Asian people in Scotland to join
the movement which had been warmly welcomed by the nationalist party.
However, Mr Deb emphasised that he had no fear about racism if he were to stand
as an MP. ``Racism doesn't bother me. There will be some people who will not
like my face but I may not like some white faces. That doesn't mean to say I
hate white people. Why should I?''
Mr Deb said that, despite claims to the contrary by Mohammed Sarwar's
supporters, there had been no racism involved in his defeat.
Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson won the Glasgow Govan selection last week by a
single vote on a count-back procedure. The 245 for Mr Watson were matched by an
identical figure for Mr Sarwar. Of the 18 voters for candidate Margaret Curran,
17 had expressed a preference and when these were redistributed it ended in a
dead heat. The rules were then invoked to go back to the first ballot in which
Mr Watson had won by 237 to 236.
By then, 52 votes had been ruled ineligible - a majority of them supporters of
Mr Sarwar, fuelling claims of racism by his backers.
Mr Deb said: ``I have been inundated by Asians to talk about this point. There
was no racism involved on the face of it.''
He added: ``As to standing as an MP, I may have difficulty accepting because of
family and business committments. But if I did stand I believe I would get a
fair crack of the whip.''
Meanwhile, SNP leader Alex Salmond has written to Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson challenging him to explain how he intends to undo the damage
to Scotland's image which Labour's activities in Govan had caused.
Mr Salmond said: ``The media coverage of the Govan shambles has undoubtedly
damaged Labour's reputation but most Scots will be much more concerned with how
the events of the past few days reflect on the image of Scotland in general.
``As a young man put it when interviewed outside Glasgow's central mosque on
Friday, Labour's performance reflects badly on Scotland.
``Labour's activities are causing severe embarrassment to them but also great
damage to how people view Scotland. Labour Party members have been accused of
racism, nepotism, and fraud and that is just by other Labour members.
``The activities of the Labour Party in many parts of Scotland are becoming a
byword for all that is worst in public life and have brought discredit to
Scotland. The Govan debacle is simply the latest item in a long and shameful
list.''
Last night, Mr Jack McConnell, Labour's Scottish general secretary, said all
complaints about the Govan selection process ``will be thoroughly looked into
in a fair and consistent manner.
``There is no reason for anyone to take any pre-emptive action before the NEC
meets on January 24''.
He added that Mr Salmond's intervention was crass opportunism.
``He would be better off healing the divisions in his own party. If the SNP had
any candidates anywhere of the calibre of Mike Watson or Mohammed Sarwar they
would be in a better position to comment.''

THE Government has been asked by Labour to explain what it claims was a
``disgraceful waste'' of #300,000 of public money given to a Scottish company
to help it move from an unemployment blackspot to an area where the jobless
rate is below the national average.
The money was used by Heatovent Electric Ltd as a deposit for the purchase of a
#1m factory in East Kilbride but, according to Labour's Scottish employment
spokesman John McFall, the cost of the deal and other costs related to the move
later caused the firm to go into receivership.
Mr McFall said the company, which makes storage heaters and was previously
based in Possilpark, Glasgow, with a staff of 96, decided in 1993 to seek new
premises because its plant was run down.
The Scottish Office gave the company a #300,000 regional selective assistance
grant (RSA) to help it move to East Kilbride.
Unemployment among males in Possilpark stands at about 37% and 13% for females,
while the corresponding figures for East Kilbride are 11% and 4%
Heatovent then used the grant as a down payment on a 53,000sq ft factory at the
Kelvin industrial estate and was assisted in this by the East Kilbride
Development Corporation.
It is believed that the #1m paid for the factory and another similar amount
which the move cost, together with a downturn in orders, caused cash-flow
problems for the firm and, despite a healthy order book, it went into
receivership last month. Many of the workers employed at the Possilpark plant
felt that travel costs and other circumstances made it impossible for them to
move with the firm.
Mr McFall, MP for Dumbarton, said yesterday he had written to Scottish Office
Minister George Kynoch asking why the #300,000 was used to, in effect, transfer
jobs out of an unemployment blackspot.
Mr McFall has asked the Minister to undertake a full review of the criteria
applied for issuing grants under the RSA scheme, and says the stated criteria
is that grants should be given either to create new jobs or safeguard existing
ones.
A spokesman for the company could not be contacted yesterday.

CULTURAL industries in Scotland are as important to employment in Scotland as
North Sea oil and gas and the insurance industry, a report published by the
Scottish Arts Council today shows.
The analysis of Government population census statistics reveals that 2% of the
working population - 46,000 people - is employed in Scotland's cultural sector.
The cultural industries themselves employ 29,000 - compared with 30,000 in
insurance and 28,600 in oil and gas extraction - while a further 17,000
writers, visual artists, and musicians work in the manufacturing and service
sectors.
The reliance of the Scottish economy on the arts is outstripped only by London
and the Home Counties. Outside the South-east, Scotland has the largest number
of people working in libraries, museums, art galleries, and newspapers.
Scottish Arts Council director Seona Reid said Scotland was under-represented
in film broadcasting and sound recording, where London is overwhelmingly
dominant, but that in other areas the report supported the council's case that
the cultural industries were of significant economic importance.
``This study bears out what we have been saying for some time - that the
cultural sector is an important provider of employment not only for artists but
also for individuals with non-cultural occupations,'' she said.
The report, based on analysis of the 1991 census, offers a specifically
Scottish perspective on work commissioned by the Arts Council of Great Britain
- now the Arts Council of England - covering the whole of the country. It also
shows that cultural occupations in Scotland are dominated by men, who make up
65% of the workforce, with the exception of a few jobs, including clothing
designers (92% of whom are female), and librarians (70%).
Gaelic speakers are also better represented in the arts than the rest of the
workforce, with 4% of actors, entertainers, and directors, and 3% of writers
and journalists.

Professor William Lever looks at the new plan's priorities and the conflicting
needs it must fulfil.
ANALYSIS
Analysis: THE Clyde Valley, with the Greater Glasgow conurbation at its heart,
has had more town and regional planning in the post-war period than any other
part of Britain.
Starting with the Clyde Valley Plan of 1946, and the Central Scotland White
Paper of 1964, regional planning re-appeared with the West Central Scotland
Plan of 1974. Now in the new Strathclyde Structure Plan 1995, the planners
leave behind a message for the new authorities, a very necessary document if
planning in the West of Scotland is not to become divisive and fragmented on
the conflicting aspirations of the new unitary authorities.
The document is clearly a child of our times. It reflects the growing problems
of the recessions of the early 1980s and the early 1990s, concerns about the
environment and pollution, and the growing need for greater competitiveness in
the global economy.
What are the planners' main concerns? Significantly three out of the five
``strategic aims'' are green - to protect the environment, to use resources
carefully, and to minimise pollution. The other two are to strengthen the
regional economy and to reduce deprivation and social inequality.
The region has to tread a careful line between the three objectives of economic
efficiency leading to more jobs and income, of equity from a fairer share out
of the jobs and income, and of environment - making sure we do not ruin it.
It is not an easy line to define: planners are now aware that too tough
legislation on environmental protection in north America and the Netherlands
drove investment and jobs away to states and cities where there was less
planning and environmental impact analysis.
But, on the other hand, who would relish the task of seeking to attract
increasingly mobile investment which pays high regard to ``quality of life'' to
a Strathclyde polluted and spoilt through a too lenient environmental policy?
Some of the forecasts see the future as an extension of the past - the
pollution will continue to decline, the number of jobs will decline as the
growth in service employment falls short of making good the job losses in
manufacturing, and the gap between the haves and the have-nots will widen.
However, some things will change. More emphasis will be put on public transport
and fewer roads will be built to accommodate the private car, the movement of
the affluent white-collar workers to attractive villages and small towns will
be controlled through the supply of land and planning permissions, and the
movement of offices and retailing to the edge of the conurbation will be slowed
or stopped for fear of creating what in America is called the Edge City,
structured like a doughnut with nothing and no-one in the empty centre.
The result will be a redensification of the urban centre. Glasgow's population
loss will slow as jobs and residential population are brought back. This trend
is not entirely new, but in addition to high-profile developments such as the
Merchant City and the Broomielaw, much of the spare space and improvable
housing will be used to boost the city's density and image.
How different this is from the 1960s and early 1970s when the only solution to
the economic, environmental, and social problems of Glasgow was to take them 10
or 20 miles away and tackle them in Cumbernauld or Irvine, Easterhouse or
Drumchapel.
Just as the environmental lobby has taught us to recycle glass or paper or
cans, now we are recycling the city, reusing the buildings, the spaces and the
infrastructure, whereas 20 years ago we would have thrown it away and bought
new. This way we save on resources, lower the costs of services, and make shops
and communities more viable - and, perhaps as the sociologists would have us
believe, get back the old urban neighbourhood values of mutual support and
security.
Support is there also for the communities outwith commuting distance of the
employment centres and services.
However, the message is clear - Strathclyde only works if the conurbation
works, and the conurbation only works if Glasgow works. As the report pauses
for a reprise before unpacking its thinking into different elements such as
housing, offices, transportation and recreation, it declares ``the city centre
and town centres are focal points of community life ..... and therefore the
condition of these centres is important to the external image of the region and
the pride of place of its residents''.
What does the structure plan mean for the man on the Dennistoun bus, on the
blue train to Helensburgh, or in the car from Eaglesham: almost more
importantly what does it mean for the Japanese investor or the Eurocrat in
Brussels?
In terms of housing, the region will need 70,000 more houses by 2001. More use
will be made of brownfield sites (land which has already been used), more than
80% will be for sale. The urban centres will be more compact and fewer people
will be dependent on the local authority for housing.
Upgrading of the housing stock will remain a priority, often in areas where
employment creation through improvement is an important part of an urban
regeneration strategy.
For industry and business the planners will need to guarantee a supply of
suitable sites amounting to 500 hectares over the next 10 years - with priority
given to sites such as the Clydeside at Clydebank and Inverclyde, and
industrial recovery sites such as Ravenscraig, Linwood, and Inchinnan.
Not much is said about office space except that there is quite a surplus and
rents are low. However, on retailing the report is determined to support
existing centres and use new locations only where no alternative solution
offers itself. The whole is to be tied together by better public transport and
greater control over private cars.
William Lever is Professor of Urban Studies at the University of Glasgow.

Future: A CONFERENCE of European metropolitan regions is to be held in
Glasgow's Hilton Hotel next April. It is being organised and funded by
Strathclyde Regional Council in the context of its strategic planning remit.
However, by the time the delegates from all over Europe turn up for the
four-day event, Strathclyde Regional Council will have been abolished under
local government reorganisation.
Instead, the conference will be hosted by the Clyde Valley Joint Advisory
Committee, comprising delegates from eight of the 12 unitary authorities who
will succeed Strathclyde region.
Joint committees for Ayrshire and Argyll and Bute will carry out the strategic
planning function in the remainder of the former region.
Why should the outgoing region bother? Why should it publish a final up-dating
of its structure plan which over the past two decades has sought to achieve a
whole range of strategic planning objectives such as urban renewal and
regeneration?
It could be argued that, because of reorganisation, the whole question of
strategic planning was now the responsibility of other agencies.
However, the region is determined to put its house in order and leave to the
new authorities a final structure plan review as a blueprint for the late
nineties and the early part of the 21st century.
Another sound reason is that the Secretary of State has asked the region to
carry out the final structure plan up-date.
It means the new authorities now have a breathing space before they have to get
to grips with the huge and often controversial issues of strategic planning.
Strathclyde hopes the new authorities will adopt its priorities of emphasising
the importance of Glasgow as the core, metropolitan city. Equally vital is the
need to protect the green belt from despoilation by directing development
towards urban areas, and especially brownfield sites.
Flowing from this is the policy of protecting town centres and reducing private
car usage by developing commerce and housing in areas accessible to public
transport.
A senior council official said: ``We're often accused of being motorway
builders. The truth of the matter is that our whole transportation policy is
linked to minimising people's usage of private cars. It is a very compact
conurbation. You've got a good transport system. Redevelopment of brownfield
sites helps you to make better use of what you've got.''
One of the most important decisions Strathclyde region made was in advising the
Secretary of State for Scotland in 1976 not to proceed with Stonehouse new
town. That had major implications for the East End of Glasgow which had already
lost many people with money to spend to East Kilbride.
The last thing the West of Scotland needed was another new town to draw
resources away from the decaying heart.
That then formed the basis of the first structure plan in 1979/80 along with
the importance of Glasgow to the well-being of the area.
But as reorganisation approaches, there are fears that strategic planning will
be difficult to sustain with twelve different councils.
The new planning areas are Ayrshire, Argyll and Bute, and Glasgow and the Clyde
Valley. The latter will comprise delegates from eight unitary authorities who
will probably operate as a joint committee and take decisions by consensus.
The joint committees will have the power to produce a statutory structure plan
that is binding. While the regional council had the power to call in
applications which were contrary to the structure plan, the new joint advisory
committees will not.
While they will not have powers to intervene in decisions on planning
applications, the structure plan they produce would be binding on those
planning applications.
For example, if an application for a residential development is made to the new
Glasgow City Council, the council will have to consider that application in
accordance with the policies in the structure plan, which basically is to
achieve get more brownfield development.
The structure plan would define the limit of council action, and if members of
the planning committee wanted to to beyond that, they would have to notify the
Secretary of State for Scotland and adjoining authorities that they were going
outwith the terms of the structure plan.
The Secretary of State will be the guardian of the structure plan and that
leaves many in local government uneasy.
One of the biggest threats to the structure plan and the green belt policy is
the suggestion by Government that a new unitary authority could give planning
approval for up to 10 houses in an area proscribed for residential development
by the structure plan.
It is feared this could lead to erosion of green belt areas.
Strategic overview is critical for an area like the West of Scotland which has
many deprived areas crying out for redevelopment. The region argues there is no
point in eating into the green belt when there is work to be done in such areas.
It is hoped the new authorities will realise the importance of having a clear
structure plan and not get involved in selfish battles about making sure
development comes to their area.
According to a senior planner, some authorities that in the past perceived
housing and development as virility symbols had gradually changed their
attitudes.
He recalls: ``If you go back before 1975, the authorities administering
Strathkelvin/Lennoxtown area were growth orientated. But once their successors
took a cool look at things in the context of the overall plan, they became less
concerned with growth and more concerned with quality.''
However, there remain fears that the local interest could throw up
inappropriate decisions. A planning consent benefiting one area could very
quickly have a negative effect on another. What might be a short term gain
could turn out to be a long term serious loss.
Short termism, it seems, is the common enemy in local as well as national
government.
Planning will be decided by new bodies next year, so why has Strathclyde region
published a structure plan? John MacCalman, Municipal Correspondent, reports on
a council's legacy.

A MAIN railway line will be closed for at least one week during the busy
festive period after a bridge carrying a road under the track was severely
damaged in an accident at the weekend.
The bridge, on the North Highland Line from Inverness to Wick and Thurso, was
literally moved two feet out of postion when it was struck by the jib of a JCB
excavator being carried on an articulated low-loader on the road below it.
The accident happened at Kildary, Easter Ross, when the JCB was being hauled on
the B817 Invergordon to Kildary road, close to the shores of the Cromarty
Firth, around 4.00pm on Saturday.
The impact caused hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage to the
structure of the bridge and buckled the track, which carries three trains each
day in both directions between Inverness and the north.
The bridge will now have to be completely overhauled.
Ms Fiona Campbell, of Railtrack, said that engineers were looking into the
possibility of calling in the Army to erect a prefabricated Bailey bridge,
parallel to the damaged structure, as a temporary measure to get trains running
again.
She added that another option could be to put up trestles and use hydraulic
jacks to move the bridge back to its original position before strengthening its
masonry.
The impact hurled tonnes of masonry from the Victorian bridge on to the
carriageway. The road will also remain closed.
Around 120 passengers on two trains were immediately affected. The 15.40
Sprinter from Wick was stopped at Tain and the passengers were taken by buses
to Inverness. Buses also took passengers north from Invergordon to Wick and
Thurso after the 17.15 train from Inverness had to stop.
One single Sprinter set, with room for 140 passengers, was trapped north of the
damaged bridge on the 125 miles of line which serves a total of 16 stations,
including Tain, Golspie, and Brora as well as the two Caithness towns.
ScotRail said that the lack of capacity on the line north of Kildary could
cause ``real logistical problems'', with heavy traffic expected over the
holiday period. The owners of the low-loader, Ronaldson Transport of Wick, were
not available for comment yesterday.
The Kildary bridge has a clearance of 13ft 9in marked on its structure.

A SCOTTISH Labour MP has called for an urgent security review after learning
that several Government Ministers have had their mobile phones ``cloned'' in
the past 18 months.
Mr Brian Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, said Northern Ireland Secretary
Patrick Mayhew and his deputy, Mr Michael Ancram, had been among the victims of
the fraud, which involves using a phone's secret identity to reprogram another
phone.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth had also been a victim during his spell as
Minister at the Home Office, while other departments affected include the
Treasury, the Home Office, and the Foreign Office. Shadow Chancellor Gordon
Brown is among Labour MPs who are known to have fallen victim to the cloners.
Mr Donohoe said he learned in a series of parliamentary answers that only three
of 15 ministries questioned - National Heritage, Transport, and Trade and
Industry - reported no clonings, while the Department of Education and
Employment had not yet replied.
All other ministries reported at least one cloning while the Ministry of
Defence had the most, with 29 incidents.
Mr Donohoe said: ``These disclosures must spark an urgent review of security
arrangements for Ministers. If someone can clone a mobile phone used by a
Minister, that means they can overhear the Minister's conversation.''
The Labour MP launched his series of questions after himself falling victim to
a phone cloner, then discovering that many fellow MPs had suffered from the
widespread activity.
Cloning involves using monitoring equipment to capture the secret electronic
identity of a phone, which is then used to reprogram another, possibly stolen,
phone. Calls then made on the stolen phone are charged to the bill of the
genuine phone.
Mr Donohoe believes MPs and Ministers may have been particularly vulnerable as
cloners concentrate on areas of heavy mobile phone traffic, such as
Westminster.
He said phone companies generally picked up the bill when the fraud was
discovered, as in his own case, by unusual billing patterns.

RAILTRACK will today outline plans for a #10bn investment programme in renewals
over 10 years which will include aspects such as new signalling for the West
Coast main line.
Details of the proposed investment in upgrading track, renewal of bridges,
improved stations, and modernised signalling equipment will be published in the
Network Management Statement in an attempt by Railtrack to spell out the
benefits that will come from private sector ownership.
Tory MPs, however, are becoming more vociferous in their demands for an end to
the chaos surrounding the Government's privatisation plans. Seven senior MPs
are to demand action in a meeting with Transport Secretary Sir George Young
tomorrow, amid increasingly open calls for the complex privatisation to be
shelved.
The whole privatisation programme was thrown into fresh confusion last week
when the Court of Appeal ruled that four of the first seven franchises being
offered for sale were unlawful because the franchise director had failed to
follow ministerial advice on minimum standards of service.
Sir George insisted that the sell-off would press ahead and an announcement on
the successful bidders for the three ``legal'' train-operating franchises is
expected tomorrow.
Labour's transport spokesman, Brian Wilson, said yesterday that the Railtrack
investment plan represented ``no more than a wish list which has been rushed
out in an attempt to head off the growing Tory revolt over rail privatisation''.
He added: ``Railtrack's ability to invest will depend on political decisions
about subsidy and how much they can extract from train operators. At present,
according to their own figures, the Government is planning for railway spending
to drop by #500m by 1997-98. How do they square that with the claims about
Railtrack investment?''
Mr Wilson said that the way was being paved for the sell-off of Railtrack ``at
a scandalously low price and with all sorts of sweeteners attached''.
A spokeswoman for Railtrack said: ``Railtrack's customers will not be required
to pay additional charges to fund the work, unless they wish to agree changes
to the terms of their contracts enabling them to offer service improvements.
This programme has already been set in the five years of track access charges
set by the rail regulator.''
However, there is speculation that Railtrack is poised to agree a deal with the
rail regulator, Opraf, in which it will receive up to #200m over the next four
years to help it pay the heavy fines it is suffering from late-running trains.
According to some reports, Railtrack will be able to increase its charges to
rail operators through a supplement to offset the fines while it improves the
network.
Mr Wilson yesterday described such an access charge supplement as a sweetener
to ensure the sell-off of Railtrack. He added that he was by no means convinced
that a privatised railway would want two competing links between Scotland and
England.
``If they are going to make the East Coast main line a successful private
operation, it will be at the expense of the West Coast,'' said Mr Wilson. ``The
position of the West Coast is already critical. Railtrack has now been trying
to put a package in place for the past two years. There is still no sign of it
whatsoever.''
The Railtrack spokeswoman said the upgrading of the West Coast main line was a
separate project and today's announcement largely covers renewals. The plans
did, however, cover in-cab signalling, including - subject to confirmation of
costs and benefits - the West Coast line.
Railtrack chairman Robert Horton says in the foreword of the Network Management
Statement: ``The privatisation of the railways gives Railtrack the freedom and
opportunity to look ahead not just for two or three years, but for 10 years or
longer in order to deliver a rail network for the 21st century.''
``Following the proposed flotation of Railtrack Group plc in the spring of 1996
we will, for the first time, be able to develop long-range investment
programmes, free from the short-term limitations of public sector finance.''
Railtrack said it would replace 4700km of sleepers and 2200km of rails by the
year 2004, renew dozens of bridges and upgrade facilities and machinery at both
stations and depots.
Further improvements would be made to signalling and control equipment, some of
which dates back 40 years, and to vital areas for the efficient running of the
railway, including heaters on points and equipment at level crossings.

BOTH the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary yesterday issued strong
appeals to potential rebels on the Tory back benches not to vote against the
Government at the end of a Commons debate on fisheries policy tomorrow.
The Government is facing an embarrassing defeat as the Euro-sceptics line up
with Tory MPs from the South-west and the east coast annoyed at the impact the
fisheries package could have on their constituents.
One Tory, Waveney MP David Porter, whose constituency includes Lowestoft, said
yesterday he was considering resigning the Whip over the matter.
With a wafer-thin majority, it would take only a few Tory MPs to vote against
the Government line to inflict defeat, and last night it appeared that up to 12
might do so.
The Prime Minister, appealing to the rebels to fall into line, said they would
be rebelling on a ``routine, token debate'' with no real significance. He said:
``I hope colleagues will not choose to express dissatisfaction at any aspect of
European policy, of course I do, and I have no knowledge that they are going
to. We will have to wait and see.''
Mr Rifkind said Tory MPs would be foolish to rebel. He said: ``Any of my
colleagues who contemplate not voting with the Government on Tuesday should
realise the effect. This is not a vote on the Common Fisheries Policy, it will
not change this particular matter.
``They would be lining up with a Labour Party that has no sympathy for their
aspirations.
``It would be pretty foolish of Conservative MPs, and not what their
constituents would wish, for them to identify with that particular kind of
tactic. It would be rather shooting themselves in the foot . . . I am sure they
will realise that.''
Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry said that, at the end of this week, European
fisheries Ministers would be trying to reach agreement on a whole range of
issues regarding fish stocks, some of which would go up and some down.
At the moment, a number of stocks were at critical levels and if sizeable
fishing effort continued they could collapse altogether. He said: ``I do not
believe it is in the interests of the UK fishing industry for that to happen. I
will be trying to get the best deal but also to make sure we have sensible
quotas in years to come.''
Mr Baldry also pointed out that inside or outside the CFP, Britain would have
to impose control with too many boats chasing too few fish.
However, Tory MP John Wilkinson, one of the original band of Euro-rebels, said
he was not prepared to vote to see a British birthright handed to foreigners.
On the prospects for a single currency, the issue which has rekindled concern
among the Euro-sceptics, the Foreign Secretary yesterday reflected the Prime
Minister's cautious line that it should not be entered into ``like lemmings
tumbling off a cliff edge''.
Mr Rifkind said: ``What is certain is that a clear majority of the European
Union will not be in a single currency even if it is formed in 1999.
``The fundamental change that a one-money Europe would bring to national
decision-making, and the potential economic consequences should not be
under-estimated. At the moment, it is not possible to recommend going to a
single currency.
``The earliest it might exist is 1999 and it may be later than that.''
The Foreign Secretary said that the possibility of a White Paper giving a broad
outline of the Government's approach in advance of next year's IGC was still
being considered by Ministers.

Higher grants for derelict sites south of the Border are hitting growth, writes
John MacCalman
Development: DESPITE Strathclyde's sustained efforts in strategic planning over
two decades, Glasgow is running hard to stand still in attracting and
sustaining industrial development.
Regional planners warn that unless Scotland achieves parity with England and
Wales in terms of derelict land grants, Glasgow and its surrounding conurbation
will be miles worse instead of better.
In the early 1980s Glasgow accounted for 46% of all land in Strathclyde taken
up for industrial development, but in the early 1990s this had dropped to 20%.
Recent investment in infrastructure has improved the marketability of a number
of locations like Robroyston and Cambuslang.
The net result is that Glasgow, which is the economic heart of the region, is
failing to retain its expanding indigenous companies.
Equally alarmingly it is failing to attract the modern manufacturing industry
necessary to allow a restructuring of its economic base.
In the wider Strathclyde context the situation is deeply worrying. In 1980
there were 5000 hectares of vacant derelict land across the conurbation. Over
15 years the region is able to report the placement of an equivalent level of
development.
But at the same time it has had to contend with about 6000 hectares falling out
of use because of economic downturn.
One disappointed official said: ``We are back practically to where we were in
1980, even although we've had a huge programme of urban renewal, and huge take
up; so we've been running very fast to stand still.
``Our concern is that unless the funding is there even to enable us to keep
still, we'll start to go backwards and Glasgow, along with the rest of the
conurbation, will be Miles Worse.''
What does not help is the apparent disparity in levels of derelict land grant
between Scotland and the rest of the country.
The debate going on at the moment with the Government is that in other parts of
the country derelict land grant is available on a much more favourable basis
than applies in Scotland. Higher levels of grant in England and Wales have
allowed upgraded urban sites to compete more favourably with greenfield
locations.
In effect the region's strategy is being prejudiced by the failure of other
agencies to deal with this anomaly.
If it is not sorted out then the conurbation, especially Glasgow, could be left
with a lot of festering, empty sites, with all the adverse effect that has on
image and the marketing of the wider area.
Pressures on the structure plan are sometimes generated internally with
councillors pushing for development in their particular areas for economic and
employment reasons.
The outstanding example of this is the former Goodyear site in Drumchapel which
for many years was being saved for industrial development and is now occupied
by a number of large retail units.
Councillors had accused the region's department of Physical Planning of being
bureaucratic and inflexible in its attitude to the Goodyear site.
Eventually political pressure triumphed and the industrial zoning was relaxed
to allow retail development on the site.
However, the department still questions that decision, arguing that the name of
the game should have been to enhance industrial opportunities for the city.
An unhappy planner complained: ``That's why we were very concerned about sites
such as Goodyear because it presented one of the few opportunities for
industrial development in that sector of the city and it is developed now.
``In Drumchapel the locals were wound up. The only person that profited from
the situation was the man who sold the land. There will be a few people working
there today, but if that land had been properly developed and operated as an
industrial estate we at least would have had a development opportunity.''
The regional council believes that the urban area of Strathclyde is full of
holes with many buildings that are in poor condition.
Consequently every effort has been made to direct as much investment as
possible into the re-use of brownfield sites, urban land, and buildings.
This has been made possible by having a strong green belt policy that limits
development in the countryside and tries to direct everything back into the
urban area.
To achieve this the region's practice has been to identify all vacant land in
the conurbation, assess its development potential, and present development
opportunities to commercial and housing developers.
Perhaps the greatest victory for the strategy was in the mid seventies when the
region effectively blocked the development of Stonehouse New Town.
The catalyst for both the new towns and the peripheral estates was invariably
poor environmental conditions within the inner conurbations. Overspill
arrangements of one kind or another were developed in order to give the
opportunity for renewal and better conditions inside the city.
What happened was that the new towns were built, the peripheral estates were
built but the renewal didn't take place within the core city.
In the past 15-20 years Strathclyde, through its structure plan policy, has
been trying to redress the balance by supporting the rebuilding of the inner
city area, much of which was cleared as part of the decentralisation process.
The Structure plan philosophy not only advocated control of the New Towns, but
also control of the suburbs.
It was perhaps fortunate that in those early days owner occupation was minimal;
so when housebuilders switched on to the potential market in the West of
Scotland, they were asked to consider urban locations.
Not only did this policy prevent the suburbanisation of the green belt, but it
had the positive effect of transforming many urban areas.
A lot of the new positive image of the city was due to the development that was
occurring within it - the very essence of of Glasgow's Miles Better.

BRITAIN has become a nation of stressed-out workers, with a staggering nine out
of 10 organisations affected by the problem, a report showed today.
However, firms were doing ``dangerously little'' to tackle workplace stress,
complained the Industrial Society.
A survey of 700 workplaces found stress had increased over the past three years
in more than half those questioned.
The main symptom was ``permanent fatigue'' of employees but the society said it
was ``deeply disturbed'' to find that managers think stress is now an integral
part of most jobs.
Stress causes absence, accidents at work, reduced productivity, high staff
turnover, low morale, bad customer care, and aggression among staff, the
society warned.
Ms Georgina Tate, who conducted the survey, said workers were bearing
responsibilities they were not recruited for because of cutbacks among the
workforce.

THE row over safe limits of alcohol consumption is largely academic for those
who live in families where alcohol leads to violence, neglect, and abuse. But
the message that will remain after the fuss is that you can drink more than you
used to - and that is the last thing they want to hear.
As many as one in three fathers of pre-school children are heavy drinkers, with
tens of thousands of children in Scotland affected by problem drinking of one
or both parents. Very young children are aware of the effect of drink to an
extent unrecognised by adults.
Children as young as five water down parents' drinks to lessen their effect and
seven-year-olds try to act as marriage guidance counsellors between parents.
Primary school children challenge parents about the number of empties in the
bin while others walk the streets too scared to go home.
Children under 10 try to protect their mothers from violent fathers and
sometimes mothers knowingly use them as a shield. There are eight-year-olds who
regularly put their parents to bed, cook family meals, and take younger
siblings to school because the adults are incapable of looking after themselves
or their children, according to new research by the Health Education Board for
Scotland and the children's charity, Barnardo's.
Shirley's earliest memory is leaving home in Scotland with her mother, younger
sister, and brother and arriving in London. ``There was some man with my
mother, I don't know who he was, but I can remember him picking the padlock to
let us into this derelict house.''
She was four or five. Among the hazy memories is a clear recollection of the
three of them being locked in while their mother went out, with strict
instructions not to look out of the window. They did, of course, to see an
overgrown garden with waist-high grass and then the memories nudge each other
out into the open. She recalls clouds of buzzing flies. It was summer. She
remembers being hungry and so thirsty they would drink from the toilet bowl.
Then she covers her face with her hands and says she has just remembered that
they even drank their own urine, while their mother was drinking at the pub.
In Shirley's front room - full of well-nurtured plants and polished furniture,
surrounded by paintings, sitting on a sofa piled high with cushions, facing a
Christmas tree already decorated in early December - it is almost impossible to
believe this. It is the anguish in her voice and on her face which replaces the
doubt with the realisation that this chain-smoking young woman's homemaking is
more than a natural pleasure and skill. It's a compulsion. At 30, she's still
filling the huge void of her early life.
The extent of the squalor in that derelict house in London was a secret kept by
the three children, who lived in constant fear of physical reprisals by their
mother. Teachers, at least, must have had their suspicions. They were dirty.
They were hungry. There were bruises.
``We weren't like other children,'' says Shirley, who realises now that her
mother must have some mental illness in addition to her alcoholism. She
remembers a large playground and the three of them being taken into a room and
given milk and biscuits, so someone recognised that they were starving. Her
mother was unpredictably violent, more to the younger children, but as the
eldest Shirley would suffer by being unable to protect them. ``She used to try
to kill us and that was what finally caught her. She had tried to kill my
sister. She's still got terrible scars on her body.''
When the authorities intervened, the children were sent to a home in Kent, by
which time Shirley was about nine. She remembers being desperately upset and
demanding to know whether she would ever see her mother again. The answer was
no. They were told later she was dead. Many years later they discovered that
was a lie, but even among themselves did not speak of her again until Shirley
and her brother discovered she had also returned to Scotland. They visited
twice before they discovered her drunk and remembered the old horrors.
In the children's home, they were regarded as problems - all three wet the bed
- and stayed much longer than other children who were soon fostered. However,
their father was traced and moved to Kent to be near them, eventually getting a
job, a house, and a new partner to enable him to offer them a family home. ``It
was absolutely brilliant. It felt like a real family,'' says Shirley, ecstatic
that at last they were going to be like everybody else.
They weren't. Their father's girlfriend became their new stepmother, but he
continued to see other women, and with his encouragement, she entertained other
men in the house. By this time Shirley was a teenager herself and knew what was
going on - even her boyfriend was seduced by her stepmother. What reduces her
to helpless tears even now is the knowledge that her young brother was abused
by some of the men her mother brought into the house and she was powerless to
prevent it.
All three children grew to hate their stepmother. Shirley admits she was a
dreadful child and teenager, deliberately lying and stealing, refusing to take
part in anything at school even though she was excellent at sport. She says she
has been an under-achiever all her life and understands that what she cannot
bear is the possibility of failing or further rejection.
Eventually, she attacked her stepmother and was sent by her father home to her
grandmother in Scotland. Her sister insisted on going with her, but their
brother was made to stay in Kent. At last, Shirley had someone who really cared
about her. ``She was a totally good person. She would tell me not to steal and
to have some standards in my life and I would ignore her, but it did sink in
and I think about her and what she said now.''
She returned south briefly to sit her GCSE exams. ``For the last one I sat
there with my bag packed at my feet ready to go. Even with a loving grandmother
she was unable to have any sense of worth. ``I could never solve a problem or
make a decision. Whatever happened was someone else's fault.''
She suffered regularly from depression. Inevitably, she moved into a
relationship which didn't last, but didn't break up until it had produced four
children. Motherhood offered a new purpose in life and the promise of a new
beginning, but with the birth of her first child 10 years ago came the most
appalling night terrors in which memories that had been buried as she struggled
on with life emerged in the darkest hours of the night. Both she and her
brother used to smoke cannabis and take sleeping tablets and alcohol to shut
out the reality of life, but never, she insists, hard drugs. Their sister
suffers from an obsession with cleanliness resulting in compulsive washing.
When Shirley's third child was born with a disability, she was immediately
fearful her behaviour during pregnancy might have damaged him. In fact, he has
a chromosomal abnormality. At a very low ebb after his birth, she also had to
cope with the suicide of her brother who was schizophrenic, although he had
hidden his condition for many years.
A social worker she met through a support group for parents of handicapped
children run by Barnardo's was the first person in authority who recognised
that she was struggling with unfinished business from her childhood.
She arranged for Shirley and her sister to have access to their social work
records and as a result they pieced together much missing information.
It has been disturbing as well as useful, but through Al-anon, the group for
relatives of alcoholics, she has also had counselling and psychotherapy. Life
is slowly, sometimes painfully, taking shape. She has a new partner, who is an
alcoholic, but a sober, recovering one, and they have a daughter, Shirley's
fifth child, who is almost two. She recognises that she finds it difficult to
deal with older children and is going to have to move into a new phase of life,
where being a mother to small children is no longer all-consuming.
That recognition was the first step on a rocky road, but two weeks ago she
stumbled into an unexpected pot hole. In the aftermath of Rosemary West's
trial, her nightmares returned as she wept for fellow victims of abuse. ``I
felt very down and did not really know why and then all of that came out and I
just became suicidal. I didn't want to tell anybody, I just wanted to hide
away. I gave up my psychotherapy sessions when I had to collect a child from
school at lunchtime, but I really feel I have to get back to them. There are
kids out there suffering what we suffered and someone has to help them. We
could never tell anyone, because no-one ever asked. There was only one teacher
who really tried to understand me, but I couldn't even tell her.''
Shirley's desperate bravado as a teenager, she was always the one to tackle the
school bullies, was part of a front that had to be kept up from the age of five
when she assumed responsibility for her siblings. Inside, she knew she wasn't
the adult they needed and she's been rebelling against that ever since with
disastrous consequences. ``It's ruined my life,'' she says simply.

<TEXT>
MADRID, Sunday
THE European Union flag, the familiar ring of 12 golden stars on a blue
background, was 40 years old last week. What do you mean you didn't notice? The
trouble with flags and national anthems is that they don't always move with the
times.
The EU flag in its present form was adopted in December, 1955, by the Council
of Europe which was set up to promote democracy and human rights. Its inventor
was Paul Levy who worked as a senior official for the council (which then had
14 members and now has 38) and whose design used the stars as symbols and not
states. He wanted to represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac, the 12 labours of
Hercules, the 12 Apostles, the 12 sons of Jacob, and the 12 months of the year.
In 1983 the European Parliament adopted the flag. The European Community, now
the European Union, did the same three years later, recognising it as ``the one
and only emblem of European unification''. All was fine until this year. Mr
Levy's thinking seems not to have got through to most people who simply assumed
that the number of its stars matched the number of member states. Then last
January along came the Austrians, Swedes, and Finns, increasing the number of
EU members to 15.
Everyone assumed the number of stars would be increased accordingly and in the
manner of American states represented on Old Glory. But the word went out that
the flag would remain as it is - and that is that. The only benefit I can see
is that it will still be useful for souvenir clocks, there being little demand
for the 15-hour variety.
For a divided people the Belgians are great ones for flags. They fly them at
home on national days or on the deaths of prominent citizens. Recently they
vetoed the proposed design for a European car number plate because it had the
same colours as the Flemish flag. No-one ever said ever-closer union was easy.
When it comes to their national anthem Belgians are in dispute, as ever. They
sing it in two languages. Guess what: those who don't know the words just hum.
Scots seem to favour the Saltire more these days. In a previous era we waved
the rampant lion at sports grounds when shouting down the dreary God Save the
Queen. I wonder how long Flower of Scotland will last - great song for a folk
club, don't get me wrong, but not one which is even playable on the pipes.
Perhaps it has reached its sing-by date and a new one should be put out to
competition for the millennium. And it does seem odd that we are apparently not
allowed to fly the Saltire on Edinburgh Castle, our most famous building.
The Irish in their new mood of optimism over the peace process are now
tentatively considering dropping Amhran na bhFiann (A Soldier's Song) which is
seen as a touch too bloody. I always thought it rather pedestrian for a land
which produced some of the most stirring rebel songs in Europe.
And what of Australia? Dropping God Save the Queen is understandable, but
choosing Advance, Australia Fair to replace Waltzing Matilda which was the
unofficial anthem and one of the world's most popular songs is incomprehensible.
No question about the world's best anthem: the Marseillaise still inspires like
no other, and not just the French. It certainly inspired the Scots this year at
Parc des Princes. One of my great sporting memories was Gavin Hastings's
historic match-winning try. Scottish Opera's Bill Dempsey was in the crowd that
day. His thunderous, word-perfect rendition earned him a spontaneous round of
applause from the French crowd.
Maybe big Gav heard him. Everyone else did.
Spain is a good place to consider anthems. I came here after watching Ken
Loach's excellent film Land and Freedom, with its stirring civil war songs of
freedom. The thought occurs that so many European anthems - like ours - are
about carnage and slaughter, with some verging on the splendidly eccentric.
In Monaco they sing about dying in defence of their prince - and sending their
children into battle to die after them. The Danes are into splitting heads.
Their anthem talks of a sword hammering ``through Gothic helm and brain......''
Europeans should now stand respectfully for Beethoven's Ode to Joy which the EU
has also adopted. Keeping quiet would help. Almost no-one knows the words and
if they did they would need translation into the Community's 11 official
languages. Now that really would be Eurobabble.

SEE all this democracy? Damned unpredictable stuff if you ask me. From Govan to
the erstwhile gulags all these folk are now running about, cool as you please,
voting the way they want to. And demanding that the process be transparent and
accountable to boot. It'll all end in tears, mark these words.
Actually there's been a fair bit of greeting done already, not least in Govan,
jewel of the Clyde, where the party of the New People have got themselves in a
terminal fankle thanks to the D-word. Back in the days of Old Labour, things
would have been different. One, James Allison, Scottish organiser and legendary
fixer of things which might get broke, might have spent some little time
engaged upon missionary work in this fair parish.
A friendly interest would have been taken in the backstairs activities of the
two fraternally rival factions, and the odd word of comradely advice dropped in
a number of ears. Arithmetically, and in the matter of pre-counting likely
electoral preferences Mr Allison demonstrated a talent which would have been
the envy of any self-respecting electronic calculator, very little would have
been left to the chancey business of crossing the fingers and praying to St
Jude for a clear-cut result. (St Jude, being the patron saint of hopeless
causes, is a figure much in demand among certain sections of the Labour Party.)
Mr Allison, however, has long since retired from the fray. And in any event
would be unlikely to hanker after another spell of duty in Govan. For Govan has
long loomed large in party demonology, the seat having twice fallen in
spectacular fashion to the Nats. Mr Allison's wounds from the second occasion,
when Jim Sillars saw off the hapless Bob Gillespie, were a long time a-healing
as the bloodstained account in his memoirs made clear.
And now the curse of Govan has struck again. Just what the Scottish party
needed really, what with the National Executive still trying to write the final
script for their report on Monklandsgate. And once again the damage is entirely
self-inflicted.
The two male candidates (Margaret Curran was ever destined for a bit part in
this drama) and their back-up troops had already fashioned this selection
contest into an ill-tempered feud long before the official with the week's
short straw award, the luckless Lesley Quinn, turned up to oversee the final
count.
And that bitterness spilled over into the ballot. From what has emerged thus
far it appears that one of Mr Watson's scrutineers enthusiastically rejected
many postal votes which her own colleague has passed. And by the time the
papers still in contention had been whittled down to just over 50 the
democratic process was very transparent indeed, and both camps knew pretty
precisely which of these signatures represented victory for their man.
Yet, as the Sarwar camp cries foul, from inside the Watson tent come dark
mutterings about what might emerge from a full inquiry...... the clear
implication being that dirty deeds at the pass have not been the prerogative of
any one campaign.
All of which must make some of the denizens of John Smith House in Walworth
Road just plain nostalgic for the days when the rooms were so full of smoke you
couldn't see any alleged skulduggery however hard you peered.
Meanwhile, on the other side of Europe, those ungrateful Russians, just a
handful of years from being rescued from the forces of left-wing darkness, have
been turning out enthusiastically in favour of the new-model communists......
one of no fewer than eight main and 35 subsidiary parties slugging it out for
control of the Duma. New Leninism, it seems, looks reasonably attractive to
those sections of the population who have been already left behind by the rush
to capitalism.
For years they wanted to import the ways of the West, and now that Moscow is
suitably scarred with neon and boasting its very own mafioso they have hit upon
a few snags.
Like the spoils of ideological war going principally to the more innovative
architects of black market deals while those doing nothing more useful for
modern Mother Russia than teaching the children, healing the sick, and pushing
forward the frontiers of scientific research have been relegated to the bottom
of the financial pecking order. Like the fact that many of the unsavoury
occidental habits most enthusiastically picked up by less scrupulous citizens
are casual crime and violence. Democracy, cynically manipulated, imperfectly
copied from the original, turns out not to be nearly as pretty as it looked
from afar.
The Russian reformers fret at the selective amnesia of an electorate slow to
remember the days of the queues, empty shop windows, and perpetual shortages.
They implore their flock to look at the new economic indicators suggesting that
the days of the free-falling rouble are at an end, and the rewards for enduring
the years of crashing changes of social gear are almost at hand. Jam, if not
tomorrow, then certainly by a week on Thursday they cry, frustrated,
Major-like, at the stubborn non-appearance of a Russian feel-good factor.
And the voters, or a substantial swatch of them, suggest they pull the other
one.
How can intelligent electors behave so illogically cry the current
administrators? How can some politicians be so economical with the truth on the
hustings? Search me, Yuri. Why not ask the chaps down in Govan?

LINCOLN
By David Herbert Donald
Jonathan Cape: #30.
THOUSANDS of books have been written about Abraham Lincoln, of which a limited
number stand out as serious and important studies. This book belongs to that
category. David Herbert Donald, Charles Warren Professor Emeritus of American
History and American Civilization at Harvard University, is an eminent scholar
and historian, who has won two Pulitzer Prizes. The reputation of this learned
septuagenarian was established many years ago. Early in his career he dispersed
much mythology about the Civil War and its central figure with his
shrewdly-observed essays on the era, published in 1956 as a collection entitled
Lincoln Reconsidered.
Earlier, in 1948, he carved a special niche in Lincolniana by writing the first
biography of the idiosyncratic William Herndon, who was Lincoln's law partner
for 16 years in Illinois and himself the author of the most famous of all
Lincoln books. Herndon disliked the adoration of the assassinated President and
resolved to tell the truth. His story, published in 1889, caused outrage with
his claims of the Lincolns' stormy marriage and that his friend had been a
scoffer at religion. The book popularly known as Herndon's Lincoln remains an
indispensable source for researchers. Donald felicitiously called his work
Lincoln's Herndon.
But those publications were 40 years ago and Donald appeared to have fallen
largely silent on the subject. An unexpected glimpse was caught in Gore Vidal's
provocative 1984 novel, Lincoln, where he was credited with reading that
celebrity's manuscript and correcting historical inaccuracies, and another
sight afforded in 1990 when he addressed President George Bush and guests about
his revered predecessor at a White House lecture.
It has taken Donald a long time to produce what has been expected of him, a
full-length life, and it gives him the distinction, after a gap of 47 years, of
being the biographer of both partners in the famous Springfield legal firm of
Lincoln &amp; Herndon. What appears now is a single volume of 714 pages, of which
the narrative covers 599 pages and the remainder are occupied by sources and
notes, this section itself a treasury because it has a multitude of details on
the controversies among scholars.
Surely this is not, as the blurb claims, the first full-scale single-volume
biography of Lincoln's whole life from birth to assassination? What about the
lives by Benjamin Thomas (1952) and Stephen Oates (1977), which Donald admits
are distinguished works that were much used by his students?
The Lincoln who emerges from these pages is no paragon of virtue, as he has so
often been portrayed, but flawed and intensely human. In his early life,
Lincoln was on the move and dedicated to self-improvement. He despised his
father's occupation as farmer and carpenter and left home as soon as he could.
He was crude and often behaved foolishly - ``a coarse and vulgar fellow''. He
was awkward with women, as was shown by his failed relationship with Mary Owens
and his faltering courtship of Mary Todd - he broke their engagement before
marrying her.
He was always very sure of himself, and Donald dismisses any illusions that
Lincoln was modest, diffident, or backward at coming forward. His ambition was
relentless (in Herndon's phrase, ``a little engine that knew no rest''), and in
the political arena, which soon absorbed him, he constantly sought public
office or strategic position. Even his choice of Herndon as his junior was
calculated, because he would appeal to the populist elements in the town.
Lincoln was honest, fair, and hard-working. He became a successful lawyer. His
many years in Illinois politics equipped him with the skills he needed in the
Presidency. He was no innocent abroad, and adroitly handled business with
Thurlow Weed, the New York boss, and Simon Cameron, from Pennsylvania,
unsavoury politicians whose methods included bribery and intimidation.
Lincoln's achievements were monumental. He saved the United States, saved
democracy, and brought about the end of slavery. But his Presidency went far
from smoothly. He was the target of savage abuse and his administration was
criticised from all sides. He was accused of being a dictator, a charge not
without foundation for he suspended habeas corpus, suppressed newspapers, and
authorised the arbitrary arrest of dissidents. During those years, there were
``greater infringements on individual liberties than in any other period in
American history''.
Hindsight suggests that the President's aims were gained with general support
and approval. In reality, he was at odds with his own party. Conservatives
blamed him for converting the war to maintain the Union into a crusade against
slavery, and Radicals accused him of timidity, fence-straddling, incompetence,
and leniency towards the rebels.
The Gettysburg Address, remembered as an eloquent and moving tribute to ``the
brave men who struggled here'', was really a political speech reflecting
Lincoln's anxiety to set out his war objectives and thwart moves for a
negotiated peace with the Confederacy (which he never admitted existed). He had
by then proclaimed emancipation and had no intention of retreating. His
assertion that the nation was dedicated to the proposition that ``all men are
created equal'' in the Declaration of Independence (1776) was sharply
criticised. He was accused of a flagrant perversion of history and told that
the soldiers had died to uphold the Constitution (1789).
The Union victory at Gettysburg, now claimed as the beginnning of the end for
the Confederacy, turned out differently at the time because fighting raged on
through the next year, making Lincoln's re-election doubtful, and ``daily
black-bordered newspaper columns listing the dead brought home the enormity of
war''.
Lincoln was appalled by the slaughter, but he was a fatalist who believed in
the doctrine of necessity, ``a divinity that shapes our ends''. He never joined
a Christian denomination, although he found reassurance in the Bible. ``Again
and again he reverted to the idea that behind all the struggles and losses of
the war a Divine purpose was at work. This comforting doctrine allowed the
President to live with himself by shifting some of the responsibility for all
the suffering.''
He was innately cautious. A basic trait, according to Donald, was the essential
passivity of his nature. He was reluctant to take the initiative and make bold
plans. He preferred to respond to the actions of others. Certainly his ability
to wait and do nothing was one of the secrets of his success, but he also had a
sure touch for knowing when to act.
Donald says he has written from Lincoln's point of view, seeking to explain
rather than to judge. His book is realistic and balanced, presenting a coherent
and detailed account of a whole life. It is fluently written, comprehensive,
informative, and entertaining. What is convincingly demonstrated is Lincoln's
amazing capacity to grow. Year by year he matured and gained more control of
his surroundings. He was still developing during the Presidency.
Is this the definitive Lincoln? It would be unwise to apply the word
``definitive'' to so subtle a man as Lincoln, remembering too that studies
continue. Donald says that the late James G Randall's four-volume life,
completed by Richard Current, (1945-55), remains the most scholarly large-scale
biography. That impressive work is essential for readers who want a broader
canvas. But it is an outstanding achievement to have captured so attractively
in one set of covers the life and character of America's greatest President. On
that basis, one does not hesitate to acclaim this as the best Lincoln. It is a
portrait that will stand for years to come.

Inside politics
NOT so long ago Chancellor Ken Clarke declared to a Tory conference: ``any
enemy of John Major's is an enemy of mine.'' Perhaps we should now add ``until
after the next election, that is''. A couple of his utterances over the past
few days have been a trifle embarrassing.
The bottom 10% on the earnings ladder ``drive me up the wall'', he told the
Commons Treasury Committee. Their wealth is greater than their earnings
enabling them to smoke and drink more than the average. It may be statistically
true. But then pawnbrokers thrive in hard times, don't they? The observation
does little for Mr Major's ``classless society'' ambition, unless this is just
the sort of pious guff that we get from newly elected Prime Ministers on the
steps of No.10. The rumbustious Clarke comment was gleefully adopted by Labour
as further proof that the Tories are concerned only about the rich.
In Madrid, at the weekend European Union summit, Mr Clarke struck again. There
was Mr Major, sticking to his line that a single currency - the ``Euro'', for
so it is to be called - is jolly unlikely; furthermore, what about the majority
of member states who won't be ready for it in 1999.
As he sat on his sceptical Maastricht opt-out, the Prime Minister heaped
problems on the prospect. What did his Chancellor do? He opined that the odds
are in favour of a single currency. He put it at a 60-40 bet. Does Albion speak
to its allies with a forked tongue? Or is this just a case of two anglers
fishing the same river with different tackle?
In short, what is Mr Clarke up to? Now our Ken is your blokeish, ordinary
fellow type of Tory, and bless him for it. His conversation is never far from
the saloon bar, the football terraces, and the bookie's shop. He is
nevertheless brainy and politically streetwise. A contradiction in terms, you
say. Not really; he often says what he thinks (saloon bar), it is just that he
says it with more pith and intellect - as you might expect from a
Cambridge-educated QC.
These are no calculated blunders although they defy the fashion for party
spin-doctors who would have you state that Christmas falls on December 26 if
that was the line of the day. Mr Clarke, flush from successful Budget debating,
is staking out his position. He is not seeking to undermine the Prime Minister
personally. He is more interested in attracting the various streams of Tory
thinking, left and right.
At 55, he has a future either in government or opposition. His majority at
Rushcliffe is nearly 20,000, so his survival at the next election is much
better than the 60-40 shot that he gives to the ``Euro''. He has always been
talked about as a potential Tory leader until the past few years when his quiet
support of the European ideal has offended the growing number of sceptics in
the Commons.
It strikes me that when the names of Heseltine, Portillo, Redwood, Shephard (et
al) are sidelined, Clarke will still be there with a chance of the succession.
But he needs to cultivate the voters, namely the Tory parliamentary party, or
what's left of it after the next election.
His cautious Budget placated both right and left. The right wanted bigger tax
and state spending cuts, but they appreciated the gesture of 1p in the pound
and, for the first time in a long while, reductions in actual spending as
opposed to trimming of spending plans. The left, for their part, were happy
that he had done no more than 1p in the pound while devoting more resources to
helping the less well off.
His incautious remarks about the bottom 10% last week will find no criticism
from the free-marketeers who tend to the view that a successful society can be
based on raw statistics. More liberal Tories winced at his performance at the
Treasury Select Committee, but their pain was eased by Labour's failure to
exploit them to the full - at least, so far. ``Oh, that's just Ken being Ken,''
they said.
As for Europe, well, the sceptics have had a field day up to now having shifted
Mr Major somewhat in their direction for the sake of party peace. The Europhobe
Heathites and those more disposed to Britain at the heart of Europe (not by any
means the same group) have been seething at the sceptics' success. It has
seemed to them that only rebellion in the division lobbies gains reward.
Call them the moderate Europeans or the sensible ones, the point is that there
are plenty of them. If their Prime Minister does not speak for them as they
would like, then who will? Step forward Mr Ken Clarke, whose heart has always
been with them anyway. I say step forward Mr Clarke, my observation is that he
has already done so.
His 60-40 remark will please such politicians because it seeks to return some
balance to the Tory European debate. A truce broke out when Mr Major succeeded
in his ``put up or shut up'' leadership election, but the debate continues. The
Clarke 60-40 tilt came in the same week as Major's beaten challenger John
Redwood issued a predictable pamphlet suggesting that a single currency is
equivalent to economic Armageddon.
The Chancellor, with the backing of Deputy Prime Minister Heseltine and other
Cabinet colleagues, is in a position to state his views even if they differ
marginally from Mr Major's. This position will become stronger if he manages to
get the growth to produce a Budget next year that might address more directly
the matter of fighting the next General Election.
It falls on him more than anyone else to save Tory seats in 1997, if they can
last in Government that long. So you can be sure that between now and then he
will be listened to closely by all sections of the party. You can also be sure
that Mr Clarke will be listening. Interdependence between party and individual
is what normally decides a leadership issue.

Dunfermline 2, Airdrie 0
THEY are different, unique, almost, but everyone knows what to expect when
Airdrie come calling.
Skill should be neatly parcelled up and placed at the touchline, substituted by
an up-and-at-'em policy. Indeed, it is surprising that the product the team
from Broadwood invariably produce in the name of football has not aroused the
attention of the trades description people.
``It's been effective,'' I hear you say. ``Two cup finals cannot be bad.'' But
let us be honest. It is ugly, boring, and true exponents of the beautiful game
would possibly find it hard to equate Airdrie's version from the real thing. A
different ball game, if you like.
It is understandable, then, that when Airdrie's coach rolled away from East End
Park early on Saturday evening, Dunfermline manager Bert Paton looked more
relieved than satisfied with his men's work.
``It wasn't a classic,'' said the eloquent Paton, ``but it never is against
Airdrie. They stop you from playing.''
Of course, Saturday's game had a little added spice, with Andy Rhodes, once of
Dunfermline, now tending goal for Airdrie, and Andy Smith, once a Diamond, now
earning his cash in the Kingdom. And after the supporters had chanted their
obscenities at their teams' ``cast-offs,'' it was substitute Smith who sat back
with a large smile.
Because of injury, the big fellow had the boots on for the first time in four
months, but during the weeks of recuperation, Smith had this match circled in
his mind as the target for his return. The dream of scoring the winner, yes,
that would do nicely.
It didn't quite work out that way, but the striker's afternoon was made when
his pass, after 74 minutes, was delivered to Stewart Petrie's toes, and he
completed the scoring after Allan Moore had inflicted the first blow.
``It was hard being out for so long,'' said Smith still smiling, ``but when I
looked around and saw other players in a worse position, I thought I'd just
better get on with it.''
Dunfermline's people should not become carried away with this success, for
there is much work still to be done before the men from East End Park can be
looked upon as worthy contenders for a place upstairs, but as Paton said, with
his club's injury position displaying signs of abating, perhaps better
performances now will be more forthcoming.
It would have been fitting to have gathered the thoughts and aspirations of
Alex MacDonald, but there was a problem. The Airdrie manager saw fit to give
the media gathering a body swerve after the match.
However, the fact remains that Airdrie now are in touch with the top of the
division only by telescope, and with this in mind, would it not be fine to
imagine their leader at home at his drawing board, charting a new direction in
which his club can now embark.
Their fans and others who must witness them at work deserve better, so how
about it, Alex?

MICHAEL van Praag, president of Ajax, yesterday condemned the Bosman verdict in
the European Court of Justice, and revealed his club was considering whether or
not to continue with it's famed youth system.
The Amsterdam club, favourites to retain the European Cup, has enjoyed
unparalleled success under his leadership, but he said: ``It frightens me to
think what the future now holds for football. This is the end for many clubs
who will go bankrupt, and we too will be seriously affected.
``We are envied throughout the world for our system of developing young
players. Always, though, we have sold many more players than we have bought.
``We have invested millions of pounds to produce our own talent but, with the
abolition of the transfer system, what is the point? Maybe we should just pack
it in and grab the best players from other clubs.
``Why should we bring up young players for other clubs then receive a
ridiculous fee by way of compensation? It does not make sense.''
European Commissioner Karel van Miert said the ruling would also affect all
countries in the European Free Trade Association, which would involve
Switzerland, where UEFA is based.
The Dutch FA has already acted to allow an unlimited number of foreign players
into their leagues.
A survey has shown that clubs in Holland lead the way in giving youth it's
chance.
In their Premier League, 18.1% of players are 21 or under. Next best is England
(13.6%), followed by France and Spain (12.7%) then Germany (10.6%) and Italy
(9.5%).
q DIEGO Maradona is considering an offer to return to Europe with Linzer ASK.
Jo Strauss, the wealthy owner of the Austrian club, has already opened
negotiations with Boca Juniors where Maradona is under contract.
He said: ``Maradona is still the best player in the world. There would be an
enormous spin-off in terms of interest for all our clubs if he came to Austria.
``I am a rich man who can afford to indulge his dream and Maradona has not
ruled out the possibility that he will move here.''
q BELGIUM is the latest country to clamp down on indiscipline, with all
international players being required to sign a charter agreeing to a code of
behaviour.
Their unsuccessful campaign for Euro 96 ended in Cyprus where players were
alleged to have gone on a drunken binge.
q THE return of the legendary Uwe Seeler to take charge at SV Hamburg has
brought a rapid change in their fortunes. From languishing at the bottom of the
Bundesliga, the club has climbed to fifth place before the winter break which
will last until February.
q FRIEDEL Rausch, coach at Kaiserslautern, has emerged as the favourite to
succeed Roy Hodgson in the national post with Switzerland. Englishman Hodgson,
now with Internazionale, will leave after the European Championship finals.

WEST
GHK 5, Ayr 23. IF AYR are to salvage anything from a disappointing Premiership
season, it appears that the regional leagues are the stage on which they plan
to do it.
It seemed in the welcome warmth of the Old Anniesland clubhouse afterwards that
the people questioning the worth of these mid-season league encounters were, in
the main, wearing the colours of GHK.
They had just seen their favourites, albeit only a handful of them first-team
regulars, turned over by an Ayr side more determined to win and restore that
missing pride.
GHK looked unlikely to ignite anything by way of attack and for long periods of
the game found themselves under pressure in set-piece and loose play.
This, to this correspondent's shame, was the first viewing of Ayr since the
beginning of term, and it was somewhat difficult to see why they had struggled
to the degree they did in Division Four of the Tennent's Premiership.
What they must do is try to hang on to Kiwi imports Craig Foster and Aaron
Irwin, who both look the genuine article and add to an impressive core of home
players, among whom Kenny Nicol, Doug Smith, and Andy Fairgrieve shone.
The home side, too, are building for the future but their young half-backs,
Lyall Gibb and Nicky Barrett, have a long way to go and the forwards failed to
build any sort of platform.
Richard Good opened the scoring for Ayr when GHK were caught napping at their
line. Foster converted. Ayr kept up the pressure but had to wait until 29
minutes had gone before Good crossed for his second try after Andy McCleane
picked up off his toes and made the initial dent.
Graham Agnew briefly narrowed the gap with a try when he was given far too much
space on the right wing by a missing Ayr defence but Foster put Ayr out of
sight with a brace of penalty goals before the ample figure of Sandy Crear
appeared on the wing neatly to sidestep the GHK defence and sprint in for a
try.
GHK - C Dunlop; G S Agnew, S Little, I McArthur, G Williamson; N Barrett, L
Gibb; S Gay, M C Blackie, A Johnston, K Wilson, C du Plessis, S Unkles, G
Black, C Eason.
Ayr - C Foster; A McCleane, R Good, T E Bottomley, P Manning; G Ferguson, A
Fairgieve; N Short, J Lymburn, A S Crear, K Martin, D Moore, D Smith, A Irwin,
K Nicol.
Referee - J H Logan (Marr).
SCORERS: GHK - Agnew, 1t. Ayr - Good, 2t; Crear, 1t; Foster, 1c, 2p.
q DISTRICT calls have revealed the lack of depth in certain clubs. Conversely,
the return of two players to Wigtownshire has confirmed the same phenomenon.
Hugh Parker was hurt on the season's opening Saturday. Alan Drysdale hadn't
turned out all season following a shoulder operation. In their absence,
Wigtownshire bombed to a 0-14 record and entry to next season's National League.
Glasgow Southern are bound for next season's Premiership III but they were
pleased to leave Stranraer with a 19-8 win thanks to tries from John
Clinkenbeard, Dom Sharkey, and Glen Remnant, all converted by James Dunlop.
Parker's return brought lineout ball from himself and Adam McIntosh, and Alan
Drysdale's back row worked a treat. David Drysdale scored the try and kicked
the penalty. ``We travel expectantly to GHK next week,'' said captain Stephen
Gemmell.
Glasgow Accies made light of their District absentees, winning 46-13 at
Kilmarnock. Two tries from Robbie Stewart kept Killie in it at 10-15 at the
turn. Thereafter Accies took over, scoring eight tries with two to top man -
centre Mike Davis - and Chris Middleton, plus singletons to Julian Richmond,
Jonathan Williams, Danny Ablett, and Chris Brown. Stuart Simmers converted
thrice.

WORLD Cup runners-up Italy face a high-power confrontation with Germany at the
home of Manchester United.
``The game against Italy is always a classic and will be a 50-50,'' said German
coach Berti Vogts. ``Old Trafford is also a stadium about which I have some
strong feelings and I am very much looking forward to playing the game there.
``Italy have to be favourites in the group because they are very experienced.
We are a young and comparatively inexperienced team.''
Although the bookmakers are confident both will make it to the quarter-finals,
the two football powerhouses will be wary of Russia, who have shown in
qualifying and at club level they has the ability to upset either.
``Russia is a very, very strong team and they have eight players from Spartak
Moscow, who are a major force in the European Champions' Cup this year,'' Vogts
said.
``It would be dangerous for us to put too much attention on the game with
Germany,'' said Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi, whose team also faces the Czech
Republic.
``We must not for one minute think that this group is just made up of Italy and
Germany.''
Denmark start the defence of the title against Portugal on June 9, and Croatia
and Turkey make their debuts in the championship against each other at the City
Ground on June 11.
French coach Aime Jacquet said he had no immediate thoughts of recruiting
English-based players Eric Cantona, of Manchester United, and Newcastle's David
Ginola to his squad.
``The French national team have performed for more than a year without these
players, have qualified, have played very well, and now face a new challenge,''
he said. ``Now I have more than four months to think about them, but I hope the
English fans get behind us at Newcastle because of the Ginola connection,
anyway.''
The French find themselves in a tough group which including Romania, Bulgaria,
and Spain.
Bookmakers made Holland the new favourites at 9-2 after the draw in the
International Convention Centre. That is despite the fact that the Dutch needed
a play-off victory over the Republic of Ireland last Wednesday to gain the
final place in the championship.
Odds: 9-2 Holland, 5-1 Italy, Germany, 7-1 England, Spain, 10-1 France,
Portugal, 12-1 Croatia, 16-1 Bulgaria, Romania, 20-1 Russia, 25-1 Denmark, 50-1
Switzerland, Scotland, Turkey, 80-1 Czech Rep.

BUFFALO battled their way to the AFC East Division title yesterday for the
sixth time in eight years and their 23-20 win over Miami also clinched their
berth in the US National Football League play-offs.
San Francisco, although idle until they play Minnesota tonight, won the NFC
West division and also a play-off spot when Carolina upset Atlanta 21-17.
In Saturday's games, the Pittsburgh Steelers achieved their eighth straight
victory, gained a bye in the first round of the play-offs, and probably ended
New England's post-season chances with a 41-27 victory over the Patriots, while
Green Bay clinched a berth by beating New Orleans 34-23. Brett Favre threw for
308 yards and four touchdowns as the Packers moved to a 10-5 record and are
poised to clinch their first NFC Central championship since 1972.
Miami battled back from a 10-point deficit to tie the Bills. But Buffalo, who
missed the play-offs at 7-9 last year following four straight Super Bowl
appearances, won with a field goal after an interception.
Atlanta blew a two-touchdown lead at Carolina. Already the expansion team with
most first-season wins in NFL history, Carolina clinched No.7 by stopping
Atlanta on a fourth-and-goal play with 67 seconds left. Weekend results:
Saturday - Pittsburgh 41, New England 27; Green Bay 34, New Orleans 23.
Yesterday - Philadelphia 21, Arizona 20; Detroit 44, Jacksonville 0; Chicago
31, Tampa Bay 10; Washington 35, St Louis 23; Cleveland 26, Cincinnati 10;
Houston 23, New York Jets 6; Buffalo 23, Miami 20; Carolina 21, Atlanta 17;
Dallas 21, New York Giants 20; Kansas City 20, Denver 17; San Diego 27,

Although it had bought 26.1% by Friday, there seemed little stock available in
the market in the afternoon which would have allowed it to increase the stake
to the 29.9% level, the maximum allowed in a cash bid through market operations.
However, Kvaerner needs to receive acceptances to push its holding up to 54%
rather than 50.1%. That is because the convertible Preference shares, which are
also being bid for, carry one tenth of a vote.
The matter will probably be decided by the way in direction fund managers PDFM
decide to jump. They control 14% of the British engineering and construction
company and have been in talks with both chairman Sir Alan Cockshaw, who is to
give up his executive role in favour of Peter Mason from Balfour Beatty, and
Kvaerner's Erik Tonseth.
Desert deal
BRITISH Petroleum is about to sign a #2250m deal with the Algerian state owned
Sonatrach oil and gas organisation which will significantly boost the oil
giant's reserves.
The contract is to produce and market natural gas from a remote Saharan region
in the south-west of the country in a joint venture to supply the fast-growing
markets of southern Europe when output comes on stream early next century.
BP will provide 65% of the financing and expects to take about one-third of net
profits over the 20 to 30-year life of the project.
Level pay
MANUFACTURING pay awards in the three months to October maintained an even keel
with those for the three months to September, according to the latest CBI Pay
Databank. That contrasts with the 3.2% increase in the October period last year.
However, while 41% of firms cite the inability to raise prices as the main
reason for downwards pressure on pay awards, productivity in the first nine
months has increased by 4.4%.
One in six manufacturers and one in seven service companies are freezing pay
for up to one year. That compares with one in eight manufacturers and one in
six services firms a year ago. There have been very few changes in working time
with just 1% reducing their basic working week.

Celtic 1, Falkirk 0
THE style had gone, and in its place was frantic football. Celtic, whose
performances until Saturday's game against Falkirk had been polished and
exciting, lapsed into old ways. Their play, especially in the second half, was
fraught and the supporters stunned.
Many of them looked dejected as they streamed away from Celtic Park and into
the night, their questions silent. Their puzzled expressions said everything.
Celtic had been so vibrant and alive with ideas and confidence. How could they
suddenly produce a display which was heavy with similarities of last season and
beyond? Old fears came flooding back as Celtic struggled to cope with Falkirk's
determination.
Their manager, John Lambie, didn't bother to involve his players in any complex
tactical details, asking them to play nothing more than a basic pressing game.
Tommy Burns' side, which had ticked over fluently for most of the first half,
malfunctioned badly with those same players who had been knocking the ball
around with accuracy and ease running in no obvious direction. All method and
any sense of discipline seeped away and Celtic were mightily relieved at the
end of the afternoon.
``We were ragged and edgy in the second half and the players are very
disappointed,'' Burns reported. Like the fans, the manager also was deflated by
the play, but one thing had changed from the past. This time, Celtic played
badly and won and that marks this side as potential champions.
The premier division championship is not won by what happens in Old Firm games.
Titles are won by teams who are capable of grinding out results when the silky
form and sure touch has been left behind in the dressing room. Rangers have
been able to do that for years and on Saturday, Celtic followed their lead.
Celtic have gone 13 domestic matches without suffering defeat - Rangers were
the last side to beat them - which is a healthy statistic and one from which
the players can draw additional optimism. They know also that Pierre Van
Hooydonk can be relied upon to score regularly, and it was his strike in 17
minutes which secured maximum points on Saturday.
John Collins linked with Andreas Thom on the left, and the midfield player's
cross was much too tempting for Van Hooydonk, whose powerful header beat Tony
Parks. It was the Dutch striker's thirteenth goal of the season and offered
further evidence that he is a genuine scorer.
Unfortunately for Van Hooydonk, the move which created his opportunity was
about the last one of any menace, and as it progressed, the match lost appeal.
Supporters became restless - ``Perhaps we have all been spoiled a little,''
Burns suggested - and then anxious in the second period when Falkirk were
imposing themselves.
The Brockville side did work hard and although they enjoyed much more
possession than in a first half, in which they had allowed Celtic too much
space and time, they did not create much. Gordon Marshall had little to do even
though the movement of people in front of him had become frenetic.
Falkirk suffered an early loss when John Clark, who had been booked for
clattering into Thom, had to leave the pitch because of a hamstring injury, but
his replacement, Kevin James, dealt effectively with the aerial threat of Van
Hooydonk. James is long and thin and looks nothing like a footballer, but the
20-year-old certainly served his purpose.
Apart from Clark, the referee, Bill Crombie, also cautioned Falkirk's Jamie
McGowan, also for a tackle on Thom, who himself was booked. The German's crime,
according to the official, was to cheat by diving inside the opposition's box.
From a distance it looked as though David Weir had fouled the Celtic player,
but Crombie signalled he had taken a fall and waved a yellow card. ``I think it
was a case of someone just trying to be smart,'' said Burns, and you can be
certain he wasn't referring to his player.
Thom did appear to have been the victim of an injustice, but he accepted his
punishment without histrionics and continued to play, even though he had been
suffering the previous week with flu.
``At one point just after half-time I thought about taking Paul McStay off
because he had a dead leg, but he kept going, too. Everybody wants to play and
we are contenders now. We want to be in there fighting on the final day of the
season,'' said Burns.
Falkirk, second bottom in the division, have a struggle ahead if they are to
escape relegation, and it won't help that their captain, Joe McLaughlin, who
didn't play on Saturday, is thought to have asked away. Word has it the club's
player of the year last season and Lambie have fallen out, but there were a few
words of comfort from Burns.
``In John Lambie, they have an old fox. He is the right guy to have with you
when you are down where Falkirk are,'' he said.

ANY regular train traveller between Glasgow and Edinburgh will tell you the
scenery is pretty bleak. Even the green areas between the towns are uninspiring
with few trees to break up the horizon. But Donald Young plans to change all
that.
In 1993, he gave up his job as director of Central Scotland Countryside Trust,
a charitable volunteer body aimed at improving the environment between the two
cities, and formed New Lives, New Landscapes, a limited company with the same
aims but also driven by the profit motive.
``Initially, I raised #60,000 by selling shares in the company to investors who
were interested in improving the countryside at the same time as making a
profit. Since then, there have been two more projects and we have raised a
total of #150,000,'' said Mr Young, the company's managing director.
It uses West Lothian Regional Council's ``lowland crofting'' planning policy to
breath economic life back into rural communities.
Its first project was at West Harwood Farm, near West Calder, where New Lives,
New Landscapes bought the 220-acre farm. One third of the land was turned into
woodland by planting 100,000 mixed trees, while another third, the best of the
farming land, was retained for agricultural use, and serviced small-holding
plots were created on the remainder.
There are 13 plots varying between two and a half to 20 acres which have been
sold for housing for between #40,000 and #50,000.
Mr Young said: ``Between the wars, 20 people lived on the farm and seven of the
families we have sold plots to will be running businesses from their homes
which means that economic activity has returned to the area.''
New Lives, New Landscapes has bought another two farms, the 200-acre Stoneheap,
south of Bathgate, and the near 300-acre Woodbank, near Torpichen. Eleven
housing plots will be created at Stoneheap and 14 at Woodbank.
New Lives, New Landscapes spends around #200,000 on each farm, landscaping the
area, laying in the services, and planting trees. In addition, it has to find
the purchase price which, for a 200-acre farm, is likely to be around #200,000.
Once each project is completed, the company hopes to have generated an income
of between #500,000 and #600,000 from the sale of the plots, and the remaining
agricultural land.
Mr Young believes the scheme can be applied throughout the Central Belt.

Heriot's FP 14, Stirling County 34
THE 43-point margin which would have meant a successful defence of their title
always looked liked a mighty tall order for Stirling but, when they found
themselves 11 points down midway through the first half, mission just-possible
turned into mission highly-improbable.
In the opening minutes, County threw everything into the effort but with all
minds focused on attack, they forgot for a while that Heriot's wanted to win,
too, and by the time they had settled down to play the kind of cool, structured
game that might have netted them the requisite points, the equation had changed.
Heriot's coach John Foster and favourite son Kenny Milne had both said
beforehand that they weren't there just to make up the numbers. The retiring
Milne, who was the subject of a presentation to mark his 14 years at
Goldenacre, signed off with a try and Foster revealed later, too, that he will
not be coaching at Goldenacre next season.
Kevin McKenzie, in line for Milne's Scotland hooking berth, struck an early
psychological blow when he nicked scrummage ball against the head after three
minutes.
Brother Mark hit the upright with a penalty effort three minutes later but for
the next 20 minutes Stirling's championship hopes were buffeted by Heriot's
derring-do and their own over-eagerness.
After 10 minutes the plot started to turn sour when Phil Smith kicked Heriot's
into the lead with an arcing penalty goal.
A Phil Smith midfield interception then took play to the Stirling line. A
scrummage later, Mark McKenzie's in-goal clearance was charged down and from
another scrummage under the posts Milne romped in to score.
International sprinter Elliot Bunney served notice of his thoroughbred's pace
when he streaked down the touchline after 18 minutes. Gordon Mackay missed him.
Craig Sangster missed him. But Kenny Logan chopped him into touch 10 metres
from the Stirling line.
From the lineout, though, Stirling conceded a penalty and Campbell Aitken
speared the ball between the uprights.
Midway through the opening period, with calm and common sense restored, the
Stirling fightback began with a McKenzie penalty goal.
Next came a try by the same player, the referee missing what seemed to be a
knock-on from Ian Jardine, who had an otherwise impressive game.
Two minutes into injury time in the first half Stirling took the lead with a
McKenzie penalty goal, but at just 13-11 up at the turn, that 43-point margin
look unlikely in the extreme.
Eight minutes into the second half Jardine had a try, his momentum taking him
over the line, referee Bacigalupo looking initially to have blown a penalty
against Stirling for a double movement. But the try stood and McKenzie
converted. Just 34 points to go!
Heriot's were by no means out of it. Smith failed with a penalty effort. Milne,
Dall, and McVie had pops at the Stirling line and, again, the silken Bunney was
floored by the cross-covering Logan.
Stirling forced a scrummage on the Heriot's line after an hour and, with the
ball at No.8 Flockhart's feet, seemed to be driving over. Perversely, the
referee blew for a penalty as Heriot's brought the scrum down.
McKenzie tapped and Logan was over for a try but Jardine had knocked on.
Heriot's had been penalised again, though, and this time Flockhart - who had a
storming game - was over for the try denied earlier. McKenzie converted.
Kenny Harper retired hurt to be replaced by Murray Fraser and, for Heriot's,
Aitken missed with one penalty effort and made amends with another just two
minutes later.
There were nine minutes to go and Stirling knew that their championship had
gone. Four minutes from the end it was a family affair as Kevin McKenzie
breenged over for a try and brother Mark converted.

McMillan; M Livingstone, K Milne, A Binnie, P Young, J Turnbull, S Elliot, T

<HEADLINE>Alistair Darling talks about the problems and how he would make regulation rules simpler A labour of love for Tony Blair's  man in the City</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW WILSON</BYLINE>

JUST a few minutes with Alistair Darling confirmed why he is such a reassuring
front for the Labour Party in its dealings with the City.
The Shadow City spokesman may not have the spunky get up and go of his
predecessor, Mo Mowlam, whose charm covered her lack of understanding, but at
least he does know what he is talking about and has reasons for it.
But then the MP for Edinburgh Central is a barrister. Much of what he advocates
is common ground in City circles and among most centrist politicians and even
more so among those who do the actual work.
``The most pressing problem the new Government could do something about is
simplifying the regulatory mould.''
The profusion of rules and edicts in sway at present does not enjoy the
confidence of the people having to obey them while there are also simply too
many regulators, he added.
``Increasingly compliance departments are growing faster than the marketing
divisions.'' He argued that it would be best if the Securities and Investments
Board was the sole regulator - a notion which is greeted with almost universal
acclaim.
The City is faced with the problem of having to comply with British rules and
European regulations as well as meeting international obligations. He cited the
example of an American bank attracted to London having to compete in four
regulatory regimes, including those of the United States, and said that life
must be made simpler to encourage more international financial business to
London.
High on his list of priorities is the Bank of England. Overall there would not
be a major alteration but rather a change in culture and attitude as the Bank's
supervision has not changed much in the last 20 to 30 years.
It still took the view ``they are decent chaps, they must know what they are
doing'' and did not intervene until there were problems. Instead, it should ask
many more questions. The Bank had learned nothing from the failure of BCCI
which collapsed as a result of the world's biggest banking fraud.
``There should be six or seven outside members to form a collegiate base to
give advice, rather like the Bundesbank,'' said Mr Darling. ``No-one is asking
for a foolproof system as it simply does not exist.''
He is quite prepared for a bank to fail and go under. He would have voted
against saving Barings. The only time a bank should be supported through
Government action is when its collapse would cause systemic damage to the
economy through consequential failures.
A clearing banker summed up the City's attitude to Mr Darling. ``A sensible,
coherent, good all-round guy. He is not populist but very hard headed. It is
difficult to identify his weaknesses.''
But it is clear Mr Darling is hungry for power, despite having apparently less
passion than one would expect and he is not prepared to hang around for too
long if that is denied. Nor is he prepared to be a simple back bencher ``fact
finding in the Seychelles''.
To this end, he is speaking three or four times a week at lunches and dinners
and in his over-heated Westminster House offices, 300 yards along Millbank from
Westminster. His list of engagements runs solidly until May and he can be
choosy about his audiences.
That is a stark contrast to what happened under the pre-Blair leadership. ``Ten
years ago, Labour was on another planet as far as business was concerned,''
said Mr Darling.
Those were times of despondency for him and when he throught of giving up
politics to return to the silk, and presumably more money. But he learned to
street fight in the passions of Edinburgh politics in the late 80s which were
more than ample training for Westminster.
These were ``four unhappy years'' on Lothian Regional Council with his biggest
achievement, he said, being the prevention of the removal of cobbles from the
streets of Edinburgh New Town.
Clause Four allowed Labour to put off thinking of the country as it is. But
since it had been dropped, there were no blinkers, he added. In contrast, the
``Tories are moving into the outer extremes of British politics and are doing a
remarkable job in trying to lose the next Election''.
Loretto educated Mr Darling is very much against independence. The Scottish
financial services industry, which employs 10% of the workforce and produces
15% of the GDP, is very much part of the British industry which in turn needs
the British market.
He appears to love the job - appropriately his 42nd birthday was on Budget Day,
November 28.
Apparently, he has turned down the opportunity to move three or four times.
That is partly because half the task is dealing with the Treasury and so
influencing long-term strategic thinking, although he is giving nothing away on
that score, and half on the City which in practice represents the two halves of
his Edinburgh Central constituency.
But he is also ``somewhat afraid of going native'' and it would be somewhat
surprising if, under a Blair administration, he were not to be quickly promoted
as his public relations skills would be better employed at a more senior
Government level once the halcyon days of electoral honeymoon inevitably become
a little soured.

JUNIORS
CAMELON, the OVD Scottish Junior Cup holders, set up a fourth-round tie against
1994 winners Largs Thistle following their 1-0, replay victory over Darvel. The
competition's top scorer last season, Davie Flynn, was on target for the
Falkirk side after 75 minutes.
In the other replays, Tayport travelled to Baillieston and recorded a 3-0 win.
Chances were few in a dull first-half, but after the break Tayport captured the
form which took them to the 1993 final.
Within minutes of the restart junior internationalists Dave Reilly and Hamish
McKay combined for McKay to put Tayport ahead. Stevie Ross made it 2-0, and
with 10 minutes to go, Ross set up Reilly for the third to give Tayport a
fourth-round tie at home against Stoneywood.
Carluke defeated Rosyth Recreation 2-1 to earn a home tie against Reebok third
division leaders Greenock.
Dunipace and Vale of Clyde recorded their first league victories of the season,
leaving Neilston the only team still to win a league game. Neilston, however,
did look on their way to the three points in their game against Lesmahagow when
Stevie Coyle put them ahead in the first half from the penalty spot. A strike
by Gow's Scott McCulloch midway through the second-half gave them a share of
the points.
Blantyre Vics stretched their lead at the top of the first division with a 2-1
victory over nearest rivals Yoker Athletic.
The premier division is beginning to look a three-horse race with Pollok,
Arthurlie, and Petershill improving their league positions over nearest rivals
Shettleston and Maryhill.
A second half Stevie Convery goal gave Arthurlie a 1-0 win over Benburb.
Pollok hit top form in their game against Larkhall. A double from Darren
Stewart and goals from Spittal, Barrett, Elliott and Jamieson gave them a 6-1
win.
Whitburn overcame Linlithgow with five minutes of their Skol Cup semi-final
left when substitute McPhee scored. They will now meet Ormiston in the final.
Auchinleck Talbot took the outright lead at the top of the Western Stagecoach
League with their 2-1 win over Glenafton. A solo effort from Jim McGuire gave
Talbot a 1-0 lead at half-time. Within a minute of the second half, McGuire set
up Kenny Paterson for Talbot's second. Glens got one back in the seventieth
minute with a Tom McKenzie close-range shot.
Kilbirnie bounced back from last week's shock exit from the OVD Cup with a fine
3-0 win over high flying Cumnock. Hat tricks from Ewan Cameron, Gordon Lees,
and David Hutton helped Lochee United to a 12-0 win over Lochore in the Tay

Hamilton Accies 3, Dumbarton 0
SPIES from the top flight are expected in force at Hamilton Accies' next game
regardless of their lowly league position.
Eyes are on teenage striker Paul Hartley, whose performance on Saturday
underlined manager Iain Munro's description of him as a magnificent talent.
According to Munro, the 19-year-old could have spent 40 weeks on trial with
English clubs this year given the number of inquiries made.
There have been no bids, however, probably because of question marks about his
workrate. These were answered at Firhill. Hartley not only scored, but set one
up, chased, harried and, said Munro, was ``out of this world'' for one so young
in controlling the game.
Dumbarton's Jim Fallon was more concerned about the effects of Hartley's fierce
- but fair - tackle which sent Jim Marsland to hospital for X-rays after 82
minutes.
Fallon was also furious at the manner of defeat. ``It was a poor, poor
performance. They had us hemmed in most of the game and we made crucial
mistakes at crucial times. We looked slow, lethargic.''
Such observations were spot on. Dumbarton had just four efforts on goal, with
two from free kicks.
In contrast, Accies could have scored at least seven, thanks to a passing game
combined with pace, power, and a dream start.
In three minutes, Hartley netted from 15 yards after Jose Quitongo split a
defence which throughout did not merit the name.
Hartley chested down for Raymond McStay to score in 29 minutes when keeper Ian
Macfarlane let the shot, more a trickle than a drive, creep under his frame.
Then Gary Clark somehow shot over from two yards before Macfarlane made up for
his blunder with a fine stop from McStay.
It was exhilarating, the more so because this relegation clash had promised
little with a paltry attendance and Siberian wind chill factor.
Clark, Accies' top scorer, netted the third goal on half-time, soaring high to
meet a Stephen McNulty cross.
Clark, however, has a two-game suspension looming just as Munro reckons a
charge up the table is possible.
The goalless second-half was peppered with exquisite touches by Hartley,
Quitongo's trickery, and a team display which rarely allowed Dumbarton a look
in.
Hartley, recently switched to centre from the wing, said: ``I'm enjoying it. Of
transfer talk, he said: ``At 19, I have a long way to go. I am happy to stay
here, but if I moved along it would be great . . . and more money.''

Aberdeen 1, Hearts 2
ABERDEEN and Hearts provided their supporters with an entertaining last match
before Christmas, but the result was not what the home fans expected after a
dream start.
New Dons' signing Dean Windass scored his first goal for the club in the dying
seconds of their midweek game against Kilmarnock.
With just 45 seconds gone on Saturday, he was in the right place to tap in a
low cross from Billy Dodds after Duncan Shearer missed it.
The early blow did nothing to douse the spirit of the Hearts players, and
although they won 10 corners in the first half, Aberdeen appeared in control,
playing smooth, flowing football.
Stephen Glass hit a post with a 35-yard drive, and keeper Gilles Rousset
stopped a Shearer header. Aberdeen just could not get a second past the Hearts
defence, marshalled well by Pasquale Bruno.
Just 20 seconds after the break, it should have been settled when Rousset
failed to hold a Shearer shot and Dodds missed from three yards.
Hearts then began to dominate and the Aberdeen threat faded. The turning point
came when John Colquhoun replaced tall Swede, Hans Eskilsson, in 78 minutes.
Almost immediately, he linked with Alan Johnston to set him up with the
equaliser Hearts deserved for their efforts.
Two minutes later, as Aberdeen's defence panicked under pressure, Colquhoun
forced his way through to pick up the loose ball and fire home a 12-yard shot.
``This game is all about scoring and defending, and we didn't score the goals
we should have with the chances we had. Also, we did not defend well enough in
the last 15 minutes,'' Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken said.
``We dominated large parts of the game, but did not finish off the opposition
when we had the opportunities. If you do that, you are going to be vulnerable
to sucker punches.''
Hearts captain Gary Mackay said the fighting spirit they showed had been
instilled by the manager.
``We knew before the game the best way to defend at Pittodrie is to have a go
at Aberdeen, and it was nice to get the pay-off.''
He also praised the large travelling support for the encouragement they gave
the team, not just when they equalised but for most of the game when they were
behind.
Manager Jim Jefferies was delighted with the best away performance of the
season.
``The only good thing about losing a goal in the first minute is that you have
89 minutes to come back. The players' response was great, and they closed
Aberdeen down well in the middle of the park.
``I don't think Eoin Jess got into the game in the first half.
``When you consider the experienced players who are out, and how well those who
came in performed, it augurs well for competition for places which is good for
Hearts.
``I thought we thoroughly deserved our win.'' He added that he was particularly
pleased that they did not lose their composure when Eskilsson was denied a
reasonable penalty claim in the fiftieth minute.
``They didn't let it upset them and just kept on playing. We eventually took
Eskilsson off as a change of tactic, to get the ball on the ground played in to
the feet of Robertson and Colquhoun, and it worked a treat for us.
``There is a tremendous spirit about the club. We have been trying to impress
the importance of that since I came to Tynecastle.''

THE City of London winds down for the Christmas break this week and there are
few major companies due to report results, though no doubt bid situations will
keep some excitement in the air.
Howden Group produces its interim figures tomorrow and analysts are looking for
a confident performance, with profits rising by 15% or so compared with 1994's
#10.6m. Chairman John Jackson said in his annual report that the prospects for
further progress in 1996 were good.
The group's markets remain competitive but it began the financial year with a
sound order position and has a good chance of improving margins given its high
market share in certain sectors such as air and gas handling, which make up
two-thirds of its business. Howden is the world's largest manufacturer of
industrial fans.
Europe as a whole is a difficult area as economic growth has slowed but the
Asia Pacific region is of course booming. Howden has reshaped its portfolio in
recent years, getting rid of low-return companies and adding ones in core
sectors.
This has continued in 1995, with the selling of a small American
air-conditioning company and the buying of Burton Corblin, a manufacturer of
compressor sets. The current year will also see the full benefit of the Donkin
purchase in South Africa which is now its lowest-cost manufacturer of fans.
First Choice Holidays comes out with full-year figures tomorrow and the market
will be watching for comments on current trading and prospects as the group has
already indicated that it would only make profits of #1m against #16.3m.
As Airtours reported earlier, the industry was hit hard by disappointing
bookings and heavy discounting which severely hit margins. Bookings so far for
the 1996 season are running below 1994 levels, though of course it is very
early days. The industry has cut capacity but there is doubt over how much it
can raise margins as competition will remain strong.
Gaming machines operator Kunick unveils annual figures today. Although the
effect of the National Lottery is bound to have had an impact, analysts reckon
results for the year to the end of September are likely to have risen by #1m to
#8.1m.
Shareholders are in line for a modest boost in the total dividend payout to
0.6p from 0.5p in the previous 12 months.
Eurotherm showed in its first-half figures that it was trading strongly, with
profits up 30%, and so a good showing is expected for the full year when the
group reports tomorrow. Around #35m is looked for, up from #26m.
The group has done much in recent years to improve efficiency and raise
productivity and now it is being rewarded with sales growth. High operational
gearing means this is translated into strong profits growth. Eurotherm supplies
equipment needed to automate production processes so is operating in a
long-term growth market even if competition can be strong.
Another instalment in the sorry saga of Rodime is due on Wednesday. The company
was dealt a severe blow when a US court ruled in September that parts of its
disc drive patent were invalid.
There are a number of investment trusts producing results during this week and,
as the final office parties take place on Friday, there is only one small
company, Kelsey Industries, reporting,
TODAY - Interims - Brasway, British Thornton Holdings, Crest Packaging,
Edinburgh Japan Trust, Foreign &amp; Colonial Smaller, Ingham, I&amp;S Optimum Income,

Edinburgh Academicals 15
Stewart's Melville FP 24
EAST 2
THERE was much discussion after the game about the value of the new Regional
Leagues, especially their timing following the intensity of the Premiership. It
would certainly be difficult to judge what worth this match was to the players,
far less the crowd, which could have filled a small bus.
Accies' coach Bob Easson lamented: ``It was a poor game. There was no shape to
it. We just seemed to labour from one side of the field to the other with
little direct running.''
In truth there was much huff and puff with little constructive play and there
were some dire passages, but the game did have its brighter moments and we did
see five tries.
The first came in the fourth minute as Colleges drove home the pressure they
had exerted from the kick-off. Accies' defence cracked on their line and they
conceded a penalty. It was quickly taken and lock Bill Faulds dived over to
claim the try.
Accies responded with commendable drive and aggression, their pack recycling
some good ball but it took until midway in the half before they threatened the
visitors' line. Even then it was third time lucky with his attempts at goal
before centre James Kiddie secured Accies' first points with a penalty. Within
two minutes, however, Colleges restored their margin when full back Murray
Thomson replied in kind.
With half-time looming, Stewart's Melville sensed their opponents were making
heavy weather of it. A kick ahead by Thomson just eluded the chasing Mark
Tweedie but, from Colleges' next drive, winger Graham Stirling rounded off a
flowing move to score.
The good work resumed after the interval, Thomson adding a penalty goal and the
sprightly Stirling a second try following an incisive break.
For Accies it was now catch-up time, but the sight of Jason Fayers' dismissal
from the fray for a loose punch was not the inspiration they sought.
Short-handed and their pack re-cast, Accies set about their task and a break by
full back Chris Newton set Richard Porter free up the wing for a try. The
winger added a second later on with Kiddie converting but Thomson's third
penalty for Stewart's Melville had already put the game beyond their reach.
Edinburgh Academicals - C Newton; A Dow, C Murray, J Kiddie, R Porter; K Troup,
P Simpson; J Fayers, P Haslett, D Graham, A Adamson, E McDonald, R Hoole, J
Parrot, A Richardson. Replacements - O'Hanlon for Simpson, temporary
replacement (11-14min); B Stewart for Parrot (46).
Stewart's Melville - M Thomson; G Stirling, A Huett, L Hamilton, M Tweedie; F
Tulloch, M Rennie; J Blackhall, B Thomas, J Conlin, M Paton, B Faulds, B
Foster, D Pickering, K Dobson. Replacements - J Hughes for Thomas (47); K
Hamilton for Dobson (67).
Referee - R Dickson (Madras College).
SCORERS: Edinburgh Academicals - Porter, 2t; Kiddie, 1c, 1p. Stewart's Melville
- Faulds, 1t; Stirling, 2t; Thomson, 3p.
q GRANGEMOUTH held off a late fightback to win their opening match in Regional
East League 2 at Glensburgh, beating Corstorphine 23-16.
Mike Parsons scored the only try of the first half to put Grangemouth 11-3
ahead at the interval. Two tries, from David Holmes and Archie McWatt, shortly
after the break looked to have made the game safe, at a 23-3 lead, but
Corstorphine - who failed to register a win in their injury-ravaged premiership
campaign - hit back, with two penalties from Threadgill and a Noel Hutton try
giving the visitors respectability.
Meanwhile Gordonians shocked Kirkcaldy with an 11-8 win at Beveridge Park. A
first-half try from Duncan Pickup and a penalty in each half from Colin Craig
put the Aberdeen side 11-0 ahead and although full back Andrew Reddick managed
a consolation score, it was all too late for the home side.

Kilmarnock 2, Partick Th 1
HE might be 35, but Robert Connor is receptive enough to new football
experiences, even if he might have elected to miss out on his most recent. The
Kilmarnock midfielder has seen plenty of the Scottish game in his time with Ayr
United, Dundee, Aberdeen, and now Killie, but the pressures of the lower end of
premier division are fresh and not so pleasant.
Despite that, Connor is playing like a man who is still very much in his prime,
rather than one who should have the slippers and pipe in his thoughts, but he
believes the current relegation dominated existence is unquestionably bad for
the top league. It is, therefore, not a surprise that he is a firm supporter of
the proposed reconstruction.
After his team had recovered from a dreadful error that cost them a goal inside
64 seconds, to collect three invaluable points, Connor made it clear which side
of the great debate he took. ``This is the first time I have been involved in
this kind of thing and there is no doubt the pressure is a big factor,
particularly with younger players.
``That is why it would have to be an improvement to move to a 16-club league
and give the younger players a chance to develop without that pressure on them.
At the moment, managers will always go for experience.''
The possibility, using that logic, that a change might mean old-timers like
himself losing their usefulness maybe had not been considered, but the way he
is playing, that seems unlikely in any case. ``I wish he was 25,'' said manager
Alex Totten, ``because he is simply magnificent just now.''
Connor, naturally, fancied the idea of being 25 again himself but in the
meantime is determined to keep playing at the highest level available. He gives
the lie to the old truism that older players have to move backwards to extend
their careers, but he has no secret to reveal as to why he has survived where
others have failed.
``I honestly don't know but maybe it has something to do with looking after
yourself. I was also out for a couple of seasons with a bad Achilles tendon
injury and I am trying to make up for lost time.''
His team did precisely that after their defence presented Thistle with a goal
before some of the customers had settled in their seats. Youngster Jim
Lauchlan, who had a fine game, had hardly seen the ball in the first minute
when he took a bit of a risk with a pass-back to keeper Dragoje Lekovic, who is
not one of the best at dealing with them.
The keeper tried to control the ball before passing out to Neil Whitworth, but
took so long that Derek McWilliams was in quickly to steal the ball, from the
defender and shoot into the net.
That left Killie nervy and worried, but they also had to cope with a Thistle
team that was playing really well, passing the ball with accuracy and
confidence, and, at that stage, odds-on favourites to hoist themselves up
another rung in the table. But a combination of slack finishing, misfortune,
and the posts denied them. Instead, in one of their rare upfield raids,
Kilmarnock snatched an equaliser when Paul Wright dived at an Ally Mitchell
cross to head past Cairns.
In this kind of match, you don't get a second-half bite at the cherry and,
predictably, Killie came out in much more positive frame of mind, with Wright
scoring a fine second, taming the pass from Whitworth before shooting home.
That sealed the points.
``Paul has not been scoring that kind of goal recently,'' said Connor, who knew
the striker from his Aberdeen days, ``but they are his trademark.
``In training he does it all the time, takes the ball down and shoots into the
net. In games he has been that wee bit nervous as he got stick from the fans.
That is one of the modern-day trials we have to accept, that you get more stick
from home fans than opposition.''
Totten, who was extremely displeased with his striker when he lost possession
and cost his team a goal at Parkhead two weeks ago, is restored as a fan. That
is as it should be considering it was Totten who brought the former St
Johnstone player to Rugby Park.
``He showed against Thistle why I bought him last March,'' said the manager,
``and those were two excellent goals. He has taken a while to settle, but three
goals in the last two matches will have helped. He made three out of the four
goals we scored against Falkirk, too.''
For Thistle, Ian Cameron and McWilliams were effective in midfield but
defenders Alan Dinnie and Steve Welsh were the men who stood out later on.
Both teams know the long fight against the drop is only just beginning (unless
the league reconstruction goes through and it all becomes academic) and Connor
anticipates a see-saw struggle. ``We jumped over Thistle as a result of this
win, but I think that four or five teams will be going through this kind of
thing all season.''

IN ENGLAND:
ON a weekend when all thoughts led to next June, a serious injury to
Blackburn's Graeme Le Saux tempered England's excitement at the European
Championship draw.
Le Saux was the unfortunate victim of an apparently innocent tackle by
Middlesbrough's Brazilian Juninho in Saturday's game at Ewood Park. His club,
never the most public relations conscious, were slow to confirm the exact
nature of the injury, but a break to either an ankle or leg seems certain,
questioning the Channel Islander's participation in the tournament.
There was better news for Scotland, with the unexpected early return of Colin
Hendry to the champions' defence, which held firm in the face of
Middlesbrough's late rally. Earlier, Alan Shearer had tucked away the sort of
chance he has been missing for England, winning the game with his twenty-second
goal of the season.
Newcastle's Les Ferdinand, reassuringly, was a match-winner, too, scoring the
only goal of the home win against Everton to stay one ahead of Shearer in
Premiership games. His team had to survive with 10 men, John Beresford having
become one of five players sent off in Saturday's eight games after having
hauled down Andrei Kanchelskis.
It was derby-day as well as red card day - facts not entirely unconnected.
Coventry's Kevin Richardson was another of the five as he and manager Ron
Atkinson suffered an unhappy return to Villa Park with Coventry. Savo Milosevic
scored a hat trick in a 4-1 win that rather undid the good work of Coventry's
5-0 success against Blackburn the previous Saturday.
Arsenal's Steve Bould, always vulnerable under the new regulations about
tackling from behind, was dismissed after John Spencer had put Chelsea ahead at
Highbury. Typically, Arsenal still snatched a point with 10 men, right-back Lee
Dixon thundering in a late equaliser.
There was more encouragement for England in the second London derby,
Totten-ham's Teddy Sheringham cleverly setting up the only goal for Ruel Fox
against Wimbledon. It will be interesting to see which way Venables jumps if
Sheringham, who missed last week's international, Ferdinand, and Shearer are
all fit come the next engagement.
Continental influence was heavy in the other derby game, Thomas Brolin scoring
his first goal for Leeds to no avail in the 6-2 drubbing by Sheffield
Wednesday, for whom Belgian Marc Degryse scored twice.
In an important game at the bottom, Bolton lost away from home for the ninth
successive occasion, 2-1 at Queen's Park Rangers, Mark Hateley making both the
home team's goals and thumping a header against a post.
q MARTIN O'Neill yesterday resigned as manager of first division Norwich after
having taken over at Carrow Road in the close season. The club, however, are
adamant that he will continue in charge.
Norwich lost 3-2 at Leicester yesterday in a vital league game, and O'Neill's
decision will fuel speculation that he is heading for Filbert Street after the
departure of Mark McGhee.
The club released a short statement, saying: ``We regret to announce that team
manager Martin O'Neill has tendered his resignation, which is not being
accepted. His two-year contract still has 18 months to run.''
Assistant manager Paul Franklin and reserve team manager Steve Walford were in
charge of the team at Leicester. Scot Robert Fleck hit one of Norwich's goals.
O'Neill is believed to have been in dispute with chairman Robert Chase over
lack of funds needed to strengthen the team.
Former Norwich manager Mike Walker is one of the contenders for the Leicester
job.

SCOTLAND moved quickly yesterday to book their hotel headquarters for the
European Championships, writes Ken Gallacher.
Within minutes of the draw ending, the SFA had commandeered a manor house hotel
just 15 minutes from Birmingham in the heart of Shakespeare country.
The hotel is situated in a village just a few minutes outside
Stratford-upon-Avon, within easy reach of Birmingham, where two of the games
will be played, and only a couple of hours from Wembley where the match against
England takes place.
The luxury hotel was mentioned in the Domesday Book and stands in its own
grounds.
Press officer David Findlay explained: ``We made several visits around England
between qualifying and this draw taking place and looked at suitable hotels.
``This one is just perfect. We have taken over the entire hotel for the early
part of the competition.
``It is perfectly situated for the games at Villa Park and we could even stay
there the night before the England game and travel to Wembley in the morning.
It will provide the players with the kind of privacy they need at this kind of
tournament.''

BA REORGANISATION plan has been drawn up to protect the Castle Douglas auction
firm of Wallets Marts from takeover bids and to maintain its independence.
Wallets Marts PLC successfully fought off a takeover by Ayr-based firm James
Craig Ltd in a lengthy battle earlier this year. But it was costly and the
directors said afterwards that they would consider making changes to protect
themselves.
Now Wallets Marts has told shareholders that a reorganisation has been carried
out to maintain the independence of the auctioneering business which plays such
a central role in Castle Douglas.
Shareholders will receive shares in Wallets Marts Castle Douglas Ltd (WMCD) on
a one for one basis with Wallets shares. WMCD will conduct the auctioneering
business from its premises in New Market Street, Castle Douglas, with Wallets
retaining owners of all its existing assets.
Robin Anderson has been appointed managing director of WMCD and has emphasised
that Wallets staff and customers will be unaffected by the change. Tom
Gillespie, the chairman of Wallets, said: ``The reorganisation will provide
Wallets with strong defences in respect of its independence and the ability to
derive full value for its respective businesses in the event that shareholders
ever do decide to sell.''
It is estimated that the cost of the takeover battle for Wallets was around
#100,000 with James Craig making two offers, the second and final one being #12
a share for Wallets in June. Craig received valid acceptances representing
38.9% for Wallets which is one of the leading market firms in the South-west.
q Unlisted securities investement trust specialist Electra marginally
outperformed the FTSE All-share index in its financial year to September with a
15.72% increase in net asset value to 440.3p compared with the overall market's
rise of 14.74%. There is a final dividend of 3.85p to raise the full year total
4.1% to 7.55p.
Earnings after minority interests tumbled 16.5% to #10.8m which chairman
Michael Stoddart put down to competitive pressures making it difficult to
obtain a high running yield and so the cost of borrowings increased. During the
year, merchant bankers Robert Fleming acquired a 50% stake in the Electra
Kingsway management company.

MELROSE, champions in absentia, secured their fifth title in seven years to
confirm their status as the most consistent side of modern times.
Since season 1989-90, only Boroughmuir and Stirling County have managed to
wrest the Melrose grip from the championship, but the manner of this season's
win - with defending champions Stirling County failing in their quest for the
title at Goldenacre and with Melrose on regional league duty 40 miles away -
leaves a lot to be desired in terms of putting that final, full-stop on
premiership business and giving the champions their day of glory.
Melrose coach Rob Moffat declared: ``It's a strange way to win the title,
especially when we've just been beaten by Selkirk. It's difficult to celebrate
when you've just lost but we'll manage next year,'' he said.
Yesterday Craig Chalmers reflected on his side's championship season.
``The circumstances on the final day weren't of the best but that doesn't
detract from our achievement. We may have lost to some of the better sides in
the league but the championship was decided over 14 games and we deserved to
win,'' he declared.
Stirling County, who had to beat Heriot's by 43 points on Saturday if the title
was to remain at Bridgehaugh, ended up 23 points short but finish equal on
league points with the champions.
County captain Kevin McKenzie declared: ``I think we're still the best side in
the country but, today, we went chasing the points too early instead of
sticking to our game-plan.''
County coach Brian Edwards proferred a philosophical: ``It was just too big a
mountain to climb.'' However, he did give an indication of what might be in
store at Bridgehaugh next season when he observed that the time was now right
for a professional to be in charge of all rugby at Stirling.
``I'll be happy to go along with whatever has to be done but there is a case
for a director of rugby at Stirling. We have the crowds to generate the income
and we have a vast youth programme which has to be looked after properly.''.
q EDINBURGH Academicals, still considering their position in the wake of the
five-month ban imposed on assistant coach David Sole for his ``tantamount to
cheating'' remarks regarding referee Colin Henderson, met at the weekend and
expect to make an official response to the SRU verdict today.
However, The Herald understands that the Academicals' committee is dismayed at
the severity of the sentence and also by the implications of the fact that an
Edinburgh evening newspaper accurately reported the outcome of the Murrayfield
hearing 12 hours before it had taken place.
A Raeburn Place insider said: ``This affair has led to a lot of poisoned
relationships, not least with the refereeing community. Ray Megson, who
intervened when he should not have done with a threat that he would not referee
us in future, is down to do our game against Edinburgh Borderers on Boxing Day.
We shall have to look at whether or not we want him to do that game.''

Morton 1, Dundee United 2
ALAN Mahood came clean after the match. United's opening goal in the first
minute came off his boot, and not that of Grant Johnson as everyone thought.
``If the boy wants to claim it, that's fine by me,'' said the Morton
midfielder. ``The ball came in from the right, John Anderson sliced it, and as
I saw someone coming in to hit it, I stuck out a boot and the ball bobbled past
David Wylie.''
That almost comic-cuts situation summed up Morton's day. They refused to panic
when they gave away another goal after 15 minutes - and again it was one the
Morton defence will want to forget as Dougie Johnstone's weak challenge was
brushed aside by Gary McSwegan, whose shot went in off a post.
The Cappielow side tried to maintain their crisp, passing game - but the only
trouble was that, as often as not, the ball landed at the feet of United
players, and yet another build-up ground to a halt.
The Tannadice side, on the other hand, were quick, incisive, and almost
continental in their play. Morton's poor passing allowed United regularly to
break hard and fast, with the result that Morton were fortunate to lose only
two goals, keeper Wylie and the woodwork saving them on several occasions.
United manager Billy Kirkwood was rightly satisfied. ``That was a good result.
Morton gave us a good, hard game, but I'm just pleased to get three points. If
Morton had won, it would have created a gap between ourselves and the top.
``I felt we needed that two-goal cushion because I knew that Morton would come
back into it. They got the goal and keeper Ally Maxwell had a good save.''
Certainly, the home side played better in the second half, and they piled on
the pressure after Derek Lilley scored with a fine header from a Marko Rajamaki
cross 14 minutes from the end.
With league reconstruction again in the air, Kirkwood added: ``Teams in this
division will always score goals because they seem to throw caution to the wind
a bit more, and put you under pressure.
``This division is more open than the premier. Only three teams from there
would stroll this league, the remainder would find it very difficult, just as
we are at the moment.
``There are eight teams in this division more than capable of playing good
football. You only need to look at the amount of goals scored.''
Kirkwood is reasonably happy with his side's progress towards getting back
upstairs. As he added: ``This is a new team we've thrown together, and getting
back in one season is a tall order, but rest assured we're working hard towards
that end.''
Man of the match was Robbie Winters, who teased and tormented the Morton
defence, particularly down the right wing.
His manager said: ``Robbie had a bad game last week, and that was pointed out
to him, but today, I felt he reacted to that.
``He's more than capable of taking a step up, and I think Craig Brown and his
sidekicks should take a look at Robbie for the under-21s, along with Andy
McLaren.''
Winters himself would be happy to be given a cap call, but he said after the
match: ``The most important thing is for the team to be challenging at the top.
The manager had emphasised the importance of the game, and it means we are now
only two points behind leaders Dunfermline, although we don't want to settle
for that.''
As for Morton, the damage is not too serious, and they're still up in third
place challenging for promotion. Remember, they only came back up from the
second division at the start of this season.
But as assistant manager Peter Cormack said: ``Christmas came early right
enough today. I was disappointed with our start, but at least the players
buckled down and made a game of it.''

Hibernian 1, Raith Rovers 2
RAITH Rovers jetted off to Majorca yesterday for a winter break, content in the
knowledge that they are ahead of schedule in their premier-division ambitions,
and that they are keeping at arm's length from the dogfight developing in the
basement of the top division.
``Yes, we are definitely ahead of schedule,'' said manager Jimmy Nicholl.
``When we were in the premier division two years ago, we won only six games out
of 44. This time, we have already won seven and our league position is
excellent.''
Victory at Easter Road on Saturday was hard earned following a dismal
first-half showing, but once again Nicholl proved his worth as a top-class
manager. He didn't give his players a rollicking at half-time when they went in
a goal behind. Instead, he made a subtle change, switching West Indian Tony
Rougier from the right flank to the left, and things fell into place.
It was Rougier who sparked the fightback, but the man from Trinidad and Tobago
handed the plaudits to Nicholl, even though it is almost certain the Kirkcaldy
manager will block a dream trip to America for the player next month.
Said Rougier, who set up Raith's equalising goal: ``You've got to give the
manager all the credit for what's happening at the club. Nobody knows who is
going to play on a Saturday, but we've all got confidence in the boss that he
will make the right decisions. Today, he spotted something Hibs were doing and
switched me from right to left, and it worked a treat.''
Nicholl would not be drawn on why he made the switch, but almost certainly it
was because Hibs' right back, Andy Millen, was getting forward far too often
for comfort. With Rougier on the left, Millen had far too much to do in a
defensive role to go roving towards his forwards in the second half.
Rougier then revealed that he is wanted by Trinidad and Tobago to play in a
Gold Cup tournament in America next month. ``Negotiations have been going on to
see if I will be available,'' he said. ``The tournament involves countries such
as Brazil, Mexico, and Costa Rica, and it will be valuable experience for our
own World Cup qualifying campaign.
``I don't know if I will be released. It is always a pleasure to play for your
country, but this is my bread and butter, and if I have to stay here, then that
will be fine by me.''
With Raith Rovers in a challenging position for a place in Europe yet again,
Rougier will not be released. But there was no talk of Europe from striker Ally
Graham, who grabbed the winning goal on Saturday.
Graham, who is forming a potent partnership with Stevie Crawford, said:
``Nobody at the club is taking anything for granted. If we finish half way up
the table, it would be ideal, but our main objective is to keep our place in
the premier division - that would be success for us.''
The match itself was a rather flat affair. Raith didn't get started until an
hour had gone, and after Pat McGinlay had put Hibs in front with a cracking
20-yard drive in 17 minutes, the home side hardly made another chance.
Rougier carved out the equaliser after 58 minutes, surviving a tackle which had
him almost on all fours before sending over a cross which Graham knocked on for
Crawford to head past Jim Leighton.
Six minutes later, Crawford paved the way for Graham with a neat lay-off inside
the box, and the big striker sent his shot under Leighton's body.
The Fifers could and should have won more comfortably, while sad Hibs, although
suffering badly through injuries, must quickly find the confidence which has
been lost in recent weeks.

Dundee 0, St Johnstone 1
ST JOHNSTONE striker George O'Boyle may find himself in trouble with his club
this week after his series of histrionics threatened to cloud a big Tayside
derby afternoon for Paul Sturrock's men at Dens Park.
Harsh words to assistant John Blackley followed the Northern Ireland
internationalist's replacement after 73 minutes by comeback man Ian Ferguson,
before O'Boyle gave further vent to his anger by throwing his top into the
dugout as he sulked off.
Even worse, the 28-year-old compounded his felony by gesturing to the St
Johnstone supporters as he made his way towards the dressing-room.
Saints' manager Paul Sturrock, filling a seat in the stand these days as part
of his recuperation from a recent health scare, surely was acting out the role
of the diplomat when he claimed afterwards that he had not seen the incidents.
Laudable sentiments from the club's image-builder, although one finds it
difficult to believe that he will not take sterner action than his intended
``I'll check up on what happened, then have a quiet word with the player.'' A
section of the travelling support may demand more.
That unnecessary outburst apart, Saints' afternoon was trouble-free, winning as
they did with a bit to spare, albeit through an injury-time goal from
industrious midfielder Phil Scott, a deserving cause if ever there was one.
He latched on to the end of an accurate Kevin Twaddle cross to direct his
header low past Michel Pageaud to register goal number four of the season for
the Scotland under-21 cap. But afterwards, Scott took the unusual step of
attributing much of the credit for the last-gasp success to the aforementioned
dugout man, John Blackley.
Scott explained: ``If it had not been for John's words of encouragement to
Kevin, then it probably would not have happened for us. Things had not been
happening for Kevin all afternoon, and he was beginning to let it get him down.
``But John kept shouting at him not to allow the head to drop, and to keep
trying the same things and making the same runs. In the end it paid off for us
in a big way.''
The victory allowed Saints to extend a recent comeback to form which has seen
them edge closer to the leading pack in the first division title race.
Remarkably, for a side which has never been far off the promotion pace all
season, Jim Duffy's Dark Blues have managed just one win in nine Dens Park
outings. Little wonder that the player-manager admits: ``I won't be sorry to
see the back of 1995 as far as home performances are concerned.''
Dundee's home record for the year to date shows 18 home outings, but only five
wins.

<HEADLINE>Job prospects expected to decrease</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM TINNING</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>15</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974831731</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
JOB prospects in Scotland are likely to slip back during the first quarter of
next year, according to a study published today.
The results of a survey of companies' recruitment plans confirm last week's
jobless figures which clearly indicated that the month-by-month reduction in
unemployment had slowed considerably.
Independent consultants Manpower, which interviewed almost 2300 employers
including most of the top 100 companies in the UK, found that 16% of employers
in Scotland anticipated an increase in staffing levels in the next three
months, while 19% predicted a decrease.
The figures represent a slip from the static position registered in the first
three months of this year and are significantly less optimistic than the 10%
positive balance recorded in the past three months.
The slip in optimism for employment prospects in the next quarter places
Scotland well below the national average of 3%. In the 12 areas interviewed in
the survey, 50% predicted a balance of increased job levels while the remainder
predicted a balance of job losses.
On a national level, an overall one-point increase in optimism is recorded
compared to the same period last year, indicating a reversal on the slow-down
experienced in the job market as a whole.
Ms Kathy McDowall, of Manpower, said: ``It is disappointing to see that job
prospects in Scotland are for an overall cut back in employment and that the
figures are worse than last year.'' However, she said Scotland was far from the
worst affected area of the country, recording only a slight downturn.

EAST 1
Currie 45, Watsonians 29
THERE can't be much wrong with a game that produces 13 tries, but these
regional matches do give the coaches a lot to think about.
They are a device for trying out the squad strengths of clubs because so many
regulars are involved in games at other representative levels.
As I said, it was an exciting game to watch. Perhaps the tackling was not as
decisive as in tight league matches, but it did show what can be produced by
uninhibited players.
The inbuilt Watsonians' speed and slick handling got them off to a cracking
start with tries by Martin Macari and Jamie Mayer, the second converted by
Graham Hay, all inside 20 minutes.
In between times, the contrasting style of Currie, using forward strength,
pummelled the visitors' defence, with powerhouse No.8 Mark Blair always to the
fore.
For all the possession generated by the pack, it wasn't until the twenty-eighth
minute that Michael Plumb was put over by Marrack Tomkin.
Blair and Douglas Rogerson set up a touchdown for Scott Forrester in 32 minutes
and five minutes later Plumb ran straight in on another Tonkin pass following
another burst by Blair, and Currie were in the lead. But just before the
interval Watsonians' counter-attacking at speed paid off for the electric Jason
Hutton to go over with Hay converting.
Two tries in the space of two minutes after the turnaround set Currie right
again with Alan Glen getting the first and Rogerson the second.
'Sonians struck back two minutes later when the strong running Graham Inglis
ran round the home defence.
Only a point in it again but then Plumb zipped in for his third try, Tomkin
being the inevitable feed. Plumb became purveyor next and put Neil Mathews away
for another unconverted try. Then the same Plumb put over a penalty.
Back came Watsonians and this time Charlie Crawford went in.
In the last minute, replacement Ian Russell disrupted Hutton's pass under the
posts and Rogerson pounced for the final try, converted by Plumb.
Currie - C Robertson; N Mathews, M Plumb, M Tomkin, S Forrester; J Morrison, D
Rogerson; P Calder, A Glen, D Massie, C Eagle, G Hamilton, F Thompson, M Blair,
S Logan. Replacement - I Russell for Logan (79min).
Watsonians - G Pettigrew; G Inglis, S Carse, J Mayer, P Raeburn; G Hay, J
Hutton; M Stanaway, S Farland, J Liddell, C Young, G MacRaild, J McDonald, C
Crawford, M Macari.
Referee - J Norris (Blyth).
SCORERS: Currie - Plumb, 3t, 1p, 1c; Forrester, 1t; Glen, 1t; Rogerson, 2t;
Mathews, 1t. Watsonians - Macari, 1t; Mayer, 1t; Hutton, 1t; Inglis, 1t;
Crawford, 1t; Hay, 2c.
q DESPITE being well below full strength, Boroughmuir proved too powerful for
Musselburgh at Meggetland, running out comfortable winners 45-8.
The Division Four team made a bright start, going ahead with a penalty by full
back Neil Lockhart in 11 minutes. But Boroughmuir replied with tries from Andy
Knight and Craig Finnie, the latter converted by Bruce Reekie, as was Andy
Miller's try just on half-time, Cliff Livingstone having scored Musselburgh's
only try in 37 minutes. After the break, tries from Gordon Dickson, Neil
Dickson, Scott Anderson, and Craig Hunter, three of them converted by Reekie,
sealed the win.
Preston Lodge finished fourth in Division Three this season behind promoted
Biggar, and lost to them twice. However, they gained some revenge at Pennypit
Park with a 34-13 victory thanks largely to a committed performance by the
forwards.
Edinburgh Wanderers overcame difficult underfoot conditions at Haddington to
beat the home side 24-6, scoring three of their four tries in the first half.

St Mirren 2, Clydebank 1
KEEPING up appearances was the game at Love Street. Both teams polished their
images. Some little changes could mean a lot, especially to St Mirren.
After three games without a win, their struggle to beat Clydebank still leaves
them sitting as low in the league, but more comfortably.
Either they climbed towards the Bankies or pulled them down into their Paisley
burrow, depending on how optimistic a view is taken. At this stage of the
season, it's like deciding whether your glass is half-full or half-empty.
Clydebank's contribution to a brighter December came out of their wardrobe,
sporting a confection of purple and gold that took outrageous courage to don.
Like the gaudy uniforms of armies of yore, the idea must be to frighten their
foes more than embarrass themselves. It worked.
In only five minutes, Saints were so dazzled they lost a silly goal. After a
fluffed free kick by keeper Campbell Money, a cute backheel by James Grady
allowed Joe Robertson to fire home.
Around the middle of the first-half, Clydebank's lurid plumage helped them to
fly. In some rugged encounters, their diminutive forwards kept bravely
out-jumping loftier opponents.
But St Mirren always looked like catching up, although their progress was
seldom smooth. ``We showed our ability only in spasms,'' said manager Jimmy
Bone.
Although the contribution of Jim Dick was as intermittent as everybody else's,
he made his interventions more telling.
He helped Mark Yardley to score on the interval and walloped the winner from
25-yards or so with about a quarter of the match to go.
As their beachwear lost some of its summery shine, Clydebank tried to rally by
ringing changes and pushing Tom Currie into attack.
They seriously missed the injured Ken Eadie. ``None of us worked hard enough
off the ball,'' coach Brian Wright reckoned.
St Mirren's recovery was well served by nippy work by Barry Lavety, while Brian
Hetherston added some touches of exotic class as a right-footed left winger.
Norrie McWhirter made a stalwart return after being off for four months unfit,
and Paul McIntyre's plain toil was outstanding.
A historic footnote to the match was added by Clydebank substitute Craig
Tomlinson, who got booked without having to appear in the musical comedy
costume. He was only jogging around the field when he stopped to remonstrate
with a linesman.

Melrose 18, Selkirk 23. SELKIRK are headed for the third division but not for
long if their method of despatching an admittedly under-strength Melrose in an
entertaining regional league affair at Greenyards is any gauge.
Resilience was one Selkirk victory factor, for Melrose led 15-6 and were still
18-13 ahead with just six minutes left.
John Rutherford and his forwards coach Mick Craig must have been encouraged by
the quality of Selkirk's set-position play.
Melrose captain for the day, Gary Parker, gave a scintillating display as the
livewire who made things happen, with cheeky skills and only an occasional
blemish in restart kicking. He caught virtually the whole of Selkirk on the hop
by hinting legally at a penalty goal attempt and instead taking a quick tap and
accelerating like a startled hare, selling an outrageous dummy, before plunging
over for the opening score.
Later he opened up the Selkirk defence and was twice in the move prior to
floating a long pass to Neil White, who, with classic swerve, beat Darren Hulme
on the outside for a try that restored the Melrose lead at 10-6.
Parker's big penalty goal for obstruction on White stretched Melrose to 18-13.
Jimmy Turnbull gave them something of a cutting edge and Craig Redpath's
encouraging comeback was marked by good vision and several characteristic
head-on sinkings.
Michael Jaffray was dangerous in space, notably in adjusting his angle of run
for his splendid try that, with David Hunter's conversion, cut Melrose to
15-13. Hunter converted both Selkirk tries and landed three penalty goals.
The other Melrose try was by Isaac Feaunati, who blasted on to a close range
penalty feed in unstoppable fashion.
Melrose - A C Redpath; W N White, J G L Turnbull, A M Redburn, A A Purves; G A
Parker, G L Haldane; I W Cornwall, S Scott, C J Bell, S A Aitken, J Henderson,
M Doonan, I Feaunati, A J Kerr. Replacement - R Lothian for Redburn (46 min).

SCORERS: Melrose - White, 1t; Feaunati, 1t; Parker, 1t, 1p. Selkirk - Hunter,

q GALA must have feared that yet again Hawick had fortune on their side as a
15-3 interval lead turned into a 26-15 deficit but they came through for a
30-29 victory at Mansfield Park.
Two Craig Townsend tries, one converted by David Changleng who also kicked a
penalty, produced Gala's first-half points. Hawick's points came from tries by
John Graham and Gregor Sharp, both converted by Colin Turnbull, who also kicked
five penalties.
However, tries by Chris Dalgleish and Scott Paterson, plus another conversion
and penalty from Changleng, brought Gala victory.
Jed-Forest's determination to throw the ball about not only gave them a 42-6
home win over Langholm, but took them to the top of the Bank of Scotland Border
League. Colin Turk kicked a penalty and a drop goal for stuffy Langholm, while
Jed ran in tries through John Skzudro, Brian Law, Kevin Armstrong, Clark
Laidlaw, Mike Yule, and Kevin Amos, who kicked three conversions and two
penalties.
Kelso led only 12-5 at the turn but came through to beat Peebles 31-12 and lead
the South regional league. Jim Thomson had two first-half tries. The brace of
Adam Roxburgh came after the pause, as did the single from Graeme Aitchison,
who also kicked three conversions. Tries for Peebles came from Colin Murray and
Rab Wilson, who converted one.

IT was a scholarly encounter at Westerlands on Saturday when Spartans came out
on top in the Tennents Scottish Cup first-round tie against Glasgow University.
The Edinburgh-based team won 1-0, but with so many students or graduates of the
universities in the capital in their ranks, and given the status of the
opposition, this should have been a chess match or some other intellectual
pursuit.
Spartans' bright sparks played most of the clever football and were able to
withstand a second-half siege after they had gone ahead in only six minutes.
Defender Mark Burns, the man of the match, did the damage with his first goal
for Spartans, heading in a cross by Paddy Durkin.
Spartans' coach, Sam Lynch, a PE teacher, confirmed later that his players
really are dedicated. They are worse off than the usual amateurs - for they
actually pay to play, each player paying in a standing order to a bank which
helps to keep the club afloat. It makes something of a contrast to the heady
days in Barcelona enjoyed by Steve Archibald, the player-manager of their next
opponents, East Fife, who will visit Edinburgh on January 6.
Meanwhile, Deveronvale were booking their second-round place at home to fellow
Highlanders Keith by winning 2-0 away to Albion Rovers. They also revealed to
the near-500 attendance, about half of them having travelled south to
Coatbridge, that there still are hidden areas of Scottish football talent.
Steve Dolan did not get his name on the score-sheet, but rightly earned the
man-of-the-match award for his pace and skill. Any time Deveronvale were under
pressure - which was not often - they were able to give the ball to Dolan and
forget about their worries for five minutes or so.
It was ominous in 25 minutes when Craig Stewart latched on to a through ball
and finished off expertly. Rovers had thrown caution to the wind when they were
caught out five minutes from time, Andy Heggie shooting in from 10 yards to
seal the win.
q CLYDE'S miserable home form continues. They must wonder how they could have
gone so close against Division 2 leaders East Fife and yet ended up on the
wrong end of a 1-0 scoreline.
The Fifers obviously have an explanation, as this was their eighth away win.
That remarkable record shows they do not always depend on the smash-and-grab
method, but that certainly was the case on Saturday.
Clyde can point to efforts by Eddie Annand and Mark Falconer which hit the
woodwork, as well as two goal-line clearances by the Fifers' John McStay. At
the end of the day, however, the only statistic that counts is that Gilbert
Allan netted the Fifers' goal on the hour nark.
Stirling Albion continued the chase in emphatic style with a Steve McCormick
hat-trick in their 5-1 victory over Queen of the South at Dumfries. Alex Bone
and Gary Paterson also were on target in the first half, with Steve Mallan
getting Queens' consolation. Stenhousemuir paid for missed chances after Miller
Mathieson had headed them into the lead at home to Ayr United, whose
player-manager Gordon Dalziel again led by example with the equaliser. Berwick
let a point slip in a 2-2 draw at home to bottom club Montrose.
q Livingston came down to earth with a heavy thud after their cup win at
Stranraer the previous week. Jim Leishman's team suffered their first away
defeat, a 2-0 reverse at Brechin, and their lead in the Third Division is cut
to just two points ahead of their hosts.
A Harry Cairney penalty put City in front and Livingston lost any hope with the
departure of red-carded Tom Graham eight minutes from time. James McKellar
exploited Brechin's numerical superiority with the second goal.
Counters by Dom Callan and Danny Ferry gave Queen's Park victory over Arbroath,
Ross County had to settle for a 2-2 draw against Alloa, while keeper Neil
Russell was the home hero in Cowdenbeath's goalless draw against Caley Thistle.

A FREELANCE photographer who circulated nude shots of Italian skier Alberto
Tomba claimed he was injured by a crystal trophy cup hurled yesterday by the
World Cup champion in Alta Badia, Italy.
Aldo Martinuzzi said the skier threw the cup and a champagne bottle at him
during the awarding ceremony of a World Cup giant slalom, in which Tomba
finished third.
``I managed to avoid the bottle, but I was hit by the cup. He did it
deliberately. He hit me on purpose,'' said Martinuzzi. He added that he planned
to sue the 28-year-old skier.
Martinuzzi showed a finger cut, which, he said, was probably caused by a glass
splinter.
Tomba, an officer in the Carabinieri paramilitary police, denied it had been
deliberate. ``I was trying to throw the cup to my sister to avoid it being
stolen. I received a push from the Austrian trainer and the cup accidentally
fell on the photographer. I apologise, but I want to add he was probably
punished, inadvertently, for his misbehaviour,'' Tomba said.
The pair have been on icy terms since the publication this summer of the nude
pictures, which date back to 1988, but were revived during a flurry of photo
spreads in Italian magazines of naked male celebrities.
Austrian Hans Knaus scored his first World Cup victory at Alta Badia, ending
Swiss Michael Von Gruenigen's 100% record in the three giant slaloms this
season.
Knaus was fastest in both legs and won with a combined time of 2min.35.34sec.
Von Gruenigen put in a storming second run to be just 0.69sec behind. Tomba
finished third in 2-36.71.

THE slowdown in economic activity has played havoc with the Treasury's Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement projections forcing the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to forecast a #29bn PSBR for the current fiscal year to the end of
March.
This was #7500m more than he had thought likely when he presented his 1994
Budget. Later today, the PSBR figures for November are due. Some improvement on
the performance in November 1994 is needed to keep the Chancellor on track to
meet even his revised forecast. James Capel economists have pencilled in a PSBR
of #2800m, which would be #800m lower than the figure for the same month last
year. No privatisation proceeds are expected.
November is not a big month for Government revenues. Make or break for the
Chancellor will come in January, the most important month in the year for the
collection of corporation tax.
One of the factors dictating the Chancellor's cautious approach to interest
rates has been the strength of broad money, whose growth rate is close to the
top of its 3% to 9% monitoring range.
November's money supply figures, due to be released by the Bank of England on
Wednesday, are expected to show a decline in M4 lending from October's #5600m
to #3500m. But broad M4 is thought to have grown at 0.8% month-on-month,
leaving the annual rate unchanged at 8.7%.
Non-EU trade figures, also due on Wednesday, should produce a lower deficit of
around #800m for November, against an erratically high #1200m in October.
The National Accounts and the balance of payments figures for the third quarter
are both published on Thursday. Capel is forecasting that a recovery in
invisibles will enable the current account deficit to improve from #2400m in
the second quarter to #1400m.
The accounts will be closely studied for trends in the savings ratio and to see
if there is any revision to the 0.4% growth in gross domestic product, already
estimated for the quarter.
TODAY - Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (November).
TOMORROW - None announced.
WEDNESDAY - M4 (November); balance of trade with countries outside the EU
(November).
THURSDAY - National Accounts (third quarter); balance of payments (third
quarter).
FRIDAY - None announced.

q RANGERS manager Walter Smith has agreed to take a squad north for Forres
Mechanics defender Steve Mackay's testimonial on a date to be fixed early next
year.
Mackay has resumed training after 10 weeks out through injury, but is coming to
the end of his playing career, and Forres manager, George Cowie, believes the
guaranteed large crowd will prove a fitting tribute to his player.
The Morayshire club beat Clach on Saturday, with goals from Norman Thomson and
Stuart McCraw. Huntly showed no signs of missing Caley Thistle new boy Brian
Thomson as they stayed seven points ahead of Cove Rangers at the top of the
table with a 6-2 win at home to Rothes.

THE Scotland clash with England which will be played at Wembley on June 15
dominated yesterday's draw for the European Championship finals in England next
summer.
Even the fact that Craig Brown's team must open these finals at Villa Park five
days earlier against the Dutch masters of soccer could not overshadow the
return of the oldest international fixture in world football. As he surveyed
the situation which also saw Switzerland in the same group, Scotland manager
Brown forecast: ``We can sneak through to the quarter-finals. I spoke to Colin
Hendry just after the draw had been made and we both agreed on that. He is
playing down here, he is our big Braveheart in English football, and he thinks
the same as I do that we have a chance.
``The problem we have is that the whole of Scotland will be focusing on the
game against England at Wembley. The public will be doing that, so will the
media, and so will some of my players. Myself and the rest of the backroom
staff must make certain that they concentrate the same way on all three games.
``We have to get the players to peak three times in an eight-day spell if we
are going to qualify, and we will go through only if we are at our very best in
every match.''
The task of being one of the two countries to go into the quarter-final games
is immense for the Scots who did qualify for England when so many wrote them
off but could not do so with any great style.
Brown is aware that he has few players available who can equal the entertaining
skills of Holland who were installed as favourites to win the tournament after
the draw had been completed but, perhaps, the organisation, the team spirit,
and the work ethic he has concentrated upon will worry the two other sides.
England coach Terry Venables said later: ``This is a draw which will make life
very difficult for us. I have to point out that while I am saying that so is
every other coach I spoke to. Everyone believes their games will be difficult.
However, I'm confident that we can go through.
``Basically because of the quality of the teams who are going to be here next
summer it was always going to be difficult. Scotland will always be a problem
for us and they come to these finals after a tremendous late run in their
qualifying group.
``The Dutch, well, they are simply brilliant. I am a great admirer of both Ajax
and the national team and the way they play the game. But there is no doubt
Scotland and Switzerland, who are managed by Roy Hodgson, an Englishman, will
give us other kinds of problems.
``We know that and it will be the team who perform well on the day who will
win. Past results against each other won't matter.''
That will give Brown some encouragement because in the last two matches when
Scotland played England the Scots lost on both occasions.
In 1988, Peter Beardsley scored the only goal of the game at Wembley and a year
later at Hampden, Chris Waddle and Steve Bull were the scorers in England's 2-0
victory.
Brown said: ``All three games will have to be handled differently, and we must
start our preparations for them now. Being kept apart from the Danes means that
our friendly against them will go ahead in April. Now Italy and Germany have
expressed interest in playing us too and that would be some time in March. That
is the kind of opposition I would enjoy and the kind we need to prepare
ourselves for these group matches.
``On the playing side we will continue to look at ways to make us still
stronger and we will be looking very closely at Duncan Ferguson. If he can show
consistency with Everton, pick up a few goals, and display all the talents we
know he possesses then he could be very important for us.
``When you talk to managers down here in England they all have a huge respect
for him, one which borders almost on fear.''
Meanwhile, Dutch manager Guus Hiddink, the envy of every coach in Birmingham
because he can call on the skills of such as Seedorf, Overmars, Bergkamp, and
Kluivert, attempted to play down his country's position as favourites.
``This has been based on one good game,'' he said. ``We played very well
against Ireland last week at Anfield and that is why people are now making us
favourites for the tournament.
``But if any of you had seen us in Minsk after we lost to Belarus then your
thoughts would be different. At that time we were out. I could not see us
qualify. We came here to England through the kitchen door and we know that.''
The Swiss coach Hodgson, who is also in charge of Inter Milan, did not attend
the draw. But his right hand man Hans Peter Zaugg pointed out: ``We have had
consistency of selection and that has been our strength. We went to the World
Cup finals in the USA and now we come to England.
``Remember, too, we stopped Scotland in the last World Cup. We went to the
United States instead of them.''
Brown has not forgotten that and he said: ``We have a score to settle with the
Swiss.''
On the programming of the games, Holland first, England next, and the Swiss
last, Brown admitted: ``It is a hard shout to go in against the Dutch first,
but to balance that it's nice to have England in the middle.
``That is the soft part of the qualifying sequence when you are neither in nor
out and it's good to face the English in that game.''
Brown was hoping last night that the Scots will get enough tickets for the
games at Villa Park to allow the fans to take over the 14,000-seater Holte end
stand behind one of the goals.
In their group the Dutch are out on their own and as Hiddink points out, the
English will have home advantage to lift them even if they drop below their
best.
It was not surprising that the bookmakers placed Scotland at 50-1 along with
Switzerland and Turkey with only the Czech Republic at 80-1 further away from
the 9-2 Dutch.
The poor Czechs are in probably the toughest group of all with Germany, Italy,
and Russia.
Brown still sees Russia at 14-1 as the best bet to take the title. We shall see.
However no-one can suggest that Scotland will win. All Brown can hope is that
his players do as well as they did in the long, gruelling campaign to qualify.
That will probably not be enough at this more elevated level.

AMERICAN FOOTBALL
BRETT Favre threw for 308 yards and four touchdowns on Saturday and the Green
Bay Packers, buoyed by the return of defensive end Reggie White, qualified for
the National Football League play-offs for a third straight year with a 34-23
victory over the New Orleans Saints.
The win positioned the Packers (10-5) to clinch their first NFC Central
championship since 1972.
White, the NFL's career leader with 157 sacks, was expected to miss the rest of
the year, and the play-offs, with an injured left hamstring which was assumed
to need surgery. But he returned to practise on Thursday and entered the game
on the          Packers' third defensive play.
He injured the hamstring two weeks ago against Cincinnati and missed last
Sunday's game at Tampa Bay - the first game he missed because of injury in his
11-year NFL career.
Favre, who completed the first six passes he threw, advanced his claim for the
NFL's Most Valuable Player award by completing 12 of 18 passes for 203 yards
and four touchdowns in the first half.
It was the second time this season that Favre, who grew up about 60 miles from
New Orleans, passed for four touchdowns in a game. He completed 21 of 30 passes
on the day.
The loss guaranteed the Saints     (6-9) a second straight losing season.
Earlier on Saturday, Pittsburgh's defence scored late in each half and Neil
O'Donnell threw a 62-yard touchdown pass to Ernie Mills with 1min 28sec left,
rallying the Steelers past the New England Patriots 41-27.
It was the Steelers' eighth straight victory, improved their record to
11-4, and assured them of a first-round bye of the play-offs.

DOCTOR Kennedy said: ``your heart appears to be pumping normally.''
It looked that way to me, too, or at least there was this thing going in and
out on the X-ray screen to my left anyway with the dye flowing through it.
``Now for your coronary arteries.'' Ya beezer, not even all the temazepam in
the hospital had me quite relaxed enough. ``Take a deep breath.'' Three tree
roots filled up with black stuff on the screen as the little wire went into
them, one after the other.
I knew I was either knackered or OK. What the hell does a 38-year-old who works
every day of his life do if he has heart disease? Switch off and smell the
flowers? I don't want to switch off and I don't like gardening.
Fifteen minutes later and the film had been processed. ``Your heart is 100%
fine,'' said the doctor. ``You have had a viral infection of your heart lining
called viral pericarditis. No six o'clock in the morning swimming like an idiot
and no mountain climbing for a while.''
To the young players of today - be careful and don't do what I have just done,
which is land up in hospital by behaving like a buffoon and exercising while
obviously suffering from a virus.
Then I did what I haven't done in a long time and that was stay in on a
Saturday and watch the TV.
England v Western Samoa. Let's not beat about the bush here, because if there
are many more international games of rugby like that one then we're up a
certain creek without a paddle.
One thing shot through my mind immediately. Where was the atmosphere? I know
Murrayfield has changed into a great big, soulless lump of concrete, but I
didn't appreciate 75,000 folk could make so little noise. If I was one of
rugby's administrators that silence would prey on my senses and give me the
heebie jeebies.
I can't think of a more obvious sign that folk turn up to big rugby games to be
entertained than the noise of booing when England chose to go for kicks at
goal. The sooner the law makers grab the game and scrap static penalties the
better.
All kicks at goal, including conversions, should be drop kicks. Why not even
punts? All to be taken within a time period of, say, 10 seconds. The second
thing that grabbed me was that, just like Scotland, England's individual man on
the ball skills aren't as good as the Western Samoans. Why? I don't understand.
England won all that ball, and then couldn't make ground with it.
The worrying thing, long term, for Northern Hemisphere rugby is that you can
always teach an athletic, open-field player to be tighter and more dynamic in
close rucking positions, and lineouts, and scrums, but it's harder to get a
grafter to play open-field ball handling on the break and cause havoc.
The English, plainly, don't have a whole team of ball players, and the laws
favour strong static teams. All this guff they have given us for years about
wanting to play open, attacking rugby has been a complete smoke screen for what
they have always really wanted to do, and that is maul, kick for position, and
kick for penalties to get points up before they spread the ball.
SURE they've had great players like Brian Moore, Rob Andrew, Dean Richards, and
the like, but there will have been few teams trembling in their boots if those
lads started a counter attack, I can tell you. Better to leave them to it and
just to wait for someone to drop the ball.
Northern Hemisphere rugby, France excepting, is stilted stuff. It always has
been. Here in Scotland, we like to think we can play the game but we know, deep
in our hearts and unlike our cousins South of the border, that we are limited
compared to the world's great.
How much longer do we have to watch this tosh? There I was thinking I hadn't
the heart to get stuck into things any more when there's damn all wrong with
it. Smell the flowers? You're joking.

THIS is a time of living dangerously for the Scottish Rugby Union, and if they
are to extricate themselves unscathed from the minefield into which they have
stumbled, it will require the kind of deft footwork of which their detractors
consider them incapable.
A rift of Grand Canyon proportions is developing between Murrayfield and some
of the leading clubs, and it seems only a compromise will bridge it.
The issue is who will represent Scotland in next season's European Cup? A
challenge to the SRU's proposal that it should be districts grows more likely
by the day. The top clubs are incensed by the decision which they see as
wrong-headed and weakening the strong so that the weak might be strengthened.
Well, we still believe it should be districts in Europe, but one means by which
the club lobby could be placated is to make it two districts and a club - the
league or cup champions sounds about right and, unless they are one and the
same, why not a play-off between the two title-holders to settle the third
place in Europe?
The statement issued by the SRU last week in which they sought to justify the
districts' decision, served merely to further inflame the situation. The
pro-clubs lobby had thought the SRU had merely put forward a proposal.
The statement, however, referred to a ``decision'' and, later on, referred to a
``decision . . . to propose.'' Language is a precise science and, in this
instance, the experiment has gone sadly agley.
Additionally, SRU chief executive Bill Hogg may have been stating the truth
when he referred to the ``narrow self-interest of a few clubs'' but, in the
current tense situation, that was inflammatory Perhaps some more diplomatic
turn of phrase would have served better.
Talk of a breakaway by the top clubs is still just that - talk. But there is a
very real discontent at the manner in which the SRU have handled thinhgs.
The English and Welsh unions have, for now, managed to parry similar talk, but,
just last week, we were told by one normally mild-mannered club official that
the time was probably right for the premiership clubs to do their own thing and
let the SRU look after the by-laws and the rest.
His argument was along the lines of what have the SRU done for us apart from
build a superb stadium and saddle us all with a #5-plus million overdraft?
Well, he spoke from the heart rather than the head, but he was merely
articulating a growing feeling out there in clubland.
The clubs, of course, have within their power a solution much simpler than a
breakaway. If they do not like what the SRU are doing then they do not like
what their own representatives are doing on their behalf. If you don't like it
then mobilise and change it through the democratic process.
Where the clubs do score a major point is in the area of what happens to the
cash from European competition? There are suggestions - and hopefully they are
no more than that - to the effect that the SRU will endeavour to spread the
Euro cash as widely as possible. This is folly.
PAYMENT for involvement in the European Cup should go to the players and clubs
involved in the competition. It should go, also, to the district sides they
represent with a handling fee to the SRU. It should not go to every club in the
land. That really would dilute the proceeds too much.
Afinal thought on the David Sole affair. David was undoubtedly wrong to have
said what he did (but it was said in the heat of the moment) and, probably,
should have gone to Murrayfield to take his medicine in person. However, in
this case the punishment does not fit the crime.
Also, what action do the SRU propose to take against Ray Megson for his
anarchic declaration that he would not referee Accies? And what action will the
SRU take against Edinburgh Academicals, or any other club for that matter, if
they were to declare that they would prefer not to be refereed by Mr Megson in
future? Makes you think, doesn't it?

EUROPEAN CURLING CHAMPIONSHIPS
SCOTLAND'S men's team - Roger McIntyre, Mike Hay, Norman Brown, and skip Hammy
McMillan - beat Switzerland 4-2 in Saturday's final to become the first team to
retain the European title.
Earlier, the Scottish women, led by Kirsty Hay, had to settle for silver as
they went down by 3-8 to Germany in their final.
McMillan's team played with authority throughout their game and deserved the
victory. Winning the toss gave Switzerland last stone at the first end, but the
Scots opened the game so strongly that when he came to play his final stone,
Swiss skip Andre Flotron was tested straight away, having to draw against three
Scottish stones in the house.
Scotland levelled the scores at the second when McMillan also drew well, and
they then forced Switzerland to take a single at the third. From this point on
and although 1-2 down, the Scots dictated the remainder of the game. At the
seventh end, the Swiss drew to the back of an empty house with their last
stone, which McMillan hit out. This time, rather than blank as in earlier ends,
he stayed in the house and took a single to level the scores.
A good double take-out by Mike Hay set the Scots up in the eighth end, and they
stole a single to take the lead for the first time in the game when Flotron was
too heavy with his final draw.
Again, the Scots played aggressively in the ninth end and this time the Swiss
were left with an ambitious raised take out to score. This shot just missed the
Scottish stone in the four-foot circle, giving Scotland another steal of one
which, with Scotland clearing everything out of the tenth end, proved to be
enough for victory.
Scotland's women had reached their final undefeated, including a round-robin
win over their German opponents, but they did not play well enough for victory
on Saturday.
Throughout the game, second player Karen Addison and third Edith Loudon
misjudged their shots. Skip Kirsty Hay struggled to find draw weight throughout
the game, including her final shot at the third end, which rolled on too far
when she had a chance to score two.
By contrast, the German skip, Andrea Schopp, was in match-winning form and had
two excellent double take outs at crucial points in the game. Her first big
shot got her out of trouble in the fourth and in the tenth, her final stone not
only cleared a Scottish counter, it gave Hay no route through with her final
stone which caught a guard and cruelly gave Germany a score of four from the
end. Results:
Women: Final - Germany 8, Scotland 3. Bronze - Norway 5, Sweden 7.

DESPITE having nursed a cold for most of the preceding week, Phil Mowbray
became the first student to win the men's title in the Cumbernauld Inter-area
cross-country match, and in doing so claimed scalps which promote him as a
credible candidate for the season's highest honours.
Over perhaps the most unrelenting course in Scotland, it was the Edinburgh
University man who maintained the pressure, then broke three of the country's
leading exponents in the final 2000m.
He was seven seconds clear of fast-closing Commonwealth track internationalist
Chris Robison, with Britain's European championship reserve, Steven Wylie, a
further five seconds down, in third. Other victims included internationalists
Graeme Wight, the East League's Mr Consistency, Davie Ross, and hill-runner
Peter Dymoke.
It was the 22-year-old Mowbray's first cross-country outing since last winter,
when flu destroyed his hope of winning the British Universities' title. That
was the final disappointment of a winter in which he was selected for a senior
UK debut indoor track vest, but withdrew through illness.
Mowbray has higher aspirations now - a place at the world student cross-country
championships and in the UK senior team for the world cross-country
championships in South Africa.
However, there has been a price to pay - credibility with his club, Hunters Bog
Trotters. ``I have done much more mileage this winter - around 90 per week -
and I have not seen so much of the Trotters,'' he said.
The Edinburgh club, famed for their anti-elitist ethos, earthy humour, and
hedonistic priciples, hold regular gatherings in a capital watering hole. ``But
I've missed a lot of these lately,'' confessed Mowbray. ``I've been training
really hard, in the hope of doing something respectable at 5000 metres next
summer.''
His domination of Robison, in particular, suggests this is no idle hope. A
sub-four minute miler, Robison also has a string of world cross-country
appearances behind him.
``I'm happy to have won over such a dangerous course,'' added Mowbray with a
mischievous grin. Some of the East team, notably Scott Cohen, had declined
selection because of perceived problems. In fact the course, admittedly drier
and less slippery than last year, received unanimous praise.
The only disappointment was the absence of such as Tommy Murray, Robert Quinn,
and Glen Stewart from Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council's event.
However, Mowbray may not have to wait long to test himself. These three, plus
Mowbray, Robison, Wylie, and Dymoke, are among a quality field invited to the
Durham international a week on Saturday. ``Don't look for me to show everthing
there,'' pleads Fifer Mowbray. ``It's more important to be in shape at the end
of February, and through March.''
West's Vikki McPherson, Scotland's Commonwealth team captain, celebrated
passing final CA exams with victory in her first race since the world half
marathon championships in October.
``Career-wise, that's a weight off my mind and I can now concentrate on getting
back into Britain's team for the worlds in South Africa,'' said the City of
Glasgow runner.
McPherson missed out this year, having been a fixture for three preceding
seasons. ``I am also concentrating on making the Olympic team at 10,000m.''
McPherson was already clear of the field after half a mile and won
unchallenged, but East, led by Sue Ridley, filled the next five places to sweep
their fourth female team title of the day.
Ridley held off Aberdeen's Debbie Kilner by just one second and Great Britain
internationalists Alison Rose and Trudi Thomson were immediately behind
followed by Dundee's Alison Carr. The Scottish Women's League champion, who
broke two of Liz McColgan's records as a teenager, but in her first full season
after an absence of more than a decade, should be encouraged to have run so
well, so soon, in such strong company.

Joan McFadden profiles a man who brings joy to the young victims of Bosnia
THE couple of weeks before Christmas are always filled with anticipation.
There's so much to be organised before the celebrations can truly begin, and
the hustle and bustle seems never-ending. Margaret McKenzie is just like
everyone else as she plans for Christmas, but throughout every busy day and
long night her thoughts constantly return to her husband, Robert.
His efforts to make a better Christmas for others involve a great deal more
than a few hours of shopping. He is currently driving a 30-tonne lorry to
Bosnia, packed with gifts from all across Britain.
Operation Christmas Child has been organised and, to some extent, funded by
Samaritan International, an ecumenical Christian movement which has been taking
much-needed supplies to Bosnia for some time. There are five other lorries
travelling with Robert's, carrying a total of 40,000 boxes to children in
desperate poverty. The average gift consists of a shoe box, with every
available inch of space crammed with practicalities such as soap and warm
socks, with a small toy and sweets.
There is something really sad about the amount of joy these boxes will bring.
The contents seem so meagre compared with the excessive gifts heaped around our
Christmas trees. But Robert and Margaret concentrate only on the children they
are trying to help, and don't waste time criticising people for wanting to
over-indulge their own families.
In the week leading up to the trip, Robert was torn between his own fears and
concern for Margaret waiting for his safe return. This is the sixth time he has
made the journey, but the dangers have not lessened. On the contrary, the drive
at this time of year is fraught with more perils due to poor weather and
worsening road conditions.
Four years ago, Robert would never have considered putting himself in danger
for hundreds of people he had never met. He was going through life with a
feeling of dread, convinced that everything was meaningless. Then he noticed a
bus called the King's Coach parked near his local supermarket, and decided to
have a look to see what was being promoted. He could never have anticipated the
product was Jesus, but that weekend changed his life.
He became a Christian and as time went by became sure God wanted him to help
people. He volunteered his services to Samaritan International, and spends all
his spare time encouraging, cajoling and involving others in his concerns for
the children of Bosnia. His description of the living conditions in camps and
derelict buildings are shocking in their simplicity, but he doesn't preach
universal salvation or responsibility.
Every donation, no matter how small, is treated with the same courtesy and
gratitude, and he has an unerring knack in explaining the far-reaching benefits
of every contribution.
He brings back photos from each trip so those who help can witness the reaction
to their involvement, and in every pathetic scene he sees hope.
The Bosnian situation is ongoing, and at times the general public become inured
to suffering, but it is the consistent volunteers who make the vital difference
to the lives of the victims.
Robert anticipates being involved in their care for years to come. He won't
consider himself a hero, pointing out he is scared everytime he goes, and
remains sure all he's doing is what anyone else could do.
Meanwhile, Margaret waits at home in Milton of Campsie, mentally travelling
with his convoy to Zagreb, and then deep into the heart of Sarajevo. He hopes
to return by December 22, and Margaret does the only thing she knows to help
him safely home. ``I pray to God to send his angels to go ahead of him and
behind him, and to watch over him every inch of the way.''

HOCKEY
THEY rear their players tough in Dundee, but they come no tougher than the
Insights Menzieshill captain John Christie, who inspired his side to their
fifth Scottish indoor league title in six years despite playing throughout the
final phase with a broken right hand.
The former Scottish international defied medical advice and played in the last
five matches over the weekend and averaged two goals a game as they went
through their programme with a maximum record.
Christie, however, was restricted to just a single strike in the championship
decider against arch-rivals MIM, but the fast-emerging Kevin Squire was on hand
to do the damage on this occasion, scoring half their goals in their 8-5
victory in what was unquestionably the highlight of the weekend.
In the early stages, Menzieshill established supremacy and by the second minute
of the second-half had built up a 5-1 lead. Then three goals in six minutes
from corner conversions by Gavin Markham put the game back in the melting pot
only for the Edinburgh men to suffer a disaster.
Paul Chowdry was banished to the ``sin bin'' for a foul on Bruce Cuthill and
during his enforced rest Squire responded with two goals in 90 seconds to make
sure it was Christie who received the trophy from the Scottish Hockey Union
vice-chairman, Brian McArtney.
Clydesdale, 24 hours earlier, sealed the Division 2 title but Steve Short,
unlike Christie, didn't receive his trophy from which to sip his champagne.
They saw off the challenge of Stepps by winning the final encounter 13-8 with
Short scoring seven.
In the women's game, Ellen Murray and Wendy Fraser kept Western Klick
Photopoint hot on the heels of pacesetters Edinburgh Ladies in the National
Indoor League at the Bell's Sports Centre, Perth, on Saturday when scoring hat
tricks in their side's 7-0 defeat of Glasgow rivals Hyndland.
Edinburgh are a very talented side as they demonstrated in beating Clydesdale
8-0, with Sharon Bissett scoring three. But indoor hockey has regularly
confirmed the theory there are no certainties in the sport.
Meanwhile, in the second division, Royal High Gymnasts have forged ahead at the
halfway stage after beating their main rivals Pentlands 2-1 when Morag Lunn
snatched victory two minutes from time.

n THE realisation that it was the season of goodwill came one Sunday morning as
I drove to make my usual offering at the church of SS Bernard and Quentin,
patron saints of DIY. On my way, I passed a small van parked on the verge of a
country lane. It belonged to one of the more reputable (allegedly) garden
centres. Its driver was on the other side of the road, plundering berried holly
from the hedgerow. I kid you not.
A few days later, coincidentally, there was the sudden appearance on the
breakfast table of an Argos catalogue, strategically opened at girl-type gift
pages. Over the next few days it kept reappearing, with ever thicker circles
around coveted items.
So on a recent business trip I was well prepared for the Christmas musak at the
hotel I was staying in - and it still wasn't even quite the end of November.
The company I was visiting, near Newcastle, was most concerned that if I wanted
to get home at some reasonable hour I should set off early in the afternoon.
The Metro Centre was between us and the road to Glasgow, and traffic for miles
around came to a standstill at about three o'clock. The time for buying
presents, for sailing ever closer to bankruptcy, had arrived.
Okay, so we have been all saying for years that Christmas isn't what it used to
be, it's all so commercial now - although I bet it isn't really much worse than
when I was a lad. Most of us try, a bit, to hold back the tide of want, want,
want. Reinforcing the religious origin is all very well if you ignore the
precursor pagan festivals, which might have looked all too familiar if they had
had Nintendo and Barbie in those days. Our family's ritual Christmas Day binge,
ending in a row over what to watch on TV, has definite pagan undertones.
Just a day or so ago we learned how even the classics of literature had
suffered at the hands of commercialism. We were talking about Ebeneezer
Scrooge. More accurately I was being compared with the said gentleman. But no
matter. We asked the children where he was a character from. A book by Charles
Dickens, replies one child, and we are very impressed. What's it called, we
ask. The Muppets Christmas Carol comes the reply. Jim Henson would have been
proud.
However, this tale has a happy ending. Christmas for me really has already
started. My daughter, knowing my taste for chocolate, gave me my Christmas
present on my return from the deep south - a chocolate Advent Calendar. Some of
the commercialism isn't really all that bad . . .

TRAINER Len Lungo's patience paid off at the weekend when Swanbister (25-1)
landed the ``bumper' at Haydock, completing a 64-1, across-the-card double for
the Dumfriesshire stable.
At Catterick, Livio had won the Levy Board Hurdle, bringing Lungo's winners
tally for the season so far to seven.
He was well pleased with the success of Swanbister as his runner saw off
several fancied runners from yards down south. ``He's one of the promising
young horses I've been nursing along,'' said Lungo. ``I bought him unbroken at
the Fairyhouse Derby Sales. He cost about 15,000 guineas and will now be worth
six times that amount.''
Tom Dyer's Marco Magnifico 12-1, ran away with the Ampleforth Hurdle at
Catterick, piloted by Jason Callaghan. The five-year-old, third to Runaway Pete
in September, had been placed three times in six outing, but this was his first
success.
This afternoon, Shaarid makes the long journey from Berkshire to Edinburgh when
he reverts to fences in the Table Chase. Ian Balding's seven-year-old won three
times last season, and with Jamie Osborne in the saddle today, Shaarid should
win comfortably.
Susan Bradburne, who had a 38-1 double at the last meeting with Charming Gale
and Blue Charm, runs Willie Sparkle today. He unseated Andrew Watt when poised
to challenge at Sedgefield two weeks ago but brought home the beer in the
Federation Brewery Handicap at Hexham a month earlier.
Master Of The Rock, who has been running consistently with three wins from five
outings, could make his low weight pay in the Gas Handicap Hurdle over three
miles, but neither Tallywagger nor Shannon Glen can be discounted.
Adamatic, who landed the ``bumper' by six lengths at the last meeting for
trainer Dick Allan, is bound to be offered at cramped odds for the Short Hole
National Hunt Flat race, but Howard Johnston's Direct Route has won all his
three races and will be hard to peg back.
The unknown quantities are Lucinda Russell's Jaydalay and Mary Reveley's Pinny,
both newcomers.

Many families find separation hardest to cope with during the season of peace
and goodwill
FOR families which are splitting up, Christmas can become the cruellest
battleground. All parents want to spend the special day with their children,
but when parents don't want to spend it with one another, someone is going to
be left out.
``It is a time when people are expected to be happy, but that in itself is
extra pressure for people going through the unhappiness of separation and
divorce,'' says Sue Matheson, director of Family Mediation Scotland.
Saddest of all is the increased number of parents who end up in court at this
time of year, hoping a judge will rule in favour of one.
``We know we are asking a lot of parents, but if they can put their own needs
aside their children can celebrate Christmas without feeling they are being
unfair to one parent.
``Everyone has to come to their own arrangements, but if they are made early
enough, children should be able to spend some time with each parent and with
grandparents, aunts and uncles without resentment from the other side of the
family.
``It is important to encourage them to go off and have a good time with the
other parent, even if you do have a private weep later on,'' she adds.
Family Mediation points out that Christmas can increase all the difficulties
routinely faced by separating families. Many problems stem from the fact that
families and Christmas have an emotional connection and it is a time when
memories, positive and negative, come flooding back.
Consumer pressures on low-income families are very difficult and they can be
made worse if the parents are drawn into competing with each other.
``Try to co-operate instead of competing over buying presents, if possible,''
say the mediators. They also suggest allowing children to have some input in
what the arrangements should be and making them as early as possible, so that
children do not have to be anxious in the lead-up to Christmas about where they
will spend it.
One suggestion they make for sharing time is that children stay with one parent
on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning with a hand-over on Christmas Day itself
so that the other parent has the afternoon and Boxing Day.
Not everyone will be able to satisfy the logistics of that, even with goodwill,
but it does offer a basis for negotiation.
All the in-law problems of two-parent families are doubled for timeshare and
stepfamilies - and some thought has to be given to rivalries and tensions
between new stepbrothers and sisters, for example, as well as the possibility
of different family rituals to cope with.
Often it is the first Christmas as a broken family which is most difficult for
everyone - parents and children - to deal with, even for relatively simple
things such as how to buy and deliver presents for the parent they do not live
with and the extended family they do not see regularly.
``Christmas is a time for children as well as peace and goodwill. The vital
thing for parents is not to argue in front of or over the children,'' says
Matheson.
n Family Mediation Scotland has 11 centres around the country which can be
contacted on 0131 220 1610. They warn it may be difficult to get an appointment
between now and Christmas, but are always willing to help parents in difficulty.

North and Midlands 8,
Scottish Exiles 21
IT always seemed a difficult mission for North and Midlands going into their
match against the Scottish Exiles at Rubislaw without the core of key Stirling
players. In the event, the predictions were accurate.
North and Midlands were for the most part on the receiving end of an Exiles
side which, according to their coach Al McHarg, ``probably played their best
rugby of the series'' in winning their third championship match although
neither Derrick Patterson nor Andy Nicol were there to control matters at the
base of the scrum, Patterson having called off because of flu and Nicol having
broken a finger while playing in a match on Friday.
Ironically for North, it was not the pressure applied by the Exiles pack that
cost them dearly. Of the three tries scored by the Exiles, two were the result
of unforced errors, the other the product of a strike against the head.
Martin Scott's strike caught the North defence in the wrong mode as Aaron James
made the running before putting left wing Gavin Thompson in at the corner for
an unconverted try after only six minutes.
As they had done last week against South, North and Midlands tended to spin the
ball wide when a forward-based attacking strategy might have produced better
results, but they did reap a reward as Bryan Easson kicked a penalty goal. But
barely had the scoreboard registered the points than full back Rowen Shepherd
opted to attack just outside his own 22 only to see his pass to Simon Burns go
wide of the intended receiver. John Kerr got back splendidly to rescue but from
the ensuing ruck Stuart Laing fed Eric Peters for the No.8 to score an easy try.
Just before half time, however, North and Midlands made the breakthrough they
needed. Murray Fraser broke from the base of a ruck before passing inside to
Kerr who then put Easson in unopposed for a fine try which the stand-off
converted.
Two penalty goals by Laing dented the confidence of North and Midlands but once
again the real killer blow was self-inflicted.
A promising attacking situation turned to disaster as McIvor spilled a pass
with a score beckoning. Burns got back to retrieve but by then the Exiles
forwards were there in number to recyle the ball. From the ruck, Tony
Wither-Green, the deputising scrum half, put in a delicate kick to the
unguarded left flank and the ball sat up perfectly for Gavin Thompson who timed
his run to perfection to gather and then race some 50 metres for the try.
North and Midlands - R Shepherd (Melrose); S Burns (Edinburgh Academicals), P
Rouse (Dundee HSFP), A Carruthers (Kirkcaldy), J Kerr (Watsonians); B Easson

Edinburgh 31, South of Scotland 30
EDINBURGH keep on track for a share of the inter-district championship after
this thoroughly entertaining Meggetland tussle in which the city side played
most of the rugby and South were kept in the hunt, mostly, through the boot of
Scott Welsh.
Edinburgh dominated up front where Scott Murray and Darren Burns cleaned up at
the lineout. Even on their own ball, the South lineout was at sixes and sevens,
giving the returning Gary Armstrong - who is now at an advanced stage in his
negotiations with Newcastle - the very devil of an afternoon with some of the
sharpnel which came his way.
Another districts returnee, Peter Wright, having served his suspension and
slotted straight into the Edinburgh front row, looked not unexpectedly
ring-rusty and even managed to keep his tongue in check. In fact it was not
until the thirty-fifth minute that he let a bon mot slip in the direction of
English referee Steve Lander, who promptly marched Edinburgh back 10 metres and
Welsh slotted home the penalty goal.
In terms of the national cause, Craig Chalmers made about as much use as
possible of the scrap ball which came his way but, more significantly, his
line-kicking was of an altogether different order to that which has given his
critics much ammunition in recent weeks.
Scott Welsh, with six penalty goals and a conversion, had another good
afternoon with the boot to such an extent that for long enough South hopes
rested on the Hawick man who has blossomed this season with an A cap after so
long on the fringes of representative honours.
Another son of Hawick, the Edinburgh coach Graham Hogg, while regretting the
lack of preparation that district sides are permitted and ruing the last-minute
changes in personnel which seem to be his lot, was happy enough with his side's
performance.
``We gave away too many penalties which, more or less, kept the South in the
game but, on the plus side, Scott Murray and Darren Burns showed once again
that they are the best two line-out jumpers in Scotland,'' he said.
Hogg, though, is looking beyond the immediate business of the district
championship. ``What we're trying to do is develop a style for when we are in
Europe next year,'' he said with a wicked smile as the clubs v districts debate
rages on the sidelines.
Fergus Henderson opened the Edinburgh account with a try after just three
minutes, Donaldson and Wyllie sending the winger on his way from ruck ball won
inside the South 22. Donaldson converted.
Welsh stroked over the first of his six penalty goals just a minute later and
Donaldson followed suit before Welsh put over a 40m effort after 15 minutes. It
was Welsh again with a penalty in 28 minutes, and again five minutes later that
gave South the lead.
Five minutes from the interval it was, yes, Welsh again, who stroked home the
penalty following Wright's comment to give South a five point interval lead
that they ill-deserved.
The second half was a much more entertaining affair. Darren Burns captured the
ball from a shortened lineout, Bruce Ward drove towards the South line, and
Graham Burns ran through the ruck before Darren Burns finished what he had
started with the try which Donaldson converted.
Donaldson and Welsh traded penalty goals before South took the lead with a Gary
Isaac try that was an early Christmas gift.
Armstrong had kicked astutely to the corner flag, Nick Penny opted for a quick
throw-in, Cameron Aitken guddled the ball and the loitering Isaac plunged over
from all of two metres. Welsh converted to put South five points ahead.
Donaldson cut the margin with a penalty goal and put Edinburgh into a one-point
lead with a drop-goal before Scott Hastings scored the try of the afternoon, a
short penalty move setting the backs moving and the centre giving and taking a
pass from Penny for the try.
To their credit, South stuck to their guns and, after David Grant and Gary
Armstrong had cut into the Edinburgh defence, Ian Elliot was on hand for the
touchdown.
Welsh, after a virtually flawless afternoon, had the chance to sneak a win with
the conversion but the ball sailed wide of the posts and Edinburgh had the
single-point victory which was some way short of what they deserved.

England 27, Western Samoa 9
ENGLAND were as grateful to Paul Grayson as they used to be to Rob Andrew and
Jonathan Callard as the newcomer's hot right boot laid the foundation of a 27-9
win over Western Samoa that left a ton of questions over the future.
Grayson, like his predecessors as chief goal-kicker, did his job to near
perfection as England pragmatically took the three points as the Samoans
conceded the ludicrously high number of 28 penalties.
``You need to accumulate penalties,'' said manager Jack Rowell. ``You need a
cushion to build confidence.''
Grayson landed his first five shots and had the slap in the face of being booed
by elements in the crowd when he stepped up for his sixth.
``I was personally pleased that I was putting points on the board while we were
waiting for tries. It's what I was chosen for,'' he said.
Unfortunately, the try burst which has become a familiar late part of England's
game when the kicker has created a lead was confined to just two strikes.
Lawrence Dallaglio, making his first full appearance, pounced from a scrum on
Western Samoa's line, a situation in which any team would back itself to score.
Three minutes later, Rory Underwood, from the other end of the experience scale
in his eighty-first test, did what he is best at - slicing the last few yards
through a vulnerable defence and wrong-footed tacklers.
There were 18 minutes left for England to turn it into a try glut, but that was
the end of the scoring.
That should not be acceptable to the selectors at this stage of the season, and
there must be intense sharpening-up in the month before the Five Nations'
starts with the most difficult examination of all - against France in Paris.
England's big problem, however, related to the first hour.
They always have trouble imposing themselves on sides whose styles are
unfamiliar and who concede penalties freely, as was shown against Italy and
Argentina.
Rowell said: ``We were trying to handle the ball when we were in the wrong
parts of the field. We need to understand the dynamics of the game and the need
for balance. We did not create the platform for attacks. The players were too
wound-up.''
However, when England did move the ball, the handling and passing were
frequently below Test class, with knock-ons and mistimed passes scattered
through that first 60 minutes.
There was qualified praise for the new half-backs: ``I am delighted with the
youngsters, although you don't snap your fingers and expect miracles.''
The Western Samoans trade in tries and were dejected that their scoring was
confined to three penalties from Darren Kellett. At least England's defence was
by definition perfect.

WELSH giants Ebbw Vale and Aberavon crashed out of the SWALEC Cup fourth round
on Saturday to Penarth and Caerphilly. Both top-flight teams were well beaten,
with the Vale going down 30-11 away and Aberavon being routed 27-0 at home.
Bridgend almost joined the shocks, hanging on to win 28-25 at Carmarthen Quins,
and Heineken League leaders Cardiff did not have it all their own way either as
they struggled to beat fifth division Oakdale 26-7.
But it was a different story at Cardigan, where Neath romped home 48-3, while
Abertillery trounced Hendy 46-0, and Pontypridd strolled home 102-5 at
Llanharan.
Meanwhile Newport hammered Tumble 62-0, Newbridge ran away 41-7 at
Garndiffaith, and Rumney dumped out Pontypool 22-12.

Connacht 16, Glasgow 22
EVEN with a team well short of full strength, Glasgow extended their winning
record in games against Connacht in Galway. Their victory at the Sportsground
on Saturday was their fourth in as many visits.
Yet Glasgow would not have had such success had they not bought valuable
insurance with 12 points in the first 18 minutes against the stiff, chilling
easterly wind.
Glasgow's lead was eroded to one point by half-time, and though they failed
adequately to exploit the wind after the interval, their win was sealed by a
George Breckenridge try after 56 minutes.
They then needed steely defence as Connacht's forwards mounted a series of
attacks spearheaded by Noel Mannion.
Quick thinking by Cameron Little gave Glasgow the lead after 14 minutes, the
scrum half taking a tapped penalty and sprinting over from 25 metres. Only four
minutes later Alan Bulloch, the 18-year-old West of Scotland centre on his
district debut, found space to overlap Breckenridge on the right, and another
of the Glasgow youngsters, Iain Sinclair, provided typical support for Fergus
Wallace to go over.
Calum MacGregor converted and added a penalty before Connacht struck back. Eric
Elwood, the international stand-off, playing an experimental role at inside
centre, kicked two penalties, and Neil Culliton added a try after an attempted
clearance by Little was blocked.
Connacht would have been ahead at the interval had not Elwood missed five
kicks, whereas MacGregor had a penalty early in the second half and the
conversion of Breckenridge's try. The full back broke away 40 metres out and
beat three opponents on the way to the line.
Thereafter, as Glasgow failed to harness the wind, the Irish raised their game.
But Glasgow's breakaway trio of Wallace, Sinclair, and David McVey were as
secure in defence as they had earlier been swift in support, and the visitors
conceded only once, when Mannion ploughed over.
CONNACHT - P Boland (Young Munster); M Devin (Buccaneers), M Murphy
(Galwegians), E Elwood (Lansdowne), M O'Reilly (Old Belvedere); A White
(Corinthians), K Lawless (Clontarf); J Maher (Buccaneers), K Tierney
(Galwegians), M Finlay (Wanderers), R McCarthy (Sundays Well), C O'Riordan
(Blackrock), N Culliton (Wanderers), N Mannion (Buccaneers), captain, R Rogers
(Blackrock). Replacements - N Carolan (Corinthians) for Devine, W Mulcahy

HILLHEAD Jordanhill leapfrogged opponents Stewartry into second place in
Division 1 on points differential after a 10-3 away win. The windy conditions
caused havoc with handling and kicking, and Campbell missed two easy penalties
before giving Stewartry the lead after 36 minutes. 'Hills replied with a
breakaway try from Stewart which he converted himself making it 7-3 at the
break.
Stewartry dominated the second period without scoring. Centre Mark Lee came
closest after 72 minutes when he was stopped just short of the line before the
visitors clinched the points with Stewart's last-minute penalty.
Glenrothes stay four-points clear at the top after having beaten Edinburgh
University 23-13. The home side found the fit young visitors hard to break down
and two Bailes penalties each side of Delorey's try gave the University an
early lead before Glenrothes drove their prop Meekin over to make it 10-6 after
30 minutes. Wilson then capped a fine, back-row move to make it 15-6 at the
break.
A Burnett try after the restart rallied the visitors, but almost immediately
Ferguson scored at the corner for Glenrothes after his forwards sucked in the
University defence. Had it not been for the heavy conditions the margin of
victory might have been greater.
Portobello moved into fourth place scoring five tries in their 32-3 demolition
of Dumfries, with Molotnikov (two) Smith (two) and Vaughnall on the mark.
At the other end Dunfermline scored a 20-15 away win at Trinity Academicals and
moved to within a point of third-bottom Dumfries. Royal High stay rooted to the
base after having conceded five tries at Duns, through Ainslie (two), Buckley
(two) and Nielsen in a 31-10 defeat.
East Kilbride stay clear at the top of Division 2 after a 15-8 win over
second-placed Aberdeen Grammar School FP. New Zealander Brett Davis kicked all
East Kilbride's points. Grammar's Ian Stanger notched the only try in 50
minutes, but three penalties in the space of eight minutes for East proved
decisive. Grammar played the better rugby but forward indiscipline saw them
concede eight kickable penalties in addition to the five East scored.
Hutchesons-Aloysians continue to progress and scored four tries through Bailey
(two) Bardelli, and Reid in their 34-5 win over Ardrossan Accies. Cambuslang
slipped to fourth after four penalties from stand-off Shiel gave lowly St
Bossells a welcome 12-7 victory.
Berwick retained the leadership of Division 3 after a crushing 40-5 win at
Cartha while in Division 4, Lismore took advantage of Clydebank's slip at
Madras to go top after a 35-25 win at Irvine.

THE feeling south of the Border last night was that England could have done a
great deal worse out of the European Championship draw than a section
containing Scotland and Switzerland, both of whom were being lumped together as
belonging among the less dangerous qualifiers.
Reaction was summed up by former internationalist Steve Coppell, whose 42 caps
included five jousts against the Scots and three goals in successive England
wins from 1978 to 1980. ``It's a very good draw for England,'' he said. ``I
think Switzerland, who we beat comfortably last month, are one of the weaker
teams, and so are Scotland.''
Coppell, now Crystal Palace's technical director, believes that England and
Holland will go through. Gary Lineker, now a BBC pundit, who made his
international debut at Hampden Park in 1984, agrees with him and also believes
that the match between them at Wembley on June 18 will determine who wins the
group.
Trevor Brooking, unbeaten in four games against Scotland, said: ``Scoring goals
is the Scots' problem. Craig Brown deserves credit for getting them through, by
keeping things tight and not conceding many goals. The difference at this level
now is the ability to score. From that point of view, it will be interesting to
monitor Duncan Ferguson's progress at Everton in the second half of the season.
``But it's great for the good of the tournament to have them drawn together. A
lot of us feel that we should have started playing the Scots regularly again,
because of the improvement in behaviour at grounds. If everything goes well,
perhaps the fixture can be re-established.''
For all the buoyant noises, England know they will need to beware of what might
be termed the ``Irish factor.'' In the 1988 European Championship and the 1990
World Cup, the Republic of Ireland's added motivation, allied to their
knowledge of England's players and style, enabled them to achieve a 1-0 win in
Stuttgart and and 1-1 draw in Cagliari against Bobby Robson's teams.
Scotland will possess the same advantages, and for that reason it would be
unwise to underestimate them as many seemed in danger of doing last night.
q THE golden boy of Scottish football last night closed his eyes and allowed
himself to dream of scoring a Wembley winner against England. If Ally McCoist's
track record for soccer fairy tales is anything to go by, the Rangers striker's
dream might just become reality on June 15 next year.
McCoist will be pushing 34 come Euro '96, but he has already been told by
manager Craig Brown that, if he is fully fit and scoring goals, he will be in
the squad for England.
``It is an incredible draw for Scotland and the prospect of playing England is
one which has gripped everyone,'' said McCoist. ``The fact that we are going in
against the Auld Enemy has given the tournament added spice.''
It was substitute McCoist's goal against Greece last August, in his first
international outing for two years, which helped clinch Scotland's place in the
Euro finals. ``I wouldn't mind scoring one against England at Wembley. That is
what dreams are made of.
``It is a game every Scots boy wants to play in and the fact that it is in a
championship match is another added incentive.''

CRICKET
THE third Test is dead - and cricket's latest ``ball-tampering'' allegation was
buried alongside it last night at Kingsmead.
While England and South Africa watched helplessly as rain once again made a
mockery of their efforts over the first two days, home bowlers Craig Matthews
and Shaun Pollock were cleared of attempting to cheat.
Match referee Clive Lloyd ruled there was no case to answer following
suggestions that both players might have tried to alter the condition of the
ball by illegal means on Friday afternoon.
``There is nothing for me to take action over,'' said Lloyd. ``It's a storm in
a teacup.''
Matthews, who grabbed three wickets in the space of six overs as England
slipped into trouble on Friday, was wakened by a journalist in the early hours
of yesterday morning after a newspaper report, based on television pictures,
had described him giving special attention to the seam of the ball.
Later, Matthews volunteered to show a news conference what he had been
doing.``I just worked my finger around the edge of the seam, where there were
scuff marks,'' he insisted, demonstrating with a ball. ``I do it every time at
the beginning of a spell.''
Had Matthews tried to raise the seam or gouge pieces of leather out of the ball
with his finger nail, that would have been illegal. But there was nothing
untoward about the action, he revealed.
``I think I have always been someone who has played the game hard but fair,''
said Matthews. ``The allegation of cheating upsets me very much and I don't
take it lightly.''
Fellow fast bowler Pollock was pictured apparently squeezing the ball between
the fingers of both hands.
``Shaun couldn't recall the incident when he was asked about it by Clive
Lloyd,'' said South African manager Alan Jordaan. ``The only thing he could
think of was that he was probably feeling the hardness of the ball.''
Lloyd interviewed both players after having studied video recordings. ``I don't
think they were trying to lift the seam or alter the shape of the ball,'' he
said.
``It is inspected regularly by the umpires (South African Dave Orchard and West
Indian Steve Bucknor) and they had no problem.''
Ball-tampering is just about the hottest issue in cricket these days - as
England captain Mike Atherton knows after the `dirt in the pocket' affair at
Lord's last year. Sri Lanka were reprimanded earlier this month after being
accused of cheating during their Test against Australia in Perth.
England made no complaint over the condition of the ball.
Meanwhile, opener Jason Gallian has pulled out of England's A tour of Pakistan
to replace hamstring injury victim John Crawley and is likely to play in the
fourth Test at Port Elizabeth, starting on Boxing Day.

FRANK Bruno weighed up Mike Tyson for eight minutes and 32 seconds at the
Philadelphia Spectrum on Saturday night, then stated confidently: ``I'm going
to knock him out.''
That was all the time Tyson needed to finish off Buster Mathis Jr. But in those
few minutes Bruno saw that Tyson is far from being the fighter he was.
And Bruno declared: ``I'm the top heavyweight in the world. At this moment, I'm
the best, the most powerful puncher and the best boxer. Tyson will get knocked
out.''
Big Frank revealed how he had predicted a victory against Tyson on March 16 to
President Bill Clinton when they met recently at Downing Street.
Britain's World Boxing Council champion told Clinton: ``Your boy is going to
get whipped. It's America v England and I don't want to embarrass England. I
told him: `Your boy's going to take a beating.'
``Tyson's big, everybody's ears prick up when you talk about him. But as I said
to Mr Clinton: `Tyson's going to look good on my CV.'' '
After Iron Mike's largely rusty and ragged showing against Mathis, Bruno might
feel the urge to telephone the White House to reaffirm his prediction.
Tyson, watched by his five-year-old daughter Miky, got the job done after two
minutes, 32 seconds of round three when Mathis was counted out in the act of
rising by referee Frank Cappuccino.
The finishing combination was more like the old Tyson, but otherwise he missed
badly far too often, perhaps a dozen times in the opening round.
The battering of the night air continued in round two and part of round three
as Mathis wisely kept his head out of the firing line.
Tyson simply tried to throw bombs, neglecting the jab, but Mathis rushed out
from the first bell and smothered his opponent, allowing no room for leverage.
It was not pretty to watch, but 25-year-old Mathis was determined not to be an
early fall guy at the second Tyson comeback party.
Clearly, Tyson has still much sharpening to do before facing Bruno in Las Vegas
in four months' time, although allowances have to be made for his time out of
boxing.
Bruno observed: ``Iron Mike is rusty. He is ready for the taking. I've never
seen him miss so much. He looked terrible here tonight. He didn't use the jab
much and when he did, he missed with it. Something isn't right, but I don't
give a monkey's. Come March 16, I'll keep my title and unify all the titles in
1996. That's my plan. Mathis tried very hard, but he's not as dedicated as me,
and I've got the power.
``If Tyson fights like that on March 16, he's going to get knocked out, but
he's going to get knocked out whatever way he comes out.''
Bruno claimed Tyson's time in prison had been more damaging than many observers
first thought. ``The guy has been away from boxing for four years,'' he said.
``That doesn't do anybody any good.
``I've visited prisons and no matter how long you stay there, even if it's for
two days, two weeks, three years, it does no-one any good.
``It's no fun, no joke when someone is locked up. There's no steak or Guinness,
it's only rice and peas.
``It's not a nice thing, you can't run, you can't get proper fresh air. It
can't be the same. prison takes a bit out of you.
``He's got people round him telling him: `Man you look great.' Someone should
tell the truth, and sometimes the truth hurts. Don't give me all that rubbish
about he's fit and hungry. He's ready to go.
``It's no disrespect to Mr Bruce Seldon (WBA champion), Mr Frans Botha (IBF
champion) or Mr Tyson, but I could beat all of them one after the other on the
same night. That's how confident I feel.
``It will be different when he's fighting somebody who will be throwing jabs,
right crosses and wants to win and wants to hold on to the title.''
Tyson, already lined-up to unify the titles against Seldon in June and Botha in
September, maybe in the Middle East, said: ``Mathis was awkward, his head
movement was very fast.
``I knew he was fast, but I didn't anticipate him to be that fast. It seems to
be an epidemic now for fighters to rush out at me. I normally put them to sleep
with the left, but I knocked him out with the right. When I fight for the title
I will not be denied.''

NOMINATIONS for a version of hell for the discerning Scottish sports book
reader surely would include a profile of Will Carling, and an account of
England's World Cup triumph of 1966.
But, to lapse into the sporting press speak, one is unexpectedly a turkey and
the other is a Christmas cracker.
Worst things first: David Norrie's Will Carling (Headline, #17.99) promises
little, and does not disappoint. The words authorised and illustrated
emblazoned on the cover ring alarm bells for the reader looking for
enlightenment, or at least some decent gossip. But this is a lazy book which
sheds little light on a complex character.
Complex? Carling, after all, is the man who makes a decent living advising
businesses on man management, yet who seems unable to control, as a unit, a
15-man team. The England skipper has written a book on decision making, yet is
guilty of standing powerless in the middle of crucial matches. When he does
take decisive action, it seems to end in inglorious failure. He is the man who
hates the press, but is in the public relations business.
He is a captain who professes the modern sports ethic on the importance of
winning, yet has failed to lead his side to victory in an alarming number of
crucial matches.
He is a man who preaches self-confidence, but betrays signs of insecurity.
Norrie skips blithely over these anomalies to give a cobbled-together account
of the man who rose from nowhere to lead England to three Gland Slams.
The book is strong on hyperbole, if nothing less. Carling's sacking in the
``old farts'' row is described as ``the biggest bombshell that has ever hit
British sport.''
The book is full of cliches you don't want to read and photographs you do not
want to look at. This may seem harsh, but it is born of disappointment. Carling
is a world-class centre with the top team in the Northern hemisphere. He has
been sacked, re-instated, played in and lost a World Cup final, and has had an
intriguing friendship with the Princess of Wales. Yet he remains a closed book.
Roger Hutchinson, however, has scaled the pathetic prejudice of this Scot to
give an enlightening account of the 1966 triumph in It is Now (Mainstream,
#14.99).
Hutchinson has taken an overworked subject, but has diligently sought to say
something fresh. He is particulary adroit when discussing personalities. The
self-imposed veil of mystery over Alf Ramsey is lifted more than a little.
Saint Bobby Moore is also revealed as an unsuitable candidate for canonisation.
His insight and research (with astute comments from Ramon Wilson) breathe life
into a tournament which threatened to sink in a quagmire of negative thinking
and brutal tackling, but which was redeemed by a Boys' Own final.
Hutchinson illuminates a story of triumph with nuggets of perception and
information. He is particularly strong on the tactical dilemmas facing Ramsey,
and how the England manager stumbled towards a winning formula.
Brazil's preparations are analysed and found wanting, the strange bias towards
Northern referees is scrutinised, and Nobby Stiles is tried and found guilty
for that terrible foul against France (Mr Stiles is fortunate he did not commit
the tackle before a Glaswegian procurator-fiscal - 30 years on he would still
be in Barlinnie).
The chapter on the Argentinian game is a delight and I am indebted to Lord
Lovat for pointing out that England ``was penalised no less than 33 times
against the 19 fouls perpetrated by the Argentinians.''
Just one quibble: the theory that England's victory changed football for ever
is flawed. Only four years later, Brazil proved themselves the greatest of
World Cup winners.
Interestingly, their toughest opponents were Ramsey's side who were sunk in the
quarter-finals by a combination of inept goalkeeping and ill-advised
substitutions.
Mr Hutchinson is funny, perceptive, and lucid. In short, he does not deserve to
be an England fan.

GIANT Londoner Henry Akinwande scored a significant victory on the Mike Tyson
bill in Philadelphia, clearly outpointing former IBF heavyweight champion Tony
Tucker.
The unbeaten Akinwande produced a commanding performance against the
36-year-old American, who was ranked No.3 by the World Boxing Council before
this fight, with Akinwande at five. Consequently, Akinwande will now move up a
couple of slots in the rankings and closer to a shot at a world title.
Akinwande was so much in control that one judge scored the bout 98-92, while
the other two officials had the margin closer at 97-93. It improved Akinwande's
unbeaten record to 27 wins, and one draw against recent world title contender,
Axel Schulz.
Importantly, it gave Akinwande a big name in his list of victories, Tucker
having taken Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis the distance in title combat.
Akinwande said: ``I never tried to knock him out because he had a lot of
experience and a reputation of being durable. I was too fast and too quick for
him, but he's still a good fighter.''
q JULIO Cesar Vasquez demonstrated the value of sheer persistence by finding
the big punch to beat Missouri's Carl Daniels to regain his WBA
light-middleweight title.
Vasquez was behind 97-92, 98-92, 98-92 on the cards and needed a knock out to
save him. And the Argentinian turned the fight on its head with a cracking left
hand rocket in the eleventh round.
q TERRY Norris added Paul Vegan's IBF title to his WBC light-middle crown with
a surprisingly easy points victory.

REMEMBER the time when going to a football match was an experience but not
necessarily a comfortable one?
You first went to the pub, then queued for ever to get into the ground,
clutching a carry-out to your chest as if your life depended on it. Then you
swayed in an uncovered section of the park while the rain lashed down, and if
you were lucky caught a couple of glimpses of action over the hubbub of the
crowd.
Then it was back to the pub to dissect the team's performance. And all this to
see Clyde v Partick Thistle.
Most fans have a story to recount about those days. They reminisce about the
versatility of a couple of cans of lager, remember pretending a woman companion
was pregnant to get further down the terracing, recall the torrent of criticism
thrown at Frank Haffey.
But those days are gone. Big crowds nowadays are 40,000 (or at some third
division and junior grounds a quorum). Not quite the 132,000 who crammed in to
watch Celtic take on Leeds United at Hampden in 1970.
Now comfort is the key and no more so than as a guest of the corporate
entertainers.
On Saturday 35,000 eager souls, including a mere sprinkling of away supporters,
made their way to Parkhead to watch the title hopefuls take on the lowly
Bairns, and I had a glimpse of how the other half live (in Paradise at least).
After years in the cheap seats it was time to join the high rollers in their
eyrie high in the main stand.
As the Matchday Information Folder for executive guests points out, the match
is only part of the ``total Celtic experience.'' Some might say that during the
past few seasons that was probably just as well.
So after having filed through reception it was time to head for the Walfrid
Restaurant for a champagne reception. Celtic champagne, of course.
A four-course lunch followed, washed down with Celtic Red and Celtic White.
Blue Lagoons and fresh orange were thin on the ground.
The talk was of the merits of new signing Morten Wieghorst, of how a victory
would put the team only one point behind their rivals across the city, and how
much anyone had seen of Paul McStay's testimonial match in the swirling fog on
Tuesday.
An air of optimism is sweeping through the Parkhead faithful. Some would have
Tommy Burns beatified. Others, of course, would have Gordon Marshall hung. But
for all their suits and ties, stylish overcoats, and champagne swilling, the
fat cats are no less fanatical than the Bhoys in the temporary West Stand.
And so with minutes to kick off it was time to troop out to seats behind the
directors' box. Celtic hero Bobby Lennox, a cap pulled firmly over his ears,
bore an uncanny resemblance to Victor Meldrew, while suspended Peter the
Brazilian watched from the stand as his team made heavy weather of it.
But the Celtic board were in festive mood. Ticket prices were cut for the last
home game before Christmas, and female Santas moved up and down the aisles
handing out bars of chocolate. Celtic chocolate. Mind you, many of the fans
seemed more interested in the Santas' anatomies than their bagfuls of goodies.
I suppose Santa doesn't usually show so much thigh.
Meanwhile, the dour contest continued on the park. The Flying Dutchmen added to
his impressive scoring record, but the bulk of abuse was saved for the Maurice
Johnston. He was booed when he touched the ball.
``I see your legs are only brown at the front now, Mo,'' one man shouted. ``I
suppose you can only afford two sunbed sessions a week at Falkirk.''
And then it was time for tea. For those being entertained there's no need to
leave 10 minutes before half-time to join the queues for Bovril and pies.
Instead, there are dinky miniature pies for the executives' delicate palates.
But no Bovril.
In the second half the referee, in a red shirt, came in for a fair amount of
stick. ``You're as bright as a blackout,'' one man roared, while another burst
into song with Chris de Burgh's Lady in Red. At least it made a change from
Who's the Mason/Fenian in the Black? That very much depends on what ground
you're at.
Then the game itself was, mercifully, over. The fans roared their approval of
another three points but the winning of them could hardly be described as
convincing.
But it is Christmas. Like all good parties nobody goes home without a gift. On
Saturday the executives were each given a silver case for names and addresses.
Perhaps Maurice Johnston should have been given one, too. It would help him to
remember all the clubs he either played for or said he supported.

FRED Couples, the genial 36-year-old American who has developed a second career
out of winning post-season tournaments, yesterday won the fifth and last
Johnnie Walker World Championship at Tryall, Jamaica, completing the circle
since he also won the first. Having finished the final round eagle, birdie to
tie with Loren Roberts and Vijay Singh he beat them in a play-off with a
12-foot birdie putt at the second extra hole.
In earning the first prize of #358,703, Couples raised his total from this
event alone to more than #1m. Despite back trouble, Couples this season has
also won this sponsor's Asian Classic, partnered Davis Love to win the World
Cup for a record fourth consecutive year, and $276,000 in the recent Skins Game.
On an afternoon of hot sunshine Roberts, aged 40, played the steadiest golf of
the only three genuine contenders. Although his 69 for 279, five under par, set
the target his failure to make anything of the long seventeenth proved
damaging. Singh made the birdie routine at the penultimate hole, 524-yards long
but within range of a short-iron second, to draw alongside Roberts with his 70
but Couples, the Fijian's partner, made the most dramatic intervention. Three
strokes adrift with two to play he rounded off his 71 by hitting both
approaches to 25 feet and holing for 3s.
On the eighteenth green, which the trio were playing for the third time within
half-an-hour, Roberts, like Couples a Ryder Cup player, missed from 15 feet and
after Couples, with the casual air typical of him, had holed from 12 feet,
Singh missed the chance to prolong the agony from about half that distance.
However, Colin Montgomerie's 1995 season, yet another in the unbroken upward
path his career has taken since he turned professional eight years ago, ended
on a sour note when he was fined #100 for using the F-word expletive in the
hearing of spectators in the second round of the tournament. More than the
amount of the fine, was its comment on Montgomerie's continuing inability to be
the master of his emotions in adversity.
It now remains to be seen whether Montgomerie's lastest indiscretion will cost
him the nomination as the European Tour's golfer of the year, an award made
under the auspices of the same sponsors. The winner's name is to be announced
tomorrow at a lunch in London.
At least Montgomerie brought to an end what he described as ``three hard
years'' with a flourish - 3, 3 - an eagle from 25 feet and a birdie at the last
where he holed a 40-yard wedge shot.
Behind him, Sam Torrance produced every figure from 2 to 7 inclusive in the
first six holes and in the end he equalled his compatriot's 77 and total of
296. Indeed, the mercurial scoring of Europe's first two on the merit table
suggested golf's equivalent of metal fatigue. The event was further diminished
by the unbecoming performance of the Open champion. John Daly so far tarnished
the image of the title he won at St Andrews in July as to fail to break 80 in
any of his four rounds and thereby set a new ``record'' for last place. Final
aggregates:
279 - F Couples (USA) 70, 67, 71, 71; L Roberts (USA) 70, 70, 70, 69; V Singh

A FURIOUS Alex Ferguson blasted his team's performance at Liverpool yesterday
as totally unacceptable.
A goal in each half from Robbie Fowler left Anfield in a state of delirium and
Manchester United seven points behind Premiership leaders Newcastle.
Ferguson said: ``I think, particularly in the first half, that that was the
most lifeless performance I've seen from us.
``I thought we'd ridden our luck and that we would get to half-time at 0-0. If
we had done that we might have got something. But then Liverpool had the only
bit of luck they'd had all half to score and that can't detract from what was a
really poor performance.''
Ferguson said keeper Peter Schmeichel had been unsighted for the opener after
45 minutes that put Liverpool on their way, but he added: ``We didn't show the
passion required for this game. When Manchester United play Liverpool you
expect it will be a fight, but we didn't fight at all in the first half.
``At least in the second we had a bit of possession and made a reasonable game
of it but we just didn't get near them.''
Ferguson added: ``For some of them, people like David Beckham, Gary Neville,
and David May it was a new experience to play in a game of this intensity, but
the rest of them are used to it. They've no excuses.''
Match-winner Fowler said the victory was all the more pleasant after the 2-2
draw between the clubs at Old Trafford in October, when a bitterly contested
penalty from Eric Cantona - on his return after an eight-month ban - had earned
United a fortunate draw.
``Old Trafford was all about Cantona, but today was all about Liverpool,'' said
Fowler.
``From the first whistle we controlled the game and got our just rewards with
the two goals. To get the first just before the break was ideal, although I
didn't actually see it go in. For the second, I just lifted it over
Schmeichel.''
Liverpool manager Roy Evans was as delighted as his players. ``We got a good
result against Bolton last week and we were looking to carry that confidence
forward against our oldest enemies,'' said Evans.
``It was nice for us to go and do exactly that and, with a bit of luck, we
could have won by a few more, although you've got to give Schmeichel credit
because he was fantastic.''
The keeper's brilliance came mainly at the expense of Stan Collymore, who was
denied time and time again. But Evans insisted: ``I was more pleased with Stan
than I have been in a lot of games. He is getting in on the end of some of our
good football and it wasn't just the occasional long ball. He was working it
out and getting on to our passing movements which is what I've been looking for.
``But Robbie showed he's got a phenomenal talent. He's had a little lean spell
recently and so to break it like that was great for him and his effort today
was worthy of getting two goals.''
Liverpool 2, Manchester United 0

NO doubt there is an old Wembley hand right now searching his attic for the
banner with the immortal words ``England 1, Scotland 2 - stole your turf and
the goalposts too.''
The year 1977 is etched on the Scottish memory when rampaging football fans
made amends for Bonnie Prince Charlie's Jacobite army being too feart to
advance any further than Derby.
Not to mention the small matter of those English bastards beating us 9-3 in
1961 and winning the World Cup in 1966. In those days it was important to beat
the English at Wembley.
After the 9-3 game, Denis Law kicked Bobby Robson's bum. Some Scottish fans
wished to do the same to goalkeeper Frank Haffey. To be fair, Ian St John says
Frank was probably to blame for only six of the nine goals.
In those days, Scottish fans saved for two years for the Wembley pilgrimage.
The ritual was well-established of the carry-out on the train south, the
occupation of Trafalgar on the Friday night, and the march up Wembley Way
before the game.
Bemused hoteliers and innkeepers played host to parties of extremely inebriated
Scots. We have tales of the befuddled Glaswegian wandering the streets of
London trying to find the pub where he has taken rooms. ``What's it called?''
helpful passers-by ask when he seeks help. ``I think it's called
Charrington's,'' he says not knowing that this information narrows down to only
a couple of thousand the premises he is seeking.
Then there is the story of Scottish fans sitting by the window of their hotel
who are asked by passing, homeless compatriots if they have a spare bed. No
problem, they reply and throw the bed down into the street.
Other Wembley vignettes. The London underground occupied by Scottish fans
singing such ditties as: I wish I was a kettle I'd be steaming every day. There
could be no mistaking the nationality of the chap walking along Bond Street
wearing his mother's tartan curtains as an uncertain kilt, a Scotland jersey,
and a sombrero souvenir from Spain's 1982 World Cup and treating his London
audience to a rendition of Spot, spot the looney.
But that was then and this is now. After the joyous excesses of Wembley 1977
and with the sinister emergence of violent and trouble-seeking English skinhead
fans, the football authorities wished to see the back of the England-Scotland
fixture. I was last there in May 1983 when the match was played on a Tuesday
and the FA's Ted Croker made it obvious Scots fans were not wanted at Wembley.
England won a dull match 2-0 and Scottish fans were left to wander
disconsolately through an unwelcoming city where it seemed every pub and
restaurant door was closed in our faces.
The England-Scotland match died a slow death. Scottish fans discovered life
after Wembley and emerged as the smiling, happy face of football, supporting in
places as far apart as Mexico, Cyprus, Spain, Sweden, and Estonia.
Scottish fans have won a reputation as the winners off the field. A whole
generation of Scots fans know nothing of Wembley and the need constantly to
chart our team's success in terms of games against the Auld Enemy.
Can we ever go back to the Wembley days? Do we want to go back to a time when
it was all about hating Jimmy Hill?
The European Championship draw provides, however, a great opportunity for
Scotland to consolidate our reputation as glorious losers. I forecast a
drubbing at the hands of Holland, a memorable victory over England at Wembley,
and an oh-so-unlucky exit when Switzerland score a last-minute goal at Villa
Park.
And talking of our games at Villa Park, what an exciting prospect to be playing
at Birmingham, glittering capital of the Black Country? Land of Crossroads and
incomprehensible accents.
Some Rangers fans should certainly know their way about Villa Park. I seem to
recall they did a spot of demolition at the ground in 1976 during a friendly
with Aston Villa. But that was then and this is now. 1996 could be the year the
Scottish fans win the hearts and minds of those nice English people.

MARTIN Heath, the world No.30, won a one-sided final against the top domestic
player, Barry Sutherland, playing his first Scottish championship yesterday at
Heriot Watt University, Riccarton.
Heath, who had been taken to five games by his older brother, David, in
Saturday's semi-finals, recovered from that fright to stage a 33-minute
exhibition and defeated Sutherland, the Scottish Grand Prix champion, from
Newlands, 9-2, 9-1, 9-5.
In all three games, the No.1 seed opened up sizeable early leads, and it was
only with some desperate diving in the final stages that Sutherland managed to
extend the match beyond the half-hour mark.
In the 37-minute women's final, Senga Macfie, the London-based world No.1, who
had suffered shock defeats in the past two finals, made it third time lucky
with a 9-2, 9-7, 9-4 scoreline against defending champion Claire Waddell.
Heath acknowledged the absence of world No.8 Peter Nicol, who had decided not
to pursue a fourth successive win, had eased his passage. ``I may not yet be
the best in Scotland, but you can only beat those that are here,'' he said.
He revealed that after a disastrous run in the Far East in the summer he had
come close to giving up the game.
``I'm still making a loss after three seasons as a professional, but at least
things have improved over the past few months, and I'll be going to America
next month to try and make further headway in the world rankings.'' Results:
Men: Final - M Heath (David Lloyd) beat B Sutherland (Newlands) 9-2, 9-1, 9-5.
Play-offs - 3/4, D Heath (David Lloyd) beat P O'Hara (Cumbernauld) 9-5, 9-4,
9-3; 5/6, G Sword (Aberdeen) beat B Christie (Bridge of Allan) 9-2, 9-5, 9-6;
7/8, M Ramsay (Edinburgh Sports Club) beat C Small (Dalgety Bay) 9-7, 9-4, 8-9,

CRICKET
NEW Zealand pulled off a thrilling, one-wicket win against Pakistan in their
one-day match in Christchurch.
Requiring 233 for victory, they clinched the winning runs with one ball and one
wicket to spare.
The Kiwis seemed to have the game under control at 204 for four, but lost five
wickets in 18 balls. They needed 10 off the last over, bowled by Wasim Akram,
and got a leg-bye off the first ball and two runs off the second, a full toss
which went past the batsman and wicketkeeper and was called a no-ball.
Gavin Larsen cracked a full toss to the extra cover fence for four, but failed
to score from the next two balls. He levelled the scores by hitting another
no-ball for two, and clinched the win with a four.
Pakistan's innings was based around a 114-run fourth-wicket stand between
Inzamam-ul-Haq and Salim Malik. The result squares the four-match series at one
game all.

THE new Wolverhampton Wanderers manager, Mark McGhee, seemed remarkably unfazed
by his team's 1-0 defeat at home to Port Vale on Saturday and their continuing
drop towards the bottom of the English first division. After the hero's welcome
he received from a 23,000 crowd it was all an anti-climax, but it did spell out
for McGhee and everyone else at Molineux the
problems the 38-year-old Scot has inherited.
This was the team put together by former England manager Graham Taylor at a
cost of around #8m, yet there was scarcely a spark of genuine talent.
However, McGhee says: ``I did not come here expecting to find a great side. It
was very clear the club had problems, and these problems are what I am being
asked to sort out.''
The former Aberdeen and Celtic striker arrived at Molineux towards the end of
last week after having been criticised for walking out on promotion chasing
Leicester City. Earlier, he had also left the manager's job at Reading in
acrimonious circumstances.
The criticisms don't worry McGhee. He had expected them. He knew he would be
pilloried in certain quarters and simply accepted that. Indeed, he says:
``Nothing that has been said has surprised me, nor has it upset me, because I
know in my own mind that I am perfectly justified in what I have done.
``I would defy anyone in any walk of life to turn their backs on a better job.
No-one does that in any other business. Why should a football manager be any
different?
``As for loyalty, that is only for club supporters nowadays. If you were to
examine the whole concept of club loyalty, you would understand what I mean.
``Because I played for Aberdeen was it necessary to be an Aberdeen supporter?
When I played for Celtic or Hamburg or Newcastle, did I have to support these
teams to do well for them? The answer is no.
``What I did do was give them 150% while I was there. That's what I have done
as a manager up to now and that's what I will do with Wolves.
``I am a professional and, I hope, a good professional, and that is what the
job is all about.
``In any case, managers' contracts are not lodged with the FA as are players'
contracts. The whole business has been misunderstood as far as I am
concerned.''
Those who criticised McGhee's decision to leave a club close to the top of the
table to take over another at the bottom, should have been at Molineux on
Saturday to understand the motivation behind the job change.
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was at the game, watching his son play
in Wolves midfield, and also giving support to McGhee, one of his managerial
proteges.
Said Ferguson: ``This is one of the really big clubs in England. If Mark gets
things right - and I believe he will - then Wolves will be bigger than Aston
Villa, bigger than Leeds United, bigger than Manchester City. They will be up
there among the top teams in England.''
That is, of course, where they once were in the glory days immediately
post-war, when they pioneered glamour games in Europe and provided a clutch of
international players to every England side. Now McGhee intends to bring these
days back.
He points out: ``The club have already spent #30m on the stadium, they have
another #4m ready to be spent on a new training ground, and there is cash to
spend on players.
``At Leicester I had no money to buy players and the set-up was nothing like
as
impressive as this one. That's why I had to take the opportunity when it came
along.
``Sure, there is a lot of work to be done, but it was the same when I went to
Leicester. I had to change a lot of things. I did that and I'll do it again
here.
``There is a rebuilding job to be done on the team and it will not be long
before I move into the transfer market.''
Certainly, McGhee cannot afford to suffer for the mistakes that have been made
at Molineux in the past. He will have to move players out and bring others in,
and he will be assisted in that by the money available to him from the
millionaire club chairman, Jonathan Hayward.
Only last week Hayward announced: ``This is not a bottomless pit as far as
money is concerned, but it is a very deep hole.''
That underlines again why the Wolves job is seen as such a plum among
English-based managers.
McGhee will not delay in making changes. He will bring in the kind of player
he
wants, and he will have Wolves playing the kind of football he believes in.
On Saturday it was clear that he had asked the players to attempt the patient,
passing game he likes. But most of them were not comfortable doing so. That
will change.
Says McGhee: ``When I buy a player I look for certain qualities, but anyone I
bring in will have to have 90% of what I want and then I can add the extra 10%
I believe necessary. The game has changed a lot since even I stopped playing
and that's only half a dozen years ago. Now players have to be fitter and
stronger. They have to be athletes.''
McGhee has worked wonders at the clubs he has been with previously. He left
behind a strong squad at Reading. He has done the same at Leicester. Now he
must do it all over again at Wolves.
He has had an astonishing rise in the five or six years he has been a manager.
Even he himself grins: ``I never thought for a moment that I would be in a job
as good as this one in so short a time. Believe me, this is a massive job.''
When he says that, McGhee is not talking about the huge salary - reputed to be
around #500,000 a year - or the promised bonus of the same amount if he takes
the team into the Premiership. He is talking about Wolves' ambitions, and
these
simply match his own.

PETER Henry, the 1990 Commonwealth Games swimmer, underlined his determination
to earn an international recall when he cruised to victory in the 100 metres
butterfly at yesterday's final session of the Scottish Winter Championships at
Ayr.
The 24-year-old from Dunoon, who dropped out of the sport during four years in
America, finished more then two seconds ahead of Aberdeen's Greg Henderson in
56.61sec. Scottish squad member Cameron Black was fifth in 59.67.
Alison Sheppard's domination of the women's scene continued, the Milngavie and
Bearsden swimmer scooping a record medal haul of five gold and one silver. A
week after having returned from a training stint in Canada, the 23-year-old
completed the programme yesterday by adding victory in the 100m freestyle to
previous successes in the 50m and 200m events, plus the 100m backstroke and
200m medley.
While Sheppard's form proved that a third Olympics is not beyond her, Richard
Hope, who hopes to make his debut in Atlanta next summer, confirmed his rising
talent with a golden double.
A member of this year's World Student Games team, Hope won the 200m backstroke
by a gaping seven seconds in 2-2.22, and edged home ahead of Craig Miller to
win the 400m freestyle by just 0.2 in 4-1.26.
Angela Pendrich, who has suffered a run of misfortune after having failed to
make the 1992 Olympics, returned after glandular fever to emulate Hope. She won
the 200m backstroke from Nicola Steel in 2-19.92, and edged England's Susan
Colling to take the 400m freestyle in 4-26.07.
At the Winter Challenge in Sheffield, Graeme Smith, who had set a Scottish
record at Cumbernauld last month, was 12 seconds faster than Hope in finishing
third in the 400m freestyle in 3-50.08.
Fraser Walker was another Scot to pick up a bronze medal, his time of 2-03.06
leaving him adrift of England's James Hickman and David Warren.

WHEN I was a little boy and went to football matches - surely only very little
boys keep going to football matches - I wanted to be one of three things. I
wanted to be a polis, a ballboy, or a sports photographer. You got to be that
close to the pitch, you see.
Saturday, there I was at Celtic Park, Celtic versus Falkirk, watching the
sports snappers. Today's gendarmes are required to watch the crowd and walk
around the perimeter of the grassy arena, ballboys are too busy catching balls
from incompetent footballers, and photogs sit in their little hardened cases,
(being somewhat hardened cases themselves), in the freezing bloody cold,
waiting for goals or incidents or whatever.
Indeed on Saturday, at Paradise there wasn't much incident. There was a goal in
the seventeenth minute, a header from some Dutch chap. Read Jim Traynor for the
facts.
Taking snaps of sport is not very easy actually. I went to the game with this
blatt's chief sports photographer, Jim Galloway. There are probably about three
photographers in Scotland who cover sport exclusively - Galloway, Craig Halkett
of THE RECORD, Steve Welsh, largely freelance, who works often for THE SUN.
Most of the others do sport as part of the daily round of snapping, moving from
feature to reportage to anything. They are all very quick at it, believe me.
But sport is a little bit different.
For a start the photographer in sport can't ever - ever - relax; not for a
minute. I sat beside some of the lads and they talk among themselves in a
desultory manner as if there was something more important in their minds and of
course there is. The picture.
Galloway: ``Talk to any sports photographer. You don't get any more than one
chance and you've got to be there. Look for the picture. Worry about it. And
above all, anticipate what's likely to happen. It's not like journalists. We
can't make things up.'' Ouch.
Three-quarters of an hour before the match in the bothy set aside for the
snappers. ``We're treated a bit differently by sports people than writers''
said Galloway, ``We don't get as involved, so we don't get as much flak. We're
not working with bandits, and our job is a bit distanced from any controversy.
we get out there and do it.''
This is before the match and the bonhomie among the artists is remarkable. They
all know each other. I used to think there was a kind of sartorial pretension
in the way the kit themselves out, photographers. Not a bit of it. The
expensive boots and Goretex jackets are necessary: it is bloody cold out there.
I asked Ian Torrance, long-time hero of the photie brigade, why none of them
seemed to need the lavvy during a match. ``It's like being a player. The
adrenalin stops the need. You get nervous all the time, waiting for something
to happen.'' I asked Ian after the game about that quote. ``Well sod all
happened, did it? Och, you get used to it.''
George Wilkie was there too, an old chum of mine who was once the picture
editor of The Herald, now of Photeonews Scotland. He is using sort of credit
cards he sticks into his camera and it transmits his pictures immediately to
the papers he's covering the game for. This is the sharp edge of new technology
and worries this writer considerably. I can't work a bank hole-in-the-wall.
Half-time and Sheila, the bubbly chatelaine who always seems to provide me with
sustenance at Paradise, is handing out the hot soup and pies for the snappers,
who are all red-nosed and sniffling by now. There is no talk at all of the
game, or the job. It is all allegations of parentage and stories about last
week's sports snappers' party and anything else but photography.
Then comes the bell and they're back out, hauling their enormous camera lenses.
The boys use 300, 400, 500 mil lenses, telefoto. The bigger lenses require
immediate digital dexterity, you have to focus in seconds.
Galloway tells me one thing is certain about sports photography. ``You're
always at the wrang end and have to learn to live with that.'' But he likes his
job. In 14 countries this year, did the World Cup and six weeks in South
Africa. Meets the people in his business every trip. Prefers Rugby really. You
get to see things in advance more.
And that's the point. The sports photographer needs more concentration than the
referees, the players even. He needs to see in advance. Three cameras at one
time and only one pair of eyes.
When you fans survey a sporting field you never look at the snappers. They get
to see everything and we all take it for granted. Not always. Ask Angie Catlin
of THE HERALD. She was at an Old Firm game when the fans started tossing the
odd can of urine about. She managed to dodge that and got hit with a fifty
pence coin. She even got a picture. A bit dazed it looked, I remember.

COACH Martin Shields was given his marching orders last night when Paisley
Pirates were beaten 7-3 by Dumfries Vikings. Later, Pirates' goaltender Dave
Rook was red-carded after the final whistle of a game where Paisley logged 74
``sin bin'' minutes against Dumfries' six.
Craig Lyons, Neil Smith, and Stephen Lynch scored doubles, in a victory which
wrapped up an impressive weekend win double for Vikings who defeated Solihull
Barons 12-4 on Saturday. Paisley beat Chelmsford Chieftains 18-3.
Murrayfield Royals pushed Telford Tigers but eventually went down 10-6. Results:

SCOTLAND'S players head for the Christmas and New Year festivities secure in
the knowledge that Kingussie are still the bench-mark behind which they all lag
in great measure.
The all-conquering Badenoch side inflicted one of the most comprehensive
defeats for some time on their near neighbours and traditional rivals
Newtonmore, cruising to the winter break with a seven-goal cushion.
The match was all over by half-time. By then Ally Borthwick had netted a hat
trick and Ronald Ross had added two more.
Ross went on to add two more, and that took his tally to an astonishing 42 in
12 matches this season.
Inveraray are the only team to have threatened the might of Badenoch by taking
a point from a league match at the Winterton. They indicated they may have
overcome a mid-season stumble by coming back from a goal down to defeat Glasgow
Mid Argyll. Their two goals came from Garry MacPherson, the under-21 national
captain, and they now lie comfortably in third spot.
Fort William maintained their second place with a two-goal victory over
struggling Glenurquhart.
At the half-way stage of the inaugural premier league, the two Oban sides find
themselves adrift of the rest, with Camanachd, last year's Camanachd Cup
finalists, having won only once in seven league outings.
The North first division race continues to twist and turn. League leaders
Caberfeidh came a cropper, going down to foot of the table Kinlochshiel. Skye
closed the gap at the top, earning a point at home to Lovat.
No such difficulties for Kyles in the South as they head for the play-offs
still unbeaten. Their latest conquests were Strachur, by 4-0.
In a remarkable Sutherland Cup tie at Fort William, Lovat and Lochaber needed
extra time to settle their second, round-second replay. Harry MacDonald got the
all-important winner for Lochaber in the 101st minute.

ROBBIE Regan packed all his frustrations into a mighty left hook and was
rewarded with the world flyweight title he craved in Cardiff on Saturday.
The 27-year-old Welshman feared the worst in a row over the status of his fight
against Tunisian Ferid Ben Jeddou in Cardiff.
Supervisor Bobby Lee junior insisted at the rules meeting that it would be a
final eliminator and not for the interim IBF title as billed. But promoter
Frank Warren, in Philadelphia with Frank Bruno to watch Mike Tyson, convinced
IBF president Bobby Lee senior otherwise.
And Regan responded by knocking out Italian-based Ben Jeddou in the second
round with the sweetest punch of his career.
Regan, who staggered his man with the same punch in the opening round, said:
``I wasn't aware there was a problem with the fight until early in the
afternoon. And I didn't know the reason until a call from my wife. It was
worrying because that would have taken the shine off.''
Regan, who must now meet Danny Romero, if the American recovers from a serious
eye injury which forced him to put aside the title, dedicated the victory to
his father-in-law, who died recenty.
Manager Dai Gardiner said: ``I tried to keep the problem over the fight from
him. I said we had sorted things out, when we hadn't. I always knew Robbie was
a special fighter, but he hasn't shown his true power until now.
``Ben Jeddou caught him with a right hook in the first 40 seconds which woke
him up a bit. Then, his concentration was right there. His timing and accuracy
were superb. The only weakness is he's too gutsy at times.''
Chris Pyatt, who lost the WBO middleweight title to Steve Collins 18 months
ago, kept his career alive by regaining the Commonwealth light-middleweight
belt.
The 32-year-old took some solid right hand punches from Australian holder Kevin
Kelly, but referee Dave Parris preferred Pyatt's aggression to the way Kelly
fought on the retreat and gave him a 118-116.5 points decision.

CANCEL the holidays, send word to the Royal Family to ``stay indoors,'' and get
the regulation kit - fusty Scotland top, circa 1970s, scraggy kilt, and
sandshoes - looked out. We're all going to Wembley.
The English grew weary of Scots commandeering Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar
Square and the fixture between the Auld Enemy, which started at Partick in
1872, was done away with in 1989, when England played at Hampden for the last
time.
Football's authorities on both sides of the Border felt the annual challenge
brought out the dark side of the tartan-clad hordes - all right, apathy within
the ranks of the troops who realised a wider world had to be conquered also
helped kill the game - and so one of world football's most exciting and
romanticised fixtures was wiped from the schedule.
However, we always felt in our hearts that one day we would return to London.
We had to, because the game was stopped when the English were winning 43-40 (24
matches were drawn). The game couldn't be left like that.
Yesterday UEFA, even if they were hoping desperately that Scotland and England
would be kept apart, drew Us and Them in the same European Championship finals
group. Holland and Switzerland are also in Group A, but forget them for the
time being. Yesterday was all about the resurrection of an international
fixture like no other. It's time to scale the twin towers again.
England manager Terry Venables has been under pressure this past year or so
because of allegations concerning his business life, but the London lad's
troubles haven't even started. The Scots are coming and Tel better have more
than Christmas tree formations and nice, dainty players like Barmby and Le Saux
to offer.
Although Scots long ago realised there was more to this game than beating up
England occasionally, Venables should be aware Scotland would still take a
perverse delight in preventing them from winning the championship.
The English won the 1996 World Cup, playing all of their matches at Wembley,
and as hosts they will play all of their European matches at the same venue,
but in '66 Scotland weren't around to trip them up. The Scots had to wait until
the following year to become unofficial world champs, when we won 3-2 in a
Wembley match which lives on in the memory.
It isn't only the good ones which remain vivid, however, and every foot soldier
who has trudged up and down Wembley Way carries his own unwanted baggage. There
are some horrific stories of Scotland's battles with the Sassenach, scary tales
which should not be told to the young and certainly should not be recounted
without a bottle of something strong within reach.
How we have suffered for our loyalty through the decades. We have wept rivers
on the long trudges home from Wembley, and for that matter Hampden, where
England thrashed a team of ours containing Donnachie, Bremner, Lorimer,
Dalglish, Morgan, and Macari 5-0 in 1973. The match was played on the evening
of February 14. It was the St Valentine's night massacre.
That was bad enough, but absolutely unbearable even now, 34 years and eight
months on is the Wembley scoreline: England 9, Scotland 3.
Celtic keeper Frank Haffey won his second and last cap that dreadful day in the
middle of April, 1961, and entered Scottish football's Hall of Infamy.
It was a national disgrace, but resilience and an ability to laugh in the face
of humiliation earns a man stripes in the Tartan Army. Besides, there is
usually something good to be found in the bottom of a carry-out bag and even
the heaviest defeats could be compromised.
It was necessary sometimes to let the English run riot, as in 1955, when they
won 7-2, just to lull them into a false sense of security and then bushwhack
them with a vengeance a couple of years or so down the line.
For that reason the English were allowed to gub us 5-1 in 1975, when Stewart
Kennedy was worthy of an oscar for his wonderfully animated portrayal of the
gormless Scottish keeper. He swung on the crossbar as Beattie, Bell, Johnson,
and Francis (twice) smacked the ball into the net.
The Scottish ruse was given even more realism with the sight of grown men
crying into their hands and swearing all manner of retribution against the
goalie.
There was a particularly painful 3-1 defeat in '79, because the road to Wembley
that year was long and winding. There was a transport strike the day of the
match and the trek homeward in the rain was especially arduous with the pubs
around Wembley closed and shuttered.
Perhaps it was as the fans formed a raggedy line trudging through the puddles
like Third World refugees that it began to dawn on many of them that the
Wembley weekend was losing its appeal. The fixture staggered on for another
decade, but Scotland won only two of the last 10 matches, although the 1-0
triumph at Wembley in '81 was one of the good ones.
John Robertson scored with a penalty and, as he placed the ball on the spot,
his Nottingham Forest team-mate, Trevor Francis, whispered in the ear of
England's keeper Joe Corrigan. Someone in the press box asked what Francis
might be saying and, in typically droll fashion, Hugh McIlvanney, a Scot who
has suffered more than most because of his exile in the pages of papers south
of Border, said: ``I think he's telling his keeper we're 1-0 down.''
That win was memorable, because it was Scotland's last Wembley triumph, but for
panache the Wembley Wizards of 1928 skelped England 5-1, and in 1949 Scotland
won 3-1 in what became known as the Jimmy Cowan international. He was the
keeper and he defied the enemy with a series of marvellous saves for 20 minutes
after the kick-off, allowing the Scots to settle.
They returned home on the Royal Scot and it was estimated that 10,000 fans were
waiting at the train station when they arrived back. Martin, incidentally,
missed Morton's relegation game against Albion Rovers to play for Scotland that
day.
The Scots won 2-1 at Wembley in '63, even though Eric Caldow broke a leg after
only five minutes and the manager, Ian McColl, put Davy Wilson to left back,
and the rest, as they say, is history.
Wembley had a new aluminium and glass roof in place which increased the volume
to the extent that Jimmy Greaves said afterwards: ``I knew they had rebuilt
Wembley, but I didn't know they had shifted it to Glasgow.''
Gordon Banks made his debut that day and watched Baxter score both Scotland's
goals. As the Rangers player stuffed the ball up his jersey at the end of the
match he was unaware he was starting a trend of Scots taking things away from
Wembley.
In later years the fans would carry off crossbars - two friends of mine, who
must remain nameless in case they intend returning to Wembley next summer and
wouldn't want to end up in the Tower, took home the helmets of two London
bobbies - nets and huge lumps of turf to be transplanted in back gardens
throughout Scotland. The take-away in '77 after Scotland had won 2-1 - Gordon
McQueen and Dalglish scored - was especially large.
However, the stuff of legend was pieced together on April 15, 1967, when
Scotland played England, who were world champions. Ronnie Simpson made his
debut in goal at the age of 36, Law scored and so also did Lennox and
McCalliog. Baxter played keepy uppy and a nation went bananas.
We probably never recovered from the euphoria of that wonderful day and we have
been waiting ever since to experience another adrenalin surge like the one the
players gave us then.
June 15, 1996, is the date we look to now. Could it be one of those special
Wembley outings? Thousands of us will make the journey south hoping with all
our hearts it will be. Thank you UEFA, thank you.

<HEADLINE>Scotland draw the Auld Enemy in European championship Security fears as Scots head to Wembley</HEADLINE>

THE draw that was not supposed to happen took place yesterday, pitching
Scotland and England against each other in the finals of the European Football
Championships and prompting immediate security fears.
Insiders had been claiming for months that the two nations would be kept apart,
given that hooliganism had forced the abandonment of football's oldest
international in 1989, but both sides will meet at Wembley on June 15.
Last night, officials from both the FA, and the SFA, were in talks with UEFA
and the organising committee regarding security and the allocation of tickets
for the game.
Euro '96 tournament director Glen Kirton insisted the match would present no
special security problems and welcomed the Scots ``with open arms''. He added:
``This is a major sporting event with every match presenting a prospective
security challenge but Scotland no more so than any other.
``Football really has come home with the first international fixture repeating
itself. It was time England started playing Scotland again anyway.''
However, there are fears about the potential for trouble, particularly in light
of the behaviour of some English ``fans'' abroad in recent years. Flashpoints
have included the disruption of the England-Ireland game in Dublin early this
year, believed to have involved a small core of neo-Nazi supporters.
Mr Malcolm George, assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester Police and
responsible for co-ordinating policing of Euro '96, said policing would be
carried out unobtrusively.
``Our tried and tested system of targeting the hooligan element will minimise
any type of risk these persons present.''
The last match at Wembley between the two countries was in 1988. It was
attended by a number of arrests and a public furore over security. A year later
at Hampden, the last time the two nations met on the football field, there was
more trouble from English National Front hooligans and 120 arrests in Glasgow.
Until now, the football associations of both countries have avoided resuming
the fixture in case of further trouble.
The England manager Terry Venables said he had tried to have the game revived
on a number of occasions but it had not been allowed. ``Now it has come out of
the hat,'' he added. ``Both sides of supporters will delighted, they've missed
the fixture for years, all we can hope is that things go nice and smoothly.''
Scotland coach Craig Brown, commenting on the superb record of Scotland fans
abroad in recent years, said he could ``virtually guarantee'' there would be no
hooliganism from Scots fans at the game.
``Terry approached me several times about the game but although I raised it
with the international committee, it was not something they wanted. Quite
honestly, I think it will go off all right,'' he said.
``Our supporters have been tremendous over the years. Look at how they were in
Sweden, for example. They were magnificent and UEFA recognised that. Everyone
will want to see it and that is the real worry because there will not be enough
tickets for our supporters.''
Ticket provision for the match will present a major headache for the Scottish
Football Association. Initially, only 7000 tickets were available for the
Wembley game which now has a capacity of 76,000 and most of those would be
allocated to the SFA travel club members.
Indeed, the association's chief executive, Mr Jim Farry, said last night: ``The
tickets are already sold. We have more than 5000 members of the travel club and
we have always said they will be looked after first and they will be.''
However, Mr Farry later emerged from a UEFA meeting in Birmingham with good
news for the Tartan Army.
There had been a favourable response to the Scots' plea for more tickets.
There is a chance that the allocation of 7000 may be doubled for the match at
Wembley against England.
The bad news is that the lowest price is #25, going up to #45.
Said Mr Farry: ``We will be receiving an extra allocation - not in the tens of
thousands - but somewhere between the 7000 we have and 15,000. It will not
fulfill all the requirements, of course, and we realise that.
``But there are more available now than we had anticipated.''
Mr Farry and the SFA must convince the members of the Tartan Army who do not
get tickets not to travel.
The Netherlands and Switzerland have also been drawn in Scotland's group and
may also carry large supports with them.
A problem does exist at Villa Park where Scotland meet the Netherlands and
would like the Holte End stand for their fans.
Mr Farry explained: ``The Dutch, who are bringing an absolute avalanche of
support, would also like that stand and eventually we may have to toss a coin
to see who gets it.''

<HEADLINE>I was corrupt, wicked, and evil, admits Hindley</HEADLINE>

MYRA Hindley has confessed that she was ``corrupt, wicked, and evil'' when she
committed the Moors murders 30 years ago.
She says, in a letter written to the Guardian from Durham jail, that in some
respects, she was ``more culpable'' than her lover and co-murderer, Ian Brady.
Hindley, 53, also says: ``I wasn't mad, so I must have been bad, became bad by
a slow process of corruption.''
She admits: ``I never attempted to justify my actions either to myself or Ian
Brady. I was the more culpable of the two.''
She reasons: ``If we had not met, there would have been no murders, no crime at
all. I would probably have got married, had children, and now be a
grandmother.''
She adds: ``I take full responsibility for the part I played and I will not
attempt to justify the unjustifiable.''
The extraordinary hand-written letter runs to 12 pages and more than 5000 words.
Hindley was jailed for life in 1966 with Brady for killing Lesley Ann Downey,
10, and Edward Evans, 17.
Brady was also convicted of murdering John Kilbride, 12. They later admitted
killing Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12.
Hindley was told 12 months ago that she must stay in prison for the rest of her
life, though her lawyers are seeking to have that decision overturned.
She explains that she wrote the letter as a follow-up to another letter she
penned to the Guardian in October when she objected to being labelled a
psychopath.
Winnie Johnson, the mother of victim Keith Bennett, said in response to the
letter: ``She's ruined my life and she's ruined five more families.''

LES Milne claimed a club record as premier division strugglers Fife Flyers came
from behind to beat Slough Jets.
The talented youngster, recently re-signed from British champions Sheffield,
scored five goals, the most by a British player in a single game, as the
Kirkcaldy club turned a 4-1 first-period deficit into a 10-6 success.
In Division 1, new signing Luc Chabot netted four as Dumfries Vikings kept up
their promotion push with a 12-4 win over Solihull Barons.
Lithuanian sharpshooter Dainius Bauba grabbed four goals as Paisley Pirates
enjoyed an 18-3 thumping of Chelmsford Chieftains.
Murrayfield Royals twice held the lead in a see-saw basement battle, but three
unanswered goals late-on allowed Peterborough Pirates to plunder an 8-6 win.
Results:
Saturday - Premier Division: Cardiff 10, Milton Keynes 5; Durham 6, Sheffield
6; Slough 6, Fife 10. Division One: Dumfries 12, Solihull 4; Guildford 8,
Billingham 2; Murrayfield 6, Peterborough 8; Paisley 18, Chelmsford 3; Telford
5, Bracknell 5.

I'M sure somebody has been spiking the drinks this Christmas. Here is Alexander
Dumas's 19th melodrama, adapted by award-winning screenwriter Charles Wood with
a raft of the
atrical experts aboard led by Howard Davies (late of the RSC and director of
the excellent Secret Rapture film based on David Hare's play) and bearing the
imprimatur, no less, of Cameron Mackintosh and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
But soft, mon dieu, what do we have 'ere? Not so much a Christmas spectacular,
as, 'ow do you say, un grand turkey. Oui, mes enfants, this eez a conocoction
of frankly rum franglais purporting to be a swashbuckling romance that can't
decide whether it's Carry On Up The Tower - or a small-scale version of Les Mis
crossed with the RSC at its most leather-bondage laddish, flanked by clanking
iron grills and accompanied by Jonathan Dove's swelling filmic score.
So, is this pseuds' corner we see before us? Well, if pas exactement, it's hard
by, with even the estimable Sinead Cusack and Adrian Dunbar caught in this
expensive rubbish. Cusack in auburn wig and fetching leather bodice plays, with
fiendish relish, Queen Marguerite of France, the woman who can't get enough of
it - young men that is - and when she's had it, rejoices in having their lithe
bodies dumped in the Seine.
And Dunbar? Well, he's her old lover and servant, an avenging angel from her
past who made her pregnant and set her on this life of debauchery. Together
they get their comeuppance in a typically sin-drenched/redemptive Dumas sort of
way implying how love can lead us astray. You have been warned! The Tower runs,
amazingly, to Feb 3.
