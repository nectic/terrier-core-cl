STEEPED in blood, brimming with action, seething with lust, bursting
with beautiful women in low-cut bodices, and teeming with dashing
gallants, Patrice Chereau's La Reine Margot (18) takes one back to the
days when Bette Davis and Errol Flynn used to storm the screen in
costume dramas. She would be indescribably wicked in a farthingale or a
bustle, he would be gloriously debonair in tights or uniform. Maybe the
film is bad history, but it is glorious melodrama.
The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve in 1572 is one of the great and
dreadful events in French history. The country was split between
Catholics and Protestants, civil war had been raging, and to patch a
peace together a marriage was arranged between the Protestant Henry of
Navarre (Daniel Auteuil) and Marguerite de Valois (Isabelle Adjani),
sister of the weak and dissolute Catholic King Charles XI (Jean-Hughes
Anglade). Behind the machinations was his mother, the formidable
Catherine de Medici (Virna Lisi), scheming to ensure the permanence of
the House of Guise.
The wedding celebrated, Henry having renounced his religion, Catherine
decided to get rid of his Protestant supporters, and the massacre of the
Huguenots, who had come to Paris for the wedding, took place.
Chereau's spectacular film -- the lush photography is by Philippe
Rousselot who shot Interview with the Vampire -- is based on a novel by
Alexandre Dumas. It is about a fictional love affair between Margot and
a young Protestant nobleman, La Mole (Vincent Perez), who has come to
Paris for the wedding. The bride spurns her husband on their wedding
night, takes to the streets, and meets La Mole. It is lust and then love
at first sight.
But her future is uncertain. Her mother is plotting to replace the
king with one of his brothers, and her husband's life is in danger. As
well as the doomed romance with La Mole, the film also charts the
growing realisation by Marguerite that her fate is bound up with that of
her husband, and that they stand or fall together. Trust slowly grows as
these two royals, united for reasons of political expediency, realise
they have a common purpose -- survival.
Bad history? For a start the couple were in their late teens, a period
both Adjani and Auteuil have left long since. But they give true star
performances. That is to say he presents a convincing countryman
struggling to survive and at sea in a society he hates, while she does
what female stars worthy of the name do -- looks gorgeous and sexy and
wears her clothes with style. In addition the clothes are a good century
and a half out of date, chosen for their look rather than their period
accuracy. The film's best performance comes from Virna Lisi barnstorming
through a role Bette Davis would have killed for as a black-widow spider
whose machinations eventually go terribly wrong.
The film is richly cast -- Jean-Hughes Anglade's Charles XI is a
marvellous creation and gets to perform a truly amazing screen death
scene -- and while the plots and counterplots, the poisonings and
assassinations, and all those incestuous Guise relationships can be
confusing, La Reine Margot is one of those rare films to sit back and
wallow in. Ask not the reasons why, just enjoy.
This is French week with a vengeance. Luc Besson's Leon (18) is proof
that it is not just Quentin Tarantino who can make dazzling, empty, and
thoroughly entertaining films stuffed with violence. In this tale of a
hired killer he has resurrected a character who appeared briefly in one
of his previous hits, Nikita, about a female assassin, namely Victor the
Cleaner. Tarantino pinched him for the Harvey Keitel role in Pulp
Fiction. This time, called Leon, played as before by Jean Reno, an actor
with a wonderfully lugubrious manner, he is a hired assassin, a
dedicated loner, working in New York.
One day he meets Mathilda (Nathalie Portman), the little girl next
door, notices she has a bruise on her face, and sympathises with her.
Mathilda, a nymphette version of Nikita, is the daughter of a gross drug
dealer, who is murdered by his associates along with the rest of her
family while she is out getting some groceries. When she returns she
realises something is wrong and rings Leon's doorbell. He takes her in
and a strange friendship develops.
Portman, tough, funny, vulnerable, and old for her years, makes a
splendid foil for Reno's oddly beguiling assassin who charts his own
destruction as he helps her get revenge. Gary Oldman, as a pill-popping
killer with an affection for Beethoven and Armani suits, gives a truly
terrible furniture-chewing performance about which the less said the
better.
The new Star Trek film, Generations (PG), unites Captain Kirk, a
patently past-his-sell-by-date William Shatner, with his successor as
captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), in a very
complicated plot which is not really worth the bother of unravelling.
Why is it that nobody ever wears a seat-belt on the Enterprise because
the crew is always being hurtled to the floor or tossed up in the air by
violent jolts from alien weaponry or passing asteroids?
The film opens with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov going on a maiden voyage
by a newly commissioned Enterprise. It gets into trouble with a strange
belt of energy called a Nexus, and Kirk is killed saving the ship -- or
so it seems. He has been sucked into space through a hole in the hull.
On to Picard's Enterprise 78 years later: a mad scientist (Malcolm
McDowell) is putting a world at risk by trying to get into the Nexus, a
kind of Paradise Lost where people live the life they always dreamt of
living, having been plucked from it by Kirk all those years ago. Why
Picard and Kirk, who has, of course, ended up in the Nexus, can leave it
at will, but nobody can get into it without blowing up a harmless
planet, is anybody's guess, but in this sort of tosh it hardly matters.
The new Enterprise crew lack the truly awful bad-actor qualities which
so distinguished Kirk's crew, but Trekkies and fans of Shatner's famous
rugs, which is not the same thing, should be well pleased.
Jason Scott Lee, last seen baring his magnificent chest as an Easter
Island prince, repeats his performance as Mowgli, the lost boy brought
up in the Indian jungle by wolves, in the latest Disney action
adventure, Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (PG). Kipling must be
whirling in his grave at the liberties taken with his tale of the Raj,
but, provided your child cannot read, the film should do well enough as
a holiday treat.
Gary Sinyor's Solitaire for Two (15) deals with the bizarre love
affair between a behavioural psychologist (Mark Frankel) and Katie
(Amanda Pays), a paleontology lecturer at the Natural History Museum.
From the director of Leon the Pig Farmer, it is one of those
battle-of-the-sexes tales in which Rock Hudson and Doris Day used to
cavort, and passes the time agreeably.

THE conversion of an old school might provide an ideal home for
dolphin watchers. Just five minutes' walk from the harbour at Portessie,
near Buckie, and the picturesque old seatown, the former primary school
has been gutted internally to provide four individually designed houses.
It is a handsomely proportioned building with views from the back over
the Moray Firth. The 100-plus strong dolphin colony which makes its home
there is often sighted offshore.
Viewed from the side which looks onto the water, all four houses are
surprisingly different from each other. However, they all share the same
high specification. Features include hardwood doors and stair
bannisters, double glazing, built-in kitchens and appliances and gas
central heating, all as standard.
Each house has three bedrooms and bathroom upstairs, with spacious
lounge, kitchen and utility room downstairs. Each has its own back and
front doors, with communal green and parking spaces at the front and
private patio at the rear.
The selling agents are Antons, East Church Street, Buckie, telephone
01542 832148, and offers over #59,500 are invited.
Dolphin sightings come free.

INTEREST rates up means share prices down. Or maybe interest rates up
means share prices up. It all depends, you see, on whether or not the
interest rate rise is ''a good thing''.
If you can bring yourself to believe that higher interest rates are a
clever and necessary strike against future inflationary dangers, and
that while they slow the economy down a bit they actually make it more
likely that economic growth can continue, you can argue that this time
the increase is the last one in the cycle and you can settle down to
enjoy a spell of peaceful progress. Or maybe not.
What does seem certain at the moment is that the share market is still
going through one of those long phases where it tries to make up its
mind whether it is going up or down.
While we all scratch our heads about this, should we be thinking at
all about commodities? We cannot live without them; the companies we
invest in use them or produce them, and some people seem to make a nice
living by putting money into them.
Speculating in them would be the term most outside observers would
employ because, unless you are an actual user (or even if you are), the
investing is likely to be in some form of future contract. And, of
course, commodities appear prone to sharp fluctuations in prices due to
such unpredictable things as frosts in Brazil (where there is an awful
lot of coffee which does not like frosts), a strike in the Chile copper
mines or, as we saw this week, a switch of funds into some other
speculation such as bonds.
On top of that we have all heard of people making spectacular losses
as well as gains in commodities.
Unless you are pretty expert, commodities are a dangerous game to
play. But, unlikely as it may have seemed a few years ago, there are now
three investment trusts specialising in the area and willing to do all
the clever thinking for you, although only one invests in commodities as
such. The others invest in producers shares.
Broker Smith New Court has been taking a look at them and points out
to investors that, while they may appear similar and are all aiming for
capital growth, they ''have very different strategies and, therefore,
offer different attractions''.
Largest of the three is Mercury World Mining. Launched at the highly
favourable time of December 1993, it attracted more than #400m and for a
while stood at a premium. But after commodity trusts and a lot of
commodity shares fell out of favour this year it is now trading at a
discount. It aims for long-term performance by investing in the shares
of mining and metal companies.
Analyst Charles Cade says it has ''a coherent long-term strategy to
maintain performance even if metal prices are weak, by shifting emphasis
to the large diversified mining stocks.''
Investment decisions are taken on the basis of long-run price
expectations rather than short-term changes in the commodities. It holds
shares in around 100 companies. Because of its size these are largely
the big ones, but it does have a portfolio of smaller ones ''to add
spice''.
Mr Cade feels the Mercury trust ''may be attractive to someone who is
bullish about the near-term prospects for metal prices, though its price
is more closely linked to general equities than metal prices''.
Writing at a time when the share price was 87p (peak 125p), he says
that on current rating it ''may prove cheap''. But he sees the warrant
as dear at 23p. Final date for exercise of the warrant -- at 100p -- is
April 30, 1988.
The philosophy behind Fleming Natural Resources is different. It has
''an extremely short life'' of some two-and-a-half to five years because
it aims to wind up at the peak of the commodity price cycle. Its
intention is to exploit the cycle and invest in shares of base metal,
precious metal and energy companies.
Its focus is on small ''upstream'' companies where the share price is
more closely linked to the underlying commodity than is the case in the
shares of larger diversified companies such as RTZ. There is a
performance-related fee of 10% of capital gains in excess of an annual
growth rate of 10%.
Mr Cade says it is likely to be a higher risk play than the Mercury
trust as, if commodity prices fall, sentiment could turn against it
because rising prices are the key to its investment strategy. Writing
with the share price at 89p (against a peak of 94p), he says: ''It may
be attractive for investors who are bullish about the short-run
prospects for commodity prices.''
The warrant, however, which stood at 12p (17p peak), and has an
exercise price of 125p, looked dear in his opinion.
Different again is the BZW Commodities Trust. This invests directly in
commodities, metals, energy and the soft commodities, through
derivatives which give a direct exposure to price movements. Broadly, it
seeks to invest on a one-year view but shorter term factors do have an
influence.
With the shares at 87.5p and the warrants (final date February 28,
2004 at 100p) standing at 35p, Mr Cade says that with a package discount
of 6.9%, ''The trust looks cheap as a long-run investment on the basis
of risk diversification.'' The warrant in particular seems cheap.
Aside from its exposure to commodities, the trust is also an
investment in dollars as it is quoted in Sterling but virtually all
commodity prices are in dollars.
Between them these three specialist trusts raised approximately #533m.
Such is the lure of commodities.
Looking at the rationale, Mr Cade says that over the long-term
commodity industries have underperformed share prices generally. But he
suggests the sector is ''inefficient'' and the industries ''understake
the potential returns from a well run portfolio''.
He continues: ''The quality of management is likely to be a more
crucial factor than in general equity funds.'' That, of course, is what
investment trusts should be all about.

THERE is nothing quite like variety of tactic and a touch of the
unorthodox for lending spice to Rugby Union action as the Five Nations
internationals demonstrated last Saturday whilst showing contrasting
methods of achieving similar objectives.
Perhaps the most audacious ploy, and one that might be exploited more
as carrying a strong surprise element, was that by the Irish captain,
Michael Bradley.
Instead of calling for a penalty kick at goal, he suddenly punted
diagonally across field. His target was a try for Simon Geoghegan, wide
on the right touchline.
Bradley's placement, however, was a bit short of the bull's eye,
although he did gain a close range scrummage. Only once in recent times
has one seen this move attempted and successfully. Rowen Shepherd, sharp
as a tack, punted across field on to a sixpence for Edinburgh
Academicals against Stirling County at Bridgehaugh in November. The
result was a try for wing Simon Burns.
The Irish introduced surprise again for their two contrasting tries.
For the first, there was a double diversion of a peel round the lineout
tail by Patrick Johns that checked Scotland's tailgunner, Iain Morrison,
then a dummy midfield intrusion by the right wing Jonathan Bell that
affected Scotland's drift so that both Scottish centres were cut out by
the miss pass to the scorer Brendan Mullin.
It is the kind of move the Scots might add to their repertoire. Gregor
Townsend has the kind of acceleratory pace with which to supply a
similar coup-de-grace.
The Irish also called on variety of offence kick ploy for the second
try by Bell. Against England, they had made regular use of their front
row players, notably hooker Keith Wood, as spearhead drivers of quickly
taken tap kicks.
Against Scotland, however, whilst hinting at repeating the pattern,
Wood instead acted merely as a decoy link for a move sweeping wide and
with their full back entering at a rare old lick to give Bell a head
start on Craig Joiner.
Ireland also made unusual use of the dynamic Wood at pressure lineouts
to which Ken Milne threw in. Wood's place in the five metres area was
taken by the scrum half whilst the hooker positioned as a scrum half
adjacent to the 15 metres line. This seemed to aim at using Wood to
check any Scottish assault round the tail or in wide cover.
Scotland's most productive move is that involving a scrummage pick-up
and feed to their scrum half drifting out on a widish, narrow side with
Gavin Hastings intruding at pace. It worked like a charm with Craig
Chalmers an additional link.
The French once at Twickenham used the pick-up to probe the left side
before switching rapidly for wondrous ball transference to the right
that had English temperatures on the rise. None can shift ball quite
like the French.
Scotland might consider using Damian Cronin as a peel player round the
tail.
Cronin, in his present mood of abrasiveness and desire, could make an
impressive spearhead.
One of these days, that loop move by Gregor Townsend will produce the
goods. From the inside centre position, he erupts behind the pivot
feeder, Ian Jardine.
Twice the linkage has been satisfactorily achieved, but the feed from
Townsend has not reached the target.
The captain himself, amid all the deserved satisfaction from a notable
leadership display, and another points-scoring milestone, had mixed
fortunes with two kicks ahead.
The one that led to the Joiner try always was going to cause a flap in
Irish ranks as a model punt on the run.
There are signs notably from Morrison, Cronin, and Ken Milne that the
Scottish forwards are reaching out for more fruitful use of keeping ball
alive just before, or out of contact points.
England provide the role model here, not only with the intuitive
support work at pace and in numbers that facilitate such continuity, but
by mixing that with rumbling mauls involving switches of direction, and
which occasionally force opponents to concede offence kicks because the
only way to halt the rumble is illegally to go in from the side, or to
take it to the deck.
There is more than one way of seeking maximum effect from personnel
and method, and with the Scottish captain still in good nick, Cronin an
elder statesman displaying qualities of inspiration, Rob Wainwright an
all-action dynamo, and the wings looking for work, confidence is on the
mend, and the birds seem to be singing again.

FOOTSTOOLS are enjoying something of a revival; they are versatile and
elegant pieces of furniture.
You can either buy them ready covered, or they can be covered in a
fabric of your own to fit in with an existing colour scheme.
Opt for a small stool, a larger one that can double as a small table,
or one which is hinged to give additional storage space. Whatever your
choice, they are extremely useful in any room.
Clock House Furniture of Overhailes, near Haddington, specialise in
making all kinds of stools including small footstools, dressing table
stools, fireside stools -- in fact, they will make them in any size the
customer wants and with a choice of leg style.
The company is run by Nicholas and Priscilla Parry.
Priscilla said: ''We started from scratch five years ago. My husband
was made redundant from a job in London, and we decided to try something
completely different.
''He had always been interested in making things, and we started by
making small footstools covered with Turkish kilims.
''The idea just took off, and we now have 13 people working for us.
''We specialise in making stools and have built a wide range, from the
smallest footstool to the largest upholstered 'coffee table.'
''The stool is such a simple piece of furniture but it has so many
applications. We are continually developing new designs and finding a
steady demand for our products.''
Clock House's stools are built with solid timber frames and
hand-polished mahogany legs, finished with antique brass studs around
the corner of the legs.
They offer a wide range of fabrics for covering, or they will use the
customer's own material.

A TAXI driving couple who were refused jobs with a mini-cab firm have
been awarded a total of #3000 compensation for racial discrimination by
a Glasgow industrial tribunal.
Mrs Sandra Butt and her Asian husband Nadeem claimed they were turned
down for the jobs with A Cars, of 957 Aikenhead Road, Glasgow, because
Mr Butt was a Pakistani. She claimed she was was told they ''didn't take
darkies''.
The tribunal said it was a ''blatant and insulting incident of
discrimination'' and awarded each of them #1500.
The taxi business denied racial discrimination, claiming the reason
the couple were not taken on was because they already had a radio fitted
in their car and were working for another company at the time.
The tribunal heard that Mr Butt phoned A Cars to see if any radios
were available, giving his first name, and was told there was a waiting
list.
Soon afterwards Mrs Butt, who is white, phoned and was told there were
vacancies.
She saw office manager Mr Richard Clifford and was told she and her
husband could start that night. But when they went out to the car to fit
the new radio, she gave him their documents, including their badges with
photographs, and claimed his attitude changed.
They went back to the office and Mr James McNulty, joint proprietor,
said they ''didn't take darkies''.
In its findings the tribunal accepted Mr McNulty had referred to Mr
Butt as a darkie and did not accept the reason the couple were refused
was that they still had another firm's radio fitted to their car.
Although Mrs Butt is white, she was discriminated against on racial
grounds because of her husband.

OUR chances of living a long and healthy life are increasing all the
time as medical science advances. So too is our desire to give up the
rat race as soon possible and ease into a comfortable retirement.
If we manage to achieve both our retirement life could be almost as
long as our working one, but how much we enjoy that time depends
crucially on the financial arrangements we make beforehand.
The trouble at the moment is that, however carefully we may have
planned for retirement, our financial security after work can be rocked
by circumstances beyond our control.
That is because, when we give up full-time employment, millions of us
are forced into making a decision that sets the financial scene for the
rest of our lives. And it is a decision we cannot change in future
years, however much our personal circumstances or the world around us
changes.
Members of some ''money purchase'' company pension schemes, those
boosting their retirement benefits through additional voluntary
contributions (AVCs), and people with personal pensions are all at risk.
The reason is that the law says the bulk of pension savings
accumulated through these routes must be turned into a flow of income by
buying an annuity, whatever the financial climate at the time you want
to start taking your retirement benefits.
Annuity rates fluctuate in line with long-term yields on gilts. If you
are forced to buy an annuity when rates are low, that is the income you
will be stuck with for evermore. You can't switch to a better one once
yields improve.
Falls of around 25% in annuity rates in recent years have led to
demands for less restrictive arrangements -- demands that may soon be
met by so-called ''flexible annuities''.
''The name is really a mis-nomer because we're not talking about
annuities at all, but a way of withdrawing income from your accumulated
pension savings,'' explains John Moret of Provident Life.
The company, along with another insurer Equitable Life, tried to
introduce a form of flexible annuity last year, but was stopped in its
tracks by the Government which had plans of its own, now being thrashed
out as part of the Finance Bill.
This has to become law by May 5. Once it is, Provident Life, Equitable
Life and other insurers will move quickly to introduce new, more
flexible schemes. By the early summer pension investors should have the
choice of deferring the purchase of a conventional annuity until they
are 75.
In the meantime, they will be able to take an income (and cash lump
sum) from their accumulated pension savings, leaving the rest of the
fund to grow tax free.
The amount of income available initially from pension savings will be
subject to maximum and minimum limits set by the Government. The
pensions industry had feared people would be forced to take at least 70%
of the maximum amount as income.
That would have prevented investors from using the scheme as a
tax-free, roll-up fund, but would have left little in the kitty for
further investment growth.
After discussions with the pensions industry, it looks as though the
Government has relented and that the minimum income will be set at the
lower level of 50%, leaving more of the fund to grow for the future.
''A more flexible system had to come -- it doesn't make sense these
days to lock into a structure that you cannot change,'' says Alan Steel,
a Linlithgow-based independent financial adviser.
''But I have several concerns about the new, more flexible
arrangements. People must realise that they will continue to be exposed
to financial markets -- and in falling markets that's going to be a
problem.
''The level of charges made by insurers and advisers will be crucial.
So too is the quality of ongoing help and advice that will be needed to
make the most of this new flexibility. Advisers cannot just sell a plan
like this and walk away.''
An alternative to the new-style income plans that has been around for
some time is phased retirement. Here you transfer your accumulated
pension fund into a pension plan made up of segments. You can then
convert as many segments as you like to provide immediate income,
leaving the rest invested for the future.
To take advantage of this type of arrangement you normally need to
have built up a pension fund of at least #100,000, many believe that a
similar amount will be needed if the new more flexible income
arrangements are to be cost effective.
Those with less than this in pension savings, or those who don't want
to face future investment uncertainties, will still opt for a
conventional annuity.
And it will be vital to take professional advice on how to proceed.
Choosing the wrong company can knock 25% off the level of income your
pension fund can buy, while paying for costly extras eats into your
income too.
One in eight people die within the first five years of retirement and
their annuity payments die with them. To guarantee payment for five
years, whether you survive or not, you may have to give up 2% of the
income you could have achieved through an annuity. Guaranteeing payments
for 10 years could cost 6% of your income.
You may have to give up nearly 50% of your annuity income if you want
payments to continue to your spouse after your death. Other extras, such
as ensuring that your annuity payments increase by a certain amount each
year, also cost money and need to be assessed very carefully.

RAINDROPS keep falling on your head -- the big problem is you are
inside the house at the time.
Winter storms can rip off a few tiles at any time, and the first you
may know of it is a drip or damp patch.
Often the only thing to do in a major emergency is to call your
insurance company and send out an SOS to the roofing professionals.
But sometimes you may spot the odd slack slate or missing tile, and if
you have a head for heights this is one job you should be able to tackle
easily.
It can take only a few minutes, but will save you a lot of time,
trouble, and money.
For example, replacing a slipped slate is a fairly speedy job.
The slate has probably come out of position because the nails on the
back edge have corroded. Use a slater's ripper to remove the slate,
locate the nails, then pull down to extract or cut them.
You will not be able to get access to the area under the slates to
nail the slate back in place or put a replacement slate in place.
Instead, use a plastic clip or a one-inch wide strip of lead or zinc
cut an inch longer than the slate.
Nail the strip to the roof batten, slide the slate into position, and
turn the strip up to hold the slate in place.
Replacing a tile can be tricky. Often the broken or cracked piece is
still held in place by the retaining nibs on the back edges.
You may find it easier to lift the tiles on either side using wooden
wedges.
Sometimes you may have to cut the tile or slate to make it fit. Small
numbers can be cut using a tough blade fitted in a hacksaw.
To trim a slate, mark a line using a sharp point and chop it a piece
at a time using a tool with an edge -- such as a trowel.

THREE prominent businessmen, including footballers' agent Bill
McMurdo, have set up a company which has produced a unique plan to
invest in Scotland's young players.
The company, appropriately called Young Lions plc, will publish its
prospectus within the next four weeks, but the general idea, if the
public share issue is a success, will be to offer immediate cash, mainly
to clubs outwith the premier division, in return for a percentage of any
future transfer fee the chosen player attracts.
The revolutionary ''Spot-a-Star'' proposition has already been
discussed with some clubs, and all have been excited by the prospect.
McMurdo, who will have the unenviable task of selecting the embryo
stars, is in partnership with two financial consultants -- Neil Beattie
and John Coyne, who run Liongold Securities plc, an Aberdeen-based
financial firm which concentrates mainly on venture capital projects.
Coyne, a former City Editor of The Guardian, and Fifer Beattie, came
up with the idea, but needed someone closely connected with the game and
its players to provide the expertise upon which the venture would
depend. Enter Scotland's most controversial agent, McMurdo.
The response from the Scottish League, whose management committee was
shown the plan, was to say that it could not endorse the proposal, but
there seems no obvious bar to the investment firm's intentions. The SFA
and Scottish Professional Players Association have also been advised of
the proposition which hopes to raise a seven-figure sum in the shares
issue.
Said McMurdo: ''It is something I discussed six years ago with
Falkirk's George Fulston, who was Hamilton chairman at the time, and he
was enthusiastic. He still is. The money we would give to the clubs
would help cash flow, would give them time to let the player or players
develop properly, and would be risk-free.
''If, for instance, the lad we picked failed to make the grade, the
club would have still received cash support and would owe us nothing. If
he turns out to be a #400,000 player, they would still get the large
majority of his transfer fee.'' The percentage for Young Lions would
depend on each negotiation, but McMurdo said that the club would always
have the majority stake in the transfer fee.
Beattie, who is a Dunfermline fan as well as a keen lover of the game
in general, believes the investment would help the Scottish game overall
by encouraging the development of younger players.
''We are asking investors to come in and have a stake in Scottish
football's future,'' went on McMurdo. ''I am sure that the idea of
taking part in this business will appeal to many people in the game. But
I am equally sure it will make money.
''The cash we give clubs will help them at the time they need it, and
they know they do not need to pay it back. My guess is that we would
invest anything up to #50,000 in a really good prospect.''
It is probable that, initially, Young Lions plc will concentrate on
the lower leagues and spread its finances over divisions one, two and
three . . .''I have already got about 20 players in mind,'' said McMurdo
. . . but there is also the possibility that premier clubs below the
highest level could benefit from this kind of investment.
At first glance, the proposals look like a City version of fantasy
football, only for real, but the idea of Player Trusts as opposed to
Unit Trusts might appeal to people who like the notion of charting
prospective stars' careers.
The minimum investment is likely to be somewhere between #100 and
#500, but running costs of the company are already in place. Lawyer
Sandy Moffat, a former Falkirk director, is company secretary for the
new firm.

THERE has been little good news so far this year for holders of
with-profits policies. Insurance companies have been announcing cuts in
bonuses on their with-profits policies with payouts down by as much as
10%. And this year it is not only shorter term policies that are being
cut back, but longer term ones too.
Insurers blame the bonus reductions on poor investment returns in
1994. The All-Share index fell last year, while Government securities,
as measured by the FTA 5-16 years gilts index, went down by 15.3%, but
companies claim they are letting investors down gently.
They also point out that in spite of the cuts in final payouts,
holders of ongoing policies will still see their values increase,
because in most cases it is terminal bonuses paid on maturity which are
being cut not annual ones.
Jim Stretton, chief executive UK operations at Standard Life, points
out: ''Reductions in terminal bonus rates are sometimes thought to
represent reductions in accrued benefits. This is far from the truth.
The accrued benefits under our with-profits policies have increased with
the addition of bonuses at rates significantly higher than most banks or
building societies' deposit rates.''
Even the lower payouts this year should be put in perspective, the
insurers argue. ''Our with-profits policies continue to provide
excellent value for money. The net returns to our policy holders, after
both tax and expenses, are 10.5% per annum over 10 years and 13.2% per
annum over 25 years, compared with average annual inflation over the
same periods of 4.4% and 7.6% respectively,'' he adds.
Mike Wadsworth, insurance expert at actuary R Watson and Son, points
out that over the past two years insurers have been rethinking their
whole approach to their method of calculating with-profits policy
payouts.
''Whereas previously there was often a degree of cross subsidy between
different types of business, insurers are now moving to a position where
payouts reflect more closely the actual return on the underlying
investments.
''In order to preserve the special nature of with-profits policies,
there is still an element of smoothing -- averaging returns over, say, a
three to five year period -- so payouts don't follow the investment
markets precisely up and down as a unit-linked policy would. Generally
this is regarded as a fairer approach for all policy holders.''
Mr Wadsworth believes most companies have now got their annual bonuses
at around the right level and sees future cuts in these rates as
probably unnecessary. But he does foresee continuing cuts in terminal
bonuses in coming years as these bonuses were largely fuelled by capital
appreciation from equities, which depended partly on the high levels of
inflation during the eighties and earlier.
This message has been reinforced by Norwich Union general manager
Richard Harvey. ''Actual investment returns will continue to be lower
throughout the nineties than the eighties,'' he commented when
announcing the company's lower annual and terminal bonuses.
So far only Royal Life has announced a small increase in payouts on
its longer term policies.
Lower terminal bonuses will have a bigger impact for some companies'
policy holders than for others. On average, according to the last Money
Management survey of with-profits endowments, terminal bonuses represent
53% of the pay-out on 25-year policies, but at Commercial Union the
figure was only 29%, while for Co-operative Insurance policy holders
over 65% of their final payout was as a terminal bonus.
So what are the implications for policy holders? Those who have
with-profits pension policies have no reason to worry because the real
returns are still looking good, and the stability which this type of
policy offers when you are approaching retirement is certainly an
advantage.
For those policy holders who expected their policies to produce
specific capital sums, there may be some disappointment. Standard Life
and Norwich Union have already warned their customers with back-to-back
policies maturing this year that they face shortfalls on their original
investment.
Most mortgage endowments are still likely to meet their targets. When
they were set up premiums were calculated on the basis that providing
annual bonuses did not fall below 80% of their starting level, there
would be sufficient to repay the loan. Policies which could fail to come
up to scratch are those sold at the end of the eighties when bonus rates
were at their peak. Since then premiums on new policies have increased.
If you are concerned about your policy, contact your insurance company
and ask whether you are still on target to repay your mortgage. However,
many companies have now introduced review schemes and are likely to
contact you first if there is a danger of a shortfall.

THE Scottish Rugby Union is likely to announce plans early next week
for a major crackdown on the ''pirate'' hospitality market surrounding
Murrayfield internationals.
The Union is also understood to be looking seriously at steps that
could be taken to undermine the black market in individual tickets sold
on at a profit by rugby club members and debenture holders.
As revealed in The Herald, Carnegie Sports International, the Scottish
Rugby Union's Murrayfield debenture advisers, carried out an undercover
operation to identify ''pirate'' hospitality operators during the game
against Ireland last weekend.
Carnegie marketing director Malcolm Brown said that the operation had
been ''extremely successful,'' and that their report, which names the
hospitality operators and the companies which entertained clients at
''pirate'' operations was handed to the SRU for discussion at its main
committee meeting yesterday.
He was unable to divulge what steps the SRU was now likely to take,
but The Herald understands that one option being seriously considered is
to invoke the embarrassment factor by making public the identities of
firms and organisations which have been purchasing hospitality packages
on the black market.
The Union, which runs the only official hospitality operation at
Murrayfield, is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds as a result of
blackmarket hospitality operations. It has always said that it retains
the right to evict from the stadium any individual who gains access
through a black market ticket.
A precedent has already been set for invoking the embarrassment
factor. At major events such as the Bell's Scottish Open golf tournament
at Gleneagles, and the Wimbledon tennis championships, official
hospitality operators have picketed unofficial operations, handing out
letters to guests explaining that they were attended ''pirate''
functions.
Carnegie have also taken possession of a number of black market
tickets apparently sold on at a profit by individual supporters. Under
Murrayfield's computerised system each ticket can be traced to its rugby
club, school, or debenture holder source.
In the past, individuals who sold tickets have received warning
letters from the SRU, and the sanction still remains that the culprits'
clubs could have their allocation withdrawn.
Malcolm Brown said yesterday that it was the intention to ''up the
stakes again'' for Scotland's next home Five Nations' game, against
Wales on March 4.
The SRU's determination to stamp out the unofficial hospitality market
has angered operators such as the Gloucester-based Mike Burton Group.
Burton, a former England and British Lions prop forward, has said that
the Union is acting in contravention of European freedom of trade
legislation. He has warned the SRU that if it interferes with his
customers, then he will take immediate court action.

Children's furniture can be an investment, as MARY BENNIE discovered
CHOOSING children's furniture is fun: there are many different makes
and styles available, and whatever your budget you should be able to
find something attractive and practical.
Furniture that grows with the child, or doubles up as toy storage, is
obviously a wise investment, and there are several options.
For the top of the range, Linda Reid Plus of Giffnock is the place to
go for beautiful plain or hand-painted furniture in oak and pine by John
Minter of Kent.
Look for the pretty single fourposter bed (#1076) and davenport desk,
#590 (main picture Page One).
For children who would prefer a plainer look, there is a captain's
bed, wardrobe, toy chest, bedside cupboard and chest of drawers, made
from limed oak.
The Cranbrook Collection in solid pine comes in different finishes,
including natural, burgundy, navy blue or racing green, and includes a
captain's bed or single bed, wardrobe, small and large chests of drawers
and toy chest.
Another option from John Minter is a sleigh bed that conceals a second
bed behind the side panel -- handy for when friends stay overnight.
The price is #1200, which might sound expensive, but it includes the
guest bed and two mattresses.
For a small additional charge, all John Minter's furniture can be
given any finish the customer wants.
You can also find furniture by Simon Horn at Linda Reid Plus,
including a cot based on the traditional Lit Bateau design, which
transforms into a child's bed and also into a small sofa. The price for
this three-in-one piece of furniture is #1295.
Artefacts of Cheshire was founded by Gail Elgin, who, when her own
children were small, saw a gap in the market for attractive,
well-designed furniture that would appeal to children and adults.
Gail, who had studied fine art, began to make tables and chairs,
chests and shelves that were fun and safe.
''The designs are deliberately bold and contemporary, and will fit in
anywhere,'' she says.
''The wall-hanging bookcase could store toys in the bathroom, or
children's books in the hall.
The toybox, colourwashed and decorated in subtle designs, could be
used to store toys in the sitting room where it could double as a coffee
table for adults.''
Gail was soon being given commissions by her friends, and decided to
start her own small business. Artefacts furniture is available by mail
order.
Another company that supplies children's furniture by mail order is
Letterbox of Cornwall.
They stock traditional pine chairs and stools, and a pine rocking
chair, decorated with either a cherry or boat design.
John Lewis's selection of children's furniture includes rocking chairs
with palm seats and beech frames, suitable for children from six months
to five years (#19.75) wicker armchairs (#17.75) and a cane settee which
can be used to store toys (#39.00).
Their red plastic table and small matching chairs cost #14 and #7.95
each.
John Lewis also stock a cot and first bed by Silver Cross. Handmade in
solid pine, the cot base has three different heights, and the ends can
be taken off to form a sturdy bed suitable for a child of up to six.

SWEDEN captain Jonas Thern is said to be keen to move from AC Roma to
Rangers.. ''I've heard a lot of good things about the club and it would
suit me fine to finish my professional career in Scotland,'' he is
quoted as saying by a Swedish news agency.
Thern, who is frustrated at not making the starting line-up at Roma,
continued: ''The situation in Rome is untenable. I want to play, but if
I'm not going to be selected I might as well change clubs.''
Thern's agent, Vincenzo Morabito, said he would travel to Glasgow next
week for talks.
''Jonas doesn't want to wait until the summer but wants a new club as
soon as possible,'' Morabito said, adding that Roma had put a price tag
of #2.5m on the midfielder.
Meanwhile, it is not beyond Aberdeen to complete a traumatic week by
beating Rangers in Roy Aitken's maiden game as manager at Pittodrie
tomorrow afternoon. Indeed, Sod's Law might well insist on it.
Even the Ibrox manager, Walter Smith, alluded to the vagaries of these
situations when he said, ruefully, that teams often play well the week
after a manager has been sacked.
However, whatever the result, the demanding northern fans will be
anxious to see a determination and willingness from the players which,
at least, will indicate that they are capable of lifting the side from
the depths of the premier division in Aitken's trial period between now
and the end of the season.
Rangers will insist that the game, one of 12 live TV games scheduled
over the next four months by Scottish Television, means a lot to them,
but there is no question that its importance to Aberdeen is greater.
Aitken could have had no better morale boost than the decision by
Duncan Shearer to sign a new contract which will keep him at Pittodrie
for another two-and-a-half years. But Aitken has been delighted by the
way the players have responded since he has been left in charge
following Willie Miller's sacking.
''I have tried to get everyone on the same wavelength,'' he said.
''This is an important game, but it is just one game. Regardless of the
outcome, and we will be doing everything possible to win it, there still
will be a lot to play for.''
Eoin Jess, Ray McKinnon, and Peter Hetherston are all fit, but an
unnamed player is doubtful.
Rangers have no such worries. Smith yesterday named the same squad as
has been in action in the past couple of games, but the chances are that
Alex Cleland will be on the bench, at least. ''Our aim is to keep
winning and prevent any doubts creeping in,'' said Smith.
Smith is happy that the injured players of earlier in the season are
coming back, with the notable exception of Ally McCoist, and the showing
of Trevor Steven in midweek was especially encouraging. The midfield man
has a way to go yet, but signs of the old skills were there to see.
Tomorrow's clash is the first of a dozen live matches announced by
Scottish Television yesterday. The list includes the Coca-Cola Cup final
in England, one of the semi-finals, two Champions' League
quarter-finals, the Champions' League semi-finals, and the Champions'
Cup final.

THE decision to rest Scotland captain Gavin Hastings for Watsonians'
crucial McEwan's 70/- national league encounter with Heriot's FP was
taken on medical advice, according to the Myreside club's co-coach,
Andrew Ker.
Watsonians are stung by any suggestion that the decision to leave
Hastings out of the side to meet Heriot's today indicates that they have
given up on the title chase.
Stirling County remain favourities to win the championship race, but
Boroughmuir, Watsonians and Heriot's still have an important role to
play in deciding whether the trophy will reside next season at
Bridgehaugh. Boroughmuir and Watsonians, in particular, still have an
arithmetical chance to wrest the cup from Stirling's grasp.
Stirling have a postponed game in hand over the Meggetland and
Myreside clubs, but the chasing duo are only a tantalising couple of
points behind the league leaders.
Yesterday Ker, who coaches Watsonians along with Peter Gallagher,
declared: ''Gavin has a bad back, so with Paris beckoning, had he played
on Saturday and taken another knock he might not have been able to play
for Scotland in France.
''He trained last night and he was fine, but Lorraine Shepherd, his
physiotherapist, told him that it would be wiser if he did not play for
us on Saturday.''
Ker stressed that the decision had caused no problems with the club.
''Gavin Hastings gives his all for Watsonians. But if, on medical
advice, he is told not to play, then he would be foolish not to heed
that advice.
''But that certainly doesn't mean that we have given up on our
challenge for the championship.''
Watsonians succumbed to Boroughmuir at Myreside a fortnight ago and
the coaches have dropped three members of the pack, including the
promising Murray Rudkin.
Ker said: ''Some of the guys thought they were in the side for life
and we decided to give them a kick up the backside. Murray Rudkin, who
has great potential, comes into that category. He hasn't been realising
that potential and a wee spell in the seconds will do him the world of
good.''
League leaders Stirling County are at Inverleith against bottom-placed
Stewart's Melville. In preparation for the game, Stirling took 71 points
off Grangemouth in a friendly on Tuesday night.
Coach Brian Edwards said yesterday that Scotland winger Ken Logan, who
is suffering from an ankle injury, is doubtful and a final decision on
whether he would play would be taken in the morning.
''There are no easy games for us now and never mind that Stew-Mel are
at the bottom of the table. Every match is critical,'' he said.
Across Edinburgh at Meggetland, Boroughmuir -- named this week as
McEwan's club of the month -- seek to keep their championship challenge
in good heart with a win over Edinburgh Academicals. But the game is
significant for the Accies, too, as they endeavour to add to their 10
points in search of the magical figure of 14 which, it is reckoned, will
be the cut-off point for the sides which will go into next season's new
eight-team premier division.
West of Scotland, too, have a crucial game today, when Melrose are the
visitors at Burnbrae. Melrose give Doddie Weir a run at blindside
wing-forward, perhaps indicating a fresh challenge at higher levels.
But West, stuck in tenth spot with four games yet to play, have a bit
to do if they are to secure their place among next season's elite.
GHK entertain Hawick at Old Anniesland, where both sides start from
mid-table positions to secure top-eight status next season, without the
injured Shade Munro. The Glasgow side, in sixth slot, has the better
launch pad, Hawick, with Derek Turnbull in the unaccustomed role of
lock, hanging on to that crucial eighth place. Both clubs have a
postponed game in hand.
In the second division, where Kelso seek to confirm their championship
status against third-placed Preston Lodge, straw has been laid on the
Poynder Park pitch in an effort to keep the frost at bay.
* THE Scottish Rugby Union ask all clubs, that in the event of their
match being called off today, to phone Murrayfield (031 346 5000)
between 9am-1pm.

Iran's deputy foreign minister Mahmoud Vaezi is insisting that
Tehran's ''death sentence'' on British author Salman Rushdie remains in
force and that he must be killed.
The remarks drew a harsh reaction from Denmark today, which said he
was reneging on statements he made in Copenhagen this week.
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said he would call on
other Nordic countries to increase pressure on Iran, which is already in
the middle of a diplomatic row with Norway and Sweden.
The Iranian news agency Irna quoted Vaezi as saying in Paris on
Wednesday that the death edict against Rushdie ''would not change by any
means''.
Vaezi was speaking during a stopover on his return to Iran from a
visit to Denmark.--AP.

against New Zealand by the close of the first day of the second Test in
Wellington.
He added 221 in partnership with Jimmy Adams, who hit an unbeaten 87,
after the tourists were given a grand start by Sherwin Campbell's
aggressive 88.
Lara, who had a relatively poor tour to India and failed in the drawn
first Test in Christchurch, responded by putting the Kiwi attack to the
sword. He delighted the crowd with his full array of shots, particularly
cuts and pulls off the back foot.
His fourth Test century included fifteen 4s, and once he reached the
milestone, off just 134 balls, he increased the tempo, often hitting two
or three boundaries an over.
He seemed poised to post another mammoth total, but late in the day
was hit on the helmet by a Danny Morrison bouncer and was then out lbw
in Morrison's next over. He hit 24 boundaries and one 6 in his 181-ball
innings.

HELPING protect Europe has left Chris Robison ill-prepared to defend
his Scottish cross-country title tomorrow on the North Inch at Perth. A
Nato exercise may not have torpedoed Lieutenant Commander Robison's
hopes, but he has spent much of the past week buried in a command bunker
somewhere in Fife. He has been on duty overnight during the week, and is
working today and tomorow, until shortly before 2155 athletes contest
the nine-race programme.
Robison knew he was sailing into the wind last weekend, when a
hamstring problem forced him out of the Royal Navy championships, an
event he had won in all of the past 14 years. But treatment has helped.
The first six men and five women in tomorrow's event, which is backed
by Perth and Kinross council, automatically qualify for the World
championship trials at Morpeth on March 5.
Since placing eighth in the inter-county championships last month,
Robison's fitness has improved. The event is shaping as a classic, but I
believe that the man who beats Tom Murray will be the ninety-eighth
Scottish men's champion. Dave Cavers (Teviotdale), Graeme Wight
(Shettleston), Robert Quinn (Kilbarchan), Tom Hanlon (Racing Club), and
Alaister Russell (Law) are the main challengers.
Murray is still hungry for a fourth Scottish crown. ''Having raced
only thrice over the country this winter, most recently placing third in
an international event in Holland, I'm fresh, rather than jaded, as I've
been in the past,'' said Murray.
The flat trail by the Tay, mainly over a golf course, may favour
Leslie Deans Racing Club, who hope to halt Cambuslang's seven-year
monopoly.
They appear to have too much strength in depth for Cambuslang, but
then it looked that way last year too. Cambuslang have shown they mean
business by opting out of the European Clubs' championship, and will
spring a surprise, by fielding Keith Anderson, who won the British
Universities title last weekend. Individual female competition is less
intense. Commonwealth team captain Vikki McPherson, a former double
winner, should be too strong for defending champion Sue Ridley and
Marlene Gemmell, but it will be interesting to see how UK triathlete
Fiona Lothian performs.
Shettleston Ladies will have to pack well to defend the team honours.
For in addition to McPherson, City of Glasgow have former champion Lynn
McIntyre, and Audrey Sim.

PEPs -- or Personal Equity Plans to give them their full title -- have
been made progressively more attractive since they were launched in
1987. They now offer one of the most flexible and tax-efficient forms of
investment available to UK taxpayers.
But what exactly is a PEP and what are its benefits? Below is a simple
Q &amp; A courtesy of a Bank of Scotland booklet on the subject.
What is a PEP?
It is a tax-free savings scheme and two types are available: the
''general'' PEP with its annual allowance of #6000, and the ''single
company'' PEP with annual allowance of #3000. You can only subscribe to
one of each type within a tax year. PEPs enable UK resident individuals
to invest up to #9000 per year in the stockmarket without tax
liabilities or complications.
What is the difference between general and single company PEPs?
Although the basic attraction is the same: tax-free investment on
stocks and shares; the two types require to be kept quite seperate. They
cannot be merged or transferred from one type to another and separate
application forms require to be completed for each type. The general PEP
is more flexible in that you can invest in equities and both investment
and unit trusts, and each year's PEP investment can be rolled up into
one PEP. Meanwhile, the single company PEP restricts your investment to
only one equity during any one tax year. You can invest in a different
one in subsequent years, but these cannot be rolled up into one PEP. A
unique feature of the single company is that it enables participants in
most profit-sharing and SAYE option schemes to transfer shares directly
into a PEP.
What are the benefits?
No income tax payable on dividends (ie increased income);
No capital gains tax liability on profits (ie avoding potential tax
liabilities);
No reporting to the Inland Revenue (ie tax returns simplified);
No minimum period of investment (ie flexible);
Invest in shares at greatly reduced dealing costs (ie good value);
A choice of full-time professional management of your own shares (ie
take a PEP or make a PEP).
Who can apply for a PEP
Any individual aged 18 or over provided he or she is resident in the
UK for tax purposes. Each adult member of a family can have an
individual PEP.
What happens to any income
Income distribution is automatic on Income PEPs, optional on
Self-Select PEPs, but not available on Growth PEPs.
How am I kept informed once I go for a PEP?
Once your application is accepted we will write to you confirming that
the PEP has been opened. For a new investor to a bank managed plan, the
PEO cannot be opened until seven days have elapsed. This is commonly
referred to as the ''cool-off'' period and is a statutory requirement
which cannot be waived by either investor or plan manager. The PEP
investor is then furnished regularly with detailed statements,
indicating all transactions, dividends and interest received plus
valuation of the plan.
How do I invest in a PEP?
Step 1: Decide upon the type you want;
Step 2: Decide upon how much you wish to invest this tax year. If it
is #6000 or less, you will probably want a General PEP (either managed
or self-select), whereas if it is more than #6000, you will probably
want to open a single company PEP also. It is important to remember you
can only subscribe to one General PEP and one single company PEP during
any one tax year.
Step 3: Decide how you want to fund your investment. The simplest
method is by cheque or (in the case of income and growth general PEPs)
by monthly direct debit;
Step 4: Remember to include your cheque with your completed PEP
application form and for monthly subscriptions, direct debit
instruction.
What about withdrawals?
A part withdrawal from a PEP can be requested or its full closure at
any time and without normally incurring tax penalties.
Can I switch between income and growth PEP?
Yes. An investor's priorities change over the years. On retirement,
for example, there is often a desire to maximise income rather than
savings. Simply tell your adviser or broker.
What happens if I die?
In the event of death, the plan ceases and the shares and cash form
part of a person's estate, to be dealt with by the executor in the
normal course. Value of shares at the date of death becomes the
acquisition cost for computation of any future Capital Gains Tax
liability which the beneficiary may incur.

COLIN Jackson relaxed nonchalantly by a piano last night, not the
least off key at the end of his unbeaten run over the hurdles. But
Scottish high jumper Geoff Parsons struck a discordant note, leaving the
hotel after having been dismissed from the team.
''If I had lost outdoors, I would feel very different,'' shrugged
Jackson, dismissing his 60 metres hurdles run on Thursday in Madrid,
where the camera put him behind American Allen Johnson, though both were
timed at 7.42sec.
It was the Welshman's first defeat since August 27, 1993, but he was
unperturbed. ''I've lost perhaps three races in 100 -- that's
consistent. These things happen indoors. If you are not absolutely 100%,
you can expect to be beaten. There is no time to recover from any
mistake. And I can't be hurdling that badly -- it was still the fastest
time of the year.
''I have to be honest. I have found it very hard to get motivated this
winter, simply because I am not doing any indoor championships.
Everything is geared to outdoors and the World title in Gothenburg.''
0 ''The dog bit the man,'' said his coach, Malcolm Arnold, the UK
director of coaching. ''If Colin had won again, it would have been no
story. But it won't change his plans. He still won't do the world
indoors.''
The World, European, and Commonwealth champion certainly cannot afford
to be demotivated today. In Glasgow's Kelvin Hall, he faces the far from
improbable prospect of defeat by a Briton, in the Interflora
international against France. He is paired with Tony Jarrett, the man
who labours under the title of the world's second best hurdler, and who
previously was viewed as the athlete most likely to end Jackson's reign.
Jackson equalled the world record in this meeting last year, and he
admits the track is fast. Jarrett may push him all the way.
A surprise figure at the team headquarters yesterday was triple
Commonwealth high jump medallist Parsons. Only 24 hours earlier, he had
been replaced in the team by teenager James Brierly, and yesterday, on
arrival, he was put firmly in his place by Arnold.
Parsons declined to respond last weekend to his invitation to join the
British team, extended after he had won the AAA title for a record fifth
time. ''We waited all week for Parsons to reply,'' said Arnold, ''then
he just showed up here. But having heard nothing, I was not being hung
out to dry, and left with just one high jumper, so I called up Brierly.
''Geoff and I have had a talk. I think he understands the position.''
Linford Christie is unlikely to be at his sharpest, having flown
Sydney-Tokyo-Sydney London-Glasgow in a week. But he should be more than
sharp enough for a modest French team. Unfortunately the visitors do not
include world 200m record holder, Bruno Marie-Rose, for John Regis to
stalk. Regis broke the UK record last weekend, and yesterday vowed to go
for the world mark in Barcelona next month.
* AMERICAN officials, concerned about the sport's image, have pulled
the plug on athletes placing legal bets on a indoor meet in Reno,
Nevada.
''Gambling and athletes do not mix,'' said USA Track and Field
spokesman Pete Cava as athletes were warned that all bets were off -- at
least for them. The ban did not affect spectators.
* CHINA'S Sun Caiyun raised her world indoor pole vault record by one
centimetre to 4.12m at a meeting in Berlin.

NEW horizons have opened up for retired people with life savings
locked up in either bank or building society who are expected to take
full advantage of Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's easing of
eligibility for corporate bonds and convertible shares, coming for the
first time within the spectrum of Personal Equity Plans.
Whether they be managed or self-select, PEPs as they are better known
in the marketplace, seems to be popping up everywhere. As fund manager
Stewart Ivory succinctly puts it: these days you can hardly move without
tripping over a PEP. People seem to be talking about them all the time
and everyone's got one to sell.
At the outset however it is best to issue a warning: remember that a
PEP represents a risk investment. Share prices can go down as well as up
and the value of your PEP can fall below your original investment, with
income dervived from share investments liable to fall as well as rise.
With that said, there is little doubt about the popularity of PEPs
which have been on the market for several years. Majoring on tax break
advantages they are regarded as representing a medium to long term --
say five to 10 years or longer -- investment.
Now with the Chancellor extending the scope of PEPs in his recent
Budget, the tax-free savings scheme introduced by the Government to
encourage wider share ownership by the general public enters a new era.
The many retired people who make up an important and ever-growing
section of British society are likely to be targeted by advisors and
brokers alike, as the annual battle between PEPs providers hots up on
two fronts.
First, there are the new bond-based PEPs sanctioned by Mr Clarke,
while more conventional companies who believe income is best generated
by investing in the long term in the Stock Market, continue to
concentrate on share-based plans.
New PEPs-orientated products just launched on the Market are designed
to secure investors' savings in the coming tax year, and collectively
represent a lightening of the recent gloomy feel in equity markets. Up
until now all but a handful have produced returns well ahead of the
rates offered by building societies, for example. This is all set to
change.
A retired person taking the first steps into the PEPs world should
seek independent financial advice but bear in mind to ask about discount
benefits when talking to either adviser or broker. Remember, there is a
lot of competition out there to handle your hard-earned cash.
For example, some discount brokers have started refunding all or part
of their commission to investors who need no advice, cutting the initial
charges by an average 3% on almost every unit-trust PEP. Others,
meanwhile, have negotiated extra discounts from the providers.
If you are contemplating a PEP investment you should perhaps look at
The Saints PEP from Stewart Ivory, or a new route for your savings
available this month when Royal Bank of Scotland Unit Trust Management
launches a new savings plan, with PEPs described as the most
tax-efficient method to invest and their plan designed of course for the
longer term investor.
For initial advice, Bank of Scotland makes available, free of charge,
a personal equity plans booklet, and packed with facts about both
managed and self-select schemes; while Chase de Vere Investment can
supply its PEPGUIDE, comparing no less than 1000 schemes to help you
make the correct choice. (#12.95, calling freephone 0800 526092.)
It is perhaps wise for new investors to ask about reducing exposure of
their savings to any sudden fall in equity prices. This can be offset
for example by investing through a monthly payment scheme rather than
making a lump sum investment.
The first three months of any year are always a busy period for the
PEP industry with thousands of individuals rushing to invest their #6000
annual allowance before the end-of-April tax year.
However, it is wise to remember that on retirement you enter that
positive time of life when you can afford to take your time to choose
the right PEP that suits your needs. Now with what independent financial
advisers the Aitchison and Colegrave Group describe as a new breed of
lower-risk high income PEPs on the market, thanks to Kenneth Clarke,
their strengths in predictability and security are likely to appeal more
to older investors.
After all, in the seven-year lifetime of the PEP, it is the over-50s
who have tended to be the most enthusiastic personal equity plan
investors.

THE Agassi Express just keeps rolling along on the ATP Tour.
Top seed Andre Agassi, winner of the last two Grand Slam tennis
tournaments and 31 of his last 33 matches, pounded out a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2
victory over unseeded German Marc Goellner to reach the quarter-finals
of the San Jose Open in California.
Agassi, the world's second ranked player, countered Goellner's barrage
of 12 aces with a relentless groundstroking game and punishing service
returns.
Third seed Jim Courier had an easier time as he swept past Nicolas
Pereira of Venezuela
6-4, 6-1 in 62 minutes to join Agassi in the quarter-finals, and now
meets fellow American Jim Grabb, a 7-5, 6-7, 6-3 surprise winner over
sixth seed Patrick McEnroe.
Top seed Boris Becker fought back from losing a marathon 24-point,
second set tie-break -- in which he squandered six match points -- to
beat fellow German Joern Renzenbrink 7-6 (7-1), 6-7
(11-13), 6-2 in the Marseille men's indoor tournament yesterday.

NOW that the dust has settled, Paul Sturrock has calmed sufficiently
to put that midweek Scottish Cup thrashing by Stenhousemuir into the
background. You don't forget about things like that.
At least a couple of players will not be allowed to erase it quickly
from memory as the Perth side resume what seems to be the mammoth task
of trying to stay in touch with the first division leaders.
Hamilton Accies are the visitors to McDiarmid Park. But they will not
be facing a much-changed Saints as reports suggested earlier in the
week. Sturrock said: ''There will be a couple of changes, nothing
drastic. The players have been left in no doubt that they must rekindle
and rebuild, and most importantly, get the fans they let down in midweek
back on their side.''
What he could have added was that probably two or three others who
goofed in midweek should also be sitting in the stand today, but his
overall message was that panic buttons have been locked away. His main
worry seems to be lack of goal-scoring, rather than a leaky defence.
Accies are just the lads to find any weaknesses.
Leaders Dundee travel to Somerset Park with first-choice keeper Michel
Pageaud suspended after last week's ordering-off. Striker George Shaw is
back after suspension, but midfielder Neil Duffy is out with a calf
injury.
Ayr manager Simond Stainrod, who has Gregg Hood fit again and Duncan
George available again after suspension, still maintains his side are
playing well enough to avoid relegation. And with his typical way of
making mischief, when asked whether or not he would be on the bench
again this week, he said: ''Since it's Dundee we're playing, I'll leave
it as a surprise.''
Dunfermline have the problem of trying to follow their victory of last
week over Dundee with a similar success over bottom club Stranraer at
East End Park. It's not as easy as it looks on paper as the Pars have
scored only once in two games against Alex McAnespie's men this season.
St Mirren, with Ricky Gillies out with an ankle injury and winger
David Elliott suspended, will face a tough time against Raith Rovers --
on a run of seven league victories -- at Love Street. Maybe if they give
Raith as tough a time as the fans threaten to do with their walk-out,
there could be a few happier faces in Paisley afterwards.

CANADIAN Mike Weir blazed through the front nine holes in 30 strokes
yesterday on his way to a course record seven-under-par 66 in the second
round of the South Australian Open over the Royal Adelaide course.
Weir's sparkling display gave him a halfway total of 141, three
strokes behind Australian joint leaders David Diaz and Anthony Painter.
Diaz, who equalled an unofficial world record in the opening round by
completing the first nine holes with just eight putts, shot a
two-under-par 71 while Painter went round in 68.
On a blustery day, Weir collected nine birdies in the space of 11
holes, including seven birdies, in his blistering attack on the opening
nine holes.
''It (his front-nine score) equals the record on the US PGA tour held
by Greg Norman, Tom Kite, Curtis Strange, Payne Stewart and Tom
Watson,'' said tournament media manager Brendan Moloney. ''It is
probably the lowest nine ever shot in Australia.''
The front nine of the Royal Adelaide course is a par 37. Leading
aggregates (Australian unless otherwise stated):
138 -- D Diaz 67, 71; A Painter 70, 68.
139 -- T Elliott 68, 71; J O'Keefe (USA) 68, 71.

RETIEF Goosen yesterday matched the course record 65 of his more
illustrious countryman Ernie Els to open a two-stroke lead in the second
round of the South African Open in Johannesburg.
Els was the leader in the clubhouse for much of the day after firing
his record-setting 65 in the morning for a seven-under-par aggregate of
137.
But then Goosen's deadly accurate approach shots set up a string of
birdie chances and after eight holes he was five under for the round. He
three-putted the ninth to drop a shot, but still covered the opening
nine holes in 32.
He also dropped a shot on the fourteenth, when his drive missed the
fairway, but four more birdies put him level with Els's record round and
a two-round total of 135. Leading aggregates (S African unless otherwise
stated):
135 -- R Goosen 70, 65.

SILVER linings have been elusive enough for Celtic in recent times,
but for their young players, the advent of manager Tommy Burns has
opened up doors to the first team that might otherwise have remained
closed.
Their response has been such that Parkhead fans can already dare to
imagine better times are within view.
Already this season, Burns has introduced players like 21-year-old
Stuart Gray, 20-year-old Brian McLaughlin, and 20-year-old Jim Slavin to
the top side. That has encouraged others to push their claim, and today,
a pair of 17-year-olds will get on the first-team bus for Hampden
knowing that they are now contenders for the premier division.
Marc Anthony and Michael Craig, both front players, have been doing so
well for the youth side that they were promoted to the reserves. Their
progress did not slow down there and, so, they are heading for the big
boys' playground.
It is possible that one or other will get a chance to wear the
first-team shirt on the field today against Hibs, but that probably will
be as a substitute. Burns has been happy enough with the showing of
Willie Falconer alongside Pierre van Hooydonk, and seems certain to let
that experienced pair start the game.
Also added to the pool are Charlie Nicholas, Tosh McKinlay, and Tony
Mowbray but the major decision will be who steps down to accommodate
McLaughlin. The tricky little winger was given a rest against Motherwell
last week, a decision which, as the team lost, inevitably brought
criticism from the fans.
But Billy Stark, Burns' assistant, while accepting that people could
argue the team would have won with McLaughlin in the line-up, pointed
out that Burns had always insisted on protecting younger players from
too much first-team exposure too soon.
If McLaughlin comes back, one of the midfield will have to drop out
and, as Paul McStay looks likely to be okay after having recovered from
an ankle injury, that leaves the manager with a problem. McStay, John
Collins, Peter Grant, and Phil O'Donnell form a pretty formidable
foursome, and selecting one to sit this out will not be easy.
Hibs would like to have countered the height of van Hooydonk with
their own giant, Steven Tweed, but he is suspended, as are Michael
O'Neill and David Farrell.
Kevin McAllister is doubtful with an ankle injury. For the Edinburgh
side and Celtic, the target remains second spot in the table, and a
place in the UEFA Cup.
Dundee United manager Ivan Golac was in his usual buoyant form as he
looked ahead to the home match with Falkirk, and two other matches in
February to come. He said: ''We began by knocking Clyde out of the cup
in midweek. Now, we have three more league games and a cup-tie in
February, with the chance to ensure there will be a very special March,
April, and May for the club.''
Golac is looking for his foreign imports, Jerren Nixon and Sergio, to
do the damage against Falkirk at Tannadice.
''I always knew Jerren would make it,'' he said, ''although he needed
time to adjust to a whole new way of life. And this will be Sergio's
first home game since he made such an impact in his debut against
Motherwell.''
Captain Maurice Malpas is out because of a calf injury and Jim
McInally will go through a late fitness test.
Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies received a timely boost yesterday when
Eddie May, who had been the subject of interest by Hearts and
Motherwell, agreed to an extension of his contract which will keep him
with the club until 1997.
Hearts keeper Henry Smith, who has been able to fend off more
challengers than George Foreman, looks set to take over from another
pretender, Craig Nelson, in the Hearts team against Kilmarnock at
Tynecastle.
John Millar is available again for Hearts, but Willie Jamieson is a
doubtful starter.
Kilmarnock, bidding for their fourth successive win, may be without
Mark Skilling and Colin McKee, who are doubtful, and add former Celtic
player Dugald McCarrison to the squad.
Partick Thistle's win over Hibs last week had every side in the lower
half of the league looking over their shoulder, and if they come up with
another success against Motherwell, there may be some panic in the ranks
of sides who feel they might be safe.
However, Motherwell are in good form again and, although Chris McCart
is suspended, both Steve Kirk and Rab Shannon are free after bans.
Manager Alex McLeish might well stand by two-goal midweek scorer Alex
Burns, even though Tommy Coyne and Dougie Arnott are fit.

* CELTIC fans who missed out on shares because the offer was
over-subscribed yesterday were guaranteed that they will own part of the
club.
More than 2000 supporters lost out first time around because over
10,000 people had responded to the share offer.
But they were promised a second chance under a new issue designed to
meet their needs, with yesterday the closing date for applications.
Stockbrokers Greig Middleton confirmed all available shares have now
been taken up. Celtic have raised #14.2m -- #4.4m above the original
target.

DRESDEN: Vandals have defaced a memorial to the 35,000 victims of the
Dresden bombing, German police said yesterday -- three days before
ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of the Second World War raid by
Allied forces. Graffiti sprayed in red paint read ''Auschwitz, Majdanek,
Treblinka, German perpetrators are not victims'' -- a reference to
concentration camps where well over a million Jews and other Nazi
victims died.

A CAPITAL-only or repayment mortgage coupled with a PEP can be a
positive way forward in the investment stakes -- but only if a person
can afford such a measure.
Even then certain steps should be taken for the duration of a mortgage
payment term to ensure personal financial success.
As little as three years ago homebuyers were being advised that an
endowment mortgage was the best way to plan for the future.
Now, that has all changed, as David Hume, director of Stewart Ivory,
explained: ''If you have some money left over on taking out a mortgage,
take a PEP because you have got the complete flexibility, you can stop
and start, and it is tax efficient.
''What would worry me about PEP mortgages is that some people may use
unreasonable assumptions. So they may say: 'I assume my investment will
grow at 12% per annum, so if I put #50 into my PEP plan over 25 years
that is going to be worth #80,000.'
''Whereas, investments in the next 25 years may not do as well as they
have done in the past 25 years because of different circumstances.''
If inflation is lower that alters the entire equation by how much an
individual can afford to borrow in the first place.
PEP mortgages can be a very good idea because they force people to
save, together with the tax savings and complete flexibility where, if a
person needs to sell his or her house or a job is lost, then, unlike an
endowment policy with poorer surrender terms, with a PEP a person can
get back what it is worth.
Another point to note is that at the end of the 25-year-term, if a
person is expected to pay off a house loan and the markets are down then
a snag can occur.
Here an individual should therefore adopt a strategy as they move
towards the pay-off period, of taking money out of their PEP to reduce
the mortgage earlier. So the message is: don't be too greedy.
John Beattie, mortgage adviser with Aitchison and Colegrave, said:
''Negative press about endowment policies has increased and therefore
investors are looking for other mortgage repayment vehicles, and now
that tax relief on life assurance policies is no longer available, PEPs
offer major tax advantages to the investor.''
Mr Beattie said that PEPs often have the option to switch to a new
investment house at relatively low cost to the investor.
''They also tend to have a larger choice of funds for investment than
more conventional repayment vehicles and for the more adventurous
investor, some PEP providers offer a range of higher risk/reward
funds.''
However, for the more cautious investor a balanced fund is more
advisable and, as a result of changes in the last Budget a new wave of
PEPs are being introduced which are expected to be of a more cautious
nature.

SEVERIANO Ballesteros, playing with the zest of his younger days, said
he ''will not feel guilty'' if he wins his own money at the Canary
Islands Open in Gran Canaria this week.
This European Tour event is being promoted by the Spaniard's own
company, Amen Corner, and Ballesteros, three shots ahead after shooting
68 and 69 in his first two rounds for a seven-under-par aggregate of
137, can hardly stop smiling.
The first prize is #41,660 and Ballesteros said with the straightest
of faces: ''It would be very nice to win my own money.''
His only complaint after his second-round 69 was the colour of the
greens. They have been sprayed reddish-purple by greenkeeping staff and
Ballesteros, showing his improving knowledge of English terms, says:
''It makes me see red when I look at the greens.
''When they paint the greens it is very nice for TV but not for
players. It is sometimes difficult to read greens when they are green,
but now they are red you often have to guess what will happen.''
Ballesteros had no complaints about the large, excited gallery who
tended to be noisy when he was about to play a shot. ''I do not mind the
crowd,'' he said. ''I have dealt with this sort of thing since 1976.''
For all his supposed putting problems, Ballesteros still managed to
single-putt four times, snapped up five birdies and dropped only two
shots.
Ballesteros leads Paul Eales by three shots and Irishman Darren
Clarke, Sweden's Anders Forsbrand, and Salisbury-based Gary Emerson by
four but is still making no predictions.
Eales, joint first-round leader with Ballesteros, Philip Walton and
Gary Orr, shot a second-round 72 with two birdies and one double bogey
intermingled with 15 pars.
''I hit the ball really well,'' said Eales, based at Royal Lytham and
St Annes. ''But I had real problems on the greens. I could never really
tell the line or pace but managed to get round without three putting so
was very pleased.''
Eales will play with Ballesteros in the third round today and said:
''It's a fantastic opportunity to learn from one of the all-time greats
and I do not think I will be nervous.''
Orr quickly fell away and shot a three-over-par 75, but Walton had an
even sadder tale. The 32-year-old Irishman was only one shot behind
Ballesteros at six under par after seven holes.
But successive bogeys at the eighth and ninth, then successive double
bogeys at the eleventh and twelfth ruined his card and he had to settle
for a 76, falling back to level.
Emerson, who began his second round one shot off the lead, had a
satisfactory 72 while both Clarke and Forsbrand improved their positions
with three-under-par 69s.
But unless Ballesteros blows up -- and on his present form that looks
inconceivable -- there will be only one winner.
(British or Irish unless stated, *denotes amateur)
137 - S Ballesteros (Spain) 68, 69.
140 - P Eales 68, 72.

STIRLING Albion have to wait to see whether keeper Mike Monaghan, the
hero of last week's 2-0 victory at Stenhousemuir, will be fit to face
Morton in today's second division promotion match at Forthbank.
Monaghan kept at bay the same strike-force that went on to put four
goals past St Johnstone in a midweek Scottish Cup tie. Morton manager
Allan McGraw feels that his team miss too many chances, but Albion would
like Monaghan to be between the sticks just in case the visitors happen
to have their scoring boots on.
Full back John Gibson is another doubt for Stirling, while Morton have
to wait for defender Steve McCahill and midfielder Paul Blair.
Another interesting fixture takes place at Broadwood, where the
division's two highest scoring teams meet. Berwick, who are one point
off second place and one above their hosts, won by the odd goal in seven
when they visited Clyde early in the season.
Clyde wait for veteran striker George McCluskey, while Berwick last
night signed 26-year-old central defender Alistair Reid from junior club
Ormiston Primrose and included him in their squad.
Terry Christie always considered that his Stenhousemuir team would be
good front-runners if they took over the leadership and there was no
reason to doubt his judgment until last week's hiccup at home to
Stirling.
Christie will be hoping that today's fixture away to struggling
Brechin City beats the weather. Tom Steel is doubtful for 'Muir, but
Brechin should have Gavin Price back in their strike force.
New manager Jimmy Crease takes charge of Albion Rovers with a third
division contest at Coatbridge against Caley Thistle, who have Dave
Brennan suspended.
Forfar are the only team in Scotland with an unbeaten home record, but
the leaders will be tested by neighbours Montrose, who are eight points
off the pace but have three games in hand.
Second-placed Ross County will hope to repeat their cup success over
Alloa, but may have to keep an eye on Danny Diver, who hit a hat trick
last week.

CLACH should be charitable if winger Johnny Seaton is below par
against Lossiemouth in today's McEwan's Lager North Cup tie. After all,
the player can hardly have found his feet after arriving from Canada in
a remarkable transatlantic Highland transfer.
Seaton emigrated over a year ago, but had his hopes of a career with
Vancouver Whitecaps dashed when he was refused a work permit. When he
decided to come home, his former club acted swiftly and, with the help
of a one-off sponsorship from British Airways, got the player back via a
10-hour flight in time to re-sign yesterday.
The 22-year-old will go straight into the squad for Clach's tie
against Lossiemouth today.

ANDREW Cowan's Warwickshire-based Mitsubishi team dominated
yesterday's first leg of the world championship Swedish rally, holding
first and second places after eight special stages.
The former rally driver from Berwickshire saw new signing, Finland's
Tommi Makinen, hurl his Lancer over the first of 25 snow and ice-covered
speed tests to share lead with reigning champion Didier Auriol (Toyota
Celica) and last year's winner, Swede Thomas Radstron (Celica).
Makinen was eventually overhauled by his Swedish team mate and 1991
winner, Kenneth Eriksson, who had a two-second lead when the rally
halted in Falun, last night.
In third place is Lanark's Colin McRae, 39 seconds behind Makinen.
McRae's Subaru Impreza recorded the fastest time on Stage 7, at 44k, the
longest in the 1600k rally. Leading positions:
1, K Eriksson/S Parmander, Mitsubshi Lancer, 1hr 51min 25secs; 2, T
Makinen/S Harjanne, Mitsubishi Lancer, 1-51.27; 3, C McRae/D Ringer

1-52.15; 5, C Sainz/L Moya, Subaru Impreza 1-52.29.

SCOTLAND'S Stephen Hendry was the victim of another Peter Ebdon great
escape act at the Wembley Conference Centre last night in the
quarter-finals of the #435,000 Benson and Hedges Masters snooker
tournament.
The cool Londoner fought back from 4-2 down to record a surprise 5-4
victory over favourite Hendry. The world's No 10 said: ''Considering the
circumstances, pressure, tension and occasion, I am delighted.''
Hendry, seeking to win the most prestigious invitation tournament for
the sixth time in seven years, made a poor start -- but so did Ebdon.
The world champion led 2-1 before he got firmly into his stride with a
112 break -- his thirtieth century of the season -- in the fourth frame.
Ebdon, who beat the Scot en route to winning the 1993 Skoda Grand
Prix, fought back by taking the fifth with a 67 break, but when Hendry
re-established a two-frame advantage at 4-2, it appeared he would
provide Ronnie O'Sullivan's semi-final opposition.
Hendry accounted for the sixth frame with an inch-perfect 141 total
clearance, which supercedes Tony Drago's first round effort of 132 as
the highest break of the tournament so far and gives Hendry an excellent
chance of scooping a #10,000 bonus.
Hendry looked certain to chalk up his twenty-fifth win in 26 matches
at the Masters since making his first appearance in 1989 -- but Ebdon
had other ideas. The former world junior champion from Wellingborough
dominated the next two frames with runs of 46 and 47.
Once again Hendry looked the most likely winner when he established a
37-1 lead, but, on a break of 36, he overcut a red to a top pocket to
throw Ebdon a lifeline. He replied with a 53 break but looked to have
missed his chance when he failed to pot a difficult last red across the
top cushion.
Hendry potted it with a black but, with tension at fever pitch, missed
a yellow with the rest.
Ebdon, breathing heavily and clearly needing time between shots to
compose himself, potted the yellow, a tough green, the brown and blue to
leave Hendry 23 points behind, with only pink and black on the table. It
was a position even the World No 1 could not retrieve.
Ebdon, who celebrated his victory in typical style by saluting the
crowd, shaking his first and raising his cue above his head, said:
''Even when I was 3-1, and 4-2 down, I kept thinking I would win. It's a
great feeling, especially because I had such good support in the
arena.''
Hendry paid tribute to his conquerer, saying: ''You've got to admire
Peter. His attitude is fantastic and he never gives up.'' Earlier,
O'Sullivan had beaten Welshman Terry Griffiths by five frames to two.

SELF-select or managed investment trust PEPs? Each have their
strengths and can be a fruitful method by which an investor builds his
or her portfolio, but you have got to know what you are doing.
The original concept of a self-select PEP is where an individual who
enjoys choosing and investing in companies goes direct to a stockbroker,
who gives that person the PEP wrapper -- such as a series of investment
trusts and which can represent an excellent way of spreading the risk
into a personal equity plan.
Various people offer self-select PEPs and some offer much more
favourable terms than others, so it is wise to shop around no matter how
sophisticated you feel you are at handling stocks and shares.
Watch the cost factor. Whoever provides the wrapper will almost
certainly charge for the service and that could be 1% of the PEP value,
just for the wraparound. Then there is the underlying cost of buying and
selling the securities.
With the investment trust a widely diversified portfolio can be drawn
together and with a personal investment looked after by a management
company and dealing costs of underlying securities all transacted at
institutional rates, which is much cheaper, then an individual no matter
how active an investor, may choose the latter as the safest way to
invest through a PEP.
In all, self-select PEPs should almost certainly be held by any
tax-paying investors with an individual equity holding in excess of
#3000. Most quoted companies offer this facility through a PEP
administrator, typically a bank or building society.
There would normally be a one-off conversion charge and an ongoing
yearly administration fee payable but this should be more than
compensated by the enhanced dividend achieved by reclaiming the tax
credit.
Self-select represents an extremely cost effective method of securing
future enhanced returns for the PEP investor.

TOM Brewster, of Lockerbie, continued to set the pace among the men's
teams yesterday evening in the Bank of Scotland Scottish Junior Curling
Championships at Kilmarnock's Galleon Centre.
His sixth-round victory by 10-4 over David Mundell, of Greenacres,
kept him at the top of the rankings and guaranteed him a place in
tomorrow's semi-finals. His only blemish came earlier yesterday when he
lost 8-7 to Ross MacKay, of Gogar Park.
The other three semi-final spots in the men's event are being chased
by five teams, including former world junior champion James Dryburgh of
Aviemore, who now has four wins following a slow start, and Craig Wilson
of Lockerbie, on three.
Fiona Brown and her Greenacres team of Julie McGregor, Susie Law, and
Jan Byers booked their semi-final place. After six rounds, Brown's team
are the only undefeated unit competing -- their 8-2 defeat of
Lockerbie's Alison Meechie yesterday following a 7-6 win over Sheila
Swan of Kinross. Kirsty Drummond, of Ayr, will join Brown in tomorrow's
semi-finals -- a 9-5 victory over Lesley Stobo of Hamilton giving her
team five victories. Results:
Men. Fourth round - D Mundell 5, C Hildrey 2; L McLeary 3, T Brewster
9; C Wilson 3, R MacKay 5; D Gladstone 7, J Dryburgh 4.

February 2.
In the ''leaked'' framework document on Northern Ireland, reference
was made to the proposed ''harmonisation'' of health, education,
agriculture and trade between north and south.
This evoked the expected response from the Unionist MPs in Parliament,
dealt with, unconvincingly, by Patrick Mayhew.
It is inconceivable that such a document could be used as a basis for
any north-south discussions without the inclusion of the vital fifth
factor necessary for the existence and stability of any country. That
fifth factor is security.
Was this part deliberately excluded from the leak due to the undoubted
furore it would have caused, and not only from the Ulster Unionist MPs?
The obvious ramifications are the disbandment of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary and policing of the province controlled from Dublin.

MYSILV can add Newbury's Tote Gold Trophy to her scoresheet today.
Last time out, she came home like a train, showing she had recaptured
her class of last season when she won here over course and distance on
similar going. She escapes a penalty for her recent win and meets
runner-up Pridwell on better terms.
Cockney Lad ran below form at Leopardstown and could be the danger if
he is back to his best. Trying Again goes well on today's ground but has
yet to prove himself on a left-handed course.
Lo Stregone is a worthy favourite for the opening race after a
commanding display over course and distance last time out. His only
defeat this season was when the extended trip at Haydock found him out
and he should see off today's rivals. Dont Tell The Wife was always
behind him when they last met and never looked like catching him before
taking a tumble.
Viking Flagship can redeem himself for a below-par run at Ascot by
landing the Game Spirit Chase. A poor entry leaves him only two rivals,
both of whom he has trounced already this season.
The big chase at Uttoxeter has only two entries running off their
correct handicap mark. On paper that should give Minnehoma the edge, but
carting top weight over this marathon trip remains a bigger challenge
than his easy victory over half the distance last month. It may pay to
oppose him with Tartan Tyrant who has only twice been beaten in over a
dozen completed runs over timber.
Desperately heavy going means disappointing fields at Ayr, where only
two line up for the most valuable race on the card. Ali's Alibi looks
set to win his fourth race of the season, but the odds are unlikely to
be tempting.
A more attractive betting proposition is Celtic Song in the Carsphairn
Chase. This game and consistent sort won cleverly at Catterick in
November and can score again over modest opposition.
Sarmatian landed some smart bets on his hurdling debut and should have
progressed enough to take the last race here.
* SCOTTISH Television sports presenter Jim Delahunt has his first ride
over jumps at Ayr today when he partners Hargold Lad in the Whitletts
Amateur Riders' Claiming Hurdle, writes Tom McConnell.
Delahunt, who reports mainly on football, had his first ride as an
amateur for Linda Perratt on Family Line at Hamilton Park last summer.
He was taught to race ride by Robert McKellar, former head lad at Cree
Lodge, who trains Hargold Lad at his Lesmahagow yard.
Said McKellar: ''Jim has always wanted to ride over the jumps. He
schooled Hargold Lad on Wednesday and the horse jumped brilliantly for
him. I hope they see out the trip.''

As a devoted English reader of your excellent newspaper, I was amused
that Mr Dave Stewart should be upset that his report of a fault on his
telephone was answered by a BT operator in Lincoln (January 25).
When we Londoners ring directory inquiries we are answered by
operators in Scotland. Unlike Mr Stewart, my English nationalism is not
''fired up'' by this. The Scottish operators are always courteous and
helpful, and usually find the right number, although some need a little
prompting about locations south of the Border.
And for nearly 20 years my tax affairs have been dealt with
efficiently and fairly by the Inland Revenue in Edinburgh. Now my file
has been moved to Salford, which can't even get my address right.
For God's sake don't declare independence or England will be done for.

You describe the SNP's current internal argument as ''a bogus quacking
affair'' (February 1). It is a nice phrase and one which could well be
extended to describe the entire devolution/separation debate.
In 1968 Edward Heath put a kilt on back-to-front and proposed a
Scottish assembly. Electoral result: zero. In the 1970 election the
Scottish Conservative vote remained static.
In February, 1974, Harold Wilson was an assembly sceptic but in
October he became a sudden convert. Electoral result: zero. With no
assembly in the February election Labour took 36.6% of the vote; with an
assembly in its manifesto in October it took 36.3% of the vote.
In a referendum in March, 1979, more Scottish voters stayed at home
than turned out to vote in either the ''Yes'' or ''No'' lobbies and in
the General Election two months later the Nationalist upsurge collapsed
having served its intended purpose of jolting Westminster out of
indifference to Scotland's problems and of firing a shot across the bows
of an indolent Scottish political establishment.
It was over. What happened after that had nothing whatsoever to do
with the Scottish electorate. The post-1979 ''devolution debate'' was a
form of political entertainment promoted and hosted by the Scottish
media and one which, without the media intending it to, rose higher and
higher on thermals of hyperbole until it left electoral reality far
below.
Throughout its close-to-13-year run the devolution debate influenced
Scotland's voting behaviour hardly at all -- Labour averaged some 39% of
the vote over the three General Elections in 1983, 1987, and 1992,
Conservatives 26%, the Lib Dems 19% and the SNP 16% with no significant
changes within these averages.
Since 1979 the only changes of a magnitude of plus or minus 10% have
been the SNP's increase of 9.8% in support and the Lib Dems' loss of
11.4% in support, hardly evidence of voters in Scotland clamouring for
an assembly or struggling to break their bonds as political prisoners.
What we are seeing now in the SNP's ''bogus quacking affair'' and in
the hapless Mr Blair having been landed on the back of an assembly tiger
is the result of politicians relegating the ballot to an irrelevance and
General Election results to the status of mere aberrations awaiting
correction by the next opinion poll.
We, of course, still have the ballot box -- if we distract our
attention from the Punch and Judy antics of a party that has averaged
15% of the Scottish vote over the past 30 years.

I made a very comfortable journey from Glenrothes to Glasgow in just
over one-and-a-half hours, arriving at Buchanan Street bus station at
2.40pm.
From then it took me till 5pm to arrive in Johnstone -- fully two
hours and 20 minutes after travelling the breadth of central Scotland --
and this was entirely due to the lack of information available at the
bus station.
It is time that Strathclyde Transport and Glasgow Tourist Board made
urgent efforts to get their respective acts together to provide travel
information to strangers who may arrive at the bus station laden with
luggage only to find themselves in the limbo of the most depressing,
uncomfortable, unhelpful long-distance terminus I have ever seen.
In short, it is a disgrace and brings shame on the city of Glasgow.

NICK Faldo failed to qualify when he had another dreadful putting day
in a second-round 71 on the 6592-yard North course in the $1.2m Buick
Invitational on a sun-soaked afternoon here at Torrey Pines yesterday.
Faldo's 36-hole aggregate of 142 (71, 71) missed the cut by one stroke
and the 37-year-old Briton was in a foul mood as he walked off the last
green. ''It all came down to one club (the putter). That's all you need
to know,'' he rapped brusquely.
Early in his second round he reverted to using a normal putting grip,
possibly in sheer desperation, for absolutely nothing had dropped.
Turning in 36 after nine straight pars and knowing he had to score
birdies on his inward stretch to join the 70 qualifiers, he showed his
championship mettle.
He holed a birdie nine-footer on the tenth green and a 10-footer at
the short twelfth to go three under. But he missed an 18-inch tap-in at
the next and a three-putt put him in dire trouble.
he looked as though he would birdie the 497-yard last when he was just
over the green in two. Perhaps thinking he needed an eagle 3, he went
boldly for the cup but the ball drifted four feet to the left. Had he
holed that putt he would have been playing today, but he again lipped
out.
He now takes a fortnight's holiday with his wife Gill and their
children in Florida before restarting in Miami on March 2. Early leading
scores:
132 -- B Chamblee 66, 66.
133 -- S Stricker 67, 66; P Jacobsen 68, 65.
134 -- P Mickelson 65, 69; N Henke 68, 66.
135 -- J Edwards 65, 70; H Twitty 68, 67; D Paulson 67, 68; J Sindelar
68, 67; M Hulbert 70, 65; B Burns 66, 69.
Other scores included: 142 -- N Faldo (England) 71, 71. 146 -- D
Feherty (N Ireland) 69, 77.
* RUSSELL Weir's team of three amateurs, including PGA executive
director Sandy Jones, had a 19 under par third round in the Arizona Ping
Pro-Am, but still could not catch the leaders.
The Cowal professional had the day's second best round, a four-under
par-68 which featured a finish of birdie, birdie, eagle and eased him
into third place overall on 220, nine adrift of Californian Charlie
Gibson.
Gibson's team, on 43-under par, also led, six ahead of Weir's men.
Leading scores (British unless stated):
211 -- C Gibson (USA) 69, 71, 71. 217 -- H Gardner (USA) 73, 72, 72.
220 -- R Weir 73, 79, 68. 221 -- S Defoy 79, 68, 74; M Slater 75, 75,
71; R Brown 70, 73, 78. 223 -- T Spence 77, 73, 73; B Waites 83, 73, 67.
Other score: 231 -- D Scott 73, 77, 81.

I refer to the article by Alan McDermid on the death of my daughter
(January 28).
We are all deeply shocked by what has happened, and while I accept
that the article was written with the best of intentions, there are some
factual inaccuracies that I would like to put right.
The fire on the boat was caused by a cigarette thrown from a passing
car during the night while my daughter, her aunt and uncle were asleep.
My wife was with my daughter throughout her stay in hospital -- she
did not travel to and from France as indicated, although I did need to
return periodically for business reasons.
Christina died peacefully some four days after doctors told us that
there was nothing further they could do for her. Her breathing was
assisted by a ventilator which was not turned off untill after her
death.
Despite her terrible injuries Christina remained conscious for most of
her time in hospital and was very brave throughout.

Have those who wish to ban the export of live calves thought through
the logic of their campaign? I abhor the use of veal crates as much as
most, but it seems to me that solely banning live exports from this
country will, in fact, increase their use on the Continent.
Dairy farmers state, correctly, that the sale of male calves is
essential to keep milk (and therefore butter, cheese, yoghurt, etc)
production economically worth while.
As customer demand for veal stands at the moment, white veal produced
by continental methods is preferred to pink veal produced by the more
humane British way. There is very little more market for British veal,
given today's preferences.
Thus, if the male calves are not exported live, then they will have to
be killed at birth; British milk production will then become uneconomic
and will cease (together with the manufacture of British butter and
cheeses) and we will all be buying continental milk and milk products,
which are economical to produce because the continental bull calves are
consigned to veal crates.
The import of continental milk and products cannot be prevented under
EU rules.
All the current campaign will produce, if successful, will be the
permanent shutdown of yet one more British industry. Surely it is more
logical to put pressure on Euro MPs and persuade British consumers to
boycott continental milk and milk products while there is still a
British dairy industry.

WHEN was the last time you looked at what your competition was doing
-- not just in Scotland, not just in the UK, but anywhere in the world
where businesses are serving the same market needs as your company?
Never, do I hear you say? Maybe you are missing a trick. There can be
no doubt that regardless of how superbly your organisation is
performing, no matter how often grateful customers shower you with
compliments and contracts, someone somewhere else is doing it better.
Sooner or later -- and these days it is probably going to be sooner --
a competitor will arrive on your doorstep with that better product or
process, and you will be caught. Worse, you probably won't even see it
coming.
In this global village of ours it has become remarkably easy to keep
in touch. If you are a computer buff you can use Internet to scan the
electronic world for intelligence on your markets elsewhere. If you are
into databases you can search any of half-a-dozen commercial services to
see what the world's media are saying about your sector.
More simply, you can subscribe to the relevant magazines or
directories that are produced for most business sectors in most
countries. The US, in particular, pours out a vast flow of publications
covering every corner of every market you have ever heard of.
For some years we have subscribed to those two US business giants
Forbes and Fortune. We admire their single-minded focus on people rather
than organisations, and the way they rank everything that moves. We
occasionally borrow ideas from these massive magazine empires for
adaption to the smaller scale of our own local market.
There is another US publication called Folio which is the magazine of
the country's vast magazine industry. It rapidly became essential
reading for a number of people in our company, offering proven
techniques to achieve such tricks as persuading readers to subscribe to
publications they originally received free (a topic of deep interest to
us).
Even better, Folio organised twice-yearly conferences. We went, along
with a sprinkling of representatives from the London magazine industry,
and we learned.
More recently, as we explore commerical prospects in the burgeoning
entrepreneurial scene in Scotland, we have taken to another couple of US
titles, namely Inc and Entrepreneur. Not only do they offer a
first-class insight into how people run successful businesses, but they
are full of good basic tips. We've also looked at similar titles in
Germany, France and Italy.
Studies of successful companies across the world show that they tend
to think internationally even if they don't actually trade outside their
own shores. They watch trends and compare themselves to the best,
anywhere.
Another important factor is innovation. Highly successful businesses
are market-led, responsive, radical and creative in their development.
They create the majority of the new niches, the breakthroughs, the leaps
of imagination that can re-define markets overnight, leaving the
bureaucratic giants struggling to stay within sight.
The third ''I'' factor must be intelligence, not so much in terms of
the sheer brain power possessed by your management team, but in the
added value you can put into your products through clever design or some
other unique element. Again it is their sharper, more focused
intelligence that helps smaller companies beat the bigger ones to the
new trend or the new technology.
When you think about it, these three ''I'' factors are interlinked.
The ability to think internationally, to innovate routinely and to apply
intelligence effectively to your business process is likely to be the
natural consequences of a specific mindset on the part of management.
The best term to describe that mindset is ''aspiration''. If you aspire
to succeed on a big scale, the odds are that you will end up doing these
things anyway.
Ah, there's always something new. And just when you thought you were
doing so well . . .

February 6.
An important opportunity will arise this spring to cure a deadly
disease -- the contagious spread of nuclear weapons.
Twenty-five years ago the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty came into
force. It was widely acclaimed as a means of curbing the threat of
planetary suicide which nuclear weapons entail.
In April, 1995, a renewal conference will be held at the United
Nations in New York to consider a new treaty. The refusal of nuclear
powers to stop their production of these weapons or to dismantle their
current arsenals sticks in the throats of the non-nuclear states. Why
should they support a treaty which the nuclear powers have consistently
disregarded?
If non-nuclear states are to continue to support the treaty, our own
Government must develop a plan that will win their support. Such a plan
could include a comprehensive test ban treaty; unconditional assurances
that nuclear weapons will not be used against non-nuclear states; and a
clear commitment to the eventual elimination of these weapons.
The Scottish churches see this as an ethical issue of the highest
importance. They invite all who share this concern to urge their MPs to
ensure that the Non-Proliferation Treaty is renewed by nuclear and
non-nuclear states -- and, in particular, by the British Government.

A TAKE-OFF in Finnair shares helped Murray European limit its losses
last year and outperform its benchmark index.
The investment trust's net asset value fell 0.9% to 63.9p during the
year to end-December, compared with a decline of 2.9% in the FT
Actuaries Europe ex-UK index. However, nav has fallen 4% to 61.3p since
the year-end.
Murray European proposed a final dividend of 0.35p, up 25%. However,
with the trust's objective being capital growth, shareholders were
warned against taking this as an indication of future dividend.
The trust's two Finnish equity holdings appreciated by 73% in sterling
terms, or #919,000, taking their presence in the portfolio from 6% to
11%. Finnair, Murray European's largest investment, performed
particularly well and forest products group Kymmene also made strong
gains.
The value of existing French holdings declined by about 7%. However,
France's weighting, the heaviest in Murray European's portfolio, was
marginally increased to 27%, with another #427,000 invested during the
year. Existing German stocks lost about 9% in sterling terms but new
investment almost matched depreciation and their year-end weighting was
steady at 15%.
During the year, Murray European cut back in Switzerland, reducing its
holdings to #1.04m, slightly more than one-third of their previous
value. This was done so investors can reap the benefits of a sharper
cyclical recovery elsewhere in Europe.
In the short run, Glasgow-based fund manager Murray Johnstone believes
further tightening by the US Federal Reserve will be followed by the
main European central banks and may constrain stock markets.
However, it believes a positive economic backdrop should mean that
periods of weakness will present longer-term investment opportunities
for the #22m fund.
Gearing was 15.4% at the year-end, compared with 14.5% at the end of
December 1993.
Manager David Briggs believes the advent of below-trend growth in the
US would be good news for Murray European investors, with the biggest
shake-out in Continental bond markets for a long time in 1994 having hit
equities.

Newsnight front man Jeremy Paxman is in the firing line because of his
no-prisoners approach to political interviews, but can the BBC tame the
man who shoots from the lip, and why should they want to anyway?
POLITICIANS, as John Major famously pointed out not so long ago, can
be bastards. They can also be dishonest, arrogant, rude, hypocritical,
self-important, sleazy, disingenuous, evasive, misleading, sexually
warped, and (the one to which they never admit) downright wrong.
Now, it is clearly impossible for each and every citizen of this
country to make a personal approach to the politician of their choice
and ask him or her the burning questions which prey upon their mind. So,
in this imperfect world, it is left to the press and the media to
appoint journalists to act upon the nation's behalf.
It is up to them to pin our elected representatives up against a
metaphorical wall and try, as best they can, to get to the heart and the
truth of the matter. It is, of course, often easier to crawl under a
snake's belly with a top hat on your head than it is to get a straight
answer from an MP.
Which is why God invented Jeremy Paxman. He is the personification of
No More Mr Nice Guy. He is vicious but fair. The Interviewer From Hell.
The Waffen SS of the BBC. The Victor Meldrew of television journalism.
His style is a heady mixture of affected boredom and almost theatrical
incredulity. A combination of a sneer (''Oh, come on now, Minister'')
and an exclamation (''Do you honestly expect me to believe that?'').
When John Birt arrived at the BBC as deputy director general in 1987,
one of his first acts was to deliver a ''wee-room job'' to Paxman. The
chap in the grey Armani suit took the big man into his office and showed
him the yellow card for his take-no-prisoners interviewing style. This,
however, was not quite so serious as you might think since Sue Lawley
and David Dimbleby received similar treatment.
Birt, as it turned out, failed both miserably and spectacularly with
Paxman. The journalist continued to be gloriously unimpressed by
political pomposity and carried on giving MPs of all persuasions and
rank well-deserved hell. In a BBC news and current affairs department
which seems these days to be the natural habitat of well-meaning but
turgidly boring and charisma-bypassed specialists (nice man that Peter
Jay but do you really understand what he's talking about?), Jeremy
Paxman stands out like a beacon of sanity and plain-speaking. He is the
People's Representative. The public's counsel for the prosecution. And
he looks good too.
With apologies to Jon Snow and Kirsty Wark, he is the only presenter
who can make BBC2's Newsnight genuinely compulsive viewing. And why?
Well, two reasons. First, because he is better at asking questions than
politicians are at answering them. And secondly, because his
confrontational style (which often comes close to intellectual mugging)
makes for damned good television. He doesn't miss and hit the wall. He
has a ''delete waffle'' button in his brain.
It is surely one of the great vicarious pleasures of life to see
Government Ministers hoist by their own petard under Paxman's abrasive
questioning.
The man is box-office material -- and the viewers love him. So,
naturally, death-wish Birt (a non-journalist who wouldn't know a story
if it bit him on the nose) wants him to change his style. Last week, in
a remarkably ill-judged speech delivered in Dublin, the director general
hit out at ''overbearing and disdainful'' interviewers who ''like the
disorientating opening question -- the rabbit punch''. Since Birt was
describing the classic Paxman technique, it was generally assumed that
he was having a go at poor Jeremy.
He went on to declare that ''elected politicians have a higher claim
to speak for the people than journalists''. Which, when you think about
it, was a very strange remark to make. It is, after all, the
journalist's job to speak for the people; to ask the questions we want
asked. If an interviewer cannot grill an MP of an evening then what's
the point in having current affairs programmes? We might just as well
show party political broadcasts and be done with it. The problem is, of
course, that Paxman doesn't so much grill them; he barbecues them. And
it is wonderful to watch.
The DG's broadside was seen as a shorthand message to Paxman -- and
his equally merciless colleague John Humphrys of BBC Radio Four's Today
programme -- to cool it with the Tories. To take it easy with Government
Ministers. No (tough) questions asked. It can only now be a matter of
time before Terry Wogan is signed up for Newsnight.
There was a time, of course, in the days when TV interviewers wore
dinner suits to work, when the politicians set the agenda. They would
decide what questions would be asked; what points would be made. It was
all very decent and gentlemanly. And stage managed.
Then, in the sixties and through the seventies, David Frost and Robin
Day came along and all bets were cancelled. They were polite and they
maintained a formal respect for politicians but there was no denying
that it was they who asked the questions. But now Day has virtually
retired and Frost has become as much an establishment figure as the
people he interviews. His Sunday morning programme is little more than
an old pals' act. So what's left?
Well, on TV there are the Dimbleby's, Jonathan and David, there's
Kirsty Wark and Jon Snow, and then there's Brian Walden. Radio fairs
somewhat better with the aggressive James Naughtie and the
aforementioned John Humphrys. All of them are highly accomplished
interviewers but head and shoulders above them stands Paxman.
A Cambridge graduate, he started his broadcasting career with a
baptism of fire -- as a reporter covering the Troubles in Northern
Ireland. In 1977 he moved to London to work on Tonight. Three years
later he went to the BBC's flagship Panorama, reporting from
international hot spots like El Salvador, the Lebanon, and Uganda.
In the mid-eighties he joined Sue Lawley and Nicholas Witchell to
front the re-vamped Six O'Clock News and, in late 1986, moved to
Breakfast Time. He joined Newsnight in 1989.
He shines on brightly in the role because he is, frankly, far more
interesting than the people he interviews (which is no great claim to
fame in these days of bland pick-and-mix politicians). Government
Ministers, with a few exceptions, could bore for Britain. The Shadow
Cabinet is little better.
Both sides are guided by those professional spin doctors who advise
them on how to avoid answering questions directly. But it is an exercise
in futility. They should play safe and stick to the 30-second soundbite
because, in the end, they are all like lambs being led to the Paxman
slaughterhouse. There is no contest in Jeremy's Parliamentary Challenge.
Bad luck Tories; can you take it Labour? Yes, but only if Bamber
Gascoigne asks the questions.

A 42-year-old man was last night charged with an attempted #4.5m
deception over an insurance claim following raids on Brocket Hall estate
in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, police said. Lord Brocket, 42, a close friend
of the Prince of Wales, was one of four men arrested on Thursday, an
employee at the conference centre at the peer's stately home confirmed.
The other three men, all from the Welwyn area, aged 39, 40, and 41,
were released last night on police bail pending further inquiries.

THE pound managed to stave off a major fall against the German mark,
closing only marginally weaker on the day at DM2.3776. That represents a
drop of a pfennig on the week, although against the dollar, last night's
close at $1.5625 meant a gain of over a third-of-a-cent on the day but
virtually no change on the week.
Dealers are very nervous about both the weekend press which is
expected to savage the Government's position on Europe with a clear
divergence seen between the Premier and the Chancellor.
Ahead lies a week of economic data, while on the political front,
there is continuing concern over the relationship with the Ulster
Unionists.
The dollar was hit by further evidence of inflation in the US with the
January producer price index pointing to a 1% rise in the prices of
intermediate goods, and so indicating higher prices for finished items.
The currency was also affected by the weakness of the Mexican peso
after the government said that it would hunt out leaders of the
rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas which could lead to more
disturbance.

IN my last game of big-time rugby, in 1987 against England at
Twickenham, I was nearly a stone underweight, had tonsillitis, got
carried off when my posterior cruciate ligament went twang, had a
shocker anyway, and succumbed to the presence of one Dean Richards, the
English No.8.
Seldom in my life had I been blown off the pitch so emphatically, and
never before by an amorphous mass of 6ft 5in, 17[1/2]st traffic
policeman, who was a mystery even to his team-mates. That's for sure.
Richards, Britain's most complete No.8 and one of the reasons that the
English pack is so dominant, is enjoying a resurgence late in his career
that never seemed likely two years ago when he was discarded by England
in their quest for someone younger. First capped in 1986, the man still
takes some stopping.
He never does interviews, but he has The Herald. ''Well,'' he said,
''down here you have to get used to being put up to be shot down again,
and that's what happened to me. Some of the boys love the media stuff,
but I don't, I like getting on with the game.''
So what motivates Richards, a man who, when on tour with England, got
invitations to join scrummage practices even when he was there -- he
hardly pushed they say. He saved it for games. He is, by all accounts,
his own man, a fellow for whom the trappings of fame mean nothing. A man
who is as happy in his police car as anywhere.
''I suppose I do keep myself to myself in some way,'' he said, ''but I
play rugby for one reason, and that is that I enjoy it. I just like the
game. I do think that there are some players at the top now who play the
game for a different reason, maybe that's cash and profile, but that
doesn't interest me and never has.''
Ever since I first saw him play I have noticed that Richards limps,
whether walking or running. How someone like him can shuffle as he does,
but influence games materially at the same time, is baffling, but a
credit to his skill. The limp is explained. ''I have one leg shorter
than the other, and that's why I look as though I'm limping.''
When it comes to size, the statistics of the English pack can be
mind-boggling. Second rows reach for the sky at 6ft 10in. Tim Rodber, at
blind-side wing forward, is 6-6, the height of Scotland's tallest man,
Stewart Campbell, who is expected to compete with Martin Bayfield, the
6ft 10in. Richards, and Ben Clarke are both 6-5.
Surely this means that England not only have the game plan, but the
size and bulk, to legitimately lay claim to the proposition that
Scotland, by comparison, are second division? Second division in height,
and skill.
''No, I don't actually go by that theory,'' says Richards.
''Certainly, our overall game has changed since we toured South Africa.
What we saw there was that their style was far more advanced than ours,
and we had to learn quickly to play a different type of rugby, and so we
did change under Jack Rowell.
''He does leave much of the organisation of the team to us as a group,
and we do work things out. I can see that happening to the Scots. People
seem very negative about the Scots, which I find sad. They have always
been great competitors, and I know that they will raise their game
against us.
''I have toured with Ian McGeechan as coach, and I rate many of the
Scots very highly, and I see that your game is advancing, too. No, it
would be wrong to say that your country is second division.''
And yet the English, with their formidable back row so influential in
last week's demolition of the French, look, in World Cup year, like one
of the major forces in the world. As Jim Telfer said wisely on last
week's Rugby Special TV programme, just when you think that the English
have one style of play, they will be one game ahead in tactics.
''Yes, we do work hard at what we do,'' says Richards. ''But to single
out the back row would be wrong. We now have a set of backs who not only
have pace, but can stay on their feet to wait for us if need be.
''We don't have an out-and-out open-side flyer like Neil Back, but Ben
Clarke is learning the role all the time, and the extra time that Will
Carling and Guscott can stay on their feet helps us. Also, the front
five work hard. They win the games.''
With that it was time to say goodbye. He is a charming man. He may
frustrate Scots with the way he can kill the ball so adeptly, but their
is no questioning his the will to win, love of the game, and genuine
feeling for the sport that embraces one of England's towers of strength.
''I feel I am very lucky to have played in what people may well look
back on as a golden era in the sport,'' says the English mountain, ''and
I've enjoyed it all, even some of the bad times. I look forward to the
game with Scotland.''
After a gentle word as to Scott Hastings' well-being, with me having
to explain why he is not in the side, he was off to spend his weeekdays
behind the wheel of a fast police car on the motorways, and his weekends
crushing some of the best opponents in the world with a limp, but a
singular style of his own.
Dean Richards is a rare commodity indeed. Dean Richards is a dying
breed. Dean Richards is some rugby player.

SALLY Gunnell, the UK athletics team captain, had planned to defend
her status as Britain's 400 metres No.1 today at the Kelvin Hall against
the rising star of the sport, Melanie Neef, who has logged nine Scottish
record-breaking performances since the turn of the year.
Instead, Gunnell is nursing a heel injury, and Neef is left to put
Britain's best foot forward against France, taking all the pressure.
Typically, Gunnell has sent a message of encouragement, and even
concedes that on one count at least, Mel is better equipped to cope than
she was herself in the early stages of her career.
''I'm sorry not to be running,'' says Sally. ''I know Mel wanted me to
help her to a fast time, but she will run great. She handles pressure
far better than I did when I was starting out.''
It is hard to imagine Gunnell as anything other than Miss Cool. But
she is quick to recall 1986, and her European Championship debut: ''I'd
come straight from the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where I'd won
the 100m hurdles, to Stuttgart. I thought I had plenty of confidence,
until my first-round heat. There, in the next lane, was the world record
holder, Yordanka Donkova.
''I looked at her, and she seemed just about the biggest, toughest,
and butchest athlete I'd ever seen. Then I totally cracked up, for here
was this woman with no fingers -- she'd lost three in an accident. I
absolutely froze when we were going down on our blocks, and was knocked
out.
''But Mel has already shown how well she can cope. She was Britain's
only winner when she made her debut indoors against Russia last year.
And she ran brilliantly at the Europa Cup, both individually and in the
relay, and got to the European and Commonwealth finals. I know it must
have been frustrating for her not to dip under 52 seconds. But she
learned a lot at all these big championships,
''It will do Mel a lot of good to be the centre of attraction in front
of her own crowd. I know she won by miles last week (when she won the
AAA title). I hope she goes to the World championships -- she has a lot
of talent. It's just a question of keeping on working.''
Neef is quick to repay the compliment: ''Sally was really encouraging
last season. I was a nervous wreck, but she really put me at ease.''
Gunnell herself has been training as never before, spurred by the
spectre of a woman called Perec, and by the vision of broadening her
unique niche as Olympic, World, European and Commonwealth champion.
Only four other British women have ever won an Olympic title: Mary
Rand, Ann Packer, Mary Peters and Tessa Sanderson. None ever retained
it.
After a successful defence of her 400m hurdles title at this year's
World Championships in Gothenburg, Gunnell rates the Atlanta Olympic
crown as her next priority. Some believe she faces an impossible task.
Marie-Jose Perec, the French World and Olympic 400m champion, has a flat
400m speed more than two seconds better than Gunnell's, and Perec is
switching to the hurdles this year, with the avowed aim of tearing
Gunnell's record apart.
Gunnell, whose world hurdles mark stands at 52.74secs, says: ''I think
Perec feels that because of her flat speed, all she has to do is turn
out, and she'll run between 51 and 52 seconds. I think she is in for a
surprise.''
Even after eight years at the one-lap hurdles, Gunnell adds: ''There's
still a lot for me to learn -- and Perec is just starting. She's got to
work out how to adapt her stride pattern to the wind. You'd be surprised
how stressful learning the adjustment can be. She'll find out there more
to it than just jumping over a few sticks.''
It is a rare glimpse of the iron fist of the champion in the lavender
and lace of the Essex lady.
''Perec has always been at the back of my mind over the winter. I
always feel guilty if I miss a training session. Working out in the
rain, in rotten conditions, are the days that make you a champion, so I
don't often avoid them. But preparing to face her has given an extra
edge to my training. I avoided some of the winter by going to Pretoria
in mid-January. I wanted to try altitude for the first time, so there
was a lot of monitoring. We stayed at just under 6000 feet.''
But only for three weeks. ''I miss home, and I miss my cats -- Demi,
Chloe, and Poppy. Jon and I miss our friends. I'm not big on bars and
clubs, but I prefer a nice meal out, or entertaining a few friends at
home.''
Despite missing out today, Gunnell will be able to assess the effects
of her altitude experiment over the next two weeks. She plans a low-key
race in Germany on Wednesday, another in Sindelfingen, and an appearance
at the TSB Games in Birmingham. ''The heel problem is minor,'' she says.
''Missing Glasgow is just a precaution. I don't want to take any risks
in such an important year.
''Gothenburg, the World Championships, is the high of the year for me
-- retaining the title, and hopefully breaking the world record.
''The hardest thing is saying no -- to interview requests, personal
appearances, opening things. I try to restrict them to my rest day,
oherwise it interferes too much with training.''
The girl who used to deliver turkeys from the family farm is big
business now: children's TV, Avon cosmetics, modelling clothes,
aerobics, sports drinks, a sports bra. But she believes even more
uplifting triumphs are to come.

I will make you brooches and toys for your delight
Of bird song at morning and star-shine at night.
I will make a palace fit for you and me
Of green days in forest and blue days at sea . . . RLS
VALENTINE'S Day. Corny? Commercialism? Forget all that. February 14 is
not a day to celebrate cynicism.
Instead, it's one in which romance should wholeheartedly blossom, for
isn't it love that makes this funny old world go round?
Despite all the perceived -- and real -- changes in modern life, the
postie's arrival on February 14 can still be as eagerly awaited as it
was in grandma's day.
Writing, postmark, and messages are all closely scrutinised for clues
by the recipient, whose racing pulse is in considerable contrast to the
usual cool and in-control approach favoured by today's youth.
And talking of cards, they come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and
types from the cloyingly OTT to downright tasteless and everything else
in between.
Particularly lovely and sure to be kept for a long time to come are
the packs of three cards that open out into dainty, pretty fans
available from Past Times branches in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen.
The top of each fan is delicately shaped into a little heart, while
the lower part of the card carries the message A GIFT OF LOVE . . .
cupids and hearts, flowers or cameo pictures of couples provide the
decoration.
Different and sure to touch a heart or two, the pack costs #10.95 and
you put your own message on the back. When open, each card measures from
6in x 11in to 7in x 13in.
Having got the card arranged, the next thing is to decide on your
present. Flowers, as everyone knows, have a language all their own.
Little wonder, then, that Valentine's Day sees florists enjoying one
of their busiest days of the year.
There is something especially appealing and romantic about receiving a
gift of flowers in all their fresh and natural beauty; it's one
tradition that never goes out of fashion.
In similar vein is the perennial appeal of chocolates as a gift. Not
the thing to give your beloved if he or she is desperately fighting a
losing battle of the bulge, but for anyone else a welcome token that can
come in many imaginative and attractive guises.
Thorntons have all sorts of ideas, from single choccy hearts,
sometimes bearing romantic messages -- even ''Marry Me please'' for the
seriously coy suitor -- to heart-shaped boxes of extravagant temptation.
Picwicks in Edinburgh have unusual boxes, covered in material,
creating a dinner jacket and black tie, which can be filled to order
from a wicked range of Belgian chocolates.
A nice idea away from the usual roses and ribbons theme.
Very romantic, thoughtful, and totally acceptable to either sex is the
gift of an evening at a dinner dance. Even more so when it includes
overnight accommodation.
Here is the chance of a complete switch-off for a few magical hours,
to enjoy a meal against a background of music and an evening's dancing.
If you're staying over there's no need for the driver to stick to
mineral water all night, nor is there that spell-breaking moment when
you step out into icy temperatures at the end of it all.
Instead, there's a gentle ascent to a warm bedroom . . .
Aromatherapy products, which create a relaxed ambience, make a nice
present, especially in conjunction with a good tape, CD or video to
while away the evening a deux. Just the thing to set the scene for
romance.
Aromatherapy burners sprinkled with essential oil provide fragrant
room scents, or you could buy one of the lamp bulb burners that fit on
top of a bulb, the heat of which diffuses the oil. You'll find these in
lots of shops, including Crabtree &amp; Evelyn branches.
Cobra and Bellamy's latest jewellery collection includes a 22ct.
gold-plated necklace festooned with heart-shaped amber stones for #95,
or a pair of earrings -- made for the occasion -- featuring a 22ct.
gold-plated cherub, set with an amber cabochon heart.
At #101 they're not exactly a snip, but certainly something to value
and treasure for many years to come. Both are available from Frasers,
Glasgow.
Frasers also offer Michelson pure silk cravats for those times when
the man in your life favours a little informality while retaining a
sartorial elegance. In a variety of patterns, they cost from just under
#20.
For anyone who collects little boxes, there's an unusual circular one
on offer from Past Times in silver-plated pewter, with a background of a
Victorian floral pattern. Its focal point is the initial of your choice.
Good value at #12.95.
The same shops have what they call the Elizabeth Barrett Browning
ring. In gold-plated silver, and costing #45, its unusual hexagonal
setting holds an amethyst stone. The original is in the British Museum,
and is inscribed with its owners initials.
But what if you get to the point where time has run out -- or, dare
you admit, you forgot -- and you simply don't have the chance to browse
in the shops for inspiration?
You can, of course, always fall back on the faithful flowers,
chocolates, favourite perfume or after-shave; or you might like to nip
into the off-licence and select a really nice bottle of wine or
celebratory fizz to enjoy together.
Dash into Marks and Sparks in your lunch hour and you could go the
whole hog and buy a ready-made meal, and a bottle of wine, so that all
you need do is settle down to a romantic evening meal that has hassled
no-one in its preparation.
Here's to romance.

A leading Tory takes issue with his party's frantic flag waving when
confronted with devolution. Hugh Barnes reports
AWARNING that John Major is stirring up resentment against Scotland in
England has come from one of the Tory Party's most senior and respected
figures, Lord Gilmour of Craigmillar.
Gilmour believes that right-wing Conseratives in England tend to be
anti-Scottish, and that many of them would be pleased if Scotland left
the UK. He is worried that while John Major is trying to defend the
Union, by pandering to the right-wing in his party he may be in danger
of breaking it up.
Gilmour should be listened to because in the course of a long and
distinguished political career he has spoken and written about Tory
policy on devolution with a consistency and expertise often lacking in
his erstwhile Cabinet colleagues.
The former Sir Ian Gilmour, Mrs Thatcher's deputy foreign secretary
from 1979 to 1981 and thereafter a leading Tory Wet, owes a great deal
to his Scottish background. As a child, he spent family holidays at
Craigmillar Castle. Later he married Lady Caroline Margaret
Montagu-Douglas Scott, younger daughter of the 8th Duke of Buccleuch.
He takes issue with Major who recently characterised Scottish
devolution as ''a folly'' and ''teenage madness''. As he wrote in 1992:
''If a large majority of Scots want a Scottish parliament (which most of
the time they do) I have never been able to understand why the great
majority of the Conservative Party should nowadays be so determined to
frustrate them.''
Gilmour believes that John Major's frantic flag-waving bodes ill for
the quality of the debate about constitutional reform. ''I think that
Major's position of extreme centralisation in Britain and increasing
hostility to Europe is wrong on both counts, as well as being
inconsistent,'' he said. ''I've always been in favour of devolution,
even more now than I was in the 1960s, because Britain was nothing like
so centralised then.''
Lord Gilmour is at a loss to understand how the Prime Minister can
argue for subsidiarity in the European Union, yet argue against
devolution for Scotland. ''It's completely inconsistent,'' he goes on.
''The only consistent part is that he's trying rather irresponsibly to
gain votes by wrapping himself not in the Union Jack, but in the English
Jack. No, it's utterly inconsistent. A bit of subsidiarity at home is
obviously what this country needs.''
Unlike Tory policy, Gilmour's views on a Scottish parliament have
remained unchanged since 1969 when he argued for ''considerable
devolution'' in his book The Body Politic. In May of that year the party
leader, Ted Heath, proposed an elected Scottish assembly. Two years
later the party's constitutional committee, chaired by Sir Alec
Douglas-Home, also proposed a Scottish assembly. In October 1973 a royal
commission came out in favour of an elected assembly. At both 1974
elections the Conservative Party promised Scotland devolution.
After that, however, things ''started to go backwards'', as Gilmour
puts it. In Opposition, at the time of the Callaghan Government, Mrs
Thatcher reached the point where she believed she could abandon the
party's long-standing commitment to devolution.
''I offered my resignation to Mrs Thatcher from the Shadow Cabinet on
account of that Bill,'' he replied. ''And she very charmingly turned it
down.'' Why did he offer to resign? ''Because I was strongly in favour
of devolution, and I was on the record as being so, and I thought the
Conservative reversal was opportunistic and a mistake. And I didn't feel
able to vote against the Scottish Bill. Mrs Thatcher said: 'Oh no, you
can't possibly resign. I'll just arrange with the Chief Whip for you to
be away instead'.
''Of course, I did not know then what I know now, how Scotland would
suffer from the centralising of Thatcherism. You see, a vacuum was
created -- it was a gratuitous act of aggression to almost wreck local
government -- and I think one of the disappointments about John Major is
I thought he was going to change that and redress the balance. But he
hasn't done it at all really. The rhetoric is soft but, if anything, the
Government has been more dogmatic.''
Yet Gilmour understands that Mr Major is under pressure from both the
left and the right of his party, and that he is threading a narrow
passage between shoals on either side. A former chairman of the
Conservative Research Department, he merely quarrels with Major's style,
which is to accompany one or two steps to the right with another step,
usually a smaller one, to the left.
Was the Prime Minister playing a dangerous game by courting the
anti-Scottish, Eurosceptic right? ''I don't know because I don't know
what his motives are. But I think it's wrong as far as policy is
considered. I think it's wrong both ways. Both vis-a-vis Scotland and
England and vis-a-vis Europe. I think it's doubly wrong. But, as John
Major has drifted to the right more or less consistently since 1992, I
suppose he thinks it is the best way of uniting the party, but I think
it's a very expensive way of doing it.''
Expensive? In what way? ''From the point of view of British interests,
national interests. It's putting the party before the country. You see,
on the whole right-wing Conservatives tend to be anti-Scottish, partly,
I suppose, because Scotland tends to be left-wing.
''They are English nationalists who regard Scotland as a province.
They seem to be under the misapprehension that the Act of 1707 was an
Act of annexation by England and not an Act of Union between the two
countries. They are strictly speaking Little Englanders, not just in the
usual sense -- against Europe -- but also against Scotland.
''And that, of course, is one of the dangers of John Major's attitude.
He actually stirs up resentment against Scotland in England. Many
right-wing Conservatives would be pleased if Scotland left the UK.
''Many of the people who hold such a view are also 'anti-Europe' and
would themselves like to leave the European Union. So if they had their
way, Scotland would become a Belgium to England's Holland, though with
Scotland in the EU and England out of it. That, I suppose, would be the
ultimate in Little Englandism.''
I asked if he had a blueprint for what he had at various times called
''proper'' or ''considerable'' Scottish devolution. ''You know, I'm not
sure I didn't even produce a Bill -- it's probably somewhere but I
couldn't find it now. No, I wouldn't like to define it off the top of my
head. Obviously it would involve considerable powers of education,
health and so forth, and a limited taxation capacity.''
In other words, something not very far from what the Labour Party is
advocating at the moment?
''Yes, I think that's roughly about right,'' he said. ''Mind you,
that's more or less what the Conservative view used to be until they
abandoned it on rather opportunistic grounds in the mid-seventies.''

THREE men forged Scottish banknotes with a face value of #75,000
because they were easier to counterfeit then English ones, Exeter Crown
Court was told yesterday.
Stephen Morris, Thomas Rogers, and Peter Todd, all from Torquay, and
who all admitted their part in the forgery, used laser printers and
ordinary cream paper to set up their counterfeiting business in
Scotland.
Morris was jailed for four years, Todd for 18 months, and Rogers was
sentenced to eight months.
They decided to make Scottish banknotes because they do not have a
metal strip in them. They were caught out by a sharp-eyed shop assistant
at Dunbar, East Lothian.
Mr Peter Ashman, prosecuting, said Morris, 36, was the ringleader and
he gave Rogers forged #20 notes with a face value of about #40,000.
Rogers told police he was ''just looking after it''.
Mr Ashman said: ''Fifteen to 18 serial numbers were attached to the
notes and they were made from laser printers and other printing works
worth #4000.
''Morris bought the equipment after selling his factory, with the
desire literally to make money. He admitted he was greedy and stupid.''
Miss Sarah Munro, defending Morris, said: ''I don't dispute for one
minute that this was a serious exercise and that Mr Morris is required
to be a skilful man to do it.
''But his interest was whether or not he could do it, without thinking
of where he could dispose of the currency.''
Miss Munro said it was the first time bachelor Morris had become
involved in a serious offence and his ''fall from grace'' came shortly
after the death of his brother.
The court heard Todd was arrested after trying to pass one of the
notes in a Spar shop at Dunbar when he tried to buy a packet of
cigarettes. The female shop assistant immediately thought it was
counterfeit.
The court heard Rogers, 46, a former coal miner, took part in the scam
only because his greengrocer's business failed and he started working
for Morris and needed to repay him a favour.
Mr Nicholas Ford, defending him, said: ''Rogers took a large quantity
of money on behalf of Morris. His one excursion north of the Border was
his downfall because the first two people who looked at the notes
complained about them. They were conspicuously useless.''
In jailing the gang, Judge Graham Neville said: ''You three men have
been involved in a very serious crime. Any counterfeiting, or taking
part in counterfeiting, must be punished and only custody can be
justified.''

John Major said that ''whatever happens during discussions'' on the
future of Northern Ireland at the end of the day it will be the people
who live there who will rightly have the last word about what happens to
their country (February 1).
Why not let them have the first word? Have a referendum now. Ask a
simple question: ''Do you want to stay within the United Kingdom or
not?''
The result will tell the Government what the people of Northern
Ireland want and give them a realistic starting point from which to
produce -- if they must -- future discussion documents based on reality
and not on government-inspired ideology.
In other words cut the cackle, ask the people, and act in accordance
with the result.

Terry Lewis's Private Member's Bill (the Tobacco Products Labelling
Bill), which has its second reading in Parliament on February 17, seeks
to ensure that tobacco packaging is less attractive to young people and
that prominent health warnings covering at least 25% of the pack are
positioned at the top.
Health warning information is most likely to influence at least two
distinct groups -- people considering trying out smoking, eg children,
and established smokers contemplating giving up.
Scotland has an appalling record of tobacco-related disease. A total
of 10,000 people in our country die prematurely every year from the ill
effects of smoking.
The Governments in Canada and Australia have recently introduced
tougher health warnings on cigarette packets. South Africa is ready to
follow this example. For the Lewis Bill to succeed, MPs from all parties
need to attend the debate on February 17 and give it their widespread
support.

<HEADLINE>An agent provocateur who will never say die McMurdo has his players' interests at heart</HEADLINE>

EVEN the mention of his name is inclined induce a state similar to
apoplexy in many boardrooms around the country. For a wee man, Bill
McMurdo seems to cause big trouble.
As the first footballers' agent to make his presence felt in this
country, his advent on the scene was never likely to be greeted with
flag waving by the establishment which was, and remains, suspicious of
outside traders.
But McMurdo has engendered such controversy in the 17 years he has
been in this business that there is virtually no-one closely involved in
the game who has indifferent feelings about his interventions.
If there ever was a man who has managed to provoke angry reaction,
this one-time sales director of Timex is the one.
Since he became the first agent in Scotland to look after footballers'
contracts (''maybe the first in the UK''), when Derek Johnston was his
original client, he has built an empire of players, from juniors to
leading lights, has become a constant protagonist for chairmen,
managers, and many of us who observe from outside the centre circle.
The impression you might gather from speaking to the nattily dressed
former Hibernian player is that he rather enjoys the notoriety. He did
not say as much, but it is hard to avoid the suspicion that a good
barney which gets his name and those of his players in the papers is no
bad deal. Projecting his clients, none of whom, he will tell you
proudly, has ever had a contract with him, is the name of his game.
In the process of establishing the right to have an agent's place in
football, McMurdo was always liable to fall out with the directors and
managers who, until his arrival, dealt directly with their own players.
Resentment at his interventions, especially when he would inevitably
hoist the basic values to levels the clubs would have prefered to avoid,
was bound to be rife.
He has had spectacular and public fall-outs, instanced currently by
the open slanging match being conducted between him and Hearts manager
Tommy McLean, climaxed last week by McMurdo's declaration that he would
like to think he would ''never have to deal with a McLean again.''
That typically abrasive remark, which immediately condemned Tommy's
big brother, Jim, as well, is not thrown in during a fit of anger.
In fact, he claims that he never shouts, never screams, and never
loses his temper in negotiations. ''I am actually a quiet person,'' he
says without a semblance of a blush.
''In fact, John Robertson, of Hearts, only recently asked me why I
never get loud or rant when I am involved in these things. I told him it
is not in the player's best interests to do that.''
Wasn't his remark about McLean deliberately aggressive, none the less?
''Yes, and I will tell you why. I have played by the book all the way
down the line with Jim McLean and Tommy McLean for a number of years
now. They have got to the stage where they have pushed me to the limit
by their treatment of certain players.
''There comes a time when you have got to say: enough is enough, do
away with the niceties and go for it.''
''I don't believe there should be option clauses. There is no need for
them under freedom of contract. And the way Tommy McLean has gone about
certain things in relation to Maurice Johnston, Jim Weir, and Nicky
Walker, I feel I had a duty to go public on that issue.''
''I have been the one who has held out the olive branch and advised
players never to say never but there comes a time when you have to call
a halt. I won't cow-tow to anybody.''
McMurdo, who is one of three businesmen involved in an intriguing new
scheme to invite investment in the future of young Scottish players,
would tell you that if there is opposition to the innovative proposal,
it will be no surprise.
''I was involved when Hibs were the first team in Britain to wear a
sponsor's name on shirts. They were fined and we were told it would
never happen.
''I was the first person in Scotland to introduce family enclosures,
sponsored by Panini, which were to spread throughout the country.
''At that time with Hearts I was responsible for their kit sponsor,
jersey sponsor, and enclosure sponsor.
''I was first to oppose option clauses, first to organise the lottery
for the SFA and its Hampden cause. I was also one of the first to
introduce game sponsorship in Scotland, to Hibs and Airdrie.
''Now, it is commonplace. I worked with Hugh Adam, of Rangers Pools,
to introduce corporate hospitality into this country.''
He will, he says, expect knockers of the new investment company's
propositions but, perversely enough, imagines that would be a sign that
it will succeed.
George Best, when he was with Hibs, was one of his first clients, and
he now has 50 players from all over the UK, Europe, and America.
His most notorious escapade, even if he claims to have had only a
minor role, will always be considered the transfer of Maurice Johnston
to Rangers two months after he had been paraded at Celtic Park as a
returning hero.
McMurdo will ever insist that the transfer to Celtic might well have
gone through if he had been involved. ''As it was, Celtic did not want
to deal with me and it was through a letter I told Maurice to give to
Chris White that I had to let them know that for contractual reasons he
could not sign for Celtic, or anybody else, at that time.
Unfortunately, Celtic went ahead with the press conference and Maurice
got caught up in the euphoria of it all, which he regrets now.
''The Rangers deal came about weeks later but the truth is I did not
want Maurice to sign for any British team at that time. I would have
preferred him to stay abroad for a few more years.''
It is an explanation he insists is the way it was but many thousands
will never accept it as the whole truth.
Either way, the McMurdo business will continue to flourish and Celtic
players will continue to join his empire.
The fact that he is a committed Rangers fan has never prevented him
representing Parkhead players in the past and will not in the future.
Pressed on how powerful are his Ibrox emotions, he replied: ''I am a
royalist more than a Rangers supporter'' a statement given credence by
the large picture of The Queen which is the centrepiece of a lounge wall
at home.
His Hibs career was cut short by injury but he retains a soft spot for
them and had a long association with Hearts under Wallace Mercer.
The current chairman, Chris Robinson, who has fallen out with McMurdo
(the latest in a long line) may take comfort in the knowledge that
Mercer, too, had many a row over the 12 years he knew and dealt with the
agent.
''I had a great respect for Wallace and what he did for Hearts and the
game in general but we had our rammies. I remember once he shouted at me
and barred me from Tynecastle for ever. The same night he phoned me to
say: 'There will be two comps for the game tomorrow in your name at the
door, but don't say I left them.' ''
McMurdo has applied to the SFA for the FIFA agent's licence which, in
future, will be required to deal in direct transfer negotiations but
with great reluctance.
''I have only done it for the sake of my players but I believe the
whole thing is a restriction in trade and I am sure I could win any
court case to prove it. I don't want to compromise the players but if it
was down to me alone I would take them to court tomorrow.''
For other agents, the necessity to be in at the sharp end of
negotiations may not be vital but for McMurdo it is imperative. His
strength, whether clubs like it or not, is his ability to get the best
for his players, otherwise they would not be on his books for long. He
claims that most managers and chairmen dispense with the waffle once
they know he is involved ''and get down to the nitty gritty.''
The man who, unquestionably, is the most controversial figure of his
kind in the game revels in the cut and thrust of debate, holds strong
views, and is inclined to put them forward in confrontational style.
He will not worry about it, but he is never going to be the best-loved
wee man in the game.
''I get a good living and I love my work but I think my contribution
to football has been a lot greater than people would give me credit for
''My job is to market the game and to do that properly you have to
look after the main players, the footballers.
''Without them you don't have a game.'' Even he would be hard pushed
to provoke a row with that observation. But don't bank on it.

THE wonderful expression ''Close encounters of the third kind'' was
coined by Dr J Allen Hynek, scientific adviser to Project Blue Book,
which was the US military's attempt to make some sense of the phenomenon
of unidentified flying objects (or UFOs). The first two categories were
sightings at a distance and observation of a UFO at close quarters. The
third was close contact with UFO crew members in or outside the object.
These ranged from abductions to episodes in which the occupants of the
object probed the anatomy of humans and in some cases had sex with them.
The Hynek and Condon reports appeared 25 years ago and were far from
conclusive. They certainly did not stop the phenomena which, even the
sceptics had to agree, could not all be written off as delusion or
fraud. In 1980, close encounters of the third kind were the subject of a
blockbuster movie, which was followed by the magical ET. Aliens were
portrayed as being rather more friendly towards earthlings than in the
days of Quatermass and The Midwich Cuckoos in the fifties, when the
response of bewildered spectators was either to take to their heels or
call up the tanks.
Why I am telling you all this? Well, the first reason is that at
midnight on Thursday I took part in a Radio 5 live discussion on the
matter in the Night Moves programme. Guests included sceptic Steuart
Campbell, who used to think UFO sightings were mostly a natural but
little known phenomenon called ball lightning, but is now more inclined
to put them down to reflections caused by temperature inversions in the
atmosphere.
Ranged against him were Gloria Dixon of the amateur research body
Bufora and Graham Campbell, an ex-BA pilot who had spotted two UFOs
during his flying career.
My role was somewhere in the middle -- neither expert, believer, nor
sceptic, pointing out that many of the UFO stories have echoes of devils
and demons reported in the late Middle Ages and that they parallel many
other areas of the paranormal such as apparitions and near-death
experiences. Many of these refer to ''beings of light'' and fast-moving
shapes, and seeing figures which seem to beckon them into a tunnel.
I tried to argue that as well as the mundane explanation of mistakes
caused by meteorology, or the exotic hypothesis of aliens who are using
superior technology, there is a third possibility -- that UFOs may be
intrusions from another dimension parallel to our own but sculpted in
the culture and technology of our myths and fears. While this
metaphysical debate was raging, on the line came Councillor Billy
Buchanan from Bonnybridge, which appears to be to UFO appearances what
the Bermuda Triangle is to disappearances.
In all shapes and sizes they have come -- cigars, saucers, and
Toblerone-shaped bars. His intervention reminded me that more than a
decade ago I had twice covered UFO encounters of the second kind and
they were both in the ''Bonnybridge Triangle''. Apparently things are
even hotter these days.
But what worried Councillor Buchanan was official indifference to
these incidents. He was not alleging cover-up but intends to try to
bring the Bonnybridge phenomena to the attention of the Prime Minister
so that an official investigation can be mounted. The problem is that
the military has lost interest since there is no longer any fears that
UFOs pose a strategic threat. Perhaps funding for an investigation could
be placed within the University of Stirling? It's a thought.
What impressed me about the calls to the programme the other night
were the number of sane, articulate witnesses who had not shared their
sighting with anyone until prompted to do so by the programme. To write
them all off as deluded or pranksters just did not fit the facts.
Attempts to give natural explanations are often more implausible and
convoluted than the UFO hypothesis. So what should be done?
There is no doubt that a Freedom of Information Act would help to make
available some more interesting material by opening up official files.
It is ridiculous that we still cannot read about the interrogation of
Sir Oswald Moseley during the Second World War because the files are
deemed too sensitive. Equally, it is absurd that officialdom can seal
information about UFO sightings which can have no further military
relevance.
The problem is that we will probably never reach a conclusion on the
matter. ''Some say it thundered -- others say an angel spoke'' is the
Bible's way of saying that there will always be ambiguity about such
matters. Heavenly messengers; superior beings; weather conditions; ball
lightning; lack of oxygen to the brain; schizophrenia. These are but a
few of the totally contradictory hypotheses which are advanced to
explain UFOs. But because the area is riddled with sceptics and
credulous flat-earthers, it does not mean we should not keep an open
mind.
Perhaps the Bonnybridge Triangle could be set up as a rival tourist
destination to the Trossachs and Loch Lomond, a sort of saucer safari in
which coaches packed with little yellow men with Nikons round their
necks could run around making squealing noises and photographing the
little green men. Yes, we should not take it too seriously, but to
ignore it completely seems even more bizarre than the UFOs themselves.

HOW do PEPs compare with personal pensions? Investigation reveals that
it is not enough to compare tax relief. Comparative costs go much
deeper.
There is no doubt that an advantage of a pension fund is that you get
tax relief at the time you put the money into the fund. So, if you
happen to be a 40% taxpayer, this means that for every #100 it only
costs you #60. Your money then accumulates inside the fund but when you
take your money out you must pay tax. So, if you are likely to be a 25%
taxpayer near to and on retiral, then that is good news.
On the other hand tax rates can also go up during the duration of a
personal pension and in that case this is not so good.
The main problem with a pension fund is that having put your money in,
you cannot take it out. With a PEP, however, it is exactly the other way
around, but the benefit can be identical.
You do not get tax relief on money going into a PEP but when it comes
out it is tax free. In the meantime the money accumulates tax free.
David Hume, pensions expert with fund manager Stewart Ivory, said that
on comparing the two forms of saving, the PEPs does represent the best
deal because an individual retains a flexibility in using his/her money
now, rather than having to wait until retiral. Tax benefits overall are
equal.
Another point to remember is that pensions are much more complicated
to administer than PEPs and as a consequence, charges tend to be greater
and are much more difficult to understand.
If a person sets up a personal self-administered personal pension,
costs will be significantly more than a self-select PEP.
So overall, it is not enough to think of tax relief solely. Taking
into account other hidden charges may persuade an individual to go the
PEPs road.
David Noblett, a director with Aitchison and Colegrave, warned: ''Do
not let the tax tail wag the dog.'' Said on many occasions over the
years, letting this happen has perhaps been instrumental in taking
decisions related to whether tax benefits attached to personal pensions
outweigh the flexibility of investing in PEPs.
''Yes, both forms of investments enjoy tax-free growth but the main
difference is how and when the benefits may be taken by the investor,''
he said.
It was true that personal pensions had an initial tax advantage, in
that tax relief, to certain limits, was available on the contributions;
with waiver of contributions able to be incorporated to ensure that in
the event of incapacity, at least the pension contributions would
continue to be paid up until selected retirement.
''The price to pay for the tax benefits is perhaps the loss of
flexibility, to control how and when benefits may be taken,'' Mr Noblett
added, although proposed changes in the Budget will allow personal
pensions some additional flexibility.
Suffice to say that where possible, advantage should be taken of both
personal pensions and PEPs with a view to achieving a balanced
portfolio.
In cases where a decision has to be taken on one or the other, then
the fundamentals to consider are tax rates, access to capital and the
length of time to planned retirement.
It appears that in terms of flexibility PEPs have the edge.

FEW of us, when young, do not toy with the idea of becoming an Olympic
champion. During the winter months, perhaps enjoying an extra hour in
bed, it is interesting to consider which sport to choose. Many of them,
like running and jumping, or throwing things, do seem to involve a great
deal of physical effort. Also, what with television cameras everywhere,
there is the risk of dropping a baton, or being trodden on by other
athletes, and suffering public embarrassment. Other sports, like
wrestling and boxing, seem to be unnecessarily combative and have an
obvious risk of pain and disfigurement. Equestrian events are also
dangerous, and buying a suitable horse might be expensive, even a
second-hand one. Yachting is a possibility. When the Olympics are all
over, we think, we could use the boat to go camping.
By this time, alas, we have dozed off again, and it is not long before
another four years have passed. In no time at all, it seems, the
opportunity has passed. We are too old. ''There was a time when I nearly
took up pistol shooting quite seriously,'' we say. ''The Olympics, you
know. But it wasn't to be.'' Indeed not. We did not even buy a gun. Even
for casual conversation, however, the choice of sport has to be careful.
At the Commonwealth Games at Edinburgh in 1970, William Pattimore was
bowling for Wales at the age of 78, and Hilda Johnstone was a British
dressage Olympian when she was 70.
For would-be sportsmen who like to dream of a really geriatric gold
medal, there is fresh hope with the news that the World Bridge
Federation has applied for Olympic recognition. A minimum period of
seven years now has to elapse, but if the International Olympic
Committee agrees, there could be medal ceremonies for bridge players by
the 2004 games, possibly to be held in China. By that time Omar Sharif,
one of the world's leading players, will still only be 73. It seems a
long way to go for a game of cards. It is also a long time to wait for a
medal, although this is less of a problem. First we must learn how to
play.

A DISTINGUISHED American historian wrote that poverty was an idea
which had to be invented. Until it was, towards the end of the last
century, little attention was focused on it and few steps were taken to
combat it by collective provision. Its direct alleviation had, however,
attracted some collective effort since the 1830s. More direct public
focus followed later using, first, the agency of the state education
system and then the more direct instruments of national insurance, from
1911, and unemployment benefit, from the 1920s. These efforts stemmed
partly from the social investigations of late Victorian and Edwardian
reformers. (Joseph Rowntree, whose trust provided the impetus and
finance for this week's study, was one of these pioneers.) The reformers
called into being a concerned public opinion which began to challenge
the existence of a distinct social blight. That the phenomenon was
relative as well as absolute was a later development of which there was
little awareness before W G Runciman published his influential Relative
Deprivation and Social Justice at the end of the 1950s. Since then the
concepts of absolute and relative poverty have tended to fuse. The first
can theoretically be eliminated, but the second has a dynamic quality
since its definition is, usually, directly related to average earnings
which have tended to rise annually, as have most state benefits, since
1945 -- although they have sometimes been eroded savagely by inflation.
Social welfare is the biggest single item in the state budget,
especially when its elements in health and educational spending are
remembered. The Shadow Chancellor admitted in a speech yesterday that
this route to poverty's amelioration would not eliminate it. Indeed more
generous state provision exacerbates some related problems, such as the
''poverty trap'' whereby benefits reduce the incentive to seek
employment because their withdrawal in the face of earnings produces a
clawback equal to as much as an 80% marginal tax rate. That is not
tolerable, but it is easier to say that than devise workable methods for
avoiding it. Liberal notions of a negative income tax need more
consideration, though many have become pessimistic about them. Minimum
wage legislation might deal with part of the problem, low earnings,
though US experience shows that poverty persists alongside minimum
wages.
What Rowntree's own first investigations show is the importance of
earnings and hence employment. The present position is greatly worsened
by mass unemployment. This is now falling fast from very high levels,
but it seems likely to bottom at levels which would have been
unthinkable a generation ago. Job creation remains the best way to
tackle basic poverty. Training and skill provision gets everyone's vote
as well, though enhanced productivity is the target there. The
trickle-down theory may not have worked, but it should be made to work
-- and fiscal instruments are needed to make it do so. Inequality is not
so easily modified unless taxation is, again, to be exploited for social
engineering. It seems to be the case that additional marginal taxation
delivers little additional revenue; but it might reduce the popular
sense of outrage that excessive salaries have stimulated.
Are there votes in this, or will the affluent majority ignore what is
an affront to social cohesion as well as compassion? The price of
ignoring the poor is to leave them isolated, bewildered, resentful, and
violent; but it is also to diminish everyone else. ''Brothers one of
another'' is a biblical sentiment; it remains the right guide for
inspiring action on this front.

UNTIL last August, the two Craigs, Craig Brown and Craig Smith, were
senior surveyors in one of the larger Scottish firms of property
consultants. They had started within two months of each other and had
both clocked up their first five years with the firm.
While technically senior surveyors, neither man remembers the last
time he did a straight property survey. Craig Brown trained at Glasgow
School of Art in planning and design. Craig Smith had worked for a
period with an architectural practice. Both men specialised in designing
refurbishments of existing buildings.
On August 12, in quick succession, they were sacked, following
conflicts with new senior staff who had moved into the firm. ''It was,''
says Smith, ''a real kick in the backside. Losing the company car was
like having your leg sawn off. But it was also the best thing that ever
happened to us.''
Like many of their contemporaries grappling with the enterprise
culture, the pair had been contemplating setting up their own business.
Now that dream had a much more imperative tinge to it. Within weeks, and
with a little help from Glasgow Opportunities, the Greystone Partnership
was born. The first word in their new name, they confide with
mischievous smiles, came from a linoleum sample lying on one of their
desks.
Setting up a vehicle is one thing. Drumming up custom, as many a
fledgling start-up will tell you, is quite another, even in a people
business such as property. But Greystone was only two days old when they
took a call from a well-known English project management firm about a
major contract refurbishing government buildings in Whitehall.
Brown and Smith focus on the common areas of office blocks, the
lobbies, stairs, lifts, toilets and other parts which remain the
responsibility of the landlord. ''A lot of designs for these areas are
very simplistic,'' says Smith. ''We recognise all the problems of
functionality and maintenance. But we also like to take the time to add
a wee bit of magic to our designs, the distinctive details that get them
noticed.''
''The contact about the Whitehall contract,'' adds Brown, ''was made
on the basis of the quality of other work we had done, on our
reputation.'' In fact, the person who had suggested them for the task
was someone Smith had once done battle with it. But that hadn't blinded
him to the pair's flair.
The upshot has been that since October, Smith and Brown have been
taking turns to spend two weeks at a time in London, supervising the
translation of their designs into finished reality by contractors.
''It's a noticeably different marketplace,'' says Brown. ''In central
London just now there's scaffolding all over the place.''
Does that mean they are planning a permanent move south? Far from it.
They know the Glasgow property scene like the back of their hands and
have ambitious plans to expand. The obvious first step is to pick up
more contracts like the blue-chip assignment they are now well on the
way to completing.
The next move would be to expand from simply designing and project
managing refurbishment schemes in office blocks, to take on the main
contracting role themselves. ''That could happen quite quickly,'' says
Brown. ''We will target owners and managers of buildings with a complete
design and build concept for upgrading their common areas.''
The pair also want to get into leisure developments, which they see as
a prime target for expansion. Everyone has more leisure, argues Smith,
but there is still a great lack of facilities, particularly in the
middle market between local authority provision and luxury private
clubs.
Getting kicked out of a job is no fun. But with flair, reputation,
some sheer luck and a dash of enthusiasm, it need not be the end of the
world. Ask the two Craigs, Brown and Smith. ''A director of a surveying
firm in Glasgow can make so much money,'' reflects Brown, ''but being
your own boss, who knows what the limits are?''

February 4.
Your coverage of Greater Glasgow Health Board's purchasing intentions
for acute services, set out in the document Purchasing Acute Services to
2001: a Consultation Document, appears to have been very low key.
The proposed closure of Rutherglen Maternity Hospital, which serves a
catchment area of a quarter of a million people, would mean that
maternity services would be based at the Queen Mother's Hospital, the
Southern General Hospital, and a new unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
It would appear that the board's argument for closure is the saving of
#5m per year and that maternity hospitals should be located on site with
acute general hospitals. This would enable mothers who developed
complications post-delivery to have a full range of clinical supporting
facilities routinely found on such sites.
As far as I am aware, if such a situation arose, mothers in any of the
present maternity hospitals would need to be transported by ambulance to
an intensive therapy unit.
The closure of Rutherglen Maternity would affect the lives of
thousands of people across the south-east of Glasgow and East Kilbride
who campaigned more than 15 years ago for a local maternity hospital.
Women and their families will be expected to travel to the Southern
General or the Queen Mother's hospitals, or to the Royal Infirmary,
causing financial hardship and discomfort travelling on public
transport, time wasted travelling across the city on congested roads,
increased stress levels when a parking space cannot be found.
Rutherglen Maternity has proved to be an asset to the community with a
record equal to any. My personal experience is of a very dedicated
staff. X-ray and physiotherapy facilities are available for use by local
people through GP referral.
I see from your reports that public opinion saved the accident and
emergency services at Ayr Hospital. Hopefully the GGHB will take
cognisance of public opinion against the closure of Rutherglen
Maternity, good sense will prevail and confidence in the drcision-makers
at the GGHB will be restored.

LLOYDS Bank has again underlined that it is the most dependable of the
British banks with 1994 pre-tax profits rising 26% to #1304m accompanied
by a 17% increase in the dividend total to 25.8p.
That means that in the last decade #100 invested in Lloyds shares as
from the beginning of 1985 would have seen a total return of #565.50,
made up of #137.50 of net dividends and a capital gain of #428 in
addition to the original stake.
Other banks such as Barclays will show more dramatic profit
improvements over the next few weeks but from a much lower base and they
have all asked shareholders for funds through rights issues and so
provided a negative income flow.
Chairman Sir Robin Ibbs was happy to sound off that people do not
understand bank profits and that while they may seem large, the return
on assets is below that of most other industries. He denied that Lloyds
is exploiting personal customers and small businesses and in fact had
reduced many charges. What the banks need to do is to sustain profits
over a period as investors are spurning the sector at present, he added.
But Sir Robin, and his peers, have a major problem.
Investor perception of banks is that the quality of earnings is low
and volatile and there is always the apparent risk that whenever lending
demand does pick up, money will be poured into high-risk sectors such as
property. The banks have done it in the past, time and time again, and
why should the pattern change even if the banks argue that their credit
assessment now takes account of inflation being unlikely to come to the
rescue as has been the case since 1945.
There was some encouragement yesterday that the merger with the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society will still leave Lloyds well
heeled despite disbursing #1800m this August. The House of Commons has
now passed the ''widows'' bill which will now entitle 5000 widows and
widowers of first-named C&amp;G account holders to benefit from the merger.
The most buoyant part of Lloyds' UK business was mortgage lending
which rose 21% to #1700m to leave the book at #7200m compared with C&amp;G's
42% advance in loans to #3075m. Although personal and small business
lending appears to be picking up, it still remains disturbingly flat as
does commercial business where margins on large corporate loans in
particular are paper thin.
The impetus came partly from an improvement in the bad-debt
provisioning where there was a #99m reduction in the UK activities to
#325m. Chief executive Sir Brian Pitman expressed concern over the high
levels of provisioning still required on tertiary property where there
are no buyers for miles around and the only value is probably that of
the site.
The preceding year also carried some #70m of general provisioning,
while 1994 benefited from a #30m profit on the part sale of the holding
of 3i. There was also an extra #60m put aside against the problems at
Lloyds Abbey Life on the mis-selling of pensions.
UK net interest margins widened slightly from 3.87% to 4% because of
an increase in spread. Rising interest-free accounts and average base
rates in 1995 probably exceeding those of last year -- Lloyds is not
quite as anxious as the TSB to persuade customers to move to
higher-yielding accounts -- should help to improve overall UK margins
for the current year.
Lloyds was pummelled hard five years ago by its problems with
developing country debt. But now it is in the happy position that most
countries in its portfolio have so improved that it is able yet again to
write back some of these debts with an additional #68m going into
profits at #328m or a quarter of the total.
However, that does not speak too highly of the quality of future
earnings even if Mexico has had little impact on Lloyds where the major
exposures are to Brazil where there is a new president and Argentina
where elections are due in May and bankers to a man are hoping that
stability is maintained.
More negatively the increase in US interest rates hit bond-dealing
profits badly with the surplus falling from #204m to just #66m with a
mere #14m contribution in the second half of last year. And the
prospects this time round are again for a muted performance on this
score with global interest rates likely to rise further and so hitting
fixed interest stocks.
The C&amp;G acquisition does underpin earnings quality and should help
Lloyds' current year profits advance to about #1650m.
The shares now yield 5.75% at 560p and are about the highest in the
sector.

INVESTMENT trust PEPs have rapidly assumed the position as the
cheapest personal equity plan on the market.
Charges tend to be lower than unit trusts and here the reasons can be
viewed as partly historical.
Investment trusts often tend to be bigger -- take the Stewart Ivory
Saints scheme for example, which has been investing internationally
since 1873. Today it is valued at almost #500,000,000 and has more than
23,000 private investors, 5000 of them PEP holders.
There has in fact been a remarkable revival in the investment trust
industry in recent years, primarily following the 1991 Budget when
investors were, for the first time, entitled to invest their entire PEP
contribution in a collective fund.
Investment trusts continue to be far more sophisticated investment
vehicles than their unit trust counterparts and for this reason are
perhaps less well understood by professionals and their private clients
alike.
This reflected in the ratio of 16:1 of unit trust PEPs versus
investment trust PEPs.
David Hume, director with Stewart Ivory, said: ''When an investment
trust is being managed a certainty is involved and, unless it is taken
over, a very big pool of assets is involved -- unlike unit trusts.
''So, from a management point of view a unit trust uncertainty is
reflected in management charges and to the detriment of the investor.''
By comparison, investment trusts enjoy longer term benefits, are
bigger in size and offer more security for the PEP holder.
Brian Allison, investment services director with Aitchison and
Colegrave (pictured left) says that in a bid to win back market share,
investment trust companies have pitched their initial set-up PEP charges
well below those charged by unit trust companies.
Sums of #30 to #50 and indeed no initial charges are quite common and
annual management charges above 1% are now rare.
''There may however be hidden charges to consider,'' he warned. ''Such
as high dealing charges on the underlying investments chosen.'' This is
particularly relevant for regular investment investors and also when
selling or switching shares.
Some of the larger unit trust companies are currently fighting back
with no front end charges and more recently ''loyalty'' or renewal fees
paid to Independent Financial Advisers (IFAs) have been introduced.
However, there is no longer a level playing field betwen unit and
investment trusts, and while charges have to be taken into account, the
acid test of any investment is its performance. Above average returns
from the better performing investments should erode any concerns over
charges.
There seems little doubt that an investment trust PEP engenders more
of a certainty in the mind of the investor.

FARMERS have been enjoying a holiday in terms of fertiliser prices
over the past few years, but this is coming to an end, according to the
Fertiliser Manufacturers Association.
Prices slumped by 25% in the decade to last year, but are now showing
a strong recovery, with a #5 per tonne increase in the past three
months.
The world price of nitrogen has escalated in recent months, and
ammonia -- a key component of fertilisers -- has doubled in price in the
past year, with urea not far behind.
This has resulted from two competing trends. Firstly, a rise in world
demand -- particularly from the Far East -- and secondly,
rationalisation of European plant, resulting in a loss of some
10,000,000 tonnes production capacity annually. To put this in
perspective, total UK demand is about 5,500,000 tonnes.
According to Mr Barry Higgs, director general of the association, this
has been aggravated by two further events -- moves by former Soviets to
start charging for gas at real commercial rates, and increased demand
from US farmers to replace fertilisers leached out by recent floods.
''There is no doubt that farmers have been on a bit of a holiday as
far as fertiliser prices are concerned. But clearly they are going to
have to come back to reality,'' he said.
The fight by the association to end fertiliser dumping has had little
impact on the upward trend, as imports from both alleged dumpers and
non-dumpers have continued to operate at previous levels.
''The end result is that we have already passed the bottom of the
supply-demand cycle,'' said Mr Higgs.
Mr Dick Davies, commercial manager of Kemira, agrees. ''We have seen a
lot of price increases coming through, and the price of the end product
is about #15 per tonne up on the year. We issued new prices around #130
a tonne for straight fertiliser two weeks ago.''
Growth in markets in both the Far East and South America have boosted
demand against a contracting manufacturing base. This, and tight margins
all round, have axed stocks at factories from a month's market supply to
about one week.
Ms Rosie Carne, marketing services manager with world leader Hydro
Agriculture, said the company had stopped taking orders for NPK
fertilisers for the current season, although the Immingham plant on
Humberside was still producing about 2000 tonnes a day straights.

TEENAGE entrepreneurs at St Andrew's Academy in Paisley are selling
boxes of fresh air. The school's Young Enterprise company, Beezer, has
packaged the air as a Valentine's Day gift.
Beezer marketing director 17-year-old Pauline Graham says the
attraction is the novelty value of the colourfully wrapped box, and the
message which reads:
This is a very special gift that you can never see.
The reason it's so special is it's just to you from me.
Whenever you are lonely, or ever feeling blue,
You only have to hold this gift and know I think of you.
You never can unwrap it, please leave the ribbon tied.
Just hold this box close to your heart, it's filled with love inside.
I just hope that the recipients take time to read the message,
otherwise the givers might find themselves the targets of some hot air!
Glasgow gets set
for congress
DAVID Oji, president of the Junior Chamber International, flies into
Glasgow today to have a first-hand look at the facilities being provided
for the Junior Chamber's World Congress being held in the city from
November 4-11.
Around 4500 delegates from 80 countries are expected to attend, and
already 2000 rooms have been booked by the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board
and Convention Bureau, which is acting as accommodation agent for the
event.
During his visit, Mr Oji, who runs a restaurant and retail/wholesale
clothing business in Yokohama, will be popping into tailor A Crawford &amp;
Sons to be measured for a tartan jacket so he looks the part when
chairing the congress.
He will also visit the Royal Concert Hall and the city's art
galleries.
The 50th Junior Chamber International World Congress will certainly be
a money spinner for many local businesses.
It has been estimated the delegates will spend in the region of #5m
during their stay in Scotland.
The largest delegation looks like being the 1200 Japanese members,
which should at least mean a booming trade in film for camera shops.
Having a ball
for a good cause
THE Marie Curie Daffodil Ball on March 11 is a sell out as far as the
#45 tickets are concerned. All 700 for the event to be held in the
Glasgow Hilton Hotel have been sold. Indeed, there is a waiting list of
100, but the charity has a shortfall in sponsorship.
It urgently needs sponsors to ensure the money raised from the ball
goes towards helping the cancer patients at Hunter's Hill Hospice in
Springburn, Glasgow.
If you would like details of the sponsorship package, give Maureen
Marshall a call on 0141 558 5442.
Atomic countdown
fails to add up
WHEN is a majority not a majority? Answer: when it is used in a press
release to show public support for atomic power.
A release from Scottish Nuclear crossed over my desk and I spotted the
headline: ''New Mori research reveals majority of Scots support nuclear
power''.
This fact certainly caught my attention, as no doubt it was meant to,
but as I glanced down I came to the crucial paragraph. It read:
''When asked: 'Should nuclear power continue to supply a proportion of
Scotland's electricity?' a total of 44% of Scots either agreed or
strongly agreed, compared to 33% who disagreed or strongly disagreed.
''Fifteen per cent remain to be convinced, neither agreeing nor
disagreeing, and the remaining 7% said they did not know.''
Maths was never my strong point, but even I know that 44% is not a
majority. It would have been more accurate to say more Scots support
nuclear power than are against it.
The release went on to state that the proportion of people in favour
of a continued role for nuclear power is even higher in the communities
which have become familiar with nuclear power stations, such as at
Torness in East Lothian and Hunterston in Ayrshire. There two residents
in three (65%) support the industry.
I could not help wondering when I read this information how many
people in these localities the industry supports, which may go some way
to explaining this higher than usual figure.
Personally, I am agnostic when it comes to the issue. I agree with
Scottish Nuclear's communications manager Irene Currie who commented:
''This new and independent research proves that people want the facts .
. .''
Anyone fancy a
trip to China?
THE Glasgow Chamber of Commerce is still looking for at least three
companies to join it on a trade mission to China from April 30 to May
10.
Seven Scottish firms have already signed up for the visit, which will
be led by Geoff Runcie, chief executive of the chamber, but 10 are
required before it can receive Government financial support.
The mission will travel to Glasgow's twin city of Dalian in North-east
China as well as Beijing and Tjanjin.
So far the companies who have agreed to go cover a wide range of
activities from selling school blackboards to fish.
The chamber needs to find the three additional companies by the end of
this month to ensure the mission goes ahead.

SOLID gold performances by overseas PEPs, particularly within Europe,
means it can be worth asking your adviser or broker about a home and
away portfolio, spreading your investment(s) to take in this important
growth area when either taking our for the first time or extending your
personal equity plan.
It is not only Europe where PEP gains can be made because emerging
economies, in the Far East for example, can also prove worthy of
scrutiny, although it has to be remembered that the PEP investment limit
beyond Europe is #1500 -- making up a quarter of any portfolio.
Through a PEP it has been possible in any year to invest up to #6000
to acquire a selection of shares in a range of eligible investments --
in quoted UK or European Community companies; and with the benefit that
you do not pay income tax on either interest or dividends received
within the plan.
Neither do you pay capital gains tax on disposals within the plan or
on its encashment and investments may also be made in unit or investment
trusts in a general PEP, provided certain conditions are met.
Now, it is proposed for 1995/6 to widen general PEPs to a range of UK
corporate bonds and convertibles, plus UK and EC preference shares,
provided the investments are made in quoted companies.
It was three years ago exactly that Euro stocks were allowed to be
included in a PEP and evidence of the strength of including overseas
PEPs to build up a geographically-diversified portfolio is revealed in a
recent survey *, where the best performing unit trusts over the past
seven years, that now qualify for inclusion in a PEP, are mostly
European trusts.
Old Mutual which used to be called Providence Capitol, for example,
has been the top performer through delivery of the equivalent of 32% a
year over the past three years. This compares with its 20.5% a year
since 1987.
Meanwhile, Henderson's European trust ranks fifth over three years
with returns of 26.8% a year.
Top performer over the past seven years among unit trusts, which could
have been sheltered within a PEP, was Pembroke Growth, with returns
equivalent to 16.9% a year; with Newton Income at 16.88% coming next.
Among non-qualifying unit trusts, the top performer since 1987 is
Abtrust's Far East Emerging Economies, growing to well over #6m and
representing an annualised growth rate of a little over 30%.
One overseas trust worth an extra close look because of under
performance belongs ironically to Abtrust whose Japanese trust displayed
a growth of #1309.81p for an annualised rate of just short of 4%.
So, before attempting to achieve any positive home and away PEP
portfolio blend, one should follow the golden rule by consulting either
adviser or broker.

SIX quarries in Central Scotland are included in a package of 16 being
bought by George Wimpey from Alfred McAlpine for #43.5m.
Wimpey already has five quarries in the same area and others in the
Highlands and the group expects to achieve savings of some #1m from
rationalising administration and support services.
Finance director Richard Saville said there would be some job losses
among the 100 or so people employed by the Scottish McAlpine quarries in
these functions, but the number had not yet been determined. Production
staff will not be affected.
The purchase will place Wimpey in second place behind Tarmac in the
Scottish market for quarry products. The plants being acquired produce
limestone, sand and gravel. Also included are two stone-coating plants
in Scotland.
About a quarter of the output goes to roadbuilding, a quarter to
housebuilding and the balance to general contracting.
The 16 McAlpine quarries being acquired in total will add an aggregate
4,500,000 tonnes of dry stone to Wimpey Minerals' existing output of 12
million, placing it fifth in the national market. It will be number four
in coated stone. The other quarries are in Wales.
Wimpey chief executive Joe Dwyer said he was confident that the
acquisition would at least cover the interest and rationalisation costs
associated with the purchase.
In the year to October 1993, the McAlpine business made operating
profits of #1m on sales of #24m and is currently trading well in an
improved aggregate market.
McAlpine said it was selling because the business was small and
vulnerable to major changes in demand. The money will more than
eliminate group debt of #30m and the deal is expected to be earnings
neutral.
The group warned that its construction division was affected by poor
margins, with no improvement in its markets in sight. But housing is
performing better with results in the 14 months to December ahead of
budget, achieving 1828 completions at an average selling price of
#90,000. Slate products are trading strongly.
McAlpine shares rose 1p to 164p.

EUROTUNNEL has some relatively good news to report for a change to its
long-suffering shareholders who have seen the company's forecasts
progressively downgraded.
The group said yesterday that its 1994 revenue came to #30.6m, well
short of the #36m hoped for last October. But cash in hand was only #11m
adrift of the forecast in the May rights issue prospectus, against #50m
considered likely in October.
In fact, Eurotunnel believes the revenue forecast would have been at
least met but for a disagreement with British Rail and SNCF, the French
railways. They maintain they were not required to pay full charges for
using the tunnel before the commencement date of their second service in
November, which was the Eurostar passenger services to Paris and
Brussels.
The first service was freight, which begun in June and is now up to
the initial target of 1000 trucks a day. This dispute with the railways
is likely to be settled through arbitration.
In addition to the revenue figure stated, Eurotunnel also received
#10.6m of ''minimum usage'' charges, which are levied until such time as
the cumulative actual tolls exceed the sum of these monthly charges.
At the end of December the group had about #300m remaining from the
1994 rights issue and #697m available from the senior debt put in place
last May. This will start to be drawn down in the second quarter of
1995.
The latest revenue figure was only released to comply with the
requirements of the Paris Bourse and the full 1994 results will be
published in mid-April, when the group will have a clearer view of how
revenues from Eurostar and Le Shuttle services are building up.
Despite much reported teething troubles, Eurostar certainly pulled in
the passengers before Christmas but shortage of rolling stock meant that
it was limited to two trains a day. There was also limited supply of the
shuttle wagons used to transport cars so Le Shuttle started with lower
frequency than had been hoped.
These shortages will have a knock-on effect on the build up of traffic
and so 1995 revenues for Eurotunnel will be lower than the #513m
predicted in the prospectus of last May.
''Management's objective is that before the end of 1995 Le Shuttle
traffic should reach the monthly levels implied by the prospectus,'' the
group states.
Eurostar's traffic fell off to some extent after the Christmas period
as the number of trains increased and because of a delay in getting the
computer booking system fully up and running. Passengers have generally
been pleased with the service though there remains considerable
scepticism to be overcome.
It is also still not clear in many people's minds that there are two
distinct services, one the Eurostar passenger trains to Paris and
Brussels from London's Waterloo Station and the other the car shuttle
service between Folkestone and Calais.
The ferry companies have responded to Le Shuttle by mounting various
promotions and cut-price offers and the airlines are keeping a watchful
eye on how Eurostar develops. Any hopes there were that the tunnel
services would be able to charge a premium have long since evaporated.
They will clearly have to be fully competitive with the airlines and
ferries. Eurotunnel's fixed costs are high, particularly the interest in
its huge borrowings, and once these are covered revenue becomes pure
profit.
But faced with the greatly streamlined ferry operation at Dover,
Eurotunnel is going to have a fight on its hands to achieve its ambition
of securing half the cross-channel car traffic next year.
The shares at 298p, down 8p, have held on to the rally seen since the
October low but further progress will depend on how the revenue picture
develops.

* I have two endowment policies with well-known companies and am
concerned over the impact the pensions scandal will have on my future
bonuses, which are already coming down. Will the costs of correcting the
pensions mistakes be taken from funds which would otherwise have been
distributed to policyholders?
* The cost of correcting past errors by salesmen will be modest in
comparison with the size of the life funds of the major companies and
the flow of premiums into the fund. But it may still have some impact on
bonuses.
Strictly speaking, the cost relating to the proprietary companies, in
other words those owned by shareholders, will fall on the shareholders
as their funds have to be kept separate from policyholders' funds.
However, it could still indirectly result in them having to make some
reduction in bonuses. The mutual companies are owned by their
policyholders so the cost will have to come straight out of their life
funds.

SCHRODER Investment Management is launching an income and growth
investment trust. The starting yield will be 5% and the object will be
to achieve capital growth as a consequence of rising income.
Schroder's Clive Boothman says it is a particularly promising time for
investment, against a background of low inflation and continuing
recovery in corporate profits. Launch expenses will be capped at 4.5%
and there will be an annual management charge of 0.8%.
The new trust is fully PEPable, with an annual PEP charge of 0.5%.
* FINSBURY Asset Management is hoping to raise at least #25m from its
Worldwide Pharmaceutical investment trust which will specialise in
pharmaceutical stocks. It will be managed by Finsbury with advice from a
New York research house. The trust will not qualify for the full PEP
allowance.
* NATIONWIDE Building Society will start its ''mortgage sale'' on
Monday, offering its largest ever discounts on selected variable rate
loans.

AGRICULTURE Minister William Waldegrave has outlined his strategy for
promoting ''alternative'' crops. UK farmers had already shown a healthy
enthusiasm for trying out novel crops and novel markets, he said.
''The possibilities are many. Crops are a renewable source of a wide
variety of raw materials, with potential for industries as diverse as
paints and plastics, textiles and toiletries.
Thanks to research developments -- especially in biotechnology -- and
environmental pressures, agricultural raw materials are demonstrating
advantages which make them increasingly worth considering.
There is little point in encouraging them, of course, if they are
never going to be viable without subsidy, but I do not rule out help to
get markets established.
''We are putting more money into oils, fibres, and energy crops. We
are working to achieve the most effective and co-ordinated targeting of
public sector funded research on alternative crops.''
Mr Waldegrave said that novel crops were one possible use for
set-aside land but, he warned, set-aside would not last for ever. ''I
want to see agriculture developing new markets with a sound economic
foundation and long-term prospects.''

THE Clinton White House has been an uncomfortable place since the
early days of his presidency. Everyone expected a new, youngish
President with a staff unaccustomed to running things in a presidential
way to make some mistakes in the early months. What has been unexpected
is the way in which the mistakes keep coming. The appalling results in
last year's elections can be seen as the inevitable result of President
Clinton's failure to come to grips with a number of important issues.
His cherished domestic policy frayed at the edges, and nowhere more
fatally than in the doomed attempt to pass sensible health care reform.
Lessons should have been learned but were not. As a result American
society is in some disarray, with old certainties breaking down under
renewed attack from the likes of Newt Gingrich. The passing this week of
Senator William Fulbright, that pillar of American liberalism, is
another reminder of changing times, but of more immediate concern to
President Clinton is the presidential election next year in which he is
already committed to stand for his party's nomination.
For all these reasons, and a good number more, this is not the time
for carelessness in the White House, yet still it happens. A case in
point is the bungled attempt to nominate a new surgeon general following
the last one's distressing habit of making embarrassing pronouncements.
Jocelyn Elders had to go, but not, surely, to be replaced by
obstetrician Henry Foster, who admits to performing abortions but cannot
remember how many. Pro-life groups are outraged and those in favour of
abortion are equally angered by President Clinton's waffling on the
subject.
The President cannot interview every candidate for a job personally,
or question him exhaustively on every source of potential embarrassment,
but a President can, and should, make sure that his staff are competent
to do this task for him. President Clinton has failed to do this and it
is a major failure in a modern presidency. On lesser subjects his
judgment is similarly suspect. His intervention in the six-month long US
baseball strike was intended as a demonstration of down-to-earth
presidential power. He convened a meeting, twisted arms in confident
expectation of success, and then was amazed when both players and club
owners simply ignored him. This may be no way to treat a President, but
then, some Presidents ask for it.

<RECORDNO>979910851</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FIFE market gardener and member of the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland has expressed unease at the most recent legislation on
trespass, which he described as ''the complete negation of any freedom
of access to any part of the Scottish landscape''.
Mr Eric Neil of Kinghorn in Fife, said that according to information
issued by the NFUS, it was now possible for a landowner to use force to
evict a walker.
''Undoubtedly, an aggressive employee could read this and feel free to
abuse, verbally or physically, anyone he met on the property,'' he said.
''An aggressive employee reading this advice would feel perfectly safe
in throwing his weight about.''
In an attempt to raise public awareness of the issues involved, Mr
Neil has written to local MPs in Fife and also to countryside groups.
His concern stemmed from two factors, he explained.
As a Quaker, he subscribed to the view that the land was God's and an
owner had only temporary access to it. ''It is our job to leave it
better than we found it,'' he said. Mr Neil is also a keen hillwalker,
but said he has had only a few problems about being turned away.
''I am of Canadian extraction and the trespass laws over there are
much stricter than here. That is why I feel so strongly about it,'' he
said. ''I am one of those people who has been converted, I am now more
Scottish than the Scots, and I have taken this matter up with the
executive of the Scottish National Party.''
Mr Neil said that the whole tenor of the legislation made it clear
that citizens were no longer free to enjoy the countryside in their own
land.
''I could, in theory, be stopped on any hillside by a person
purporting to be a representative of the landlord and ordered to leave.
If I demurred, I could be taken off by the scruff of the neck. I would
not be able to prove this was utterly unnecessary. What is 'reasonable
force'?
''I was aware that our rights to enjoy our countryside were under
threat. I was not aware that they were being removed in a draconian
way.''
The NFUS advice note on trespass deals mainly with the Criminal
Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which, it says, adds another dimension
to the criminal law of Scotland in relation to trespass.
It goes on to say that the term ''trespass'' is one which has not been
defined by the Scottish courts.
For what might be termed ''simple'' trespass -- being somewhere
without doing any damage and without using violence or having criminal
intent -- it suggests that a landowner would require to look to the
civil law for a remedy.
The note goes on to say that an owner has certain rights to require a
trespasser to leave, and if the trespass is accompanied by violence or
destruction, the landowner may use sufficient force as is reasonably
necessary.

NORTHERN Electric overstepped the mark in one of its comments about
Trafalgar House in its defence document attacking the #1200m bid, which
is becoming increasingly acrimonious, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
This is the opinion of the Takeover Panel which forced Northern into
making a clarification statement yesterday. Following a complaint from
Trafalgar, the Panel was concerned about Northern's statement that the
directors of ''financially-challenged'' Trafalgar should explain why
they had not made a statement that it was a ''going concern'' in the
last accounts.
In a terse statement yesterday Northern said it was not seeking to
suggest that Trafalgar directors were not able to make such a statement.
It noted the working capital statement in the listing particulars
accompanying Trafalgar's offer document that the accounts of the group
had been prepared on a going concern basis, on which the auditors'
report was unqualified.
The accountancy bodies issued a guidance note for directors last
November that they should make a ''going concern'' statement in company
accounts. This was after Trafalgar's year-end so its accounts did not
include such a statement.

SHARES in securities house S G Warburg plunged 25p to 726p after it
was revealed that another eight employees had left its equity capital
markets division to join the Morgan Grenfell subsidiary of Deutsche
Bank.
On Wednesday, Warburg said that Maurice Thompson and Michael Cohrs had
gone to Morgan Grenfell for a total of #7m between them over the next
two years. As this was not done solely for money, both men in any event
are earning already well over #1m a year, it was seen a body blow to an
investment house which has had more than its fair share of bad luck in
recent weeks.
This includes the abortive talks with Morgan Stanley for a merger
which would have given the highly-regarded American securities house in
the dominant position. But the failure of the talks could not hide that
Warburg has put itself up for sale and so is likely to unsettle some
corporate clients looking for long-term relationships.
Additionally, it has lost other senior people recently, while its
reputation was damaged by the failure to win Lasmo for its Enterprise
Oil client.

* I wish to transfer shares registered in my name to my wife. There
will, I hope, be no capital gains tax involved, but how is the amount of
stamp duty payable calculated, and where do you get the transfer form
stamped?
* Transferring shares to your wife does not involve a capital gains
tax liability, as the shares will be deemed to have been transferred at
a value which produces neither gain nor loss. You are entitled to add
the appropriate indexation allowance to the cost of your shares, and it
is that increased value that your wife will take as her tax cost.
On any subsequent disposal by her, further indexation is due from the
date of transfer to the date of sale. In the meantime, you should
include details of the transfer when completing your annual tax return.
There is no stamp duty payable on the shares being gifted to your
wife. It is sufficient for you to complete the appropriate sections of
the stock transfer forms which should be signed by both of you. These
should then be sent to the company registrars.
* I have inherited about #85,000, mainly in cash, though there are a
couple of small shareholdings in BT and Royal Bank of Scotland. I would
welcome your advice on how to make the best use of this money.
I am 53, and hope to be able to carry on working until I am 65 when I
would be entitled to a maximum two-thirds of salary pension. My mortgage
will be paid off in two years with possibly a small surplus from my
endowment policy.
At this stage I do not need any income from my capital, which I would
like to grow for me between now and my retirement. A family friend who
is in the insurance business has recommended that I invest #25,000 in
each of three distribution bonds, and deposit the remaining #10,000 in a
high income account with a building society in my wife's name as she has
no taxable income of her own.
Is this a good approach or would I be better trying something else?
From my own resources I have built up a portfolio of half-a-dozen unit
trusts, worth about #17,000 at last count, and also have the maximum in
an Abbey National Tessa account.
* Insurance bonds are widely recommended to investors who would often
be better served by other vehicles. Such bonds have a poorer record than
either unit or investment trusts. When an investor is seeking capital
growth it is doubly inappropriate to put money into distribution bonds,
which are designed to provide income.
Moreover, it makes no sense at all to invest capital in lumps as large
as #25,000, given the funds, totalling around #110,000, that you have at
your disposal. A much wider spread is desirable.
We would strongly advise you to reject the advice of your family
friend, and seek an independent opinion.
Capital growth is most likely to result from long-term investment in
equity-type investments, such as company shares like your BT and Royal
Bank of Scotland holdings, or through investment and unit trusts, which
themselves have their own equity portfolios.
In your case, you have more than enough time between now and your
expected retirement date for such investments to fructify and provide
you with a valuable nest egg from which you can start to take an income
when you are no longer working.
Between your inheritance and your own savings, you have sufficient
capital to fund a portfolio of your own. This could include your unit
trust holdings and some investment trusts, but there is also plenty of
scope for further investment in conventional shares. You have the
resources to give a decent spread across sectors.
Accordingly, we would advise you to consult a stockbroker. He or she
will review your existing investments and make fresh recommendations for
the additional capital. If you do not have the name of a suitable
broker, you can obtain a list of Scottish stockbrokers from the Stock
Exchange in Glasgow.
It is always wise to have some cash at your disposal. You should
certainly keep your Tessa going meantime, and perhaps go ahead with the
plan to put #10,000 cash on deposit in your wife's name.
It is worth bearing in mind, however, that a better return could be
obtained from Government stock than building society deposits, and your
wife would be able to reclaim the tax on the gilt dividends. This would
also be a matter for discussion with a stockbroker.
* I paid in advance for my gas and electricity to cover the period
April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1995 to save paying VAT at 8%. Is there a
loophole in the legislation to save me paying VAT in the following year?
* Unfortunately not. Any payments made subsequent to the imposition of
VAT attracted the tax. It might have been possible to avoid another
chunk of VAT if the rate was to be subsequently raised to the standard
17.5%, but the Government backed down on this in the face of the barrage
of criticism and the rate stays at 8%.
* I have held Tribune Investment Trust shares since the early
seventies and could check the movements in the investment trust column
in the newspaper share lists -- just a few items from the end. Now this
seems to have been taken up by ''Turkey''. Your comments on this change
would be appreciated.
* You don't need to worry, Tribune Investment Trust has not changed
from being an international trust to a narrow specialist concentrating
on the volatile Turkish stock market. It has merely changed its name to
Baring Tribune Investment Trust, to reflect the management stable it is
part of.
While not among the leaders, Baring Tribune has an average track
record within its peer group.
* We have recently retired early, myself aged 56 and my husband at 61.
I have a General Accident Kaleidoscope policy taken out in December
1988. The monthly premium is #120. It is 100% in General Accident's
managed fund and the life insurance benefit is #1200.
As at November 22 the surrender value was #8416, but this figure
cannot be guaranteed due to fluctuations in the stock market. I would
have hoped for a better return after six years. I can reduce the
premiums to #12 per month, and cash in the policy at the tenth
anniversary, or take the surrender value which does not equal the
payments made.
As our circumstances have changed it would require using savings to
meet the #120 per month payment and this seems unwise.
* This is indeed a disappointing surrender value. If you can, it would
be better to reduce the payment to the minimum and wait for the tenth
anniversary of the policy, when the payout should hopefully be not
unreasonable -- the track record of the fund is in line with the average
for its sector.
* I currently have money invested in a capital investment bond to the
sum of #18,000. In January 1994 the price was 174p. It is now 158p.
Would this money perform better in an investment trust?
* Given that over the past year the UK stock market, as measured by
the All-Share index, has fallen by 12%, then the 9% drop recorded by
your bond is not bad at all. The outlook for shares this year is more
positive, and there is no guarantee an investment trust would perform
better, so you should stick with your bond.
* My sister owns two properties and also has fairly substantial stock
exchange investments accumulated over a number of years. I am the sole
beneficiary of her estate and she has suggested that, as she is
terminally ill, she should gift the assets to me now to reduce the tax
which would eventually be payable on her estate. Can you confirm that
there are no disadvantages to this please?
* There is unlikely to be any tax benefit to be obtained by
transferring the assets now, as if your sister dies within three years
of making the gifts the inheritance tax liability on death would remain
unchanged. Although the gifts would be potentially exempt transfers,
these do not fall out of account until seven years from the date of
gift, although only a proportion of the full tax would be payable if
death occurs more than three years from the date of gift.
Your sister should, however, take advantage of the time remaining to
her in utilising her annual inheritance tax exemption of #3000. If she
has not already used the 1993/94 exemption, a total of #6000 could be
gifted before April 5, and a further #3000 on April 6.

MEMBERS of the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in Scotland
were unanimous in their condemnation of the mistreatment of animals
shown in the BBC television programme Frontline Scotland this week, the
institute president Willie Blair said yesterday.
''We understand the most serious incident, which did not involve
market staff, is in the hands of the procurator fiscal,'' he said. ''The
two minor incidents, in which market staff were involved, has resulted
in them being taken to task and warned as to their future conduct.
''The fact that it took several months of filming to collect this
small number of incidents in markets throughout Scotland -- which have a
total annual turnover of some four million sheep and 750,000 cattle --
confirms our strongly-held belief that such cases are isolated.''
Mr Blair said that SSPCA, environmental health and trading standards
personnel were in attendance at each sale, along with either veterinary
surgeons or technical officers from the Scottish Office agriculture
department. These agencies and the auction firms' own welfare officers
were always prepared to look into any incident brought to their notice.
''Notwithstanding the presence of these officials it is not physically
possible for them to be everywhere ensuring that each and every
regulation is followed to the letter. It is our firm belief that some
additional practical input into the framing of regulations is
required.''
''It is the aim of our members to prevent ill treatment of any animals
in our markets. Apart from the serious welfare implications, such
treatment would cause serious damage to the carcases of those going for
slaughter, with consequent financial penalties.''

FORMED under three years ago, the Amicable Smaller Enterprises trust
has since kept well ahead of its benchmark index in asset terms, though
both lost ground last year, writes COLIN McSEVENY.
The #55m investment trust, managed by Scottish Amicable, saw its net
asset value fall 3.3% to 137.9p in 1994 against a 7.0% drop in the
benchmark Hoare Govett specialist index.
Like most other trusts, gains made in last six months of 1993 were
wiped out by the turn in interest rate sentiment last February.
A final dividend of 1.4p is to be paid, making a total of 3.1p against
3.4p the previous year. Fully-diluted earnings per share dipped
marginally from 135.7p to 131.7p.
The dividend cut, anticipated in the interim statement, stemmed from
the company's decision to phase out the distribution of exceptional
revenue last year and also indicates a slight shift in investment
strategy.
''This policy places a greater emphasis on investment in quality
companies where yields are likely to be below average,'' chairman Hugh
Laughland said yesterday. ''The outlook for smaller companies remains
encouraging as they rebuild balance sheets and improve activity in line
with economic growth.''
In the period since the launch in March 1992, the trust has increased
its asset value by 44% compared with a 30.1% increase in the benchmark
index.

KINGFISHER has looked to the past for a saviour for its loss-making
electrical chain, Comet. Eddie Styring, who ran the business in the late
1980s, has been brought back to mastermind a recovery programme.
He will become chairman of Comet, working closely with an old
colleague, Brent Wilkinson, the company's managing director, who will
concentrate on day-to-day operations. The two worked together at Comet
between 1987 and 1989 during which time they doubled its profits,
admittedly in a much more buoyant retailing market.
Mr Styring left in 1989 to rescue a management buy-out and has since
advised a number of retailers. Now he will report to Kingfisher director
Philippe Frances, who runs the group's successful French electrical
retailer, Darty.
Other appointments include Martin Toogood who will move from being
retail director at Woolworth, responsible for property and store
operations, to head B&amp;Q Superstores, now a separate division of B&amp;Q.

A TEENAGER whose car collided with a lamp-post on the same day he
passed his driving test was disqualified from driving for a year and
ordered to resit the driving test at the end of his ban when he appeared
before Sheriff Rosie Morrison at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
Kenneth Duff, 19, of Hawkshead Crescent, Edinburgh had admitted
dangerous driving in Mortonhall, Edinburgh, on April 13 last year.

PRESIDENT Clinton has walked straight into the bear trap, which is
distressing to his friends, because he set it himself. He nominated a
new surgeon-general last Friday and it is already only too clear that he
will probably abandon the wretched man.
This would not have happened if the White House were smarter or better
organised or less obsessed with placating the various minorities who
voted Democratic in 1992. For White House, read Bill Clinton. For a
clever man, he can be very stupid.
Here's what happened. When he became President, he nominated Dr
Jocelyn Elders as surgeon-general. It used not to be a very notable
position. Its role is generally hortatory, the general urging people to
lead healthy lives, and lecturing to medical audiences.
It was a surgeon-general's report that first explicitly made the link
30 years ago between smoking and lung cancer, and ever after more
reports, on smoking and other matters, have been issued in a steady
stream over the current surgeon-general's name.
Then Ronald Reagan appointed Dr Everett Koop to the job, in 1981. He
was a distinguished paediatrician from Philadelphia, and he turned out
to have an amazing flair for publicity. He launched a full-scale attack
on smoking, and achieved astonishing results.
It is largely because of Dr Koop that smokers now lead harassed and
unhappy lives in the United States.
His successor, under President Bush, was less militant, and Mr Clinton
decided to find a successor on the Koop model. Dr Elders, who is black,
was even more outspoken than Dr Koop. Unfortunately, a lot of what she
said was deeply controversial, and sometimes silly. She caused Mr
Clinton much embarrassment and was finally told to shut up.
Last December, ignoring the order, she told a group of specialists in
sex education: ''With regard to masturbation, I think that is something
that is part of human sexuality that perhaps should be taught.'' She
went on to say that schoolchildren knew far too little about
masturbation and that their ignorance should be corrected.
So Mr Clinton fired her. That upset black Americans, who were already
doubtful about the President's commitment to racial equality. So he
decided that he needed a black candidate to replace Dr Elders.
The President told his staff to find a black doctor who could easily
be confirmed. They came across Dr Henry Foster, an
obstetrician-gynaecologist from Tennessee who had made a name for
himself encouraging teenagers to practise abstinence as the best way to
avoid getting pregnant.
Splendid, said the White House. Just the man to sail through the
Senate. They missed the line on his curriculum vitae stating that he was
on the board of Planned Parenthood in Tennessee (the organisation
recommends women on birth control and runs abortion clinics). They also
neglected to ask him whether he had ever performed abortions. Perhaps
they didn't know what obstetricians- gynaecologists do for a living.
At the last moment, the day before Dr Foster's nomination was to be
announced, some flunky called him and asked: ''By the way, have you ever
performed an abortion?'' He said yes, at least one he remembered,
perhaps more.
The announcement went ahead in the White House, and the spin doctors
made sure the first news stories were favourable. But medical reporters,
not to mention anti-abortion activists, noted the reference to Planned
Parenthood and the doctor's specialty, and demanded a more precise
answer.
This time the doctor said he had performed no more than a dozen
therapeutic abortions. The White House apologised for saying the number
was one. Then they had a look at his medical records, and on Wednesday
night Dr Foster was on television admitting 39 abortions.
Now he looks a liar, which is probably unfair (the operations were
spread over 20 years, and he wasn't counting). But the White House had
to apologise again. Mr Clinton has appeared several times, offering
subdued support for the nominee.
His liberal critics are just as outraged as conservatives.
Abortion is legal in the United States, and, they say, the President
should have said that Dr Foster had been only doing his job, and offered
no apologies.
That, of course, would not help in the Senate, where the new
Republican majority is opposed to abortion and will not be able to
resist the opportunity to show up presidential ineptitude. Indeed,
anti-abortion activists are delighted.
They have been quiescent for the past few months, since their most
militant comrades-in-arms started murdering doctors and fire-bombing
clinics. Now they can return to the attack, even though the Republicans
wanted to avoid the fight, using the nomination of Dr Foster as the
occasion.
They could not get a ''right to life' amendment through Congress, but
they can defeat the good doctor. And Mr Clinton loses, whatever happens.
If he drops Dr Foster, allowing him to withdraw his nomination, he
looks a wimp. If he fights to the bitter end, and loses -- well, that's
a defeat. If, miraculously, he wins, there's no glory in getting a
surgeon-general confirmed and the very fact that a full-scale battle is
needed shows up his staff's, and his own, incompetence.
A year ago he fired his chief of staff, Mack McLarty, for a series of
disasters. He hired a new man, Leon Panetta, a former congressman wise
in the ways of Washington. Things have continued on their old path.
The President takes weeks to reach decisions, and then often bungles
them. What is more, he appears indecisive and weak. No-one is convinced
by his promises that he will stand by Dr Foster.
So there he is, in his own bear-trap. Serves him right.

JUST for once, let's get away from art and significance for five
minutes around here and sing the old school sports song of St Custard's
Academy: ho for fun and frolic, ho for sport and play!
You may have noticed, over four long years (longer for us, pal), that
boffo comedies seldom make it to the top of this column compared to,
say, searching investigations of the human condition (with subtitles)
that play for four days at the Glasgow Film Theatre; but that's not
because Couch Potato is any very profound sort of guy -- it's just that
good serious films are easier to make and therefore much commoner than
comedies that truly make you laugh your face off, the best of which
we've seen for years is the utterly pointless and simple-minded Caspar
Milquetoast/Walter Mitty laugh riot The Mask (rental, cert PG).
Although sold largely on the basis of the special effects that
transpire whenever put-upon nice-guy bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss (Jim
Carrey) dons an ancient Norse Hallowe'en visor that he hauls out of the
river while trying to rescue a drowning man who isn't there, the real
allure of this insufficiently admired time-passer lies in other
quarters: in the sparkling musical numbers a la Busby Berkeley, in its
high-camp showbiz dialogue, in its loving homage to the deranged 1940s
and 1950s cartoon comedies of Tex Avery, and most of all in its high
quotient of good old-fashioned Hollywood heart.
You just know that, when it comes time to sort out the bad guy (Peter
Greene) and get the girl (Cameron Diaz), our Stan'll be able to do it
without supernatural aid: because, you see, he was really a lovable and
feisty kind of guy all along -- only he didn't know it. Heard this one
before? Who cares?
Plot concerns a bank-robbery conspiracy in which Stan's alter-ego
heists the dough from under the noses of the black hats, and Stan gets
the blame from the cops, but don't let that detain you any longer than
it does anyone else involved; just enjoy The Mask's exhilarating leaps
of logic and action and its zestful atmosphere of cartoon fun. It's a
film to chase the Seasonal Affective Disorder winter blues away.
Aficionados of the talking animals without which no Road movie was
complete (remember the camel in Road To Morocco: ''this is the screwiest
movie I was ever in . . .'') will take at least a passing interest in
Pier Paolo Pasolini's gentle 1966 politico-religious parable Hawks And
Sparrows (retail, #15.99, cert PG), in which a talking Marxist crow
acompanies father-and-son pilgrims Toto and Ninetto Davoli on a
picaresque comic journey through Italy in the footsteps of St Francis of
Assisi.
Fairly plotless, but enlivened by a series of kindly comic vignettes
harking back to the Italian neo-realist style of films like Bicycle
Thieves, it's a film that leaves no great message behind except the
humane doubts of a recently ex-Marxist director struggling for a new
ideology. More importantly, it makes you smile, and it's got a great
soundtrack by Ennio Morricone -- what more do you want?
If you shed a furtive tear at the end of Aladdin as Robin Williams's
hepcat genie-with-attitude retired from the three-wishes racket and set
of on indefinite vacation, weep no more: he's back at work in Disney's
straight-to-video sequel The Return Of Jafar (retail, #14.99, cert U),
except that he sounds a bit different now, being viced by the presumably
cheaper Dan Castellanata, formerly the voice of Bart Simpson's dad
Homer.
You may remember that, in the original, the wicked vizier Jafar became
a genie himself and got locked up in the magic lamp, which was casually
hurled into the middle distance with a few words about him not getting
out again for anothr 10,000 years. Well, don't time fly . . . he's back
and he's mad, and Aladdin and his princess don't look a day older.
Though obviously a less expensive and ambitious film than Aladdin,
Return Of Jafar is no disgrace to its marvellous predecessor in terms of
storytelling and thrills, and, at a little more than its skimpy 66
minutes, might have done quite nicely in the cinema. Fill the magic
carpet full of gas and get ready for a charming and exciting factory
ride with the shade of old Uncle Walt at the controls.
And finally: the legendary (pity it wasn't mythical) Z-movie thrill
extravaganza Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes (1977, retail, #12.99, cert
PG) makes one of its rare appearances on public release. Sadly, it never
matches its flamboyant and energetic sleeve art: as Leslie Halliwell
said of another film, they ought to have put sprocket holes on the
publicity and thrown the movie away. Once seen, never (alas) forgotten.

STEEPED in blood, brimming with action, seething with lust, bursting
with beautiful women in low-cut bodices, and teeming with dashing
gallants, Patrice Chereau's La Reine Margot (18) takes one back to the
days when Bette Davis and Errol Flynn used to storm the screen in
costume dramas. She would be indescribably wicked in a farthingale or a
bustle, he would be gloriously debonair in tights or uniform. Maybe the
film is bad history, but it is glorious melodrama.
The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve in 1572 is one of the great and
dreadful events in French history. The country was split between
Catholics and Protestants, civil war had been raging, and to patch a
peace together a marriage was arranged between the Protestant Henry of
Navarre (Daniel Auteuil) and Marguerite de Valois (Isabelle Adjani),
sister of the weak and dissolute Catholic King Charles XI (Jean-Hughes
Anglade). Behind the machinations was his mother, the formidable
Catherine de Medici (Virna Lisi), scheming to ensure the permanence of
the House of Guise.
The wedding celebrated, Henry having renounced his religion, Catherine
decided to get rid of his Protestant supporters, and the massacre of the
Huguenots, who had come to Paris for the wedding, took place.
Chereau's spectacular film -- the lush photography is by Philippe
Rousselot who shot Interview with the Vampire -- is based on a novel by
Alexandre Dumas. It is about a fictional love affair between Margot and
a young Protestant nobleman, La Mole (Vincent Perez), who has come to
Paris for the wedding. The bride spurns her husband on their wedding
night, takes to the streets, and meets La Mole. It is lust and then love
at first sight.
But her future is uncertain. Her mother is plotting to replace the
king with one of his brothers, and her husband's life is in danger. As
well as the doomed romance with La Mole, the film also charts the
growing realisation by Marguerite that her fate is bound up with that of
her husband, and that they stand or fall together. Trust slowly grows as
these two royals, united for reasons of political expediency, realise
they have a common purpose -- survival.
Bad history? For a start the couple were in their late teens, a period
both Adjani and Auteuil have left long since. But they give true star
performances. That is to say he presents a convincing countryman
struggling to survive and at sea in a society he hates, while she does
what female stars worthy of the name do -- looks gorgeous and sexy and
wears her clothes with style. In addition the clothes are a good century
and a half out of date, chosen for their look rather than their period
accuracy. The film's best performance comes from Virna Lisi barnstorming
through a role Bette Davis would have killed for as a black-widow spider
whose machinations eventually go terribly wrong.
The film is richly cast -- Jean-Hughes Anglade's Charles XI is a
marvellous creation and gets to perform a truly amazing screen death
scene -- and while the plots and counterplots, the poisonings and
assassinations, and all those incestuous Guise relationships can be
confusing, La Reine Margot is one of those rare films to sit back and
wallow in. Ask not the reasons why, just enjoy.
This is French week with a vengeance. Luc Besson's Leon (18) is proof
that it is not just Quentin Tarantino who can make dazzling, empty, and
thoroughly entertaining films stuffed with violence. In this tale of a
hired killer he has resurrected a character who appeared briefly in one
of his previous hits, Nikita, about a female assassin, namely Victor the
Cleaner. Tarantino pinched him for the Harvey Keitel role in Pulp
Fiction. This time, called Leon, played as before by Jean Reno, an actor
with a wonderfully lugubrious manner, he is a hired assassin, a
dedicated loner, working in New York.
One day he meets Mathilda (Nathalie Portman), the little girl next
door, notices she has a bruise on her face, and sympathises with her.
Mathilda, a nymphette version of Nikita, is the daughter of a gross drug
dealer, who is murdered by his associates along with the rest of her
family while she is out getting some groceries. When she returns she
realises something is wrong and rings Leon's doorbell. He takes her in
and a strange friendship develops.
Portman, tough, funny, vulnerable, and old for her years, makes a
splendid foil for Reno's oddly beguiling assassin who charts his own
destruction as he helps her get revenge. Gary Oldman, as a pill-popping
killer with an affection for Beethoven and Armani suits, gives a truly
terrible furniture-chewing performance about which the less said the
better.
The new Star Trek film, Generations (PG), unites Captain Kirk, a
patently past-his-sell-by-date William Shatner, with his successor as
captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), in a very
complicated plot which is not really worth the bother of unravelling.
Why is it that nobody ever wears a seat-belt on the Enterprise because
the crew is always being hurtled to the floor or tossed up in the air by
violent jolts from alien weaponry or passing asteroids?
The film opens with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov going on a maiden voyage
by a newly commissioned Enterprise. It gets into trouble with a strange
belt of energy called a Nexus, and Kirk is killed saving the ship -- or
so it seems. He has been sucked into space through a hole in the hull.
On to Picard's Enterprise 78 years later: a mad scientist (Malcolm
McDowell) is putting a world at risk by trying to get into the Nexus, a
kind of Paradise Lost where people live the life they always dreamt of
living, having been plucked from it by Kirk all those years ago. Why
Picard and Kirk, who has, of course, ended up in the Nexus, can leave it
at will, but nobody can get into it without blowing up a harmless
planet, is anybody's guess, but in this sort of tosh it hardly matters.
The new Enterprise crew lack the truly awful bad-actor qualities which
so distinguished Kirk's crew, but Trekkies and fans of Shatner's famous
rugs, which is not the same thing, should be well pleased.
Jason Scott Lee, last seen baring his magnificent chest as an Easter
Island prince, repeats his performance as Mowgli, the lost boy brought
up in the Indian jungle by wolves, in the latest Disney action
adventure, Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (PG). Kipling must be
whirling in his grave at the liberties taken with his tale of the Raj,
but, provided your child cannot read, the film should do well enough as
a holiday treat.
Gary Sinyor's Solitaire for Two (15) deals with the bizarre love
affair between a behavioural psychologist (Mark Frankel) and Katie
(Amanda Pays), a paleontology lecturer at the Natural History Museum.
From the director of Leon the Pig Farmer, it is one of those
battle-of-the-sexes tales in which Rock Hudson and Doris Day used to
cavort, and passes the time agreeably.

A LACK of car parking at the foot of Ben Nevis could increase the
likelihood of climbers getting stranded on the mountain, Lochaber
Mountain Rescue Team warned yesterday.
The warning comes a week after the team helped find two students who
had been forced to spend 36 hours in a snow-hole on the ben.
In the past, the car park of Fort William Golf Club has provided a
convenient starting point for climbers. Ben Nevis Distillery land also
offered parking.
The arrangements for courtesy parking were informal, however, and no
agreement has been struck for this year. Highland Regional Council has
been asked to consider the problem.
The rescue team's secretary, Mr Miller Harris, said: ''Climbers
traditionally parked in the golf club grounds to gain access to the main
ascent routes of the north face of the ben. If they have to find other
places to leave their cars, this could add significantly to the time
they take to get to the slopes.''
He added that this could mean climbers being caught out by nightfall,
forcing them to stay on the mountain overnight.
0    Fort William mountain guide Tony Kimber said: ''It is well known
that early starts and early finishes decrease the likelihood of
mountaineering accidents.''

LAST week I spent a few days in Brussels, a city where the time is one
hour later than here, and every expatriate radio seems permanently tuned
to Radio 4 on long wave; so that every night just before midnight as I
was getting into bed, the little radio in my room would be churning out
the mellifluous voice of Ronald Pickup reading -- as Book at Bedtime's
contribution to Radio 4's current Romance Season -- a memoir called
Initials in the Heart, by a minor Englishman of letters called Laurence
Whistler. Every evening without fail Whis
tler's tale had me reduced, within minutes, to a state of quivering
irritation that the BBC should even think of squandering so much time
and talent on such a piece of self-indulgent waffle.
It's not that Initials in the Heart is offensive in itself. It's
simply the painstakingly detailed story of Whistler's feelings during
his romance with, and marriage to, his wife, set in various manor-houses
and cottages around the south of England during the Second World War,
and -- in the manner of that time and class -- shot through with the
idea that flesh and spirit are somehow separate, the one low and
degraded, the other exalted and fine; the kind of conventional
between-the-wars sensibility that makes you realise what D H Lawrence
was up against.
But what is astounding is the assumption that this insular little
fragment of experience is somehow powerful and normative enough to merit
a 10-part Book at Bedtime adaptation as a valuable insight into the
nature of romance. I haven't been so cross since the occasion when Radio
4 expected us to take an interest in the ramblings about her own private
life of a not-very-talented writer called Lisa St Aubin de Teran. If Ms
de Teran had been a typist called Lizzie Bloggs, and Mr Whistler a
bus-driver called Joe Spart, it would become obvious to everyone that
their self-asborbed musings are of very little interest indeed.
But all this is only to be expected, as Radio 4 faces increasing
pressure to ''niche'' itself as nostalgia therapy for the over-60s of
middle England; and the Romance Season -- heavily weighted towards the
Noel Coward end of things -- represents a standing temptation, since the
very concept of ''romance'' seems bound up with the taut emotional
atmosphere and exaggerated gender differences of wartime and the years
between the wars. Some producers, though, are trying to put a
contemporary spin on the subject; and among them is Radio Scotland's
Patrick Rayner, who directed last Tuesday's Thirty Minute Theatre, The
Upshot, by John Merryfield, and starring Gerda Stevenson and Paul Young.
But the trouble with this play -- about a chubby Edinburgh
thirty-something called Morna and her on-off romance with a shy elderly
divorce called Guy
-- was that it was even less like real life than Noel Coward's Private
Lives which at least has something to say about the elusive magic of
erotic attraction. In fact, it prompted me to gloomy musings on the
strange and implausible role in modern romantic writing of the
accidental pregnancy, an eventuality that has come, in the age of casual
sex, to replace the meeting of eyes across a crowded room as the
literary litmus-test of a relationship's predestined and romantic
character. In real life, people who get pregnant by accident usually do
so by someone they wish they had never met, never mind want to spend the
rest of their lives with. But try telling that to the New Romantics, for
whom chance fertility has become the touchstone of true love; if only,
alas, it were true.
Far be it from me, meanwhile, to agree with BBC boss John Birt about
anything much; but after a brief exposure to Radio 4's Today, I suspect
that he may have been right to point out that belligerence in
interviewing is not quite the same thing as tough questioning. The other
day, I heard John Humphrys interviewing the Unionist MP David Trimble
about the proposal that the Government should think about lifting the
Prevention of Terrorism Act. Humphrys was as rude as you please,
irritable and dismissive. But thrice Trimble said that the IRA ceasfire
was ''no reason for the British state to disarm''; and thrice Humphrys,
in mid-bluster, let this gross exaggeration of what was being proposed
go unchallenged, if not entirely unheard. To generate heat, in other
words is not always to generate light; and broadcasters should remember
that there are more ways than one of skinning a cat.
Laurence Whistler: not a bus-driver called Spart.

BUSTLE bustle bustle. As The Buccaneers bustle in, I slouch out; to
the sound of rustling silk and squeals of laughter. BBC1's voluptuous
new series is my cue for a career-change, but does it also signal a
policy-shift in the period-drama department? Edith Wharton may not be
George Eliot, but The Buccaneers shows little of the meticulous
integrity of the television Middlemarch. It has more in common with
Rodgers and Hammerstein.
Bless their beautiful hides, I can't tell the four young man-eaters
apart. They are all teeth, ringlets, and Wonderbra cleavage. It's not my
intention to spend much time on The Buccaneers, as this week's column is
a valediction to television (although not to Herald readers) and a dash
down the memory lane of 4895 viewing opportunities; but its opening
episode does recall, if not reflect, the values of the first
''blockbuster'' period drama series which came the way of the
newly-appointed critic. Which was . . .
Brideshead Revisited. When I started reviewing television, my
children, life was hard. To change channels you had to get up out of
your chair and cross the room to press a button. The video industry was
in its infancy. There were no satellite dishes, no cables, and only
three terrestrial channels. But British television made its own
entertainment, and it was often splendid. In the autumn of 1981, as I
settled into my new job, Granada unveiled the series which was to become
the touchstone of excellence for drama in the eighties.
It was much too early to start worrying about the future of television
broadcasting which, with the excitement of a fourth channel just a year
away, seemed confident and optimistic in its expansionist challenge. But
with the benefit of hindsight and the files I detect a hint of elegy in
my review of Brideshead Revisited, which stirred ''the dark old Scottish
worry that something so exquisitely, so effortlessly enjoyable must get
its comeuppance, and us with it''.
Not for a bit. The BBC also had a run of big-budget drama productions
which were popular and critical successes: Tenko (remember fierce, kind
Bea -- Stephanie Cole -- now reincarnated as Diana in Waiting for God?),
The Borgias, Edge of Darkness, Fortunes of War and, from BBC Scotland,
John Byrne's rock n' roll comic-strip masterpiece, Tutti-Frutti.
But after Granada trumped its own triumph with the even more majestic
The Jewel in the Crown, which took four years to make, 14 weeks to
transmit and cost #5 million, it was becoming clear that no single
broadcasting house could ever again afford to finance such ambitious
drama, and that its future lay in international co-production, with the
inevitable compromises.
The writers who dominated original television drama in the eighties
were Dennis Potter, for the feverish imagination of The Singing
Detective, and Alan Bleasdale and G F Newman for their social and
political critiques of Thatcher's Britain. Mrs Thatcher even had her own
show, ''the Thatcherite drama series'' Howard's Way, which with
immaculate timing and impeccable loyalty bowed out when she did, in
1990.
I spent a lot of time writing about Mrs Thatcher's television
appearances, which might have been masterminded by a subversive Ministry
for Fun. When the Conservatives replaced the Prime Minister television
lost a star whose thespian talent crossed the spectrum from low farce to
epic tragedy, but whose one-note rhetoric scarcely knew which was which.
For all that, the only interviewer who ever succeeded in rattling her
was an amateur: Mrs Diana Gould, who torpedoed her sang-froid over the
sinking of the Belgrano.
The Falklands War in 1982 was my first television war but it took
another nine years, and another war for British forces, to turn conflict
into infotainment. Armchair soldiers were mesmerised by the computer
games of the Gulf War strategists and television continued its process
of reporting each major world event -- the epoch-making summits of
Reagan and Gorbechev, the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, the
tumbling of the Berlin Wall -- as if it were staging a rather
serious-minded Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, like Jesus Christ Superstar
or Evita.
In the late eighties, facts became chiels held in thrall to the new
technology and its showbiz production values. To this critical viewer
this has been the most perceptible change in a period of great change
within the industry, much of it exciting, much of it meretricious.
The domestic landmarks are well-known: Channel 4, whose ''alternative
voice'' sinks to a whisper occasionally or becomes merely petulant, but
remains a force for innovation; breakfast television, which has been
handled with quiet competence over the years by the BBC and has been a
pig's breakfast on both commercial networks; daytime television, which
by definition never gets mass audiences or the most dedicated attention
of programme-makers.
And a number of foxes have caused havoc in the broadcasting henhouses
-- deregulation, cable and satellite, independent production quotas,
franchise auctions, Mr Birt's infamous ''producer choice''; all set
loose, broadly speaking, by the prevailing ideology of the Thatcher
years. Consumer choice is wider, the technology gets better and better,
there is ever more world-class sport available for those who like that
sort of thing, but television magic becomes more and more elusive.
Regularly throughout the eighties I would find gold dumped in the
corner of the sitting-room: a beautifully-crafted drama, an eloquent
documentary, an idiosyncratic interview, a sudden breathless advance in
the possibilities of global communication. A short nine years ago the
BBC made its first live satellite broadcast and we could still feel
wonder. ''We could look out of our windows,'' I wrote, ''and see the
same kind of clear blue weather they're having in China. And we could
look at our screens and see the Queen, 55 miles from Peking, stepping
smartly up the spine of the Great Wall.''
These wonders have become commonplace but they bring their own risks.
In his much-thumbed book, Amusing Ourselves to Death, Neil Postman has
criticised television for presenting everything from marketing to
politics to global news to religion to education in the same cultural
language which is used for game shows and soap operas, thus rendering
information ''simplistic, non-substantive, non-historical, and
non-contextual''. The cultural language, as I said earlier, increasingly
seems unable to distinguish between information and entertainment, which
must mean that we, too, find it harder and harder to make that
distinction.
But I don't take an apocalyptic view of the long-term consequences.
The human story has seen these confusions in other times, and survived
them. Samuel Pepys, a civilised man, took his wife and children on an
outing to an execution by hanging and disembowelling. My worries for
television are more concerned with its short-term domestic health. The
medium, like the nineties, shows nervousness, loss of touch, and a
failure to find those cornerstones of popular entertainment which make
you pine for autumn nights, like the seasonal dramas of a Tenko or even,
for heaven's sake, the slick, soapy contortions of quality escapism like
Dallas. And what kind of drama does Granada make these days? Stylish
slasher movies.
Clive James, gamekeeper turned poacher, remarked of his 10 years
before the box: ''I began with the suspicion, and ended with the
conviction, that popular entertainment is well worth doing.'' To that I
would add, ''and worth doing well''.
Some well-made popular fixtures endure: Coronation Street and its
nearest rival, EastEnders, about to celebrate its tenth birthday. The
British soaps show every sign of matching the record of The Archers, and
in time will see off the Australian ones.
As for me, as the images repeat themselves and the ideas are re-cycled
I find I'm beginning to repeat myself, too. So it's time to go -- with
few regrets but a lot of gratitude and affection for the eclectic,
electronic ''window on the world'' which has given me the chance, by its
very nature, to write about everything and anything. My thanks to all
you other viewers who have kept me on the qui vive with your own
critiques, as I hand you over to Ian Bell. He'll be a hard act to
precede.

A WOMAN told a murder trial yesterday that she saw a man being shot as
a group of men pursued two people said to be bank robbers.
Mrs Tracey Stewart, 27, said she saw Mr David Dunn approach a car. A
shot rang out and he staggered, then fell back.
Mrs Stewart, a housewife, of Eskdale Court, Bonnyrigg, was giving
evidence at the trial in the High Court in Edinburgh of Mr Robert Smith,
33, Mr Gerald McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland, 25.
They have denied murdering retired mining engineer Mr Dunn, 63, of
Dalhousie Drive, Bonnyrigg, by shooting him on the body in the Polton
Street car park, in Bonnyrigg, on October 19 last year.
They are also accused of robbing the Bank of Scotland branch in the
High Street of #185,000.
They have also denied attempting to murder police constable John Duffy
and two other men, Mr Duncan Milliken and Mr John Girdler.
Mrs Stewart said she had gone into the centre of Bonnyrigg that day
with her two young children and her sister to attend a health centre.
They parked in the Polton Street car park, and then heard shouting and
saw men run past them. They were shouting: ''Bastards, they have just
robbed the bank.''
A silver car arrived, and seemed to be revving quite a lot, but then
it stalled and stopped. A man wrestling with the driver succeeded in
getting him out.
Mrs Stewart said she heard the first of two shots as the driver's door
was opened and she thought it came from the front of the car. The second
shot rang out and Mr Dunn fell.
The trial before Lord Osborne continues.

THE woman who drew up bills at an Edinburgh law firm received a
written warning for altering an advocate's fee note.
Miss Elaine Houghton told Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday that her
boss, David Stevenson, now on trial for fraud, was not pleased when he
found out what she had done.
Miss Houghton said she didn't know what to do when Lothian Regional
Council's law department demanded to see the fee note so that they could
check the bill from Robin Thompson and Partners.
It turned out that the amount asked for by Robin Thompson and Partners
was more than the advocate had charged them in the first place,
according to the fee note.
She told the jury that her boss, David Stevenson, was not in the
office that day and she just changed the fee note.
''I don't know why I did it,'' she said.
Mr Stevenson, 43, and Mr Lawrence Lumsden, 38, whose addresses are
given as c/o Robin Thompson and Partners, Castle Street, Edinburgh, are
on trial charged with fraud.
They both deny overcharging other solicitors 13 times between December
1985 and May 1992 and gaining #2673.09 when recovering the expenses of
successful legal actions.
At the time, they were the partners responsible for costs and finance.
Miss Houghton said that after the incident and the written warning she
received a memo with instructions to change her billing system.
The amount stated on bills for advocates' fees was now to be the same
as that stated on the advocates' fee notes to Robin Thompson and
Partners.
The trial, before Sheriff Andrew Lothian, continues next week.

A DOCTOR gave a stark warning to young people considering taking
so-called leisure drugs like ecstasy: ''Do it and you risk losing your
life. It's like pointing a loaded revolver at your head and pulling the
trigger.''
Dr Leo Murray, accident and emergency consultant at Ayr Hospital, was
speaking on the fourth day of a fatal accident inquiry at Ayr Sheriff
Court into the deaths of Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock, Ayrshire,
and Mr Andrew Dick, 19, from Glasgow, on May 1 last year and of Mr
Andrew Stoddart, 20, from Rigside, Lanarkshire, on August 21.
All three died after taking ecstasy while attending the Hanger 13
nightclub in Ayr.
Dr Murray, 40, told of the efforts he and his colleagues made to save
the lives of John Nisbet and Andrew Dick, but said that Andrew Stoddart
was effectively dead when he reached the hospital.
The consultant said John Nisbet had a heart rate three times the
normal and was very hot. His pupils were dilated, indicating brain
malfunction.
''There was circumstantial evidence to suggest that he was ill because
of the effect of drugs . . . we contacted the toxins unit at Guy's
Hospital in London and they confirmed the treatment we had started as
intravenous fluids and the administration of a drug called Dantrolene,''
he added.
Dr Murray said he was still in the department when a second young man,
later identified as Andrew Dick, was brought in from Hanger 13. ''We
were prepared as the ambulance service had alerted us . . . his symptoms
were similar to the other young man.''
In the case of Andrew Stoddart, Dr Murray said there were no vital
signs when he arrived and he was declared dead at 1.20am.
Asked by Sheriff Neil Gow, QC, what he thought had caused the deaths,
Dr Murray said that, in all three, a condition known as disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC) had played a part.
He explained that the effect of drugs led to an inability of the body
to clot blood properly. ''In essence, after a while, the body becomes
wrecked as vital systems break down.''
Dr Boyd Meiklejohn, 39, consultant anaesthetist at Ayr Hospital, said
that John Nisbet and Andrew Dick were admitted to the high-dependency
unit and placed on ventilators. John Nisbet died at 11.30am on May 1 and
Andrew Dick died 12 hours later.
Consultant pathologist Dr Ruth Adamson carried out post-mortem
examinations on all three men and found the effects of DIC in all three.
She said John Nisbet had died of respiratory distress syndrome and both
Andrew Dick and Andrew Stoddart of pulmonary oedema, or the effect of
fluid in the lungs. In her opinion, all three deaths were as a result of
the toxic effect of drugs.
Mr Fraser McIntyre, 21, of Racecourse View, Ayr, said he was manager
of the Pavilion in which Hanger 13 is based and that, since the deaths,
paramedics, a standby ambulance, and closed-circuit surveillance had all
been introduced.
Asked by Mr Jack Drummond, representing the family of the late Andrew
Stoddart, if he thought it necessary to search staff before entering the
club, he replied: ''No, our selection procedures should ensure there are
no problems that way.''
The inquiry continues.

SCOTTISH Secretary Lang has upheld a planning appeal by Wimpey Homes,
and is allowing the firm to build 600 houses on green-belt land despite
local protests.
Strathclyde Regional Council and Labour-controlled Strathkelvin
District Council had rejected the plan because of fears of flooding, and
of overcrowding being caused in local schools.
Mr Gordon Sutherland, Strathkelvin's depute director of planning, said
yesterday that the council was considering whether to refer the matter
to the Court of Session.
''We don't consider that the Wimpey Homes application is in accord
with the local plan or structure plan,'' he said. ''It is also against,
in many respects, the wishes of a considerable number of objectors in
the area.''
Objectors claimed Mr Lang was ''under pressure'' to uphold the appeal
to build on 72-acres of former green-belt land near Westerhill Farm,
Bishopbriggs, because the developer had offered ''planning gain''.
This included building a #2.5m section of a by-pass, and providing
sites for a primary school, a light transport system, and community
facilities at Auchinairn Road.
The company also proposes to build 650 homes on an 80-acre site next
to the proposed development, inside the Glasgow boundary.
Fears had been expressed that the main by-pass, which it is hoped will
take traffic off the A803 through Bishopbriggs towards the M80 Stepps
by-pass, might be forced through despite a wave of local protest.
The concern is that Wester Cleddens Road, a proposed feeder route from
the by-pass, would effectively become the main ''rat run'' to
Bishopbriggs for drivers leaving the Glasgow and Stirling motorways. The
road at present serves five schools and a children's home.
Planners have already approved the south section of the road and an SL
Homes development of 1375 houses on a 168-acre site next to the proposed
Wimpey development inside the Glasgow boundary.
Mr Lang's approval is conditional upon a maximum of 200 houses being
built in advance of the operation of the relief road, and the
installation of drainage which meets the approval of the region.
Wimpey yesterday confirmed that it had agreed to provide sites for a
light transport system, retail shopping units, and a primary. However,
an education official said the prospect of the developer funding a new
school was not an option.
She said: ''We have put down a marker for extra Roman Catholic primary
school accommodation in Bishopbriggs if the housing development
proceeds.'' This would probably involve extending present facilities at
an existing school.
The cost of any extra school capacity would be met by the region or a
new unitary authority. The region is confident that sufficient future
capacity exists in secondary schools.
Mr Sam Galbraith, Labour MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, was
''outraged, but not surprised'' at Mr Lang's decision to uphold the
appeal.
He said: ''It amounts to another tragic erosion of the green belt
which are the lungs of communities. If we are not careful these
communities will merge and will lose their identities.''
Local regional councillor Tom Rae said: ''The decision amounts to the
Scottish Secretary taking planning decisions from local authorities and
placing them in the hands of the private sector.''
Mr David Hunter, secretary of the Bishopbriggs branch of the Scottish
Liberal Democrats, said that many residents thought Wimpey's offer to
build the by-pass should never have been allowed to be part of the
planning application. He argued that the area did not have the
infrastructure to support another large housing development and claimed
local schools were ''already bursting at the seams''.

THE FACTS OF LIFE: The Creation of Sexual Knowledge in Britain,
1650-1950
By Roy Porter and Lesley Hall
Yale, #19.95 (pp 415)
Just how do we learn about sex? As practice does not necessarily make
perfect, theory frequently attempts to fill in the gaps in our
knowledge. Fired up by Foucault's theory that theory determines the
facts of life, Roy Porter and Lesley Hall look at theories put forward
in popular sex guides in English since the seventeenth century.
This stimulating survey (''the book as we have conceived it'') takes a
long hard look at the father of all such sex manuals: Aristotle's
Master-Piece which first appeared in English in 1684 and was still
regarded as a handy book to have about the house when I was a growing
lad in Edinburgh.
Aristotle's Master-Piece was not by Aristotle but by various anonymous
hands though Porter and Hall say the medical populariser William Salmon
may ''have had some hand in it''. And the book was not considered a
masterpiece for long enough. D'Arcy Power, a surgeon, spoke for many
when in 1931 he savaged it as ''an hoary old debauchee acknowledged by
no-one''.
Porter and Hall, however, defend it as an intellectually impressive
and admirably didactic work. It relieved sexual stress by encouraging
couples to enjoy intercourse as a perfectly natural expression of
passionate love, advised them to ''make their mutual embraces most
effectual'', assured them sex was the nearest thing to heaven on earth.
Thus sex reared its lovely head in Aristotle's Master-Piece and in
such subsequent publications as James Graham's pamphlet, Lecture on the
Generation, Increase and Improvement of the Human Species (1780). An
Edinburgh physician, Graham believed sexual happiness was synonymous
with sanity, claiming: ''The genitals are the true pulse, and infallible
barometer of health.'' He advised others to practise what he preached in
the Celestial Bed he designed -- ''***it*** is 12ft long by 9ft wide,
supported by forty pillars of brilliant glass'' -- and rented out at a
rate of #50 per night. Since Graham attached magnets to his Celestial,
or Magnetico-electrico, Bed, the experience was supposed to be
positively electrifying.
But there was a negative side to Graham's search for sexual
perfection. By equating sexual athleticism with good health he ''sowed
the seeds of fear'', according to Porter and Hall. Poorly people,
including many poor folk who could not afford to stump up 50 nicker for
a night on the Celestial Bed, became increasingly convinced that illness
indicated some sexual flaws -- and faults -- in themselves. After all,
the great Graham warned that ''certain solitary practices or bad habits
. . . debilitate the bodies, and it is to be feared, damn the souls of
boys and girls, or of the young men and young women''. Such
scaremongering is one of the reasons Foucault held up two fingers to the
Enlightenment.
After Graham, who should be respected as an intelligent man with the
courage of his idiosyncratic convictions, came a deluge of books by men
determined to do dirt on sex. Ebenezer Sibly's Medical Mirror (1792)
suggested that sickly adolescent girls were sexually sick. William
Brodum's Guide to Old Age (1795) condemned ''excess of libidinous
indulgence'' in what he clearly saw as a dangerously permissive society.
Samuel Solomon's Guide to Health (1800) banged on about the medical
horrors that came to those ''addicted to Onanism''.
Sex was treated as a sin by quacks and, as Porter and Hall put it,
''Quackery helped contribute to the culture of sexuality, and indeed
sexology, by providing a lively focus for formulations on a subject upon
which regular biomedical science was sometimes unwilling to speak.'' And
quackery kept on rearing its ugly head. In a book, On Spermatorrhoea
(1872), John Laws Milton advised his readers to take action against
nocturnal emissions and masturbation by placing a spiked ring on the
penis or applying a device which answered an erection with an electrical
alarm. Many Victorian men were alarmed.
One Victorian man, who suffered from the ignorant assumptions of his
time, lived to tell the tale to Marie Stopes who is one of the most
attractive figures in this book. It is easy to poke fun at the
self-righteous Stopes, at least Muriel Spark found it easy when she made
a cruelly memorable gag about the birth-control pioneer in her
autobiography: ''I used to think it a pity that her mother rather than
she had not thought of birth control.'' Still, Stopes liberated men as
well as women in her classic Married Love (1918) which, like Aristotle's
Master-Piece, is still worth reading.
The Facts of Life is well worth reading. Scholarly in scope it is also
affirmative and, yes, exciting in its penetrating exploration of a
provocative subject.

OUR MAN IN . . .
By Clive Anderson
BBC publications, #16.99 (pp 240)
SOMEWHERE within the covers of this TV tie-in lurks the germ of an
idea for an important book and, things being what they are in the
wonderful world of the media, an even more important television series.
Beneath the glossy pictures, the limp gags, and the self-deprecatory
smugness that is Clive Anderson's speciality, the proposition is
advanced that modern life, and holidays in particular, are a very bad
idea.
Environmentalists have been saying so for years, of course, but since
they commence from a position of absolute virtue -- that the least human
beings do by way of existing is the best they can do -- the assault on
leisure has hitherto made little ground among the migratory mob. Now
holidaymakers themselves, desiring nothing more shocking than a
fortnight away from the daily grind, are beginning slowly to notice the
damage they do. Evidence accumulates of a horrible irony: that we
destroy the things we slave and save to enjoy just by travelling to
enjoy them.
Towards the end of his chapter on Goa, Anderson remarks: ''Tourism,
someone told me, is now the biggest industry in the world.'' Someone was
right: the travel trade is all that and more, capable of being
construed, without much hyperbole, as the new imperialism, a continuing
process of invasion and despoliation on a scale more vast than anything
the British Empire ever conceived. Modern tourism will have more lasting
impact than any war, and has more influence on economies and foreign
policies than any ideology. It means no real harm, like a virus without
evil intent, but it kills its hosts.
Television involves a similar contradiction, and as Anderson
shamefacedly admits, ''. . . making a TV programme and writing a book
about a place like Goa, even though they focus on the problems of
tourism, is likely to attract more people than it repels . . . So I am
part of the problem and not the solution.''
That contradiction is also part of his book's problem. This
good-looking volume is part reportage, part jaunty travelogue, and part
a serious investigation of issues with profound implications. What are
we supposed to do? Stay at home? And what then of the countries --
Scotland prominent among them -- living in the belief that only the
tourist dollar saves them from penury? Is development always bad? Must
the world become ever more homogenised? Anderson raises the issues but
prefers, for the most part, to supply the drolleries demanded of his
prime-time TV persona than to address them.
The travel trade pops up again and again as a thread in the book's
general, weary theme of ''trouble in paradise''. Here we have the
encroachment of the modern world on Kenya's Maasai Mara; Dominica caught
in the machinations of the world banana market; socialist Cuba crushed
by America and deserted by its children; the movement for autonomy in
ruined Hawaii; the war between loggers and conservationists in Oregon.
Insatiable Western society is depicted as consuming, literally and
spiritually, the beautiful places and things it most admires.
This is an important idea, largely because its ramifications have yet
to be explored fully, and you get the impression that Anderson might
have preferred to investigate it in more depth than he has -- even the
trite title was a compromise -- but the ''recognition factor''
afflicting a chat-show host overwhelms him. Good, serious passages
invariably give way to the cute, the quaint, and the relentlessly
''entertaining''. Our Man In . . . is itself almost a parable of the
processes it investigates.
The book reads like five long magazine articles. Anderson's TV voice
intrudes continually -- ''The other vehicles . . . are mostly Ladas.
Lada cars, stretch Ladas, Lada taxis. Taken and driven away, no doubt,
by Lada louts.''
In the end, you feel Our Man sensed he was on to something but
couldn't decide quite what it was, how it might be dramatised, or how
the result might be sold to the vast sedentary audience watching while
they planned their two weeks in the sun. The photographs, on the other
hand, are pretty as postcards.

THE AFTERLIFE AND OTHER STORIES
By John Updike
Hamish Hamilton, #14.99 (pp 316)
IN the title story, Carter Billings says, ''The Big Guy is getting our
range.'' Updike is suddenly ageing. Of course, it has its compensations.
Foreign travel is on the agenda; but cash and success bring little
comfort, for nothing can take these characters where they want to be,
back in their pasts, 30 golden years ago.
Each of the 22 stories carries the desolation of late middle age, a
lack of expectancy, and the antagonisms of minor ailments which could
presage something serious. The Grim Reaper hovers on the For Sale signs
hung outside homes of the recently departed.
Those who remain, with blinkered determination, take up a hobby
they've always fancied, but life is not what it used to be. What with
AIDS and shopping malls and the ozone layer: ''We live in plague
times,'' an old man says. Memory surfaces with a surge of joy.
The men tease each other over their inability to perform. They shuffle
rather than walk and are often bullied by their wives into doing what
they do not want to do, taking exercise or digging their gardens. They
are revealed for what they always were, wee boys, lonely and adrift, now
having to deal with grown-up things for which they have had no
preparation and with nothing to fall back on.
Which exposes Updike's main weakness. His women have always had a
single function. When that function is reduced, impaired, or even
obliterated, he can give them neither character nor a past. Even
conversation can be difficult. His men imagine what women are like,
mostly physically. They do not know.
His strength has always been the way he explores family ties and the
ways in which his characters are defined by their ordinary expectations.
Where these combine he approaches tenderness, as elderly men try to come
to terms with their dead or dying mothers, with the cord being cut.
In ''The Other Side of the Street'' a man returns to his childhood
home to bury his mother, indulging in his cherished dream that life was
better in the house across the road. On the way back, his former house
is ablaze, ''. . . the porchlight and front-room lamps were lit up as if
to welcome a visitor, a visitor, it seemed to him, long expected and
much beloved.''
In ''A Sandstone Farmhouse'' Joey returns to the place his recently
deceased mother bought to avoid the suffocation of suburbia. He sees the
house as a betrayal. Sifting through her things, he realises the
resentment he has carried since childhood. He also ''. . . discovered
himself talking aloud, as if in response to a friendly presence just
behind the dry old wallpaper, within the thick stone walls.''
Many of these stories seem mechanical, written to order, prompted by
New Yorker deadlines. An occasional piece bears flashes of his former
self or shows his new concerns.
''The Man Who Became a Soprano'' is vintage Updike, a brilliant story
which almost defies summary. A 10-strong recorder group are followed
from their beginnings to a concert in the Congregational Church's parish
hall. The final piece is ''Silent Night''. The continuing sexual
tensions and involvements are meticulously plotted and traced down to
the final detail of the group taking their bow feeling ''cherished as
children are cherished, just for being themselves'' knowing their glory
is over.
In the opening title story, Jane and Carter Billings visit friends who
have transplanted themselves to the Norfolk Fens, where they paint,
watch birds, and involve themselves in village life. Carter loses his
footing in his friend's old house and almost tumbles downstairs, the
sense of reprieve jolts him into a heightened awareness of the world
around him, and makes him voyage into a storm to buy a gift for Jane,
surprised and amused at his host's astonishment that the man didn't know
''they were beyond all that now''.

THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLD IN THE REIGN OF PHILIP
II
By Fernand Braudel
HarperCollins, #14.99 (pp 690)
THIS famous book is now nearly half a century old, and a new English
edition amply vindicates its place as one of the most brilliant
historical works of modern times. The original translation of 1972 ran
to 1375 pages. So you get just about half of it in this abridgement by
Richard Ollard. The price is anyway astounding by today's standards, and
in itself deserves to win the volume its intended wide readership.
What made the book famous is the richness of its total history, a term
which Braudel, if he did not invent it, certainly defined. His focus, on
the end of the sixteenth century, is apparently narrow. The point of
departure is the ebbing of a struggle between two great powers, the
Spanish and the Ottoman Empires, which had been contending for control
from opposite ends of the Mediterranean.
Out of this Braudel weaves a vast tapestry of many strands and
textures, bringing to light every conceivable aspect of life in a
vibrant and colourful region. For once, formidable scholarship is
fascinating to follow.
Still, it is worth noting that Braudel did not after all cover
everything. This volume, more lavishly illustrated than the previous
ones, includes among the pictures selected by the editor two from a book
by William Lithgow, a young Scot who went on a journey all round the
Middle East in 1612. One has him in a raffish Turkish turban, the other
shows him tied up by Moldavian bandits threatening to murder him.
Happily they did not, and Lithgow survived to come home and write up
his adventures, which were in their time a best-seller. But Braudel
himself seems to have been unaware of it. The only Scots he mentioned in
his text were Catholic deserters to the Spanish navy after 1560, and
unfortunates who turned up in the slave market of Algiers, probably
after corsairs' raids on the Western Isles of which no record otherwise
survives.
Such details are typical of how Braudel evokes the worldwide
connections of the Mediterranean in his period. They stretched from the
Americas to China, yet could not sustain the region's earlier economic
leadership. It was no longer a centre but a periphery, a frontier
between Europe and Africa, between East and West, between Christianity
and Islam. Not, indeed, since the Roman Empire had it formed a unity.
By now the peoples round its shores often regarded each other as
utterly alien. Even so, the facts of geography and climate often imposed
similar patterns on their lives. To follow these eternal affinities
through the comparatively trivial rise and fall of men and states is the
great allure of Braudel's achievement.

TO THE DEATH, AMIC
By John Bryson
Hamish Hamilton, #14.99 (pp )
THE Spanish Civil War is unique in terms of the interest it elicited
from artists and activists. It drew a strong Scottish response. One
quarter of the British Battalion of the International Brigade hailed
from Scotland, and half of the Scottish contingent were from Glasgow. My
own father was a volunteer who was captured at the Battle of Jarama and
held prisoner for six months. The whole event has been poeticised to the
point where it has arguably lost its political relevance. Literature
made it, but it also dated it faster than history could have wished.
Given the war's exposure in art, there is something startlingly
original about John Bryson's novel, based on the life of a Catalan
anarchist named Enrique. Bryson captures beautifully the heroism and
hypocrisy, corruption and compromise of this, and any other war, from a
child's eye perspective, and that of an insider. The struggle here is
for the home front.
Enrique has a twin, Josep, through whom he is able to watch himself
growing up, and the novel is a meditation on ideas of brotherhood,
family, solidarity, and community in adversity. A recurring question is:
''Who was loyal?'' The crowd gathered round a public list of those
''held for questioning'' parts for a woman in whose cry they recognise a
common fear: ''Few here were so sure of their kin that they might not
have had to make the same blatant journey.'' One is constantly made to
feel that from the inside, as it were, this war is less a struggle
between good and evil than a conflict that involves a complex matrix of
alliances and enmities, traversing social and cultural boundaries.
The aphoristic style is at its best in the stunning account of the
German bombing of the Basque valley township of Guernica. The key to its
emotional power lies in the versatility of the prose, at once engaged
and dispassionate. The banality of the violence, its brutal incursion
into an everyday scene, is shocking.
Then there is the soldier who is measured by Enrique's Papa, the
tailor, for a suit he will wear for a bride he has yet to choose when
the war is over. Cut to flatter his unathletic frame, it adorns a model
at the shop door, testament to an Unknown Soldier. When Paper is caught
in a blast Enrique searches for fragments ''behind the tender pouches of
his pinched lids with a toothpick softened in my own mouth''. There were
many times reading this novel that I felt myself in need of such tender
ministration.
Bryson highlights the gap between sloganeering and survival. The
narrative negotiates the narrow isthmus between the rhetoric of defiance
and the reality of defeat. Newsboards proudly proclaiming the resistance
of Madrid jar with the voice of La Pasionaria crying ''No Pasaran''.
Enrique asks wryly: ''What need of rhetoric does she have if the fascist
have failed?'' The football stadium is converted to a refugee camp, and,
in the face of a triumphalism that is out of sync with local experience,
Enrique finds ''scrawled above a filthy urinal, the slogan: Withdraw the
Forwards to the Goal Line''.
The simultaneous preponderance and impotence of propaganda is amply
illustrated in the cartoons of Franco smeared with slogans: ''Stone his
cheek, but his lips never give a tremble. Tear out an eye, the other
looks on. Imprisoned by graffiti he is stoical, as a man justified by
noble resolve. We were permitting him courage beyond the reality of
life.''
The emotional farewell to the International Brigades is also a
farewell to a certain kind of activism, and a ''courage beyond the
reality of life''. Of La Pasionaria's speech Enrique asks: ''What poet
would chance lines of such finery?'' Meanwhile, Papa ensures that the
passports of dead Brigaders are inherited by refugees. It is one of the
many paradoxes of this deeply moving novel that it tells us in the most
exquisite and extraordinary language that heroism is ordinary.
Disturbingly, so too is the hardship that engenders it.

THE retrospective at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in
Edinburgh of the work of Sir James Gunn -- the Glasgow-born artist --
has it all.
A society painter renowned for his studies of famous folk (including
royals and Prime Ministers), he was knighted for services to the arts a
year before his death at the age of 71 in 1964.
Since the show opened, every facet of the exhibition -- the excellent
food in the gallery's Queen Street Cafe, and the quality merchandise
which accompanies it -- has been reviewed. All but the marvellous
clothes.
Which is strange, because even those people who claim to know nothing
about art can see from this retrospective that what is being worn in the
pictures is almost as important as the people who were being painted,
particularly in the case of the artist's stunning wife, Pauline.
Not surprisingly, it is a portrait of Pauline Gunn in a splendid
yellow dress, painted in 1944, which has been chosen for the cover of
the exhibition catalogue, rather than one of Hilaire Belloc, Sir William
Darling, or Harold Macmillan.
The painting, which shows Pauline seated in an armchair cuddling one
of a pair of white lap-dogs, was bought for #1000 within an hour of
going on show at the Royal Academy in London. A fellow artist,
apparently jealous of Gunn's popularity with the public, dismissed it as
''cheap and photographic'' but it became known as the Mona Lisa of 1944
and was later voted picture of the year.It is a feast for the eyes.
Gunn paid great attention to such detail as the intricate pattern on
the dress (possibly painted by his assistant?), a diamante belt buckle,
trimming of black velvet ribbon and Pauline's jewellery and make-up,
including the scarlet nail varnish that can be seen through her
open-toed black suede shoes.
Pauline, born in 1901, daughter of an architect, worked for Elizabeth
Arden in London and Rome until her marriage in 1929 and, in all the
portraits of her, is never seen looking less than immaculate with
beautifully coiffed hair, finely shaped eyebrows, scarlet lips, and
nails to match.
In 1945, the artist painted his wife in a gorgeous evening coat, of
crimson velvet printed with gold, designed by Fortuny and bought by the
couple in Venice. With it, Pauline wears an intricate necklace and
earring set, which is also on show in its original box, at the
exhibition.
In 1946, four years before her painful death from cancer at the age of
49, Pauline is portrayed in the Macleod tartan (Sir James's
great-grandmother was a Macleod), made up not into a common-or-garden
kilt, but a stylish frock with fluted sleeves and extravagant collar and
cuffs in rich, black velvet.
An earlier painting, dating from 1939, shows Pauline apparently
waiting at the swish London hotel, Claridges, rigged out in a
fashionable black coat with matching pillbox hat, veil, gloves,
umbrella, and handbag, the ensemble set off by a fur piece, diamante
brooch and earrings.
Commenting on the subject, Cloe Blackburn, daughter of the artist,
told me: ''The reality behind these lovely pictures -- and he painted
her many more times over the 21 years of their marriage -- was hard work
on both their parts. Anyone who has sat for their portrait even once
will know this. All dressed up and in the studio at nine o'clock in the
morning!''
No Bohemian himself, Gunn was the son of a successful Glasgow tailor
-- which probably goes a long way to explaining his love of good clothes
-- and always dressed in black jacket, tie and pinstriped trousers when
painting.
* The exhibition continues at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery
until February 26.

Bra Wars: this year marks the first anniversary of Gossard's Ultrabra.
Its launch signalled an escalation of the battle with Playtex, maker of
Wonderbra. Anvar Khan reports on how the main rivals and other
manufacturers are measuring up
THE Bra Wars haven't had as much press as any other conflict in the
world at present, but they are no less real. There are civilian
casualties, namely women. The fact is that breasts feed babies. The
protagonists are sympathetic. Every adult ''babe'' too, they say, should
have a full and heaving set.
The Japanese went in for a little foot-binding because they believed
that the prettiest part of the body should be kept small. They do it
with trees, and call it the art of Bonsai; with TVs and CDs, and call it
technological advancement. (Enough -- Ed.)
But Western culture is obsessed with making possessions bigger not
smaller. Big house, big car, big bust. And for those women, who look as
if breast-binding was a parental compulsion, there is an answer. In the
name of democracy and human rights, in an attempt to make a large bosom
accessible to all women, a British bra manufacturer came up with an
underwired brassiere called the Wonderbra. And it sells over 20,000 a
week. The Wonderbra does not need the endorsement of the royal family,
but as The Guardian recently suggested, Princess Di may be wearing one
too.
The underwired bra can be best explained by a certain Dimitri Tiomkin
ditty. Its sole remit is to round 'em up, push 'em out . . . Rawhide!
Large breasts have a primeval magnetism, but they mean different things
on different women. On Hattie Jacques, come to mama; on Barbara Windsor,
let's have fun; on Monroe, down boy. Bras make up the largest sector of
sales in the lingerie market, worth #485m. For a slice of this, alone,
the Bra War is worth waging.
Any woman who believes in the power of sensuality can wear a cleavage.
A cleavage is boastful. It takes its revenge upon the dumb, feminist-cum
chauvinist-mentality, that women cannot be both sexual and intelligent.
A cleavage means a woman is unafraid of both attracting and/or
intimidating the opposite sex. Or even her own. In popular culture,
female icons, from Page Three pretties to the cartoon Jessica Rabbit,
are voluptuous. Only in the world of highbrow entertainment, such as The
Late Show, are leading women allowed to be seen to be flat-chested.
The current Bra War is complicated, but suitably cut 'n' thrust.
Gossard produced the Wonderbra for over 25 years until it lost its
licence to Playtex. In a strange twist, orchestrated by red tape,
bureaucracy and the pursuit of humungous profit, the company which
bought out the licencer, bought Playtex too. It then decided, of course,
not to renew Gossard's licence to produce the Wonderbra and awarded it
to Playtex itself instead.
Back at the front Gossard set about inventing the Ultrabra (#18.99),
effectively placing itself in competition with Playtex, and the bra it
previously produced as its own.
What's more, Berlei, Gossard's sister company, is currently punting
the Demi-wire (#18.99), an underwired cup which also aims to maximise
fullness.
The Bra War is an arena where various comparable products are being
self-consciously marketed by a few. But the competition is looking
healthier. Think of Gulliver surrounded by grasping Lilliputians. Asda,
Marks, and Spencer and Bhs have caught up with the giants.
George at Asda has an underwired range from #12.99, Marks and Spencer
from around #14. The new Bhs collection feature bras from #4 to #9. Bhs
is the first High Street store to offer a size range from 30AA (for
those who don't even need a bra) to 42F (to those who need to wear two).
If Gossard and Playtex are the glamour queens, the Boadicea's of the
Bra War, then Bhs is the social worker. The High Street chain has
sponsored a Breast Cancer Care leaflet offering advice on the right bra
to choose after a mastectomy.
Bra Warfare isn't fair. It's dirty. So is the current, trans-global,
billboard campaign by Playtex. Sam Fox made a career out of having a big
chest. The Playtex PR team got just as much mileage out of the model's
own. Lines include ''Look Me In The Eyes And Tell Me That You Love Me''
and ''Or Are You Just Pleased To See Me?''. The ads are streetsmart,
sassy and play on a particularly male condition which Playtex first
publicly recognised in 1994. To celebrate Ireland's entry into the World
Cup, they produced an exclusive green Wonderbra. And its slogan? ''Cup
Fever''.
THE LURE OF LINGERIE
Some fascinating facts about women and the purchase of bras:
* British women buy more underwear than any other garment, spending
#1,200,000m a year.
* The increase in separations and divorces has had a positive effect
on lingerie with women wanting to look more glamorous.
* Better nutrition and more women taking the pill has led to an
increase in size from an average of 34B to 36C.
* Underwired bras account for 50% of sales.
* White is the most popular colour for bras accounting for 70% of all
sales. Black equals 20%.

BRIDALWEAR designers Aileen Sherry and Ishbel Mackay, who trade under
the name Toadilboney!, are so good that even when they created a wedding
gown from wallpaper, people wanted to buy it.
Aileen Sherry explained: ''We'd bought some #1.99-a-roll wallpaper for
the fitting rooms and as there was some left over, I decided to make it
up into a dress for the window display.''
Soon a prospective customer appeared, saying she would be bringing her
daughter along to ''try on that dress in the window''.
Not made from wallpaper but from antique-look silk, gold lace and
fabric roses, was the Toadilboney! gown which recently won Best Scottish
Design in the Best of British Bridal Awards. It was called Helena after
the actress, Helena Bonham Carter, because it looked like something she
might wear in one of her costumey films.
''Bridal dresses usually have names,'' said Sherry, ''but they're
normally rather pretentious-sounding ones like Assumpta. As a reaction
to that, we like to give our dresses sensible, Scottish names like Morag
and Fiona. So Helena was a bit of a departure.''
Demand has increased so much that the company, which is now in its
fifth year, is to introduce a ready-to-wear range which will be
available from selected bridalwear shops both north and south of the
Border.

TELEVISION'S The Clothes Show makes sense of the fashion industry,
that is its remit. It focuses on the latest gear, but unlike self-styled
gurus and designer groupies, it refuses to be sidetracked into analysis
of lifestyle. Instead, it concentrates on simple reportage: who, where,
why, and when. And how.
While the programme covers the usual minority sports -- being a
supermodel or an international couturier -- it also pays serious
attention to the members of the major league, the people who buy.
The presenters of this consumer affair, which returns to BBC1
tomorrow, understand the psychology of the punter (that everyone wants
to look gorgeous), something that eludes big-name designers.
Caryn Franklin, Brenda Emmanus and Jeff Banks are unafraid of getting
dirty; forsaking Naomi to hobnob with Joe Bloggs on public transport
(February 19), investigating the hidden world of pattern-cutters (March
19), but they are particularly bright on the mechanics of the industry
they are doing the favour of promoting.
Tomorrow, Brenda Emmanus visits Australia and Korea on the trail of
the world's most expensive fabric, and follows the shearing of the
merino sheep -- so cossetted they're given raincoats to protect their
fleece -- through the process that turns wool into suit lengths that can
fetch #15,000 apiece.
She also attends the creation of a suit cut from the cloth at tailors
Gieves and Hawkes. The edition also noses in on looks for spring.

HOWARD DAVIES, Director General of the Confederation of British
Industry, said yesterday: ''Something odd happened to income
distribution in the UK at the end of the 1970s.'' Very coy, that. What
he means is that in 1979 the Tories came back in, and the gap between
top and bottom incomes started widening.
So much can be agreed, even by those who, like Davies, do not
especially care to spell it out. It is anyway set forth in detail by the
report from the Rowntree Foundation which he helped to write and which
he was commenting on. Apart from anything else, this result was an
object of Tory policy.
But how odd was it? It did break a trend. Since 1945 the relationship
between top and bottom incomes in Britain had scarcely changed. There
were, from time to time, draconian regimes of taxation. Denis Healey
promised to squeeze the rich till the pips squeaked. But as an exercise
in the decisive redistribution of income these regimes failed. After a
third of a century of the welfare state, incomes had not become
significantly more equal, though they had not become less equal either.
That might seem a reasonable outcome, except there was a price. It may
be a simplified, but not an inaccurate, description of fiscal policy
during those decades to say that only when all other claims had been
settled -- for the expenses of the state itself, for the pay of its
mushrooming workforce, for its countless speculative social and economic
schemes, for demands from proliferating pressure groups, for such moral
principles as the governments espoused -- only then could we even begin
to consider how to deploy the remaining resources so as to make
ourselves richer.
The consequence was a top marginal tax rate of 83% and the worst
economy in the Western world. Other nations first created the wealth,
then redistributed it. We tried, and failed, to do the opposite. We had
the equality. They had the income.
At the CBI, an active participant in the corporate state, all this
doubtless seemed normal, so of course Davies finds something odd about
the deviation since 1979. Others might perceive a return to sanity.
Anyway, the Conservatives set out to reduce the role of the state,
open up the field for private enterprise and let people keep more of the
income and wealth they were creating, in the hope that they would have
an incentive to create more. No policy works out perfectly, but by and
large this one succeeded.
Britain enjoyed eight consecutive years of growth in real terms,
something that had not been achieved since 1870, and the growth was
usually higher than in our main competitor countries.
If prosperity causes a widening in the distribution of income, then
this may be a price worth paying. The alternative is to starve -- and
perhaps kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
But averages do conceal different experiences. The Rowntree Report
points especially to the poorest 10% of the population, which has seen
no rise in its real income. If this is true -- and some economists
dispute it -- it may have to do with the tying of benefits to the rate
of inflation. The remedy would lie either in generating still faster
growth so as to bring these people off benefits, and into the workforce,
or else even better targeting of benefits to pay more in real terms to
those who truly need them.
Still, we need not look far above this underclass to see the
trickle-down effects of prosperity which the Rowntree Report denies. At
the start of the period it covers, a household one quarter of the way up
the range of income distribution disposed, at today's prices of about
#120 a week.
By 1992, this figure rose to nearer #140. The rise for a household
three-quarters of the way up the range was from #230 to #320 a week. The
rich have got very much richer, but the poor have got somewhat richer
too. Only in relative terms did the poor lose ground.
This brings us to the heart, or what ought to be the heart, of the
debate about the distribution of income in Britain. The basic question
is whether the Government can actually control it, short of a Stalinist
apparatus of intervention. The suspicion that such control is beyond the
power of any government in an otherwise liberal economy rests on the
argument that wages -- the price of labour -- are in principle like the
price of everything else on sale.
They are set by supply and demand, their level moves according to the
conditions of supply and demand, and there relative level changes all
the time because those conditions vary so much in each case. We do not
worry that lobster is dearer than bread. Why should we worry that one
man is paid more than another if his work commands, on that principle, a
higher wage?
Yet it is alarming if whole groups of men and women are excluded from
the advantages of a free economy, in the way and for the reasons that
the Rowntree Report outlines. For those who must depend on the state, we
can make the system of benefits operate better. For those able to work,
we should rely on making our economy grow faster, as in the 1980s we
managed to do. So long as their wages rise in real terms from year to
year, as for the vast majority they have risen, we should not worry when
others' wages rise faster. The rest, the matter of relative incomes, is
none of the state's business, any more than the relative price of bread
and lobster.
At any rate, governments have never succeeded for long in setting or
altering those relativities. It is at best stupid and at worst wicked
for governments to try to do, or promise to do, what in fact they cannot
do.

SOMEWHERE across the heart of Glasgow lies a line. It's not straight
or even and you can't see it, but it's there. On one side 44.7% of the
city's populace live in relative or, occasionally, sublime comfort. On
the other, 55.3% live in areas of acute multiple deprivation.
New statistics to be published next month by Strathclyde Regional
Council have found that the number of people living in poverty in the
region is continuing to rise. The figures will reinforce the recent
Rowntree report which found a clear and ever-thickening line between
rich and poor in the UK.
Sally Gemmell lives below the line. She is 40, disabled, with three
teenage children and an invalid husband. Home is a two-bedroom terraced
house in the Milton area of Glasgow. Income is a range of benefits,
which she would rather not discuss.
She is somewhat bemused by the talk of lines and poverty statistics.
It's her life and she's making what she can of it.
There is a large crack running down the outside wall and the bedroom
and bathroom are riddled with dampness, but the lounge is kept warm by a
new gas fire and there are family photographs everywhere.
She claims to be satisfied with her benefits, then pauses and admits:
''I think maybe we could do with a bit more.''
Her husband, Robert, 41, a former steelworker, suffers from depression
and has not worked for some time. His medication is stacked neatly on
the mantlepiece and his heavy footsteps across the room upstairs
punctuate the conversation.
''He's had it for two or three years now. Things just get people down,
all the things that are happening around them. It's terrible. It's a bad
world we live in just now. It gets to people.''
She worries constantly about her three children and the pressures on
them from the drugs scene. Her youngest is 13 and hangs about with his
friends in nearby Possilpark.
''You have to watch all the time. I point out things on the telly and
say 'don't get into that'. Then again, you just feel you can't stop them
from doing things, you've just got to let them get on with it to some
extent.''
The family try to get away once a year, normally for a holiday at
Butlins in Skegness. The kids want to go to Blackpool this year, but
they will have to figure out if it will cost more.
They have been waiting three years for a new home, somewhere with
better access for Sally's wheelchair. She has been in the area for 12
years and doesn't want to stay.
''I wouldn't like the children to live here too long. I'd like to see
them in a better area -- you know, for families to be brought up.''
For Strathclyde Region, Sally's life is a numeral in a sheaf of
statistics and tables which make up their latest social trends survey.
The survey found that 520,686 people, or 23% of the population in
Strathclyde, were dependent on income support -- the official factor for
determining poverty. The number is up almost 11% on the last survey in
1991.
Broken down, the figures found 29% of children under 16 and 21% of
people over 60 living in households dependent on income support.
Other findings include:
* Over 63% of all tenant households in the region received housing
benefit in 1993, an increase of 8% over the last five years.
* 79% of all single parent households and over 67% of single
pensioners receive housing benefit.
* Almost 32% of primary school pupils were eligible for free school
meals in 1993/1994, an increase of 6% from 1989.
* Between 1990 and 1993 the number of primary pupils eligible for
clothing grants rose from 33% to 44%, or 88,138 children.
* In the 1993-1994 school year, 6.4% of primary school children in
Eastwood received free school meals, compared to 47.3% in Glasgow. The
same year, 10.2% of primary pupils in Eastwood received clothing grants,
compared to 60.7% in Glasgow.
* In 1993, 6% of those living in the Bearsden/Milngavie area received
housing benefit compared to 45% in Glasgow.
* In 1981 the region's lowest earners had an income amounting to 40%
of the highest earners. By 1993 it had dropped to 33%.
''Our findings are very similar to the Rowntree Report,'' said
researcher Charlie Macgregor. ''There's a deepening divide between the
better-off areas in Strathclyde and the poorer areas.''
The region, he added, has identified a co-ordinated package to tackle
the problems including housing, urban regeneration and employment
initiatives.
The latest statistics paint an overall picture, but some areas of
Strathclyde are in a particularly bleak situation. In one primary school
in Possilpark, 93% of the children receive clothing grants, in another
81% get free school meals.
The Possil area has, for many, become a prime example of the
deprivation and drugs blight afflicting parts of Glasgow.
On Balmore Road, in the heart of the district, a youth teeters
dead-eyed on the edge of the pavement, a thin stretch of spittle
spiralling from his mouth. A few streets away a small girl in a smart
red velvet coat and hat is swinging along the pavement between two
adults, her small giggles matching their leisurely strides.
For Ronnie Rodden, it is typical of the area where she has lived for
27 years. For every needle-tracked teen there's a single mum maintaining
her dignity and sense of humour in the face of pretty dismal odds.
Ronnie, 51, heads a local centre for the disabled and has watched the
Possil community sink lower as the years progressed.
''You get to a certain level and you start to believe this is as far
as I'm going to go. Maybe you can go downwards but you are never going
to go upwards. It's a real shame. There are an awful lot of good people
here. ''
Ill-health is endemic, but Ronnie worries more about the mental health
of many of her fellow residents.
''It's not mental illness, but there is a kind of depression. Where
are you going from here? We have got nothing and we will get nothing.
That's a very, very bad thing.''
Yet, despite the drugs and the blight she insists there is a lot to
love about Possil. ''A lot of people have done a lot of work here in the
last 18 to 20 years. No-one's said that's a good thing.''
Across at Possil Community Business, spokeswoman Lindsey Owens gets
frustrated that the ventures which have brought employment and some
light relief to the area are overshadowed by its public image.
''That doesn't help it. The people in Possil start believing it. If
people keep telling you you're scum and Possil is the worst place in the
world, then you'll start to believe it. They never emphasise the good
points. There's a big network of people in the area who do good work.''
Back in the disabled centre where Ronnie works a fuss is being made
over a new baby. Outside an elderly woman is flirting with the helper
lifting her into the van. ''Stop your nonsense,'' he tells her with a
giggle and and a wink.
Ronnie says she never ceases to be amazed at the sense of humour of
the people around her, no matter how desperate their circumstances.
''It's marvellous. Some of the wittiest here are some of the poorest.
I think that's what keeps them going. Sometimes it's either laugh or
slit your wrists.''
She even manages a wry smile herself when she is asked to tell the
Government what Possil needs.
''Good housing, jobs, proper jobs,'' she says,''and hope for the
people who live here that somehow things are going to get better.''
'Things just get
people down,
all the things
happening
around them.
It's a bad
world we live
in just now. It
gets to people'

Steve Bruce is Professor of Sociology
at Aberdeen University
FILM-MAKERS have no greater insight into the future than the rest of
us but their visions, more Apocalypse than Utopia, merely exaggerate
what is already there in embryo.
More often than not that future has two societies, worlds apart but
side-by-side. There is the air-conditioned world of shiny clean surfaces
and electronic gadgets, populated by tall, straight, well-dressed and
handsome people. But beyond the helium-filled, triple-glazed windows
there is the ghetto of pot-holed broken streets littered with rusting
vehicles and lit by bonfires, inhabited by stunted, filthy, and
inarticulate savages whose reason and morality has been destroyed by
drugs: a land where it is not the fittest but the most vicious who
survive.
The nightmare of the affluent urban American is to take the wrong turn
off the motorway and break down in one of those streets. The savages
will surround them, drag them from their metal cocoon, rape their
children, and tear them limb from limb.
This nightmare is already familiar to the citizens of New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia and while the inhabitants of
Bearsden and Braid Hills can still sleep undisturbed by dread of falling
into the hands of drug-crazed proles, those who know the insides of the
big British cities should already feel a shiver of recognition.
We have been here before. The cities of the eigthteenth and nineteenth
centuries had their enclaves of sin and vice which, like the furthest
corners of darkest Africa, were visited by brave explorers who returned
to frighten the middle classes with their candid reports of life in
these dens of poverty and iniquity. But we thought they had gone.
By the end of the Second World War full employment and the safety nets
of the welfare state had all but eradicated such counties of the
dispossessed. We may now be seeing them return with a vengeance.
Since the Great Depression there has been a real improvement in the
living standards of the poor, but arguably the future for social harmony
looks more bleak now than it did when George Orwell wrote his classic
''travelogue'' of 1930s poverty, The Road to Wigan Pier. The first
reason to be fearful is the hidden sting in that notion of ''relative''
deprivation. Radical free marketeers take the point that our poor as
better off than the poor of our grandparents' day to mean that the
buggers should not be grateful and stop complaining and we should feel
little responsibility for them. Perhaps. But the poor will not see it
like that.
They feel more deprived than the poor of the inter-war years because
wherever they look they are confronted by the ever brighter, ever more
glossy artefacts of our prosperity. Where the inter-war poor hung around
on the corners of streets of houses not that much sounder or warmer or
more brightly decorated than their own hovels, our poor warm themselves
in shopping centres crammed with expensive consumer goods. Worse, they
can sit in their badly heated and unsanitary council flats and watch
endless TV sitcoms of bourgeois life.
In the 30 years from Terry and June to One Foot in the Grave all
that's changed in TV representations of the normal world is that the
kitchens have become more exquisitely fitted and equipped. In an ironic
salute to a world from which they are excluded, poor teenagers can buy
cheap imitations of American Ivy League College sweatshirts and baseball
caps.
Of course, they could watch documentaries about famine in the Horn of
Africa and feel relatively privileged. But they will not. With
fatalistic resignation, pathetic envy, or seething indignation, they
will consume the glossy images of a world of consumption from which,
unless they take up robbery and drug-dealing, they are excluded.
The second reason for being fearful of our future is that the poverty
of the inter-war years was often temporary and cyclical. Along with the
elderly, families with young children were most at risk, but as the
children grew up and became wage-earners, the family moved back into the
mainstream. Many of the jobless could view their deprivation as a
temporary expulsion from the world of security and prosperity. They were
laid off now but the shipyards would soon be hiring again. There will be
no expansion of decently paid low-skill jobs in this country. In our
global economy that work is now done in poorer countries. For our poor,
being unemployed is less a setback from which they can hope to recover
and more a permanent condition.
We should not be surprised when our internal aliens turn to
destruction and self-destruction.
How can we expect people to prefer being sober to being drunk and
drugged when the illusions of chemistry are more pleasing than the real
world?
How can we expect people to rise from their beds, clean themselves,
and present a disciplined body to the world when the main result of
self-discipline is acute awareness of how little pleasure and reward the
day will bring?
How can we expect people who have little hope of sharing our comforts
to continue to share our moral standards or abide by our laws?
Those who are encouraged to want what the rest of us have but who are
denied the legitimate opportunities to acquire it will sooner or later
turn to illegitimate means.
For a while we can remain indifferent. Destroying oneself takes less
effort, imagination, and ingenuity than destroying others; doing drugs
is easier than rioting. The horizons of the poor are generally so short
that those with enough energy to victimise anyone but themselves and
their families will turn on their neighbours before they reach us.
At present, for most readers of this paper, the ill-divided world is
merely the exotic background to the scripts of such television
entertainments as NYPD and Hill Street Blues. But for our children it
may be the bitter rot in the fruit of their prosperity.
'How can we expect people who have little hope of sharing our comforts
to continue to share our moral standards or abide by our laws?'

SENIOR management of The Robert Gordon University are to meet sacked
lecturer Mrs Sheena Falconer next week to discuss the findings of an
industrial tribunal which ordered her reinstatement and awarded her
#41,000 compensation.
After 27 years' service, Mrs Falconer, of Anderson Drive, Aberdeen,
was offered redundancy from her post as a senior lecturer in the School
of Food and Consumer Studies or an alternative post as a lecturer which
would have meant putting her sister, also a lecturer, out of work.
Colleagues held a series of one-day strikes in support after her
dismissal in April 1993, and her union, the Educational Institute of
Scotland, said the tribunal's decision earlier this week vindicated its
actions and justice had been served.
The tribunal concluded that Mrs Falconer, who has started her own
clothing company in Keith, had not been made redundant because, when he
made the decision, the University Principal, Dr David Kennedy, did not
have all the relevant facts before him.
The tribunal also said the university concentrated on what it saw as
the primary component of her function to the exclusion of all else.
Yesterday, in its first response to Monday's decision, the university
expressed surprise at the tribunal's findings.
''Over a lengthy period leading up to the termination of Mrs
Falconer's employment, the university carefully considered the issues
relating to her employment with the benefit of professional advice.''
''Senior officers of the university will also be meeting Mrs Falconer
as soon as possible.''

<HEADLINE>RAF anger mounts over top officer's forced retirement. Rifkind retreats under heavy fire</HEADLINE>

DEFENCE Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was under heavy fire last night
following his decision to force the early retirement of Air Chief
Marshall Sir Sandy Wilson from his #95,000-a-year job.
Resentment in the services over allegations that Sir Sandy was being
made a scapegoat over the issue of #387,000 spent on renovating his
official residence spilled over into the House of Commons last night.
MPs were angered that Mr Rifkind chose to return to his Edinburgh
consitituency without making a full Commons statement.
Instead, the announcement that Sir Sandy, a former commander of RAF
Lossiemouth and -- until the row over the renovation of his official
home -- a candidate for Chief of the Air Staff, was to take early
retirement came in a written statement.
Furious Opposition MPs accused Mr Rifkind of fleeing London in the
wake of the controversy surrounding 53-year-old Sir Sandy's retirement,
at least four years earlier than he might have anticipated.
Mr Rifkind was accused of allowing junior Minister Nicholas Soames,
responsible for the Armed Forces, to take the flak.
The air chief was forced to relinquish his position as
Commander-in-Chief of RAF Training and Personnel during a stormy meeting
with Mr Rifkind on Thursday, when it was made clear by the Secretary of
State that the air chief no longer had his confidence.
Sir Sandy was shattered by the decision, said friends.
Senior colleagues could not hide their anger yesterday -- not least in
the manner the issue came into the public domain.
It is understood that, at the most, only six people at the highest
level in Government and the Civil Service were likely to have read the
#100,000 report into the cost of refurbishment. Even now, the report is
not going to be published in full.
Nevertheless, the forced early retirement of Sir Sandy was leaked to
the Daily Telegraph on Thursday.
Sir Sandy was forced to take early retirement following a report into
his official residence at Haymes Garth, near Cheltenham,
Gloucestershire.
There was criticism of Sir Sandy's lack of judgment and Mr Rifkind is
understood to have told him there was no longer confidence in his
abilities as a top-level budget holder responsible for a millions of
pounds.
Yesterday, Sir Sandy said he was taking early retirement in a bid to
relieve pressure on the RAF and his family.
''I have served the RAF loyally for 35 years and it is with great
regret that I have indicated to the Chief of the Air Staff my intention
to take early retirement,'' he said in the only public comment he has
been allowed to make on a controversy that has gone on for almost a
year.
It is understood Sir Sandy will retire officially in July with a
pension of around #50,000 a year and a lump sum payment of around
#150,000.
In the written statement, Mr Soames said later that Haymes Garth would
now be sold ''as soon as practicable''.
He emphasised that there was no question of ''illegality or culpable
impropriety'' at Haymes Garth or any of the other official residences
examined.
An audit had also found weaknesses in financial controls at several
other RAF homes, including Sir Sandy's previous house in Germany, on
which #302,000 was spent on refurbishment.
The MoD said there were ''serious systematic weaknesses in controls
and procedures'' at RAF Strike Command, which affected two official
residences.
Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark said it was a ''disgrace'' there
was no statement to the Commons yesterday and accused the Secretary of
State of ''cutting and running''.
He added that the issue raised ''serious questions'' about Mr
Rifkind's competence.
RAF friends of Sir Sandy said they did not question the fact that
mistakes had been made. What they were chiefly concerned about is that
Sir Sandy seems to have been made a scapegoat and the manner of the leak
to the Daily Telegraph.

NO electronic bugging devices have been found in an office provided
for Sinn Fein delegates involved in talks with Government officials at
Stormont in Belfast, police said last night.
The Sinn Fein team walked out on talks due to have been held
yesterday, claiming a scanner they had used in the room had picked up
signs of a monitoring device.
The room was sealed overnight on the orders of the Northern Ireland
Office and the RUC carried out a full search yesterday.
Nothing was found and a police spokesman said it was not unusual for
spurious readings to be given by scanners used in a building containing
a wide range of electrical equipment.
However, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said he had no confidence in
the findings.
No new date has yet been set for what would have been the sixth
meeting between Sinn Fein and officials.

TRANSPORT drivers yesterday protested against a ban on the export of
animals for slaughter.
About 40 empty transport vehicles arrived in convoy at Dover Docks,
causing long tailbacks of port and local traffic.
The protest was against Dover Harbour Board's ban on the export of
animals for slaughter and the shipping companies P&amp;O and Stena Sealink's
refusal to carry that traffic.
A crowd of 2000 animal rights protesters clashed with police in a bid
to stop the first lorry load of veal calves reaching the port at
Brightlingsea, Essex.
The town was brought to a standstill as the demonstrators blocked the
narrow road. A 78-year-old woman was arrested.
A Tory Euro-MP will ask the European Parliament next week to vote for
an immediate ban on veal crates for calves, writes Murray Ritchie,
European editor.
Mr James Provan, who was formerly the member for North-east Scotland
and who now represents an English constituency, is to call for a vote
after a European Commission statement on the veal trade during the
parliament's monthly plenary.
Mr Provan, an animal welfare campaigner, also wants maximum journey
times for animals being transported from Britain to slaughterhouses on
the Continent.
Most British Euro-MPs are expected to support the move.

Ayrshire MP George
Foulkes yesterday accused ScottishPower of ''chickening out'' of a
direct confrontation with him on the proposed electrical interconnector
between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Mr Foulkes was speaking after giving evidence at the public inquiry at
Ayr into the interconnector proposed by ScottishPower and Northern
Ireland Electricity.
In his evidence, Mr Foulkes, MP for Cumnock and Doon Valley, through
which the interconnector will pass, claimed that ScottishPower had
failed to demonstrate a clear need for the project at any stage since it
was first mooted.
ScottishPower's claim that the project would help address the economic
disadvantages of Northern Ireland and supply it with low-cost
electricity have been shown to be totally inaccurate, the MP contended.
He went on to say that the excuses put forward by the STUC, which is
backing the proposal -- that jobs in the Scottish coal industry would be
safer -- had only to be looked at in the context of ScottishPower's
''abysmal'' record in supporting Scottish coal in the past few years.
In his evidence to the inquiry yesterday, South of Scotland MEP Alex
Smith called into question ScottishPower and NIE claims that their
proposals accorded with the energy policies of the European Union.
Mr Smith said that an important EU objective is competition -- but
suggested that this appears to have been given little priority when the
interconnector proposal was put together.
The inquiry continues next week.

TWO airline executives, who defrauded their employer of hundreds of
thousands of pounds, were jailed yesterday.
Commercial manager Paul Massey, 53, and his deputy Alan Curtis, 49,
admitted conspiring to defraud Britannia Airways while working at its
central London office.
Massey, of Swabey Road, Earlsfield, south-west London, was jailed for
18 months and Curtis, of Harewood Gardens, Littledown, Bournemouth, for
eight months at Southwark Crown Court by Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC.
The pair stole the money by recruiting travel broker Henry Wolff, 69,
and taking 50% of the commissions the airline paid him for arranging
charter flights.
Wolff, of Marsh Road, Pinner, Middlesex, was jailed for eight months
for his part in the plot, suspended for two years because of his
relatively minor role.
Massey was said to have used some of the money to buy expensive homes
abroad. The court had heard that he operated several Swiss bank accounts
in different currencies. The main one, used to pay Curtis his cut, was
found to contain #216,000.
Curtis -- said to have been less involved in the plot -- gained
#100,000 from his part in the scheme, which ran for four years until
1991.
Mr David Farrer QC, prosecuting, said the plot came to an end after
they tried to involve another travel broker in their scheme.
After discovering the plot, the airline launched a successful civil
action to recover its losses.

RESIDENTS of a housing scheme, where a mother and three children died
this week in a fire, yesterday described their homes as death traps.
As Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro visited the scene, two
women started a petition to persuade Annandale and Eskdale Council to
provide safer windows.
Mrs Helen McQuaid, 46, of Shawhill Court, Annan, Dumfriesshire, said:
''These windows are death traps. They are on a swivel and do not open
fully. It would be almost impossible to get out in a fire and impossible
to push a child out in a panic.''
She said there had been an outcry about the windows in October 1991,
when a mother and her two children were rescued from a fire in a similar
house at Kimmeter Square in the same estate.
After the 1991 fire, Sir Hector, whose constituency includes Annan,
took up the issue of the windows with the council. He visited the house
on that occasion and was photographed at the bedroom window.
The council's general manager, Mr Bill Davidson, said last night:
''The houses conform to building standards. They are of a design that is
widely used in Scotland.''
In Wednesday's blaze at Shawhill Court, Elizabeth McPhillips, 17, died
along with her children, Sarah, 19 months, and John, eight months. A
friend's baby, Sophie Reid, six months, also died.
The mother and one of her children are believed to have been in an
upstairs bedroom, where the window measures only 20in by 33in.

A MODERN version of the old ''divvy'' was unveiled yesterday as the
latest weapon in the fast-escalating supermarket war.
Tesco, which recently completed its takeover of the William Low group,
is launching a scheme on Monday to reward customers according to the
amount they spend.
Its Clubcard, which has been on trial at 14 stores in the past year,
will allow customers to receive points as they pay for their shopping,
which are then converted into money-off vouchers at three-month
intervals.
One of Tesco's main rivals, Safeway, has been testing a similar scheme
in 25 of its stores, and will soon be extending the promotion.
Asda had no plans to follow suit but said: ''We have the technology if
we choose to go down that route.''
The schemes are a direct parallel of the dividend offered by
Co-operative stores until the early 1980s, either in a regular payment
or, latterly, in stamp form.
The Scottish Co-operative Society said yesterday that, while the
''divvy'' survived in the South of England, it had largely been replaced
by a members' privileges system.
Retail analyst Richard Perks, of Verdict Research, said of the Tesco
move: ''I think it may well boost sales -- at least until its rivals
bring in similar schemes. Tesco has been driven to this loyalty scheme
because of the fierce competition in the supermarket industry.''
Tesco chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin said: ''The Clubcard is a way of
thanking customers for shopping with us. At the same time, the
technology gives us a clearer picture of their likes and dislikes, which
helps us to give them an even better service.''
The scheme works by Tesco donating points for every #5 spent, after a
minimum amount of #10. Customers will receive two points for the first
#10 and one point for every #5 thereafter.
Clubcard holders hand their cards to the checkout operator before
their shopping is scanned and the points are added electronically to
their account. Vouchers will be sent every quarter to the holder's home
address and can be used to help pay for a later shopping bill.
Tesco said a customer spending #100 a week would collect 250 points in
three months, entitling the customer to savings of #12.50 a quarter.
Ms Lynne MacMillan, an official of the Scottish Consumer Council,
welcomed the new batch of schemes as benefiting shoppers.
''I think people doing a weekly shop are quite price-conscious and
this may well help woo them away from other supermarkets. However, I
doubt if savings alone will keep them at a particular store.''

THE process of clarification that has been sweeping through Sir Peter
Maxwell Davies's large-scale music in recent years continued to work its
course last night in the world premiere by the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra of the ninth of his Strathclyde Concertos, this one featuring
six solo wind instruments.
Some of the surface texture of the music might have sounded initially
complex (because of the six instruments in various combinations); but it
ain't. The lyricism of the last two concertos is still very much to the
fore, this time allied with the episodic structure and transparent
orchestral textures introduced in his Fifth Symphony, which was unveiled
last autumn.
The new concerto is a beauty: from its opening, melancholic lyricism
(almost recalling Tristan) it is a highly expressive work. Even in
complex combinations the six unusual solo instruments (piccolo and alto
flute, cor anglais, E flat and bass clarinets, and contrabassoon, played
by David Nicholson, Lis Dooner, Maurice Checker, Lewis Morrison, Ruth
Ellis, and Alison Green) are clearly deployed, curling round and
imitating each other.
The accompaniment for string orchestra is top-drawer Max: gleaming,
atmospheric music. Everything is lucid, clearly defined, focused.
Throughout there is a clearer sense of perspective -- foreground,
middleground, etc. Not a conventionally dramatic concerto, but an
instantly captivating one.
As was Peter Donohoe's account of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto,
which the pianist directed himself. Sure, with the soloist also
conducting there are lapses in impetus -- and the first movement
stretched a bit. But Donohoe's down-to-earth combination of poetic
playing and sheer dynamism provided a performance that was alive and
bristling, especially in an outstanding finale.

JUST over a year ago David Izod was told he had testicular cancer. For
most of 1994 he was in and out of hospital -- undergoing intensive
chemotherapy followed by major surgery -- and it is this experience, and
his reactions to it, that he explores in The Teratoma Show.
While musician Pete Williams provides an on-stage soundtrack (songs
and guitar) Izod describes, with honesty, insight, and humour, how
cancer invaded not just his body but his emotions and his entire
philosophy of life. It's a personal journey that has resonances for
everyone, since it takes in quite a few fears beyond the obvious one:
dying.
He captures, with a flourish of Hammer horror imagery, the unnerving
effect of clinical briskness on the novice patient. Shifts the fantasy
into chilling reality as he searches for words that will help us imagine
the awfulness of chemotherapy -- yet even here he finds ways of making
us laugh at the debilitating side effects of a treatment which in effect
poisons the entire system to kill off part of it.
He seeds hard fact into lively anecdote, provides significant
background information on testicular cancer and encouraging data on
effective cures. And he tells us about 18-year-old Rajeet, who was
admitted with a tumour the size of a small cauliflower in his scrotum .
. . and a life expectancy reduced to bits of borrowed time. It's the
diagnosis -- or lack of it -- which can kill more surely than the
disease itself.
There's real rage in this show -- Izod doesn't want to die, but he
certainly doesn't want to die from such a mindless, suicidal adversary
as cancer. And there's also great sincerity and gentleness -- as when he
lists the everyday pleasures he most yearns for in hospital or savours
the warmth of a sunlit convalescence he did not always believe he would
reach. This is a performance rooted in personal drama which is neither
self-indulgent, nor whiny with self-pity. Instead it amounts to a
celebration of the human spirit, a celebration of the joy of breathing
in and breathing out. Repeated tonight and at Paisley Arts Centre on
February 17. Pete Williams's music -- he was an original member of
Dexy's Midnight Runners -- is a treat in itself.

A SCOT has been appointed director of the National Lottery Sports
Fund, the body responsible for distributing an anticipated #1.6bn in
lottery proceeds to sport in England by the year 2000.
Mike Barron, from Alford, Aberdeenshire, the 53-year-old former chief
executive of Gordon District and director of leisure and recreation in
Monklands from 1974 to 1986, takes up the appointment immediately.
By the end of January, there had been more than 15,000 inquiries about
the funds he will disburse. About 400 applications and 30 completed
applications are arriving daily.
Mr Barron, a member of the Scottish Sports Council for 13 years, has a
reputation for securing grants from all over Europe.
Meanwhile, animal and environmental charities were up in arms after
learning that National Lottery cash was unlikely to find its way into
their coffers.
Organisations dealing with children, poverty, the disabled, the
unemployed, women's issues, and cultural minorities were included in a
list of high priorities for lottery funds.
However, the National Lottery Charities Board made no mention of
animal welfare or the environment.
Meanwhile, 15 people in Bellshill, Kilmarnock, and Ayr have reported
bogus telephone calls from a woman purporting to be from Camelot, and
asking them for details of their bank accounts.

LESS than a month after Perth Theatre's production of How the Other
Half Loves, Alan Ayckbourn is once more peeling back the curtains to
sneak a look at the foibles of surburban living. His is a world of
electric blankets, Cornish pasties, and paper napkins, where people
aspire to nothing more than being normal and getting on with their
friends. The typical Ayckbourn character may be dull, witty, obnoxious,
or well liked, but he is never out of the ordinary.
Behind this veneer of everyday life, what distinguishes Ayckbourn is
his ear for the surrealism of inconsequential conversation, his skill at
building ludicrous theatrical situations and, most important, his
ability to deal with sensitive subject matters in an unobtrusive way.
You've got to admire a man who can write a play called Bedroom Farce
which confronts the hazards and insecurities of sexual relationships and
yet which comes in such innocuous packaging that it would never occur to
anyone to add an ''adults only'' tag to it.
Despite a company with an impressive array of Ayckbourn credentials,
however, I don't quite feel that the play is done full justice here.
Sure, it's jolly enough, but the pace is slow to build up and we're well
into the second act before the comic momentum starts to be felt. Perhaps
it's Michael Holt's set, which solves the problem of having three
bedrooms on stage by placing one of them above the other two, at once
distant and dominating, or perhaps it's just the difficulty of building
up a rapport across such a fragmented plot.
There are several strong comic performances and lots of good laughs,
but oddly it's often the domestic strategy that dominates.

ONCE again Warwick Edwards has demonstrated impeccable research in
drawing together this Scottish Early Music Consort programme of medieval
songs reflecting love and war. Part One placed continental music from
the Crusades either side of three Scottish pieces while Part Two was a
musical portrait in miniature of Oswald Von Wolkenstein, a
fifteenth-century Tyrolean adventurer whose one remaining eye was
clearly on the damsels.
Scholarship yes, but from the opening rhythmic dance-song it was clear
this was going to be entertainment as well as an insight to the musical
footprint of the period.
Fiona Milne, Jeremy Taylor, and Alan Watt all entered enthusiastically
into the spirit of the programme singing with a sensitive understanding
of content. In particular Fiona Milne's unaccompanied voice breathed
life into the passion of the verses.
Alan Watt's enunciation ranged so fluidly over all the different
languages they each sounded like his native tongue, while Jeremy Taylor
proved at his strongest in characterisation. Playing from the
instrumentalists was consistently supportive, the ensemble refusing to
be fazed by a burst string on Kenneth Mitchell's viella early in the
first half.
Altogether this was a successful blend of the sacred with the profane
despite the especial bawdiness of Oswald Von Wolkenstein's verses after
the interval. And as in the first half Fiona Milne dazzled once again as
she sped through a tongue-twisting bestiary of animal and bird sounds
much to the delight of the well-filled house.

THE chief executive of Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow is leaving, just
months after the culmination of a successful battle to save it from
closure.
Miss Maggie Boyle, 39, who began her NHS career as a nursing auxiliary
at 17, is taking up a post in the summer with consultants Hay
Management.
She will head the new Health Service Work Transformation Unit, which
the firm is setting up to assist health service clients in designing and
managing organisational change.
''We will be targetting NHS trusts, private contractors -- anyone
providing a health care service,'' she said yesterday. ''It is all about
reducing costs and avoiding duplication without compromising the quality
of patient care. It doesn't necessarily mean cutting jobs.''
Miss Boyle has been in charge at Stobhill for four years, during most
of which it was under threat of closure as part of Greater Glasgow
Health Board's acute services strategy.
However, the board's preferred option in the strategy that is now out
for public consultation would retain the hospital.
''Now that the future is secure, the time has come to seek new
challenges,'' said Miss Boyle, who was short-listed but ultimately
turned down for the still-vacant post of general manager at the health
board.
However, she added: ''I still love the NHS dearly.''

SIR Ian Wood, the industrialist, last night wondered whether the
Thatcher years were too often maligned.
Sir Ian, last week voted the best example of a business leader in
Scotland by his peers, was speaking at the Junior Chamber, Aberdeen.
He said that while the late 70s saw some quite unacceptable features
of excessive trade union power, it had to be ensured that the
post-Thatcherite 90s avoided the excesses of the unacceptable face of
free enterprise.
''It has become fashionable to knock the Thatcher years, but there is
no doubt that they saw the revitalisation of industry, the
re-establishment of competitive enterprise, and a restoration of
management responsibility and pride in achievement.
''These have provided the basis for a much more competitive UK
industry on the world stage.
''The stream of excessive salaries and remuneration in equities, and
the few cases of abuse of management power which make today's headlines,
are the exceptions, but they get huge media coverage and we must
constantly be aware of business and industry's responsibilities, not
just to our shareholders and customers, but to all our employees and to
the communities we live and work in.''
He said the oil industry had brought its own culture of change but
Scottish and UK industry had to be aware that the world was changing at
an incredible pace and we had to change with it or be left behind as
Third World countries became more and more powerful.

THE Court of Criminal Appeal yesterday signalled a radical change of
approach in its handling of miscarriage of justice cases.
The decision delivered by Lord Hope, the country's senior judge, was
hailed by lawyers as a breakthrough and the most significant ruling
handed down by the appeal court for 15 years.
It may pave the way to reopening some of the most notorious cases in
which a miscarriage of justice has been alleged -- Ice Cream Wars pair
Joseph Steele and T C Campbell, and Raymond Gilmour, jailed for life 13
years ago for raping and murdering schoolgirl Pamela Hastie, are two
obvious examples.
Yesterday's decision to allow video enhancement evidence in the case
of Alan Church, jailed for eight years for a building society robbery,
follows condemnation of the appeal court for what critics alleged as a
too rigid and technical approach to alleged miscarriages.
The court decided to allow Church to bring additional evidence, even
though the same evidence could reasonably have been available at his
trial. Under the law as previously understood, Church's case would have
been thrown out.
His advocate, Mr Paul McBride, speaking as a member of the Bar's
Criminal Law Group, welcomed what he saw as a much more liberal and
flexible approach to the appeal system.
He said: ''This is the most significant decision of the Court of
Criminal Appeal in the last 15 years. The court, having now interpreted
its powers properly, has set the foundation for a more flexible criminal
appeal system.
''It allows for appeals to succeed, even if they do not satisfy the
very stringent requirements of the additional evidence test.''
Church was convicted at the High Court in Glasgow last June of robbing
the Alliance and Leicester Building Society in St Vincent Place,
Glasgow, of #930.
He was identified by three members of staff and a customer as the man
responsible, and a man looking like Church was shown on the security
video. However, experts now claim Church's face does not match that of
the robber.
Lord Hope, Lord Justice General, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and
Brand, said Church was appealing against his conviction on the ground
that this constituted significant additional evidence which would have
affected the jury's decision.
The Crown argued that before the court could look at additional
evidence it must be satisfied that the evidence could not reasonably
have been made available at the trial.
Lord Hope said there were two parts to the crucial legislation --
section 228(2) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, as amended
by the Criminal Justice Act of 1980.
The first provided that a convicted person could bring under review
ANY alleged miscarriage of justice and placed no limit on the types of
alleged miscarriage the appeal court might consider.
The second part dealt with additional evidence cases, with the
requirement that it must be evidence which could not have been made
available at the trial.
Until now, very little attention seemed to have been paid to the fact
that the two parts were linked and the practice had been for additional
evidence appeals to be presented in terms of the second, restricted
part.
In this case, Mr McBride, counsel for Church, had opened up the
question as to whether the second part of section 228(2) placed a fetter
on the the court when it considered additional evidence appeals.
Lord Hope, stating there were good public interest reasons why some
limit must be placed on fresh evidence appeals, said: ''But it is a
different matter if a reasonable explanation can be given for the
failure to adduce the evidence at the trial and the court may be able to
say, if it were to hear that evidence, that there was a miscarriage of
justice in the proceedings in which the appellant was convicted.
''In our opinion, the first part of section 228(2) is wide enough to
enable the court to entertain an appeal on that ground.''
The court will hear the expert evidence at a later date.

There are excellent feeds on the market these days, such as Miracle

WHILE deciduous shrubs and hedges are leafless, and herbaceous plants
are at a low ebb, it is an ideal time to find the source of bramble
seedlings -- and howk them out.
If you don't get them out by the roots they will rush into growth
again before long.
This, coupled with leaves developing on deciduous or semi-dormant
plants, will make finding the source all the more difficult.
Removing brambles is not a job for the faint-hearted. You need a
strong pair of gardening gloves and a long-sleeved jacket.
Brambles have very strong roots, and unless you can get a fork in, all
you may succeed in doing is pulling the top branches off and leaving the
roots intact.
You can be sure the loss of branches will in no way deter their
enthusiasm for growth. You can resort to systemic weedkillers, but they
don't act very quickly when the temperature is low.
In any case, you have to apply weedkillers specifically and accurately
to the bramble foliage, to be absorbed by the leaves.
Chemical weedkilling is worth a trial, but don't hold out too much
hope at this time of year.

Robben Island, Friday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela returned today to the Robben Island lime
quarry where he laboured for many of his 27 years in jail and said South
Africa owed it to the victims of apartheid to succeed.
Mandela, 76, led 1300 former political prisoners on a pilgrimage to
the island in Cape Town's Table Bay to mark tomorrow's fifth anniversary
of his release in 1990.
After an emotional reunion with fellow prisoners in the hot, white
quarry carved by thousands of apartheid foes, Mandela chipped at a rock
that will form the basis of a memorial cairn.
He later visited his old cell and unveiled a plaque that will mark the
cairn with the message: ''Embedded in these stones you will find the
pain of our struggle, the sorrow of losses and the foundation of our
victory.''
Wearing dark glasses to shield his eyes, which were damaged by the
fine dust and reflected sunlight of his years in the quarry, Mandela
said his sorrow was that so many who died under apartheid had failed to
see the transition to democracy.
''We have come here to celebrate the human spirit, which enabled us to
face some of the most brutal abuses of human rights,'' he told
reporters.
''All that we can do in order to honour (the victims) is to ensure
that the new battle we are fighting of ensuring a better life for all
our people is fought and won. We have already made a very good start,''
he said.
Mandela worked on the island for 18 years until 1982, when he was
transferred to a mainland jail.
His African National Congress won the first all-race elections last
April, but shares power with the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party and
the white-led National Party of former president F W de Klerk.
Officials said de Klerk and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi
declined invitations to attend the reunion.
Island veterans from neighbouring Namibia joined the pilgrimage
organised by the independent Peace Vision group, which wants Mandela to
approve a permanent international peace institute on the bleak prison
island.
Peace Vision director Na-iem Dollie said the reunion was financed by
40 white businessmen who paid 30,000 rand (#5800) each to join the trip.
Former prisoners hugged each other and exchanged memories, some
painful and some humorous, as they pointed out landmarks such as a
breakwater where they were forced to collect guano.
''It's like a dream to me,'' said prison veteran Anthony Gazi as he
stepped ashore on the concrete pier that was for thousands of apartheid
foes a first view of the jail.
Younger men in ethnic clothing or jeans greeted each other with jokes
about the food and the insults they had had to take from prison warders.
But three old men in threadbare suits walked silently hand-in-hand
beneath the stone arch leading to the prison.
George Hobana, a 67-year-old petrol pump attendant, was seeing the
island for the first time since he completed a sentence in 1967 for
blowing up schools, beer halls and a bridge.
''I'm feeling very bad because I don't like to see this place. I feel
angry because they are very bad things that happened to us here,'' he
said.
Some of the veterans went to the island's beach, where they waded and
collected stones.
''We are doing this because we were never allowed to when we were here
as prisoners,'' said former prisoner Peter Jacobs.
A prison warder said that conditions had improved greatly for the 762
ordinary criminals now held in the barracks-like jail.--Reuter.

THE gradual lengthening of the days has a profound influence on growth
of plants. Theoretically, it should stimulate gardeners into action,
too.
Sadly, nothing much is happening just yet, although there are a few
things you can usefully do in the meantime. Though simple tasks, they
will pay big dividends.
Priority should be given to checking that piece of apparatus which
faithfully cuts your grass from spring to autumn, and has probably been
lying unattended for months.
Lawnmowers vary in their cutting modes, but fall into two basic types:
cylinder and rotary.
The action of a cylinder depends on the cutting blades skimming the
sole plate. If both are sharp and properly adjusted, there is a clean
cutting action.
If the reverse is true, the result is grass being chewed rather than
cut.
If the mower is petrol driven, make sure the supply is shut off. At
the same time, detach the lead to the plug.
Next, turn the mower on its side and have a close look at the cutting
blades and sole plate. Insert a piece of writing paper between blades
and plate. Turn the blades slowly.
If all is well, the paper is cut cleanly. You can try this at various
points along the sole plate. It will often be found adjustment is
uneven, or the sole plate is bent or worn.
If cutting takes place cleanly overall, you haven't much to worry
about. All that is needed is a good clean-up with an oily rag.

<RECORDNO>979910904</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LAWYER yesterday launched a ferocious criticism of the Royal
Infirmary, Glasgow, where a man died after being kept waiting for a bed.
Mr John McGowan, 67, a retired miner of Prosen Street, Tollcross,
Glasgow, died in the hospital in January last year.
A fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court has heard that,
because of staff shortages, there was no intensive care unit bed
available and doctors delayed Mr McGowan's operation.
When his condition deteriorated, they had to operate but Mr McGowan
died on the operating table from a ruptured aneurysm in his aorta.
Mr Gerald Carrol, the advocate representing the dead man's family,
described Mr McGowan as a quiet and reserved man who waited patiently
for more than three hours for treatment and did not complain.
Mr Carroll said: ''He trusted in the NHS, to which he had given two of
his three daughters who are nurses.
''He was a man who placed his trust in the ability of the hospital to
look after him properly and it was not acceptable that a major hospital
like the Royal should have failed to provide for him.''
Mr Carrol referred to evidence which revealed that for 80 minutes a
consultant physician telephoned other hospitals in an unsuccessful to
find an intensive care unit (ICU) bed for Mr McGowan.
He continued: ''When James McGowan died, he was only a man who
throughout his working life had, by dint of his income tax and national
health service contributions, played a part in what could be described
as a national lottery and, when the time came to collect his prize --
much needed treatment in hospital -- the machine wasn't plugged in.
''One could argue about figures and percentages but if Mr McGowan had
been operated on earlier, he would have had a chance of survival.
''The reason he wasn't was the lack of ICU beds. The reality was, that
was a disaster waiting to happen.
''Over 10 years ago, there were more ICU beds than in January 1994,
when Mr McGowan died.''
Mr Carrol pointed out that doctors in the hospital had complained
about the lack of beds and added: ''The reality is that this hospital
took no satisfactory steps to assess the needs for such beds.
''They had a chart showing the occupancy of the beds but it did not
reflect the number of refusals.
''On January 29, out of six patients who couldn't get a bed -- Mr
McGowan was the fifth -- four of them died and two survived.
''It is a matter of public concern that nobody seemed to be keeping
track of patients turned away. It maybe a case of out of sight, out of
mind.''
Mr Carroll described the efforts of doctors trying to locate ICU beds
in other hospitals as a ''game of pass the human parcel''. He said no
serious thought had been given to its effect on patients.
Since Mr McGowan's death, the number of permanently staffed beds had
been increased from five to seven.
He suggested that one of the reasons behind this decision might have
been that there was no space in the ward for more than seven beds.
Mr Carrol referred to the evidence of Mr John Pollock, the senior
vascular consultant at the Royal. He had told the inquiry that he had
considered asking local radio stations to broadcast advice to people not
to turn up at hospital during times when it was too busy.
He added: ''This hospital is living on its past reputation and
glories. Perhaps it should put a sign up saying there is ''no room at
the inn''.
''Having heard this inquiry, the question which the family clearly
wish answered is whether this tragedy could happen again.
''As the matter stands at the moment, it is not possible to discount
that possibility.''
Sheriff John McGowan will give his determination in writing later.

PENSIONERS faced with ruin after Robert Maxwell plundered their
pension funds learned last night that a #276m deal had been agreed to
restore their financial security.
More than three years after the press tycoon's body was found floating
in the Atlantic, the trustees of his company pension funds announced
that a group of major City institutions had agreed to settle claims.
The deal ended years of ''mental turmoil'' for 32,000 people who had
worked for Maxwell companies and had learned after his death that he had
raided the pension coffers to the tune of an estimated #440m.
Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners' Action Group,
representing 20,000 Maxwell pensioners, said: ''Obviously this is
tremendous news. These people can get on with living their lives.''
With #100m already recovered, plus payments from the Government to
cover the Guaranteed Minimum Pension, the rescue deal was welcomed by
trustees as making up virtually all the shortfall.
All 5000 members of the Maxwell Communication Pension Plan -- staff
from more than 150 Maxwell-owned companies -- ''can now look forward to
receiving their pensions, thanks to the settlement'', said a spokesman
for the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, trustees for the plan.
The settlement was welcomed in statements by City institutions whose
dealings with Robert Maxwell had led to legal action by trustees.
It was also welcomed by the Mirror Group, which said the deal --
subject to detailed contracts and court approval -- would allow it to
release more than #100m of the provision it had made to cover its
pension scheme deficit.
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley said: ''I am pleased that the
exceptional measures taken by the Government to help the pensioners have
ensured that pensions stayed in payment while discussions took place.''
The Maxwell Pensioners' Trust -- set up by the Government in June 1992
-- was understood to have enough money to continue to support pension
payments while discussion of detailed terms and conditions took place,
he said.

THE death of the wife of Mr Henry McLeish, MP, was marked in Kirkcaldy
yesterday by politicians from across the spectrum, along with relatives
and friends. Margaret McLeish died earlier this week from cancer, aged
47.
Labour leader Tony Blair attended. Other mourners included members of
Fife regional and Kirkcaldy district councils. About 300 people paid
their respects
outside as the service took place. Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown
praised Mrs McLeish for her friendship, courage, and support to many,
and for her love of her family and Scotland.
The Rector of Buckhaven High, where the couple met, attended, along
with Jimmy Bonthrone, former manager of East Fife FC, for whom Mr
McLeish, the Fife Central MP, was a professional footballer.

AFTER A recent car trip along the Bonny Banks to Glendarroch -- or
should I say Luss -- top marks are due not only to the road engineers,
but to the landscapers involved.
This is especially true around the car park area at Luss, which has
been well planted with a variety of shrubs.
Copious use has been made of mulching materials, such as rough forest
bark, and what I suspect is spent mushroom compost.
There was, unfortunately, also a mulch of beer cans and chip bags in
one particular bed. It shows a complete disregard some sectors of the
public have for attractive scenic areas.
Mulching is definitely the in-thing these days. It helps the
development of shrubs by retaining moisture on the surface.
At the same time, it controls weeds effectively, provided the land has
been cleaned at the outset and the mulch is deep enough.
Intensive mulching does not come cheaply. Various grades of forest
bark are available.
You can expect to pay anything between #5-#6.50 for an 80-litre bag.
This will give good cover over about four square yards, according to how
heavily you spread it on.
If you need a large amount, you can buy in bulk to be dumped on
pavement or driveway, but that will mean extra work.
The 80-litre bags are convenient to handle, and for that matter to
pick up in the boot of the car.
It is an excellent time now to get busy with mulching. Should you have
a serious perennial weed problem because of couch grass, horsetail, or
other obnoxious creeping weeds, chemical weed control should come first.
In the case of rose beds, deep mulching can help with control of
blackspot. I would suggest treating the ground with Armillatox around
the roses first.
You may find the roses will need a bit of extra feeding, because the
nitrogen is being appropriated by the bark in its decomposition
processes.
Don't expect mulching to last for ever. The coarser it is, the longer
it will last. Other materials can be used, but they may bring
nutritional problems.
This includes sawdust, leaves, chopped straw, wood chips, and any
other relatively dense organic material.

THERE was a time when, unless you got in a big load of farmyard manure
-- known as FYM -- for feeding your land, you were not considered to be
doing things properly.
Alas, farmyard manure in variable quality, plus weeds and other
troubles it can bring in, has tended to depopularise this material to a
large extent.
Apart from that, farmers spread most of it on to their own land as
slurry. It is often not readily available.
Despite its drawbacks, FYM has many virtues. It supplies a range of
balanced plant food over a period, and its physical nature improves the
texture of land.
One problem is that it must be dug in, and with rotary cultivators so
popular, using FYM is not really on.
In this environmental age there is a lot of interest in compost, but
amounts tend to be limited. Quality can be extremely variable.
It is no wonder gardeners turn to composted hen manure in its various
forms and guises. It is a convenient way of feeding the land.
Even so, there are still many adherents for fertilisers such as
National Growmore with its balanced 7:7:7 analysis.
Alas, chemically-based fertilisers don't do much to improve the
physical nature of the land.
Many people will also swear that they do not produce as tasty
vegetables as those grown by organic means.
Apart from digging in your FYM, don't be in too much of a rush to
apply other types of organic fertilisers, or for that matter chemical
ones.
0
Application in March or April, when growth is starting, is soon
enough.

IT IS a problem to know what to do about lawns at this time of year.
Despite the odd cold snap, grass has been growing strongly and is
getting distinctly lanky.
The problem is finding the surface dry enough to allow cutting without
scarring. Even walking on lawns can cause damage. The surface is
squelchy.
Don't miss a chance for a cut. Given a few dry days, it may be
possible to give the lawn a light trim.
Rotary cutters, especially of the hover type, are better than
conventional cylinder mowers at this time.
The requirement is to be able to give the grass a cut, and do it
safely.

Sarajevo, Friday
MUSLIM-led government troops and Bosnian Serb units fought pitched
battles today with tanks, artillery and ground forces in Bosnia's Bihac
enclave for control of water supplies to Bihac town.
Sniper fire also crackled out in a western suburb of Sarajevo, which
was jolted by the most serious violation of a six-week-old ceasefire
last night when Serb forces unleashed a brief mortar barrage.
The arrest on spying charges of a Serb woman working for the United
Nations relief mission brought the expected retaliation from the Serbs
who blocked UN aid convoys.
In Zagreb, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said he wanted Nato
troops to monitor Croatia's borders with Bosnia and Serbia when UN
peacekeepers leave the country after March 31.
Clashes flared in Bihac this morning 10 miles west of Bihac town. They
spread to Klokot village, which troops of the Muslim-led government
attacked on January 14 to secure a well supplying Bihac town.
''At the moment, this attack threatens the retaking of the town water
supply,'' UN spokesman Graham Day said.
One Serb soldier was killed and six wounded, Bosnian Serb forces told
Reuters at their headquarters in Pale.
The clashes violate a ceasefire that has generally held elsewhere in
Bosnia since January 1 - Reuter.

Give your audience
ammunition to combat the
killing of the imagination
happening every day
Negotiations for The
Castle broke down, giving
rise to more than a suspicion
of personal politics
John Linklater looks at possible conflicts between artistic director
Kenny Ireland's continuing involvement with The Wrestling School and his
fixed base at the Lyceum
KENNY Ireland has always felt compelled to get in on the hustle. That
instinct imprinted a pattern on his career long before he ever took over
as artistic director of the Royal Lyceum 26 months ago. It was a job he
had always wanted, but running an establishment theatre has had to
subdue some of his more combative passions. This year he found an outlet
in London, Berlin, and Paris.
In these cities he has continued an artistic affair. Few really
imagined that he would relinquish a long-established dalliance with The
Wrestling School and the work of controversial playwright Howard Barker.
The surprise is that he has not yet flaunted it before Edinburgh
audiences, although that will change soon. The hustle has lain in
preparing the introduction of something faintly illicit.
It is his production for The Wrestling School of Barker's play The
Castle. It opened at the Hebbel Theater, Berlin, last week before
continuing a European and British tour at L'Odeon, Paris. Along with
Barker's own production of Hated Nightfall (seen last year at The
Tramway, Glasgow), and a new production of a smaller-scale Barker piece,
Judith, which is being rehearsed on the road, the tour will reach
Manchester, Sheffield, Leicester, Copenhagen, Plymouth, Brighton, and
Lisbon. Somewhere in the middle of that schedule, for four nights from
May 3, it will infiltrate the Royal Lyceum.
The reception remains to be seen, for Barker is a challenging writer
whose work generates more excitement outside Britain, and there is
little to suggest that the Lyceum audience is ready to abandon its
innate conservatism, but Ireland has been working hard to change the
profile and The Castle could be a major strategic breakthrough. The more
obvious Scottish leg for the tour would have been a Mayfest run at The
Tramway, where a hard-core support for Barker and The Wrestling School
has been forged over several years, but negotiations for The Castle
broke down, giving rise to more than a suspicion of personal politics.
A provocation here may be the role of the now Amsterdam-based Neil
Wallace as executive producer of The Wrestling School tour, his first
involvement since his departure from The Tramway after what he now
describes as ''losing a battle within the structure''. Bob Palmer, who
heads Glasgow's Department of Performing Arts, maintains that the costs
involved were too high to bring the production to The Tramway, but the
''commitment'' to the future work of Barker will be maintained. Wallace
says: ''I think it is a great pity that the work of one of the greatest
contemporary writers in the English language can't fit into a Mayfest
programme, but festival director Paul Bassett has every right to do what
he likes with a key venue like The Tramway''.
This kind of squabble mystifies European theatre producers and
critics, who believe they recognise in Barker a creator of a brilliant
literary achievement in the best tradition of British theatre. They
cannot understand why his reputation is not more secure at home. They
envy the substance and poetry offered by his texts, an attractive
counterpoint to a European theatre increasingly of style and image
rather than content. The prestigious Schaubuhne Theater of Berlin has
this week called for new German translations of Barker's work with a
view to producing, and Heiner Muller at the Berliner Ensemble is a huge
fan of Barker.
This has reflected in the German reviews from the current tour. ''A
refractory, provocative, and all-round remarkable writer,'' said Die
Welt in its January 20 review of Hated Nightfall at The Hebbel. ''A
brilliant mixture of language, music, and extreme theatre,'' enthused
the Berliner Morgenspost. Screenwriter Paul Mayersberg, who scripted The
Man Who Fell To Earth and Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence, turned up in
Berlin last week and described Barker approvingly as a ''scholastic
punk''.
This contrasts with the grudging, knowing, deeply suspicious reviews
in the British national press when The Castle previewed earlier last
month for a few nights at the Riverside, London. The easy objection to
Barker is that he is too clever by half and his language is
scatological. Charles Spencer in the Daily Telegraph said: ''Barker
seems heroically determined to offend almost everyone''. Even Michael
Billington, who evidently tries hard to be fair in the Guardian, is
forced to concede a kind of defeat with The Castle. ''Watching it you
can see why Barker, like Edward Bond, is often more honoured abroad than
at home,'' he chides. ''For all his use of a muscular, imagistic
prose-poetry, he belongs to an essentially European tradition in which
allegorical meaning is more important than surface realism.''
Neil Wallace dismisses all this as the response of the ''Little
Englanders''. Barker may have long since learned to be philosophical
about the neglect he suffers after first the Royal Court and then the
Royal Shakespeare Company dropped their support after initial
encouragement. It was precisely to redress this problem that The
Wrestling School was formed in 1989. The instigators were the Scottish
actor Hugh Fraser and Kenny Ireland. They approached Barker. The company
would bring together a wide group of actors, many of them of the highest
calibre, who were ready to champion his work.
This explains the attraction of the hustle for Ireland. As the company
name suggests, setting up a school to establish a style of performance
for Barker's work has necessarily involved a struggle to gain an
armlock. From the start it has been an embattled position against
reactionary taste governing what is presented in British theatres.
Another Scottish actor, Ian McDiarmid, whose performance as Dancer in
Hated Nightfall mesmerised the Berlin audiences, has stated the position
succinctly. ''Barker appeals directly to actors and audiences,'' he
contends. ''The difficulties lie with those in between.''
Barker regards the Scottish connection as confirming rather than
refuting a reputation he is happy to accept as a ''Euro'' writer. He
says: ''I think I'm very much a European writer, which means that Scots,
French, and Germans would take to me more naturally than the English,
who I regard as a very parochial and, frankly, quite a philistine
culture. The level of criticism in England is quite philistine. The
choice of work by our national companies is philistine. I am delighted
to be taken up by Europeans, by Scots and other Europeans.
''I don't want to risk my neck by wandering into national stereotypes,
but there is something very passionate about Kenny Ireland and Ian
McDiarmid. As actors and directors they are very passionate. They are
not subdued, and they react to these texts in the way that good actors
react to them, which is to seize on them as an opportunity for a public
kind of theatre, a demonstrative theatre.''
Kenny Ireland's connection with Howard Barker goes back to 1980 when
he was an actor in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of The
Loud Boy's Life. Although he had a small part he had fallen in love with
the work. Barker, the author, exchanged pleasantries at the last night's
party for the show. Two years later he found the bulky actor on the
doorstep of his Brighton home, looking for a script. Ireland was on a
mission for Joint Stock, the progressive London company who advocated
total collaboration between author, director, actors, and designers.
They normally used a workshop method to devise pieces through
rehearsals, but this time it had fallen through and Ireland had been
dispatched to find a new finished text.
Ireland takes up the story: ''We had lost a workshop and I went down
to Brighton to try to dig up Howard. At that stage he was a bit out in
the critical wilderness. I asked him what he had got, so he went into a
desk drawer and produced three classic texts, Crimes In A Hot Country,
Victory, and The Castle. I took all three and devoured them. They were
astonishing.''
Joint Stock's 1983 production of Victory, in which Ireland played the
meaty part of Ball, was a landmark of British theatre writing, confirmed
in the revival which Ireland directed for The Wrestling School in 1991.
The intervening transitional period was crucial for both the fortunes of
Barker and Ireland. Barker had to some extent survived as an alternative
writer who commanded a heavily commited following through The Wrestling
School, the only company in Britain devoted to the work of a single
playwright (not even the RSC practises such exclusivity). Ireland, as
the company's artistic director, commanded a healthy reputation.
His approach had always been to establish a definitive style of
performance for Barker's work, and to broaden the constituency of its
audience. It was a seductive method, enlisting a brilliant sound
designer, Matthew Scott, and a wizard of the lighting board, Ace
McCarron, the Glasgow-born designer who will direct Judith on the
current tour. Ireland summarises the role of The Wrestling School in his
programme note: ''Its aim since its inception has been to give this work
the fullest range of expression, befitting its complexity both in
language and in imagery. Barker's poetic idiom, the investment in a
language created for the theatre, makes intense demands on actors'
traditional skills. Its high emotional pitch tests equally their energy
and invention.''
When Ireland was interviewed for the Lyceum job of artistic director
in 1992 there was no disputing his credentials, but there was alarm at
the prospect of his deluging the theatre with Barker. Once installed he
said that he would wait for the chance to present the work. The
necessary precondition, he suggested, would be the establishment of
trust with his audience.
Since then Ireland has hustled at the Lyceum to considerable effect.
He won an internal power struggle with the departure of general manager
Roger Spence. He managed to secure the agreement of Edinburgh District
Council to waive a #1m capital deficit through the previous regime's
programme of refurbishments. Pragmatic co-productions have been mounted
with Dundee Repertory and the Brunton Theatre. In the year up to last
April he had attracted an audience increase of 11,000, and while
competition with the newly opened Festival Theatre will dent further
increases, it is clear that progress is being made, an impression
confirmed in the 3.7% increase in annual revenue announced this week by
the Scottish Arts Council.
Onstage, Ireland's policy has been to move more gently. He has
exercised clout to bring in Brian Cox and long-term associate Bill
Paterson as associate artists, and box-office stars David Rintoul and
Vivien Heilbron as guest actors. The only misjudgment was to recruit his
mentor William Gaskell as director of the Edinburgh Festival
co-production Armstrong's Last Goodnight, sparking virtual insurrection
within a strong Scottish cast. Ireland accepts that it didn't work. On
this episode he remains terse: ''Bill Gaskell didn't get the best from
the Scottish community of actors. And the Scottish acting community
didn't get the best from Bill Gaskell.''
An important development has been the search for a younger audience at
the Lyceum. An audience survey in autumn 1993 established that 47% who
attended three productions, The Sunshine Boys, The Master Builder, and
Midsummer Night's Dream, were under the age of 35, a statistic Ireland
is determined to build upon. The two biggest box-office returns, out of
the 22 plays he has put on since he arrived, have been To Kill A
Mockingbird and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, both directed by Caroline
Hall, and both attracting a substantial school-age audience within
houses above 70%. While encouraging, these successes do not particularly
suggest a natural bridge to the work of Howard Barker.
Nevertheless, a strong contemporary flavour is edging into the Lyceum
repertoire. The productions exchanged with Dundee, Dancing At Lughnasa
and Death And The Maiden, were far better than the third-string touring
versions of these big West End hits of recent years. The opportunistic
formula is being revived to bring David Mamet's Oleanna as a Lyceum
production, and it will be the big talking-point production to precede
The Castle when the tour reaches Edinburgh in the first week of May. The
hope for an immediate spin-on may yet prove sound strategy.
But Ireland refuses to differentiate the potential appeal of Barker
with mainstream theatre, and he sees no contradiction between his
continuing involvement with The Wrestling School and his fixed base at
the Lyceum. In Berlin he commented: ''I don't see it as a conflict.
Whatever I gain out of The Wrestling School actually informs what I do
at the Lyceum. In this city Heiner Muller says that now is the time to
turn the theatre into a space for the imagination. In order to give your
audience ammunition to combat the killing of the imagination that is
happening every day. This is a truly political act, even if the material
has no political immediacy.
''Howard Barker gives me that strength. Heiner Muller gives me that
strength. Then I return to Edinburgh and I run a rep. But it's still the
same strength. I still want to convince people that they will come into
the Lyceum and go boom! And their imagination lifts off.''

Grozny, Friday.
RUSSIAN planes bombed the outskirts of Grozny today and Chechen
defenders dug in to try to stop Moscow's troops driving south out of the
capital.
Six Russian bombers pounded Argun, 10 miles east of Grozny. Black
smoke poured from a burning car and a residential building in the town,
now mostly deserted but once home to 30,000 people.
Argun, virtually linked to the capital by strips of built-up
territory, is still held by Chechen irregulars and has been the scene of
intense fighting in the past few days.
Interfax yesterday quoted Chechen sources as saying Chechen military
headquarters would be moved to Argun.
An oil dehydrogenation plant two miles south of Argun, at Mesker-Yurt,
was still burning after being bombed early this morning.
''There was only a tonne of oil left in the storage tanks which we
couldn't pump out. It didn't make much sense to bomb it,'' said plant
chief Abdullah Usmanov, surveying the damage.
Chechen fighters, who have mostly quit their ruined capital, were
digging in south of the city to try to cut off what they expect will be
a Russian drive into the rebel-held countryside.
They had mined a main road leading south out of the capital to hobble
any Russian advance along the road towards Shali, a stronghold 15 miles
south of Grozny.
The town has considerable strategic value because it lies near the
foot of the Caucasus mountains, from where the Chechens say they are
ready to wage an Afghanistan-style guerrilla campaign against the
Russians.
''They (the Russians) tried moving down the road last night, but we
forced them to retreat,'' said Khamid, a smiling rebel with a grenade
launcher slung over his shoulder.
The Chernorechiye and Aldy districts in the southwest corner of the
city, the only areas of Grozny still under Chechen control, were
relatively quiet this afternoon except for sporadic shell explosions.
Earlier, a Chechen military official told Interfax news agency rebel
fighters were leaving ambush units in Grozny to harass Russian troops.
President Boris Yeltsin read a report on the situation in Chechnya to
leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kazakhstan's
capital Alma-Ata today.
No details were released, but Kazakh leader Nursultan Nazarbayev told
a post-summit news conference Moscow was actively seeking ways to end
the fighting.
In Moscow, liberal member of parliament Gleb Ponomaryov showed
reporters a fax he received earlier today from Chechen military
commander Aslam Mashkhadov offering a ceasefire.
''The leadership of the Chechen armed forces is ready to hold talks
with the Russian military commanders on the following issues -- a
ceasefire to withdraw the dead, exchange of wounded without conditions,
exchange of prisoners and offering humanitarian aid to the local
population,'' said the message to Russian military commanders.
It was not clear whether the message, dated February 10, had reached
the Russian military.
And Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma's defence committee,
told reporters he had received death threats over his opposition in the
lower house to the Chechnya campaign.
Russia lifted a state of emergency, declared in November 1992, in
North Ossetia and Ingushetia but vowed to keep the security measures in
place in the two North Caucasus regions, which neighbour rebel Chechnya,
Interfax news agency said.
The CIS pledged to nip armed conflicts in the bud and end years of
ethnic unrest, but failed to take collective action on the war in
Chechnya.
CIS leaders, while avoiding judgment on the Kremlin's use of force to
crush Chechen separatists, supported a proposal by Kazakh leader
Nazarbayev to promote peace and stability in the 12-member grouping.
The CIS, formed in 1991 from the ashes of the Soviet Union, took a
hands-off approach to the Chechen conflict in apparent deference to
Russia, its most powerful member.
Nazarbayev's peace and stability proposal justified efforts to
preserve territorial integrity. But it also opposed settlement of
disputes by force - Reuter.

Washington, Friday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's embattled choice for top medical policy
adviser pledged today to stand fast against anti-abortion groups trying
to sink his nomination and accused them of distorting his record.
''I am standing strong -- and I appreciate the strong support of the
president,'' Dr Henry Foster said as he fought to pull his nomination
for surgeon general out of political quicksand.
''My opponents say that this nomination is about abortion. I have
dedicated my medical career to taking all appropriate medical steps to
meet the health needs of my patients, and that includes performing legal
abortions,'' Foster said in a speech to an ethusiastic meeting of
medical students and faculty at the capital's George Washington
University.
He said he, like Clinton, believed that abortions should be ''safe,
legal and rare''.
Foster, a Tennessee-based obstetrician known for his work on public
health and combatting teenage pregnancy, added: ''My life's work has
been dedicated to making sure that young people don't have to face the
choice of having abortions.''
But his cause appeared to suffer a blow as he was trying to make his
case when Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware announced he would vote
against the nomination -- the first member of Clinton's Democratic party
to take that stand in the Senate, which must confirm the nomination by
majority vote.
''It was a political blunder in the extreme (to nominate Foster),''
said Biden. ''He (Clinton) shouldn't have sent him up. I'm going to vote
against him.''
Later today, Biden recanted, saying he had acted in a fit of pique.
''My comments concerning the nomination of Dr Foster were a reflection
of my anger and frustration with the way the White House has handled
this nomination,'' Biden said in a statement read by a White House
spokeswoman.
Senators including Republican Arlen Specter spoke up on Foster's
behalf. He also won endorsements from the American Medical Association,
a black doctors' group and Congress's Black Caucus. Foster, a black, met
with the caucus today.
It all added up to a rising political cross-fire that suggested this
was fast becoming another of the nomination nightmares the Clinton White
House has seen several times before. Prior embarrassments have erupted
over nominees for attorney general, defence secretary and lower posts.
In Foster's case, what appeared to be a safe choice exploded when
anti-abortion groups pounced on evidence that he had performed some
abortions during his career as an obstetrician.
Foster confirmed that he had, noting the procedure is not only legal
but a constitutional right. But he gave his critics more rope by making
vague, changing statements as to how many he had performed and under
what circumstances.
That enabled some political critics to sidestep the volatile abortion
debate per se and argue that the real issue was Foster's credibility and
the competence of White House staff work that failed to examine Foster's
abortion record.--Reuter.

Managua, Friday
A BRITON and an American have been kidnapped by an armed group of
bandits in northern Nicaragua, an army said today.
About 15 troops loyal to the rebel leader Charro captured Sarah
Howard, a British citizen, and an American called Hicks yesterday, an
army spokesman said.
0 ''They (the hostages) were from an international organisation that
is performing a study of the countryside in the area,'' he said.
The kidnappings took place near San Jose de Bocay, about 150 miles
north of Managua, Sandoval said.
The kidnappers were requesting that the Catholic Church, an
Organisation of American States mission, and local news reporters be
summoned to the area to negotiate the safe return of the hostages.
Several hundred men armed with military weaponry continue to roam the
mountainous northern countryside of Nicaragua.
Authorities consider them to be common criminals rather than political
guerrillas, because they have not laid out political demands.--Reuter

THE director of Glasgow School of Art yesterday maintained that a
''greed is good'' philosophy was undermining public services.
Professor Dugald Cameron's criticism of the drive for profit was
underlined by Councillor Charles Gordon, convener of Strathclyde's
transport committee, who ridiculed prospects of privatisation of
ScotRail by early next year.
Both men upset protocol by making their pronouncements during a
train-naming ceremony in Glasgow.
Professor Cameron told guests that both the art school and railways
were ''suffering from a sustained assault by a Government stupidly
determined to undermine public services'', and added: ''It has
transformed public services into one of private greed.''
He was standing beside a ScotRail train given the nameplate Glasgow
School of Art, to mark the school's 150th anniversary.
He went on to question Government ideology behind the bid to split up
the railways. He said it was ''utterly ludicrous'' for the Government to
spend #700m on the privatisation process when British Rail would have
only #100m for capital investment in the next financial year.
Councillor Gordon, in his public address, said he hoped Strathclyde
region's long, productive association with ScotRail would continue --
provided 29 ''intractable problems'' connected with the franchising
process and 129 more over local government reorganisation could be
resolved.
He warned later that the council, which subsidises the largest
commuter network outside London, would refuse to compromise over
Government pressures to accept that timetables and quality requirements
should be flexible.
Strathclyde's response to any complaints that it was delaying rail
privatisation would be: ''Tough.''
He forecast that it would be impossible for the Government to
privatise ScotRail as planned next year, because of doubts over funding
the network.
Councillor Gordon argued that no-one would be prepared to bid for the
seven-year franchise within the Government time-scale, because of
financial doubts over subsidy levels guaranteed only until April next
year.
ScotRail's director, Mr Chris Green, who attended the naming ceremony,
declined to comment.

A GLASGOW man made legal history at Ayr Sheriff Court, yesterday, when
he was found guilty of committing perjury while giving evidence on his
own behalf at his own trial.
Craig Milne, 28, of Castlebay Terrace, Milton, was prosecuted for
giving false evidence at the trial in January, 1993.
People have been allowed to give evidence on their own behalf since
1898, but no-one found guilty at their original trial has subsequently
been prosecuted for giving false evidence at that trial, until
yesterday.
At the original trial, Milne was jailed for six months after being
found guilty of driving while disqualified and without insurance.
A further indictment relating to an attempt to pervert the course of
justice by supplying the police with a false name and address and a
minor parking offence was not called.
He pleaded not guilty originally, lodging defences of alibi and
incrimination.
But he changed his plea after the evidence of two key witnesses in the
defence case.
Depute fiscal Mrs Margaret Paton had earlier told the court how the
prosecution for perjury came about. She claimed that on the second day
of the original trial, she was approached by Milne's solicitor Mr Brian
Greig and told that, if she dropped the charges relating to his client
having no insurance, Milne would plead guilty.
When questioned by her fellow fiscal, Mr Wallace Montgomery, she said:
''Possibly he was offering me a deal, but he was asking me to do
something which I wouldn't have ever considered doing.''
Mr Greig said in evidence that he found the evidence given by Mrs
Paton ''quite extraordinary''. He denied offering a deal based on the
dropping of the insurance charge because he said it was such a minor
charge relative to driving while disqualified that it would have been
nonsensical to have based any deal on it.
Mrs Paton said after the original trial she referred the case to her
fiscal, Mr Noel O'Brien, who then contacted the Crown Office. They
decided to press charges of perjury, and Milne was arrested as he
emerged from prison.
Sheriff Francis Keane called for social inquiry reports before he
sentences Milne on February 23.

Lahore, Friday
A 14-YEAR-OLD Christian boy convicted of writing anti-Islamic slogans
on a mosque was today under sentence of death because of Pakistan's
strict blasphemy laws.
Judge Mujahid Hussein found Salamat Masih and his uncle Rehmat Masih
guilty of insulting Islam, a crime that carries a mandatory death
penalty, which in Pakistan means hanging.
The alleged anti-Islamic slogans were never revealed at the trial in
Lahore, said the pair's defence lawyer. Witnesses said they were erased
immediately and they refused to repeat them in court on the grounds that
they were offensive to Islam.
Amnesty International and other human rights groups have criticised
Pakistan's blasphemy laws, first introduced during the 1980s. The laws
prohibit any criticism of Islam or its seventh-century founder the
prophet Mohammed.
At least six people have been sentenced to hang so far, although
no-one has yet been executed.

THE missing piece of a valuable collection of furniture and fittings
from a former Charles Rennie Mackintosh tearoom -- part of a major
exhibition of his work -- has been uncovered during a visit to Glasgow
by an American-based governor of the city's school of art.
Mrs Eleanor Taffner and her husband Donald, were viewing restoration
work being carried out for the exhibition on Thursday, when they were
shown the almost re-assembled White Dining Room from Miss Cranston's
tearooms and realised that they owned what the school has described as
''the missing piece of the jigsaw'' -- a decorative fire-back.
The couple were being shown a 6ft square cast-iron fireplace which
once graced the tearooms in Ingram Street, and -- after having been
''lost'' for more than 20 years -- was last year discovered behind a
false wall in the school's basement.
Mrs Taffner, in Glasgow for the naming of a ScotRail train in honour
of the school's 150th anniversary, said: ''We looked at the fireplace
and noticed that the fire-back was missing. Then we realised that we
have it at home in New York.''
The discovery was checked by Mr Peter Trowles, the curator of the
school's Mackintosh Collection, and officials are ''99% certain'' it is
the missing piece.
The Taffners, who bought the 95-year-old fire-back at a Christie's
auction in Glasgow in May 1990, are to donate the piece to Glasgow.
* The National Trust for Scotland is buying a table designed by
Mackintosh for the Hill House in Helensburgh.

EASTWOOD MP Allan Stewart demonstrated that the best defence is a good
offence last night, in a vigorous attack on Labour's devolution plans
before Tory loyalists in the heart of Mr Tony Blair's English
constituency.
Mr Stewart, who resigned on Tuesday after an incident with motorway
protesters, confounded expectations by keeping a long-standing
engagement to address the Conservative branch in Sedgefield, County
Durham.
He even managed to make light of his sudden departure from Government.
He told them he had been worried that Sedgefield's Conservatives might
not have heard of him. ''I asked myself if there was anything I could do
to get my public profile up? I hope you agree I have succeeded in doing
that.''
He had come to England to take on Labour and the party's proposals for
constitutional reform. That he chose to do so in Mr Blair's safe
constituency was, he admitted, a bit of mischief. Devolution for
Scotland, Wales, and England is a ''con trick'', he said, based on
political opportunism. Labour has not thought out its plans or solved
fundamental problems, such as the West Lothian question.
''Why should England have 72 Scottish MPs voting on laws about schools
in Sedgefield but not St Andrews; 72 Scottish MPs deciding on housing
for Durham but not Dundee?'' he said.
He told the audience of about 50 mostly elderly Tory supporters that
Labour has not thought through its proposals. ''They do not derive from
genuine belief but from political opportunism. They are unworkable.''
He added: ''They are offering people in England wholly undefined
assemblies that people simply do not want. Frankly, these proposals have
all the appearance of being written on the back of an exceedingly small
envelope.''
In an open letter to Mr Stewart published yesterday, the cross party
Campaign for a Northern Assembly challenged him to explain why quangoes
and civil servants running services in the North-east should not be
subject to democratic control.
The letter asked: ''Do you believe that your party, with its
percentage share of the vote in the northern region at the last General
Election, legitimately represents the views of the northern
electorate?''
More than 50% of the region's electorate voted Labour in the last
General Election.
Councillor Eric Roberts, chairman of the Sedgefield Conservative
Constituency Association, said: ''If people are talking about the
Government's performance in this region then devolution would be bottom
of the list. We just don't see it happening.''

THE daughter of a woman whose throat was cut by a motorist on a
country lane yesterday warned that the ''crazy killer'' would strike
again.
Grief-stricken Heather Wilson, 39, said: ''I know that the crazy
person who did this to my mother will do it again to somebody else
because there was no motive whatsoever.''
She said her mother had walked on the road where she met her killer
hundreds of times before.
Mrs Margaret Wilson, 66, died on the country lane between Burton
Fleming and Rudston, Humberside, on Thursday afternoon, just moments
after Heather had dropped her off from her car.
Mrs Wilson had wanted to walk to her cottage but she had walked only a
few hundred yards when the motorist driving towards her in a white
Montego Estate car stopped and struggled with the elderly woman,
slashing her throat with a knife.
Two horrified farm labourers, who were ploughing a field near Mrs
Wilson's home, saw the attack.
As they ran to try to help her, the killer calmly jogged back to his
car and sped off.
Holding back tears at a packed news conference in Driffield today,
Miss Wilson said: ''My mother got killed because she was in the right
place, well the wrong place, she just happened to be there, that's why
she got killed.''
Heather added: ''I don't think it was premeditated. I think it was
spur of the moment and that is what makes it so awful.''
Police have not established a motive.

Julie Davidson finds one for the birds and another break for those
who'd like to bill and coo in fairy-tale style
THE last dodo died on Mauritius, and they're still having problems
with bird conservation. Recently there was another ornithological
fatality on the Indian Ocean island, a drama of hawks and doves when the
world's rarest kestrel ate the world's rarest pigeon.
''True!'' says Libby Weir-Breen, who runs Island Holidays'
special-interest tours from her Comrie base in landlocked Perthshire.
''The Mauritian Wildlife Appeal Fund has been working on a programme to
save both the Mauritius kestrel and the pink pigeon. The kestrel was
almost extinct. Its numbers have been raised from two or three to around
300, and there are only about 70 pink pigeons left. Unfortunately one of
the kestrels made a meal of one of the pigeons.''
In need of the PR, perhaps, the Mauritian Wildlife Appeal Fund is
collaborating with Island Holidays in the autumn on a natural-history
holiday with an emphasis on birdlife. Led by a British ornithologist and
escorted by a member of the resident MFA team, the tour leaves London
Heathrow on October 20 of this year. Its numbers are limited to 12, and
''pink pigeons and Mauritius kestrels are guaranteed!'' says Libby
Weir-Breen confidently. If they can keep them apart.
I have a soft spot for Mauritius, which I visited in 1979 when it was
still a twinkle in the eye of the package-holiday industry but when this
was already the island's second industry. (Sugar is the first.) It has
some of the loveliest hotels in the tropics -- thanks, largely, to
careful development and the influence of one French Mauritian architect
-- and its history has given it a cheerful muddle of races and cultures.
The French developed it, the British appropriated it (after
independence in 1968 it became a member of the Commonwealth), the
Africans were the slaves of its sugar plantations, and the Indians
replaced them with indentured labour after the abolition of slavery in
1835. Many of their genes are now mixed, and although English is the
language of officialdom the lingua franca is French and the patois is
Creole. It also has its share of Chinese, moving in from Asia to become
the merchant class. Gastronomically it's like living in Soho.
It has wonderful little jaggy mountains, including the volcanic peak
which Mark Twain called ''a dainty vest-pocket Matterhorn'', coral
sands, and a splendid reef. But it's halfway between Africa and India
and I wouldn't go all that way to lie on a beach, which is why the
twitchers' tour is the kind of lure which makes more sense.
People who live near Mauritius do go there to lie on a beach and enjoy
the water sports and deep-sea fishing. It's a popular destination with
Zimbabweans, who don't have a coastline, and South Africans, who do but
like a change. When I was there 15 years ago its tourists were mainly
South Africans ''taking a holiday,'' as one told me, ''from apartheid''.
They don't need to do that now, but there were always those who
appreciated the racial harmony of Mauritius.
Recent information suggests there's only one serpent in this tourist
Eden: the price of ''extras'' in those heavenly hotels, where you can
expect to pay three times as much for an imported bottle of wine as you
do in Europe or, indeed, in Zimbabwe or South Africa. But that shouldn't
bother bird-watchers intoxicated by Mauritius kestrels and seeing pink
pigeons. Island Holidays' all-inclusive Mauritian adventure costs #1995
for eight nights. Reservations and itinerary on 01764 670107.
* ALL Dr Brian Mawhinney needs to know about the Chunnel rail service
is contained in the winter edition of Top Rail, the magazine of SNCF,
the French railway network. This gung-ho publication knows no fear. To
the question, ''Is Eurostar safe?'' it replies: ''For a number of
reasons, Eurostar can claim to be among the safest trains in the world,
and also the safest way of getting from Britain to the Continent. In
addition, there are highly effective security procedures in place at
Eurostar check-in and waiting areas, as well as on the train itself.''
Highly effective for all but Observer reporters, of course.
* WEXAS International, the travel-club and discount-fare specialist,
have found a foolproof way to inform journalists about their 25th
anniversary. They've sent us a commemorative souvenir. So, declaring an
interest and a taste for vintage claret, I raise my glass of 1970
Chateau La Cardonne Cru Grand Bourgeois and toast Wexas's
quarter-century, which was born with one man, his girlfriend, a borrowed
typewriter, and a kitchen table in Chelsea and has seen the club grow
into Europe's leading travel association, with 35,000 members and an
annual turnover of #25 million.
What happened in 1970? The Beatles split up. BP discovered oil in the
North Sea. The first Jumbo Jet landed at Heathrow. And a young man
called Ian Wilson, inspired by his experience of student travel clubs at
Oxford, decided to form a club which would help make the louche world of
the bucket shop respectable.
The world of discount travel has changed beyond recognition. ''In
those days,'' says Dr Wilson, who is still the chairman of Wexas, ''the
consolidators wanted cash in hand and there were a lot of cowboys
around. The key feature was 'bent' charter flights. The Wednesday
Special to New York was chartered under different pseudo 'affinity'
groups every Wednesday. The Surrey Cagebirds Association springs to
mind.
''The discount market is now legitimate, covered by ATOL licensing
which is the ultimate official sanction and which gives the consumer
protection.''
The mysterious acronym Wexas stands for World Expeditionary
Association. Dr Wilson, interested in the serious side of travel, was
keen to involve the organisation in explorations and research and Wexas
have sponsored over 200 expeditions.
As the number of independent travellers continues to overtake packaged
ones, club membership and Wexas's operation continue to grow, moving
into the business market, too. Today the annual subscription gives
members access to discounted flights, hotels, car-hire and other travel
accessories, as well as a tailor-made travel service and the Wexas tour
programmes. If you like a lot of expertise on your club and want to

OFFICIALS at ports and airports across the UK were last night on the
lookout for a woman who removed her three-year-old daughter from an
Argyll hotel. The child's father has legal custody of her.
Strathclyde Police issued the alert after Mrs Karen Stewart left the
Crinan Hotel with her daughter, Kelly, on Thursday afternoon. Mrs
Stewart is from New Zealand.
The girl's father, Mr Andrew Stewart, of Bellanoch, near Lochgilphead,
had custody of Kelly after the couple separated late last year. He left
the child with her mother earlier on Thursday and found they had both
gone when he went to collect her.
Mr Stewart, 29, a woodcutter, said yesterday that his estranged wife
had packed her cases and left her job at the hotel, where she had worked
as a receptionist for the past month.
He was granted an interim custody order at Dunoon Sheriff Court on
Wednesday, which prevented Mrs Stewart, 34, taking Kelly out of his
care, or out of the sheriffdom of North Strathclyde.
Police described the girl as slim, with collar-length blond hair, and
wearing a red anorak, green trousers, and black boots. Her mother is 5ft
6in, of slim build, with brown hair and a fair complexion.

R D Kernohan was not tired of life but was certainly tired of London,
until he looked beyond the crowded attractions to find revitalising
refuges in the city
AS James Boswell might have said, no good Scot should let Dr Johnson
vex him too much. But the great Englishman can put the fear of death in
me. He wrote to Boswell: ''When a man is tired of London, he is tired of
life. For there is in London all that life can afford.''
If that means urban life, it's as true today as in 1777. And if you
find you don't like London, even at times can hardly bear London, does
that mean that you're past it and ready for an even more important
departure than any from Heathrow?
Maybe not. Perhaps only someone as reluctant as Johnson to express
mixed feelings could never be in two minds about London. Even some
equally single-minded Englishmen, notably William Cobbett in his
denunciations of ''The Great Wen'' when it was a tenth of its modern
size, have been decidedly of the other opinion about it.
Scots writers have often taken to it. The makar William Dunbar, who
had even more powerful things than Johnson to say about the fear of
death, thought it the ''flower of cities all''. Carlyle is forever
linked to Chelsea as well as Ecclefechan. Barrie thought up strange
notions around Kensington Gardens. Yet, apart from Dickens, the best of
the English have had their doubts. When she had to come to London I'm
sure Jane Austen held on to her handbag. Thomas Hardy retreated to
Wessex. Shakespeare bought a nice house back in Stratford. Even Kipling
has splendid lines of frustration:
But I am sick of London
From Shepherd's Bush to Bow.
Kipling stumbled on to the truth that, for all its sense of being a
capital city, London remained (and remains today) a very parochial one.
Many Londoners are almost as hazy about the geography of their own urban
sprawl -- apart from the West End, City, and their Tube line -- as about
the world beyond Watford.
But it is possible to come to terms with London, though the terms are
inevitably dictated by two facts of London life. The first is what you
may think of either as monstrous complexity or infinite variety. The
second is that the main tourist ''attractions'' seem as congested nearly
all year round as those of Edinburgh for a few weeks of high summer.
Even more than in Paris or Vienna or Rome, it can be hard to see
anything worthwhile because of the crowds who flock to see it. Much of
the National Gallery is afflicted by the kind of congestion which in the
vaster Louvre concentrates on a few five-star items like the Mona Lisa.
The tours which once neglected St Paul's now swarm around it.
Westminster Abbey, a mecca for the Japanese, is uncomfortably and
unnaturally partitioned between the small area of unrestricted access in
the nave and the heavily charged-for chapels.
The answer is to look, among the complexity, for things and places
that are relatively neglected and slightly out of the way. London is
still a city of partially hidden treasures. Even attractions that come a
bit down the page in good guidebooks can be bearable in the high tourist
season and quite relaxed out of it. Not all of them are remote. The
outstanding example is probably the wonderful eccentricity of Sir John
Soane's Museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields with its Hogarths, its founder's
ability to turn the rooms of his house into vistas, and the charm of
what Baedeker calls its ''air of confusion''.
Other examples range from the Imperial War Museum at the original
Bedlam -- well-known and close-in -- to the traces of the old Crystal
Palace site at more distant Sydenham and the oasis of the Morden Hall
park in the brick-built wilderness of South London. For anyone of
appropriate inclinations there is also the challenge of trying to
explore historical and literary London -- far from easy in a city that
has not only changed so much but where parts can change so fast.
Even where street plans have not utterly changed, the search for the
past can require prodigious acts of imagination. It is hard to invoke
the London of Dickens in modern Holborn or Chancery Lane, even the
Temple -- rather like trying to match post-war Nuremberg with the city
of Die Meistersinger. But it's just possible to stand on Westminster
Bridge and understand why Wordsworth thought earth hadn't anything to
show more fair, even if you don't quite agree.
My own answer to the threat of feeling ''tired of London'' (and the
implications of Johnson's epigram) also includes trying to add something
new and unexplored on each visit whenever practicable. Anyone more
methodical would probably profit from a list of as yet unvisited but
forthcoming attractions. If I dared such a compilation it would at last
get me on board the Docklands Light Railway and range from the Dulwich
Picture Gallery, the Oval, and the modern Army Museum in Chelsea to the
interior of St George's Bloomsbury, the Nicholas Hawksmoor church with
the most startling exterior in London. I'd even at last manage to get
across London Bridge to see the inside of Southwark Cathedral.
But there is no doubt where anyone who cares either for fine churches
or undervalued and endangered masterpieces ought to go. The City is a
dull place for shops and duller still for pubs but its surviving Wren
and other churches are cool and calm when St Paul's and Westminster
Abbey are stifled with tourism. But they are now endangered again, many
of them after restoration from wartime near-destruction and painful (but
often successful) struggles to find a role where few people live and
half a million work.
Let no-one think Scots Presbyterianism has a monopoly on the problems
the Kirk calls ''union and readjustment'', or of sometimes handling them
with aesthetic insensitivity and a capacity for wrangling and
ill-feeling. Some of the finest Wren churches may not fit readily into
the latest plans to ''rationalise'' the deployment of clergy and it may
be as well to see them when (with some help from the Mammonites of City
finance) most of them are still open, active, and admirably maintained.
Despite the wartime losses there are still enough of them to confuse
and even amaze the visitor. My own favourites are the easily accessible
St Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside and the more concealed St Stephen Walbrook
(behind the Mansion House) with the lovely dome which is said to be a
scaled-down version of Wren's original idea for St Paul's. But the best
plan is to wander round and venture in wherever a City church door is
open.
London can be full of disappointments, from the tawdriness around
Piccadilly Circus to the dreariness of Victoria Street, but it remains a
city with incomparable scope for personal discoveries and, for anyone
whose encounters span several decades, of golden memories of unexpected
places. I remember the joy of the wonderful library of Jacobite books
which that notable Scottish journalist Ion S Munro had gathered in a
slightly shabby, very genteel square at Mount Pleasant in the hinterland
of Clerkenwell. Some were the fruits of his sojourn as Rome
correspondent of the old Morning Post in the days of Mussolini. And as I
pass the solicitors, building societies, French bankers, and
odds-and-ends of modern Fleet Street I wonder what survives of the
marvellous woodwork panelling of the old Herald building.
But not all the discoveries are to be made in inner London and north
of the Thames. One of the happy coincidences of my life, for example,
was that I was living in the South London suburbs when I discovered one
of the strangest geniuses of twentieth-century English literature, Henry
Williamson (1895-1977). Most of those who recognise the name probably
associate it with Devon, and Tarka the Otter. A few people with long
memories also recall Williamson's naive and disastrous excursion into
scatterbrained politics, wasting his substance on riotous living as an
admirer of Sir Oswald Mosley.
Williamson will retain his niche in literary history as a novelist of
nature, thought the suburbs have long since sprawled over the Kentish
woods and fields, a cycle-ride from his home near Lewisham, which first
inspired him. But the next century will rediscover him, despite the
untidiness of his long semi-autobiographical novel-saga, A Chronicle of
Ancient Sunlight, for two very different reasons. Despite its
introspection, the earlier parts of the chronicle are South London
social history as well as literary achievement. Even more important, and
though written nearly 40 years on from the Somme and Passchendaele, they
are the English novel's only adequate equivalent, in depth and feeling,
of the war poetry of 1914-1918.
On and around the hill above Lewisham it is still possible to feel
oneself back in the world from which young Phillip Maddison went from
his insurance office to war and to which he returned on leave amid the
endurance, the mourning, and the incomprehension of the civilian world.
There have been population changes, as dark faces and incongruous
car-stickers for Irish Gaelic games testify, though less dramatically
than in more fashionable parts of London or the inner-city areas closer
to the Thames. South London, always a bit of an unknown country for the
tribes across the Thames, now has invisible local social and even ethnic
frontiers which are all but impossible for the outsider to understand.
But physically -- away from the main roads and shopping centres at
least -- this area between New Cross and Catford, like Blackheath on the
other side of Lewisham, is still less changed than most of London. And
the two best aids to appreciating Williamson are probably good histories
and memoirs of the First World War and a London street atlas, the more
detailed the better.
Now that I've looked out that atlas to check on the intricacies of
South London railways and Phillip Maddison's choice of stations (for his
nine-and-fourpenny monthly season to London Bridge) it occurs to me that
I'm not as tired of London as I thought.
Maybe next season I might even manage a day at Lord's again. Denis
Compton was still batting on my last one.

BUSINESS tycoon Owen Oyston yesterday appeared in court charged with
eight sex offences, including four rapes.
He was granted #50,000 conditional bail when he appeared before
Trafford magistrates in Greater Manchester.
Mr Oyston, 60, of Claughton Hall, near Hornby, Lancaster, is accused
of four rapes, three indecent assaults, and conspiring to procure girls
under the age of 21 to have sexual intercourse.
Reporting restrictions were not lifted.
Mr Oyston spoke to confirm his name and also gave his address to the
court.
Mr John Lord, prosecuting, made an application for a remand on
conditional bail. This was agreed by Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, defending.
The four rapes are alleged to have taken place between April 1988 and
December 1992, two at Claughton and one in London. No location was given
for the fourth charge.
The three indecent assault charges relate to a period between
September 1989 and December 1991. One assault allegedly took place in
Lancashire, another in Sale, Greater Manchester. The third locality was
not given.
In addition, Mr Oyston is charged between April 1, 1988, and May 31,
1993, with conspiring with another man to procure girls under the age of
21 to have sexual intercourse in any part of the world with a third
party.
The Mr Oyston's conditions of bail are that he resides at Claughton
Hall and pays into the court #50,000 as surety.
Mr Oyston was remanded until March 27.

TWO of the three M77 protesters arrested on Thursday were jailed
yesterday after they refused to accept bail conditions banning them from
''obstructing'' or ''interfering'' with employees of Wimpey
Construction, the builders of the motorway extension.
Mr Paul Murphy, 28, from Langside, and Mr Jake Hunter, 22, who gave
his address as a treehouse in the protesters' Pollok Estate encampment,
were remanded in custody until trial on February 27 at Glasgow Sheriff
Court.
Ms Frances Claxton, 20, from Maryhill Road, accepted the bail
conditions and was freed until the trial.
Uproar broke out in the public gallery as the two were taken to the
cells.
Mr Walter Morrison, a community councillor from Corkerhill shouted
''shame'' twice and was ejected by police.
Mr Lindsay Keenan, 30, from Linwood -- who earlier this week alleged
he had been assaulted during an incident in which then Scottish Office
Minister, Mr Allan Stewart, allegedly grabbed a pickaxe -- stood and
shouted: ''This is an absolute outrage.''
He was then dragged, shouting, out of the court by police.
Several other protesters then noisily left the court.
Mr Keenan was taken to the cells and released some time later. A
police spokesman said a report was to be sent to the procurator-fiscal
on the incident.
Speaking outside the court, Mr Morrison claimed: ''This just shows you
there's one law in this country for the rich and powerful and another
for the rest.''
The three protesters appeared in court charged with breach of the
peace following an incident on Thursday at a site on the M77 motorway
link, near Boydstone Road, Carnwadric.
It is alleged they ripped up metal fencing posts, throwing them on to
the ground and then obstructed a workman wheeling a barrow of concrete.
They are also accused of tipping the barrow over and kicking the
concrete about on the ground.
Depute-fiscal Mandy McGowan asked Sheriff Iain Pirie to impose special
bail conditions banning the accused from approaching, obstructing, or
interfering with contractors' workmen on the M77 link.
Mr Alan Miller, representing the accused, challenged these conditions
claiming the Glasgow office of the procurator-fiscal was attempting to
get an interim interdict on behalf of Wimpey through the ''back door''
of the criminal courts.
Sheriff Pirie adjourned the court while he considered the matter.
On reconvening, he struck the word ''approach'' from the bail
conditions while agreeing to implement the ban on obstructing or
interfering with the workmen.
* Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart resigned this week after an
incident on Sunday in Pollok Castle Wood, Newton Mearns. The Crown
Office was considering the possibility of legal proceedings.
The Eastwood MP's son, Jack, 16 and another youth David Clow, 16, were
also reported to the procurator-fiscal in connection with alleged
breaches of the Firearms Act.

<HEADLINE>CBI chief calls for action on inequality</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979910934</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S business leader yesterday urged the Government to act to
close the biggest gap between the rich and the poor for 50 years. Mr
Howard Davies, director general of the CBI, said the time was ripe for
action and called for an end to ''political argy-bargy'' over poverty.
By investing in education and training, Ministers could address the
huge inequalities which were a ''drag-anchor'' on the British economy.
He said the growth in equality had had a ''particularly severe'' effect
on young people. More school leavers were leaving without qualifications
and putting the country at a competitive disadvantage.
At the same time, there was a need for companies to invest in skills
and training for all their workforce, not just key workers, as was the
case at present. ''Too many people in employment are not receiving
training and too many out of employment are not being trained,'' said Mr
Davies.
He added: ''The growth of inequality is an issue of growing concern to
business. It is not just a question of morality or social justice. If a
sizeable minority is unable to contribute, it is a drag-anchor on the
economy, and it pays the price.''
Repeating the CBI's calls for improved child care and in-work
benefits, and urging the Government to act now, he said the economy had
come out of recession and was relatively healthy.
Mr Davies warned: ''I hope this report does not simply become the
subject of political argy-bargy.''

The very idea of Icelandic cuisine may be enough to chill the heart of
the diner. But the new Glasgow restaurant which draws inspiration from
Iceland gets a warm reception from Margaret Hughes.
I HAVE never been to Iceland, and my only impression of the country is
of an ice-capped island that looks breathtakingly cold from the windows
of a transatlantic plane. Neither had I ever heard anyone extol the
virtues of Icelandic cuisine. So it was with great interest that I dined
at Glasgow's first restaurant that draws influences from Iceland.
Cathedral House Hotel looks equally breathtaking against the backdrop
of the floodlit Glasgow Cathedral and the brooding darkness of the
Necropolis. The turreted, red-sandstone building dates from the end of
the nineteenth century and comprises a cafe bar, the XO Restaurant, and
seven bedrooms. The restaurant is situated upstairs and is simply
decorated with dark wooden tables and chairs, lots of plants, and a
crackling fire.
With no prior knowledge of Icelandic food, except the assumption that
fish would feature prominently, I browsed through the extensive menu and
was pleased that it included lots of examples of good Scottish produce,
like venison, beef, salmon, and seafood. But I didn't feel there was
anything here which set the menu apart from any other restaurant selling
Scottish food. However, towards the bottom of the menu are ''Hot Rock
Specials'', the Icelandic speciality.
The choice of dishes under this heading on the menu included fillet
steak, langoustine tails, lamb, and salmon, all good Scottish
ingredients. Choosing one of these dishes means that the diner does the
cooking at the table on a ''hot rock''.
This Icelandic method of cooking is only available for main courses
and has been offered by the restaurant for several years now, mainly
because the restaurant wanted to offer something different. Since I felt
it was my duty to try that ''something different'' I opted for a ''Hot
Rock Special'' and hurried with eager anticipation through my starter of
steamed mussels on a herb crouton topped with spinach and nuts.
The mussels were delicious; the waitress assured me they were Scottish
and freshly delivered that day. The spinach was also very fresh, the
herb crouton and nuts made for an interesting combination of tastes and
textures, and as always there just weren't enough mussels.
I had decided to have a combination of fillet of beef and seafood as
my main course. Delightfully titled ''Surf 'n' Turf'', it reminded more
of California than Reykjavik. Deciding to stick with the Californian
theme, and because the fish and seafood dominated the meal, I chose
Robert Mondavi's Woodbridge 1992 Chardonnay from an extensive wine-list
that covered the globe. This is a fruity, dry wine in which you can
almost taste the sunshine of the Napa Valley.
The waitress brought my ''raw'' food to the table. It consisted of two
slices of beef and a selection of unshelled langoustine and prawns, and
was followed by the hot rock.
The rock is a piece of granite which is set into a heavy wooden board
and is brought to the table looking harmless enough, but considering
that it has been warmed in a very hot pizza oven all day, the food
sizzles as soon as it meets it.
I have to admit that I was slightly nervous. The table was slightly
wobbly and we had a near miss as I manoeuvred my hot rock and the table
top moved with it. Visions of the hot rock leaving its imprint on my
body flashed before me. Thankfully, the rock is so deeply embedded in
the wooden block that it would need to have been turned upside-down and
shaken violently to fall out.
A choice of three sauces are supplied -- plum chutney, fresh yoghurt,
and barbecue sauce -- and you are left to your own devices. Our waitress
was very helpful, explaining that it was up to me how long I cooked my
meat and fish, cheerfully assuring me that the rock would take a long
time to cool, in fact it wouldn't be properly cooled until the following
day. This did not make me feel better.
Things improved as soon as I threw the meat on the rock and it began
cooking. After a few minutes each side I decided to try it -- it cut
easily and tasted wonderfully tender. I had expected it to have that
smoky taste associated with barbecuing, but it didn't. The food does not
smoke too much, but the heat which is given off left me feeling a bit
too warm, and as it takes a long time to cool down, there is little
respite until it is removed.
I enjoy cooking, but I also enjoy other people cooking for me, so when
I had to peel the shells off the seafood and cook it, the novelty wore
off and I ended up eating only one of the prawns. I had expected that
the heat of the rock would sear it too much, but it didn't at all.
Several other diners had chosen to hot-rock their food and the
contented sizzle of the food added to the cosy ambience of the
restaurant. The majority of those had obviously eaten in the restaurant
before and were quite adept at it. One couple were sharing the ''Hot
Rock Fantasy'', which is available with meat or fish for two to share.
For those who would rather have their food prepared in the kitchen,
the turbot was lightly roasted and served with a good selection of
winter vegetables. There is also a vegetarian dish of the day, as well
as a selection of chef's specials.
Bananas were a strong feature of the dessert menu. Now I know these do
not come from either Scotland or Iceland and the waitress couldn't
explain their prominence; the chef obviously likes using them. I chose
choux pastry filled with cream and served with bananas on a caramel
sauce. It was a light, unfussy way to end the meal.
If you want to really indulge yourself, the trio of chocolate mousses
with a strawberry coulis is a chocoholic's dream.
Cathedral House's XO Restaurant has much to commend it: the food was
fresh and well-prepared and the service was excellent. The waitress was
friendly, helpful, and answered each one of my difficult questions with
a smile, no doubt bemused by my manic obsession that everything that
should be Scottish was Scottish!
Cooking on the rock was fun. It struck me that maybe this is just the
sort of thing the Scots can do instead of barbecuing -- it's not
dictated by the weather, smoke does not belch out all over the place,
and the food tasted great.
* XO Restaurant, Cathedral House, 28/32 Cathedral Square, Glasgow.
Tel: 041 552 3519.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
* The Ubiquitous Chip, 12 Ashton Lane, Glasgow. Tel: 041 334 5007
I PASSED by The Ubiquitous Chip every day for three years on my way to
university, but it wasn't until I graduated that I afforded myself the
treat of eating there -- again and again!
The Ubiquitous Chip is a bit of an institution in Glasgow, and its
recent Michelin Red ''M'' award is long overdue. Memorable dishes from
the restaurant include haggis, mashed tatties and neeps, venison
sausages, and home-made oatmeal ice-cream.
Good Scottish produce dominates in the restaurant and service is very
good. The wine-list is excellent and has itself been the recipient of a
number of awards.
* Cantina del Ray, King Court, Glasgow. Tel: 041 552 4044
THIS is a noisy, bustling and enjoyable way to go Mexican. From the
free shot of margarita and tortilla chips with hot salsa to the wide
range of Mexican dishes, it is a restaurant that buzzes.
The menu includes potato skins loaded with spicy chilli, fajitas with
giant shrimp and vegetarian burritos, in an atmosphere charged with the
energy of people having a fun night out.
Desserts include the very moreish cinnamon chips, which are deep-fried
tortilla chips smothered in cinnamon and honey, and served with
ice-cream.
The margarita is great, so is the tequila, but there is also a good
selection of imported beers.
* Pierre Victoire, 10 Victoria Street, Edinburgh. Tel: 031 225 1721
Lunchtime in most Pierre Victoire restaurants can be fraught -- tables
are usually full and waiters either a bit harassed or totally laid-back.
But at #4.90 for a three-course lunch, it is hard to complain.
The Victoria Street restaurant is hugely popular with shoppers, office
workers, and students clamouring for tables. Recent offerings on the
lunch menu included carrot and orange soup with rosemary, a selection of
vegetables in a Pernod sauce, and bread-and-butter pudding.
The food is simple, the portions just enough in the middle of the day,
and it is good value for money.

THE 500th birthday celebrations of Aberdeen University were truly in
the air yesterday when not only was a planet named in its honour but the
principal received greetings from a Concorde pilot, 51,000ft above the
earth, travelling at twice the speed of sound.
Back on the ground, the Prince of Wales joined the Queen Mother on the
list of honorary graduates of the university when he became a Doctor of
Laws.
The planet, which is to be named Aberdonia in honour of the
university, was discovered on September 21, 1987.
The university was the idea of William Elphinstone, Bishop of
Aberdeen, who identified the need for more clergy, teachers, doctors,
and lawyers.
His solution was to establish a local institution for those unable to
attend the existing universities of St Andrews and Glasgow.
Yesterday, the quincentenary celebrations and founder's weekend
started with a procession to the Cathedral Church of St Machar for a
thanksgiving service and the special graduation ceremony.
The Duke of Edinburgh, present in his capacity as Chancellor of the
University of Edinburgh, saw his son receive his honorary degree.
Honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees were conferred on His Eminence
Cardinal Pio Laghi, Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education;
The Most Reverend Richard Holloway, Bishop of Edinburgh and Primus of
the Scottish Episcopal Church; and The Right Rev James Simpson,
Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
Last night, a special founder's day dinner was held.
Today, the university receives the Freedom of Aberdeen in a service in
the Music Hall.

The offer sounded too good to resist -- and it was. A free cruise,
free flights, free board . . . and all Robert Grigor had to do was be
charming and bring along his dancing shoes. Here he reveals his diary of
a dream
Night-time? Dance,
Gentleman Host, dance
and dance again. Keep
smiling, feet!
THE ''Gentleman Host Program(me)'' unsurprisingly took shape in the US
in 1982. Originated by the wife of a cruise-line director who had
observed the preponderance of more mature women to men on board, it was
further developed, by Lauretta Blake more than six years ago.
Lauretta now heads up a worldwide organisation supplying Gentlemen
Hosts to most of the cruise lines of the western world. (There are
normally 10 Gentlemen Hosts, for example, on the QE2 and Lauretta will
know every one of them personally.) The Gentleman Host pays her a modest
weekly fee, but in exchange he can expect, with certain exceptions, to
have his flights to and from the liner provided. In addition his travel
on board ship, his laundry, his wine when hosting tables and his food
are free. Even his drinks bill is discounted by 50%.
So what's the catch? Well, he must have ''happy feet''. He's there to
dance. In my case, I faced a second ''vetting'' as BBC Scotland were
looking for a token Scot (most but not all Gentlemen Hosts are American)
willing to run the gauntlet with a film crew railing alongside. The
result will be broadcast this Tuesday on BBC1 at 9.30pm in the Ex-S
series.
The protocol is thoroughness itself, reflecting the wee ''c''
conservatism of middle America but redolent too of the romance of the
great cruise liners of Hollywood's golden era. Noel Coward. Cole Porter.
Black tie. White tux. Old world courtesies. However, unlike Cary Grant,
the Gentleman Host stops way short of ''Your place or mine?'' That
stricture is unequivocal. The penalty for breaching it? Disembarkation
at the next port of call. Make your own way home.
A word, finally, for the hard-pressed BBC licence-holder. All flights
for the film crew and myself, our travel and board, were courtesy of
Orient Lines. We thank them sincerely.
November 29-30
LUNCHTIME, I shuttled to London, meeting up with the Scots contingent
at Heathrow -- Martin, the ''sound man'', Richard, the director, and
Aileen, the assistant producer. It was reassuring to see her. Survival
instinct told me she carried the film's tight fiscal resources in her
sporran-belt. Ross, an affable soul, characteristically arrived
unannounced. His assistant camerman, Noel, had flown out earlier to East
Africa with the film equipment for Customs clearance. ''He's a 'dead
ringer' for Woody Allen,'' Ross told me. Later I was astonished how
right he was.
A Kenyan Airways Airbus winged us to Nairobi, where we hung around
until a scruffier machine headed us to Mombasa. Even allowing for a
three-hour time difference, we'd been travelling for more than 24 hours
and everyone was numb with fatigue. Scrambling on board ship, I blessed
the air-conditioning and located my cabin.
Unpacking, a tap at the door. Richard. ''Robbie, remember we have
tonight and tomorrow to rest up?'' ''Uh-huh.'' ''There's been a cock-up
somewhere. 'Fraid you're due to meet the other Gentlemen Hosts tonight.
You'll be introduced to the passengers and then do a bit of footwork at
the Welcome Aboard Dance. Sorry 'bout that.'' ''Will you be filming?'' I
inquired meekly. ''Of course.'' I watched the door close and sprawled on
the bed.
Alarm-called, I power-showered, shaved and bristled teeth, skooshed
with minty aerosol. On with the kit. White shoes, (leather soles,
please), white socks, white pants (trousers), white shirt (button-down
but not mandatory), blue sports coat (blazer), silk tie, matching
'kerchief. I targeted the Marco Polo lounge.
''Stop it right there, Robbie!'' the director hollered. Moments of
uncertainty. ''Right. Now!'' Round the corner, I ventured into a battery
of lights, snap-on smiles, energised handshakes to fellow Gentlemen
Hosts. Cameras whirred. Eyelids sagged. ''Cut -- that'll do.''
Mercifully, that was it. Spared the dancing.
Back in my cabin, I mournfully examined my ''happy feet''. The left
one, still swollen from the journey, looked particularly dismal. Into
bed. Sleep.
December 1
BREAKFAST was wondrous, lifting morale. Fresh pineapple slices, fresh
virtually any fruit. Melon and Parma ham. I swerved the waffles and
maple syrup. Scrambled eggs. Sausages. Crispy bacon. Hash browns. No
rolls, though. What a silly sacrifice to a pretend diet!
I had an hour to explore my new environment. Wall-to-wall lush
carpeting. Elevators to all floors. It was hard not to be impressed. A
casino here. A library there. An oasis of peace in the card room.
Swimming-pool. Helipad. Designer boutiques with tax-free advantage often
nullified by grabby profit margins. Gymnasium. Health spa. Jacuzzis.
Slot machines discreetly tucked in a quiet niche. Anyone for table
tennis? Bars, night-clubs, restaurants, barbecues proliferated. More
bars inside and out in the generous deck space. Thirst and hunger were
strangers to this lot.
I met up with the film crew at 11. Auntie had hired a black Hackney
taxi-cab to reinvent my arrival on the boat -- a visual jokette in the
boiling heat of Mombasa. The driver was a delight, ever smiling, trying
to please, but his apparent understanding of English, as events
transpired, was near total incomprehension. Constantly he confused ''Go
fast'' with ''Go past'' resulting in goodness knows how many ''takes''
for the simplest of shots. Anyway, thanks to him, the outcome was
hilarious and I won't forget his teeth-ground, magic smile, as he
finally opened the door of his mobile sauna.
Back on board, everyone trailed around to their meeting places for the
passenger emergency drill. The dulcet hurdy-gurdy Norwegian tones of the
ship's master over the airwaves generously thanked the passengers for
their co-operation. Ex-Captain of The Love Boat, I mused. That stacks
up.
I attended the Singles Get-Together but ducked the late-night dancing.
And, almost unnoticed, smoothly, sleekly, the Marco Polo slipped her
moorings and contentedly purred her independence as she set sail for
Zanzibar.
December 2
ZANZIBAR. Buses to-and-froed passengers to the market-place in Stone
Town. On one side, the still-standing, shameful slave market. On the
other, a small kirk, behind whose altar laid the remains of David
Livingstone.
The tour continued inland to the mainstays of the economy, the spice
and fruit plantations. Cinnamon, cloves, ginger, vanilla pods, chillis,
cumin seed, cardamom, pineapple, limes, coconuts. Everywhere coconuts.
Come midday, tropical rains plummeted for a while as locals took shelter
under fronds of banana leaves.
The party stopped to wonder as youths, a roped figure-of-eight wrapped
to their ankles, shimmied effortlessly up 60-foot palms, and the guide
intoned how good God had been to Zanzibar. The genuine friendliness of
the people set against their lack of schools, roads, hospitals, basics
we take for granted, would have troubled Scrooge. God could try harder,
I thought, while the merchants could help by paying real money, not
buttons, for this Garden of Eden.
Now at sea, and the sun set at 6.19pm. The Jewish Sabbath eve was
celebrated in the Charleston Club and Sailaway Bingo enticed the less
devout with Jackpot Snowball Prizes.
December 3
No land in sight. Except for ''must-do'' dance classes, a day of
relative freedom for the Gentleman Host. Until evening, that is.
The MV Marco Polo, with a day and a half to reach the Comoro Islands
(500 nautical miles away), gently tootled along in flat calm. At around
20,000 tonnes, it calls itself a medium-sized vessel which at full
capacity caters for 700 passengers. It claimed, too, to be the first
ship of its kind specifically designed for ''destinational cruising''. A
terrible mouthful, I know, but part of the glossy spiel. But with just
over 26 feet of her under the water, she could go places denied to the
mega-liner.
Shipboard activity is stepped up at sea but the highlight for the
punters had to be the formal Welcome Aboard Reception when the captain,
Erik Bjurstedt (''call me 'Eerick' '') greeted his guests with cocktails
and tasty bites. The frenetic rehearsals of curtsies made me ponder what
some would do were ''Eerick'' a royal.
December 4
ARRIVAL at Mayotte in the French Comoro Islands, surprisingly an
adjunct of the EC in the Indian Ocean. I escorted Shirley, the
archetypal Jewish American princess from Miami. A relative youngster at
76, widowed four times, she was all heart, energy-packed and crashingly
extrovert.
With Angeline, a French Canadian, and Bob, another Gentleman Host, we
ferried to Mamoudzou and taxied to the south of the island in search of
turtles. Our luck and the tide were out. These fascinating creatures
sleep off the reef at low tide, emerging only as the film gear was being
packed up. Camera-shy, maybe.
December 5
RED TAPE at Hellville (that's the name, honest) delayed the Marco
Polo's anchorage. But from 12 noon until way after two, guests munched
through endless burgers, hotdogs, and spare ribs, while iced tea and
Coke flowed on the Bounty Bar beach. In parties of around 20 (allegedly,
not to alarm the animals) guests processed to a lemur sanctuary.
These foxy-faced, monkey-bodied, catty-eyed beasties had clearly lost
their innocence grabbing bananas from unsuspecting hands. Yet curiously
these lower primates lived millions of years ago in Europe and North
America too. Here in Madagascar, they flourished due to an absence of
predators. We're the better for that.
As they flitted effortlessly through the branches, a larger
dismembered branch proudly took centre stage, held aloft by local
children. On their ''special branch'' a glum-looking emerald chameleon
clung three-toed to its dignity. A rotating eye nervously tracked
Shirley, the last to spot the hapless creature, as she shrieked: ''Oh my
Gaaad! Look at the shameleon!'' ''Chameleon,'' I rejoined. ''Shameleon,
Rabbie!'' ''Chameleon.'' The argument was going nowhere. Will
Shakespeare wrote plenty about Orlando, after all.
That night we set out on the long haul to Durban, South Africa, 1400
miles south-west.
December 6, 7 and 8
THE ship slipped forward as the clocks slipped back. But activities on
board dispelled any ennui three days at sea might threaten. Cruise
Enhancement Lectures. Origami. Bridge tournaments. Jazz by the pool. And
dancing. Dance classes every morning. Night-time? Dance, Gentleman Host,
dance and dance again. Keep smiling, feet!
But it was not all plain sailing. At 4am on the seventh, a violent
lurch propelled me floorwards. Some fared worse, sustaining minor
injuries. We'd hit a storm. Some 80% never surfaced for a day and a
night. In relative terms, then, I was one of the lucky ones. Elevators
ground to a halt. Sick-bags lined the railings. No sign of Alice.
The motion of the ship was uncomfortable but the crash and subsequent
shudder when sea parted company with boat only to violently re-assault
was positively white-knuckling. The Beaufort Scale registered Force 8 to
9 but wind speed was almost irrelevant. It was the size and
unpredictability of the waves. They were the great tormentor.
We hugged the Mozambique coastline to no effect. Starting from low
depressions in the Antartic, with no land for thousands of miles, the
Roaring Forties can flay and blast the sea to awesome proportions. In
these waters, supertankers snap like Kit-Kats. Others simply disappear.
To the old salt, I learnt later, the Bermuda Triangle is not the short
straw. And, why did we sight albatross . . . ?
December 9
THE seas abated and we arrived in Durban to docks, not anchorages.
There was a buzz about this beautiful city. I walked downtown to send a
couple of faxes. I was given such an over-generous deal for dollars to
rands that I later reckoned my faxes were freebies in exchange for hard
currency.
Afternoon, we bussed to the Valley of a Thousand Hills outside the
city. We passed the Rob Roy Hotel, the Dunrobin Garden Nurseries, the
Balmoral Tearooms, and the Kinbrace Arms. Was this really the way to the
Zulu heartlands?
In the country now, we were dropped at a craft shop. Then Zulu huts.
Then Zulus dancing. Well, sort of -- more high-kicking. Boom. Boom.
Boom. Kick. Kick. Kick. Not a lot to worry the Royal Ballet here. A mile
further on, we looked in on a crocodile farm. Lots of crocs doing what
they seem to do best. Nothing. The lush countryside, however, was
magnificent. If you can, go! But give the crocs a miss.
On the way back, our tour guide rattled off South African snippets.
For example, all houses, shack or shanty, will have electricity by 2000.
But on the downside, burglary is up. No use having an electric socket
without something to plug into it, I figured. The mineral wealth of this
country is bewildering. But he was getting too detailed now. I'm afraid
I lost interest as the boat reappeared.
December 10
THE friendly Filipino crew put on a Folkloric Show which met with huge
applause, more for their tireless efforts, I suspected, than for their
musical talents. They're not well-paid and they serve on board for
10-month stretches at a time (many with young families back home). But
recommended tips for, say, a cabin steward who tends 30 cabins, are five
dollars per cabin per day. Most retire in five years but an eager
waiting-list ''queues'' to replace them.
December 11
THE ship berthed timeously in Port Elizabeth at 7am. It was Sunday in
P E (local parlance) and I was hunting for a shop. A notice proclaimed
Ja! Ons is oop Sondag! Open on Sunday? I guessed right. Small in
comparison to Durban, P E is quintessentially English, with bungalows in
leafy surrounds, manicured lawns and tea roses. Jean Brodie would have
approved -- the twee area is called ''Morningside''!
For a smallish town, I marvelled at the size of the rugby stadium. But
these sports-crazed people have eight of them throughout the country and
the excitement generated by the Rugby World Cup is at fever pitch. It
follows, then, that sports sanctions hurt and hurt bad.
December 12
THE cruise liner followed the coastline round the Cape. On the port
side, little Robben Island with its one-man prison hove into view. Then,
gingerly, Marco Polo nosed into Cape Town, Table Mountain lying sentinel
behind as majorettes and jazz bands marched, twirled, and tooted along
the quayside. Below, three Dick Turpin lookalikes in velvet frock-coats,
tricorn hats, and silk hose either had taken leave of their senses in
the sweltering heat aggravated by an ozone hole above the city or had
taken a wrong turning for the pantomime.
''Look!'' passengers exclaimed excitedly, ''there's Woody! How did he
get ashore?'' as Noel filmed the ship's entry into harbour. ''By the
pilot boat, you goons,'' I muttered to myself. Cape Town, 3170 miles on
and for us the end of the line.

THE McDonald's fast-food chain is holding talks with a view to opening
its first outlet in a Scottish hospital, it was revealed yesterday.
The Southern General NHS Trust in Glasgow has confirmed that it has
been having discussions with the burger company about taking over one of
the units in its shopping mall.
Trust chiefs are consulting Greater Glasgow Health Board, which has
been actively promoting a food and health policy in a bid to improve the
diet of the city's population, about the move.
The shopping mall was opened five years ago and the unit in question
is currently occupied by a cafeteria run by the Red Cross. The charity
has failed in its bid to retain the let.
Mr Robert Calderwood, chief executive of the trust, said he believed
the introduction of McDonald's would give the hospital a full range of
catering facilities, including a staff restaurant and a coffee room in
the Institute of Neurosciences, both run by the in-house catering team,
and WRVS snack bars in the maternity unit and the rehabilitation
facility.
He said that no decision had been taken yet and the trust's board
would discuss the matter further at its next meeting later this month.
A trust spokesman said the retail units had been built as a commercial
venture and, after five years, the lets had been reviewed. The aim had
been to maximise the facilities for staff, patients, and visitors, both
in the quality of the service offered and the commercial return.
The hospital had always enjoyed a harmonious relationship with the Red
Cross but it was felt that the bid by McDonald's was ''the most
advantageous from all points of view''.
He added that Greater Glasgow Health Board had been consulted about
''the acceptability'' of McDonald's as far as GGHB's food policy was
concerned, and a response was awaited.
Launched two years ago, the health board's food and health policy is
aimed at improving the diet of Glaswegians and making them aware of the
importance of cutting the intake of fat and increasing the intake of
fruit and vegetables.
McDonald's has outlets at hospitals in the USA but its only British
operation of this nature so far is a restaurant which it has been
running at Guy's Hospital in London for more than a year.
Mr Robert Parker, spokesman for the chain, said the Southern General
venture was still at a ''speculative'' stage. Asked if McDonald's was
considering opening outlets at other Scottish hospitals, he said there
was no plan to target hospitals.
He added: ''We are looking at business opportunities throughout
Scotland. If other hospitals were to come along, we might be
interested.''
Questioned about the criticism frequently levelled against fast food
on health grounds, Mr Parker said: ''McDonald's food is nutritious and
we hope people would take it as part of a balanced diet.''
The possibility of a McDonald's coming to the Southern General was
described as ''a wonderful opportunity'' by nutrition expert Professor
Michael Lean of Glasgow University.
He said: ''I would see this as an opportunity for McDonald's to use
its skills to take on the responsibility of providing healthful,
balanced meals in a health outlet.
''I would be looking for any caterer in a hospital environment to take
on those responsibilities. If you are providing meals, they should be
balanced meals taking on the requirements of the prevailing food and
health policies.''
Professor Lean added: ''We cannot achieve dietary health in this
country without co-operation and enthusiasm from the food retail and
catering industries.''
A spokeswoman for the Glasgow branch of the Red Cross said: ''We have
run a cafeteria at the Southern General for many years and we were told
last year that we would have to tender for renewal now that the hospital
was a trust. We tendered and we were not successful. I don't know
anything about who is taking over.''
She added: ''Although it is a retail outlet, we feel it is also a
service which we are providing for people.''
It was run as a profit-making concern, she said, and the profits
helped the charity provide other services in the Glasgow area.

SHADOW Chancellor Gordon Brown yesterday called for a new war on
poverty and unemployment in a response to the Rowntree Foundation's
report that the gap between rich and poor in Britain is at its widest
for 50 years.
The responsibility for the rise of inequality lies squarely with the
Government, which has presided over a Britain now more divided than it
has been for generations, Mr Brown said.
''Making the rich richer has not made the poor richer,'' he said.
''A privileged elite has become richer at the expense of the vast
majority.''
Mr Brown, addressing the Local Government Anti-Poverty Alliance in
Edinburgh, said the true importance of the Rowntree report is that a
broad-based commission has demolished the central Conservative arguments
about their economic and social policies.
What is clear is that poverty and inequality can be tackled only by
dealing at root with their causes. By doing so, middle-income as well as
low-income Britain will benefit.
This requires not just a new understanding of what has gone wrong but
a new political will to do what is right in the interests of social
justice and economic efficiency, he said.
As the Rowntree report shows, the right-wing Thatcherite approach of
laissez-faire and deregulation has failed and been seen to fail.
However, Mr Brown added: ''What is also clear is that old solutions --
relying on an old welfare state which concentrates only on an ambulance
service for the poor, on the consequences of poverty, not its causes --
are also inadequate.
''Dealing with the consequences of this problem -- through the benefit
system -- can only alleviate it, not eradicate it. We need to deal with
the causes of poverty at source.
Mr Brown said the report shows that inequality of income in Britain is
higher than at any time for 50 years, wage inequality is higher than at
any time since 1886, and regional inequality higher than at any time in
the last 30 years.
Unemployment is costing every British family #20 a week, the direct
cost of economic failure, Mr Brown claimed.
Mr Brown said inequality and poverty had risen as a deliberate part of
the Tories' economic and social strategy.
While the wages of the bottom 10% of earners are no higher today than
in 1979, the pay of top directors was up 551% in a decade.
Addressing what needed to be done, Mr Brown said a major welfare to
work programme would help the young, families, and the long-term
unemployed.
The centrepiece of a programme to put the long-term unemployed back to
work should be Labour's #75 a week tax rebate to employers who took on
those who had been unemployed for more than two years.
This programme would cost #100m in its first year but would save money
in its second and get 300,000 long-term unemployed into jobs in its
first year.
Mr Brown said a new war on poverty was needed in the interests of the
whole community.

GLASGOW councillors arriving for the inauguration of a new Lord
Provost were yesterday greeted by angry employees.
They had to make their way past around 20 placard-waving shop stewards
from the city's museums and art galleries, who were protesting over
proposed jobs cuts and pay changes.
Mr Willie McGonigle, a steward for the Transport and General Workers'
Union said: ''We're protesting against plans to bring in part-time staff
at lower wages in museum shops in Glasgow.
Claiming the plans had been put forward by museum director Julian
Spalding, he added: ''We are also objecting to a proposal to cut the
number of museum assistant posts by eleven. We feel this will affect
security.''
They include replacing museum assistants in museum shops with a
mixture of part time and full time staff paid a substantially lower
salary.
''We understand that jobs which are currently done by museum
assistants will be done by people recruited on the council's lowest
salary scale -- around #3000-a-year less.''
Late last year, proposals by Mr Spalding to franchise the operation of
the shops to private companies were thrown out by Labour councillors.
A spokesman for Mr Spalding said nothing had been decided on the issue
since then.
On the subject of a reduction in job numbers, he said security would
not be compromised and no compulsory redundancies would take place.

SHETLANDER Ronnie Smith, was last night elected general secretary of
Scotland's biggest teachers' union, the Educational Institute of
Scotland.
Mr Smith, 43, a former principal teacher of Latin and Modern Studies
who became a full-time official of the union six years ago, succeeds Mr
Jim Martin, who resigned to take up a senior personnel post with leading
life assurance society Scottish Amicable.
At the first count, Mr Smith secured an overall majority of votes in
the EIS council -- the union's main decision-making body between annual
conferences -- which has about 140 representatives drawn from the local
associations, or branches, throughout Scotland.
He polled nearly 64% of the votes.
Obviously delighted to have been elected, he said last night: ''I have
some sense of honour that I have been given the chance to become general
secretary.
''I am also pleased that I got such support from the council, given
the strength of the field.''
He beat off challenges from fellow full-time official Mr Ian McKay,
and elected members Mr George MacBride and Mr Eric Young to win the
post, which carries a salary of about #48,000.
Some council members believed Mr Fred Forrester, EIS deputy general
secretary, should have been on the short leet for the leader's job.
However, they failed to secure sufficient votes for a move to postpone,
and make changes to, the selection process.
Mr Smith, who is married with two children, is a graduate in Latin and
Economic History of Aberdeen University. He has worked assiduously in
the background for the EIS on pay, conditions, and legal matters.
An official whose attention to detail is legendary, he has great
respect for the EIS, and is highly regarded among trade union officials
outside the institute.
He is an honest, modest, and popular man who has been happy to stay
out of the limelight, but that will change with his appointment to lead,
organise, and manage Scotland's fifth, and the UK's twelfth, biggest
union.

THE so-called ''Rout of Moy'' when a blacksmith and four farm
labourers turned back a Government force of 1500 men and a famous
MacCrimmon piper predicted his own death in the skirmish has,
understandably, always been overshadowed by the momentous events at
Culloden eight weeks later.
We've already seen that the incident at Moy threw up two Jacobite
heroines, Lady Anne Mackintosh, who despite her husband serving with the
Government regiment in Inverness, raised the clan for the Stuart cause,
and an innkeeper's daughter who is said to have run nine miles to Moy
Hall to warn Bonnie Prince Charlie of the secret night march and the
kidnap plan.
Lord Loudon had left Inverness convinced that he had sealed off the
town and that complete surprise would be achieved. However, the arrival
of the servant girl allowed Charles ''in his robe de chambre, nightcap,
and slippers'' to escape into the mountains, where he spent the night in
concealment.
Lady Mackintosh, having seen her Prince off safely into the night,
sent Donald Fraser, the blacksmith of Hoy, and four others to take up
position on the moor road from Inverness and await the Government
column.
The wily blacksmith ordered his companions to fire on his signal, not
in a volley but in a ''running fire''. From their hiding places the
Highlanders screamed the war cries of the Camerons, Macdonalds, and
Mackintoshes at the top of their voices. The smith himself is supposed
to have shouted: ''Down upon them and give no quarter''. All this, of
course, was designed to let the opposition think they were facing the
entire Jacobite army. Effective it was.
The advance guard under MacLeod of MacLeod broke and turned to run. In
the darkness and confusion they were convinced that the ''rebel'' army
lay before them. They fled and, according to the Jacobite version at
least, never halted until they reached the barracks at Inverness.
The only victim of this remarkable encounter was MacLeod's hereditary
piper Donald Ban MacCrimmon, reputedly one of the most talented pipers
in Scotland. Ironically, he may have been a Jacobite sympathiser. As
Fitzroy Maclean explains in his biography of Bonnie Prince Charlie, the
piper fell in that first salvo of shots, which was designed to give the
impression of an army in hiding. Before leaving Skye, MacCrimmon, who
was said to possess the second sight, had composed a prophetic lament --
''I'll Return No More -- MacLeod shall come back, but MacCrimmon shall
never''.
In his own account of the rout of Moy, Lord Loudon told of the
confusion among the main body of troops as the advance guard came under
fire. He had to stand in front of the muzzles to prevent his nervy
soldiers from firing on the advance guard as they drifted back in twos
and threes. When he came to count his troops he found that at least a
third had taken to their heels and decided that it would be ''improper,
especially in the condition of the men, to march on a superior force who
must be prepared to receive me''.
By morning Loudon discovered that 200 men had deserted and it was
decided to abandon Inverness and flee by the Kessock Ferry to Ross and
Cromarty. As they marched on an abandoned Inverness the doomed Jacobite
army had the upper hand and the initiative for the final time.

Hugh Ouston witnesses the death of a bird and wonders how much it
mattered.
FRASERBURGH in winter feels like the end of the earth. On the rocks at
the back of the pier the Arctic seemed just over the horizon to the
north and there, as if to prove it, swam a disorientated little auk,
like a starling-sized penguin in the cold boiling sea. Hardly had we
identified it than it took off, but something in its flight spoke of
weakness to the ever-watchful gulls and within a minute it was knocked
down, flipped over, tugged away, and finally gulped down whole by a
massive black-back. It was too far from home.
Little auks come down from the advancing pack ice in the winter but it
takes a desperate shortage of their food, zooplankton, perhaps driven
deep by stormy weather, to disperse them to our shores. Northerly gales
push these ''wrecks'', often thousands strong, down the east coast where
they end up on the lawns of seaside towns and on stretches of water far
inland. After the wreck of February 1953, over 180 of the little bodies
were picked up from the beaches of Berwickshire alone. Oil kills them
too, nearly 500 on the Aberdeenshire coast in 1970, though the Braer
incident seems to have spared this species compared to some.
In the calm days following a wreck survivors can be seen from
headlands buzzing north again. They are flying to rejoin some 30 million
others, for this is possibly the commonest seabird in the world. They
breed in huge colonies in those romantic-sounding high Arctic
archipelagos -- Spitzbergen, Franz Josef Land. I often think of the
death of that individual bird and wonder how much it mattered to the
species, but would rather not think too far, as a member of a species
numbering 50 million in these islands alone. Better to wrap up warm as
dusk comes on and turn away to a hot tea or a cosy howff.

What is good value in fishing tackle these days? Paul Young considers
the survival options.
I HAVE, perhaps, a spot of good news for my mother. I may be about to
grow up. Mind you, it's not entirely certain, but there are glimmerings.
In common with many mothers, she has, since I was about five, been at a
loss to know why I have never grown up, but surely every woman knows the
answer is that I'm a man and they never grow up.
The first hint of this impending maturity came one day on the Tay late
last season. I was fly-fishing one of the lower beats in a screaming
gale and was finding it difficult to cover the lies where the salmon
were tantalisingly heading and tailing. So of course, the inclination is
to wade a little deeper, and a little more and the next thing you know,
the weight of water at your back is pushing you downstream and you are
struggling to keep your footing. If you come across the double perils of
rolling gravel or large boulders and deep scours, it could be that you
are, as Eddie Waring used to say, ''in for an early bath''.
Now, I didn't actually get a soaking, but at one point I stopped and
took stock. Here I was in the middle of Scotland's mightiest river, a
wind gusting and pulling at me, finding it difficult to keep my balance
and I had neither a wading stick nor any kind of buoyancy aid or
life-saving equipment strapped to my ageing body.
In common with many anglers, life-preservation has perhaps come fairly
well down my list of priorities over the years. There is always the
thought that falling in either when wading or from a boat is the kind of
thing that happens to someone else. So far, I've been lucky but standing
there in the Tay, I felt very small and vulnerable.
I have taken a ducking once or twice over the years, but have been
lucky in that the events were fairly trivial. A summer evening on the
North Esk saw me misjudging a step in the darkness and ending up beside
the finnock I was trying to land. I have a memory of the fish splashing
in front of my nose and my bunnet floating off downstream. It was a mild
night, but even then I was not prepared for the shock of the cold water.
My first reaction was to take in a mighty breath . . . no problem if
your head is above water, but what if you went in face down? And in
February?
So, I decided that I wanted to give myself the best chance should an
accident happen. I got myself a wading stick -- a great help in
negotiating the underwater boulders -- but choosing a life preserver was
a more difficult matter. There are many options available and the most
important thing is to be aware of what you are buying and what it will
do for you.
There is a difference between a flotation device and a life-jacket and
between manually operated and automatic. The most important difference
is that a buoyancy aid will provide assistance to a conscious person who
can swim and is able to inflate the device, whereas an automatic
life-jacket will inflate on contact with water and keep the head of an
unconscious person out of water, turning them over if necessary.
Buoyancy aids tend to be smaller than life-jackets, sometimes coming in
the form of braces, while life-jackets can be incorporated into fishing
waistcoats or jackets.
It is worth thinking why you are buying one of the devices. I must say
I looked at a worse-case scenario. Let's say a frosty day with a cold
river in February or early March. Several layers of warm clothing and
the neoprene waders for extra warmth. You are in a boat and stand up to
warm the extremities and your partner asks you to hand him his tackle
bag from the front of the boat. You lean over to oblige, your foot
catches on the strap of your own bag, you miss the gunwale as you search
for your balance and your chest hits the edge of the boat. It dips as
your weight takes effect and you are in the water, severely winded.
The first thing you do is try to grab a breath, but you are face down
in the freezing water. This is when you are glad you are wearing an
automatic life-jacket to BS 3595. The gas capsule fires automatically,
the jacket inflates in an instant, throwing your body face-up, allowing
you to get that much-needed breath of air. You are floating down-river
and are picked up by the boat, freezing cold, completely soaked, and
still struggling for breath. But alive.
So, if I'm asked what I consider good value in fishing tackle these
days, I have to say that around #200 for a pretty good chance of
survival seems fine to me and beats one of those American rods at #500.
I know that sounds dull and boring, but I think it might just give a
hint of some kind of maturity. What say you, mother?

<HEADLINE>Blair hails the 'defining moment' of Cabinet disunity on single currency. Major's truce on Europe hit by infighting</HEADLINE>

THE Cabinet's fragile truce over Europe was in tatters yesterday after
senior Tories squabbled fiercely over the single European currency.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the ''defining moment'' of the
Cabinet's disunity on Europe had arrived, as Conservatives fought about
Thursday's speech by the Chancellor.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's speech was seen as being favourable to Britain
eventually signing up to a single European currency.
Mr Blair said ''the gulf between the Chancellor and his critics,
including those in the Cabinet, seems unbridgeable now''.
His comment followed remarks by the Cabinet's leading Euro-sceptic Mr
Michael Portillo, the Employment Secretary that it was ''unhelpful'' to
go beyond the position spelt out by the Prime Minister, that Britain
would not join a single currency in 1996 or 1997.
Former Cabinet Minister Lord Tebbit, warned Mr Major that his job
could be at stake. He said: ''Events are shaping up now very much in the
way they shaped before the fall of Mrs Thatcher. There is a divergence
of policy between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister.''
Some Euro-sceptics are concerned that, if Mr Major moves too far in
their direction, powerful Europhile Cabinet Ministers like Mr Kenneth
Clarke, Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, and Mr Michael
Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, could stage a coup to
replace him.
Mr Clarke, interviewed on ITN, accused Lord Tebbit of mischief making
and revealed that the Prime Minister had worked with him on the speech
he made to an audience of pro-European Tories.
He said: ''Norman has a habit of trying to make peoples' blood run
cold,'' adding, ''at least you have to admit I've got a debate going''.
Speaking in Oxfordshire, the Prime Minister defended Mr Clarke who, he
said, had pointed out that ''we are a long way away from the right
economics for a single currency.'' The Chancellor had done no more than
make the point he had been making since 1990, he added.
The Prime Minister has, in fact, obtained Cabinet unity over the
position in the next three years, made easier by the fact that few of
them believe that the economic convergence required to establish a
single currency can be achieved as early as 1997.
This view was supported by one of Britain's European Commissioners Sir
Leon Brittan, who added that, by 1999, ''a critical mass'' of EU members
would probably be able to go ahead.
Mr Blair interviewed on BBC Radio 4's World At One, said, that unless
the Government could come to a clear view ''not merely the Chancellor as
an individual'', it was extremely difficult to see how Britain's
interests could be properly represented.
He said that, if the economic conditions were right for considering a
single currency, a Labour government would have the task of ''political
persuasion'' that going for a single currency was the right course.
He said: ''You would have to carry the people of this country with
you.'' This appeared to acknowledge the possibility of a referendum.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: ''The
only guarantee of an honest and open debate is to let the people have
the final say.'' He appealed to the two larger parties not to try and
organise a boycott of the referendum debate his party is sponsoring in
the Commons on Monday.
Labour have announced a one line Whip, technically leaving MPs free to
vote either way without fear of being disciplined, but a clear
indication that the leadership would rather they did not vote at all.
Government Whips have yet to decide whether to try to actively
discourage Conservative MPs voting for the Liberal Democrat motion,
which calls for a referendum on any major constitutional change in
Britain's relations with Europe.
Europhile Tory MPs, who have consistently been outquoted publicly by
their Euro-sceptic colleagues, were hailing the Chancellor's speech as
the beginning of a fight-back and expressing their concern that Mr Major
has gone too far to try to keep the sceptical wing on side.
That wing, however, has shown its strength by obtaining 107 signatures
for a Commons motion congratulating the Prime Minister on his robust
approach to Europe.

THE battle of comic icons begins this summer when the hi-tech
firepower of Judge Dredd takes on Batman in a battle to build up the
biggest box-office takings. Val Kilmer will star in Batman Forever which
opens in June, while America's national holiday, the Fourth of July, has
been renamed Judgment Day for Sly Stallone's latest dip into mayhem and
destruction.
Stallone may have won the role but true Dredd heads will always
imagine Clint Eastwood as the man behind the mask. The letter pages of
2000AD had a thousand amateur artists' ideas of Eastwood as Dredd.
However, the decade it took to drag the character to the cinema screen
left only one true action man.
Dozens of scripts have been written since the movie options were first
bought in the early eighties by Charlie Lippincott. Writers such as Tim
Hunter and James Crumley have tried and failed to transfer the character
from the page to the silver screen. Success was finally made by a novel
approach in the early ninties when William Wisher, who co-scripted
Terminator II, was brought in and simply given a list of items to
include in the script.
''To be honest I got the impression, and it was semi-confirmed
afterwards, that Will Wisher had never actually read Dredd or been given
any to read. He was basically told to write an action movie and given a
shopping list of things to put in it.'' Said Kev Walker, a regular Dredd
artist and hired production designer. The shooting script now appears to
be by John Fasano and Steven E DeSouza.
However the director had long been familiar with the character. Danny
Cannon, the 25-year-old, who's directorial debut The Young Americans
starred Harvey Keital, grew up reading the violent exploits of the 22nd
century's supercop. On August 3 the $65m production began its 17-week
shoot in London's Shepperton studio.
The plot involves the framing of Judge Dredd by his clone brother
Rico. Dredd must then strive to clear his name and avert the actions of
the infamous Angel gang, which includes Mean Machine, a psychotic with a
giant claw for an arm and a dial on his forehead to control his moods, 1
means surly, 4 is just downright mean.
While in the comic Dredd drank down destruction without ever having to
lift off his helmet, Sylvester Stallone will, to the fury of some fans,
show the real face punks fear.

Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Judge Dredd is coming to the cinema
screens this summer. Stephen McGinty meets the character's creators.
JUDGE Dredd didn't pay for the eleventh-century church that Scots
comic writer Alan Grant lives in with his wife Sue, a ghostly monk, and
the 3000-year-old head of an Egyptian Princess. No. ''This is the house
that Batman bought,'' said the 44-year-old anarchistic author of both DC
Comic's caped crusader and the stone-faced 22nd-century lawman now
chiselled into the form of Sylvester Stallone and ready to be slammed at
cinema screens next summer.
The cape and cowl of Gotham City's dark knight were scuffed and on the
floor when Alan Grant and John Wagner picked them up. Detective Comics,
the character's debut title, was selling a little over 60,000 copies a
month and the decision to bring in Judge Dredd's powerful writing
partnership was a last stand before inevitable closure. John Wagner left
the title after writing five issues, then the movie was released. Such
was the hype for the latex Batman that sales soon jumped to a peak of
600,000.
It was the subsequent royalty cheques that paid for the converted
church in the little village outside Colchester where Alan Grant lives,
a 40-minute drive from the home of John Wagner, friend for 25 years and
the creator, with Spanish artist Carlos Ezquerra, of British comics'
strongest character. Joe Dredd first appeared in issue 2 of 2000AD where
the post-apocalyptic cop dispensed harsh and brutal justice to the 800
million bizarre inhabitants of the teeming Mega-City-One.
John Wagner, alone for the first two years and then with Alan Grant
for the next 15, squeezed a character and his own mythology into eight
pages every week. Judge Dredd quickly became a cult, not among the
law-and-order brigade who would applaud his extreme actions but among
fringe groups. Punks, goths, schoolkids, and academics, anyone who loved
a story, enjoyed dark humour and drank irony spiked with a little
arsenic. Thrash metal band Anthrax recorded a song, I am the Law, in
tribute. Joe Dredd/Mess with him and you'll wind up dead. Not a good
song, but a song.
However, Dredd's hour in comics is passing. The entrenched popularity
of the mid-to-late eighties is over. Sales of 2000AD have steadily
declined. Together Wagner and Grant have created an act which cannot be
followed, despite dozens of attempts. Many now in the British comic
industry believe 2000AD could close after the summer's big movie boost
is over. Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd will be a generic action movie
disguised as a comic character. Dredd will survive in the Megazine and
his two new American titles but what these two Scotsmen created was
more, much more.
ALAN Grant is driving a Honda Prelude, his personal batmobile, when he
collects me from Colchester station. Life in the quiet villages around
the Sussex town seldom imitates the mayhem packed into comic panels but
once in a while . . . It was only weeks after he wrote an issue of Lobo,
the best-selling comic about an inter-galactic hitman, in which Lobo's
bike is trashed by the mailman, that the word ''IRONY'' flashed on to
his windscreen with the impact of a hit-and-run Royal Mail van. Grant
pursued but unfortunately didn't have the necessary weapons to finish
the story.
Soon we are winding down a farm track and the tale with it. Arriving
at the church, which is mentioned in the Domesday Book, I remember
Rebecca and ''Last night I dreamt of Manderley . . . '' It's that
impressive. Built in 1125 on the site of a Roman church, its
stained-glass windows are among the best in Britain, untouched by
Cromwell. The gravestone of a women called Martha Death lies against the
house wall and the surrounding fields contain over 180 graves.
It feels strange to come to a house so steeped in the past, to talk
about the distant future and a man and a world that will never be.
Beside the fire in the raised living-room and in front of the stone
crosses, dinosaur fossil, and antique statues of Buddha, Alan Grant sits
crosslegged and talks with an unplaceable Scots burr.
He was born in Bristol in 1949, and his parents soon moved to
Midlothian. A perfect score in his arithmetic O-level led to a brief
peek into banking before he moved to Dundee and an apprenticeship in
words with D C Thomson. There he wrote horoscopes, subbed novels, and
met John Wagner, a flatmate's friend. The teenage boys sealed a
friendship over a boozy lunch that led to Grant drinking with punks in
the pub toilet.
Wagner, who was born in America before being brought across the
Atlantic to Greenock, was also working at D C Thompson at the time,
before following Grant to London and IPC Magazines where he worked on
Honey, Sandy, and Princess Tina. Growing increasingly depressed while
working on the sixties teen magazine, Love Affair, Grant left to become
caretaker of Cromarty House in the north of Scotland. ''To the locals my
girlfriend and I were John and Yoko, we had the hippie hair and big
coats.''
Grant returned to Dundee to tackle Highers he already had as an easy
year. But was hauled before the principal who demanded to know what he
aspired to. Thinking on the spot, Grant answered: divinity. ''I didn't
even know if there was such a course but within a weekend he got me a
place in St Andrews.'' Wagner was the replacement caretaker in Cromarty
but was fired after a house guest stole the slates.
Darkness has descended by the time John Wagner, a quietly spoken hulk,
too tall for his jeans, arrives and sits down with the story of Dredd's
creation. As a unit, Wagner Grant, as their comic credit often read, are
inseparable, and can finish each other's sentences. But drama is
personal and a few years ago they split the writing chores rather than a
friendship. Recently, however, they've returned and collaborated on The
Bogie Man and both Batman/Dredd team-ups.
''Writing comics I have always found that bastards work, and Dredd is
a beautiful combination of good guy and bastard. The idea was to have a
cop who wasn't just a cop, but far more authoritarian. A man who would
administer laws that were extremely harsh.'' The comic 2000AD was
launched by the first editor, Pat Mills, and John Wagner in 1977; the
name ''Judge Dredd'' was thought up by Mills for another character but
given to Wagner's new supercop.
Dredd's look, his Lawmaster bike, and the city itself were designed by
the character's first artist, Carlos Ezquerra. Speaking in London he
said: ''He had to look like what he was, Judge, Jury, and Executioner,
and the eagle on his shoulder represented Justice.'' Wagner also gave
Ezquerra the poster from the movie Death Race 2000 as a guide which
ironically starred Sly Stallone.
In over 700 issues of 2000AD Judge Dredd has never removed his helmet,
yet the idea behind the notion was accidental. In a very early issue
Dredd removed his helmet but the artist drew such a wimpy face that it
was blacked out and a strip which claimed it was too horrible to view
replaced it. John Wagner then milked the idea for laughs.
The 22nd century imagined by Wagner and Grant is a totalitarian police
state controlled by the Judges, men, and women who enter the Academy of
Law as five-year-olds, and emerge 15 years later in love with the very
letter of the law which bans sugar and restricts smoking. You would
expect the authors to weep at the weakness of the Criminal Justice Act.
John Wagner is more interested in the dark laughter Dredd draws from
his over-the-top behaviour. Often stories were ripped from tabloids and
spun 100 years into the future. There was always a strong element of
cultural reflection to Judge Dredd. When Conservative MP Harvey Proctor
was deselected, a spanking incident would take place at Harvey Proctor
block. Stacy Keach was released for possession of cocaine in the week a
Kacy Steach story appeared about sugar. ''It was of its moment.'' said
Grant.
One story, however, in which the shroud of humour was removed
concerned the democratic movement and how the Judges crushed and
destroyed it. It evolved into a graphic novel in which Wagner wrote:
''Freedom -- Power to the people -- Democracy . . . The Great American
Dream. Don't kid yourself. We tried to before. Believe me, it didn't
work. You can't trust the people. So dream on, creep. But just remember
-- that's all it is, a dream . . . America is dead. This is the real
world.''
When director Paul Verhoeven took over the cameras on Robocop, he
demanded that the script be beefed up and the tone brought in line with
a comic he had read. He then gave the writers copies of Judge Dredd to
study. Science-fiction writer Harlan Ellison in his review wrote: ''It
is also, clearly and shockingly, a rip-off of the Judge Dredd comic
strip . . .'' The cinematic potential of Judge Dredd has been recognised
since before it was first optioned in 1983. Dozens of scripts and
treatments were written including one by Wagner and Grant.
A few years ago the comic writers worked every night for a couple of
months and believed they had found a way to translate the
two-dimensional character, successfully, on to the big screen. However,
when money was discussed they were offered only 20% of the
screenwriters' minimum. Despite borrowing the Hollywood agent of Batman
screenwriter Sam Hamm to negotiate, the figure was never raised, the
treatment never delivered.
Now with the film directed by Danny Cannon, a regular ''Dredd head'',
and starring Stallone and Armand Assante, John Wagner appears to be more
relaxed. Sylvester Stallone called. ''We had a chat and exchanged mutual
compliments. He seemed to have a good grip of what the character was
about.'' But Wagner never visited the set.
''A lot of people are carping about it and worrying that it's not
going to be true to Dredd, but myself, I don't care. The criteria for
making a movie are different from that of making a comic and they have
to do what they have to do. From what I've heard, visually, it will be
spectacular. I'm looking forward to seeing it . . . I don't care if we
have to see Sylvester Stallone's face . . . Dredd is yesterday's news
and I'm happy to let him trundle along.''
The next morning I travel to London by train with Sue Grant and her
merry band of passengers protesting against British Rail's decision to
ban smoking. Each morning the squad of smokers hijack a compartment,
remove the No Smoking signs and light up. Both BBC and ITN have focused
on their actions and despite harassment by Transport Police there have
been no arrests. With both train and occupants hurtling towards the
future, I can only shudder at how Dredd would react.

Ninian Dunnett goes behind the scenes.
IT'S a cause of concern to many in these sensitive times: just up
Edinburgh's Corstorphine Hill from the smoke and thunder of the A8, the
Siberian tiger paces, the golden eagle flaps in its cage, the gorilla
stares and roars.
As zoos have evolved from money-making entertainments towards centres
for conservation and education, Edinburgh's reputation places it among
the best in Britain. But the ethical issues are full of problems and
paradox. The zoo is hugely dependent on the punters coming through its
gate -- around 500,000 a year -- to generate the #3m annual turnover
which pays for its conservation work. But the attractions which draw the
public, like the lions and polar bears, are often those which currently
flourish in the wild, and which it is difficult to provide for
adequately in imprisonment.
Opened in 1913, the zoo's 82-acre site is home to more than 1000
animals of 150 species, and provides employment for 120 humans, from
blacksmiths to barmen, gardeners to vets. Among its animal management
staff, Graham Catlow, 40, has been head keeper (primates) for six years.
G C: ''Elephant keepers have often been called strange keepers.
There's an aura about an elephant, something either you like or you
don't, I don't know what it is, and even now it wouldn't take much to
have me working with elephants again.
''Before I came here I was a keeper for 16 years at the new zoo in
Blackpool, my home town, and as well as elephants I worked with the
gorillas, orangs, and chimps. They had lots of young animals in, and we
had a lot of contact with them. At first it's just a case of you stand
and let them come over and explore and sniff you, and it was quite
worrying really, particularly with the gorillas. They'd hold your hand
and pull you a bit -- it's the grip I remember -- and they're much
stronger than you expect.''
Born in Glasgow, Dr Miranda Stevenson did a PhD in animal behaviour
before starting as a keeper at Chester Zoo. In 1979 she came to
Edinburgh as curator, managing the animal department.
M S: ''I think everyone starts in this sort of work because they've
got an affinity with animals. If you want a good career with potential
promotion and particularly high salaries, the British zoo world is not
the place to go.
''We do get concerned by some of our older enclosures, but it's a
question of economics. I found the elephants very disturbing when I came
here, and we decided not to keep them because we couldn't give them
adequate conditions. But we've halved the number of species here in 15
years, and some visitors are saying there aren't enough animals. So
there's always a conflict, and you just have to keep pushing the
conflict in the direction of the animals.
''Things do go wrong, too. One of the worst days was when all the
chimps got out on a busy Sunday -- the sort of nightmare you think'll
never happen. They roamed all over the zoo and into the car-park, and
one of them got into Cairnmuir Road and sat on somebody's garden wall.
But by some miracle we got them all back.''
Robert MacLeod, 37, is one of 11 keepers in the zoo's bird section.
R M: ''I started as the lowest of the low here when I left school in
Edinburgh, and as time's gone by I've got a wee bit of promotion here,
there, and everywhere, and now I spend an amount of time with the
penguins.
''It does open your eyes to a few things. We often say the fences are
there to keep the people from the animals. Ice-lolly sticks, chewing
gum, coins, and things like that thrown into the water -- it's amazing
how stupid people are.
''But most people outside are very fascinated when they hear what you
do. It's not like somebody saying they work in a bank. And there's four
or five of us here involved in an indoor sports club, and we'll go
across the road to the Struan Hotel for a drink if it's somebody's
birthday or something like that.''

While chewing the fat Norway resists international pressure to stop
hunting the minke whale. Elizabeth Buie reports on the reasons behind
the country's traditional obstinacy.
WHEN it comes to whales, the Norwegians have something of a blind spot
-- although, from their point of view, it is those of us who live in the
non-whaling nations who are blinded by prejudice.
You treat whales like the Indians treat cows -- as if they are sacred
-- the Norwegians tell their critics. For they believe that there is
nothing god-like about the whale, that whales are part of their marine
resource, and if the minke whale population can be sustained even with a
limited number being hunted each year, why should they be treated in any
way different from fish?
This nation with its almost unparalleled record in environmental
protection is determined that the international community should give
its blessing to a resumption of commercial whaling, albeit on a
controlled basis. Yet it faces very strong opposition, often led by
Britain.
In 1985, the International Whaling Commission's moratorium on
commercial whaling came into effect, but its ruling included a clause
stating that by 1990 the commission had to undertake a comprehensive
assessment of the effects of the moratorium on whale stocks and to
consider modifying the moratorium and establishing other catch limits. A
revised management procedure of whale stocks was to be set up by the
Scientific Committee of the IWC, but at IWC full meetings in 1990, 1991,
and 1992, the commission failed to re-evaluate the moratorium and catch
quotas, specifying instead new conditions that had to be fulfilled
before catch quotas could be discussed.
Interpreting this as delaying tactics on the part of the non-whaling
nations, Norway made a unilateral decision to resume whaling in 1993 and
for the past two years has set its own quota of under 300 minke whales
to be caught for commercial sale.
By formally reserving its position on the IWC's moratorium, Norway
retained the legal right to resume whaling. But its unilateral action in
resuming whaling over the past two years -- without international
backing -- has resulted in some of its goods being boycotted. It is
therefore important for Norway to have its commercial whaling operation
''legitimised'' by the IWC and for the past two years it has been
pushing IWC members to reach agreement on the supervision and control
aspects of commercial whaling -- two areas which are central to the
conclusion of any Revised Management Scheme which would allow Norway and
other pro-whaling countries to whale under the aegis of the IWC.
For this reason, 53 delegates from 14 IWC member countries -- members
of the IWC's working group on supervision and control -- met in Reine, a
sprawling fishing village in the Lofoten Islands in the part of Norway
that reaches into the Arctic Circle, last week to discuss subjects such
as placing international supervisors, in addition to Norway's national
inspectors, on board whalers.
But Norway's hospitality to the delegates backfired to some extent. In
a bid to show the anti-whaling nations that the small coastal villages
of northern Norway have a long-standing tradition of whaling and an
economic need for whaling revenue, the Norwegians miscalculated.
Certainly, whaling in some form or other has been carried out in these
waters for hundreds of years, but the modern whaling method using
motor-powered fishing boats and modern harpoons is only about 50 years
old.
Delegates, told that the communities on the Lofoten Islands would
suffer disintegration and economic hardship with the loss of whaling
revenue, visited communities of virtually full employment, comfortable
housing, high-quality hospitals and schools, and an infrastructure of
roads and bridges that would be the envy of many rural communities in
Scotland, never mind other fishing communities throughout the world
which have undergone much more radical changes to their industry.
It is true that in the late 1980s, Reine and its neighbouring fishing
communities did face lower incomes, with cod quotas cut because stocks
were low, and no income from whaling. Fishermen who had caught cod in
winter and minke whales in the summer saw their livelihoods if not
threatened, then reduced, and banks agreed to give them a two-year
''holiday'' from their interest repayments. Now, however, thanks largely
to Norway's effective conservation measures, cod quotas have been
increased. Last year, a typical coastal fishing boat, between 50ft and
75ft long, with a crew of six or seven, made between 1.2m and 1.5m
kroner and an additional 400,000 kroner from whaling -- from an average
quota of seven minke whales.
The Norwegian whalers and their families protested strongly that they
did not make that much money from whaling, that it was not worth their
while cheating, and that it was just wonderful to eat whalemeat again.
The local fishermen's union and the fishermen's wives' association
presented a petition to the delegates from the United States, the United
Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, charmingly called ''A Word of
Admonition to Whaling Opponents''. They asked the British and Australian
authorities to withdraw ''the allegations of cruelty with which they
brand our local communities and our local culture''. In a particularly
pointed attack upon the British, the community representatives said:
''In the light of British hunting legislation and practices, the British
Government is not in a position to criticise the hunting legislation of
other countries.''
But if Norway is to convince its opponents -- opponents who are
self-confessedly against the very principle of whaling and who will
continue to vote against commercial whaling for political reasons, even
if they might be persuaded on scientific grounds -- it must prove itself
whiter than white.
Last year, one whaler, the Dag Senior, took a whale over and above its
quota while the Norwegian inspector slept below. Other whalers claim
that they have been let down by their colleague and that he will never
again be issued with another whaling licence. But the incident serves
only to add weight to non-whaling nations' demands for independent
international inspectors to serve on board the whalers and it proves the
financial incentive to cheat.
An Australian scientist carrying out DNA analysis in Japan's major
fishmarkets found minke, fin, and humpback whalemeat from north-east
Atlantic waters. Some conservation groups are convinced the whalemeat
came from Norway.
In 1993, a large package marked ''frozen prawns'' was spotted by an
SAS cargo handler at Fornebu airport at Oslo as it was being loaded on
to a cargo aircraft. The package was oozing blood and on inspection
turned out to be a 3.5 tonnes shipment of whalemeat to South Korea.
Such infringements have not been common, but as long as there remains
a huge demand for whalemeat in Japan and other Far Eastern countries,
there will be a temptation to break international rules.
For this reason, the ''like-minded'' opponents of whaling are
determined to make Norway pay if it is to resume whaling with the IWC's
say-so. The conditions for any Revised Management Scheme set by the IWC
must, they say, be extremely stringent -- international observers on
board every vessel, satellites and transponders fitted to each vessel,
DNA testing, and a number of other measures. All these measures would be
extremely expensive, but Norway insists that the costs should be met by
all IWC member states. Not surprisingly, the delegates from the
non-whaling countries are not prepared to go home and ask their own
taxpayers to finance a practice of which they disapprove.
The Norwegians' arguments about animal cruelty will not wash either.
They claim that in the past two years, inspectors have reported that
around half the minke whales have been killed instantaneously. Of the
whales that took longer to die, one was alive for around 30 minutes
after being hit, another 57 minutes. The Norwegians admit that they
cannot guarantee 100% success in achieving instantaneous kills. But the
British, among others, maintain that their current record is not good
enough and that there is no real likelihood of a significant
improvement. And the British delegation will not be swayed from that
view by Norwegian claims that deer-culling, fox-hunting, and British
slaughter-house methods are also cruel.
Five days of debate in Reine, then, ended in deadlock last week.
Delegates would only say that they now understood each other's positions
in greater detail. No real concessions were made. And so it is likely to
continue at the IWC's conference in Dublin this May.
The fear is that were Norway to be granted the IWC's approval for
commercial whaling, however limited, Norway itself would extend its
catch to other species of whales; Japan, an IWC member, would also take
up commercial whaling; other non-member countries such as Iceland and
Taiwan would follow suit; and before too long quotas would creep up to
again threaten the survival of many species of whales.
Both sides are now engaged in a waiting game. The Norwegians believe
that their persistence and scientific arguments will eventually win the
day. And their critics believe that if whaling is outlawed for long
enough, the younger generation of Japanese consumers will have lost
their taste for whalemeat and the market for whalers will be lost. It is
a game for those with deep pockets, and plenty of patience -- but the
gains and losses are considerable.

UNLIKELY heroes were in vogue in 1985, as tomorrow night's edition of
Scottish Television's Time of Your Life will reveal as the programme
continues its weekly look back over a decade of change.
Innately and perennially dishevelled, Bob Geldof succeeded in
marshalling the many tribes of rock and pop into a cohesive whole --
Live Aid at Wembley Stadium -- in order to make music and provide
succour for Africa's starving. Later that same summer, at another of
London's hallowed sporting arenas, Lord's cricket ground, Freuchie
journeyed from the far north and defeated the English at their own
googlified game.
Under the wily tutelage of skipper David Christie, a silver-maned
veteran of the outfield, Freuchie overcame Rowledge to lift the National
Village Cricket Club Championship. In the same year, golfer Sandy Lyle
claimed the British Open for Scotland, and everyday Scottish heroes
protested against apartheid during an athletics meeting at Meadowbank
which featured South Africa's Brit-by-invitation, Zola Budd.
Meanwhile an unimpressive-looking chap with a red stain on his bald
pate became leader of Soviet Russia, and in the middle-class heartlands
of Scotland, a steep rates revaluation caused heroic surgings in the
blood of the property-owning bourgeoisie.
Outraged of Kelvinside didn't quite take to the streets bearing
Molotov cocktails in a spontaneous and bloody revolt, but there was much
apoplectic exhaling of All Bran over breakfast tables as the horrifying
news sank in, I can tell you.
Among Scotland's local musical heroes in 1985 you could find a
shaven-headed gay rights activist with a wondrous falsetto voice --
Jimmy Somerville singing You Are My World with the Communards -- and a
golf-playing Derbyshire exile -- Lloyd Cole and his Lost Weekend.
And in 1985 one undisputed Scottish hero departed this world forever
when Jock Stein died in harness as Scotland's manager.

Elizabeth and Ian Mason have packed a great deal into their 80-odd
years and into their art collection, finds Clare Henry.
WHEN Elizabeth and Ian Mason talk about their ''collection of a
lifetime'' it's not just words -- and not just one lifetime. Elizabeth
reaches into a great drawer and comes up with paintings from the 1830s
by her great-great-grandmother.
''Moreover,'' she says proudly, ''all my three children were brought
up within the order of artistic sanctity!'' But then too so was she, and
her mother, as far back as Granny McIndoe from Rothesay who painted
eight precise and very lovely studies of fruit, before packing them
carefully and setting off with her printer/publisher husband on a ship
for New Zealand. ''They were nonconformist. His father was Provost of
Rothesay. The spirit of these women. Setting sail into the unknown for
weeks on end with small children,'' exclaims Elizabeth admiringly.
Art continued to play its part. When Elizabeth's father died, her
mother Sarah became art teacher at Archerfield School near Dunedin.
Sarah was the first pupil at Wellington Art College under their first
teacher, Glasgow Boy James Nairn, who started off in Lenzie, and was one
of the leaders of the pack until he left for New Zealand in 1889.
''My mother got a glimpse of the French Impressionism via Nairn, and
wanted to see the real thing. Eventually she saved up #1000 in guineas
to sail from Christchurch to Paris with her friend Frances Hodgkins --
who's the only New Zealand woman painter in the Tate. But then she met
the handsome Scotsman John McIndoe in Dunedin. She had good legs -- like
me. He went back to Wellington and built a house for her. It proved
irresistible. She cancelled her plans for Paris and married my father.''
Mason's was an ambitious family. Her elder brother became the famous
plastic surgeon, Sir Archibald McIndoe. ''I wanted to be a painter but
it wasn't allowed. My mother thought I might 'get mixed up with men', as
she put it.''
So instead Elizabeth Mason went to Girton College, Cambridge, to study
zoology and later started collecting pictures. Her ''collection of a
lifetime'' includes works by Pat Douthwait, Margaret Morris (''I
attended her pregnancy classes in Glasgow!''), Fionna Carlisle, and
autumn trees by Sir Nicky Fairbairn.
At university she met Ian Mason who became a world expert on animal
breeding. ''I saw he was that rarity: a good man.'' Now both over 80,
they travel a great deal, and always have, beginning when Elizabeth went
to Italy to study prawns, then joined Ian in Algeria where they got
married.
Elizabeth's life continues to read like a novel: Tahiti for her
eighteenth birthday in the 1920s (her mother's watercolours of the
tropical palms and beaches provide a permanent reminder); then the
first-ever tourist visit to Russia for #18 all in. (''It was extremely
cheap even then.'') Long trips to Greece where the family now own no
less than three houses, and 10 years in Rome when Ian was with the World
Health Organisation and Elizabeth made the costumes for Noel Coward's
Bittersweet. ''I have had a very adventurous life. And it's all recorded
in a composite picture -- including a passion flower -- Ian commissioned
in 1989 for her 80th birthday from Tom Wilson.
''Our first purchase was a Shakespearean scene by Alex Zyw. It cost
#50. Ian was earning very little in the zoology department. I was
demonstrating three times a week for which I was paid 15 shillings. It
took us a year to pay for it. I like its subject, the theatricality, its
design and colour. I had a feeling I wouldn't tire of it. Fifty pounds
was quite a lot of money in the early 1950s. I must have wanted it
badly. We've lived with it for all these years and still like it. A
wonderful test of a good picture.''
The next picture, Miracle of Cana, or, as Ian calls it, the
wine-making picture, is by Zelko Kujandzic, a Yugoslav trained as an
icon painter. ''He grinds his own colour. It's not a religious picture
but it does look like an icon.''
Perhaps her most prestigious paintings are the Bellany and two early
oils by Elizabeth Blackadder. ''I had two Bellanys. I gave one to Ricky
Demarco for one of his art auctions when he was in debt. I must have
been mad!'' The Blackadder landscapes from the 1960s ''encapsulate my
two favourite kinds of life: one rich, lush, Mediterranean: the other
pale, cold, Scottish, with a distant church. It reminds us of our home
in Auchtiebuie.''
The Masons have several works acquired from Ricky Demarco over the
years. ''I'm a great Ricky fan. We support his aims. We got our 1968
Neagu picture, our 1967 Ian McKenzie Smith, Erland Brown's picture,
which provides a good journey for the eye, and much more from Ricky.''
They also support the very young and buy from art college shows.
Other treasured pictures include Chagall's drypoint of The Daughters
of Lot; Will Maclean's early oil of a large wave, skate and wheelhouse,
''which speaks tragedy to me''; Edward Gage's landscape; a decorative
David Michie (''which gives me joy''); Peter Bourne's House on the Hill;
Lys Hansen's vigorous female; Anne Gordon's blue flowers; a tiny
Philipson; George Garson's 1966 tile mural (''he taught at Glasgow. I
liked him very much'') and Jack Knox's Third Eye retrospective.
''It's very Matisse, luscious food captured with a wonderful economy.
Cost us #25.''
Even the kitchen is full of pictures: including a Michael Windle.
Their most recent buy, a Steven Campbell, titled Children of the
Mermaid, was acquired from Glasgow's Hardie Gallery just before
Christmas. ''It's so gentle, a lovely quality of paint -- just
wonderful.''
TIP OF THE WEEK
''YOU must decide to buy your picture on merit, not on the name of the
artist or even on the subject. You can also wear art: sport style with a
certain elegance. Art should be fun,'' says Elizabeth Mason.

Lager has a certain reputation, but that's changing with the arrival
of a cask-conditioned version, finds Andrew McKay.
KEN Brooker, the man from Harviestoun Brewery at the foot of the
Ochils, has weaved his magic again. He enjoys a challenge and this time
his art has been well rewarded. Quantities of lager malt, Hersbrucker
lager hops, and lager yeast have been mixed and brewed in the
traditional way. It does not take a rocket scientist to deduce that the
final product will be lager -- of a kind.
But there the similarity ends -- the lager is served ''on the yeast''
at cellar temperature and dispensed through a hand pump without
filtering or the injection of gas.
It isn't a lager resemblant of those produced by the nationals,
ice-cold to touch and taste, and with a head formed from big bubbles.
Neither is it of the lager breed that has been inoculated with a mix of
carbon dioxide and nitrogen gases to produce a creamy head of small
bubbles, but which is still cold in the hand.
What Brooker has created is a ''real'' lager, cask-conditioned and
more like a traditional ale in many respects but with a definite lager
flavour and colour. It has a whisper of a name, Schiehallion, which
evokes elegance and yet has the makings of a battle-cry.
The truth behind such titles invariably reveals a tale; there is no
departure from this with Schiehallion. The brewery was looking for a
name that had a Scottish sound and which stirred the imagination. Many
of its beers go to the South of England, where people are eager to
sample a brew that is far travelled.
The brewery was especially keen to avoid a pseudo-continental name
that had pretensions towards a German town. Schiehallion rolled nicely
off the tongue. It is also the name of a mountain to the west of
Pitlochry often known as the mountain of the fairies, and an oilfield in
the North Atlantic.
Perhaps it is the use of the Hersbrucker hops that has given the beer
its distinct flavour, but it certainly has taste and a bit of a kick
with an ABV of 4.8%. At the moment the brewery is producing 10 barrels a
week.
If you can find it in the west you will be lucky (or in the know). In
Edinburgh, where drinkers are more discerning with beers, the response
to Schiehallion has been good among pub-goers and biased reports confirm
a demand for more supplies. Because of its character it is unlikely to
appeal to the hardy annual of a lager drinker, but it may appeal to
those who on a night have a feeling for something different but with the
lager taste.
In the west the lager's testing ground is the Golf Inn, Bishopton, and
the Boswell Hotel, Langside. Eric Bryce of the Golf Inn has had more
than a silver wedding of years pouring ales to those in search of
something different and he has a tea-chest of pump clips from all over
the country to prove it.
Cellarman visited him recently in his Bishopton pub where economy of
furnishings is adequately compensated for by that vital ingredient,
atmosphere. His enthusiasm for beer overflows as he recalls ales and
their personalities. He talks about foot pumps, beer engines, kegs,
barrels, gases with a passion and will even throw in a house ghost for
good measure.

* Over a glass of Queen Victoria's favourite champagne, Gordon Yuill
-- manager of Glasgow most stylish restaurant, Rogano's -- reveals his
own restrained eating habits on a working day.
HAD a typical restaurateur's breakfast -- a cup of strong black coffee
and two slices of toast about 9am. Arrived at work about 9.30. Lunched
late as usual, about 3.30pm, after the restaurant's busy period. Then
had my favourite dish, lemon sole on the bone with some green leaves
(lollo rosso, endive, some basil) and sauted potatoes -- good clean
healthy eating! No soup, no pudding.
Had a cup of tea in the afternoon -- good old Tetley -- but nothing to
eat with that. Late supper in the office as usual. There are too many
distractions for me to enjoy eating in the restaurant.
Around 11pm up went the cry ''Supper for the boss''. Out as usual came
smoked salmon and scrambled eggs with some toast. A glass of Joseph
Perrier champagne (the house champagne, #5 a glass, and just absolutely
beautiful) got me through until closing time between 1 and 2am.
Gordon Yuill was speaking to Lesley Duncan.

Elizabeth Buie enjoys a gourmet meal that comes calorie-counted
AT first glance, it seems like a contradiction in terms -- a
five-course calorie-counted dinner in a French restaurant. The whole
concept begs the question. Is there any point in going out for dinner if
you are going to check the fat content of each course, scrape off every
vestige of sauce au vin blanc, and wave away the waiter as soon as he
hoves into view with the cream jug? Fortunately, the French restaurant
chain Pierre Victoire has decided that those of us who have been more
gourmand than gourmet in recent months need not place themselves in
self-imposed culinary purdah.
For #14.90 a head, including coffee, they offered a five-course dinner
which was billed as ''Healthy Eating at Pierre's -- a set
calorie-counted menu''.
One glance at the menu and all fears that this would prove a variation
on the lettuce-leaf-and-melon-ball theme melted away. Could all this
total only 1096 calories? But it was all very specific, with not just
calorific values included in the description, but fat, cholesterol, and
fibre readings too.
The starter of mango and orange fruit juice was refreshing, but it was
the soup that really intrigued -- chickpea, olive, and garlic (fat high,
cholesterol and fibre low, 194 calories). The consistency was good --
not too smooth, some unpureed chickpeas to give enough texture, and a
good helping of slivers of black olives. The idea, too, was highly
commendable -- the marriage of the bland pulse with the sharp olives.
Sadly, it did not quite work. The two flavours remained too separate,
the final sharp bite of the olive too much of a surprise.
Next came the fish course -- cod baked with wild mushrooms, tarragon,
and white wine. This, at 221 calories, was only slightly more fattening
than the soup (fat, low; cholesterol, high; fibre, low). There was a
hint of aniseed, but the pervading flavour was tarragon. Served with
strips of oyster mushrooms, the dish was quite fragrant.
The dishes bearing both the fish, and the main course of duck breast
with roasted lentils and kumquat marmalade were piping hot. And then
came the vegetables -- boiled potatoes, broccoli (probably steamed), and
lightly sauted fennel with shallots. Surely this couldn't add up to the
301 calories listed on the menu. The serving of duck (fat, low;
cholesterol, medium; fibre, medium) was generous in the extreme, with
lots of flavour, succulence, enough chewiness, and no skin. As for the
kumquat marmalade -- it was an inspired accompaniment, not too sweet,
and plenty of juice to moisten the other vegetables.
The dessert of fig, sultana, and pecan pie with creme anglaise was a
mere 353 calories (fat, high; cholesterol, low; fibre, medium). The pie
was decorated with a sprig of apple mint and the creme sported elegant
raspberry swirls. It was all very good.
Time, finally, to confess. Our healthy eating plan went awry from the
start. How could we do justice to such an inventive menu without some
wine? The Chateau Graveyres 1993, a Bordeaux Sec, at #7.95 seemed
well-priced. Dry, fruity, with enough bite to match up to a variety of
courses that were long on flavours but quite light, it proved a good
choice. The wine-list of 17 wines, all French, starts from house white
or red at #6.15 but few are more than #10.
We left the table replete, satisfied, but without that bloated feeling
that would normally accompany a five-course dinner. The bill for two
with two set menus at #14.90, a bottle of wine, and a mineral water,
came to #38.75. It had been a well-balanced meal, with plenty of
flavours, well-cooked.
* Other typical themed evenings at Pierre Victoire include
seven-course Gastronomique and Fish Gastronomique menus at #15.90 and
the five-course Vegetable Gastronomique at #12.90.

Catherine Brown and illustrator Fiona Taylor discover the
practicalities behind an innovative dish.
IT WAS a French chef cooking in Arctic Siberia who is reputed to have
created the dish which made sour cream sauce world-famous. Count Paul
Stroganov was his Russian employer. The chef's solution to a constantly
frozen block of beef was to cut off thin pieces of meat and cook them in
the native Russian curdled cream. It was a daring move: too much heat,
too much salt, too much acid, could have turned the curdled cream into a
curdled sauce. Beef Stroganov became a classic.
Prepared in a flash, it had its heyday when waiters in prestigious
dining-rooms flambed to order. It was rich, though, and expensive. When
cooked in the kitchen instead of the dining-room, corners were cut and
cheap cuts of beef substituted for tender steak. The delicate sour cream
sauce was sometimes thickened with flour and diluted with milk.
Hackneyed and debased it became passe.
Yet cuisines worldwide continue to use curdled dairy products in
inventive ways. They provide tangy instant sauces without the hassle of
thickening with flour. In India, and around the Mediterranean, people
are creative with yoghurt, in Central and Eastern Europe with sour
cream, in France with creme fraiche.
The range of available dairy products which have been curdled and
thickened with a bacterial culture, sharpening their flavour by
converting the milk's lactose into lactic acid, has been extended far
beyond our native buttermilk.
While sour cream is made from single cream, with half the butterfat of
double cream, the standard French cream, creme fraiche (fresh cream), is
thicker and more voluptuous. Its butterfat content is higher. Both are
resilient in a hot sauce -- so long as other ingredients are not too
acidic -- since they contain enough butterfat to prevent the sauce
curdling if it is boiled.
Yogurts, however, have a low butterfat content and high acidity, and
are usually added to hot sauces at the end of the cooking time when the
pan has been removed from the heat. The first spoonfuls may curdle but
at least they cool things down and make it less likely that the
remainder will separate.
TURKISH YOGURT SAUCE, described in Nevin Halici's Turkish Cookbook
(1989), is a version of a common Mediterranean type of yogurt sauce
added to stews of meat or vegetables.
Ingredients for 4:
2 tablespoons oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 small aubergines
2 medium courgettes
1 large beefsteak tomato
2 red peppers
1 teaspoon tomato puree
1 teaspoon sugar
half a cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) water
Sauce:
1 lb (500 g) thick or strained natural yogurt
3 cloves garlic, crushed with salt
Method: Heat the oil in a pan and add the onion. Cook until it is soft
and just lightly coloured. Cut the aubergines, courgettes, tomato and
peppers into roughly 1" cubes. Add the vegetables and stir-fry for about
five minutes until they begin to soften. Stir in tomato puree and sugar
then add the water.
Cover and cook for about 5 - 7 minutes. Taste and season.
To make the sauce: crush the garlic with a little salt and mix into
the yoghurt. When the vegetables are cooked add half the sauce gradually
and stir in. Put into serving dish and pour over the remaining sauce.
ARABIC YOGHURT SAUCE involves stabilising the yogurt with an egg.
Serve with vegetable dishes or mixed through beans, chickpeas and green
leafy vegetables.
Ingredients for 4:
1 lb (500 g) thick or strained natural yogurt
1 egg
1 tablespoon oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
3 - 4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 - 2 oz (25 - 50 g) fresh coriander or parsley
Method: Put the yoghurt into a pan and add the beaten egg.
Bring to the boil and stir constantly for about three minutes.
Meantime, heat the oil in a pan and add the onion. Cook until soft
then add the garlic and herbs. Combine the two just before serving.
SHABRIL is a Tibetan meatball curry from Food in Tibetan Life by
Rinjing Dorje (1985).
Ingredients for 4:
1 lb (500 g) minced beef or lamb
1 tablespoon oil
half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds
1 small onion, finely chopped
1" unpeeled fresh ginger, grated
2 cloves crushed garlic
half a teaspoon turmeric
salt to taste
2 teaspoons soy sauce
4 oz (125 g) mushrooms
half a cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) water
1 cup (8 fl oz/250 ml) sour cream (or creme fraiche)
2 tablespoons chopped chives or spring onion
Method: Roll the meat into half inch balls. Heat the oil in a large
frying pan and add the fenugreek seeds. Stir until they turn a dark
brown. Add the onions and stir until lightly browned. Add the meat balls
and fry on all sides. Add the ginger, garlic, turmeric, salt, and soy
sauce. Pour water over and add to the pan. Cook uncovered for about 10
minutes. Add more water if necessary. Taste and season. Remove from the

TWO Scots Guards were sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday after
being found guilty of murdering a teenager shot in Belfast almost
two-and-a-half years ago.
The verdict, which follows a month-long trial last June, will heighten
debate over the Army's rules of engagement in Northern Ireland.
Guardsmen James Fisher, 28, from Ayrshire, and Mark Wright, 21, from
Arbroath, admitted shooting father-of-two Peter McBride, 18, on
September 4, 1992, but denied his murder.
However, at Belfast Crown Court, Lord Justice Kelly found them guilty
of murder and imposed a mandatory life sentence.
He appeared to be unhappy with the required sentence and said he had
delayed his decision in the case until the House of Lords had
determined, in the recent Private Lee Clegg appeal, whether a verdict of
manslaughter was open in circumstances where a soldier had used
unreasonable force in self-defence or in defence of another.
Fisher claimed he opened fire because he believed Mr McBride was
leading his patrol into a trap and would throw a coffee-jar bomb at
them.
Wright said he had opened fire because he believed Mr McBride had
himself fired.
The judge dismissed their claims and said Fisher had been
''untruthful'' in a number of matters and that his evidence had lacked
credibility, while Wright's evidence that he had fired in self-defence
was ''even more frail''.
He said that if Parliament substituted a single crime of culpable
homicide (as Scots law has) for the present counts of manslaughter and
murder and abolished the mandatory life sentence, it could be left to
judges ''to impose more condign punishments, ranging from non-custodial
to imprisonment for indeterminable length''.
The Law Society last night echoed Lord Justice Kelly's call for
changes in the law for murder and said judges should be given discretion
in sentencing for cases of murder.
Lord Justice Kelly contrasted the kind of case in which Clegg was
involved -- opening fire on a speeding car in the darkness of night with
only a split second to decide whether one was under threat -- and
opening fire in this case.
The court had been told that Mr McBride was shot twice in the back as
he ran along Upper Meadow Street in the republican New Lodge area of
north Belfast away from a four-man Army patrol, which included Fisher
and Wright. Mr McBride had been stopped, questioned, and searched by the
patrol leader, when he suddenly took to his heels and ran off down the
road.
The judge rejected the two soldiers' claims that they thought he was
carrying a gun or a bomb, because it would clearly have been found when
he was stopped.
''The image of the case is of a cheeky young man, after an impudent
confrontation, running away as hard as he possibly could.
''That picture did not suggest a young man wandering around with a
bomb in his bag being stopped for a few minutes and then running off
with it, nor a plan to lead a patrol into a trap.''
An Army spokesman said soldiers on the streets of Northern Ireland
worked in difficult and dangerous circumstances but had to operate
within the law at the end of the day.
''If we were not to operate within the bounds of the law, we would be
as bad as the terrorists who we are protecting the public against.''
The spokesman added that the rules of engagement in Northern Ireland
were contained in the Yellow Card document, which gave soldiers guidance
on when they could or could not open fire.
''All soldiers deployed in Northern Ireland know the Yellow Card
backwards, and are tested on its contents, but it is only guidance and
holds no legal standing at all.''
A Tory MP last night called for such cases to be heard by military
courts-martial and not the civil courts. Mr Phil Gallie, MP for Ayr,
said: ''I am speaking out for the bulk of my constituents in the way
that we send our troops out there.
''Many of them are young lads and we are sending them to what is
basically a war zone -- in some ways worse than a war zone because they
do not know who is their friend and who is their foe. All the time they
are living on a knife-edge.
''And under these circumstances, perhaps there are situations where
judgments are not made as precisely as we would like them.
''It is easy to look back in retrospect from the comfort of an
armchair but soldiers have a responsibility to protect not only the
public but themselves.
''Under these circumstances, particularly in the UK with home-based
soldiers, if they have broken military regulations or discipline when
they are serving I think we should use military courts.
''That way you would get a military judgment, by people who know the
situation.''
Mr Gallie said his call for court-martial justice would apply only in
cases where soldiers were on duty and on active service.

The Long Black Veil, The Chieftains (RCA)
* Celebrity cameos have become the norm on Chieftains' albums, with
mixed results -- as is the case here. Van Morrison, Marianne Faithfull,
and Tom Jones will be welcome back any time, and the Chieftains/Stones
finale -- the Rocky Road to Satisfaction, indeed -- exudes fittingly
cheerful bonhomie. But with Mark Knopfler giving it his worst Bob Dylan,
Sting making an Erse of Mo Ghile Mear, and Sinead O'Connor in
couldna-carry-a-tune-in-a-bucket form, diehards may pine, with some
justification, for the unsullied Chieftains of old.
A Whistle on the Wind, Joannie Madden (Green Linnet)
* A garrulous, irrepressible frontperson for Cherish the Ladies,
recent popular New York visitors to Celtic Connections, Joannie remains
mostly straight-faced (though never strait-laced) on this showcase for
her considerable tin-whistle and flute talents. The title track is
almost classical in its discipline and poise. But, as always, with
musicians such as bodhran master Ringo McDonagh in tow, toes will tap
and eyes will twinkle.
Who Do You Think I Am, Sinead Lohan (Dara)
* Introduced on the recent A Woman's Heart 2 album and tour, Sinead
Lohan is a young singer/songwriter from Cork being groomed to follow in
Mary Black's footsteps. Black's musical director Declan Sinnott
produced, arranged and played all the instruments on these 12 original
songs which, if overplaying the poor naive wee me card somewhat, still
have a certain melodic charm.

The Herald's team of reviewers present an informed guide to listening
and reading pleasure.
Fairest Isle, edited by David Fraser (BBC Radio Three publication)
* IT can hardly have escaped the notice of music-lovers that BBC Radio
Three is undertaking, in 1995, a vast celebration of British music
throughout the isles and the ages. As well as focusing on the
tercentenary of the death of Henry Purcell, the 90th birthday of Sir
Michael Tippett, and other anniversaries, the survey will range across
the richness and diversity of British music. This will include
substantial features on the music of the BBC's regional areas -- a broad
picture of contemporary Scottish music was the subject of the first
major regional broadcasts a few weeks back.
Now, at high speed, to complement the Fairest Isle year, the BBC in
association with Hyperion Records has produced a paperback book and
double CD with examples of British music from anonymous
thirteenth-century compositions, through the early great composers --
Dunstable, Byrd, Tallis, and Purcell -- to Britten, Tippett and Tavener.
The book is beautiful. A series of 16 essays, written by composers,
musicologists, historians, and performers, gives a broad and colourful
picture of the development of British musical culture through the
centuries, from the beginnings to today's big names, including Nyman,
MacMillan, and Turnage. Sumptuously illustrated, the book will grace any
music-lover's library.
As will the CDs, each at nearly 80 minutes' playing time, and with a
total of 38 tracks. There are some peculiarities of repertoire
(omissions, notably certain important figures not represented). That is
accounted for by the fact that they record for labels other than
Hyperion. Simple as that. So the discs are not ideally comprehensive in
their survey.
None the less, book and CDs are terrific bargains. Available
separately (the book at #6.99, the double CD at #4.99) or together (#10
for both). Hours of home entertainment guaranteed.
Write to Fairest Isle Book and/or CD offer, JEM House, Little Mead,
Cranleigh, Surrey GU6 8ND, or telephone orders to 0483 2688888.
Scottish Chamber Orchestra Yearbook 1995
* Altogether a more modest publication, at #3 (available at SCO
concerts or from the SCO at 4 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh EH7 5AB). But
still a celebration, as the SCO, dubbed ''Britain's first million-pound
chamber orchestra'' last week by the Scottish Arts Council, is 21 this
year. The yearbook contains a pictorial scrapbook of the orchestra's
activities over the period, an essay by the SCO's first development
officer, Kathryn McDowell (now with the Arts Council of England), who
put in place the development programme that has become a crucial part of
the orchestra's remit, full concert diaries and discography, lists of
tours and commissions. Also contains a long essay on the background and
development of the Maxwell Davies Strathclyde Concerto project, written
by some geek called Tumelty. Deathless stuff.

Overtime, Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass (Concord)
* TWENTY-one-piece brass band who in their better, more subdued
moments sound like they've been influenced by the Gil Evans-Miles Davis
Birth of the Cool school, and at their worst, just sound like a high
school big band. Into the former bracket goes the Boss Brass version of
Ray Noble's The Touch of Your Lips -- although it does come dangerously
close to elevator music. For the most part this is pretty bland, the
only possible exceptions being the near-funky Clark Terry Hawg Jawz and
the Batmanly title track. Only if you have fond memories of Muzak.
The Bridge, Sonny Rollins (RCA Victor Jazz Classics)
* DESERVED reissue of the first album of Rollins's 1962 comeback (he
''retired'' in 1959). It features the tenor saxophonist in the company
of an impressive rhythm section, which includes Jim Hall on guitar. The
musical rapport between Rollins and Hall is evident throughout --
particularly on the sumptuous ballads Where Are You and God Bless the
Child and the more avant-garde title track. Best of all is Without a
Song, with its driving bass line, and groovy melody. Equally groovy is
the fold-out CD sleeve with its reproduction of the original sixties
sleeve and notes.

World of Morrissey, Morrissey (Parlophone)
* Mid-priced 14-track connoisseurs' memento of Mr M's career from 1991
to the present date. Four singles, including the current one, Boxers;
three live tracks from the Beethoven Was Deaf album; four B-sides, and
three choice cuts from his two most recent studio albums. Preoccupied
miserabilism for grown-ups who like to daydream in front of the mirror.
Singles, the Smiths (Warner Brothers)
* Eighteen slices of tart, alienated, pure-pop genius from Mr M's
first band. Again. If you didn't buy them the first time round, on Rough
Trade, or the last time, last year on two Warners' Best Ofs, then you
are entirely without ears, soul, social worth, and hope.
To Be Loved, Berry Gordy (Headline, #17.99)
* As he indicates in his rough-hewn autobiography's sub-title, Berry
Gordy gave us ''the music, the magic, the memories of Motown''. Now,
with little rancour and no syrupy self-delusion, he addresses the many
myths and misconceptions which he feels have obscured his handling of
the label during its phenomenal 36-year life-span. Principally, Gordy
has long been accused of stifling Motown performers' desires for control
of their own artistic destinies. How does Gordy feel he faced up to the
growing demands of such headstrong talents as Marvin Gaye and Stevie
Wonder? ''With relief, pride, resentment and indigestion.'' A warm,
understated, yet acutely revealing book.
King, Belly (4AD)
* Powerful, air-brushed, all-American, made-for-MTV consensus-rock
with an artful eye on indie credibility. A less-melodic Fleetwood Mac
for Generation X. In other words, not anywhere near as good as it
imagines itself to be.
Undone -- The Sweater Song, Weezer (Geffen)
* A single which fails to demonstrate that the hotly-tipped Weezer are
R.E.M's heirs. Nevertheless, you are strongly advised to check out
Weezer's forthcoming self-titled debut LP and their Glasgow gig at King
Tut's on February 24.
Mobile Safari, the Pastels (Domino)
* Shrugging and shuffling their feet in a defensive, off-hand manner,
oor verra ain Pastels slope round the corner with a new album. Yet yon
Pastels need not slope and shrug in a take-us-or-leave-us style, for
this album is easily their best yet, packed with crunchin' guitars,
affectin' vocals, winsome melodies, and songs of singularly fey allure.
In fact, if any Scottish band tops this in 1995, you can come round and
eat my hat.

AND lo, the city of Glasgow hath semi-officially appointed itself a
new ambassadress. And verily, she is a pure godjus big blonde luv-burd.
Or at least that's what she insists she is, while to the rest of us she
shalt also be known as Lynn Ferguson, the no-nonsense swearie-word
chuckle-chucker who, years ago when she was working as a bar-maid in a
trendsome West End drinking-establishment, picked me up once by the ear
and threw me down the stairs at closing-time.
So. Glasgow ambassadress? You? How?
''Not just Glasgow, ya speccy wee article. I see myself as an
ambassadress for the whole of Scotland, actually. Spreading good old
tartan cheeriness wherever I go.''
Aye. OK. But with the blessing of Glasgow's city fathers? What's the
story?
Simple. The producers of BBC's Rhodes Around Britain were looking for
some respectable, clued-up citizen to act as a Glasgow guide for
celebrity chef Gary Rhodes. They approached Glasgow's Department of
Performing Arts, who gave Lynn Ferguson the nod as a fine, upstanding
Glaswegian, having been michtily impressed with her demeanour as MC at
their recent Hogmanay bash in George Square.
Indeed, they were so happy with her that they handed out a civic
imprimatur despite the fact that Lynn currently lives in London and was
born in Cumbernauld . . .
''So? I spent my youth in Glasgow, and I'm back a lot, having just
spent three months in panto at the Tron, and I do Mixmag for BBC
Scotland in the school holidays. And I only left under the iron heel of
enforced economic-migrancy anyway. And I would have liked to have taken
Gary to Cumbernauld, but the programme's called Rhodes Around Glasgow,
so that scuppered that.''
So when in Glasgow, where did you roam with Rhodes?
''We went to the Tunnel. I must admit that I felt like a pensioner
there. The place was full of children wearing hardly any clothes, and I
kept feeling impelled to put woolly vests on them all. Gary and I were
filmed waltzing sedately in the middle of a semi-naked melee of
adolescents desperate to be on the telly.
''After that, we went to eat and drink in Maxaluna. We went to a kilt
shop and I had to hand my purse to a production assistant so that I
couldn't spend all my money on furry Loch Ness monsters that played
Scotland The Brave when you pressed them. And we went to the Armani shop
where Gary bought a suit.
''One place we didn't get to was Spectrum Catering, run by my two
pals, Steven and Mark Ward, who deliver fabulous made-to-measure
sandwiches round Glasgow's offices -- and do you know that one Monday
night in London Madonna came over all swanky and tried to book the whole
of the Greenhouse, the restaurant in which Gary is head chef, and the
Greenhouse turned her away, crying: 'Sorry, we've got diners in already
. . . ' ''
What? We seem to have digressed a little from Spectrum Catering in
Glasgow . . .
''No, we haven't! Madonna should have had Spectrum's number and they
would have delivered her some lovely sandwiches!''
Aye. Right. Ad-break over. Let's get back to the plot. You first came
to public prominence nigh on 10 years ago, just after you'd graduated
from the RSAMD, as one half of the Alexander Sisters along with Carolyn
Bonnyman. Will the Alexanders ever set our eightsomes reeling anew or
give our willows another right good stripping?
''It's a wee bitty unlikely. I think Morag and Alma have actually
given up performing and gone into a seaside home in Largs for retired
Variety turns. Sitting in the conservatory wrapped up in blankets,
admiring the setting sun alongside Graeme Souness and Margaret
Thatcher.''
More to the point, Carolyn has only just finished a long acting stint
in Liz Lochhead's Quelques Fleurs, which wound its way from the
Edinburgh Festival to London's Old Red Lion. Meanwhile, for most of the
past 18 months, Lynn has been the resident compere at another of
London's more interesting venues, the Red Rose Comedy Club.
''After having had three months away in Glasgow in Babes In The Wood,
it's a bit nervy having to get back into the swing of stand-up and
writing fresh material. I've always found writing material a drag, but
at least I've got something to aim at now as I'll be doing my own
full-length fringe show at the Gilded Balloon.
''And who knows what else might develop? Just a couple of weeks ago we
had a scout over from America from the David Letterman Show. He spent
the weekend watching all of us to see who might work on prime-time US
TV. He also seemed to be surrounded by giggling girlies flicking their
hair and offering him -- if he'd only look at their proposal for a TV
series -- a keek up their nighties. Not my style.''
Jings, no. And do you have long-term proposals for a
nightie-shreddingly-powerful career of your own?
''No. Stand-up happened without me planning it. I mosey along. I go to
the shops. I jabber on a stage. I mean, I'm far too snarly and
aggressive in everyday social situations without introducing it into my
working-life. Really, I'm just not prepared to be overtly hungry and
ambitious.''
You had much fun tootling round the four stages in George Square at
Hogmanay, yes?
''I think I had more fun beforehand, messing about with daft Gerard
Kelly. It was hard work, persuading grumpy men to pretend to smile by
showing me their teeth, and being touched up by growling neds with bad
moustaches . . . one of them kept shouting: 'Haw, ur you a burd or a
bloke?'
''I tried to ignore him, but in the end I turned and said, using some
very direct terminology: 'Are you a male private part or a female
private part?' And do you know what he had the cheek to tell me then?
'That's out of order.' Imagine.''
Indeed. Lynn Ferguson shocks the unshockable . . .  not like you at
all. And would you like to close by favouring us with your official
ambassadress's pronouncement on Glasgow?
''Aye. Er. Eh . . . Go to Glasgow: you'll have a laugh. And it's got a
lot posher since I left. Or it's got a lot posher because I left.''
And what difference will being Glasgow's ambassadress make to your
life?
''I hope that they give me the key to all of Glasgow's pubs, as well
as the safe in the City Chambers, so that I can wander round steaming
drunk in lots of new dresses.''
Lynn Ferguson, we luv youse. A burd, a topper; amen.
* Lynn Ferguson will return to Glasgow, trailing clouds of glory when
she performs at the Tron, on Sunday, February 26, supported by Jill
Peacock. Additionally, she will appear in Paisley (Arts Centre), Glasgow
(Royal Concert Hall), Aberdeen (Lemon Tree), Dundee (Repertory Theatre),
and Edinburgh on the Gilded Balloon Comedy circuit on March 1-5. Rhodes
Around Britain is due to appear on TV screens in June.

Caro Fraser has a famous writer as a father, but that was never going
to stop her from making her own way in the literary world, discovers
Lesley Duncan.
CARO Fraser has been compared to John Mortimer and Mary Wesley. No-one
so far seems to have made comparisons -- invidious or favourable -- with
her author father, George MacDonald Fraser. All the same, in Leo Davies,
barrister, sensualist, and Porsche-driver, she may have created an
anti-hero to rival her parent's odiously irresistible Flashman.
With her mop of dark hair and brilliant smile, Caro Fraser looks much
too girlish to be the mother of four young children, let alone a
barrister specialising in marine law, and a successful novelist with
three books already published. Love, lust, and the law are her themes. A
potent combination for escapist reading of the more elevated sort.
There is nothing even residually Scottish about her voice. You could
imagine her being a formidable disputant in the court clashes she evokes
so well in her books. In conversation she displays a bubbling wit, a
tendency to say ''Wow'', and a down-to-earth attitude towards herself
and her achievements. Now only in her early forties, she is, one senses,
still developing, exploring her possibilities. The North British
inheritance is there in the background. She admits to being a
''sentimental Presbyterian'' and has recourse to Oor Wullie annuals
(Christmas presents that are ''a sort of family joke'') when she's
''going through a sticky patch''.
Her roots are Glaswegian. Though born in Carlisle, she lived in
Glasgow from the age of six months to 15, attending the old High School
for Girls in Garnethill -- in those days ''quite a tough and savage
environment''.
Writing is something Caro Fraser has always done but came to late as a
career. She had two children and a husband (Essex man and solicitor)
earning enough for a nannie to be employed before she could embark on
it. ''Everything else had been a sort of apprenticeship,'' she says.
Everything else included, after schooling in the Isle of Man, a course
aimed at producing advertising copy writers. She had thought it would
make the creative process easier but ''after a day writing about frozen
chickens the last thing you want to do is write the great novel''. She
also wanted a career she could still pursue at 50. So the well paid Ms
Fraser went back to being a student.
Law seemed an attractive discipline. A three-year degree course at
King's College, London, was followed by a year at Bar School in Chancery
Lane, then pupillage in the Temple. Those legal years form the central
inspiration for her novels.
The first, The Pupil, has Anthony as its hero. He's clever, handsome,
but without money or the social connections that seem de rigueur for a
career at the bar. The book charts his efforts to establish himself at 5
Caper Court in competition with the dim-witted nephew of the head of
chambers.
The capers at Caper Court are provided not just by Anthony but a cast
of assorted barristers. Anthony's hippie father intrudes amusingly. And
then there is love. Anthony is dazzled by social butterfly Julia. He is
also drawn to fellow-barrister Leo Davies, a silver-haired hedonist of
charm and ambiguous sexuality. The potential relationship between the
two men is described with aching delicacy.
Resolutions are avoided -- ''I like ambivalence,'' says Fraser -- thus
allowing the sequel, Judicial Whispers. This was published in hardback
last month after a second novel of unrelated plot, The Trustees. And
now, with her third book, Caro Fraser has discovered for herself that
old truism that fictional characters develop a life and impetus of their
own.
Enter Leo -- ''this creature I created in the first book'' -- who
ousts Anthony as the main character in Judicial Whispers. He also takes
over Anthony's new girlfriend to divert attention from his sexually
unsalubrious past in his quest to become a QC. He remains alarmingly
endearing in spite of this, his slightly sagging jawline, and his desire
for a good night's sleep at climactic moments.
Caro Fraser has had to make one gesture towards political correctness
at the behest of her woman editor. Leo is made (rather halfheartedly) to
mention having regular HIV tests. ''If I had my way,'' she sighs,
''there would be no condoms, no Aids . . . I like to have the thing in
the realms of romance rather than sexuality.''
Had her writing, I wondered, been helped or inhibited by her having
Flashman's creator as a father? ''Neither really,'' she replies. I
always knew you had to write something decent to get into print and that
it was a hard slog.'' She still thinks of her father as ''the real
writer. He works hard and I just feel I play around . . . It's a
Presbyterian thing. The harder you work, the more worthy it is!''
She does, needless to say, work very hard. The child-free hours of
10am to 3pm are laid aside for creative endeavours in her suburban home
in south-east London. ''That's the way I get my stint done. I can
revisit it around teatime and get depressed about 5 o'clock when they're
all having tea and watching Power Rangers!''
A producer/writer has bought the rights to The Pupil and Judicial
Whispers  to make a short TV series (''whether they ever will or not is
another story''). Caro Fraser recalls him saying of Leo, ''I want to be
this man, so selfish and dashing and intellectually brilliant!'' She
thought: ''It is a bit like Flashman -- only different entirely.''
She turns to me. ''But anti-heroes are good stuff, aren't they?'' Well
yes, on this showing they certainly are.
* Judicial Whispers is published by Orion at #14.99, hardback.
Paperback versions of The Pupil and The Trustees are published by
Phoenix at #5.99 each.

EXCLUSIVE
IN a surprise twist to the fight to save Scotland's threatened rail
services, the editors of Hansard have admitted missing out key words
uttered by Sir Hector Monro before the Scottish Grand Committee.
The Minister, in response to a challenge on whether there would be
formal consultation before the Motorail and Fort William sleeper
services were withdrawn, said: ''Yes, formal''.
Yet when the verbatim Hansard account of the exchange between the
Minister and MP Mr Jim Wallace came out, the response had been omitted.
Its omission was greeted with anger by Opposition MPs who had attended
the committee. Immediately afterwards, they became embroiled in a row
with Scottish Office officials over what the Minister had actually said.
Following the publication of the Hansard report, Labour trade and
industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, contacted the duty editor of
Hansard and asked for tapes of the meeting to be replayed.
As a result, yesterday's Hansard contains a rare ''corrigendum'' which
recognises that the Minister spoke the words ''Yes, formal'' in response
to the question.
However, the Scottish Office said last night that the Minister's reply
had been misunderstood, and that there would be no consultation on these
services.
The question of consultation and its timing is seen as vital to the
battle to protect the Motorail and Fort William sleepers which are
threatened with closure in May.
Yesterday Mr Wilson said that Scottish officials were trying to
backtrack on the promises given by Sir Hector, and deny that these
amounted to a formal consultation. ''It was absolutely vital that Sir
Hector's words should be in the written record of proceedings.''
Sir Hector Monro was unavailable for comment when contacted at home
last night. However, a spokeswoman for the Scottish Office said
consultation on the Motorail and sleeper services was not on the cards.
Mr Wallace could not be contacted for comment last night.

Edith Wharton. THE BUCCANEERS (Fourth Estate, #4.99).
* OF all the unlikely popular comebacks in the history of Eng Lit,
Edith Wharton's is one of the most unlikely as well as the most welcome.
Working from a narrow palette of upper-class Anglo-American life, and in
a stiff and stylised prose often reminiscent of Henry James with
arthritis, she still managed to produce several sharp and shiny little
masterpieces of bourgeois social comedy that have aged remarkably well.
The Buccaneers, unfinished at Wharton's death in 1937 but completed and
edited here by Marion Mainwaring, covers the same sort of social and
personal ground as usual -- English breeding and American money, scandal
and divorce, pride and prejudice -- but in a gentler, less acid style
than many of her earlier novels. See the TV adaptation, then read the
real thing.
Scott Bradfield. WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA (Picador, #5.99).
* ''CALIFORNIA is America squared,'' says the pleasantly senile
epistolatory narrator of this very funny novel. ''It's the place you go
to find more America than you ever thought possible.'' Going quietly
ditsy as she pens her life story for a family she barely knew, Emma
O'Hallohan has already shot her irritating husband Marvin in the back of
the head and intends to do something similar to the clan biography,
revealing who came out of the closet and what skeletons remained within.
The Raymond Carver of the crystal-healing set, Bradfield juggles a
beautifully sustained meditation on age and self-discovery with some
snarling satire on the complacencies of middle America.
Rosa Ainely (ed.) DEATH OF A MOTHER: Daughters' Stories (Pandora,
#7.99).
* READ them and weep, as the poker players say. There is weeping
aplenty in these 30-odd accounts of the deaths of the writers' mothers;
there is also love, despair, hatred, and anger. Some provoke the tears
of a shared grief; others, like New Grey Coat by Leland Bardwell, are
like a bucket of icy water in the face. Jill Posener's memoir, Charmian,
is an elegant elegy for a mother misunderstood by her daughter until
after her death, and Signing On and Signing Off, a poem by Frances
Kenton, has the last line ''Invisible, my mother comes with me out of
the hospital''. The mothers of these women remain with and within them.
Robert James Waller. SLOW WALTZ IN CEDAR BEND (Mandarin, #4.99).
* SAY what you like about the pastel-hued, elegantly greying novels of
Bridges of Madison County author Robert James Waller -- emotional
pornography, wish-fulfilment for the over-40s -- but there's no denying
the man can spin a yarn that ensnares you. In Slow Waltz the main mover
is Michael Tillman, professor of economics, an urban Marlboro man with a
flip putdown forever on his lips and an ache in his heart for Jellie
Braden, the grey-eyed wife of a colleague with a secret past. When the
past comes a-calling, Tillman sets off in pursuit to make his final stab
at eternal love before he gives up and buys shares in Grecian 2000.
Cliched and manipulative, Slow Waltz is still a superior slice of gently
rocking shlock.

Charles Kingsley. THE WATER BABIES (Oxford, #4.99).
* LONG neglected as little more than a sub-aqua Peter Pan, The Water
Babies is revealed in this extensively annotated new edition as one of
the most bizarre products of the Victorian imagination. The ostensible
narrative is known to most people: the adventures of Tom, the child
chimney-sweep, who undertakes his marine meanderings to cleanse himself
of the moral and physical soot of his profession. Beneath the surface,
however, bubbles a subtext oxygenated by the issues of the day,
particularly Kingsley's Christian Socialism, nascent psychology, and a
running critique of child labour. The Water Babies is worth rediscovery
for its accessible lyricism and for the way it baffles, enchants, and
rarely comes up for air.
Simone De Beauvoir (ed.) WITNESS TO MY LIFE: The Letters of Jean-Paul
Sartre to Simone De Beauvoir 1926-1939 (Penguin, #8.99).
* THE turbulent but almost lifelong affair between Sartre and de
Beauvoir is one of the most affecting to read about of any literary
romance since the unconsummated one between Jonathan Swift and Stella:
it's the contrast between the steely stoicism of Sartre's philosophy of
existentialism and the boyish, worried, affectionate, almost puppyish
expression of his love that makes these letters so lovable themselves.
Love apart, they also cast a fascinating light on the development of
existentialism and on French literary and political life of the period,
and one comes away liking M Sartre more for having peeked over his
lover's shoulder.
THE AUTOMATIC MUSE: Surrealist Novels by Robert Desnos, Georges
Limbour, Michel Leiris, and Benjamin Peret (Atlas, #7.99).
* UNLIKE some experimental literature, the Surrealists are not
difficult to read. Apart from the odd weird phrase -- ''Moonless honey,
what have you done with my foot?'' -- the sentences are perfectly
intelligible, but by the end the reader is left wondering what it's all
about. One response is to ask what life is all about; another answer is
''Nothing''; yet another is ''The malevolent shriek of a lemon.''
Despite such problems, there is lyricism, bold imagery, and a great deal
of absurd comedy in these short pieces. With its dreams, wordplay, and
imaginative daring, the collection is more enjoyable than you would at
first expect. You want plots? Try the phone book . . .
Ambrose Bierce. CIVIL WAR STORIES (Dover, 95p).
* AMBROSE BIERCE was both man of action and man of letters. As a
journalist his barbs earned him the nickname ''Bitter Bierce'', but it
is his experiences as a soldier during the American Civil War that
inform the stories collected here. In tales such as What I Saw of
Shiloh, the soldier is too often leading the writer, with endless
military details leaving the reader dazed and confused. Only when
dealing with the human scale of things, as in A Horseman in the Sky,
where a young sentry finds himself the cause of his father's death, does
Bierce show glimmers of recognising the human drama in war. The Devil's
Dictionary would be a better introduction for newcomers.
John Edgar Wideman. PHILADELPHIA FIRE (Picador, #5.99).
* CHAOS, despair, futility -- these are the flames that illuminate
America's decline into what Saul Bellow termed ''the moronic inferno''
-- and nowhere is the heat more intense than black urban America, where
an underclass left to rot threatens to unravel the fabric of the society
that has chosen to abandon it. It's a big theme that has proved
difficult to tackle convincingly, and Wideman's Philadelphia Fire is
another honourable failure. Ostensibly an attempt to chronicle the
reasons behind the razing to the ground of a black commune, Philadelphia
Fire is really an attempt to explain the razing to the ground of the
hopes of an entire generation of African-Americans; but its disjointed
and confusing narrative will leave most readers cold.

Every day police divers dredge the murky depths in search of evidence,
weapons and even bodies. And with each dive, as George Hume discovers,
they put themselves on the line.
FIVE days a week John McConnell kisses his wife and three children
before setting off for his office in Springburn: an eight-to-four
commitment, weekends off, a job like so many others -- apart, that is,
from the dead bodies, blown safes, and dangerously submerged trees. To
make no mention of the threat of death from Weil's disease, often
transmitted to humans by rats, and characterised by jaundice, meningitis
and kidney failure.
For John, on duty, is Sergeant McConnell of the Strathclyde Police
Underwater Search Unit and his working day is spent immersed in a task
few of the rest of us would want, or be able to tackle. Almost needless
to say John McConnell and his 12 colleagues, up to their necks in it for
most of their working lives, are happy divers.
Every day of the year, somewhere in Strathclyde, they dive in support
of their colleagues in the uniformed branch of the CID in everything
from the Gulf Stream waters of the Ayrshire coast to the muddy eddies of
the Clyde, slurry tanks and marshlands not excluded.
''About one-third of all our jobs are outside Greater Glasgow and
there is an operational dive every day,'' says Sergeant McConnell, who
explains that many dives are aimed at eliminating rather than finding.
''We are looking for missing persons or recovering bodies, searching
for stolen property, identifying stolen vehicles that have been dumped
in rivers and ponds, carrying out security searches of water which VIPs
will be passing or staying close by . . . basically looking for things
that are out of place, hunting for murder weapons; all in a day's
work,'' says the policeman who started his working life behind a bank
counter before discovering that the ebb and flow of interest rates could
never be the abiding passion of his life.
When Sergeant McConnell, 12 constables, and the team leader, Inspector
Fred Hall, go about their business they do it mob-handed, with five men
the minimum needed to get one of their number beneath the surface. The
diver going into the water has a diver's attendant to help with his
gear, and a standby safety diver -- fully kitted and ready to go to his
colleague's aid on the instant -- is also served by an attendant, while
the fifth man is in charge as dive supervisor. He will be the only one
on the quayside or riverbank not dressed in thermal underwear and a dry
suit.
Says Sergeant McConnell: ''Five is the legal requirement and we are
very safety-conscious. Having enough people is essential -- we need the
numbers to run safely and effectively.''
So what is it like slipping beneath the surface of the Clyde, watched
by a crowd of curious passers-by that can be formed by the sight of a
man in a frog-suit in the centre of Glasgow, charged with carrying out
an efficient fingertip search of every inch of the riverbed in the area
where it is thought there may be stolen silver, a dagger, a gun, or a
dead body?
''Normally we have no more than six inches of visibility in the Clyde,
so it is all done by touch. We mark off the search area with weighted
rope and work outwards for about 35 yards before pivoting on a new area
and repeating the process. The biggest danger we face is becoming
trapped or entangled in wire or, say, the branches of a tree. There is a
voice line between the diver and the surface and contact is kept up all
the time. The men on the surface can clearly hear the breathing of the
diver and can monitor his breathing rate. If he has a problem he can't
hide it and we are able to go to his help immediately.''
The air bottles worn by the unit's divers contain 300 bars -- one bar
being consumed with every breath at surface level, six times that at 50
metres. The aim is to surface with a safety margin of around one-third
the contents of the bottle still in hand. Sergeant McConnell stresses:
''The most dangerous dives are the most innocuous.''
''My worst experience was getting caught up in submerged branches that
had lodged against one of the piers of the King George V Bridge here in
Glasgow,'' says Sergeant McConnell.
''They had gone into a hole in the pier and I went in too to search.
But when I turned round to come out the branches were against me. In a
situation like that the very last thing you want your colleagues to do
is to pull you out -- we all have a rope attached -- because that could
sometimes just lead to being more firmly trapped. I got out after two
minutes but it was a frightening experience . . . not too funny when
your air supply is being used up and you don't know when you will get to
the surface.''
Every member of the Strathclyde Police Underwater Search Unit is
trained to the level of Grade Three Diver -- able to use bottled air or
a surface supply, competent to dive to a depth of 50 feet, to use a wide
range of equipment, subject to an annual medical, and instructed up to
and beyond the requirements of the Health and Safety Executive. So
skilled are Strathclyde Police's 13 divers -- five of them full-time,
the remainder on call -- that fully half of police divers serving
throughout Britain, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands have
learned their skills at the Strathclyde Police National Dive School, one
of just two such establishments in the country. The other is in
Northumberland.
It takes eight weeks of training to reach basic standard and outside
police forces are happy to pay the #360 a week demanded to learn the
Strathclyde way. The course, based at the Springburn police office, is
rigorous. Says Sergeant McConnell: ''There is no use in anyone taking
the training unless they are keen and fit to dive. Those who do not like
the dark or are claustrophobic are non-starters. The scheme is open only
to experienced serving police officers and some who think they would
like to be divers quickly find it is not for them. There is a huge
difference between ordinary scuba diving and police work. Most divers in
the Strathclyde Police team were keen amateur divers in their own right
before joining but a number were not. In any case it makes no
difference. The training is such that those who have never dived before
are just as easily brought up to standard.''
Every member of the Strathclyde team is a volunteer -- able on their
own say-so alone to quit diving and return to their ordinary duties.
Sergeant McConnell, 34 years of age and 13 years in the police, believes
this freedom is essential if enthusiasm is to be maintained and the best
men found for the job. ''As a result of service in the Underwater Unit
being voluntary standard, motivation and enthusiasm are high.''
The downside of the work is frankly admitted, as is the black humour
employed to provide the release from situations that even the most
experienced find disgusting and distressing.
''Bodies can be in a terrible state -- decomposed, soft, and difficult
to handle. If there is a crowd watching we always try to put the corpse
in a body bag beneath the surface so that it is not seen. They can be
very badly battered by being carried along the bottom of the river --
travelling sometimes for many miles. One body recently was carried by
the current from the centre of Glasgow right out to Prestwick on the
Ayrshire coast,'' said Sergeant McConnell.
''The most tragic aspect of the job is recovering the bodies of
youngsters -- little boys who have been playing by the water's edge and
gone in. Sometimes their relatives are present when we find the body. We
try to be professional but that is very stressful. I have never heard of
any police diver who has a real problem with this but if there were we
would certainly do something about it. As things are, black humour is
our release.''
Asked how many bodies a year are fished from the Clyde, Sergeant
McConnell answers simply: ''Dozens''. Experience has taught him that
bodies that have gone to the bottom of the river, and most apparently
do, are almost certain to rise to the surface 21 days after the victim
is drowned.
Safes tipped into the Clyde by office-breakers, blown open or
abandoned, present a very real problem to the underwater team. ''Very
heavy, smooth on the outside with no projections to get a grip of . . .
awkward,'' says Sergeant McConnell with evident recollection of safes he
would rather not have encountered.
When a Strathclyde Police diver takes the plunge he is dressed in
#1500 of specialist clothing -- breathing apparatus, torch and knife
with a dry suit and thermal underwear to keep out some of the chill. An
enormous range of equipment is on call, including two inflatable boats,
much of it carried in a special articulated lorry used by the team and
fitted with a few home comforts, including a shower.
But the shower is not there just to wash off the mud, stench, and ooze
that may have stuck to a diver's face. Disease is the hidden hazard of
diving in the Clyde -- a river whose banks are host to a very large
population of rats.
''Weil's disease is to be avoided, together with everything else you
can get from diving in polluted water. We wear gloves, of course, when
doing a fingertip search on the riverbed, but inevitably there are cut
fingers, ear infections, and sprained ankles from scrambling over
beaches and rocks. We are all trained first-aiders but when it comes to
the risk of disease it is cleanliness that counts. Everything -- dry
suits, gear, boots, kit like lamps and knives -- is hosed off with clean
fresh water after a dive. We are very meticulous.''
Thanks to a strict routine and that lorry-borne shower so far the
score stands at Police 10, Rats 0. But why, given the risk of disease,
the ever-present danger of being trapped underwater, the frustration of
smooth-skinned safes buried in the river's mud, the stinking, battered
corpses that have to be lifted from river and pond, the tragedy of being
involved with young lives lost, do policemen who could be pounding the
beat choose to do their stint underwater, able to see no further than
six inches before their face?
Variety, it seems, is the answer -- each day is different, even if
most are spent in the water. In the case of Sergeant McConnell, there is
the added advantage that police diving is in no way like banking.
For weekend relaxation he and many of his colleagues go . . . wait for
it, diving. It is not just busmen who take holidays.

A FOUR day old baby girl was abducted last night from a hospital in
Bodelwyddan, near Rhyl, North Wales.
Lydia Owens was taken from Glan Clwyd General Hospital by a woman
carrying a holdall.
The woman, described as between 35 and 40, plump, and wearing a beige
top, had apparently asked the mother to be shown the child.
The kidnapper, who went to the hospital at visiting time, disappeared
with the child.
The mother, Christina Owens, 32, from Llandudno, immediately alerted
staff who called the police.
The hospital is in a rural area surrounded by fields. Early this
morning a search was being carried out in the hospital, its grounds, and
surrounding countryside.

STEEPED in blood, brimming with action, seething with lust, bursting
with beautiful women in low-cut bodices, and teeming with dashing
gallants, Patrice Chereau's La Reine Margot (18) takes one back to the
days when Bette Davis and Errol Flynn used to storm the screen in
costume dramas. She would be indescribably wicked in a farthingale or a
bustle, he would be gloriously debonair in tights or uniform. Maybe the
film is bad history, but it is glorious melodrama.
The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve in 1572 is one of the great and
dreadful events in French history. The country was split between
Catholics and Protestants, civil war had been raging, and to patch a
peace together a marriage was arranged between the Protestant Henry of
Navarre (Daniel Auteuil) and Marguerite de Valois (Isabelle Adjani),
sister of the weak and dissolute Catholic King Charles XI (Jean-Hughes
Anglade). Behind the machinations was his mother, the formidable
Catherine de Medici (Virna Lisi), scheming to ensure the permanence of
the House of Guise.
The wedding celebrated, Henry having renounced his religion, Catherine
decided to get rid of his Protestant supporters, and the massacre of the
Huguenots, who had come to Paris for the wedding, took place.
Chereau's spectacular film -- the lush photography is by Philippe
Rousselot who shot Interview with the Vampire -- is based on a novel by
Alexandre Dumas. It is about a fictional love affair between Margot and
a young Protestant nobleman, La Mole (Vincent Perez), who has come to
Paris for the wedding. The bride spurns her husband on their wedding
night, takes to the streets, and meets La Mole. It is lust and then love
at first sight.
But her future is uncertain. Her mother is plotting to replace the
king with one of his brothers, and her husband's life is in danger. As
well as the doomed romance with La Mole, the film also charts the
growing realisation by Marguerite that her fate is bound up with that of
her husband, and that they stand or fall together. Trust slowly grows as
these two royals, united for reasons of political expediency, realise
they have a common purpose -- survival.
Bad history? For a start the couple were in their late teens, a period
both Adjani and Auteuil have left long since. But they give true star
performances. That is to say he presents a convincing countryman
struggling to survive and at sea in a society he hates, while she does
what female stars worthy of the name do -- looks gorgeous and sexy and
wears her clothes with style. In addition the clothes are a good century
and a half out of date, chosen for their look rather than their period
accuracy. The film's best performance comes from Virna Lisi barnstorming
through a role Bette Davis would have killed for as a black-widow spider
whose machinations eventually go terribly wrong.
The film is richly cast -- Jean-Hughes Anglade's Charles XI is a
marvellous creation and gets to perform a truly amazing screen death
scene -- and while the plots and counterplots, the poisonings and
assassinations, and all those incestuous Guise relationships can be
confusing, La Reine Margot is one of those rare films to sit back and
wallow in. Ask not the reasons why, just enjoy.
This is French week with a vengeance. Luc Besson's Leon (18) is proof
that it is not just Quentin Tarantino who can make dazzling, empty, and
thoroughly entertaining films stuffed with violence. In this tale of a
hired killer he has resurrected a character who appeared briefly in one
of his previous hits, Nikita, about a female assassin, namely Victor the
Cleaner. Tarantino pinched him for the Harvey Keitel role in Pulp
Fiction. This time, called Leon, played as before by Jean Reno, an actor
with a wonderfully lugubrious manner, he is a hired assassin, a
dedicated loner, working in New York.
One day he meets Mathilda (Nathalie Portman), the little girl next
door, notices she has a bruise on her face, and sympathises with her.
Mathilda, a nymphette version of Nikita, is the daughter of a gross drug
dealer, who is murdered by his associates along with the rest of her
family while she is out getting some groceries. When she returns she
realises something is wrong and rings Leon's doorbell. He takes her in
and a strange friendship develops.
Portman, tough, funny, vulnerable, and old for her years, makes a
splendid foil for Reno's oddly beguiling assassin who charts his own
destruction as he helps her get revenge. Gary Oldman, as a pill-popping
killer with an affection for Beethoven and Armani suits, gives a truly
terrible furniture-chewing performance about which the less said the
better.
The new Star Trek film, Generations (PG), unites Captain Kirk, a
patently past-his-sell-by-date William Shatner, with his successor as
captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), in a very
complicated plot which is not really worth the bother of unravelling.
Why is it that nobody ever wears a seat-belt on the Enterprise because
the crew is always being hurtled to the floor or tossed up in the air by
violent jolts from alien weaponry or passing asteroids?
The film opens with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov going on a maiden voyage
by a newly commissioned Enterprise. It gets into trouble with a strange
belt of energy called a Nexus, and Kirk is killed saving the ship -- or
so it seems. He has been sucked into space through a hole in the hull.
On to Picard's Enterprise 78 years later: a mad scientist (Malcolm
McDowell) is putting a world at risk by trying to get into the Nexus, a
kind of Paradise Lost where people live the life they always dreamt of
living, having been plucked from it by Kirk all those years ago. Why
Picard and Kirk, who has, of course, ended up in the Nexus, can leave it
at will, but nobody can get into it without blowing up a harmless
planet, is anybody's guess, but in this sort of tosh it hardly matters.
The new Enterprise crew lack the truly awful bad-actor qualities which
so distinguished Kirk's crew, but Trekkies and fans of Shatner's famous
rugs, which is not the same thing, should be well pleased.
Jason Scott Lee, last seen baring his magnificent chest as an Easter
Island prince, repeats his performance as Mowgli, the lost boy brought
up in the Indian jungle by wolves, in the latest Disney action
adventure, Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (PG). Kipling must be
whirling in his grave at the liberties taken with his tale of the Raj,
but, provided your child cannot read, the film should do well enough as
a holiday treat.
Gary Sinyor's Solitaire for Two (15) deals with the bizarre love
affair between a behavioural psychologist (Mark Frankel) and Katie
(Amanda Pays), a paleontology lecturer at the Natural History Museum.
From the director of Leon the Pig Farmer, it is one of those
battle-of-the-sexes tales in which Rock Hudson and Doris Day used to
cavort, and passes the time agreeably.

THE conversion of an old school might provide an ideal home for
dolphin watchers. Just five minutes' walk from the harbour at Portessie,
near Buckie, and the picturesque old seatown, the former primary school
has been gutted internally to provide four individually designed houses.
It is a handsomely proportioned building with views from the back over
the Moray Firth. The 100-plus strong dolphin colony which makes its home
there is often sighted offshore.
Viewed from the side which looks onto the water, all four houses are
surprisingly different from each other. However, they all share the same
high specification. Features include hardwood doors and stair
bannisters, double glazing, built-in kitchens and appliances and gas
central heating, all as standard.
Each house has three bedrooms and bathroom upstairs, with spacious
lounge, kitchen and utility room downstairs. Each has its own back and
front doors, with communal green and parking spaces at the front and
private patio at the rear.
The selling agents are Antons, East Church Street, Buckie, telephone
01542 832148, and offers over #59,500 are invited.
Dolphin sightings come free.

INTEREST rates up means share prices down. Or maybe interest rates up
means share prices up. It all depends, you see, on whether or not the
interest rate rise is ''a good thing''.
If you can bring yourself to believe that higher interest rates are a
clever and necessary strike against future inflationary dangers, and
that while they slow the economy down a bit they actually make it more
likely that economic growth can continue, you can argue that this time
the increase is the last one in the cycle and you can settle down to
enjoy a spell of peaceful progress. Or maybe not.
What does seem certain at the moment is that the share market is still
going through one of those long phases where it tries to make up its
mind whether it is going up or down.
While we all scratch our heads about this, should we be thinking at
all about commodities? We cannot live without them; the companies we
invest in use them or produce them, and some people seem to make a nice
living by putting money into them.
Speculating in them would be the term most outside observers would
employ because, unless you are an actual user (or even if you are), the
investing is likely to be in some form of future contract. And, of
course, commodities appear prone to sharp fluctuations in prices due to
such unpredictable things as frosts in Brazil (where there is an awful
lot of coffee which does not like frosts), a strike in the Chile copper
mines or, as we saw this week, a switch of funds into some other
speculation such as bonds.
On top of that we have all heard of people making spectacular losses
as well as gains in commodities.
Unless you are pretty expert, commodities are a dangerous game to
play. But, unlikely as it may have seemed a few years ago, there are now
three investment trusts specialising in the area and willing to do all
the clever thinking for you, although only one invests in commodities as
such. The others invest in producers shares.
Broker Smith New Court has been taking a look at them and points out
to investors that, while they may appear similar and are all aiming for
capital growth, they ''have very different strategies and, therefore,
offer different attractions''.
Largest of the three is Mercury World Mining. Launched at the highly
favourable time of December 1993, it attracted more than #400m and for a
while stood at a premium. But after commodity trusts and a lot of
commodity shares fell out of favour this year it is now trading at a
discount. It aims for long-term performance by investing in the shares
of mining and metal companies.
Analyst Charles Cade says it has ''a coherent long-term strategy to
maintain performance even if metal prices are weak, by shifting emphasis
to the large diversified mining stocks.''
Investment decisions are taken on the basis of long-run price
expectations rather than short-term changes in the commodities. It holds
shares in around 100 companies. Because of its size these are largely
the big ones, but it does have a portfolio of smaller ones ''to add
spice''.
Mr Cade feels the Mercury trust ''may be attractive to someone who is
bullish about the near-term prospects for metal prices, though its price
is more closely linked to general equities than metal prices''.
Writing at a time when the share price was 87p (peak 125p), he says
that on current rating it ''may prove cheap''. But he sees the warrant
as dear at 23p. Final date for exercise of the warrant -- at 100p -- is
April 30, 1988.
The philosophy behind Fleming Natural Resources is different. It has
''an extremely short life'' of some two-and-a-half to five years because
it aims to wind up at the peak of the commodity price cycle. Its
intention is to exploit the cycle and invest in shares of base metal,
precious metal and energy companies.
Its focus is on small ''upstream'' companies where the share price is
more closely linked to the underlying commodity than is the case in the
shares of larger diversified companies such as RTZ. There is a
performance-related fee of 10% of capital gains in excess of an annual
growth rate of 10%.
Mr Cade says it is likely to be a higher risk play than the Mercury
trust as, if commodity prices fall, sentiment could turn against it
because rising prices are the key to its investment strategy. Writing
with the share price at 89p (against a peak of 94p), he says: ''It may
be attractive for investors who are bullish about the short-run
prospects for commodity prices.''
The warrant, however, which stood at 12p (17p peak), and has an
exercise price of 125p, looked dear in his opinion.
Different again is the BZW Commodities Trust. This invests directly in
commodities, metals, energy and the soft commodities, through
derivatives which give a direct exposure to price movements. Broadly, it
seeks to invest on a one-year view but shorter term factors do have an
influence.
With the shares at 87.5p and the warrants (final date February 28,
2004 at 100p) standing at 35p, Mr Cade says that with a package discount
of 6.9%, ''The trust looks cheap as a long-run investment on the basis
of risk diversification.'' The warrant in particular seems cheap.
Aside from its exposure to commodities, the trust is also an
investment in dollars as it is quoted in Sterling but virtually all
commodity prices are in dollars.
Between them these three specialist trusts raised approximately #533m.
Such is the lure of commodities.
Looking at the rationale, Mr Cade says that over the long-term
commodity industries have underperformed share prices generally. But he
suggests the sector is ''inefficient'' and the industries ''understake
the potential returns from a well run portfolio''.
He continues: ''The quality of management is likely to be a more
crucial factor than in general equity funds.'' That, of course, is what
investment trusts should be all about.

THERE is nothing quite like variety of tactic and a touch of the
unorthodox for lending spice to Rugby Union action as the Five Nations
internationals demonstrated last Saturday whilst showing contrasting
methods of achieving similar objectives.
Perhaps the most audacious ploy, and one that might be exploited more
as carrying a strong surprise element, was that by the Irish captain,
Michael Bradley.
Instead of calling for a penalty kick at goal, he suddenly punted
diagonally across field. His target was a try for Simon Geoghegan, wide
on the right touchline.
Bradley's placement, however, was a bit short of the bull's eye,
although he did gain a close range scrummage. Only once in recent times
has one seen this move attempted and successfully. Rowen Shepherd, sharp
as a tack, punted across field on to a sixpence for Edinburgh
Academicals against Stirling County at Bridgehaugh in November. The
result was a try for wing Simon Burns.
The Irish introduced surprise again for their two contrasting tries.
For the first, there was a double diversion of a peel round the lineout
tail by Patrick Johns that checked Scotland's tailgunner, Iain Morrison,
then a dummy midfield intrusion by the right wing Jonathan Bell that
affected Scotland's drift so that both Scottish centres were cut out by
the miss pass to the scorer Brendan Mullin.
It is the kind of move the Scots might add to their repertoire. Gregor
Townsend has the kind of acceleratory pace with which to supply a
similar coup-de-grace.
The Irish also called on variety of offence kick ploy for the second
try by Bell. Against England, they had made regular use of their front
row players, notably hooker Keith Wood, as spearhead drivers of quickly
taken tap kicks.
Against Scotland, however, whilst hinting at repeating the pattern,
Wood instead acted merely as a decoy link for a move sweeping wide and
with their full back entering at a rare old lick to give Bell a head
start on Craig Joiner.
Ireland also made unusual use of the dynamic Wood at pressure lineouts
to which Ken Milne threw in. Wood's place in the five metres area was
taken by the scrum half whilst the hooker positioned as a scrum half
adjacent to the 15 metres line. This seemed to aim at using Wood to
check any Scottish assault round the tail or in wide cover.
Scotland's most productive move is that involving a scrummage pick-up
and feed to their scrum half drifting out on a widish, narrow side with
Gavin Hastings intruding at pace. It worked like a charm with Craig
Chalmers an additional link.
The French once at Twickenham used the pick-up to probe the left side
before switching rapidly for wondrous ball transference to the right
that had English temperatures on the rise. None can shift ball quite
like the French.
Scotland might consider using Damian Cronin as a peel player round the
tail.
Cronin, in his present mood of abrasiveness and desire, could make an
impressive spearhead.
One of these days, that loop move by Gregor Townsend will produce the
goods. From the inside centre position, he erupts behind the pivot
feeder, Ian Jardine.
Twice the linkage has been satisfactorily achieved, but the feed from
Townsend has not reached the target.
The captain himself, amid all the deserved satisfaction from a notable
leadership display, and another points-scoring milestone, had mixed
fortunes with two kicks ahead.
The one that led to the Joiner try always was going to cause a flap in
Irish ranks as a model punt on the run.
There are signs notably from Morrison, Cronin, and Ken Milne that the
Scottish forwards are reaching out for more fruitful use of keeping ball
alive just before, or out of contact points.
England provide the role model here, not only with the intuitive
support work at pace and in numbers that facilitate such continuity, but
by mixing that with rumbling mauls involving switches of direction, and
which occasionally force opponents to concede offence kicks because the
only way to halt the rumble is illegally to go in from the side, or to
take it to the deck.
There is more than one way of seeking maximum effect from personnel
and method, and with the Scottish captain still in good nick, Cronin an
elder statesman displaying qualities of inspiration, Rob Wainwright an
all-action dynamo, and the wings looking for work, confidence is on the
mend, and the birds seem to be singing again.

FOOTSTOOLS are enjoying something of a revival; they are versatile and
elegant pieces of furniture.
You can either buy them ready covered, or they can be covered in a
fabric of your own to fit in with an existing colour scheme.
Opt for a small stool, a larger one that can double as a small table,
or one which is hinged to give additional storage space. Whatever your
choice, they are extremely useful in any room.
Clock House Furniture of Overhailes, near Haddington, specialise in
making all kinds of stools including small footstools, dressing table
stools, fireside stools -- in fact, they will make them in any size the
customer wants and with a choice of leg style.
The company is run by Nicholas and Priscilla Parry.
Priscilla said: ''We started from scratch five years ago. My husband
was made redundant from a job in London, and we decided to try something
completely different.
''He had always been interested in making things, and we started by
making small footstools covered with Turkish kilims.
''The idea just took off, and we now have 13 people working for us.
''We specialise in making stools and have built a wide range, from the
smallest footstool to the largest upholstered 'coffee table.'
''The stool is such a simple piece of furniture but it has so many
applications. We are continually developing new designs and finding a
steady demand for our products.''
Clock House's stools are built with solid timber frames and
hand-polished mahogany legs, finished with antique brass studs around
the corner of the legs.
They offer a wide range of fabrics for covering, or they will use the
customer's own material.

A TAXI driving couple who were refused jobs with a mini-cab firm have
been awarded a total of #3000 compensation for racial discrimination by
a Glasgow industrial tribunal.
Mrs Sandra Butt and her Asian husband Nadeem claimed they were turned
down for the jobs with A Cars, of 957 Aikenhead Road, Glasgow, because
Mr Butt was a Pakistani. She claimed she was was told they ''didn't take
darkies''.
The tribunal said it was a ''blatant and insulting incident of
discrimination'' and awarded each of them #1500.
The taxi business denied racial discrimination, claiming the reason
the couple were not taken on was because they already had a radio fitted
in their car and were working for another company at the time.
The tribunal heard that Mr Butt phoned A Cars to see if any radios
were available, giving his first name, and was told there was a waiting
list.
Soon afterwards Mrs Butt, who is white, phoned and was told there were
vacancies.
She saw office manager Mr Richard Clifford and was told she and her
husband could start that night. But when they went out to the car to fit
the new radio, she gave him their documents, including their badges with
photographs, and claimed his attitude changed.
They went back to the office and Mr James McNulty, joint proprietor,
said they ''didn't take darkies''.
In its findings the tribunal accepted Mr McNulty had referred to Mr
Butt as a darkie and did not accept the reason the couple were refused
was that they still had another firm's radio fitted to their car.
Although Mrs Butt is white, she was discriminated against on racial
grounds because of her husband.

OUR chances of living a long and healthy life are increasing all the
time as medical science advances. So too is our desire to give up the
rat race as soon possible and ease into a comfortable retirement.
If we manage to achieve both our retirement life could be almost as
long as our working one, but how much we enjoy that time depends
crucially on the financial arrangements we make beforehand.
The trouble at the moment is that, however carefully we may have
planned for retirement, our financial security after work can be rocked
by circumstances beyond our control.
That is because, when we give up full-time employment, millions of us
are forced into making a decision that sets the financial scene for the
rest of our lives. And it is a decision we cannot change in future
years, however much our personal circumstances or the world around us
changes.
Members of some ''money purchase'' company pension schemes, those
boosting their retirement benefits through additional voluntary
contributions (AVCs), and people with personal pensions are all at risk.
The reason is that the law says the bulk of pension savings
accumulated through these routes must be turned into a flow of income by
buying an annuity, whatever the financial climate at the time you want
to start taking your retirement benefits.
Annuity rates fluctuate in line with long-term yields on gilts. If you
are forced to buy an annuity when rates are low, that is the income you
will be stuck with for evermore. You can't switch to a better one once
yields improve.
Falls of around 25% in annuity rates in recent years have led to
demands for less restrictive arrangements -- demands that may soon be
met by so-called ''flexible annuities''.
''The name is really a mis-nomer because we're not talking about
annuities at all, but a way of withdrawing income from your accumulated
pension savings,'' explains John Moret of Provident Life.
The company, along with another insurer Equitable Life, tried to
introduce a form of flexible annuity last year, but was stopped in its
tracks by the Government which had plans of its own, now being thrashed
out as part of the Finance Bill.
This has to become law by May 5. Once it is, Provident Life, Equitable
Life and other insurers will move quickly to introduce new, more
flexible schemes. By the early summer pension investors should have the
choice of deferring the purchase of a conventional annuity until they
are 75.
In the meantime, they will be able to take an income (and cash lump
sum) from their accumulated pension savings, leaving the rest of the
fund to grow tax free.
The amount of income available initially from pension savings will be
subject to maximum and minimum limits set by the Government. The
pensions industry had feared people would be forced to take at least 70%
of the maximum amount as income.
That would have prevented investors from using the scheme as a
tax-free, roll-up fund, but would have left little in the kitty for
further investment growth.
After discussions with the pensions industry, it looks as though the
Government has relented and that the minimum income will be set at the
lower level of 50%, leaving more of the fund to grow for the future.
''A more flexible system had to come -- it doesn't make sense these
days to lock into a structure that you cannot change,'' says Alan Steel,
a Linlithgow-based independent financial adviser.
''But I have several concerns about the new, more flexible
arrangements. People must realise that they will continue to be exposed
to financial markets -- and in falling markets that's going to be a
problem.
''The level of charges made by insurers and advisers will be crucial.
So too is the quality of ongoing help and advice that will be needed to
make the most of this new flexibility. Advisers cannot just sell a plan
like this and walk away.''
An alternative to the new-style income plans that has been around for
some time is phased retirement. Here you transfer your accumulated
pension fund into a pension plan made up of segments. You can then
convert as many segments as you like to provide immediate income,
leaving the rest invested for the future.
To take advantage of this type of arrangement you normally need to
have built up a pension fund of at least #100,000, many believe that a
similar amount will be needed if the new more flexible income
arrangements are to be cost effective.
Those with less than this in pension savings, or those who don't want
to face future investment uncertainties, will still opt for a
conventional annuity.
And it will be vital to take professional advice on how to proceed.
Choosing the wrong company can knock 25% off the level of income your
pension fund can buy, while paying for costly extras eats into your
income too.
One in eight people die within the first five years of retirement and
their annuity payments die with them. To guarantee payment for five
years, whether you survive or not, you may have to give up 2% of the
income you could have achieved through an annuity. Guaranteeing payments
for 10 years could cost 6% of your income.
You may have to give up nearly 50% of your annuity income if you want
payments to continue to your spouse after your death. Other extras, such
as ensuring that your annuity payments increase by a certain amount each
year, also cost money and need to be assessed very carefully.

RAINDROPS keep falling on your head -- the big problem is you are
inside the house at the time.
Winter storms can rip off a few tiles at any time, and the first you
may know of it is a drip or damp patch.
Often the only thing to do in a major emergency is to call your
insurance company and send out an SOS to the roofing professionals.
But sometimes you may spot the odd slack slate or missing tile, and if
you have a head for heights this is one job you should be able to tackle
easily.
It can take only a few minutes, but will save you a lot of time,
trouble, and money.
For example, replacing a slipped slate is a fairly speedy job.
The slate has probably come out of position because the nails on the
back edge have corroded. Use a slater's ripper to remove the slate,
locate the nails, then pull down to extract or cut them.
You will not be able to get access to the area under the slates to
nail the slate back in place or put a replacement slate in place.
Instead, use a plastic clip or a one-inch wide strip of lead or zinc
cut an inch longer than the slate.
Nail the strip to the roof batten, slide the slate into position, and
turn the strip up to hold the slate in place.
Replacing a tile can be tricky. Often the broken or cracked piece is
still held in place by the retaining nibs on the back edges.
You may find it easier to lift the tiles on either side using wooden
wedges.
Sometimes you may have to cut the tile or slate to make it fit. Small
numbers can be cut using a tough blade fitted in a hacksaw.
To trim a slate, mark a line using a sharp point and chop it a piece
at a time using a tool with an edge -- such as a trowel.

THREE prominent businessmen, including footballers' agent Bill
McMurdo, have set up a company which has produced a unique plan to
invest in Scotland's young players.
The company, appropriately called Young Lions plc, will publish its
prospectus within the next four weeks, but the general idea, if the
public share issue is a success, will be to offer immediate cash, mainly
to clubs outwith the premier division, in return for a percentage of any
future transfer fee the chosen player attracts.
The revolutionary ''Spot-a-Star'' proposition has already been
discussed with some clubs, and all have been excited by the prospect.
McMurdo, who will have the unenviable task of selecting the embryo
stars, is in partnership with two financial consultants -- Neil Beattie
and John Coyne, who run Liongold Securities plc, an Aberdeen-based
financial firm which concentrates mainly on venture capital projects.
Coyne, a former City Editor of The Guardian, and Fifer Beattie, came
up with the idea, but needed someone closely connected with the game and
its players to provide the expertise upon which the venture would
depend. Enter Scotland's most controversial agent, McMurdo.
The response from the Scottish League, whose management committee was
shown the plan, was to say that it could not endorse the proposal, but
there seems no obvious bar to the investment firm's intentions. The SFA
and Scottish Professional Players Association have also been advised of
the proposition which hopes to raise a seven-figure sum in the shares
issue.
Said McMurdo: ''It is something I discussed six years ago with
Falkirk's George Fulston, who was Hamilton chairman at the time, and he
was enthusiastic. He still is. The money we would give to the clubs
would help cash flow, would give them time to let the player or players
develop properly, and would be risk-free.
''If, for instance, the lad we picked failed to make the grade, the
club would have still received cash support and would owe us nothing. If
he turns out to be a #400,000 player, they would still get the large
majority of his transfer fee.'' The percentage for Young Lions would
depend on each negotiation, but McMurdo said that the club would always
have the majority stake in the transfer fee.
Beattie, who is a Dunfermline fan as well as a keen lover of the game
in general, believes the investment would help the Scottish game overall
by encouraging the development of younger players.
''We are asking investors to come in and have a stake in Scottish
football's future,'' went on McMurdo. ''I am sure that the idea of
taking part in this business will appeal to many people in the game. But
I am equally sure it will make money.
''The cash we give clubs will help them at the time they need it, and
they know they do not need to pay it back. My guess is that we would
invest anything up to #50,000 in a really good prospect.''
It is probable that, initially, Young Lions plc will concentrate on
the lower leagues and spread its finances over divisions one, two and
three . . .''I have already got about 20 players in mind,'' said McMurdo
. . . but there is also the possibility that premier clubs below the
highest level could benefit from this kind of investment.
At first glance, the proposals look like a City version of fantasy
football, only for real, but the idea of Player Trusts as opposed to
Unit Trusts might appeal to people who like the notion of charting
prospective stars' careers.
The minimum investment is likely to be somewhere between #100 and
#500, but running costs of the company are already in place. Lawyer
Sandy Moffat, a former Falkirk director, is company secretary for the
new firm.

THERE has been little good news so far this year for holders of
with-profits policies. Insurance companies have been announcing cuts in
bonuses on their with-profits policies with payouts down by as much as
10%. And this year it is not only shorter term policies that are being
cut back, but longer term ones too.
Insurers blame the bonus reductions on poor investment returns in
1994. The All-Share index fell last year, while Government securities,
as measured by the FTA 5-16 years gilts index, went down by 15.3%, but
companies claim they are letting investors down gently.
They also point out that in spite of the cuts in final payouts,
holders of ongoing policies will still see their values increase,
because in most cases it is terminal bonuses paid on maturity which are
being cut not annual ones.
Jim Stretton, chief executive UK operations at Standard Life, points
out: ''Reductions in terminal bonus rates are sometimes thought to
represent reductions in accrued benefits. This is far from the truth.
The accrued benefits under our with-profits policies have increased with
the addition of bonuses at rates significantly higher than most banks or
building societies' deposit rates.''
Even the lower payouts this year should be put in perspective, the
insurers argue. ''Our with-profits policies continue to provide
excellent value for money. The net returns to our policy holders, after
both tax and expenses, are 10.5% per annum over 10 years and 13.2% per
annum over 25 years, compared with average annual inflation over the
same periods of 4.4% and 7.6% respectively,'' he adds.
Mike Wadsworth, insurance expert at actuary R Watson and Son, points
out that over the past two years insurers have been rethinking their
whole approach to their method of calculating with-profits policy
payouts.
''Whereas previously there was often a degree of cross subsidy between
different types of business, insurers are now moving to a position where
payouts reflect more closely the actual return on the underlying
investments.
''In order to preserve the special nature of with-profits policies,
there is still an element of smoothing -- averaging returns over, say, a
three to five year period -- so payouts don't follow the investment
markets precisely up and down as a unit-linked policy would. Generally
this is regarded as a fairer approach for all policy holders.''
Mr Wadsworth believes most companies have now got their annual bonuses
at around the right level and sees future cuts in these rates as
probably unnecessary. But he does foresee continuing cuts in terminal
bonuses in coming years as these bonuses were largely fuelled by capital
appreciation from equities, which depended partly on the high levels of
inflation during the eighties and earlier.
This message has been reinforced by Norwich Union general manager
Richard Harvey. ''Actual investment returns will continue to be lower
throughout the nineties than the eighties,'' he commented when
announcing the company's lower annual and terminal bonuses.
So far only Royal Life has announced a small increase in payouts on
its longer term policies.
Lower terminal bonuses will have a bigger impact for some companies'
policy holders than for others. On average, according to the last Money
Management survey of with-profits endowments, terminal bonuses represent
53% of the pay-out on 25-year policies, but at Commercial Union the
figure was only 29%, while for Co-operative Insurance policy holders
over 65% of their final payout was as a terminal bonus.
So what are the implications for policy holders? Those who have
with-profits pension policies have no reason to worry because the real
returns are still looking good, and the stability which this type of
policy offers when you are approaching retirement is certainly an
advantage.
For those policy holders who expected their policies to produce
specific capital sums, there may be some disappointment. Standard Life
and Norwich Union have already warned their customers with back-to-back
policies maturing this year that they face shortfalls on their original
investment.
Most mortgage endowments are still likely to meet their targets. When
they were set up premiums were calculated on the basis that providing
annual bonuses did not fall below 80% of their starting level, there
would be sufficient to repay the loan. Policies which could fail to come
up to scratch are those sold at the end of the eighties when bonus rates
were at their peak. Since then premiums on new policies have increased.
If you are concerned about your policy, contact your insurance company
and ask whether you are still on target to repay your mortgage. However,
many companies have now introduced review schemes and are likely to
contact you first if there is a danger of a shortfall.

THE Scottish Rugby Union is likely to announce plans early next week
for a major crackdown on the ''pirate'' hospitality market surrounding
Murrayfield internationals.
The Union is also understood to be looking seriously at steps that
could be taken to undermine the black market in individual tickets sold
on at a profit by rugby club members and debenture holders.
As revealed in The Herald, Carnegie Sports International, the Scottish
Rugby Union's Murrayfield debenture advisers, carried out an undercover
operation to identify ''pirate'' hospitality operators during the game
against Ireland last weekend.
Carnegie marketing director Malcolm Brown said that the operation had
been ''extremely successful,'' and that their report, which names the
hospitality operators and the companies which entertained clients at
''pirate'' operations was handed to the SRU for discussion at its main
committee meeting yesterday.
He was unable to divulge what steps the SRU was now likely to take,
but The Herald understands that one option being seriously considered is
to invoke the embarrassment factor by making public the identities of
firms and organisations which have been purchasing hospitality packages
on the black market.
The Union, which runs the only official hospitality operation at
Murrayfield, is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds as a result of
blackmarket hospitality operations. It has always said that it retains
the right to evict from the stadium any individual who gains access
through a black market ticket.
A precedent has already been set for invoking the embarrassment
factor. At major events such as the Bell's Scottish Open golf tournament
at Gleneagles, and the Wimbledon tennis championships, official
hospitality operators have picketed unofficial operations, handing out
letters to guests explaining that they were attended ''pirate''
functions.
Carnegie have also taken possession of a number of black market
tickets apparently sold on at a profit by individual supporters. Under
Murrayfield's computerised system each ticket can be traced to its rugby
club, school, or debenture holder source.
In the past, individuals who sold tickets have received warning
letters from the SRU, and the sanction still remains that the culprits'
clubs could have their allocation withdrawn.
Malcolm Brown said yesterday that it was the intention to ''up the
stakes again'' for Scotland's next home Five Nations' game, against
Wales on March 4.
The SRU's determination to stamp out the unofficial hospitality market
has angered operators such as the Gloucester-based Mike Burton Group.
Burton, a former England and British Lions prop forward, has said that
the Union is acting in contravention of European freedom of trade
legislation. He has warned the SRU that if it interferes with his
customers, then he will take immediate court action.

Children's furniture can be an investment, as MARY BENNIE discovered
CHOOSING children's furniture is fun: there are many different makes
and styles available, and whatever your budget you should be able to
find something attractive and practical.
Furniture that grows with the child, or doubles up as toy storage, is
obviously a wise investment, and there are several options.
For the top of the range, Linda Reid Plus of Giffnock is the place to
go for beautiful plain or hand-painted furniture in oak and pine by John
Minter of Kent.
Look for the pretty single fourposter bed (#1076) and davenport desk,
#590 (main picture Page One).
For children who would prefer a plainer look, there is a captain's
bed, wardrobe, toy chest, bedside cupboard and chest of drawers, made
from limed oak.
The Cranbrook Collection in solid pine comes in different finishes,
including natural, burgundy, navy blue or racing green, and includes a
captain's bed or single bed, wardrobe, small and large chests of drawers
and toy chest.
Another option from John Minter is a sleigh bed that conceals a second
bed behind the side panel -- handy for when friends stay overnight.
The price is #1200, which might sound expensive, but it includes the
guest bed and two mattresses.
For a small additional charge, all John Minter's furniture can be
given any finish the customer wants.
You can also find furniture by Simon Horn at Linda Reid Plus,
including a cot based on the traditional Lit Bateau design, which
transforms into a child's bed and also into a small sofa. The price for
this three-in-one piece of furniture is #1295.
Artefacts of Cheshire was founded by Gail Elgin, who, when her own
children were small, saw a gap in the market for attractive,
well-designed furniture that would appeal to children and adults.
Gail, who had studied fine art, began to make tables and chairs,
chests and shelves that were fun and safe.
''The designs are deliberately bold and contemporary, and will fit in
anywhere,'' she says.
''The wall-hanging bookcase could store toys in the bathroom, or
children's books in the hall.
The toybox, colourwashed and decorated in subtle designs, could be
used to store toys in the sitting room where it could double as a coffee
table for adults.''
Gail was soon being given commissions by her friends, and decided to
start her own small business. Artefacts furniture is available by mail
order.
Another company that supplies children's furniture by mail order is
Letterbox of Cornwall.
They stock traditional pine chairs and stools, and a pine rocking
chair, decorated with either a cherry or boat design.
John Lewis's selection of children's furniture includes rocking chairs
with palm seats and beech frames, suitable for children from six months
to five years (#19.75) wicker armchairs (#17.75) and a cane settee which
can be used to store toys (#39.00).
Their red plastic table and small matching chairs cost #14 and #7.95
each.
John Lewis also stock a cot and first bed by Silver Cross. Handmade in
solid pine, the cot base has three different heights, and the ends can
be taken off to form a sturdy bed suitable for a child of up to six.

SWEDEN captain Jonas Thern is said to be keen to move from AC Roma to
Rangers.. ''I've heard a lot of good things about the club and it would
suit me fine to finish my professional career in Scotland,'' he is
quoted as saying by a Swedish news agency.
Thern, who is frustrated at not making the starting line-up at Roma,
continued: ''The situation in Rome is untenable. I want to play, but if
I'm not going to be selected I might as well change clubs.''
Thern's agent, Vincenzo Morabito, said he would travel to Glasgow next
week for talks.
''Jonas doesn't want to wait until the summer but wants a new club as
soon as possible,'' Morabito said, adding that Roma had put a price tag
of #2.5m on the midfielder.
Meanwhile, it is not beyond Aberdeen to complete a traumatic week by
beating Rangers in Roy Aitken's maiden game as manager at Pittodrie
tomorrow afternoon. Indeed, Sod's Law might well insist on it.
Even the Ibrox manager, Walter Smith, alluded to the vagaries of these
situations when he said, ruefully, that teams often play well the week
after a manager has been sacked.
However, whatever the result, the demanding northern fans will be
anxious to see a determination and willingness from the players which,
at least, will indicate that they are capable of lifting the side from
the depths of the premier division in Aitken's trial period between now
and the end of the season.
Rangers will insist that the game, one of 12 live TV games scheduled
over the next four months by Scottish Television, means a lot to them,
but there is no question that its importance to Aberdeen is greater.
Aitken could have had no better morale boost than the decision by
Duncan Shearer to sign a new contract which will keep him at Pittodrie
for another two-and-a-half years. But Aitken has been delighted by the
way the players have responded since he has been left in charge
following Willie Miller's sacking.
''I have tried to get everyone on the same wavelength,'' he said.
''This is an important game, but it is just one game. Regardless of the
outcome, and we will be doing everything possible to win it, there still
will be a lot to play for.''
Eoin Jess, Ray McKinnon, and Peter Hetherston are all fit, but an
unnamed player is doubtful.
Rangers have no such worries. Smith yesterday named the same squad as
has been in action in the past couple of games, but the chances are that
Alex Cleland will be on the bench, at least. ''Our aim is to keep
winning and prevent any doubts creeping in,'' said Smith.
Smith is happy that the injured players of earlier in the season are
coming back, with the notable exception of Ally McCoist, and the showing
of Trevor Steven in midweek was especially encouraging. The midfield man
has a way to go yet, but signs of the old skills were there to see.
Tomorrow's clash is the first of a dozen live matches announced by
Scottish Television yesterday. The list includes the Coca-Cola Cup final
in England, one of the semi-finals, two Champions' League
quarter-finals, the Champions' League semi-finals, and the Champions'
Cup final.

THE decision to rest Scotland captain Gavin Hastings for Watsonians'
crucial McEwan's 70/- national league encounter with Heriot's FP was
taken on medical advice, according to the Myreside club's co-coach,
Andrew Ker.
Watsonians are stung by any suggestion that the decision to leave
Hastings out of the side to meet Heriot's today indicates that they have
given up on the title chase.
Stirling County remain favourities to win the championship race, but
Boroughmuir, Watsonians and Heriot's still have an important role to
play in deciding whether the trophy will reside next season at
Bridgehaugh. Boroughmuir and Watsonians, in particular, still have an
arithmetical chance to wrest the cup from Stirling's grasp.
Stirling have a postponed game in hand over the Meggetland and
Myreside clubs, but the chasing duo are only a tantalising couple of
points behind the league leaders.
Yesterday Ker, who coaches Watsonians along with Peter Gallagher,
declared: ''Gavin has a bad back, so with Paris beckoning, had he played
on Saturday and taken another knock he might not have been able to play
for Scotland in France.
''He trained last night and he was fine, but Lorraine Shepherd, his
physiotherapist, told him that it would be wiser if he did not play for
us on Saturday.''
Ker stressed that the decision had caused no problems with the club.
''Gavin Hastings gives his all for Watsonians. But if, on medical
advice, he is told not to play, then he would be foolish not to heed
that advice.
''But that certainly doesn't mean that we have given up on our
challenge for the championship.''
Watsonians succumbed to Boroughmuir at Myreside a fortnight ago and
the coaches have dropped three members of the pack, including the
promising Murray Rudkin.
Ker said: ''Some of the guys thought they were in the side for life
and we decided to give them a kick up the backside. Murray Rudkin, who
has great potential, comes into that category. He hasn't been realising
that potential and a wee spell in the seconds will do him the world of
good.''
League leaders Stirling County are at Inverleith against bottom-placed
Stewart's Melville. In preparation for the game, Stirling took 71 points
off Grangemouth in a friendly on Tuesday night.
Coach Brian Edwards said yesterday that Scotland winger Ken Logan, who
is suffering from an ankle injury, is doubtful and a final decision on
whether he would play would be taken in the morning.
''There are no easy games for us now and never mind that Stew-Mel are
at the bottom of the table. Every match is critical,'' he said.
Across Edinburgh at Meggetland, Boroughmuir -- named this week as
McEwan's club of the month -- seek to keep their championship challenge
in good heart with a win over Edinburgh Academicals. But the game is
significant for the Accies, too, as they endeavour to add to their 10
points in search of the magical figure of 14 which, it is reckoned, will
be the cut-off point for the sides which will go into next season's new
eight-team premier division.
West of Scotland, too, have a crucial game today, when Melrose are the
visitors at Burnbrae. Melrose give Doddie Weir a run at blindside
wing-forward, perhaps indicating a fresh challenge at higher levels.
But West, stuck in tenth spot with four games yet to play, have a bit
to do if they are to secure their place among next season's elite.
GHK entertain Hawick at Old Anniesland, where both sides start from
mid-table positions to secure top-eight status next season, without the
injured Shade Munro. The Glasgow side, in sixth slot, has the better
launch pad, Hawick, with Derek Turnbull in the unaccustomed role of
lock, hanging on to that crucial eighth place. Both clubs have a
postponed game in hand.
In the second division, where Kelso seek to confirm their championship
status against third-placed Preston Lodge, straw has been laid on the
Poynder Park pitch in an effort to keep the frost at bay.
* THE Scottish Rugby Union ask all clubs, that in the event of their
match being called off today, to phone Murrayfield (031 346 5000)
between 9am-1pm.

Iran's deputy foreign minister Mahmoud Vaezi is insisting that
Tehran's ''death sentence'' on British author Salman Rushdie remains in
force and that he must be killed.
The remarks drew a harsh reaction from Denmark today, which said he
was reneging on statements he made in Copenhagen this week.
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said he would call on
other Nordic countries to increase pressure on Iran, which is already in
the middle of a diplomatic row with Norway and Sweden.
The Iranian news agency Irna quoted Vaezi as saying in Paris on
Wednesday that the death edict against Rushdie ''would not change by any
means''.
Vaezi was speaking during a stopover on his return to Iran from a
visit to Denmark.--AP.

BRIAN Lara blasted 147 to lead West Indies to a massive 356 for three
against New Zealand by the close of the first day of the second Test in
Wellington.
He added 221 in partnership with Jimmy Adams, who hit an unbeaten 87,
after the tourists were given a grand start by Sherwin Campbell's
aggressive 88.
Lara, who had a relatively poor tour to India and failed in the drawn
first Test in Christchurch, responded by putting the Kiwi attack to the
sword. He delighted the crowd with his full array of shots, particularly
cuts and pulls off the back foot.
His fourth Test century included fifteen 4s, and once he reached the
milestone, off just 134 balls, he increased the tempo, often hitting two
or three boundaries an over.
He seemed poised to post another mammoth total, but late in the day
was hit on the helmet by a Danny Morrison bouncer and was then out lbw
in Morrison's next over. He hit 24 boundaries and one 6 in his 181-ball
innings.

HELPING protect Europe has left Chris Robison ill-prepared to defend
his Scottish cross-country title tomorrow on the North Inch at Perth. A
Nato exercise may not have torpedoed Lieutenant Commander Robison's
hopes, but he has spent much of the past week buried in a command bunker
somewhere in Fife. He has been on duty overnight during the week, and is
working today and tomorow, until shortly before 2155 athletes contest
the nine-race programme.
Robison knew he was sailing into the wind last weekend, when a
hamstring problem forced him out of the Royal Navy championships, an
event he had won in all of the past 14 years. But treatment has helped.
The first six men and five women in tomorrow's event, which is backed
by Perth and Kinross council, automatically qualify for the World
championship trials at Morpeth on March 5.
Since placing eighth in the inter-county championships last month,
Robison's fitness has improved. The event is shaping as a classic, but I
believe that the man who beats Tom Murray will be the ninety-eighth
Scottish men's champion. Dave Cavers (Teviotdale), Graeme Wight
(Shettleston), Robert Quinn (Kilbarchan), Tom Hanlon (Racing Club), and
Alaister Russell (Law) are the main challengers.
Murray is still hungry for a fourth Scottish crown. ''Having raced
only thrice over the country this winter, most recently placing third in
an international event in Holland, I'm fresh, rather than jaded, as I've
been in the past,'' said Murray.
The flat trail by the Tay, mainly over a golf course, may favour
Leslie Deans Racing Club, who hope to halt Cambuslang's seven-year
monopoly.
They appear to have too much strength in depth for Cambuslang, but
then it looked that way last year too. Cambuslang have shown they mean
business by opting out of the European Clubs' championship, and will
spring a surprise, by fielding Keith Anderson, who won the British
Universities title last weekend. Individual female competition is less
intense. Commonwealth team captain Vikki McPherson, a former double
winner, should be too strong for defending champion Sue Ridley and
Marlene Gemmell, but it will be interesting to see how UK triathlete
Fiona Lothian performs.
Shettleston Ladies will have to pack well to defend the team honours.
For in addition to McPherson, City of Glasgow have former champion Lynn
McIntyre, and Audrey Sim.

PEPs -- or Personal Equity Plans to give them their full title -- have
been made progressively more attractive since they were launched in
1987. They now offer one of the most flexible and tax-efficient forms of
investment available to UK taxpayers.
But what exactly is a PEP and what are its benefits? Below is a simple
Q &amp; A courtesy of a Bank of Scotland booklet on the subject.
What is a PEP?
It is a tax-free savings scheme and two types are available: the
''general'' PEP with its annual allowance of #6000, and the ''single
company'' PEP with annual allowance of #3000. You can only subscribe to
one of each type within a tax year. PEPs enable UK resident individuals
to invest up to #9000 per year in the stockmarket without tax
liabilities or complications.
What is the difference between general and single company PEPs?
Although the basic attraction is the same: tax-free investment on
stocks and shares; the two types require to be kept quite seperate. They
cannot be merged or transferred from one type to another and separate
application forms require to be completed for each type. The general PEP
is more flexible in that you can invest in equities and both investment
and unit trusts, and each year's PEP investment can be rolled up into
one PEP. Meanwhile, the single company PEP restricts your investment to
only one equity during any one tax year. You can invest in a different
one in subsequent years, but these cannot be rolled up into one PEP. A
unique feature of the single company is that it enables participants in
most profit-sharing and SAYE option schemes to transfer shares directly
into a PEP.
What are the benefits?
No income tax payable on dividends (ie increased income);
No capital gains tax liability on profits (ie avoding potential tax
liabilities);
No reporting to the Inland Revenue (ie tax returns simplified);
No minimum period of investment (ie flexible);
Invest in shares at greatly reduced dealing costs (ie good value);
A choice of full-time professional management of your own shares (ie
take a PEP or make a PEP).
Who can apply for a PEP
Any individual aged 18 or over provided he or she is resident in the
UK for tax purposes. Each adult member of a family can have an
individual PEP.
What happens to any income
Income distribution is automatic on Income PEPs, optional on
Self-Select PEPs, but not available on Growth PEPs.
How am I kept informed once I go for a PEP?
Once your application is accepted we will write to you confirming that
the PEP has been opened. For a new investor to a bank managed plan, the
PEO cannot be opened until seven days have elapsed. This is commonly
referred to as the ''cool-off'' period and is a statutory requirement
which cannot be waived by either investor or plan manager. The PEP
investor is then furnished regularly with detailed statements,
indicating all transactions, dividends and interest received plus
valuation of the plan.
How do I invest in a PEP?
Step 1: Decide upon the type you want;
Step 2: Decide upon how much you wish to invest this tax year. If it
is #6000 or less, you will probably want a General PEP (either managed
or self-select), whereas if it is more than #6000, you will probably
want to open a single company PEP also. It is important to remember you
can only subscribe to one General PEP and one single company PEP during
any one tax year.
Step 3: Decide how you want to fund your investment. The simplest
method is by cheque or (in the case of income and growth general PEPs)
by monthly direct debit;
Step 4: Remember to include your cheque with your completed PEP
application form and for monthly subscriptions, direct debit
instruction.
What about withdrawals?
A part withdrawal from a PEP can be requested or its full closure at
any time and without normally incurring tax penalties.
Can I switch between income and growth PEP?
Yes. An investor's priorities change over the years. On retirement,
for example, there is often a desire to maximise income rather than
savings. Simply tell your adviser or broker.
What happens if I die?
In the event of death, the plan ceases and the shares and cash form
part of a person's estate, to be dealt with by the executor in the
normal course. Value of shares at the date of death becomes the
acquisition cost for computation of any future Capital Gains Tax
liability which the beneficiary may incur.

COLIN Jackson relaxed nonchalantly by a piano last night, not the
least off key at the end of his unbeaten run over the hurdles. But
Scottish high jumper Geoff Parsons struck a discordant note, leaving the
hotel after having been dismissed from the team.
''If I had lost outdoors, I would feel very different,'' shrugged
Jackson, dismissing his 60 metres hurdles run on Thursday in Madrid,
where the camera put him behind American Allen Johnson, though both were
timed at 7.42sec.
It was the Welshman's first defeat since August 27, 1993, but he was
unperturbed. ''I've lost perhaps three races in 100 -- that's
consistent. These things happen indoors. If you are not absolutely 100%,
you can expect to be beaten. There is no time to recover from any
mistake. And I can't be hurdling that badly -- it was still the fastest
time of the year.
''I have to be honest. I have found it very hard to get motivated this
winter, simply because I am not doing any indoor championships.
Everything is geared to outdoors and the World title in Gothenburg.''
0 ''The dog bit the man,'' said his coach, Malcolm Arnold, the UK
director of coaching. ''If Colin had won again, it would have been no
story. But it won't change his plans. He still won't do the world
indoors.''
The World, European, and Commonwealth champion certainly cannot afford
to be demotivated today. In Glasgow's Kelvin Hall, he faces the far from
improbable prospect of defeat by a Briton, in the Interflora
international against France. He is paired with Tony Jarrett, the man
who labours under the title of the world's second best hurdler, and who
previously was viewed as the athlete most likely to end Jackson's reign.
Jackson equalled the world record in this meeting last year, and he
admits the track is fast. Jarrett may push him all the way.
A surprise figure at the team headquarters yesterday was triple
Commonwealth high jump medallist Parsons. Only 24 hours earlier, he had
been replaced in the team by teenager James Brierly, and yesterday, on
arrival, he was put firmly in his place by Arnold.
Parsons declined to respond last weekend to his invitation to join the
British team, extended after he had won the AAA title for a record fifth
time. ''We waited all week for Parsons to reply,'' said Arnold, ''then
he just showed up here. But having heard nothing, I was not being hung
out to dry, and left with just one high jumper, so I called up Brierly.
''Geoff and I have had a talk. I think he understands the position.''
Linford Christie is unlikely to be at his sharpest, having flown
Sydney-Tokyo-Sydney London-Glasgow in a week. But he should be more than
sharp enough for a modest French team. Unfortunately the visitors do not
include world 200m record holder, Bruno Marie-Rose, for John Regis to
stalk. Regis broke the UK record last weekend, and yesterday vowed to go
for the world mark in Barcelona next month.
* AMERICAN officials, concerned about the sport's image, have pulled
the plug on athletes placing legal bets on a indoor meet in Reno,
Nevada.
''Gambling and athletes do not mix,'' said USA Track and Field
spokesman Pete Cava as athletes were warned that all bets were off -- at
least for them. The ban did not affect spectators.
* CHINA'S Sun Caiyun raised her world indoor pole vault record by one
centimetre to 4.12m at a meeting in Berlin.

NEW horizons have opened up for retired people with life savings
locked up in either bank or building society who are expected to take
full advantage of Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's easing of
eligibility for corporate bonds and convertible shares, coming for the
first time within the spectrum of Personal Equity Plans.
Whether they be managed or self-select, PEPs as they are better known
in the marketplace, seems to be popping up everywhere. As fund manager
Stewart Ivory succinctly puts it: these days you can hardly move without
tripping over a PEP. People seem to be talking about them all the time
and everyone's got one to sell.
At the outset however it is best to issue a warning: remember that a
PEP represents a risk investment. Share prices can go down as well as up
and the value of your PEP can fall below your original investment, with
income dervived from share investments liable to fall as well as rise.
With that said, there is little doubt about the popularity of PEPs
which have been on the market for several years. Majoring on tax break
advantages they are regarded as representing a medium to long term --
say five to 10 years or longer -- investment.
Now with the Chancellor extending the scope of PEPs in his recent
Budget, the tax-free savings scheme introduced by the Government to
encourage wider share ownership by the general public enters a new era.
The many retired people who make up an important and ever-growing
section of British society are likely to be targeted by advisors and
brokers alike, as the annual battle between PEPs providers hots up on
two fronts.
First, there are the new bond-based PEPs sanctioned by Mr Clarke,
while more conventional companies who believe income is best generated
by investing in the long term in the Stock Market, continue to
concentrate on share-based plans.
New PEPs-orientated products just launched on the Market are designed
to secure investors' savings in the coming tax year, and collectively
represent a lightening of the recent gloomy feel in equity markets. Up
until now all but a handful have produced returns well ahead of the
rates offered by building societies, for example. This is all set to
change.
A retired person taking the first steps into the PEPs world should
seek independent financial advice but bear in mind to ask about discount
benefits when talking to either adviser or broker. Remember, there is a
lot of competition out there to handle your hard-earned cash.
For example, some discount brokers have started refunding all or part
of their commission to investors who need no advice, cutting the initial
charges by an average 3% on almost every unit-trust PEP. Others,
meanwhile, have negotiated extra discounts from the providers.
If you are contemplating a PEP investment you should perhaps look at
The Saints PEP from Stewart Ivory, or a new route for your savings
available this month when Royal Bank of Scotland Unit Trust Management
launches a new savings plan, with PEPs described as the most
tax-efficient method to invest and their plan designed of course for the
longer term investor.
For initial advice, Bank of Scotland makes available, free of charge,
a personal equity plans booklet, and packed with facts about both
managed and self-select schemes; while Chase de Vere Investment can
supply its PEPGUIDE, comparing no less than 1000 schemes to help you
make the correct choice. (#12.95, calling freephone 0800 526092.)
It is perhaps wise for new investors to ask about reducing exposure of
their savings to any sudden fall in equity prices. This can be offset
for example by investing through a monthly payment scheme rather than
making a lump sum investment.
The first three months of any year are always a busy period for the
PEP industry with thousands of individuals rushing to invest their #6000
annual allowance before the end-of-April tax year.
However, it is wise to remember that on retirement you enter that
positive time of life when you can afford to take your time to choose
the right PEP that suits your needs. Now with what independent financial
advisers the Aitchison and Colegrave Group describe as a new breed of
lower-risk high income PEPs on the market, thanks to Kenneth Clarke,
their strengths in predictability and security are likely to appeal more
to older investors.
After all, in the seven-year lifetime of the PEP, it is the over-50s
who have tended to be the most enthusiastic personal equity plan
investors.

THE Agassi Express just keeps rolling along on the ATP Tour.
Top seed Andre Agassi, winner of the last two Grand Slam tennis
tournaments and 31 of his last 33 matches, pounded out a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2
victory over unseeded German Marc Goellner to reach the quarter-finals
of the San Jose Open in California.
Agassi, the world's second ranked player, countered Goellner's barrage
of 12 aces with a relentless groundstroking game and punishing service
returns.
Third seed Jim Courier had an easier time as he swept past Nicolas
Pereira of Venezuela
6-4, 6-1 in 62 minutes to join Agassi in the quarter-finals, and now
meets fellow American Jim Grabb, a 7-5, 6-7, 6-3 surprise winner over
sixth seed Patrick McEnroe.
Top seed Boris Becker fought back from losing a marathon 24-point,
second set tie-break -- in which he squandered six match points -- to
beat fellow German Joern Renzenbrink 7-6 (7-1), 6-7
(11-13), 6-2 in the Marseille men's indoor tournament yesterday.

NOW that the dust has settled, Paul Sturrock has calmed sufficiently
to put that midweek Scottish Cup thrashing by Stenhousemuir into the
background. You don't forget about things like that.
At least a couple of players will not be allowed to erase it quickly
from memory as the Perth side resume what seems to be the mammoth task
of trying to stay in touch with the first division leaders.
Hamilton Accies are the visitors to McDiarmid Park. But they will not
be facing a much-changed Saints as reports suggested earlier in the
week. Sturrock said: ''There will be a couple of changes, nothing
drastic. The players have been left in no doubt that they must rekindle
and rebuild, and most importantly, get the fans they let down in midweek
back on their side.''
What he could have added was that probably two or three others who
goofed in midweek should also be sitting in the stand today, but his
overall message was that panic buttons have been locked away. His main
worry seems to be lack of goal-scoring, rather than a leaky defence.
Accies are just the lads to find any weaknesses.
Leaders Dundee travel to Somerset Park with first-choice keeper Michel
Pageaud suspended after last week's ordering-off. Striker George Shaw is
back after suspension, but midfielder Neil Duffy is out with a calf
injury.
Ayr manager Simond Stainrod, who has Gregg Hood fit again and Duncan
George available again after suspension, still maintains his side are
playing well enough to avoid relegation. And with his typical way of
making mischief, when asked whether or not he would be on the bench
again this week, he said: ''Since it's Dundee we're playing, I'll leave
it as a surprise.''
Dunfermline have the problem of trying to follow their victory of last
week over Dundee with a similar success over bottom club Stranraer at
East End Park. It's not as easy as it looks on paper as the Pars have
scored only once in two games against Alex McAnespie's men this season.
St Mirren, with Ricky Gillies out with an ankle injury and winger
David Elliott suspended, will face a tough time against Raith Rovers --
on a run of seven league victories -- at Love Street. Maybe if they give
Raith as tough a time as the fans threaten to do with their walk-out,
there could be a few happier faces in Paisley afterwards.

CANADIAN Mike Weir blazed through the front nine holes in 30 strokes
yesterday on his way to a course record seven-under-par 66 in the second
round of the South Australian Open over the Royal Adelaide course.
Weir's sparkling display gave him a halfway total of 141, three
strokes behind Australian joint leaders David Diaz and Anthony Painter.
Diaz, who equalled an unofficial world record in the opening round by
completing the first nine holes with just eight putts, shot a
two-under-par 71 while Painter went round in 68.
On a blustery day, Weir collected nine birdies in the space of 11
holes, including seven birdies, in his blistering attack on the opening
nine holes.
''It (his front-nine score) equals the record on the US PGA tour held
by Greg Norman, Tom Kite, Curtis Strange, Payne Stewart and Tom
Watson,'' said tournament media manager Brendan Moloney. ''It is
probably the lowest nine ever shot in Australia.''
The front nine of the Royal Adelaide course is a par 37. Leading
aggregates (Australian unless otherwise stated):
138 -- D Diaz 67, 71; A Painter 70, 68.
139 -- T Elliott 68, 71; J O'Keefe (USA) 68, 71.
140 -- C Gray 68, 72.
141 -- M Weir (Canada) 75, 66.
142 -- A Stolz 73, 69; R Green 73, 69; S Laycock 73, 69; D Ecob 73,

RETIEF Goosen yesterday matched the course record 65 of his more
illustrious countryman Ernie Els to open a two-stroke lead in the second
round of the South African Open in Johannesburg.
Els was the leader in the clubhouse for much of the day after firing
his record-setting 65 in the morning for a seven-under-par aggregate of
137.
But then Goosen's deadly accurate approach shots set up a string of
birdie chances and after eight holes he was five under for the round. He
three-putted the ninth to drop a shot, but still covered the opening
nine holes in 32.
He also dropped a shot on the fourteenth, when his drive missed the
fairway, but four more birdies put him level with Els's record round and
a two-round total of 135. Leading aggregates (S African unless otherwise
stated):
135 -- R Goosen 70, 65.
137 -- E Els 72, 65.
138 -- M Gortana (Italy) 71, 67.

SILVER linings have been elusive enough for Celtic in recent times,
but for their young players, the advent of manager Tommy Burns has
opened up doors to the first team that might otherwise have remained
closed.
Their response has been such that Parkhead fans can already dare to
imagine better times are within view.
Already this season, Burns has introduced players like 21-year-old
Stuart Gray, 20-year-old Brian McLaughlin, and 20-year-old Jim Slavin to
the top side. That has encouraged others to push their claim, and today,
a pair of 17-year-olds will get on the first-team bus for Hampden
knowing that they are now contenders for the premier division.
Marc Anthony and Michael Craig, both front players, have been doing so
well for the youth side that they were promoted to the reserves. Their
progress did not slow down there and, so, they are heading for the big
boys' playground.
It is possible that one or other will get a chance to wear the
first-team shirt on the field today against Hibs, but that probably will
be as a substitute. Burns has been happy enough with the showing of
Willie Falconer alongside Pierre van Hooydonk, and seems certain to let
that experienced pair start the game.
Also added to the pool are Charlie Nicholas, Tosh McKinlay, and Tony
Mowbray but the major decision will be who steps down to accommodate
McLaughlin. The tricky little winger was given a rest against Motherwell
last week, a decision which, as the team lost, inevitably brought
criticism from the fans.
But Billy Stark, Burns' assistant, while accepting that people could
argue the team would have won with McLaughlin in the line-up, pointed
out that Burns had always insisted on protecting younger players from
too much first-team exposure too soon.
If McLaughlin comes back, one of the midfield will have to drop out
and, as Paul McStay looks likely to be okay after having recovered from
an ankle injury, that leaves the manager with a problem. McStay, John
Collins, Peter Grant, and Phil O'Donnell form a pretty formidable
foursome, and selecting one to sit this out will not be easy.
Hibs would like to have countered the height of van Hooydonk with
their own giant, Steven Tweed, but he is suspended, as are Michael
O'Neill and David Farrell.
Kevin McAllister is doubtful with an ankle injury. For the Edinburgh
side and Celtic, the target remains second spot in the table, and a
place in the UEFA Cup.
Dundee United manager Ivan Golac was in his usual buoyant form as he
looked ahead to the home match with Falkirk, and two other matches in
February to come. He said: ''We began by knocking Clyde out of the cup
in midweek. Now, we have three more league games and a cup-tie in
February, with the chance to ensure there will be a very special March,
April, and May for the club.''
Golac is looking for his foreign imports, Jerren Nixon and Sergio, to
do the damage against Falkirk at Tannadice.
''I always knew Jerren would make it,'' he said, ''although he needed
time to adjust to a whole new way of life. And this will be Sergio's
first home game since he made such an impact in his debut against
Motherwell.''
Captain Maurice Malpas is out because of a calf injury and Jim
McInally will go through a late fitness test.
Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies received a timely boost yesterday when
Eddie May, who had been the subject of interest by Hearts and
Motherwell, agreed to an extension of his contract which will keep him
with the club until 1997.
Hearts keeper Henry Smith, who has been able to fend off more
challengers than George Foreman, looks set to take over from another
pretender, Craig Nelson, in the Hearts team against Kilmarnock at
Tynecastle.
John Millar is available again for Hearts, but Willie Jamieson is a
doubtful starter.
Kilmarnock, bidding for their fourth successive win, may be without
Mark Skilling and Colin McKee, who are doubtful, and add former Celtic
player Dugald McCarrison to the squad.
Partick Thistle's win over Hibs last week had every side in the lower
half of the league looking over their shoulder, and if they come up with
another success against Motherwell, there may be some panic in the ranks
of sides who feel they might be safe.
However, Motherwell are in good form again and, although Chris McCart
is suspended, both Steve Kirk and Rab Shannon are free after bans.
Manager Alex McLeish might well stand by two-goal midweek scorer Alex
Burns, even though Tommy Coyne and Dougie Arnott are fit.

A CAPITAL-only or repayment mortgage coupled with a PEP can be a
positive way forward in the investment stakes -- but only if a person
can afford such a measure.
Even then certain steps should be taken for the duration of a mortgage
payment term to ensure personal financial success.
As little as three years ago homebuyers were being advised that an
endowment mortgage was the best way to plan for the future.
Now, that has all changed, as David Hume, director of Stewart Ivory,
explained: ''If you have some money left over on taking out a mortgage,
take a PEP because you have got the complete flexibility, you can stop
and start, and it is tax efficient.
''What would worry me about PEP mortgages is that some people may use
unreasonable assumptions. So they may say: 'I assume my investment will
grow at 12% per annum, so if I put #50 into my PEP plan over 25 years
that is going to be worth #80,000.'
''Whereas, investments in the next 25 years may not do as well as they
have done in the past 25 years because of different circumstances.''
If inflation is lower that alters the entire equation by how much an
individual can afford to borrow in the first place.
PEP mortgages can be a very good idea because they force people to
save, together with the tax savings and complete flexibility where, if a
person needs to sell his or her house or a job is lost, then, unlike an
endowment policy with poorer surrender terms, with a PEP a person can
get back what it is worth.
Another point to note is that at the end of the 25-year-term, if a
person is expected to pay off a house loan and the markets are down then
a snag can occur.
Here an individual should therefore adopt a strategy as they move
towards the pay-off period, of taking money out of their PEP to reduce
the mortgage earlier. So the message is: don't be too greedy.
John Beattie, mortgage adviser with Aitchison and Colegrave, said:
''Negative press about endowment policies has increased and therefore
investors are looking for other mortgage repayment vehicles, and now
that tax relief on life assurance policies is no longer available, PEPs
offer major tax advantages to the investor.''
Mr Beattie said that PEPs often have the option to switch to a new
investment house at relatively low cost to the investor.
''They also tend to have a larger choice of funds for investment than
more conventional repayment vehicles and for the more adventurous
investor, some PEP providers offer a range of higher risk/reward
funds.''
However, for the more cautious investor a balanced fund is more
advisable and, as a result of changes in the last Budget a new wave of
PEPs are being introduced which are expected to be of a more cautious
nature.

SEVERIANO Ballesteros, playing with the zest of his younger days, said
he ''will not feel guilty'' if he wins his own money at the Canary
Islands Open in Gran Canaria this week.
This European Tour event is being promoted by the Spaniard's own
company, Amen Corner, and Ballesteros, three shots ahead after shooting
68 and 69 in his first two rounds for a seven-under-par aggregate of
137, can hardly stop smiling.
The first prize is #41,660 and Ballesteros said with the straightest
of faces: ''It would be very nice to win my own money.''
His only complaint after his second-round 69 was the colour of the
greens. They have been sprayed reddish-purple by greenkeeping staff and
Ballesteros, showing his improving knowledge of English terms, says:
''It makes me see red when I look at the greens.
''When they paint the greens it is very nice for TV but not for
players. It is sometimes difficult to read greens when they are green,
but now they are red you often have to guess what will happen.''
Ballesteros had no complaints about the large, excited gallery who
tended to be noisy when he was about to play a shot. ''I do not mind the
crowd,'' he said. ''I have dealt with this sort of thing since 1976.''
For all his supposed putting problems, Ballesteros still managed to
single-putt four times, snapped up five birdies and dropped only two
shots.
Ballesteros leads Paul Eales by three shots and Irishman Darren
Clarke, Sweden's Anders Forsbrand, and Salisbury-based Gary Emerson by
four but is still making no predictions.
Eales, joint first-round leader with Ballesteros, Philip Walton and
Gary Orr, shot a second-round 72 with two birdies and one double bogey
intermingled with 15 pars.
''I hit the ball really well,'' said Eales, based at Royal Lytham and
St Annes. ''But I had real problems on the greens. I could never really
tell the line or pace but managed to get round without three putting so
was very pleased.''
Eales will play with Ballesteros in the third round today and said:
''It's a fantastic opportunity to learn from one of the all-time greats
and I do not think I will be nervous.''
Orr quickly fell away and shot a three-over-par 75, but Walton had an
even sadder tale. The 32-year-old Irishman was only one shot behind
Ballesteros at six under par after seven holes.
But successive bogeys at the eighth and ninth, then successive double
bogeys at the eleventh and twelfth ruined his card and he had to settle
for a 76, falling back to level.
Emerson, who began his second round one shot off the lead, had a
satisfactory 72 while both Clarke and Forsbrand improved their positions
with three-under-par 69s.
But unless Ballesteros blows up -- and on his present form that looks
inconceivable -- there will be only one winner.

STIRLING Albion have to wait to see whether keeper Mike Monaghan, the
hero of last week's 2-0 victory at Stenhousemuir, will be fit to face
Morton in today's second division promotion match at Forthbank.
Monaghan kept at bay the same strike-force that went on to put four
goals past St Johnstone in a midweek Scottish Cup tie. Morton manager
Allan McGraw feels that his team miss too many chances, but Albion would
like Monaghan to be between the sticks just in case the visitors happen
to have their scoring boots on.
Full back John Gibson is another doubt for Stirling, while Morton have
to wait for defender Steve McCahill and midfielder Paul Blair.
Another interesting fixture takes place at Broadwood, where the
division's two highest scoring teams meet. Berwick, who are one point
off second place and one above their hosts, won by the odd goal in seven
when they visited Clyde early in the season.
Clyde wait for veteran striker George McCluskey, while Berwick last
night signed 26-year-old central defender Alistair Reid from junior club
Ormiston Primrose and included him in their squad.
Terry Christie always considered that his Stenhousemuir team would be
good front-runners if they took over the leadership and there was no
reason to doubt his judgment until last week's hiccup at home to
Stirling.
Christie will be hoping that today's fixture away to struggling
Brechin City beats the weather. Tom Steel is doubtful for 'Muir, but
Brechin should have Gavin Price back in their strike force.
New manager Jimmy Crease takes charge of Albion Rovers with a third
division contest at Coatbridge against Caley Thistle, who have Dave
Brennan suspended.
Forfar are the only team in Scotland with an unbeaten home record, but
the leaders will be tested by neighbours Montrose, who are eight points
off the pace but have three games in hand.
Second-placed Ross County will hope to repeat their cup success over
Alloa, but may have to keep an eye on Danny Diver, who hit a hat trick
last week.

CLACH should be charitable if winger Johnny Seaton is below par
against Lossiemouth in today's McEwan's Lager North Cup tie. After all,
the player can hardly have found his feet after arriving from Canada in
a remarkable transatlantic Highland transfer.
Seaton emigrated over a year ago, but had his hopes of a career with
Vancouver Whitecaps dashed when he was refused a work permit. When he
decided to come home, his former club acted swiftly and, with the help
of a one-off sponsorship from British Airways, got the player back via a
10-hour flight in time to re-sign yesterday.
The 22-year-old will go straight into the squad for Clach's tie
against Lossiemouth today.

ANDREW Cowan's Warwickshire-based Mitsubishi team dominated
yesterday's first leg of the world championship Swedish rally, holding
first and second places after eight special stages.
The former rally driver from Berwickshire saw new signing, Finland's
Tommi Makinen, hurl his Lancer over the first of 25 snow and ice-covered
speed tests to share lead with reigning champion Didier Auriol (Toyota
Celica) and last year's winner, Swede Thomas Radstron (Celica).
Makinen was eventually overhauled by his Swedish team mate and 1991
winner, Kenneth Eriksson, who had a two-second lead when the rally
halted in Falun, last night.
In third place is Lanark's Colin McRae, 39 seconds behind Makinen.
McRae's Subaru Impreza recorded the fastest time on Stage 7, at 44k, the
longest in the 1600k rally. Leading positions:
1, K Eriksson/S Parmander, Mitsubshi Lancer, 1hr 51min 25secs; 2, T
Makinen/S Harjanne, Mitsubishi Lancer, 1-51.27; 3, C McRae/D Ringer
(GB), Subara Impreza 1-52.06; 4, T Radstrom/L Backman, Toyota Celica
1-52.15; 5, C Sainz/L Moya, Subaru Impreza 1-52.29.

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S Stephen Hendry was the victim of another Peter Ebdon great
escape act at the Wembley Conference Centre last night in the
quarter-finals of the #435,000 Benson and Hedges Masters snooker
tournament.
The cool Londoner fought back from 4-2 down to record a surprise 5-4
victory over favourite Hendry. The world's No 10 said: ''Considering the
circumstances, pressure, tension and occasion, I am delighted.''
Hendry, seeking to win the most prestigious invitation tournament for
the sixth time in seven years, made a poor start -- but so did Ebdon.
The world champion led 2-1 before he got firmly into his stride with a
112 break -- his thirtieth century of the season -- in the fourth frame.
Ebdon, who beat the Scot en route to winning the 1993 Skoda Grand
Prix, fought back by taking the fifth with a 67 break, but when Hendry
re-established a two-frame advantage at 4-2, it appeared he would
provide Ronnie O'Sullivan's semi-final opposition.
Hendry accounted for the sixth frame with an inch-perfect 141 total
clearance, which supercedes Tony Drago's first round effort of 132 as
the highest break of the tournament so far and gives Hendry an excellent
chance of scooping a #10,000 bonus.
Hendry looked certain to chalk up his twenty-fifth win in 26 matches
at the Masters since making his first appearance in 1989 -- but Ebdon
had other ideas. The former world junior champion from Wellingborough
dominated the next two frames with runs of 46 and 47.
Once again Hendry looked the most likely winner when he established a
37-1 lead, but, on a break of 36, he overcut a red to a top pocket to
throw Ebdon a lifeline. He replied with a 53 break but looked to have
missed his chance when he failed to pot a difficult last red across the
top cushion.
Hendry potted it with a black but, with tension at fever pitch, missed
a yellow with the rest.
Ebdon, breathing heavily and clearly needing time between shots to
compose himself, potted the yellow, a tough green, the brown and blue to
leave Hendry 23 points behind, with only pink and black on the table. It
was a position even the World No 1 could not retrieve.
Ebdon, who celebrated his victory in typical style by saluting the
crowd, shaking his first and raising his cue above his head, said:
''Even when I was 3-1, and 4-2 down, I kept thinking I would win. It's a
great feeling, especially because I had such good support in the
arena.''
Hendry paid tribute to his conquerer, saying: ''You've got to admire
Peter. His attitude is fantastic and he never gives up.'' Earlier,
O'Sullivan had beaten Welshman Terry Griffiths by five frames to two.

SELF-select or managed investment trust PEPs? Each have their
strengths and can be a fruitful method by which an investor builds his
or her portfolio, but you have got to know what you are doing.
The original concept of a self-select PEP is where an individual who
enjoys choosing and investing in companies goes direct to a stockbroker,
who gives that person the PEP wrapper -- such as a series of investment
trusts and which can represent an excellent way of spreading the risk
into a personal equity plan.
Various people offer self-select PEPs and some offer much more
favourable terms than others, so it is wise to shop around no matter how
sophisticated you feel you are at handling stocks and shares.
Watch the cost factor. Whoever provides the wrapper will almost
certainly charge for the service and that could be 1% of the PEP value,
just for the wraparound. Then there is the underlying cost of buying and
selling the securities.
With the investment trust a widely diversified portfolio can be drawn
together and with a personal investment looked after by a management
company and dealing costs of underlying securities all transacted at
institutional rates, which is much cheaper, then an individual no matter
how active an investor, may choose the latter as the safest way to
invest through a PEP.
In all, self-select PEPs should almost certainly be held by any
tax-paying investors with an individual equity holding in excess of
#3000. Most quoted companies offer this facility through a PEP
administrator, typically a bank or building society.
There would normally be a one-off conversion charge and an ongoing
yearly administration fee payable but this should be more than
compensated by the enhanced dividend achieved by reclaiming the tax
credit.
Self-select represents an extremely cost effective method of securing
future enhanced returns for the PEP investor.

TOM Brewster, of Lockerbie, continued to set the pace among the men's
teams yesterday evening in the Bank of Scotland Scottish Junior Curling
Championships at Kilmarnock's Galleon Centre.
His sixth-round victory by 10-4 over David Mundell, of Greenacres,
kept him at the top of the rankings and guaranteed him a place in
tomorrow's semi-finals. His only blemish came earlier yesterday when he
lost 8-7 to Ross MacKay, of Gogar Park.
The other three semi-final spots in the men's event are being chased
by five teams, including former world junior champion James Dryburgh of
Aviemore, who now has four wins following a slow start, and Craig Wilson
of Lockerbie, on three.
Fiona Brown and her Greenacres team of Julie McGregor, Susie Law, and
Jan Byers booked their semi-final place. After six rounds, Brown's team
are the only undefeated unit competing -- their 8-2 defeat of
Lockerbie's Alison Meechie yesterday following a 7-6 win over Sheila
Swan of Kinross. Kirsty Drummond, of Ayr, will join Brown in tomorrow's
semi-finals -- a 9-5 victory over Lesley Stobo of Hamilton giving her
team five victories. Results:
Men. Fourth round - D Mundell 5, C Hildrey 2; L McLeary 3, T Brewster
9; C Wilson 3, R MacKay 5; D Gladstone 7, J Dryburgh 4.

In the ''leaked'' framework document on Northern Ireland, reference
was made to the proposed ''harmonisation'' of health, education,
agriculture and trade between north and south.
This evoked the expected response from the Unionist MPs in Parliament,
dealt with, unconvincingly, by Patrick Mayhew.
It is inconceivable that such a document could be used as a basis for
any north-south discussions without the inclusion of the vital fifth
factor necessary for the existence and stability of any country. That
fifth factor is security.
Was this part deliberately excluded from the leak due to the undoubted
furore it would have caused, and not only from the Ulster Unionist MPs?
The obvious ramifications are the disbandment of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary and policing of the province controlled from Dublin.

MYSILV can add Newbury's Tote Gold Trophy to her scoresheet today.
Last time out, she came home like a train, showing she had recaptured
her class of last season when she won here over course and distance on
similar going. She escapes a penalty for her recent win and meets
runner-up Pridwell on better terms.
Cockney Lad ran below form at Leopardstown and could be the danger if
he is back to his best. Trying Again goes well on today's ground but has
yet to prove himself on a left-handed course.
Lo Stregone is a worthy favourite for the opening race after a
commanding display over course and distance last time out. His only
defeat this season was when the extended trip at Haydock found him out
and he should see off today's rivals. Dont Tell The Wife was always
behind him when they last met and never looked like catching him before
taking a tumble.
Viking Flagship can redeem himself for a below-par run at Ascot by
landing the Game Spirit Chase. A poor entry leaves him only two rivals,
both of whom he has trounced already this season.
The big chase at Uttoxeter has only two entries running off their
correct handicap mark. On paper that should give Minnehoma the edge, but
carting top weight over this marathon trip remains a bigger challenge
than his easy victory over half the distance last month. It may pay to
oppose him with Tartan Tyrant who has only twice been beaten in over a
dozen completed runs over timber.
Desperately heavy going means disappointing fields at Ayr, where only
two line up for the most valuable race on the card. Ali's Alibi looks
set to win his fourth race of the season, but the odds are unlikely to
be tempting.
A more attractive betting proposition is Celtic Song in the Carsphairn
Chase. This game and consistent sort won cleverly at Catterick in
November and can score again over modest opposition.
Sarmatian landed some smart bets on his hurdling debut and should have
progressed enough to take the last race here.
* SCOTTISH Television sports presenter Jim Delahunt has his first ride
over jumps at Ayr today when he partners Hargold Lad in the Whitletts
Amateur Riders' Claiming Hurdle, writes Tom McConnell.
Delahunt, who reports mainly on football, had his first ride as an
amateur for Linda Perratt on Family Line at Hamilton Park last summer.
He was taught to race ride by Robert McKellar, former head lad at Cree
Lodge, who trains Hargold Lad at his Lesmahagow yard.
Said McKellar: ''Jim has always wanted to ride over the jumps. He
schooled Hargold Lad on Wednesday and the horse jumped brilliantly for
him. I hope they see out the trip.''

As a devoted English reader of your excellent newspaper, I was amused
that Mr Dave Stewart should be upset that his report of a fault on his
telephone was answered by a BT operator in Lincoln (January 25).
When we Londoners ring directory inquiries we are answered by
operators in Scotland. Unlike Mr Stewart, my English nationalism is not
''fired up'' by this. The Scottish operators are always courteous and
helpful, and usually find the right number, although some need a little
prompting about locations south of the Border.
And for nearly 20 years my tax affairs have been dealt with
efficiently and fairly by the Inland Revenue in Edinburgh. Now my file
has been moved to Salford, which can't even get my address right.
For God's sake don't declare independence or England will be done for.

You describe the SNP's current internal argument as ''a bogus quacking
affair'' (February 1). It is a nice phrase and one which could well be
extended to describe the entire devolution/separation debate.
In 1968 Edward Heath put a kilt on back-to-front and proposed a
Scottish assembly. Electoral result: zero. In the 1970 election the
Scottish Conservative vote remained static.
In February, 1974, Harold Wilson was an assembly sceptic but in
October he became a sudden convert. Electoral result: zero. With no
assembly in the February election Labour took 36.6% of the vote; with an
assembly in its manifesto in October it took 36.3% of the vote.
In a referendum in March, 1979, more Scottish voters stayed at home
than turned out to vote in either the ''Yes'' or ''No'' lobbies and in
the General Election two months later the Nationalist upsurge collapsed
having served its intended purpose of jolting Westminster out of
indifference to Scotland's problems and of firing a shot across the bows
of an indolent Scottish political establishment.
It was over. What happened after that had nothing whatsoever to do
with the Scottish electorate. The post-1979 ''devolution debate'' was a
form of political entertainment promoted and hosted by the Scottish
media and one which, without the media intending it to, rose higher and
higher on thermals of hyperbole until it left electoral reality far
below.
Throughout its close-to-13-year run the devolution debate influenced
Scotland's voting behaviour hardly at all -- Labour averaged some 39% of
the vote over the three General Elections in 1983, 1987, and 1992,
Conservatives 26%, the Lib Dems 19% and the SNP 16% with no significant
changes within these averages.
Since 1979 the only changes of a magnitude of plus or minus 10% have
been the SNP's increase of 9.8% in support and the Lib Dems' loss of
11.4% in support, hardly evidence of voters in Scotland clamouring for
an assembly or struggling to break their bonds as political prisoners.
What we are seeing now in the SNP's ''bogus quacking affair'' and in
the hapless Mr Blair having been landed on the back of an assembly tiger
is the result of politicians relegating the ballot to an irrelevance and
General Election results to the status of mere aberrations awaiting
correction by the next opinion poll.
We, of course, still have the ballot box -- if we distract our
attention from the Punch and Judy antics of a party that has averaged
15% of the Scottish vote over the past 30 years.

I made a very comfortable journey from Glenrothes to Glasgow in just
over one-and-a-half hours, arriving at Buchanan Street bus station at
2.40pm.
From then it took me till 5pm to arrive in Johnstone -- fully two
hours and 20 minutes after travelling the breadth of central Scotland --
and this was entirely due to the lack of information available at the
bus station.
It is time that Strathclyde Transport and Glasgow Tourist Board made
urgent efforts to get their respective acts together to provide travel
information to strangers who may arrive at the bus station laden with
luggage only to find themselves in the limbo of the most depressing,
uncomfortable, unhelpful long-distance terminus I have ever seen.
In short, it is a disgrace and brings shame on the city of Glasgow.

NICK Faldo failed to qualify when he had another dreadful putting day
in a second-round 71 on the 6592-yard North course in the $1.2m Buick
Invitational on a sun-soaked afternoon here at Torrey Pines yesterday.
Faldo's 36-hole aggregate of 142 (71, 71) missed the cut by one stroke
and the 37-year-old Briton was in a foul mood as he walked off the last
green. ''It all came down to one club (the putter). That's all you need
to know,'' he rapped brusquely.
Early in his second round he reverted to using a normal putting grip,
possibly in sheer desperation, for absolutely nothing had dropped.
Turning in 36 after nine straight pars and knowing he had to score
birdies on his inward stretch to join the 70 qualifiers, he showed his
championship mettle.
He holed a birdie nine-footer on the tenth green and a 10-footer at
the short twelfth to go three under. But he missed an 18-inch tap-in at
the next and a three-putt put him in dire trouble.
he looked as though he would birdie the 497-yard last when he was just
over the green in two. Perhaps thinking he needed an eagle 3, he went
boldly for the cup but the ball drifted four feet to the left. Had he
holed that putt he would have been playing today, but he again lipped
out.
He now takes a fortnight's holiday with his wife Gill and their
children in Florida before restarting in Miami on March 2. Early leading
scores:
132 -- B Chamblee 66, 66.

I refer to the article by Alan McDermid on the death of my daughter
(January 28).
We are all deeply shocked by what has happened, and while I accept
that the article was written with the best of intentions, there are some
factual inaccuracies that I would like to put right.
The fire on the boat was caused by a cigarette thrown from a passing
car during the night while my daughter, her aunt and uncle were asleep.
My wife was with my daughter throughout her stay in hospital -- she
did not travel to and from France as indicated, although I did need to
return periodically for business reasons.
Christina died peacefully some four days after doctors told us that
there was nothing further they could do for her. Her breathing was
assisted by a ventilator which was not turned off untill after her
death.
Despite her terrible injuries Christina remained conscious for most of
her time in hospital and was very brave throughout.

Have those who wish to ban the export of live calves thought through
the logic of their campaign? I abhor the use of veal crates as much as
most, but it seems to me that solely banning live exports from this
country will, in fact, increase their use on the Continent.
Dairy farmers state, correctly, that the sale of male calves is
essential to keep milk (and therefore butter, cheese, yoghurt, etc)
production economically worth while.
As customer demand for veal stands at the moment, white veal produced
by continental methods is preferred to pink veal produced by the more
humane British way. There is very little more market for British veal,
given today's preferences.
Thus, if the male calves are not exported live, then they will have to
be killed at birth; British milk production will then become uneconomic
and will cease (together with the manufacture of British butter and
cheeses) and we will all be buying continental milk and milk products,
which are economical to produce because the continental bull calves are
consigned to veal crates.
The import of continental milk and products cannot be prevented under
EU rules.
All the current campaign will produce, if successful, will be the
permanent shutdown of yet one more British industry. Surely it is more
logical to put pressure on Euro MPs and persuade British consumers to
boycott continental milk and milk products while there is still a
British dairy industry.

WHEN was the last time you looked at what your competition was doing
-- not just in Scotland, not just in the UK, but anywhere in the world
where businesses are serving the same market needs as your company?
Never, do I hear you say? Maybe you are missing a trick. There can be
no doubt that regardless of how superbly your organisation is
performing, no matter how often grateful customers shower you with
compliments and contracts, someone somewhere else is doing it better.
Sooner or later -- and these days it is probably going to be sooner --
a competitor will arrive on your doorstep with that better product or
process, and you will be caught. Worse, you probably won't even see it
coming.
In this global village of ours it has become remarkably easy to keep
in touch. If you are a computer buff you can use Internet to scan the
electronic world for intelligence on your markets elsewhere. If you are
into databases you can search any of half-a-dozen commercial services to
see what the world's media are saying about your sector.
More simply, you can subscribe to the relevant magazines or
directories that are produced for most business sectors in most
countries. The US, in particular, pours out a vast flow of publications
covering every corner of every market you have ever heard of.
For some years we have subscribed to those two US business giants
Forbes and Fortune. We admire their single-minded focus on people rather
than organisations, and the way they rank everything that moves. We
occasionally borrow ideas from these massive magazine empires for
adaption to the smaller scale of our own local market.
There is another US publication called Folio which is the magazine of
the country's vast magazine industry. It rapidly became essential
reading for a number of people in our company, offering proven
techniques to achieve such tricks as persuading readers to subscribe to
publications they originally received free (a topic of deep interest to
us).
Even better, Folio organised twice-yearly conferences. We went, along
with a sprinkling of representatives from the London magazine industry,
and we learned.
More recently, as we explore commerical prospects in the burgeoning
entrepreneurial scene in Scotland, we have taken to another couple of US
titles, namely Inc and Entrepreneur. Not only do they offer a
first-class insight into how people run successful businesses, but they
are full of good basic tips. We've also looked at similar titles in
Germany, France and Italy.
Studies of successful companies across the world show that they tend
to think internationally even if they don't actually trade outside their
own shores. They watch trends and compare themselves to the best,
anywhere.
Another important factor is innovation. Highly successful businesses
are market-led, responsive, radical and creative in their development.
They create the majority of the new niches, the breakthroughs, the leaps
of imagination that can re-define markets overnight, leaving the
bureaucratic giants struggling to stay within sight.
The third ''I'' factor must be intelligence, not so much in terms of
the sheer brain power possessed by your management team, but in the
added value you can put into your products through clever design or some
other unique element. Again it is their sharper, more focused
intelligence that helps smaller companies beat the bigger ones to the
new trend or the new technology.
When you think about it, these three ''I'' factors are interlinked.
The ability to think internationally, to innovate routinely and to apply
intelligence effectively to your business process is likely to be the
natural consequences of a specific mindset on the part of management.
The best term to describe that mindset is ''aspiration''. If you aspire
to succeed on a big scale, the odds are that you will end up doing these
things anyway.
Ah, there's always something new. And just when you thought you were
doing so well . . .

February 6.
An important opportunity will arise this spring to cure a deadly
disease -- the contagious spread of nuclear weapons.
Twenty-five years ago the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty came into
force. It was widely acclaimed as a means of curbing the threat of
planetary suicide which nuclear weapons entail.
In April, 1995, a renewal conference will be held at the United
Nations in New York to consider a new treaty. The refusal of nuclear
powers to stop their production of these weapons or to dismantle their
current arsenals sticks in the throats of the non-nuclear states. Why
should they support a treaty which the nuclear powers have consistently
disregarded?
If non-nuclear states are to continue to support the treaty, our own
Government must develop a plan that will win their support. Such a plan
could include a comprehensive test ban treaty; unconditional assurances
that nuclear weapons will not be used against non-nuclear states; and a
clear commitment to the eventual elimination of these weapons.
The Scottish churches see this as an ethical issue of the highest
importance. They invite all who share this concern to urge their MPs to
ensure that the Non-Proliferation Treaty is renewed by nuclear and
non-nuclear states -- and, in particular, by the British Government.

A TAKE-OFF in Finnair shares helped Murray European limit its losses
last year and outperform its benchmark index.
The investment trust's net asset value fell 0.9% to 63.9p during the
year to end-December, compared with a decline of 2.9% in the FT
Actuaries Europe ex-UK index. However, nav has fallen 4% to 61.3p since
the year-end.
Murray European proposed a final dividend of 0.35p, up 25%. However,
with the trust's objective being capital growth, shareholders were
warned against taking this as an indication of future dividend.
The trust's two Finnish equity holdings appreciated by 73% in sterling
terms, or #919,000, taking their presence in the portfolio from 6% to
11%. Finnair, Murray European's largest investment, performed
particularly well and forest products group Kymmene also made strong
gains.
The value of existing French holdings declined by about 7%. However,
France's weighting, the heaviest in Murray European's portfolio, was
marginally increased to 27%, with another #427,000 invested during the
year. Existing German stocks lost about 9% in sterling terms but new
investment almost matched depreciation and their year-end weighting was
steady at 15%.
During the year, Murray European cut back in Switzerland, reducing its
holdings to #1.04m, slightly more than one-third of their previous
value. This was done so investors can reap the benefits of a sharper
cyclical recovery elsewhere in Europe.
In the short run, Glasgow-based fund manager Murray Johnstone believes
further tightening by the US Federal Reserve will be followed by the
main European central banks and may constrain stock markets.
However, it believes a positive economic backdrop should mean that
periods of weakness will present longer-term investment opportunities
for the #22m fund.
Gearing was 15.4% at the year-end, compared with 14.5% at the end of
December 1993.
Manager David Briggs believes the advent of below-trend growth in the
US would be good news for Murray European investors, with the biggest
shake-out in Continental bond markets for a long time in 1994 having hit
equities.

Newsnight front man Jeremy Paxman is in the firing line because of his
no-prisoners approach to political interviews, but can the BBC tame the
man who shoots from the lip, and why should they want to anyway?
POLITICIANS, as John Major famously pointed out not so long ago, can
be bastards. They can also be dishonest, arrogant, rude, hypocritical,
self-important, sleazy, disingenuous, evasive, misleading, sexually
warped, and (the one to which they never admit) downright wrong.
Now, it is clearly impossible for each and every citizen of this
country to make a personal approach to the politician of their choice
and ask him or her the burning questions which prey upon their mind. So,
in this imperfect world, it is left to the press and the media to
appoint journalists to act upon the nation's behalf.
It is up to them to pin our elected representatives up against a
metaphorical wall and try, as best they can, to get to the heart and the
truth of the matter. It is, of course, often easier to crawl under a
snake's belly with a top hat on your head than it is to get a straight
answer from an MP.
Which is why God invented Jeremy Paxman. He is the personification of
No More Mr Nice Guy. He is vicious but fair. The Interviewer From Hell.
The Waffen SS of the BBC. The Victor Meldrew of television journalism.
His style is a heady mixture of affected boredom and almost theatrical
incredulity. A combination of a sneer (''Oh, come on now, Minister'')
and an exclamation (''Do you honestly expect me to believe that?'').
When John Birt arrived at the BBC as deputy director general in 1987,
one of his first acts was to deliver a ''wee-room job'' to Paxman. The
chap in the grey Armani suit took the big man into his office and showed
him the yellow card for his take-no-prisoners interviewing style. This,
however, was not quite so serious as you might think since Sue Lawley
and David Dimbleby received similar treatment.
Birt, as it turned out, failed both miserably and spectacularly with
Paxman. The journalist continued to be gloriously unimpressed by
political pomposity and carried on giving MPs of all persuasions and
rank well-deserved hell. In a BBC news and current affairs department
which seems these days to be the natural habitat of well-meaning but
turgidly boring and charisma-bypassed specialists (nice man that Peter
Jay but do you really understand what he's talking about?), Jeremy
Paxman stands out like a beacon of sanity and plain-speaking. He is the
People's Representative. The public's counsel for the prosecution. And
he looks good too.
With apologies to Jon Snow and Kirsty Wark, he is the only presenter
who can make BBC2's Newsnight genuinely compulsive viewing. And why?
Well, two reasons. First, because he is better at asking questions than
politicians are at answering them. And secondly, because his
confrontational style (which often comes close to intellectual mugging)
makes for damned good television. He doesn't miss and hit the wall. He
has a ''delete waffle'' button in his brain.
It is surely one of the great vicarious pleasures of life to see
Government Ministers hoist by their own petard under Paxman's abrasive
questioning.
The man is box-office material -- and the viewers love him. So,
naturally, death-wish Birt (a non-journalist who wouldn't know a story
if it bit him on the nose) wants him to change his style. Last week, in
a remarkably ill-judged speech delivered in Dublin, the director general
hit out at ''overbearing and disdainful'' interviewers who ''like the
disorientating opening question -- the rabbit punch''. Since Birt was
describing the classic Paxman technique, it was generally assumed that
he was having a go at poor Jeremy.
He went on to declare that ''elected politicians have a higher claim
to speak for the people than journalists''. Which, when you think about
it, was a very strange remark to make. It is, after all, the
journalist's job to speak for the people; to ask the questions we want
asked. If an interviewer cannot grill an MP of an evening then what's
the point in having current affairs programmes? We might just as well
show party political broadcasts and be done with it. The problem is, of
course, that Paxman doesn't so much grill them; he barbecues them. And
it is wonderful to watch.
The DG's broadside was seen as a shorthand message to Paxman -- and
his equally merciless colleague John Humphrys of BBC Radio Four's Today
programme -- to cool it with the Tories. To take it easy with Government
Ministers. No (tough) questions asked. It can only now be a matter of
time before Terry Wogan is signed up for Newsnight.
There was a time, of course, in the days when TV interviewers wore
dinner suits to work, when the politicians set the agenda. They would
decide what questions would be asked; what points would be made. It was
all very decent and gentlemanly. And stage managed.
Then, in the sixties and through the seventies, David Frost and Robin
Day came along and all bets were cancelled. They were polite and they
maintained a formal respect for politicians but there was no denying
that it was they who asked the questions. But now Day has virtually
retired and Frost has become as much an establishment figure as the
people he interviews. His Sunday morning programme is little more than
an old pals' act. So what's left?
Well, on TV there are the Dimbleby's, Jonathan and David, there's
Kirsty Wark and Jon Snow, and then there's Brian Walden. Radio fairs
somewhat better with the aggressive James Naughtie and the
aforementioned John Humphrys. All of them are highly accomplished
interviewers but head and shoulders above them stands Paxman.
A Cambridge graduate, he started his broadcasting career with a
baptism of fire -- as a reporter covering the Troubles in Northern
Ireland. In 1977 he moved to London to work on Tonight. Three years
later he went to the BBC's flagship Panorama, reporting from
international hot spots like El Salvador, the Lebanon, and Uganda.
In the mid-eighties he joined Sue Lawley and Nicholas Witchell to
front the re-vamped Six O'Clock News and, in late 1986, moved to
Breakfast Time. He joined Newsnight in 1989.
He shines on brightly in the role because he is, frankly, far more
interesting than the people he interviews (which is no great claim to
fame in these days of bland pick-and-mix politicians). Government
Ministers, with a few exceptions, could bore for Britain. The Shadow
Cabinet is little better.
Both sides are guided by those professional spin doctors who advise
them on how to avoid answering questions directly. But it is an exercise
in futility. They should play safe and stick to the 30-second soundbite
because, in the end, they are all like lambs being led to the Paxman
slaughterhouse. There is no contest in Jeremy's Parliamentary Challenge.
Bad luck Tories; can you take it Labour? Yes, but only if Bamber
Gascoigne asks the questions.

THE pound managed to stave off a major fall against the German mark,
closing only marginally weaker on the day at DM2.3776. That represents a
drop of a pfennig on the week, although against the dollar, last night's
close at $1.5625 meant a gain of over a third-of-a-cent on the day but
virtually no change on the week.
Dealers are very nervous about both the weekend press which is
expected to savage the Government's position on Europe with a clear
divergence seen between the Premier and the Chancellor.
Ahead lies a week of economic data, while on the political front,
there is continuing concern over the relationship with the Ulster
Unionists.
The dollar was hit by further evidence of inflation in the US with the
January producer price index pointing to a 1% rise in the prices of
intermediate goods, and so indicating higher prices for finished items.
The currency was also affected by the weakness of the Mexican peso
after the government said that it would hunt out leaders of the
rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas which could lead to more
disturbance.

IN my last game of big-time rugby, in 1987 against England at
Twickenham, I was nearly a stone underweight, had tonsillitis, got
carried off when my posterior cruciate ligament went twang, had a
shocker anyway, and succumbed to the presence of one Dean Richards, the
English No.8.
Seldom in my life had I been blown off the pitch so emphatically, and
never before by an amorphous mass of 6ft 5in, 17[1/2]st traffic
policeman, who was a mystery even to his team-mates. That's for sure.
Richards, Britain's most complete No.8 and one of the reasons that the
English pack is so dominant, is enjoying a resurgence late in his career
that never seemed likely two years ago when he was discarded by England
in their quest for someone younger. First capped in 1986, the man still
takes some stopping.
He never does interviews, but he has The Herald. ''Well,'' he said,
''down here you have to get used to being put up to be shot down again,
and that's what happened to me. Some of the boys love the media stuff,
but I don't, I like getting on with the game.''
So what motivates Richards, a man who, when on tour with England, got
invitations to join scrummage practices even when he was there -- he
hardly pushed they say. He saved it for games. He is, by all accounts,
his own man, a fellow for whom the trappings of fame mean nothing. A man
who is as happy in his police car as anywhere.
''I suppose I do keep myself to myself in some way,'' he said, ''but I
play rugby for one reason, and that is that I enjoy it. I just like the
game. I do think that there are some players at the top now who play the
game for a different reason, maybe that's cash and profile, but that
doesn't interest me and never has.''
Ever since I first saw him play I have noticed that Richards limps,
whether walking or running. How someone like him can shuffle as he does,
but influence games materially at the same time, is baffling, but a
credit to his skill. The limp is explained. ''I have one leg shorter
than the other, and that's why I look as though I'm limping.''
When it comes to size, the statistics of the English pack can be
mind-boggling. Second rows reach for the sky at 6ft 10in. Tim Rodber, at
blind-side wing forward, is 6-6, the height of Scotland's tallest man,
Stewart Campbell, who is expected to compete with Martin Bayfield, the
6ft 10in. Richards, and Ben Clarke are both 6-5.
Surely this means that England not only have the game plan, but the
size and bulk, to legitimately lay claim to the proposition that
Scotland, by comparison, are second division? Second division in height,
and skill.
''No, I don't actually go by that theory,'' says Richards.
''Certainly, our overall game has changed since we toured South Africa.
What we saw there was that their style was far more advanced than ours,
and we had to learn quickly to play a different type of rugby, and so we
did change under Jack Rowell.
''He does leave much of the organisation of the team to us as a group,
and we do work things out. I can see that happening to the Scots. People
seem very negative about the Scots, which I find sad. They have always
been great competitors, and I know that they will raise their game
against us.
''I have toured with Ian McGeechan as coach, and I rate many of the
Scots very highly, and I see that your game is advancing, too. No, it
would be wrong to say that your country is second division.''
And yet the English, with their formidable back row so influential in
last week's demolition of the French, look, in World Cup year, like one
of the major forces in the world. As Jim Telfer said wisely on last
week's Rugby Special TV programme, just when you think that the English
have one style of play, they will be one game ahead in tactics.
''Yes, we do work hard at what we do,'' says Richards. ''But to single
out the back row would be wrong. We now have a set of backs who not only
have pace, but can stay on their feet to wait for us if need be.
''We don't have an out-and-out open-side flyer like Neil Back, but Ben
Clarke is learning the role all the time, and the extra time that Will
Carling and Guscott can stay on their feet helps us. Also, the front
five work hard. They win the games.''
With that it was time to say goodbye. He is a charming man. He may
frustrate Scots with the way he can kill the ball so adeptly, but their
is no questioning his the will to win, love of the game, and genuine
feeling for the sport that embraces one of England's towers of strength.
''I feel I am very lucky to have played in what people may well look
back on as a golden era in the sport,'' says the English mountain, ''and
I've enjoyed it all, even some of the bad times. I look forward to the
game with Scotland.''
After a gentle word as to Scott Hastings' well-being, with me having
to explain why he is not in the side, he was off to spend his weeekdays
behind the wheel of a fast police car on the motorways, and his weekends
crushing some of the best opponents in the world with a limp, but a
singular style of his own.
Dean Richards is a rare commodity indeed. Dean Richards is a dying
breed. Dean Richards is some rugby player.

SALLY Gunnell, the UK athletics team captain, had planned to defend
her status as Britain's 400 metres No.1 today at the Kelvin Hall against
the rising star of the sport, Melanie Neef, who has logged nine Scottish
record-breaking performances since the turn of the year.
Instead, Gunnell is nursing a heel injury, and Neef is left to put
Britain's best foot forward against France, taking all the pressure.
Typically, Gunnell has sent a message of encouragement, and even
concedes that on one count at least, Mel is better equipped to cope than
she was herself in the early stages of her career.
''I'm sorry not to be running,'' says Sally. ''I know Mel wanted me to
help her to a fast time, but she will run great. She handles pressure
far better than I did when I was starting out.''
It is hard to imagine Gunnell as anything other than Miss Cool. But
she is quick to recall 1986, and her European Championship debut: ''I'd
come straight from the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where I'd won
the 100m hurdles, to Stuttgart. I thought I had plenty of confidence,
until my first-round heat. There, in the next lane, was the world record
holder, Yordanka Donkova.
''I looked at her, and she seemed just about the biggest, toughest,
and butchest athlete I'd ever seen. Then I totally cracked up, for here
was this woman with no fingers -- she'd lost three in an accident. I
absolutely froze when we were going down on our blocks, and was knocked
out.
''But Mel has already shown how well she can cope. She was Britain's
only winner when she made her debut indoors against Russia last year.
And she ran brilliantly at the Europa Cup, both individually and in the
relay, and got to the European and Commonwealth finals. I know it must
have been frustrating for her not to dip under 52 seconds. But she
learned a lot at all these big championships,
''It will do Mel a lot of good to be the centre of attraction in front
of her own crowd. I know she won by miles last week (when she won the
AAA title). I hope she goes to the World championships -- she has a lot
of talent. It's just a question of keeping on working.''
Neef is quick to repay the compliment: ''Sally was really encouraging
last season. I was a nervous wreck, but she really put me at ease.''
Gunnell herself has been training as never before, spurred by the
spectre of a woman called Perec, and by the vision of broadening her
unique niche as Olympic, World, European and Commonwealth champion.
Only four other British women have ever won an Olympic title: Mary
Rand, Ann Packer, Mary Peters and Tessa Sanderson. None ever retained
it.
After a successful defence of her 400m hurdles title at this year's
World Championships in Gothenburg, Gunnell rates the Atlanta Olympic
crown as her next priority. Some believe she faces an impossible task.
Marie-Jose Perec, the French World and Olympic 400m champion, has a flat
400m speed more than two seconds better than Gunnell's, and Perec is
switching to the hurdles this year, with the avowed aim of tearing
Gunnell's record apart.
Gunnell, whose world hurdles mark stands at 52.74secs, says: ''I think
Perec feels that because of her flat speed, all she has to do is turn
out, and she'll run between 51 and 52 seconds. I think she is in for a
surprise.''
Even after eight years at the one-lap hurdles, Gunnell adds: ''There's
still a lot for me to learn -- and Perec is just starting. She's got to
work out how to adapt her stride pattern to the wind. You'd be surprised
how stressful learning the adjustment can be. She'll find out there more
to it than just jumping over a few sticks.''
It is a rare glimpse of the iron fist of the champion in the lavender
and lace of the Essex lady.
''Perec has always been at the back of my mind over the winter. I
always feel guilty if I miss a training session. Working out in the
rain, in rotten conditions, are the days that make you a champion, so I
don't often avoid them. But preparing to face her has given an extra
edge to my training. I avoided some of the winter by going to Pretoria
in mid-January. I wanted to try altitude for the first time, so there
was a lot of monitoring. We stayed at just under 6000 feet.''
But only for three weeks. ''I miss home, and I miss my cats -- Demi,
Chloe, and Poppy. Jon and I miss our friends. I'm not big on bars and
clubs, but I prefer a nice meal out, or entertaining a few friends at
home.''
Despite missing out today, Gunnell will be able to assess the effects
of her altitude experiment over the next two weeks. She plans a low-key
race in Germany on Wednesday, another in Sindelfingen, and an appearance
at the TSB Games in Birmingham. ''The heel problem is minor,'' she says.
''Missing Glasgow is just a precaution. I don't want to take any risks
in such an important year.
''Gothenburg, the World Championships, is the high of the year for me
-- retaining the title, and hopefully breaking the world record.
''The hardest thing is saying no -- to interview requests, personal
appearances, opening things. I try to restrict them to my rest day,
oherwise it interferes too much with training.''
The girl who used to deliver turkeys from the family farm is big
business now: children's TV, Avon cosmetics, modelling clothes,
aerobics, sports drinks, a sports bra. But she believes even more
uplifting triumphs are to come.

I will make you brooches and toys for your delight
Of bird song at morning and star-shine at night.
I will make a palace fit for you and me
Of green days in forest and blue days at sea . . . RLS
VALENTINE'S Day. Corny? Commercialism? Forget all that. February 14 is
not a day to celebrate cynicism.
Instead, it's one in which romance should wholeheartedly blossom, for
isn't it love that makes this funny old world go round?
Despite all the perceived -- and real -- changes in modern life, the
postie's arrival on February 14 can still be as eagerly awaited as it
was in grandma's day.
Writing, postmark, and messages are all closely scrutinised for clues
by the recipient, whose racing pulse is in considerable contrast to the
usual cool and in-control approach favoured by today's youth.
And talking of cards, they come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and
types from the cloyingly OTT to downright tasteless and everything else
in between.
Particularly lovely and sure to be kept for a long time to come are
the packs of three cards that open out into dainty, pretty fans
available from Past Times branches in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen.
The top of each fan is delicately shaped into a little heart, while
the lower part of the card carries the message A GIFT OF LOVE . . .
cupids and hearts, flowers or cameo pictures of couples provide the
decoration.
Different and sure to touch a heart or two, the pack costs #10.95 and
you put your own message on the back. When open, each card measures from
6in x 11in to 7in x 13in.
Having got the card arranged, the next thing is to decide on your
present. Flowers, as everyone knows, have a language all their own.
Little wonder, then, that Valentine's Day sees florists enjoying one
of their busiest days of the year.
There is something especially appealing and romantic about receiving a
gift of flowers in all their fresh and natural beauty; it's one
tradition that never goes out of fashion.
In similar vein is the perennial appeal of chocolates as a gift. Not
the thing to give your beloved if he or she is desperately fighting a
losing battle of the bulge, but for anyone else a welcome token that can
come in many imaginative and attractive guises.
Thorntons have all sorts of ideas, from single choccy hearts,
sometimes bearing romantic messages -- even ''Marry Me please'' for the
seriously coy suitor -- to heart-shaped boxes of extravagant temptation.
Picwicks in Edinburgh have unusual boxes, covered in material,
creating a dinner jacket and black tie, which can be filled to order
from a wicked range of Belgian chocolates.
A nice idea away from the usual roses and ribbons theme.
Very romantic, thoughtful, and totally acceptable to either sex is the
gift of an evening at a dinner dance. Even more so when it includes
overnight accommodation.
Here is the chance of a complete switch-off for a few magical hours,
to enjoy a meal against a background of music and an evening's dancing.
If you're staying over there's no need for the driver to stick to
mineral water all night, nor is there that spell-breaking moment when
you step out into icy temperatures at the end of it all.
Instead, there's a gentle ascent to a warm bedroom . . .
Aromatherapy products, which create a relaxed ambience, make a nice
present, especially in conjunction with a good tape, CD or video to
while away the evening a deux. Just the thing to set the scene for
romance.
Aromatherapy burners sprinkled with essential oil provide fragrant
room scents, or you could buy one of the lamp bulb burners that fit on
top of a bulb, the heat of which diffuses the oil. You'll find these in
lots of shops, including Crabtree &amp; Evelyn branches.
Cobra and Bellamy's latest jewellery collection includes a 22ct.
gold-plated necklace festooned with heart-shaped amber stones for #95,
or a pair of earrings -- made for the occasion -- featuring a 22ct.
gold-plated cherub, set with an amber cabochon heart.
At #101 they're not exactly a snip, but certainly something to value
and treasure for many years to come. Both are available from Frasers,
Glasgow.
Frasers also offer Michelson pure silk cravats for those times when
the man in your life favours a little informality while retaining a
sartorial elegance. In a variety of patterns, they cost from just under
#20.
For anyone who collects little boxes, there's an unusual circular one
on offer from Past Times in silver-plated pewter, with a background of a
Victorian floral pattern. Its focal point is the initial of your choice.
Good value at #12.95.
The same shops have what they call the Elizabeth Barrett Browning
ring. In gold-plated silver, and costing #45, its unusual hexagonal
setting holds an amethyst stone. The original is in the British Museum,
and is inscribed with its owners initials.
But what if you get to the point where time has run out -- or, dare
you admit, you forgot -- and you simply don't have the chance to browse
in the shops for inspiration?
You can, of course, always fall back on the faithful flowers,
chocolates, favourite perfume or after-shave; or you might like to nip
into the off-licence and select a really nice bottle of wine or
celebratory fizz to enjoy together.
Dash into Marks and Sparks in your lunch hour and you could go the
whole hog and buy a ready-made meal, and a bottle of wine, so that all
you need do is settle down to a romantic evening meal that has hassled
no-one in its preparation.
Here's to romance.

A leading Tory takes issue with his party's frantic flag waving when
confronted with devolution. Hugh Barnes reports
AWARNING that John Major is stirring up resentment against Scotland in
England has come from one of the Tory Party's most senior and respected
figures, Lord Gilmour of Craigmillar.
Gilmour believes that right-wing Conseratives in England tend to be
anti-Scottish, and that many of them would be pleased if Scotland left
the UK. He is worried that while John Major is trying to defend the
Union, by pandering to the right-wing in his party he may be in danger
of breaking it up.
Gilmour should be listened to because in the course of a long and
distinguished political career he has spoken and written about Tory
policy on devolution with a consistency and expertise often lacking in
his erstwhile Cabinet colleagues.
The former Sir Ian Gilmour, Mrs Thatcher's deputy foreign secretary
from 1979 to 1981 and thereafter a leading Tory Wet, owes a great deal
to his Scottish background. As a child, he spent family holidays at
Craigmillar Castle. Later he married Lady Caroline Margaret
Montagu-Douglas Scott, younger daughter of the 8th Duke of Buccleuch.
He takes issue with Major who recently characterised Scottish
devolution as ''a folly'' and ''teenage madness''. As he wrote in 1992:
''If a large majority of Scots want a Scottish parliament (which most of
the time they do) I have never been able to understand why the great
majority of the Conservative Party should nowadays be so determined to
frustrate them.''
Gilmour believes that John Major's frantic flag-waving bodes ill for
the quality of the debate about constitutional reform. ''I think that
Major's position of extreme centralisation in Britain and increasing
hostility to Europe is wrong on both counts, as well as being
inconsistent,'' he said. ''I've always been in favour of devolution,
even more now than I was in the 1960s, because Britain was nothing like
so centralised then.''
Lord Gilmour is at a loss to understand how the Prime Minister can
argue for subsidiarity in the European Union, yet argue against
devolution for Scotland. ''It's completely inconsistent,'' he goes on.
''The only consistent part is that he's trying rather irresponsibly to
gain votes by wrapping himself not in the Union Jack, but in the English
Jack. No, it's utterly inconsistent. A bit of subsidiarity at home is
obviously what this country needs.''
Unlike Tory policy, Gilmour's views on a Scottish parliament have
remained unchanged since 1969 when he argued for ''considerable
devolution'' in his book The Body Politic. In May of that year the party
leader, Ted Heath, proposed an elected Scottish assembly. Two years
later the party's constitutional committee, chaired by Sir Alec
Douglas-Home, also proposed a Scottish assembly. In October 1973 a royal
commission came out in favour of an elected assembly. At both 1974
elections the Conservative Party promised Scotland devolution.
After that, however, things ''started to go backwards'', as Gilmour
puts it. In Opposition, at the time of the Callaghan Government, Mrs
Thatcher reached the point where she believed she could abandon the
party's long-standing commitment to devolution.
''I offered my resignation to Mrs Thatcher from the Shadow Cabinet on
account of that Bill,'' he replied. ''And she very charmingly turned it
down.'' Why did he offer to resign? ''Because I was strongly in favour
of devolution, and I was on the record as being so, and I thought the
Conservative reversal was opportunistic and a mistake. And I didn't feel
able to vote against the Scottish Bill. Mrs Thatcher said: 'Oh no, you
can't possibly resign. I'll just arrange with the Chief Whip for you to
be away instead'.
''Of course, I did not know then what I know now, how Scotland would
suffer from the centralising of Thatcherism. You see, a vacuum was
created -- it was a gratuitous act of aggression to almost wreck local
government -- and I think one of the disappointments about John Major is
I thought he was going to change that and redress the balance. But he
hasn't done it at all really. The rhetoric is soft but, if anything, the
Government has been more dogmatic.''
Yet Gilmour understands that Mr Major is under pressure from both the
left and the right of his party, and that he is threading a narrow
passage between shoals on either side. A former chairman of the
Conservative Research Department, he merely quarrels with Major's style,
which is to accompany one or two steps to the right with another step,
usually a smaller one, to the left.
Was the Prime Minister playing a dangerous game by courting the
anti-Scottish, Eurosceptic right? ''I don't know because I don't know
what his motives are. But I think it's wrong as far as policy is
considered. I think it's wrong both ways. Both vis-a-vis Scotland and
England and vis-a-vis Europe. I think it's doubly wrong. But, as John
Major has drifted to the right more or less consistently since 1992, I
suppose he thinks it is the best way of uniting the party, but I think
it's a very expensive way of doing it.''
Expensive? In what way? ''From the point of view of British interests,
national interests. It's putting the party before the country. You see,
on the whole right-wing Conservatives tend to be anti-Scottish, partly,
I suppose, because Scotland tends to be left-wing.
''They are English nationalists who regard Scotland as a province.
They seem to be under the misapprehension that the Act of 1707 was an
Act of annexation by England and not an Act of Union between the two
countries. They are strictly speaking Little Englanders, not just in the
usual sense -- against Europe -- but also against Scotland.
''And that, of course, is one of the dangers of John Major's attitude.
He actually stirs up resentment against Scotland in England. Many
right-wing Conservatives would be pleased if Scotland left the UK.
''Many of the people who hold such a view are also 'anti-Europe' and
would themselves like to leave the European Union. So if they had their
way, Scotland would become a Belgium to England's Holland, though with
Scotland in the EU and England out of it. That, I suppose, would be the
ultimate in Little Englandism.''
I asked if he had a blueprint for what he had at various times called
''proper'' or ''considerable'' Scottish devolution. ''You know, I'm not
sure I didn't even produce a Bill -- it's probably somewhere but I
couldn't find it now. No, I wouldn't like to define it off the top of my
head. Obviously it would involve considerable powers of education,
health and so forth, and a limited taxation capacity.''
In other words, something not very far from what the Labour Party is
advocating at the moment?
''Yes, I think that's roughly about right,'' he said. ''Mind you,
that's more or less what the Conservative view used to be until they
abandoned it on rather opportunistic grounds in the mid-seventies.''

<HEADLINE>Forgers thought Scottish banknotes were easy money</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>13</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979911035</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THREE men forged Scottish banknotes with a face value of #75,000
because they were easier to counterfeit then English ones, Exeter Crown
Court was told yesterday.
Stephen Morris, Thomas Rogers, and Peter Todd, all from Torquay, and
who all admitted their part in the forgery, used laser printers and
ordinary cream paper to set up their counterfeiting business in
Scotland.
Morris was jailed for four years, Todd for 18 months, and Rogers was
sentenced to eight months.
They decided to make Scottish banknotes because they do not have a
metal strip in them. They were caught out by a sharp-eyed shop assistant
at Dunbar, East Lothian.
Mr Peter Ashman, prosecuting, said Morris, 36, was the ringleader and
he gave Rogers forged #20 notes with a face value of about #40,000.
Rogers told police he was ''just looking after it''.
Mr Ashman said: ''Fifteen to 18 serial numbers were attached to the
notes and they were made from laser printers and other printing works
worth #4000.
''Morris bought the equipment after selling his factory, with the
desire literally to make money. He admitted he was greedy and stupid.''
Miss Sarah Munro, defending Morris, said: ''I don't dispute for one
minute that this was a serious exercise and that Mr Morris is required
to be a skilful man to do it.
''But his interest was whether or not he could do it, without thinking
of where he could dispose of the currency.''
Miss Munro said it was the first time bachelor Morris had become
involved in a serious offence and his ''fall from grace'' came shortly
after the death of his brother.
The court heard Todd was arrested after trying to pass one of the
notes in a Spar shop at Dunbar when he tried to buy a packet of
cigarettes. The female shop assistant immediately thought it was
counterfeit.
The court heard Rogers, 46, a former coal miner, took part in the scam
only because his greengrocer's business failed and he started working
for Morris and needed to repay him a favour.
Mr Nicholas Ford, defending him, said: ''Rogers took a large quantity
of money on behalf of Morris. His one excursion north of the Border was
his downfall because the first two people who looked at the notes
complained about them. They were conspicuously useless.''
In jailing the gang, Judge Graham Neville said: ''You three men have
been involved in a very serious crime. Any counterfeiting, or taking
part in counterfeiting, must be punished and only custody can be
justified.''

John Major said that ''whatever happens during discussions'' on the
future of Northern Ireland at the end of the day it will be the people
who live there who will rightly have the last word about what happens to
their country (February 1).
Why not let them have the first word? Have a referendum now. Ask a
simple question: ''Do you want to stay within the United Kingdom or
not?''
The result will tell the Government what the people of Northern
Ireland want and give them a realistic starting point from which to
produce -- if they must -- future discussion documents based on reality
and not on government-inspired ideology.
In other words cut the cackle, ask the people, and act in accordance
with the result.

February 7.
Terry Lewis's Private Member's Bill (the Tobacco Products Labelling
Bill), which has its second reading in Parliament on February 17, seeks
to ensure that tobacco packaging is less attractive to young people and
that prominent health warnings covering at least 25% of the pack are
positioned at the top.
Health warning information is most likely to influence at least two
distinct groups -- people considering trying out smoking, eg children,
and established smokers contemplating giving up.
Scotland has an appalling record of tobacco-related disease. A total
of 10,000 people in our country die prematurely every year from the ill
effects of smoking.
The Governments in Canada and Australia have recently introduced
tougher health warnings on cigarette packets. South Africa is ready to
follow this example. For the Lewis Bill to succeed, MPs from all parties
need to attend the debate on February 17 and give it their widespread
support.

EVEN the mention of his name is inclined induce a state similar to
apoplexy in many boardrooms around the country. For a wee man, Bill
McMurdo seems to cause big trouble.
As the first footballers' agent to make his presence felt in this
country, his advent on the scene was never likely to be greeted with
flag waving by the establishment which was, and remains, suspicious of
outside traders.
But McMurdo has engendered such controversy in the 17 years he has
been in this business that there is virtually no-one closely involved in
the game who has indifferent feelings about his interventions.
If there ever was a man who has managed to provoke angry reaction,
this one-time sales director of Timex is the one.
Since he became the first agent in Scotland to look after footballers'
contracts (''maybe the first in the UK''), when Derek Johnston was his
original client, he has built an empire of players, from juniors to
leading lights, has become a constant protagonist for chairmen,
managers, and many of us who observe from outside the centre circle.
The impression you might gather from speaking to the nattily dressed
former Hibernian player is that he rather enjoys the notoriety. He did
not say as much, but it is hard to avoid the suspicion that a good
barney which gets his name and those of his players in the papers is no
bad deal. Projecting his clients, none of whom, he will tell you
proudly, has ever had a contract with him, is the name of his game.
In the process of establishing the right to have an agent's place in
football, McMurdo was always liable to fall out with the directors and
managers who, until his arrival, dealt directly with their own players.
Resentment at his interventions, especially when he would inevitably
hoist the basic values to levels the clubs would have prefered to avoid,
was bound to be rife.
He has had spectacular and public fall-outs, instanced currently by
the open slanging match being conducted between him and Hearts manager
Tommy McLean, climaxed last week by McMurdo's declaration that he would
like to think he would ''never have to deal with a McLean again.''
That typically abrasive remark, which immediately condemned Tommy's
big brother, Jim, as well, is not thrown in during a fit of anger.
In fact, he claims that he never shouts, never screams, and never
loses his temper in negotiations. ''I am actually a quiet person,'' he
says without a semblance of a blush.
''In fact, John Robertson, of Hearts, only recently asked me why I
never get loud or rant when I am involved in these things. I told him it
is not in the player's best interests to do that.''
Wasn't his remark about McLean deliberately aggressive, none the less?
''Yes, and I will tell you why. I have played by the book all the way
down the line with Jim McLean and Tommy McLean for a number of years
now. They have got to the stage where they have pushed me to the limit
by their treatment of certain players.
''There comes a time when you have got to say: enough is enough, do
away with the niceties and go for it.''
''I don't believe there should be option clauses. There is no need for
them under freedom of contract. And the way Tommy McLean has gone about
certain things in relation to Maurice Johnston, Jim Weir, and Nicky
Walker, I feel I had a duty to go public on that issue.''
''I have been the one who has held out the olive branch and advised
players never to say never but there comes a time when you have to call
a halt. I won't cow-tow to anybody.''
McMurdo, who is one of three businesmen involved in an intriguing new
scheme to invite investment in the future of young Scottish players,
would tell you that if there is opposition to the innovative proposal,
it will be no surprise.
''I was involved when Hibs were the first team in Britain to wear a
sponsor's name on shirts. They were fined and we were told it would
never happen.
''I was the first person in Scotland to introduce family enclosures,
sponsored by Panini, which were to spread throughout the country.
''At that time with Hearts I was responsible for their kit sponsor,
jersey sponsor, and enclosure sponsor.
''I was first to oppose option clauses, first to organise the lottery
for the SFA and its Hampden cause. I was also one of the first to
introduce game sponsorship in Scotland, to Hibs and Airdrie.
''Now, it is commonplace. I worked with Hugh Adam, of Rangers Pools,
to introduce corporate hospitality into this country.''
He will, he says, expect knockers of the new investment company's
propositions but, perversely enough, imagines that would be a sign that
it will succeed.
George Best, when he was with Hibs, was one of his first clients, and
he now has 50 players from all over the UK, Europe, and America.
His most notorious escapade, even if he claims to have had only a
minor role, will always be considered the transfer of Maurice Johnston
to Rangers two months after he had been paraded at Celtic Park as a
returning hero.
McMurdo will ever insist that the transfer to Celtic might well have
gone through if he had been involved. ''As it was, Celtic did not want
to deal with me and it was through a letter I told Maurice to give to
Chris White that I had to let them know that for contractual reasons he
could not sign for Celtic, or anybody else, at that time.
Unfortunately, Celtic went ahead with the press conference and Maurice
got caught up in the euphoria of it all, which he regrets now.
''The Rangers deal came about weeks later but the truth is I did not
want Maurice to sign for any British team at that time. I would have
preferred him to stay abroad for a few more years.''
It is an explanation he insists is the way it was but many thousands
will never accept it as the whole truth.
Either way, the McMurdo business will continue to flourish and Celtic
players will continue to join his empire.
The fact that he is a committed Rangers fan has never prevented him
representing Parkhead players in the past and will not in the future.
Pressed on how powerful are his Ibrox emotions, he replied: ''I am a
royalist more than a Rangers supporter'' a statement given credence by
the large picture of The Queen which is the centrepiece of a lounge wall
at home.
His Hibs career was cut short by injury but he retains a soft spot for
them and had a long association with Hearts under Wallace Mercer.
The current chairman, Chris Robinson, who has fallen out with McMurdo
(the latest in a long line) may take comfort in the knowledge that
Mercer, too, had many a row over the 12 years he knew and dealt with the
agent.
''I had a great respect for Wallace and what he did for Hearts and the
game in general but we had our rammies. I remember once he shouted at me
and barred me from Tynecastle for ever. The same night he phoned me to
say: 'There will be two comps for the game tomorrow in your name at the
door, but don't say I left them.' ''
McMurdo has applied to the SFA for the FIFA agent's licence which, in
future, will be required to deal in direct transfer negotiations but
with great reluctance.
''I have only done it for the sake of my players but I believe the
whole thing is a restriction in trade and I am sure I could win any
court case to prove it. I don't want to compromise the players but if it
was down to me alone I would take them to court tomorrow.''
For other agents, the necessity to be in at the sharp end of
negotiations may not be vital but for McMurdo it is imperative. His
strength, whether clubs like it or not, is his ability to get the best
for his players, otherwise they would not be on his books for long. He
claims that most managers and chairmen dispense with the waffle once
they know he is involved ''and get down to the nitty gritty.''
The man who, unquestionably, is the most controversial figure of his
kind in the game revels in the cut and thrust of debate, holds strong
views, and is inclined to put them forward in confrontational style.
He will not worry about it, but he is never going to be the best-loved
wee man in the game.
''I get a good living and I love my work but I think my contribution
to football has been a lot greater than people would give me credit for
''My job is to market the game and to do that properly you have to
look after the main players, the footballers.
''Without them you don't have a game.'' Even he would be hard pushed
to provoke a row with that observation. But don't bank on it.

Reading your report that 999 calls to British Gas are to be dealt with

THE wonderful expression ''Close encounters of the third kind'' was
coined by Dr J Allen Hynek, scientific adviser to Project Blue Book,
which was the US military's attempt to make some sense of the phenomenon
of unidentified flying objects (or UFOs). The first two categories were
sightings at a distance and observation of a UFO at close quarters. The
third was close contact with UFO crew members in or outside the object.
These ranged from abductions to episodes in which the occupants of the
object probed the anatomy of humans and in some cases had sex with them.
The Hynek and Condon reports appeared 25 years ago and were far from
conclusive. They certainly did not stop the phenomena which, even the
sceptics had to agree, could not all be written off as delusion or
fraud. In 1980, close encounters of the third kind were the subject of a
blockbuster movie, which was followed by the magical ET. Aliens were
portrayed as being rather more friendly towards earthlings than in the
days of Quatermass and The Midwich Cuckoos in the fifties, when the
response of bewildered spectators was either to take to their heels or
call up the tanks.
Why I am telling you all this? Well, the first reason is that at
midnight on Thursday I took part in a Radio 5 live discussion on the
matter in the Night Moves programme. Guests included sceptic Steuart
Campbell, who used to think UFO sightings were mostly a natural but
little known phenomenon called ball lightning, but is now more inclined
to put them down to reflections caused by temperature inversions in the
atmosphere.
Ranged against him were Gloria Dixon of the amateur research body
Bufora and Graham Campbell, an ex-BA pilot who had spotted two UFOs
during his flying career.
My role was somewhere in the middle -- neither expert, believer, nor
sceptic, pointing out that many of the UFO stories have echoes of devils
and demons reported in the late Middle Ages and that they parallel many
other areas of the paranormal such as apparitions and near-death
experiences. Many of these refer to ''beings of light'' and fast-moving
shapes, and seeing figures which seem to beckon them into a tunnel.
I tried to argue that as well as the mundane explanation of mistakes
caused by meteorology, or the exotic hypothesis of aliens who are using
superior technology, there is a third possibility -- that UFOs may be
intrusions from another dimension parallel to our own but sculpted in
the culture and technology of our myths and fears. While this
metaphysical debate was raging, on the line came Councillor Billy
Buchanan from Bonnybridge, which appears to be to UFO appearances what
the Bermuda Triangle is to disappearances.
In all shapes and sizes they have come -- cigars, saucers, and
Toblerone-shaped bars. His intervention reminded me that more than a
decade ago I had twice covered UFO encounters of the second kind and
they were both in the ''Bonnybridge Triangle''. Apparently things are
even hotter these days.
But what worried Councillor Buchanan was official indifference to
these incidents. He was not alleging cover-up but intends to try to
bring the Bonnybridge phenomena to the attention of the Prime Minister
so that an official investigation can be mounted. The problem is that
the military has lost interest since there is no longer any fears that
UFOs pose a strategic threat. Perhaps funding for an investigation could
be placed within the University of Stirling? It's a thought.
What impressed me about the calls to the programme the other night
were the number of sane, articulate witnesses who had not shared their
sighting with anyone until prompted to do so by the programme. To write
them all off as deluded or pranksters just did not fit the facts.
Attempts to give natural explanations are often more implausible and
convoluted than the UFO hypothesis. So what should be done?
There is no doubt that a Freedom of Information Act would help to make
available some more interesting material by opening up official files.
It is ridiculous that we still cannot read about the interrogation of
Sir Oswald Moseley during the Second World War because the files are
deemed too sensitive. Equally, it is absurd that officialdom can seal
information about UFO sightings which can have no further military
relevance.
The problem is that we will probably never reach a conclusion on the
matter. ''Some say it thundered -- others say an angel spoke'' is the
Bible's way of saying that there will always be ambiguity about such
matters. Heavenly messengers; superior beings; weather conditions; ball
lightning; lack of oxygen to the brain; schizophrenia. These are but a
few of the totally contradictory hypotheses which are advanced to
explain UFOs. But because the area is riddled with sceptics and
credulous flat-earthers, it does not mean we should not keep an open
mind.
Perhaps the Bonnybridge Triangle could be set up as a rival tourist
destination to the Trossachs and Loch Lomond, a sort of saucer safari in
which coaches packed with little yellow men with Nikons round their
necks could run around making squealing noises and photographing the
little green men. Yes, we should not take it too seriously, but to
ignore it completely seems even more bizarre than the UFOs themselves.

HOW do PEPs compare with personal pensions? Investigation reveals that
it is not enough to compare tax relief. Comparative costs go much
deeper.
There is no doubt that an advantage of a pension fund is that you get
tax relief at the time you put the money into the fund. So, if you
happen to be a 40% taxpayer, this means that for every #100 it only
costs you #60. Your money then accumulates inside the fund but when you
take your money out you must pay tax. So, if you are likely to be a 25%
taxpayer near to and on retiral, then that is good news.
On the other hand tax rates can also go up during the duration of a
personal pension and in that case this is not so good.
The main problem with a pension fund is that having put your money in,
you cannot take it out. With a PEP, however, it is exactly the other way
around, but the benefit can be identical.
You do not get tax relief on money going into a PEP but when it comes
out it is tax free. In the meantime the money accumulates tax free.
David Hume, pensions expert with fund manager Stewart Ivory, said that
on comparing the two forms of saving, the PEPs does represent the best
deal because an individual retains a flexibility in using his/her money
now, rather than having to wait until retiral. Tax benefits overall are
equal.
Another point to remember is that pensions are much more complicated
to administer than PEPs and as a consequence, charges tend to be greater
and are much more difficult to understand.
If a person sets up a personal self-administered personal pension,
costs will be significantly more than a self-select PEP.
So overall, it is not enough to think of tax relief solely. Taking
into account other hidden charges may persuade an individual to go the
PEPs road.
David Noblett, a director with Aitchison and Colegrave, warned: ''Do
not let the tax tail wag the dog.'' Said on many occasions over the
years, letting this happen has perhaps been instrumental in taking
decisions related to whether tax benefits attached to personal pensions
outweigh the flexibility of investing in PEPs.
''Yes, both forms of investments enjoy tax-free growth but the main
difference is how and when the benefits may be taken by the investor,''
he said.
It was true that personal pensions had an initial tax advantage, in
that tax relief, to certain limits, was available on the contributions;
with waiver of contributions able to be incorporated to ensure that in
the event of incapacity, at least the pension contributions would
continue to be paid up until selected retirement.
''The price to pay for the tax benefits is perhaps the loss of
flexibility, to control how and when benefits may be taken,'' Mr Noblett
added, although proposed changes in the Budget will allow personal
pensions some additional flexibility.
Suffice to say that where possible, advantage should be taken of both
personal pensions and PEPs with a view to achieving a balanced
portfolio.
In cases where a decision has to be taken on one or the other, then
the fundamentals to consider are tax rates, access to capital and the
length of time to planned retirement.
It appears that in terms of flexibility PEPs have the edge.

FEW of us, when young, do not toy with the idea of becoming an Olympic
champion. During the winter months, perhaps enjoying an extra hour in
bed, it is interesting to consider which sport to choose. Many of them,
like running and jumping, or throwing things, do seem to involve a great
deal of physical effort. Also, what with television cameras everywhere,
there is the risk of dropping a baton, or being trodden on by other
athletes, and suffering public embarrassment. Other sports, like
wrestling and boxing, seem to be unnecessarily combative and have an
obvious risk of pain and disfigurement. Equestrian events are also
dangerous, and buying a suitable horse might be expensive, even a
second-hand one. Yachting is a possibility. When the Olympics are all
over, we think, we could use the boat to go camping.
By this time, alas, we have dozed off again, and it is not long before
another four years have passed. In no time at all, it seems, the
opportunity has passed. We are too old. ''There was a time when I nearly
took up pistol shooting quite seriously,'' we say. ''The Olympics, you
know. But it wasn't to be.'' Indeed not. We did not even buy a gun. Even
for casual conversation, however, the choice of sport has to be careful.
At the Commonwealth Games at Edinburgh in 1970, William Pattimore was
bowling for Wales at the age of 78, and Hilda Johnstone was a British
dressage Olympian when she was 70.
For would-be sportsmen who like to dream of a really geriatric gold
medal, there is fresh hope with the news that the World Bridge
Federation has applied for Olympic recognition. A minimum period of
seven years now has to elapse, but if the International Olympic
Committee agrees, there could be medal ceremonies for bridge players by
the 2004 games, possibly to be held in China. By that time Omar Sharif,
one of the world's leading players, will still only be 73. It seems a
long way to go for a game of cards. It is also a long time to wait for a
medal, although this is less of a problem. First we must learn how to
play.

A DISTINGUISHED American historian wrote that poverty was an idea
which had to be invented. Until it was, towards the end of the last
century, little attention was focused on it and few steps were taken to
combat it by collective provision. Its direct alleviation had, however,
attracted some collective effort since the 1830s. More direct public
focus followed later using, first, the agency of the state education
system and then the more direct instruments of national insurance, from
1911, and unemployment benefit, from the 1920s. These efforts stemmed
partly from the social investigations of late Victorian and Edwardian
reformers. (Joseph Rowntree, whose trust provided the impetus and
finance for this week's study, was one of these pioneers.) The reformers
called into being a concerned public opinion which began to challenge
the existence of a distinct social blight. That the phenomenon was
relative as well as absolute was a later development of which there was
little awareness before W G Runciman published his influential Relative
Deprivation and Social Justice at the end of the 1950s. Since then the
concepts of absolute and relative poverty have tended to fuse. The first
can theoretically be eliminated, but the second has a dynamic quality
since its definition is, usually, directly related to average earnings
which have tended to rise annually, as have most state benefits, since
1945 -- although they have sometimes been eroded savagely by inflation.
Social welfare is the biggest single item in the state budget,
especially when its elements in health and educational spending are
remembered. The Shadow Chancellor admitted in a speech yesterday that
this route to poverty's amelioration would not eliminate it. Indeed more
generous state provision exacerbates some related problems, such as the
''poverty trap'' whereby benefits reduce the incentive to seek
employment because their withdrawal in the face of earnings produces a
clawback equal to as much as an 80% marginal tax rate. That is not
tolerable, but it is easier to say that than devise workable methods for
avoiding it. Liberal notions of a negative income tax need more
consideration, though many have become pessimistic about them. Minimum
wage legislation might deal with part of the problem, low earnings,
though US experience shows that poverty persists alongside minimum
wages.
What Rowntree's own first investigations show is the importance of
earnings and hence employment. The present position is greatly worsened
by mass unemployment. This is now falling fast from very high levels,
but it seems likely to bottom at levels which would have been
unthinkable a generation ago. Job creation remains the best way to
tackle basic poverty. Training and skill provision gets everyone's vote
as well, though enhanced productivity is the target there. The
trickle-down theory may not have worked, but it should be made to work
-- and fiscal instruments are needed to make it do so. Inequality is not
so easily modified unless taxation is, again, to be exploited for social
engineering. It seems to be the case that additional marginal taxation
delivers little additional revenue; but it might reduce the popular
sense of outrage that excessive salaries have stimulated.
Are there votes in this, or will the affluent majority ignore what is
an affront to social cohesion as well as compassion? The price of
ignoring the poor is to leave them isolated, bewildered, resentful, and
violent; but it is also to diminish everyone else. ''Brothers one of
another'' is a biblical sentiment; it remains the right guide for
inspiring action on this front.

UNTIL last August, the two Craigs, Craig Brown and Craig Smith, were
senior surveyors in one of the larger Scottish firms of property
consultants. They had started within two months of each other and had
both clocked up their first five years with the firm.
While technically senior surveyors, neither man remembers the last
time he did a straight property survey. Craig Brown trained at Glasgow
School of Art in planning and design. Craig Smith had worked for a
period with an architectural practice. Both men specialised in designing
refurbishments of existing buildings.
On August 12, in quick succession, they were sacked, following
conflicts with new senior staff who had moved into the firm. ''It was,''
says Smith, ''a real kick in the backside. Losing the company car was
like having your leg sawn off. But it was also the best thing that ever
happened to us.''
Like many of their contemporaries grappling with the enterprise
culture, the pair had been contemplating setting up their own business.
Now that dream had a much more imperative tinge to it. Within weeks, and
with a little help from Glasgow Opportunities, the Greystone Partnership
was born. The first word in their new name, they confide with
mischievous smiles, came from a linoleum sample lying on one of their
desks.
Setting up a vehicle is one thing. Drumming up custom, as many a
fledgling start-up will tell you, is quite another, even in a people
business such as property. But Greystone was only two days old when they
took a call from a well-known English project management firm about a
major contract refurbishing government buildings in Whitehall.
Brown and Smith focus on the common areas of office blocks, the
lobbies, stairs, lifts, toilets and other parts which remain the
responsibility of the landlord. ''A lot of designs for these areas are
very simplistic,'' says Smith. ''We recognise all the problems of
functionality and maintenance. But we also like to take the time to add
a wee bit of magic to our designs, the distinctive details that get them
noticed.''
''The contact about the Whitehall contract,'' adds Brown, ''was made
on the basis of the quality of other work we had done, on our
reputation.'' In fact, the person who had suggested them for the task
was someone Smith had once done battle with it. But that hadn't blinded
him to the pair's flair.
The upshot has been that since October, Smith and Brown have been
taking turns to spend two weeks at a time in London, supervising the
translation of their designs into finished reality by contractors.
''It's a noticeably different marketplace,'' says Brown. ''In central
London just now there's scaffolding all over the place.''
Does that mean they are planning a permanent move south? Far from it.
They know the Glasgow property scene like the back of their hands and
have ambitious plans to expand. The obvious first step is to pick up
more contracts like the blue-chip assignment they are now well on the
way to completing.
The next move would be to expand from simply designing and project
managing refurbishment schemes in office blocks, to take on the main
contracting role themselves. ''That could happen quite quickly,'' says
Brown. ''We will target owners and managers of buildings with a complete
design and build concept for upgrading their common areas.''
The pair also want to get into leisure developments, which they see as
a prime target for expansion. Everyone has more leisure, argues Smith,
but there is still a great lack of facilities, particularly in the
middle market between local authority provision and luxury private
clubs.
Getting kicked out of a job is no fun. But with flair, reputation,
some sheer luck and a dash of enthusiasm, it need not be the end of the
world. Ask the two Craigs, Brown and Smith. ''A director of a surveying
firm in Glasgow can make so much money,'' reflects Brown, ''but being
your own boss, who knows what the limits are?''

Your coverage of Greater Glasgow Health Board's purchasing intentions
for acute services, set out in the document Purchasing Acute Services to
2001: a Consultation Document, appears to have been very low key.
The proposed closure of Rutherglen Maternity Hospital, which serves a
catchment area of a quarter of a million people, would mean that
maternity services would be based at the Queen Mother's Hospital, the
Southern General Hospital, and a new unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
It would appear that the board's argument for closure is the saving of
#5m per year and that maternity hospitals should be located on site with
acute general hospitals. This would enable mothers who developed
complications post-delivery to have a full range of clinical supporting
facilities routinely found on such sites.
As far as I am aware, if such a situation arose, mothers in any of the
present maternity hospitals would need to be transported by ambulance to
an intensive therapy unit.
The closure of Rutherglen Maternity would affect the lives of
thousands of people across the south-east of Glasgow and East Kilbride
who campaigned more than 15 years ago for a local maternity hospital.
Women and their families will be expected to travel to the Southern
General or the Queen Mother's hospitals, or to the Royal Infirmary,
causing financial hardship and discomfort travelling on public
transport, time wasted travelling across the city on congested roads,
increased stress levels when a parking space cannot be found.
Rutherglen Maternity has proved to be an asset to the community with a
record equal to any. My personal experience is of a very dedicated
staff. X-ray and physiotherapy facilities are available for use by local
people through GP referral.
I see from your reports that public opinion saved the accident and
emergency services at Ayr Hospital. Hopefully the GGHB will take
cognisance of public opinion against the closure of Rutherglen
Maternity, good sense will prevail and confidence in the drcision-makers
at the GGHB will be restored.

LLOYDS Bank has again underlined that it is the most dependable of the
British banks with 1994 pre-tax profits rising 26% to #1304m accompanied
by a 17% increase in the dividend total to 25.8p.
That means that in the last decade #100 invested in Lloyds shares as
from the beginning of 1985 would have seen a total return of #565.50,
made up of #137.50 of net dividends and a capital gain of #428 in
addition to the original stake.
Other banks such as Barclays will show more dramatic profit
improvements over the next few weeks but from a much lower base and they
have all asked shareholders for funds through rights issues and so
provided a negative income flow.
Chairman Sir Robin Ibbs was happy to sound off that people do not
understand bank profits and that while they may seem large, the return
on assets is below that of most other industries. He denied that Lloyds
is exploiting personal customers and small businesses and in fact had
reduced many charges. What the banks need to do is to sustain profits
over a period as investors are spurning the sector at present, he added.
But Sir Robin, and his peers, have a major problem.
Investor perception of banks is that the quality of earnings is low
and volatile and there is always the apparent risk that whenever lending
demand does pick up, money will be poured into high-risk sectors such as
property. The banks have done it in the past, time and time again, and
why should the pattern change even if the banks argue that their credit
assessment now takes account of inflation being unlikely to come to the
rescue as has been the case since 1945.
There was some encouragement yesterday that the merger with the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society will still leave Lloyds well
heeled despite disbursing #1800m this August. The House of Commons has
now passed the ''widows'' bill which will now entitle 5000 widows and
widowers of first-named C&amp;G account holders to benefit from the merger.
The most buoyant part of Lloyds' UK business was mortgage lending
which rose 21% to #1700m to leave the book at #7200m compared with C&amp;G's
42% advance in loans to #3075m. Although personal and small business
lending appears to be picking up, it still remains disturbingly flat as
does commercial business where margins on large corporate loans in
particular are paper thin.
The impetus came partly from an improvement in the bad-debt
provisioning where there was a #99m reduction in the UK activities to
#325m. Chief executive Sir Brian Pitman expressed concern over the high
levels of provisioning still required on tertiary property where there
are no buyers for miles around and the only value is probably that of
the site.
The preceding year also carried some #70m of general provisioning,
while 1994 benefited from a #30m profit on the part sale of the holding
of 3i. There was also an extra #60m put aside against the problems at
Lloyds Abbey Life on the mis-selling of pensions.
UK net interest margins widened slightly from 3.87% to 4% because of
an increase in spread. Rising interest-free accounts and average base
rates in 1995 probably exceeding those of last year -- Lloyds is not
quite as anxious as the TSB to persuade customers to move to
higher-yielding accounts -- should help to improve overall UK margins
for the current year.
Lloyds was pummelled hard five years ago by its problems with
developing country debt. But now it is in the happy position that most
countries in its portfolio have so improved that it is able yet again to
write back some of these debts with an additional #68m going into
profits at #328m or a quarter of the total.
However, that does not speak too highly of the quality of future
earnings even if Mexico has had little impact on Lloyds where the major
exposures are to Brazil where there is a new president and Argentina
where elections are due in May and bankers to a man are hoping that
stability is maintained.
More negatively the increase in US interest rates hit bond-dealing
profits badly with the surplus falling from #204m to just #66m with a
mere #14m contribution in the second half of last year. And the
prospects this time round are again for a muted performance on this
score with global interest rates likely to rise further and so hitting
fixed interest stocks.
The C&amp;G acquisition does underpin earnings quality and should help
Lloyds' current year profits advance to about #1650m.
The shares now yield 5.75% at 560p and are about the highest in the
sector.

FARMERS have been enjoying a holiday in terms of fertiliser prices
over the past few years, but this is coming to an end, according to the
Fertiliser Manufacturers Association.
Prices slumped by 25% in the decade to last year, but are now showing
a strong recovery, with a #5 per tonne increase in the past three
months.
The world price of nitrogen has escalated in recent months, and
ammonia -- a key component of fertilisers -- has doubled in price in the
past year, with urea not far behind.
This has resulted from two competing trends. Firstly, a rise in world
demand -- particularly from the Far East -- and secondly,
rationalisation of European plant, resulting in a loss of some
10,000,000 tonnes production capacity annually. To put this in
perspective, total UK demand is about 5,500,000 tonnes.
According to Mr Barry Higgs, director general of the association, this
has been aggravated by two further events -- moves by former Soviets to
start charging for gas at real commercial rates, and increased demand
from US farmers to replace fertilisers leached out by recent floods.
''There is no doubt that farmers have been on a bit of a holiday as
far as fertiliser prices are concerned. But clearly they are going to
have to come back to reality,'' he said.
The fight by the association to end fertiliser dumping has had little
impact on the upward trend, as imports from both alleged dumpers and
non-dumpers have continued to operate at previous levels.
''The end result is that we have already passed the bottom of the
supply-demand cycle,'' said Mr Higgs.
Mr Dick Davies, commercial manager of Kemira, agrees. ''We have seen a
lot of price increases coming through, and the price of the end product
is about #15 per tonne up on the year. We issued new prices around #130
a tonne for straight fertiliser two weeks ago.''
Growth in markets in both the Far East and South America have boosted
demand against a contracting manufacturing base. This, and tight margins
all round, have axed stocks at factories from a month's market supply to
about one week.
Ms Rosie Carne, marketing services manager with world leader Hydro
Agriculture, said the company had stopped taking orders for NPK
fertilisers for the current season, although the Immingham plant on
Humberside was still producing about 2000 tonnes a day straights.

TEENAGE entrepreneurs at St Andrew's Academy in Paisley are selling
boxes of fresh air. The school's Young Enterprise company, Beezer, has
packaged the air as a Valentine's Day gift.
Beezer marketing director 17-year-old Pauline Graham says the
attraction is the novelty value of the colourfully wrapped box, and the
message which reads:
This is a very special gift that you can never see.
The reason it's so special is it's just to you from me.
Whenever you are lonely, or ever feeling blue,
You only have to hold this gift and know I think of you.
You never can unwrap it, please leave the ribbon tied.
Just hold this box close to your heart, it's filled with love inside.
I just hope that the recipients take time to read the message,
otherwise the givers might find themselves the targets of some hot air!
Glasgow gets set
for congress
DAVID Oji, president of the Junior Chamber International, flies into
Glasgow today to have a first-hand look at the facilities being provided
for the Junior Chamber's World Congress being held in the city from
November 4-11.
Around 4500 delegates from 80 countries are expected to attend, and
already 2000 rooms have been booked by the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board
and Convention Bureau, which is acting as accommodation agent for the
event.
During his visit, Mr Oji, who runs a restaurant and retail/wholesale
clothing business in Yokohama, will be popping into tailor A Crawford &amp;
Sons to be measured for a tartan jacket so he looks the part when
chairing the congress.
He will also visit the Royal Concert Hall and the city's art
galleries.
The 50th Junior Chamber International World Congress will certainly be
a money spinner for many local businesses.
It has been estimated the delegates will spend in the region of #5m
during their stay in Scotland.
The largest delegation looks like being the 1200 Japanese members,
which should at least mean a booming trade in film for camera shops.
Having a ball
for a good cause
THE Marie Curie Daffodil Ball on March 11 is a sell out as far as the
#45 tickets are concerned. All 700 for the event to be held in the
Glasgow Hilton Hotel have been sold. Indeed, there is a waiting list of
100, but the charity has a shortfall in sponsorship.
It urgently needs sponsors to ensure the money raised from the ball
goes towards helping the cancer patients at Hunter's Hill Hospice in
Springburn, Glasgow.
If you would like details of the sponsorship package, give Maureen
Marshall a call on 0141 558 5442.
Atomic countdown
fails to add up
WHEN is a majority not a majority? Answer: when it is used in a press
release to show public support for atomic power.
A release from Scottish Nuclear crossed over my desk and I spotted the
headline: ''New Mori research reveals majority of Scots support nuclear
power''.
This fact certainly caught my attention, as no doubt it was meant to,
but as I glanced down I came to the crucial paragraph. It read:
''When asked: 'Should nuclear power continue to supply a proportion of
Scotland's electricity?' a total of 44% of Scots either agreed or
strongly agreed, compared to 33% who disagreed or strongly disagreed.
''Fifteen per cent remain to be convinced, neither agreeing nor
disagreeing, and the remaining 7% said they did not know.''
Maths was never my strong point, but even I know that 44% is not a
majority. It would have been more accurate to say more Scots support
nuclear power than are against it.
The release went on to state that the proportion of people in favour
of a continued role for nuclear power is even higher in the communities
which have become familiar with nuclear power stations, such as at
Torness in East Lothian and Hunterston in Ayrshire. There two residents
in three (65%) support the industry.
I could not help wondering when I read this information how many
people in these localities the industry supports, which may go some way
to explaining this higher than usual figure.
Personally, I am agnostic when it comes to the issue. I agree with
Scottish Nuclear's communications manager Irene Currie who commented:
''This new and independent research proves that people want the facts .
. .''
Anyone fancy a
trip to China?
THE Glasgow Chamber of Commerce is still looking for at least three
companies to join it on a trade mission to China from April 30 to May
10.
Seven Scottish firms have already signed up for the visit, which will
be led by Geoff Runcie, chief executive of the chamber, but 10 are
required before it can receive Government financial support.
The mission will travel to Glasgow's twin city of Dalian in North-east
China as well as Beijing and Tjanjin.
So far the companies who have agreed to go cover a wide range of
activities from selling school blackboards to fish.
The chamber needs to find the three additional companies by the end of
this month to ensure the mission goes ahead.

SIX quarries in Central Scotland are included in a package of 16 being
bought by George Wimpey from Alfred McAlpine for #43.5m.
Wimpey already has five quarries in the same area and others in the
Highlands and the group expects to achieve savings of some #1m from
rationalising administration and support services.
Finance director Richard Saville said there would be some job losses
among the 100 or so people employed by the Scottish McAlpine quarries in
these functions, but the number had not yet been determined. Production
staff will not be affected.
The purchase will place Wimpey in second place behind Tarmac in the
Scottish market for quarry products. The plants being acquired produce
limestone, sand and gravel. Also included are two stone-coating plants
in Scotland.
About a quarter of the output goes to roadbuilding, a quarter to
housebuilding and the balance to general contracting.
The 16 McAlpine quarries being acquired in total will add an aggregate
4,500,000 tonnes of dry stone to Wimpey Minerals' existing output of 12
million, placing it fifth in the national market. It will be number four
in coated stone. The other quarries are in Wales.
Wimpey chief executive Joe Dwyer said he was confident that the
acquisition would at least cover the interest and rationalisation costs
associated with the purchase.
In the year to October 1993, the McAlpine business made operating
profits of #1m on sales of #24m and is currently trading well in an
improved aggregate market.
McAlpine said it was selling because the business was small and
vulnerable to major changes in demand. The money will more than
eliminate group debt of #30m and the deal is expected to be earnings
neutral.
The group warned that its construction division was affected by poor
margins, with no improvement in its markets in sight. But housing is
performing better with results in the 14 months to December ahead of
budget, achieving 1828 completions at an average selling price of
#90,000. Slate products are trading strongly.
McAlpine shares rose 1p to 164p.

EUROTUNNEL has some relatively good news to report for a change to its
long-suffering shareholders who have seen the company's forecasts
progressively downgraded.
The group said yesterday that its 1994 revenue came to #30.6m, well
short of the #36m hoped for last October. But cash in hand was only #11m
adrift of the forecast in the May rights issue prospectus, against #50m
considered likely in October.
In fact, Eurotunnel believes the revenue forecast would have been at
least met but for a disagreement with British Rail and SNCF, the French
railways. They maintain they were not required to pay full charges for
using the tunnel before the commencement date of their second service in
November, which was the Eurostar passenger services to Paris and
Brussels.
The first service was freight, which begun in June and is now up to
the initial target of 1000 trucks a day. This dispute with the railways
is likely to be settled through arbitration.
In addition to the revenue figure stated, Eurotunnel also received
#10.6m of ''minimum usage'' charges, which are levied until such time as
the cumulative actual tolls exceed the sum of these monthly charges.
At the end of December the group had about #300m remaining from the
1994 rights issue and #697m available from the senior debt put in place
last May. This will start to be drawn down in the second quarter of
1995.
The latest revenue figure was only released to comply with the
requirements of the Paris Bourse and the full 1994 results will be
published in mid-April, when the group will have a clearer view of how
revenues from Eurostar and Le Shuttle services are building up.
Despite much reported teething troubles, Eurostar certainly pulled in
the passengers before Christmas but shortage of rolling stock meant that
it was limited to two trains a day. There was also limited supply of the
shuttle wagons used to transport cars so Le Shuttle started with lower
frequency than had been hoped.
These shortages will have a knock-on effect on the build up of traffic
and so 1995 revenues for Eurotunnel will be lower than the #513m
predicted in the prospectus of last May.
''Management's objective is that before the end of 1995 Le Shuttle
traffic should reach the monthly levels implied by the prospectus,'' the
group states.
Eurostar's traffic fell off to some extent after the Christmas period
as the number of trains increased and because of a delay in getting the
computer booking system fully up and running. Passengers have generally
been pleased with the service though there remains considerable
scepticism to be overcome.
It is also still not clear in many people's minds that there are two
distinct services, one the Eurostar passenger trains to Paris and
Brussels from London's Waterloo Station and the other the car shuttle
service between Folkestone and Calais.
The ferry companies have responded to Le Shuttle by mounting various
promotions and cut-price offers and the airlines are keeping a watchful
eye on how Eurostar develops. Any hopes there were that the tunnel
services would be able to charge a premium have long since evaporated.
They will clearly have to be fully competitive with the airlines and
ferries. Eurotunnel's fixed costs are high, particularly the interest in
its huge borrowings, and once these are covered revenue becomes pure
profit.
But faced with the greatly streamlined ferry operation at Dover,
Eurotunnel is going to have a fight on its hands to achieve its ambition
of securing half the cross-channel car traffic next year.
The shares at 298p, down 8p, have held on to the rally seen since the
October low but further progress will depend on how the revenue picture
develops.

as their funds have to be kept separate from policyholders' funds.
However, it could still indirectly result in them having to make some
reduction in bonuses. The mutual companies are owned by their

AGRICULTURE Minister William Waldegrave has outlined his strategy for
promoting ''alternative'' crops. UK farmers had already shown a healthy
enthusiasm for trying out novel crops and novel markets, he said.
''The possibilities are many. Crops are a renewable source of a wide
variety of raw materials, with potential for industries as diverse as
paints and plastics, textiles and toiletries.
Thanks to research developments -- especially in biotechnology -- and
environmental pressures, agricultural raw materials are demonstrating
advantages which make them increasingly worth considering.
There is little point in encouraging them, of course, if they are
never going to be viable without subsidy, but I do not rule out help to
get markets established.
''We are putting more money into oils, fibres, and energy crops. We
are working to achieve the most effective and co-ordinated targeting of
public sector funded research on alternative crops.''
Mr Waldegrave said that novel crops were one possible use for
set-aside land but, he warned, set-aside would not last for ever. ''I
want to see agriculture developing new markets with a sound economic
foundation and long-term prospects.''

THE Clinton White House has been an uncomfortable place since the
early days of his presidency. Everyone expected a new, youngish
President with a staff unaccustomed to running things in a presidential
way to make some mistakes in the early months. What has been unexpected
is the way in which the mistakes keep coming. The appalling results in
last year's elections can be seen as the inevitable result of President
Clinton's failure to come to grips with a number of important issues.
His cherished domestic policy frayed at the edges, and nowhere more
fatally than in the doomed attempt to pass sensible health care reform.
Lessons should have been learned but were not. As a result American
society is in some disarray, with old certainties breaking down under
renewed attack from the likes of Newt Gingrich. The passing this week of
Senator William Fulbright, that pillar of American liberalism, is
another reminder of changing times, but of more immediate concern to
President Clinton is the presidential election next year in which he is
already committed to stand for his party's nomination.
For all these reasons, and a good number more, this is not the time
for carelessness in the White House, yet still it happens. A case in
point is the bungled attempt to nominate a new surgeon general following
the last one's distressing habit of making embarrassing pronouncements.
Jocelyn Elders had to go, but not, surely, to be replaced by
obstetrician Henry Foster, who admits to performing abortions but cannot
remember how many. Pro-life groups are outraged and those in favour of
abortion are equally angered by President Clinton's waffling on the
subject.
The President cannot interview every candidate for a job personally,
or question him exhaustively on every source of potential embarrassment,
but a President can, and should, make sure that his staff are competent
to do this task for him. President Clinton has failed to do this and it
is a major failure in a modern presidency. On lesser subjects his
judgment is similarly suspect. His intervention in the six-month long US
baseball strike was intended as a demonstration of down-to-earth
presidential power. He convened a meeting, twisted arms in confident
expectation of success, and then was amazed when both players and club
owners simply ignored him. This may be no way to treat a President, but
then, some Presidents ask for it.

A FIFE market gardener and member of the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland has expressed unease at the most recent legislation on
trespass, which he described as ''the complete negation of any freedom
of access to any part of the Scottish landscape''.
Mr Eric Neil of Kinghorn in Fife, said that according to information
issued by the NFUS, it was now possible for a landowner to use force to
evict a walker.
''Undoubtedly, an aggressive employee could read this and feel free to
abuse, verbally or physically, anyone he met on the property,'' he said.
''An aggressive employee reading this advice would feel perfectly safe
in throwing his weight about.''
In an attempt to raise public awareness of the issues involved, Mr
Neil has written to local MPs in Fife and also to countryside groups.
His concern stemmed from two factors, he explained.
As a Quaker, he subscribed to the view that the land was God's and an
owner had only temporary access to it. ''It is our job to leave it
better than we found it,'' he said. Mr Neil is also a keen hillwalker,
but said he has had only a few problems about being turned away.
''I am of Canadian extraction and the trespass laws over there are
much stricter than here. That is why I feel so strongly about it,'' he
said. ''I am one of those people who has been converted, I am now more
Scottish than the Scots, and I have taken this matter up with the
executive of the Scottish National Party.''
Mr Neil said that the whole tenor of the legislation made it clear
that citizens were no longer free to enjoy the countryside in their own
land.
''I could, in theory, be stopped on any hillside by a person
purporting to be a representative of the landlord and ordered to leave.
If I demurred, I could be taken off by the scruff of the neck. I would
not be able to prove this was utterly unnecessary. What is 'reasonable
force'?
''I was aware that our rights to enjoy our countryside were under
threat. I was not aware that they were being removed in a draconian
way.''
The NFUS advice note on trespass deals mainly with the Criminal
Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which, it says, adds another dimension
to the criminal law of Scotland in relation to trespass.
It goes on to say that the term ''trespass'' is one which has not been
defined by the Scottish courts.
For what might be termed ''simple'' trespass -- being somewhere
without doing any damage and without using violence or having criminal
intent -- it suggests that a landowner would require to look to the
civil law for a remedy.
The note goes on to say that an owner has certain rights to require a
trespasser to leave, and if the trespass is accompanied by violence or
destruction, the landowner may use sufficient force as is reasonably
necessary.

NORTHERN Electric overstepped the mark in one of its comments about
Trafalgar House in its defence document attacking the #1200m bid, which
is becoming increasingly acrimonious, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
This is the opinion of the Takeover Panel which forced Northern into
making a clarification statement yesterday. Following a complaint from
Trafalgar, the Panel was concerned about Northern's statement that the
directors of ''financially-challenged'' Trafalgar should explain why
they had not made a statement that it was a ''going concern'' in the
last accounts.
In a terse statement yesterday Northern said it was not seeking to
suggest that Trafalgar directors were not able to make such a statement.
It noted the working capital statement in the listing particulars
accompanying Trafalgar's offer document that the accounts of the group
had been prepared on a going concern basis, on which the auditors'
report was unqualified.
The accountancy bodies issued a guidance note for directors last
November that they should make a ''going concern'' statement in company
accounts. This was after Trafalgar's year-end so its accounts did not
include such a statement.

SHARES in securities house S G Warburg plunged 25p to 726p after it
was revealed that another eight employees had left its equity capital
markets division to join the Morgan Grenfell subsidiary of Deutsche
Bank.
On Wednesday, Warburg said that Maurice Thompson and Michael Cohrs had
gone to Morgan Grenfell for a total of #7m between them over the next
two years. As this was not done solely for money, both men in any event
are earning already well over #1m a year, it was seen a body blow to an
investment house which has had more than its fair share of bad luck in
recent weeks.
This includes the abortive talks with Morgan Stanley for a merger
which would have given the highly-regarded American securities house in
the dominant position. But the failure of the talks could not hide that
Warburg has put itself up for sale and so is likely to unsettle some
corporate clients looking for long-term relationships.
Additionally, it has lost other senior people recently, while its
reputation was damaged by the failure to win Lasmo for its Enterprise
Oil client.

* I wish to transfer shares registered in my name to my wife. There
will, I hope, be no capital gains tax involved, but how is the amount of
stamp duty payable calculated, and where do you get the transfer form
stamped?
* Transferring shares to your wife does not involve a capital gains
tax liability, as the shares will be deemed to have been transferred at
a value which produces neither gain nor loss. You are entitled to add
the appropriate indexation allowance to the cost of your shares, and it
is that increased value that your wife will take as her tax cost.
On any subsequent disposal by her, further indexation is due from the
date of transfer to the date of sale. In the meantime, you should
include details of the transfer when completing your annual tax return.
There is no stamp duty payable on the shares being gifted to your
wife. It is sufficient for you to complete the appropriate sections of
the stock transfer forms which should be signed by both of you. These
should then be sent to the company registrars.
* I have inherited about #85,000, mainly in cash, though there are a
couple of small shareholdings in BT and Royal Bank of Scotland. I would
welcome your advice on how to make the best use of this money.
I am 53, and hope to be able to carry on working until I am 65 when I
would be entitled to a maximum two-thirds of salary pension. My mortgage
will be paid off in two years with possibly a small surplus from my
endowment policy.
At this stage I do not need any income from my capital, which I would
like to grow for me between now and my retirement. A family friend who
is in the insurance business has recommended that I invest #25,000 in
each of three distribution bonds, and deposit the remaining #10,000 in a
high income account with a building society in my wife's name as she has
no taxable income of her own.
Is this a good approach or would I be better trying something else?
From my own resources I have built up a portfolio of half-a-dozen unit
trusts, worth about #17,000 at last count, and also have the maximum in
an Abbey National Tessa account.
* Insurance bonds are widely recommended to investors who would often
be better served by other vehicles. Such bonds have a poorer record than
either unit or investment trusts. When an investor is seeking capital
growth it is doubly inappropriate to put money into distribution bonds,
which are designed to provide income.
Moreover, it makes no sense at all to invest capital in lumps as large
as #25,000, given the funds, totalling around #110,000, that you have at
your disposal. A much wider spread is desirable.
We would strongly advise you to reject the advice of your family
friend, and seek an independent opinion.
Capital growth is most likely to result from long-term investment in
equity-type investments, such as company shares like your BT and Royal
Bank of Scotland holdings, or through investment and unit trusts, which
themselves have their own equity portfolios.
In your case, you have more than enough time between now and your
expected retirement date for such investments to fructify and provide
you with a valuable nest egg from which you can start to take an income
when you are no longer working.
Between your inheritance and your own savings, you have sufficient
capital to fund a portfolio of your own. This could include your unit
trust holdings and some investment trusts, but there is also plenty of
scope for further investment in conventional shares. You have the
resources to give a decent spread across sectors.
Accordingly, we would advise you to consult a stockbroker. He or she
will review your existing investments and make fresh recommendations for
the additional capital. If you do not have the name of a suitable
broker, you can obtain a list of Scottish stockbrokers from the Stock
Exchange in Glasgow.
It is always wise to have some cash at your disposal. You should
certainly keep your Tessa going meantime, and perhaps go ahead with the
plan to put #10,000 cash on deposit in your wife's name.
It is worth bearing in mind, however, that a better return could be
obtained from Government stock than building society deposits, and your
wife would be able to reclaim the tax on the gilt dividends. This would
also be a matter for discussion with a stockbroker.
* I paid in advance for my gas and electricity to cover the period
April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1995 to save paying VAT at 8%. Is there a
loophole in the legislation to save me paying VAT in the following year?
* Unfortunately not. Any payments made subsequent to the imposition of
VAT attracted the tax. It might have been possible to avoid another
chunk of VAT if the rate was to be subsequently raised to the standard
17.5%, but the Government backed down on this in the face of the barrage
of criticism and the rate stays at 8%.
* I have held Tribune Investment Trust shares since the early
seventies and could check the movements in the investment trust column
in the newspaper share lists -- just a few items from the end. Now this
seems to have been taken up by ''Turkey''. Your comments on this change
would be appreciated.
* You don't need to worry, Tribune Investment Trust has not changed
from being an international trust to a narrow specialist concentrating
on the volatile Turkish stock market. It has merely changed its name to
Baring Tribune Investment Trust, to reflect the management stable it is
part of.
While not among the leaders, Baring Tribune has an average track
record within its peer group.
* We have recently retired early, myself aged 56 and my husband at 61.
I have a General Accident Kaleidoscope policy taken out in December
1988. The monthly premium is #120. It is 100% in General Accident's
managed fund and the life insurance benefit is #1200.
As at November 22 the surrender value was #8416, but this figure
cannot be guaranteed due to fluctuations in the stock market. I would
have hoped for a better return after six years. I can reduce the
premiums to #12 per month, and cash in the policy at the tenth
anniversary, or take the surrender value which does not equal the
payments made.
As our circumstances have changed it would require using savings to
meet the #120 per month payment and this seems unwise.
* This is indeed a disappointing surrender value. If you can, it would
be better to reduce the payment to the minimum and wait for the tenth
anniversary of the policy, when the payout should hopefully be not
unreasonable -- the track record of the fund is in line with the average
for its sector.
* I currently have money invested in a capital investment bond to the
sum of #18,000. In January 1994 the price was 174p. It is now 158p.
Would this money perform better in an investment trust?
* Given that over the past year the UK stock market, as measured by
the All-Share index, has fallen by 12%, then the 9% drop recorded by
your bond is not bad at all. The outlook for shares this year is more
positive, and there is no guarantee an investment trust would perform
better, so you should stick with your bond.
* My sister owns two properties and also has fairly substantial stock
exchange investments accumulated over a number of years. I am the sole
beneficiary of her estate and she has suggested that, as she is
terminally ill, she should gift the assets to me now to reduce the tax
which would eventually be payable on her estate. Can you confirm that
there are no disadvantages to this please?
* There is unlikely to be any tax benefit to be obtained by
transferring the assets now, as if your sister dies within three years
of making the gifts the inheritance tax liability on death would remain
unchanged. Although the gifts would be potentially exempt transfers,
these do not fall out of account until seven years from the date of
gift, although only a proportion of the full tax would be payable if
death occurs more than three years from the date of gift.
Your sister should, however, take advantage of the time remaining to
her in utilising her annual inheritance tax exemption of #3000. If she
has not already used the 1993/94 exemption, a total of #6000 could be
gifted before April 5, and a further #3000 on April 6.

MEMBERS of the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in Scotland
were unanimous in their condemnation of the mistreatment of animals
shown in the BBC television programme Frontline Scotland this week, the
institute president Willie Blair said yesterday.
''We understand the most serious incident, which did not involve
market staff, is in the hands of the procurator fiscal,'' he said. ''The
two minor incidents, in which market staff were involved, has resulted
in them being taken to task and warned as to their future conduct.
''The fact that it took several months of filming to collect this
small number of incidents in markets throughout Scotland -- which have a
total annual turnover of some four million sheep and 750,000 cattle --
confirms our strongly-held belief that such cases are isolated.''
Mr Blair said that SSPCA, environmental health and trading standards
personnel were in attendance at each sale, along with either veterinary
surgeons or technical officers from the Scottish Office agriculture
department. These agencies and the auction firms' own welfare officers
were always prepared to look into any incident brought to their notice.
''Notwithstanding the presence of these officials it is not physically
possible for them to be everywhere ensuring that each and every
regulation is followed to the letter. It is our firm belief that some
additional practical input into the framing of regulations is
required.''
''It is the aim of our members to prevent ill treatment of any animals
in our markets. Apart from the serious welfare implications, such
treatment would cause serious damage to the carcases of those going for
slaughter, with consequent financial penalties.''

FORMED under three years ago, the Amicable Smaller Enterprises trust
has since kept well ahead of its benchmark index in asset terms, though
both lost ground last year, writes COLIN McSEVENY.
The #55m investment trust, managed by Scottish Amicable, saw its net
asset value fall 3.3% to 137.9p in 1994 against a 7.0% drop in the
benchmark Hoare Govett specialist index.
Like most other trusts, gains made in last six months of 1993 were
wiped out by the turn in interest rate sentiment last February.
A final dividend of 1.4p is to be paid, making a total of 3.1p against
3.4p the previous year. Fully-diluted earnings per share dipped
marginally from 135.7p to 131.7p.
The dividend cut, anticipated in the interim statement, stemmed from
the company's decision to phase out the distribution of exceptional
revenue last year and also indicates a slight shift in investment
strategy.
''This policy places a greater emphasis on investment in quality
companies where yields are likely to be below average,'' chairman Hugh
Laughland said yesterday. ''The outlook for smaller companies remains
encouraging as they rebuild balance sheets and improve activity in line
with economic growth.''
In the period since the launch in March 1992, the trust has increased
its asset value by 44% compared with a 30.1% increase in the benchmark
index.

KINGFISHER has looked to the past for a saviour for its loss-making
electrical chain, Comet. Eddie Styring, who ran the business in the late
1980s, has been brought back to mastermind a recovery programme.
He will become chairman of Comet, working closely with an old
colleague, Brent Wilkinson, the company's managing director, who will
concentrate on day-to-day operations. The two worked together at Comet
between 1987 and 1989 during which time they doubled its profits,
admittedly in a much more buoyant retailing market.
Mr Styring left in 1989 to rescue a management buy-out and has since
advised a number of retailers. Now he will report to Kingfisher director
Philippe Frances, who runs the group's successful French electrical
retailer, Darty.
Other appointments include Martin Toogood who will move from being
retail director at Woolworth, responsible for property and store
operations, to head B&amp;Q Superstores, now a separate division of B&amp;Q.

PRESIDENT Clinton has walked straight into the bear trap, which is
distressing to his friends, because he set it himself. He nominated a
new surgeon-general last Friday and it is already only too clear that he
will probably abandon the wretched man.
This would not have happened if the White House were smarter or better
organised or less obsessed with placating the various minorities who
voted Democratic in 1992. For White House, read Bill Clinton. For a
clever man, he can be very stupid.
Here's what happened. When he became President, he nominated Dr
Jocelyn Elders as surgeon-general. It used not to be a very notable
position. Its role is generally hortatory, the general urging people to
lead healthy lives, and lecturing to medical audiences.
It was a surgeon-general's report that first explicitly made the link
30 years ago between smoking and lung cancer, and ever after more
reports, on smoking and other matters, have been issued in a steady
stream over the current surgeon-general's name.
Then Ronald Reagan appointed Dr Everett Koop to the job, in 1981. He
was a distinguished paediatrician from Philadelphia, and he turned out
to have an amazing flair for publicity. He launched a full-scale attack
on smoking, and achieved astonishing results.
It is largely because of Dr Koop that smokers now lead harassed and
unhappy lives in the United States.
His successor, under President Bush, was less militant, and Mr Clinton
decided to find a successor on the Koop model. Dr Elders, who is black,
was even more outspoken than Dr Koop. Unfortunately, a lot of what she
said was deeply controversial, and sometimes silly. She caused Mr
Clinton much embarrassment and was finally told to shut up.
Last December, ignoring the order, she told a group of specialists in
sex education: ''With regard to masturbation, I think that is something
that is part of human sexuality that perhaps should be taught.'' She
went on to say that schoolchildren knew far too little about
masturbation and that their ignorance should be corrected.
So Mr Clinton fired her. That upset black Americans, who were already
doubtful about the President's commitment to racial equality. So he
decided that he needed a black candidate to replace Dr Elders.
The President told his staff to find a black doctor who could easily
be confirmed. They came across Dr Henry Foster, an
obstetrician-gynaecologist from Tennessee who had made a name for
himself encouraging teenagers to practise abstinence as the best way to
avoid getting pregnant.
Splendid, said the White House. Just the man to sail through the
Senate. They missed the line on his curriculum vitae stating that he was
on the board of Planned Parenthood in Tennessee (the organisation
recommends women on birth control and runs abortion clinics). They also
neglected to ask him whether he had ever performed abortions. Perhaps
they didn't know what obstetricians- gynaecologists do for a living.
At the last moment, the day before Dr Foster's nomination was to be
announced, some flunky called him and asked: ''By the way, have you ever
performed an abortion?'' He said yes, at least one he remembered,
perhaps more.
The announcement went ahead in the White House, and the spin doctors
made sure the first news stories were favourable. But medical reporters,
not to mention anti-abortion activists, noted the reference to Planned
Parenthood and the doctor's specialty, and demanded a more precise
answer.
This time the doctor said he had performed no more than a dozen
therapeutic abortions. The White House apologised for saying the number
was one. Then they had a look at his medical records, and on Wednesday
night Dr Foster was on television admitting 39 abortions.
Now he looks a liar, which is probably unfair (the operations were
spread over 20 years, and he wasn't counting). But the White House had
to apologise again. Mr Clinton has appeared several times, offering
subdued support for the nominee.
His liberal critics are just as outraged as conservatives.
Abortion is legal in the United States, and, they say, the President
should have said that Dr Foster had been only doing his job, and offered
no apologies.
That, of course, would not help in the Senate, where the new
Republican majority is opposed to abortion and will not be able to
resist the opportunity to show up presidential ineptitude. Indeed,
anti-abortion activists are delighted.
They have been quiescent for the past few months, since their most
militant comrades-in-arms started murdering doctors and fire-bombing
clinics. Now they can return to the attack, even though the Republicans
wanted to avoid the fight, using the nomination of Dr Foster as the
occasion.
They could not get a ''right to life' amendment through Congress, but
they can defeat the good doctor. And Mr Clinton loses, whatever happens.
If he drops Dr Foster, allowing him to withdraw his nomination, he
looks a wimp. If he fights to the bitter end, and loses -- well, that's
a defeat. If, miraculously, he wins, there's no glory in getting a
surgeon-general confirmed and the very fact that a full-scale battle is
needed shows up his staff's, and his own, incompetence.
A year ago he fired his chief of staff, Mack McLarty, for a series of
disasters. He hired a new man, Leon Panetta, a former congressman wise
in the ways of Washington. Things have continued on their old path.
The President takes weeks to reach decisions, and then often bungles
them. What is more, he appears indecisive and weak. No-one is convinced
by his promises that he will stand by Dr Foster.
So there he is, in his own bear-trap. Serves him right.

JUST for once, let's get away from art and significance for five
minutes around here and sing the old school sports song of St Custard's
Academy: ho for fun and frolic, ho for sport and play!
You may have noticed, over four long years (longer for us, pal), that
boffo comedies seldom make it to the top of this column compared to,
say, searching investigations of the human condition (with subtitles)
that play for four days at the Glasgow Film Theatre; but that's not
because Couch Potato is any very profound sort of guy -- it's just that
good serious films are easier to make and therefore much commoner than
comedies that truly make you laugh your face off, the best of which
we've seen for years is the utterly pointless and simple-minded Caspar
Milquetoast/Walter Mitty laugh riot The Mask (rental, cert PG).
Although sold largely on the basis of the special effects that
transpire whenever put-upon nice-guy bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss (Jim
Carrey) dons an ancient Norse Hallowe'en visor that he hauls out of the
river while trying to rescue a drowning man who isn't there, the real
allure of this insufficiently admired time-passer lies in other
quarters: in the sparkling musical numbers a la Busby Berkeley, in its
high-camp showbiz dialogue, in its loving homage to the deranged 1940s
and 1950s cartoon comedies of Tex Avery, and most of all in its high
quotient of good old-fashioned Hollywood heart.
You just know that, when it comes time to sort out the bad guy (Peter
Greene) and get the girl (Cameron Diaz), our Stan'll be able to do it
without supernatural aid: because, you see, he was really a lovable and
feisty kind of guy all along -- only he didn't know it. Heard this one
before? Who cares?
Plot concerns a bank-robbery conspiracy in which Stan's alter-ego
heists the dough from under the noses of the black hats, and Stan gets
the blame from the cops, but don't let that detain you any longer than
it does anyone else involved; just enjoy The Mask's exhilarating leaps
of logic and action and its zestful atmosphere of cartoon fun. It's a
film to chase the Seasonal Affective Disorder winter blues away.
Aficionados of the talking animals without which no Road movie was
complete (remember the camel in Road To Morocco: ''this is the screwiest
movie I was ever in . . .'') will take at least a passing interest in
Pier Paolo Pasolini's gentle 1966 politico-religious parable Hawks And
Sparrows (retail, #15.99, cert PG), in which a talking Marxist crow
acompanies father-and-son pilgrims Toto and Ninetto Davoli on a
picaresque comic journey through Italy in the footsteps of St Francis of
Assisi.
Fairly plotless, but enlivened by a series of kindly comic vignettes
harking back to the Italian neo-realist style of films like Bicycle
Thieves, it's a film that leaves no great message behind except the
humane doubts of a recently ex-Marxist director struggling for a new
ideology. More importantly, it makes you smile, and it's got a great
soundtrack by Ennio Morricone -- what more do you want?
If you shed a furtive tear at the end of Aladdin as Robin Williams's
hepcat genie-with-attitude retired from the three-wishes racket and set
of on indefinite vacation, weep no more: he's back at work in Disney's
straight-to-video sequel The Return Of Jafar (retail, #14.99, cert U),
except that he sounds a bit different now, being viced by the presumably
cheaper Dan Castellanata, formerly the voice of Bart Simpson's dad
Homer.
You may remember that, in the original, the wicked vizier Jafar became
a genie himself and got locked up in the magic lamp, which was casually
hurled into the middle distance with a few words about him not getting
out again for anothr 10,000 years. Well, don't time fly . . . he's back
and he's mad, and Aladdin and his princess don't look a day older.
Though obviously a less expensive and ambitious film than Aladdin,
Return Of Jafar is no disgrace to its marvellous predecessor in terms of
storytelling and thrills, and, at a little more than its skimpy 66
minutes, might have done quite nicely in the cinema. Fill the magic
carpet full of gas and get ready for a charming and exciting factory
ride with the shade of old Uncle Walt at the controls.
And finally: the legendary (pity it wasn't mythical) Z-movie thrill
extravaganza Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes (1977, retail, #12.99, cert
PG) makes one of its rare appearances on public release. Sadly, it never
matches its flamboyant and energetic sleeve art: as Leslie Halliwell
said of another film, they ought to have put sprocket holes on the
publicity and thrown the movie away. Once seen, never (alas) forgotten.

STEEPED in blood, brimming with action, seething with lust, bursting
with beautiful women in low-cut bodices, and teeming with dashing
gallants, Patrice Chereau's La Reine Margot (18) takes one back to the
days when Bette Davis and Errol Flynn used to storm the screen in
costume dramas. She would be indescribably wicked in a farthingale or a
bustle, he would be gloriously debonair in tights or uniform. Maybe the
film is bad history, but it is glorious melodrama.
The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve in 1572 is one of the great and
dreadful events in French history. The country was split between
Catholics and Protestants, civil war had been raging, and to patch a
peace together a marriage was arranged between the Protestant Henry of
Navarre (Daniel Auteuil) and Marguerite de Valois (Isabelle Adjani),
sister of the weak and dissolute Catholic King Charles XI (Jean-Hughes
Anglade). Behind the machinations was his mother, the formidable
Catherine de Medici (Virna Lisi), scheming to ensure the permanence of
the House of Guise.
The wedding celebrated, Henry having renounced his religion, Catherine
decided to get rid of his Protestant supporters, and the massacre of the
Huguenots, who had come to Paris for the wedding, took place.
Chereau's spectacular film -- the lush photography is by Philippe
Rousselot who shot Interview with the Vampire -- is based on a novel by
Alexandre Dumas. It is about a fictional love affair between Margot and
a young Protestant nobleman, La Mole (Vincent Perez), who has come to
Paris for the wedding. The bride spurns her husband on their wedding
night, takes to the streets, and meets La Mole. It is lust and then love
at first sight.
But her future is uncertain. Her mother is plotting to replace the
king with one of his brothers, and her husband's life is in danger. As
well as the doomed romance with La Mole, the film also charts the
growing realisation by Marguerite that her fate is bound up with that of
her husband, and that they stand or fall together. Trust slowly grows as
these two royals, united for reasons of political expediency, realise
they have a common purpose -- survival.
Bad history? For a start the couple were in their late teens, a period
both Adjani and Auteuil have left long since. But they give true star
performances. That is to say he presents a convincing countryman
struggling to survive and at sea in a society he hates, while she does
what female stars worthy of the name do -- looks gorgeous and sexy and
wears her clothes with style. In addition the clothes are a good century
and a half out of date, chosen for their look rather than their period
accuracy. The film's best performance comes from Virna Lisi barnstorming
through a role Bette Davis would have killed for as a black-widow spider
whose machinations eventually go terribly wrong.
The film is richly cast -- Jean-Hughes Anglade's Charles XI is a
marvellous creation and gets to perform a truly amazing screen death
scene -- and while the plots and counterplots, the poisonings and
assassinations, and all those incestuous Guise relationships can be
confusing, La Reine Margot is one of those rare films to sit back and
wallow in. Ask not the reasons why, just enjoy.
This is French week with a vengeance. Luc Besson's Leon (18) is proof
that it is not just Quentin Tarantino who can make dazzling, empty, and
thoroughly entertaining films stuffed with violence. In this tale of a
hired killer he has resurrected a character who appeared briefly in one
of his previous hits, Nikita, about a female assassin, namely Victor the
Cleaner. Tarantino pinched him for the Harvey Keitel role in Pulp
Fiction. This time, called Leon, played as before by Jean Reno, an actor
with a wonderfully lugubrious manner, he is a hired assassin, a
dedicated loner, working in New York.
One day he meets Mathilda (Nathalie Portman), the little girl next
door, notices she has a bruise on her face, and sympathises with her.
Mathilda, a nymphette version of Nikita, is the daughter of a gross drug
dealer, who is murdered by his associates along with the rest of her
family while she is out getting some groceries. When she returns she
realises something is wrong and rings Leon's doorbell. He takes her in
and a strange friendship develops.
Portman, tough, funny, vulnerable, and old for her years, makes a
splendid foil for Reno's oddly beguiling assassin who charts his own
destruction as he helps her get revenge. Gary Oldman, as a pill-popping
killer with an affection for Beethoven and Armani suits, gives a truly
terrible furniture-chewing performance about which the less said the
better.
The new Star Trek film, Generations (PG), unites Captain Kirk, a
patently past-his-sell-by-date William Shatner, with his successor as
captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), in a very
complicated plot which is not really worth the bother of unravelling.
Why is it that nobody ever wears a seat-belt on the Enterprise because
the crew is always being hurtled to the floor or tossed up in the air by
violent jolts from alien weaponry or passing asteroids?
The film opens with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov going on a maiden voyage
by a newly commissioned Enterprise. It gets into trouble with a strange
belt of energy called a Nexus, and Kirk is killed saving the ship -- or
so it seems. He has been sucked into space through a hole in the hull.
On to Picard's Enterprise 78 years later: a mad scientist (Malcolm
McDowell) is putting a world at risk by trying to get into the Nexus, a
kind of Paradise Lost where people live the life they always dreamt of
living, having been plucked from it by Kirk all those years ago. Why
Picard and Kirk, who has, of course, ended up in the Nexus, can leave it
at will, but nobody can get into it without blowing up a harmless
planet, is anybody's guess, but in this sort of tosh it hardly matters.
The new Enterprise crew lack the truly awful bad-actor qualities which
so distinguished Kirk's crew, but Trekkies and fans of Shatner's famous
rugs, which is not the same thing, should be well pleased.
Jason Scott Lee, last seen baring his magnificent chest as an Easter
Island prince, repeats his performance as Mowgli, the lost boy brought
up in the Indian jungle by wolves, in the latest Disney action
adventure, Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (PG). Kipling must be
whirling in his grave at the liberties taken with his tale of the Raj,
but, provided your child cannot read, the film should do well enough as
a holiday treat.
Gary Sinyor's Solitaire for Two (15) deals with the bizarre love
affair between a behavioural psychologist (Mark Frankel) and Katie
(Amanda Pays), a paleontology lecturer at the Natural History Museum.
From the director of Leon the Pig Farmer, it is one of those
battle-of-the-sexes tales in which Rock Hudson and Doris Day used to
cavort, and passes the time agreeably.

A LACK of car parking at the foot of Ben Nevis could increase the
likelihood of climbers getting stranded on the mountain, Lochaber
Mountain Rescue Team warned yesterday.
The warning comes a week after the team helped find two students who
had been forced to spend 36 hours in a snow-hole on the ben.
In the past, the car park of Fort William Golf Club has provided a
convenient starting point for climbers. Ben Nevis Distillery land also
offered parking.
The arrangements for courtesy parking were informal, however, and no
agreement has been struck for this year. Highland Regional Council has
been asked to consider the problem.
The rescue team's secretary, Mr Miller Harris, said: ''Climbers
traditionally parked in the golf club grounds to gain access to the main
ascent routes of the north face of the ben. If they have to find other
places to leave their cars, this could add significantly to the time
they take to get to the slopes.''
He added that this could mean climbers being caught out by nightfall,
forcing them to stay on the mountain overnight.
0    Fort William mountain guide Tony Kimber said: ''It is well known
that early starts and early finishes decrease the likelihood of
mountaineering accidents.''

LAST week I spent a few days in Brussels, a city where the time is one
hour later than here, and every expatriate radio seems permanently tuned
to Radio 4 on long wave; so that every night just before midnight as I
was getting into bed, the little radio in my room would be churning out
the mellifluous voice of Ronald Pickup reading -- as Book at Bedtime's
contribution to Radio 4's current Romance Season -- a memoir called
Initials in the Heart, by a minor Englishman of letters called Laurence
Whistler. Every evening without fail Whis
tler's tale had me reduced, within minutes, to a state of quivering
irritation that the BBC should even think of squandering so much time
and talent on such a piece of self-indulgent waffle.
It's not that Initials in the Heart is offensive in itself. It's
simply the painstakingly detailed story of Whistler's feelings during
his romance with, and marriage to, his wife, set in various manor-houses
and cottages around the south of England during the Second World War,
and -- in the manner of that time and class -- shot through with the
idea that flesh and spirit are somehow separate, the one low and
degraded, the other exalted and fine; the kind of conventional
between-the-wars sensibility that makes you realise what D H Lawrence
was up against.
But what is astounding is the assumption that this insular little
fragment of experience is somehow powerful and normative enough to merit
a 10-part Book at Bedtime adaptation as a valuable insight into the
nature of romance. I haven't been so cross since the occasion when Radio
4 expected us to take an interest in the ramblings about her own private
life of a not-very-talented writer called Lisa St Aubin de Teran. If Ms
de Teran had been a typist called Lizzie Bloggs, and Mr Whistler a
bus-driver called Joe Spart, it would become obvious to everyone that
their self-asborbed musings are of very little interest indeed.
But all this is only to be expected, as Radio 4 faces increasing
pressure to ''niche'' itself as nostalgia therapy for the over-60s of
middle England; and the Romance Season -- heavily weighted towards the
Noel Coward end of things -- represents a standing temptation, since the
very concept of ''romance'' seems bound up with the taut emotional
atmosphere and exaggerated gender differences of wartime and the years
between the wars. Some producers, though, are trying to put a
contemporary spin on the subject; and among them is Radio Scotland's
Patrick Rayner, who directed last Tuesday's Thirty Minute Theatre, The
Upshot, by John Merryfield, and starring Gerda Stevenson and Paul Young.
But the trouble with this play -- about a chubby Edinburgh
thirty-something called Morna and her on-off romance with a shy elderly
divorce called Guy
-- was that it was even less like real life than Noel Coward's Private
Lives which at least has something to say about the elusive magic of
erotic attraction. In fact, it prompted me to gloomy musings on the
strange and implausible role in modern romantic writing of the
accidental pregnancy, an eventuality that has come, in the age of casual
sex, to replace the meeting of eyes across a crowded room as the
literary litmus-test of a relationship's predestined and romantic
character. In real life, people who get pregnant by accident usually do
so by someone they wish they had never met, never mind want to spend the
rest of their lives with. But try telling that to the New Romantics, for
whom chance fertility has become the touchstone of true love; if only,
alas, it were true.
Far be it from me, meanwhile, to agree with BBC boss John Birt about
anything much; but after a brief exposure to Radio 4's Today, I suspect
that he may have been right to point out that belligerence in
interviewing is not quite the same thing as tough questioning. The other
day, I heard John Humphrys interviewing the Unionist MP David Trimble
about the proposal that the Government should think about lifting the
Prevention of Terrorism Act. Humphrys was as rude as you please,
irritable and dismissive. But thrice Trimble said that the IRA ceasfire
was ''no reason for the British state to disarm''; and thrice Humphrys,
in mid-bluster, let this gross exaggeration of what was being proposed
go unchallenged, if not entirely unheard. To generate heat, in other
words is not always to generate light; and broadcasters should remember
that there are more ways than one of skinning a cat.
Laurence Whistler: not a bus-driver called Spart.

BUSTLE bustle bustle. As The Buccaneers bustle in, I slouch out; to
the sound of rustling silk and squeals of laughter. BBC1's voluptuous
new series is my cue for a career-change, but does it also signal a
policy-shift in the period-drama department? Edith Wharton may not be
George Eliot, but The Buccaneers shows little of the meticulous
integrity of the television Middlemarch. It has more in common with
Rodgers and Hammerstein.
Bless their beautiful hides, I can't tell the four young man-eaters
apart. They are all teeth, ringlets, and Wonderbra cleavage. It's not my
intention to spend much time on The Buccaneers, as this week's column is
a valediction to television (although not to Herald readers) and a dash
down the memory lane of 4895 viewing opportunities; but its opening
episode does recall, if not reflect, the values of the first
''blockbuster'' period drama series which came the way of the
newly-appointed critic. Which was . . .
Brideshead Revisited. When I started reviewing television, my
children, life was hard. To change channels you had to get up out of
your chair and cross the room to press a button. The video industry was
in its infancy. There were no satellite dishes, no cables, and only
three terrestrial channels. But British television made its own
entertainment, and it was often splendid. In the autumn of 1981, as I
settled into my new job, Granada unveiled the series which was to become
the touchstone of excellence for drama in the eighties.
It was much too early to start worrying about the future of television
broadcasting which, with the excitement of a fourth channel just a year
away, seemed confident and optimistic in its expansionist challenge. But
with the benefit of hindsight and the files I detect a hint of elegy in
my review of Brideshead Revisited, which stirred ''the dark old Scottish
worry that something so exquisitely, so effortlessly enjoyable must get
its comeuppance, and us with it''.
Not for a bit. The BBC also had a run of big-budget drama productions
which were popular and critical successes: Tenko (remember fierce, kind
Bea -- Stephanie Cole -- now reincarnated as Diana in Waiting for God?),
The Borgias, Edge of Darkness, Fortunes of War and, from BBC Scotland,
John Byrne's rock n' roll comic-strip masterpiece, Tutti-Frutti.
But after Granada trumped its own triumph with the even more majestic
The Jewel in the Crown, which took four years to make, 14 weeks to
transmit and cost #5 million, it was becoming clear that no single
broadcasting house could ever again afford to finance such ambitious
drama, and that its future lay in international co-production, with the
inevitable compromises.
The writers who dominated original television drama in the eighties
were Dennis Potter, for the feverish imagination of The Singing
Detective, and Alan Bleasdale and G F Newman for their social and
political critiques of Thatcher's Britain. Mrs Thatcher even had her own
show, ''the Thatcherite drama series'' Howard's Way, which with
immaculate timing and impeccable loyalty bowed out when she did, in
1990.
I spent a lot of time writing about Mrs Thatcher's television
appearances, which might have been masterminded by a subversive Ministry
for Fun. When the Conservatives replaced the Prime Minister television
lost a star whose thespian talent crossed the spectrum from low farce to
epic tragedy, but whose one-note rhetoric scarcely knew which was which.
For all that, the only interviewer who ever succeeded in rattling her
was an amateur: Mrs Diana Gould, who torpedoed her sang-froid over the
sinking of the Belgrano.
The Falklands War in 1982 was my first television war but it took
another nine years, and another war for British forces, to turn conflict
into infotainment. Armchair soldiers were mesmerised by the computer
games of the Gulf War strategists and television continued its process
of reporting each major world event -- the epoch-making summits of
Reagan and Gorbechev, the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, the
tumbling of the Berlin Wall -- as if it were staging a rather
serious-minded Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, like Jesus Christ Superstar
or Evita.
In the late eighties, facts became chiels held in thrall to the new
technology and its showbiz production values. To this critical viewer
this has been the most perceptible change in a period of great change
within the industry, much of it exciting, much of it meretricious.
The domestic landmarks are well-known: Channel 4, whose ''alternative
voice'' sinks to a whisper occasionally or becomes merely petulant, but
remains a force for innovation; breakfast television, which has been
handled with quiet competence over the years by the BBC and has been a
pig's breakfast on both commercial networks; daytime television, which
by definition never gets mass audiences or the most dedicated attention
of programme-makers.
And a number of foxes have caused havoc in the broadcasting henhouses
-- deregulation, cable and satellite, independent production quotas,
franchise auctions, Mr Birt's infamous ''producer choice''; all set
loose, broadly speaking, by the prevailing ideology of the Thatcher
years. Consumer choice is wider, the technology gets better and better,
there is ever more world-class sport available for those who like that
sort of thing, but television magic becomes more and more elusive.
Regularly throughout the eighties I would find gold dumped in the
corner of the sitting-room: a beautifully-crafted drama, an eloquent
documentary, an idiosyncratic interview, a sudden breathless advance in
the possibilities of global communication. A short nine years ago the
BBC made its first live satellite broadcast and we could still feel
wonder. ''We could look out of our windows,'' I wrote, ''and see the
same kind of clear blue weather they're having in China. And we could
look at our screens and see the Queen, 55 miles from Peking, stepping
smartly up the spine of the Great Wall.''
These wonders have become commonplace but they bring their own risks.
In his much-thumbed book, Amusing Ourselves to Death, Neil Postman has
criticised television for presenting everything from marketing to
politics to global news to religion to education in the same cultural
language which is used for game shows and soap operas, thus rendering
information ''simplistic, non-substantive, non-historical, and
non-contextual''. The cultural language, as I said earlier, increasingly
seems unable to distinguish between information and entertainment, which
must mean that we, too, find it harder and harder to make that
distinction.
But I don't take an apocalyptic view of the long-term consequences.
The human story has seen these confusions in other times, and survived
them. Samuel Pepys, a civilised man, took his wife and children on an
outing to an execution by hanging and disembowelling. My worries for
television are more concerned with its short-term domestic health. The
medium, like the nineties, shows nervousness, loss of touch, and a
failure to find those cornerstones of popular entertainment which make
you pine for autumn nights, like the seasonal dramas of a Tenko or even,
for heaven's sake, the slick, soapy contortions of quality escapism like
Dallas. And what kind of drama does Granada make these days? Stylish
slasher movies.
Clive James, gamekeeper turned poacher, remarked of his 10 years
before the box: ''I began with the suspicion, and ended with the
conviction, that popular entertainment is well worth doing.'' To that I
would add, ''and worth doing well''.
Some well-made popular fixtures endure: Coronation Street and its
nearest rival, EastEnders, about to celebrate its tenth birthday. The
British soaps show every sign of matching the record of The Archers, and
in time will see off the Australian ones.
As for me, as the images repeat themselves and the ideas are re-cycled
I find I'm beginning to repeat myself, too. So it's time to go -- with
few regrets but a lot of gratitude and affection for the eclectic,
electronic ''window on the world'' which has given me the chance, by its
very nature, to write about everything and anything. My thanks to all
you other viewers who have kept me on the qui vive with your own
critiques, as I hand you over to Ian Bell. He'll be a hard act to
precede.

A WOMAN told a murder trial yesterday that she saw a man being shot as
a group of men pursued two people said to be bank robbers.
Mrs Tracey Stewart, 27, said she saw Mr David Dunn approach a car. A
shot rang out and he staggered, then fell back.
Mrs Stewart, a housewife, of Eskdale Court, Bonnyrigg, was giving
evidence at the trial in the High Court in Edinburgh of Mr Robert Smith,
33, Mr Gerald McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland, 25.
They have denied murdering retired mining engineer Mr Dunn, 63, of
Dalhousie Drive, Bonnyrigg, by shooting him on the body in the Polton
Street car park, in Bonnyrigg, on October 19 last year.
They are also accused of robbing the Bank of Scotland branch in the
High Street of #185,000.
They have also denied attempting to murder police constable John Duffy
and two other men, Mr Duncan Milliken and Mr John Girdler.
Mrs Stewart said she had gone into the centre of Bonnyrigg that day
with her two young children and her sister to attend a health centre.
They parked in the Polton Street car park, and then heard shouting and
saw men run past them. They were shouting: ''Bastards, they have just
robbed the bank.''
A silver car arrived, and seemed to be revving quite a lot, but then
it stalled and stopped. A man wrestling with the driver succeeded in
getting him out.
Mrs Stewart said she heard the first of two shots as the driver's door
was opened and she thought it came from the front of the car. The second
shot rang out and Mr Dunn fell.
The trial before Lord Osborne continues.

THE woman who drew up bills at an Edinburgh law firm received a
written warning for altering an advocate's fee note.
Miss Elaine Houghton told Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday that her
boss, David Stevenson, now on trial for fraud, was not pleased when he
found out what she had done.
Miss Houghton said she didn't know what to do when Lothian Regional
Council's law department demanded to see the fee note so that they could
check the bill from Robin Thompson and Partners.
It turned out that the amount asked for by Robin Thompson and Partners
was more than the advocate had charged them in the first place,
according to the fee note.
She told the jury that her boss, David Stevenson, was not in the
office that day and she just changed the fee note.
''I don't know why I did it,'' she said.
Mr Stevenson, 43, and Mr Lawrence Lumsden, 38, whose addresses are
given as c/o Robin Thompson and Partners, Castle Street, Edinburgh, are
on trial charged with fraud.
They both deny overcharging other solicitors 13 times between December
1985 and May 1992 and gaining #2673.09 when recovering the expenses of
successful legal actions.
At the time, they were the partners responsible for costs and finance.
Miss Houghton said that after the incident and the written warning she
received a memo with instructions to change her billing system.
The amount stated on bills for advocates' fees was now to be the same
as that stated on the advocates' fee notes to Robin Thompson and
Partners.
The trial, before Sheriff Andrew Lothian, continues next week.

A DOCTOR gave a stark warning to young people considering taking
so-called leisure drugs like ecstasy: ''Do it and you risk losing your
life. It's like pointing a loaded revolver at your head and pulling the
trigger.''
Dr Leo Murray, accident and emergency consultant at Ayr Hospital, was
speaking on the fourth day of a fatal accident inquiry at Ayr Sheriff
Court into the deaths of Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock, Ayrshire,
and Mr Andrew Dick, 19, from Glasgow, on May 1 last year and of Mr
Andrew Stoddart, 20, from Rigside, Lanarkshire, on August 21.
All three died after taking ecstasy while attending the Hanger 13
nightclub in Ayr.
Dr Murray, 40, told of the efforts he and his colleagues made to save
the lives of John Nisbet and Andrew Dick, but said that Andrew Stoddart
was effectively dead when he reached the hospital.
The consultant said John Nisbet had a heart rate three times the
normal and was very hot. His pupils were dilated, indicating brain
malfunction.
''There was circumstantial evidence to suggest that he was ill because
of the effect of drugs . . . we contacted the toxins unit at Guy's
Hospital in London and they confirmed the treatment we had started as
intravenous fluids and the administration of a drug called Dantrolene,''
he added.
Dr Murray said he was still in the department when a second young man,
later identified as Andrew Dick, was brought in from Hanger 13. ''We
were prepared as the ambulance service had alerted us . . . his symptoms
were similar to the other young man.''
In the case of Andrew Stoddart, Dr Murray said there were no vital
signs when he arrived and he was declared dead at 1.20am.
Asked by Sheriff Neil Gow, QC, what he thought had caused the deaths,
Dr Murray said that, in all three, a condition known as disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC) had played a part.
He explained that the effect of drugs led to an inability of the body
to clot blood properly. ''In essence, after a while, the body becomes
wrecked as vital systems break down.''
Dr Boyd Meiklejohn, 39, consultant anaesthetist at Ayr Hospital, said
that John Nisbet and Andrew Dick were admitted to the high-dependency
unit and placed on ventilators. John Nisbet died at 11.30am on May 1 and
Andrew Dick died 12 hours later.
Consultant pathologist Dr Ruth Adamson carried out post-mortem
examinations on all three men and found the effects of DIC in all three.
She said John Nisbet had died of respiratory distress syndrome and both
Andrew Dick and Andrew Stoddart of pulmonary oedema, or the effect of
fluid in the lungs. In her opinion, all three deaths were as a result of
the toxic effect of drugs.
Mr Fraser McIntyre, 21, of Racecourse View, Ayr, said he was manager
of the Pavilion in which Hanger 13 is based and that, since the deaths,
paramedics, a standby ambulance, and closed-circuit surveillance had all
been introduced.
Asked by Mr Jack Drummond, representing the family of the late Andrew
Stoddart, if he thought it necessary to search staff before entering the
club, he replied: ''No, our selection procedures should ensure there are
no problems that way.''
The inquiry continues.

<HEADLINE>Go-ahead for 600 green-belt homes    Lang overrides ban on builders</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Secretary Lang has upheld a planning appeal by Wimpey Homes,
and is allowing the firm to build 600 houses on green-belt land despite
local protests.
Strathclyde Regional Council and Labour-controlled Strathkelvin
District Council had rejected the plan because of fears of flooding, and
of overcrowding being caused in local schools.
Mr Gordon Sutherland, Strathkelvin's depute director of planning, said
yesterday that the council was considering whether to refer the matter
to the Court of Session.
''We don't consider that the Wimpey Homes application is in accord
with the local plan or structure plan,'' he said. ''It is also against,
in many respects, the wishes of a considerable number of objectors in
the area.''
Objectors claimed Mr Lang was ''under pressure'' to uphold the appeal
to build on 72-acres of former green-belt land near Westerhill Farm,
Bishopbriggs, because the developer had offered ''planning gain''.
This included building a #2.5m section of a by-pass, and providing
sites for a primary school, a light transport system, and community
facilities at Auchinairn Road.
The company also proposes to build 650 homes on an 80-acre site next
to the proposed development, inside the Glasgow boundary.
Fears had been expressed that the main by-pass, which it is hoped will
take traffic off the A803 through Bishopbriggs towards the M80 Stepps
by-pass, might be forced through despite a wave of local protest.
The concern is that Wester Cleddens Road, a proposed feeder route from
the by-pass, would effectively become the main ''rat run'' to
Bishopbriggs for drivers leaving the Glasgow and Stirling motorways. The
road at present serves five schools and a children's home.
Planners have already approved the south section of the road and an SL
Homes development of 1375 houses on a 168-acre site next to the proposed
Wimpey development inside the Glasgow boundary.
Mr Lang's approval is conditional upon a maximum of 200 houses being
built in advance of the operation of the relief road, and the
installation of drainage which meets the approval of the region.
Wimpey yesterday confirmed that it had agreed to provide sites for a
light transport system, retail shopping units, and a primary. However,
an education official said the prospect of the developer funding a new
school was not an option.
She said: ''We have put down a marker for extra Roman Catholic primary
school accommodation in Bishopbriggs if the housing development
proceeds.'' This would probably involve extending present facilities at
an existing school.
The cost of any extra school capacity would be met by the region or a
new unitary authority. The region is confident that sufficient future
capacity exists in secondary schools.
Mr Sam Galbraith, Labour MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, was
''outraged, but not surprised'' at Mr Lang's decision to uphold the
appeal.
He said: ''It amounts to another tragic erosion of the green belt
which are the lungs of communities. If we are not careful these
communities will merge and will lose their identities.''
Local regional councillor Tom Rae said: ''The decision amounts to the
Scottish Secretary taking planning decisions from local authorities and
placing them in the hands of the private sector.''
Mr David Hunter, secretary of the Bishopbriggs branch of the Scottish
Liberal Democrats, said that many residents thought Wimpey's offer to
build the by-pass should never have been allowed to be part of the
planning application. He argued that the area did not have the
infrastructure to support another large housing development and claimed
local schools were ''already bursting at the seams''.

THE FACTS OF LIFE: The Creation of Sexual Knowledge in Britain,
1650-1950
By Roy Porter and Lesley Hall
Yale, #19.95 (pp 415)
Just how do we learn about sex? As practice does not necessarily make
perfect, theory frequently attempts to fill in the gaps in our
knowledge. Fired up by Foucault's theory that theory determines the
facts of life, Roy Porter and Lesley Hall look at theories put forward
in popular sex guides in English since the seventeenth century.
This stimulating survey (''the book as we have conceived it'') takes a
long hard look at the father of all such sex manuals: Aristotle's
Master-Piece which first appeared in English in 1684 and was still
regarded as a handy book to have about the house when I was a growing
lad in Edinburgh.
Aristotle's Master-Piece was not by Aristotle but by various anonymous
hands though Porter and Hall say the medical populariser William Salmon
may ''have had some hand in it''. And the book was not considered a
masterpiece for long enough. D'Arcy Power, a surgeon, spoke for many
when in 1931 he savaged it as ''an hoary old debauchee acknowledged by
no-one''.
Porter and Hall, however, defend it as an intellectually impressive
and admirably didactic work. It relieved sexual stress by encouraging
couples to enjoy intercourse as a perfectly natural expression of
passionate love, advised them to ''make their mutual embraces most
effectual'', assured them sex was the nearest thing to heaven on earth.
Thus sex reared its lovely head in Aristotle's Master-Piece and in
such subsequent publications as James Graham's pamphlet, Lecture on the
Generation, Increase and Improvement of the Human Species (1780). An
Edinburgh physician, Graham believed sexual happiness was synonymous
with sanity, claiming: ''The genitals are the true pulse, and infallible
barometer of health.'' He advised others to practise what he preached in
the Celestial Bed he designed -- ''***it*** is 12ft long by 9ft wide,
supported by forty pillars of brilliant glass'' -- and rented out at a
rate of #50 per night. Since Graham attached magnets to his Celestial,
or Magnetico-electrico, Bed, the experience was supposed to be
positively electrifying.
But there was a negative side to Graham's search for sexual
perfection. By equating sexual athleticism with good health he ''sowed
the seeds of fear'', according to Porter and Hall. Poorly people,
including many poor folk who could not afford to stump up 50 nicker for
a night on the Celestial Bed, became increasingly convinced that illness
indicated some sexual flaws -- and faults -- in themselves. After all,
the great Graham warned that ''certain solitary practices or bad habits
. . . debilitate the bodies, and it is to be feared, damn the souls of
boys and girls, or of the young men and young women''. Such
scaremongering is one of the reasons Foucault held up two fingers to the
Enlightenment.
After Graham, who should be respected as an intelligent man with the
courage of his idiosyncratic convictions, came a deluge of books by men
determined to do dirt on sex. Ebenezer Sibly's Medical Mirror (1792)
suggested that sickly adolescent girls were sexually sick. William
Brodum's Guide to Old Age (1795) condemned ''excess of libidinous
indulgence'' in what he clearly saw as a dangerously permissive society.
Samuel Solomon's Guide to Health (1800) banged on about the medical
horrors that came to those ''addicted to Onanism''.
Sex was treated as a sin by quacks and, as Porter and Hall put it,
''Quackery helped contribute to the culture of sexuality, and indeed
sexology, by providing a lively focus for formulations on a subject upon
which regular biomedical science was sometimes unwilling to speak.'' And
quackery kept on rearing its ugly head. In a book, On Spermatorrhoea
(1872), John Laws Milton advised his readers to take action against
nocturnal emissions and masturbation by placing a spiked ring on the
penis or applying a device which answered an erection with an electrical
alarm. Many Victorian men were alarmed.
One Victorian man, who suffered from the ignorant assumptions of his
time, lived to tell the tale to Marie Stopes who is one of the most
attractive figures in this book. It is easy to poke fun at the
self-righteous Stopes, at least Muriel Spark found it easy when she made
a cruelly memorable gag about the birth-control pioneer in her
autobiography: ''I used to think it a pity that her mother rather than
she had not thought of birth control.'' Still, Stopes liberated men as
well as women in her classic Married Love (1918) which, like Aristotle's
Master-Piece, is still worth reading.
The Facts of Life is well worth reading. Scholarly in scope it is also
affirmative and, yes, exciting in its penetrating exploration of a
provocative subject.

OUR MAN IN . . .
By Clive Anderson
BBC publications, #16.99 (pp 240)
SOMEWHERE within the covers of this TV tie-in lurks the germ of an
idea for an important book and, things being what they are in the
wonderful world of the media, an even more important television series.
Beneath the glossy pictures, the limp gags, and the self-deprecatory
smugness that is Clive Anderson's speciality, the proposition is
advanced that modern life, and holidays in particular, are a very bad
idea.
Environmentalists have been saying so for years, of course, but since
they commence from a position of absolute virtue -- that the least human
beings do by way of existing is the best they can do -- the assault on
leisure has hitherto made little ground among the migratory mob. Now
holidaymakers themselves, desiring nothing more shocking than a
fortnight away from the daily grind, are beginning slowly to notice the
damage they do. Evidence accumulates of a horrible irony: that we
destroy the things we slave and save to enjoy just by travelling to
enjoy them.
Towards the end of his chapter on Goa, Anderson remarks: ''Tourism,
someone told me, is now the biggest industry in the world.'' Someone was
right: the travel trade is all that and more, capable of being
construed, without much hyperbole, as the new imperialism, a continuing
process of invasion and despoliation on a scale more vast than anything
the British Empire ever conceived. Modern tourism will have more lasting
impact than any war, and has more influence on economies and foreign
policies than any ideology. It means no real harm, like a virus without
evil intent, but it kills its hosts.
Television involves a similar contradiction, and as Anderson
shamefacedly admits, ''. . . making a TV programme and writing a book
about a place like Goa, even though they focus on the problems of
tourism, is likely to attract more people than it repels . . . So I am
part of the problem and not the solution.''
That contradiction is also part of his book's problem. This
good-looking volume is part reportage, part jaunty travelogue, and part
a serious investigation of issues with profound implications. What are
we supposed to do? Stay at home? And what then of the countries --
Scotland prominent among them -- living in the belief that only the
tourist dollar saves them from penury? Is development always bad? Must
the world become ever more homogenised? Anderson raises the issues but
prefers, for the most part, to supply the drolleries demanded of his
prime-time TV persona than to address them.
The travel trade pops up again and again as a thread in the book's
general, weary theme of ''trouble in paradise''. Here we have the
encroachment of the modern world on Kenya's Maasai Mara; Dominica caught
in the machinations of the world banana market; socialist Cuba crushed
by America and deserted by its children; the movement for autonomy in
ruined Hawaii; the war between loggers and conservationists in Oregon.
Insatiable Western society is depicted as consuming, literally and
spiritually, the beautiful places and things it most admires.
This is an important idea, largely because its ramifications have yet
to be explored fully, and you get the impression that Anderson might
have preferred to investigate it in more depth than he has -- even the
trite title was a compromise -- but the ''recognition factor''
afflicting a chat-show host overwhelms him. Good, serious passages
invariably give way to the cute, the quaint, and the relentlessly
''entertaining''. Our Man In . . . is itself almost a parable of the
processes it investigates.
The book reads like five long magazine articles. Anderson's TV voice
intrudes continually -- ''The other vehicles . . . are mostly Ladas.
Lada cars, stretch Ladas, Lada taxis. Taken and driven away, no doubt,
by Lada louts.''
In the end, you feel Our Man sensed he was on to something but
couldn't decide quite what it was, how it might be dramatised, or how
the result might be sold to the vast sedentary audience watching while
they planned their two weeks in the sun. The photographs, on the other
hand, are pretty as postcards.

THE AFTERLIFE AND OTHER STORIES
By John Updike
Hamish Hamilton, #14.99 (pp 316)
IN the title story, Carter Billings says, ''The Big Guy is getting our
range.'' Updike is suddenly ageing. Of course, it has its compensations.
Foreign travel is on the agenda; but cash and success bring little
comfort, for nothing can take these characters where they want to be,
back in their pasts, 30 golden years ago.
Each of the 22 stories carries the desolation of late middle age, a
lack of expectancy, and the antagonisms of minor ailments which could
presage something serious. The Grim Reaper hovers on the For Sale signs
hung outside homes of the recently departed.
Those who remain, with blinkered determination, take up a hobby
they've always fancied, but life is not what it used to be. What with
AIDS and shopping malls and the ozone layer: ''We live in plague
times,'' an old man says. Memory surfaces with a surge of joy.
The men tease each other over their inability to perform. They shuffle
rather than walk and are often bullied by their wives into doing what
they do not want to do, taking exercise or digging their gardens. They
are revealed for what they always were, wee boys, lonely and adrift, now
having to deal with grown-up things for which they have had no
preparation and with nothing to fall back on.
Which exposes Updike's main weakness. His women have always had a
single function. When that function is reduced, impaired, or even
obliterated, he can give them neither character nor a past. Even
conversation can be difficult. His men imagine what women are like,
mostly physically. They do not know.
His strength has always been the way he explores family ties and the
ways in which his characters are defined by their ordinary expectations.
Where these combine he approaches tenderness, as elderly men try to come
to terms with their dead or dying mothers, with the cord being cut.
In ''The Other Side of the Street'' a man returns to his childhood
home to bury his mother, indulging in his cherished dream that life was
better in the house across the road. On the way back, his former house
is ablaze, ''. . . the porchlight and front-room lamps were lit up as if
to welcome a visitor, a visitor, it seemed to him, long expected and
much beloved.''
In ''A Sandstone Farmhouse'' Joey returns to the place his recently
deceased mother bought to avoid the suffocation of suburbia. He sees the
house as a betrayal. Sifting through her things, he realises the
resentment he has carried since childhood. He also ''. . . discovered
himself talking aloud, as if in response to a friendly presence just
behind the dry old wallpaper, within the thick stone walls.''
Many of these stories seem mechanical, written to order, prompted by
New Yorker deadlines. An occasional piece bears flashes of his former
self or shows his new concerns.
''The Man Who Became a Soprano'' is vintage Updike, a brilliant story
which almost defies summary. A 10-strong recorder group are followed
from their beginnings to a concert in the Congregational Church's parish
hall. The final piece is ''Silent Night''. The continuing sexual
tensions and involvements are meticulously plotted and traced down to
the final detail of the group taking their bow feeling ''cherished as
children are cherished, just for being themselves'' knowing their glory
is over.
In the opening title story, Jane and Carter Billings visit friends who
have transplanted themselves to the Norfolk Fens, where they paint,
watch birds, and involve themselves in village life. Carter loses his
footing in his friend's old house and almost tumbles downstairs, the
sense of reprieve jolts him into a heightened awareness of the world
around him, and makes him voyage into a storm to buy a gift for Jane,
surprised and amused at his host's astonishment that the man didn't know
''they were beyond all that now''.

THE MEDITERRANEAN AND THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLD IN THE REIGN OF PHILIP
II
By Fernand Braudel
HarperCollins, #14.99 (pp 690)
THIS famous book is now nearly half a century old, and a new English
edition amply vindicates its place as one of the most brilliant
historical works of modern times. The original translation of 1972 ran
to 1375 pages. So you get just about half of it in this abridgement by
Richard Ollard. The price is anyway astounding by today's standards, and
in itself deserves to win the volume its intended wide readership.
What made the book famous is the richness of its total history, a term
which Braudel, if he did not invent it, certainly defined. His focus, on
the end of the sixteenth century, is apparently narrow. The point of
departure is the ebbing of a struggle between two great powers, the
Spanish and the Ottoman Empires, which had been contending for control
from opposite ends of the Mediterranean.
Out of this Braudel weaves a vast tapestry of many strands and
textures, bringing to light every conceivable aspect of life in a
vibrant and colourful region. For once, formidable scholarship is
fascinating to follow.
Still, it is worth noting that Braudel did not after all cover
everything. This volume, more lavishly illustrated than the previous
ones, includes among the pictures selected by the editor two from a book
by William Lithgow, a young Scot who went on a journey all round the
Middle East in 1612. One has him in a raffish Turkish turban, the other
shows him tied up by Moldavian bandits threatening to murder him.
Happily they did not, and Lithgow survived to come home and write up
his adventures, which were in their time a best-seller. But Braudel
himself seems to have been unaware of it. The only Scots he mentioned in
his text were Catholic deserters to the Spanish navy after 1560, and
unfortunates who turned up in the slave market of Algiers, probably
after corsairs' raids on the Western Isles of which no record otherwise
survives.
Such details are typical of how Braudel evokes the worldwide
connections of the Mediterranean in his period. They stretched from the
Americas to China, yet could not sustain the region's earlier economic
leadership. It was no longer a centre but a periphery, a frontier
between Europe and Africa, between East and West, between Christianity
and Islam. Not, indeed, since the Roman Empire had it formed a unity.
By now the peoples round its shores often regarded each other as
utterly alien. Even so, the facts of geography and climate often imposed
similar patterns on their lives. To follow these eternal affinities
through the comparatively trivial rise and fall of men and states is the
great allure of Braudel's achievement.

TO THE DEATH, AMIC
By John Bryson
Hamish Hamilton, #14.99 (pp )
THE Spanish Civil War is unique in terms of the interest it elicited
from artists and activists. It drew a strong Scottish response. One
quarter of the British Battalion of the International Brigade hailed
from Scotland, and half of the Scottish contingent were from Glasgow. My
own father was a volunteer who was captured at the Battle of Jarama and
held prisoner for six months. The whole event has been poeticised to the
point where it has arguably lost its political relevance. Literature
made it, but it also dated it faster than history could have wished.
Given the war's exposure in art, there is something startlingly
original about John Bryson's novel, based on the life of a Catalan
anarchist named Enrique. Bryson captures beautifully the heroism and
hypocrisy, corruption and compromise of this, and any other war, from a
child's eye perspective, and that of an insider. The struggle here is
for the home front.
Enrique has a twin, Josep, through whom he is able to watch himself
growing up, and the novel is a meditation on ideas of brotherhood,
family, solidarity, and community in adversity. A recurring question is:
''Who was loyal?'' The crowd gathered round a public list of those
''held for questioning'' parts for a woman in whose cry they recognise a
common fear: ''Few here were so sure of their kin that they might not
have had to make the same blatant journey.'' One is constantly made to
feel that from the inside, as it were, this war is less a struggle
between good and evil than a conflict that involves a complex matrix of
alliances and enmities, traversing social and cultural boundaries.
The aphoristic style is at its best in the stunning account of the
German bombing of the Basque valley township of Guernica. The key to its
emotional power lies in the versatility of the prose, at once engaged
and dispassionate. The banality of the violence, its brutal incursion
into an everyday scene, is shocking.
Then there is the soldier who is measured by Enrique's Papa, the
tailor, for a suit he will wear for a bride he has yet to choose when
the war is over. Cut to flatter his unathletic frame, it adorns a model
at the shop door, testament to an Unknown Soldier. When Paper is caught
in a blast Enrique searches for fragments ''behind the tender pouches of
his pinched lids with a toothpick softened in my own mouth''. There were
many times reading this novel that I felt myself in need of such tender
ministration.
Bryson highlights the gap between sloganeering and survival. The
narrative negotiates the narrow isthmus between the rhetoric of defiance
and the reality of defeat. Newsboards proudly proclaiming the resistance
of Madrid jar with the voice of La Pasionaria crying ''No Pasaran''.
Enrique asks wryly: ''What need of rhetoric does she have if the fascist
have failed?'' The football stadium is converted to a refugee camp, and,
in the face of a triumphalism that is out of sync with local experience,
Enrique finds ''scrawled above a filthy urinal, the slogan: Withdraw the
Forwards to the Goal Line''.
The simultaneous preponderance and impotence of propaganda is amply
illustrated in the cartoons of Franco smeared with slogans: ''Stone his
cheek, but his lips never give a tremble. Tear out an eye, the other
looks on. Imprisoned by graffiti he is stoical, as a man justified by
noble resolve. We were permitting him courage beyond the reality of
life.''
The emotional farewell to the International Brigades is also a
farewell to a certain kind of activism, and a ''courage beyond the
reality of life''. Of La Pasionaria's speech Enrique asks: ''What poet
would chance lines of such finery?'' Meanwhile, Papa ensures that the
passports of dead Brigaders are inherited by refugees. It is one of the
many paradoxes of this deeply moving novel that it tells us in the most
exquisite and extraordinary language that heroism is ordinary.
Disturbingly, so too is the hardship that engenders it.

THE retrospective at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in
Edinburgh of the work of Sir James Gunn -- the Glasgow-born artist --
has it all.
A society painter renowned for his studies of famous folk (including
royals and Prime Ministers), he was knighted for services to the arts a
year before his death at the age of 71 in 1964.
Since the show opened, every facet of the exhibition -- the excellent
food in the gallery's Queen Street Cafe, and the quality merchandise
which accompanies it -- has been reviewed. All but the marvellous
clothes.
Which is strange, because even those people who claim to know nothing
about art can see from this retrospective that what is being worn in the
pictures is almost as important as the people who were being painted,
particularly in the case of the artist's stunning wife, Pauline.
Not surprisingly, it is a portrait of Pauline Gunn in a splendid
yellow dress, painted in 1944, which has been chosen for the cover of
the exhibition catalogue, rather than one of Hilaire Belloc, Sir William
Darling, or Harold Macmillan.
The painting, which shows Pauline seated in an armchair cuddling one
of a pair of white lap-dogs, was bought for #1000 within an hour of
going on show at the Royal Academy in London. A fellow artist,
apparently jealous of Gunn's popularity with the public, dismissed it as
''cheap and photographic'' but it became known as the Mona Lisa of 1944
and was later voted picture of the year.It is a feast for the eyes.
Gunn paid great attention to such detail as the intricate pattern on
the dress (possibly painted by his assistant?), a diamante belt buckle,
trimming of black velvet ribbon and Pauline's jewellery and make-up,
including the scarlet nail varnish that can be seen through her
open-toed black suede shoes.
Pauline, born in 1901, daughter of an architect, worked for Elizabeth
Arden in London and Rome until her marriage in 1929 and, in all the
portraits of her, is never seen looking less than immaculate with
beautifully coiffed hair, finely shaped eyebrows, scarlet lips, and
nails to match.
In 1945, the artist painted his wife in a gorgeous evening coat, of
crimson velvet printed with gold, designed by Fortuny and bought by the
couple in Venice. With it, Pauline wears an intricate necklace and
earring set, which is also on show in its original box, at the
exhibition.
In 1946, four years before her painful death from cancer at the age of
49, Pauline is portrayed in the Macleod tartan (Sir James's
great-grandmother was a Macleod), made up not into a common-or-garden
kilt, but a stylish frock with fluted sleeves and extravagant collar and
cuffs in rich, black velvet.
An earlier painting, dating from 1939, shows Pauline apparently
waiting at the swish London hotel, Claridges, rigged out in a
fashionable black coat with matching pillbox hat, veil, gloves,
umbrella, and handbag, the ensemble set off by a fur piece, diamante
brooch and earrings.
Commenting on the subject, Cloe Blackburn, daughter of the artist,
told me: ''The reality behind these lovely pictures -- and he painted
her many more times over the 21 years of their marriage -- was hard work
on both their parts. Anyone who has sat for their portrait even once
will know this. All dressed up and in the studio at nine o'clock in the
morning!''
No Bohemian himself, Gunn was the son of a successful Glasgow tailor
-- which probably goes a long way to explaining his love of good clothes
-- and always dressed in black jacket, tie and pinstriped trousers when
painting.
* The exhibition continues at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery
until February 26.

Bra Wars: this year marks the first anniversary of Gossard's Ultrabra.
Its launch signalled an escalation of the battle with Playtex, maker of
Wonderbra. Anvar Khan reports on how the main rivals and other
manufacturers are measuring up
THE Bra Wars haven't had as much press as any other conflict in the
world at present, but they are no less real. There are civilian
casualties, namely women. The fact is that breasts feed babies. The
protagonists are sympathetic. Every adult ''babe'' too, they say, should
have a full and heaving set.
The Japanese went in for a little foot-binding because they believed
that the prettiest part of the body should be kept small. They do it
with trees, and call it the art of Bonsai; with TVs and CDs, and call it
technological advancement. (Enough -- Ed.)
But Western culture is obsessed with making possessions bigger not
smaller. Big house, big car, big bust. And for those women, who look as
if breast-binding was a parental compulsion, there is an answer. In the
name of democracy and human rights, in an attempt to make a large bosom
accessible to all women, a British bra manufacturer came up with an
underwired brassiere called the Wonderbra. And it sells over 20,000 a
week. The Wonderbra does not need the endorsement of the royal family,
but as The Guardian recently suggested, Princess Di may be wearing one
too.
The underwired bra can be best explained by a certain Dimitri Tiomkin
ditty. Its sole remit is to round 'em up, push 'em out . . . Rawhide!
Large breasts have a primeval magnetism, but they mean different things
on different women. On Hattie Jacques, come to mama; on Barbara Windsor,
let's have fun; on Monroe, down boy. Bras make up the largest sector of
sales in the lingerie market, worth #485m. For a slice of this, alone,
the Bra War is worth waging.
Any woman who believes in the power of sensuality can wear a cleavage.
A cleavage is boastful. It takes its revenge upon the dumb, feminist-cum
chauvinist-mentality, that women cannot be both sexual and intelligent.
A cleavage means a woman is unafraid of both attracting and/or
intimidating the opposite sex. Or even her own. In popular culture,
female icons, from Page Three pretties to the cartoon Jessica Rabbit,
are voluptuous. Only in the world of highbrow entertainment, such as The
Late Show, are leading women allowed to be seen to be flat-chested.
The current Bra War is complicated, but suitably cut 'n' thrust.
Gossard produced the Wonderbra for over 25 years until it lost its
licence to Playtex. In a strange twist, orchestrated by red tape,
bureaucracy and the pursuit of humungous profit, the company which
bought out the licencer, bought Playtex too. It then decided, of course,
not to renew Gossard's licence to produce the Wonderbra and awarded it
to Playtex itself instead.
Back at the front Gossard set about inventing the Ultrabra (#18.99),
effectively placing itself in competition with Playtex, and the bra it
previously produced as its own.
What's more, Berlei, Gossard's sister company, is currently punting
the Demi-wire (#18.99), an underwired cup which also aims to maximise
fullness.
The Bra War is an arena where various comparable products are being
self-consciously marketed by a few. But the competition is looking
healthier. Think of Gulliver surrounded by grasping Lilliputians. Asda,
Marks, and Spencer and Bhs have caught up with the giants.
George at Asda has an underwired range from #12.99, Marks and Spencer
from around #14. The new Bhs collection feature bras from #4 to #9. Bhs
is the first High Street store to offer a size range from 30AA (for
those who don't even need a bra) to 42F (to those who need to wear two).
If Gossard and Playtex are the glamour queens, the Boadicea's of the
Bra War, then Bhs is the social worker. The High Street chain has
sponsored a Breast Cancer Care leaflet offering advice on the right bra
to choose after a mastectomy.
Bra Warfare isn't fair. It's dirty. So is the current, trans-global,
billboard campaign by Playtex. Sam Fox made a career out of having a big
chest. The Playtex PR team got just as much mileage out of the model's
own. Lines include ''Look Me In The Eyes And Tell Me That You Love Me''
and ''Or Are You Just Pleased To See Me?''. The ads are streetsmart,
sassy and play on a particularly male condition which Playtex first
publicly recognised in 1994. To celebrate Ireland's entry into the World
Cup, they produced an exclusive green Wonderbra. And its slogan? ''Cup
Fever''.
THE LURE OF LINGERIE
Some fascinating facts about women and the purchase of bras:
* British women buy more underwear than any other garment, spending
#1,200,000m a year.
* The increase in separations and divorces has had a positive effect
on lingerie with women wanting to look more glamorous.
* Better nutrition and more women taking the pill has led to an
increase in size from an average of 34B to 36C.
* Underwired bras account for 50% of sales.

BRIDALWEAR designers Aileen Sherry and Ishbel Mackay, who trade under
the name Toadilboney!, are so good that even when they created a wedding
gown from wallpaper, people wanted to buy it.
Aileen Sherry explained: ''We'd bought some #1.99-a-roll wallpaper for
the fitting rooms and as there was some left over, I decided to make it
up into a dress for the window display.''
Soon a prospective customer appeared, saying she would be bringing her
daughter along to ''try on that dress in the window''.
Not made from wallpaper but from antique-look silk, gold lace and
fabric roses, was the Toadilboney! gown which recently won Best Scottish
Design in the Best of British Bridal Awards. It was called Helena after
the actress, Helena Bonham Carter, because it looked like something she
might wear in one of her costumey films.
''Bridal dresses usually have names,'' said Sherry, ''but they're
normally rather pretentious-sounding ones like Assumpta. As a reaction
to that, we like to give our dresses sensible, Scottish names like Morag
and Fiona. So Helena was a bit of a departure.''
Demand has increased so much that the company, which is now in its
fifth year, is to introduce a ready-to-wear range which will be
available from selected bridalwear shops both north and south of the
Border.

TELEVISION'S The Clothes Show makes sense of the fashion industry,
that is its remit. It focuses on the latest gear, but unlike self-styled
gurus and designer groupies, it refuses to be sidetracked into analysis
of lifestyle. Instead, it concentrates on simple reportage: who, where,
why, and when. And how.
While the programme covers the usual minority sports -- being a
supermodel or an international couturier -- it also pays serious
attention to the members of the major league, the people who buy.
The presenters of this consumer affair, which returns to BBC1
tomorrow, understand the psychology of the punter (that everyone wants
to look gorgeous), something that eludes big-name designers.
Caryn Franklin, Brenda Emmanus and Jeff Banks are unafraid of getting
dirty; forsaking Naomi to hobnob with Joe Bloggs on public transport
(February 19), investigating the hidden world of pattern-cutters (March
19), but they are particularly bright on the mechanics of the industry
they are doing the favour of promoting.
Tomorrow, Brenda Emmanus visits Australia and Korea on the trail of
the world's most expensive fabric, and follows the shearing of the
merino sheep -- so cossetted they're given raincoats to protect their
fleece -- through the process that turns wool into suit lengths that can
fetch #15,000 apiece.
She also attends the creation of a suit cut from the cloth at tailors
Gieves and Hawkes. The edition also noses in on looks for spring.

HOWARD DAVIES, Director General of the Confederation of British
Industry, said yesterday: ''Something odd happened to income
distribution in the UK at the end of the 1970s.'' Very coy, that. What
he means is that in 1979 the Tories came back in, and the gap between
top and bottom incomes started widening.
So much can be agreed, even by those who, like Davies, do not
especially care to spell it out. It is anyway set forth in detail by the
report from the Rowntree Foundation which he helped to write and which
he was commenting on. Apart from anything else, this result was an
object of Tory policy.
But how odd was it? It did break a trend. Since 1945 the relationship
between top and bottom incomes in Britain had scarcely changed. There
were, from time to time, draconian regimes of taxation. Denis Healey
promised to squeeze the rich till the pips squeaked. But as an exercise
in the decisive redistribution of income these regimes failed. After a
third of a century of the welfare state, incomes had not become
significantly more equal, though they had not become less equal either.
That might seem a reasonable outcome, except there was a price. It may
be a simplified, but not an inaccurate, description of fiscal policy
during those decades to say that only when all other claims had been
settled -- for the expenses of the state itself, for the pay of its
mushrooming workforce, for its countless speculative social and economic
schemes, for demands from proliferating pressure groups, for such moral
principles as the governments espoused -- only then could we even begin
to consider how to deploy the remaining resources so as to make
ourselves richer.
The consequence was a top marginal tax rate of 83% and the worst
economy in the Western world. Other nations first created the wealth,
then redistributed it. We tried, and failed, to do the opposite. We had
the equality. They had the income.
At the CBI, an active participant in the corporate state, all this
doubtless seemed normal, so of course Davies finds something odd about
the deviation since 1979. Others might perceive a return to sanity.
Anyway, the Conservatives set out to reduce the role of the state,
open up the field for private enterprise and let people keep more of the
income and wealth they were creating, in the hope that they would have
an incentive to create more. No policy works out perfectly, but by and
large this one succeeded.
Britain enjoyed eight consecutive years of growth in real terms,
something that had not been achieved since 1870, and the growth was
usually higher than in our main competitor countries.
If prosperity causes a widening in the distribution of income, then
this may be a price worth paying. The alternative is to starve -- and
perhaps kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
But averages do conceal different experiences. The Rowntree Report
points especially to the poorest 10% of the population, which has seen
no rise in its real income. If this is true -- and some economists
dispute it -- it may have to do with the tying of benefits to the rate
of inflation. The remedy would lie either in generating still faster
growth so as to bring these people off benefits, and into the workforce,
or else even better targeting of benefits to pay more in real terms to
those who truly need them.
Still, we need not look far above this underclass to see the
trickle-down effects of prosperity which the Rowntree Report denies. At
the start of the period it covers, a household one quarter of the way up
the range of income distribution disposed, at today's prices of about
#120 a week.
By 1992, this figure rose to nearer #140. The rise for a household
three-quarters of the way up the range was from #230 to #320 a week. The
rich have got very much richer, but the poor have got somewhat richer
too. Only in relative terms did the poor lose ground.
This brings us to the heart, or what ought to be the heart, of the
debate about the distribution of income in Britain. The basic question
is whether the Government can actually control it, short of a Stalinist
apparatus of intervention. The suspicion that such control is beyond the
power of any government in an otherwise liberal economy rests on the
argument that wages -- the price of labour -- are in principle like the
price of everything else on sale.
They are set by supply and demand, their level moves according to the
conditions of supply and demand, and there relative level changes all
the time because those conditions vary so much in each case. We do not
worry that lobster is dearer than bread. Why should we worry that one
man is paid more than another if his work commands, on that principle, a
higher wage?
Yet it is alarming if whole groups of men and women are excluded from
the advantages of a free economy, in the way and for the reasons that
the Rowntree Report outlines. For those who must depend on the state, we
can make the system of benefits operate better. For those able to work,
we should rely on making our economy grow faster, as in the 1980s we
managed to do. So long as their wages rise in real terms from year to
year, as for the vast majority they have risen, we should not worry when
others' wages rise faster. The rest, the matter of relative incomes, is
none of the state's business, any more than the relative price of bread
and lobster.
At any rate, governments have never succeeded for long in setting or
altering those relativities. It is at best stupid and at worst wicked
for governments to try to do, or promise to do, what in fact they cannot
do.

SOMEWHERE across the heart of Glasgow lies a line. It's not straight
or even and you can't see it, but it's there. On one side 44.7% of the
city's populace live in relative or, occasionally, sublime comfort. On
the other, 55.3% live in areas of acute multiple deprivation.
New statistics to be published next month by Strathclyde Regional
Council have found that the number of people living in poverty in the
region is continuing to rise. The figures will reinforce the recent
Rowntree report which found a clear and ever-thickening line between
rich and poor in the UK.
Sally Gemmell lives below the line. She is 40, disabled, with three
teenage children and an invalid husband. Home is a two-bedroom terraced
house in the Milton area of Glasgow. Income is a range of benefits,
which she would rather not discuss.
She is somewhat bemused by the talk of lines and poverty statistics.
It's her life and she's making what she can of it.
There is a large crack running down the outside wall and the bedroom
and bathroom are riddled with dampness, but the lounge is kept warm by a
new gas fire and there are family photographs everywhere.
She claims to be satisfied with her benefits, then pauses and admits:
''I think maybe we could do with a bit more.''
Her husband, Robert, 41, a former steelworker, suffers from depression
and has not worked for some time. His medication is stacked neatly on
the mantlepiece and his heavy footsteps across the room upstairs
punctuate the conversation.
''He's had it for two or three years now. Things just get people down,
all the things that are happening around them. It's terrible. It's a bad
world we live in just now. It gets to people.''
She worries constantly about her three children and the pressures on
them from the drugs scene. Her youngest is 13 and hangs about with his
friends in nearby Possilpark.
''You have to watch all the time. I point out things on the telly and
say 'don't get into that'. Then again, you just feel you can't stop them
from doing things, you've just got to let them get on with it to some
extent.''
The family try to get away once a year, normally for a holiday at
Butlins in Skegness. The kids want to go to Blackpool this year, but
they will have to figure out if it will cost more.
They have been waiting three years for a new home, somewhere with
better access for Sally's wheelchair. She has been in the area for 12
years and doesn't want to stay.
''I wouldn't like the children to live here too long. I'd like to see
them in a better area -- you know, for families to be brought up.''
For Strathclyde Region, Sally's life is a numeral in a sheaf of
statistics and tables which make up their latest social trends survey.
The survey found that 520,686 people, or 23% of the population in
Strathclyde, were dependent on income support -- the official factor for
determining poverty. The number is up almost 11% on the last survey in
1991.
Broken down, the figures found 29% of children under 16 and 21% of
people over 60 living in households dependent on income support.
Other findings include:
* Over 63% of all tenant households in the region received housing
benefit in 1993, an increase of 8% over the last five years.
* 79% of all single parent households and over 67% of single
pensioners receive housing benefit.
* Almost 32% of primary school pupils were eligible for free school
meals in 1993/1994, an increase of 6% from 1989.
* Between 1990 and 1993 the number of primary pupils eligible for
clothing grants rose from 33% to 44%, or 88,138 children.
* In the 1993-1994 school year, 6.4% of primary school children in
Eastwood received free school meals, compared to 47.3% in Glasgow. The
same year, 10.2% of primary pupils in Eastwood received clothing grants,
compared to 60.7% in Glasgow.
* In 1993, 6% of those living in the Bearsden/Milngavie area received
housing benefit compared to 45% in Glasgow.
* In 1981 the region's lowest earners had an income amounting to 40%
of the highest earners. By 1993 it had dropped to 33%.
''Our findings are very similar to the Rowntree Report,'' said
researcher Charlie Macgregor. ''There's a deepening divide between the
better-off areas in Strathclyde and the poorer areas.''
The region, he added, has identified a co-ordinated package to tackle
the problems including housing, urban regeneration and employment
initiatives.
The latest statistics paint an overall picture, but some areas of
Strathclyde are in a particularly bleak situation. In one primary school
in Possilpark, 93% of the children receive clothing grants, in another
81% get free school meals.
The Possil area has, for many, become a prime example of the
deprivation and drugs blight afflicting parts of Glasgow.
On Balmore Road, in the heart of the district, a youth teeters
dead-eyed on the edge of the pavement, a thin stretch of spittle
spiralling from his mouth. A few streets away a small girl in a smart
red velvet coat and hat is swinging along the pavement between two
adults, her small giggles matching their leisurely strides.
For Ronnie Rodden, it is typical of the area where she has lived for
27 years. For every needle-tracked teen there's a single mum maintaining
her dignity and sense of humour in the face of pretty dismal odds.
Ronnie, 51, heads a local centre for the disabled and has watched the
Possil community sink lower as the years progressed.
''You get to a certain level and you start to believe this is as far
as I'm going to go. Maybe you can go downwards but you are never going
to go upwards. It's a real shame. There are an awful lot of good people
here. ''
Ill-health is endemic, but Ronnie worries more about the mental health
of many of her fellow residents.
''It's not mental illness, but there is a kind of depression. Where
are you going from here? We have got nothing and we will get nothing.
That's a very, very bad thing.''
Yet, despite the drugs and the blight she insists there is a lot to
love about Possil. ''A lot of people have done a lot of work here in the
last 18 to 20 years. No-one's said that's a good thing.''
Across at Possil Community Business, spokeswoman Lindsey Owens gets
frustrated that the ventures which have brought employment and some
light relief to the area are overshadowed by its public image.
''That doesn't help it. The people in Possil start believing it. If
people keep telling you you're scum and Possil is the worst place in the
world, then you'll start to believe it. They never emphasise the good
points. There's a big network of people in the area who do good work.''
Back in the disabled centre where Ronnie works a fuss is being made
over a new baby. Outside an elderly woman is flirting with the helper
lifting her into the van. ''Stop your nonsense,'' he tells her with a
giggle and and a wink.
Ronnie says she never ceases to be amazed at the sense of humour of
the people around her, no matter how desperate their circumstances.
''It's marvellous. Some of the wittiest here are some of the poorest.
I think that's what keeps them going. Sometimes it's either laugh or
slit your wrists.''
She even manages a wry smile herself when she is asked to tell the
Government what Possil needs.
''Good housing, jobs, proper jobs,'' she says,''and hope for the
people who live here that somehow things are going to get better.''
'Things just get
people down,
all the things
happening
around them.
It's a bad
world we live
in just now. It
gets to people'

Steve Bruce is Professor of Sociology
at Aberdeen University
FILM-MAKERS have no greater insight into the future than the rest of
us but their visions, more Apocalypse than Utopia, merely exaggerate
what is already there in embryo.
More often than not that future has two societies, worlds apart but
side-by-side. There is the air-conditioned world of shiny clean surfaces
and electronic gadgets, populated by tall, straight, well-dressed and
handsome people. But beyond the helium-filled, triple-glazed windows
there is the ghetto of pot-holed broken streets littered with rusting
vehicles and lit by bonfires, inhabited by stunted, filthy, and
inarticulate savages whose reason and morality has been destroyed by
drugs: a land where it is not the fittest but the most vicious who
survive.
The nightmare of the affluent urban American is to take the wrong turn
off the motorway and break down in one of those streets. The savages
will surround them, drag them from their metal cocoon, rape their
children, and tear them limb from limb.
This nightmare is already familiar to the citizens of New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia and while the inhabitants of
Bearsden and Braid Hills can still sleep undisturbed by dread of falling
into the hands of drug-crazed proles, those who know the insides of the
big British cities should already feel a shiver of recognition.
We have been here before. The cities of the eigthteenth and nineteenth
centuries had their enclaves of sin and vice which, like the furthest
corners of darkest Africa, were visited by brave explorers who returned
to frighten the middle classes with their candid reports of life in
these dens of poverty and iniquity. But we thought they had gone.
By the end of the Second World War full employment and the safety nets
of the welfare state had all but eradicated such counties of the
dispossessed. We may now be seeing them return with a vengeance.
Since the Great Depression there has been a real improvement in the
living standards of the poor, but arguably the future for social harmony
looks more bleak now than it did when George Orwell wrote his classic
''travelogue'' of 1930s poverty, The Road to Wigan Pier. The first
reason to be fearful is the hidden sting in that notion of ''relative''
deprivation. Radical free marketeers take the point that our poor as
better off than the poor of our grandparents' day to mean that the
buggers should not be grateful and stop complaining and we should feel
little responsibility for them. Perhaps. But the poor will not see it
like that.
They feel more deprived than the poor of the inter-war years because
wherever they look they are confronted by the ever brighter, ever more
glossy artefacts of our prosperity. Where the inter-war poor hung around
on the corners of streets of houses not that much sounder or warmer or
more brightly decorated than their own hovels, our poor warm themselves
in shopping centres crammed with expensive consumer goods. Worse, they
can sit in their badly heated and unsanitary council flats and watch
endless TV sitcoms of bourgeois life.
In the 30 years from Terry and June to One Foot in the Grave all
that's changed in TV representations of the normal world is that the
kitchens have become more exquisitely fitted and equipped. In an ironic
salute to a world from which they are excluded, poor teenagers can buy
cheap imitations of American Ivy League College sweatshirts and baseball
caps.
Of course, they could watch documentaries about famine in the Horn of
Africa and feel relatively privileged. But they will not. With
fatalistic resignation, pathetic envy, or seething indignation, they
will consume the glossy images of a world of consumption from which,
unless they take up robbery and drug-dealing, they are excluded.
The second reason for being fearful of our future is that the poverty
of the inter-war years was often temporary and cyclical. Along with the
elderly, families with young children were most at risk, but as the
children grew up and became wage-earners, the family moved back into the
mainstream. Many of the jobless could view their deprivation as a
temporary expulsion from the world of security and prosperity. They were
laid off now but the shipyards would soon be hiring again. There will be
no expansion of decently paid low-skill jobs in this country. In our
global economy that work is now done in poorer countries. For our poor,
being unemployed is less a setback from which they can hope to recover
and more a permanent condition.
We should not be surprised when our internal aliens turn to
destruction and self-destruction.
How can we expect people to prefer being sober to being drunk and
drugged when the illusions of chemistry are more pleasing than the real
world?
How can we expect people to rise from their beds, clean themselves,
and present a disciplined body to the world when the main result of
self-discipline is acute awareness of how little pleasure and reward the
day will bring?
How can we expect people who have little hope of sharing our comforts
to continue to share our moral standards or abide by our laws?
Those who are encouraged to want what the rest of us have but who are
denied the legitimate opportunities to acquire it will sooner or later
turn to illegitimate means.
For a while we can remain indifferent. Destroying oneself takes less
effort, imagination, and ingenuity than destroying others; doing drugs
is easier than rioting. The horizons of the poor are generally so short
that those with enough energy to victimise anyone but themselves and
their families will turn on their neighbours before they reach us.
At present, for most readers of this paper, the ill-divided world is
merely the exotic background to the scripts of such television
entertainments as NYPD and Hill Street Blues. But for our children it
may be the bitter rot in the fruit of their prosperity.
'How can we expect people who have little hope of sharing our comforts
to continue to share our moral standards or abide by our laws?'

SENIOR management of The Robert Gordon University are to meet sacked
lecturer Mrs Sheena Falconer next week to discuss the findings of an
industrial tribunal which ordered her reinstatement and awarded her
#41,000 compensation.
After 27 years' service, Mrs Falconer, of Anderson Drive, Aberdeen,
was offered redundancy from her post as a senior lecturer in the School
of Food and Consumer Studies or an alternative post as a lecturer which
would have meant putting her sister, also a lecturer, out of work.
Colleagues held a series of one-day strikes in support after her
dismissal in April 1993, and her union, the Educational Institute of
Scotland, said the tribunal's decision earlier this week vindicated its
actions and justice had been served.
The tribunal concluded that Mrs Falconer, who has started her own
clothing company in Keith, had not been made redundant because, when he
made the decision, the University Principal, Dr David Kennedy, did not
have all the relevant facts before him.
The tribunal also said the university concentrated on what it saw as
the primary component of her function to the exclusion of all else.
Yesterday, in its first response to Monday's decision, the university
expressed surprise at the tribunal's findings.
''Over a lengthy period leading up to the termination of Mrs
Falconer's employment, the university carefully considered the issues
relating to her employment with the benefit of professional advice.''
''Senior officers of the university will also be meeting Mrs Falconer
as soon as possible.''

DEFENCE Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was under heavy fire last night
following his decision to force the early retirement of Air Chief
Marshall Sir Sandy Wilson from his #95,000-a-year job.
Resentment in the services over allegations that Sir Sandy was being
made a scapegoat over the issue of #387,000 spent on renovating his
official residence spilled over into the House of Commons last night.
MPs were angered that Mr Rifkind chose to return to his Edinburgh
consitituency without making a full Commons statement.
Instead, the announcement that Sir Sandy, a former commander of RAF
Lossiemouth and -- until the row over the renovation of his official
home -- a candidate for Chief of the Air Staff, was to take early
retirement came in a written statement.
Furious Opposition MPs accused Mr Rifkind of fleeing London in the
wake of the controversy surrounding 53-year-old Sir Sandy's retirement,
at least four years earlier than he might have anticipated.
Mr Rifkind was accused of allowing junior Minister Nicholas Soames,
responsible for the Armed Forces, to take the flak.
The air chief was forced to relinquish his position as
Commander-in-Chief of RAF Training and Personnel during a stormy meeting
with Mr Rifkind on Thursday, when it was made clear by the Secretary of
State that the air chief no longer had his confidence.
Sir Sandy was shattered by the decision, said friends.
Senior colleagues could not hide their anger yesterday -- not least in
the manner the issue came into the public domain.
It is understood that, at the most, only six people at the highest
level in Government and the Civil Service were likely to have read the
#100,000 report into the cost of refurbishment. Even now, the report is
not going to be published in full.
Nevertheless, the forced early retirement of Sir Sandy was leaked to
the Daily Telegraph on Thursday.
Sir Sandy was forced to take early retirement following a report into
his official residence at Haymes Garth, near Cheltenham,
Gloucestershire.
There was criticism of Sir Sandy's lack of judgment and Mr Rifkind is
understood to have told him there was no longer confidence in his
abilities as a top-level budget holder responsible for a millions of
pounds.
Yesterday, Sir Sandy said he was taking early retirement in a bid to
relieve pressure on the RAF and his family.
''I have served the RAF loyally for 35 years and it is with great
regret that I have indicated to the Chief of the Air Staff my intention
to take early retirement,'' he said in the only public comment he has
been allowed to make on a controversy that has gone on for almost a
year.
It is understood Sir Sandy will retire officially in July with a
pension of around #50,000 a year and a lump sum payment of around
#150,000.
In the written statement, Mr Soames said later that Haymes Garth would
now be sold ''as soon as practicable''.
He emphasised that there was no question of ''illegality or culpable
impropriety'' at Haymes Garth or any of the other official residences
examined.
An audit had also found weaknesses in financial controls at several
other RAF homes, including Sir Sandy's previous house in Germany, on
which #302,000 was spent on refurbishment.
The MoD said there were ''serious systematic weaknesses in controls

residences.
Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark said it was a ''disgrace'' there
was no statement to the Commons yesterday and accused the Secretary of
State of ''cutting and running''.
He added that the issue raised ''serious questions'' about Mr
Rifkind's competence.
RAF friends of Sir Sandy said they did not question the fact that
mistakes had been made. What they were chiefly concerned about is that
Sir Sandy seems to have been made a scapegoat and the manner of the leak
to the Daily Telegraph.

NO electronic bugging devices have been found in an office provided
for Sinn Fein delegates involved in talks with Government officials at
Stormont in Belfast, police said last night.
The Sinn Fein team walked out on talks due to have been held
yesterday, claiming a scanner they had used in the room had picked up
signs of a monitoring device.
The room was sealed overnight on the orders of the Northern Ireland
Office and the RUC carried out a full search yesterday.
Nothing was found and a police spokesman said it was not unusual for
spurious readings to be given by scanners used in a building containing
a wide range of electrical equipment.
However, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said he had no confidence in
the findings.
No new date has yet been set for what would have been the sixth
meeting between Sinn Fein and officials.

TRANSPORT drivers yesterday protested against a ban on the export of
animals for slaughter.
About 40 empty transport vehicles arrived in convoy at Dover Docks,
causing long tailbacks of port and local traffic.
The protest was against Dover Harbour Board's ban on the export of
animals for slaughter and the shipping companies P&amp;O and Stena Sealink's
refusal to carry that traffic.
A crowd of 2000 animal rights protesters clashed with police in a bid
to stop the first lorry load of veal calves reaching the port at
Brightlingsea, Essex.
The town was brought to a standstill as the demonstrators blocked the
narrow road. A 78-year-old woman was arrested.
A Tory Euro-MP will ask the European Parliament next week to vote for
an immediate ban on veal crates for calves, writes Murray Ritchie,
European editor.
Mr James Provan, who was formerly the member for North-east Scotland
and who now represents an English constituency, is to call for a vote
after a European Commission statement on the veal trade during the
parliament's monthly plenary.
Mr Provan, an animal welfare campaigner, also wants maximum journey
times for animals being transported from Britain to slaughterhouses on
the Continent.
Most British Euro-MPs are expected to support the move.

Ayrshire MP George
Foulkes yesterday accused ScottishPower of ''chickening out'' of a
direct confrontation with him on the proposed electrical interconnector
between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Mr Foulkes was speaking after giving evidence at the public inquiry at
Ayr into the interconnector proposed by ScottishPower and Northern
Ireland Electricity.
In his evidence, Mr Foulkes, MP for Cumnock and Doon Valley, through
which the interconnector will pass, claimed that ScottishPower had
failed to demonstrate a clear need for the project at any stage since it
was first mooted.
ScottishPower's claim that the project would help address the economic
disadvantages of Northern Ireland and supply it with low-cost
electricity have been shown to be totally inaccurate, the MP contended.
He went on to say that the excuses put forward by the STUC, which is
backing the proposal -- that jobs in the Scottish coal industry would be
safer -- had only to be looked at in the context of ScottishPower's
''abysmal'' record in supporting Scottish coal in the past few years.
In his evidence to the inquiry yesterday, South of Scotland MEP Alex
Smith called into question ScottishPower and NIE claims that their
proposals accorded with the energy policies of the European Union.
Mr Smith said that an important EU objective is competition -- but
suggested that this appears to have been given little priority when the
interconnector proposal was put together.
The inquiry continues next week.

TWO airline executives, who defrauded their employer of hundreds of
thousands of pounds, were jailed yesterday.
Commercial manager Paul Massey, 53, and his deputy Alan Curtis, 49,
admitted conspiring to defraud Britannia Airways while working at its
central London office.
Massey, of Swabey Road, Earlsfield, south-west London, was jailed for
18 months and Curtis, of Harewood Gardens, Littledown, Bournemouth, for
eight months at Southwark Crown Court by Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC.
The pair stole the money by recruiting travel broker Henry Wolff, 69,
and taking 50% of the commissions the airline paid him for arranging
charter flights.
Wolff, of Marsh Road, Pinner, Middlesex, was jailed for eight months
for his part in the plot, suspended for two years because of his
relatively minor role.
Massey was said to have used some of the money to buy expensive homes
abroad. The court had heard that he operated several Swiss bank accounts
in different currencies. The main one, used to pay Curtis his cut, was
found to contain #216,000.
Curtis -- said to have been less involved in the plot -- gained
#100,000 from his part in the scheme, which ran for four years until
1991.
Mr David Farrer QC, prosecuting, said the plot came to an end after
they tried to involve another travel broker in their scheme.
After discovering the plot, the airline launched a successful civil
action to recover its losses.

RESIDENTS of a housing scheme, where a mother and three children died
this week in a fire, yesterday described their homes as death traps.
As Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro visited the scene, two
women started a petition to persuade Annandale and Eskdale Council to
provide safer windows.
Mrs Helen McQuaid, 46, of Shawhill Court, Annan, Dumfriesshire, said:
''These windows are death traps. They are on a swivel and do not open
fully. It would be almost impossible to get out in a fire and impossible
to push a child out in a panic.''
She said there had been an outcry about the windows in October 1991,
when a mother and her two children were rescued from a fire in a similar
house at Kimmeter Square in the same estate.
After the 1991 fire, Sir Hector, whose constituency includes Annan,
took up the issue of the windows with the council. He visited the house
on that occasion and was photographed at the bedroom window.
The council's general manager, Mr Bill Davidson, said last night:
''The houses conform to building standards. They are of a design that is
widely used in Scotland.''
In Wednesday's blaze at Shawhill Court, Elizabeth McPhillips, 17, died
along with her children, Sarah, 19 months, and John, eight months. A
friend's baby, Sophie Reid, six months, also died.
The mother and one of her children are believed to have been in an
upstairs bedroom, where the window measures only 20in by 33in.

A MODERN version of the old ''divvy'' was unveiled yesterday as the
latest weapon in the fast-escalating supermarket war.
Tesco, which recently completed its takeover of the William Low group,
is launching a scheme on Monday to reward customers according to the
amount they spend.
Its Clubcard, which has been on trial at 14 stores in the past year,
will allow customers to receive points as they pay for their shopping,
which are then converted into money-off vouchers at three-month
intervals.
One of Tesco's main rivals, Safeway, has been testing a similar scheme
in 25 of its stores, and will soon be extending the promotion.
Asda had no plans to follow suit but said: ''We have the technology if
we choose to go down that route.''
The schemes are a direct parallel of the dividend offered by
Co-operative stores until the early 1980s, either in a regular payment
or, latterly, in stamp form.
The Scottish Co-operative Society said yesterday that, while the
''divvy'' survived in the South of England, it had largely been replaced
by a members' privileges system.
Retail analyst Richard Perks, of Verdict Research, said of the Tesco
move: ''I think it may well boost sales -- at least until its rivals
bring in similar schemes. Tesco has been driven to this loyalty scheme
because of the fierce competition in the supermarket industry.''
Tesco chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin said: ''The Clubcard is a way of
thanking customers for shopping with us. At the same time, the
technology gives us a clearer picture of their likes and dislikes, which
helps us to give them an even better service.''
The scheme works by Tesco donating points for every #5 spent, after a
minimum amount of #10. Customers will receive two points for the first
#10 and one point for every #5 thereafter.
Clubcard holders hand their cards to the checkout operator before
their shopping is scanned and the points are added electronically to
their account. Vouchers will be sent every quarter to the holder's home
address and can be used to help pay for a later shopping bill.
Tesco said a customer spending #100 a week would collect 250 points in
three months, entitling the customer to savings of #12.50 a quarter.
Ms Lynne MacMillan, an official of the Scottish Consumer Council,
welcomed the new batch of schemes as benefiting shoppers.
''I think people doing a weekly shop are quite price-conscious and
this may well help woo them away from other supermarkets. However, I
doubt if savings alone will keep them at a particular store.''

THE process of clarification that has been sweeping through Sir Peter
Maxwell Davies's large-scale music in recent years continued to work its
course last night in the world premiere by the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra of the ninth of his Strathclyde Concertos, this one featuring
six solo wind instruments.
Some of the surface texture of the music might have sounded initially
complex (because of the six instruments in various combinations); but it
ain't. The lyricism of the last two concertos is still very much to the
fore, this time allied with the episodic structure and transparent
orchestral textures introduced in his Fifth Symphony, which was unveiled
last autumn.
The new concerto is a beauty: from its opening, melancholic lyricism
(almost recalling Tristan) it is a highly expressive work. Even in
complex combinations the six unusual solo instruments (piccolo and alto
flute, cor anglais, E flat and bass clarinets, and contrabassoon, played
by David Nicholson, Lis Dooner, Maurice Checker, Lewis Morrison, Ruth
Ellis, and Alison Green) are clearly deployed, curling round and
imitating each other.
The accompaniment for string orchestra is top-drawer Max: gleaming,
atmospheric music. Everything is lucid, clearly defined, focused.
Throughout there is a clearer sense of perspective -- foreground,
middleground, etc. Not a conventionally dramatic concerto, but an
instantly captivating one.
As was Peter Donohoe's account of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto,
which the pianist directed himself. Sure, with the soloist also
conducting there are lapses in impetus -- and the first movement
stretched a bit. But Donohoe's down-to-earth combination of poetic
playing and sheer dynamism provided a performance that was alive and
bristling, especially in an outstanding finale.

JUST over a year ago David Izod was told he had testicular cancer. For
most of 1994 he was in and out of hospital -- undergoing intensive
chemotherapy followed by major surgery -- and it is this experience, and
his reactions to it, that he explores in The Teratoma Show.
While musician Pete Williams provides an on-stage soundtrack (songs
and guitar) Izod describes, with honesty, insight, and humour, how
cancer invaded not just his body but his emotions and his entire
philosophy of life. It's a personal journey that has resonances for
everyone, since it takes in quite a few fears beyond the obvious one:
dying.
He captures, with a flourish of Hammer horror imagery, the unnerving
effect of clinical briskness on the novice patient. Shifts the fantasy
into chilling reality as he searches for words that will help us imagine
the awfulness of chemotherapy -- yet even here he finds ways of making
us laugh at the debilitating side effects of a treatment which in effect
poisons the entire system to kill off part of it.
He seeds hard fact into lively anecdote, provides significant
background information on testicular cancer and encouraging data on
effective cures. And he tells us about 18-year-old Rajeet, who was
admitted with a tumour the size of a small cauliflower in his scrotum .
. . and a life expectancy reduced to bits of borrowed time. It's the
diagnosis -- or lack of it -- which can kill more surely than the
disease itself.
There's real rage in this show -- Izod doesn't want to die, but he
certainly doesn't want to die from such a mindless, suicidal adversary
as cancer. And there's also great sincerity and gentleness -- as when he
lists the everyday pleasures he most yearns for in hospital or savours
the warmth of a sunlit convalescence he did not always believe he would
reach. This is a performance rooted in personal drama which is neither
self-indulgent, nor whiny with self-pity. Instead it amounts to a
celebration of the human spirit, a celebration of the joy of breathing
in and breathing out. Repeated tonight and at Paisley Arts Centre on
February 17. Pete Williams's music -- he was an original member of
Dexy's Midnight Runners -- is a treat in itself.

A SCOT has been appointed director of the National Lottery Sports
Fund, the body responsible for distributing an anticipated #1.6bn in
lottery proceeds to sport in England by the year 2000.
Mike Barron, from Alford, Aberdeenshire, the 53-year-old former chief
executive of Gordon District and director of leisure and recreation in
Monklands from 1974 to 1986, takes up the appointment immediately.
By the end of January, there had been more than 15,000 inquiries about
the funds he will disburse. About 400 applications and 30 completed
applications are arriving daily.
Mr Barron, a member of the Scottish Sports Council for 13 years, has a
reputation for securing grants from all over Europe.
Meanwhile, animal and environmental charities were up in arms after
learning that National Lottery cash was unlikely to find its way into
their coffers.
Organisations dealing with children, poverty, the disabled, the
unemployed, women's issues, and cultural minorities were included in a
list of high priorities for lottery funds.
However, the National Lottery Charities Board made no mention of
animal welfare or the environment.
Meanwhile, 15 people in Bellshill, Kilmarnock, and Ayr have reported
bogus telephone calls from a woman purporting to be from Camelot, and
asking them for details of their bank accounts.

LESS than a month after Perth Theatre's production of How the Other
Half Loves, Alan Ayckbourn is once more peeling back the curtains to
sneak a look at the foibles of surburban living. His is a world of
electric blankets, Cornish pasties, and paper napkins, where people
aspire to nothing more than being normal and getting on with their
friends. The typical Ayckbourn character may be dull, witty, obnoxious,
or well liked, but he is never out of the ordinary.
Behind this veneer of everyday life, what distinguishes Ayckbourn is
his ear for the surrealism of inconsequential conversation, his skill at
building ludicrous theatrical situations and, most important, his
ability to deal with sensitive subject matters in an unobtrusive way.
You've got to admire a man who can write a play called Bedroom Farce
which confronts the hazards and insecurities of sexual relationships and
yet which comes in such innocuous packaging that it would never occur to
anyone to add an ''adults only'' tag to it.
Despite a company with an impressive array of Ayckbourn credentials,
however, I don't quite feel that the play is done full justice here.
Sure, it's jolly enough, but the pace is slow to build up and we're well
into the second act before the comic momentum starts to be felt. Perhaps
it's Michael Holt's set, which solves the problem of having three
bedrooms on stage by placing one of them above the other two, at once
distant and dominating, or perhaps it's just the difficulty of building
up a rapport across such a fragmented plot.
There are several strong comic performances and lots of good laughs,
but oddly it's often the domestic strategy that dominates.

ONCE again Warwick Edwards has demonstrated impeccable research in
drawing together this Scottish Early Music Consort programme of medieval
songs reflecting love and war. Part One placed continental music from
the Crusades either side of three Scottish pieces while Part Two was a
musical portrait in miniature of Oswald Von Wolkenstein, a
fifteenth-century Tyrolean adventurer whose one remaining eye was
clearly on the damsels.
Scholarship yes, but from the opening rhythmic dance-song it was clear
this was going to be entertainment as well as an insight to the musical
footprint of the period.
Fiona Milne, Jeremy Taylor, and Alan Watt all entered enthusiastically
into the spirit of the programme singing with a sensitive understanding
of content. In particular Fiona Milne's unaccompanied voice breathed
life into the passion of the verses.
Alan Watt's enunciation ranged so fluidly over all the different
languages they each sounded like his native tongue, while Jeremy Taylor
proved at his strongest in characterisation. Playing from the
instrumentalists was consistently supportive, the ensemble refusing to
be fazed by a burst string on Kenneth Mitchell's viella early in the
first half.
Altogether this was a successful blend of the sacred with the profane
despite the especial bawdiness of Oswald Von Wolkenstein's verses after
the interval. And as in the first half Fiona Milne dazzled once again as
she sped through a tongue-twisting bestiary of animal and bird sounds
much to the delight of the well-filled house.

THE chief executive of Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow is leaving, just
months after the culmination of a successful battle to save it from
closure.
Miss Maggie Boyle, 39, who began her NHS career as a nursing auxiliary
at 17, is taking up a post in the summer with consultants Hay
Management.
She will head the new Health Service Work Transformation Unit, which
the firm is setting up to assist health service clients in designing and
managing organisational change.
''We will be targetting NHS trusts, private contractors -- anyone
providing a health care service,'' she said yesterday. ''It is all about
reducing costs and avoiding duplication without compromising the quality
of patient care. It doesn't necessarily mean cutting jobs.''
Miss Boyle has been in charge at Stobhill for four years, during most
of which it was under threat of closure as part of Greater Glasgow
Health Board's acute services strategy.
However, the board's preferred option in the strategy that is now out
for public consultation would retain the hospital.
''Now that the future is secure, the time has come to seek new
challenges,'' said Miss Boyle, who was short-listed but ultimately
turned down for the still-vacant post of general manager at the health
board.
However, she added: ''I still love the NHS dearly.''

SIR Ian Wood, the industrialist, last night wondered whether the
Thatcher years were too often maligned.
Sir Ian, last week voted the best example of a business leader in
Scotland by his peers, was speaking at the Junior Chamber, Aberdeen.
He said that while the late 70s saw some quite unacceptable features
of excessive trade union power, it had to be ensured that the
post-Thatcherite 90s avoided the excesses of the unacceptable face of
free enterprise.
''It has become fashionable to knock the Thatcher years, but there is
no doubt that they saw the revitalisation of industry, the
re-establishment of competitive enterprise, and a restoration of
management responsibility and pride in achievement.
''These have provided the basis for a much more competitive UK
industry on the world stage.
''The stream of excessive salaries and remuneration in equities, and
the few cases of abuse of management power which make today's headlines,
are the exceptions, but they get huge media coverage and we must
constantly be aware of business and industry's responsibilities, not
just to our shareholders and customers, but to all our employees and to
the communities we live and work in.''
He said the oil industry had brought its own culture of change but
Scottish and UK industry had to be aware that the world was changing at
an incredible pace and we had to change with it or be left behind as
Third World countries became more and more powerful.

WHILE deciduous shrubs and hedges are leafless, and herbaceous plants
are at a low ebb, it is an ideal time to find the source of bramble
seedlings -- and howk them out.
If you don't get them out by the roots they will rush into growth
again before long.
This, coupled with leaves developing on deciduous or semi-dormant
plants, will make finding the source all the more difficult.
Removing brambles is not a job for the faint-hearted. You need a
strong pair of gardening gloves and a long-sleeved jacket.
Brambles have very strong roots, and unless you can get a fork in, all
you may succeed in doing is pulling the top branches off and leaving the
roots intact.
You can be sure the loss of branches will in no way deter their
enthusiasm for growth. You can resort to systemic weedkillers, but they
don't act very quickly when the temperature is low.
In any case, you have to apply weedkillers specifically and accurately
to the bramble foliage, to be absorbed by the leaves.
Chemical weedkilling is worth a trial, but don't hold out too much
hope at this time of year.

Robben Island, Friday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela returned today to the Robben Island lime
quarry where he laboured for many of his 27 years in jail and said South
Africa owed it to the victims of apartheid to succeed.
Mandela, 76, led 1300 former political prisoners on a pilgrimage to
the island in Cape Town's Table Bay to mark tomorrow's fifth anniversary
of his release in 1990.
After an emotional reunion with fellow prisoners in the hot, white
quarry carved by thousands of apartheid foes, Mandela chipped at a rock
that will form the basis of a memorial cairn.
He later visited his old cell and unveiled a plaque that will mark the
cairn with the message: ''Embedded in these stones you will find the
pain of our struggle, the sorrow of losses and the foundation of our
victory.''
Wearing dark glasses to shield his eyes, which were damaged by the
fine dust and reflected sunlight of his years in the quarry, Mandela
said his sorrow was that so many who died under apartheid had failed to
see the transition to democracy.
''We have come here to celebrate the human spirit, which enabled us to
face some of the most brutal abuses of human rights,'' he told
reporters.
''All that we can do in order to honour (the victims) is to ensure
that the new battle we are fighting of ensuring a better life for all
our people is fought and won. We have already made a very good start,''
he said.
Mandela worked on the island for 18 years until 1982, when he was
transferred to a mainland jail.
His African National Congress won the first all-race elections last
April, but shares power with the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party and
the white-led National Party of former president F W de Klerk.
Officials said de Klerk and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi
declined invitations to attend the reunion.
Island veterans from neighbouring Namibia joined the pilgrimage
organised by the independent Peace Vision group, which wants Mandela to
approve a permanent international peace institute on the bleak prison
island.
Peace Vision director Na-iem Dollie said the reunion was financed by
40 white businessmen who paid 30,000 rand (#5800) each to join the trip.
Former prisoners hugged each other and exchanged memories, some
painful and some humorous, as they pointed out landmarks such as a
breakwater where they were forced to collect guano.
''It's like a dream to me,'' said prison veteran Anthony Gazi as he
stepped ashore on the concrete pier that was for thousands of apartheid
foes a first view of the jail.
Younger men in ethnic clothing or jeans greeted each other with jokes
about the food and the insults they had had to take from prison warders.
But three old men in threadbare suits walked silently hand-in-hand
beneath the stone arch leading to the prison.
George Hobana, a 67-year-old petrol pump attendant, was seeing the
island for the first time since he completed a sentence in 1967 for
blowing up schools, beer halls and a bridge.
''I'm feeling very bad because I don't like to see this place. I feel
angry because they are very bad things that happened to us here,'' he
said.
Some of the veterans went to the island's beach, where they waded and
collected stones.
''We are doing this because we were never allowed to when we were here
as prisoners,'' said former prisoner Peter Jacobs.
A prison warder said that conditions had improved greatly for the 762
ordinary criminals now held in the barracks-like jail.--Reuter.

THE gradual lengthening of the days has a profound influence on growth
of plants. Theoretically, it should stimulate gardeners into action,
too.
Sadly, nothing much is happening just yet, although there are a few
things you can usefully do in the meantime. Though simple tasks, they
will pay big dividends.
Priority should be given to checking that piece of apparatus which
faithfully cuts your grass from spring to autumn, and has probably been
lying unattended for months.
Lawnmowers vary in their cutting modes, but fall into two basic types:
cylinder and rotary.
The action of a cylinder depends on the cutting blades skimming the
sole plate. If both are sharp and properly adjusted, there is a clean
cutting action.
If the reverse is true, the result is grass being chewed rather than
cut.
If the mower is petrol driven, make sure the supply is shut off. At
the same time, detach the lead to the plug.
Next, turn the mower on its side and have a close look at the cutting
blades and sole plate. Insert a piece of writing paper between blades
and plate. Turn the blades slowly.
If all is well, the paper is cut cleanly. You can try this at various
points along the sole plate. It will often be found adjustment is
uneven, or the sole plate is bent or worn.
If cutting takes place cleanly overall, you haven't much to worry
about. All that is needed is a good clean-up with an oily rag.

<TEXT>
A LAWYER yesterday launched a ferocious criticism of the Royal
Infirmary, Glasgow, where a man died after being kept waiting for a bed.
Mr John McGowan, 67, a retired miner of Prosen Street, Tollcross,
Glasgow, died in the hospital in January last year.
A fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court has heard that,
because of staff shortages, there was no intensive care unit bed
available and doctors delayed Mr McGowan's operation.
When his condition deteriorated, they had to operate but Mr McGowan
died on the operating table from a ruptured aneurysm in his aorta.
Mr Gerald Carrol, the advocate representing the dead man's family,
described Mr McGowan as a quiet and reserved man who waited patiently
for more than three hours for treatment and did not complain.
Mr Carroll said: ''He trusted in the NHS, to which he had given two of
his three daughters who are nurses.
''He was a man who placed his trust in the ability of the hospital to
look after him properly and it was not acceptable that a major hospital
like the Royal should have failed to provide for him.''
Mr Carrol referred to evidence which revealed that for 80 minutes a
consultant physician telephoned other hospitals in an unsuccessful to
find an intensive care unit (ICU) bed for Mr McGowan.
He continued: ''When James McGowan died, he was only a man who
throughout his working life had, by dint of his income tax and national
health service contributions, played a part in what could be described
as a national lottery and, when the time came to collect his prize --
much needed treatment in hospital -- the machine wasn't plugged in.
''One could argue about figures and percentages but if Mr McGowan had
been operated on earlier, he would have had a chance of survival.
''The reason he wasn't was the lack of ICU beds. The reality was, that
was a disaster waiting to happen.
''Over 10 years ago, there were more ICU beds than in January 1994,
when Mr McGowan died.''
Mr Carrol pointed out that doctors in the hospital had complained
about the lack of beds and added: ''The reality is that this hospital
took no satisfactory steps to assess the needs for such beds.
''They had a chart showing the occupancy of the beds but it did not
reflect the number of refusals.
''On January 29, out of six patients who couldn't get a bed -- Mr
McGowan was the fifth -- four of them died and two survived.
''It is a matter of public concern that nobody seemed to be keeping
track of patients turned away. It maybe a case of out of sight, out of
mind.''
Mr Carroll described the efforts of doctors trying to locate ICU beds
in other hospitals as a ''game of pass the human parcel''. He said no
serious thought had been given to its effect on patients.
Since Mr McGowan's death, the number of permanently staffed beds had
been increased from five to seven.
He suggested that one of the reasons behind this decision might have
been that there was no space in the ward for more than seven beds.
Mr Carrol referred to the evidence of Mr John Pollock, the senior
vascular consultant at the Royal. He had told the inquiry that he had
considered asking local radio stations to broadcast advice to people not
to turn up at hospital during times when it was too busy.
He added: ''This hospital is living on its past reputation and
glories. Perhaps it should put a sign up saying there is ''no room at
the inn''.
''Having heard this inquiry, the question which the family clearly
wish answered is whether this tragedy could happen again.
''As the matter stands at the moment, it is not possible to discount
that possibility.''
Sheriff John McGowan will give his determination in writing later.

PENSIONERS faced with ruin after Robert Maxwell plundered their
pension funds learned last night that a #276m deal had been agreed to
restore their financial security.
More than three years after the press tycoon's body was found floating
in the Atlantic, the trustees of his company pension funds announced
that a group of major City institutions had agreed to settle claims.
The deal ended years of ''mental turmoil'' for 32,000 people who had
worked for Maxwell companies and had learned after his death that he had
raided the pension coffers to the tune of an estimated #440m.
Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners' Action Group,
representing 20,000 Maxwell pensioners, said: ''Obviously this is
tremendous news. These people can get on with living their lives.''
With #100m already recovered, plus payments from the Government to
cover the Guaranteed Minimum Pension, the rescue deal was welcomed by
trustees as making up virtually all the shortfall.
All 5000 members of the Maxwell Communication Pension Plan -- staff
from more than 150 Maxwell-owned companies -- ''can now look forward to
receiving their pensions, thanks to the settlement'', said a spokesman
for the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, trustees for the plan.
The settlement was welcomed in statements by City institutions whose
dealings with Robert Maxwell had led to legal action by trustees.
It was also welcomed by the Mirror Group, which said the deal --
subject to detailed contracts and court approval -- would allow it to
release more than #100m of the provision it had made to cover its
pension scheme deficit.
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley said: ''I am pleased that the
exceptional measures taken by the Government to help the pensioners have
ensured that pensions stayed in payment while discussions took place.''
The Maxwell Pensioners' Trust -- set up by the Government in June 1992
-- was understood to have enough money to continue to support pension
payments while discussion of detailed terms and conditions took place,
he said.

AFTER A recent car trip along the Bonny Banks to Glendarroch -- or
should I say Luss -- top marks are due not only to the road engineers,
but to the landscapers involved.
This is especially true around the car park area at Luss, which has
been well planted with a variety of shrubs.
Copious use has been made of mulching materials, such as rough forest
bark, and what I suspect is spent mushroom compost.
There was, unfortunately, also a mulch of beer cans and chip bags in
one particular bed. It shows a complete disregard some sectors of the
public have for attractive scenic areas.
Mulching is definitely the in-thing these days. It helps the
development of shrubs by retaining moisture on the surface.
At the same time, it controls weeds effectively, provided the land has
been cleaned at the outset and the mulch is deep enough.
Intensive mulching does not come cheaply. Various grades of forest
bark are available.
You can expect to pay anything between #5-#6.50 for an 80-litre bag.
This will give good cover over about four square yards, according to how
heavily you spread it on.
If you need a large amount, you can buy in bulk to be dumped on
pavement or driveway, but that will mean extra work.
The 80-litre bags are convenient to handle, and for that matter to
pick up in the boot of the car.
It is an excellent time now to get busy with mulching. Should you have
a serious perennial weed problem because of couch grass, horsetail, or
other obnoxious creeping weeds, chemical weed control should come first.
In the case of rose beds, deep mulching can help with control of
blackspot. I would suggest treating the ground with Armillatox around
the roses first.
You may find the roses will need a bit of extra feeding, because the
nitrogen is being appropriated by the bark in its decomposition
processes.
Don't expect mulching to last for ever. The coarser it is, the longer
it will last. Other materials can be used, but they may bring
nutritional problems.
This includes sawdust, leaves, chopped straw, wood chips, and any
other relatively dense organic material.

THERE was a time when, unless you got in a big load of farmyard manure
-- known as FYM -- for feeding your land, you were not considered to be
doing things properly.
Alas, farmyard manure in variable quality, plus weeds and other
troubles it can bring in, has tended to depopularise this material to a
large extent.
Apart from that, farmers spread most of it on to their own land as
slurry. It is often not readily available.
Despite its drawbacks, FYM has many virtues. It supplies a range of
balanced plant food over a period, and its physical nature improves the
texture of land.
One problem is that it must be dug in, and with rotary cultivators so
popular, using FYM is not really on.
In this environmental age there is a lot of interest in compost, but
amounts tend to be limited. Quality can be extremely variable.
It is no wonder gardeners turn to composted hen manure in its various
forms and guises. It is a convenient way of feeding the land.
Even so, there are still many adherents for fertilisers such as
National Growmore with its balanced 7:7:7 analysis.
Alas, chemically-based fertilisers don't do much to improve the
physical nature of the land.
Many people will also swear that they do not produce as tasty
vegetables as those grown by organic means.
Apart from digging in your FYM, don't be in too much of a rush to
apply other types of organic fertilisers, or for that matter chemical
ones.

Application in March or April, when growth is starting, is soon
enough.

IT IS a problem to know what to do about lawns at this time of year.
Despite the odd cold snap, grass has been growing strongly and is
getting distinctly lanky.
The problem is finding the surface dry enough to allow cutting without
scarring. Even walking on lawns can cause damage. The surface is
squelchy.
Don't miss a chance for a cut. Given a few dry days, it may be
possible to give the lawn a light trim.
Rotary cutters, especially of the hover type, are better than
conventional cylinder mowers at this time.
The requirement is to be able to give the grass a cut, and do it
safely.

Sarajevo, Friday
MUSLIM-led government troops and Bosnian Serb units fought pitched
battles today with tanks, artillery and ground forces in Bosnia's Bihac
enclave for control of water supplies to Bihac town.
Sniper fire also crackled out in a western suburb of Sarajevo, which
was jolted by the most serious violation of a six-week-old ceasefire
last night when Serb forces unleashed a brief mortar barrage.
The arrest on spying charges of a Serb woman working for the United
Nations relief mission brought the expected retaliation from the Serbs
who blocked UN aid convoys.
In Zagreb, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said he wanted Nato
troops to monitor Croatia's borders with Bosnia and Serbia when UN
peacekeepers leave the country after March 31.
Clashes flared in Bihac this morning 10 miles west of Bihac town. They
spread to Klokot village, which troops of the Muslim-led government
attacked on January 14 to secure a well supplying Bihac town.
''At the moment, this attack threatens the retaking of the town water
supply,'' UN spokesman Graham Day said.
One Serb soldier was killed and six wounded, Bosnian Serb forces told
Reuters at their headquarters in Pale.
The clashes violate a ceasefire that has generally held elsewhere in
Bosnia since January 1 - Reuter.

Give your audience
ammunition to combat the
killing of the imagination
happening every day
Negotiations for The
Castle broke down, giving
rise to more than a suspicion
of personal politics
John Linklater looks at possible conflicts between artistic director
Kenny Ireland's continuing involvement with The Wrestling School and his
fixed base at the Lyceum
KENNY Ireland has always felt compelled to get in on the hustle. That
instinct imprinted a pattern on his career long before he ever took over
as artistic director of the Royal Lyceum 26 months ago. It was a job he
had always wanted, but running an establishment theatre has had to
subdue some of his more combative passions. This year he found an outlet
in London, Berlin, and Paris.
In these cities he has continued an artistic affair. Few really
imagined that he would relinquish a long-established dalliance with The
Wrestling School and the work of controversial playwright Howard Barker.
The surprise is that he has not yet flaunted it before Edinburgh
audiences, although that will change soon. The hustle has lain in
preparing the introduction of something faintly illicit.
It is his production for The Wrestling School of Barker's play The
Castle. It opened at the Hebbel Theater, Berlin, last week before
continuing a European and British tour at L'Odeon, Paris. Along with
Barker's own production of Hated Nightfall (seen last year at The
Tramway, Glasgow), and a new production of a smaller-scale Barker piece,
Judith, which is being rehearsed on the road, the tour will reach
Manchester, Sheffield, Leicester, Copenhagen, Plymouth, Brighton, and
Lisbon. Somewhere in the middle of that schedule, for four nights from
May 3, it will infiltrate the Royal Lyceum.
The reception remains to be seen, for Barker is a challenging writer
whose work generates more excitement outside Britain, and there is
little to suggest that the Lyceum audience is ready to abandon its
innate conservatism, but Ireland has been working hard to change the
profile and The Castle could be a major strategic breakthrough. The more
obvious Scottish leg for the tour would have been a Mayfest run at The
Tramway, where a hard-core support for Barker and The Wrestling School
has been forged over several years, but negotiations for The Castle
broke down, giving rise to more than a suspicion of personal politics.
A provocation here may be the role of the now Amsterdam-based Neil
Wallace as executive producer of The Wrestling School tour, his first
involvement since his departure from The Tramway after what he now
describes as ''losing a battle within the structure''. Bob Palmer, who
heads Glasgow's Department of Performing Arts, maintains that the costs
involved were too high to bring the production to The Tramway, but the
''commitment'' to the future work of Barker will be maintained. Wallace
says: ''I think it is a great pity that the work of one of the greatest
contemporary writers in the English language can't fit into a Mayfest
programme, but festival director Paul Bassett has every right to do what
he likes with a key venue like The Tramway''.
This kind of squabble mystifies European theatre producers and
critics, who believe they recognise in Barker a creator of a brilliant
literary achievement in the best tradition of British theatre. They
cannot understand why his reputation is not more secure at home. They
envy the substance and poetry offered by his texts, an attractive
counterpoint to a European theatre increasingly of style and image
rather than content. The prestigious Schaubuhne Theater of Berlin has
this week called for new German translations of Barker's work with a
view to producing, and Heiner Muller at the Berliner Ensemble is a huge
fan of Barker.
This has reflected in the German reviews from the current tour. ''A
refractory, provocative, and all-round remarkable writer,'' said Die
Welt in its January 20 review of Hated Nightfall at The Hebbel. ''A
brilliant mixture of language, music, and extreme theatre,'' enthused
the Berliner Morgenspost. Screenwriter Paul Mayersberg, who scripted The
Man Who Fell To Earth and Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence, turned up in
Berlin last week and described Barker approvingly as a ''scholastic
punk''.
This contrasts with the grudging, knowing, deeply suspicious reviews
in the British national press when The Castle previewed earlier last
month for a few nights at the Riverside, London. The easy objection to
Barker is that he is too clever by half and his language is
scatological. Charles Spencer in the Daily Telegraph said: ''Barker
seems heroically determined to offend almost everyone''. Even Michael
Billington, who evidently tries hard to be fair in the Guardian, is
forced to concede a kind of defeat with The Castle. ''Watching it you
can see why Barker, like Edward Bond, is often more honoured abroad than
at home,'' he chides. ''For all his use of a muscular, imagistic
prose-poetry, he belongs to an essentially European tradition in which
allegorical meaning is more important than surface realism.''
Neil Wallace dismisses all this as the response of the ''Little
Englanders''. Barker may have long since learned to be philosophical
about the neglect he suffers after first the Royal Court and then the
Royal Shakespeare Company dropped their support after initial
encouragement. It was precisely to redress this problem that The
Wrestling School was formed in 1989. The instigators were the Scottish
actor Hugh Fraser and Kenny Ireland. They approached Barker. The company
would bring together a wide group of actors, many of them of the highest
calibre, who were ready to champion his work.
This explains the attraction of the hustle for Ireland. As the company
name suggests, setting up a school to establish a style of performance
for Barker's work has necessarily involved a struggle to gain an
armlock. From the start it has been an embattled position against
reactionary taste governing what is presented in British theatres.
Another Scottish actor, Ian McDiarmid, whose performance as Dancer in
Hated Nightfall mesmerised the Berlin audiences, has stated the position
succinctly. ''Barker appeals directly to actors and audiences,'' he
contends. ''The difficulties lie with those in between.''
Barker regards the Scottish connection as confirming rather than
refuting a reputation he is happy to accept as a ''Euro'' writer. He
says: ''I think I'm very much a European writer, which means that Scots,
French, and Germans would take to me more naturally than the English,
who I regard as a very parochial and, frankly, quite a philistine
culture. The level of criticism in England is quite philistine. The
choice of work by our national companies is philistine. I am delighted
to be taken up by Europeans, by Scots and other Europeans.
''I don't want to risk my neck by wandering into national stereotypes,
but there is something very passionate about Kenny Ireland and Ian
McDiarmid. As actors and directors they are very passionate. They are
not subdued, and they react to these texts in the way that good actors
react to them, which is to seize on them as an opportunity for a public
kind of theatre, a demonstrative theatre.''
Kenny Ireland's connection with Howard Barker goes back to 1980 when
he was an actor in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of The
Loud Boy's Life. Although he had a small part he had fallen in love with
the work. Barker, the author, exchanged pleasantries at the last night's
party for the show. Two years later he found the bulky actor on the
doorstep of his Brighton home, looking for a script. Ireland was on a
mission for Joint Stock, the progressive London company who advocated
total collaboration between author, director, actors, and designers.
They normally used a workshop method to devise pieces through
rehearsals, but this time it had fallen through and Ireland had been
dispatched to find a new finished text.
Ireland takes up the story: ''We had lost a workshop and I went down
to Brighton to try to dig up Howard. At that stage he was a bit out in
the critical wilderness. I asked him what he had got, so he went into a
desk drawer and produced three classic texts, Crimes In A Hot Country,
Victory, and The Castle. I took all three and devoured them. They were
astonishing.''
Joint Stock's 1983 production of Victory, in which Ireland played the
meaty part of Ball, was a landmark of British theatre writing, confirmed
in the revival which Ireland directed for The Wrestling School in 1991.
The intervening transitional period was crucial for both the fortunes of
Barker and Ireland. Barker had to some extent survived as an alternative
writer who commanded a heavily commited following through The Wrestling
School, the only company in Britain devoted to the work of a single
playwright (not even the RSC practises such exclusivity). Ireland, as
the company's artistic director, commanded a healthy reputation.
His approach had always been to establish a definitive style of
performance for Barker's work, and to broaden the constituency of its
audience. It was a seductive method, enlisting a brilliant sound
designer, Matthew Scott, and a wizard of the lighting board, Ace
McCarron, the Glasgow-born designer who will direct Judith on the
current tour. Ireland summarises the role of The Wrestling School in his
programme note: ''Its aim since its inception has been to give this work
the fullest range of expression, befitting its complexity both in
language and in imagery. Barker's poetic idiom, the investment in a
language created for the theatre, makes intense demands on actors'
traditional skills. Its high emotional pitch tests equally their energy
and invention.''
When Ireland was interviewed for the Lyceum job of artistic director
in 1992 there was no disputing his credentials, but there was alarm at
the prospect of his deluging the theatre with Barker. Once installed he
said that he would wait for the chance to present the work. The
necessary precondition, he suggested, would be the establishment of
trust with his audience.
Since then Ireland has hustled at the Lyceum to considerable effect.
He won an internal power struggle with the departure of general manager
Roger Spence. He managed to secure the agreement of Edinburgh District
Council to waive a #1m capital deficit through the previous regime's
programme of refurbishments. Pragmatic co-productions have been mounted
with Dundee Repertory and the Brunton Theatre. In the year up to last
April he had attracted an audience increase of 11,000, and while
competition with the newly opened Festival Theatre will dent further
increases, it is clear that progress is being made, an impression
confirmed in the 3.7% increase in annual revenue announced this week by
the Scottish Arts Council.
Onstage, Ireland's policy has been to move more gently. He has
exercised clout to bring in Brian Cox and long-term associate Bill
Paterson as associate artists, and box-office stars David Rintoul and
Vivien Heilbron as guest actors. The only misjudgment was to recruit his
mentor William Gaskell as director of the Edinburgh Festival
co-production Armstrong's Last Goodnight, sparking virtual insurrection
within a strong Scottish cast. Ireland accepts that it didn't work. On
this episode he remains terse: ''Bill Gaskell didn't get the best from
the Scottish community of actors. And the Scottish acting community
didn't get the best from Bill Gaskell.''
An important development has been the search for a younger audience at
the Lyceum. An audience survey in autumn 1993 established that 47% who
attended three productions, The Sunshine Boys, The Master Builder, and
Midsummer Night's Dream, were under the age of 35, a statistic Ireland
is determined to build upon. The two biggest box-office returns, out of
the 22 plays he has put on since he arrived, have been To Kill A
Mockingbird and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, both directed by Caroline
Hall, and both attracting a substantial school-age audience within
houses above 70%. While encouraging, these successes do not particularly
suggest a natural bridge to the work of Howard Barker.
Nevertheless, a strong contemporary flavour is edging into the Lyceum
repertoire. The productions exchanged with Dundee, Dancing At Lughnasa
and Death And The Maiden, were far better than the third-string touring
versions of these big West End hits of recent years. The opportunistic
formula is being revived to bring David Mamet's Oleanna as a Lyceum
production, and it will be the big talking-point production to precede
The Castle when the tour reaches Edinburgh in the first week of May. The
hope for an immediate spin-on may yet prove sound strategy.
But Ireland refuses to differentiate the potential appeal of Barker
with mainstream theatre, and he sees no contradiction between his
continuing involvement with The Wrestling School and his fixed base at
the Lyceum. In Berlin he commented: ''I don't see it as a conflict.
Whatever I gain out of The Wrestling School actually informs what I do
at the Lyceum. In this city Heiner Muller says that now is the time to
turn the theatre into a space for the imagination. In order to give your
audience ammunition to combat the killing of the imagination that is
happening every day. This is a truly political act, even if the material
has no political immediacy.
''Howard Barker gives me that strength. Heiner Muller gives me that
strength. Then I return to Edinburgh and I run a rep. But it's still the
same strength. I still want to convince people that they will come into
the Lyceum and go boom! And their imagination lifts off.''

Grozny, Friday.
RUSSIAN planes bombed the outskirts of Grozny today and Chechen
defenders dug in to try to stop Moscow's troops driving south out of the
capital.
Six Russian bombers pounded Argun, 10 miles east of Grozny. Black
smoke poured from a burning car and a residential building in the town,
now mostly deserted but once home to 30,000 people.
Argun, virtually linked to the capital by strips of built-up
territory, is still held by Chechen irregulars and has been the scene of
intense fighting in the past few days.
Interfax yesterday quoted Chechen sources as saying Chechen military
headquarters would be moved to Argun.
An oil dehydrogenation plant two miles south of Argun, at Mesker-Yurt,
was still burning after being bombed early this morning.
''There was only a tonne of oil left in the storage tanks which we
couldn't pump out. It didn't make much sense to bomb it,'' said plant
chief Abdullah Usmanov, surveying the damage.
Chechen fighters, who have mostly quit their ruined capital, were
digging in south of the city to try to cut off what they expect will be
a Russian drive into the rebel-held countryside.
They had mined a main road leading south out of the capital to hobble
any Russian advance along the road towards Shali, a stronghold 15 miles
south of Grozny.
The town has considerable strategic value because it lies near the
foot of the Caucasus mountains, from where the Chechens say they are
ready to wage an Afghanistan-style guerrilla campaign against the
Russians.
''They (the Russians) tried moving down the road last night, but we
forced them to retreat,'' said Khamid, a smiling rebel with a grenade
launcher slung over his shoulder.
The Chernorechiye and Aldy districts in the southwest corner of the
city, the only areas of Grozny still under Chechen control, were
relatively quiet this afternoon except for sporadic shell explosions.
Earlier, a Chechen military official told Interfax news agency rebel
fighters were leaving ambush units in Grozny to harass Russian troops.
President Boris Yeltsin read a report on the situation in Chechnya to
leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kazakhstan's
capital Alma-Ata today.
No details were released, but Kazakh leader Nursultan Nazarbayev told
a post-summit news conference Moscow was actively seeking ways to end
the fighting.
In Moscow, liberal member of parliament Gleb Ponomaryov showed
reporters a fax he received earlier today from Chechen military
commander Aslam Mashkhadov offering a ceasefire.
''The leadership of the Chechen armed forces is ready to hold talks
with the Russian military commanders on the following issues -- a
ceasefire to withdraw the dead, exchange of wounded without conditions,
exchange of prisoners and offering humanitarian aid to the local
population,'' said the message to Russian military commanders.
It was not clear whether the message, dated February 10, had reached
the Russian military.
And Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma's defence committee,
told reporters he had received death threats over his opposition in the
lower house to the Chechnya campaign.
Russia lifted a state of emergency, declared in November 1992, in
North Ossetia and Ingushetia but vowed to keep the security measures in
place in the two North Caucasus regions, which neighbour rebel Chechnya,
Interfax news agency said.
The CIS pledged to nip armed conflicts in the bud and end years of
ethnic unrest, but failed to take collective action on the war in
Chechnya.
CIS leaders, while avoiding judgment on the Kremlin's use of force to
crush Chechen separatists, supported a proposal by Kazakh leader
Nazarbayev to promote peace and stability in the 12-member grouping.
The CIS, formed in 1991 from the ashes of the Soviet Union, took a
hands-off approach to the Chechen conflict in apparent deference to
Russia, its most powerful member.
Nazarbayev's peace and stability proposal justified efforts to
preserve territorial integrity. But it also opposed settlement of
disputes by force - Reuter.

Washington, Friday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's embattled choice for top medical policy
adviser pledged today to stand fast against anti-abortion groups trying
to sink his nomination and accused them of distorting his record.
''I am standing strong -- and I appreciate the strong support of the
president,'' Dr Henry Foster said as he fought to pull his nomination
for surgeon general out of political quicksand.
''My opponents say that this nomination is about abortion. I have
dedicated my medical career to taking all appropriate medical steps to
meet the health needs of my patients, and that includes performing legal
abortions,'' Foster said in a speech to an ethusiastic meeting of
medical students and faculty at the capital's George Washington
University.
He said he, like Clinton, believed that abortions should be ''safe,
legal and rare''.
Foster, a Tennessee-based obstetrician known for his work on public
health and combatting teenage pregnancy, added: ''My life's work has
been dedicated to making sure that young people don't have to face the
choice of having abortions.''
But his cause appeared to suffer a blow as he was trying to make his
case when Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware announced he would vote
against the nomination -- the first member of Clinton's Democratic party
to take that stand in the Senate, which must confirm the nomination by
majority vote.
''It was a political blunder in the extreme (to nominate Foster),''
said Biden. ''He (Clinton) shouldn't have sent him up. I'm going to vote
against him.''
Later today, Biden recanted, saying he had acted in a fit of pique.
''My comments concerning the nomination of Dr Foster were a reflection
of my anger and frustration with the way the White House has handled
this nomination,'' Biden said in a statement read by a White House
spokeswoman.
Senators including Republican Arlen Specter spoke up on Foster's
behalf. He also won endorsements from the American Medical Association,
a black doctors' group and Congress's Black Caucus. Foster, a black, met
with the caucus today.
It all added up to a rising political cross-fire that suggested this
was fast becoming another of the nomination nightmares the Clinton White
House has seen several times before. Prior embarrassments have erupted
over nominees for attorney general, defence secretary and lower posts.
In Foster's case, what appeared to be a safe choice exploded when
anti-abortion groups pounced on evidence that he had performed some
abortions during his career as an obstetrician.
Foster confirmed that he had, noting the procedure is not only legal
but a constitutional right. But he gave his critics more rope by making
vague, changing statements as to how many he had performed and under
what circumstances.
That enabled some political critics to sidestep the volatile abortion
debate per se and argue that the real issue was Foster's credibility and
the competence of White House staff work that failed to examine Foster's
abortion record.--Reuter.

Managua, Friday
A BRITON and an American have been kidnapped by an armed group of
bandits in northern Nicaragua, an army said today.
About 15 troops loyal to the rebel leader Charro captured Sarah
Howard, a British citizen, and an American called Hicks yesterday, an
army spokesman said.
0 ''They (the hostages) were from an international organisation that
is performing a study of the countryside in the area,'' he said.
The kidnappings took place near San Jose de Bocay, about 150 miles
north of Managua, Sandoval said.
The kidnappers were requesting that the Catholic Church, an
Organisation of American States mission, and local news reporters be
summoned to the area to negotiate the safe return of the hostages.
Several hundred men armed with military weaponry continue to roam the
mountainous northern countryside of Nicaragua.
Authorities consider them to be common criminals rather than political
guerrillas, because they have not laid out political demands.--Reuter

THE director of Glasgow School of Art yesterday maintained that a
''greed is good'' philosophy was undermining public services.
Professor Dugald Cameron's criticism of the drive for profit was
underlined by Councillor Charles Gordon, convener of Strathclyde's
transport committee, who ridiculed prospects of privatisation of
ScotRail by early next year.
Both men upset protocol by making their pronouncements during a
train-naming ceremony in Glasgow.
Professor Cameron told guests that both the art school and railways
were ''suffering from a sustained assault by a Government stupidly
determined to undermine public services'', and added: ''It has
transformed public services into one of private greed.''
He was standing beside a ScotRail train given the nameplate Glasgow
School of Art, to mark the school's 150th anniversary.
He went on to question Government ideology behind the bid to split up
the railways. He said it was ''utterly ludicrous'' for the Government to
spend #700m on the privatisation process when British Rail would have
only #100m for capital investment in the next financial year.
Councillor Gordon, in his public address, said he hoped Strathclyde
region's long, productive association with ScotRail would continue --
provided 29 ''intractable problems'' connected with the franchising
process and 129 more over local government reorganisation could be
resolved.
He warned later that the council, which subsidises the largest
commuter network outside London, would refuse to compromise over
Government pressures to accept that timetables and quality requirements
should be flexible.
Strathclyde's response to any complaints that it was delaying rail
privatisation would be: ''Tough.''
He forecast that it would be impossible for the Government to
privatise ScotRail as planned next year, because of doubts over funding
the network.
Councillor Gordon argued that no-one would be prepared to bid for the
seven-year franchise within the Government time-scale, because of
financial doubts over subsidy levels guaranteed only until April next
year.
ScotRail's director, Mr Chris Green, who attended the naming ceremony,
declined to comment.

A GLASGOW man made legal history at Ayr Sheriff Court, yesterday, when
he was found guilty of committing perjury while giving evidence on his
own behalf at his own trial.
Craig Milne, 28, of Castlebay Terrace, Milton, was prosecuted for
giving false evidence at the trial in January, 1993.
People have been allowed to give evidence on their own behalf since
1898, but no-one found guilty at their original trial has subsequently
been prosecuted for giving false evidence at that trial, until
yesterday.
At the original trial, Milne was jailed for six months after being
found guilty of driving while disqualified and without insurance.
A further indictment relating to an attempt to pervert the course of
justice by supplying the police with a false name and address and a
minor parking offence was not called.
He pleaded not guilty originally, lodging defences of alibi and
incrimination.
But he changed his plea after the evidence of two key witnesses in the
defence case.
Depute fiscal Mrs Margaret Paton had earlier told the court how the
prosecution for perjury came about. She claimed that on the second day
of the original trial, she was approached by Milne's solicitor Mr Brian
Greig and told that, if she dropped the charges relating to his client
having no insurance, Milne would plead guilty.
When questioned by her fellow fiscal, Mr Wallace Montgomery, she said:
''Possibly he was offering me a deal, but he was asking me to do
something which I wouldn't have ever considered doing.''
Mr Greig said in evidence that he found the evidence given by Mrs
Paton ''quite extraordinary''. He denied offering a deal based on the
dropping of the insurance charge because he said it was such a minor
charge relative to driving while disqualified that it would have been
nonsensical to have based any deal on it.
Mrs Paton said after the original trial she referred the case to her
fiscal, Mr Noel O'Brien, who then contacted the Crown Office. They
decided to press charges of perjury, and Milne was arrested as he
emerged from prison.
Sheriff Francis Keane called for social inquiry reports before he
sentences Milne on February 23.

Lahore, Friday
A 14-YEAR-OLD Christian boy convicted of writing anti-Islamic slogans
on a mosque was today under sentence of death because of Pakistan's
strict blasphemy laws.
Judge Mujahid Hussein found Salamat Masih and his uncle Rehmat Masih
guilty of insulting Islam, a crime that carries a mandatory death
penalty, which in Pakistan means hanging.
The alleged anti-Islamic slogans were never revealed at the trial in
Lahore, said the pair's defence lawyer. Witnesses said they were erased
immediately and they refused to repeat them in court on the grounds that
they were offensive to Islam.
Amnesty International and other human rights groups have criticised
Pakistan's blasphemy laws, first introduced during the 1980s. The laws
prohibit any criticism of Islam or its seventh-century founder the
prophet Mohammed.
At least six people have been sentenced to hang so far, although
no-one has yet been executed.

THE missing piece of a valuable collection of furniture and fittings
from a former Charles Rennie Mackintosh tearoom -- part of a major
exhibition of his work -- has been uncovered during a visit to Glasgow
by an American-based governor of the city's school of art.
Mrs Eleanor Taffner and her husband Donald, were viewing restoration
work being carried out for the exhibition on Thursday, when they were
shown the almost re-assembled White Dining Room from Miss Cranston's
tearooms and realised that they owned what the school has described as
''the missing piece of the jigsaw'' -- a decorative fire-back.
The couple were being shown a 6ft square cast-iron fireplace which
once graced the tearooms in Ingram Street, and -- after having been
''lost'' for more than 20 years -- was last year discovered behind a
false wall in the school's basement.
Mrs Taffner, in Glasgow for the naming of a ScotRail train in honour
of the school's 150th anniversary, said: ''We looked at the fireplace
and noticed that the fire-back was missing. Then we realised that we
have it at home in New York.''
The discovery was checked by Mr Peter Trowles, the curator of the
school's Mackintosh Collection, and officials are ''99% certain'' it is
the missing piece.
The Taffners, who bought the 95-year-old fire-back at a Christie's
auction in Glasgow in May 1990, are to donate the piece to Glasgow.
* The National Trust for Scotland is buying a table designed by
Mackintosh for the Hill House in Helensburgh.

EASTWOOD MP Allan Stewart demonstrated that the best defence is a good
offence last night, in a vigorous attack on Labour's devolution plans
before Tory loyalists in the heart of Mr Tony Blair's English
constituency.
Mr Stewart, who resigned on Tuesday after an incident with motorway
protesters, confounded expectations by keeping a long-standing
engagement to address the Conservative branch in Sedgefield, County
Durham.
He even managed to make light of his sudden departure from Government.
He told them he had been worried that Sedgefield's Conservatives might
not have heard of him. ''I asked myself if there was anything I could do
to get my public profile up? I hope you agree I have succeeded in doing
that.''
He had come to England to take on Labour and the party's proposals for
constitutional reform. That he chose to do so in Mr Blair's safe
constituency was, he admitted, a bit of mischief. Devolution for
Scotland, Wales, and England is a ''con trick'', he said, based on
political opportunism. Labour has not thought out its plans or solved
fundamental problems, such as the West Lothian question.
''Why should England have 72 Scottish MPs voting on laws about schools
in Sedgefield but not St Andrews; 72 Scottish MPs deciding on housing
for Durham but not Dundee?'' he said.
He told the audience of about 50 mostly elderly Tory supporters that
Labour has not thought through its proposals. ''They do not derive from
genuine belief but from political opportunism. They are unworkable.''
He added: ''They are offering people in England wholly undefined
assemblies that people simply do not want. Frankly, these proposals have
all the appearance of being written on the back of an exceedingly small
envelope.''
In an open letter to Mr Stewart published yesterday, the cross party
Campaign for a Northern Assembly challenged him to explain why quangoes
and civil servants running services in the North-east should not be
subject to democratic control.
The letter asked: ''Do you believe that your party, with its
percentage share of the vote in the northern region at the last General
Election, legitimately represents the views of the northern
electorate?''
More than 50% of the region's electorate voted Labour in the last
General Election.
Councillor Eric Roberts, chairman of the Sedgefield Conservative
Constituency Association, said: ''If people are talking about the
Government's performance in this region then devolution would be bottom
of the list. We just don't see it happening.''

THE daughter of a woman whose throat was cut by a motorist on a
country lane yesterday warned that the ''crazy killer'' would strike
again.
Grief-stricken Heather Wilson, 39, said: ''I know that the crazy
person who did this to my mother will do it again to somebody else
because there was no motive whatsoever.''
She said her mother had walked on the road where she met her killer
hundreds of times before.
Mrs Margaret Wilson, 66, died on the country lane between Burton
Fleming and Rudston, Humberside, on Thursday afternoon, just moments
after Heather had dropped her off from her car.
Mrs Wilson had wanted to walk to her cottage but she had walked only a
few hundred yards when the motorist driving towards her in a white
Montego Estate car stopped and struggled with the elderly woman,
slashing her throat with a knife.
Two horrified farm labourers, who were ploughing a field near Mrs
Wilson's home, saw the attack.
As they ran to try to help her, the killer calmly jogged back to his
car and sped off.
Holding back tears at a packed news conference in Driffield today,
Miss Wilson said: ''My mother got killed because she was in the right
place, well the wrong place, she just happened to be there, that's why
she got killed.''
Heather added: ''I don't think it was premeditated. I think it was
spur of the moment and that is what makes it so awful.''
Police have not established a motive.

Julie Davidson finds one for the birds and another break for those
who'd like to bill and coo in fairy-tale style
THE last dodo died on Mauritius, and they're still having problems
with bird conservation. Recently there was another ornithological
fatality on the Indian Ocean island, a drama of hawks and doves when the
world's rarest kestrel ate the world's rarest pigeon.
''True!'' says Libby Weir-Breen, who runs Island Holidays'
special-interest tours from her Comrie base in landlocked Perthshire.
''The Mauritian Wildlife Appeal Fund has been working on a programme to
save both the Mauritius kestrel and the pink pigeon. The kestrel was
almost extinct. Its numbers have been raised from two or three to around
300, and there are only about 70 pink pigeons left. Unfortunately one of
the kestrels made a meal of one of the pigeons.''
In need of the PR, perhaps, the Mauritian Wildlife Appeal Fund is
collaborating with Island Holidays in the autumn on a natural-history
holiday with an emphasis on birdlife. Led by a British ornithologist and
escorted by a member of the resident MFA team, the tour leaves London
Heathrow on October 20 of this year. Its numbers are limited to 12, and
''pink pigeons and Mauritius kestrels are guaranteed!'' says Libby
Weir-Breen confidently. If they can keep them apart.
I have a soft spot for Mauritius, which I visited in 1979 when it was
still a twinkle in the eye of the package-holiday industry but when this
was already the island's second industry. (Sugar is the first.) It has
some of the loveliest hotels in the tropics -- thanks, largely, to
careful development and the influence of one French Mauritian architect
-- and its history has given it a cheerful muddle of races and cultures.
The French developed it, the British appropriated it (after
independence in 1968 it became a member of the Commonwealth), the
Africans were the slaves of its sugar plantations, and the Indians
replaced them with indentured labour after the abolition of slavery in
1835. Many of their genes are now mixed, and although English is the
language of officialdom the lingua franca is French and the patois is
Creole. It also has its share of Chinese, moving in from Asia to become
the merchant class. Gastronomically it's like living in Soho.
It has wonderful little jaggy mountains, including the volcanic peak
which Mark Twain called ''a dainty vest-pocket Matterhorn'', coral
sands, and a splendid reef. But it's halfway between Africa and India
and I wouldn't go all that way to lie on a beach, which is why the
twitchers' tour is the kind of lure which makes more sense.
People who live near Mauritius do go there to lie on a beach and enjoy
the water sports and deep-sea fishing. It's a popular destination with
Zimbabweans, who don't have a coastline, and South Africans, who do but
like a change. When I was there 15 years ago its tourists were mainly
South Africans ''taking a holiday,'' as one told me, ''from apartheid''.
They don't need to do that now, but there were always those who
appreciated the racial harmony of Mauritius.
Recent information suggests there's only one serpent in this tourist
Eden: the price of ''extras'' in those heavenly hotels, where you can
expect to pay three times as much for an imported bottle of wine as you
do in Europe or, indeed, in Zimbabwe or South Africa. But that shouldn't
bother bird-watchers intoxicated by Mauritius kestrels and seeing pink
pigeons. Island Holidays' all-inclusive Mauritian adventure costs #1995
for eight nights. Reservations and itinerary on 01764 670107.
* ALL Dr Brian Mawhinney needs to know about the Chunnel rail service
is contained in the winter edition of Top Rail, the magazine of SNCF,
the French railway network. This gung-ho publication knows no fear. To
the question, ''Is Eurostar safe?'' it replies: ''For a number of
reasons, Eurostar can claim to be among the safest trains in the world,
and also the safest way of getting from Britain to the Continent. In
addition, there are highly effective security procedures in place at
Eurostar check-in and waiting areas, as well as on the train itself.''
Highly effective for all but Observer reporters, of course.
* WEXAS International, the travel-club and discount-fare specialist,
have found a foolproof way to inform journalists about their 25th
anniversary. They've sent us a commemorative souvenir. So, declaring an
interest and a taste for vintage claret, I raise my glass of 1970
Chateau La Cardonne Cru Grand Bourgeois and toast Wexas's
quarter-century, which was born with one man, his girlfriend, a borrowed
typewriter, and a kitchen table in Chelsea and has seen the club grow
into Europe's leading travel association, with 35,000 members and an
annual turnover of #25 million.
What happened in 1970? The Beatles split up. BP discovered oil in the
North Sea. The first Jumbo Jet landed at Heathrow. And a young man
called Ian Wilson, inspired by his experience of student travel clubs at
Oxford, decided to form a club which would help make the louche world of
the bucket shop respectable.
The world of discount travel has changed beyond recognition. ''In
those days,'' says Dr Wilson, who is still the chairman of Wexas, ''the
consolidators wanted cash in hand and there were a lot of cowboys
around. The key feature was 'bent' charter flights. The Wednesday
Special to New York was chartered under different pseudo 'affinity'
groups every Wednesday. The Surrey Cagebirds Association springs to
mind.
''The discount market is now legitimate, covered by ATOL licensing
which is the ultimate official sanction and which gives the consumer
protection.''
The mysterious acronym Wexas stands for World Expeditionary
Association. Dr Wilson, interested in the serious side of travel, was
keen to involve the organisation in explorations and research and Wexas
have sponsored over 200 expeditions.
As the number of independent travellers continues to overtake packaged
ones, club membership and Wexas's operation continue to grow, moving
into the business market, too. Today the annual subscription gives
members access to discounted flights, hotels, car-hire and other travel
accessories, as well as a tailor-made travel service and the Wexas tour
programmes. If you like a lot of expertise on your club and want to

OFFICIALS at ports and airports across the UK were last night on the
lookout for a woman who removed her three-year-old daughter from an
Argyll hotel. The child's father has legal custody of her.
Strathclyde Police issued the alert after Mrs Karen Stewart left the
Crinan Hotel with her daughter, Kelly, on Thursday afternoon. Mrs
Stewart is from New Zealand.
The girl's father, Mr Andrew Stewart, of Bellanoch, near Lochgilphead,
had custody of Kelly after the couple separated late last year. He left
the child with her mother earlier on Thursday and found they had both
gone when he went to collect her.
Mr Stewart, 29, a woodcutter, said yesterday that his estranged wife
had packed her cases and left her job at the hotel, where she had worked
as a receptionist for the past month.
He was granted an interim custody order at Dunoon Sheriff Court on
Wednesday, which prevented Mrs Stewart, 34, taking Kelly out of his
care, or out of the sheriffdom of North Strathclyde.
Police described the girl as slim, with collar-length blond hair, and
wearing a red anorak, green trousers, and black boots. Her mother is 5ft
6in, of slim build, with brown hair and a fair complexion.

R D Kernohan was not tired of life but was certainly tired of London,
until he looked beyond the crowded attractions to find revitalising
refuges in the city
AS James Boswell might have said, no good Scot should let Dr Johnson
vex him too much. But the great Englishman can put the fear of death in
me. He wrote to Boswell: ''When a man is tired of London, he is tired of
life. For there is in London all that life can afford.''
If that means urban life, it's as true today as in 1777. And if you
find you don't like London, even at times can hardly bear London, does
that mean that you're past it and ready for an even more important
departure than any from Heathrow?
Maybe not. Perhaps only someone as reluctant as Johnson to express
mixed feelings could never be in two minds about London. Even some
equally single-minded Englishmen, notably William Cobbett in his
denunciations of ''The Great Wen'' when it was a tenth of its modern
size, have been decidedly of the other opinion about it.
Scots writers have often taken to it. The makar William Dunbar, who
had even more powerful things than Johnson to say about the fear of
death, thought it the ''flower of cities all''. Carlyle is forever
linked to Chelsea as well as Ecclefechan. Barrie thought up strange
notions around Kensington Gardens. Yet, apart from Dickens, the best of
the English have had their doubts. When she had to come to London I'm
sure Jane Austen held on to her handbag. Thomas Hardy retreated to
Wessex. Shakespeare bought a nice house back in Stratford. Even Kipling
has splendid lines of frustration:
But I am sick of London
From Shepherd's Bush to Bow.
Kipling stumbled on to the truth that, for all its sense of being a
capital city, London remained (and remains today) a very parochial one.
Many Londoners are almost as hazy about the geography of their own urban
sprawl -- apart from the West End, City, and their Tube line -- as about
the world beyond Watford.
But it is possible to come to terms with London, though the terms are
inevitably dictated by two facts of London life. The first is what you
may think of either as monstrous complexity or infinite variety. The
second is that the main tourist ''attractions'' seem as congested nearly
all year round as those of Edinburgh for a few weeks of high summer.
Even more than in Paris or Vienna or Rome, it can be hard to see
anything worthwhile because of the crowds who flock to see it. Much of
the National Gallery is afflicted by the kind of congestion which in the
vaster Louvre concentrates on a few five-star items like the Mona Lisa.
The tours which once neglected St Paul's now swarm around it.
Westminster Abbey, a mecca for the Japanese, is uncomfortably and
unnaturally partitioned between the small area of unrestricted access in
the nave and the heavily charged-for chapels.
The answer is to look, among the complexity, for things and places
that are relatively neglected and slightly out of the way. London is
still a city of partially hidden treasures. Even attractions that come a
bit down the page in good guidebooks can be bearable in the high tourist
season and quite relaxed out of it. Not all of them are remote. The
outstanding example is probably the wonderful eccentricity of Sir John
Soane's Museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields with its Hogarths, its founder's
ability to turn the rooms of his house into vistas, and the charm of
what Baedeker calls its ''air of confusion''.
Other examples range from the Imperial War Museum at the original
Bedlam -- well-known and close-in -- to the traces of the old Crystal
Palace site at more distant Sydenham and the oasis of the Morden Hall
park in the brick-built wilderness of South London. For anyone of
appropriate inclinations there is also the challenge of trying to
explore historical and literary London -- far from easy in a city that
has not only changed so much but where parts can change so fast.
Even where street plans have not utterly changed, the search for the
past can require prodigious acts of imagination. It is hard to invoke
the London of Dickens in modern Holborn or Chancery Lane, even the
Temple -- rather like trying to match post-war Nuremberg with the city
of Die Meistersinger. But it's just possible to stand on Westminster
Bridge and understand why Wordsworth thought earth hadn't anything to
show more fair, even if you don't quite agree.
My own answer to the threat of feeling ''tired of London'' (and the
implications of Johnson's epigram) also includes trying to add something
new and unexplored on each visit whenever practicable. Anyone more
methodical would probably profit from a list of as yet unvisited but
forthcoming attractions. If I dared such a compilation it would at last
get me on board the Docklands Light Railway and range from the Dulwich
Picture Gallery, the Oval, and the modern Army Museum in Chelsea to the
interior of St George's Bloomsbury, the Nicholas Hawksmoor church with
the most startling exterior in London. I'd even at last manage to get
across London Bridge to see the inside of Southwark Cathedral.
But there is no doubt where anyone who cares either for fine churches
or undervalued and endangered masterpieces ought to go. The City is a
dull place for shops and duller still for pubs but its surviving Wren
and other churches are cool and calm when St Paul's and Westminster
Abbey are stifled with tourism. But they are now endangered again, many
of them after restoration from wartime near-destruction and painful (but
often successful) struggles to find a role where few people live and
half a million work.
Let no-one think Scots Presbyterianism has a monopoly on the problems
the Kirk calls ''union and readjustment'', or of sometimes handling them
with aesthetic insensitivity and a capacity for wrangling and
ill-feeling. Some of the finest Wren churches may not fit readily into
the latest plans to ''rationalise'' the deployment of clergy and it may
be as well to see them when (with some help from the Mammonites of City
finance) most of them are still open, active, and admirably maintained.
Despite the wartime losses there are still enough of them to confuse
and even amaze the visitor. My own favourites are the easily accessible
St Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside and the more concealed St Stephen Walbrook
(behind the Mansion House) with the lovely dome which is said to be a
scaled-down version of Wren's original idea for St Paul's. But the best
plan is to wander round and venture in wherever a City church door is
open.
London can be full of disappointments, from the tawdriness around
Piccadilly Circus to the dreariness of Victoria Street, but it remains a
city with incomparable scope for personal discoveries and, for anyone
whose encounters span several decades, of golden memories of unexpected
places. I remember the joy of the wonderful library of Jacobite books
which that notable Scottish journalist Ion S Munro had gathered in a
slightly shabby, very genteel square at Mount Pleasant in the hinterland
of Clerkenwell. Some were the fruits of his sojourn as Rome
correspondent of the old Morning Post in the days of Mussolini. And as I
pass the solicitors, building societies, French bankers, and
odds-and-ends of modern Fleet Street I wonder what survives of the
marvellous woodwork panelling of the old Herald building.
But not all the discoveries are to be made in inner London and north
of the Thames. One of the happy coincidences of my life, for example,
was that I was living in the South London suburbs when I discovered one
of the strangest geniuses of twentieth-century English literature, Henry
Williamson (1895-1977). Most of those who recognise the name probably
associate it with Devon, and Tarka the Otter. A few people with long
memories also recall Williamson's naive and disastrous excursion into
scatterbrained politics, wasting his substance on riotous living as an
admirer of Sir Oswald Mosley.
Williamson will retain his niche in literary history as a novelist of
nature, thought the suburbs have long since sprawled over the Kentish
woods and fields, a cycle-ride from his home near Lewisham, which first
inspired him. But the next century will rediscover him, despite the
untidiness of his long semi-autobiographical novel-saga, A Chronicle of
Ancient Sunlight, for two very different reasons. Despite its
introspection, the earlier parts of the chronicle are South London
social history as well as literary achievement. Even more important, and
though written nearly 40 years on from the Somme and Passchendaele, they
are the English novel's only adequate equivalent, in depth and feeling,
of the war poetry of 1914-1918.
On and around the hill above Lewisham it is still possible to feel
oneself back in the world from which young Phillip Maddison went from
his insurance office to war and to which he returned on leave amid the
endurance, the mourning, and the incomprehension of the civilian world.
There have been population changes, as dark faces and incongruous
car-stickers for Irish Gaelic games testify, though less dramatically
than in more fashionable parts of London or the inner-city areas closer
to the Thames. South London, always a bit of an unknown country for the
tribes across the Thames, now has invisible local social and even ethnic
frontiers which are all but impossible for the outsider to understand.
But physically -- away from the main roads and shopping centres at
least -- this area between New Cross and Catford, like Blackheath on the
other side of Lewisham, is still less changed than most of London. And
the two best aids to appreciating Williamson are probably good histories
and memoirs of the First World War and a London street atlas, the more
detailed the better.
Now that I've looked out that atlas to check on the intricacies of
South London railways and Phillip Maddison's choice of stations (for his
nine-and-fourpenny monthly season to London Bridge) it occurs to me that
I'm not as tired of London as I thought.
Maybe next season I might even manage a day at Lord's again. Denis
Compton was still batting on my last one.

BUSINESS tycoon Owen Oyston yesterday appeared in court charged with
eight sex offences, including four rapes.
He was granted #50,000 conditional bail when he appeared before
Trafford magistrates in Greater Manchester.
Mr Oyston, 60, of Claughton Hall, near Hornby, Lancaster, is accused
of four rapes, three indecent assaults, and conspiring to procure girls
under the age of 21 to have sexual intercourse.
Reporting restrictions were not lifted.
Mr Oyston spoke to confirm his name and also gave his address to the
court.
Mr John Lord, prosecuting, made an application for a remand on
conditional bail. This was agreed by Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, defending.
The four rapes are alleged to have taken place between April 1988 and
December 1992, two at Claughton and one in London. No location was given
for the fourth charge.
The three indecent assault charges relate to a period between
September 1989 and December 1991. One assault allegedly took place in
Lancashire, another in Sale, Greater Manchester. The third locality was
not given.
In addition, Mr Oyston is charged between April 1, 1988, and May 31,
1993, with conspiring with another man to procure girls under the age of
21 to have sexual intercourse in any part of the world with a third
party.
The Mr Oyston's conditions of bail are that he resides at Claughton
Hall and pays into the court #50,000 as surety.
Mr Oyston was remanded until March 27.

TWO of the three M77 protesters arrested on Thursday were jailed
yesterday after they refused to accept bail conditions banning them from
''obstructing'' or ''interfering'' with employees of Wimpey
Construction, the builders of the motorway extension.
Mr Paul Murphy, 28, from Langside, and Mr Jake Hunter, 22, who gave
his address as a treehouse in the protesters' Pollok Estate encampment,
were remanded in custody until trial on February 27 at Glasgow Sheriff
Court.
Ms Frances Claxton, 20, from Maryhill Road, accepted the bail
conditions and was freed until the trial.
Uproar broke out in the public gallery as the two were taken to the
cells.
Mr Walter Morrison, a community councillor from Corkerhill shouted
''shame'' twice and was ejected by police.
Mr Lindsay Keenan, 30, from Linwood -- who earlier this week alleged
he had been assaulted during an incident in which then Scottish Office
Minister, Mr Allan Stewart, allegedly grabbed a pickaxe -- stood and
shouted: ''This is an absolute outrage.''
He was then dragged, shouting, out of the court by police.
Several other protesters then noisily left the court.
Mr Keenan was taken to the cells and released some time later. A
police spokesman said a report was to be sent to the procurator-fiscal
on the incident.
Speaking outside the court, Mr Morrison claimed: ''This just shows you
there's one law in this country for the rich and powerful and another
for the rest.''
The three protesters appeared in court charged with breach of the
peace following an incident on Thursday at a site on the M77 motorway
link, near Boydstone Road, Carnwadric.
It is alleged they ripped up metal fencing posts, throwing them on to
the ground and then obstructed a workman wheeling a barrow of concrete.
They are also accused of tipping the barrow over and kicking the
concrete about on the ground.
Depute-fiscal Mandy McGowan asked Sheriff Iain Pirie to impose special
bail conditions banning the accused from approaching, obstructing, or
interfering with contractors' workmen on the M77 link.
Mr Alan Miller, representing the accused, challenged these conditions
claiming the Glasgow office of the procurator-fiscal was attempting to
get an interim interdict on behalf of Wimpey through the ''back door''
of the criminal courts.
Sheriff Pirie adjourned the court while he considered the matter.
On reconvening, he struck the word ''approach'' from the bail
conditions while agreeing to implement the ban on obstructing or
interfering with the workmen.
* Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart resigned this week after an
incident on Sunday in Pollok Castle Wood, Newton Mearns. The Crown
Office was considering the possibility of legal proceedings.
The Eastwood MP's son, Jack, 16 and another youth David Clow, 16, were
also reported to the procurator-fiscal in connection with alleged
breaches of the Firearms Act.

<RECORDNO>979911140</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S business leader yesterday urged the Government to act to
close the biggest gap between the rich and the poor for 50 years. Mr
Howard Davies, director general of the CBI, said the time was ripe for
action and called for an end to ''political argy-bargy'' over poverty.
By investing in education and training, Ministers could address the
huge inequalities which were a ''drag-anchor'' on the British economy.
He said the growth in equality had had a ''particularly severe'' effect
on young people. More school leavers were leaving without qualifications
and putting the country at a competitive disadvantage.
At the same time, there was a need for companies to invest in skills
and training for all their workforce, not just key workers, as was the
case at present. ''Too many people in employment are not receiving
training and too many out of employment are not being trained,'' said Mr
Davies.
He added: ''The growth of inequality is an issue of growing concern to
business. It is not just a question of morality or social justice. If a
sizeable minority is unable to contribute, it is a drag-anchor on the
economy, and it pays the price.''
Repeating the CBI's calls for improved child care and in-work
benefits, and urging the Government to act now, he said the economy had
come out of recession and was relatively healthy.
Mr Davies warned: ''I hope this report does not simply become the
subject of political argy-bargy.''

The very idea of Icelandic cuisine may be enough to chill the heart of
the diner. But the new Glasgow restaurant which draws inspiration from
Iceland gets a warm reception from Margaret Hughes.
I HAVE never been to Iceland, and my only impression of the country is
of an ice-capped island that looks breathtakingly cold from the windows
of a transatlantic plane. Neither had I ever heard anyone extol the
virtues of Icelandic cuisine. So it was with great interest that I dined
at Glasgow's first restaurant that draws influences from Iceland.
Cathedral House Hotel looks equally breathtaking against the backdrop
of the floodlit Glasgow Cathedral and the brooding darkness of the
Necropolis. The turreted, red-sandstone building dates from the end of
the nineteenth century and comprises a cafe bar, the XO Restaurant, and
seven bedrooms. The restaurant is situated upstairs and is simply
decorated with dark wooden tables and chairs, lots of plants, and a
crackling fire.
With no prior knowledge of Icelandic food, except the assumption that
fish would feature prominently, I browsed through the extensive menu and
was pleased that it included lots of examples of good Scottish produce,
like venison, beef, salmon, and seafood. But I didn't feel there was
anything here which set the menu apart from any other restaurant selling
Scottish food. However, towards the bottom of the menu are ''Hot Rock
Specials'', the Icelandic speciality.
The choice of dishes under this heading on the menu included fillet
steak, langoustine tails, lamb, and salmon, all good Scottish
ingredients. Choosing one of these dishes means that the diner does the
cooking at the table on a ''hot rock''.
This Icelandic method of cooking is only available for main courses
and has been offered by the restaurant for several years now, mainly
because the restaurant wanted to offer something different. Since I felt
it was my duty to try that ''something different'' I opted for a ''Hot
Rock Special'' and hurried with eager anticipation through my starter of
steamed mussels on a herb crouton topped with spinach and nuts.
The mussels were delicious; the waitress assured me they were Scottish
and freshly delivered that day. The spinach was also very fresh, the
herb crouton and nuts made for an interesting combination of tastes and
textures, and as always there just weren't enough mussels.
I had decided to have a combination of fillet of beef and seafood as
my main course. Delightfully titled ''Surf 'n' Turf'', it reminded more
of California than Reykjavik. Deciding to stick with the Californian
theme, and because the fish and seafood dominated the meal, I chose
Robert Mondavi's Woodbridge 1992 Chardonnay from an extensive wine-list
that covered the globe. This is a fruity, dry wine in which you can
almost taste the sunshine of the Napa Valley.
The waitress brought my ''raw'' food to the table. It consisted of two
slices of beef and a selection of unshelled langoustine and prawns, and
was followed by the hot rock.
The rock is a piece of granite which is set into a heavy wooden board
and is brought to the table looking harmless enough, but considering
that it has been warmed in a very hot pizza oven all day, the food
sizzles as soon as it meets it.
I have to admit that I was slightly nervous. The table was slightly
wobbly and we had a near miss as I manoeuvred my hot rock and the table
top moved with it. Visions of the hot rock leaving its imprint on my
body flashed before me. Thankfully, the rock is so deeply embedded in
the wooden block that it would need to have been turned upside-down and
shaken violently to fall out.
A choice of three sauces are supplied -- plum chutney, fresh yoghurt,
and barbecue sauce -- and you are left to your own devices. Our waitress
was very helpful, explaining that it was up to me how long I cooked my
meat and fish, cheerfully assuring me that the rock would take a long
time to cool, in fact it wouldn't be properly cooled until the following
day. This did not make me feel better.
Things improved as soon as I threw the meat on the rock and it began
cooking. After a few minutes each side I decided to try it -- it cut
easily and tasted wonderfully tender. I had expected it to have that
smoky taste associated with barbecuing, but it didn't. The food does not
smoke too much, but the heat which is given off left me feeling a bit
too warm, and as it takes a long time to cool down, there is little
respite until it is removed.
I enjoy cooking, but I also enjoy other people cooking for me, so when
I had to peel the shells off the seafood and cook it, the novelty wore
off and I ended up eating only one of the prawns. I had expected that
the heat of the rock would sear it too much, but it didn't at all.
Several other diners had chosen to hot-rock their food and the
contented sizzle of the food added to the cosy ambience of the
restaurant. The majority of those had obviously eaten in the restaurant
before and were quite adept at it. One couple were sharing the ''Hot
Rock Fantasy'', which is available with meat or fish for two to share.
For those who would rather have their food prepared in the kitchen,
the turbot was lightly roasted and served with a good selection of
winter vegetables. There is also a vegetarian dish of the day, as well
as a selection of chef's specials.
Bananas were a strong feature of the dessert menu. Now I know these do
not come from either Scotland or Iceland and the waitress couldn't
explain their prominence; the chef obviously likes using them. I chose
choux pastry filled with cream and served with bananas on a caramel
sauce. It was a light, unfussy way to end the meal.
If you want to really indulge yourself, the trio of chocolate mousses
with a strawberry coulis is a chocoholic's dream.
Cathedral House's XO Restaurant has much to commend it: the food was
fresh and well-prepared and the service was excellent. The waitress was
friendly, helpful, and answered each one of my difficult questions with
a smile, no doubt bemused by my manic obsession that everything that
should be Scottish was Scottish!
Cooking on the rock was fun. It struck me that maybe this is just the
sort of thing the Scots can do instead of barbecuing -- it's not
dictated by the weather, smoke does not belch out all over the place,
and the food tasted great.
* XO Restaurant, Cathedral House, 28/32 Cathedral Square, Glasgow.
Tel: 041 552 3519.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
* The Ubiquitous Chip, 12 Ashton Lane, Glasgow. Tel: 041 334 5007
I PASSED by The Ubiquitous Chip every day for three years on my way to
university, but it wasn't until I graduated that I afforded myself the
treat of eating there -- again and again!
The Ubiquitous Chip is a bit of an institution in Glasgow, and its
recent Michelin Red ''M'' award is long overdue. Memorable dishes from
the restaurant include haggis, mashed tatties and neeps, venison
sausages, and home-made oatmeal ice-cream.
Good Scottish produce dominates in the restaurant and service is very
good. The wine-list is excellent and has itself been the recipient of a
number of awards.
* Cantina del Ray, King Court, Glasgow. Tel: 041 552 4044
THIS is a noisy, bustling and enjoyable way to go Mexican. From the
free shot of margarita and tortilla chips with hot salsa to the wide
range of Mexican dishes, it is a restaurant that buzzes.
The menu includes potato skins loaded with spicy chilli, fajitas with
giant shrimp and vegetarian burritos, in an atmosphere charged with the
energy of people having a fun night out.
Desserts include the very moreish cinnamon chips, which are deep-fried
tortilla chips smothered in cinnamon and honey, and served with
ice-cream.
The margarita is great, so is the tequila, but there is also a good
selection of imported beers.
* Pierre Victoire, 10 Victoria Street, Edinburgh. Tel: 031 225 1721
Lunchtime in most Pierre Victoire restaurants can be fraught -- tables
are usually full and waiters either a bit harassed or totally laid-back.
But at #4.90 for a three-course lunch, it is hard to complain.
The Victoria Street restaurant is hugely popular with shoppers, office
workers, and students clamouring for tables. Recent offerings on the
lunch menu included carrot and orange soup with rosemary, a selection of
vegetables in a Pernod sauce, and bread-and-butter pudding.
The food is simple, the portions just enough in the middle of the day,
and it is good value for money.

THE 500th birthday celebrations of Aberdeen University were truly in
the air yesterday when not only was a planet named in its honour but the
principal received greetings from a Concorde pilot, 51,000ft above the
earth, travelling at twice the speed of sound.
Back on the ground, the Prince of Wales joined the Queen Mother on the
list of honorary graduates of the university when he became a Doctor of
Laws.
The planet, which is to be named Aberdonia in honour of the
university, was discovered on September 21, 1987.
The university was the idea of William Elphinstone, Bishop of
Aberdeen, who identified the need for more clergy, teachers, doctors,
and lawyers.
His solution was to establish a local institution for those unable to
attend the existing universities of St Andrews and Glasgow.
Yesterday, the quincentenary celebrations and founder's weekend
started with a procession to the Cathedral Church of St Machar for a
thanksgiving service and the special graduation ceremony.
The Duke of Edinburgh, present in his capacity as Chancellor of the
University of Edinburgh, saw his son receive his honorary degree.
Honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees were conferred on His Eminence
Cardinal Pio Laghi, Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education;
The Most Reverend Richard Holloway, Bishop of Edinburgh and Primus of
the Scottish Episcopal Church; and The Right Rev James Simpson,
Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
Last night, a special founder's day dinner was held.
Today, the university receives the Freedom of Aberdeen in a service in
the Music Hall.

The offer sounded too good to resist -- and it was. A free cruise,
free flights, free board . . . and all Robert Grigor had to do was be
charming and bring along his dancing shoes. Here he reveals his diary of
a dream
Night-time? Dance,
Gentleman Host, dance
and dance again. Keep
smiling, feet!
THE ''Gentleman Host Program(me)'' unsurprisingly took shape in the US
in 1982. Originated by the wife of a cruise-line director who had
observed the preponderance of more mature women to men on board, it was
further developed, by Lauretta Blake more than six years ago.
Lauretta now heads up a worldwide organisation supplying Gentlemen
Hosts to most of the cruise lines of the western world. (There are
normally 10 Gentlemen Hosts, for example, on the QE2 and Lauretta will
know every one of them personally.) The Gentleman Host pays her a modest
weekly fee, but in exchange he can expect, with certain exceptions, to
have his flights to and from the liner provided. In addition his travel
on board ship, his laundry, his wine when hosting tables and his food
are free. Even his drinks bill is discounted by 50%.
So what's the catch? Well, he must have ''happy feet''. He's there to
dance. In my case, I faced a second ''vetting'' as BBC Scotland were
looking for a token Scot (most but not all Gentlemen Hosts are American)
willing to run the gauntlet with a film crew railing alongside. The
result will be broadcast this Tuesday on BBC1 at 9.30pm in the Ex-S
series.
The protocol is thoroughness itself, reflecting the wee ''c''
conservatism of middle America but redolent too of the romance of the
great cruise liners of Hollywood's golden era. Noel Coward. Cole Porter.
Black tie. White tux. Old world courtesies. However, unlike Cary Grant,
the Gentleman Host stops way short of ''Your place or mine?'' That
stricture is unequivocal. The penalty for breaching it? Disembarkation
at the next port of call. Make your own way home.
A word, finally, for the hard-pressed BBC licence-holder. All flights
for the film crew and myself, our travel and board, were courtesy of
Orient Lines. We thank them sincerely.
November 29-30
LUNCHTIME, I shuttled to London, meeting up with the Scots contingent
at Heathrow -- Martin, the ''sound man'', Richard, the director, and
Aileen, the assistant producer. It was reassuring to see her. Survival
instinct told me she carried the film's tight fiscal resources in her
sporran-belt. Ross, an affable soul, characteristically arrived
unannounced. His assistant camerman, Noel, had flown out earlier to East
Africa with the film equipment for Customs clearance. ''He's a 'dead
ringer' for Woody Allen,'' Ross told me. Later I was astonished how
right he was.
A Kenyan Airways Airbus winged us to Nairobi, where we hung around
until a scruffier machine headed us to Mombasa. Even allowing for a
three-hour time difference, we'd been travelling for more than 24 hours
and everyone was numb with fatigue. Scrambling on board ship, I blessed
the air-conditioning and located my cabin.
Unpacking, a tap at the door. Richard. ''Robbie, remember we have
tonight and tomorrow to rest up?'' ''Uh-huh.'' ''There's been a cock-up
somewhere. 'Fraid you're due to meet the other Gentlemen Hosts tonight.
You'll be introduced to the passengers and then do a bit of footwork at
the Welcome Aboard Dance. Sorry 'bout that.'' ''Will you be filming?'' I
inquired meekly. ''Of course.'' I watched the door close and sprawled on
the bed.
Alarm-called, I power-showered, shaved and bristled teeth, skooshed
with minty aerosol. On with the kit. White shoes, (leather soles,
please), white socks, white pants (trousers), white shirt (button-down
but not mandatory), blue sports coat (blazer), silk tie, matching
'kerchief. I targeted the Marco Polo lounge.
''Stop it right there, Robbie!'' the director hollered. Moments of
uncertainty. ''Right. Now!'' Round the corner, I ventured into a battery
of lights, snap-on smiles, energised handshakes to fellow Gentlemen
Hosts. Cameras whirred. Eyelids sagged. ''Cut -- that'll do.''
Mercifully, that was it. Spared the dancing.
Back in my cabin, I mournfully examined my ''happy feet''. The left
one, still swollen from the journey, looked particularly dismal. Into
bed. Sleep.
December 1
BREAKFAST was wondrous, lifting morale. Fresh pineapple slices, fresh
virtually any fruit. Melon and Parma ham. I swerved the waffles and
maple syrup. Scrambled eggs. Sausages. Crispy bacon. Hash browns. No
rolls, though. What a silly sacrifice to a pretend diet!
I had an hour to explore my new environment. Wall-to-wall lush
carpeting. Elevators to all floors. It was hard not to be impressed. A
casino here. A library there. An oasis of peace in the card room.
Swimming-pool. Helipad. Designer boutiques with tax-free advantage often
nullified by grabby profit margins. Gymnasium. Health spa. Jacuzzis.
Slot machines discreetly tucked in a quiet niche. Anyone for table
tennis? Bars, night-clubs, restaurants, barbecues proliferated. More
bars inside and out in the generous deck space. Thirst and hunger were
strangers to this lot.
I met up with the film crew at 11. Auntie had hired a black Hackney
taxi-cab to reinvent my arrival on the boat -- a visual jokette in the
boiling heat of Mombasa. The driver was a delight, ever smiling, trying
to please, but his apparent understanding of English, as events
transpired, was near total incomprehension. Constantly he confused ''Go
fast'' with ''Go past'' resulting in goodness knows how many ''takes''
for the simplest of shots. Anyway, thanks to him, the outcome was
hilarious and I won't forget his teeth-ground, magic smile, as he
finally opened the door of his mobile sauna.
Back on board, everyone trailed around to their meeting places for the
passenger emergency drill. The dulcet hurdy-gurdy Norwegian tones of the
ship's master over the airwaves generously thanked the passengers for
their co-operation. Ex-Captain of The Love Boat, I mused. That stacks
up.
I attended the Singles Get-Together but ducked the late-night dancing.
And, almost unnoticed, smoothly, sleekly, the Marco Polo slipped her
moorings and contentedly purred her independence as she set sail for
Zanzibar.
December 2
ZANZIBAR. Buses to-and-froed passengers to the market-place in Stone
Town. On one side, the still-standing, shameful slave market. On the
other, a small kirk, behind whose altar laid the remains of David
Livingstone.
The tour continued inland to the mainstays of the economy, the spice
and fruit plantations. Cinnamon, cloves, ginger, vanilla pods, chillis,
cumin seed, cardamom, pineapple, limes, coconuts. Everywhere coconuts.
Come midday, tropical rains plummeted for a while as locals took shelter
under fronds of banana leaves.
The party stopped to wonder as youths, a roped figure-of-eight wrapped
to their ankles, shimmied effortlessly up 60-foot palms, and the guide
intoned how good God had been to Zanzibar. The genuine friendliness of
the people set against their lack of schools, roads, hospitals, basics
we take for granted, would have troubled Scrooge. God could try harder,
I thought, while the merchants could help by paying real money, not
buttons, for this Garden of Eden.
Now at sea, and the sun set at 6.19pm. The Jewish Sabbath eve was
celebrated in the Charleston Club and Sailaway Bingo enticed the less
devout with Jackpot Snowball Prizes.
December 3
No land in sight. Except for ''must-do'' dance classes, a day of
relative freedom for the Gentleman Host. Until evening, that is.
The MV Marco Polo, with a day and a half to reach the Comoro Islands
(500 nautical miles away), gently tootled along in flat calm. At around
20,000 tonnes, it calls itself a medium-sized vessel which at full
capacity caters for 700 passengers. It claimed, too, to be the first
ship of its kind specifically designed for ''destinational cruising''. A
terrible mouthful, I know, but part of the glossy spiel. But with just
over 26 feet of her under the water, she could go places denied to the
mega-liner.
Shipboard activity is stepped up at sea but the highlight for the
punters had to be the formal Welcome Aboard Reception when the captain,
Erik Bjurstedt (''call me 'Eerick' '') greeted his guests with cocktails
and tasty bites. The frenetic rehearsals of curtsies made me ponder what
some would do were ''Eerick'' a royal.
December 4
ARRIVAL at Mayotte in the French Comoro Islands, surprisingly an
adjunct of the EC in the Indian Ocean. I escorted Shirley, the
archetypal Jewish American princess from Miami. A relative youngster at
76, widowed four times, she was all heart, energy-packed and crashingly
extrovert.
With Angeline, a French Canadian, and Bob, another Gentleman Host, we
ferried to Mamoudzou and taxied to the south of the island in search of
turtles. Our luck and the tide were out. These fascinating creatures
sleep off the reef at low tide, emerging only as the film gear was being
packed up. Camera-shy, maybe.
December 5
RED TAPE at Hellville (that's the name, honest) delayed the Marco
Polo's anchorage. But from 12 noon until way after two, guests munched
through endless burgers, hotdogs, and spare ribs, while iced tea and
Coke flowed on the Bounty Bar beach. In parties of around 20 (allegedly,
not to alarm the animals) guests processed to a lemur sanctuary.
These foxy-faced, monkey-bodied, catty-eyed beasties had clearly lost
their innocence grabbing bananas from unsuspecting hands. Yet curiously
these lower primates lived millions of years ago in Europe and North
America too. Here in Madagascar, they flourished due to an absence of
predators. We're the better for that.
As they flitted effortlessly through the branches, a larger
dismembered branch proudly took centre stage, held aloft by local
children. On their ''special branch'' a glum-looking emerald chameleon
clung three-toed to its dignity. A rotating eye nervously tracked
Shirley, the last to spot the hapless creature, as she shrieked: ''Oh my
Gaaad! Look at the shameleon!'' ''Chameleon,'' I rejoined. ''Shameleon,
Rabbie!'' ''Chameleon.'' The argument was going nowhere. Will
Shakespeare wrote plenty about Orlando, after all.
That night we set out on the long haul to Durban, South Africa, 1400
miles south-west.
December 6, 7 and 8
THE ship slipped forward as the clocks slipped back. But activities on
board dispelled any ennui three days at sea might threaten. Cruise
Enhancement Lectures. Origami. Bridge tournaments. Jazz by the pool. And
dancing. Dance classes every morning. Night-time? Dance, Gentleman Host,
dance and dance again. Keep smiling, feet!
But it was not all plain sailing. At 4am on the seventh, a violent
lurch propelled me floorwards. Some fared worse, sustaining minor
injuries. We'd hit a storm. Some 80% never surfaced for a day and a
night. In relative terms, then, I was one of the lucky ones. Elevators
ground to a halt. Sick-bags lined the railings. No sign of Alice.
The motion of the ship was uncomfortable but the crash and subsequent
shudder when sea parted company with boat only to violently re-assault
was positively white-knuckling. The Beaufort Scale registered Force 8 to
9 but wind speed was almost irrelevant. It was the size and
unpredictability of the waves. They were the great tormentor.
We hugged the Mozambique coastline to no effect. Starting from low
depressions in the Antartic, with no land for thousands of miles, the
Roaring Forties can flay and blast the sea to awesome proportions. In
these waters, supertankers snap like Kit-Kats. Others simply disappear.
To the old salt, I learnt later, the Bermuda Triangle is not the short
straw. And, why did we sight albatross . . . ?
December 9
THE seas abated and we arrived in Durban to docks, not anchorages.
There was a buzz about this beautiful city. I walked downtown to send a
couple of faxes. I was given such an over-generous deal for dollars to
rands that I later reckoned my faxes were freebies in exchange for hard
currency.
Afternoon, we bussed to the Valley of a Thousand Hills outside the
city. We passed the Rob Roy Hotel, the Dunrobin Garden Nurseries, the
Balmoral Tearooms, and the Kinbrace Arms. Was this really the way to the
Zulu heartlands?
In the country now, we were dropped at a craft shop. Then Zulu huts.
Then Zulus dancing. Well, sort of -- more high-kicking. Boom. Boom.
Boom. Kick. Kick. Kick. Not a lot to worry the Royal Ballet here. A mile
further on, we looked in on a crocodile farm. Lots of crocs doing what
they seem to do best. Nothing. The lush countryside, however, was
magnificent. If you can, go! But give the crocs a miss.
On the way back, our tour guide rattled off South African snippets.
For example, all houses, shack or shanty, will have electricity by 2000.
But on the downside, burglary is up. No use having an electric socket
without something to plug into it, I figured. The mineral wealth of this
country is bewildering. But he was getting too detailed now. I'm afraid
I lost interest as the boat reappeared.
December 10
THE friendly Filipino crew put on a Folkloric Show which met with huge
applause, more for their tireless efforts, I suspected, than for their
musical talents. They're not well-paid and they serve on board for
10-month stretches at a time (many with young families back home). But
recommended tips for, say, a cabin steward who tends 30 cabins, are five
dollars per cabin per day. Most retire in five years but an eager
waiting-list ''queues'' to replace them.
December 11
THE ship berthed timeously in Port Elizabeth at 7am. It was Sunday in
P E (local parlance) and I was hunting for a shop. A notice proclaimed
Ja! Ons is oop Sondag! Open on Sunday? I guessed right. Small in
comparison to Durban, P E is quintessentially English, with bungalows in
leafy surrounds, manicured lawns and tea roses. Jean Brodie would have
approved -- the twee area is called ''Morningside''!
For a smallish town, I marvelled at the size of the rugby stadium. But
these sports-crazed people have eight of them throughout the country and
the excitement generated by the Rugby World Cup is at fever pitch. It
follows, then, that sports sanctions hurt and hurt bad.
December 12
THE cruise liner followed the coastline round the Cape. On the port
side, little Robben Island with its one-man prison hove into view. Then,
gingerly, Marco Polo nosed into Cape Town, Table Mountain lying sentinel
behind as majorettes and jazz bands marched, twirled, and tooted along
the quayside. Below, three Dick Turpin lookalikes in velvet frock-coats,
tricorn hats, and silk hose either had taken leave of their senses in
the sweltering heat aggravated by an ozone hole above the city or had
taken a wrong turning for the pantomime.
''Look!'' passengers exclaimed excitedly, ''there's Woody! How did he
get ashore?'' as Noel filmed the ship's entry into harbour. ''By the
pilot boat, you goons,'' I muttered to myself. Cape Town, 3170 miles on
and for us the end of the line.

THE McDonald's fast-food chain is holding talks with a view to opening
its first outlet in a Scottish hospital, it was revealed yesterday.
The Southern General NHS Trust in Glasgow has confirmed that it has
been having discussions with the burger company about taking over one of
the units in its shopping mall.
Trust chiefs are consulting Greater Glasgow Health Board, which has
been actively promoting a food and health policy in a bid to improve the
diet of the city's population, about the move.
The shopping mall was opened five years ago and the unit in question
is currently occupied by a cafeteria run by the Red Cross. The charity
has failed in its bid to retain the let.
Mr Robert Calderwood, chief executive of the trust, said he believed
the introduction of McDonald's would give the hospital a full range of
catering facilities, including a staff restaurant and a coffee room in
the Institute of Neurosciences, both run by the in-house catering team,
and WRVS snack bars in the maternity unit and the rehabilitation
facility.
He said that no decision had been taken yet and the trust's board
would discuss the matter further at its next meeting later this month.
A trust spokesman said the retail units had been built as a commercial
venture and, after five years, the lets had been reviewed. The aim had
been to maximise the facilities for staff, patients, and visitors, both
in the quality of the service offered and the commercial return.
The hospital had always enjoyed a harmonious relationship with the Red
Cross but it was felt that the bid by McDonald's was ''the most
advantageous from all points of view''.
He added that Greater Glasgow Health Board had been consulted about
''the acceptability'' of McDonald's as far as GGHB's food policy was
concerned, and a response was awaited.
Launched two years ago, the health board's food and health policy is
aimed at improving the diet of Glaswegians and making them aware of the
importance of cutting the intake of fat and increasing the intake of
fruit and vegetables.
McDonald's has outlets at hospitals in the USA but its only British
operation of this nature so far is a restaurant which it has been
running at Guy's Hospital in London for more than a year.
Mr Robert Parker, spokesman for the chain, said the Southern General
venture was still at a ''speculative'' stage. Asked if McDonald's was
considering opening outlets at other Scottish hospitals, he said there
was no plan to target hospitals.
He added: ''We are looking at business opportunities throughout
Scotland. If other hospitals were to come along, we might be
interested.''
Questioned about the criticism frequently levelled against fast food
on health grounds, Mr Parker said: ''McDonald's food is nutritious and
we hope people would take it as part of a balanced diet.''
The possibility of a McDonald's coming to the Southern General was
described as ''a wonderful opportunity'' by nutrition expert Professor
Michael Lean of Glasgow University.
He said: ''I would see this as an opportunity for McDonald's to use
its skills to take on the responsibility of providing healthful,
balanced meals in a health outlet.
''I would be looking for any caterer in a hospital environment to take
on those responsibilities. If you are providing meals, they should be
balanced meals taking on the requirements of the prevailing food and
health policies.''
Professor Lean added: ''We cannot achieve dietary health in this
country without co-operation and enthusiasm from the food retail and
catering industries.''
A spokeswoman for the Glasgow branch of the Red Cross said: ''We have
run a cafeteria at the Southern General for many years and we were told
last year that we would have to tender for renewal now that the hospital
was a trust. We tendered and we were not successful. I don't know
anything about who is taking over.''
She added: ''Although it is a retail outlet, we feel it is also a
service which we are providing for people.''
It was run as a profit-making concern, she said, and the profits
helped the charity provide other services in the Glasgow area.

SHADOW Chancellor Gordon Brown yesterday called for a new war on
poverty and unemployment in a response to the Rowntree Foundation's
report that the gap between rich and poor in Britain is at its widest
for 50 years.
The responsibility for the rise of inequality lies squarely with the
Government, which has presided over a Britain now more divided than it
has been for generations, Mr Brown said.
''Making the rich richer has not made the poor richer,'' he said.
''A privileged elite has become richer at the expense of the vast
majority.''
Mr Brown, addressing the Local Government Anti-Poverty Alliance in
Edinburgh, said the true importance of the Rowntree report is that a
broad-based commission has demolished the central Conservative arguments
about their economic and social policies.
What is clear is that poverty and inequality can be tackled only by
dealing at root with their causes. By doing so, middle-income as well as
low-income Britain will benefit.
This requires not just a new understanding of what has gone wrong but
a new political will to do what is right in the interests of social
justice and economic efficiency, he said.
As the Rowntree report shows, the right-wing Thatcherite approach of
laissez-faire and deregulation has failed and been seen to fail.
However, Mr Brown added: ''What is also clear is that old solutions --
relying on an old welfare state which concentrates only on an ambulance
service for the poor, on the consequences of poverty, not its causes --
are also inadequate.
''Dealing with the consequences of this problem -- through the benefit
system -- can only alleviate it, not eradicate it. We need to deal with
the causes of poverty at source.
Mr Brown said the report shows that inequality of income in Britain is
higher than at any time for 50 years, wage inequality is higher than at
any time since 1886, and regional inequality higher than at any time in
the last 30 years.
Unemployment is costing every British family #20 a week, the direct
cost of economic failure, Mr Brown claimed.
Mr Brown said inequality and poverty had risen as a deliberate part of
the Tories' economic and social strategy.
While the wages of the bottom 10% of earners are no higher today than
in 1979, the pay of top directors was up 551% in a decade.
Addressing what needed to be done, Mr Brown said a major welfare to
work programme would help the young, families, and the long-term
unemployed.
The centrepiece of a programme to put the long-term unemployed back to
work should be Labour's #75 a week tax rebate to employers who took on
those who had been unemployed for more than two years.
This programme would cost #100m in its first year but would save money
in its second and get 300,000 long-term unemployed into jobs in its
first year.
Mr Brown said a new war on poverty was needed in the interests of the
whole community.

GLASGOW councillors arriving for the inauguration of a new Lord
Provost were yesterday greeted by angry employees.
They had to make their way past around 20 placard-waving shop stewards
from the city's museums and art galleries, who were protesting over
proposed jobs cuts and pay changes.
Mr Willie McGonigle, a steward for the Transport and General Workers'
Union said: ''We're protesting against plans to bring in part-time staff
at lower wages in museum shops in Glasgow.
Claiming the plans had been put forward by museum director Julian
Spalding, he added: ''We are also objecting to a proposal to cut the
number of museum assistant posts by eleven. We feel this will affect
security.''
They include replacing museum assistants in museum shops with a
mixture of part time and full time staff paid a substantially lower
salary.
''We understand that jobs which are currently done by museum
assistants will be done by people recruited on the council's lowest
salary scale -- around #3000-a-year less.''
Late last year, proposals by Mr Spalding to franchise the operation of
the shops to private companies were thrown out by Labour councillors.
A spokesman for Mr Spalding said nothing had been decided on the issue
since then.
On the subject of a reduction in job numbers, he said security would
not be compromised and no compulsory redundancies would take place.

SHETLANDER Ronnie Smith, was last night elected general secretary of
Scotland's biggest teachers' union, the Educational Institute of
Scotland.
Mr Smith, 43, a former principal teacher of Latin and Modern Studies
who became a full-time official of the union six years ago, succeeds Mr
Jim Martin, who resigned to take up a senior personnel post with leading
life assurance society Scottish Amicable.
At the first count, Mr Smith secured an overall majority of votes in
the EIS council -- the union's main decision-making body between annual
conferences -- which has about 140 representatives drawn from the local
associations, or branches, throughout Scotland.
He polled nearly 64% of the votes.
Obviously delighted to have been elected, he said last night: ''I have
some sense of honour that I have been given the chance to become general
secretary.
''I am also pleased that I got such support from the council, given
the strength of the field.''
He beat off challenges from fellow full-time official Mr Ian McKay,
and elected members Mr George MacBride and Mr Eric Young to win the
post, which carries a salary of about #48,000.
Some council members believed Mr Fred Forrester, EIS deputy general
secretary, should have been on the short leet for the leader's job.
However, they failed to secure sufficient votes for a move to postpone,
and make changes to, the selection process.
Mr Smith, who is married with two children, is a graduate in Latin and
Economic History of Aberdeen University. He has worked assiduously in
the background for the EIS on pay, conditions, and legal matters.
An official whose attention to detail is legendary, he has great
respect for the EIS, and is highly regarded among trade union officials
outside the institute.
He is an honest, modest, and popular man who has been happy to stay
out of the limelight, but that will change with his appointment to lead,
organise, and manage Scotland's fifth, and the UK's twelfth, biggest
union.

THE so-called ''Rout of Moy'' when a blacksmith and four farm
labourers turned back a Government force of 1500 men and a famous
MacCrimmon piper predicted his own death in the skirmish has,
understandably, always been overshadowed by the momentous events at
Culloden eight weeks later.
We've already seen that the incident at Moy threw up two Jacobite
heroines, Lady Anne Mackintosh, who despite her husband serving with the
Government regiment in Inverness, raised the clan for the Stuart cause,
and an innkeeper's daughter who is said to have run nine miles to Moy
Hall to warn Bonnie Prince Charlie of the secret night march and the
kidnap plan.
Lord Loudon had left Inverness convinced that he had sealed off the
town and that complete surprise would be achieved. However, the arrival
of the servant girl allowed Charles ''in his robe de chambre, nightcap,
and slippers'' to escape into the mountains, where he spent the night in
concealment.
Lady Mackintosh, having seen her Prince off safely into the night,
sent Donald Fraser, the blacksmith of Hoy, and four others to take up
position on the moor road from Inverness and await the Government
column.
The wily blacksmith ordered his companions to fire on his signal, not
in a volley but in a ''running fire''. From their hiding places the
Highlanders screamed the war cries of the Camerons, Macdonalds, and
Mackintoshes at the top of their voices. The smith himself is supposed
to have shouted: ''Down upon them and give no quarter''. All this, of
course, was designed to let the opposition think they were facing the
entire Jacobite army. Effective it was.
The advance guard under MacLeod of MacLeod broke and turned to run. In
the darkness and confusion they were convinced that the ''rebel'' army
lay before them. They fled and, according to the Jacobite version at
least, never halted until they reached the barracks at Inverness.
The only victim of this remarkable encounter was MacLeod's hereditary
piper Donald Ban MacCrimmon, reputedly one of the most talented pipers
in Scotland. Ironically, he may have been a Jacobite sympathiser. As
Fitzroy Maclean explains in his biography of Bonnie Prince Charlie, the
piper fell in that first salvo of shots, which was designed to give the
impression of an army in hiding. Before leaving Skye, MacCrimmon, who
was said to possess the second sight, had composed a prophetic lament --
''I'll Return No More -- MacLeod shall come back, but MacCrimmon shall
never''.
In his own account of the rout of Moy, Lord Loudon told of the
confusion among the main body of troops as the advance guard came under
fire. He had to stand in front of the muzzles to prevent his nervy
soldiers from firing on the advance guard as they drifted back in twos
and threes. When he came to count his troops he found that at least a
third had taken to their heels and decided that it would be ''improper,
especially in the condition of the men, to march on a superior force who
must be prepared to receive me''.
By morning Loudon discovered that 200 men had deserted and it was
decided to abandon Inverness and flee by the Kessock Ferry to Ross and
Cromarty. As they marched on an abandoned Inverness the doomed Jacobite
army had the upper hand and the initiative for the final time.

Hugh Ouston witnesses the death of a bird and wonders how much it
mattered.
FRASERBURGH in winter feels like the end of the earth. On the rocks at
the back of the pier the Arctic seemed just over the horizon to the
north and there, as if to prove it, swam a disorientated little auk,
like a starling-sized penguin in the cold boiling sea. Hardly had we
identified it than it took off, but something in its flight spoke of
weakness to the ever-watchful gulls and within a minute it was knocked
down, flipped over, tugged away, and finally gulped down whole by a
massive black-back. It was too far from home.
Little auks come down from the advancing pack ice in the winter but it
takes a desperate shortage of their food, zooplankton, perhaps driven
deep by stormy weather, to disperse them to our shores. Northerly gales
push these ''wrecks'', often thousands strong, down the east coast where
they end up on the lawns of seaside towns and on stretches of water far
inland. After the wreck of February 1953, over 180 of the little bodies
were picked up from the beaches of Berwickshire alone. Oil kills them
too, nearly 500 on the Aberdeenshire coast in 1970, though the Braer
incident seems to have spared this species compared to some.
In the calm days following a wreck survivors can be seen from
headlands buzzing north again. They are flying to rejoin some 30 million
others, for this is possibly the commonest seabird in the world. They
breed in huge colonies in those romantic-sounding high Arctic
archipelagos -- Spitzbergen, Franz Josef Land. I often think of the
death of that individual bird and wonder how much it mattered to the
species, but would rather not think too far, as a member of a species
numbering 50 million in these islands alone. Better to wrap up warm as
dusk comes on and turn away to a hot tea or a cosy howff.

What is good value in fishing tackle these days? Paul Young considers
the survival options.
I HAVE, perhaps, a spot of good news for my mother. I may be about to
grow up. Mind you, it's not entirely certain, but there are glimmerings.
In common with many mothers, she has, since I was about five, been at a
loss to know why I have never grown up, but surely every woman knows the
answer is that I'm a man and they never grow up.
The first hint of this impending maturity came one day on the Tay late
last season. I was fly-fishing one of the lower beats in a screaming
gale and was finding it difficult to cover the lies where the salmon
were tantalisingly heading and tailing. So of course, the inclination is
to wade a little deeper, and a little more and the next thing you know,
the weight of water at your back is pushing you downstream and you are
struggling to keep your footing. If you come across the double perils of
rolling gravel or large boulders and deep scours, it could be that you
are, as Eddie Waring used to say, ''in for an early bath''.
Now, I didn't actually get a soaking, but at one point I stopped and
took stock. Here I was in the middle of Scotland's mightiest river, a
wind gusting and pulling at me, finding it difficult to keep my balance
and I had neither a wading stick nor any kind of buoyancy aid or
life-saving equipment strapped to my ageing body.
In common with many anglers, life-preservation has perhaps come fairly
well down my list of priorities over the years. There is always the
thought that falling in either when wading or from a boat is the kind of
thing that happens to someone else. So far, I've been lucky but standing
there in the Tay, I felt very small and vulnerable.
I have taken a ducking once or twice over the years, but have been
lucky in that the events were fairly trivial. A summer evening on the
North Esk saw me misjudging a step in the darkness and ending up beside
the finnock I was trying to land. I have a memory of the fish splashing
in front of my nose and my bunnet floating off downstream. It was a mild
night, but even then I was not prepared for the shock of the cold water.
My first reaction was to take in a mighty breath . . . no problem if
your head is above water, but what if you went in face down? And in
February?
So, I decided that I wanted to give myself the best chance should an
accident happen. I got myself a wading stick -- a great help in
negotiating the underwater boulders -- but choosing a life preserver was
a more difficult matter. There are many options available and the most
important thing is to be aware of what you are buying and what it will
do for you.
There is a difference between a flotation device and a life-jacket and
between manually operated and automatic. The most important difference
is that a buoyancy aid will provide assistance to a conscious person who
can swim and is able to inflate the device, whereas an automatic
life-jacket will inflate on contact with water and keep the head of an
unconscious person out of water, turning them over if necessary.
Buoyancy aids tend to be smaller than life-jackets, sometimes coming in
the form of braces, while life-jackets can be incorporated into fishing
waistcoats or jackets.
It is worth thinking why you are buying one of the devices. I must say
I looked at a worse-case scenario. Let's say a frosty day with a cold
river in February or early March. Several layers of warm clothing and
the neoprene waders for extra warmth. You are in a boat and stand up to
warm the extremities and your partner asks you to hand him his tackle
bag from the front of the boat. You lean over to oblige, your foot
catches on the strap of your own bag, you miss the gunwale as you search
for your balance and your chest hits the edge of the boat. It dips as
your weight takes effect and you are in the water, severely winded.
The first thing you do is try to grab a breath, but you are face down
in the freezing water. This is when you are glad you are wearing an
automatic life-jacket to BS 3595. The gas capsule fires automatically,
the jacket inflates in an instant, throwing your body face-up, allowing
you to get that much-needed breath of air. You are floating down-river
and are picked up by the boat, freezing cold, completely soaked, and
still struggling for breath. But alive.
So, if I'm asked what I consider good value in fishing tackle these
days, I have to say that around #200 for a pretty good chance of
survival seems fine to me and beats one of those American rods at #500.
I know that sounds dull and boring, but I think it might just give a
hint of some kind of maturity. What say you, mother?

<HEADLINE>Blair hails the 'defining moment' of Cabinet disunity on single currency. Major's truce on Europe hit by infighting</HEADLINE>

THE Cabinet's fragile truce over Europe was in tatters yesterday after
senior Tories squabbled fiercely over the single European currency.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the ''defining moment'' of the
Cabinet's disunity on Europe had arrived, as Conservatives fought about
Thursday's speech by the Chancellor.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's speech was seen as being favourable to Britain
eventually signing up to a single European currency.
Mr Blair said ''the gulf between the Chancellor and his critics,
including those in the Cabinet, seems unbridgeable now''.
His comment followed remarks by the Cabinet's leading Euro-sceptic Mr
Michael Portillo, the Employment Secretary that it was ''unhelpful'' to
go beyond the position spelt out by the Prime Minister, that Britain
would not join a single currency in 1996 or 1997.
Former Cabinet Minister Lord Tebbit, warned Mr Major that his job
could be at stake. He said: ''Events are shaping up now very much in the
way they shaped before the fall of Mrs Thatcher. There is a divergence
of policy between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister.''
Some Euro-sceptics are concerned that, if Mr Major moves too far in
their direction, powerful Europhile Cabinet Ministers like Mr Kenneth
Clarke, Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, and Mr Michael
Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, could stage a coup to
replace him.
Mr Clarke, interviewed on ITN, accused Lord Tebbit of mischief making
and revealed that the Prime Minister had worked with him on the speech
he made to an audience of pro-European Tories.
He said: ''Norman has a habit of trying to make peoples' blood run
cold,'' adding, ''at least you have to admit I've got a debate going''.
Speaking in Oxfordshire, the Prime Minister defended Mr Clarke who, he
said, had pointed out that ''we are a long way away from the right
economics for a single currency.'' The Chancellor had done no more than
make the point he had been making since 1990, he added.
The Prime Minister has, in fact, obtained Cabinet unity over the
position in the next three years, made easier by the fact that few of
them believe that the economic convergence required to establish a
single currency can be achieved as early as 1997.
This view was supported by one of Britain's European Commissioners Sir
Leon Brittan, who added that, by 1999, ''a critical mass'' of EU members
would probably be able to go ahead.
Mr Blair interviewed on BBC Radio 4's World At One, said, that unless
the Government could come to a clear view ''not merely the Chancellor as
an individual'', it was extremely difficult to see how Britain's
interests could be properly represented.
He said that, if the economic conditions were right for considering a
single currency, a Labour government would have the task of ''political
persuasion'' that going for a single currency was the right course.
He said: ''You would have to carry the people of this country with
you.'' This appeared to acknowledge the possibility of a referendum.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: ''The
only guarantee of an honest and open debate is to let the people have
the final say.'' He appealed to the two larger parties not to try and
organise a boycott of the referendum debate his party is sponsoring in
the Commons on Monday.
Labour have announced a one line Whip, technically leaving MPs free to
vote either way without fear of being disciplined, but a clear
indication that the leadership would rather they did not vote at all.
Government Whips have yet to decide whether to try to actively
discourage Conservative MPs voting for the Liberal Democrat motion,
which calls for a referendum on any major constitutional change in
Britain's relations with Europe.
Europhile Tory MPs, who have consistently been outquoted publicly by
their Euro-sceptic colleagues, were hailing the Chancellor's speech as
the beginning of a fight-back and expressing their concern that Mr Major
has gone too far to try to keep the sceptical wing on side.
That wing, however, has shown its strength by obtaining 107 signatures
for a Commons motion congratulating the Prime Minister on his robust
approach to Europe.

THE battle of comic icons begins this summer when the hi-tech
firepower of Judge Dredd takes on Batman in a battle to build up the
biggest box-office takings. Val Kilmer will star in Batman Forever which
opens in June, while America's national holiday, the Fourth of July, has
been renamed Judgment Day for Sly Stallone's latest dip into mayhem and
destruction.
Stallone may have won the role but true Dredd heads will always
imagine Clint Eastwood as the man behind the mask. The letter pages of
2000AD had a thousand amateur artists' ideas of Eastwood as Dredd.
However, the decade it took to drag the character to the cinema screen
left only one true action man.
Dozens of scripts have been written since the movie options were first
bought in the early eighties by Charlie Lippincott. Writers such as Tim
Hunter and James Crumley have tried and failed to transfer the character
from the page to the silver screen. Success was finally made by a novel
approach in the early ninties when William Wisher, who co-scripted
Terminator II, was brought in and simply given a list of items to
include in the script.
''To be honest I got the impression, and it was semi-confirmed
afterwards, that Will Wisher had never actually read Dredd or been given
any to read. He was basically told to write an action movie and given a
shopping list of things to put in it.'' Said Kev Walker, a regular Dredd
artist and hired production designer. The shooting script now appears to
be by John Fasano and Steven E DeSouza.
However the director had long been familiar with the character. Danny
Cannon, the 25-year-old, who's directorial debut The Young Americans
starred Harvey Keital, grew up reading the violent exploits of the 22nd
century's supercop. On August 3 the $65m production began its 17-week
shoot in London's Shepperton studio.
The plot involves the framing of Judge Dredd by his clone brother
Rico. Dredd must then strive to clear his name and avert the actions of
the infamous Angel gang, which includes Mean Machine, a psychotic with a
giant claw for an arm and a dial on his forehead to control his moods, 1
means surly, 4 is just downright mean.
While in the comic Dredd drank down destruction without ever having to
lift off his helmet, Sylvester Stallone will, to the fury of some fans,
show the real face punks fear.

Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Judge Dredd is coming to the cinema
screens this summer. Stephen McGinty meets the character's creators.
JUDGE Dredd didn't pay for the eleventh-century church that Scots
comic writer Alan Grant lives in with his wife Sue, a ghostly monk, and
the 3000-year-old head of an Egyptian Princess. No. ''This is the house
that Batman bought,'' said the 44-year-old anarchistic author of both DC
Comic's caped crusader and the stone-faced 22nd-century lawman now
chiselled into the form of Sylvester Stallone and ready to be slammed at
cinema screens next summer.
The cape and cowl of Gotham City's dark knight were scuffed and on the
floor when Alan Grant and John Wagner picked them up. Detective Comics,
the character's debut title, was selling a little over 60,000 copies a
month and the decision to bring in Judge Dredd's powerful writing
partnership was a last stand before inevitable closure. John Wagner left
the title after writing five issues, then the movie was released. Such
was the hype for the latex Batman that sales soon jumped to a peak of
600,000.
It was the subsequent royalty cheques that paid for the converted
church in the little village outside Colchester where Alan Grant lives,
a 40-minute drive from the home of John Wagner, friend for 25 years and
the creator, with Spanish artist Carlos Ezquerra, of British comics'
strongest character. Joe Dredd first appeared in issue 2 of 2000AD where
the post-apocalyptic cop dispensed harsh and brutal justice to the 800
million bizarre inhabitants of the teeming Mega-City-One.
John Wagner, alone for the first two years and then with Alan Grant
for the next 15, squeezed a character and his own mythology into eight
pages every week. Judge Dredd quickly became a cult, not among the
law-and-order brigade who would applaud his extreme actions but among
fringe groups. Punks, goths, schoolkids, and academics, anyone who loved
a story, enjoyed dark humour and drank irony spiked with a little
arsenic. Thrash metal band Anthrax recorded a song, I am the Law, in
tribute. Joe Dredd/Mess with him and you'll wind up dead. Not a good
song, but a song.
However, Dredd's hour in comics is passing. The entrenched popularity
of the mid-to-late eighties is over. Sales of 2000AD have steadily
declined. Together Wagner and Grant have created an act which cannot be
followed, despite dozens of attempts. Many now in the British comic
industry believe 2000AD could close after the summer's big movie boost
is over. Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd will be a generic action movie
disguised as a comic character. Dredd will survive in the Megazine and
his two new American titles but what these two Scotsmen created was
more, much more.
ALAN Grant is driving a Honda Prelude, his personal batmobile, when he
collects me from Colchester station. Life in the quiet villages around
the Sussex town seldom imitates the mayhem packed into comic panels but
once in a while . . . It was only weeks after he wrote an issue of Lobo,
the best-selling comic about an inter-galactic hitman, in which Lobo's
bike is trashed by the mailman, that the word ''IRONY'' flashed on to
his windscreen with the impact of a hit-and-run Royal Mail van. Grant
pursued but unfortunately didn't have the necessary weapons to finish
the story.
Soon we are winding down a farm track and the tale with it. Arriving
at the church, which is mentioned in the Domesday Book, I remember
Rebecca and ''Last night I dreamt of Manderley . . . '' It's that
impressive. Built in 1125 on the site of a Roman church, its
stained-glass windows are among the best in Britain, untouched by
Cromwell. The gravestone of a women called Martha Death lies against the
house wall and the surrounding fields contain over 180 graves.
It feels strange to come to a house so steeped in the past, to talk
about the distant future and a man and a world that will never be.
Beside the fire in the raised living-room and in front of the stone
crosses, dinosaur fossil, and antique statues of Buddha, Alan Grant sits
crosslegged and talks with an unplaceable Scots burr.
He was born in Bristol in 1949, and his parents soon moved to
Midlothian. A perfect score in his arithmetic O-level led to a brief
peek into banking before he moved to Dundee and an apprenticeship in
words with D C Thomson. There he wrote horoscopes, subbed novels, and
met John Wagner, a flatmate's friend. The teenage boys sealed a
friendship over a boozy lunch that led to Grant drinking with punks in
the pub toilet.
Wagner, who was born in America before being brought across the
Atlantic to Greenock, was also working at D C Thompson at the time,
before following Grant to London and IPC Magazines where he worked on
Honey, Sandy, and Princess Tina. Growing increasingly depressed while
working on the sixties teen magazine, Love Affair, Grant left to become
caretaker of Cromarty House in the north of Scotland. ''To the locals my
girlfriend and I were John and Yoko, we had the hippie hair and big
coats.''
Grant returned to Dundee to tackle Highers he already had as an easy
year. But was hauled before the principal who demanded to know what he
aspired to. Thinking on the spot, Grant answered: divinity. ''I didn't
even know if there was such a course but within a weekend he got me a
place in St Andrews.'' Wagner was the replacement caretaker in Cromarty
but was fired after a house guest stole the slates.
Darkness has descended by the time John Wagner, a quietly spoken hulk,
too tall for his jeans, arrives and sits down with the story of Dredd's
creation. As a unit, Wagner Grant, as their comic credit often read, are
inseparable, and can finish each other's sentences. But drama is
personal and a few years ago they split the writing chores rather than a
friendship. Recently, however, they've returned and collaborated on The
Bogie Man and both Batman/Dredd team-ups.
''Writing comics I have always found that bastards work, and Dredd is
a beautiful combination of good guy and bastard. The idea was to have a
cop who wasn't just a cop, but far more authoritarian. A man who would
administer laws that were extremely harsh.'' The comic 2000AD was
launched by the first editor, Pat Mills, and John Wagner in 1977; the
name ''Judge Dredd'' was thought up by Mills for another character but
given to Wagner's new supercop.
Dredd's look, his Lawmaster bike, and the city itself were designed by
the character's first artist, Carlos Ezquerra. Speaking in London he
said: ''He had to look like what he was, Judge, Jury, and Executioner,
and the eagle on his shoulder represented Justice.'' Wagner also gave
Ezquerra the poster from the movie Death Race 2000 as a guide which
ironically starred Sly Stallone.
In over 700 issues of 2000AD Judge Dredd has never removed his helmet,
yet the idea behind the notion was accidental. In a very early issue
Dredd removed his helmet but the artist drew such a wimpy face that it
was blacked out and a strip which claimed it was too horrible to view
replaced it. John Wagner then milked the idea for laughs.
The 22nd century imagined by Wagner and Grant is a totalitarian police
state controlled by the Judges, men, and women who enter the Academy of
Law as five-year-olds, and emerge 15 years later in love with the very
letter of the law which bans sugar and restricts smoking. You would
expect the authors to weep at the weakness of the Criminal Justice Act.
John Wagner is more interested in the dark laughter Dredd draws from
his over-the-top behaviour. Often stories were ripped from tabloids and
spun 100 years into the future. There was always a strong element of
cultural reflection to Judge Dredd. When Conservative MP Harvey Proctor
was deselected, a spanking incident would take place at Harvey Proctor
block. Stacy Keach was released for possession of cocaine in the week a
Kacy Steach story appeared about sugar. ''It was of its moment.'' said
Grant.
One story, however, in which the shroud of humour was removed
concerned the democratic movement and how the Judges crushed and
destroyed it. It evolved into a graphic novel in which Wagner wrote:
''Freedom -- Power to the people -- Democracy . . . The Great American
Dream. Don't kid yourself. We tried to before. Believe me, it didn't
work. You can't trust the people. So dream on, creep. But just remember
-- that's all it is, a dream . . . America is dead. This is the real
world.''
When director Paul Verhoeven took over the cameras on Robocop, he
demanded that the script be beefed up and the tone brought in line with
a comic he had read. He then gave the writers copies of Judge Dredd to
study. Science-fiction writer Harlan Ellison in his review wrote: ''It
is also, clearly and shockingly, a rip-off of the Judge Dredd comic
strip . . .'' The cinematic potential of Judge Dredd has been recognised
since before it was first optioned in 1983. Dozens of scripts and
treatments were written including one by Wagner and Grant.
A few years ago the comic writers worked every night for a couple of
months and believed they had found a way to translate the
two-dimensional character, successfully, on to the big screen. However,
when money was discussed they were offered only 20% of the
screenwriters' minimum. Despite borrowing the Hollywood agent of Batman
screenwriter Sam Hamm to negotiate, the figure was never raised, the
treatment never delivered.
Now with the film directed by Danny Cannon, a regular ''Dredd head'',
and starring Stallone and Armand Assante, John Wagner appears to be more
relaxed. Sylvester Stallone called. ''We had a chat and exchanged mutual
compliments. He seemed to have a good grip of what the character was
about.'' But Wagner never visited the set.
''A lot of people are carping about it and worrying that it's not
going to be true to Dredd, but myself, I don't care. The criteria for
making a movie are different from that of making a comic and they have
to do what they have to do. From what I've heard, visually, it will be
spectacular. I'm looking forward to seeing it . . . I don't care if we
have to see Sylvester Stallone's face . . . Dredd is yesterday's news
and I'm happy to let him trundle along.''
The next morning I travel to London by train with Sue Grant and her
merry band of passengers protesting against British Rail's decision to
ban smoking. Each morning the squad of smokers hijack a compartment,
remove the No Smoking signs and light up. Both BBC and ITN have focused
on their actions and despite harassment by Transport Police there have
been no arrests. With both train and occupants hurtling towards the
future, I can only shudder at how Dredd would react.

While chewing the fat Norway resists international pressure to stop
hunting the minke whale. Elizabeth Buie reports on the reasons behind
the country's traditional obstinacy.
WHEN it comes to whales, the Norwegians have something of a blind spot
-- although, from their point of view, it is those of us who live in the
non-whaling nations who are blinded by prejudice.
You treat whales like the Indians treat cows -- as if they are sacred
-- the Norwegians tell their critics. For they believe that there is
nothing god-like about the whale, that whales are part of their marine
resource, and if the minke whale population can be sustained even with a
limited number being hunted each year, why should they be treated in any
way different from fish?
This nation with its almost unparalleled record in environmental
protection is determined that the international community should give
its blessing to a resumption of commercial whaling, albeit on a
controlled basis. Yet it faces very strong opposition, often led by
Britain.
In 1985, the International Whaling Commission's moratorium on
commercial whaling came into effect, but its ruling included a clause
stating that by 1990 the commission had to undertake a comprehensive
assessment of the effects of the moratorium on whale stocks and to
consider modifying the moratorium and establishing other catch limits. A
revised management procedure of whale stocks was to be set up by the
Scientific Committee of the IWC, but at IWC full meetings in 1990, 1991,
and 1992, the commission failed to re-evaluate the moratorium and catch
quotas, specifying instead new conditions that had to be fulfilled
before catch quotas could be discussed.
Interpreting this as delaying tactics on the part of the non-whaling
nations, Norway made a unilateral decision to resume whaling in 1993 and
for the past two years has set its own quota of under 300 minke whales
to be caught for commercial sale.
By formally reserving its position on the IWC's moratorium, Norway
retained the legal right to resume whaling. But its unilateral action in
resuming whaling over the past two years -- without international
backing -- has resulted in some of its goods being boycotted. It is
therefore important for Norway to have its commercial whaling operation
''legitimised'' by the IWC and for the past two years it has been
pushing IWC members to reach agreement on the supervision and control
aspects of commercial whaling -- two areas which are central to the
conclusion of any Revised Management Scheme which would allow Norway and
other pro-whaling countries to whale under the aegis of the IWC.
For this reason, 53 delegates from 14 IWC member countries -- members
of the IWC's working group on supervision and control -- met in Reine, a
sprawling fishing village in the Lofoten Islands in the part of Norway
that reaches into the Arctic Circle, last week to discuss subjects such
as placing international supervisors, in addition to Norway's national
inspectors, on board whalers.
But Norway's hospitality to the delegates backfired to some extent. In
a bid to show the anti-whaling nations that the small coastal villages
of northern Norway have a long-standing tradition of whaling and an
economic need for whaling revenue, the Norwegians miscalculated.
Certainly, whaling in some form or other has been carried out in these
waters for hundreds of years, but the modern whaling method using
motor-powered fishing boats and modern harpoons is only about 50 years
old.
Delegates, told that the communities on the Lofoten Islands would
suffer disintegration and economic hardship with the loss of whaling
revenue, visited communities of virtually full employment, comfortable
housing, high-quality hospitals and schools, and an infrastructure of
roads and bridges that would be the envy of many rural communities in
Scotland, never mind other fishing communities throughout the world
which have undergone much more radical changes to their industry.
It is true that in the late 1980s, Reine and its neighbouring fishing
communities did face lower incomes, with cod quotas cut because stocks
were low, and no income from whaling. Fishermen who had caught cod in
winter and minke whales in the summer saw their livelihoods if not
threatened, then reduced, and banks agreed to give them a two-year
''holiday'' from their interest repayments. Now, however, thanks largely
to Norway's effective conservation measures, cod quotas have been
increased. Last year, a typical coastal fishing boat, between 50ft and
75ft long, with a crew of six or seven, made between 1.2m and 1.5m
kroner and an additional 400,000 kroner from whaling -- from an average
quota of seven minke whales.
The Norwegian whalers and their families protested strongly that they
did not make that much money from whaling, that it was not worth their
while cheating, and that it was just wonderful to eat whalemeat again.
The local fishermen's union and the fishermen's wives' association
presented a petition to the delegates from the United States, the United
Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, charmingly called ''A Word of
Admonition to Whaling Opponents''. They asked the British and Australian
authorities to withdraw ''the allegations of cruelty with which they
brand our local communities and our local culture''. In a particularly
pointed attack upon the British, the community representatives said:
''In the light of British hunting legislation and practices, the British
Government is not in a position to criticise the hunting legislation of
other countries.''
But if Norway is to convince its opponents -- opponents who are
self-confessedly against the very principle of whaling and who will
continue to vote against commercial whaling for political reasons, even
if they might be persuaded on scientific grounds -- it must prove itself
whiter than white.
Last year, one whaler, the Dag Senior, took a whale over and above its
quota while the Norwegian inspector slept below. Other whalers claim
that they have been let down by their colleague and that he will never
again be issued with another whaling licence. But the incident serves
only to add weight to non-whaling nations' demands for independent
international inspectors to serve on board the whalers and it proves the
financial incentive to cheat.
An Australian scientist carrying out DNA analysis in Japan's major
fishmarkets found minke, fin, and humpback whalemeat from north-east
Atlantic waters. Some conservation groups are convinced the whalemeat
came from Norway.
In 1993, a large package marked ''frozen prawns'' was spotted by an
SAS cargo handler at Fornebu airport at Oslo as it was being loaded on
to a cargo aircraft. The package was oozing blood and on inspection
turned out to be a 3.5 tonnes shipment of whalemeat to South Korea.
Such infringements have not been common, but as long as there remains
a huge demand for whalemeat in Japan and other Far Eastern countries,
there will be a temptation to break international rules.
For this reason, the ''like-minded'' opponents of whaling are
determined to make Norway pay if it is to resume whaling with the IWC's
say-so. The conditions for any Revised Management Scheme set by the IWC
must, they say, be extremely stringent -- international observers on
board every vessel, satellites and transponders fitted to each vessel,
DNA testing, and a number of other measures. All these measures would be
extremely expensive, but Norway insists that the costs should be met by
all IWC member states. Not surprisingly, the delegates from the
non-whaling countries are not prepared to go home and ask their own
taxpayers to finance a practice of which they disapprove.
The Norwegians' arguments about animal cruelty will not wash either.
They claim that in the past two years, inspectors have reported that
around half the minke whales have been killed instantaneously. Of the
whales that took longer to die, one was alive for around 30 minutes
after being hit, another 57 minutes. The Norwegians admit that they
cannot guarantee 100% success in achieving instantaneous kills. But the
British, among others, maintain that their current record is not good
enough and that there is no real likelihood of a significant
improvement. And the British delegation will not be swayed from that
view by Norwegian claims that deer-culling, fox-hunting, and British
slaughter-house methods are also cruel.
Five days of debate in Reine, then, ended in deadlock last week.
Delegates would only say that they now understood each other's positions
in greater detail. No real concessions were made. And so it is likely to
continue at the IWC's conference in Dublin this May.
The fear is that were Norway to be granted the IWC's approval for
commercial whaling, however limited, Norway itself would extend its
catch to other species of whales; Japan, an IWC member, would also take
up commercial whaling; other non-member countries such as Iceland and
Taiwan would follow suit; and before too long quotas would creep up to
again threaten the survival of many species of whales.
Both sides are now engaged in a waiting game. The Norwegians believe
that their persistence and scientific arguments will eventually win the
day. And their critics believe that if whaling is outlawed for long
enough, the younger generation of Japanese consumers will have lost
their taste for whalemeat and the market for whalers will be lost. It is
a game for those with deep pockets, and plenty of patience -- but the
gains and losses are considerable.

UNLIKELY heroes were in vogue in 1985, as tomorrow night's edition of
Scottish Television's Time of Your Life will reveal as the programme
continues its weekly look back over a decade of change.
Innately and perennially dishevelled, Bob Geldof succeeded in
marshalling the many tribes of rock and pop into a cohesive whole --
Live Aid at Wembley Stadium -- in order to make music and provide
succour for Africa's starving. Later that same summer, at another of
London's hallowed sporting arenas, Lord's cricket ground, Freuchie
journeyed from the far north and defeated the English at their own
googlified game.
Under the wily tutelage of skipper David Christie, a silver-maned
veteran of the outfield, Freuchie overcame Rowledge to lift the National
Village Cricket Club Championship. In the same year, golfer Sandy Lyle
claimed the British Open for Scotland, and everyday Scottish heroes
protested against apartheid during an athletics meeting at Meadowbank
which featured South Africa's Brit-by-invitation, Zola Budd.
Meanwhile an unimpressive-looking chap with a red stain on his bald
pate became leader of Soviet Russia, and in the middle-class heartlands
of Scotland, a steep rates revaluation caused heroic surgings in the
blood of the property-owning bourgeoisie.
Outraged of Kelvinside didn't quite take to the streets bearing
Molotov cocktails in a spontaneous and bloody revolt, but there was much
apoplectic exhaling of All Bran over breakfast tables as the horrifying
news sank in, I can tell you.
Among Scotland's local musical heroes in 1985 you could find a
shaven-headed gay rights activist with a wondrous falsetto voice --
Jimmy Somerville singing You Are My World with the Communards -- and a
golf-playing Derbyshire exile -- Lloyd Cole and his Lost Weekend.
And in 1985 one undisputed Scottish hero departed this world forever
when Jock Stein died in harness as Scotland's manager.

Elizabeth and Ian Mason have packed a great deal into their 80-odd
years and into their art collection, finds Clare Henry.
WHEN Elizabeth and Ian Mason talk about their ''collection of a
lifetime'' it's not just words -- and not just one lifetime. Elizabeth
reaches into a great drawer and comes up with paintings from the 1830s
by her great-great-grandmother.
''Moreover,'' she says proudly, ''all my three children were brought
up within the order of artistic sanctity!'' But then too so was she, and
her mother, as far back as Granny McIndoe from Rothesay who painted
eight precise and very lovely studies of fruit, before packing them
carefully and setting off with her printer/publisher husband on a ship
for New Zealand. ''They were nonconformist. His father was Provost of
Rothesay. The spirit of these women. Setting sail into the unknown for
weeks on end with small children,'' exclaims Elizabeth admiringly.
Art continued to play its part. When Elizabeth's father died, her
mother Sarah became art teacher at Archerfield School near Dunedin.
Sarah was the first pupil at Wellington Art College under their first
teacher, Glasgow Boy James Nairn, who started off in Lenzie, and was one
of the leaders of the pack until he left for New Zealand in 1889.
''My mother got a glimpse of the French Impressionism via Nairn, and
wanted to see the real thing. Eventually she saved up #1000 in guineas
to sail from Christchurch to Paris with her friend Frances Hodgkins --
who's the only New Zealand woman painter in the Tate. But then she met
the handsome Scotsman John McIndoe in Dunedin. She had good legs -- like
me. He went back to Wellington and built a house for her. It proved
irresistible. She cancelled her plans for Paris and married my father.''
Mason's was an ambitious family. Her elder brother became the famous
plastic surgeon, Sir Archibald McIndoe. ''I wanted to be a painter but
it wasn't allowed. My mother thought I might 'get mixed up with men', as
she put it.''
So instead Elizabeth Mason went to Girton College, Cambridge, to study
zoology and later started collecting pictures. Her ''collection of a
lifetime'' includes works by Pat Douthwait, Margaret Morris (''I
attended her pregnancy classes in Glasgow!''), Fionna Carlisle, and
autumn trees by Sir Nicky Fairbairn.
At university she met Ian Mason who became a world expert on animal
breeding. ''I saw he was that rarity: a good man.'' Now both over 80,
they travel a great deal, and always have, beginning when Elizabeth went
to Italy to study prawns, then joined Ian in Algeria where they got
married.
Elizabeth's life continues to read like a novel: Tahiti for her
eighteenth birthday in the 1920s (her mother's watercolours of the
tropical palms and beaches provide a permanent reminder); then the
first-ever tourist visit to Russia for #18 all in. (''It was extremely
cheap even then.'') Long trips to Greece where the family now own no
less than three houses, and 10 years in Rome when Ian was with the World
Health Organisation and Elizabeth made the costumes for Noel Coward's
Bittersweet. ''I have had a very adventurous life. And it's all recorded
in a composite picture -- including a passion flower -- Ian commissioned
in 1989 for her 80th birthday from Tom Wilson.
''Our first purchase was a Shakespearean scene by Alex Zyw. It cost
#50. Ian was earning very little in the zoology department. I was
demonstrating three times a week for which I was paid 15 shillings. It
took us a year to pay for it. I like its subject, the theatricality, its
design and colour. I had a feeling I wouldn't tire of it. Fifty pounds
was quite a lot of money in the early 1950s. I must have wanted it
badly. We've lived with it for all these years and still like it. A
wonderful test of a good picture.''
The next picture, Miracle of Cana, or, as Ian calls it, the
wine-making picture, is by Zelko Kujandzic, a Yugoslav trained as an
icon painter. ''He grinds his own colour. It's not a religious picture
but it does look like an icon.''
Perhaps her most prestigious paintings are the Bellany and two early
oils by Elizabeth Blackadder. ''I had two Bellanys. I gave one to Ricky
Demarco for one of his art auctions when he was in debt. I must have
been mad!'' The Blackadder landscapes from the 1960s ''encapsulate my
two favourite kinds of life: one rich, lush, Mediterranean: the other
pale, cold, Scottish, with a distant church. It reminds us of our home
in Auchtiebuie.''
The Masons have several works acquired from Ricky Demarco over the
years. ''I'm a great Ricky fan. We support his aims. We got our 1968
Neagu picture, our 1967 Ian McKenzie Smith, Erland Brown's picture,
which provides a good journey for the eye, and much more from Ricky.''
They also support the very young and buy from art college shows.
Other treasured pictures include Chagall's drypoint of The Daughters
of Lot; Will Maclean's early oil of a large wave, skate and wheelhouse,
''which speaks tragedy to me''; Edward Gage's landscape; a decorative
David Michie (''which gives me joy''); Peter Bourne's House on the Hill;
Lys Hansen's vigorous female; Anne Gordon's blue flowers; a tiny
Philipson; George Garson's 1966 tile mural (''he taught at Glasgow. I
liked him very much'') and Jack Knox's Third Eye retrospective.
''It's very Matisse, luscious food captured with a wonderful economy.
Cost us #25.''
Even the kitchen is full of pictures: including a Michael Windle.
Their most recent buy, a Steven Campbell, titled Children of the
Mermaid, was acquired from Glasgow's Hardie Gallery just before
Christmas. ''It's so gentle, a lovely quality of paint -- just
wonderful.''
TIP OF THE WEEK
''YOU must decide to buy your picture on merit, not on the name of the
artist or even on the subject. You can also wear art: sport style with a
certain elegance. Art should be fun,'' says Elizabeth Mason.

Lager has a certain reputation, but that's changing with the arrival
of a cask-conditioned version, finds Andrew McKay.
KEN Brooker, the man from Harviestoun Brewery at the foot of the
Ochils, has weaved his magic again. He enjoys a challenge and this time
his art has been well rewarded. Quantities of lager malt, Hersbrucker
lager hops, and lager yeast have been mixed and brewed in the
traditional way. It does not take a rocket scientist to deduce that the
final product will be lager -- of a kind.
But there the similarity ends -- the lager is served ''on the yeast''
at cellar temperature and dispensed through a hand pump without
filtering or the injection of gas.
It isn't a lager resemblant of those produced by the nationals,
ice-cold to touch and taste, and with a head formed from big bubbles.
Neither is it of the lager breed that has been inoculated with a mix of
carbon dioxide and nitrogen gases to produce a creamy head of small
bubbles, but which is still cold in the hand.
What Brooker has created is a ''real'' lager, cask-conditioned and
more like a traditional ale in many respects but with a definite lager
flavour and colour. It has a whisper of a name, Schiehallion, which
evokes elegance and yet has the makings of a battle-cry.
The truth behind such titles invariably reveals a tale; there is no
departure from this with Schiehallion. The brewery was looking for a
name that had a Scottish sound and which stirred the imagination. Many
of its beers go to the South of England, where people are eager to
sample a brew that is far travelled.
The brewery was especially keen to avoid a pseudo-continental name
that had pretensions towards a German town. Schiehallion rolled nicely
off the tongue. It is also the name of a mountain to the west of
Pitlochry often known as the mountain of the fairies, and an oilfield in
the North Atlantic.
Perhaps it is the use of the Hersbrucker hops that has given the beer
its distinct flavour, but it certainly has taste and a bit of a kick
with an ABV of 4.8%. At the moment the brewery is producing 10 barrels a
week.
If you can find it in the west you will be lucky (or in the know). In
Edinburgh, where drinkers are more discerning with beers, the response
to Schiehallion has been good among pub-goers and biased reports confirm
a demand for more supplies. Because of its character it is unlikely to
appeal to the hardy annual of a lager drinker, but it may appeal to
those who on a night have a feeling for something different but with the
lager taste.
In the west the lager's testing ground is the Golf Inn, Bishopton, and
the Boswell Hotel, Langside. Eric Bryce of the Golf Inn has had more
than a silver wedding of years pouring ales to those in search of
something different and he has a tea-chest of pump clips from all over
the country to prove it.
Cellarman visited him recently in his Bishopton pub where economy of
furnishings is adequately compensated for by that vital ingredient,
atmosphere. His enthusiasm for beer overflows as he recalls ales and
their personalities. He talks about foot pumps, beer engines, kegs,
barrels, gases with a passion and will even throw in a house ghost for
good measure.

* Over a glass of Queen Victoria's favourite champagne, Gordon Yuill
-- manager of Glasgow most stylish restaurant, Rogano's -- reveals his
own restrained eating habits on a working day.
HAD a typical restaurateur's breakfast -- a cup of strong black coffee
and two slices of toast about 9am. Arrived at work about 9.30. Lunched
late as usual, about 3.30pm, after the restaurant's busy period. Then
had my favourite dish, lemon sole on the bone with some green leaves
(lollo rosso, endive, some basil) and sauted potatoes -- good clean
healthy eating! No soup, no pudding.
Had a cup of tea in the afternoon -- good old Tetley -- but nothing to
eat with that. Late supper in the office as usual. There are too many
distractions for me to enjoy eating in the restaurant.
Around 11pm up went the cry ''Supper for the boss''. Out as usual came
smoked salmon and scrambled eggs with some toast. A glass of Joseph
Perrier champagne (the house champagne, #5 a glass, and just absolutely
beautiful) got me through until closing time between 1 and 2am.
Gordon Yuill was speaking to Lesley Duncan.

Elizabeth Buie enjoys a gourmet meal that comes calorie-counted
AT first glance, it seems like a contradiction in terms -- a
five-course calorie-counted dinner in a French restaurant. The whole
concept begs the question. Is there any point in going out for dinner if
you are going to check the fat content of each course, scrape off every
vestige of sauce au vin blanc, and wave away the waiter as soon as he
hoves into view with the cream jug? Fortunately, the French restaurant
chain Pierre Victoire has decided that those of us who have been more
gourmand than gourmet in recent months need not place themselves in
self-imposed culinary purdah.
For #14.90 a head, including coffee, they offered a five-course dinner
which was billed as ''Healthy Eating at Pierre's -- a set
calorie-counted menu''.
One glance at the menu and all fears that this would prove a variation
on the lettuce-leaf-and-melon-ball theme melted away. Could all this
total only 1096 calories? But it was all very specific, with not just
calorific values included in the description, but fat, cholesterol, and
fibre readings too.
The starter of mango and orange fruit juice was refreshing, but it was
the soup that really intrigued -- chickpea, olive, and garlic (fat high,
cholesterol and fibre low, 194 calories). The consistency was good --
not too smooth, some unpureed chickpeas to give enough texture, and a
good helping of slivers of black olives. The idea, too, was highly
commendable -- the marriage of the bland pulse with the sharp olives.
Sadly, it did not quite work. The two flavours remained too separate,
the final sharp bite of the olive too much of a surprise.
Next came the fish course -- cod baked with wild mushrooms, tarragon,
and white wine. This, at 221 calories, was only slightly more fattening
than the soup (fat, low; cholesterol, high; fibre, low). There was a
hint of aniseed, but the pervading flavour was tarragon. Served with
strips of oyster mushrooms, the dish was quite fragrant.
The dishes bearing both the fish, and the main course of duck breast
with roasted lentils and kumquat marmalade were piping hot. And then
came the vegetables -- boiled potatoes, broccoli (probably steamed), and
lightly sauted fennel with shallots. Surely this couldn't add up to the
301 calories listed on the menu. The serving of duck (fat, low;
cholesterol, medium; fibre, medium) was generous in the extreme, with
lots of flavour, succulence, enough chewiness, and no skin. As for the
kumquat marmalade -- it was an inspired accompaniment, not too sweet,
and plenty of juice to moisten the other vegetables.
The dessert of fig, sultana, and pecan pie with creme anglaise was a
mere 353 calories (fat, high; cholesterol, low; fibre, medium). The pie
was decorated with a sprig of apple mint and the creme sported elegant
raspberry swirls. It was all very good.
Time, finally, to confess. Our healthy eating plan went awry from the
start. How could we do justice to such an inventive menu without some
wine? The Chateau Graveyres 1993, a Bordeaux Sec, at #7.95 seemed
well-priced. Dry, fruity, with enough bite to match up to a variety of
courses that were long on flavours but quite light, it proved a good
choice. The wine-list of 17 wines, all French, starts from house white
or red at #6.15 but few are more than #10.
We left the table replete, satisfied, but without that bloated feeling
that would normally accompany a five-course dinner. The bill for two
with two set menus at #14.90, a bottle of wine, and a mineral water,
came to #38.75. It had been a well-balanced meal, with plenty of
flavours, well-cooked.
* Other typical themed evenings at Pierre Victoire include
seven-course Gastronomique and Fish Gastronomique menus at #15.90 and
the five-course Vegetable Gastronomique at #12.90.

Catherine Brown and illustrator Fiona Taylor discover the
practicalities behind an innovative dish.
IT WAS a French chef cooking in Arctic Siberia who is reputed to have
created the dish which made sour cream sauce world-famous. Count Paul
Stroganov was his Russian employer. The chef's solution to a constantly
frozen block of beef was to cut off thin pieces of meat and cook them in
the native Russian curdled cream. It was a daring move: too much heat,
too much salt, too much acid, could have turned the curdled cream into a
curdled sauce. Beef Stroganov became a classic.
Prepared in a flash, it had its heyday when waiters in prestigious
dining-rooms flambed to order. It was rich, though, and expensive. When
cooked in the kitchen instead of the dining-room, corners were cut and
cheap cuts of beef substituted for tender steak. The delicate sour cream
sauce was sometimes thickened with flour and diluted with milk.
Hackneyed and debased it became passe.
Yet cuisines worldwide continue to use curdled dairy products in
inventive ways. They provide tangy instant sauces without the hassle of
thickening with flour. In India, and around the Mediterranean, people
are creative with yoghurt, in Central and Eastern Europe with sour
cream, in France with creme fraiche.
The range of available dairy products which have been curdled and
thickened with a bacterial culture, sharpening their flavour by
converting the milk's lactose into lactic acid, has been extended far
beyond our native buttermilk.
While sour cream is made from single cream, with half the butterfat of
double cream, the standard French cream, creme fraiche (fresh cream), is
thicker and more voluptuous. Its butterfat content is higher. Both are
resilient in a hot sauce -- so long as other ingredients are not too
acidic -- since they contain enough butterfat to prevent the sauce
curdling if it is boiled.
Yogurts, however, have a low butterfat content and high acidity, and
are usually added to hot sauces at the end of the cooking time when the
pan has been removed from the heat. The first spoonfuls may curdle but
at least they cool things down and make it less likely that the
remainder will separate.
TURKISH YOGURT SAUCE, described in Nevin Halici's Turkish Cookbook
(1989), is a version of a common Mediterranean type of yogurt sauce
added to stews of meat or vegetables.
Ingredients for 4:
2 tablespoons oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 small aubergines
2 medium courgettes
1 large beefsteak tomato
2 red peppers
1 teaspoon tomato puree
1 teaspoon sugar
half a cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) water
Sauce:
1 lb (500 g) thick or strained natural yogurt
3 cloves garlic, crushed with salt
Method: Heat the oil in a pan and add the onion. Cook until it is soft
and just lightly coloured. Cut the aubergines, courgettes, tomato and
peppers into roughly 1" cubes. Add the vegetables and stir-fry for about
five minutes until they begin to soften. Stir in tomato puree and sugar
then add the water.
Cover and cook for about 5 - 7 minutes. Taste and season.
To make the sauce: crush the garlic with a little salt and mix into
the yoghurt. When the vegetables are cooked add half the sauce gradually
and stir in. Put into serving dish and pour over the remaining sauce.
ARABIC YOGHURT SAUCE involves stabilising the yogurt with an egg.
Serve with vegetable dishes or mixed through beans, chickpeas and green
leafy vegetables.
Ingredients for 4:
1 lb (500 g) thick or strained natural yogurt
1 egg
1 tablespoon oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
3 - 4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 - 2 oz (25 - 50 g) fresh coriander or parsley
Method: Put the yoghurt into a pan and add the beaten egg.
Bring to the boil and stir constantly for about three minutes.
Meantime, heat the oil in a pan and add the onion. Cook until soft
then add the garlic and herbs. Combine the two just before serving.
SHABRIL is a Tibetan meatball curry from Food in Tibetan Life by
Rinjing Dorje (1985).
Ingredients for 4:
1 lb (500 g) minced beef or lamb
1 tablespoon oil
half a teaspoon fenugreek seeds
1 small onion, finely chopped
1" unpeeled fresh ginger, grated
2 cloves crushed garlic
half a teaspoon turmeric
salt to taste
2 teaspoons soy sauce
4 oz (125 g) mushrooms
half a cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) water
1 cup (8 fl oz/250 ml) sour cream (or creme fraiche)
2 tablespoons chopped chives or spring onion
Method: Roll the meat into half inch balls. Heat the oil in a large
frying pan and add the fenugreek seeds. Stir until they turn a dark
brown. Add the onions and stir until lightly browned. Add the meat balls
and fry on all sides. Add the ginger, garlic, turmeric, salt, and soy
sauce. Pour water over and add to the pan. Cook uncovered for about 10
minutes. Add more water if necessary. Taste and season. Remove from the
heat and pour over the sour cream. Do not stir. Sprinkle chives or
spring onion on top. Serve with rice.
LITHUANIAN SOUR CREAM AND BACON SAUCE can be served with boiled or
baked potatoes or poured over green vegetables such as leeks, spinach,
broccoli, etc.
Ingredients for 4 baked potatoes:
1 teaspoon oil
4 oz (125 g) streaky bacon, finely chopped

TWO Scots Guards were sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday after
being found guilty of murdering a teenager shot in Belfast almost
two-and-a-half years ago.
The verdict, which follows a month-long trial last June, will heighten
debate over the Army's rules of engagement in Northern Ireland.
Guardsmen James Fisher, 28, from Ayrshire, and Mark Wright, 21, from
Arbroath, admitted shooting father-of-two Peter McBride, 18, on
September 4, 1992, but denied his murder.
However, at Belfast Crown Court, Lord Justice Kelly found them guilty
of murder and imposed a mandatory life sentence.
He appeared to be unhappy with the required sentence and said he had
delayed his decision in the case until the House of Lords had
determined, in the recent Private Lee Clegg appeal, whether a verdict of
manslaughter was open in circumstances where a soldier had used
unreasonable force in self-defence or in defence of another.
Fisher claimed he opened fire because he believed Mr McBride was
leading his patrol into a trap and would throw a coffee-jar bomb at
them.
Wright said he had opened fire because he believed Mr McBride had
himself fired.
The judge dismissed their claims and said Fisher had been
''untruthful'' in a number of matters and that his evidence had lacked
credibility, while Wright's evidence that he had fired in self-defence
was ''even more frail''.
He said that if Parliament substituted a single crime of culpable
homicide (as Scots law has) for the present counts of manslaughter and
murder and abolished the mandatory life sentence, it could be left to
judges ''to impose more condign punishments, ranging from non-custodial
to imprisonment for indeterminable length''.
The Law Society last night echoed Lord Justice Kelly's call for
changes in the law for murder and said judges should be given discretion
in sentencing for cases of murder.
Lord Justice Kelly contrasted the kind of case in which Clegg was
involved -- opening fire on a speeding car in the darkness of night with
only a split second to decide whether one was under threat -- and
opening fire in this case.
The court had been told that Mr McBride was shot twice in the back as
he ran along Upper Meadow Street in the republican New Lodge area of
north Belfast away from a four-man Army patrol, which included Fisher
and Wright. Mr McBride had been stopped, questioned, and searched by the
patrol leader, when he suddenly took to his heels and ran off down the
road.
The judge rejected the two soldiers' claims that they thought he was
carrying a gun or a bomb, because it would clearly have been found when
he was stopped.
''The image of the case is of a cheeky young man, after an impudent
confrontation, running away as hard as he possibly could.
''That picture did not suggest a young man wandering around with a
bomb in his bag being stopped for a few minutes and then running off
with it, nor a plan to lead a patrol into a trap.''
An Army spokesman said soldiers on the streets of Northern Ireland
worked in difficult and dangerous circumstances but had to operate
within the law at the end of the day.
''If we were not to operate within the bounds of the law, we would be
as bad as the terrorists who we are protecting the public against.''
The spokesman added that the rules of engagement in Northern Ireland
were contained in the Yellow Card document, which gave soldiers guidance
on when they could or could not open fire.
''All soldiers deployed in Northern Ireland know the Yellow Card
backwards, and are tested on its contents, but it is only guidance and
holds no legal standing at all.''
A Tory MP last night called for such cases to be heard by military
courts-martial and not the civil courts. Mr Phil Gallie, MP for Ayr,
said: ''I am speaking out for the bulk of my constituents in the way
that we send our troops out there.
''Many of them are young lads and we are sending them to what is
basically a war zone -- in some ways worse than a war zone because they
do not know who is their friend and who is their foe. All the time they
are living on a knife-edge.
''And under these circumstances, perhaps there are situations where
judgments are not made as precisely as we would like them.
''It is easy to look back in retrospect from the comfort of an
armchair but soldiers have a responsibility to protect not only the
public but themselves.
''Under these circumstances, particularly in the UK with home-based
soldiers, if they have broken military regulations or discipline when
they are serving I think we should use military courts.
''That way you would get a military judgment, by people who know the
situation.''
Mr Gallie said his call for court-martial justice would apply only in
cases where soldiers were on duty and on active service.

The Long Black Veil, The Chieftains (RCA)
* Celebrity cameos have become the norm on Chieftains' albums, with
mixed results -- as is the case here. Van Morrison, Marianne Faithfull,
and Tom Jones will be welcome back any time, and the Chieftains/Stones
finale -- the Rocky Road to Satisfaction, indeed -- exudes fittingly
cheerful bonhomie. But with Mark Knopfler giving it his worst Bob Dylan,
Sting making an Erse of Mo Ghile Mear, and Sinead O'Connor in
couldna-carry-a-tune-in-a-bucket form, diehards may pine, with some
justification, for the unsullied Chieftains of old.
A Whistle on the Wind, Joannie Madden (Green Linnet)
* A garrulous, irrepressible frontperson for Cherish the Ladies,
recent popular New York visitors to Celtic Connections, Joannie remains
mostly straight-faced (though never strait-laced) on this showcase for
her considerable tin-whistle and flute talents. The title track is
almost classical in its discipline and poise. But, as always, with
musicians such as bodhran master Ringo McDonagh in tow, toes will tap
and eyes will twinkle.
Who Do You Think I Am, Sinead Lohan (Dara)
* Introduced on the recent A Woman's Heart 2 album and tour, Sinead
Lohan is a young singer/songwriter from Cork being groomed to follow in
Mary Black's footsteps. Black's musical director Declan Sinnott
produced, arranged and played all the instruments on these 12 original
songs which, if overplaying the poor naive wee me card somewhat, still
have a certain melodic charm.

The Herald's team of reviewers present an informed guide to listening
and reading pleasure.
Fairest Isle, edited by David Fraser (BBC Radio Three publication)
* IT can hardly have escaped the notice of music-lovers that BBC Radio
Three is undertaking, in 1995, a vast celebration of British music
throughout the isles and the ages. As well as focusing on the
tercentenary of the death of Henry Purcell, the 90th birthday of Sir
Michael Tippett, and other anniversaries, the survey will range across
the richness and diversity of British music. This will include
substantial features on the music of the BBC's regional areas -- a broad
picture of contemporary Scottish music was the subject of the first
major regional broadcasts a few weeks back.
Now, at high speed, to complement the Fairest Isle year, the BBC in
association with Hyperion Records has produced a paperback book and
double CD with examples of British music from anonymous
thirteenth-century compositions, through the early great composers --
Dunstable, Byrd, Tallis, and Purcell -- to Britten, Tippett and Tavener.
The book is beautiful. A series of 16 essays, written by composers,
musicologists, historians, and performers, gives a broad and colourful
picture of the development of British musical culture through the
centuries, from the beginnings to today's big names, including Nyman,
MacMillan, and Turnage. Sumptuously illustrated, the book will grace any
music-lover's library.
As will the CDs, each at nearly 80 minutes' playing time, and with a
total of 38 tracks. There are some peculiarities of repertoire
(omissions, notably certain important figures not represented). That is
accounted for by the fact that they record for labels other than
Hyperion. Simple as that. So the discs are not ideally comprehensive in
their survey.
None the less, book and CDs are terrific bargains. Available
separately (the book at #6.99, the double CD at #4.99) or together (#10
for both). Hours of home entertainment guaranteed.
Write to Fairest Isle Book and/or CD offer, JEM House, Little Mead,
Cranleigh, Surrey GU6 8ND, or telephone orders to 0483 2688888.
Scottish Chamber Orchestra Yearbook 1995
* Altogether a more modest publication, at #3 (available at SCO
concerts or from the SCO at 4 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh EH7 5AB). But
still a celebration, as the SCO, dubbed ''Britain's first million-pound
chamber orchestra'' last week by the Scottish Arts Council, is 21 this
year. The yearbook contains a pictorial scrapbook of the orchestra's
activities over the period, an essay by the SCO's first development
officer, Kathryn McDowell (now with the Arts Council of England), who
put in place the development programme that has become a crucial part of
the orchestra's remit, full concert diaries and discography, lists of
tours and commissions. Also contains a long essay on the background and
development of the Maxwell Davies Strathclyde Concerto project, written
by some geek called Tumelty. Deathless stuff.

Overtime, Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass (Concord)
* TWENTY-one-piece brass band who in their better, more subdued
moments sound like they've been influenced by the Gil Evans-Miles Davis
Birth of the Cool school, and at their worst, just sound like a high
school big band. Into the former bracket goes the Boss Brass version of
Ray Noble's The Touch of Your Lips -- although it does come dangerously
close to elevator music. For the most part this is pretty bland, the
only possible exceptions being the near-funky Clark Terry Hawg Jawz and
the Batmanly title track. Only if you have fond memories of Muzak.
The Bridge, Sonny Rollins (RCA Victor Jazz Classics)
* DESERVED reissue of the first album of Rollins's 1962 comeback (he
''retired'' in 1959). It features the tenor saxophonist in the company
of an impressive rhythm section, which includes Jim Hall on guitar. The
musical rapport between Rollins and Hall is evident throughout --
particularly on the sumptuous ballads Where Are You and God Bless the
Child and the more avant-garde title track. Best of all is Without a
Song, with its driving bass line, and groovy melody. Equally groovy is
the fold-out CD sleeve with its reproduction of the original sixties
sleeve and notes.

World of Morrissey, Morrissey (Parlophone)
* Mid-priced 14-track connoisseurs' memento of Mr M's career from 1991
to the present date. Four singles, including the current one, Boxers;
three live tracks from the Beethoven Was Deaf album; four B-sides, and
three choice cuts from his two most recent studio albums. Preoccupied
miserabilism for grown-ups who like to daydream in front of the mirror.
Singles, the Smiths (Warner Brothers)
* Eighteen slices of tart, alienated, pure-pop genius from Mr M's
first band. Again. If you didn't buy them the first time round, on Rough
Trade, or the last time, last year on two Warners' Best Ofs, then you
are entirely without ears, soul, social worth, and hope.
To Be Loved, Berry Gordy (Headline, #17.99)
* As he indicates in his rough-hewn autobiography's sub-title, Berry
Gordy gave us ''the music, the magic, the memories of Motown''. Now,
with little rancour and no syrupy self-delusion, he addresses the many
myths and misconceptions which he feels have obscured his handling of
the label during its phenomenal 36-year life-span. Principally, Gordy
has long been accused of stifling Motown performers' desires for control
of their own artistic destinies. How does Gordy feel he faced up to the
growing demands of such headstrong talents as Marvin Gaye and Stevie
Wonder? ''With relief, pride, resentment and indigestion.'' A warm,
understated, yet acutely revealing book.
King, Belly (4AD)
* Powerful, air-brushed, all-American, made-for-MTV consensus-rock
with an artful eye on indie credibility. A less-melodic Fleetwood Mac
for Generation X. In other words, not anywhere near as good as it
imagines itself to be.
Undone -- The Sweater Song, Weezer (Geffen)
* A single which fails to demonstrate that the hotly-tipped Weezer are
R.E.M's heirs. Nevertheless, you are strongly advised to check out
Weezer's forthcoming self-titled debut LP and their Glasgow gig at King
Tut's on February 24.
Mobile Safari, the Pastels (Domino)
* Shrugging and shuffling their feet in a defensive, off-hand manner,
oor verra ain Pastels slope round the corner with a new album. Yet yon
Pastels need not slope and shrug in a take-us-or-leave-us style, for
this album is easily their best yet, packed with crunchin' guitars,
affectin' vocals, winsome melodies, and songs of singularly fey allure.
In fact, if any Scottish band tops this in 1995, you can come round and
eat my hat.

AND lo, the city of Glasgow hath semi-officially appointed itself a
new ambassadress. And verily, she is a pure godjus big blonde luv-burd.
Or at least that's what she insists she is, while to the rest of us she
shalt also be known as Lynn Ferguson, the no-nonsense swearie-word
chuckle-chucker who, years ago when she was working as a bar-maid in a
trendsome West End drinking-establishment, picked me up once by the ear
and threw me down the stairs at closing-time.
So. Glasgow ambassadress? You? How?
''Not just Glasgow, ya speccy wee article. I see myself as an
ambassadress for the whole of Scotland, actually. Spreading good old
tartan cheeriness wherever I go.''
Aye. OK. But with the blessing of Glasgow's city fathers? What's the
story?
Simple. The producers of BBC's Rhodes Around Britain were looking for
some respectable, clued-up citizen to act as a Glasgow guide for
celebrity chef Gary Rhodes. They approached Glasgow's Department of
Performing Arts, who gave Lynn Ferguson the nod as a fine, upstanding
Glaswegian, having been michtily impressed with her demeanour as MC at
their recent Hogmanay bash in George Square.
Indeed, they were so happy with her that they handed out a civic
imprimatur despite the fact that Lynn currently lives in London and was
born in Cumbernauld . . .
''So? I spent my youth in Glasgow, and I'm back a lot, having just
spent three months in panto at the Tron, and I do Mixmag for BBC
Scotland in the school holidays. And I only left under the iron heel of
enforced economic-migrancy anyway. And I would have liked to have taken
Gary to Cumbernauld, but the programme's called Rhodes Around Glasgow,
so that scuppered that.''
So when in Glasgow, where did you roam with Rhodes?
''We went to the Tunnel. I must admit that I felt like a pensioner
there. The place was full of children wearing hardly any clothes, and I
kept feeling impelled to put woolly vests on them all. Gary and I were
filmed waltzing sedately in the middle of a semi-naked melee of
adolescents desperate to be on the telly.
''After that, we went to eat and drink in Maxaluna. We went to a kilt
shop and I had to hand my purse to a production assistant so that I
couldn't spend all my money on furry Loch Ness monsters that played
Scotland The Brave when you pressed them. And we went to the Armani shop
where Gary bought a suit.
''One place we didn't get to was Spectrum Catering, run by my two
pals, Steven and Mark Ward, who deliver fabulous made-to-measure
sandwiches round Glasgow's offices -- and do you know that one Monday
night in London Madonna came over all swanky and tried to book the whole
of the Greenhouse, the restaurant in which Gary is head chef, and the
Greenhouse turned her away, crying: 'Sorry, we've got diners in already
. . . ' ''
What? We seem to have digressed a little from Spectrum Catering in
Glasgow . . .
''No, we haven't! Madonna should have had Spectrum's number and they
would have delivered her some lovely sandwiches!''
Aye. Right. Ad-break over. Let's get back to the plot. You first came
to public prominence nigh on 10 years ago, just after you'd graduated
from the RSAMD, as one half of the Alexander Sisters along with Carolyn
Bonnyman. Will the Alexanders ever set our eightsomes reeling anew or
give our willows another right good stripping?
''It's a wee bitty unlikely. I think Morag and Alma have actually
given up performing and gone into a seaside home in Largs for retired
Variety turns. Sitting in the conservatory wrapped up in blankets,
admiring the setting sun alongside Graeme Souness and Margaret
Thatcher.''
More to the point, Carolyn has only just finished a long acting stint
in Liz Lochhead's Quelques Fleurs, which wound its way from the
Edinburgh Festival to London's Old Red Lion. Meanwhile, for most of the
past 18 months, Lynn has been the resident compere at another of
London's more interesting venues, the Red Rose Comedy Club.
''After having had three months away in Glasgow in Babes In The Wood,
it's a bit nervy having to get back into the swing of stand-up and
writing fresh material. I've always found writing material a drag, but
at least I've got something to aim at now as I'll be doing my own
full-length fringe show at the Gilded Balloon.
''And who knows what else might develop? Just a couple of weeks ago we
had a scout over from America from the David Letterman Show. He spent
the weekend watching all of us to see who might work on prime-time US
TV. He also seemed to be surrounded by giggling girlies flicking their
hair and offering him -- if he'd only look at their proposal for a TV
series -- a keek up their nighties. Not my style.''
Jings, no. And do you have long-term proposals for a
nightie-shreddingly-powerful career of your own?
''No. Stand-up happened without me planning it. I mosey along. I go to
the shops. I jabber on a stage. I mean, I'm far too snarly and
aggressive in everyday social situations without introducing it into my
working-life. Really, I'm just not prepared to be overtly hungry and
ambitious.''
You had much fun tootling round the four stages in George Square at
Hogmanay, yes?
''I think I had more fun beforehand, messing about with daft Gerard
Kelly. It was hard work, persuading grumpy men to pretend to smile by
showing me their teeth, and being touched up by growling neds with bad
moustaches . . . one of them kept shouting: 'Haw, ur you a burd or a
bloke?'
''I tried to ignore him, but in the end I turned and said, using some
very direct terminology: 'Are you a male private part or a female
private part?' And do you know what he had the cheek to tell me then?
'That's out of order.' Imagine.''
Indeed. Lynn Ferguson shocks the unshockable . . .  not like you at
all. And would you like to close by favouring us with your official
ambassadress's pronouncement on Glasgow?
''Aye. Er. Eh . . . Go to Glasgow: you'll have a laugh. And it's got a
lot posher since I left. Or it's got a lot posher because I left.''
And what difference will being Glasgow's ambassadress make to your
life?
''I hope that they give me the key to all of Glasgow's pubs, as well
as the safe in the City Chambers, so that I can wander round steaming
drunk in lots of new dresses.''
Lynn Ferguson, we luv youse. A burd, a topper; amen.
* Lynn Ferguson will return to Glasgow, trailing clouds of glory when
she performs at the Tron, on Sunday, February 26, supported by Jill
Peacock. Additionally, she will appear in Paisley (Arts Centre), Glasgow
(Royal Concert Hall), Aberdeen (Lemon Tree), Dundee (Repertory Theatre),
and Edinburgh on the Gilded Balloon Comedy circuit on March 1-5. Rhodes
Around Britain is due to appear on TV screens in June.

Caro Fraser has a famous writer as a father, but that was never going
to stop her from making her own way in the literary world, discovers
Lesley Duncan.
CARO Fraser has been compared to John Mortimer and Mary Wesley. No-one
so far seems to have made comparisons -- invidious or favourable -- with
her author father, George MacDonald Fraser. All the same, in Leo Davies,
barrister, sensualist, and Porsche-driver, she may have created an
anti-hero to rival her parent's odiously irresistible Flashman.
With her mop of dark hair and brilliant smile, Caro Fraser looks much
too girlish to be the mother of four young children, let alone a
barrister specialising in marine law, and a successful novelist with
three books already published. Love, lust, and the law are her themes. A
potent combination for escapist reading of the more elevated sort.
There is nothing even residually Scottish about her voice. You could
imagine her being a formidable disputant in the court clashes she evokes
so well in her books. In conversation she displays a bubbling wit, a
tendency to say ''Wow'', and a down-to-earth attitude towards herself
and her achievements. Now only in her early forties, she is, one senses,
still developing, exploring her possibilities. The North British
inheritance is there in the background. She admits to being a
''sentimental Presbyterian'' and has recourse to Oor Wullie annuals
(Christmas presents that are ''a sort of family joke'') when she's
''going through a sticky patch''.
Her roots are Glaswegian. Though born in Carlisle, she lived in
Glasgow from the age of six months to 15, attending the old High School
for Girls in Garnethill -- in those days ''quite a tough and savage
environment''.
Writing is something Caro Fraser has always done but came to late as a
career. She had two children and a husband (Essex man and solicitor)
earning enough for a nannie to be employed before she could embark on
it. ''Everything else had been a sort of apprenticeship,'' she says.
Everything else included, after schooling in the Isle of Man, a course
aimed at producing advertising copy writers. She had thought it would
make the creative process easier but ''after a day writing about frozen
chickens the last thing you want to do is write the great novel''. She
also wanted a career she could still pursue at 50. So the well paid Ms
Fraser went back to being a student.
Law seemed an attractive discipline. A three-year degree course at
King's College, London, was followed by a year at Bar School in Chancery
Lane, then pupillage in the Temple. Those legal years form the central
inspiration for her novels.
The first, The Pupil, has Anthony as its hero. He's clever, handsome,
but without money or the social connections that seem de rigueur for a
career at the bar. The book charts his efforts to establish himself at 5
Caper Court in competition with the dim-witted nephew of the head of
chambers.
The capers at Caper Court are provided not just by Anthony but a cast
of assorted barristers. Anthony's hippie father intrudes amusingly. And
then there is love. Anthony is dazzled by social butterfly Julia. He is
also drawn to fellow-barrister Leo Davies, a silver-haired hedonist of
charm and ambiguous sexuality. The potential relationship between the
two men is described with aching delicacy.
Resolutions are avoided -- ''I like ambivalence,'' says Fraser -- thus
allowing the sequel, Judicial Whispers. This was published in hardback
last month after a second novel of unrelated plot, The Trustees. And
now, with her third book, Caro Fraser has discovered for herself that
old truism that fictional characters develop a life and impetus of their
own.
Enter Leo -- ''this creature I created in the first book'' -- who
ousts Anthony as the main character in Judicial Whispers. He also takes
over Anthony's new girlfriend to divert attention from his sexually
unsalubrious past in his quest to become a QC. He remains alarmingly
endearing in spite of this, his slightly sagging jawline, and his desire
for a good night's sleep at climactic moments.
Caro Fraser has had to make one gesture towards political correctness
at the behest of her woman editor. Leo is made (rather halfheartedly) to
mention having regular HIV tests. ''If I had my way,'' she sighs,
''there would be no condoms, no Aids . . . I like to have the thing in
the realms of romance rather than sexuality.''
Had her writing, I wondered, been helped or inhibited by her having
Flashman's creator as a father? ''Neither really,'' she replies. I
always knew you had to write something decent to get into print and that
it was a hard slog.'' She still thinks of her father as ''the real
writer. He works hard and I just feel I play around . . . It's a
Presbyterian thing. The harder you work, the more worthy it is!''
She does, needless to say, work very hard. The child-free hours of
10am to 3pm are laid aside for creative endeavours in her suburban home
in south-east London. ''That's the way I get my stint done. I can
revisit it around teatime and get depressed about 5 o'clock when they're
all having tea and watching Power Rangers!''
A producer/writer has bought the rights to The Pupil and Judicial
Whispers  to make a short TV series (''whether they ever will or not is
another story''). Caro Fraser recalls him saying of Leo, ''I want to be
this man, so selfish and dashing and intellectually brilliant!'' She
thought: ''It is a bit like Flashman -- only different entirely.''
She turns to me. ''But anti-heroes are good stuff, aren't they?'' Well
yes, on this showing they certainly are.
* Judicial Whispers is published by Orion at #14.99, hardback.
Paperback versions of The Pupil and The Trustees are published by
Phoenix at #5.99 each.

EXCLUSIVE
IN a surprise twist to the fight to save Scotland's threatened rail
services, the editors of Hansard have admitted missing out key words
uttered by Sir Hector Monro before the Scottish Grand Committee.
The Minister, in response to a challenge on whether there would be
formal consultation before the Motorail and Fort William sleeper
services were withdrawn, said: ''Yes, formal''.
Yet when the verbatim Hansard account of the exchange between the
Minister and MP Mr Jim Wallace came out, the response had been omitted.
Its omission was greeted with anger by Opposition MPs who had attended
the committee. Immediately afterwards, they became embroiled in a row
with Scottish Office officials over what the Minister had actually said.
Following the publication of the Hansard report, Labour trade and
industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, contacted the duty editor of
Hansard and asked for tapes of the meeting to be replayed.
As a result, yesterday's Hansard contains a rare ''corrigendum'' which
recognises that the Minister spoke the words ''Yes, formal'' in response
to the question.
However, the Scottish Office said last night that the Minister's reply
had been misunderstood, and that there would be no consultation on these
services.
The question of consultation and its timing is seen as vital to the
battle to protect the Motorail and Fort William sleepers which are
threatened with closure in May.
Yesterday Mr Wilson said that Scottish officials were trying to
backtrack on the promises given by Sir Hector, and deny that these
amounted to a formal consultation. ''It was absolutely vital that Sir
Hector's words should be in the written record of proceedings.''
Sir Hector Monro was unavailable for comment when contacted at home
last night. However, a spokeswoman for the Scottish Office said
consultation on the Motorail and sleeper services was not on the cards.
Mr Wallace could not be contacted for comment last night.

Edith Wharton. THE BUCCANEERS (Fourth Estate, #4.99).
* OF all the unlikely popular comebacks in the history of Eng Lit,
Edith Wharton's is one of the most unlikely as well as the most welcome.
Working from a narrow palette of upper-class Anglo-American life, and in
a stiff and stylised prose often reminiscent of Henry James with
arthritis, she still managed to produce several sharp and shiny little
masterpieces of bourgeois social comedy that have aged remarkably well.
The Buccaneers, unfinished at Wharton's death in 1937 but completed and
edited here by Marion Mainwaring, covers the same sort of social and
personal ground as usual -- English breeding and American money, scandal
and divorce, pride and prejudice -- but in a gentler, less acid style
than many of her earlier novels. See the TV adaptation, then read the
real thing.
Scott Bradfield. WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA (Picador, #5.99).
* ''CALIFORNIA is America squared,'' says the pleasantly senile
epistolatory narrator of this very funny novel. ''It's the place you go
to find more America than you ever thought possible.'' Going quietly
ditsy as she pens her life story for a family she barely knew, Emma
O'Hallohan has already shot her irritating husband Marvin in the back of
the head and intends to do something similar to the clan biography,
revealing who came out of the closet and what skeletons remained within.
The Raymond Carver of the crystal-healing set, Bradfield juggles a
beautifully sustained meditation on age and self-discovery with some
snarling satire on the complacencies of middle America.
Rosa Ainely (ed.) DEATH OF A MOTHER: Daughters' Stories (Pandora,
#7.99).
* READ them and weep, as the poker players say. There is weeping
aplenty in these 30-odd accounts of the deaths of the writers' mothers;
there is also love, despair, hatred, and anger. Some provoke the tears
of a shared grief; others, like New Grey Coat by Leland Bardwell, are
like a bucket of icy water in the face. Jill Posener's memoir, Charmian,
is an elegant elegy for a mother misunderstood by her daughter until
after her death, and Signing On and Signing Off, a poem by Frances
Kenton, has the last line ''Invisible, my mother comes with me out of
the hospital''. The mothers of these women remain with and within them.
Robert James Waller. SLOW WALTZ IN CEDAR BEND (Mandarin, #4.99).
* SAY what you like about the pastel-hued, elegantly greying novels of
Bridges of Madison County author Robert James Waller -- emotional
pornography, wish-fulfilment for the over-40s -- but there's no denying
the man can spin a yarn that ensnares you. In Slow Waltz the main mover
is Michael Tillman, professor of economics, an urban Marlboro man with a
flip putdown forever on his lips and an ache in his heart for Jellie
Braden, the grey-eyed wife of a colleague with a secret past. When the
past comes a-calling, Tillman sets off in pursuit to make his final stab
at eternal love before he gives up and buys shares in Grecian 2000.
Cliched and manipulative, Slow Waltz is still a superior slice of gently
rocking shlock.

Charles Kingsley. THE WATER BABIES (Oxford, #4.99).
* LONG neglected as little more than a sub-aqua Peter Pan, The Water
Babies is revealed in this extensively annotated new edition as one of
the most bizarre products of the Victorian imagination. The ostensible
narrative is known to most people: the adventures of Tom, the child
chimney-sweep, who undertakes his marine meanderings to cleanse himself
of the moral and physical soot of his profession. Beneath the surface,
however, bubbles a subtext oxygenated by the issues of the day,
particularly Kingsley's Christian Socialism, nascent psychology, and a
running critique of child labour. The Water Babies is worth rediscovery
for its accessible lyricism and for the way it baffles, enchants, and
rarely comes up for air.
Simone De Beauvoir (ed.) WITNESS TO MY LIFE: The Letters of Jean-Paul
Sartre to Simone De Beauvoir 1926-1939 (Penguin, #8.99).
* THE turbulent but almost lifelong affair between Sartre and de
Beauvoir is one of the most affecting to read about of any literary
romance since the unconsummated one between Jonathan Swift and Stella:
it's the contrast between the steely stoicism of Sartre's philosophy of
existentialism and the boyish, worried, affectionate, almost puppyish
expression of his love that makes these letters so lovable themselves.
Love apart, they also cast a fascinating light on the development of
existentialism and on French literary and political life of the period,
and one comes away liking M Sartre more for having peeked over his
lover's shoulder.
THE AUTOMATIC MUSE: Surrealist Novels by Robert Desnos, Georges
Limbour, Michel Leiris, and Benjamin Peret (Atlas, #7.99).
* UNLIKE some experimental literature, the Surrealists are not
difficult to read. Apart from the odd weird phrase -- ''Moonless honey,
what have you done with my foot?'' -- the sentences are perfectly
intelligible, but by the end the reader is left wondering what it's all
about. One response is to ask what life is all about; another answer is
''Nothing''; yet another is ''The malevolent shriek of a lemon.''
Despite such problems, there is lyricism, bold imagery, and a great deal
of absurd comedy in these short pieces. With its dreams, wordplay, and
imaginative daring, the collection is more enjoyable than you would at
first expect. You want plots? Try the phone book . . .
Ambrose Bierce. CIVIL WAR STORIES (Dover, 95p).
* AMBROSE BIERCE was both man of action and man of letters. As a
journalist his barbs earned him the nickname ''Bitter Bierce'', but it
is his experiences as a soldier during the American Civil War that
inform the stories collected here. In tales such as What I Saw of
Shiloh, the soldier is too often leading the writer, with endless
military details leaving the reader dazed and confused. Only when
dealing with the human scale of things, as in A Horseman in the Sky,
where a young sentry finds himself the cause of his father's death, does
Bierce show glimmers of recognising the human drama in war. The Devil's
Dictionary would be a better introduction for newcomers.
John Edgar Wideman. PHILADELPHIA FIRE (Picador, #5.99).
* CHAOS, despair, futility -- these are the flames that illuminate
America's decline into what Saul Bellow termed ''the moronic inferno''
-- and nowhere is the heat more intense than black urban America, where
an underclass left to rot threatens to unravel the fabric of the society
that has chosen to abandon it. It's a big theme that has proved
difficult to tackle convincingly, and Wideman's Philadelphia Fire is
another honourable failure. Ostensibly an attempt to chronicle the
reasons behind the razing to the ground of a black commune, Philadelphia
Fire is really an attempt to explain the razing to the ground of the
hopes of an entire generation of African-Americans; but its disjointed
and confusing narrative will leave most readers cold.

Every day police divers dredge the murky depths in search of evidence,
weapons and even bodies. And with each dive, as George Hume discovers,
they put themselves on the line.
FIVE days a week John McConnell kisses his wife and three children
before setting off for his office in Springburn: an eight-to-four
commitment, weekends off, a job like so many others -- apart, that is,
from the dead bodies, blown safes, and dangerously submerged trees. To
make no mention of the threat of death from Weil's disease, often
transmitted to humans by rats, and characterised by jaundice, meningitis
and kidney failure.
For John, on duty, is Sergeant McConnell of the Strathclyde Police
Underwater Search Unit and his working day is spent immersed in a task
few of the rest of us would want, or be able to tackle. Almost needless
to say John McConnell and his 12 colleagues, up to their necks in it for
most of their working lives, are happy divers.
Every day of the year, somewhere in Strathclyde, they dive in support
of their colleagues in the uniformed branch of the CID in everything
from the Gulf Stream waters of the Ayrshire coast to the muddy eddies of
the Clyde, slurry tanks and marshlands not excluded.
''About one-third of all our jobs are outside Greater Glasgow and
there is an operational dive every day,'' says Sergeant McConnell, who
explains that many dives are aimed at eliminating rather than finding.
''We are looking for missing persons or recovering bodies, searching
for stolen property, identifying stolen vehicles that have been dumped
in rivers and ponds, carrying out security searches of water which VIPs
will be passing or staying close by . . . basically looking for things
that are out of place, hunting for murder weapons; all in a day's
work,'' says the policeman who started his working life behind a bank
counter before discovering that the ebb and flow of interest rates could
never be the abiding passion of his life.
When Sergeant McConnell, 12 constables, and the team leader, Inspector
Fred Hall, go about their business they do it mob-handed, with five men
the minimum needed to get one of their number beneath the surface. The
diver going into the water has a diver's attendant to help with his
gear, and a standby safety diver -- fully kitted and ready to go to his
colleague's aid on the instant -- is also served by an attendant, while
the fifth man is in charge as dive supervisor. He will be the only one
on the quayside or riverbank not dressed in thermal underwear and a dry
suit.
Says Sergeant McConnell: ''Five is the legal requirement and we are
very safety-conscious. Having enough people is essential -- we need the
numbers to run safely and effectively.''
So what is it like slipping beneath the surface of the Clyde, watched
by a crowd of curious passers-by that can be formed by the sight of a
man in a frog-suit in the centre of Glasgow, charged with carrying out
an efficient fingertip search of every inch of the riverbed in the area
where it is thought there may be stolen silver, a dagger, a gun, or a
dead body?
''Normally we have no more than six inches of visibility in the Clyde,
so it is all done by touch. We mark off the search area with weighted
rope and work outwards for about 35 yards before pivoting on a new area
and repeating the process. The biggest danger we face is becoming
trapped or entangled in wire or, say, the branches of a tree. There is a
voice line between the diver and the surface and contact is kept up all
the time. The men on the surface can clearly hear the breathing of the
diver and can monitor his breathing rate. If he has a problem he can't
hide it and we are able to go to his help immediately.''
The air bottles worn by the unit's divers contain 300 bars -- one bar
being consumed with every breath at surface level, six times that at 50
metres. The aim is to surface with a safety margin of around one-third
the contents of the bottle still in hand. Sergeant McConnell stresses:
''The most dangerous dives are the most innocuous.''
''My worst experience was getting caught up in submerged branches that
had lodged against one of the piers of the King George V Bridge here in
Glasgow,'' says Sergeant McConnell.
''They had gone into a hole in the pier and I went in too to search.
But when I turned round to come out the branches were against me. In a
situation like that the very last thing you want your colleagues to do
is to pull you out -- we all have a rope attached -- because that could
sometimes just lead to being more firmly trapped. I got out after two
minutes but it was a frightening experience . . . not too funny when
your air supply is being used up and you don't know when you will get to
the surface.''
Every member of the Strathclyde Police Underwater Search Unit is
trained to the level of Grade Three Diver -- able to use bottled air or
a surface supply, competent to dive to a depth of 50 feet, to use a wide
range of equipment, subject to an annual medical, and instructed up to
and beyond the requirements of the Health and Safety Executive. So
skilled are Strathclyde Police's 13 divers -- five of them full-time,
the remainder on call -- that fully half of police divers serving
throughout Britain, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands have
learned their skills at the Strathclyde Police National Dive School, one
of just two such establishments in the country. The other is in
Northumberland.
It takes eight weeks of training to reach basic standard and outside
police forces are happy to pay the #360 a week demanded to learn the
Strathclyde way. The course, based at the Springburn police office, is
rigorous. Says Sergeant McConnell: ''There is no use in anyone taking
the training unless they are keen and fit to dive. Those who do not like
the dark or are claustrophobic are non-starters. The scheme is open only
to experienced serving police officers and some who think they would
like to be divers quickly find it is not for them. There is a huge
difference between ordinary scuba diving and police work. Most divers in
the Strathclyde Police team were keen amateur divers in their own right
before joining but a number were not. In any case it makes no
difference. The training is such that those who have never dived before
are just as easily brought up to standard.''
Every member of the Strathclyde team is a volunteer -- able on their
own say-so alone to quit diving and return to their ordinary duties.
Sergeant McConnell, 34 years of age and 13 years in the police, believes
this freedom is essential if enthusiasm is to be maintained and the best
men found for the job. ''As a result of service in the Underwater Unit
being voluntary standard, motivation and enthusiasm are high.''
The downside of the work is frankly admitted, as is the black humour
employed to provide the release from situations that even the most
experienced find disgusting and distressing.
''Bodies can be in a terrible state -- decomposed, soft, and difficult
to handle. If there is a crowd watching we always try to put the corpse
in a body bag beneath the surface so that it is not seen. They can be
very badly battered by being carried along the bottom of the river --
travelling sometimes for many miles. One body recently was carried by
the current from the centre of Glasgow right out to Prestwick on the
Ayrshire coast,'' said Sergeant McConnell.
''The most tragic aspect of the job is recovering the bodies of
youngsters -- little boys who have been playing by the water's edge and
gone in. Sometimes their relatives are present when we find the body. We
try to be professional but that is very stressful. I have never heard of
any police diver who has a real problem with this but if there were we
would certainly do something about it. As things are, black humour is
our release.''
Asked how many bodies a year are fished from the Clyde, Sergeant
McConnell answers simply: ''Dozens''. Experience has taught him that
bodies that have gone to the bottom of the river, and most apparently
do, are almost certain to rise to the surface 21 days after the victim
is drowned.
Safes tipped into the Clyde by office-breakers, blown open or
abandoned, present a very real problem to the underwater team. ''Very
heavy, smooth on the outside with no projections to get a grip of . . .
awkward,'' says Sergeant McConnell with evident recollection of safes he
would rather not have encountered.
When a Strathclyde Police diver takes the plunge he is dressed in
#1500 of specialist clothing -- breathing apparatus, torch and knife
with a dry suit and thermal underwear to keep out some of the chill. An
enormous range of equipment is on call, including two inflatable boats,
much of it carried in a special articulated lorry used by the team and
fitted with a few home comforts, including a shower.
But the shower is not there just to wash off the mud, stench, and ooze
that may have stuck to a diver's face. Disease is the hidden hazard of
diving in the Clyde -- a river whose banks are host to a very large
population of rats.
''Weil's disease is to be avoided, together with everything else you
can get from diving in polluted water. We wear gloves, of course, when
doing a fingertip search on the riverbed, but inevitably there are cut
fingers, ear infections, and sprained ankles from scrambling over
beaches and rocks. We are all trained first-aiders but when it comes to
the risk of disease it is cleanliness that counts. Everything -- dry
suits, gear, boots, kit like lamps and knives -- is hosed off with clean
fresh water after a dive. We are very meticulous.''
Thanks to a strict routine and that lorry-borne shower so far the
score stands at Police 10, Rats 0. But why, given the risk of disease,
the ever-present danger of being trapped underwater, the frustration of
smooth-skinned safes buried in the river's mud, the stinking, battered
corpses that have to be lifted from river and pond, the tragedy of being
involved with young lives lost, do policemen who could be pounding the
beat choose to do their stint underwater, able to see no further than
six inches before their face?
Variety, it seems, is the answer -- each day is different, even if
most are spent in the water. In the case of Sergeant McConnell, there is
the added advantage that police diving is in no way like banking.
For weekend relaxation he and many of his colleagues go . . . wait for
it, diving. It is not just busmen who take holidays.

A FOUR day old baby girl was abducted last night from a hospital in
Bodelwyddan, near Rhyl, North Wales.
Lydia Owens was taken from Glan Clwyd General Hospital by a woman
carrying a holdall.
The woman, described as between 35 and 40, plump, and wearing a beige
top, had apparently asked the mother to be shown the child.
The kidnapper, who went to the hospital at visiting time, disappeared
with the child.
The mother, Christina Owens, 32, from Llandudno, immediately alerted
staff who called the police.
The hospital is in a rural area surrounded by fields. Early this
morning a search was being carried out in the hospital, its grounds, and
surrounding countryside.
