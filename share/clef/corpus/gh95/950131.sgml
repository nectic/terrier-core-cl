SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang yesterday said there were encouraging
signs pointing to continuing strong growth in the Scottish economy.
Unemployment had continued to fall, by 4500 in the last month alone,
and had remained below the UK average for the last two years, he said.
Scotland's manufacturing output stood at record levels and more of
this output was being exported than ever before.
In addition, Scotland was continuing to attract inward investors from
around the world, he told a meeting of the Eastwood Conservative and
Unionist Business Club in Glasgow.
''More investment flowed into Scotland in the last year than ever
before, and this year is set to surpass even that performance.
He added: ''It is not surprising, then, that optimism continues to
rise in virtually every sector of the economy. But there is no question
of complacency setting in. We must continue to maintain the economic
climate necessary for a sustained recovery.''

<HEADLINE>Rangers striker itching to get back to the job he does best. McCoist almost ready to resume normal service</HEADLINE>

THE SOUND of silence is about to end. McCoist will be back in action
soon, maybe even as a substitute for Rangers in the Tennents Scottish
Cup tie against Hamilton at Firhill tonight, and already he is beginning
to look ahead with some confidence.
McCoist has had a rough time over the past couple of years since he
broke a leg playing for Scotland in Portugal in April, 1993, but he has
never been the type to let setbacks dampen his enthusiasm.
He demonstrated that yesterday when he talked of his desire to play
until he was 36 or 37, neatly destroying any suggestion that the striker
had even contemplated the run of ill-fortune would force him into early
retirement.
There is no doubt, nevertheless, that even his buoyancy has been
threatened by the continuing hurdles placed in the path of his return to
what he does best.
''Of course there were times when I felt a bit down but never to the
point where I thought this could end my career,'' he said. ''Now I just
can't wait to get back playing.''
McCoist has spent the last three weeks under the eye of the new Ibrox
physiotherapist, Grant Downie, who has insisted that for a fortnight
Ally stuck simply to the build-up of the calf muscles. This entailed
running up and down the steps in the main stand all afternoon, 78 of
them in his reckoning.
It might be surprising to the rest of us that anybody would remain
rational, let alone jaunty, after such an ordeal, but McCoist is full of
praise for the regime that has left him feeling confident that he will
not have any worries about recurring leg injuries.
Until he broke his leg, McCoist had been relatively free of injury
but, when he looks upon the past couple of years, he takes heart from
the experience of his front-line partner, Mark Hateley, who also went
through a lengthy period of absence -- close to two years -- when he was
with Monaco.
''Mark says that the time he spent out allowed him to strengthen his
ankles and maybe gave him the chance to extend his career. He certainly
looks good enough now and, as I am a year younger, I would like to think
we both can go on for a while.''
Hateley is certain to be in the side tonight after his five-game
absence through injury and Gordon Durie, who would have missed out if
the tie had been played on Saturday because of chest infection, looks a
likely starter, too.
Trevor Steven, who also suffered from a chest virus, will be in from
the beginning as the Rangers squad begins to take on a more familiar
look.
Hamilton are as ready as they were on Saturday when manager Iain Munro
had given his men the benefit of an overnight hotel stay to foster team
spirit which, he says, is excellent in any case.
Falkirk will bank on the forecast thaw aiding their hopes of meeting
Motherwell at Brockville but the postponement from Saturday left manager
Jim Jefferies with good news and bad. The major blow is that John Clark,
who would have been able to play at the weekend, now has to sit it out
because his two-game suspension begins tonight. Fellow defenders John
Hughes and Greg Shaw are also suspended. But the better news is that Joe
McLaughlin who would not have been fit for Saturday might well be ready
and the same applies to Tommy McQueen.
There will be inspections at two other grounds where ties are due
tonight. Clydebank's Kilbowie Park, where Hearts are the visitors, will
have a 10am inspection, while, at the same time, Cappielow will also be
looked at to see if Morton's replay with Kilmarnock can go ahead.

A CASH crisis in Scottish athletics has jeopardised the sport's whole
annual programme, including its biggest international fixture.
The track and field commission of the Scottish Athletics Federation
has set a deadline of a week tomorrow to find a sponsor for the match
they are due to host against Turkey, Israel, Wales, and Northern Ireland
in July.
Should they fail, embarrassment will be substantial. Istanbul, last
year, and Tel Aviv, in 1993, staged internationals in which Scotland was
happy to participate. Despite struggling economies, both nations
organised good meetings in a friendly, hospitable atmosphere.
Now, come Scotland's turn, the fixture faces the axe unless numerous
sponsorship feelers, extended to local authorities and the business,
commercial, and Jewish communities, bear speedy fruit, for the meeting
would cost #22,000 -- only #2000 less than total track and field
allocation for the year.
Scotland's international reputation may turn out to be the most savage
wound, but it would not be the only one as reserves of more than #60,000
have been wiped out. Surgery will jeopardise a range of activities from
grass-roots to internationals.
The policy and resources committee of SAF will learn the full extent
of the crisis this evening. Though not in the red, all reserves have
been wiped out in the past 12 months. This includes money brought in
upon amalgamation of the ruling bodies, as well as funds built up from
race-entry fees during the marathon boom.
A variety of factors, including inadequate financial controls,
illness, and an excessively costly photo-copying contract which has now
been rectified, all contributed. There is no question of malpractice,
but clubs are sure to demand a full explanation.
''There have been a number of problems,'' confirmed SAF secretary Bob
Greenoak. ''Each commission has been given a budget for the year, and it
is up to them to cut their cloth accordingly. They will decide
themselves what they can and cannot do. This is the first time that
system will have operated.''
The scale of cuts can be gauged from the fact that track and field
applied for #67,000, but is to receive just #24,000.
''That has to pay for all championships, internationals and junior
development,'' said SAF track and field convener George Duncan, whose
commission's activities will be hardest hit.
''We will probably be unable to send small teams abroad, to the
Belgian championships, for example, and only 40 people, rather than 90,
will be able to go to the inter-counties at Bedford. In the past we have
sent under-17, under-20 and senior teams to the AAA Championships. It
looks as though senior support will be axed, leaving them to pay their
own way.''
Glen Stewart, the national 1500m champion, who has won his event in
the threatened international for the past two years, said: ''We can't
afford to lose this match -- it's virtually the only one left.
''It's at the right level for Scotland, perfect for blooding
youngsters, and a good opener to the season. Colin Jackson has raced
both years for Wales. It has certainly helped me, and has provided
decent field event competition too, because of the many Russians who
compete for Israel.''
Track and field championships alone cost #22,589 last year, but costs
on that scale are unknown in road and cross-country. They are largely
self-sufficient, and which will be relatively unscathed. All their
events have been within budget. Indeed, when this weekend's Celtic
Nations' match, scheduled for Dublin, was axed, Scotland secured backing
from Irvine Development Corporation and agreed to host it. By not having
to travel, they will actually save money.
The World Mountain Racing Championships in Edinburgh, on September 10,
has a separate budget, and three-quarters of the total cost has already
been raised. They are still looking for a title sponsor, at a cost of
#10,000-#15,000, but the event will go ahead.

A CONFIDENTIAL report on rugby union professionalism will be delivered
to the the International Rugby Football Board at its headquarters in
Bristol next week, and it is expected to reveal that worldwide breaches
of the amateur code are taking place on a regular basis.
The report is the work of a special four-man International Board
working party on amateurism headed by IB chairman Vernon Pugh, QC, of
Wales, and comprising Freddie McLeod, of Scotland, Bernard Lapasset, of
France, and Rob Fisher, of New Zealand.
The IB investigation has been under way since April and seems to have
prompted the weekend's public pronouncements by New Zealand Rugby Board
chairman Eddie Tonks that the NZRFU were about to press for repeal of
the game's amateur regulations.
Tonks said that, because of the ''shamateurism'' which afflicted the
game, the situation was ''quite farcical.'' McLeod said that the
Scottish Rugby Union were still committed to the principle of
amateurism, but he conceded that the shamateurism referred to by the NZ
chairman was a statement of fact.
Yesterday, Tonks appeared to modify the Kiwi stance by denying he had
said that he had wanted the game to go professional.
He declared: ''We are merely backing the trend established by Vernon
Pugh. We are not talking about the game going professional. What we
believe is feasible is the establishment of a 'non-amateur' elite group
of players who will be treated as such on a temporary basis.
''We need to get rid of 'shamateurism', but we are not advocating the
abolition of amateurism. What we envisage is that a top player will be
under some sort of link with his union while he is at the top. But if he
earned money from the game there will be no penalties and he would be
able to play a major part in rugby straight away.
''That means that an elite player could turn immediately to coaching
or selection. We need control because there are so many outside elements
starting to influence the game. Vernon Pugh sees the writing on the
wall. He does not like what he reads necessarily, but acknowledges what
goes on now and is advocating that we remain in control of the future of
the game,'' said Tonks.
Yesterday Pugh told The Herald: ''I don't think it would be right for
me to comment on the contents of the working party report until it has
been presented to the board, and that will happen next week.
''This whole issue is something that we have had to grapple with over
the past 10 years or so. Within the game, what we have is a requirement
for the top players to perform in a professional way and in some
countries, at the top level, for them to have the ability to earn money
out of the game.
''One of the falsities of the current regulations is that players
can't make money out of the game. That isn't true. In fact, they can
make quite significant sums of money out of trust funds, advertising,
sponsorship, and so on.
''One of the things which the board may have to decide is do we leave
things as they are or do we make the system less complicated and remove
some of the camouflage whereby the very top players in some countries
are being rewarded very significantly?''
Currently, star players cannot be paid for playing but they can be
handsomely rewarded for off-field activities. This has led to charges of
hypocrisy being levelled at the game's legislators, the fact being that
if an individual wasn't an international rugby player then he would not
be in a position to make financial capital out of his exposure.
In Scotland, the commercial activities of the international squad are
co-ordinated by the players' agent, former Scotland skipper Ian
McLauchlan.
He said: ''I think it's inevitable that the game will go professional
at some point and certainly after the World Cup in June there will be
some kind of professional rugby union.
''I don't think we're talking about a huge number of players here but
certainly it is on the cards that international squad members will be
paid for playing international games.
''I don't agree that clubs would not be able to pay their players and,
in any case, I'm very suspicious that, elsewhere, this is happening
already. Human nature being what it is, I think it would be inevitable
that some clubs would want to keep their star men by paying them. I
would envisage payment something along the lines of the club cricket
professional.
''I don't think that in Scotland we would be any different from
anywhere else. I have argued for years that if clubs had to raise money
in order to raise the standard of their game then they would do so,'' he
said.
Human nature being what it is, I think it would be inevitable that
some clubs would want to keep their star men by paying them.

CHRIS Eubank's world title fight against Dubliner Steve Collins,
scheduled for Belfast on Saturday week, was yesterday officially
postponed, but promoter Barry Hearn is confident that the
super-middleweight clash can be rearranged for March 18, probably in
County Cork.
Hearn has visited the Green Glens Arena in Millstreet which he regards
as a possible substitute venue for the 28-year-old Eubank's latest
'World Tour' defence, and an announcement is expected later this week.
Eubank, who is midway through an eight-fight, #10m contract with Sky
TV, originally had been scheduled to meet Ray Close at the King's Hall,
but the Ulsterman had to pull out of a third meeting with Eubank after
abnormalities were revealed on a brain scan.
WBO middleweight champion Collins was signed up as a replacement, but
Sky were unhappy at being given only four weeks' notice of the change of
opponent.
A spokesman for Hearn's Matchroom organisation, Jason King, confirmed
that the satellite channel are contractually entitled to six weeks'
notice of any switch. ''Sky needed more time and so it has proved
necessary to to postpone the contest,'' he said.

A FINE penalty save by Paul Jones helped first division Wolves to a
0-0 draw with Sheffield Wednesday last night, but, once again, it was
referee Alan Wilkie who was at the centre of controversy.
The official, who recently sent Eric Cantona packing at Crystal
Palace, upset Wolves when he ruled that Chris Bart-Williams had been
brought down by Neil Emblen three minutes from time.
Initially it was believed that Emblen had played the ball out for a
corner well before the England Under-21 man stumbled, but Wilkie,
rightly, would not be moved.
However, justice, in the eyes of Wolves' followers, appeared to be
done when Jones threw himself high to his right and turn Bart-Williams'
spot-kick around a post, leaving Leicester City still waiting to
discover their fifth-round opponents.
But a video re-run clearly showed the midfielder had made contact with
Bart-Williams before playing the ball, and that the referee's decision
was correct.
And the match proved something of an anti-climax for Wednesday's
veteran Chris Waddle, who faded after the interval as the pace of the
match increased.

ALAN Wells' England A team are poised to complete a Test double for
English cricket. The A team, at 80 for two in their second innings, need
only a further 174 runs today to beat their Indian counterparts in
Calcutta and clinch a 2-0 series victory.
The home side, having resumed on 204 for two, looked to be coasting at
300 for four -- their lead already 200 on a wearing, dusty pitch. But
leg-spinner Ian Salisbury then took two wickets in nine balls to swing
the pendulum back England's way.
Pressure cricket told on the Indians, and Dominic Cork, who earlier
had made two important strikes with the second new ball, returned to cut
short a stubborn, last-wicket stand.
India A were all out for 353, and had lost their last six wickets for
53 -- but a victory target of 254 for Wells' team was still enough to
give the home side hopes of avenging England's four-wicket victory in
the first Test in Bangalore.
Phil Neale, the A team manager, said: ''We had a meeting and the
rallying call was that we had to show a lot of discipline in the field.
''The match is delicately balanced. I am making no predictions but we
just want all of our batsmen to stand up now and be counted.''

GREAT Britain failed on Sunday to finish off the USA in the women's
hockey series in San Diego. They had won the opening match 2-0 on
Saturday, but despite having been in control of the second game, they
allowed their opponents to gain the upper hand and reverse that
scoreline to level the series.
The contest was lost in a 60-second spell right after half-time when
two controversial umpiring decisions went America's way. The conversions
were made by captain Barbara Marois and Marcia Pankratz. It took Britain
some time to respond, but when they did it was not enough.
It was a disappointing end to a historic day for Scottish hockey. The
selection of Pauline Robertson, Susan Fraser, Diane Renilson, Janet
Jack, and Susan McDonald was the highest number of Scots to play for
Great Britain in an international. That record was beaten in the second
half when Rona Simpson came on as a substitute.
The reaction of the British players may for some determine their
places in the squad for the Olympic qualifying tournament in Cape Town
later this year.

MIKE Atherton had something to smile about yesterday after Phillip
DeFreitas and Devon Malcolm had set up a remarkable England 106-run
victory over Australia, the tourists first Test success Down Under for
eight years.
All-rounder DeFreitas hit 88 runs off 95 balls to turn England from
outsiders into joint favourites on the final morning of the fourth Test
in Adelaide. And then pace-bowler Malcolm pushed them towards the
winning post by capturing three crucial wickets in 12 deliveries.
DeFreitas struck nine fours, two sixes, and a fierce assault on Craig
McDermott's bowling. But DeFreitas's Derbyshire colleague Malcolm had
the satisfaction of taking the last Aussie wicket to finish with figures
of four for 39.
Atherton, the team captain, could not hide his joy. ''No-one gave us
much hope,'' he said, ''but sometimes adversity brings the best out of
people. This tour has been tough but moments like these make it all
worthwhile.''
DeFreitas launched his onslaught soon after having been struck by a
McDermott delivery. He picked himself up -- eventually -- and gained
sweet revenge by hammering 22 runs off one over from Australia's senior
strike bowler.
''He just bowled short and I kept hitting them,'' said DeFreitas.
''The captain told me to be positive but selective with my shots. There
was a bit of responsibility on me and I enjoyed it.''
England's Chris Lewis enjoyed himself a little too much after having
taken McDermott's wicket for a duck.
Lewis was fined 30% of his match fee for pointing McDermott to the
pavilion after the dismissal. The Englishman was pulled up by match
referee John Reid after he had gestured several times following his
dismissal of McDermott.
Reid said the action was ''a cowardly act once the batsman had been
dismissed and turned his back and could not be condoned.''
The referee also reprimanded Atherton for ''failing to ensure that the
match was conducted within the spirit of the game and the laws.''
Lewis, only called into England's squad last week because of an injury
crisis, will have to hand over around #650. And all 11 England players
have been docked 15% of their fee (#325) for a slow over-rate during the
Test.
Australia have made two changes for the final match of the series in
Perth, with Damien Fleming and Peter McIntyre making way for Jo Angel
and Brendon Julian.

STEVE Young was in inspirational form as he led the San Francisco
49ers to Super Bowl glory against the San Diego Chargers in Miami.
The 33-year-old quarterback set a new Super Bowl standard by throwing
six touchdown passes, breaking the record of five set by another great
49ers field general, Joe Montana.
Statistically, Young has been the best quarterback in the National
Football League during the regular season for the past four years. But
since replacing Montana, who led the 49ers to four championships in the
1980s, Young has been under pressure to produce a Super Bowl win.
''Steve made a comment on the sidelines. He said: 'I'm going to take
this monkey and pull it off my back. I've had it too long,''' related
centre Bart Oates. ''We kind of adopted Steve's pain and anguish. It was
ours too. We didn't want him to bear that pressure alone. He was living
in a shadow, and now is able to break out.''
The success was one for the ages and, like Montana before him, Young
was the unanimous choice for the game's Most Valuable Player.
Young completed 24-of-36 passes for 325 yards with six touchdowns and
no interceptions. He also was the game's leading rusher, scrambling for
49 yards on five carries -- something Montana could never do. ''I'm
fortunate that I've been part of an organisation that has had two of the
greatest quarterbacks of all time,'' said 49ers head coach George
Seifert.
Young had the high-powered 49ers offence really firing. He connected
with wide receiver Jerry Rice with a 44-yard touchdown pass on just the
third play of the game to set the tone for what was to come.
The quarterback engineered touchdown drives on San Francisco's first
three possessions and four of the first five times the 49ers handled the
ball, leaving the Chargers down 28-7 before they knew what hit them.
''In the first quarter it was like we were a symphony and Steve Young
was the conductor,'' said offensive lineman Jesse Sapolu, who earned his
fourth Super Bowl championship ring. ''I've always thought that Steve
was a great quarterback, and he has now lived up to that standard.
''He was put in a tough spot following Montana, but this game will
propel him to the Hall of Fame.''
Three of Young's touchdown passes were to Rice, who set a handful of
records of his own with his third outstanding Super Bowl performance of
a brilliant 10-year career.
Young's team-mates were lining up to sing his praises in the winner's
locker room after the 49-point performance. ''If there's anybody better
we haven't seen him yet,'' said linebacker Ken Norton Jr.

THE first phase of the golf course-rating programme in Scotland is
almost complete, putting the country at the forefront of what is fast
becoming a worldwide move to implement the American system of
handicapping.
A total of 360 Scottish clubs now have their new figures which have
been calculated over the last two years and are based on a variety of
difficulty factors. Just under half show a change on the previous method
of working out standard scratch scores on length alone.
Some 80 remain to be done, hopefully this year, and the groundwork is
now there in readiness for the next and most important phase which is to
introduce slope values which will allow handicaps to rise or fall at
away courses.
Bill Mitchell, chairman of the Scottish Golf Union's handicapping
committee, said: ''Slope is the big selling point and the one which will
affect handicap golfers whenever open competitions are played.''
This phase will come into effect in 1997 provided it is sanctioned by
the Council of National Golf Unions.
In the meantime, 14% of courses have lost a stroke on their SSS, 56%
remain the same, 27% are up one, and 3% have risen by two.
Scotland was among the first to embrace the American system, and since
then European countries including Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland,
Wales, Holland, Sweden, and Norway have followed suit as have several
Asian countries.
England, with around four times as many courses as Scotland, has been
dragging its heels at the prospect of such a huge undertaking, but
Mitchell believes there are positive signs that they will fall into
line.
Around half of Scottish courses had their new SSS in effect last
season. The remainder have been notified, hopefully in time to catch
print runs for 1995 scorecards, and not all have been straightforward.
Cowal, for example, shows a rise of one to 70, but the raters found the
course to be some 200 yards shorter than shown on the card, which meant
it should have been 69 beforehand. Effectively, therefore, there is no
change.
Of the current batch, Nairn, which has just been awarded the 1999
Walker Cup, goes up by two shots. The King's Course at Gleneagles Hotel
also rises by two.
Among the courses which go up a single shot is the testing but
unheralded nine-hole municipal course at Knightswood, Glasgow.
One aspect of the American system which has not been copied in
Scotland, at least not so far, is the use of course-rating data to
combat slow play. The Americans have used the figures to calculate a
time par for holes at certain courses.
Players will be given a printout of their scheduled time of arrival at
every tee, and marshals are empowered to instruct them to abandon a hole
and move on. In severe cases a slow-play ticket can be issued, and the
culprit must take a pace of play session with the club pro.
Courses which have a rise in SSS new for 1995 are (* denotes a stroke
previously added):
Angus: Arbroath +1 to 70; *Carnoustie +1 to 75; Panmure *1 to 71.
Argyll &amp; Bute: Cowal +1 to 70; Carradale +1 to 64; Dalmally +1 to 63;

JOHNNY Herbert was a happy man yesterday after having been confirmed
as No.2 driver to world champion Michael Schumacher in the Benetton team
for the next Formula One season.
Herbert was named at the launch of the team's new B195 car, ''I am
delighted to be able to race with a team like Benetton,'' said the
driver, ''and I am looking forward to it very much. Things were very
tricky for me for a while and it was difficult, but I am glad to have
this chance.
Herbert started his Formula One career with Lotus in 1989 when he
finished fourth on his debut in Brazil. But he suffered from the
after-effects of two broken legs, smashed in an accident at Brands Hatch
the previous year.

IAN McGeechan chooses one word to sum up the gulf that exists between
club rugby in England and Scotland. ''Frightening,'' says Scotland's
1990 Grand Slam coach who is now the salaried director of coaching with
English first division club Northampton.
McGeechan, 48, won 32 caps for Scotland between 1972 and 1979. He made
eight Test appearances for the British Lions in 1974 and 1977. The
Lions' connection was maintained when he coached the tourists to a
series victory against Australia in 1989, and he was in charge again
when the Lions were in New Zealand in 1993.
He is, then, a rugby thoroughbred, widely recognised as one of the top
coaches in the game and came top of Northampton's shopping list as they
followed the English trend of appointing rugby directors on five-figure
salaries.
McGeechan quit his job as training manager with the Scottish Life
insurance company in Edinburgh last October.
''Northampton had suffered five league defeats by the time I arrived
and we're now bottom of the division,'' he said. ''It wasn't quite what
I had expected, but I couldn't go when Northampton asked me in the
summer and they were happy to wait.''
He has now seen at first hand the resources available to the
Sassenachs whose downfall he successfully plotted during the 1990 Grand
Slam clash with England and, even for someone so steeped in the game, it
came as something of a shock.
''The difference in standard between the club game in Scotland and
down here is frightening. The intensity, the competitiveness is all on a
different level. There are over 200,000 players in England compared to
our 12,000 and the top Englishmen, by which I mean their first division
players, are very good indeed.
''The English came slow to league rugby and at international level
they're beginning to get their organisational act together. They should
always have been one of he world's top teams. At the end of the day,
though, at international level, they can only put 15 guys on the park,
just the same as us. What we in Scotland have to do is to keep raising
the standard of our top 20 to 25 players,'' he says.
McGeechan is confident that the Saints will recover in the second half
of the league programme from their spot at the foot of Courage League
One. Northampton progressed to the quarter-final stages of the
Pilkington Cup at the weekend. Nevertheless, McGeechan's role isn't made
any easier by the club's lack of league success.
As an up-front professional in the ostensibly amateur world of rugby
union, he is one of a growing band of paid directors of rugby within the
English game. But will he, like his football counterparts, live or die
by his side's results on the park?
''I don't feel that I'm under any great pressure. They are pretty
loyal in Northampton and the club has been in the dumps before. People
realise that we're still on the way up so far as development is
concerned. Heaven forbid, if we did happen to get relegated then nothing
would change with sponsorship or support from the town. And in any case,
we would anticipate coming straight back up.''
None the less, there is more riding on first division survival than
the embarrassment of empty spaces in the trophy room.
Like all English division one clubs Northampton is run as a thriving
business. It has a turnover of #1.2m a year, a conference centre linked
to the ground, major sponsors in the shape of Carlsberg and, soon, Firm
Security, nine executive boxes plus a hospitality suite serving 400
lunches before a big game at Franklins Gardens.
''All of that is run by a commercial manager and I'm responsible for
the rugby set-up. I'm doing a lot of coaching just now but that is to
get to know the players and implement a style and pattern throughout the
club. My main responsibility is the whole organisation of the playing
side. It's almost like being youth development officer for the area as
well.
''At Northampton, with a population base of around 200,000, we run a
first XV, seconds, under-21, and under-18. We develop open days for
schoolboys and draw them into the youth development programme at the
club. There are two first-team coaches, two second-team coaches, two
under-21 coaches, a youth coach, and they are all under a youth
development manager. We also have a fitness adviser who is one of the
club physios. You can see, then, that it's quite an impressive set-up.''
McGeechan is still involved with the Scotland national side whenever
he can spare the time. Currently, along with Murrayfield's director of
rugby Jim Telfer, he is preparing a coaching video for the use of club's
in Scotland.
''Jim and I are in conversation quite a lot and I'm hoping to get up
to Scotland soon, although maybe not in time to do anything before the
Ireland game on Saturday.
''I haven't been involved with Scotland as much as I would have liked,
but that's partly looking at the best way in which I can be utilised by
the coaches Dougie Morgan and Richie Dixon. I'm there to support them as
and when they see fit,'' he said.
''There isn't a problem there. Dougie and I have been friends for a
long time. Jim Telfer was keen to bring in the system of the coaches
plus two others that worked so well during the 1991 World Cup.
Northampton are quite happy for me to be involved when I don't have club
commitments.
''I look upon it really as being part of my on-going rugby education.
I like to look at things tactically and try to keep the Scottish game
one jump ahead of the opposition.''
From his vantage point behind enemy lines at Northampton's Franklins
Gardens, McGeechan is ideally placed to do just that.

A TOTAL of 102 runners have been attracted to today's meeting at
Edinburgh, and several top jockeys are due to be in action if the
meeting at Nottingham does not survive an early morning inspection.
Punters may have problems finding winners from the big fields, and
with 30 entries, the Loganlea Novices Hurdle has been split and the
start brought forward to 12.50.
Adrian Maguire, with 97 winners but still 15 behind suspended champion
jockey Richard Dunwoody, has four booked mounts and the possiblity of
reaching his century on Scottish soil.
Norman Williamson, who partnered Gold Cup favourite Master Oats in his
outstanding victory at Cheltenham on Saturday, also is engaged as is
Mark Dwyer, who won the Irish Champion Hurdle on Fame and Fortune on
Sunday.
Four winners from the last meeting on January 13 hoping to repeat
their success are Trump, Boarding School, Wee River, and Fair and Fancy.
Trump has been a model of consistency this season, winning his last four
races, three of them at Edinburgh.
Colin Parker's gelding is certain to start at a short price in the
Harperrig Hurdle, but Mary Reveley's Moonshine Dancer, winner of its
last two races, has a weight advantage of 11lbs, and stamina will tell
over the three miles.
Boarding School, who finished third to Oh So Risky in the 1991 Triumph
Hurdle, is another in-form Parker horse worthy of consideration. He
completed a double for the Lockerbie trainer at the last meeting when he
won the Whiteadder Chase, and must have a chance in the #5000 Kilmany
Cup Chase.
The Duke of Sutherland's nine-year-old Cornet, who finished third to
Boarding School last time and loves this course, also is in the race.

AS the dust settles on the Second Gathering at the Royal Concert Hall,
broadcaster Iain Anderson and head of music, Mark Sheridan, reflect on
the success of Strathclyde University's Feis and Celtic Connections '95.
THE fact that the largest world Celtic Festival at Lorient in Brittany
has close links with the Breton Universities of Brest and Rennes has not
been lost on either the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall or Strathclyde
University. Conscious of the need to raise its arts profile and aware of
the renaissance of Celtic culture in its heartland, the university chose
a three-pronged attack to lead the way in its Feis -- the Gaelic term
for the festivals which adorn the Gaeltacht in summer which are
dedicated to teaching and music making.
This town and gown approach sat comfortably with the ethos of the
Concert Hall's Celtic Connections Festival, which attracted nearly
60,000 folk through its doors. Within the framework the university
provided three major platforms -- a series of morning lectures, a
variety of afternoon master classes and a twilight YouthFest where
tuition was provided by Gaelic speaking teachers in the playing of the
traditional instruments including pipes, fiddle and clarsach. All were
free.
The range of expertise brought to bear was impressive; the keynote
lectures took as their overall theme ''Celtic Renaissance -- Myth and
Reality?'' and the Concert Hall's Buchanan Suite became the focus of
point and counterpoint as Iain Crichton Smith on the one hand, and Edna
O'Brien on the other, illuminated the highways and byways of 20th
Century Gaelic and Irish literature with reminiscence, anecdote and
sometimes a cutting edge.
The Lorient Festival Director Jean Pierre Pichard confided that he had
met his wife buying a steak and kidney pie in Great Western Road but
astonished his large audience with the story of the major Breton
recovery since the end of the war and of his negotiations with the
French Government to grant a Breton Charter.
The university's own eminent historian Professor Tom Devine offered
for the first time new evidence on the whys and wherefores of Highland
and Lowland clearances. The buzz of interest and the post-mortem
following each lecture spoke volumes.
As to the master classes, rarely can such a star-studded line-up have
been assembled consecutively during one week -- Hamish Moore, Phil
Cunningham, Aly Bain, Dougie MacLean, Savourna Stevenson and Flora
MacNeill.
Natural teachers they all turned out to be, each with skilled students
in front of an admiring audience delving into tunes, techniques, styles
and providing a rare insight into the Celtic musical heritage and the
contemporary world. Coming from the highest-profile practitioners in the
real world was rather special!
If one were to treasure any particular comment -- and there were many
-- it would have to be from the innovative Perthshire pipe Hamish Moore.
Speaking of the wild and free music of the pipes in Highland Scotland
before the '45, he said -- ''It's really just 18th century Rock n'
Roll''.

POOLS company Zetters is reverting to the old system of three points
for every score draw because it cannot compete with the National Lottery
jackpots.
Since the beginning of the soccer season the three main pools
companies have been awarding customers only the maximum three points for
1-1 score draws, restricting the number of top winners and producing a
jackpot far more often.
The new system was brought in to compete with the lottery which
started in November.
Zetters, the third largest of the pools companies behind Littlewoods
and Vernons, said it was losing slightly more than 10% of turnover
compared with a year ago as customers defected to the lottery.
In a bid to keep its punters, it has already abandoned the system of
rolling over dividends from week to week because customers prefer to
collect their payout in the week in which they win.
Now the jackpot draws system is to be dropped as well. ''We believe
that our customers bet with us because they know they get 900 chances of
winning relatively modest dividends for a stake of one pound, as against
the single chance of winning huge prizes in the lottery for a pound
stake,'' it explained.
''We are pushing that message as hard as we can.''
In the six months to September 30, pre-tax profits increased to
#690,000 from #421,000 in the corresponding period in 1993 because of
increased pools turnover.
''However, that increase was checked by the introduction of the
National Lottery in November and our business continues to be adversely
affected,'' said the company.
Earnings per share rose to 6.9p from 4.2p and the interim dividend is
raised from 4p to 5p.
''With only weeks to go to the end of the current financial year, we
believe our pre-tax profit for the full year will be not less than the
#1.01m in the previous year, and the dividend not less than the total of
8.5p paid for that year.''

RENFREWSHIRE'S Mearns Castle High School will this week make its own

The Great Britain team, which features two Scots, will take on

as part of the third annual training camp for the athletes being held at
the school.
The Newton Mearns secondary has strong connections with the Great
Britain team, with the principal teacher of Physical Education, Jim
McKenna, having coached the squad since 1990.
''The school has adopted the squad as one of its charities and has
given us tremendous backing,'' said Mr McKenna, a former Scottish
able-bodied volleyball internationalist with 75 caps.
''For three years now we've been able to gather the team together from
all over Britain at the school for this camp, all because of the support
received from staff and pupils at the school,'' Mr McKenna added.
This backing has helped the team develop into an outfit aiming to
improve on their Barcelona showing with a medal-winning display in the
1996 Atlanta paralympics.
The decision to bring the GB squad to the school is in part a thank
you for the pupils' help and money-raising efforts, which will pay for
the travel and accommodation of both the Slovak team and the nine
England-based GB players.
Great Britain has played the Slovaks three times and lost out, in
admittedly tight games, in every encounter in this type of disabled
volleyball, where all the participants are able, some with the help of
artificial limbs, to play ''standing up''.
That's a record Scots internationalists David Macrae from Edinburgh
and Falkirk student Leslie Stoddart will be trying hard to improve as
part of the six strong GB mens' team, pressing home the supposed
advantage of home ground.
Mr Macrae, a 31-year-old sports development officer with Teamsport
Scotland, says he will be channelling his Eric Cantona-like fieriness
into a peak performance in the first time he's played for his country in
his country.
''I've just recently been fitted with a new sports leg at the Southern
General so I should be able to keep up my fitness and speed level for
some time,'' says the sports officer, who was born with a congenital
deformity in his right leg.
Should the ball land on the wrong side of the line too often for the
Britons on Friday, they will have an early chance of revenge with a
rematch on Sunday at Kilmarnock's Galleon Centre.

ONE potential white knight for pharmaceutical group Wellcome appears
to have disappeared off the horizon and rationalisation of the world
pharmaceuticals industry looks like taking a step further.
The mighty German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group Hoechst is
believed to be close to acquiring a controlling stake in Marion Merrell
Dow, which has a market value of $6700m (#4500m).
Dow Chemical has a 71% stake in Marion Merrell which it has been
trying to sell and Hoechst is known to be keen to increase its presence
in the US, the world's largest pharmaceutical market. If the deal is
successful it will create the world's fourth-largest drugs group with a
combined market share of 3.8%.
Hoecsht, along with Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US, has been
mentioned as potential rival bidders to Glaxo for Wellcome. Early on in
his career, Sir Richard Sykes, deputy chairman and chief executive of
Glaxo, spent 10 years with Squibb in the US before he returned as No 2
to David Jack, Glaxo's former head of research.
It would require an international company of the size of Hoechst --
the world's fourth-largest drugs firm by sales -- to better Glaxo's
hostile #9000m bid for Wellcome. Any potential counter bidder is likely
to wait until Wellcome's 1994 results are published. These are expected
by the end of the week, having been brought forward from March 1.
Perhaps not surprisingly the figures are expected to show Wellcome in
a positive light with sales of the anti-hepres drug Zovirax growing in
several markets, notably Japan. Retrovir, marketed as AZT in the
treatment of HIV infection is also expected to show a recovery in sales
after being adversely affected last year by the Concorde scientific
study.
The consensus view is for Wellcome to make pre-tax profits of around
#720m compared with #624m in 1993 but the proft figure could well come
towards the top end of expectations at #735m.
Glaxo is itself expected to dispatch its final offer document for
Wellcome next week along with half-year results brought forward from
February 16. The dispatch of the final offer document will set the clock
ticking, effectively giving Wellcome just three weeks to find a higher
offer. Wellcome's 39.5% shareholder, the Wellcome Trust, is to enter
into an irrevocable commitment to sell its stake to Glaxo, provided no
better offer is made within 21 days of the document being posted.
Glaxo's results could make less encouraging reading after the company
warned last week that sales of its best-selling Zantac ulcer drug fell
for the first time ever in the six months to end-December. Even before
this announcement City analysts were prediciting a profit rise of just
2% to #1020m pre-tax, assuming flat Zantac revenues of #1200m.
However, there are expected to be better performances from newer drugs
such as the asthma treatment Serevent and migraine drug Imigran. Further
losses on its bond portfolio are expected to be revealed. The company
disclosed last September that it expected to book losses of #16m in
1994-95, on top of the #115m bond loss taken in the previous financial
year.
Both companies are expected to try to make the most of new Aids drug
clinical trial data due to be published tomorrow. The results, revealed
at a conference in Washington, are expected to confirm the benefits of
combining Wellcome's AZT with a new drug 3TC, being developed by Glaxo.
No doubt Glaxo will use the findings to justify its claims of the kind
of synergies to be gained from combining the two firms' research and
development pipelines.
Initial European trial data, unveiled at a drugs conference in Glasgow
in November, showed that a mixture of 3TC and AZT produced the most
pronounced anti-HIV effect monitored to date. Ian White, analyst at
Robert Fleming, believes that the annual sales of AZT could more than
double from the 1993 level of #248m within four or five years.
The City is sceptical about the chances of Wellcome successfully
beating off Glaxo. Wellcome shares continue to discount the Glaxo offer
which if successful could make seven Wellcome directors #10m richer.
Wellcome chairman John Robb stands to receive almost #2.5m through share
options and compensation for termination of his two-year rolling
contract.
Yesterday, in light trading, Wellcome shares dropped 17p to 981p,
while Glaxo fell 7p to 610p.

THE manager of a car repair centre was sacked after he told a customer
that he needed three new tyres in addition to a puncture repair.
The customer subsequently had his tyres checked by the Trading
Standards Department, and discovered that the renewal of all three had
not been necessary.
As a result Drew Dalziel, former manager of Kwik-Fit's Pollokshaws
Road branch in Glasgow, was transferred to a smaller branch in Glasgow
then sacked, an industrial tribunal heard.
It ruled that his sacking was unfair but awarded him no compensation.
Mr Dalziel, 23, of Kennilworth Drive, Clarkston, Airdrie, who had
joined the company as a graduate trainee, told the customer he needed
three new tyres for his Ford Granada Scorpio and the tyres were
replaced.
Next day the customer complained that the fleet car had been serviced
a short time earlier and there had been no recommendation about any
tyres. He wanted the old tyres returned for inspection.
Mr Dalziel's area manager checked the tyres and found that at least
one need not have been replaced, but said he would have recommended
replacement of one in a high-performance car.
Trading standards inspection showed the remaining tread on all three
tyres to be greater than that claimed by Mr Dalziel.
Mr Dalziel's disciplinary hearing was convened without warning and he
was dismissed.
He claimed his tyre gauge had been faulty and had given inaccurate
readings.
The tribunal was satisfied that his superiors genuinely believed he
had carried out unnecessary work on a customer's car and had
deliberately misled the customer. But his sacking was unfair for
procedural reasons.
The tribunal said there could be no doubt he was entirely the author
of his own misfortune, and awarded no compensation.

A LITHUANIAN trawler skipper was fined #1000 at Aberdeen Sheriff Court
yesterday following a major oil spill in the city's harbour.
Mr Aloyzas Leibus, 55, captain of the Mikhail Baka, admitted
contravening oil pollution regulations. He had spent the weekend in
custody.
Depute-fiscal Angus Perry told the court the vessel's chief engineer
had been loading fuel at Point Law on Friday night. At 1.40am on
Saturday, he noticed crew members trying to clean something up.
He realised fuel was going over the vessel's side and guessed an air
lock had formed in a fuel tank.
Harbour authorities were informed and it was found there was an oil
spillage for 300 metres west of the vessel and 30 metres east.
A boom was used to contain the spillage, the biggest at Aberdeen
Harbour for two or three years. Some 4500 litres of oil were recovered
but this was thought to be only a portion of the total. The cost of the
clean-up is estimated at up to #15,000.
A defence agent said an air lock appeared to have formed in the one of
the tanks of the four-year-old vessel, which had a crew of 51, and
Leibus, who had 33 years' experience at sea and earned #3000 a year, had
not been at fault.

Dick Louden reports on an innovative scheme in Stirling where older
pupils help youngsters cope with emerging problems
ACCORDING to Anne Stewart, head teacher of Raploch Primary School in
Stirling, some of her pupils do not even have a warm corner at home
where they can do their homework. ''Others,'' she says, ''lack
affection, attention and a role model to learn from''.
Raploch is an area of priority treatment where deprivation undermines
the lives of many young people. An attempt to address their needs is now
being made by the Raploch Primary School Project, funded under the Urban
Aid programme.
The project workers, operating under the aegis of the education and
social work services of Central region, have developed close links with
the school, parents and professional agencies.
A parents' room has been set up, a pre-entry programme -- involving a
series of workshops and outings -- has been devised for parents of the
new primary one intake and, in conjunction with teachers, a range of
social skills topics has been tackled with the primary five and six
classes.
An impressive feature of the project is the Homework Group, which
caters for 26 Raploch pupils, attending once a week after school. At any
stage from primary three upwards, they are the product of a referral
process which identifies, in the words of Anne Stewart, ''either
personal or learning difficulties, perhaps involving attitude
problems''. She has no misgivings about the value of the Homework Group.
''The children adore it. They are very enthusiastic, attend regularly
and have the benefit of a model of how to do homework.''
The model is provided by sixth-year volunteers from Wallace High
School, matched on a one-to-one basis with the Raploch youngsters. Each
year pupils from Wallace High are recruited before the summer and given
training on practical issues before they undertake their role. ''They
come forward of their own volition, boys and girls alike,'' says Jane
Alcorn-Barclay, one of the project workers. ''Some are planning for a
career working with children. Others want to develop their interpersonal
skills. The outcome we are seeking is a happier child who has formed a
stable relationship with an older teenager.''
Anne Stewart is full of praise for the role models. ''It is a
considerable commitment from sixth-year pupils,'' she explains. ''In
addition, some of our young pupils are not easy to work with.''
The Homework Group requires parents to enter into a contract which is
formalised after a meeting with the proposed volunteer. Thereafter
parents receive an informal report every three or four weeks and a home
visit at the end of the school session.
Jane Alcorn-Barclay, a community liaison officer, and Terri Johnston,
a teacher, are the motivators. ''We hold them in high regard,'' says
Anne Stewart. ''They offer us a different perspective on how to deal
with children.''
A typical homework session begins at 3.30 p.m. with a group
discussion, a snack and games. Then the Wallace High volunteers arrive
and homework begins. A child with no homework can choose either paired
reading or a worksheet. Thereafter, they select an activity for example
baking, computing, art and craft. Tidying-up is followed by the
completion of a group diary, then the children are driven home at five
o'clock.
On my visit nine-year-old John, in his second year at the group, was
building sentences. ''We've got 19 encyclopedias at home,'' he told me,
''and I like reading them''. John's problem is, it seems, to do with
attitude.
His volunteer, David Barbour, hopes to take medicine or a
chemistry-related course. ''I joined after speaking to others who did it
last year,'' he said. ''It's satisfying to help somebody younger.''
Nicola, a recent recruit to the group, liked ''doing extra sums and
working with the computer''. Her role model, Katrina Jackson, is
interested in a career in psychology and feels that ''helping,
especially with reading, has made me more patient''.
At five o'clock the volunteers had a debriefing session, chaired by
Terri, before being driven home. The session produced some illuminating
comments:
''She's not good at choosing a book to read because she doesn't bother
to read the title.''
''She has a thing about people who have died. That's three in the last
three weeks she's talked about.''
''He said he was battered, ran on to the school roof, did a cartwheel
off it but didn't hurt himself because he landed on his tummy.''
Bill Brodie, head teacher of Wallace High, is proud of his sixth-year
volunteers. ''The numbers are continuing to grow. It is something that
the sixth year really looks forward to. They love the one-to-one
situation and see the relationship with a younger child as part of their
personal and social development,'' he said.

A NORTH Sea oil worker broke down and cried yesterday as he told how a
colleague collapsed unconscious in his arms.
Toolpusher Mr Ian Livingstone was given time to compose himself before
continuing his evidence to an inquiry into the death of his workmate.
Subsea engineer Mr Lachlan Service died after being struck on the
chest by a spanner while carrying out a routine job on the
Conoco-operated Hutton platform.
A fatal accident inquiry in Aberdeen heard that Mr Service, 50, a
father-of-two of Fulmar Crescent, Ardersier, near Inverness, had been
supervising the removal of bolts from a wellhead when the accident
happened last May.
The Noble Drilling (UK) employee died in a helicopter on the way to
hospital in Shetland.
Mr Livingstone, of Consett, County Durham, had been helping with the
routine maintenance work on the installation, 90 miles north-east of
Shetland, when he was called away just before the incident.
He said: ''I had just got back there when I heard a bang. I turned
round and went running over the scaffolding to where they were working.
Lachlan didn't have his hat on and he was covered with clear black
stuff.
''He started to come off the scaffolding and as he leaned over towards
me I put out my arms to steady him. Then he just collapsed and went
unconscious.''
Mr Service came round as the platform medic and emergency team were
treating him, Mr Livingstone added.
Derrickman Mre Graham Woods, 32, of Walker Place, Aberdeen, described
that Mr Service had been unscrewing a bolt when it became stuck and they
tried to free it.
''I was working the torque wrench and Lachlan was sitting at the side
of the bolt. I gave one push on the torque wrench and it came out.
''The bolt came out and took the torque wrench and me with it and
struck him on the chest,'' added Mr Woods.
Medic Mr John Mullon, 47, of Strathmore, Inverness, said Mr Service
was breathless and complaining of pain to his chest where there was a
large swelling.
''I took his blood pressure and pulse when he got to the sick bay and
I did not think they were abnormal. I offered him pain killers but he
refused.''
After seeking medical advice from Aberdeen, Mr Mullon called out a
doctor from the neighbouring accommodation barge, Safe Gothia.
Dr James Johnstone, 45, of Forest Avenue, Aberdeen told the inquiry he
decided to transfer the engineer to hospital in Shetland.
Dr Johnstone said: ''On the helicopter his condition remained stable
for a while and then he became more distressed, began to sweat and
deteriorated steadily thereafter.
''He went into respiratory cardiac arrest and did not respond to
artificial respiration.''
A post mortem examination showed that Mr Service had broken ribs which
had punctured a lung.
The inquiry continues today.

SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams was sceptical last night about being
called ''brave'' by former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke. But
he demanded courage from Mr Major to speed up the peace talks.
He warned: ''There is a lot of disillusionment, a sense of the British
Government being begrudging about this entire process.'' But he denied
that the IRA is about to end the ceasefire. He called the demand for the
IRA to disarm as a precondition to full talks a ''distraction''. These
talks could begin right now, even if the UK-Irish Governments' joint
framework document is delayed.
''The British Government needs to exhibit bravery and John Major needs
to show bravery in moving all of this process forward. We need to get
into a continuous debate about what needs to be done. An awful lot needs
to be done. It's not easy to make peace but unless we start real talking
we will never get to the point where there will be a lasting peace.''
He told Mr Major on BBC Radio: ''Set the date, set the venue, send out
the invitations, and we will get together and talk and we will make an
agreement on how to resolve the conflict in my country.''
He was unwilling to accept the compliment paid to him last night in a
television documentary in which the former Northern Ireland Secretary
acknowledged the courage of Mr Adams in getting the IRA to deliver a
ceasefire. Mr Adams had not seen the programme and would not respond
until he had.
Yesterday the British Government was philosophical about Mr Brooke's
comment which has irritated the Ulster Unionists. Downing Street was
more interested in the visit to Belfast by the Irish Opposition leader,
Mr Bertie Ahern, who insisted that London is not stalling on the peace
process. Delays in the framework document which seeks to give direction
to constitutional talks was partly due to the pre-Christmas political
crisis in Dublin.
Mr Ahern, whose visit to Belfast City Hall and the Ulster Unionist
headquarters was historic for a member of Fianna Fail, supported Mr
Brooke's comments about the Sinn Fein leader. He called it fair comment.
''Gerry Adams is obviously leading his people and leadership is always
to be admired.''
But the more Mr Adams is portrayed as a reasonable man and the longer
it takes for London and Dublin to produce the joint framework document,
the more alarmed the Ulster Unionists become.
Last week a long meeting between Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern
Ireland Secretary, and the Irish Foreign Minister, Mr Dick Spring,
failed to resolve the remaining difficulties involving constitutional
change and cross-border co-operation.
Experts on both sides believe it will take another month before the
Prime Minister and the Irish Premier, Mr John Bruton, can announce
agreement.

With apologies to Rab C.
SEE that bit aboot gatherin' her brows an' nursin' her wrath? Funny,
the things that creep into yir thick skull when yir stoatin' along the
road in the direction a' her indoors, wonderin' whit species o' warm,
affectionate welcome she'll hae in store. Biled tatties wi' yir T-bone,
ma beloved? Bile yir heid, mair like.
If wummen could jist see things the right way, oor way. Whit's wrang
wi' an innocent bevvy an' a blether wi' yir mates, like commiseratin'
wi' big daft Tammy Lafferty cos his missus has found him a job? That's
a' there is to it. I'm no' on the temazepam, I dinnae chase skirts up
close. It's straight fur hame an' ma wee doll.
Nearly straight, anyroads. Sometimes yi cannae make it back to base
frae the McCoist Arms withoot unfuellin' in mid-air. So I stagger
through this door wi' Gentlemen on it an' there's wan o' them staunin
next tae me. I ken he's a gent cos there's a black briefcase at his
feet, gettin' a tad moist.
''Nice to see a new face in here,'' sez I, causin' him to zip up in
panic. ''No' often yi find a higher class o' person alleviatin' himsel'
in this shunk.''
''Actually,'' sez he, in a voice like that eejit the Prince o' Wails,
''I was brought up in these parts. Round the corner from Ibrox Stadium.
I was born in Mafeking Street.''
''An' I wis born in mine,'' sez I, fair let doon. The royal tumshie
widnae talk like that, so he widnae.
He soaps his manicured mitts an' hauds them, palms up, under the
rubber machine, thinkin' it's the dryer. ''So it's buyin' in bulk, are
we?'' sez I. ''Busy night comin' up, eh?''
He glares at ma designer semmit ower his multifocals, then pokes a
gold comb through his long an' curlies.
''So it's aff to the buroo, is it?'' sez I, aye wan fur the friendly
patter.
''Indeed not,'' sez he. ''I'm a civil servant from Edinburgh. I'm here
to check on the ongoing progress of a local secondary school which
survived a threat of closure.''
''Yi've no' come to shut poor wee St Gerard's?'' sez I, fair
affronted. ''The MP, wee Harley Davidson, wid be a mite miffed, I
jalouse.''
The gink's flabber is fair gasted. ''Why do you call him Harley
Davidson?''
''Cos he's har'ly got a hair on his napper, that's why! An' if yi get
by wee Harley, yi've still got to face up to the new cooncillor, big
Deirdre. She scared the jacksies aff the SNP.''
''I do not intend to close the school,'' sez he, a' starchy. ''The
Scottish Office is not in the habit of taking on unpleasant tasks like
school closures itself. It leaves them to education authorities, which
are best placed to evaluate the local circumstances in implementing
their rationalisation programmes.''
I gie him a connivin' nudge an' wink. ''I admire youse high heid
bummers,'' sez I. ''Yi're great at lookin' efter number wan. Yi're no'
hauf fly. Except that, when yi drew up the law aboot closures, yi made a
right St Rollox o' it. Whit dae yi employ fur lawyers -- ravin'
numpties?''
He hauf opens his gob to gie me laldy, then shuts it. That's whit
separates educated sheep like him frae gormless goats like me. See when
yi get right doon to it, the classless society is a meringue. It disnae
exist. This po-faced geezer has the breedin' to haud himsel' back where
I wid huv spewed oot some auld load o' horse droppin'.
He picks up his briefcase, which is dryin' oot in the heat o' the
intellectual discussion, sez ''I wish you a good day'' -- noo, is that
no' class fur yi? -- an' minces to the door.
''Let me tell yi this, boy,'' I shout efter him. ''Education has a
bliddy lot to answer fur. Thae schools huv far too many holidays, fur a
start.''
''I don't think I follow your drift,'' sez he, wi' a face like Tam
Dalyell at a funeral.
Follow yir drift! That kind o' lingo gets right on ma threepenny bits.
It taks a' ma class fur me no' to gie him whit fur. ''That's a' we need
roon' here,'' sez I. ''Weans clutterin' up the entrance to the buroo an'
the waterin'-holes an' dominies hangin' aboot street corners, bawlin'
obscenities at oor wummen.''
He shakes his heid an' slopes aff. Wid yi credit it? Yi show a bit o'
social conscience an' yi get the bum's rush. It's enough to make yi
bitter an' heavy -- talkin' o' which, by the way . . .

ANOTHER remarkable milestone in Northern Ireland's peace process was
passed yesterday. The leader of Fianna Fail, Mr Bertie Ahern, travelled
from Dublin and passed under the Union flag flying atop Unionist
headquarters to attend a meeting that would have been unthinkable until
recently.
It was the first time that a Fianna Fail leader had visited the Ulster
Unionists. He met a delegation that included the Fermanagh and South
Tyrone MP, Mr Ken Maginnis.
Afterwards both sides agreed there had been plain talking, if little
agreement, but the fact that the meeting took place at all was of
considerable encouragement to British officials in Belfast struggling to
find agreement with Dublin on a ''Framework Document'' to be published
shortly.
Behind the handshakes, however, lie unsolved problems stemming from
two issues -- the release of IRA and loyalist prisoners, and the weapons
still remaining in terrorist hands. Into this mix has come the
controversy over Private Lee Clegg, the soldier convicted of murdering a
joyrider in West Belfast.
To the IRA, the early release of prisoners is crucial if they are to
put away their guns for good. But so far the Government has resisted all
pressures on this front, even though the Irish authorities in Dublin
have already released nine prisoners and are about to set more free,
probably tomorrow.
Six of the remaining 46 IRA prisoners in the Republic are expected to
be freed on the orders of the Minister for Justice. They include one
woman, Pamela Kane, 30, who is serving a 10-year sentence for armed
robbery.
The new releases follow the freeing of a group of IRA prisoners before
Christmas. That action was not mirrored by the authorities in Northern
Ireland because Unionists, in particular, believe it is too early to
grant such concessions.
As evidence of this the Ulster Unionist MP, John Taylor, accused the
Irish Government yesterday of appeasing the IRA. He said he was much
more concerned at speculation about new releases because, unlike those
freed before Christmas, the prisoners concerned still had a considerable
time to serve behind bars.
The issue of Private Clegg has brought into sharp perspective
conflicting views in Ireland about the release of prisoners and the
dilemma facing the Government. While opinion in Britain appears strongly
in support of the soldier's release, politicians in Dublin are furious
at any such suggestion, even though they themselves accept that jailed
terrorists must be set free in a staged programme of releases aimed at
responding to the IRA ceasefire.
In Northern Ireland, too, attitudes to Private Clegg are also divided.
In West Belfast, where he patrolled and shot dead 18-year-old Karen
Reilly, there is outrage at any suggestion of his freedom. But this is
also the heartland of the campaign to free republican prisoners. The
Sinn Fein president, Mr Gerry Adams, told a rally in Londonderry on
Sunday that ''Clegg's release at this time would be premature but, of
course, as part of the release of all the prisoners, he, too, should be
released''.
Behind the closed doors of a committee room at Stormont, a Sinn Fein
delegation has now had three meetings with British officials at which
the issue of the prisoners and of the IRA's arms and explosives remains
unresolved. The two sides will meet again tomorrow in the knowledge
that, if there is not a breakthrough soon on their differences, the
entire peace process could be put at risk.
Even if the Government wished to make a concession, its hands look
tied by its need to maintain the support of the nine Ulster Unionist
MPs. The Unionists insist that the IRA must hand over all weaponry
before Sinn Fein can be accepted as a legitimate party to any future
talks. On the question of prisoners there is little to encourage the
Government. At best it may be possible to release a few prisoners,
republicans and loyalists, who have served long sentences and might be
seen to have already paid sufficient penalty for their crimes.
The RUC's Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Annesley, has taken a hard line
stating emphatically that he is opposed to setting free terrorists
involved in some of the most heinous killings in recent years. To add to
the problem, alleged terrorist killers are still coming before the
courts.
So the Government faces the almost impossible task of balancing the
demands of Sinn Fein on the issue of prisoners with the public mood in
Northern Ireland, which is far from unanimous and, indeed, shows
widespread hostility towards any concessions.
As for the weaponry, that also is in stalemate. Sinn Fein insists that
it can only speak for itself and not the IRA and there is no sign of the
latter being prepared to give up the substantial cache of Semtex
explosive, and other weapons, which lie hidden somewhere in Ireland.
The Irish Government is also embarrassed by the weapons issue but says
this should not be a precondition for including Sinn Fein in political
dialogue. The Unionists disagree, just as they are wary about the
release of prisoners, and so the Government can move only very
cautiously in the hope that as the days of peace grow longer, public
attitudes will change.

FINANCIAL markets are still looking for a further half-point hike in
base rates at some stage taking them to 6.75%.
This could come on Thursday after the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, has
his monthly meeting with the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie
George, although some economists consider he may hold off until March in
order to have the benefit of another month's economic activity data.
Yesterday's MO money supply figures for January, the narrow definition
covering mainly notes and coins in circulation, could give him an excuse
to wait a little longer if he wanted to.
Whereas most other economic signals have indicated that there are
inflationary stirrings and that the economy is still growing fast, MO
surprised the market by showing a decline of 0.3% over the month,
dropping the annual rate of growth to January to 6.4% from 6.7% in
December. This compares with market projections for a small increase and
could reflect a marked slowdown in High Street spending after Christmas.
However, the recent CBI Industrial Trends Survey, which is regarded as
a particularly important pointer by the Chancellor, showed business
optimism still buoyant and manufacturing output advancing strongly.
Capacity utilisation increased and there were also cost and price
pressures.
The CBI itself has argued against a rise in interest rates because
certain sectors of the economy such as construction and housing still
remain vulnerable but this will not dissuade him if he feels there are
pronounced danger signals for future inflation. And certainly the
Governor is not one for delaying a move if he feels it necessary and can
carry the Chancellor with him.
On Friday, though, the Chancellor did say that he expected economic
growth to be a little less than the estimated 4% and that the key thing
was to sustain it and not take it for granted. This could be taken as a
hint that rates would not move this week. But even if it is delayed for
a month, this could unsettle markets which are still discounting an
increase. If a rise is regarded as inevitable, there seems little point
in delaying it.
US rates are also expected to be lifted when the Federal Open Market
Committee, the US monetary policy panel, meet later today. So there is
the prospect of rate rises on both sides of the Atlantic as the relevant
authorities try to stem the pace of growth and inflationary
undercurrents.
The UK's recovery has mostly been export-led and if the money supply
data for January is an indication that retail spending is reverting back
to the subdued levels of October and November, this may restrict any
price increases which manufacturers have in the pipeline and keep the
lid on inflation. This possibility may tempt the Chancellor to look at a
few more numbers before he makes a decision.
It is the CBI survey, though, which is likely to have the most
influence with Mr Clarke and even more so with Mr George, who has
repeatedly stressed that inflation had to be stamped on early. There is
always the danger of course that certain areas of the economy will be
badly hit, particularly as there is no real sign that consumer
confidence generally has taken a sustained turn for the better.
The CBI survey and recent RPI data in particular point to a quick
hike. On the other hand the Building Employers' Confederation reported a
clear faltering in construction output in the fourth quarter of 1994.
And, according to a Goldman Sachs' economist, there is evidence that
several interest rate-sensitive areas of the economy actually began to
turn down in the final months of last year. This may reduce the
Chancellor's willingness to contemplate another base rate rise so soon
after the last two. The market, howwever, is not betting on it.
Interest rate worries at home and with an eye also across the Atlantic
hit equity markets which brushed aside the apparent strengthening of the
case for a deferral provided by the January money supply figures. The
FTSE-100 Index struggled to stay above the 3000 mark and closed 26.3
points down at 2995.9.

TWO elderly sisters, dubbed Britain's most wanted pensioners after
they went on the run nearly three years ago, were caught yesterday.
Winifred Bristow, 76, and Joan Payne, 74, disappeared from their home
in East Grinstead, Sussex, in May 1992.
They were finally traced to a rented cottage near Bury St Edmunds,
Suffolk, but there was no sign of Angela Dodge, their nephew's
girlfriend, who is believed to be the mastermind behind a string of
deceptions they left in their wake.
The pair set off on a tour of Britain and Ireland, allegedly leaving
behind them a string of forged cheques, bogus bank accounts and unpaid
bills amounting to thousands of pounds.
Detective Constable Barry Woodley, of New Milton police in Hampshire,
who has been in charge of the three-year hunt, said last night that the
sisters had been ''dumped'' by Mrs Dodge as she gave police the slip
again.
''She has ditched them and gone off with her daughter Kate. She will
probably go to ground and without the old ladies in tow, she will be
very difficult to find,'' he said.
Police said Mrs Dodge was wanted for alleged offences of fraud and
deception in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Avon, Somerset, Dorset and
Hampshire.

The cross fertilisation of technology skills and management strategies
is creating a new breed of graduate bound for company boardrooms.
Geraldine Abrahams reports.
MANY manufacturing companies in Scotland today are rich in personnel
with technologically-based qualifications and experience.
Despite their technological knowledge however, such people rarely have
much awareness of how the company itself operates and therefore seldom
achieve senior management positions within that company.
They tend to lack the kind of business skills which would allow them
to operate effectively in a multi-disciplinary team or to be involved in
strategic planning and decision making.
In an attempt to address this problem, Strategic Technology and
Management Programmes Ltd (STAMP) was established five years ago to
''transform technologists into technology strategists''.
The idea was to create a new breed of graduate, equipped with a sound
technology background but at the same time having the all-round ability
to become the managing director of the future.
''It was felt that there were plenty of qualified people in lower
management positions, but they did not, or could not, see the bigger
picture,'' said Jean McConnochie, administrator of STAMP. ''While the
manager of a design team might know and be very interested in the design
element of the work, he/she is unlikely to know anything about finance,
marketing and so on.''
STAMP, a non-profit-making body, is funded by the Government to
provide a Master of Technology Management (MTM) post-graduate degree
course which is designed to equip established engineers and scientists
with business skills.
Initially, seven companies from all over Scotland were approached,
since this was to be an industry-driven course. BAe-SEMA, John Brown
Engineering, Digital Equipment Corporation, GEC-Ferranti,
Hewlett-Packard, NCR and Weir Group, together with two technology and
business-oriented universities: Heriot Watt in Edinburgh and the
University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, all have representatives on the
Board of STAMP.
The organisation is financially supported by the Science and
Engineering Research Council, Scottish Enterprise, Dunbartonshire
Enterprise and the Glasgow Development Agency, and various European
bodies.
The degree curriculum and subject modules devised by the universities
in collaboration with the companies involved, look at the application of
technology to strategic areas of business and at ways where it can
create business opportunities and competitive advantage. Flexibility and
the response to changing markets and market conditions are also built
in.
There are 12 modules: 10 ''core'' and two ''elective'', and 12
assignments in total plus a final project. For the completion of 10
modules and assignments, a Diploma in Technology Management is awarded,
and there is likely to be a Certificate in Engineering Strategy for
those students who complete six of the modules. It is also possible to
take specific modules on an individual basis.
All of the founder companies put students on to the first intake of
the MTM degree course in September 1992, and those students are now
completing their last module. The course culminates this month in a
visit to the McDonnell-Douglas plant in the United States. They will
also go ''underground' at Disney, to see how it all works, and visit
several companies in America to examine their operations. Their final
assignment will be based on that visit.
The MTM course is practically based, with 85% of the marking on each
module based on the relevant assignment. When the students return to
their own workplaces, they have seven weeks to submit an assignment for
the module they have just completed.
The assignment is set up between a university lecturer and a key
person back at the plant. The project is designed to benefit the company
as well as the student, and allows the student to gain knowledge of the
company for which he/ she works.
While this is obviously a very attractive course, one of its major
drawbacks is cost. At #1100 a module, it is expensive and while this may
not be so much of a problem for larger companies, there is a need to
widen the net to encourage people from other types of company which
could benefit from this kind of training.
On a non-residential basis, the modules are much cheaper at #750, but
the organisers feel that the residential aspect is an important
''add-on'' factor of the course.
An additional problem for the smaller companies is the fact that the
student will be taken out of the workplace for lengthy period of time,
something which many cannot afford.
At the present time, there are very few alternatives to the MBA for
career-oriented people, especially for those working in the field of
technology. MTM appears to be an innovative and perhaps more relevant
option, similar to some industry-driven courses in the United States.
''People who are career minded in the USA are willing to spend the
money to get up the career ladder,'' said Jean McConnochie. ''They see
technology-based courses like this one as the thing of the future.''
Andrew Soulsby, eight years with Hewlett-Packard, had considered an
MBA, but felt that both the continuous assessment aspects of the new MTM
degree together with the week-long modules spread over 30 months, were
more suited to his needs.
Two years on, he considers that the programme has been successful for
him: ''It has forced me to think more objectively about different areas
of the company'' he said.
''I think I now have a better understanding of issues and problems
facing other sections, so my perspective in dealing with them is wider
and my attitudes probably fairer.
The contacts I've made inside the company and the discussion with
other course members have helped this broadening out process.''
Andrew has been promoted from Engineering Section Manager to
Production Manager since he started the course, a promotion which he
considers to be a direct result of his acquision of new skills.
Entry qualification for the MTM degree is generally at least a first
degree although that could be waived where here is evidence that the
candidate has a sound practical background in his/ her field. Most
candidates have between five and 10 years' experience.
For those people who do not meet the universities' criteria for
enrolment, the Senate may allow them to go onto the degree course on a
diploma basis and, should their marks prove to be high enough, at the
discretion of the Senate, they may be awa rded the degree.
The degree course, together with the associated Diploma and
Certificate courses, are now being openly marketed to those companies
searching for a more effective management of technology, and which have
suitably qualified staff.

BOOKMAKERS and bingo halls have launched a campaign to change the law
so they can advertise on TV against the National Lottery.
Betting shops also want the ban preventing them selling lottery
tickets lifted in order to attract more punters into their 10,000
outlets.
The Home Office last week allowed pools companies to advertise on TV
for the first time after the industry complained of losing out to the
lottery.
Now the major bookmaking firms of William Hill, Ladbroke, and Coral
have joined forces to get the same rule change for their industry.
The Bingo Association of Great Britain is also set to announce a
multi-million pound advertising drive in the hope of the rules changing.
Mr Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for William Hill, said: ''We have been
campaigning for years, but now we have the lottery and pools firms
allowed on TV.
''It is impossible to assess the impact of the lottery on our business
but we have to be apprehensive of a rival gambling industry.
''Accordingly, we feel a lot of our customers are playing the lottery.
We would happily sell them tickets from our shops but we are not allowed
to.''
The Bingo Association said it was ''up in arms'' that the advertising
ban had been lifted for pools companies but not their industry.
Spokeswoman Joanne Matt said: ''Bingo clubs provide safe and friendly
soft gaming where the amount a player can spend is limited. There is no
limit to what anyone can stake on the pools or the lottery and the odds
of winning on either of these are much lower than on bingo.''

A HOSPITAL last night denied that patients had been asked to take out
their stitches at home as a cost-cutting measure.
But it defended a procedure of asking some patients if they wanted to
remove their own stitches, and said about 300 a year chose to do so.
A row erupted after the disclosure that a woman in her 70s had a #5
DIY stitch removal kit sent to her home after treatment at Glasgow's
Stobhill hospital.
Scottish Health Minister Lord Fraser said the decision was one for the
hospital, but added that he was asking his advisors for a report on the
case.
The hospital said last night that it did not know the identity of the
woman, but she would have been one of its Hormone Replacement Therapy
patients, who have a small hormone implant inserted under the skin of
the stomach, held in place by a single stitch.
''Patients are asked if they wish to remove the stitch themselves or
attend their own doctor to have the stitch removed,'' it said.
Those who chose to do it themselves -- about 300 a year -- were given
a small pair of scissors to take home with them.
The hospital added: ''It was introduced to benefit patients and not as
a cost-cutting measure, as has been suggested.''

TWO Scottish life offices have been forced to follow the trend and cut
payouts on maturing with-profits endowment policies as a result of
subdued equity markets.
Standard Life and Scottish Provident payouts on typical 20-year
polices have been reduced by 6% and 2.6% respectively. A 20-year #30 a
month Standard Life policy taken out by a 30 year old man would mature
tomorrow with a value of #31,678, down from #33,700 a year ago. A
similar Scottish Provident policy would yield #30,563 against #31,372.
Both companies have maintained their annual reversionary bonuses,
which once delared cannot be reduced, but terminal bonuses were down.
Jim Stretton, Standard's chief executive of UK operations, pointed out
that reversionary bonus rates were significantly higher than most bank
and building society rates.
Net annual returns on maturing Standard Life policies equate to 13.2%
on 25-year policies and 10.5% on 10-year plans, which compare with
average annual inflation of 7.6% and 4.4% respectively. Scottish
Provident's equivalent returns were 12.5% and 10.2%.
The advantage of with-profits policies is that they smooth investment
performance so that the peaks and troughs are missed. So the effect of
poor performing equity and gilt markets over the past year will persist
for some time, even when the bear phase is over. Continuing low
inflation also means that bonus rates are unlikely to reach the high
levels seen in recent years.
There are now fears that some policies will not yield enough on
maturity to pay off the underlying mortgage, though only around a third
of such policies actually continue to maturity. The leading life offices
are generally not advising policyholders to increase their premiums but
they are keeping a wary eye on how policies are faring.

SCOTTISH industry believes there is a strong possibility of Labour
winning the next General Election and wants to ensure that companies'
needs are recognised before then, it was claimed yesterday.
Labour MPs John McFall and Mrs Helen Liddell, who recently formed a
''jobs taskforce'' as part of the Labour Party's plan to establish
closer links with Scottish businesses, said they believed firms
throughout Scotland were keen to hear about Labour's plans and to ensure
that Labour also knew of their concerns.
The two have just started a series of visits to companies throughout
Scotland during the next year to discuss matters such as Local
Enterprise Company (LEC) assistance and training.
Speaking during a visit to Caldervale Forge in Airdrie, Mrs Liddell,
who is the Labour MP for Monklands East and was chosen as a member of
the taskforce team because of her experience in industry, said:
''Companies recognise that there is a strong possibility that we will be
the next Government. Business is disenchanted with the Conservatives and
wants to be sure that we know exactly what they are looking for.''
''Our committment to a high-skilled, high-wage economy strikes a chord
with businesses. If you increase the skills you increase the value of
business and, if you increase wages you increase activity in the
economy.''
Mr McFall, who claimed Scotland has an insufficient skills base to be
ready for economic expansion, said he and Mrs Liddell would be
considering how satisfactorily LECs deliver their services to companies
such as Caldervale Forge.
''For companies such as this, which is very keen on the export market,
the main question is how the enterprise companies assist in the training
of individuals and in the preparation of export consideration.''
Mr McFall, who is Labour's employment and training spokesman, added
that a number of small businesses believed that the delivery of LEC
services could be improved and that the taskforce would make
recommendations to Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson when its
work was complete.
Caldervale Forge, which employs 29 people, makes breaker steels for
hydraulic hammers and exports about 70% of its manufacturing output.
Its managing director, Mr Neil Bairdwatson, welcomed the opportunity
to speak to the Labour MPs but said he could not criticise local
enterprise companies such as the Lanarkshire Development Agency.
However, he believed the Government could further assist small
companies seeking to expand by making it easier for them to borrow
money.
Company secretary John Ramsay added that, although he believes people
should be paid a ''good rate'' for the job they do, he is not in favour
of a national minimum wage because he fears such a policy would restrict
employment.

DAIRY farmers may be experiencing dyspepsia from the latest over-quota
production figures but it is more likely to be their herds that are
suffering physically from real acidosis or acid indigestion.
Feeding large amounts of highly-acidic fermented silage crops at this
time of year helps kill off the bugs in the animals' stomachs which
stimulate digestion and feed conversion for the production of milk and
maintenance of body condition.
''It is little wonder that the continued use in the UK of
highly-acidic grass silage as the staple diet of dairy cows causes the
stress-related problem we have and holds back milk yields from the
potential we so clearly have from improved genetics,'' according to Dr
Mike Tempest, head of animal research and development at Harper Adams
Agricultural College.
Grass silage is not the best winter feed for dairy cows. It leads to
acid overload and this in turn can lead to lower body condition, health
disorders and poor fertility, Dr Tempest told dairy farmers at a
conference in North-west England. This in turn led to increased culling.
Methods to overcome this included feeding a non-cereal based
concentrate supplement, such as beet pulp, or feeding alkaline preserved
feed crop material. In the latter case, this is usually achieved by
treating the harvested crops with chemicals such as sodium hydroxide
(caustic potash), ammonia and its compounds, or urea which converts to
ammonia.
All of these solutions have drawbacks, according to Dr Tempest, but
the problems could be minimised with the latter treatment provided the
application rates, normally around 4%, could be reduced by, for example,
an activating enzyme technique which enables ammonia to be produced on
contact with the moisture in the crop.
''The lower application rate ensures there is no residual urea/ammonia
remaining in the conserved crop which eradicates risk to livestock,
pollution and intake restrictions.''
Alan Sayle, technical development manager with Dugdales, the
Lancashire-based feed specialist which organised the conference, said
that recognition of the need for alkaline buffers had resulted in around
11,000 acres of the UK's whole crop cereals being conserved in an
alkaline condition. He claimed that 70% of this had been achieved using
the company's special activating enzyme technique.

FARMERS in Ayr expressed deep frustration yesterday over the lack of
success in putting their case for the export of calves to Europe for the
veal trade.
The Ayr executive of the National Farmers Union heard area president
John Scott warn that what was essentially a dairy problem could quickly
become a problem for the livestock sector as well.
He told the annual general meeting that many of the calves being
retained in this country because of the export problems would come to
market in about a year. This would depress the beef market, and reduce
returns for both finishers and primary producers.
UK farmers, he insisted, had the highest welfare standards in the
world. If the public was so concerned about animal welfare they should
be prepared to ''buy British'' every time.
Several speakers returned to the need for farmers' arguments, not just
on calves but on livestock rearing generally, to be better presented to
the public. People seemed to have forgotten that live animals were the
source of the meat they bought, plastic wrapped, from the supermarket.
Mr Henry Murdoch expressed concern that the vegetarian lobby appeared
to have ready access to schools, and it was agreed that the Meat and
Livestock Commission should be encouraged to maintain its own service to
schools so that children could at least have a balanced picture set
before them.
There was concern, too, that the farming lobby was losing out on
television. ''We must try to persuade television producers to give us
fair viewing,'' said Mr Ian Kerr, of Kilmarnock.
''The representation of farming on television seems to focus on the
most harrowing aspects.'' By contrast, on wildlife programmes the most
harrowing aspects were rarely shown, because there would be a public
outcry.
Mr Alan Parker, of Dalry, summed up the past year as a public
relations disaster for the farming industry.
''We are losing the argument by default,'' he said. ''If we do not
turn out for the fight we are never going to win the argument.''
In a motion submitted for discussion, the local Ayr branch adopted a
similar line, exhorting the NFU to be more vocal in countering the
''extreme and inaccurate claims'' being made regarding live exports.
Much of the film footage used by the animal rights lobbyists to show
animals being badly treated showed practices which were illegal in this
country, said Mr Daniel Reid.
NFU vice-president Mr Jim Wylie told the meeting that he appreciated
the enormous frustration felt at farm level at the dislocation of calf
exports, which was a legitimate trade.
He pointed out that the NFU had been instrumental in persuading their
European counterparts to consider a review of the veal calf trade. They
had also been in discussion with the Scottish Office over the
introduction of a calf processing policy if the market were to decline
to a level which justified it.
In an address to the executive, Mr Wylie expressed his unease at the
Government's willingness to introduce legislation which put the UK
industry at a disadvantage compared to other member states in the
European Union.
''We have an excessive desire to stick to the rules in the UK,'' he
said. ''That could be our downfall.''
The UK already had a bigger percentage set-aside than France. We
operated at a similar disadvantage in the veal calf sector, and from
1998 new restrictions on pig rearing systems would place an additional
#90m capital cost burden on the industry.
''We are becoming uncompetitive by continuing to have this sort of
legislation imposed upon us in the UK,'' he said.

OUR national bard was well and truly toasted at the weekend, all the
way from Alloway to Atlanta, Saltcoats to San Diego, Dennistoun to
Denver, Colorado, where I should have been on Saturday night.
But the schedule back home became so congested that I pulled out of
the American trip, which promised a memorable night. For Denver is the
home base of former Beirut hostage Tom Sutherland, who was proposing the
Immortal Memory to a gathering of expatriates, just as he had kept his
fellow prisoners engaged with the works of Robert Burns during their
years of captivity.
Three years ago Tom, son of a Falkirk farmer and once a Rangers
footballer, came to Scotland on release from his Lebanese hell-hole to
propose The Lassies in Glasgow.
Now, freshly back in America from the funeral of his sister in
Scotland, he was playing host to some of the artists he met on that
previous occasion, people like fiddling virtuoso Ian Powrie, operatic
singer Isobel Buchanan, and that master of Burns interpretation, Tom
Fleming.
Before they flew to Denver I had sampled their exquisite talents on
the home beat of Burns, marvelling once more at the theatrical power of
Fleming, who gave the classic performance of Tam o' Shanter, just as he
had raised the art of television commentary to new levels in November
with his memorable words from the Cenotaph.
I couldn't help smiling at an overheard remark about Tom's style of
standing with large open book in hand, a prop which adds dignity to his
performance.
''I can dae Tam o' Shanter withoot lookin','' said this poor chap. I
bet he can. Folk with good memories are ten-a-penny. But where do you
find another Tom Fleming?
So I went on the circuit and heard the authentic sound of Burns from
voices like Linda Ormiston and Ayrshire's Jim Nicol. I heard the
outrageous humour of Duncan Cameron, Scottish boss of American Airlines,
and another electrifying performance of Tam o' Shanter from television's
Alex Monteath, better known as Dougal, who took us on the High Road to
that bleezin' Kirk o' Alloway and back again with as much fire and
terror as Burns could ever have imagined.
Oh, and I heard that layer of loutish loudmouths who talk through
speakers and singers alike and whose diverting presence is by no means
exclusive to Burns suppers. This shower of show-offs appear to be
everywhere today, none the better for being dressed up in dinner suits,
which merely accentuate their lack of manners.
Mercifully, in facing a thousand people at the biggest Burns supper in
the world (West Sound Radio of Ayr) I got away with the Immortal Memory
unscathed.
That same occasion also produced what was, for me, the richest moment
of the season. It came with the presence of Buff Hardie from Aberdeen,
with whom I first appeared in our school play nearly 50 years ago. But
as my academic career petered out at 14, the brilliant Buff went on to
glory, first at Aberdeen University and then at Cambridge, where he read
law.
With native modesty, he submitted a sample of his humour to the
much-publicised Cambridge Footlights, where names like Jonathan Miller
were the flavour of the time. But Hardie's submissions were not even
acknowledged. I suspect if his roots had been closer to Watford he would
have been hailed with the rising stars of his generation.
Instead, Buff returned to Aberdeen, became chief executive of Grampian
Health Board and emerged as the writing brain behind a revue group which
included Aberdeen lawyer Steve Robertson and Perth Academy deputy rector
George Donald.
Poking gentle fun at the breast-beating Scotland the Brave, they
called themselves Scotland the What?, becoming so popular that they
eventually gave up lucrative careers to go full-time. Now, after 25
years, they are on their farewell tour of Scotland, due in Glasgow in
September and finishing up at His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen.
Curiously, there are still people in Scotland unfamiliar with the
talents of Buff Hardie but last week's audience rightly acclaimed him as
a comic genius. Proposing The Lassies, he was at his brilliant best, a
talent which must not be lost for ever.
Solemn-faced and quizzical, he was much as I remembered him when we
were 12. A poignant experience indeed -- on one of Glasgow's greatest
social nights.
* Success Note: My appeal for relatives of a young Glasgow airman, Sgt
William Cowan, shot down and buried in France in 1944, brought instant
response. His old pal Tommy Jenkins from Maryhill recognised the name
and RAF number and contacted the family.
William Cowan was brought up in Cedar Street, St George's Cross, an
only son with four older sisters. Three of them are still alive -- Mrs
Anne King and Mrs Ina Currie of Milton, and Miss Peggy Cowan of
Dennistoun.
Though they have never been to the cemetery, near Massay, they have
pictures of his grave and have kept alive the memory of their beloved
brother, whose death was such a devastation. Now the Mayor of Massay
will be inviting them to a memorial ceremony in March.
Incredibly, another Herald reader, Jimmy Stewart from
Grantown-on-Spey, writes to say he was the pilot who ''marked'' the
target that night. His plane damaged, with part of the canopy gone, he
managed to hirple back to Lincolnshire.

ROYAL Bank of Scotland has fought off fierce competition from US banks
to become custodian of #7000m worth of assets handled by a leading UK
fund manager, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The Royal was yesterday awarded what is one of the largest custody
mandates in recent years by Henderson Administration Group, which
manages the assets for institutions, investment trusts, pension funds
and retail funds.
Henderson's ''outsourcing'' reflects a current trend among
institutions to farm out administrative work in the run-up to the
implementation of the Crest settlement system in the Stock Exchange.
Requiring substantial technological investment, Crest will eventually
develop from the current 10-day rolling share settlement period into a
five-day period in June.
As custodian, Royal Bank will hold share certificates, settle
transactions and collect dividends. It will also be involved in stock
lending, with market-makers able to borrow stock from another party to
meet their obligations. The transfer of the assets to Royal Bank will
take place between February 18 and March 3.
Michael Devine, director of securities services, would not disclose
the impact of the deal on turnover or profit. He said: ''We are
delighted that Henderson selected the Royal Bank in the face of stiff
competition. I believe this reflects our ability to provide leading
institutional investors with the level of service they require in
today's competitive market.''
Global custody is one of three businesses which make up securities
services, a key operation within Royal Bank's corporate and
institutional banking division.
One of the other two, registrars, became the second-biggest UK
operation of its kind when it acquired NatWest's registrars business in
September for an undisclosed sum.

Fay Medlock Paton is probably correct in stating that Ninian came to
Whithorn before Columba came to Iona (in AD 563), but there is no
evidence to support the date ''c AD 400''.
This is first put forward in a twelfth-century saint's life which is
largely mythological and which did not have access to any chronological
data more precise than Bede's statement (made c 732) that Ninian was
active ''a long time before'' Columba.
Bede was necessarily vague because he did not have access to any
chronological data either.
Contemporaneity with St Martin of Tours (d 397) is fancifully
suggested by the dedication of Whithorn to St Martin, but the outreach
of the cult of St Martin is a phenomenon of the sixth rather than of the
fifth century; it reached Rome c 500.
Literary and historical evidence suggests that Ninian was probably a
sixth-century figure; the archeological record at Whithorn and in the
Pictish lands is increasingly pointing in the same direction.
Hopefully we will soon be able to consign to the historical rubbish
tip the idea that Ninian was active c 400. Then we will be able to
formulate a picture of the origins of Christianity in Scotland that
actually makes sense.

A BIAS towards UK smaller companies has helped St Andrew Trust, run by
fund managers Martin Currie, escape the worst of the fate that befell
many investment trusts last year.
The #107m trust saw its net asset value per share fall 3.7% to 312.7p
in the calendar year compared to a near-10% fall in the benchmark FT-All
Share index.
However, earnings per share rose 6.8% to 8.34p as gross revenue jumped
#200,000 to #2.7m, allowing the directors to recommend a final dividend
of 5.4p. When added to the 2.8p already paid, this gives shareholders an
inflation-beating 5.1% increase to 8.2p for the year.
Almost 70% of the trust's portfolio is invested in the UK and the
emphasis on smaller companies, which generally outperformed their bigger
cousins, boosted earnings more than would have been expected otherwise.
Macfarlane and Hewden Stuart are two of the companies that helped the
trust maintain a reasonable level of total return.
Though the Kobe earthquake will probably take the shine off St
Andrew's Japanese exposure -- 6% of the total -- this year, 1994 saw a
17% return from the Tokyo-based portfolio.
Aside from the UK and Japan, Continental Europe (7%), Pacific Basin
(6%), and the US (4%) took up most of the remaining assets. About 8% was
held in overseas bonds and cash.
Pre-tax revenue was virtually unchanged at #3.6m and #47,000 was
transferred to the revenue reserve against #3000 previously.
''The outlook for equity markets worldwide is reasonably positive and
we believe that sound, smaller companies will continue to perform well
where there is an environment of sustained economic growth,'' chairman
David Ross Stewart said yesterday.
* EUROPEAN Assets Trust, advised by Edinburgh's Ivory &amp; Sime and
largely denominated in Dutch guilders, reported a 6.1% fall to 330p in
net asset value per share last year in a stagnant year for European
equities.
The investment trust, which specialises in Continental Europe,
declared a final dividend of Dfl0.08, to make a total of Dfl0.16,
unchanged from the previous year.

THE disclosure that Allied Domecq is in talks to sell its Continental
European bakery operations to the Continental Bakeries' venture capital
group did nothing to slow the continuing share weakness caused by
concern over the Mexican peso.
If the shares slide continues for much longer, then it seems
inevitable that takeover bid rumours will begin again for the
Ballantine's scotch, Beefeater gin and Baskin-Robbins ice-cream group.
Hanson is one of the most obvious bidders given that it has let it be
known that it has had a careful look at the then Allied-Lyons before it
spent #739m on acquiring Domecq of Spain -- a move which propelled
Allied into second position behind Grand Metropolitan's IDV subsidiary
in the global spirits league the drinks and fast-food retailing group.
The conglomerate's annual meeting tomorrow promises to be the usual
love-in between Lords Hanson and White and the congratulatory questions
of selected shareholders.
Since Allied's interim results on November 24, the shares have
declined 66p to 509p, including yesterday's 6p setback, as concern
continued that the US Congress would not approve the $40bn loan
guarantees to Mexico. Sentiment was also marginally affected by the
outbreak of hostilities between Peru and Ecuador.
The results presentation at the time was a pretty miserable affair
with chairman Michael Jackaman warning that Mexican volume sales of
Domecq products, very largely brandy where it has an 80% market share,
were down by up to 10%.
Since late November, the currency has halved to around 6.5 pesos to
the pound with there being a sharp fall last night after reports that
Mexico's foreign reserves had fallen to just $2000m and creating a huge
demand internally for dollars as a hedge against any further
deterioration.
Allied had said that just 5% of trading profits on an annualised basis
come from Mexico. So there will be a reduction of perhaps #30m for the
current 12-month period to February.
However, there is the complication that the current six months
traditionally accounts for the greater proportion of Domecq's Mexican
sales and so the impact could in fact be more severe with Mexican
consumers most likely cutting down as import prices soar.
It now looks as if Allied's full-year profits will now increase just
#100m to about #695m and over #20m below earlier expectations. But on
the basis of an increase in the dividend of 8% to 24p, the yield becomes
an attractive and fairly supportive 5.9%.

Given that The Herald justifiably claims to be Scotland's newspaper,
it is surprising that in your readers' survey Scottish readers can live

Your report that the game angling code was produced by the Salmon and
Trout Association is to understate the importance of that document
(January 17).
In fact the very first meeting that ultimately led to the production
of the game angling code was held between the Scottish Anglers National
Association and the Salmon and Trout Association in Glasgow.
Any document composed to regulate a sport or activity must be endorsed
by all the organisations representing that sport otherwise its content
will be seen as an imposition and its power to influence will be lost.
That is why 17 such organisations contributed to the wording of the
code and are named as having prepared and produced it, the Scottish
Anglers National Association and the Salmon and Trout Association among
them.

The attendance at Murrayfield on Saturday, January 21, for the
Scotland v Canada game was poor when compared with Five Nations'
championship games. This was sad, as Scotland needed all the support it
could get in its attempt to end the run of nine games without victory.
Was this lack of support connected with ticket prices, the weather, or
are present-day supporters only interested in the glamour games?
Mention of admission prices gives me the opportunity to commend the
Glasgow District Rugby Union as admission was free to schoolboys and
senior citizens at the Glasgow v North and Midlands and Scotland ''A'' v
France ''A'' games in Glasgow in December and January.
A charge for admission would not have prevented me from attending
these games but nevertheless thanks to the GDRU's consideration I was
one of those who benefited.

Perhaps those who are so sceptical about the proposed return to
service of the Maid of the Loch should look to Europe, where a number of
similar projects have been successfully carried out in recent years.
At Dresden, eight Elbe paddle steamers, all but one dating from the
last century and one with an engine originally made in Britain in 1841,
albeit much altered since then, have been totally refurbished over the
past two years. Ownership is with a company 51% owned by the Saxony
Provincial Government and 49% by a Hamburg container-ship operator. Such
is the popularity of the steamers that for the first time for decades,
winter services have operated.
Nearby at Meissen, the similar steamer Krippen, which had got into a
far worse state than the Maid of the Loch, now serves as a floating
restaurant when not operating cruises, something sadly that restrictive
planning regulations would in all possibility prohibit with the Maid of
the Loch.
In Switzerland, the Lake Thun paddle steamer Blumlisalp came back into
service in 1992 after 25 years. Eventually Swiss democracy helped her by
means of referendums, in the canton of Berne first, as to whether to use
public funds to help restore her, and then as to whether to underwrite
possible losses in her operating costs against those of a modern motor
vessel. She is owned by a preservation group, but operated by the
Bern-Lotschberg-Simplon railway, operating in conjunction with the other
motorships on the lake.
Stockholm's Mariefred, a screw steamer which has operated on the same
route since building in 1903, was seriously damaged by fire in May last
year, but the damage was repaired within six weeks in time for the
opening of her summer season.
Elsewhere in Sweden around half a dozen small steamers, mainly dating
from the 1870s, have returned to service in the past couple of years,
all preserved and brought back from dereliction by local groups which
see the steamer as an essential part of local history.
Somewhere among these many examples there must be a pattern that can
be copied for the Maid of the Loch. The possibilities are many and
varied, but the work of restoration must be accomplished first, and
there must be a willingness to explore every avenue of possible
financial help to enable the work to be carried out.

CURRENCY dealers were reluctant to trade heavily ahead of the US FOMC
meeting which could sanction a half-point rise in US interest rates
today.
The dollar is expected to come under serious downward pressure if
rates are not raised.
The French franc continued to hover around the 14-month lows seen on
Friday, on the back of political worries ahead of a two-round French
Presidential election in April and May.
Fresh corruption allegations against a member of the ruling RPR party
contributed to the franc's sharp fall against the German mark last
Friday. The Italian lira was steady ahead of a confidence vote on the
new government of Lamberto Dini.
Thursday's Bundesbank meeting is also being closely monitored for
signs of a change in German money market rates.
Meanwhile sterling was mixed as dealers continued to speculate on the
timing of a rise in UK interest rates. Against the mark it was over a
pfennig cheaper at DM2.3961 but against the dollar it was over
half-a-cent better at $1.5889. Sterling's trade-weighted index fell by
0.1 to 79.9.

HIGHER passenger numbers passing through BAA's airports are continuing
to drive its profits forward, with the third quarter showing a 14.5%
advance.
Pre-tax profits for the nine months to December were 12% ahead at
#328m. Passengers numbers were 8.6% up in the third quarter and over the
nine months by 7.4% to 69,300,000. For its full year to next March, the
group forecasts 7% growth.
The two main Scottish airports of Glasgow and Edinburgh are showing
the strongest growth of BAA's airports except for the relatively new
Stansted which is still building up its passenger base. In the nine
months to December, Glasgow and Edinburgh were about 9.5% ahead at
4,513,000 and 2,363,000 respectively. Aberdeen was almost 6% below the
comparable period.
BAA chief executive Sir John Egan said they expected traffic to carry
on growing strongly this year as the economic recovery continued.
Revenue from airport charges is capped but was still almost 7% ahead at
#336m. BAA is as much a retailer as an airport operator and revenue from
shop concessions rose nearly 10% to #402m despite building work in many
terminals.
BAA is in the middle of a major capital spending programme to upgrade
facilities and there was a #71m cash outflow in the nine months as
capital spending built up to #307m from #175m.
The projects include the Heathrow Express rail link under
construction, which suffered a blow from the partial collapse of a
tunnel. The group does not expect to suffer any significant loss as a
result. Property is another source of income for the group, rising by
#8m to #119m, reflecting new facilities such as the Compass Centre for
British Airways at Heathrow. The group is aiming to expand its
portfolio.
The accounts show capitalised interest of #34.7m against #21.7m though
gearing remains modest at just below 30%. Much of the terminal
redevelopment work is expected to be completed by the autumn. The second
phase of the Glasgow expansion was finished last year.
Profits in BAA's final quarter are likely to continue their steady
uptrend leading to a full-year figure of around #360m against #322m. The
shares slipped 5p to 460p.

SHARES in the ACT computer software and services group fell by 25% at
one stage to 69p before recovering partially to close 18p off at 74p
after a profits warning.
Managing director Mike Hart and Paul Newton, managing director of ACT
International, are also leaving the company as part of a boardroom
shake-up and some 60 redundancies in the Birmingham-based group.
The trading problems have arisen in the ACT Financial Systems
subsidiary in the UK due to delays in new products and disappointing new
business.
Redundancy and other non-recurring costs of approximately #3m will
result in the group pre-tax profits for the year to March being
significantly short of market expectations. But it is intended to
maintain the dividend payout at 5.25p per share.
Market estimates were rapidly dropped from pre-tax profits of #26m to
around #15m.
The boardroom changes see Kieran Nagle, currently managing director of
ACT Banking Systems, moving up to group chief executive, and
non-executive director Lindsay Bury taking on the role of deputy
chairman.

I sympathise with June Steel on the lack of supply teaching for her
daughter (January 20). Having been a supply teacher in the Strathclyde
region for the past 15 years I was offered a total of just
one-and-a-half days in the whole of the last term.
I happily accepted the situation in the belief that available teaching
possibilities were being offered to freshly qualified teachers needing
to become established in the profession.
That does not appear to be the case since it is the region's policy to
include newly-retired teachers on the supply list whose motivation may
be little more than to top up their pension.
I believe that any vacancies should always be preferentially offered
to tomorrow's teachers -- like her daughter.

Tokyo, Monday -- The Nikkei Stock Average surged on the back of stocks
related to the rebuilding of the earthquake-devastated city of Kobe.
The key index rose 648.53 points to 18,752.88, while the Tokyo Stock
Price index of all issues listed on the first section gained 53.63 to
1466.46.
In early afternoon, the Stock Exchange suspended trading in futures
and options contracts on the Topix index for 15 minutes because of the
rapid climb in prices of those contracts. It was the first time that
trading in the index contracts was ever halted.
Traders said individual investors who had sold a week ago bought back
on credit, especially construction stocks.
* Hong Kong -- Share prices finished higher in an abbreviated session
on the eve of the three-day Chinese New Year holidays.
The Hang Seng index rose 45.53 points to 7342.65.
* Frankfurt -- German stocks closed floor trading fractionally higher,
still hemmed into a narrow range before the US Federal Reserve's policy
meeting tomrrow.
The 30-share DAX index edged up 3.33 to 2035.03 points after trading
in a narrow ten-point range.

Unlike John McMillan (January 20) I don't see that it is necessary to
change to European time, forcing five year olds to be at school an hour
before daybreak just for the convenience of the business community.
Do our dynamic self-starters who do business with Europe lack the
initiative to get up an hour earlier (and beat the rush-hour traffic)?

Robin Cook is to be congratulated on his excellent article on why
Clause 4 must be changed and the aims of the Labour Party made fuller
and richer (January 26). Do the party's conservatives really wish to
retain a dogma which commits a modern democratic socialist party to
total common ownership? Even Militant only want to nationalise the top
200 companies. If, as Tony Blair says, we are to say what we mean and
mean what we say, Clause 4 must go.
The nature of Robin Cook's contribution to the debate is as important
as its substance. There is no posturing, no arrogance, no macho
breast-beating, but a dispassionate and sensible reading of the argument
and an admission that he had formerly been mistaken.
Most politicians will never admit to being wrong, and recent events
have made some more famous for dubious trips abroad than for their
principles.
In contrast, Robin Cook's and Tony Blair's integrity and honesty will
rightly command growing respect from the public. Others with bigger egos
and smaller minds would do well to follow their lead.

TRAFALGAR House, which so far has run a surprisingly low-key campaign
in its #1200m hostile bid for Northern Electric, yesterday chastised its
prey for what it calls its indifferent cost control, writes ANDREW
WILSON.
It also claimed that there had been relatively high tariff increases
for domestic customers.
In these areas Northern had been a poor performer compared with the
average for the regional electricity companies in England and Wales.
More to the point, Trafalgar chief executive Nigel Rich has attacked
Northern's call for the offer to be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
He said in a letter to shareholders that for all Northern's
protestations about shareholder value, it has spent a great deal of
effort trying to prevent them from having a proper opportunity to
consider the bid.
However, until President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine
decides whether to refer the bid, there is an element of phoney warfare.
The indications are that the market believes there will be a reference
as Northern shares eased further yesterday by 7p to 966p compared with
the Trafalgar offer of 1048p.
Certainly the Northern rebuttal of the Trafalgar arguments were
constrained, predictably pointing out that Trafalgar does not understand
its business.

We should be used to the cynicism and outright dishonesty of
Government Ministers but the remarks of Kenneth Clarke on the subject of
obscene salaries in monopoly public services really take the biscuit.
He claims that the control of these salaries rests entirely with the
shareholders. Clearly he thinks we are so stupid as not to know that the
salaries are determined by small groups of privileged appointees in the
companies whose own remuneration depends sensitively on the level of
salary of the chief executive.
Obviously he also thinks we are so dumb as not to know that the only
shareholders in these companies who have any clout are, first, the
Chancellor himself; secondly, the bosses of the banks; and thirdly, the
bosses of the pension funds.
All of these, without exception, have a powerful vested interest in
ensuring that the highest levels are attained because either their own
current salaries are heavily influenced by the general level of top
salaries or, alternatively, they are safeguarding their own future when
they hope to inherit one of these goldmines.

COUPLES: In the second of a weekly series, Anvar Khan tells how a
young German POW found success in Scotland and love in his homeland
DURING the Second World War, while American and British soldiers dug
in after making a beach landing in Southern Italy, their scouts drove
towards Rome. The troops reported back that the city was undefended, but
the commanders of the British and American invasion force decided it was
more important to establish a beachhead at Salerno.
Meanwhile, in December 1943, Paul Lippock, a 17-year-old postie from
Silesia in East Germany, was called up, thrown into uniform and after
some brief training was sent to Rome to reinforce the city against
attack. Within two months he found himself a prisoner of war and shipped
to Virginia, America. The date was June 4. He had spent only three weeks
in Italy.
Lippock was eventually shipped to a Scottish camp run by the Black
Watch, part of the 51st Highland Division, in Comrie. If Lippock had not
been captured, his life, and that of his wife, would have been of a much
poorer quality.
The war did them a favour. It brought them together. She was a sales
assistant with relatives to support. He was an inexperienced soldier. A
paratrooper who never made a parachute descent save a few practice jumps
from scaffolding.
In Virginia, German prisoners of war received ripe peaches and
generous portions of Virginia ham plus $2 pocket money per day. In
Comrie, each soldier was assigned farmwork and #1.10 per week. It was at
this point, Lippock remembered, that he learned it wasn't so much the
Germans the Scots minded as the Sassenachs.
''We were waiting for you lot to invade England,'' they gruffed upon
his arrival, ''so we could come down and help.'' Lippock made butter,
milked cows, and mended fences. He was demobbed in September, 1947.
''The farm on which I worked was owned by a brother and sister,'' he
said. ''The brother was an invalid and his sister stayed at home to look
after him. She never married. When the war ended I became their
employee. But I was just like a son to them.'' His own parents, brother,
and sister remained in Silesia, but at the end of the war Lippock
decided not to return.
''I didn't know whether my family were alive. I could have gone to
West Germany, but local people would have got any jobs first. I would
also have to have lived in a camp.''
Then the unexpected happened; the wage slave became an employer. When
the owners of the farm, his surrogate parents, died, they left him land.
This gave him something to build on, so to speak. He mastered
construction, and eventually set up a lucrative business, and built the
house he lives in with his wife in Tain, today.
During the war, many people struck up friendships; some by-passed each
other, only to be reunited at a later date, to gasp in amazement at how
an insignificant circumstance kept them apart.
The champion amateur cyclist Ackie Ross, a member of the 51st Highland
Division, was captured in 1940 and detained in a German camp. When he
returned to Ross-shire he was introduced to Lippock who revealed his
East German origins. ''Where, where exactly?'' badgered Ross. He learned
that he had been a prisoner of war for four years in a camp only 12
miles from Lippock's home. When Lippock cycled over to his aunt's, he
used to look out from the upstairs window and watch the prisoners march
up and down. Ross was one of them. ''We were lost comrades,'' said
Lippock.
Ross played the accordion, and Lippock, egged on by his Scottish
friends, taught himself to play it too. He became a dab hand at country
music, it being not dissimilar to the polka and the waltz. The Tain
Scottish Dance Band ended up being auditioned for the BBC in 1953. But
Lippock left. Something in his life was missing.
He turned to a German priest in Bradford responsible for the
German-speaking Catholic community in Britain. The priest always carried
a newspaper published in Germany called Mann In Der Zeit (Man Of The
Times). The lonely hearts column was compulsive reading for the
displaced. ''For some reason,'' said Lippock, ''I thought 'I'll have a
look at this and see if anything appeals'.'' It was Lippock's
introduction to his future wife.
Ehrentraut Lippock was born in Silesia. In 1946 she and her family,
like 20,000 others, were marched out and ended up in Hamelin, West
Germany. ''My father had lost his farm in Silesia. He had to go and beg
for food for us and work in menial jobs. My mother went out every day
and cleaned.''
Ehrentraut was lucky. She got a job as a sales assistant in a boys'
and gent's outfitters. She was sent home after Christmas because the
staff caught laryngitis. ''My father suddenly said: 'Don't you think it
is time, that you got a husband?' We had a very short childhood in those
days.
''We were Roman Catholics and Hamelin was a Protestant part of West
Germany. We all liked each other, but we came as nobodies. We were not
like Paul, we were not prisoners of war, but we had nothing on our backs
and we were suddenly put into people's homes. It wasn't easy to
integrate. When we looked for someone to get married to, we wanted
someone who shared our own beliefs.''
Her father showed her a copy of Mann In Der Zeit, which he had bought
in church. Ehrentraut and her friend placed an ad in the lonely hearts
column. Two girls, aged 20, dark, from Silesia. The year was 1954. They
received 46 letters.
''I was 20. I had never fallen in love and I got a letter from a man
in Scotland. He said he had a holiday coming up and could he meet me? He
said he was coming by train. He told me he had a car, but his band might
need it. I went to the station on a Saturday in October, 1954, three
times to pick him up. It was raining and I had an umbrella. I wasn't
going to look for him again. I turned the corner coming from the station
and there was a car standing in front of the house. Paul said 'Hello
Fraulein' and wanted to kiss me.''
Lippock had written to Ehrentraut twice a week for over two months in
green ink. He prayed that she would cotton on to the fact it was the
colour of hope. He discovered they loved freedom, God and Silesia.
Lippock made the decison of marrying someone with the same dislocated
roots; not a Scot, but a woman who had been as uprooted by the war as
himself. He wanted to provide another person with a chance of a better
life in a better country, the same chance he had been given by two, kind
Scots, who thought enough of the young German lad to leave him their
land.
Ehrentraut had sent Lippock one photo before they met. ''Fruit was
very rare in those days,'' she said as she shows me the portrait, in
which she holds up the core of a pear to the camera. The allusion to
religious symbolism, however subconscious, wasn't lost on Lippock.
''She had already bitten into it,'' he smiled.

Behind the Veil (January 23) failed to mention a more widespread abuse
of women's rights in Egypt. Female circumcision (genital mutilation) has
been carried out on more than 60% of Egyptian women and is still a legal
practice to this day.
I believe this fact should have been included in your article as the
rape of the women described would have been more physically painful than
normal. The prevalence of this operation also gives a good insight into
the attitude of Egyptian society to its women.
The operation is carried out on most girls at the age of 10 and in
almost all cases without an anaesthetic. I hope more can be done to
consign this practice to the history books.

SCOTS playwright Rona Munro is no stranger to fame. Well, relative
fame like winning the Pharic McLaren award for her radio play Watching
Waiters and the Giles Cooper award for another radio play The Dirt Under
the Carpet. Not to mention a drama prize from Thames Television and the
four awards for the Ken Loach film Ladybird, Ladybird for which Rona
wrote the script.
Now the Aberdeen-born writer has received an accolade from the Higher
English Examination Board. Her play Bold Girls has just knocked Arthur
Miller's Death of a Salesman off the list of recommended works for
Scottish pupils.
First produced five years ago during Glasgow's reign as European city
of culture, Bold Girls went on to win the Susan Smith Blackburn award
for the best new play in London in 1991. More importantly the play, a
tale of women's resilience in the dark days of the Troubles in Belfast,
remains on the repertoire of Scottish theatre companies.
Strathclyde Theatre Group has a production opening a week tomorrow,
followed in rapid order by a separate version in Dundee.
Rona is keeping very level-headed about the accolade from the Higher
English Examining Board. She will try not to let it change her life.
She is currently living in London and has just finished a play for
Hampstead Theatre. It is called The Maiden Stone and is about travelling
people in Aberdeenshire in the last century.
Much of the dialogue is in the Doric. Which you might have thought
would be a bit of a problem for your average London theatregoer. But no,
says Rona, she has hit the Hampstead folk with dauds of Doric before and
they appear to ken fit's guan on, min.
Simpler minds
THE ITV Chart Show (we never miss it of a Saturday lunchtime) has a
quiz question before and after commercial breaks. To coincide with a
showing of the latest Simple Minds video, they asked: ''What team does
Jim Kerr support?'' And to make it easier for those who might not be
aware of the crooner's footballing persuasion, they offered the choice
of ''Glasgow Rangers or Celtic Rangers''.
After the break we were informed that Mr Kerr supports Celtic Rangers.
Wrong, of course. His fave team is, of course, Celtic Rangers Thistle
Clyde.
Command
performance
DETAILS of the Burnsian joust between Labour MP Dennis Canavan and
Scots Secretary Ian Lang have been retailed to the highest levels in the
land. After the debate, in which Canavan and Lang traded poetic insults,
the Labour MP was approached by Tory Whip Sydney Brookes.
Could Dennis supply him with the full text of his wee poem in which
the Scottish Tory Front Bench had been characterised as a parcel of
rogues in a nation. ''Oh, good,'' beamed Sydney when Dennis duly
obliged. ''She will be pleased.''
The She in question, it transpired, was none other than HM the Queen.
In his capacity as Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household, Sydney has
to write a report on the highlights of each day in Parliament for the
Queen's perusal. ''She does so appreciate a spot of light relief,''
added Sydney.
We wonder what Her Majesty made of Mr Lang's description of Mr Canavan
as ''a rhyming, ranting, raving billie'' and the greeting: ''Lang may
your elbuck juke and diddle.''
Miss Lamb scotched
THE irresistible tide of political correctness has swept away another
totally unacceptable aspect of man's shameless exploitation of woman.
The Miss Scotch Lamb beauty contest is no more.
Announcing the demise of the event after 25 years, Mr Brian Simpson,
chief executive of the Scottish Quality Beef and Lamb Association, said
he had taken ''stick'' for running what many people considered an
''outdated, glorified beauty contest''. The critics could have added
that it was all a bit of a meat market.
When Kaye Gardiner, a comely young farmerette from Lesmagahow, demits
office in April, Miss Scotch Lamb will be no more. The lamb association
says that the publicity initiative will be maintained.
The good news for the sheep themselves is that they will not be
involved in any beauty contest, no matter how popular such an event
might have proved in the Furryboot regions. The bad news is that the
catwalk has been replaced by the casserole. The beauty contest has been
replaced by a cooking competition for young people of the farming
persuasion.
Movie madness
WE are indebted to Flicks, a magazine free at a cinema near you, for
the reason behind the change of title of the film of Alan Bennett's
stage play The Madness of George III for foreign moviegoers. It is now
called The Madness of King George. It was feared Americans would ignore
the film, having failed to catch parts one and two.

THE conundrum at Bullough is whether the office furniture activities
will reach their target of a 10% return on sales within two years as
indicated yesterday by chief executive Gordon Bond, writes ANDREW
WILSON.
Given that the division turns over in excess of #90m annually, it will
be the main contributor for substantial organic growth for a company
which is much on the mend.
In the year to October, Bullough increased pre-tax profits by #9.8m to
#17.6m of which office furniture brought in just #1.4m -- the 1993 year
was hit by #4.7m of restructuring costs.
The UK is now improving and benefiting from new product lines such as
Options 3000 as well as stabilisation of the French operations.
A lot of money has been poured into the activity for designs and
machinery as well as changes to the sales organisation and it will take
some time yet to find out whether it will come up to expectations.
There were good results from the three other divisions with
refrigeration increasing market share where it is already the largest UK
player and with a good improvement in margins.
This is a sector where Mr Bond sees scope for acquisitions --
something which can be easily afforded with gearing just 22% and the
company's shares well rated, selling at 16 times historic earnings.
Heating is being helped by the #14.7m Trianco acquisition last year,
while the domestic oil boiler business is holding its own against the
gas equivalent on grounds of economy.
Engineering is being helped by a third of divisional turnover of #51m
being exported, particularly small electrical motors and
auto-components.
Bullough's profits bottomed in 1992 at #6m compared with over #28m
three years earlier. This time round, they could reach #24m to leave the
stock at 154p selling at 11.7 times earnings.
The dividend total has been held at 6.05p for a 4.9% yield.

Three years ago Andre Agassi was voted one of the 10 sexiest men of
all time. Now that image has been left on his hairdresser's floor.
Penelope Smith examines the reasons behind the new look
ANDRE Agassi is, to all intents and purposes, a woman, because he has
a fixation with his hair. To the fairer sex, a hairstyle is a reflection
of inner strength or turmoil. An emotional barometer. This rule applies
to the half-Iranian tennis champ who, in 1994, became the first unseeded
American to win the US Open for 28 years.
His image is nebulous, more to do with the demands of his current
romantic partner, than an extension of a consistent and level-headed
personality. Andre Agassi loves women and women love him.
In 1992 he was voted one of the 10 sexiest men of all time. This
should be no mean feat. But it was probably his most simple achievement,
gained, as it was, by a hangover from his pubescence, if he was ever
allowed to have one. An enjoyment of the ability to shock.
The Wimbledon audience are the tamest of spirits. Stunning them into
silence is like offending your auntie, easy and hardly gratifying.
Strutting into Number One Court in a clash of fluorescents, an earring,
and a mass of long, Euro-hippy hair, was enough to render Agassi one of
the bad boys, a more streetwise version of McEnroe and Connors.
In July 1991, for example, the papers reported that Wimbledon was
''startled'' by the vision of Agassi turning up to play Richard Krajicek
of Holland wearing wrap-around sunglasses. But his off-court perspective
isn't as sharp as his volley.
Las Vegas-born Agassi, 24, a born-again Christian, returns as his
furry self, to his childhood sweetie, Wendy Stewart, as often as Elvis
sang Return to Sender in the bars of the champ's home town. They last
split, after his Wimbledon win in 1992, blaming the separation on the
pressures of fame.
Agassi then dated Barbra Streisand who disliked his hairy chest so
much he waxed it all off to please her. It is women who usually change
themselves to suit the taste of their man, not the other way around.
Agassi was to tennis what Nigel Kennedy was to classical music, a dead
cert in attracting the attention of the younger market. But not now.
Agassi is currently dating Brooke Shields, a star au fait with the
shameless prostitution of whatever society regards at the time, of being
desirable; youth, education, virginity.
To embark upon life, brooking, as it were, so little self-expression,
results in a desire to control. Agassi recently cut off all his hair;
the blond, beach-bum, locks which so endeared him to the world's women.
Most of whom are probably not as sexually inexperienced as his
over-protected girlfriend, and therefore more tolerant of a lazy,
sensual look.
Anyone who shaves off their hair is, as priests, soldiers, or
prisoners will tell you, committing themselves to discipline, leaving
behind the lustful desires which allegedly sap you of your strength.
In an attempt to find an identity, even love, Agassi has changed his
image, making the classical feminine mistake of looking for approval
from a domineering partner, entertaining the difference between
self-defence and suicide.

<HEADLINE>Japan cool on whisky tax cut</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TRADE President Michael Heseltine's call for an even playing field in
Japan's liquor business got a cool reception yesterday.
Tokyo finance ministry officials said Mr Heseltine could not wrest any
promises at talks with his counterpart, Masayoshi Takemura, of changes
to the tax structure for imported spirits.
Mr Heseltine has said he would be pressing for better access to
Japanese markets during his three-day tour. He is accompanied by the
biggest delegation of British exporters yet to visit the country.
He asked Mr Takemura to impose the same tax on imported whisky as on
shochu and other Japanese-made distilled liquors.
The British Government maintains the higher tax rate on whisky has
held back the product's market penetration in Japan. But Mr Takemura
said Japan had already given consideration to the British request by
keeping taxes on whisky flat last year when the rate on Japanese spirits
was raised.
During the meeting Mr Heseltine also asked Mr Takemura to let British
insurance giant Lloyd's of London do business in Japan.
Mr Takemura said because Lloyd's was a consortium of many individual
insurers, Japan still had several legal problems to be solved before it
allowed this, a ministry official said.
Mr Heseltine plans to meet Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and other
senior officials during his visit and will open a new British trade and
investment office in Nagoya.
The main sectors targeted for export by British companies include
healthcare, marine equipment, environmental services and construction.
Britain accounts for more than 35% of Japanese direct investment to
the European Union. It is the sixth-largest exporter to Japan. British
exports consist mainly of drugs, machinery and whisky.

THE border dispute between Peru and Ecuador, the two west coast Latin
American states, has previously had the nature of a long, rumbling
appendix. For more than 50 years each January's end has witnessed
trouble in the inland Andean area where both states' territory reaches
towards the Amazon basin. In 1941 the pair were embroiled in a war about
their competing claims. Its conclusion gave Peru an enormous tract of
land the following year, and it took nearly 20 more years before the
Ecuadorean congress effectively repudiated the whole deal, at least by
declaration. Most previous border incidents have been trivial, even
ritual, but the latest is on a considerable scale with plane and
helicopter strikes, artillery exchanges, and infantry encounters. The
scale of the infantry casualties, 31 dead in two days last week,
suggests fairly heavy fighting. Modern war tends to be fought at a
distance with automatic and heavy weapons which have lethal capacities
but which tend to inflict fewer casualties than did older-fashioned
hand-to-hand combat. That so many soldiers have died confirms fierce
fighting, and other evidence suggests a planned offensive (which does
seem to have been launched by the Peruvians last week) rather than a
mere skirmish.
It may still amount to a containable incident. Diplomatic activity has
been quick off the mark, both by other Latin American states and by
France, to restrain the two sides and get them talking. That would
certainly be in Ecuador's interest since it is much smaller than Peru,
which disposes of approximately double the military clout. It may be,
too, that for all the force of the military exchange it amounts to no
more than a Peruvian attempt to put an end to an ever-encroaching
Ecuadorean presence in what the Peruvians have regarded as their
territory since 1942. More cynically, it may simply be a ploy designed
to increase support for Peru's President Fujimoro, who is up for
re-election.
If anything of that nature were the underlying cause of the fighting
it may indeed be easily contained, though harder if the case is that the
Ecuadoreans have been steadily encroaching in an area where the terrain
may have left precise delineation of the actual frontier somewhat
confused. If, however, there is a more powerful underlying source of
trouble, this flare-up could repeat itself. The area in dispute has long
been thought of as possessing unusually rich mineral resources, thought
to be gold. Though valuable still, gold is not likely to spark off war
these days: its price is relatively low and has shown no tendency to
jump sharply for some years, no matter the adverse international news.
Oil could, however, be another matter. Rumours of a possible Amazonian
oil province might explain how both sides' interest has suddenly
sharpened. Ecuador certainly has a (relatively small) oil province in
the west, and oil is far more valuable than gold in today's world,
though it would not normally be a cause for war.

TYPICAL Richard Thompson. As the mainstream music industry at long
last threatens to cleave him wholeheartedly to its bosom -- tribute
albums featuring REM, double-page spreads in the Sundays -- he tours
with one of his least mainstream but most enjoyable set-ups. Judging by
the preview we heard here, the bleak, biting commentary on coal's
decline, Last Shift, the album due to follow by Thompson and his
namesake, regal bassist Danny, will be similarly free of commercial
concessions.
Not that this was a pair of anarchists at work. In the opening half
dozen songs they ran the gamut between razor-sharp rockabilly and the
soft-slippered swing of a tea dance band. Thompson is at his sharpest
when writing about obsessions, both his own (Don't Sit on My Jimmy
Shands with its decidedly non-PC consequences) and other people's (the
deluded Elvis fan's pilgrimage From Galway to Graceland).
He also has a habit of inventing guitar lines that no-one should be
able simultaneously to sing over. But sing over them he does and with
great passion and often self-deprecating humour, too, breaking off
during the side-splitting Now That I'm Dead to question his reputation
as a miserablist.
In the final section the two Thompsons were joined by Christine
Collister, whose short solo opening set had reaffirmed the strength and
beauty of her singing (if not her guitar-playing), for a typically
impassioned Wall of Death.
The thoroughly merited encores that followed threatened to outlast the
actual set, but when Thompson had contrived to rhyme ''Rene Magritte''
with ''Shredded Wheat'' in the deranged polka that is Two Left Feet we
knew he'd given us everything he had.

WHY take nine different artists and mount an exhibition which allows
space only for a few works by each, too few on which to base any strong
impression or judgment? Yet this show has done just that. The artists'
own explanation, in their introduction to the show, is that ''there was
no attempt to create a stylistic group, theme, or overview'' and that it
is in fact a celebration of their individuality and independence.
With no identifiable theme, however, the show is unfocused and
confusing, bringing little satisfaction to the observer. This is a pity
as there are fine pieces -- Matthew Inglis' works Camouflage are
fascinating studies, surface abstract patterns of red inks and gold leaf
highlights alternatively hiding or exposing emotive words.
Richard Walker's oils -- verdure landscapes and building interiors,
have impasto that give a wonderful sense of atmosphere; Annie Cattrell's
paper works with evocative titles -- Recede, Verge, and Pour using cuts
slicing through the paper itself to create depth, achieving simple but
effective patterns and dimensions.
Leila Galloway's untitled works, a sort of pinball board of glass
balls on yellow background, and a hanging display of wiring, lights, and
patterns of rawplugs driven into the wall. Challenging examples of new
sculpture. All the more frustrating then that the observer sees only a
hint of the artists' talents, and has constantly to change concentration
and mood as they move through the gallery.

A CAR bomb killed 38 people and wounded 256, many of them children, as
it ripped through a crowded street in central Algiers yesterday.
Security forces said Muslim fundamentalists, fighting to overthrow the
government, had planted the bomb which went off outside the police
station in Amirouche Street about 3.20pm (14.20 GMT)
Algiers radio said last night the bomb contained ''several hundred
kilos of TNT''.
''The latest count of casualties from this barbaric explosion is 38
people killed and 256 people injured, with 55 critical cases,'' a
television report said.
At the scene, bodies could be seen still burning and the street was
filled with shards of glass from windows blown out of nearby buildings.
Women were screaming from injuries and fear as they searched for their
children near the police station.
A bus, caught in the explosion as it came from Martyrs Square along
the seafront, was twisted and burnt, as was a car believed to have been
carrying the bomb.
''Passers-by were wounded apparently by shards of glass falling on
their heads,'' a witness said.
Another witness said: ''The car bomb was driven to the entrance for
officials only at the headquarters of the wilaya (regional) security
service then exploded.
The government vowed that those responsible for the attack, carried
out with a ''booby-trapped car'', would be punished.
''The explosion took place just when the street was full of children,
women, and old people. It is beyond barbarity,'' said an announcer on
Algerian television.
The atrocity occurred within 24 hours of the armed wing of Algeria's
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) telling its militants to increase
their killings in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which this year
coincides with February.
Western estimates say up to 30,000 people have been killed in three
years of civil strife. The call to kill by the Islamic Salvation Army
(AIS), the armed wing of the FIS which was outlawed after elections it
was poised to win were cancelled in 1992, came on Sunday in a report by
the Algerian Arab-language newspaper al-Hayat al-Arabia.
Amirouche Street forms a link between May First Square and Martyrs
Square -- the route taken by thousands of Algerians on Sunday when they
marched in protest against ''terrorism'' and in support of the policies
of President Liamine Zeroual.

LORD James Douglas-Hamilton must have been sorely tempted to play
truant yesterday. His attendance at the launch of the Scottish Office's
statistics on attendance and absence at schools, and the related
document on what to do about truancy, was a triumph of duty over the
desire to be elsewhere, possibly fishing. His problem lies in the fact
that the figures on truanting in Scotland are wildly improbable.
Everyone agrees that truancy is a major issue in Scottish schools but
the emotions which the subject arouses have been, until now, based
largely on anecdotal evidence of the sort supplied by sightings of
schoolchildren on the streets during school hours. The Government is
correct in its commitment to give more information and advice on various
aspects of modern education to both schools and parents. The subject of
truancy was an obvious one, especially as every school collects the data
day by day and has done for many years. Gathering the figures together
for the first time was a difficult task but it is clear that the real
problem became evident when the assembled figures looked barely
believable.
Lord James acknowledges this, pointing out that the overall national
figures mask wide variations between schools because they do not refer
to individual pupils. There are also variations in the way in which
schools differentiate between authorised absences and unauthorised ones.
Some are strict and others are not, possibly because they do not have
the resources for detailed investigation of every grubby excuse note.
Other schools have particular problems relating to the social conditions
of their catchment areas and the particular composition of the school.
Thus, one Glasgow school appears absurdly out of kilter with its
fellows, having a percentage figure for unauthorised absences which is
fully three times that of the next highest level. Our education
correspondent shows that this school was particularly strict in
identifying unauthorised absences and has, in addition, a significant
percentage of children who, for social reasons, are necessarily absent
for a number of weeks, all of which were counted into the statistics.
Two other factors (at least) arise. The low number of unauthorised
absences is simply not believable. Similarly, the high number of
authorised absences would seem to indicate collusion at the very least
by parents who should know better.
How should we react to this welter of figures on a subject of the
utmost importance for the future of the Scottish education system?
First, we should not panic. It seems reasonable, however, to deduce that
the problem of truancy in schools is significant and that it must be
addressed with some urgency. The Government has produced a document on
truancy designed to help teachers and school boards tackle the problem.
It is an excellent piece of work, containing sensible suggestions and
empowering schools to tackle the problem of truancy sensitively and with
flexibility. Other aspects of the problem are less tractable. Parents
who were failed by the education system are less likely to pass on
positive attitudes to their children. More importantly, non-academic
children must be given greater access to vocationally-directed
education. It is only by capturing their interest that they can be
brought to realise that school can be relevant to their lives, both now
and in the future.

SCOTTISH-based choreographers Alan Greig (X-Factor) and Vanessa Smith
(Group N) have been making work fairly consistently over the past three
of four years here. Both have produced interesting pieces in the past
but, in this shared double bill, there was a real sense of things coming
together in terms of ideas, dance vocabulary, and presentation.
Greig's piece, Red, was an exploration of shifting moods where the
movement was complemented by lighting washes -- blood red, steely blue,
half-lit shadows -- and a soundtrack ranging from the familiar opening
screechings of Psycho to curious fragments of spoken text. His all-male
company of four -- all strongly individual dancers, yet nicely matched
as an ensemble -- filled the space with a confident flow of movement
that was uncluttered but by no means simple or lacking in texture.
Greig's choreography had bodies energetically travelling in twisting
spins and springy, kicking runs or slowly curling and flexing on the
floor, before coiling together like a knot of living threads. And, in
between various moments of aggression, reflection, tenderness -- two
''red herrings'', visual jokes that had nothing to do with anything
except Greig's sly penchant for bizarre humour!
Vanessa Smith's interest lies in the close analysis of movement -- the
difference, for instance, between the look of a tensed-up gesture and
one that's relaxed. In Boundary, along with co-performer Brigid
McCarthy, she went through patterns of gawkiness and sweetly modulated
co-ordination, one moment stiff-legged, off-balance, the next speeding
in step through running, jumping, and standing with perfect poise. Again
this piece felt like a maturing of choreographic directions -- in all, a
rewarding night for dance-makers and audiences alike.

The other side of the coin: Kirsty Scott finds that the poor are
getting poorer on Scotland's wages front
IN two months' time, Eileen's pay packet will be cut by a third. Her
working day is longer than it used to be, she says, and despite her
employer's protestations the work is just as taxing as before.
Eileen -- not her real name -- works for Safeway. Two years ago, she
said, the company told her that her job was about to become easier
because of the merging of two departments, and her pay would be cut from
almost #6 an hour to just under #4 a hour in April 1995. Last year, it
was reported that Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of the Argyll Group,
which owns Safeway, received a pay rise of 80%, taking his salary to
#986,000 a year.
''I think that's disgusting, I really do,'' said Eileen. ''What he
makes in an hour some of the people don't make in a week. The morale in
our store is nil. It feels as if we are away back to the olden days.
''I used to love my work. I used to love going into my work in the
morning. For the last few years I have just done what I have to do.''
Eileen still counts herself among the lucky ones because her husband
has a job and the pay cut will not leave them in dire straits.
''But we all want to make a living,'' she said. ''We're not in this
for the fun of it. We're in it to make a living, and it's the low-paid
people that are getting hurt.''
Some are hurting more than others. At the Scottish Low Pay Unit
offices in Glasgow, where they are used to tales of hardship, they can
still be staggered by the wages handed out by some Scottish employers.
Like the groom who spent 51 hours a week looking after horses for the
princely sum of #65. That's about #3380 a year. Or the sales engineer
who brought home #85 a week, a total of #4400 a year.
''It's surprising how badly paid some people are,'' said Morag
Gillespie, director of the SLPU. ''All these figures came from people
who contacted us with pay or employment problems.''
In UK terms, Scotland has an unenviable wages record. In 1993, 31% of
full-time workers were low paid compared to 26.6% in Britain.
Gillespie said the Scottish figure has been artificially boosted by
the healthy pay packets handed out to oil workers in Grampian. In 1993
the number of low-paid workers in the Borders stood at 45%. The SLPU
defines low pay as anything under #5.42 an hour.
''We have always had quite a high proportion of low-paid workers
compared to the UK,'' said Gillespie. ''There's quite a big gap in
Scotland between the highest paid and the lowest paid.'' In the UK, the
gap between the richest and poorest has doubled in the past 20 years.
Male workers on the bottom rungs can now expect to be #402 a week less
well off than their executive counterparts, compared to #203 in 1971.
The SLPU has been taking careful note of the public outcry over
directors' wages, including Sunday's revelation that the earnings of
Britain's highest-paid directors have increased by 500%, nine times the
rate of inflation, over the past decade.
''I think it just underlines the hypocrisy that runs through our
society,'' said Gillespie. ''The CBI preached to ordinary workers about
pay restraint and shifted the blame for unemployment on to workers who
are expecting too much. What they then go on and do is to completely
ignore their own advice and pay themselves quite obscene pay rises. I
think it is a really deep-seated problem that people see themselves as
above the flow of things.''
Official figures released last year for average weekly earnings put
those around the bottom of the scale in Scotland on about #150 a week.
These include a petrol-pump attendant on exactly that; a kitchen porter
on #151.60; a waiter on #157.10; and a laundry worker on #159.10.
Unofficial figures compiled by the SLPU found a sales assistant in a
jewellery shop on #2.13 an hour; a store worker on #94 for a 40-hour
week; a clerical worker cum secretary who made #80 for a 35-hour week; a
second clerical worker who made #66.50 a week; and a hairdresser who
made #60 for a 40-hour week.
Compared to these statistics, said Gillespie, the salaries now offered
on the executive floors have become farcical.
''Nobody is worth hundreds of times what ordinary workers are offered.
I don't care how good they are, no-one is worth that kind of money.''

THE campaign to halt the rust on the Forth rail bridge has been dealt
a blow by the Health and Safety Executive, which has ruled that its
state of repair is not a safety threat.
Despite the Scottish Office's decision to order safety checks, HSE
director general John Rimington has endorsed the management of the
bridge, and dismissed fears that safety measures and job cuts have
drastically reduced the rate at which its 50,000 tons of steel are
painted.
Mr Rimington's support for the way Railtrack, which owns the bridge,
is maintaining the 105-year-old listed structure was greeted with
disbelief last night.
In a letter to Linlithgow MP Tam Dalyell, Mr Rimington expresses
confidence in the way Railtrack is handling the preservation of the
bridge. ''We are satisfied with their attitude to safety there also.''
In contrast Mr Dalyell, in whose constituency the bridge lies, fears
it will have to close within a year unless steps are taken to stem the
spread of rust. He asked Mr Rimington to look into concerns that HSE
safety requirements were partly to blame for the scale-down in the
painting programme.
Last night he called for an independent outside investigation into the
state of the bridge. ''I have the uneasy feeling that the HSE are being
too complacent,'' he said.
The HSE's Railway Inspectorate division investigated the repair
programme following the decision, announced by ScotRail in 1993, to
suspend painting the bridge for cost reasons.
Last Saturday the bridge was the scene of campaign action by the rail
lobby group Storm (Stop this Railway Madness). Activists brought paints
and scrubbing brushes to the bridge in an attempt to reverse what they
claim is its rust and decay.
Mr Bill Williams, Storm coordinator, said: ''The rust there is genuine
rust. It's eating seriously into the structural fabric of the bridge.''
In his letter, a copy of which has been passed to the Herald, Mr
Rimington said some safety measures were imposed by the HSE in 1989.
But, he says, the bridge remains a ''hazardous structure to work on''.
In a conclusion that supports Railtrack's argument that security on
the bridge has not been compromised, Mr Rimington said: ''Our people
believe that they are fully committed to the well being and preservation
of the bridge and we are satisfied with their attitude to safety there
also.''
Labour MP Brian Wilson rejected the claim. He said: ''It's difficult
to believe that the visual disgrace which the Forth bridge now is does
not also lead on to it being structurally threatened.''

THE director of ScotRail has apparently been gagged as a direct result
of his bleak assessment and critical comments in an article in The
Herald about the network's fate leading up to privatisation.
He was verbally ordered by Mr John Welsby, chief executive of the
British Railways Board, to ''stick to the company line'' and not speak
directly to the press ''unless it benefits the company''.
Similar advice, in writing, was also issued to the 24 other heads of
the train operating units, telling them ''to give thought to what they
say'' because of widespread publicity generated by the sell-off.
The letters follow growing Government fears that a fifth column,
trying to sabotage privatisation, exists within the industry.
ScotRail director Chris Green's highly critical comments appear to
have been the last straw for the public sector BR board, under pressure
from Ministers not to undermine Government policy.
In the exclusive interview, Mr Green -- who heads one of seven shadow
franchises already operating as independent companies -- reinforced
public concerns about the quality and standard of services after
privatisation.
He warned that ScotRail would be run down if Government demands for
budget cuts were to be met, and predicted that its fate would be to
provide the cheapest railway possible, rather than the best.
His most damning indictment was to declare that making more savage
cuts than anticipated ''cannot possibly sit with the policy of
developing and expanding the railway''.
Mr Green's ''courage and conviction'' in speaking out to save
Scotland's railways was praised by Shadow Transport Minister Henry
McLeish.
There is no doubt that, over and above the letter, Mr Welsby had
informal words with the ScotRail director following the article, which
damaged Government objectives by arguing a better railway can be
achieved only by higher levels of subsidy.
It is understood the conversation included two strictures: ''Be seen
to stick to the company line on railways,'' and: ''Do not be as
forthright as in the past in dealings with the press.''
However, it is also understood Mr Green has no intention of retreating
from media inquiries -- or of diluting his fundamental belief that,
unlike other privatisations, the railways will always be dependent upon
political decisions about levels of subsidy.
A BR board spokesman confirmed yesterday that letters had gone out to
heads of train operating units since The Herald article. He added that
they were not intended as a gag order, and were not taken as such. They
were a reminder that the unit heads were very much in the public eye.
A ScotRail spokesman said: ''No formal instruction was issued. As far
as we are concerned, Mr Green has always been honest and forthright in
his comments.''
Labour's industry spokesman Brian Wilson said rail employees are
banned from making public comment about what is going on in the
industry, and added: ''Now it seems even senior figures are being gagged
in order to protect the Government from the truth about destructive
policies.''

EIGHT months on and Mr Salmon's optimism is beginning to look a bit
overblown. The Government's most complex and contentious privatisation
is showing signs of strain.
Like a train hit by engineering works, the sale of the nation's
railways has accumulated delays, and they threaten political disaster
for the Tories.
To Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney and the ministers grappling
with privatisation it must now be clear that what could be the worst
effects of an already unpopular policy will coincide with the next
General Election.
Critics have already detected signs of a discreet Government campaign
to distance itself from the failures of a policy created under Margaret
Thatcher and encouraged, against all political advice, by John Major.
At the heart of it all is Roger Salmon, the man with the statutory
obligation to deliver the railways into private hands. His job, which
involves juggling the public's expectation of a reliable service with
the Treasury's pressure for cost cuts, is increasingly looking like a
permanent headache.
Today he will publish the first set of public service requirement
figures (PSRs), the long-awaited indication of how the railways will
look once in private hands. The PSRs define the level of service each
operator will have to provide on a given line. And, despite repeated
Government assurances to the contrary, Mr Salmon has decided that the
minimum requirement is less than the current service enshrined in the
British Rail timetable.
Such a clear rejection of a Government commitment will only encourage
Labour in its decision to put railway privatisation at the heart of its
campaign.
Like the fiasco over ticketing earlier this month, the political
uproar caused by Mr Salmon's announcement will encourage the conviction
that privatisation will mean sharply reduced services.
It will also increase the strains between Mr Salmon and the
Government. When the ticketing proposals produced by the rail regulator,
John Swift, were announced, Dr Mawhinney distanced himself from Mr Swift
and made clear he was not happy with the loss of through-ticketing.
This time Dr Mawhinney has chosen to preempt Mr Salmon's announcement
by claiming in advance that PSRs have nothing to do with timetables.
This, despite last month's pledge from Mr Major that privatised services
would be based on existing timetables.
As privatisation unwinds, so reality collides with dogma. Mr Salmon
has to make the railways attractive to the few private bidders who have
expressed a fleeting interest. And that involves eliminating any
unprofitable obligations. In doing so he is contradicting Mr Major's
stubborn insistence that the private sector, given enough subsidy, will
happily run the railways as a charity.
Some observers suggest Mr Salmon will rapidly become the fall-guy as
the political difficulties of privatisation become apparent.
Last month a leaked report prepared for the Commons Transport Select
Committee showed increasing pressure on the railways to cut costs.
It highlighted a #400m gap in BR's finances which, if not filled,
could lead to the closure of 4000 miles of branch line or a 25% cut in
peak services.
Mystery over the finances is complicated by the complexity of
privatisation, which is based on creating contractual relationships
betwen a seemingly endless permutation of new companies.
Mr Salmon will need all his skills and a degree of calm to avoid the
pitfalls created by a legal obligation to satisfy the markets and a
political obligation to save a desperate Government.

HELEN MacAlister's work has evolved consistently, always combining the
interest in texture common to many recent Dundee graduates with
symbolism and imagery. Her typical works remain large oil paintings with
objects attached to surfaces, mostly monochromatic and abstract, but
centred on drawing, generally related to the mixed-media additions -- so
that, for example, there might be both real teeth and drawings of teeth.
Her language is international, but given a particularly Scottish feel
through the sense of craft and a melancholic sense of a present
structured by powerful but eroded histories.
Margaret Bennett's Scottish Customs from the Cradle to the Grave and
Angus Martin's The Ring Net Fishermen are among the works quoted beside
the paintings and drawings, along with Pliny, Sartre, Anais Nin,
Calvino, Kundera, De Beauvoir, and various artistry texts.
Stirrup Cup includes many resin casts of the interior spaces of
glasses, often -- since they contain a wide variety of objects -- more
literary and associative, than Whiteread's plaster casts. There are also
whistles, both real and drawn in MacAlister's almost awkward, obstinate
style, which seems determined to reach some reticent secret of the
object. Sound -- both language and music -- is curiously present in
these very silent, brooding works.
The most impressive single work has the simplest reference point --
the old renaissance link between paintings and processions -- and is
mere oil on canvas. Il Corteo (Procession) pulls together the formal,
symbolic, associative, and representational strands in MacAlister's work
in a fully realised image.
Exhibition runs to February 12 before touring to Inverness Highland
Printmakers and Stirling's Smith Art Gallery.

Mary Brennan reports on a keystone of contemporary dance-making under
the caring eye of Richard Alston
RICHARD ALSTON has the air of a man who has, at last, come into his
own. As the artistic director of the Contemporary Dance Trust he not
only has the happy challenge of keeping The Place (The Trust's London
centre) firing on all its creative cylinders, he also has the best fuel
for his particular talents: a dance company of his own.
Already, following its London debut last November, The Richard Alston
Dance Company has been welcomed as a timely new arrival on the British
contemporary dance scene. His latest choreography was credited with
revealing new energies, new depths. Performances didn't just excite
audiences, and critics -- they reassured them. Something fine had
clearly emerged from a truly demoralising set of circumstances.
Alston had, in 1992, been brusquely bundled out of his post at Rambert
Dance, a company he had immersed himself in for 12 years, initially as
resident choreographer and subsequently as artistic director. The
attitude that ousted him seemed, in fact, to pose a wider threat to
contemporary dance in this country. Alston had established a reputation
for thrillingly pure dance, where qualities of line, tempo, and texture
were thoughtfully explored. Where was he to find an appropriate platform
for this work?
Well, he went home. Which is to say he went back to the company he had
started with, back in the sixties -- London Contemporary Dance Theatre.
Sadly it, too, was about to be axed. But the vision and endeavours of
Robin Howard and Robert Cohen -- who had first introduced contemporary
dance from America on to the British scene -- were not utterly undone.
The Place, with its theatre, school, and other resources, continues as a
keystone of contemporary dance-making under the caring eye of Richard
Alston.
It's a move that he says feels right. ''I have enough sense of the
pass to understand about continuity but at the same time I have enough
interesting ideas and enough interest in what's new to allow change to
take place -- and that's important.''
Change, and coming home. These are themes that also crop up when he
talks about his company and his work. ''Interestingly my work's been
influenced by coming home, and it's been influenced by the jolt to the
system which leaving Rambert certainly was. And I'm sure that it has
changed me. How? Probably in my attitude to what goes on stage. I'm
still working with movement, dealing with trying to express things
through movement -- not adding a bit of explanatory mime, or just using
imagery.
''But I feel that when the people come out in Movements from
Petrushka, they're not pure creatures trying to show you their line.
They're men and women dancing together. Individuals. So that's a
different emphasis that I'm very happy to find myself dealing with.''
Later, when talking about Lachrymae, another work in the company's
touring programme, there comes again this sense in which the enforced
move from Rambert has proved a useful, albeit brutal, learning process.
''I don't what it will mean to anyone else,'' he says. ''I have to
confess privately, it's an extremely important piece to me. There are
some things there from inside me which I've managed to externalise in a
way which I don't think I've managed to do before.''
In part, this freeing-up of powers also reflects the amount of time
and energy he can now devote to his own work. At Rambert he had other
people's work to look after -- the company held a mixed repertoire with
input from other choreographers. He talks candidly but not bitterly of
having to do what was needed to balance out a programme, and then laughs
uproariously and adds -- ''Now I'm planning programmes with myself, and
I find myself a very congenial person to talk to. We come to agreement
very quickly!''
There seems to be general agreement about the power and far-reaching
appeal of the first Richard Alston Dance Company Programme and now
Scotland has a chance to sample its strength. The company are at the
Edinburgh Traverse (February 3-5) before travelling to Inverness,
Dundee, Glasgow, Stirling, and Aberdeen. Lucky schools in various areas,
including the Borders, can look forward to workshops and residencies
with members of the group and even Alston himself.
He has always been an exceptional teacher, now that experience has
taught him some extra perceptions he looks set to become the master of
dance he was destined to be -- truly he is coming into his own.
* Richard Alston Dance Co is at Edinburgh's Traverse from Friday to
Sunday and tours to the Borders, Dundee (appearing at Dundee Rep Friday
24 and Saturday 24), Stirling (MacRobert Arts Centre Thursday March 2),
Glasgow (Mitchell Theatre Tuesday February 28 and Wednesday March 1),
and Aberdeen (The Lemon Tree Friday 10 and Saturday March 11).

Pat Keysell brings her one-woman story-telling performance to Stirling
tomorrow. Keith Bruce remembers her pioneering television work
ONE phrase should bring her to the television of your mind --
especially if you are a certain age (mine). It is: ''We are sorry, but
we can't return any of your pictures'', delivered at the end of a camera
tour of juvenile artwork.
It is not so much the words as the sign language that accompanied
them, along with a nagging cocktail jazz tune. The face on that vintage
box is that of Pat Keysell, presenter of the ground-breaking BBC
children's television programme Vision On.
A constantly inventive mixture of mime, animation, and instant art (by
Tony Hart), Vision On extended the possibilities of television at a time
when the medium was having a growth spurt. Vision On had an edge on the
competition, simply because it was entirely devoted to the visual.
Keysell had come into children's television in the early 1960s after
working in weekly rep in the theatre. (''What can you do in a week, my
goodness,'' she wonders now. ''It was good experience but too rushed and
superficial.'') Her marriage broke up and with a young son to support,
she needed a steady job. As a production secretary, she began working
with producer Ursula Eason on a worthy programme for deaf children
called, prosaically, For Deaf Children.
When Eason planned a successor aimed at the whole children's
television audience but designed to include deaf children without
pointing the finger, she asked Keysell to present it. Vision On ran for
12 years from 1964 to 1976 and pioneered a lot of television trickery
that is now part of the technical vocabulary.
''One of the beauties of it was that we always recorded the programme
in Bristol and we always had the same crew. They became addicts of what
the programme was trying to do -- we'd come up with crazy ideas and
they'd always try to make them work,'' says Keysell.
One of the most far-reaching was the placing of actors against a
separate filmed background. It is now used everyday on news bulletins.
''Frustratingly adult peak-time programmes often picked up our ideas and
they had the budget to develop them.''
Not that the achievements of Vision On were unrecognised. It was
showered with awards by the industry, most notably a Bafta for best
specialised series that it won in competition with Horizon and Dr Jacob
Bronowski's The Ascent of Man.
When Vision On ended, she moved to Yorkshire TV to make programmes
using techniques the series developed to tell stories from around the
world. Under The Same Sun was not a success, and ''a nightmare'' for
Keysell, who was directing the performing company outside of the studio
but was not permitted to do so for the recording, because of trade union
restrictions.
The experience has not gone to waste, however, since she has
resurrected the research she did for the series for her solo
storytelling project Compass, which reaches the MacRobert Arts Centre's
Studio theatre tomorrow.
The use of slides, back-projection, and sound design in her staging of
folk tales from the four points of the compass incorporates the skills
she learned from television, while her performance (still using sign
language, whether or not she has deaf children in the audience) builds
on her early training as a mime artist in the company of Steven Berkoff
and Lindsay Kemp.
She moved to Edinburgh 10 years ago, after Glasgow arts supremo Bob
Palmer, then with the Scottish Arts Council, invited her to establish a
mime project. She found a less-than-fertile environment despite the fact
that many actors had -- like herself -- trained with the renowned
Jacques Lecoq in Paris at the SAC's expense.
''The whole concept of mime was so unpopular that if they wanted to
work they had to play that down'', she says.
Although a physical style of theatre is increasingly popular, and
people she has trained have gone on to work with the highly rated
Theatre de Complicite and Trestle Theatre Company, she still finds that
directors usually have an intellectual approach and are suspicious of
mime-trained people who work more intuitively.
''I get very bored with the sort of plays that are just about people's
outer behaviour -- the dialogue is all very realistic and it all seems
to be about decay, crime, and drugs. I go to the Traverse more than
anywhere else, but I do get bored of talky talky plays. I want to see
something more expansive and universal.''
Keysell reckons there are signs that the respect level for mime is
improving. So listen up, or rather vision on. The message is in the
medium.
* Pat Keysell's Compass is part of the MacRobert Art Centre and
Central Regional Council's Schools Week. The public performance is
tomorrow at 2.15pm.

M ARGARET Thatcher was always a bit queasy about her brilliant
Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind. His new Euro-sceptic line would not
surprise her at all. Her memoirs reveal that she thought he sailed with
the wind.
At one point she describes him, an ardent devolutionist, as
''reverting to type''. At another, she marks him down as her sharpest
personal critic in Cabinet. Asked if he would support her in the
challenge to her leadership in 1990, he told her that he would have to
think about it; but he would not campaign against her. ''Silently, I
thanked God for small mercies.''
It is said that his intellect is matched by his circumspection. He
would regard this as a compliment. He wants to become Foreign Secretary
and he needs to hold on to Edinburgh Pentlands where his majority in
1992 was a mere 4290. He has to continue to be a pragmatic politician.
He has been for and against capital punishment. He resigned as a
Scottish spokesman when Thatcher ditched devolution, but took office
when she formed her first administration. Until now, he has been
regarded as being on the Europhile wing of the party.
But necessity now obliges the Cabinet to put a harder edge to its
European stance. The party has to be united and Mr Rifkind observed this
only last month after nine rebels came off the whip. ''We have to
remember the Conservative Party is not a debating society, it is not
indulging in internal discussion for some sort of literary purpose.
Politics is about power.''
If this means that Mr Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, long associated
with the soft Foreign Office line on the European Union, is required to
go to Brussels and assert British sovereignty, so be it. Politics is
about power, sure enough -- and hanging on to it. With the Tory rebels
still showing no inclination to return to the whip, Mr Major's
Government is technically in a minority.
So the Prime Minister and his Cabinet must be ferocious in their
scepticism about European monetary and political union. Mr Rifkind, or
indeed any of the others, like Ken Clarke, William Waldegrave, or even
Douglas Hurd himself, are not so much betraying their vision of Europe
as recognising that if you aren't in the game you don't get to play.
As Mr Hurd, to whom Rifkind gives total loyalty, said yesterday: ''Its
a matter of hard-headed politics.'' For the time being, the Thatcherite
sceptics in the Cabinet are making the running and the others have to
take account of this if, like Rifkind, they have an eye for their own
future. His skills in advocacy are being brought to bear on the
situation and, in this he excels.
When did we last hear Mr Major refer to his desire to put Britain ''at
the heart of Europe''? It was supposed to be a healing phrase, to knit
the party together after it had dumped Margaret Thatcher for her
strident Euro-scepticism. Mr Rifkind concurred with it at that time,
having suffered her strident Caledonian-scepticism as well. No doubt he
does so still.
But a fat lot of good it did Mr Major, apart from putting him at the
heart of arch-Europhile Sir Edward Heath for a while; now that heart is
turning to stone against him, as the Tory rebels' hearts did before.
People like Rifkind have to endure Heath's displeasure and steel
themselves to smile benignly at the Teddy Taylors and the Teresa Gormans
brooding behind them on the back benches.
The Cabinet Euro-speak has had to be changed to meet the needs of the
political hour. If a change of tone and language can help the Prime
Minister avoid an unqualified ''No'' to a single currency and an
unqualified ''Yes'' to a referendum, then we are going to find the likes
of Hurd, Clarke and Rifkind adopting a British nationalist cutting-edge.
Next year, Major faces the Inter-Governmental Conference called to
review and expand the Maastricht Treaty. The rebels have got one thing
right: the mood of the Tory activists throughout the country and the
mood of the electorate are dead against a single currency and further
loss of sovereignty. This makes it imperative for Mr Rifkind to reflect
that mood, be he in Pentlands or Paris.
A strong Euro-sceptic line is now seen as a vital element in the
preparation for the next General Election. Indeed, without it, there is
small chance of unity and the near-certainty of defeat. It fits the
Tories' anti-devolution stance as a package of constitutional policy,
sharply different from Labour.
At the next General Election Mr Rifkind will find it almost impossible
to scare the voters again about Labour taxation policy. So it is vital
for him to portray his opponents as those who would sell out to Brussels
and federalism. The build-up to Rifkind's speech in Brussels last night
is beginning to worry Labour.
Before Rifkind had even spoken, Robin Cook, the new Shadow Foreign
Secretary, put out a list of aims, barely distinguishable from
Government policy. There are dissidents on the Labour side and Rifkind
and his Cabinet colleagues are out to stir them.
The danger is that by hardening their line now as a matter of
expediency, Rifkind and the others may box themselves in too much when
it comes to negotiatiating with the 14 other member states next year.
There may come a time when the Prime Minister cannot retract an inch
from a position taken well before the haggling begins. He is left below
his bottom line.
It is at this point that the ambitious Norman Lamont poses the
question with real urgency (and it might coincide with a General
Election campaign): should we get out of the European Union altogether?
And, at this point, we may find Mr Rifkind ''reverting to type'' as
Margaret Thatcher would say.

RIGHT now one cannot open a paper, switch on the radio or flick pages
on Ceefax without hitting Europe. The issues of federalism, of political
union, of a single European currency have come to obsess the headlines.
The internal politics of the European Union have already twisted
British politics. The issue was a prime factor in the fall of Mrs
Thatcher. Concern at the march of federalism led dramatically, a few
weeks ago, to disciplinary action against eight Conservative MPs,
leaving Britain under what is technically a minority Government.
So the story runs and runs. The European Union as a whole is now
firmly in the grip of ''federasts''; enthusiastic internationalists --
such as Commission President Jacques Santer, or his predecessor Jacques
Delors -- pursuing the holy Grail of full economic and political
integration, a kind of United States of Europe.
Britain lags behind. We joined the Common Market only in 1972,
reversing centuries of history as a detached Protestant island whose
interests lay in an empire over the oceans. The party presently in
government, whose electoral appeal has long been based substantially on
English nationalism, is split on the issue from top to bottom.
The European Union has not, for most of us, fulfilled the promises
held out when Heath and Douglas-Home signed us in, nor even the blithe
rhetoric which tilted us the right way in the 1975 referendum. What
should alarm us is how, already, the ordinary British person is denied
any effective opinion on the matter. All the parliamentary parties on
the United Kingdom mainland -- even, so help us, the SNP -- are
enthusiastically pro-Europe. At a General Election, then, we have no
credible anti-European option.
The hostile voice in our affairs has been marginalised. Many years
have passed since convinced opponents of the Common Market were allowed
to hold office, speak from the Front Bench of the House, or even raise
the issue for discussion at a party conference. When I was in short
trousers, Teddy Taylor was Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. Today
he is an MP denied the whip of his own party. In 1983 the Labour Party
fought the General Election on a commitment to remove us from Europe.
Today such Eurosceptics as the party retains are not suffered to speak.
With alarming speed we have reached a consensus, in public life, that
Europe is a Good Thing. One may be allowed, like Michael Portillo, to
huff and puff in a vaguely true-Brit way against the Brussels machine.
But neither Portillo nor anyone else would dare to suggest a complete
withdrawal from the monster. That opinion is marginalised to the point
of purdah. To suggest that we might be a much happier land if we left
the European Union altogether is on a par with wearing a bobble-hat,
fancying pigeons and pressing a crease in your jeans.
Yet a strong and credible case can be made for pulling the plug on the
European fantasy.
For one, it costs too much. Membership of the Common Market, and its
ridiculous protection rackets for the benefit of middle-European
peasants, means that the average British family pays about #15 more each
week for food. By 1991, one senior politician calculated that United
Kingdom taxpayers had given #12 billion more to European institutions
than they had received in return.
For another, our increasing thralldom to Brussels has brought us under
the control of its 50,000 overpaid, meddling power-hungry bureaucrats.
The accountability of these pixies is doubtful. But, over recent years
-- and especially since the Single European Act took effect in 1992 --
their diktats have closed, or night-bankrupted, hundreds of small and
worthwhile businesses in this country. Butchers, bakers, abbatoirs and a
host of concerns in the food industry have gone out of business. They
could not afford to upgrade machinery or premises to meet new and
extreme standards of hygiene. Yet, in much of continental Europe, these
regulations have been ignored with impunity.
The Kafkaesque world of European Union economics has cost its citizens
millions of ecus in fraud. Italian farmers milked the system to kingdom
come for tomato plants that never grew. Across the Irish sea, like the
Grand Old Duke of York, cattle were marched back and forth, back and
forth from Eire to Ulster to qualify for export subsidies. The late
Western Isles MP, Donald Stewart, acidly drew the attention of the House
of Commons to a celebrated cargo of rice. It was loaded in Holland,
shipped to Scotland, unloaded, promptly reloaded, and shipped again to
Germany . . . each transaction netting the lucrative subsidy.
Nor is the European Union democratic. In the first place, the monster
is too large and too divided to allow effective political discourse. The
political party is a base and lumbering animal, but it has its own
effectiveness as a tool of accountability in the nation-state. In a
supra-natural brute like the EU, the political party fails completely to
function. Assorted socialist tribes, and assorted liberal tribes, form
crude coalitions at Strasbourg. But the real power goes elsewhere.
In truth the European Parliament has little effective control. The
faceless bureaucrats pay little attention to its deliberations. Real
power lies with the Council of Ministers, national politicians
despatched as trading ambassadors by member states. Even they are
readily outmanoeuvred by possibilities open under European law.
Britain, on entering the European Union, ceased to be a sovereign
state. The House of Lords is no longer our supreme court; any case may
now be carried higher to the European Court of Human Justice. According
to this mighty body, even an Act of the Westminster Parliament can be
frozen by a British court if it appears not to comply with European
legislation.
Some aspects of European life are plain wicked. It is bad enough that
the Common Agricultural Policy inflates food prices and faciliates fraud
on a massive scale. But the giveaway dumping of stockpiled food --
butter used to be sold, at knockdown rates, to the workers' paradise of
the Soviet Union -- was an insult to hardpressed housewives across the
Continent. The deliberate destruction, or contamination, of perfectly
wholesome food -- apples, corn, milk, fish -- in a world where millions
starve should chill the blood.
To someone like Edward Heath -- who had fought in the Second World War
-- the European dream had one overriding virtue: united in a pact for
the common weal, European countries would end their age-old habit of
walking into other European countries. Yet this came at a price. For
Britain, and perhaps especially for Scotland, it involved repudiating --
economically and culturally -- our historic allies in the New World, and
especially the English-speaking lands of the Commonwealth.
Most of us, even today, still have friends or relatives in Australia,
Canada or New Zealand. But British entry into Europe, and the consequent
tarrif-barriers or Commonwealth food imports, cost them dear. Today they
court new sisters, in the Americas and the Pacific Basin. Economically,
Australia is far closer today to Japan and Taiwan than she is to the
mother country.
Yet, as an international entity, the European Union has been an abject
failure. All her endeavours in the Balkans failed to prevent or control
that terrible conflict. Nor are all her daughters convincing graduates
in liberal democracy. Greece, a nasty little Third World country, has
brought little glory to the union. Her seedy public life, her
disgraceful vendetta against neighbouring Macedonia, and the corruption
of her law-enforcement agencies disgraces the bloc.
Austria, newly joined, is even more alarming. Her Nazi past is much
more vigorous than many were led to believe; yet her people never took
the burden of war-guilt, or denazification, visited upon Germany after
1945. Austria is still, heart and soul, part of Eastern Europe, and thus
a land where officialdom is oppressive and bribery a necessity of life.
She has a long history of Roman Catholic bigotry. Before 1945 -- even
before 1938 -- it was illegal for an Austrian to buy a Bible.
Today, in this land, there are growing signs of mounting hostility to
the European fantasy. The dishonesty perpetrated on the electorate in
1975 is now manifest. Because we are in Europe, life is more expensive,
more restricted and more oppressive. Accelerating integration brings the
alien values and needs of the Continent into yet further conflict with
our national way of life.
Something as fundamental as the Scottish fishing industry has been
gaily bartered away before our eyes. Even the most basic benefit of
Europe -- the supposedly protected single market -- has proved a con.
Over the past two years, West Highland salmon-farmers faced ruin because
cheap Norwegian salmon imports were allowed to flood the European
market. Yet Norway is not, and probably never will be, a member of the
European Union.
There is room here for a good and forthright debate on the real merits
of European involvement. We ask only two things. First, that the
anti-European arguments be heard, not sidelined and ridiculed. And,
second, that the people be again given a say. When the General Election
is called, may there be one party brave enough to promise a referendum
on the basic issue of membership in that great bloated club across the
sea.

Despite British misgivings most of our partners are anxious to get on
with a European single currency.
THERE is a good tale going the dinner round these days. Baroness
Thatcher returns from her reserved place in heaven and finds Britain has
changed. She wanders through George Square in Glasgow and finds no
beggars. She visits Central Station and finds the trains running on time
and no litter. She reads in her paper that unemployment and inflation
have fallen to zero.
Over a splendid dinner she reflects that her perfect world has finally
arrived and she basks in self-congratulation. She compliments the chef
and asks the waiter for the bill.
''How much?'' she asks.
He replies: ''Fifty Deutschmarks, ma'am.'' The Baroness, of course,
regarded any British participation in a single European currency as a
surrender of sovereignty. To give up the pound was to betray Britannia.
That view has allies to this day in the Major Cabinet.
Until recently the supporters of monetary union were happy to let
their views be known. The Chancellor likes the idea and rejects the
Thatcher view that a European single currency is, in effect, an act of
disloyalty. Mr Heseltine agrees. Pro-European Mr Hurd says he is an
agnostic and wants a public debate. Mr Major was a supporter but has
cooled on the idea as he has on everything else to do with Europe as his
day of electoral reckoning grows ever closer.
In the past few months as the pace for monetary union has been stepped
up by Brussels, the British financial institutions have been making up
their own minds while the Government stews in its Euro-mess. The City
believes a single currency to be likely and welcomes it. The
just-retired Lord Mayor of London told me in Strasbourg a few weeks ago:
''We can take it or leave it -- but we would like to take it.'' The
Confederation of British Industry warms to the benefits of a single
currency and openly supports the idea. Exporters want it, too. Banks
like the Royal Bank of Scotland have taken no formal view, saying
diplomatically the decision is political. But they are meanwhile working
on a strategy for the eventual currency switch.
It came as no surprise to learn yesterday from Mr Jacques Santer,
European Commission president, that the British Treasury itself is
already working away quietly on preparations for a single currency
despite all the huffing and puffing from Downing Street and Tory back
benches.
Looked at from Brussels and, therefore, most of the EU states, the
single currency is on track for the end of the century. The new European
economics commissioner, Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, seeks to have it in
place in 1997 if possible -- with or without British participation. If
that fails then the target date will be 1999.
In all the political fuss created about economic and monetary union
(Emu) -- and it is largely a British fuss -- it is sometimes overlooked
that the British pioneered the concept. Scotland and England have
enjoyed -- if that is the word -- political union for almost three
centuries. Monetary union came later and no-one complains except the
Scots when their money is refused in England. Emu exists, too, between
Luxembourg and Belgium.
There is a beautiful story about a journalist returning by train from
Luxembourg to Brussels after a Council of Ministers meeting. The
inspector asked him for his ticket. The journalist said he had not had
time to buy one at the station and he proffered some Luxembourg notes.
The inspector refused them, saying he wanted Belgian currency. The
journalist protested and said they had not yet crossed the border and
besides, the two states enjoyed a single currency. The inspector told
him officiously the law said he need not accept Luxembourg money on his
train. A row ensued, at which point another passenger appeared from
behind his newspaper and told the inspector: ''There is no such law. I
am the Luxembourg Minister for Finance. Take the man's money and give
him his ticket.''
In Scotland there is another precedent for a single currency. The Ecu
(European Currency Unit) which will replace existing currencies, is an
old Franco-Scots coin going back to the days when we had a single
currency with France in the years of the Auld Alliance.
A few centuries on, too much party politicking and English nationalism
is getting in the way of informed debate on a single currency. The
practicalities deserve a better airing.
The main argument for a single currency is that it will make business
more efficient and travel less complicated for ordinary Europeans. A few
years ago it was calculated that a European taking #100 around the EU
and converting it, currency by currency, would end up with #40. That was
when the EU had 12 members; with three more currencies from the start of
this year the same tourist is likely to end up with perhaps #25. The
banks happily pocket the bulk of his money.
Figures given to me yesterday will come as a shock to opponents of the
single currency. They show that in the first half of 1992 Britain's
visible exports to the little Benelux states alone were worth #7.13b.
That was #1.45b more than our exports in the same period to the United
States of America. True, the American figures were back with a slight
lead again last year -- but only slight and it will fall as the European
single market improves access for our exports.
If we examine our visible export figures to the Benelux states plus
Germany, the figures dwarf those for exports to the US. The latest
available -- for the first half of last year -- show almost #16b worth
going to these four EU nations, almost double the US figure. Currency
exchanges can only damage that trend and add huge costs to British
business.
Staying out of a single currency would put the UK at another obvious
disadvantage. Sterling would presumably have to be pinned to the Ecu
which would become the world's third (perhaps second or first) most
powerful currency. Speculators who have fed from the dripping roast of
sterling for years would be back to their mouth-watering worst as the
pound was reduced to a role roughly equivalent to the Irish punt in its
trade-related dependency on the British currency.
Exchange costs in the EU are penal for businessmen and ordinary
travellers alike. In 1990 the Commission carried out a review which
showed Europeans in the 12 member states spent up to #14.8b just
changing each other's money. About half of the cost was carried by
corporate interests but individuals using credit cards, guarantee cards,
and travellers' cheques spend up to #2b switching currencies for
personal reasons. In the EU of 15 members the figures will be even
higher.
Imagine the damage which would be done to American commerce if the
same restrictions applied to, for example, a visitor from Kentucky
arriving in California, or a Texan exporting to Wyoming. Why should
Europeans continue to be penalised in this way? The emphasis in Brussels
now as the pace of monetary union picks up is technical planning.
Despite British misgivings most of our partners are anxious to get on
with the job. Banks are planning to spend billions on new cash
dispensing machines and commerce is preparing to provide Ecu-friendly
public vending apparatus for anything from a bar of chocolate to
cigarettes.
Brussels is alive with seminars, committees, expert analysts, and
single currency pundits. Finance ministries all over Europe are getting
into gear for the changeover, regarding it not as a possibility but as a
forgone conclusion. Only the timing is in question as far as they are
concerned.
But one aspect of all this continues to nag. The EU has shown itself
too quick in recent years to move ahead of public opinion. Most British
people are suspicious of Emu. The French tend to get a touch
chauvinistic about it despite what their leaders say and the Germans
still fret at the idea, referring to the ''peseta-isation'' of the
D-mark. However useful or desirable the whole idea of a European single
currency might be, those in charge of its implementation will yet have
to persuade public opinion that it is a good idea.
I remember when decimal currency was introduced in Britain an old lady
at a Dumfries supermarket was given the new money in change. She looked
puzzled. ''It is the decimal coinage,'' she was told by the checkout
girl.
''Aye,'' she replied, ''but it'll no' last.'' In a way she was
probably right.

Jennifer Cunningham looks into the pay packets of Scotland's top
earners and finds that while some attract public outrage others are
admired
SCOTLAND'S top earners were too busy working out strategies for
increasing profits yesterday to spare a few minutes to justify their
salaries, although the furore over enormous increases in earnings for
the chief executives and directors of the privatised utilities in
particular has made salary a sensitive subject.
In Scotland the highest-paid are all in the private sector. With one
exception, none of them has felt the need to defend or apologise for
their earnings. The interesting exception is Peter Wood, chief executive
of Direct Line, the insurance subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland,
who for the past two years has been the highest-paid executive in
Britain. He earned #17.35m last year, a drop of more than #1m on the
previous year. Such was the outcry which greeted the announcement of his
1993 bonus of more than #18m that his contract was revised to replace
the bonus agreement with an annual salary of #350,000 (with a payment of
#13m in respect of future bonuses, a handsome payment to his pension
fund and #10m worth of Royal Bank shares which he will hold for five
years).
''There's a difference between someone like Peter Wood who has created
a profitable new company providing hundreds of jobs and someone who was
at the level of a local government chief official, who suddenly sees
himself in the international league,'' the Royal Bank's spokesman was
swift to point out yesterday.
That is more or less the distinction the general public make. There is
more admiration than criticism of directors who take a hefty whack out
of companies they have been seen to build up by their own efforts, but
enormous distaste for huge pay rises for chief executives who are seen
as being in the right place at the right time.
In second place in the Scottish earnings league is dairyman Alan
Wiseman, who with his brother Robert has built up his father's modest
milk round into one of the country's biggest milk retailers. His total
earnings of #1,938,623 consisted of a comparatively modest salary of
#188,623 plus a #1.75m boost from the flotation of his company.
For the same reason, Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, the
brother-and-sister team from Perth who have driven a bus through the
private coach business, are now fifth and sixth in the pecking order,
with dividends of #1,317,137 and #1,092,768 respectively.
Brian Aitken of builders BJK Aitken (Holdings) topped the salary-only
list (without dividend) in Scotland with #1,857,872 -- a massive
increase over the #109,358 he earned the previous year, although a large
part of that is expected to be a pension payment. In fact it is almost
impossible to compare headline salary figures because they include a
variety of bonuses structures.
Someone such as Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of the Argyll Group,
appears to have a pay rise of 80%, but his earnings consist of salary
plus a bonus related to performance over a three-year rolling programme
-- and he had a pay cut a year or two ago.
Alastair Balfour, managing director of Scottish Business Insider,
which carries out an annual analysis of the 240 top earners in Scotland,
believes it is in companies' own best interests to be more open about
the structure of their directors' and chief executives' earnings. He
acknowledged a difference between the entrepreneurs and ''hired hands''
brought in to do a job at the market rate -- and the fact that the
market rate is not seen to correlate directly with the size or
profitability of the company.
''This whole debate is about lack of clarity and openness. Chairmen
and chief executives are accountable to their shareholders, why not to
the public at large? Why not spell out how a pay package is made up so
that people can see how it works and that people are often set quite
tough targets?
''Companies should spell out the basis on which a performance system
operates so that from the top to the bottom we can see the consequences
of good performance and bad performance,'' he said.
Increasingly what the general public want to see is how profit levels
are reflected in salary levels throughout the workforce. It was, after
all, the combination of a 75% increase for British Gas chief executive
Cedric Brown (to #475,000) with the news that showroom staff would have
their earnings (average #10,000) reduced which caused public outrage.

A head teacher puts his school's poor performance down to 'an
excess of zeal', as Barclay McBain discovers
FRED FORRESTER, deputy general secretary of the Educational Institute
of Scotland, picked up on one of the big problems with the raw
attendance data yesterday when he looked at the figures for Castlebrae
High and John Street secondary, both city schools, the former in
Craigmillar, Edinburgh, the latter in Bridgeton, Glasgow.
Castlebrae has the highest unauthorised rate, 17%, John Street the
second highest at 12%, both way ahead of the national average of 1.3%.
Mr Forrester asked: ''These are the two worst examples in the data. Is
it because the schools are particularly honest, or are other schools
less than honest about categorising truancy?''
He did not have the answers, but used the example to reinforce his
argument that producing the data in comparative tables is at best
confusing, at worst a shambles, and in between a waste of public money
and civil servants' and teachers' time.
At Castlebrae, head teacher William Crosbie has a reputation for
conscientiousness in distinguishing between, and categorising,
authorised and unauthorised absence. But in a sense he is paying the
price of that rigour because Castlebrae's ''performance'' in the tables
has thrown an unwelcome spotlight on the school.
Lothian region handled media inquiries about the school yesterday,
with an official confirming the head's reputation. ''Any unexplained
absence is seen as a truancy until a written note is received. Verbal
notification will not be accepted,'' she said.
Lothian's education convener, Elizabeth Maginnis, also came to the
school's defence, pointing out the recognised link between deprivation
and attendance. ''For this school a 17% unauthorised absence rate
represents a major improvement. The school has a new head and management
team and I am confident that improvement will be maintained. The
authority tried to close the school a few years ago and that has
affected local morale.''
At John Street -- which also has a high deprivation factor -- head
teacher Stewart McLachlan put the school's high unauthorised absence
percentage down to ''an excess of zeal'' that led to what he described
as the ''apparent distortion'' in the school's truancy percentage.
Last session he took a rigid line, deeming as an unauthorised absence
any non-attendance for which no acceptable reason could be given. ''It
was a question of philosophy and approach. There was an attempt, perhaps
indirectly, to have parents feel that until they clarified their child's
absence I was going to deem it unauthorised.
''I thought that was the correct interpretation, but I have
reconsidered and I am confident we will make a massive improvement in
the area of unauthorised absence because we have changed the ground
rules. We were clearly out of step with the rest.''
The school has a bigger proportion of children from travelling
families than other city schools. Because of fairground shows and other
commitments these youngsters tend not to arrive at school until October
and miss the first couple of weeks after Christmas.
Last session they would have been classed as unauthorised absentees,
but with a different approach this session their non-attendance has been
authorised provided the school has heard from parents.

TRANSPORT Secretary Brian Mawhinney yesterday assured MPs that urgent
steps would be taken if reports he had commissioned showed there was lax
security on trains travelling through the Channel Tunnel.
He told MPs as he answered an emergency question in the Commons that a
balance had to be struck, and that the balance had to be struck in a way
that deliberately sought to underline the importance of security.
Dr Mawhinney said: ''I will not prejudge the reports I have sought. I
take security issues very seriously and I will look at these reports I
have commissioned very carefully.
''If I judge that further action needs to be taken, I will not
hesitate to take that action. All appropriate steps should be taken, not
least for safety, but also for the sake of public confidence.''
Dr Mawhinney's investigation was ordered after the Observer newspaper
claimed there was lax security on passenger trains and car shuttles,
leaving travellers vulnerable to bombs.
Undercover reporters made 10 trips and found their bags were not
checked or X-ray scanned at London's Waterloo station, where passengers
join the train. It also was claimed they were able to dump a large bag
on the luggage rack and leave the train before it left.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher said there was a balance to
be struck between security and fast throughput for passengers, but the
indications were that the balance was being struck at too low a level of
security.
Earlier, ministerial assurances that tunnel security would be
comparable to that at airports had been ''very far from met.''
Random checks showed that most cars were not being subjected to even
cursory searches, most foot passenger baggage was not electronically
scanned, and only a few lorries were required to pass through the
enhanced X-ray scanner.
He told the House: ''There can be no absolute guarantee of passenger
or vehicle safety, but the laxity of procedures that has been exposed is
not acceptable and can and must be tightened -- without significant
intrusiveness or loss of speed of transmission.''
In his statement, Dr Mawhinney said that when allegations that
security arrangements for Eurostar and Eurotunnel were inadequate were
first brought to his attention he had called for urgent reports.
Legislation required the operators to carry out counter-terrorist
security measures and the Government's requirements had not changed
since the tunnel was opened.
Such measures were ''closely tailored to the threat, as assessed by
the Government's security advisers,'' and included spot searches.
Dr Mawhinney added: ''I take security matters very seriously. I will
decide what further action needs to be taken in light of the reports I
have commissioned and any further security advice I receive.''
During the exchanges which followed, Labour MP Tommy McAvoy (Glasgow
Rutherglen) said that this was a matter of concern far beyond the
South-east of England, and argued that resentment Dr Mawhinney had
displayed over the Observer coverage of the issue showed his department
had been ''caught on the hop.''
Labour MP Bruce George (Walsall South) said: ''The Channel Tunnel is
the terrorist target in the world. It does not have to be a major
terrorist organisation that could destroy the tunnel.'' He urged Dr
Mawhinney not to be beguiled by security analysts who would tell him
that the threat was low.

BRITONS are in the grip of a ''feel bad'' factor and it's getting
worse, according to a European survey published yesterday.
A growing number think 1995 will be worse than last year and an
increasing number say there has been no improvement in the jobs market
in 12 months.
Asked if they expected the jobs situation to get better, worse, or
stay unchanged over the next year, 33% of the UK survey sample of 1045
registered as ''don't knows'', compared to only 3% last year.
Those believing this year will be worse than last year rose by 6% to
40%. The same percentage thought economic performance will decline,
possibly due to ''lack of political confidence'', according to the
Brussels Commission, who conducted the poll.
However, the general trend in Europe is the reverse, with optimists
outnumbering pessimists for the first time since 1991.
The Irish are Europe's biggest optimists, with 47% convinced this year
will be better -- a 13% rise. Only 14% thought it would be worse.
The British are also gloomy about personal prospects, with 33%
claiming to be worse off financially, compared with 29% last year. Only
17% think things have improved.

A LAIRD has been ordered to provide shelter for his deer herd at a
Lanarkshire tourist attraction after complaints from the public about
the condition of the animals.
A Ministry of Agriculture vet has told Mr Richard Carmichael of
Carmichael that the animals, which are in fields without cover beside
his Carmichael Visitor Centre, must spend the rest of the winter in a
large cattle shed.
SSPCA Inspector William Little said he had received several complaints
that the deer were suffering because there was nowhere for them to
shelter in the muddy and sometimes flooded fields.
Inspector Little said he kept watch on the site and was ''horrified''
at the way one stag was shot and removed from the field which is in full
view of the A73 near Thankerton.
He said: ''Its carcass was lifted in the shovel of a tractor and
carried across the field. I told the men I was not happy with that. The
animal should have been covered up and carried away on a trailer, away
from public view. The deer need shelter from the wind, rain, and snow.
In the wild, they can get into a deep wood but in those fields there was
nowhere for them to go.''
Mr Carmichael, who has reared deer for 25 years in New Zealand and
Scotland, said: ''The stags in question have good coats and plenty of
feed. The only muddy areas in the fields are where the deer feed. As to
complaints about their being up to their bellies in water, believe me if
a deer sees a puddle in a field he will wallow in it of his own accord.
''We had to shoot the stag because it would have been attacked by
others once it was penned under cover. There was no other way it could
have been moved from the field once it had been killed. We could not
risk shooting it at night.''

Despite reservations about the Government's statistics, Education
Correspondent Barclay McBain concludes that truancy is a problem in
Scotland's secondary schools -- and that parents are partly to blame
THE Government put the final piece in its jigsaw of published
information about the various aspects of school performance yesterday
when it released the first set of national data on school attendance and
absence. It wasn't an easy fit. Many in the education community felt
sore as yet more comparative tables of raw data were laid out for public
scrutiny.
Following on publication of examination, school cost, and leaver
destination statistics the Government now believes it has put together
the full picture for parents, teachers, and others interested in
education.
The Scottish Education Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, said the
Government had fulfilled its Parents' Charter commitment to publish
annually facts and figures about the state of schooling.
What do yesterday's statistics tell us about school attendance,
absence, and truancy? According to the data, authorised absence --
including sickness and medical treatment -- is running at 6% in the
primary and 10% in the secondary sector. Unauthorised absence -- mainly
truancy, but including exclusions -- is about 0.2% in the primary and
1.4% in the secondary sector.
Below we publish the data for Scotland's secondary schools, including
the number of half days per pupil lost through absence. Each morning and
afternoon session counts as a separate attendance.
The senior chief inspector of schools, Nisbet Gallacher, said he was
reassured rather than surprised by the many rows of zeros in the tables
for primary schools. ''Our experience would suggest that truancy is not
a major problem in the primary school,'' he said.
What of the secondary sector? Lord James said common sense suggested
there were links not only between attendance and pupil attainment, but
also between truancy and crime. Yet the unauthorised absence rate of
1.4% may surprise those who believe that truancy is a growing problem.
It may also explain why the Minister and his officials yesterday spoke
more about the ''worrying'' level of authorised absence than about
truancy.
''Even after making allowances for the fact that, in some cases, the
reason for authorised absence is related to the school's curriculum, the
disruption to classroom work and teachers' lesson-planning, as a result
of these high absence rates, is likely to be considerable,'' said Lord
James.
Mr Gallacher said: ''I find the levels of authorised absence across
the board surprisingly high in some schools.'' The attendance and
absence report noted that a 12% absence rate in secondaries was
equivalent to each pupil being absent for more than four weeks -- 44
half days out of a session of 380 half days. On this basis, almost
13,000,000 pupil half-days would have been lost through absence.
Interestingly, the Scottish Office chose not to give national averages
for authorised and unauthorised absence at the bottom of each set of
tables of local authority returns. Officials said comparisons between
authorities would be unfair because of the different ways in which they
categorised and recorded absence.
For example, five authorities included exclusions as authorised
absence -- as the Scottish Office guidelines now state -- five treated
them as unauthorised, one treated them as attendance, and one as neither
attendance nor absence, with pupils withdrawn from the registar.
New Scottish Office guidelines say that work experience for
fourth-year pupils should be classified as attendance, something which
only three authorities -- Strathclyde, Lothian, and Tayside -- did in
the year covered by yesterday's data.
Apart from the confusion caused by different interpretations of
authorised absence, it must be remembered that the separate figures for
authorised and unauthorised absence conceal the problem of condoned
truancy -- when parents provide excuses or absence notes for pupils who
should really have been at school.
Despite our reservations about the raw data, there is no doubt that
truancy is a genuine problem, particularly in the third, fourth, and
fifth years of secondary schooling. Mr Gallacher yesterday expressed
concern about some schools being ''too quick'' to accept parental
reasons for their children's absence, and in many homes the feeling
among parents of alienation from the educational system rubs off on
their children.
The chief inspector hoped the report would stimulate many questions
from parents, schools, and school boards. It was important, he said, to
delve behind the facts and look for the underlying reasons for irregular
attendance.
So why do pupils truant? On the facing page we interview two girls
from different backgrounds who have truanted for different reasons.
There is no such thing as the Identikit truant, as another Scottish
Office publication also issued yesterday makes clear.
The Quality in Education centre at Strathclyde University's Jordanhill
campus was commissioned to produce the Truancy File, four booklets
designed to help teachers tackle the problem. It highlights the many and
varied reasons for avoiding going to school.
These include:
* To avoid being bullied;
* To avoid being called a swot;
* To avoid a particular subject or teacher;
* Because they are bored;
* Because they have not done homework and want to avoid a row.
Parents may keep their youngsters away from school for several
reasons:
* To babysit for younger members of the family;
* To help parents at their work, perhaps in a shop;
* To wait in for a tradesman;
* To go on a family holiday;
* To look after someone who is unwell, or to shop for them.

AH, what joy it brings to the heart to see a nation made mightier yet
by victory on the sporting field.
England's win over the Aussies in the Fourth Test -- by 106 runs with
35 balls to spare, if you must know -- had them all cock-a-hoop in the
Commons yesterday afternoon.
If they could have cracked open a few tinnies of that stuff most Scots
wouldn't give a XXXX for, you can bet they would have, and the party
would have carried on into the night.
There was talk of new centres of cricketing excellence, getting these
young whippersnappers at school to play more of the game, and building
up real competitive sport so that England could ''build on the success
of its cricket team today.''
As Commons officials wondered whether it might be worth trying to find
a tape of Land of Hope and Glory or Jerusalem to play in the background,
Sports Minister Iain Sproat found himself fielding (sorry) a whole
series of eulogistic questions about the great triumph.
Tory John Marshall (Hendon South) opened the batting at Heritage
Questions with: ''Will you join me in congratulating the English
cricketers on their magnificent victory and wish the England rugby
players every luck on Saturday, when they can show they are good
Europeans by trouncing the French?''
Mr Sproat, a Scot by birth but a cricket fanatic, cleverly resisted
the temptation to enter the Euro-sceptic debate, confining himself to
echoing the congratulations.
The game really got going, however, when MPs started talking about
setting up cricketing academies.
An exuberant Nicholas Hawkins (Blackpool South) beamed: ''If we had a
cricketing academy like the Australians, we might have won the first
three Tests as well and not simply be celebrating victory after the
opportunity of winning the series has gone.''
It all sounded like a terribly exciting idea, but Mr Sproat revealed
that the cricketing world was divided on the issue.
He clearly had been having a very nice time indeed, recently, as he
said he had been in Adelaide assessing what the Aussies get up to and
would be reporting his findings to the cricket authorities back here.
There is, of course, always someone to spoil the party and it is
usually, of course, Labour MP Dennis Skinner.
Bowling at pace from the colliery end, he asked Mr Sproat to pay
special tribute to the two Derbyshire players in the England team --
Devon Malcolm and Phil DeFreitas.
He expressed concern for the future of sports training centres run by
the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation threatened by
privatisation.
The Minister, however, was already advancing down the wicket, bat in
hand, waiting to strike Mr Skinner for at least a boundary.
''I have done everything I can to protect these facilities,'' he
boomed. ''As far as Mr DeFreitas and Mr Malcolm are concerned, I had the
pleasure of sitting between them at the test match at Adelaide. They
said the most important thing I could do was to get cricket played in
schools again and I agree.''
It emerged that all these cricket academies and so on are likely to
paid for out of -- you guessed it -- the National Lottery. If a suitable
plan was put forward, Mr Sproat said he could not see why it could not
be considered as an appropriate cause.
The ghost of serious politics looked on from somwehere in the gallery,
shook his head and wandered away.

A WOMAN was being comforted by relatives last night after her husband
and two children were found dead in a fume-filled car.
Mr John Joseph Burke, 37, was in the driver's seat with the body of
his seven-year-old daughter Siobhan beside him. Her eight-year-old
brother John was on the back seat.
South Wales detectives found a hand-written note on the dashboard of
the locked car, which was parked in an isolated country lane near the M4
motorway in Mid Glamorgan.
It is understood Mr Burke, of Ogmore Vale, Mid Glamorgan, drove off
with the children on Sunday after an argument with their mother, who has
not yet been named by police.
The car was discovered by Mr Keith Edwards, a social club steward, at
about eight yesterday morning as he walked his dog along Broom Lane at
South Cornelly.
A police spokeswoman said: ''There do not appear to be any suspicious
circumstances. A report will be prepared for the coroner.''
A Home Office pathologist has been called in to establish whether the
victims died from carbon monoxide poisoning.

FEARS that road safety would be put in jeopardy by plans to extend
vehicle excise duty were expressed in the Commons last night.
Labour Treasury spokesman Dawn Primarolo -- during committee stage
debate on the Finance Bill implementing the Budget -- called on
Ministers to review the decision to tax heavy vehicles such as snow
ploughs, gritters, street cleaning trucks and street lighting wagons.
Consequences for road safety could be ''very severe'' in areas where
councils had been capped and were short of money, she said.
She also protested at the decision to remove concessionary duty rates
from road recovery vehicles run by the AA, RAC and other operators.
Paymaster General David Heathcoat-Amory said the system was being
simplified from the present arrangement of 132 different exemptions and
concessions.
However, 999 vehicles and those for the severely disabled would stay
exempt. There would be no adverse safety implications.
Later, Ms Primarolo protested at a Government move to introduce an
annual #35 vehicle excise duty on milk floats and other electric
vehicles.
''That any increase in cost is targeted at doorstep deliveries is a
further threat to the viability of the milk round,'' she said.
Mr Heathcoat-Amory said the Government recognised electric vehicles
had certain environmental advantages, which was why they were to be
taxed ''at such an advantageous rate''.
The Minister insisted it was right to remove them from the totally
exempt category, which was being reserved for emergency vehicles and
those used by the severely disabled.

Dick Louden hears how Lothian region's policing policy used to be
purely punitive. Now welfare is to the fore
IRREGULAR attendance is not the same as truancy. There are all sorts
of factors -- domestic, medical, financial, not getting on with a
teacher, feeling that the curriculum is irrelevant -- which can explain
a youngster's absence, according to Ron Degnan, head of Lothian region's
education welfare service, who can speak with authority. He has overseen
the service since its remit was expanded beyond school attendance in the
late 1970s to encompass the welfare function. ''Before that, schools
treated us merely as enforcement officers,'' he says. ''Our role was
purely a punitive one.''
His staff of 22 is supervised by four area officers, including his
depute, Trish Rhone. Serving a region with 960,000 pupils, they carry a
heavy load but find job satisfaction in being able to take a case right
through to its conclusion -- including a court appearance, if need be.
''It used to be a predominantly male group of ex-Service and police
officers,'' Ron Degnan recalls. ''There was little liaison with teaching
staff. We simply investigated cases of non-attendance and reported back.
Now the welfare content is to the fore -- we are a caring profession
with a social work orientation. We believe in giving every family a
chance and in stressing to parents and children the need for maximising
the level of educational attainment.''
Trish Rhone, who still spends half of her week on the ''beat'',
explains that the education welfare service can offer immediate
practical help to some families. ''We tell them about their right to
benefits,'' she says. ''We maintain a stock of second-hand clothes which
we can issue and we assess applications for clothing grants.''
Of course, not all cases of non-attendance can be readily solved and
there are two normal channels of referral. One is the school liaison
group -- in which the welfare officers collaborate with other
professionals like the school social worker, doctor, and psychologist --
whose task is to deal informally with individual attendance problems
within the school community. The other is the network of area attendance
advisory groups -- comprising school board members, parents, and staff
-- set up by Lothian region to deal with procedural issues. They can
dispose of cases, continue them for up to six weeks, call for medical or
psychological reports, arrange for attendance orders to be issued or, in
more serious cases, refer them to the Reporter to the Children's Panel.
At times entry to the home is refused. ''In such cases the school
sends out a warning letter,'' says Trish Rhone. ''However, we usually
gain admittance through a non-threatening approach. Women officers are
normally asked in, perhaps because it's mostly the mother who is at
home.
''We work one or two evenings a week because it is a fruitful time for
home visiting. The whole family is usually in the house and we can
discuss the problems with everybody together.''
''We want to be seen as befrienders,'' Ron Degnan explains. ''We are
the home-school link. Sometimes we act on behalf of the parents -- for
example, by composing their letters if they have problems of reading or
writing.''
Trish Rhone had just arrived after two commitments where her role had
been sensitive. In the morning she had collected and taken to school a
girl who had attended on only 13 occasions since last August. Delicacy
was called for because the girl is also on the non-accidental injury
register.
In the afternoon she had taken a mother and son for a difficult
interview with a head teacher who did not want to accept the boy because
he had been excluded from another school five months ago and had a
record of disruptive behaviour.
Both Mr Degnan and Mrs Rhone take the view that irregular attendance
-- though very little of it should be classified as truancy -- is a
genuine problem, even in primary schools. ''It is sometimes masked by
schools not wanting to acknowledge its existence,'' Trish Rhone
maintains, ''or by staff just accepting parent notes at face value.''
The pursuit of absentees runs the risk of making education welfare
officers as popular as traffic wardens, but Lothian's supportive
approach can bring surprising rewards. ''We sometimes come to be seen as
family friends,'' says Trish Rhone with obvious satisfaction. ''I've
been invited to weddings and baptisms, and I receive letters and
Christmas cards every year.''

<TEXT>
BAD weather was yesterday hampering efforts to recover a 70-tonne
steel structure, built at a Western Isles fabrication yard, from the
bottom of the Irish Sea.
The massive pipelines connector, known as a spider, was ripped off a
ship by storms over a week ago. It had been built at the Lewis Offshore
Ltd yard, at Arnish, near Stornoway.
It was on passage from the Lewis yard to Cadiz in Spain. It was an
order for Dutch contractor Bluewater Engineering, which is building a
floating production vessel for Amerada Hess's Fife oilfield.
Early yesterday, a remote-operated vehicle (ROV) found the structure,
which cost #750,000, on the sea-bed, south of Ireland.
Mr Otto van Voorst, operations vice-president of the Dutch project
contractors, Bluewater Engineering, said the pictures from the ROV so
far had shown no damage.
He said: ''It's amazing. It looks as if it is unharmed.
''But we will only know for sure when we get it up and have it
inspected by our people.''
The heavy-lift crane ship Stanislav Yudin was standing by at Cork
until conditions improved.
Lewis Offshore is hopeful that it would be chosen to carry out any
repairs if the spider is damaged.
Yard director Henk Grauwmanns said: ''We would, of course, be very
interested in any further work we could get.''
He said fears that Lewis Offshore would be landed with a huge bill
after the spider's accident were ''nonsense''.
He said: ''The responsibility is with Bluewater. It will, I am quite
sure, be the subject of a claim to their insurers.''
Mr Van Voorst of Bluewater confirmed last night that the course of the
spider's next voyage would depend on the engineers' inspections.
''It will be either returned to Lewis Offshore for repair, or continue
to Cadiz,'' said Mr Van Voorst.

AN Australian court sat in Scotland yesterday to try to find out how
part of a cargo of whisky disappeared.
It is believed to be the first time a foreign court has sat in
Scotland, although in the past Scottish judges have been commissioned to
take evidence on behalf of foreign courts.
The case is a civil action being heard by the Supreme Court of New
South Wales. Rather than have 15 to 20 witnesses fly from Scotland to
Sydney to give evidence, the court sought permission from the Lord
Advocate for judge, counsel, and solicitors to come here.
The proceedings are being heard in a small courtroom within the High
Court in Glasgow's Saltmarket before Mr Justice Dunford. He has been
given the power to compel witnesses to attend.
The action has been raised by a firm of Australian spirit merchants,
D'Aquino Brothers, of Orange, New South Wales, against the Australian
Customs.
The firm is being represented by an Australian QC, a barrister, and a
solicitor. The Customs have brought a barrister for the case, and the
Australian Government is being represented by one of its solicitors.
D'Aquino Brothers is seeking an application to recover a bulk
container of whisky which was seized by the Customs from a
German-registered ship, La Perouse, when she docked in Sydney in
September 1992.
The whisky, blended by Grant's at its distillery in Girvan, was sent
by road to Coatbridge, then put on a train for Felixstowe before being
loaded on to the La Perouse.
There are allegations that some of the Scotch was decanted from the
bulk whisky container before its arrival in Australia.
The hearing in Scotland will take about a week, after which the case
will revert to the Supreme Court in Sydney.

<RECORDNO>980091090</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NEW BENEFITS for people with personal pensions should be extended to
those in occupational schemes, Labour's City spokesman Alistair Darling
insisted in the Commons last night.
Opening a further day's committee stage debate of the Finance Bill,
which enacts the Budget, he warned the Government's pension proposals
could force more people out of company schemes and into personal plans
if they wanted extra flexibility.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke announced in his November Budget that
personal pension plan holders would be able to defer buying an annuity
-- an annual income for life -- with their funds after retirement.
The Government has argued this will give greater flexibility allowing
people to defer buying their pension until annuity rates, which move
with interest rates, are more attractive.
Mr Darling said the option should be extended to occupational schemes,
additional voluntary contributions and old style retirement annuity
contracts.
He said: ''We should not bring about another situation where people
are forced to transfer to get the flexibility we welcome for the private
pensions.''
Treasury Economic Secretary Anthony Nelson said the present tax
approval rules for occupational pension schemes did not prevent
flexibility in the timing of annuity purchases.
It was not clear that any legislative change was needed. But if
discussions with occupational pension providers proved that changes were
desirable, the Government would consider introducing appropriate
measures.

MINISTERS will take another look at the controversial system of
student loans and grants in their wide-ranging review of higher
education, Government Education spokesman Lord Lucas of Crudwell
promised last night.
However, he warned peers not to expect major changes.
Lord Lucas was speaking before the Lords rejected by 86 votes to 38, a
Government majority 48, a cross-party call to give students the right to
claim housing benefit and income support during the summer vacation.
Opposing the demand, Lord Lucas made clear the Government was unlikely
to concede to pleas for the repayment of student loans to be made
through the tax or National Insurance system.
He said: ''We believe students are properly provided for in a fair and
flexible system of support. However, we keep an open mind on this issue
and we are ready to listen to criticism.''
Lord Lucas claimed students were better off now than before loans were
introduced in 1990 and he challenged the universities to provide
research to prove their claims of increasing student hardship.
Opening the debate, Liberal Democrat Lord Addington warned of an
''almost total lack of confidence'' in the student loans scheme.
The Bishop of Chester, the Right Rev Michael Baughen, said there was a
''sense of deep injustice'', with many students living on a very tight
budget and reluctant to take a loan.
He said one woman student in his chaplaincy at Liverpool University
had only #5 a week to spend on food and heating.
Debt counselling was now commonplace at the university, he added.
Tory peer and academic Lord Beloff said the loans scheme had been
bound to be a ''tragic disaster''.
He added: ''It is not only a bad thing but a scheme that is being
administered with monstrous incompetence.
''Looking at the Student Loans Company makes me think that Lambeth
Borough Council is a model of business efficiency.''
He insisted: ''There is no doubt that a considerable degree of
hardship exists, leading inevitably to the lowering of academic
standards.

Youngsters became hooked on the Biker Mice from Mars after Channel 4's
The Big Breakfast showed the leather-clad trio -- Throttle, Vinnie, and

LIBERAL Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, calling for more investment in
education, yesterday accused leading Labour politicians of ''double
standards'' by sending their children to private and opt-out schools.
Mr Ashdown -- who sent his two children to the local comprehensive
school in Yeovil, Somerset -- was speaking following disclosures that
the chairwoman of Labour-run Haringey Council's education committee in
north London, Lucy Craig, was sending her 16-year-old daughter to a
#7800-a-year college in Kensington.
Leader of the Opposition Tony Blair, Shadow Employment Secretary
Harriet Harman and Labour's legal affairs spokesman Paul Boateng have
been accused of hypocrisy by sending their children to grant-maintained
'opt-out' schools which is against Labour policy.
Mr Ashdown said: ''For Mr Blair and other leading Labour politicians
to want the best for their children is unassailable. Those who lead us
are entitled to make choices but if those choices go against the
policies and principles they believe in, then they should not be
surprised if the charges of double standards are made against them.''
The Liberal Democrats today will launch a national petition, called
Stop the Education Cuts, tomorrow.

A resentful head teacher tells Barclay McBain that publication of
absenteeism statistics undermines all the good work done against the
odds in deprived areas
DOUG MARR, head teacher of St Machar Academy in Aberdeen, likens the
publication of tables of attendance statistics to a perverted game of
snakes and ladders. ''Every time you attempt to claw your way up the
ladder the Scottish Office comes along with another snake,'' he says.
''You work very hard and do your best to achieve good attendance and
then you get a metaphorical kick in the teeth because your average is
above the national ones.''
He speaks from the heart when he says there is a feeling of resentment
in difficult areas when the publication nationally of such data
undermines all the good work being done against the odds.
St Machar is a big, inner-city school with seven areas of deprivation
in its catchment. It does not have its problems to seek, but neither Mr
Marr nor his staff would see that as a reason for contemplating the
raising of a white flag in the battle against truancy.
''Truancy is a major issue in Scottish schools, and I still think
we're not seeing the full extent of it. The figures don't reveal the
true extent, although I don't think they're being massaged,'' he said.
There is no massaging of the figures or condoning of unauthorised
absence at St Machar.
''If you slacken off you're going to lose. In our place we invest a
fantastic amount of time in maintaining attendance and chasing up
absentees. Our guidance staff are terrier-like in pursuing absence notes
and we have the full support of welfare officers who go round knocking
on doors.''
But Mr Marr concedes there is still too much absenteeism at St Machar.
''It increases from year one, gathering pace in second, third, and
fourth years until you get to the situation in fifth year where you have
wholesale absence.
''Up until last Christmas, our fifth-year figures were running at
14.5% authorised and 8.4% unauthorised absence, totalling 22.9%. We've
identified that as a priority area because the figures look so awful.''
What a look at the figures does not tell you -- and this is the
perennial problem with raw data -- are the factors behind the rise in
absenteeism, and what a school seeks to do to tackle it.
From October onwards a growing number of fifth-year pupils who were
too young to leave school at the end of fourth year stop attending
because they know the system will not catch up with them by Christmas,
when they can leave.
''These youngsters don't see what is being offered as being relevant
to their present and future needs,'' says Mr Marr. ''We're working with
fourth years, particularly those who may feel they've been trapped by
their birthday, to get them to think more positively about fifth year,
to look at it as two terms so that they will do a General Scottish
Vocational Qualification Level One in areas in which they have had
part-time work and in which they'll be trying to get jobs.''
The GSVQs -- vocational awards relevant to broad occupational areas
offering progression to further education and training -- will be
available in retail, catering, office practice, and information
technology. The school is working with Grampian region on a scheme to
provide work experience as part of the GSVQ. Mr Marr hopes the offer of
a coherent, vocational programme related to work experience and the
prospect of a job or going on to college will prove attractive to those
who conclude that their schooling is irrelevant.
But there is only so much a school can do. Mr Marr agrees that parents
have a crucial role in tackling truancy. ''In some parts of our
catchment you're often dealing with parents who are themselves
alienated. They haven't got a job, they're living on the poverty line.
They ask what education has done for them, and that attitude transmits
itself to their children.
''A growing number of parents are taking their kids off school for
more than two weeks' holiday. That sends a message to their youngsters
that a cheap, out-of-season holiday is more important than their
Standard Grades.''
Pupils are kept off school for all sorts of other reasons, as the St
Machar head knows all too well. ''You might have a single mum with a
primary-aged child who is off school ill. She has a job which she can't
afford to miss, so she keeps her older child off secondary school to
look after the wee one.''
He goes on: ''I never cease to be amazed by the difficulties some
youngsters overcome to get to school. There's nobody to get them up and
out and provide them with breakfast, and yet they come to school. I
think they see it as a caring institution that gives them some
stability.''
Mr Marr wonders sometimes if there is a hidden agenda in the
publication by the Scottish Office Education Department of so many
comparative tables. ''If a school has low absence rates and high exam
passes, it is a good school, but the reverse might be the case. The
quality of teaching, the care, rigour, energy, and pastoral work in
schools like ours is often greater than in those in more privileged
areas.''
But it will be evident that there is no room for complacency. ''We are
considering all sorts of different ways to show we're monitoring and
following up absenteeism,'' says the head. The school is looking at
Radio Ears, a computerised system for checking up on attendance period
by period. Every teacher has a small desk-top computer connected by
radio to a central computer in the school office which gives an instant
record of attendance throughout the day.
The only drawback is the cost, between #30,000 and #40,000. ''Perhaps
some of the SOED money which goes on compiling these tables could be
used to provide schools with the wherewithal to tackle absenteeism. The
assistance would certainly be very welcome,'' says Mr Marr.

ANOMALIES in Air Passenger Duty -- a #5 tax on domestic and European
Union flights and #10 elswhere, introduced last year -- brought Lords
protests yesterday.
Labour peer Lord Eatwell said a three-day return from London to
Glasgow was taxed at #5 but a longer-period return was #10. The tax was
being imposed in an ''inequitable and arbitrary manner''.
Tory former Aviation Minister Lord Brabazon of Tara said that flights
to Zurich were being taxed at #10 but those to other Swiss cities of
Basle and Geneva were only #5.
Lord Brabazon said it was a ''horrendously complex duty to collect''
and British Airways was spending more than #11 million a year to levy
it.
Lord Henley, for the Government, said of the Scottish journeys:
''There comes a point where a return journey ceases to be a return
journey and becomes two separate legs of two different journeys.'' The
tax, expected to raise #315m in a full year, was being kept ''as simple
as possible''.
He said Basle and Geneva were treated as EU because they ''straddle
the border'' with France.

THERE were furious scenes in the Commons early this morning as Scots
MPs protested angrily about Government plans for the imposition of
increased vehicle excise duty on heavy goods vehicles in the Highlands
and Islands.
Labour MP Brian Wilson was involved in furious exchanges with
Government Minister David Heathcoat-Amory over plans which, it is
thought, could cost HGV operators, such as farmers, thousands of pounds
a year.
Liberal Democrat MP Ray Michie (Argyll and Bute) put forward an
amendment which proposed limiting vehicle excise duty for HGVs operating
in certain regions to #150 a year, but the Minister initially stuck to
his guns.
As Scottish MPs and a series of others rose to intervene, including
Tories David Harris (St Ives) and Sir Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire
South) the Minister was forced to concede that he would hold talks about
the matter with concerned members and that the House could return to the
matter at a later date.
However, just as it appeared a deal had been done, Tory Whip David
Lightbown objected, thus throwing matters into further confusion. Deputy
Speaker Dame Janet Fookes, who was chairing the committee, said it would
be left to Speaker Betty Boothroyd, who would be given a full report, to
decide the matter.

BRITAIN is sneezing and wheezing through its worst flu-like epidemic
for six years,
according to Government research.
Thousands of offices have been struck during what has traditionally
become the sick note season, but it is not the flu that is keeping
people away.
After outbreaks of red, Russian, Asian and Beijing flu in recent
years, this time it is a cocktail of ''respiratory infections'' -- chest
bugs.
Some are potentially dangerous, particularly for children, as they can
lead to bronchitis and pneumonia, but most have symptoms similar to flu.
The worst offenders are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and
microplasma pneumoniae.
The Public Health Laboratory Service said: ''It is impossible to tell
just how many people have these viral infections, but testing hospital
samples at some of our sites suggests this year has seen more cases than
at any time since 1989.
''We only see those cases which have been tested -- many do not report
it and think they just have flu.''
But the laboratory service has sent details of the infections to
doctors around the country in its latest bulletin, and expects a rise in
cases.
Microplasma pneumoniae tends to come round in four-year cycles and RSV
is not seen every year, so the combination of both has sent figures
higher.
The spokeswoman added: ''There is also flu around at the moment,

Strathclyde hopes an internal review will lead to a more efficient
service to meet the needs of schools, reports Dick Louden
BERNARD McLEARY, Glasgow's education officer responsible for the
school attendance service in the city, says: ''Attendance officers are
valued by schools, but we need to look at the management lines.
Ultimately they are answerable to the director of education, but they
are also loosely linked to the chief executive's department, which
administers the region's attendance councils.''
With a school population of around 345,000, Strathclyde has 118 posts
of attendance officer, giving a ratio of 2928 pupils per officer
compared with 3444:1 in Lothian and 5500:1 in Dumfries and Galloway.
Glasgow division, with 89,100 primary and secondary pupils, has 28
attendance officers for a ratio of 3182:1. Glasgow is also the only
division to have a structure of five area officer posts based in
secondary schools -- St Leonard's, St Gerard's, Woodside, John Bosco and
St Roch's.
According to Mr McLeary, the duties of attendance officers are not
welfare-related, as in Lothian, but involve liaison with school staff,
home visiting at the request of schools and preparing reports for the
attendance councils and attending their meetings. Most of their time is
taken up in pursuing attendance issues in secondary schools. ''There is
no single procedure which determines where the role of the officers
begins and ends,'' he says. ''A school might enlist their help right at
the beginning and hand the investigation over to them. On the other
hand, it might use its computer data to generate letters to the home,
and bring in the attendance service at a later stage to make direct
contact with the home. It is up to the school to decide, knowing what it
does of the individual case.''
Anxious to take the attendance service forward, Strathclyde has
recently completed an internal review of its operation, but as yet there
have been no discussions with trade unions or staff about the findings.
Bernard McLeary hopes that the result of the review will be an
efficient service meeting the needs of schools. ''Outside Glasgow each
officer has an allotted number of schools to cover,'' he says.
''Perhaps it will now be possible to reshape the service responsively
on the basis, not of numbers of schools, but of local geographical
areas, with management support devolved to the secondary head teacher.
That would offer a coherent local structure and give officers the
feeling of being more directly managed.''

LABOUR faces a battle between sitting councillors and those selected
to fight for seats on the new single-tier Highland Council in April's
elections.
Already two former members have left the party and declared their
intention to stand as independents against the official Labour
candidates.
Another sitting councillor has declared an intention to stand in
defiance of the party and a fourth councillor is ''considering his
position''.
The difficulty has arisen because district and regional councillors in
Lochaber and Inverness are laying claim to the wards which most closely
resemble their existing seats.
Last week Mrs Olwyn Macdonald, who represents Caol and Inverlochy on
Highland Regional Council, was passed over in favour of Caol district
councillor, Mr James MacKay.
Mrs Macdonald has left the Labour Party and resolved to fight Mr
MacKay for the seat. Her husband, Iain, regional councillor for Fort
William, also resigned from Labour and will fight the North Fort William
ward as an independent.
Mrs Macdonald said: ''I was asked if I wanted to stand for another
ward but it was only last May that I was returned with a greatly
increased majority, so I would have been letting my constituents down.''
Mr MacKay defended his right to stand for the seat, saying he believed
the candidate should live in the ward they represented.
Mr Ally Chisholm, Muirtown councillor on Inverness District Council,
has lost out to Mrs Chrissie Cumming, regional councillor for Ness and
Muirtown. He said he would be standing for election but would not resign
from the party.
Mr Clive Goodman, regional councillor for Crown/Raigmore, was beaten
in the selection process by Inverness District Councillor David Munro.
Last night he told The Herald: ''I am still considering my position.''
The Scottish General Secretary of the Labour Party, Jack McConnell,
said he had been aware of what was happening in the Highlands although
no complaint had been received.
He added: ''Obviously this is unfortunate but I think it is worth
stressing that we don't yet have a full slate of candidates in the
Highlands. If one candidate misses out on their first choice seat, they
should considering standing for another.''

MORE than #4m in legal aid has been paid so far for the late Robert
Maxwell's sons, Kevin and Ian, to defend themselves against fraud
charges, it was disclosed last night by the Lord Chancellor, Lord
Mackay.
Giving details in a Lords written reply, Lord Mackay said the amount
paid on account to lawyers acting in the case, R v Kevin Maxwell &amp;
Others, was #4,028,008.
This included final costs in the magistrates' courts of #829,377 as
well as payments on account up to November 1994 in the Crown Court of
#3,198,631.
All payments included VAT and disbursements, such as expert witness
and accountancy fees and other expenses.
The Lord Chancellor added: ''I do not consider it would be appropriate
while the case is continuing to give a further breakdown of those
figures, but I would be prepared to do so once the final bills have been
paid.''
The arrest and charging of the Maxwell brothers followed a seven-month
investigation into the Maxwell media empire.
Earlier, Tory MP Michael Stephen (Shoreham) protested in the Commons
that reports that convicted murderer Winston Silcott was getting legal
aid worth up to #100,000 to sue the Metropolitan Police ''makes a
mockery'' of the system.
Silcott, who is serving a life sentence for killing 22-year-old boxer
Anthony Smith, is said to be bringing the action following the quashing
of his conviction for murdering PC Keith Blakelock in the Broadwater
Farm Estate riots in 1985.
Silcott, 35, is reported to be suing the police for false
imprisonment.

A STRATEGY that could reshape the structure of the arts in Scotland
was revealed yesterday, with the announcement of Government funding to
companies in the coming financial year.
Celebrating its first full year of ''independence'' under the wing of
the Scottish Office, the Scottish Arts Council has chosen to reward
companies and initiatives that it sees as having produced innovative
work or which follow directions supported by its Charter for the Arts,
the fruit of a long period of consultation.
Within the context of a very limited increase in its own grant of
#700,000, or 2.94%, the council has chosen to spread its resources
unevenly, making no change in the grant to some companies, substantially
rewarding some, and cutting the grant to others -- including the
complete removal of revenue support for Musselburgh's Brunton Theatre.
Some of the smallest increases go to the biggest companies, whose
financial problems are already well known. Scottish Opera, the council's
largest revenue client received an increase of #110,290, taking its
grant to #4,670,290. The company had sought increased support of over
#500,000, but was putting a brave face on the announcement.
''This doesn't solve our financial problems, but we welcome an
increase above standstill,'' said a spokesperson.
The winners in music were Edinburgh-based jazz and contemporary music
promoter Assembly Direct, with a grant leap from #75,000 to #115,000 --
a consolidation of funds previously granted from the Arts Council of
Great Britain -- and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, which the council
proclaimed as ''Britain's first million pound chamber orchestra'' with
its #20,000 increase -- the same as that awarded to the much larger
Royal Scottish National Orchestra.
Chief exective of The Scottish Ballet, Mr Peter Kyle, was more
outspoken about the standstill grant awarded to his company -- as
compared with a 50% increase to dance development projects elsewhere in
the country.
''Standstill funding does create a serious problem for The Scottish
Ballet. We now have to subsume inflationary increases and will therefore
have to consider the impact this will have on jobs and programme.
''We knew six weeks ago that English National Ballet had received an
8% increase and that Northern Ballet Theatre was granted a 105%
increase. The level of funding allocated to English companies indicates
that the council does not accord a similar priority to its own ballet
company.''
Many of Scotland's theatre companies also recieved ''standstill''
grants, but the one major casualty was the Brunton Theatre in
Musselburgh.
Arts council director, Ms Seona Reid, said: ''The council has decided
that it cannot give priority to providing the levels of support required
to sustain a third producing theatre in Lothian.''
The decision to withdraw the theatre's #53,000 grant produced an angry
reaction from East Lothian District Council, which gave the company a
#150,000 revenue grant this year, and funded a #400,000 refurbishment of
the theatre.
Indicating that the decision would not be allowed to go unchallenged,
council chairman George Wanless said it was an ''unjustified blow'' for
a theatre which has consistently won acclaim from critics and audiences
alike.
Glasgow-based TAG theatre, which is following up its Edinburgh
Festival triumph with Sunset Song with an adaptation of Alasdair Gray's
Lanark, won the largest percentage increase of over 11%. Arts council
deputy director Ms Christine Hamilton, described it as doing
''innovative work, with exciting plans ahead''.
Increased grant awards go to Glasgow's Tron and Citizens' Theatres,
Dundee Rep, and Edinburgh's Traverse and Royal Lyceum -- the latter
likely to raise the most eyebrows after the theatre's well-publicised
financial difficulties.
Lyceum artistic director Kenny Ireland said the award was ''very
encouraging''. ''It makes us feel that what we are doing is being
recognised,'' he said.''

PUPILS from Oakgrove Primary School at St George's Cross in Glasgow
were the first to take up the Penny Mile Challenge set by the Children's
Hospice Association Scotland and sponsored by the Royal Mail yesterday.
If each of Scotland's 2800 schools collects a mile of pennies laid end
to end -- enough to stretch from Scotland to the pyramids in Egypt -- by
the end of March next year, CHAS will have reached its #10m target for
Scotland's first children's hospice.
CHAS's director of fundraising, Mr John Rea, said: ''We have already
raised #8m towards our #10m target, but the hardest part is bringing in
the final amount. We hope as many schools as possible will take part,
and that parents and relatives will help out by digging out their small
change.''
Work has already started on the first children's hospice in Kinross.
When completed in February 1996 it will be able to support 200 families
a year, with accommodation for eight children and their families at any
one time.
The hospice, which will have a staff of 35, will offer holiday breaks,
respite care, bereavement and family support, and outreach services.

MONKLANDS District Council plans to convert a former cleansing depot
in Airdrie into a #500,000 multi-purpose business centre.
The council, which describes the project as a major strand of its job
creation strategy, proposes to transform the former Lady Anne depot in
Gartlea into training accommodation and workspace.
However, it says the project is dependent on funding approval from the
European Regional Development Fund and the Scottish Office. Lanarkshire
Development Agency has also been approached for financial assistance.
The council leader, Councillor Jim Brooks, said: ''If we are to
attract new investment to the area, it is vital that we have a
highly-skilled workforce, accommodation for business start-ups and a
strong economic infrastructure.''
Meanwhile, the council has started building a #400,000 factory
complex, also in Airdrie, which could accommodate about 30 jobs.
The complex, at Mill Street yard, will be comprised of start-up units
designed for new small businesses and is expected to play an important
part in the regeneration of the local economy.
Work on the 4500sq ft of factory accommodation is expected to be
completed by the end of March. Twenty jobs will be created in the
construction phase.
Councillor Hugh Lucas, chairman of the planning and development
committee, said: ''It is generally accepted that one of the most
effective ways to promote long-term economic growth is to help local
start-up and growing companies with accommodation.
''If we are to attract new companies to Monklands we must be able to
offer high quality factory and office space, and this will be an
important addition to the current industrial space available.''

THE Scottish National Party yesterday seized on the recent
highlighting of the devolution-independence issue, asserting the
Scottish dimension was clearly back on centre stage.
Party leader Alex Salmond released a letter received last week from
the Prime Minister in which, he said, Mr Major categorically accepted
the right of the Scottish people to self determination.
Coupled with the party's decision to set up a team to investigate
proposals for a transition to independence, and a televised all-channel
SNP broadcast last night (note Monday), Mr Salmond said independence in
Europe was the most attractive option for Scotland.
He said this was the only option which would result in constitutional
stability for Scotland because the status quo did not provide for that
and Labour devolution plans for a Scottish Assembly were a recipe for
uncertainty.
Referring to Mr Major's letter, he said he had questioned him on his
attitude to the issue following a passage in Lady Thatcher's memoirs.
She stated Scots had an undoubted right to self-determination, so far
exercising the right to remain in the union.
She added, however: ''Should they determine on independence, no
English party or politician would stand in their way, however much we
might regret that departure.''
Mr Major's letter said there was no confusion at all in his mind about
the matter.
''My views clearly confirm that my position is essentially the same as
the passage you quote from Lady Thatcher's memoirs,'' it said.

Sally is in her fourth year at secondary school. Her background is
middle class and she is an only child living with her parents.
Absenteeism was unknown to her before -- and since -- the experience she
describes below. She is a friendly, assured girl, only too ready to talk
about her flirtation with truancy. Her parents were concerned about the
girl with whom she was truanting but Sally herself remained discreet on
the subject.
'IT started before the summer holidays, when I was in third year. At
that time of the school session, people start to switch off a bit. We
weren't doing an awful lot of work in the school.
It wasn't as if it happened all that often -- a few mornings and the
odd full day. I couldn't be bothered going into school at times. Other
days I arrived late -- I'm not too far away and I just walked. I got
lazy, I suppose. I had a pal who skipped school along with me. We might
go to the house of a friend who has left school, or we might just stay
in the park. We really didn't do anything special.
There could have been other reasons, like being in third year and
wondering if I could cope with Standard Grade. Some of my pals are very
conscientious, but I worried about things like deadlines for submitting
folios. Yet I think I should do all right in the sciences, for example.
My guidance teacher had always trusted me and at that stage I talked
my way out of it. I even got by without bringing in a note, though I got
quite a bit of grief from my biology teacher.
After the summer it started again. We dogged a couple of mornings and
a whole Friday. I managed not to hand in a note again, so I dogged off
another Friday. That was so stupid. I got caught this time. The guidance
teacher phoned my dad. He was very upset, he just couldn't believe it.
As for my mother -- she just flipped.
They were so angry. It was the day before my birthday and I didn't
really have a birthday at all. I've been grounded ever since, though I
was allowed to go to the Christmas dance.
I've got to make my parents trust me again. That's what matters. I
haven't taken any more time off since then, and I never will. I fell
quite a bit behind with my work. I have to say that the school handled
it all well.
My advice to anybody in that situation, or thinking about it, would be
-- if you feel your attitude is slipping, talk to somebody.'
* SALLY'S MOTHER: We were absolutely shocked when the school raised it
with us. It came right out of the blue. My husband had a long chat with
the guidance teacher, then we had it out with her and she was grounded.
There were other reasons -- which I won't go into -- which contributed
to her grounding, but we were certainly apprehensive about the company
she was keeping and that was made clear to her.
I'm sure she has told us the whole truth. As far as restoring trust is
concerned, we're getting there. There is no bad atmosphere in the house.
My husband and I just feel that, somehow, we must have let things slip.
* HEAD TEACHER: Like the parents, we were concerned for Sally's sake
because it was all out of character. I'm sure that there will be no
recurrence. This kind of temporary deviation -- under the influence of a
pal -- is not uncommon.
Bullies were to blame
Jane is a third-year pupil who lives on a peripheral housing estate
with her mother, who goes out to work, and her seven-year-old sister.
From an early age she has had little chance of stability, moving primary
school several times. As a result -- and because of bullying -- her
attendance was not all that good, and absences were sometimes condoned
by her mother. Her secondary school has taken a close interest in her
and she has become an excellent attender. She is small for her age and
does not relax easily, but gives the impression of someone who is slowly
developing enough confidence to look after her own destiny.
'EVERY time I was getting settled at primary school, we moved on. I
had to make friends all over again. Some kids used to call me small, and
say I had big ears, and make fun of me.
Twice I came home with footprints on my back. Mum complained to the
school, but they didn't do much about it. The more she mentioned it, the
worse I seemed to get bullied. Other times she would go to the kids'
parents. They just grounded them for a while and it started all over
again. Sometimes I told Mum I wanted to stay off school, I didn't feel
well, and she gave me a note and said -- that's okay.
Secondary school is great. I'm older and a bit bigger and the teachers
have encouraged me to stand up for myself. My attendance improved early
in the first year. At that time we would get letters from the school
saying I could face up to it. I was worried at first because the classes
were larger and I hardly knew anybody and there was nobody to stick up
for me.
I've got a couple of good pals now and, if anybody annoys me, they say
-- just leave her alone. If somebody hit me, the teachers used to give
them a big row and it stopped after that.
There's no more bullying now. I can even face up to exams. Most of my
work is done on time. There are some days when I don't feel like going
out because of the weather, but I go anyway. I never think of missing
school. My Mum has changed too -- she would never give me a note now.
She says, 'Out you get. It's time for me to go to work. I'm in a hurry.'
If anybody thinks about giving me a bad time now, I just ignore them
and they go away. I'm a non-violent girl. I hate violence. I just hope
it stays like this.'
* JANE'S MOTHER: The school has brought Jane out of her shell and her
work has picked up. It's a Roman Catholic school and I feel that has
helped. She has the confidence to talk to her male guidance teacher.
When she was at primary school she used to be picked on a lot. At one
time it was even thought that I was to blame, that I was causing her
bruising. Actually it was another child who was waiting for her outside
the school gate.
* HEAD TEACHER: Jane fits the stereotype of the victim of bullying.
We've concentrated on building up her confidence. After each attendance
review we sent an encouraging letter home to make sure she kept trying.
We did the same with her other reports -- in the primary school they had
been largely negative, so we emphasised positive aspects such as her
politeness.
It hasn't been easy for her and the condoned absences helped her to
hide away, but her attitude has been transformed and things are looking
much brighter for her.

THE main teachers' union may decide to lift its boycott of the Higher
Still programme for reforming upper secondary schooling after a meeting
with Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton yesterday.
The Educational Institute of Scotland, which represents eight out of
10 teachers, voted nearly a year ago not to take part in the
development. It was campaigning to reduce teachers' workload at that
time.
It is understood, however, that there is some anxiety in the EIS
national executive about the union being sidelined as important
decisions about the Higher Still proposals are being taken and prepared
for implementation.
At its meeting next month, the executive will receive a report about
yesterday's Scottish Office talks and may decide to change its stance if
it concludes there was sufficient movement on issues to which the EIS is
opposed.
The EIS is concerned about proposals for a so-called ''fast track''
through secondary school for the most able pupils. The Higher Still
blueprint includes a Level F for first and second year pupils to enable
them to sit Standard Grade and Higher examinations in specific subjects
a year early.
The Institute has concerns about the creation of a separate stream
which, it argues, would threaten comprehensive education and devote
scarce resources to a small percentage of pupils.
However, according to EIS deputy general secretary Fred Forrester,
Lord James said there was no intention to allow the development of a
separate stream. The Level F and ''fast-tracking'' were not a high
priority for implementation and, said Mr Forrester, the Minister
envisaged only 1% or 2% of pupils taking Standard Grade exams in third
year.
Lord James said the Government would develop a Level F, but added: ''I
do not regard it as a high priority for development or implementation
within the same timescale for Higher Still.''
The Government has set 1997 for first implementation of Higher Still.
Lord James also announced another #2m of funding and the publication of
two documents dealing with the programme.
The first sets out details of key tasks, targets, and timescales to be
met in the run-up to its introduction.
The second offers schools and colleges advice on aspects of management
and planning for its implementation.

A HEALTH board chairman has apologised for remarks made by one of his
senior officials over a threat to close casualty services at Ayr
Hospital.
Mr Jim Donaldson, chairman of Ayrshire and Arran Health Board, said
that a press statement made on behalf of director of public health, Dr
Drew Walker, contained elements which were capable of being
misinterpreted.
It said public concern over the future of accident and emergency
services at Ayr was ''unnecessary'' -- a remark which Mr Donaldson now
concedes was wrong.
At the end of last year, the board made it known that three options
for accident and emergency services in Ayrshire were under
consideration, two of which would have resulted in the closure of the
unit at Ayr.
Following a public outcry with 133 written responses to the
consultation document and six petitions with a total of over 30,000
signatures, the board decided to keep the Ayr unit in service.

A FATHER dropped his baby son from a 42ft bridge because he thought
the two-weeks-old infant was the devil, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Kevin Moy, 32, apparently believed he himself was the anti-Christ
and had to stop his son doing ''terrible things''.
A jury at the High Court in Glasgow heard the former laboratory
technician was convinced he and his son would destroy the world with a
super virus and were responsible for the Gulf War.
The court heard that his wife Eileen and other friends stopped him
from jumping over the parapet after his son, who died in hospital next
day.
Only two weeks earlier, Mr Moy had attended the birth of his son
Eoghan but later was said to have thought a birth mark on the baby's
head had been put there by the devil.
Mr Moy was also allegedly influenced by the ''devil number'' six. His
son was born on September 26 and his bank-card number was 666, the mark
of the beast, and sixes occurred in his lawyer's phone number.
The jury was told Mr Moy, of Alexander Street, Dumbarton, admitted to
police and psychiatrists what he had done.
However, his defence counsel Mr Kevin Drummond, QC, told the court Mr
Moy was pleading not guilty by reason of insanity at the time of the
offence.
Mr Moy denies that on October 10 last year he threw his son over a
bridge at Overtoun Burn, near Milton, Dumbarton, injuring him so
severely he died in hospital next day and that he murdered him.
Mr Craig Scott, prosecuting, said the Crown and the defence were
agreed that Mr Moy threw his son from the bridge while on a visit to the
area with his wife Eileen.
It was also agreed the accused then tried to throw himself over the
bridge, and that he was ''pale and shaking and that his eyes were
glazed'', and that shortly afterwards he tried to cut his wrists.
The prosecution and the defence also agreed that during a
tape-recorded interview that night Mr Moy admitted dropping his son from
the parapet.
Asked why he had done it, Mr Moy had replied: ''Because over the past
few days I came to believe I was the anti-Christ and my son was the
devil and the two of us had to be stopped or something terrible would
happen to everyone because of me and my baby. My intention was to finish
it.''
Mr Moy admitted during the interview that his wife had her back to him
when he dropped their baby and knew nothing about what he was going to
do.
The court heard that around 1988 Mr Moy developed ME, a viral
disorder, and his mental health appeared to deteriorate from then.
Consultant psychiatrist John Baird, 47, said he examined Mr Moy twice
and formed the view he was insane at the time of the offence and was
suffering from a severe mental illness and from an alienation of reason.
When he saw the accused last on December 29, he was still suffering
from a severe mental illness but his opinion was he was sane and fit to
plead.
Questioned by Mr Drummond, Dr Baird said he thought Mr Moy's illness
could be controlled by treatment in a mental hospital.
Consultant psychiatrist Thomas White, of Carstairs State Hospital,
said that Mr Moy believed if he did not kill himself and his baby the
world would be destroyed by them.
He said Mr Moy did not appreciate the ''wrongfulness of his actions''
at the time of the offence.
Mr White added that the accused was now sane and fit to plead but
needed treatment in a mental hospital.
The psychiatrist said that Mr Moy's marriage had been ''happy'' and
that he and his wife had looked forward to the birth of their baby.
The trial before Lord Mayfield continues.

THE world's best-loved table football game has become multi-racial.
Subbuteo teams will now include black players after years of
complaints that the game did not represent the face of modern football.
Waddingtons, the game's manufacturer, had argued it was too expensive
to mix black and white players in a team. However, the firm has now
modified production processes so that three black players are found in
new sets.
''It's been something we've been trying to solve for many years,''
said a spokesman.
''It will cost a little more to make them, but we will absorb the cost
so that there will not be significant price rises in shops.''
The firm decided to include three black players in teams after figures
showed 25% of British footballers were black.
New Subbuteo sets will also carry the Premier League's official logo,
include referees dressed in League outfits, and offer a replica League
Trophy.

GERALD DURRELL, zoologist and conservation pioneer, was credited by
some of his peers with changing people's attitudes to zoos.
Sir David Attenborough believes Durrell brought about the swing
towards smaller, less well-known species, while Dr Desmond Morris
considers his success in returning endangered species to the wild and
teaching students to look after conservation programmes in their own
countries to be his most important work.
Through his 37 books, he raised public interest in wildlife of all
sizes. He shared his brother Lawrence's ability to write, although their
subjects could not be more diverse.
Gerald's forte was to describe the excitement of collecting insects
and butterflies in the garden of his Corfu home, and spin comedy into
his books which hooked generations of people into the world of nature.
His childish pursuits in the Mediterranean sun were the seeds of My
Family and Other Animals, a best-seller later turned into a hit
television series.
He was born in Jamshedpur, India, but following the death of his
father, the family returned to Britain before moving to a villa in
Corfu, where collected animals, ranging from scorpions to eagle owls.
Asked if he preferred animals to people, Durrell replied: ''They are
so much more straightforward and honest. They have no sort of
pretensions.''
Durrell's first book was The Overloaded Ark, which he followed with
the best-selling The Bafut Beagles, My Family and Other Animals, A Zoo
In My Luggage, Catch Me A Colobus, The Stationary Ark, and The Aye-Aye
And I. They have been translated into 31 languages.
He presented 12 television series, originally producing films of his
own expeditions.
Durrell began working with animals as a student keeper at Whipsnade
Zoo and, aged 21, made his first animal collecting expedition to the
British Cameroons. Expeditions to British Guiana (now Guyana),
Argentina, and Paraguay soon followed.
In 1959, he founded his own zoo on Jersey, dedicated to saving
endangered species by breeding them in captivity.
In 1964, he founded the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust which
established many species of endangered mammals, reptiles, and birds. In
the 1983 New Year Honours he was awarded the OBE for services to the
trust.
Mr Durrell underwent a liver transplant last year from which he never
fully recovered. He married twice. His second wife Lee was at his
bedside when he died. He was 70.

AN immediate review of security was being undertaken at a Glasgow
psychiatric hospital yesterday after a female office clerk was attacked
and stabbed.
The incident happened in an office in the administration block at
Leverndale Hospital, on the south side of the city, despite elaborate
security procedures already in place, including a door-entry system.
The intruder managed to get into the building shortly before 8am and
make his way to the office where May Murray, 32, from Govan, Glasgow,
was working alone.
Armed with a knife, the man demanded cash and then stabbed her before
fleeing.
Staff raised the alarm after hearing her cries for help. The woman,
who is employed by the Scottish Association for Mental Health, was taken
to the Southern General Hospital suffering from a deep stab wound to her
abdomen.
A hospital spokesman later described her condition as ''comfortable''
and confirmed that she was likely to remain in hospital for several
days.
As police officers carried out a search of the extensive hospital
grounds, detectives searched the office to determine whether anything
was taken.
The attacker is described as being 5ft 6ins and wearing a dark waxed
jacket, denim jeans, a dark woollen hat and black and white training
shoes.
Detective Sergeant George Nedley, of Pollock CID, appealed for anyone
in the area around the time of the attack to come forward.
He added police have not ruled out the possibility that the intruder
could, in fact, have been a patient at the hospital. ''At this stage in
our inquiry we have not ruled out anything and will keep an open mind
about that,'' he said.
''It is more than likely, however, that the man wandered into the
hospital from the street. We are currently attempting to establish
whether any money was taken.''
A spokeswoman for Leverndale Hospital confirmed that a review of
security procedures at the hospital was currently being undertaken.
She revealed that security had been a priority issue at Leverndale in
the past year. ''We have been working closely with the police in the
last few months on crime prevention and the personal safety of our
staff.''
Security doors had been installed and there were 24-hour security
patrols.
She added: ''Security has always been high on the agenda and obviously
what has happened is very worrying indeed.''

The district council abhors racism and this case demonstrates that we

A 25-YEAR-OLD man has appeared in court charged with the murder of
West Kilbride design student Yvette Wilson. Mr Edward Mullen, of
Meadowfoot Road, West Kilbride, made a brief appearance before at
Kilmarnock Sheriff Court. He is accused of murdering Mrs Wilson, 27, on
January 19 at West Kilbride railway station and of setting fire to her

SCOT FM, the commercial station which has been criticised for being
all talk and no action, had the opportunity yesterday to let its first
audience figures speak for themselves.
The official quarterly RAJAR figures revealed that the station has an
8% weekly audience and is on target for a 10% share within the year.
However, this was well short of the 13% share which the station
confidently predicted it would achieve when it applied for its
broadcasting licence.
Still, to claim 235,000 listeners in its first three months of
operation was something to be happy about, according to station chief
Tom Hunter.
Scot FM, which covers the Central Scotland belt from Glasgow to
Edinburgh, secured only 2.4% in the east and 2% in the west. This
compares with a market share for Radio Forth FM of 17% and Clyde One of
25.7%. Clyde Two has a market share of 17% in the west.
Scot FM is also in direct competition with Radio Scotland, whose
service is almost 90% talk radio. Yesterday's figures showed that Radio
Scotland, with a weekly audience of 928,000, had increased its share
marginally over the previous quarter -- 17,000 more people had tuned in
to the station.
Scotland also showed that it was bucking the trend when it came to the
much-maligned Radio One.
While audience figures for the whole of Britain continued to fall --
though at a slower rate than in the past -- in Scotland they showed a
slight increase (up from 27.9% to 28.5%).

THE general secretary of the offshore union, the OILC, Mr Ronnie
McDonald, yesterday rejected a claim that he had been suspended from
office after a meeting convened by a rival faction.
Mr McDonald said: ''It is merely the latest effort in a year-long
campaign of disruption by a small clique. I really don't have any
comment to make, because to do so would give credence there otherwise
would not be.''
The organising committee of the OILC -- the Offshore Industry Liaison
Committee -- said yesterday that, following a disciplinary hearing in
Glasgow on Friday, Mr McDonald had been suspended from office in
absentia pending further disciplinary proceedings.
A statement said that Mr McDonald's authorisation as a signatory for
the union's financial affairs was also rescinded, and the union's
bankers and other service suppliers were being notified.
Mr McDonald said that, irrespective of what they did, it would have
''absolutely no effect'' on the running of the union.
His rivals said they were waiting to hear if the bank would act on
their instructions.
The bitter row dates back to the union's elections last May.
Some of the executive committee who were not elected complained about
the running of the ballot, which the certification officer subsequently
declared had not been properly carried out because no independent
scrutineer had been appointed.
Mr Peter Douglass, spokesman for the ''organising committee'' or
''rebels'', said: ''The committee which McDonald attempted to put in
place does not hold office legally.''
He added: ''The only legitimate committee is that which held office
prior to the so-called elections. That committee has reconvened.
''We cannot tolerate a situation where an employee of the union
continues to ignore the realities arising from the certification
officer's decision.
''Contrary to his public assertions that the certification officer has
told him that there is no need to re-run the elections, we have written
confirmation from the official that he has made no such elaboration.''
Mr McDonald said yesterday that the certification officer did find
that the union had made a technical omission.
''We said to him that, if that omission in any way materially affected
the outcome of the election, we would re-run it.
''His response was that he saw no indication of any material effect
and in the circumstances he will not make an intervention and it was for
the union to decide what to do.
''The union will have its conference in April.''

RIGHT wingers on the executive of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union yesterday combined to prevent Scottish member Jim
Airlie from being appointed as acting AEEU president.
They ignored the tradition that the senior executive member chairs
meetings until a vacancy is filled, by ignoring Mr Airlie and going
instead for the second most senior member, right-winger Mr Nigel Harris.
The controversial decision, taken by a 5-2 vote, is an indication of
just how worried the dominant right wing is that Mr Airlie could win the
presidency, left vacant by Mr Bill Jordan's move to Brussels to become
the first British general secretary of the International Confederation
of Free Trades Unions.
Right-wing fears intensified last week with the death of acting
president, senior executive member and the right-wing candidate for the
presidency, 54-year-old Mr John Weakley.
It seems they were particularly keen to prevent Mr Airlie from
presiding over the first joint delegate conference of the new AEEU,
formed by the amalgamation of the old AEU and the EETPU electricians'
union.
They may also have been aware of a growing campaign among union
activists seeking to promote Mr Airlie as a ''consensus'' candidate who
could command the respect of the majority engineering section, the old
AEU, and the electricians, the former EETPU. He could also ''punch his
weight'' within the TUC and the Labour Party, which he joined last year
after many years in the Communist Party.
Activists argue that tough-talking Jimmy Airlie could be the catalyst
to end the traditional squabbles between the right and left and break
the logjam in ongoing talks to cement the amalgamation.
Mr Airlie, 58, was already considering whether to stand for the
presidency, but appeared to be heading for the safer option of standing
for re-election to his own Scottish executive post.
AEEU rules stipulate that he must surrender his executive post to
stand for the presidency, which would represent a major gamble even for
a betting man such as he.
Last night he was said to be very angry at his treatment and still
considering whether to stand.
The death of Mr Weakley should also have meant Mr Airlie being
restored to the TUC general council, from which he was removed three
years ago when the union's falling membership meant reduced AEU
representation. That, too, should not be taken for granted now that the
right seems keen to exert its authority.

* The Smithsonian Institution in Washington is to simplify radically
an exhibition of the US bomber Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic
bomb on Hiroshima, under pressure from critics who said the display
painted America as the villain and Japan as the victim.
''We made an error,'' said Smithsonian Secretary Michael Heyman. The
museum plans to eliminate controversial text and photographs, and simply
exhibit the fuselage of the Enola Gay along with some commentary from
the plane's crew.

<HEADLINE>Former PoWs demand apology from Japan and #15,000 each</HEADLINE>

Tokyo, Monday
WARTIME prisoners from Britain, the United States, New Zealand, and
Australia filed a lawsuit today against the Japanese Government,
demanding #15,000 each and a formal apology for their suffering at the
hands of Imperial Army soldiers.
The suit is the latest in a series filed by victims of Japanese
wartime atrocities, including women forced into sexual slavery and
others taken to Japan as slave labour.
''Without question, the Japanese contravened the conventions in the
most appalling ways,'' said Martyn Day, a British lawyer. ''Insult the
victims felt during the war is as strongly felt today, 50 years later,
as they felt all those years ago.''
Arthur Titherington, 73, a British veteran, said he was taken prisoner
at the 1942 fall of Singapore, and sent to a copper mine in Taiwan,
where he suffered starvation, stress, and trauma.
''Any real blossoming friendship with the Japanese nation will not
increase to any extent until certain obligations are made by the present
rulers of Japan,'' said Mr Titherington.
Calling the Japanese military's treatment ''the most barbaric acts
against humanity'', he said Japan had no excuse for its actions.
Joan Phyllis Jamson, 66, from Britain, the only woman among the seven
plaintiffs, said: ''Women are still suffering from what the Japanese did
during the war.''
She said she had been unable to have children because of hard labour
and poor nutrition at a camp in Sumatra.
Japan forced prisoners to work in shipyards, mines, and jungles in
violation of international regulations. Prisoners were also starved and
beaten, and some were executed.
The suit was filed at the Tokyo District Court on behalf of 25,000
other members of veterans' organisations.
For several years the Japanese Labour Camp Survivors' Association has
demanded compensation for each of its 12,000, mainly British, members.
Mr Day said legal action was a result of Japan's failure to show
sincerity to individual victims for half a century.
Japan has insisted that all war compensation issues were settled by
post-war treaties. Morally, however, Japan has not done enough, said Mr
Day.
The Government's emphasis on the US atomic bombings in August 1945 has
tended to make the Japanese public view themselves as war victims
instead of aggressors.
Japan had hoped the issue would be settled by a plan for a 10-year,
$1bn war atonement fund it announced last August, which would finance
regional educational and welfare projects.
After criticism from activist groups, the committee involved proposed
an additional plan which calls for individual direct compensation, but
only through a private fund.--AP

Macas, Ecuador, Monday
FOREIGN leaders today appealed to Ecuador and Peru to negotiate a
peaceful end to a half-century dispute over a mineral-rich region where
there have been four days of border skirmishes.
Ecuador today announced a new tax to pay for the war. The Government
ordered state employees to contribute two days' annual salary to help
pay for the cost of the renewed dispute, which centres on a 50-mile
portion of southern Ecuador and northern Peru near the Cenepa River.
Peru and Ecuador yesterday traded charges over who was the aggressor
in fighting that has claimed dozens of lives. Each country said it was
fighting on its own territory.
Sunday was the 53rd anniversary of the Rio Protocol that ended a war
between the two countries over their sparsely populated border. Ecuador
has never reconciled itself to the settlement, arguing it was robbed of
half its territory when a map delineating the region was agreed in 1942.
The latest fighting focuses on an unmarked portion of the border. The
disputed jungle area, known as the Cordillera del Condor, has gold,
uranium, and possibly oil reserves.
Paraguay President Juan Carlos Wasmosy announced today at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher would travel to Ecuador and Peru soon to try to mediate.
The Pope joined several other Latin American countries in urging a
peaceful settlement.
In Quito, Ecuador's capital, President Sixto Duran-Ballen said that
his country would not retreat and insisted that four bases under attack
with planes, helicopters, and mortars were on Ecuador's soil.
However Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has insisted the fighting
was taking place within Peruvian territory.
Ecuadorean officials said their forces shot down two Peruvian
helicopters, and that seven Peruvian soldiers were killed and two taken
prisoner in fighting yesterday.
Ecuadorean field commanders said 20 Peruvian and three Ecuadorean
soldiers were killed on Saturday. However television in Lima claimed a
death toll of 30 Ecuadorean and six Peruvian soldiers.--AP.

Sydney, Monday
THE man charged with firing a blank gun at the Prince of Wales in
Australia a year ago told police he expected to die during the incident
and was surprised no police had guarded the front of the stage.
In a filmed interview shown at a committal hearing in Sydney, David
Kang, 24, a student of Korean descent, told police that during the
incident he had carried letters to the Prince explaining his cause
because he thought there was ''a real possibility'' of his being shot
dead.
Kang had leapt unhindered on to the open-air stage on January 26,
1994, running at the Prince and firing two shots from a starting pistol
before being tackled by officials.
No-one was hurt but there was international criticism of security
arrangements.
Kang faces one charge of assault, and another charge of offensive
conduct is pending. The charge carries a maximum sentence of five years.
''I was surprised that there was not a policeman in front of the
stage,'' he said.
''I heard the starter pistol . . . once, then twice . . . I remember
sliding and then everybody just jumping on me.''
Kang said he decided to disrupt the ceremony at Sydney's Darling
Harbour to increase public awareness of the plight of Cambodian
refugees.
He made the decision after he had written to the Prince asking him to
visit the Villawood Detention Centre, where Cambodian refugees are held.
However Kang received a response from the Prince's private secretary
saying the Prince would not be able to visit the centre, where, Kang
claimed, what was happening was ''an atrocity . . . unjust''.
The hearing continues tomorrow.--AP/Reuter.

San Francisco, Monday
MORE than 180 people were arrested and at least two suffered bullet
wounds as celebrations of San Francisco's Super Bowl triumph turned
sour.
A police spokesman said 183 people were arrested last night as
thousands took to city streets to revel in the 49ers' record fifth Super
Bowl win, a crushing 49-26 defeat of the San Diego Chargers.
Most were arrested for public drunkenness, assaults, and for weapons
violations, police said.
''You name it, the whole gamut of laws has been violated,'' police
Commander Rich Holder said last night.
The most serious incidents were in the city's Mission District, where
thousands poured into the streets to toast the 49ers' victory.
Police said there were several drive-by shootings. In one case, two
teenage boys were wounded when a gunman in a car shot at their vehicle.
Another person was wounded in a stabbing, news reports said.--Reuter.

Grozny, Monday.
RUSSIAN forces shelled the battered Chechen capital Grozny again today
and moved more troops towards the city, but still made no headway
against defiant rebel fighters.
Moscow said the soldiers sent to Chechnya seven weeks ago to end its
bid for independence were preparing for a final attack on Grozny.
On the battlefront, however, the outgunned Chechen rebels have fought
the Russians to a standstill, and Chechnya's deputy Foreign Minister
said they would fight on.
Ruslan Chenayev said from an underground command centre in Grozny:
''We have enough ammunition to fight here forever. Only if they bring in
five times more troops can they maybe force us out.''
The Russians today settled for raining mortar and artillery shells on
the wreckage of the city every five seconds.
They have now pounded Grozny relentlessly since launching an assault
on the city on New Year's Eve.
''The Russians are avoiding direct contact. Their advantage is in
heavy weaponry. They are just trying to inflict terror on the population
by bombing and flying low in planes,'' Chenayev said.
The Russians say they are trying to avoid civilian casualties and
attacking only rebel positions. But civil engineer Lechar Khatuyev, who
left Grozny today, said they had shelled suburbs and a rural community
on the edge of the city.
Meanwhile officials from the Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe, just back from a fact-finding trip, said there
had been reports of human rights violations from both sides.
A senior aide to President Boris Yeltsin said the crisis had
encouraged other regions to press for more freedom from Moscow and
warned of trouble to come.
''While Russian troops are fighting for Russia's integrity in
Chechnya, behind their backs relations between the centre and Russia's
component states are sliding towards chaos,'' Leonid Smirnyagin told
Tass.--Reuter.

Los Angeles, Monday
THE chief lawyer of O J Simpson today claimed police ''contaminated,
compromised, and corrupted'' crucial evidence against the former
footballer turned film actor who is charged with two murders.
Lawyer Johnnie Cochran made the laims only moments after Judge Lance
Ito reprimanded him for breaking the law by withholding the names of key
defence witnesses from the prosecution.
After Ito told the jury to ignore Cochran's comments last week about
six new witnesses, Cochran made a scathing attack on what he called
police mishandling of the evidence.
Simpson denies killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her
friend, Ron Goldman, last June.
Cochran painted a portrait of comic ''Keystone Kops'' sloshing through
the blood of the victims, failing to call the right experts to the
scene, failing to protect the evidence, and ignoring Simpson's basic
rights.
Cochran said the police were so lax in handling evidence that vital
DNA blood samples were spread around ''without anyone knowing what was
happening'' and so many people were given access to Simpson's white Ford
Bronco that police wound up analysing their own coffee spills.
Prosecutors claim that DNA tests showed Simpson's blood and blood from
the murder victims were found in the car.
Before Cochran addressed the Los Angeles jury today, Judge Ito
reprimanded him for naming 14 witnesses last week the prosecution had
not previously been told about.
However, Cochran said in his opening statement: ''We think that the
evidence will show that the murder scene was tracked on, traipsed on, a
complete disaster. The evidence will be shown to be contaminated,
compromised, and corrupted.''
He said police at the scene failed to call the coroner's office until
six hours after the bodies were discovered. It then took the coronor's
office about four more hours to get to the scene and remove them.
He hinted that a key detective, Mark Fuhrman, might have planted
evidence -- a bloody glove found on the Simpson estate that matched one
at the crime scene -- and directly accused him of ignoring a witness
statement that might have thrown suspicion elsewhere.
He said that nowhere in the case would the jury find the mishandling
of the evidence stronger than in the police handing of the DNA evidence,
which is crucial in the absence of a murder weapon or witness.
''If the evidence was mishandled at the scene, it doesn't matter what
the tests show,'' he said. ''These small, minuscule amounts of DNA are
very easy to spread around. They can be moved from one place to another
without anyone knowing what is happening. This is how you get
contamination.''--AP

Rome, Monday
ITALIAN sports authorities today suspended all national sport next
Sunday in a response to the killing of a young soccer fan in an act of
violence that shocked the nation.
The unprecedented decision was taken at a meeting in Rome of top
officials from the National Olympic Committee (CONI) and the Italian
soccer league and federation.
''This was a painful decision, but it was a strong one and the correct
one. Italian sport wants to say 'enough to violence','' said CONI
president Mario Pescante. ''Whoever kills at the stadium, kills the game
of soccer.''
Genoa supporter Vincenzo Spagnolo, 24, was stabbed to death in
fighting outside Genoa stadium yesterday before the team's league match
against European champions AC Milan.
Police in the north-west port city today arrested a 19-year-old
apprentice gardener from Milan on suspicion of the killing.
The youth, named as Simone Barbaglia, was arrested at dawn at his home
in Milan and taken to Genoa, where he was being questioned by
magistrates.
The Genoa-Milan game was suspended at half-time with the score 0-0
after word of Spagnolo's death spread through the crowd. Twenty-seven
fans and police were injured in clashes outside the ground in
disturbances triggered by the killing.
The killing was the latest example of mounting violence that has
marred football, Italy's national sporting passion.
The CONI statement said Sunday's suspension would affect all national
sports activities, including professional league soccer.
It will not affect an international Davis Cup world group first round
tennis tie in Naples between Italy and the Czech Republic scheduled for
February 3 to 5, a tennis federation spokeswoman said.
The CONI statement said: ''The whole of Italian sport intends to state
its total rejection of all forms of violence. This unprecedented
initiative is designed to defend our image, our ideals, and ethical and
social values for which there is no substitute.''--Reuter

Amsterdam, Monday
TENS of thousands of people were tonight fleeing the ''flood of the
century'' as water swamped vast swathes of north-eastern Europe.
At least 25 people were reported to have died so far in a week of
torrential rainstorms and flooding -- 16 in France, six in Belgium, two
in Germany, and one in Britain. Five more people are missing in France.
Forecasters tonight predicted that more rain will rush in off the
Atlantic.
Water levels in the German cathedral city of Cologne, which straddles
the Rhine, have risen above the previous record at the end of 1993 and
officials expected the river to go on rising.
In the Netherlands the biggest civilian evacuation for more than 40
years was under way. More than 100,000 people were expected to heed
appeals to leave their homes in the south and east of the country
tomorrow morning.
Some 65,000 people in the eastern province of Gelderland were told to
flee the Rhine and more than 12,000 have already left their homes in the
province of Limburg, where the waters of the river Meuse spilled into a
90 mile long strip of land, flooding scores of towns and villages.
Roads were clogged today as thousands of cars, buses, and army trucks
headed out of the stricken area.
''This is the biggest Dutch evacuation for 40 years . . .
since 1953 when the sea dikes broke in Zeeland,'' said Jan Meijer,
spokesman for the Interior Ministry, which is co-ordinating the
evacuation. ''The evacuation (around) Nijmegen is unique. There's been
nothing like it there since the Second World War.''
At Lobith, where the Rhine enters the Netherlands from Germany,
officials said the water level had risen to 54ft above sea level, just
18in below its all-time record in 1926 when thousands of people drowned.
France said today it would provide emergency financial aid to victims
of flooding there.
''In many areas we are talking about the flood of the century,'' Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur's office said in a statement. ''Nearly half
the country has been affected.''
Concern also grew that high tides expected along the French Atlantic
coast could make the situation worse.
The French Government said 40,000 homes had been destroyed and nearly
800 roads damaged. In Paris roads along the Seine have been closed for
days.
In Cologne, the water level reached 32ft and sent more water gushing
into the old town.
About 30,000 Cologne residents have been affected by the floods so far
and with feverish efforts under way to keep the waters back, the
region's Environment Minister today pleaded for ''flood tourists'' to
stay at home and stop obstructing rescue work.
Germany's river Main also went on rising today and officials feared it
could flood historic parts of Germany's financial capital Frankfurt.
Belgian officials reported that the situation in the southern part of
their country was deteriorating, but evacuations had so far been kept to
a minimum. Emergency workers said this year's floods were fast reaching
the levels of December 1993, the worst for more than 60 years.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE body of an American Indian chief, buried in a British cemetery a
century ago, is to be returned to his descendants in the United States.
Little Wolf, a chief of the Sioux tribe, was buried in 1892 after he
died from bronchial pneumonia while working for Buffalo Bill's Wild West
Show on a site now occupied by the Earl's Court Arena in London.
His grave at Brompton Cemetery in west London was discovered some
years ago, and surviving members of the Sioux were tracked down to
inform them of his final resting place.
Descendants of Little Wolf, who is thought to have fought against
General Custer at the Battle of Little Big Horn, have now asked for his
remains to be returned to his homeland in South Dakota.
But workers at the cemetery could face problems in removing his body
from his grave, which is adorned with a string of Indian beads and a
feather left there by relatives last year.
The chief, whose name in Sioux is Schoonganoneta Hoska, is buried at a
depth of 13ft under the body of an Indian child named Star, who died
just after Little Wolf while also working for the show.
The cemetery superintendent, Mr Peter Weyell, said the exhumation
could not go ahead until permission had been granted by Star's relatives
in America to disturb her body as well.
He said the exhumation, which could cost more than #8000, would also
be a ''very complicated business'' because the ground had been disturbed
by other grave digs.

THE accused in the Safeway poison case, Dr Paul Agutter, went into the
witness box yesterday to deny repeatedly that he deliberately poisoned
his wife and covered his tracks by placing contaminated tonic water on
supermarket shelves without caring who bought it.
Dr Agutter also insisted that Ms Carole Bonsall, the new woman in his
life, was not putting him under any pressure to leave his wife and marry
her.
He denies trying to murder his wife, Alex, 39, by putting atropine in
her gin and tonic at their home at Kilduff Lodge, Athelstaneford, East
Lothian, on August 28 this year. He further denies placing tonic water
contaminated with atropine on shelves at Safeway's at Swanston,
Edinburgh, on August 24.
During more than two hours of evidence, Dr Agutter, 48, told the High
Court in Edinburgh that the only other ''crime'' he had been charged
with involved a parking ticket.
His counsel, Mr Neil Murray, QC, put to him evidence that suggested he
had the opportunity and the ability to obtain the poison and what the
tabloid press might regard as the motive to attempt to murder his wife.
''No, I had no motive,'' replied Dr Agutter, a lecturer in
biochemistry at Edinburgh's Napier University.
Mr Murray: You had a mistress, hadn't you? Dr Agutter: I would not use
that word.
Do you find that an offensive word? -- Yes.
Dr Agutter accepted Mr Murray's phrase that he had ''two ladies in his
life''.
He agreed he had spoken to turnkeys at Edinburgh Sheriff Court after
his arrest but denied admitting his guilt to them. He said the
conversation had taken place after three fellow prisoners set upon him
in the cells, giving him a cracked rib, two black eyes, a split lip, and
a loose tooth.
Dr Agutter agreed he might have been at Safeways on August 24 putting
two bottles of tonic water on shelves but said he had found them on the
floor.
Asked why he had not dialled 999 when his wife became ill on August
28, but simply left a message through his GP's answering service, Dr
Agutter replied: ''I take the view that our emegency services are badly
overstretched and I would only telephone 999 for an ambulance if I knew
I was facing an immediately life-threatening situation.''
He was asked to explain evidence which showed the concentration of
atropine in his wife's drink was markedly higher than the concentration
in a bottle of tonic he had bought at Safeway on August 24. Mr Murray
pointed out the obvious explanation was that the poison had been put
directly into his wife's glass.
Dr Agutter said another possible explanation was that powdered
atropine had been used to contaminate the tonic bottle and some of it
had become stuck around the neck before dropping into the glass when the
tonic was poured. That would have caused a higher concentration.
Questioned by Mr Andrew Lamb, Advocate-depute, Dr Agutter was reminded
about a meeting with his GP a week before the Safeway incident.
The GP gave evidence that Dr Agutter had felt suicidal because of a
number of problems, including the fact that he was under pressure to
leave his wife and marry Ms Bonsall.
''I never once felt under pressure from Carole of that sort,'' replied
Dr Agutter.
Mr Lamb: Is it not the position that your feelings towards your
situation persisted and that, as a consequence, you set out to poison
your wife deliberately?
Dr Agutter: No sir.
And, at the same time with a view to cover the tracks of what you were
doing, you adulterated tonic water at Safeways and allowed it to be put
on shelves regardless of who might buy the tonic with atrophine
poisoning in it? -- I did not do it.
That explains why the atropine in your wife's drink was substantially
higher than anywhere else. -- No sir, that's not the explanation.
The trial continues.

A STREAMLINED Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is to be
created to meet the needs of the 32 single-tier councils which will run
Scottish local government after April 1996.
A survey of opinion within councils and other professional
organisations has found continued support for the idea of an umbrella
organisation but deep dissatisfaction with the present internal
organisation of the 20-year-old Cosla.
As a result, a radical slimming down of its committee structure is
proposed in a ''White Paper'' published yesterday. The number would drop
from 14 to around four or five with a new strategy committee overseeing
areas like finance, personnel, Europe, and international affairs.
The report, however, is unlikely to end claims by some Conservatives
that Cosla is just a Labour talking shop.
It has rejected suggestions that Cosla should ensure opposition
parties are represented on council delegations. There will also be no
reduction in the number of convention officials -- currently 45 -- and
no cutting of Cosla's #2m budget.
Because of local government reorganisation, the number of councillors
is being reduced by around one third and the new Cosla would have 91
members instead of the present 152.
The blueprint, whose principal authors were Cosla vice president Keith
Geddes and Highland region's independent vice convener Peter Peacock,
will be considered by Cosla's annual conference in March.

A MOTHER and four of her young children died in a blaze at a council
flat where they were believed to be visiting a friend, it emerged last
night.
Miss Judy Newell, 25, her three sons, Nathan, seven, Courtenay, three,
Curtis, 23 months, and daughter Cassandra, six, were killed after fire
swept through the fourth-floor flat in Southwark, south-east London.
The brothers died in the fire, which started just after midnight
yesterday. Their mother died later at the burns unit of Queen Mary's
University Hospital, Roehampton, south-west London. Also later, their
sister died from injuries in the intensive care unit at Guy's Hospital.
Another of Miss Newell's children, Asheley, five, was last night in
Guy's, where his condition is said to be ''serious but stable''.
Police have arrested a man in connection with the blaze at the corner
flat in the six-storey Hartley House on the Longfield Estate.
A spokeswoman for Southwark council said it had no idea who the Newell
family were.
''We are aware they were visiting the tenant of the flat, but we have
no information about the family,'' she said.
Police last night were unsure about where Miss Newell had come from or
what she was doing in the flat, which was rented to three men in August
last year.
Other residents on the estate, who were awakened by the screams of the
trapped family, were stunned by the tragedy.
As the fire raged in the three-bedroom flat and Miss Newell screamed
for help, neighbours gathered blankets and bedding on the ground below
and urged her to throw down the children and jump herself.
But she was overcome by smoke, and by the time firefighters wearing
breathing equipment entered the flat, three of the children had
perished.
A man in the flat at the time of the fire, believed to be a relative,
escaped without help and was taken to Guy's suffering from the effects
of smoke.
Firefighters had to break through the front door and climb a ladder to
the window to reach the family. The fire appeared to have started in a
hallway, but the cause was not yet certain, a spokesman said.
Ms Sue Smith, 25, who lives on the third floor of Hartley House,
described an ''awful wailing'' which awakened her.
''I just heard the yelling and this awful noise. I thought at first it
was kids playing around, but then I thought a woman was being attacked.
''I opened my front door and everybody was screaming 'Fire, fire --
there's children in there'.
''It was the noise, this awful wailing. I don't think I will ever
forget that noise,'' she said.
Mr Ted Hogg, 82, called the fire brigade and police from his
ground-floor flat after he was awakened by the screams.
''It was terrible, absolute pandemonium. I saw the woman and the kids
hanging out of the window and I called the police. All the neighbouring
blocks were in darkness, but everybody was soon out of their flats when
they heard the screaming. It was awful.''
Post-mortem examinations will be conducted today at Greenwich
mortuary.

THE Princess of Wales yesterday came upon a six-year-old girl with
Aids she had met as a small HIV-positive baby not expected to live for
long. Their reunion was in a hospital in New York's Harlem district. The
girl is one of only two children who have survived since the Princess
last visited the unit in 1989. All the children have Aids after being
infected through their parents at birth. The Princess made the private
visit, organised at her request, after arriving by Concorde in New York
to attend a fashion awards ceremony. ''Diana showed great compassion and
sensitivity and it was a very moving moment when she met up again with
the little girl,'' a hospital official said.

A TEENAGER shot his girlfriend then turned the gun on himself after a
lovers' tiff
Ann McIntosh, 18, died from shotgun wounds in 19-year-old Mark
Nicoll's third-floor tenement flat in Dundee.
Police found the couple's bodies just before 3am yesterday.
They went to the flat after being contacted by a member of Miss
McIntosh's family who was concerned that she had not returned home.
A murder inquiry was launched but police later said they were not
seeking anyone in connection with the girl's death.
Mr Nicoll, who worked as a lift engineer, was described by a neighbour
as ''a bit weird''.
Mrs Jessie Bremner, 69, who lives across from the dead man's flat in
Blackness Road, told how she heard loud bangs on Sunday night.
''I heard a bang, it was so loud I nearly fell off my seat. I heard
two or three bangs, between 6pm and 11.45pm.
''I heard noises and music blaring very loud but I didn't go to his
door to complai.''
She added: ''Mark was friendly but I sometimes thought he was a bit
weird.''
Detective Chief Inspector Scott Robertson, the officer leading the
investigation, said: ''I can confirm that Ann McIntosh died from a
shotgun wound. We are not naming the second person found dead in the
flat but can confirm that he is a 19-year-old man.
''No other person is being sought by us in connection with this
incident. A report in connection with the deaths will be sent to the
procurator-fiscal at Dundee.''
Miss McIntosh worked in her father's insurance brokerage business in
Dundee where her mother is also employed.
Last night her parents were being comforted by relatives at the family
home at Greyburn, Benvie, near Invergowrie, Dundee.
A friend of Mr Nicoll said: ''I am just amazed to hear this. Mark was
always very presentable and polite. He was not involved in drugs or
anything like that.
''I can't imagine what must have sparked this. It is a real shock.''

AMID speculation that some anglers will breach a voluntary
conservation code and take to the River Dee to cast for salmon tomorrow,
an appeal has been made for them to leave their rods locked up.
More than 90% of the members of the Dee Salmon Fishing Improvement
Association, to which most of the 75 beat owners belong, approved a
conservation package which includes the postponement of the start of the
season from February 1 to March 1.
However, some members of the association, and some beat owners outwith
it, believe the scientists have got it wrong and have indicated they
will ignore the voluntary code.
Among them are time-share owners on the River Dee and one group is
understood to be planning what they see as a compromise solution of
fishing from February 1 but throwing back all the salmon they catch.
''Observation of the code is vital to the future of the River Dee as
Scotland's finest spring salmon river,'' said Mr Michael Bruce, of the
association. ''It is a package of inter-related measures which must be
adopted as a whole, not in part, and most pressing at this time is
support for the postponement of the season.''
He said the introduction of the measures followed extensive research
and scientific advice and was aimed at reducing the mortality of
dwindling stocks of spring salmon which enter the river at this time of
year.
Association chairman Captain Alwyne Farquharson said: ''The spotlight
is on us. The future depends on us. The clear message is conservation
and restraint. I therefore call upon you all to honour the pledge we
have given and to adhere strictly to the agreed voluntary code. Let us
stand firm together and be judged accordingly.''

<TEXT>
A JOURNALIST who wrote articles about last week's #3m robbery in
Dublin was shot at her home in the city last night.
Veronica Guerin was hit in the thigh but not seriously injured,
according to first reports.
She was shot by a heavily disguised man who called at her house in the
north Dublin suburb of Cloghran.
On Sunday, extensive background reports by Ms Geurin about last
Tuesday's raid on the Brink's-Allied security depot in Dublin appeared
in Ireland's Sunday Independent.
The reports included a detailed profile of the main suspect in the
case, the head of a Dublin criminal gang.
Last October there was another shooting incident at the Guerin home,
but no-one was hurt.
That followed reporting by Ms Guerin on organised crime, including the
shooting dead in Dublin of gangster Martin Cahill, known as The General.
He died after dealings with the IRA and other republican groups. He
was shot in his car a short time before the IRA declared its ceasefire.
Ms Guerin was alone in her home at the time of last night's shooting.
Her brother Jimmy, who visited her in Beaumont Hospital, said she was
in good spirits.
Ms Guerin's doorbell rang and she opened the door to the gunman, who
was wearing motor cycle gear, including a crash helmet.
Police said he carried a handgun, which he first pointed at the
journalist's head, before lowering his aim and shooting her in the right
thigh.
Ms Guerin, who is in her thirties, was also interviewed on Irish radio
last week about the man thought to have planned last week's security van
raid, Ireland's biggest cash robbery.
The chief suspect, known as Mr Clean because police have difficulty in
finding evidence to associate him with any crimes, lives with his young
family in Dublin.
The 31-year-old man has taken over from the murdered Martin Cahill as
the leading figure in Dublin's underworld.
He is believed to have plotted a #1.7m security van raid in Dublin
seven years ago.
Last Tuesday's armed raiders struck at the Irish headquarters of
Brink's-Allied minutes after the scheduled departure from the scene of
soldiers, who had escorted a security van during its day-long collection
of cash from banks throughout County Dublin.
The thieves broke through two metal fences and constructed makeshift
bridges over ditches to get to the haul. Detectives later said it was a
meticulous, well-planned operation.
Police denied reports that they had known in advance of plans for a
big armed raid, but late last week copies of a document disputing that
appeared in an Irish newspaper.
Justice Minister Nora Owen is expected to face questions about the
robbery -- and the attack on Ms Guerin -- in the Dail today.

<HEADLINE>Rifkind joins the 'realists' over Europe. Rifkind tips Cabinet balance towards the Euro-sceptics</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Malcolm Rifkind, one of the Cabinet's leading pro-Europeans,
yesterday joined the ranks of the so-called ''Euro-realists'' when he
led the Government's counter-attack against calls for greater EU
integration.
The Defence Secretary dismissed the federalist agenda of the new
European Commission president, Mr Jacques Santer, as an ideological
debate whose time had passed and he reinforced John Major's threats to
fend off more power for the European Parliament.
By taking his cue from the Prime Minister's increasingly tough line on
Europe, Mr Rifkind moved the balance in Cabinet further towards the
views of the Tory Euro-sceptics leaving Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Michael
Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke as the leading pro-Europeans.
But Mr Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, also seemed to fall in with the
more Euro-sceptic line Mr Major has decreed. In a Channel 4 interview he
said: ''We are not going to create a United States of Europe'' adding:
''We do not accept that in order to be good Europeans we have we have
got to keep moving power to the centre.''
He said he regretted the habit of putting labels on Ministers in
relation to Europe and said the Cabinet was united in seeking to create
a future Europe whose development Britain and the other members would be
comfortable with.
He dismissed the influence of the nine unwhipped Tory rebels as
''relatively small problem'' of party management.
Shortly before Mr Rifkind made his remarks in Brussels, Mr Hurd also
took the chance to cool speculation about his rumoured retirement. Mr
Rifkind has been tipped as the next Foreign Secretary but Mr Hurd made
it clear he intended to stay on to negotiate at the critical
inter-governmental conference on Maastricht 2 next year.
Dismissing Lord Howe's attack on the Government for bowing to the
Euro-rebels, Mr Rifkind told reporters the Conservatives were now
''virtually unanimous'' in seeing what kind of Europe they wished in
future. ''It is British interest rather than British influence which
should take precedence,'' he said.
He also rejected Lord Howe's claim that party divisions were now
dictating British policy in Europe although he conceded that differing
views were ''a fact that exists,'' adding: ''It is precisely because
there is a wide spectrum of views that there should be a healthy,
vigorous debate before decisions are reached.''
He emphasised that no decisions had been taken about the British
approach to the Maastricht 2 talks at last week's reportedly stormy
Cabinet meeting when Mr Hurd was said to have been rebuffed. ''Our
attitude is not hardening,'' he said. ''The views we are likely to
express are exactly comparable with the position the Government has
traditionally taken for years such as the importance of the veto, the
relevance of majority voting and the role of the European Parliament.''
In fact Mr Major has gone much further in the past few weeks in his
determination to block deeper EU integration. In a speech in the
Netherlands last year he set his face against any new powers for the
European Parliament and recently announced he would veto any move to
extend majority voting.
Mr Hurd carefully reworded that last week to any ''massive'' move to
give the parliament new powers and has been at pains to say he wants a
''root and branch'' review of voting rights in the Council of Ministers.
Later last night in a speech in Brussels Mr Rifkind said the EU was
entering a new and crucial stage. He argued it must evolve in a way
which allowed all Europe's peoples to feel ''comfortable'' in it. The
same, he said, applied to Britain in the EU.
''Nor is the new Europe going to be built on the federalist ambitions
of the 1950s and 1960s,'' he said. ''The time for that kind of
ideological debate has indeed passed. So I welcome the remarks made by
[French Prime Minister] Mr Balladur last November when he reminded us of
the sheer diversity of the European family, questioned whether Europe
must evolve towards a federal system and asked us to leave ancient
quarrels to one side. We now need to build effective mechanisms for
cooperation between states in addressing the challenges we face.''
In a doorstep interview with journalists outside the Foreign Office,
Mr Hurd said Britain must take a ''hard headed approach'' to future
developments in the European Union.
Mr Hurd dismissed a suggestion by one of the Tory rebels who have lost
the party Whip , Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), that he was
''yesterday's man'' and should stand aside in a summer reshuffle.
Meanwhile, Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, the leading Shadow
Cabinet Euro-sceptic, rejected the idea of an European super-state and
said attempts by some European leaders to promote a single currency by
1997 was ''totally irresponsible''.

<TEXT>
A CAR bomb killed 38 people and wounded 256 -- many of them children
-- as it ripped through a crowded street in central Algiers yesterday.
Security forces said Moslem fundamentalists, fighting to overthrow the
government, had planted the bomb which went off outside the police
station in Amirouche Street at about 3.20pm (14.20 GMT).
However, Omar Belhouchet, director of the El Watan newspaper, who has
himself narrowly escaped assassination, said a suicide bomber had driven
the car bomb straight at the police station.
''The explosion took place just when the street was full of children,
women, and old people. It is beyond barbarity,'' an announcer on
Algerian television said.
At the scene, bodies could be seen still burning and the street was
filled with shards of glass from shattered windows.
Women were screaming from injuries and fear as they searched for their
children near the police station whose walls were blackened.
A bus, caught in the explosion as it came from Martyrs Square along
the seafront, was twisted and burnt, as was the car believed to have
been carrying the bomb.
A witness, at the scene just three minutes after the blast sent shock
waves through the capital, said: ''I saw policemen splashed with blood
but I was not sure if it was their own blood or that of victims they
were trying to save.''
The explosion took place less than 24 hours after the armed wing of
Algeria's outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) told its militants to
increase their killings in the Moslem holy month of Ramadan
Amirouche Street forms a link between May First Square and Martyrs
Square -- the route taken by thousands of Algerians on Sunday,
protesting at ''terrorism'' and supporting the policies of president
Liamine Zeroual.
Zeroual has said presidential elections will be held this year to try
to resolve the crisis.

ENGLAND coach Terry Venables was at the centre of fresh trouble early
this morning after a Labour MP called for an independent inquiry into
the state of football.
In a short Commons debate MP Kate Hoey raised the names of four senior
English managers, including Mr Venables, as she demanded that the game
clean up its act.
The debate took place against the background of the recent violence
involving Eric Cantona and a number of other inquiries which, its is
thought, are in danger of bringing the game into disrepute.
Specific allegations raised last night by Ms Hoey, MP for Vauxhall,
centred on:
* Terry Venables, against whom she said the evidence in front of the
Premier League Commission of Enquiry was ''damning'', and who may, she
claimed, have acted in breach of the 1906 Corruption Act. She said there
certainly was clear evidence of breaches of the FA regulations in that
he knew an agent was acting for him while at the same time acting for
the players.
* The transfer of a player called Jensen from the Danish club Brondby
to Arsenal, currently under investigation. It is alleged that the Danish
club only took #900,000 and that the rest of the total price of #1.57m
paid by Arsenal went to a Guernsey company called Interclub, run by
Norwegian agent Rune Hauge.
Ms Hoey said: ''So therefore some #600,000 was paid out needlessly by
Arsenal and George Graham has not denied that he admitted to the Inland
Revenue that he received an unsolicited cheque -- a gift -- for
#285,000, which he has subsequently handed back to Arsenal.
''Other clubs are involved with the same agent and all of them bought
Scandinavian players. These clubs include Liverpool, Manchester United
and Oldham.''
* Allegations of wrong-doing and bribes involving the transfer of
Teddy Sherringham from Nottingham Forest to Tottenham, which she said
involved both Mr Venables and the former England team manager Brian
Clough.
''Claims that a transfer of two players back from Real Sociedad to
Aston Villa -- a #2m deal in total -- were subject to Inland Revenue and
other inquiries.
Ms Hoey said it gave her no pleasure to be initiating the debate, but
what she wanted to talk about was the many allegations which had yet to
be proved or disproved. She wanted more action to get to the bottom of
such matters.
She demanded: ''Perhaps the Minister can tell the House why the
Government is stopping short of a full inquiry into the evasion of
taxation by some football clubs. We know that already 15 Premier League
clubs have, under the Government formula, paid #16m in back tax and
penalties -- that is just over two years. So what would be owed if this
was extended over all the clubs in, say 10 years?
''Will the Minister confirm that there is an under-the-counter deal
being done so that the guilty clubs are being told unofficiallly
'co-operate, pay up and we will not pass on any information, not just to
other tax bodies but also where there is criminality to the police, and
crucially to the football authorities for their further action'.
''The important point for this House and the Minister to understand is
that not only is the taxpayer being ripped off but the supporter is
being forced to pay more as a result of dirty deals that cause money
which should be in the game to be syphoned-off in backhanders, bungs and
fixes.''
The Sports Minister, Mr Iain Sproat, said Ms Hoey had raised a number
of concerns involving financial irregularities and urged her to send all
the evidence she had to the appropriate authorities.
The FA Premier League had set up its own inquiries into allegations of
financial irregularities and had set up a Commission of Inquiry whose
membership included an independent QC. Mr Sproat said he was sure the
inquiry was conducting a thorough and rigorous investigation.
He told the House: ''The FA Premier League have made it clear there
will be no cover-up and that they want to produce long-term solutions
which will prevent a recurrence of these problems.
''I certainly agree that it would help public confidence if the
findings of the inquiry were made public, and I urge the Premier League
to make sure this is done.'' However, he added: ''I see no need for a
public inquiry. We will be monitoring the outcome of the current
inquiries very closely and I hope football will quickly clear its
reputation.''

A WOMAN told a court yesterday her husband turned her into a ''human
torch,'' leaving her severely disfigured.
Mrs Michelle Beattie, 31, sat in the witness box wearing a surgical
mask with eye holes, and gloves to protect her scarred hands.
She told the jury she fled to a neighbour's house when her husband
Leslie, 35, tried to choke her but returned because she was worried
about their five-year-old daughter, Gemma.
She fell asleep in the spare bed and woke to find Mr Beattie standing
over her with a petrol can and cigarette lighter in his hands, Durham
Crown Court was told. She said he sprinkled petrol on her clothes and
over the bed and carpet.
''He brought the lighter in front of me and kept threatening 'I'll do
it, I'll do it','' she said. ''I was terrified. I just froze.
''Every time he made a move I begged him please not to do this. There
was an evil look on his face -- hatred.''
The couple had decided to end their eight-year marriage after drifting
apart.
Mrs Beattie began an affair with a work friend while her husband was
on a holiday in Tenerife. Her husband could not bear the thought of his
wife with another man, it was alleged.
After Mrs Beattie went to sleep at their home in Taunton Place,
Cramlington, Northumberland, her husband is alleged to have carried
their sleeping daughter downstairs.
He went back upstairs and doused his wife with petrol siphoned from
his motorcycle, said Mr Paul Batty, prosecuting. Mrs Beattie heard
police cars speed into the street then footsteps racing up the stairs.
''As the police entered the room my husband shouted 'You bastards'.
The place just seemed to go up like a bomb. There was a big explosion,''
she said. ''I felt myself ignite. My whole body was ablaze. It was just
like slow motion.
''There was a mass panic to get out of the room. I knew I was on fire.
I could feel myself burning and I managed to get out and into the main
bedroom and roll into the duvet.
''I sensed that I put myself out. There was so much noise - banging
and explosions. The whole place seemed like a bomb had hit it directly.
I opened the bedroom door and the whole staircase was alight. I could
hear the central heating boiler and I thought I was going to die.
''The next thing I knew was somebody picking me up at the bottom of
the stairs and I was lying on the sofa.''
Mrs Beattie spent five weeks on a life support machine and faces years
of plastic surgery to her body, legs and feet.
Mr Beattie denies attempting to murder his wife and two charges of
arson with intent to endanger life in December 1993. He admitted arson
with being reckless as to whether life was endangered.
The trial continues today.

TELEVISION gladiator Shadow was sacked yesterday after a random drugs
test showed he had been taking anabolic steroids.
He admitted taking the steroids, but denied allegations in a Sunday
newspaper of taking cocaine.
''It's an absolute fabrication, it's absolute rubbish -- if they have
videos or pictures, where are they?'' said 32-year-old Shadow, real name
Jefferson King.
''I wish I had enough money to sue for libel but I don't, so I shall
just walk humbly away.''
Shadow admitted taking the steroids over five weeks during December
and January when the hit TV programme Gladiators was off the air.
''I was cheating myself,'' said the 19-stone bodybuilder. ''I did it
to get my body back up to par.'' He also blamed the pressure of his
marriage break-up.
However, he apologised yesterday to his millions of young fans and
said disappointing them was his biggest regret.
London Weekend Television producer Nigel Lythgoe said he felt ''let
down'' by Shadow. There had been nothing in any of the tests to indicate
he was taking cocaine.
''He is not being fired for cocaine abuse, he's being fired for
steroid abuse,'' he added.
The performer told a news conference at LWT's London headquarters:
''I'm very saddened to leave Gladiators and will miss all the friends I
have made.
''The pressure of the break-up of my marriage has taken its toll on my
physical appearance and I felt this would lead to righting that.''
He and his wife Olivia, who have nine-month-old twins, separated last
year.
Shadow said he believed his young fans would forgive him. ''I have had
problems in the past and managed to float above them. I hope I will
float above this.''
His future plans include opening a chain of fitness centres.
London Weekend Television's controller of entertainment John Kaye
Cooper said: ''It is with great regret that I have to announce his
contract has been terminated after testing positive for steroids in a
random drugs testing.
''From the official result a sample was found to contain three
anabolic steroids.''
Random drugs testing was introduced last May and Shadow is the first
Gladiator to have tested positive.

SCHOOL absence rates are worse in Scotland than in England, Education
Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said yesterday.
He was speaking after publication of the first national report of
attendance and absence in Scotland's 2400-plus primary and secondary
schools.
The Minister said that, in most respects, Scottish education was in
the lead and it was very important not to drop behind when it came to
school attendance.
The data confirms The Herald's reports earlier this month which showed
that, based on the statistics, truancy did not appear to be a big issue
in secondary schools.
Yesterday's report shows that unauthorised absence -- mainly truancy
-- is running at about 0.2% in the primary and 1.4% in the secondary
sector. Authorised absence -- which includes illness -- is 6% in the
primary and 10% in secondary schools.
But the senior chief inspector of schools, Mr Nisbet Gallacher, said
he was worried by the ''suprisingly high'' level of authorised absence
in some schools.
A combined authorised and unauthorised absence rate of 12% was equal
to each secondary pupil being absent for four out of the 38 weeks in the
school year.
There is concern about parents condoning their children's absence from
school and about some schools being ''too quick'' to accept parental
expanations for non-attendance.
The data shows that Castlebrae High has the highest proportion of
unauthorised absence, at 17%. Lothian region came to Castlebrae school's
defence, pointing out that the school's catchment had to be taken into
account before passing judgment.
Its headteacher, Mr William Crosbie, had been rigorous in cataloguing
non-attendance, an official said.
In common with John Street Secondary in Bridgeton, Glasgow, it has a
high incidence of deprivation, a recognised factor in high truancy
rates.
Lord James yesterday ruled out the use of social factors in the
compilation of attendance figures. Strathclyde region bases its schools'
absence ratings on an average drawn from 10 schools with similar social
backgrounds.
Publication of the Scottish Office data was condemned as a ''waste of
time and public money'' by Mr Fred Forrester, general secretary of the
Educational Institute of Scotland.
He said: ''The report is a statistical shambles because of the
numerous qualifications attached to the data by the Scottish Office.
Nobody could possibly draw any meaningful conclusions from it.''
The Scottish Office also published The Truancy File yesterday, a pack
aimed at helping teachers tackle truancy. It calls on shopkeepers to:
* Refuse to employ youngsters of school age during school hours.
* Inform the school if youngsters are obviously truanting.
* Work with the school on incentive schemes for good attenders.
Mr Archie McGlynn, head of the HM Inspectors of Schools audit unit
which brought together the attendance data, said: ''Truancy is not just
a school or a parental problem. It is a wider community problem, and we
should pull together to minimise it.''
