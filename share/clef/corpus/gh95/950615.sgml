WEEK-in-week-out, insolvency expert Hilary Lofthouse runs seminars
throughout Scotland for bankers, lawyers, and accountants to explain the
growing demand for a proper business rescue culture.
As head of corporate recovery at Pannell Kerr Forster in Edinburgh,
Hilary believes that her lecture work is absolutely crucial in educating
fellow professionals to think positively about insolvency practition.
Meanwhile, she agrees it is unusual to encounter a woman in such a
high-flying corporate role, even more so in Scotland, where she has been
a partner with PKF for the past year.
Hilary joined the CA firm in 1982 after six years in catering and
leisure work. Her time as a small hotel owner-occupier, she feels,
helped her to be perhaps a tad more sympathetic towards the plight of
the business in trouble.
What is even more surprising is that she has risen through the ranks
without a CA qualification, yet she regularly lectures to budding
chartered accountants in the ICAS headquarters in Queen Street,
Edinburgh.
Hilary still had to sit what have been described as the notorious
Joint Insolvency examinations, which she passed at the first attempt.
She has seen a decade of radical change in the Scottish insolvency
market.
Bluntly, Hilary says she is alarmed by the lack of knowledge within
the professions regarding insolvency issues such as Company Voluntary
Arrangements (CVAs).
''There has been much publicity recently concerning the need for
legislative change if CVAs are to be utilised to facilitate business
recovery.
''I welcome the bulk of the proposals but am still convinced that lack
of knowledge is the most significant factor contributing towards minimal
use of CVAs; less than a dozen times in Scotland since the arrangements
were introduced while it is now common practice south of the border.''
Hilary added: ''If professional advisors and financial institutions
know so little about CVAs how can they possibly identify companies who
may benefit by proposing one?''
CVAs by their nature do not conform to any standard style and often
require a high level of partner input.
Her words echo the sentiments of ICAS head of insolvency, Anne Bryce,
who has long preferred the phrase corporate recovery to insolvency.
Hilary said: ''Some of our most successful schemes have operated without
an administration order in place. This has enabled a company to get back
on its feet with minimal intrusion from the insolvency practitioner.''
She believes that in future, her profession will be expected to search
for more creative solutions to business problems: ''They must be willing
to work with both financial institutions and general business creditors
to achieve solutions, without exposing creditors to further risk.''
Hilary did originally plan to gain a CA qualification but got
sidetracked into insolvency. ''I very quickly became addicted to the
work,'' she said. ''The opportunity to heal and variation of work,
together with the physical and mental challenges, make this work rather
special.
''In insolvency, the prime objective should be to seek ways in which a
business can be saved. However, ultimately if it comes to the point
where this is not possible, there has to be a requirement to follow
through both economically and efficiently, but with regard to the human
features involved.
''It goes beyond monetary issues,'' she explains. ''The creditors have
lost their customer, the employees their jobs, whilst the directors have
lost seomething they have perhaps thrown their heart at. So, there are
very personal issues at stake.''
One good sign for prospective Scottish businesses is that Companies
House in Edinburgh recently reported that new Scottish companies are
registering in Scotland at the rate of 150 every week.
So, as she prepares for her next seminar, this time at a major bank,
Hilary is heartened by what she sees as positive Government reform
proposals towards

IN culinary terms, his product is la creme de la creme -- selling in
top stores, restaurants, and delicatessens throughout the country, from
London to the Orkney islands.
John Balfour returned from Argentina to Scotland with an delicacy
which has been tempting taste buds throughout the country, and at
exhibitions including London and the Glasgow Food Show.
Mr Balfour, whose great grandfather emigrated from the Borders to find
work in Argentina, discovered the secret of his product, dulce de leche,
while attending agricultural college in Buenos Aires province.
He came to Scotland a few years ago to secure a better education
for his family.
Currently, he is producing 150 kilos a week of his product which he
describes as a type of curd.
''It is commonplace in most Argentinian homes, where there are not so
many varieties of soft fruits available,'' he said.
As head stockman at the farm where he works at Balerno near Edinburgh,
the owners encouraged him to go ahead with his commercial venture, which
led to the importing of equipment from Argentina for the process.
The dish can be taken as dessert, or as a spread.
Said Mr Balfour: ''I am very pleased with the way my market is going,
and that some 30 outlets have taken an interest in the product.''

David Steele reports on a company thriving on sailing close to the
wind and yactsmen who like the cut of their jib
WHEN John Highcock led a crew of seven to success in sailing's
prestigious Scottish Series he took more than a passing interest in the
performance of the sails which helped the Crusader yacht to six wins and
the Rover Trophy.
For John and his partner Colin McKenzie are the driving forces behind
Saturn Sails, based at the harbourside in Irvine and rapidly making a
name among sailing's top echelons.
He is modest about the success in the long weekend of tough sailing
off the West coast of Scotland but there is no doubt that the
performance of the sails has turned heads among the close fraternity of
competitive yacht racing.
Said John: ''I was delighted with the win and even more so that I was
given the chance to see one of our designs performing so well. We are in
the business of making boats go faster and perform better, and that
happened in the case of the Crusader.''
The road to success has been a long one with both exchanging their
jobs with leading English sailmakers for the risky business of setting
up on the shores of the Firth of Clyde, first at Ayr before moving up
the coast to Irvine in 1985.
Colin McKenzie explained: ''We were both a bit tired of the mass
production end of sailmaking and wanted to offer a service to both
racing and cruising sailors who wanted something a bit different.
''We looked all around the UK and found a gap in the market here on
the Clyde. There is certainly a demand here and we are finding that the
word is getting around with customers from other parts of Scotland and
England contacting us.''
Both partners have been happy with the slow growth of the company from
start-up to an annual turnover in excess of 250,000 and the employment
of seven at the small factory a stone's throw from the sea at Irvine.
John, a former boy and youth national champion and Olympic squad
member, said: ''We are in the bespoke side of the industry with
customers telling us their requirements and seeking a made-to-measure
service.
''You can go to Marks and Spencer for a suit which will do the job but
if you go to Savile Row tailor you will get something a little
different.''
Their bespoke service stretches to examining the existing sails and
using CAD/CAM computer technology to design the best alternative taking
into account the size of the boat and the requirements of the sailor.
Despite the sophisticated technology, the team at Saturn Sails still
see their products as hand made and each sail is finished in a variety
of high-performance fabrics with high-quality fittings.
Both men take time to sail with customers and talk to crews about how
best to use the sails once Saturn has designed and fitted them to the
boat.
While growth remains steady, and the temptation to expand too much too
fast is resisted, there has been some diversification for the company.
Large local firms such as British Aerospace, ICI, and Beecham hae
sought its specialist assistance in providing industrial coverings.
Said John: ''It has been interesting to deal with other companies and
move into other fields and I am sure there will be more diverse products
to come in the future.''

A mix of interior design and painting is being given new expression as
Janet Reid finds depth and vision in the return of the mural
MAKE an enormous, imaginative leap into history. Take a stroll through
the streets of Renaissance Florence. In every church, palazzo, and
villa, the walls are alive with glorious frescoes, vivid and colourful
murals which represent scenes from the Bible, illustrations from
literature, classical myth and philosophy, and imaginative landscapes.
Pitch yourself back another couple of millenniums: on the walls of
your house in Pompeii or Herculaneum there are murals again. This time
portraits, still lifes, allegorical themes, and scenes from nature
surround you. Further back still, in your cave in Altamira in Spain,
some 100,000 years ago, the walls are painted in striking
representations of bison, elks, and other species.
Now, today, after a couple of centuries when murals seem to have gone
out of fashion, painting on walls is making a come-back. Evidence for
this is the thriving mural business created three years ago by Graham
McKenzie-Smith in Glasgow. He makes no claims to being a Piero della
Francesca or a Michaelangelo but he is, nonetheless, in great demand for
his skill in transforming any interior with murals.
The reason for the successful execution of so many contracts, and the
consequent growth in his business, lies in the fact that not only is he
a skilled artist with paint but also that he trained as an interior
designer. Because mural painting is different from other forms of
pictorial art -- it is organically connected with architecture so that
colour, design and theme can radically alter the sense of spatial
proportions within a building -- McKenzie-Smith's qualification in
interior design from the Glasgow College of Building has been
invaluable.
In fact, after graduating eight years ago, he worked for five years as
an interior designer. He worked on a large variety of contracts -- shop
fittings, office refurbishments, space planning and so on. In every case
the creation of illusion and atmosphere within a defined space was of
the essence. Meanwhile, in his spare time he was painting watercolours
-- scenes that appealed to him such as Scottish mountain landscapes and
tree-lined Italian city squares -- and selling them at Scottish craft
fairs.
In 1992, a college friend introduced him to the Italian owner of the
Avonbridge Hotel in Bothwell. The latter wanted a mural which would
create an Italian atmosphere in his function room, and McKenzie-Smith
jumped at the chance. His was the perfect opportunity for him to marry
his creative artistry and his interior designing skills. This first
commission -- a landscape of wide sky and steep mountains based on a
painting by Claude Lorrain -- was soon followed by more. Claude's
arrival of the Queen of Sheba was the inspiration for the next mural
which he painted.
Word soon spread, and Vitelli and Vitelli were so impressed by his
feel for things Italian that they asked him to create a more spacious
and Mediterranean atmosphere to the conservatory part of their bistro in
the Italian Centre in Glasgow.
Since then he has executed a variety of commissions: for Italian
restaurants which need Tuscan hills, cypress trees, and burnt orange
roof-tops to create the illusion of southern sunshine; or for a
different Italian ambiance, light dappling through autumn trees on to a
square in Venice provides the inspiration. He has also painted murals
for individuals in their homes, and he is keen to extend his range in
this market. For a client's bathroom he painted a Renaissance-inspired
mural of a lady pouring water from a pitcher. For another client he has
painted pillars, columns, and classical paintings, all of which make for
an entirely original and unusual interior. And his most recent work is
for a palatial villa in the Algarve where he has been given a completely
free hand to create classical and three-dimensional effects in hall,
stairway and bedrooms. These mural trompes l'oeil will break up the
blankness of newly plastered walls, disguise ventilator grilles and lend
warmth, originality, and atmosphere to a new home.
McKenzie-Smith's charges for his distinctive interior decoration are
very reasonable. At #20 per hour, his clients, he believes, are getting
a genuine bargain: for his transformations are effected at great speed.
After measuring and drawing the perspectives, he paints the design on
paper. But instead of transferring it by means of a grid, he relies on
his eye to repeat the effect on the actual wall.
Within two or three days the new customer can be transported from the
plainness of an undecorated room to a balustraded balcony with pots of
geraniums looking down over roof-tops to a blue Mediterranean. With only
the tiniest leap of the imagination the customer can find himself
sitting on his balcony in Sorrento.

COMMERCIAL property advisers in both Edinburgh and Glasgow should see
a sharp increase in business over the next 12 months but most of the
work will go to national firms of chartered surveyors rather than to
local agents, according to the 1995 Chartered Surveyors Survey published
this week.
This year the survey questioned 927 organisations throughout the UK
representing the nation's 3000 largest property owners, occupiers,
investors, developers, and users.
The results provide a revealing insight into how the property industry
views its professional advisers, agents, and consultants.
When asked in which regional centres their organisations would place
most business with national firms of surveyors in the next year,
Edinburgh topped the poll, with 42% of respondents saying they intended
to place business with national firms in the capital.
Glasgow came fifth in the UK rankings, with 34% of companies saying
they intended to place work with national firms in the city.
When asked to predict which British regional cities would see an
increase in market activity, 44% said that Edinburgh would see an
increase, some 50% said the market would stay the same, while only 6%
predicted a decrease. Glasgow showed a similar result, with 40%
predicting an increase in market activity and only 7.5% foreseeing a
downturn.
A mini-boom was predicted for Birmingham where 59% of respondents
predicted an increase in activity.
A key factor in commercial property services over the last 10 years or
so has been the inexorable advance of national firms of surveyors into
regional cities. When asked which regional centres are well served by
their present mix of national, regional, and local surveyors, both
Glasgow and Edinburgh scored 35%.
Manchester came out on top with a 51% satisfaction level. Birmingham,
Leeds and Bristol all came higher than Glasgow and Edinburgh in the
rankings. However, only about 10% of respondents felt that Glasgow and
Edinburgh would benefit from the arrival of additional firms of national
surveyors, a sign that Scotland's key commercial property markets are
now saturated with surveyors.
In the annual awards section of the survey, King Sturge came out on
top followed by DTZ Debenham Thorpe, Chesterton, Grimley, and Gerald
Eve.
The highest ranked Scottish independent firm was Ryden, which came
34th out of the top 150 firms in the UK, an improvement from last year's
42nd position. Ryden also scored well in the league tables of firms
highly recommended for a variety of services including the acquisition
and disposal of property, rent reviews, and lettings.
The survey reveals a high level of dissatisfaction among clients about
the services they receive from their property advisers. When asked to
score surveyors for effort and ability, the results were poor. Only 51%
of firms were recommended for providing a first-class service, and the
same precentage for charging fair fees.
When it came to recommending firms for the personal involvement of
partners or directors, only 45% were given the seal of approval, while a
mere 33% were recommended for the ability of their professional staff.
Nor was there a high confidence in the ability of firms to provide
accurate property advice (23% were recommended) or to understand their
clients' businesses (21% were recommended). Only 12% of firms were
recommended for ''saving or making money for their clients''.
It is clear from these results that a beleagured profession is not
addressing its clients' needs as effectively as it should.
The estimated UK total expenditure by corporate clients on the
services of chartered surveyors, commercial agents, and property
consultants over the last 12 months was #1008.5 million, a 3.5% increase
on the #974 million the previous year.
The monetary value of commercial property services has increased by
only 11.7% since 1992, when total spend was #903 million.

BUILDERS' merchant Graham Group is buying rival Erith for 109.2p a
share through a share swap, valuing the whole company at #55.4m.
Graham, which was founded in Glasgow in 1936 but is now based in
Huddersfield, announced last week that it was considering an offer.
It is understood that the statement was made at the request of the
Takeover Panel following a marked rise in the Erith share price.
Yesterday Erith rose 28p to 105p.
The terms of the offer, for which there is a full cash alternative of
104p a share, are three new Graham shares for every five Erith shares.
This represents a premium of 65.4% over Erith's price of 66p just ahead
of last week's announcement.
Irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer have been received from
Erith directors and other shareholders owning in aggregate 13.4% of
Erith's issued share capital. There are also letters of intent to accept
from shareholders holding in aggregate a further 22.2%.
Erith is expected to make a positive contribution to Graham's earnings
per share in 1996 and thereafter. Commenting on the offer, Gordon
Yardley, chairman of Graham, which has 151 branches nationwide although
it is not strong in the South East, said: ''The acquisition of Erith
will create real value for the shareholders of both companies.
''Our business is highly complementary. Their integration will
significantly advance our strategy of increasing market share and
purchasing efficiency and will strengthen our branch network.''
Bryan Castledine, chairman and chief executive of Erith, which has 43
branches, mainly in the London area though it has expanded recently into
the Midlands and East Anglia, said: ''The fit of our branch networks and
product ranges is excellent, and their combination will create a
significant force in the industry. This offer not only provides full
value for shareholders but will also bring exciting opportunities for
the enlarged group.''
Looking at the industry, Graham and Erith say that notwithstanding a
modest improvement in the overall UK economy, the housing market has
been slow to recover, limiting the ability of builders' merchants to
grow sales. Industry forecasts indicate that the builders' merchant
market may have entered a period of long-term low inflation and
low-volume growth.
It is felt that in this environment, builders' merchants will not be
able to rely on a rapid growth in turnover resulting from a return of
the inflationary cycle. Instead, any growth will have to come from
operating efficiencies, marketing expertise and increasing market share.
Against this background, Graham and Erith believe that a combination
of their two businesses ''has clear commercial logic''. Erith will be
bowing out at 28.1 times its 1994 earnings per share.

GRANT Mitchell started using his buying and selling acumen early,
which perhaps explains why, at the age of 23, he owns his own jewellery
shop.
He started selling cheap rings while studying at Glasgow Academy and,
when he was not selling jewellery to his schoolmates, he was organising
discos for them.
After leaving school he studied gemology at North Glasgow College in
Springburn for a year before getting a job with an antique jewellery
firm, and by the age of 20 was managing one of their shops.
However, Grant still had the entrepreneurial bug and, using his
savings of #250, opened a stall in the Camden Marketin London selling
costume jewellery.
''I went round all the other stalls and looked at what they were
selling and bought the same type of stock. I then bought a paste
board,'' says Grant, ''and lined it with velvet to use as display
boards.''
Most weeks he sold #300-#400 worth of stock.
On a visit to Glasgow eighteen months ago, Grant spotted an empty shop
in the Argyll Arcade.
He convinced wholesale jewellers to back him, and arranged a loan to
redecorate the premises and invest in a three-tonne safe costing #2500.
''My turnover has doubled since I opened, and I am very pleased with
the way business has gone,'' says Grant.
''The average ring I sell costs #1000, which is very good compared to
the industry average of #375,'' says Grant.

SCOTTISH sausage skin manufacturer Devro International has firmed up
an agreement to buy its larger US rival Teepak International, but the
shares-plus- cash deal remains subject to approval by the US and UK
authorities.
Devro, which is based at Moodiesburn near Glasgow, said it had agreed
a final purchase price of $133.5m.
This is slightly less than the $135m envisaged when it reached an
agreement in principle with Teepak's present owners, Hillside
Industries, in March.
Devro chief executive Graeme Alexander said this was a result of
technical adjustments as details of the agreement were hammered out, but
there had been no major changes.
''All we are signalling now is that the agreement has become legally
binding, subject to the raising of finance and the agreement of the
competition authorities,'' Mr Alexander said.
The next step is clearance from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
and the UK Office of Fair Trading.
Mr Alexander said FTC approval is now expected in late July. Devro
will then call a shareholders' meeting to approve the deal and the
financial engineering necessary to pay for it.
Devro plans to use #20m of cash reserves and raise #28m from a share
sale to institutional investors. In addition it will raise up to #80m in
bank loans.
The definitive purchase agreement stipulates that Devro will pay for
Teepak with 10.4 million Devro Ordinary shares, $52.3m of
dollar-denominated voting redeemable Convertible Preference shares and a
cash lump sum of $46m.
The cash payment will be reduced if any of Teepak's outstanding $35m
of 10.425% loan notes have not been redeemed by the completion date.
Devro will assume responsibility for up to $155m of Teepak's debt.
The acquisition will enable Devro to diversify its product range,
increase its production capacity and extend its penetration of North
American and eastern European markets.
The US company had sales of #205m last year, compared to only #98m at
Devro, but has suffered flat sales and declining profits for the past
three years.
Devro, although much smaller, is growing fast and enjoys a much
stronger financial position.

<HEADLINE>NFC maintains dividend despite #200,000 loss. Grocery distribution contracts undermine prospects</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ANDREW WILSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<FLAG>SCOTLANDS BUSINESS</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>977879180</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NFC has more than its fair share of problems and it will be two to
three years before it achieves an adequate level of profits to start
increasing dividends again. That is hardly surprising after it incurred
a pre-tax loss in the first six months of #200,000 against a prior year
profit of #50.7m.
It has maintained the second interim dividend at 1.5p, which with the
first-quarter payment means a cash outflow of #20.1m.
This may be a sign of confidence but it is offering a hostage to
fortune unless there is rapid recovery.
But NFC is shooting itself in the foot. By accepting grocery
distribution contracts from the major supermarket groups with only half
the margins of those which have recently expired, it has depressed the
prospects for medium-term recovery and undermined future renewals.
Fortunately, it has two assets. It has a ''toughie'' as chairman in
the burly shape of former LWT supremo Sir Christopher Bland, while chief
executive of all of nine working days Gerry Murphy looks and sounds like
a no-nonsense man. Certainly it was refreshing to hear him say there
will be no more truck with consultants and that tactics will instead
dominate group thinking.
However, he has taken the opportunity -- as is the wont of new chief
executives at troubled companies -- to make massive write-offs. These
amount to #35m and largely relate to further redundancies, although the
number is unspecified, and the closure of 30 depots in Britain and
warehouses in Germany and the US.
This brings the provisions total to #57m of which #37m is a cash cost
for a company which has swung from a credit balance of #10.5m into
#95.2m of debt, even though it has spent #120m on acquiring assets in
the last year.
Trading has seen margins fall in the UK at Exel and BRS because of the
renewals problems although new business has grown by #57m. This has
given rise to fears that NFC had been taking on contracts under the
previous management with insufficient regard to profitability.
Business lost includes Wm Low after the Tesco takeover.
The Frigoscandia acquisition in Germany is something it could have
done without -- its losses have escalated to #4.6m.
UK housemoving in the quieter half of the year was inevitably
depressed given the overall state of the market, although commercial
moving was strong.
Lynx, which has in the past been a source of internal dissent at NFC
with some board members wanting to sell it off, saw its losses halve to
#2.1m on turnover 11% greater at #46.2m.
That is out of a group total 9.3% higher at #1124m, pointing to the
Bland argument that for a business with a #2000m annual turnover a 1%
improvement in margin has a dramatic effect.
The US was down, partly because of bad debts and an unusually high
number of claims.
NFC is the largest of the seven significant logistics companies in
Britain, being twice as big as Tibbett &amp; Britten and Unigate's
Wincanton. Its management has taken its eye off the ball in three or
four cases.
Altogether the industry leaders account for just over 40% of the
sector and there does seem scope for negotiated rationalisation,
particularly involving dedicated distribution centres, which would also
help address the margin problem. That is being helped by the move into
new areas of activity to reduce the dependence upon the wily grocers.
The Bland approach to overheads is underlined by cutting the cost of
the annual meeting from the usual #250,000 to just #31,000. The old
almost paternalistic NFC culture is disappearing fast even if half the
workforce of 34,000 still owns about #100m of shares. Life is going to
be much tougher for those that remain, but at least there will be less
prevarication and indecision.
At 164p, down 5p, the shares yield 5.4% on the probably maintained
7.1p payout.

THE TrailBlazer scheme has come to the end of its third successful
year and there are 11 very strong contenders for the title of
TrailBlazer of the Year 1995, to follow 1994 winners, Petroline Wireline
Services Limited, of Aberdeen.
The judges, Liam Kane, chief executive of Caledonian Publishing
Limited, John Ker, head of Owner Managed Business Services at Ernst &amp;
Young's Glasgow office and Fraser Innes, technical director of
Petroline, are currently making their deliberations.
Over the next three weeks, we will look back at the 11 very-varied
monthly TrailBlazers and at the start of July, we will announce the
overall winner, who secures a place on an agreed specialist management
course at the renowned Harvard Business School in the USA.
BACK in July last year, Stirling Management Centre, the purpose-built
conference and management training centre on the campus at Stirling
University, won the award for business performance and marketing
ability.
The centre has set new quality standards for management training,
demonstrated by the continual increases in the number of people using
the facilities. In addition, the centre has ensured access to a growing
clientele by diversifying outwith the main training season to target
groups beyond its core sector.
In August the award went to the Glasgow-based Lewis Group. Having
found it impossible to find any off-the-shelf packages suitable for
their needs, the debt services specialist developed their own unique
computer software system, Account Tracker, which has been highly
successful.
The company has also made a series of very prudent acquisitions,
diversifications and investments, which has allowed the group to expand
from its core debt collection business into sales ledger management,
telemarketing, investigations, revenue services for local authorities
and parking enforcement.
The September winner could be said to have success all tied up. As
Scotland's only shoe and insole manufacturer, supplying laces, braids
and tapes to the footwear manufacturing industry and laces and soles to
the retail trade, William Paton Limited, of Johnstone, has seen turnover
increase by 25% over the last three years, despite growing imports,
principally from the Far East.
The deployment of world-class manufacturing techniques led to a 90%
cut in work-in-progress, as well as a reduction from eight days to
half-a-day in throughput time for insoles. A #1.2m investment to update
equipment and machinery, together with packaging redesign, has also led
to new success.
British Telecom, the Post Office, the Automobile Association,
electricity boards and police forces are only a few of the big names
benefitting from an association with October winner, Edward Macbean &amp; Co
Ltd, of Cumbernauld.
Manufacturers of high-quality waterproof and protective clothing, the
company has set its sights on becoming the worldleader in this
specialised field.
In the past 18 months, turnover and staffing levels have increased
dramatically, primarily due to a decision to enter Europe.
* Next week, we look back at a company which makes environmentally
friendly ''silk purses out of sow's ears'', we ring the changes in
communication, review a sight for sore eyes and look at gowns with a
difference.
The award and
how to enter

VICO Properties plc of Glasgow has bought the Grianan office building
at Dundee Technology Park for #1.15m.
The 12,400 sq ft modern office pavilion is fully let. Tenants include
United Dominion Trust (a subsidiary of TSB) and a rental income is
approximately #90,000, with rent reviews due on all of the space.
Colin Taylor, Vico's property director, said: ''Dundee Technology Park
has been very successful and with recent lettings on the park, the
investment is considered to be highly reversionary. The acquisition
helps build up our asset base, alongside our substantial development and
trading activities.''
Vico was represented by Richard Ellis. The company recently sold an
office investment in East Kilbride to an undisclosed purchaser for
#800,000, reflecting a yield of 7.75%. The property, which is let to
Honeywell Control Systems on a long lease, produces a rent of #64,000
with a rent review due in November next.
National firms to benefit
from surge in property
By STEWART McINTOSH
COMMERCIAL property advisers in both Edinburgh and Glasgow should see
a sharp increase in business over the next 12 months but most of the
work will go to national firms of chartered surveyors rather than to
local agents, according to the 1995 Chartered Surveyors Survey published
this week.
This year the survey questioned 927 organisations throughout the UK
representing the nation's 3000 largest property owners, occupiers,
investors, developers, and users.
The results provide a revealing insight into how the property industry
views its professional advisers, agents, and consultants.
When asked in which regional centres their organisations would place
most business with national firms of surveyors in the next year,
Edinburgh topped the poll, with 42% of respondents saying they intended
to place business with national firms in the capital.
Glasgow came fifth in the UK rankings, with 34% of companies saying
they intended to place work with national firms in the city.
When asked to predict which British regional cities would see an
increase in market activity, 44% said that Edinburgh would see an
increase, some 50% said the market would stay the same, while only 6%
predicted a decrease. Glasgow showed a similar result, with 40%
predicting an increase in market activity and only 7.5% foreseeing a
downturn.
A mini-boom was predicted for Birmingham where 59% of respondents
predicted an increase in activity.
A key factor in commercial property services over the last 10 years or
so has been the inexorable advance of national firms of surveyors into
regional cities. When asked which regional centres are well served by
their present mix of national, regional, and local surveyors, both
Glasgow and Edinburgh scored 35%.
Manchester came out on top with a 51% satisfaction level. Birmingham,
Leeds and Bristol all came higher than Glasgow and Edinburgh in the
rankings. However, only about 10% of respondents felt that Glasgow and
Edinburgh would benefit from the arrival of additional firms of national
surveyors, a sign that Scotland's key commercial property markets are
now saturated with surveyors.
In the annual awards section of the survey, King Sturge came out on
top followed by DTZ Debenham Thorpe, Chesterton, Grimley, and Gerald
Eve.
The highest ranked Scottish independent firm was Ryden, which came
34th out of the top 150 firms in the UK, an improvement from last year's
42nd position. Ryden also scored well in the league tables of firms
highly recommended for a variety of services including the acquisition
and disposal of property, rent reviews, and lettings.
The survey reveals a high level of dissatisfaction among clients about
the services they receive from their property advisers. When asked to
score surveyors for effort and ability, the results were poor. Only 51%
of firms were recommended for providing a first-class service, and the
same precentage for charging fair fees.
When it came to recommending firms for the personal involvement of
partners or directors, only 45% were given the seal of approval, while a
mere 33% were recommended for the ability of their professional staff.
Nor was there a high confidence in the ability of firms to provide
accurate property advice (23% were recommended) or to understand their
clients' businesses (21% were recommended). Only 12% of firms were
recommended for ''saving or making money for their clients''.
It is clear from these results that a beleagured profession is not
addressing its clients' needs as effectively as it should.
The estimated UK total expenditure by corporate clients on the
services of chartered surveyors, commercial agents, and property
consultants over the last 12 months was #1008.5 million, a 3.5% increase
on the #974 million the previous year.
The monetary value of commercial property services has increased by
only 11.7% since 1992, when total spend was #903 million.

Following a chance meeting in the stand, on-field heroes are being
tackled by a video team with a fine match of talents
A CHANCE conversation at a football match three years ago between
Chris Cameron and John Williams put Cameron Williams, a one million
pound video business, on the road.
Chris Cameron was already running Cameron Communications in Glasgow
which, among other things, duplicated and edited Rangers Football Club
videos.
John Williams was the area sales manager for a UK video company based
in London. ''We got on well together,'' says Chris Cameron, ''and we saw
a good market for Scottish-produced sports videos''.
Cameron Williams was formed as a division of Cameron Communications,
and a series of successful videos followed. First off the production
line came Super Cooper, charting the football career of Davie Cooper,
which went on sale in October 1992.
''David Cooper became a friend,'' says Chris Cameron, ''and we had
talked about him joining the company in some capacity when he retired
from football''.
The tragic death of the Motherwell, Rangers, and Scotland footballer
meant that these plans were never fulfilled but both men still remember
Davie Cooper with a great deal of affection.
After Super Cooper came Jinky, highlighting the maze-like runs of
former Celtic star Jimmy Johnstone, and Wee Willie featuring Willie
Henderson of Rangers.
Later this month Cameron Williams will launch Rangers Seventh Heaven,
documenting Rangers' seven league championships in a row.
Plans are also under way for Celtic On the Road Again, to celebrate
the club's Scottish Cup victory.
The company has also signed an agreement with Scotland rugby skipper
Gavin Hastings to produce a video on his rugby career. He retired from
rugby after Scotland's defeat by the All Blacks in the quarter finals of
the Rugby World Cup in South Africa last week. Other projects in the
wings are videos on John Greig, the former Rangers captain and manager,
and Billy McNeil, the former skipper and manager of Celtic.
At the moment, the company is working on videos featuring Motherwell,
Airdrie, and Dunfermline. They are also poised to make their first
venture into the English market with a video on Robbie Fowler of
Liverpool.
The company has a turnover of over #1 million a year, and employs six
people.
However, not all of the company's success is due to football videos.
Cameron Williams have made a number of other titles, such as Carol Kidd
Live in Concert.
Chris Cameron says: ''We would like to increase the non-sporting
activities, and we already have a number of successes in non-football
areas.''
Their biggest selling production is Only an Excuse? '93, starring Tony
Roper and Jonathan Watson, which sold almost 50,000 copies and outsold
The Jungle Book in Scotland in the run-up to Christmas 1993.
John Williams says: ''We film the show live in the Pavilion which we
hire for the occasion, and Tony and Jonathan take the mickey out of
everyone.''
Cameron Williams also negotiated the rights to sell an edited version
of The Munro Show. ''We had to edit three hours of television down to
one hour,'' says John Williams, ''but it proved very successful, and we
take two to three weeks in the editing process to ensure that we create
a quality product''.
They buy the rights to popular music if they feel it will add to the
impact of the product, such as Nat King Cole's recording of What A
Wonderful World at the end of the Jinky video. Chris Cameron admits this
can be expensive but he says it adds to the quality of the finished
article.
Both men admit that the video market generally has been going through
a difficult period in the past six months, but are confident that
Cameron Williams will have their best Christmas yet.
One video which they hope will sell better than when they first
produced it is Essential First Aid, which they brought out after Chris
Cameron saw a man collapse and die at Largs while waiting for the
Millport ferry.
''Everyone was running around calling for the police, ambulance and
even the fire brigade, but no one had the slightest idea how to help the
poor man who died.''
Chris then attended a St Andrew's Ambulance first aid course, and
decided to make a video of the course. ''Sales were disappointing,'' he
says, ''but I think we probably did not sell it in the right places.
This time we will try to sell it in the supermarkets.''
The company make a 50p donation to the St Andrew's Ambulance
Association from the sale of the video, which is presented by actress
Cathy Shipton.
Chris and John both take some satisfaction from the fact that their
arrival on the video production scene has increased the interest of
London-based retailers in the Scottish market.
Chris says: ''We are very much Scottish based. We produce, duplicate,
and distribute our videos from Scotland, even to the extent that if we
are too busy to insert the wrappers ourselves, we get a Scottish charity
to do this work.
''We have made the retailers more aware of Scottish products and the
result is that they are now stocking more Scottish videos to cater for
the Scottish market.''

<HEADLINE>No change in inflation policy Clarke extends target</HEADLINE>

FACED with the need to state what the Government's inflation policy
would be beyond the life of the present Parliament, which now has less
than two years to run, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke,
has simply opted to extend the present policy.
This sets a target range for RPIX inflation, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, of 1% to 4% and commits the Government to keeping
inflation at 2.5% or less.
Monetary policy is fixed to achieve the target, but because changes in
interest rates take 18 months to two years to work their way through the
economy, it was necessary for the Chancellor to restate the policy, even
if, on present form, it is unlikely that his party will be in Government
at the time.
Speculation that Mr Clarke might seize the opportunity to change the
policy to soften its impact on activity proved wide of the mark, though
both equity and gilt prices were nervous ahead of the expected
announcement.
The policy was originally made on the hoof by the previous Chancellor,
Norman Lamont, after sterling's forced exit from Europe's exchange rate
mechanism left the Government without a credible stance on inflation.
It has proved more effective than was originally thought likely.
Inflation has been kept within the target range, though recently the
rate has moved into the upper half.
Tensions have, however, risen to the surface recently, largely because
the Bank of England is concerned that inflation will exceed the
mid-point of the range at the end of the current Parliament.
At a controversial meeting on May 5 the Chancellor and the Governor of
the Bank of England, Eddie George, were thought to have been at
loggerheads over the need for a rise in interest rates. The minutes,
which are due to be published on Wednesday, should make interesting
reading.
The Bank's quarterly inflation report last month spelt out the risks
of failure, but subsequent evidence of a slowdown in economic activity
has taken the pressure off Mr Clarke for the time being.
The key question is the extent to which the Chancellor is really
aiming for the midpoint of the target. In his Mansion House speech last
night he seemed to give himself a let-out by pinpointing the possibility
of shocks, such as the recent upsurge in commodity prices.
Taking the commitment at face value if the economy starts to pick up
momentum again later in the year he would find it difficult to turn down
advice from Mr George to raise interest rates.
The timing of the announcement amid conflict on monetary policy has
made it difficult for the Chancellor to refine the policy. He could have
waited a few months for the dust to settle before clarifying his
position.
In particular the opportunity has been lost to target the new RPIY
inflation measure, which excludes indirect and local authority taxes as
well as mortgage interest payments. The Bank of England has championed
this index of inflation as the best guide to core inflation.
The trouble is that RPIY inflation is significantly lower than RPIX.
Changing the goalposts in this way would inevitably have lead to cries
of foul.
* MEANWHILE CBI director-general Howard Davies, due to become
Deputy-Governor of the Bank in September, indicated that the employers'
organisation had revised down its rate targets because of mixed signals
on the economy.
In Mexico City to promote British business Mr Davies said that
interest rates were now expected to peak at around 7.5% or 7.75% because
of the slowdown in the economy and steadying inflation.
Base rates have been fixed at 6.75% since February. The CBI still
expects a further rise, but no longer thinks rates will peak at over 8%.
Mr Davies said manufacturing was doing well and exports were strong,
but the construction market was flat and the retail market ''not very
exciting''.
He added that it looked as if the rate hikes last year and the fiscal
measures had achieved a slowdown in the domestic economy ''from a 4%
growth rate that we had last year to more like 3%''.
There was further evidence yesterday of the economy slowing down with
unemployment falling by a seasonally-adjusted 10,000 in May to
2,317,800, equal to 8.3%.
It was the 21st consecutive decline in the monthly unemployment total,
but the drop was only about half City forecasts. Unchanged average
earnings growth of 3.5% in April was also below City expectations.
In the latest three months unemployment fell by an average of 16,300
against 47,900 in the three months to December.
City economists have also been trimming their rate forecasts as they
read the economic entrails. BZW, for example, has just cut its year-end
projection from 7.5% to 7%. Minority pressure is also emerging in the
City for a cut in rates.

YOU can call it The Group of Seven, which sounds like a recently
discovered constellation, or G7, which has the ring of a class of
recalcitrant teenagers. Neither image is entirely inappropriate.
It's 20 years since six leaders from the world's biggest economies
first sat down for what was billed as a cosy fireside chat at
Rambouillet in France. The founder members of the club -- America,
Japan, Germany, Britain, France and Italy -- were joined by Canada in
1976.
Since the collapse of communism in 1989, Russia has been increasingly
involved and President Boris Yeltsin will attend part of the 1995
summit. So maybe we should call it the G7[1/2]. Oh yes, and European
Commission President Jacques Santer will be along too.
The declared objective of the Halifax summit is ''to determine the
framework of international organisations needed to confront the
twenty-first century''. In a year that has seen the collapse of Barings
Bank, an economic crisis in Mexico, and a plunging US dollar, there's no
doubting that the world economy is feeling rather fragile. No doubt too
that the organisations intended to act as agents of world economic
co-operation (the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) both
appear to be ailing.
But the agenda raises two obvious questions for those who have watched
the G7 over two decades. First, could they conceivably achieve their
objective and second, should such a group be taking such decisions
anyway?
First the ''could''. Despite much grandiloquence on the subject, the
G7 don't have a great history of economic co-operation. The Munich
summit failed to kickstart the stalled Gatt talks and despite much talk
of co-operation, the G7 members have invariably fallen back on their own
policies to tackle recession.
Some argue that the summits have kept protectionism at bay and thus
prevented the world from slipping into a 1930s-style recession. On the
other hand, if the G7 has been a triumph for free trade, how come
America and Japan are on the brink of a particularly vicious trade war?
With such sniping between the men around the table, how can they hope to
agree on how to rewrite the blueprint for the IMF and the World Bank?
Secondly, what right does an unrepresentative seven-nation group have
to impose its blueprint on the rest of the world, supposing it can come
up with one? It's hard to see how a grouping which includes four
European countries but excludes the emerging economies of India, China,
and the Pacific rim, as well as Latin America and Africa, can claim any
right to set the world agenda. By some measures the G7 accounts for much
less than half of the world's economic output.
On the other hand, if too many other countries were invited aboard,
the summits would find it even harder to reach decisions and make them
stick. Witness what happened at the Rio Earth Summit.
Maybe we can afford to be optimistic about the Halifax summit. After
the fright of the Mexican collapse and amid concern about the sickly
dollar, co-operation is back on the agenda. Also, after a period when
the G7 summits ballooned into vast extravaganzas, there has been a big
effort to bring the scale back down to the more effective informal
get-togethers of the early ones. Barely 5000 will attend Halifax, and
that includes the vast press corps.
Even those who dismiss G7 summits as talking shops, admit that these
face-to-face meetings of heads of state, along with their foreign and
finance ministers, are important in this age of electronic transmission
and telephone contact.
Dr Ian Marsh of Strathclyde University says: ''In the event of a real
world crisis, it would be very important that these guys know who is on
the other end of the phone. These meetings help to build up trust.''
The world's biggest economies may not be very good at co-operating but
that's not the same as saying they should stop trying.

David Semple, a Glasgow lawyer, explains how mediation can resolve
rows and avoid costly legal bills
ALTERNATIVE Dispute Resolution, or ADR as it is sometimes known, is a
legal solution begging to be used. It does not involve lengthy and
costly court cases and no-one ''decides'' on a solution, so it is not a
form of arbitration.
Few people know about ADR and fewer have experienced its power, yet it
is a route that has the potential to save businesses from the nightmare
of dragging through seemingly impenetrable and sometimes
incomprehensible court procedures. It avoids the on-cost of expensive
lawyers' bills and provides an opportunity of maintaining decent
business relationships with adversaries.
ADR is widely used in the US where the court system and lawyers are
even less popular than they are in this country. In fact, in many US
states, ADR is mandatory before courts will even consider dealing with a
dispute.
In the UK, though, the process has received little publicity so many
people are not even aware of its existence, yet the benefits of ADR are
such that they should be broadcast at every opportunity.
Lawyers should not be blamed for suppressing ADR, although, on the
face of it, the process would appear not to be in their interests. I am
a lawyer and a member of the Law Society of Scotland's Accord
Initiative, which provides a mediation service, and many mediators
accredited by other promotional groups such as the Centre for Dispute
Resolution (CEDR) are also lawyers.
There is no shortage of accredited mediators. These are business
professionals who have taken the time to be trained in the skills of
being a middle-man -- someone who helps different sides come together,
both physically and in terms of settling a dispute.
Their skill is in listening to all points of view and helping people
to find an answer that is acceptable to everyone.
Another reason that ADR is taking some time to catch on in this
country may be a feeling that by suggesting or agreeing to mediation,
one side is showing weakness. This is misplaced concern. If someone
believes his or her position to be strong, this will generally become
apparent in a mediation. Arbitration tends to finish with an answer
somewhere in the middle. Mediations have no such norms.
In mediations, the individuals can control the timing; after all, it
is their dispute. The mediator, or more likely the mediation organiser,
will call for papers and arrange a mediation session without delay. All
proceedings are flexible and without prejudice.
It must be said though, that mediation will not be successful if the
people involved are determined not to communicate, except in court. If
there is a ''question of principle'' involved, then mediation is not the
answer. Similarly, if one side is simply using the legal system to delay
the evil day when payment or recompense is due, then mediation is not
the appropriate route.
There are, however, many disputes between commercially minded people
where matters are not black and white (very few are) or where the merits
of the dispute are not as important as some bigger picture.
A solution is in everyone's interest but often the people involved
cannot get there by themselves (there may be a host of reasons for this)
and, in these circumstances, the services of a mediator can be very
useful.
Mediators cannot impose a solution. They will use their skills to
bring the individuals to a position where they, themselves, recognise
and accept that the solution arrived at is acceptable. Either side can
terminate the mediation at any time. Nothing is binding until an
agreement is signed at the end of the process. Only that agreement is
legally binding.
I have been involved in mediations where quite unexpected outcomes
have delighted both sides. It is surprising how people who are involved
in an apparently clear dispute can have such different views about it
and such differing agendas for tackling the issue.
To business people who are involved in disputes, I would urge them to
consider using ADR to resolve their problems. This would allow them to
get on with running their companies, look after their customers, secure
profitability and avoid the needless cost and time involved in expensive
court cases.

A PROGRAMME of Government action to boost the housing market has been
put forward by home loan providers in a paper which just happens to be
published soon after Lady Thatcher criticised the Government for letting
down homebuyers from whom the Tories are traditionally considered to
draw their constituency.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) suggests a package of seven
measures. These include a commitment not to cut further mortgage
interest tax relief below the current 15% on loans up to #30,000 and a
new version of MIRAS tax relief to encourage first-time buyers on a
time-limited basis.
In the past the key to getting the housing market as a whole moving
has been the first-time buyer coming in at the bottom of the ladder.
This proposal could be linked to a savings-related home ownership
scheme.
More controversially the council considers the Government's decision
to scrap income support for mortgage interest should be reversed, tax
concessions be given for repair and maintenance and tax relief
considered to assist people with negative equity.
CML director-general Adrian Coles commented: ''We now feel that house
buyers have suffered for long enough and that a fresh impetus towards a
healthy and sustainable owner-occupied sector is needed.
''A package of sensible, targeted measures such as those proposed by
the CML would be beneficial in getting the market back on to an even
keel without over-stimulating it.''
Stockbroker James Capel is also suggesting ways to stimulate the
market and its UK economist Adam Cole believes tax breaks for those with
negative equity is the proposal actually under active consideration.
He suggests in addition the abolition of stamp duty; increased state
spending on social housing to mop up the overhang of poorer quality
properties; increased tax relief on house purchase, possibly restricted
to first-time buyers; and the chance for mortgage holders to capitalise
their future MIRAS benefit.
Mr Cole considers that it would be political suicide for the Tories to
go into the next election with the housing market in its present state,
though he concedes there is no case for artificially stimulating the
market from an economic perspective.
Indeed if the Government did get the housing market moving it could
create a 1980s' style boom in 1997, given the extra stimulus from likely
tax cuts, a political ''cap'' on interest rates and massive windfall
gains from building society mergers.

Benedict Brogan reports from Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the main issues
confronting leaders of the world's richest nations at the G7 summit
JOHN MAJOR flies into Halifax today for the G7 summit, that annual
photo-opportunity for the leaders of the world's most economically
powerful nations. Bosnia and reform of the United Nations will head the
agenda for what is otherwise a source of warm words rather than firm
action.
The Prime Minister will join his counterparts from the Group of Seven
-- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, and the United States
-- for three days of meetings, one-to-one diplomacy and lavish seafood
dinners in Halifax, the capital of the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia
named after the Scots who built it.
Britain is leading pressure for UN reform, and Government sources have
emphasised the need to overhaul the organisation's creaking structure,
which is 50 years old this year. But preoccupation with Bosnia and a
proposal to extend international assistance for countries hit by sudden
economic crisis, threaten to overshadow debate over the future of the
UN.
Last week, it emerged that the ''sherpas'' -- senior officials
preparing the summit -- have agreed on a new ''emergency financing
mechanism'' for the International Monetary Fund, designed to help
countries deal with the sort of financial disaster that unexpectedly hit
Mexico late last year.
According to a draft of the final communique, leaked last week,
industrialised countries would contribute to double the IMF's existing
$28bn fund for bailing out economic basket-cases. The idea is to promote
global economic stability by speeding up access to what amounts to an
overdraft of last resort, to ensure what the communique calls ''an
orderly resolution of crisis situations''.
The focus on international co-operation to manage economies is rooted
in the summit's origins in the economic disruption of the mid-seventies.
But talk of co-operation has never been matched by a willingness to
enforce joint action: the 21 economic summits so far have produced some
good dinners, but have not prevented a series of global recessions.
This summit will attempt to address the apparently intractable problem
of Third World debt. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who accompanies Mr Major
and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd to Halifax, wants the IMF to sell off
some of its gold reserves to help ease the debt burden of
under-developed countries, but has found few supporters.
Other G7 members want to impose tough terms for foreign aid, including
taking into account ''unproductive spending'' -- on weapons, for example
-- when deciding how much assistance to give.
UN reform remains the most potentially far-reaching objective for the
leaders to achieve. The end of the cold war has exposed the organisation
for the inefficient white elephant that it is. With no more ideological
conflicts between East and West to cover up for its wastefulness, the
rich nations are demanding an overhaul if they are to continue to pay
its bills.
Again differences have appeared, this time over methods. Some of the
G7 nations are ready to threaten the UN with a withdrawal of funds to
force reform through, but others are happy to let logic do the work by
pointing out the obvious without naming names.
With the formation of the new World Trade Organisation, for example,
the UN Council of Trade and Development (Unctad) no longer looks
essential. Nor, for that matter, do many of the 100 or so agencies,
conferences and organisations which are smothering what little good the
UN accomplishes.
The sherpas have pinpointed six priorities to take the UN into the
twenty-first century: managing conflict, promoting economic growth and
reducing poverty, protecting the environment, controlling the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and better co-operation
against drugs and organised crime.
As one British source pointed out: ''We think it's time to take a
long, hard look at the way it works. If it's going to be the world's
Cabinet and take control of things like Bosnia, it needs to be working
efficiently.''
Bosnia will be taken up in the political discussions of the parallel
P8 summit, the name given to the G7 plus Russia meeting, which overlaps
the economic summit.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin arrives tomorrow for talks. His
presence is recognition of Russia's status as a nuclear superpower whose
goodwill is needed on global security issues. As a member of the Contact
Group of nations on Bosnia, Russia's support has been crucial to the
efforts to restrain Serbia.
Although no fresh initiatives are expected, the P8 discussions will
endorse the latest build-up of troops. Boris Yeltsin would like to join
the G7. But, as one source put it, Russia's economic troubles will keep
it on the outside as long as it remains among the nations that are
advised, rather than advisers.
For the G7 leaders, the summit offers a refuge from domestic worries.
They may not all speak the same language, but personal relationships
matter. The noticeable new face this year -- Japanese and Italian prime
ministers change too often to count -- is President Jacques Chirac of
France, after 14 years of Francois Mitterrand. His budding relationship
with Mr Major and its potential for annoying Germany's Helmut Kohl will
be watched closely.
Mr Major will trumpet Britain's economic good health and hope that the
pictures of him looking statesmanlike next to American President Bill
Clinton will help distract from the pressing worries of party politics
at home. But, like its predecessors, the summit's ultimate message will
be subliminal: we are the richest, and we know it.

* MEANWHILE CBI director-general Howard Davies, due to become
Deputy-Governor of the Bank in September, indicated that the employers'
organisation had revised down its rate targets because of mixed signals
on the economy.
In Mexico City to promote British business Mr Davies said that
interest rates were now expected to peak at around 7.5% or 7.75% because
of the slowdown in the economy and steadying inflation.
Base rates have been fixed at 6.75% since February. The CBI still
expects a further rise, but no longer thinks rates will peak at over 8%.
Mr Davies said manufacturing was doing well and exports were strong,
but the construction market was flat and the retail market ''not very
exciting''.
He added that it looked as if the rate hikes last year and the fiscal
measures had achieved a slowdown in the domestic economy ''from a 4%
growth rate that we had last year to more like 3%''.
There was further evidence yesterday of the economy slowing down with
unemployment falling by a seasonally-adjusted 10,000 in May to
2,317,800, equal to 8.3%.
It was the 21st consecutive decline in the monthly unemployment total,
but the drop was only about half City forecasts. Unchanged average
earnings growth of 3.5% in April was also below City expectations.
In the latest three months unemployment fell by an average of 16,300
against 47,900 in the three months to December.
City economists have also been trimming their rate forecasts as they
read the economic entrails. BZW, for example, has just cut its year-end
projection from 7.5% to 7%. Minority pressure is also emerging in the
City for a cut in rates.

THE John Logie Baird Awards are traditionally a platform for some of
the most innovative companies and entrepreneurs in Scotland. But even
event organisers Scottish Innovation and sponsors Scottish Enterprise
and The Herald were surprised by the incredible growth of last year's
winners Award plc, the first company in Europe to launch a ''one-day''
disposable contact lens.
Livingston-based Award has become one of the country's most successful
new businesses manufacturing more than half a million contact lens a
month.
Named as Scotland's most innovative company at last September's Awards
Ceremony in Paisley, Award has doubled its workforce to 60, and will
soon be the biggest volume producer of contact lens in Europe less than
a year after starting up.
Russel Griggs of Scottish Enterprise, said: ''Award plc has enjoyed
tremendous success in such a short time and we are delighted that they
are already making such a valuable contribution to the economy of
Scotland.''
Set up in August 1993 with investment funds from Scottish Enterprise
and British Coal Enterprise, Award has its sights set on breaking the
one million lenses per day barrier and expanding its share of the
growing market for disposable contact lenses.
Ronald Hamilton, who founded the company in 1992 with partner William
Seden, said: ''Winning the #12,000 most innovative company award was a
tremendous boost for us and the perfect opportunity to showcase our
product to potential customers.
''Existing contact lens manufacturing technologies were very labour
intensive resulting in high lens costs.''With our method, the mould in
which the lenses are made becomes the final packaging, so that from the
injection of liquid plastic in the moulds until the actual insertion of
the lens in the wearers eye the lens will never have been handled.

TAKING over as general manager of the Glasgow Moat House Hotel in
January was not exactly smooth sailing for Campbell Aird.
The hotel had just been hit by the floods which wreaked havoc in the
West of Scotland.
The entrance was flood-damaged along with several public areas inside,
and work is still continuing to restore them.
''The flooding meant that we had to refurbish several areas, and the
upshot is that all the public areas are now looking good,'' says
Campbell.
He is accustomed to turning adversity into virtue. He makes little of
it, but in 1982 he lost an arm from cancer. He has not allowed this to
affect his personal or working life.
From 1990 until 1993 he held the franchise of the 111-bedroom
Edinburgh Moat House. He relinquished this in a company reorganisation,
but continued as manager until he moved to Glasgow.
Before that he had moved around the country, and had done several
stints at the Buchanan Hotel in Stirlingshire, where he was manager from
1983-86.
''I started my career as a trainee manager in the Buchanan,'' says
Campbell, ''and I was determined that some day I would manage the
establishment''.
However, climbing the career ladder of hotel management did not take
up all Campbell's energy.
In 1985 he windsurfed acrossed the English Channel in two hours 20
minutes, but five years later an attempt to cross the Firth of Forth
between Dunbar and St Andrews failed because of bad weather conditions.
''It was rather windy,'' smiles Campbell. ''In fact I think it was a
Force 6, which made conditions rather difficult, so unfortunately I had
to give up halfway across.''
Campbell is determined that the 300-bedroom Glasgow Moat House will
meet the challenge of increasing competition among hotels in the city.
''We are refurbishing four floors of bedrooms and are improving our
leisure club facilities.''
He would not be pressed further, but admits to taking steps to ensure
that the Moat House will take full advantage of any future expansion at
the neighbouring SECC.
''We are looking worldwide,'' is all Campbell Aird would say on the
subject before subtly changing tack to his next wind sporting ambition.
''I would like to surf the expanse between Arran and Saltcoats if I
could find a sponsor.''

THE City sighed with relief that the uncertainty is now over and
engineer FKI has made its long-awaited rights issue. It is asking
shareholders to put up #137m through an offer of one new share for every
four now held at 125p each, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Chairman Jeff Whalley said that the strategy will be to strengthen the
balance sheet and to make acquisitions in the #50m to #120m range in the
existing areas of group expertise of materials handling and hardware.
Ideally he would like to make a purchase, hostile if necessary, in
Britain as there is now a tax problem given that just 20% of profits are
generated in the UK with North America alone contributing 67.4% of last
year's total. That rose 29% to #67.6m on turnover little changed at
#799m and struck before a #12.2m charge against losses on the disposal
of subsidiaries to Wellman.
FKI shares eased 5p to 148p.
Certainly not a step has been put wrong in the 15 acquisitions in the
last three years of which four are really of significance -- Truth,
Rhombus, France Forge and Amdura which makes prosaic products such as
hooks and shackles which came into the fold only in April but will add
1p per share to earnings this year as FKI management turns its
operational skills on to the business.
Chief executive Bob Beeston, who came into FKI from BTR, believes in
pricing ahead of inflation. So margins have improved during the year
from 7.6% to 9.8% with 10.6% being achieved in the second half.
The target must be 12% in the near term and so the City is looking for
profits this year of about #83m.
Allowing for the dilution of earnings as a result of the rights
creating additional shares that would mean level pegging in earnings per
share terms.
The funding will reduce gearing from 70% to about 5% and put FKI in a
very powerful negotiating position when it ties up its next takeover
which seems likely within the next couple of months.
A cloud on the horizon is the downturn in the US automotive industry
which accounted for #130m of sales last year. But that is being
countered by the increase in market share due to acquisitions so that
overall profits should at least hold their own in that activity.
The dividend total has been raised 24% to 4.6p with a 2.6p final for a
3.9% yield. The shares are trading at around 14[1/2] times likely
earnings and represent good value for the medium term.

THE burning topic at the Nerd House smokers' table yesterday was
another parliamentary scandal. It seems that the House of Commons
adminstration committee has refused permission for Camelot Group plc to
install a lottery terminal within the precincts of Westminster.
''Rum decision,'' said The Braces. ''Do they think it would have a
corrupting effect on MPs?'' We studied The Braces carefully to see if he
was being sarcastic: but he merely looked inscrutable, as inscrutable as
a scratch-card.
Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath said it was a
sound judgment, based on the principle that any such service offered in
the House should have ''direct relevance in assisting Members to carry
out their parliamentary duties''.
The Braces changed gear from inscrutable to incredulous. ''They have
bars in the House of Commons, don't they? Do these have direct relevance
in assisting members to carry out their parliamentary duties? I'd hardly
think so.''
On the contrary, said Angelica, without the bars some Members would
not be able to carry out their duties at all. I decided to get the
discussion back to its original topic.
''I have a friend called Fred,'' I said, ''who has an original idea.
Since the lottery started, not one of his numbers has ever come up
through that spin-dryer thing. He is thinking of setting up a
consultancy service in which -- for a fee -- he wil disclose the numbers
he has chosen for the next draw so that his customers can avoid them.
That would reduce the odds by an enormous percentage.
Isn't it amazing, mused The Braces, how somebody else's #22.5m affects
the brain.
* ''RAIL bosses in Scotland say that dentists could apply to open
premises in main stations, such as Central in Glasgow and Waverley in
Edinburgh'' -- news item.
So there you are, standing in a queue at the information desk in
Glasgow Central. You are holding your jaw and wincing a lot. Ahead of
you, Danish and Norwegian backpackers are asking long and hopeless
questions about how to get to Glen Affric. Then it's your turn.
''Dentist?'' says the clerk, tapping his keyboard with maddening
lethargy. ''Let's see. We have one at Platform 4, but he's running 18
minutes late due to a drill malfunction. Circumstances beyond our
control, of course. There's another at Platform 8 but you'll have to
hurry. He's due to leave any moment.'' (Outside a whistle shrills).
''Oops, that one's away, so it's Platform 4 for you.''
But you have to be in Edinburgh for a meeting in 90 minutes and that
molar is killing you. The clerk clicks his tongue sympathetically
against his (painless) teeth and prods the keyboard some more.
''Yes, we have one dentist at Edinburgh Waverley: but because they eat
more pan drops there you'd have been wiser to book your seat. Here's
what to do. Go to the ambulance rank and transfer to Glasgow Queen
Street. Catch the 11 o'clock to Edinburgh and ask the guard for an
analgesic, compliments of Railtrack. You'll find the dentist at Platform
1.''
It didn't quite work out. When the only ambulance driver at the rank
heard you just wanted to get to Queen Street he said sorry but he was
just going off for his breakfast. The guard on the 11 o'clock to
Edinburgh said sorry but there was no analgesic trolley on this train.
During the traditional unscheduled stopover at Falkirk High they said
sorry there was no dentist at the station although they could fix you up
with a chiropodist. You arrive at Edinburgh Waverley just in time to
hear an announcement.
''Railtrack apologies (crackle beep) for the non-arrival of the
dentist at Platform 1. This was due to a pliers failure at Glasgow
Central. Sufferers are advised that a substitute dentist has been
dispatched from Muir of Ord, Ross-shire, and is expected to arrive at
16.40. For the convenience of sufferers, the waiting room remains open.
Thank you.''
In the waiting room, of course, it's standing room only . . .

DISCOUNT grocery retailer Kwik Save yesterday told Scotland's property
sector that the acquisition of Shoprite's stores fulfilled only half of
its aggressive expansion plans north of the Border.
Terry Atkinson, Kwik Save's property director, quashed any suspicion
that the takeover of its former arch-rival's operations meant it was no
longer looking for sites.
He outlined his company's expansion strategy at a meeting with
property agents and developers, local authorities and local enterprise
companies in Edinburgh's Caledonian Hotel. A similar meeting will take
place in Glasgow today.
Kwik Save, which started life in north Wales in 1965, is continuing
with the conversion of 80 former Shoprite stores in Scotland and another
12 in England to its own format, at a cost of up to #17m. Thirty-four of
these outlets have already been converted and Kwik Save is proceeding at
the rate of 10 to 12 per month.
It has already created about 900 jobs by doubling the workforce in the
former Shoprite operations.
Since it first came to Scotland two years ago, Kwik Save has opened
nine purpose-built stores under its own steam and a further nine are
under construction. Another seven developments have been lined up.
However, it is looking for an additional 75-plus sites over the next
six or seven years, which would give it about 180 Scottish stores and
could lead to the creation of up to 1500 jobs.
Mr Atkinson believes the Scottish invasions planned by Danish-based
Netto and German discount giants Aldi and Lidl have lost steam.
The likes of Safeway, Tesco and Asda are making life tougher for
deep-discounters through aggressive pricing of their value ranges.
However, in spite of this and the fact that Kwik Save suffered a 3%
fall in like-for-like sales in the first half of its current financial
year, the deep-discounter believes it can double its current percentage
of the Scottish market to the ''high mid-teens''.
Kwik Save, whose strategy differs from Shoprite in that it offers
about 3500 product lines compared with the Isle of Man-based group's
1000, is taking a tough line on the price it will pay for sites.
Mr Atkinson said: ''We said back in 1993 that we weren't going to be
bullied into high prices. We have seen what Shoprite did -- the fact
that they got themselves into a situation and couldn't manage.
''We weren't prepared to be drawn into that and we are still here
today as a result. We are fitter and stronger and we have a good
position in the market-place.''
Shoprite, whose own invasion of Scotland flopped, now trades solely in
the Isle of Man, following the #47m disposal of its UK food retailing
operations to Kwik Save in November.

SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric announced strong growth in operating profits
yesterday as the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) prepared to
publish new recommendations for price controls on the company.
Sales increased 5.1% to #833.1m in the year to March 31 and operating
profit was 11.1% higher at #196.8m.
But pre-tax profit was up only 2.7% at #168.7m because of an
exceptional #18.8m charge incurred by the early repayment of an
expensive bond issue.
Hydro-Electric chairman Lord Wilson of Tillyhorn said it had been
''another year of very good progress''for the Perth-based company and
City analysts agreed.
But they warned that future prospects for Hydro-Electric depend on the
pricing regime that will be imposed by the industry regulator in the
light of the MMC report.
''It's a decent set of numbers,'' said Piers Coombs, an electricity
analyst with broker BZW in London, ''but to be honest everything could
change tomorrow when the MMC's findings are announced.''
A surge in power sales to England and Wales offset a decline in
profits from Scotland, where a mild winter and the introduction of VAT
on heating bills depressed demand.
Hydro-Electric now sells a third of its electricity south of the
Border and operates a string of small power stations in England.
Chief Executive Roger Young said Hydro-Electric hoped to invest a
further #50m in combined heat and power generators south of the Border
this year.
These are smaller but more efficient than conventional power stations,
delivering steam to an adjacent industrial consumer as well as
electricity to any number of users.
Mr Young said Hydro-Electric was determined to expand in England and
Wales because there was limited room for growth in Scotland.
''Scotland is already a very competitive market with two big players
in it and the English starting to push in as well,'' Mr Young said.
''We have always seen expansion in England and Wales as a
counterweight to the greater pressure in Scotland,'' he added.
Hydro-Electric's overall sales to England and Wales rose 43.6% to
#211.3m last year, but turnover in Scotland declined 3.6% to #621.8m.
Mr Young said the company's ability to deliver power to consumers
south of the Border was now at full stretch and power sales to England
would grow more slowly this year than the 55% achieved in 1994/95.
The chief executive said new sales to England would depend on
Hydro-Electric building or buying new generating capacity there over the
next two years while the interconnector to Scotland is upgraded.
Hydro-Electric's increased its operating profit last year despite a
#14.5m charge for reorganisation costs and another #2m charge for
expenses incurred in contesting last year's price review by industry
regulator Stephen Littlechild.
Hydro-Electric's rejection of Professor Littlechild's recommendations
triggered an enquiry by the MMC, which is due to be published today or
tomorrow.
Mr Young said he had already seen the 300-page report, but he declined
to comment on its contents.
Hydro-Electric said the regulator's pricing proposals would have cut
its return on investment to unreasonable levels, given the need to spend
large sums on upgrading 30 to 40-year old power lines serving small
communities in the north.
Mr Young said the company expected to agree with Professor Littlechild
on a new pricing regime ''within a couple of months.''
''Our expectation is that it will be put to bed by the autumn,'' he
said.
The chief executive declined to give a forecast for sales and profits
this year, saying much would depend on the new pricing regime imposed.
Hydro-Electric's underlying earnings increased by 12.7% last year and
the board has recommended a 10.8% increase in the full-year dividend.
A final payout of 9.67p will raise the total to 14.01p from 12.64p
previously, but this is amply covered by earnings per share of 31.0p.
Pre-tax profits were dented by an #18.8m redemption premium paid for
the early repayment of #116m of long-term bonds carrying a fixed rate of
interest of 11.856%. These were converted into cheaper floating rate
loans.
Hydro-Electric's net debt of #102m gives a low gearing of 13.1%.
But this rises to 34.1% if the firm's 50% share in Keadby power
station in Lincolnshire is included.
The company's profit and dividend increases were both in line with
market expectations and Hydro-Electric shares put on 6p to 343p,
overtaking ScottishPower which languished down 3p at 337p.
Analyst Kevin Lapwood at broker Smith Newcourt thought the rise in
Hydro-Electric shares had more to do with expectations of a favourable
MMC report than with favourable reaction to the results.''
''I think people are placing their bets for tomorrow,'' Mr Lapwood
said.
But he noted that the electricity regulatory body OFFER is not obliged
to accept the MMC recommendations when making its new pricing proposal.
Analysts said Hydro-Electric would probably make up for slower sales
growth this year by clamping down on costs.
''I wouldn't be surprised if there were plenty of cost savings to come
out of Scotland,'' Mr Lapwood said.

GLASGOW-based creative consultants Bill Mather and John Reid are
ringing the changes in pubs throughout the UK.
Their three-year-old company, The Edge, is at the forefront of United
Distillers' campaign to boost the reputation of its Bell's brand among
the drinking public.
United Distillers has already put a wealth of business The Edge's way.
The Glasgow consultancy has been involved for some time in promotional
work relating to Bell's' four-year sponsorship of Scottish League
football.
Soon, the plastic jugs and drip trays, bar towels and cardboard mats,
used for years to promote Bell's, could be a thing of the past.
The Edge has developed a unique brass and glass ''whisky safe'',
replicating those in distilleries, to dispense Bell's. The design of
individual ''safes'' is tailored to fit the look of a particular pub,
with the brass sometimes substituted for chromium plating.
Sitting alongside beer fonts on the front of the bar, the whisky safe
creates a focal point in pubs. United Distillers obviously hopes this
will prompt customers to ask for Bell's by name.
With the device using existing ''optic'' technology, there is no
danger of bar-owners running foul of Customs and Excise weights and
measures requirements.
The Edge has also designed embossed brass ice-buckets, as well as
matching drip-mat and postcard holders, which are gradually finding
their way into pubs in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Manchester, and London.
New business from the alcoholic drinks market helped boost The Edge's
turnover by 26% to #2.2m during the last 12 months.
About six months ago, Mr Mather and Mr Reid were signed up for some
major projects by Edinburgh-based brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
Meanwhile, The Edge, which is also promoting the upcoming Glasgow
International Jazz Festival, is attempting to educate teenagers in
schools and colleges throughout the UK about the importance of giving
blood.
The Edge has produced an interactive disk for the Blood Transfusion
Service, which Mr Mather believes is less likely to end up in the bin
than traditional brochures.
As teenagers work their way through the programme contained on the
disk, they will be informed about other health issues, such as Aids.

Scottish businesses were today told they must compete or face
relegation in the international competitiveness league, as one of the
world's leading manufacturers launched a new subsidiary to help them
face the challenges. XM Services, a subsidiary set up by Michelin Tyre,
was officially launched by John Ward, chairman of CBI Scotland (left).
Chris Dawes, XM's managing director, also attended the ceremony at the
company's base in Dundee.

I HAVE it on the very good authority of Ronnie Spiers and Atholl
Duncan, both Watsonian chappies who bumped into Andre Joubert in a bar
last weekend, that the South African full back has had three pins put in
his hand after having broken it against Western Samoa, and when they
spoke to him he didn't think he had any chance of playing against France
this Saturday.
These same blokes, by the way, tell me that the All Black and Scottish
players had quite some hoolie together after the Scottish defeat, so
good friendship is there among those in the game.
Joubert's coach, Kitch Christie, needs his star man's services in his
injury-ravaged squad, and so Joubert is in the side to play a vastly
improved French team.
Not only is Joubert's selection something of a surprise, but the
inclusion of Mark Andrews, in for Rudolf Straeuli at ''eighth man'' as
they call them out here, has raised a few eyebrows. At 6ft 7in, Andrew's
presence can only be for one reason as the battle for the honour of
going into the final gets ever closer.
''I have studied as many videos of the French as possible,'' says
Christie, starting to display obvious nerves before this momentous
occasion. ''What I saw was that the French win their lineouts. We didn't
do well in that area against the Australians and if we do badly against
the French, then we will lose.''
Yet there is so much more to the French than their lineout play. They
may have the odd glass of red wine at lunch-time, they may smoke the odd
cigarette, and they may have the odd little tiff with each other on the
training ground, but there's no denying that the French could just sneak
a result against Francois Pienaar's men.
''They'd be a lot better if they didn't train for four hours every
day,'' remarked Bob Dwyer to me the other day. Well, they have cut it
down, and although the French are one of the few countries in the world
who play touch rugby before spending the majority of a session in
full-contact rugby drills and small-sided contact games, it's there for
all to see that when the French are on song in this tournament they play
with a deal of style, even accounting for the odd mistake from stand-off
Christophe Deylaud, himself still carrying a healing broken thumb.
Their back play is based around the Toulouse system, my spies tell me,
in that when a loose kick from the opposition is sent down field, the
winger who responds heads into the middle of the pitch. The forwards
then know exactly where they are to gather, and a good ruck in the
centre of the field immediately gives the stand-off the option of
attacking left or right in equal measure. Simple or what?
All of Scotland could be shouting ''it could have been us'' as they
watch the French take on the South Africans, and French coach Pierre
Berbezier alludes to the fact that his team's win over Scotland was so
very important.
''The turning point of the tournament came when we beat Scotland and
Emile N'Tamack crossed for his try,'' he says. ''We had to win that
game, and I know that if you had beaten France then you would have done
as we did against Ireland and Gavin Hastings would now be here instead
of Philippe Saint-Andre. But it was not to be for you.
''My players were confident and now we have to take that with us. I
think that it will be the most difficult game that any of my players
have played because of the spirit of the South Africans, and they will
need courage at all times.''
But alas, it isn't Scotland against the South Africans and instead
it's the French, and fortune often favours the courageous. Teams:
France -- J-L Sadourny; E N'Tamack, P Sella, T Lacroix, P Saint-Andre,
captain; C Deylaud, F Galthie; L Armary, J-M Gonzalez, C Califano, O
Merle, O Roumat, A Benazzi, L Cabannes, M Cecillon.
South Africa -- A Joubert; J Small, J Mulder, H le Roux, C Williams; J
Stransky, J van der Westhuizen; O du Randt, C Rossouw, B Swart, K Wiese,
H Strydom, F Pienaar, captain, R Kruger, M Andrews.

THE choirboy demeanour and the mummy's boy looks have probably been
the highest hurdles that Ian Jones has had to overcome on his way to
establishing himself as New Zealand's No.1 lineout jumper.
He may stand 6ft 6in and weigh in at just under 17st but, you know, he
never quite looks the part.
New Zealand lock forwards are supposed to resemble leviathans hewn
from Southland granite. Colin Meads is here in South Africa managing the
All Blacks RWC squad. Now, even in his fifties, Meads looks like All
Black locks should. Even gently asking the receptionist for a fax here
in the team hotel, he presents the kind of profile that the Kray twins
would have died for.
Jones, 28, the Kamo Kid -- because he comes from the town of the same
name -- is a Meads protege. He doesn't present the same menacing figure
as Old Pinetree but he has become one of the world's leading lineout
players and, like all of those who aspire to wear the All Black shirt,
he is aware always of those who have gone before.
''There is a huge sense of history and pride within any New Zealand
team, past and present. We often talk among ourselves about the
performances of previous sides and, having Brian Lochore and Colin
Meads, Earle Kirton and Laurie in the management ranks, we look at their
past achievements and they stack up pretty well.
''It's a feeling of great pride to know that the All Blacks who have
gone before you have done so well. That's a hard act to follow but the
expectations of this side over here are no less than all of those who
have gone before.''
Jones, a builder to trade, is like all of the New Zealanders here in
South Africa, spurred on by the expectations of the Kiwi public back
home.
''With the winning of the America's Cup, the expectations of the New
Zealand public is riding on a high. Their messages of goodwill and the
faxes that we have received here have been tremendous.
''Yes, there is a lot of expectation but it's not hard to live with.
It's only a burden if you let it become one. It's what drives us on . .
. that feeling that we want to maintain the great tradition of All Black
rugby.''
Jones is playing in his second World Cup. In 1991 he was a member of
the All Black side which lost out to arch-rivals Australia in the Dublin
semi-final.
In 1987 he had just left school.
''I was 18 or 19 and playing club rugby at Whangerei. Even though some
of the games were in New Zealand I didn't get to any of them. I was just
watching the Tests on the television, just like thousands of kids are
doing back home in New Zealand right now.''
Jones played against England in 1993 when the All Blacks lost at
Twickenham just a week after the 51-15 drubbing of Scotland.
Would this be in his mind on Sunday when England are once again the
opponents? ''Well, it's still going to be pretty vivid in the minds of
the guys who played that day but it's not going to be a problem, and
neither will it be a motivation for us. Revenge doesn't come into it.
''We're in the World Cup, it's 1995, and it's two years since that
game. All Test players remember their defeats more than their victories
but we've got a chance to make a bit of history at Newlands on Sunday,
so that's all the motivation that we need.
''That game is two years ago now. It's history. Our team has changed
drastically since then. England played very well on that day, you know,
and we go into Sunday's game on a level playing field.''
Jones will be in the firing line on Sunday, as England's lighthouse
locks -- the two Martins, Bayfield and Johnson -- represent probably the
best lineout pairing in world rugby right now.
''That's the challenge. No matter what sport you play, you are always
looking for the biggest challenge but it's not just the lineout. The
challenge is for the New Zealand tight five, and the pack in general, to
take on this very good English pack. They are probably one of the best
packs around in this tournament so that's a huge incentive for us to put
one over on them.''
But Jones and his team-mates are more concerned with their own game
than that of the opposition.
''England are a good side and I've played against most of them. That's
neither an advantage nor a disadvantage. New Zealand are not a side who
study match videos over and over again so that we can see every little
pitfall among the opposition. We just go out there and play the game
that we want to play.''
Jones, who made his debut against Scotland in 1991 and celebrated with
a try, has put the 1991 RWC semi-final defeat out of his mind. It is, he
says, irrelevant to this weekend's semi.
''Looking back to 1991 it is always going to be a big disappointment
that we lost -- especially as we were the defending champions -- but
that was one of the best performances that that particular All Black
side had put up.
''When you play your best and you think you've done enough and you
still lose, then there's nothing more that you can do about it. You've
been beaten by a better side. On that day in 1991 Australia were the
better side and they went on to win the World Cup. We did as well as
that All Black team could have done in 1991 but we lost, and we have to
live with that.
''It will be the same on Sunday. We will just play the best we can and
it if it's not good enough, then it's not good enough. We'll give it the
best shot we can and that's all that anyone can ever ask.''

FINAL year fashion student Sarah Dunbar from Alness in Ross-shire is
one of 34 fourth year BA (Hons) students on the all-woman Scottish
College of Textiles (SCOT) design course who have pushed textiles to the
limits at their Design Graduates 1995 Exhibition in Galashiels.
Ian McInnes, SCOT design course leader, said: ''The exhibition is the
culmination of four years of work for the students. It is aimed at
encouraging them to fulfil their creative aspirations, while at the same
time instilling in them enough hard-nosed business sense to try and
establish if there is market demand for their ideas.''
Visitors and potential employers from across the UK came to see the
students' work at the exhibition's private view yesterday. SCOT
graduates in textile design have gone on to work for Benetton, Jasper
Conran and Habitat.
Dunbar, who has her sights set on haute couture and wants to work for
a top name fashion designer, said: ''In my collection I used
lightweight, fluid fabrics like muslin, silk and organza and offset
their delicacy with some hard-edged flower-shaped patterns. I took my
inspiration from photographs of a variety of different skies, and as a
result the base colours of my fabrics graduate from one colour into
another.
''Putting the display together for the exhibition was hard work, but
great fun and I've concentrated on making it simple and effective.''
Nearly 1000 invitations to view the exhibition have been sent out to
representatives of companies ranging from DuPont to Marks &amp; Spencer, and
hundreds more will see the students' work when highlights from the
displays move to the New Designers Exhibition in London in July.
The students' displays make up 65% of their final assessment for their
degrees. SCOT is the textile faculty of Heriot-Watt University in
Edinburgh, and the students who graduate will receive their degrees from
there.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke is sticking to his inflation target of 1% to
4% and 2.5% or less by the end of the present parliament but has now
extended this aim to the next parliament.
He also stressed last night that if he believed the economic
circumstances justified it, he would not hesitate to put up interest
rates again.
Speaking at the Lord Mayor's Dinner for the Bankers and Merchants of
the City of London along with Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of
England who is more hawkish on interest rates, the Chancellor warned
that ''events outside our control, such as the sharp movement in
commodity prices which occurred last year, could temporarily take us
away from the objective''.
He said he could not predict how large these shocks might be, and
whether they will be favourable or unfavourable. But setting interest
rates consistently at the level judged necessary to achieve the
inflation target of 2.5% or less should ensure that inflation will
remain in the range of 1% -- 4%.
Both the Chancellor and the Governor were at pains to stress that
although they may sometimes disagree about what course to take, this was
a healthy situation and the openness through the publication of the
minutes of their monthly economic meetings is a positive feature of the
arrangement.
''We are both firmly committed to the objective of delivering
permanently low inflation,'' said Mr Clarke.
The minutes of their meeting on May 5, when the Chancellor left
interest rates unchanged against the Bank of England's call for an
increase are due to be published next Wednesday.
The Chancellor said that the judgement over the past couple of months
has been very finely balanced. On the one hand, the worldwide increases
in commodity prices and the prolonged weakness of the exchange rate
signal possible inflationary pressures in the pipeline. But on the other
hand, intense competition at the retail level coupled with clear signs
that activity is slowing to a more sustainable rate suggest that these
cost pressures can be contained.
''At the end of the day,'' he added, ''monetary policy has to be a
question of balancing risks as in any other area of economic policy. The
evidence is never clear-cut. No mechanical rule could ever substitute
for the need to make difficult decisions at times. And it is my job to
take these difficult decisions.''
The Chancellor had earlier suggested that while the publication of the
minues of the meetings between him and the Governor of the Bank of
England has done a lot to raise the quality of the public debate about
monetary policy, both of them would like to see it raised a little bit
higher to concentrate a little less on their personalities and a little
more on their commitment to their policy objective.
Mr Clarke reaffirmed his oft expressed intent that, in time, he
intended to be able to cut taxes, saying that in today's competitive
world, the most successful economies will be those with low tax. But he
would only cut taxes when it is in the interests of the economy and when
he could afford to do so.
For his part, the Governor of the Bank of England also told the City
gathering that on inflation, they have had to contend over the past year
or so with a strong adverse tide in the form of higher international
commodity and an associated increase in input costs to UK producers.
He said the short-term pressures on producer output prices, and hence
on retail prices, remain strong; and it is likely to be aggravated by
the fall in the exchange rate earlier this year, after two years of
relative stability.
Up until now the cost pressures have been substantially contained by
tight control over domestic labour costs and by a reduction in profit
margins, particularly on domestic sales. ''The important concern for
policy is to ensure that we do not now begin to see them feeding through
more rapidly and setting off the all too familiar spiral of domestic
inflation,'' the Governor warned.
Monetary policy judgements are invariably a matter of balancing risks
-- of weighing probabilities rather than certainties, he said. ''Indeed,
given the long lags before policy changes have their full effects, it
may be many months before anyone can be confident about the income. The
Bank certainly lays no claim to divine insight -- and nor I suspect,
does the Chancellor.''
Mr George said it was hardly surprising, given the uncertainties, that
reasonable people may differ from time to time in the judgements that
they make as to precisely what course to steer. He added, ''The really
remarkable thing would be if they always agreed. Indeed that would raise
doubts about the credibility of the process.''

ALISON Sheppard turned the argument for full-time training on its head
yesterday when she won the 50m free-style for a record sixth time at the
Hind Scottish Open championships at Edinburgh's Commonwealth Pool.
After eight months as a full-timer with the City of Glasgow, the
22-year-old double Olympian has recently combined a return to the
Milngavie and Bearsden club with a new post at a local bank. ''Doing
nothing except swimming didn't work for me,'' she said.
Sheppard went on to take a second national title when she finished
runner-up to England's Vicki Horner in the 200m free-style.
Fraser Walker, who also left the City of Glasgow last month, collected
the 200m medley in 2-11.70 in his new Warrington Warriors colours, and
also revealed that the switch has been for the better.''For the first
time in months, I'm feeling settled,'' said Walker. Results:

SO far this year on the US Tour, 20 players have been successful in 23
events, one of whom was new to that experience.
In Europe there have been 15 winners in 18 tournaments, seven of whom
have had their introduction to the ultimate golfing satisfaction. These
days there is almost no telling the source of the next victory.
Not even the majors are immune. Today, South Africa's Ernie Els begins
at Shinnecock Hills his defence of the US Open championship which he won
at Oakmont. And Colin Montgomerie who, along with Loren Roberts, Els
beat in a play-off, has twice come close to success.
A quarter of a century has elapsed since Tony Jacklin became the last
European winner of the title, but two reasons offer themselves for
suggesting that these lean years may end on Sunday. First, there are
simply more of them and, second, the character of the course makes them
feel at home.
When the championship was last held at Southampton near the furthest
tip of Long Island, in 1986, only Sandy Lyle, then Open champion,
Severiano Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, and Peter Oosterhuis played.
This week there are 11 representatives from Britain and the Continent,
and for no challenge to emerge from their ranks would be a decided
anti-climax.
Nick Faldo, once also a play-off loser, has given this title his
priority. Soon to be 38 he, nevertheless, believes that time is still on
his side but ''now would be better than never.'' His preparations have
been meticulous and he is not disposed to think that a surprise winner
will emerge from this unique setting.
Despite a drenching from heavy rain yesterday, Faldo is sure that the
pacy character of the small greens on the 6944-yard course will quickly
return once the sun breaks through.
Faldo's holing out may lack his former consistency. For his part,
Montgomerie is of the opinion that his straight hitting makes this
championship his liveliest hope of success, and he has reverted to an
old putter with a heavier head.
Langer finished equal eighth nine years ago, only five strokes behind
Raymond Floyd's winning total of 279. Two successive victories in Europe
induce only one reservation over Langer's form, that it might have
peaked too soon.
For the others the games of Ballesteros, Ian Woosnam, and Jose Maria
Olazabal have become too erratic and unpositive to inspire confidence,
and sheer inexperience will probably compromise the challenge of David
Gilford, Mark Roe, Miguel Angel Jimenez, Barry Lane, and Per-Ulrik
Johansson.
* TIGER Woods, who as the US amateur champion is exempt for the Open
Championship at St Andrews next month, has confirmed that he also will
play in the Scottish Open at Carnoustie the previous week.

CONNIE Cronin didn't bat an eyelid yesterday as proud father Damian,
one of Scotland's World Cup rugby squad, picked her up for the first
time and told her she was ''very gorgeous.''
The 10-day-old girl, despite the cheers from around 100 well-wishers
who greeted the players and management officials when they touched down
at Edinburgh Airport after an exhausting 23-hour journey from South
Africa, slept through it all.
Connie, weighing 8lb 4oz, was born at Edinburgh's Simpson Memorial
Maternity Pavilion and mother Annie, aged 31, arranged for a video of
their daughter to be sent out to South Africa. The news of her birth
came as the squad visited a game reserve and Damien revealed that a
bottle of Moet had been cracked to celebrate the event.
Second row colleague Doddie Weir who scored two tries in last
weekend's quarter-final tie against New Zealand said there was
disappointment but he believed they had done their nation proud.
''We did not disgrace ourselves,'' said Doddie, who said of captain
Gavin Hastings, who has stayed behind in South Africa: ''He's some
boy.'' The Melrose player said he was now looking forward to Irn Bru and
fish and chips.
Stand-off Craig Chalmers said he believed England would win the World
Cup because of their organisation and the fact they did not give much
away. He said he would like to see a France-England final. ''Then they
can come up to Murrayfield next season and we can beat them both.''

CELTIC last night lost Ajax striker Peter van Vossen, the Dutch
international star who has been valued at #1.7m by the European Cup
holders.
Last week the Glasgow club agreed terms with the Amsterdam side and
were given permission to speak to the player, but last night van Vossen
signed a two-year contract with newly promoted Turkish Club Istanbul
Spor which guarantees him #750,000 a year tax-free.
The news came at a press conference in the Turkish city, where another
three Dutchmen joined the club in what the club claimed to be an #8m
package.
Leo Beenhakker took over as coach, Fritz Korverd went as his
assistant, and another Ajax reserve, John van der Bron, went along with
van Vossen.
The development will be a bitter blow to the Glasgow side who had been
on the verge of clinching their first major signing of the close season.
Istanbul Spor are an extremely wealthy and equally ambitious club who
are owned by a major television station.
Preparing for the challenge in their first division, the Istanbul club
first appointed as coach Dutchman Beenhakker, who has managed Real
Madrid and Holland among others. He brought in Korverd and targeted van
Vossen along with van der Bron.
At Ajax, van Vossen had been earning close to #400,000 a season since
he joined the club from Anderlecht, even though he had not been a first
team regular and missed out on the European Cup final triumph.
The 27-year-old has been capped 18 times for Holland and was
identified by manager Tommy Burns as one of the big-name players he
wanted for next season.
Celtic have also hit snags over the Russian striker Dimitry Radchenko
because the player will require a work permit. The deal appears to be
concluded with his club Santander, and Radchenko has maintained for some
months now that he wants to join Celtic. Only red tape stands in the way
of that deal being concluded successfully.
But, in the other, Celtic had to compete with the Turkish gold on
offer from Cem Uzan, the Istanbul club owner and television mogul who
was described to me last night as ''Turkey's equivalent of Berlusconi.''
Meanwhile, the possible sale of John Collins took another twist
yesterday when Middlesbrough increased their offer to #2.25m as another
unnamed English side submitted a written offer to Celtic.
Boro manager Bryan Robson confirmed his fresh offer yesterday and
added: ''We know that there is a written offer from a London club, but
we are sure that Celtic will keep us fully informed on any developments.
We have made it clear that we want the player. Celtic know our
position.''
Celtic would not name the interested London side last night, but
Arsenal have had a long-standing admiration for Collins.

Cape Town,
ALL Black RWC campaign manager Brian Lochore is talking down his
side's semi-final chances against England this weekend in Cape Town.
As Scotland, defeated by the New Zealanders on Sunday, arrived home
yesterday, the Kiwis continued their preparation for the crucial
semi-final clash after two training-free days of rest and recuperation
for their players.
Lochore, the holder of 25 New Zealand caps from the sixties and early
seventies, declared yesterday that all that had gone before in the
tournament could be discounted.
''This is going to be a very close encounter. All of the games that we
have played in this competition have just been a means of getting here.
They mean nothing now.''
Lochore admitted that with a new breed of All Blacks such as Andrew
Mehrtens, Josh Kronfeld, Glen Osborne, and Jonah Lomu, they did not have
anything like the experience that England will be able to call on.
The campaign manager conceded that, with the exception of Osborne, who
was ruled out through injury, the new All Blacks had felt real Test
pressure against Scotland at the weekend for the first time in the
tournament.
''So far as how they will do against England, I don't personally have
any worries, but you are not a great All Black -- or a great South
African, or whatever -- until you have played a number of Tests and, I
guess, come to a consistent standard.
''The great players don't vary very much in terms of their standards
from one Test to the other. It is probably too early to be looking at
them in an individual situation like that, but I have faith in the young
players.
''On Sunday against Scotland, I don't think that they necessarily made
any more mistakes than some of the more senior players. At the end of
the day we scored 48 points and we're pretty happy with that, but
included within those 48 points there were times when we lost
concentration and made a few mistakes. I know that coach Laurie Mains
will be looking at that in the next few days.''
Lochore was loth to go quite so far as to admit that New Zealand go
into the semi-final as underdogs, but he did concede that on his own
definition of ''great'' Test players, England had the upper hand.
''They've certainly got a very consistent side who have been together
for a long time, and I can't imagine them changing their side from last
Sunday, either. So I see them as a very established and settled side,
and one we respect enormously.
''Going back to my own playing days, it was always great to play with
fellows who you knew exactly what they were going to do, and I'd imagine
this English pack will know what they will do in any given situation.
And their backs are pretty formidable, too.''
But that was enough singing of England's praises. The former England
and British Lions lock Paul Ackford, working now for a London newspaper,
asked what, in that case, made the Kiwis think they could beat England.
''Because rugby is played by a team of 15 individuals against another
team of 15 individuals. Everybody has got only two arms and two legs,
and what matters is how you use them. I'm not going to say that we've
got an edge in any quarter.
''We've beaten Ireland, Wales, and Scotland and it would be nice to go
for a bit of the Grand Slam with a win over England as well, but
statistics don't mean anything in a World Cup. We are now -- along with
England, South Africa, and France -- in a semi-final, and if you don't
win, you go home.''
Revealingly to Northern Hemisphere ears, where the All Blacks are
often built up to have an aura of almost superhuman proportions, Lochore
said that he often looked at his opponents -- the blitzkrieg England
back-row was the specific point in question -- and thought: ''Look at
these big fellows.''
He explained: ''But what you have to remember is that it isn't the
size of the dog that matters, it's the size of the bite that counts.
''Having said that, everybody can forget the bookmakers making us
favourites for the competition, or even this game at the weekend.
''The players have never seen themselves as favourites. That's
something that we have never talked about or seen ourselves as. The
position is simple. We are into the last four with three other teams,
with an equal chance of doing something that all of the other teams want
to do as well.''

STEVE Martin kept a similar putting style but altered the implement to
good effect at sundrenched Nairn yesterday to card a five-under-par 67
and take the lead in the first round of the BBA Northern Open.
The 39-year-old Dundee company director dumped his usual broomhandle
blade after a poor series of performances on the greens, opting for an
older lightweight model.
As well as helping him to the top, it also gave him a #500 cheque from
of sponsors Forte Crest Glasgow for setting a new course record over the
lengthened links.
''I lost a bit of money on the putting green yesterday to Fraser and
Lindsay Mann and Andy Crerar and that finally made my mind up that I had
to make a change,'' said Martin.
He led by a stroke from Cowal veteran Russell Weir, the 1992 champion
Peter Smith, and former St Andrews amateur Martin Hastie, now based at
Turnberry Hotel, and who still holds the amateur record of 63 on the Old
Course.
Five players ended on 69. The majority played early before a cooling
north-easterly wind made conditions tougher. Among them was Cawder
assistant Alan Tait, who was playing with new clubs after his old Hogan
set was stolen from his car at the Glencorse pro-am on Saturday.
It was not such a good day for pre-tournament 5-1 joint favourites
Kevin Stables and Colin Gillies. Gillies, the Scottish Professional
champion, shot 73 while Stables was one worse. However, the Montrose man
started 73, 75 at Royal Dornoch last year and won. Leading first-round
scores:
67 -- S Martin (North Engineering).
68 -- R Weir (Cowal), M Hastie (Turnberry Hotel), P Smith (Deeside).
69 -- A Crerar (Downfield), A Tait (Cawder), K Hutton (Downfield), K
Phillips (Winterfield), A Webster (Edzell), N McGill (King George VI).
70 -- S MacPherson (Felixstowe Ferry), B Moffat (Jim Farmer G&amp;L), R
Russell (Longniddry), D Robinson (Fereneze), G Law (Uphall), S Henderson
(Kings Links).
71 -- W Guy (Buchanan Castle), C Maltman (Eyemouth), J Greaves
(Glasgow).
72 -- T Coles (King James VI), I Collins (Stirling), G Weir (Braid
Hills), G Collinson (Windyhill), J Farmer (Jim Farmer G&amp;L), G Lister
(Inverness), C Elliott (Dubai Creek).
73 -- C Gillies (Falkirk), B Davidson (Kings Links), B Marchbank
(Auchterarder), G Harvey (Grangemouth), S Thompson (Gleddoch), J Higgins
(Patshull Park), S Harrier (Murrayshall).
* OLIVER Lindsey (Murrayfield) overturned a two-hole deficit with a
four-under-par inward half to beat David McGinlay of Swanston by one
hole in his quarter-final tie of the Lothians Boys Championship at
Braid's No.1 last night. The boy cap meets Andrew Erskine, of Ratho
Park, in the semi-finals tonight. Other results:
Quarter-finals -- D Miller (Merchants) beat S Lamb (Glencorse), 2 and
1; L Bain (Ratho Park) beat G Ross (Duddingston), 3 and 2; A Erskine
(Ratho Park) beat E McNeill (Dunbar), 3 and 2.
* GORDON Sherry's victory in the Amateur Championship has increased
his lead in the J&amp;B Order of Merit Rankings:
1, G Sherry (Kilmarnock Barassie) 700 points; 2, S Gallacher

LAURA Davies, following her victory in the Evian Masters last weekend,
will start a strong favourite for a fourth win of the season in the OVB
Austrian Open, which begins today at Zell am See.
Davies, with winnings of more than #400,000 this year, now leads both
the merit table in Europe and the LPGA money list in the United States.
Already thoughts of becoming the first player to win both are at the
back of her mind.
''There is still a long way to go, but if I can do well this week and
in the Hennessy Cup in two weeks' time it will be a big help,'' says
Davies, who is now only two behind Dale Reid's Tour record of 21
victories.
Clearly, the par-73 course, playing long after a week's rain, will
favour the long-hitting Davies as it did title-holder Florence Descampe,
another powerful player, last year. Descampe, who married Belgian
diamond broker Daniel van Dievoet last weekend, is interrupting her
honeymoon to defend her title.
Another strong contender is Australian Open champion Annika Sorenstam,
who has yet to win in Europe. Her second place behind Davies in France
last weekend was her sixth runner-up spot since joining the Tour in
1993.
There are seven Scots in the field, including Julie Forbes, who had a
narrow escape from injury in a car accident while travelling to Austria,
but is fit to play.

PAUL Curry will ignore doctor's orders, grit his teeth and start the
defence of his Jersey Open title today at La Moye.
He has been advised to rest as he is suffering from golfer's elbow, a
condition affecting the lower part of his right arm. However, he plans
see a specialist in two weeks' time and in the meantime is taking
anti-inflammatory tablets to muffle the pain, which first came to light
at the Catalan Open in April.
''I don't want to take a break as we are coming up to the good
tournaments,'' he said. ''But the injury could be a long-term problem
and that is worrying. I don't feel the pain when I take the tablets and
I am keen to keep going.
''I have won virtually nothing since the Catalan event as the injury
restricts my swing.''
He achieved his maiden victory on the Volvo Tour when he captured the
Jersey title last year, shooting a final round 63 for a tournament
record 22-under-par total of 266.
Today he partners Mark James, who finished second last year. James is
one of a number of players who will anxious to boost their bid for a
place in the Ryder Cup team this September. He is currently tenth in the
cup table.
Philip Walton, who defeated Colin Montgomerie in a play-off to win the
English Open two weeks ago, is also chasing the #50,000 first prize.
Victory here would push him to fifth place in the Ryder Cup table.

TIM Wren set Kent up for a tricky cup final meeting with one-day
experts Lancashire at Lord's on July 15.
The left-arm seamer, a plumber outside cricket, wrenched away
Somerset's early batting at Canterbury as Kent moved to a comfortable
31-run semi-final victory and a record seventh Benson &amp; Hedges final.
Wren's example inspired a tight and effective Kent bowling and
fielding effort -- they did not concede a boundary during one 18-over
spell.
And they are now just one victory away from winning their first trophy
since 1978, when Alan Ealham's side won this trophy and the county
championship in the same season.
Ealham's 25-year-old son, Mark, took the Gold Award for the second
round in succession, having struck a match-changing 52 on Tuesday and
taking one for 33 in 11 economical overs yesterday.
''Lancashire are a very good side, probably the premier side in
English cricket, particularly in the one-day game,'' said Kent captain
Mark Benson. ''We just hope we can get a good start, and our dangerous
batsmen down the order can give us a winning score when we get to
Lord's.''
Somerset captain Andy Hayhurst went down fighting, making an unbeaten
69 off 71 balls as a total of 218 for nine was the best his side could
manage from their 55 overs.
Kent 250-9 (55 overs); Somerset 219-8 (A N Hayhurst 69no, P D Bowler
53, M N Lathwell 38; Wren 3-34, Fleming 3-51).

A PENALTY shot at the thirteenth hole and a double bogey at the first
cost Mhairi McKay the leading qualifier's trophy at the British Women's
Amateur championship yesterday at Royal Portrush, Ireland.
The Scot looked unassailable at the top of the leaderboard after
adding a 76, one over par, to her opening course record 71 and shrugged
off a minor drama at the thirteenth, where a gust of wind moved her ball
a fraction on the green and cost her a shot.
''I stepped up to address the ball and I saw it move,'' said McKay.
''So I called a penalty against myself. That's golf.
''It's happened to me before. I guess that's why Jack Nicklaus always
marks and removes his ball.''
However, the incident proved more important to McKay after former
champion Julie Hall romped home with an unbelievable 70, stealing the
thunder from McKay's course record and leading the field with a total of
144.
The English internationalist carded only one bogey in the course of
both her rounds, notching up birdies at the third, sixth, seventh, ninth
and twelfth holes. Leading qualifiers:
144 -- J Hall (Felixstowe Ferry) 74, 70.
147 -- M McKay (Turnberry) 71, 76.
149 -- M Hjorth (Sweden) 75, 74; J Moodie (Windyhill) 72, 77; A
Vincent (France) 73, 76.
150 -- E Power (Kilkenny) 74, 76.
151 -- H Kavanagh (Grange) 72, 79.
152 -- E Duggleby (Malton and Norton) 77, 75.
153 -- A Knight (Australia) 80, 73; V Requier (France) 74, 79; M
McKenna (Donabate) 78, 75.
154 -- K Mourgue D'Algue (France) 75, 79; E Fields (Falmouth) 76, 78;
A Berg (Sweden) 78, 76.
155 -- J Oliver (Knebworth) 80, 75; M Alsuguren (France) 80, 75; A

Hakkarainen (Finland) 82, 73; T Lipp (Canada) 74, 81; S Beautell (Spain)
76, 79.
Other Scottish aggregates: 156 -- E Ratcliffe (Stirling University)
79, 77. 161 -- L Nicholson (Haddington) 79, 82. 162 -- A Rose (Stirling)
82, 80; H Stirling (Bridge of Allan) 80, 82. 163 -- C Agnew (Glasgow

PAUL Ince is expected to complete his #7m transfer from Manchester
United to Inter-Milan today. According to the Italian club's president,
Massimo Moratti, the England midfielder has agreed a three-year deal
with the Italian side.
Moratti said that the talks on terms -- Ince is believed to have been
promised #2m a year -- were now almost finalised. ''We have had many
discussions with him and we are now in agreement about everything,''
declared Moratti.
He also disclosed he had not yet given up hope of landing Eric
Cantona, despite the Frenchman's decision to sign a new contract with
Manchester United, and he added he was considering a bid for winger Lee
Sharpe after talking with Ince about the sort of team Inter should be
looking to build.
The Inter president said he had tried to land Roberto Baggio from
Juventus, but had now switched his sights back to Cantona.
* BRIAN Irvine yesterday signed a new two-year deal with Aberdeen. The
defender said: ''I accepted the first offer on the table, because I have
no desire to play for any other club.''
Stephen Wright will also be made a lucrative offer, but Aberdeen are
resigned to losing the #1.5m rated international full back to Rangers.
* DAVID Pleat yesterday returned to top-flight management with
Sheffield Wednesday after walking out on Luton for the second time.
Pleat, who succeeds Trevor Francis, signed a one-year rolling contract
with the Hillsborough club, even though Wednesday have yet to agree a
compensation package demanded by the Bedfordshire club. Luton are
understood to have demanded around #300,000 for Pleat's services.
* RUSSIAN officials have taken the unprecedented decision to order the
replay of a premier division match they said had been ruined by bad
refereeing.
CSKA Moscow complained bitterly after having been beaten 2-0 by
Dynamo-Gazovik Tyumen in May that the match official had ruled out two
perfectly good goals. The Moscow club had threatened to pull out of the
premier division unless its appeal was upheld.
* THE Tartan Army will get just over 20,000 tickets for the European
Championship match against Greece.
The SFA last night announced they will be making 12,523 East Stand
tickets available for families and organised groups and that means only
the West and North Stands, which can cater for 20,752 fans, will be on
general sale.
Tickets prices will remain at #14 for the North Stand, #12 for the
West Stand, while the East Stand family section prices are #10 for
adults and #2 for children.

IT ISN'T every day that the West Indies roll into town. Indeed, you
have to go back to 1980 to find the last time that the kings of
Caribbean cricket visited Scotland. That fact, coupled with the possible
appearance of the biggest draw in the game, Brian Lara, should be enough
ensure a full house today when Scotland take on the Windies in the
one-day international at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh.
Lara has been named in the 12 for this encounter, though we won't know
until just before battle begins whether the world record-breaking
left-hander will get the chance to thrill.
The non-appearance of the world's top batsman would be a
disappointment. For so long, this has been billed as his match.
But according to the tourists' manager, Wes Hall, he's here, and
available.
''Other touring sides in the past have left all their top players in
London. But we have brought the entire squad with us.
''It's the first time in Scotland for a lot of the side, and it's an
honour to be here. And we've come to play cricket the way people like to
see it played,'' said Hall.
The West Indies had a free day in Edinburgh yesterday, thanks to
having wrapped up the first Test against England in just four days.
That enabled the party to play golf, or visit old friends.
And that win, for coach Andy Roberts, was a sign that the West Indies
are on the way back after having lost their unofficial ''world
champions'' status during the winter to Australia.
''We never felt we were so bad, anyway,'' admitted the former
Hampshire paceman. ''But we're happy to be where we are after the
Headingley match. That was just the first hurdle and we won't be carried
away with that result, because England can play better.''
During his prime, Roberts -- regarded as one of the all-time greats by
leading batsmen such as Boycott, Botham, Lillee, and Gavaskar -- usually
bowled in tandem with Michael Holding, and as part of the fearsome
quartet which also included Colin Croft and Joel Garner.
Whether he was pitching the ball up, or aiming a bouncer at some
batsman's throat, Roberts' face was expressionless, and yesterday, as he
looked forward to this encounter, it was difficult to know just what he
might be planning for the Scots.
''We are treating this game against Scotland as a meaningful match. We
are playing our spinners, and have given players not in the Test side a
chance.''
That may come as some relief to the Scotland players, with only
Courtney Walsh selected from the four-man battery which rolled over
England.
But has that enhanced Scotland's chances of winning?
''Of course Scotland can win -- but you won't,'' stated Roberts,
though Hall reflected on a visit to Ireland in 1969, when the mighty
Windies were skittled for just 25.
Richie Richardson captains the side while Jimmy Adams returns to the
capital having once played for Royal High. Keith Arthurton, too, has
happy memories of Scotland, having scored a ton here five years ago in
Gordon Greenidge's benefit game.
The Scots, however, will be minus their own calypso contingent, George
Reifer being denied the chance to face his countrymen after having been
surprisingly binned, while ''hired hand'' Malcolm Marshall is not
contracted for this game.
Scotland: A C Storie, captain, M J D Allingham, D Cowan, J W Govan, G
B J McGurk, I L Philip, G Salmond, M J Smith, I M Stanger, K Thomson, JG
Williamson. Twelfth man -- K L P Sheridan.
West Indies: (from) R B Richardson, captain, S L Campbell, S C
Williams, B C Lara, J C Adams, K L T Arthurton, S Chanderpaul, R
Dhanraj, O D Gibson, W K M Benjamin, C Browne, C A Walsh.

France Under-21 0, Brazil Under-21 1
BRAZIL duly won the Toulon Under-21 International Tournament last
night, but the smile disappeared from the face of their football.
With France having done their homework and man-marked the main
dangermen, the South Americans occasionally displayed cynical flashes of
temperament at their lack of progress.
There was the ducking, the diving and the feigning of injury
associated with lesser mortals to diminish their achievement in the
Stade Mayol. All of it was totally uncessary, because if the Brazilians
had persevered and held their discipline their superior skills would
have undoubtedly told.
Admittedly, their cause was given little assistance by the pre-eminent
French referee, Jules Quiniou, officiating in his last game. Some of his
decisions, mainly in favour of the host nation, defied description.
With just two minutes remaining, Brazil delivered the winner to deny
the negative strategy laid down by France. Keeper Fernandez was
wrong-footed by a wicked deflection at a free kick and Pereira had a
relatively simple task to steer the ball in at the back post.
But the final never lived up to the pre-match hype. Brazil were rarely
able to escape the clutches of the French, who were repeatedly stirred
up by a huge home support.
France should have had a couple of players sent off just before
half-time as tempers flared, but referee Quiniou took the easy option.

JAMES Craig Ltd, the Ayr-based auction company which is bidding for
Wallets Marts in Castle Douglas, said yesterday that it had received
acceptances from 29.2% of shareholders -- compared with 22.3% at the end
of last week.
The Craig offer of #12 a share has been extended to June 20.
Michael Craig, chairman of the Ayr company, said if it acquired more
than 50% of Wallets' shares it would have the power to appoint a new
board. Two of the new directors would be from among existing
shareholders. He said he was impressed with the way momentum was picking
up.
Wallets' advice to its shareholders has been to take no action on the
Craig offer, which it describes as very poor value. It values the
company at #1.5m, but Wallets says its net assets are worth #1.94m.

A LEADING English meat wholesaler, RH Thompson Ltd, has bought a 75%
shareholding in Biggar Quality Meats, the Biggar-based abattoir which
has an annual turnover of #18m.
The three directors who form the existing management team will remain
in place with a minority shareholding. It is eight years since they led
a management buy-out at what was then Biggar Beef.
At that time the depots which the company owned in England were bought
by RH Thompson, which has now returned to take a controlling interest in
the Biggar plant itself. Thompson, which is based in Sevenoaks in Kent,
operates out of 10 depots in England. In terms of the number of depots
operated, it is the third largest meat wholesaler in the UK.
Geoffrey Bishop, its chairman, said his company regarded the purchase
of the EU-approved plant at Biggar as an opportunity to ensure supplies
of quality beef and lamb for customers south of the Border. Thompson
specialises in supplying independent retail butchers. It said it had
found strong demand for carcases with the Biggar label.
About 75% of the lamb Thompson buys is sourced in Scotland. ''We are
very pleased with both the quality of the lamb and the way the carcases
have been dressed,'' said Mr Bishop. ''We find that makes a big
difference when you are selling to the retail side.''
The English company has an annual turnover of #50m and for the past
eight years has been one of Biggar Quality Meats' biggest customers.
Bill Somerville, procurement director for the Biggar plant, said that
the closer association with Thompson would help secure outlets for beef
and lamb slaughtered there. ''We want to demonstrate to farmers that we
have outlets for their stock,'' he said.
The plant handles about 350,000 head of sheep and 10,000 cattle a year
and deals directly with individual farmers for about 40% of its
through-put. A further 30% comes from farmer groupings and the balance
from the marts.
''We have built up a good connection with lamb groups such as
Scotcountry Lamb, Highland Glen and the Aberdeen Lamb Marketing Group,''
Mr Somerville said. He added that farmers were responding to the call
for lighter lambs in the 16 to 18 kilo range. While there was no premium
for lean lambs, there was now a severe penalty for producing animals
which were too fat or too heavy, he said.
The management team at Biggar plans to continue developing its export
trade with France and Spain. It has spent more than #1.5m on bringing
the plant up to EU standards and hopes the special dispensation which
has allowed non-approved plants to continue exporting to Europe will be
terminated at the end of this year.
Ian Cochrane, managing director, said the majority of Scottish plants
had come up to EU standards but there were still abattoirs in England
and Wales operating without approvals. ''They are all small plants but
they still account for one third of the UK kill in beef, lamb and
pork,'' he said.
The third member of the management team at Biggar is finance director
Robert McIver.

Impressionism's most ravishing landscapes, exhibited in London,
provide escapism for jaded urbanites, writes LESLEY STEVENSON
THE seemingly insatiable taste for French nineteenth-century painting
in Britain might be dismissed by cynics as a commercial ploy, but the
memories of the Hayward Gallery's Landscapes of France: Impressionism
and its Rivals will linger long after the saccharine excesses of much
Impressionist painting have dispelled. For the first time the landscapes
of Monet, Renoir, and their peers have been set within the historical
context of the Salon, the state-sponsored exhibition held in Paris,
against which the Impressionists continued to measure themselves long
after they had given up hope of real success there.
The decision to exhibit some of their most ravishing small landscapes
in the Hayward was a bold step, for it has no natural light to act as a
reminder of what the Impressionists were attempting to do in their
canvases. As a space for the sometimes pompous and overblown but always
fascinating Salon paintings however, it works well and the distinction
that the organisers hoped to achieve between the private world of the
Impressionists and the public face of the Salon is made explicit.
For the first time, Pissarro's Tow-Path (from Glasgow's Kelvingrove
Gallery), most probably shown at the exhibition of 1864, and his
Chennevieres on the Banks of the Marne, shown the following year, are
properly represented as Salon paintings. Their large format, suggesting
that they were produced in the studio rather than out of doors, their
schematised compositions, and their reliance on earth colours indicate
the constraints imposed on those who courted critical as well as
commercial success at the Salon.
The sheer ambition of Salon landscape is only properly revealed in
something like Penguilly l'Haridon's Roman City built at the Foot of the
Alpes-Dauphinoises sometimes after the Conquest of the Gauls from 1870,
which in its subject matter, minute detail, and seven-foot scale
suggests some rare animal bound for inevitable extinction. The
commercial reality of the art world at the time was that survival was
granted only to those who appealed to the swelling middle classes, who
were increasingly demanding accessible and small paintings for the
intimacy of their own homes.
The Hayward Gallery's Underground stop is the spanking new
Euro-terminal at Waterloo station, a useful reminder that landscape is
the great escapist genre, produced for a jaded urban population. The
appeal of many of the works in the exhibition must have been similar to
a nineteenth-century audience as it is to a contemporary one. Something
like Sisley's The Petit Pres in Spring from about 1880, offers a
timeless vision of a rural harmony, and one which is increasingly
attractive to a dislocated urban audience.
This ambivalence manifested towards modern life is perhaps most
evident in something like Monet's spectacular Train in the Countryside
from about 1870. The scene is a sunlit meadow which is inhabited not by
people who live and work in the countryside, but rather, to judge by
their elegant clothes and parasols, by tourists from Paris. The train,
which opened up the country to greater sections of French society,
trundles benignly across the horizon, part of a Toytown vision rather
than a dark, satanic threat.
Berthe Morisot's View of Paris from the Heights of the Trocadero of
1872 is a panoramic vista with the monuments of Paris in the background,
while in the middle distance a great swathe has been cut through the
city, scene of the International Exhibition of 1867. The poignant
similarity to stretches of the Clyde after the garden festival is
inescapable. In the foreground, two well-dressed ladies have turned
their back on this view, but a child looks out on it, striking an
optimistic note for the future.
* Landscapes of France can be seen until August 28.

MARY BRENNAN on how a new fair-exchange scheme can help small arts
companies
GLASGOW -- as you know -- is positively hoaching with cultural assets.
Just launched is a new scheme aimed at encouraging folk to swap a few of
those assets about.
What you're looking at is a refinement of the basic principle -- ''You
scratch my back . . . and I'll do your ironing.'' Yes, let's. Or rather
LETS, which stands for Local Exchange Trading System. You may have heard
of this already. Indeed there are, even now, LETS operating successfully
in parts of Glasgow.
Skills, services, goods new and second-hand are all traded within a
community without hard cash necessarily changing hands. Instead, all
those registered within the scheme pay in units of symbolic currency,
with a central ''teller'' keeping tabs on individual getting and
spending.
The benefits of LETS in general were buoyantly explained by Nigel
Leech to a moderately sceptical gathering of arts practitioners earlier
this week. Years of dealing with funding bodies had nurtured in them a
wary attitude towards Greeks bearing gifts. Here was a chap from
Halifax-way telling them how they could access resources without parting
with a penny . . .
There had to be a catch.
Well, the worst catch would seem to be underestimating your own value.
It was only when Leech had us play a game -- going round trading among
ourselves -- that the possibilities became persuasive. Suddenly it
didn't seem at all daft -- or unworkable -- to have someone take over
the dreaded ironing when one's own offer of cat-sitting had been pounced
on by the person who tuned the ironer's piano.
How might this translate into the arts world of Glasgow? Small
companies who can't afford expensive equipment -- which they probably
wouldn't use all the time anyway -- will be able to tap into the
facilities of larger organisations, many of whom have already shown
willing and are registered with the scheme. Those large organisations,
in turn, may need one-off input from live musicians, dancers, visual
artists -- chances are, the LETS directory will come up trumps for them
too.
And though a primary aim is to help people find ways around budgetary
restrictions or lack of expertise, an underlying objective is the
forging of new links between practitioners in the city.
LETS -- make art! is now official open for trading, with the DPAV
providing the initial organisational back-up. The symbolic currency is
''bells'' -- as in the Glasgow coat of arms, not drams. Non-artists,
such as accountants, lawyers, management consultants cooks, are warmly
invited to join -- there could be free tickets in it for you, or the
possibility of having your own troubadour serenading guests the next
time you have a barbie.
Think about it. And not just in strict terms of rehearsal space,
transportation or photocopying. Touring thespians often have house
plants that need watering in their absence . . . Whatever you have to
offer, whatever you think you need -- all you have to do is ring them
bells!

against the Czech Republic.
The Scots will play a 4-4-2 formation, which will put pressure on
their strike force of Susan MacDonald and Rhona Simpson.
Indeed, there is the risk that they could be exhausted before the
vital classification matches, for in the course of the weekend they will
play Holland and Spain. The Scottish team is:
T Robb, G Messenger, J Jack, D Renilson, S Fraser, A Ramsay, W Fraser,
A Menzies, P Robertson (capt), S MacDonald, R Simpson.
France looked set to upset the favourites, Germany, in Group A. The
French led 1-0 at half-time but Germany went on to win 3-1. Results:
Group A -- Ireland 1, Italy 0; England 9, Begium 0; Germany 3, France
1. Group B -- Holland 10, Sweden 0.

<HEADLINE>Lower silage yield is legacy of fickle spring</HEADLINE>

AS livestock farmers flocked to the first day of ScotGrass in West
Lothian yesterday the concern back home on the farm, where silage making
is in full swing, was in many cases about moderate yields following a
spell of unseasonally cold weather, especially in the East. All that
specialist machinery and expert advice about how much fertiliser to
apply and when to do it counts for nothing unless growing and harvesting
conditions are correct.
Spring proved fickle in the extreme this year ranging from good early
growth, which allowed farmers to put cattle out to grass at least 10
days earlier than last year, to the recent spell of cold weather, which
has all but halted growth in many areas. The dilemma for many farmers
is, as ever in such circumstances, whether to go for outright quality or
to wait and sacrifice some digestibility for bulk. An early cut, even if
lighter than hoped for, at least gives the prospect of a decent second
one in a few weeks.
Dr Graham Swift, a pasture agronomist with SAC, yesterday confirmed
that in most parts of the country yields of grass were lower. He said:
''The cold dry areas have been worst affected with yields down by
10-20%, and that is most noticeable with the intermediate to late
varieties of perennial rye grass, especially if they have been down for
a few years. First-year leys are more vigorous, and I think farmers
should be seriously thinking about having a regular re-seeding programme
rather than a summer finding that all their grass is five years old or
more.''
The contrast between the opposite ends of Scotland could not be
greater. In Morayshire, Dean Anderson farms 2000 acres from his base at
Mayne, near Elgin, and he has found it a stressful period. He commented
yesterday: ''We were at least 10 days later in starting silage and then
we hit bad weather making it impossible to get down to the 40% dry
matter we want to fill our tower with the target 600 tonnes. In fact,
since that tower went up in 1979 we've never put in as wet silage as
this year.''
Mr Anderson milks a herd of 180 cows which last year came out top in
Scotland with an average yield of 11,080 litres, as well as running a
herd of 280 sucklers. The 2800 tonnes of silage which he makes is an
important component of the ration for his dairy herd, but quality is not
quite as crucial as in the past.
He explained: ''We've got some big mature crops, but I'm not too
worried about that because gone are the days when we absolutely had to
have that 68D value. Silage is just one part of the ration acting as a
buffer for beet pulp, draff and soya meal.''
Meanwhile, in the South-west Michael Milligan, who farms at Culvenan,
near Castle Douglas, and has an outstanding record for making the best
silage in Scotland and once in the UK, has found everything running in
his favour this year.
He commented: ''We've had no problems because we went early on May 17
before the rain came. We thought the crops might be light but were
pleasantly surprised, and I think we've actually got more first cut than
last year with excellent sugar levels. And then, of course, just as we
finished the rain came so the prospects for our second cut look
promising.''

ENGLAND manager Jack Rowell has delayed naming his team to play New
Zealand in Sunday's World Cup semi-final in Cape Town.
But Rowell gave the strongest possible hint that when he finalises
selection today, he will announce the same side that defeated Australia
25-22 in last weekend's quarter-final.
''If we come back to the team we first thought of, it will not
surprise anybody,'' said Rowell.
However, he added: ''We have one or two areas to ponder.''
He would not specify, but the only possible positions where debate
might occur would be prop and centre.
Victor Ubogu and Jeremy Guscott have not been as prominent as they
would have liked during this World Cup, but when both have been part of
the most prestigious win in England's World Cup history, there would be
no question of omitting them.
Captain Will Carling did not train yesterday when England began their
build-up to the big showdown with the All Blacks. After having returned
from their 36-hour relaxation holiday in Sun City, Carling had an upset
stomach. In addition, Dean Richards is walking round with the huge gash
on his forehead which still bears six stitches.
Rowell added: ''Looking forward to playing the All Blacks, I don't see
how things can be more intense than that contest against Australia. We
could not surpass the mental or physical effort, but we can expect a bit
more productivity.
''This is not going to be a game for individuals. New Zealand are very
fit, playing fast and dedicated rugby, and have become favourites for
the tournament. They have been tested, but always seem to collect
30-plus points.''
Carling dismissed the technicalities of New Zealand's refound
enterprising style by saying: ''They tell us that there is a different
approach, but the All Blacks always have this underlying strength.
''We have got to get the euphoria out of our system in the same way
that I have got to get a few things out of my system because of my brief
illness.
''I am sure the squad will be realistic and sensible about what they
achieved last Sunday, as we face a bigger challenge, simply because this
is a semi-final rather than a quarter-final.''

Butchart scrambled past the winning post with a single on the

PETE Sampras yesterday claimed that he can capture a third successive
Wimbledon crown after having beaten Jonathan Stark 7-6, 6-3 in the
second round of the Stella Artois tournament at London's Queen's Club.
It was a welcome return to grass for the 23-year-old from Florida,
whose clay court season fell apart when his coach, Tim Gullikson,
collapsed with a brain tumour at the Australian Open in January.
''What happened to Tim was the lowest point of my career,'' said
Sampras. ''It opened my eyes and showed me how vulnerable we all are.
''The best thing I can do to help him now is win my matches. A third
Wimbledon title would be a great boost and that's what I'm looking
for.''
Sampras looked sharp as he ousted the world No.66 on a court where he
was beaten by Todd Martin in last year's final.
Boris Becker coasted through his opening match against Britain's Danny
Sapsford, winning 6-1, 6-1, but Mark Petchey was beaten 6-2, 6-2 by
Jason Stoltenberg.
* PAM Shriver saved three match points to reach the third round of the
DFS Women's Classic in Birmingham.
Shriver, 32, took two-and-a-half hours to beat Dutch world No.278
Petra Kamstra.''It was tough,'' said Shriver, who won 7-5, 3-6, 8-6.
Zina Garrison won in straight sets against Caroline Vis, while Miriam
Oremans made short work of Hiromi Nagano.
* MICHELE Mair took a step closer to the main draw for Wimbledon when
she won through two rounds of the All-British Pre-Qualifying event at
Surbiton yesterday. Mair beat Jennifer Duncan 6-1, 6-0, then defeated
Helen Richardson 7-5, 6-4.
* MAGNUS Larsson broke a leg during an exhibition match in Southern
Sewden and will be out of action for at least six weeks.

The Leopardstown race will be the starting-point of a campaign that
will mirror last season's programme, bar one key detail.
The six-year-old will this time remain with his Flat trainer Cecil,
rather than return to Kim Bailey who supervised his assault on the
Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham in March.
Cecil, who has a dual-purpose licence, has trained Alderbrook since
the end of 1992 and is being given the chance to match Bailey's

THE large crowd at Hamilton's Saints and Sinners charity meeting last
night were thrilled when local owner Hugh O'Donnell's Mentalasanythin
landed his fifth race over the track when taking the Langs Supreme Gold
Cup.
A recent winner at Haydock, the six-year-old gelding now has won 13
times since his first success as a two-year-old -- at Hamilton. ''He
loves it here and will keep coming back,'' said trainer Alan Bailey.
But if Mentalasanythin enjoys himself at Hamilton, Talented Ting must
be in love with the track for he recorded his seventh success at the
Lanarkshire course when making all in the Scottish Hunt Cup. He won in
similar fashion here nine days ago and has been declared to run again
today.
A fine evening attracted a large turn out for the thirtieth
anniversary of the charity fixture which has raised more than #500,000
for Scottish charities.
The first race produced an exciting finish. Mellottie, winner of the
1991 Cambridgeshire, was sent off the 5-6 favourite for the amateur's
race. Two furlongs out Mary Reveley's runner appeared to be cantering as
he challenged Newmarket raider Jandeel.
However, Alec Stewart's runner showed great courage and rallied inside
the final furlong to take the race on the line by a head. His amateur
rider, Victor Lukaniuk, was winning his third race from four attempts.
The experience of Ramsay Hope, 9-2, spoke volumes in the maiden race.
Two of the seven two-year-olds were making their racecourse debut, but
Ramsay Hope, trained by Chris Fairhurst, had raced six times.
He leapt out of the stalls ahead of his rivals and led all throughout.
Flying North tried hard to cut him down but could only get within
threequarters of a length.

The MBA degree is by far the fastest growing post graduate
qualification in the UK.
STRATHCLYDE Graduate Business School or SGBS, situated in the heart of
Glasgow, has been offering the Master of Business Adminstration or MBA
programme since 1966 and during that period has built up an enviable
reputation for excellence in this field.
It is renowned as one of the most innovative business schools in
Europe. As recently as May this year the Scottish Higher Education
Funding Council singled it out as the only one in Scotland to have its
staff teaching given the ''excellent'' rating.
Strathclyde had already been awarded the highest rating (5) in the
University Funding Council research exercise and in 1993 it was given
the Queen's Award for Export Achievement for the MBA programmes taking
place in South East Asia. Again the only business school in Scotland to
be honoured. Such external recognition enhances the value of an MBA
degree from Strathclyde.
Although it is part of the University of Strathclyde, SGBS is
financially separate and broke new ground when it funded the development
of its custom-built premises with a commercial loan. An investment of
#13m was made in purpose-designed teaching facilities offering the best
available, enabling SGBS to offer MBAs which are educationally sound and
firmly based on good management practice.
A major review of MBA Programmes at SGBS was underaken for the
academic year 1994/95, involving a wide consultation process, critical
analysis, and an evaluation of current trends in management
developments. This process culminated in a stimulating new programme
offering the latest management education with flexibility playing an
integral role.
Ten years ago there were 25 MBA courses to choose from in the whole of
Britain. Today there are over 90. The MBA degree is by far the fastest
growing post graduate qualification in the UK. Britain's current output
of over 7000 MBA graduates a year is more than the rest of Europe put
together, a major increase from the 1985/86 total of 2000. Twenty years
ago having an MBA guaranteed a good job. Nowadays the question employers
ask is no longer just, ''do you have an MBA?'' but, ''where did you get
it?''
To Dr James McCalman, new academic manager for the part-time MBA
programme, at SGBS and senior lecturer in Human Resource Management, the
answer ''Strathclyde Graduate Business School'' is an important step on
the road to success.
He joined SGBS in April with an honours degree from Heriot Watt
University in Edinburgh and a PhD in Investment Linkages from Paisley
University. His academic background encompasses being a research
assistant in Management Studies and a lecturer, then senior lecturer in
organisational behaviour at Glasgow University.
In 1993 he became director of education and training at Health Care
International in Clydebank. He moved to SGBS because of its innovative
approach to the MBA programmes and its excellent reputation as a
business school.
According to Dr McCalman there are four reasons for choosing an MBA
programme at Strathclyde. He pointed out: ''An important aspect of our
MBA is the way it is taught. Emphasis is placed on case studies, role
playing and interaction. We have the syndicate rooms essential for small
groups and our students can switch to different routes to achieve the
ultimate goal. This mix and match approach embraces open learning, and a
switch from full-time to part-time learning if required. There is a
friendly atmosphere here and the staff can't do enough for their
students.''
Strathclyde's MBA programme is aimed at middle to senior managers and
offers a deep understanding of the development of strategy, the
opportunity to study functional management areas or types of business
activity with an emphasis on teamwork and leadership through a range of
integrative activities.
It targets graduates or diplomates on the rungs of middle management
with several years' work experience and the potential to achieve senior
positions. The typical age range is 27 years upwards. Study is by
full-time, part-time or open learning (a new open learning programme
will be available from October).
The MBA programme aims to give a broad understanding of management
issues at senior level along with appropriate skills and techniques,
allowing at the same time a degree of specialisation. It is structured
into stages which move from a compulsory general foundation level
through an increasingly free set of choices to design an individual
programme best suited to career aspirations.
The growth of part-time MBAs in Britain means that employed managers
can choose an evening course close to their workplace. Obviously the
course should have the approval of the Association of MBAs which SGBS
has, and the quality of the establishment's teaching and research should
also be taken into account. In 1992 Britain's Higher Education Funding
Councils conducted a survey to assess the quality of business school
research throughout the country and the top grade was only achieved by
six, including Strathclyde.
An MBA by part-time study provides interactive benefits to both the
individual and the organisation for which he or she works. SGBS has
adapted its full-time course to suit part-time participation combining
the benefits of learning with immediate practical application within the
student's working environment. The part-time course is identical to the
full-time course in all but teaching modes.
Over three years, it usually requires attendance at classes on two
evenings per week, normally Monday to Thursday from 6.30pm to 9.30pm.
There are also weekend schools, five in all, for three and two-day
periods. Transfer from part-time to open learning is possible so that
job transfer need not disrupt MBA studies.

Despite an apparent easing of tension with the release of the Bosnia
hostages, Tim Judah, in Belgrade, warns of a new crisis
THE good news is that the Bosnian hostage affair is all but over. The
bad news is that it will soon be forgotten with the onset of a new
crisis. The last United Nations hostages have not even been released
when news comes that the Bosnian Government is massing up to 30,000
troops for a possible offensive to break the siege of Sarajevo. If it
happens, the carnage will be terrible, Nato's much-vaunted Rapid
Reaction Force will be left sitting on the sidelines, and a renewed
debate will begin on whether to withdraw the UN force from Bosnia.
By Tuesday night all but 26 of the 370 blue berets taken hostage after
Nato bombed a Serb ammunition dump had been released. Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serb leader, declared: ''This crisis has ended.''
In the wake of the releases a debate has begun on who won the hostage
affair. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has carted off the top
prizes but Mr Karadzic is not the defeated man that many would like to
paint.
Three years ago, when hundreds of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and
Croats were being driven from their homes by Serbian forces, it was a
commonplace to revile Mr Milosevic as the Butcher of the Balkans. Today
Western foreign ministers regularly come to pay court to him and the
hostage affair has only served to boost his prestige.
Conveying a mixture of threats and inducements, Mr Milosevic sent
Jovica Stanisic, his secret police chief, to the Bosnian Serb
headquarters in Pale to secure the release of the hostages. Being a
tough negotiator, Mr Stanisic may have gone as far as to threaten the
physical security of Mr Karadzic unless he complied with his demands.
But he would also have pointed out that the hostage crisis provided both
Pale and Belgrade with a golden opportunity to work together for mutual
profit.
For Mr Milosevic the release of the hostages has meant that his credit
rating in Western chancelleries has increased. Now he can demand a
higher price in negotiations about lifting sanctions on Serbia in
exchange for his recognition of Bosnia.
What has Mr Karadzic gained from the affair? Last August the Bosnian
Serbs rejected the plan drawn up by the Contact Group (America, Russia,
Britain, France, and Germany) for the division of Bosnia. Since then
they have been completely isolated. No longer. Not only has the hostage
affair meant that cold relations between Pale and Belgrade have warmed
but it has reopened diplomatic channels. British and French diplomats
among others have been in contact with the Bosnian Serbs and their
discussions have ranged over the whole peace process
0 Last summer the Contact Group told the Bosnian Serbs that their
peace plan was a ''take it or leave it'' one. Now Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary general, is calling for a new peace conference --
something the Bosnian Serbs have been demanding.
Mr Milosevic may well soon recognise Bosnia and many believe that in
so doing he will be washing his hands of the Bosnian Serbs. This is
nonsense. Formal recognition will change little.
Two possibilities now being mulled over by the Serbs can loosely be
called the Yugoslav option and the Greater Serbia option. The former
foresees a loose reformation of the old Yugoslavia (minus Slovenia) in
all but name. Some of the framework for this is already in place. It is
the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia which has the right to confederate
with Croatia. If the Serbs accept the Contact Group plan they too will
be linked into this system. They will be joined by a weak Bosnian Union
to the Croats and the Muslims and will be allowed to confederate to
Serbia. If this ever comes to pass then Macedonia would certainly join
this Yugoslav phoenix in a bid to escape its own isolation and economic
weakness.
The Greater Serbia option foresees the Serb part of Bosnia being given
the right to leave any post-war Bosnian Union after a period of two
years. Greater Serbia would then be created.
The Greater Serbia option is favoured by Croat leaders because such a
division of Bosnia would effectively create a Greater Croatia too. The
Bosnian Muslims would be left with a seat at the UN but in reality the
Bosnian federal rump state would be an economic dependency of Croatia.
None of this may come to pass though. If it is true that Bosnian
forces are massing to break the siege of Sarajevo then a new dynamic of
warfare will set in. A Bosnian offensive would be met by retaliation
from the Serbs who would shell Sarajevo. Then what would the UN and the
Rapid Reaction Force do?
If they moved to prevent the Bosnian Serbs from taking what they
regarded as a legitimate diversionary action then the UN and its extra
troops would be accused by the Serbs of having entered the war on the
side of the Muslims. If they did nothing then powerful voices in the
international community would say that if the UN refused to defend
civilians in Sarajevo then they should withdraw and the arms embargo on
the Bosnian government be lifted.
Today the balance of forces means it is unlikely that the Bosnian army
can break the siege. Their chances of success increase, however, if the
Croats simultaneously launch an all-out offensive against Serb-held
parts of Croatia. And if the Serbs look set for a military catastrophe,
then the army of Yugoslavia, that is Serbia and Montenegro, will almost
certainly intervene. Welcome to another long hot summer in Bosnia.

JANE Coles was born in Glasgow but emigrated to Australia with her
parents in 1949, an experience which, judging from Crossing the Equator,
she's drawn heavily on for a drama that charts the hopes and fears of a
group of ordinary steerage passengers seeking a new and better kind of
life in Oz after the war.
A microcosm of post-war uncertainties, it is set in 1949 on the SS
Straithaird on its way from Tilbury to Sydney and plays on the ocean
voyage as journey-of-life metaphor. Dusted with a light covering of
mythology, Crossing the Equator is less a drama of self-discovery than
one of revelation and of group dynamics in which echoes of old Empire
and English narrow-mindedness are never very far away.
For what Cole so cleverly uncovers as the two couples, Jack and Vera
with their daughter Hilary, and Derek and Kay approach the equatorial
line -- and, in a sense, point of no return -- is the way fear and
insecurity, unleashed from its usual moorings of familiarity turns into
persecution with Steven, a gay cabin steward, inscrutable and rootless
and different, as their focus.
Beautifully structured and framed, Cole writes with spikey compression
and subtle awareness both of the early post-war period of crampness and
austerity from which these characters come and the new world into which
they are speeding.
John Dove's production never lets its foot off the pedal and there are
fine performances from Paul Copley as a bundle-of-nerves soft-drinks
manager, Sophie Stanton as an aspiring hair salon owner and newcomer
Sarah Howe as the disgruntled, fast-developing Hilary.

William Russell reports how Jonathan Aitken's bumpy ride through
journalism, business, and politics has been nothing if not dramatic
BACK in 1973 Jonathan Aitken, then seeking a seat in the Commons, was
interviewed by Hunter Davies for one of those men-on-the-make profiles
that colour supplements adore. Davies's verdict -- Aitken ''is the
nicest sort of chancer, openly ambitious, so patently wanting to do well
and impress. The worst that one person would say of him is that
somewhere deep down he is weak.''
Aitken's own verdict was, if anything, even more perceptive. ''My life
so far has been full of peaks and valleys,'' he said. ''There are
presumably more dramas to come. I seem to have the ability to stir up
dramas. I don't want them, but they seem inevitable.''
He is, of course, in the thick of another drama today, but in 1973 he
had already enough dramas behind him for one lifetime, having had to
stand down at the 1970 General Election as candidate for Thirsk and
Malton, a seat he had nursed for three years and his second attempt at
getting into Parliament, because he was due to stand trial at the Old
Bailey under the Official Secrets Act. It was over a story he had
written about the war in Biafra for the Sunday Telegraph based on a
leaked Ministry of Defence document, and he was acquitted.
In 1974 he got the safe new seat of Thanet South and his political
career should have taken off. Unfortunately, although on the right of
the party, he had not endeared himself to Margaret Thatcher because he
had failed to carry his friendship with her daughter Carol as far as the
altar. He was said to be ''the man who made Carol cry''. He also had his
reputation as a bit of gadfly -- the Biafra affair was an attack on all
that the Establishment holds dear -- round his neck.
In the 1960s he was one of the golden youths, a young meteor, the
title of a book he wrote about the up and coming of the time. The only
glittering prize that evaded the handsome Old Etonian at Oxford, where
he read law at Christ Church, was the presidency of the union. He had to
settle for the posts of treasurer and librarian. The definition of a
meteor is -- a shining body appearing temporarily in the sky, brilliant
but short-lived -- and in a sense his career has been a succesion of
meteor flights; all of them brilliant, none all that long-lived.
When John Major promoted him to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the
Treasury last year it seemed as if finally, aged 52, he was on his way.
In party terms it meant there was a right-wing rival to Michael Portillo
holding Cabinet office, in personal terms it meant he had secured a job
in which reputations get made. Since then, however, his past has come to
haunt him. Born in 1942, he is the son of the late Sir William Aitken,
also an MP, and a great nephew of Lord Beaverbook. While that is a
heritage to ensure the doors of influential people are open, it is not
one which blessed him with wealth. Sir William left only #5000 when he
died in 1964, and his great uncle, not generous with money, reckoned the
young Jonathan was the brightest of the clan and could fend for himself.
He has, therefore, had to make his own way in the world and is now
very rich indeed. It is the source of that wealth which is causing the
problems. After leaving Oxford in the early 1960s he wrote speeches for
Selwyn Lloyd, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was there during the
night of the long knives -- so he knows what it is like to get sacked.
In 1965 Lloyd made him his private secretary and he had an entree to the
best Tory salons. In 1966 he joined the Evening Standard, journalism
being the family trade, where he worked for the next five years and
wrote two books, the rather silly Young Meteors, and the very good Land
of Fortune about Australia, which he had visited with Lloyd. He
campaigned for the legalisation of cannabis, and proved he was a highly
talented foreign correspondent reporting from Biafra, Vietnam, and, most
importantly, the Middle East where he made friendships which were to
prove invaluable.
He moved to management, but fell foul of the chairman, Max Aitken, who
blocked the promotion he had hoped for. In 1971 he left to join the
rival Associated Newspapers where he worked for the next two years,
leaving after his proposal to turn the Evening News into an up-market
tabloid to challenge the Evening Standard failed. He joined Slater
Walker as a senior executive in charge of the Middle East, where he
stayed for five years, and set about building up his business career.
In the late seventies he was a man-about-town, squiring the lovelies
of the day -- Georgina Russel, Lady Charlotte Curzon, Arianna
Stassinopolous, Lizzie Spender and Lady Antonia Fraser. Then, in 1979 he
married Lolicia Azucki, a Yugoslav to whom he was introduced by an Arab
friend, the very man who was later involved over the celebrated booking
at the Ritz hotel in Paris, and settled down to the grand life. They
acquired a #250,000 town house near Smith Square and in due course
produced twin daughters and a son.
Once again he was the man who had everything -- except a ministerial
career. He had also been involved in the fiasco of TV-am, which climaxed
when Anna Ford, one of the outraged founders, threw a glass of wine in
his face, an incident which will haunt him just as that black eye will
forever be with Norman Lamont, or toes David Mellor.
He formed his own company with his cousin Tim, a financial services
group, Aitken Hume, which had extensive interests in the Middle East and
was heavily involved in setting up TV-am. The boardroom battles -- he
ousted his cousin from Aitken Hume, stood down as chief executive at
TV-am after the IBA decided a sitting MP should not hold such a post,
and in 1988 had to resign from the TV-am board after failing to dislcose
a Saudi royal holding in the group -- seemed endless. He was chairman of
Aitken Hume until 1992 when John Major rescued him from the bourne of
the back benches and made him Minister of State for Defence Procurement,
a job for which his Middle-East contacts made him eminently fitted and
at which he was a great success.
That led to his promotion last year. But the timing could not have
been worse for someone whose fortune depends partly on dealings with
Middle Eastern countries. Arab trade is a murky world at the best of
times, and those who sup with the devil need a very long spoon indeed.
The arrival of Tory sleaze as a political issue has meant that his past
connections have assumed new significance and come under scrutiny they
might otherwise not have attracted.
There has been the row over who paid that bill at the Ritz in Paris
involving Mr Al Fayed, the hotel's owner, the claim that he had tried to
arrange call girls for a Saudi prince at a Berkshire hydro some 13 years
ago, allegations that, while Minister for Defence Procurement, he had an
improper commercial relationship with a Lebanese-owned arms company
called Future Management Services and failed to declare the connection
in the Commons Register of Members' Interests. The current fracas is
over his position on the board of BMARC and possible knowledge of
illegal arms sales to Iran, which led to Tuesday's Commons statement by
Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade.
He has strenuously denied all charges, and fought bitterly with
newspapers and broadcasters over the way they have handled the stories.
In April he attempted to set himself up as a crusader carrying the sword
of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play which he would use
to cut out the ''cancer of twisted journalism''.
He said in ringing tones: ''I am ready for the fight. The fight
against falsehood and those who peddle it. My fight begins today.'' He
also accused the Guardian, which has led the field, of ''deliberate
misrepresentations, falsehoods and lies . . . clearly part of the
paper's long campaign and sustained attempts to discredit me''. Bold
words indeed, but not necessarily wise.
Labour are currently demanding his resignation over this latest BMARC
catastrophe, a row which reveals as much about laxness in Whitehall as
it does about Mr Aitken's role in the company since he joined its board
towards the end of the period in which the sales had taken place. He was
not on it when they were being negotiated. But directors are supposed to
know what is going on, and there is no doubt that his golden-boy image
has been tarnished these past months, if only by implication. Mud always
sticks.
John Torode, writing in the Daily Mail in February, described him as a
man to be watched who had problems, adding -- ''beware you don't get
hurt by skeletons falling from his cupboard''. It is possible to argue
there is an amazing hypocrisy, a double standard mind-boggling in its
self-interested blatancy, operating in Britain towards arms sales. We
want the money badly, but we don't want to know how we get it, thank
you. But that does not alter the fact that Mr Aitken's skeletons have
been rattling in the wind, causing damage both to him and the
Government, and for that reason alone it could be that this latest
flight by the now ageing meteor is going to crash land any day now.

presumably more dramas to come'

The 'miserable git' of music is back on the road performing a blur of
world-wide concerts. Rob Adams reports on Michael Chapman's new outlook
on life, his first novel, and the appeal of his work to a new
generation.
THEY say there's nothing like a health scare to spur you into making
the most of your allotted span. Since recovering from a heart attack
four years ago, Michael Chapman has certainly followed that scenario.
He has just published his first novel, Firewater Dreams, released his
twenty-firts album, Navigation, and is watching this year disappear in a
blur of concerts in Australia, Europe and, now, the UK. He has also
produced the first album by Dave Gardner, a young singer/songwriter
accompanying him on this gigathon.
Chapman is probably best remembered for his early albums on the
Harvest label in the late 1960s/early 1970s, when he formed an unholy
trinity in many record collections with Roy Harper and John Martyn.
While Harper was the sharp social commentator and Martyn the folk/jazz
experimentalist, Chapman's songs often had a strong
drowning-my-sorrows-in-whisky-and-beer air. He was a miserable git long
before Morrissey made it fashionable.
''Me and Laughin' Len Cohen,'' says Chapman of a reputation he regards
as thoroughly merited. ''Miserable songs are easier to write because
when relationships break up, you don't always remember the wonderful
walk on the beach you had together but you do remember feeling rotten --
and I think everyone goes through those times.''
He is quick to point out that he does have a sense of humour, however,
and can lay claim, surely, to one of the great song titles of our time:
She Came In Like the 6.15 and Made A Hole In the Wall, which was written
about a 25-stone friend, apparently. It's also no surprise that he's
turned novelist since songs such as Stranger, from 1976's Savage
Amusement album, showed a talent for an eerie narrative.
A former art teacher -- he resigned when he discovered he could earn
more playing guitar -- Chapman grew up in Leeds listening to every sort
of American music on his grandmother's radio. ''She was going deaf, so
she didn't mind what I listened to, whereas my father wouldn't even let
me listen to the Goons. To this day I can't tell the difference between
Woody Guthrie and John Coltrane -- it's all just great music to me.''
While recording his second album, Fully Qualified Survivor, in 1970,
Chapman insisted that he use ''this gardener from Hull who plays great
guitar'' rather than a London session player. His producer, Gus Dudgeon,
also happened to be David Bowie's producer and the Hull gardener, Mick
Ronson, became the Spiders From Mars' gain and the Michael Chapman
Band's loss.
That band, which at various times included bass guitarist Rick Kemp,
later of Steeleye Span, and drummer Keef Hartley, is long gone, and
Chapman, after years of playing electric guitar, is back playing solo
acoustic. This was always his strongest suit and produced instrumentals
such as Naked Ladies and Electric Ragtime, which became something of a
rite of passage for guitarists and a millstone round Chapman's neck.
''I always get asked to play that and I never do. I hate it. It's
lovely to be asked for the old songs but sometimes I end up feeling like
a human juke box. I never know what I'm going to play, really, because
that way I'd be bored. I usually start with the same song but then I
just see where I go from there.''
His audiences comprise fans from the early days and -- most pleasingly
-- their children. ''A couple of the old albums have been re-issued on
CD and the kids have obviously played them and thought, this isn't half
bad. I take it as a real compliment that something I did 20-odd years
ago has lasted this long.''

THE chemistry department at the University of Aberdeen, working with a
Cambridge bioscience company, has developed a revolutionary method of
administering drugs which could earn it millions.
The university is collaborating with Quadrant (Cambridge UK) in a
scheme which is likely to produce drug delivery systems which not only
protect sensitive drugs from becoming useless before they can be
administered but can also control the rate of release of drugs within
the body.
The technology enables drugs to be released at pre-set intervals and
could be used to vaccinate infants against the common childhood diseases
with a single injection, comprising a dry, stable mixture of vaccines.
Dr Don Fox, the director of Auris Research at the university, said a
combination of technologies had made the development possible.
Conventional drug delivery techniques often require painful injections
given at regular intervals. Combining Quadrant's technology for
stabilising healthcare products with the university's expertise in solid
state chemistry and drug encapsulation could lead to the elimination of
booster jabs.
''The commercial prospects in this field are very exciting and could
potentially earn the University millions through royalties, but we
prefer to be cautious at this stage,'' Mr Fox said.
''I would anticipate the first drugs could be available for clinical
trials in less than two years but it would be some years after that
before they became commercially available.''
Quadrant said various estimates placed the size of the market for
alternative drug delivery systems at between #4400m and #6250m.
These figures are expected to increase three-fold by the year 2000,
with market growth driven by a number of factors, including known
limitations of conventional delivery methods and the emergence of
biological drugs which are difficult to administer by conventional
means.
Dr Fox said there really was no limit on the potential for the
development. It could be used for contraceptive pills administered under
the skin, for localised chemotherapy, and could be taken in the eye,
mouth, or stomach.

The home of the Marquis of Bute, which opens to the public for the
first time tomorrow, is set to become one of Scotland's leading tourist
attractions, reports Lesley Duncan
FOR generations of visitors, the Isle of Bute in the Firth of Clyde
was synonymous with Rothesay and all the douce fun of the Fair. The sail
from Wemyss Bay was the prelude to enchanted summer days for city
children. There was even a castle to explore -- after all wasn't the
heir to the throne really the Duke of Rothesay rather than the Prince of
Wales in this territory?
Wemyss Bay is still the jumping-off point for Bute. And opening to the
public tomorrow for the first time is another stately, if less ancient,
pile. Mount Stuart House -- home to the Marquises of Bute -- with its
gardens is set to be a tourist attraction of the first rank, rivalling
Duff House on the Moray Firth, the William Adam mansion now functioning
as an outstation of the National Galleries of Scotland.
Mount Stuart is as imposing as Duff -- but belongs to the Victorian
Gothic tradition rather than the neo-classical one. It was built in the
late nineteenth century by the third Marquis of Bute to replace its
eighteenth-century predecessor, destroyed by fire in 1877 (Bute's widow
continued the work after his death in 1900). The marquis was an
extraordinary character as well as an immensely rich aristocrat. His
conversion to Roman Catholicism and his taste for mysticism were to be
influences on the house interior.
He chose as his architect Sir Robert Rowand Anderson, who also
designed the imposing grey sandstone mass of Central Station Hotel,
Glasgow, and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. Like the
latter, Mount Stuart is executed in red sandstone. With its massive
five-storey facade it has almost a cliff-like presence. Comparisons have
been made with the Doge's Palace in Venice. Anderson also brought
elements of Italian and French medieval architecture to bear on his
designs for the house. A Spanish influence has been noted. Two wings of
the original house were incorporated into the designs and remain in use
today.
What the third marquis described as bidding ''fair to be a splendid
palace'' did not take shape instantly. Though the marquis was recorded
as saying that he did not want to hurry his building projects (others
included the gothic interiors of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, Wales)
he was by 1885 compaining that Mount Stuart was ''like a carpenter's
shop''. The following year he described it as ''very cold, a vast
resounding desert''. This may explain why another architect, William
Frame, was appointed to complete the interiors. He in turn was dismissed
in 1890 for drunkenness and Anderson returned to finish the house.
Whichever architect was responsible for what, the result is an
exotically rich interior. The house, too, was the first in Scotland to
have electric light installed. There was much to be illuminated.
The main hall on the first floor is a cathedral-like space with
typical ecclesiastical features. The walls and pillars are of rare
marbles -- red, white, and grey. Astrological figures are painted on the
ceiling. At night the vault shines with stars, each a carefully cut
prism. Mirrors at the back of the arcades heighten the sense of mystery
by creating the illusion of a succession of matching courtyards.
Stained-glass windows spill colour on to the stonework.
The ballustrade at first-floor level is modelled on the tomb of
Charlemagne.
Eleswhere in the house, there is a wealth of detail in the woodwork of
the door frames and the ceilings, as well as painted ceilings and
stained-glass windows. William Frame was responsible for much of the
woodwork and Horatio Walter Lonsdale for the stained glass. An arts and
crafts artist, Robert Weir Schultz, created furniture inlaid with
mother-of-pearl for the ''horoscope room''. Even details such as door
handles, hinges, and light switches are cast in bronze. There is much
animal and zodiacal imagery. The ceiling above the marble staircase
depicts the days of the Creation.
While late-nineteenth century work predominates, the non-Victorian
contents of Mount Stuart reflect for the most part the taste of the
third Earl of Bute (1713-1792). The eighteenth-century statesman, Prime
Minister, and enthusiastic botanist was a collector of Italian
Renaissance, seventeenth-century Dutch, and baroque paintings, some of
which are in the drawing-room of Mount Stuart. He was also a patron of
such contemporary luminaries as Allan Ramsay, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and
Robert Adam.
The collection of full-length family portraits includes masterpieces
by Ramsay and Reynolds, as well as a portrait of the second marquis by
Sir Henry Raeburn, painted in the early nineteenth century. There is
some superb furniture by Thomas Chippendale. Later marquises added to
the collection, notably the fourth, who purchased the sixteenth-century
English portraits in the Henry VIII room.
Apart from the treasures of the house, the grounds are a great
attraction in themselves. There are some 300 acres of gardens,
woodlands, and parklands much of them established by the third earl who
also advised on the foundation of Kew Gardens. The vistas and avenues
are designed to draw attention to the charming prospects of the Firth of
Clyde and the Ayrshire coast beyond. The grounds extend to the
waterfront. The house is approached by an avenue flanked by azaleas and
rhododendrons.
Other outdoor attractions are the kitchen garden and pinetum, the rock
garden, and the area dubbed the ''wee garden''. The kitchen garden
harbours a glasshouse, originally a feature of the 1988 Glasgow Garden
Festival. Now it is the setting for exotic plants from Borneo, Papua New
Guinea, and Malaysia. The pinetum consists of a mature collection of
North American conifers with an additional 100 acres recently dedicated
to an international conifer conservation programme.
The two-acre rock garden dates to the turn of the century, though it
has been more recently embellished. More than 1500 different species of
plant grow here. The ''wee garden'' -- in fact five acres large -- is in
the mildest area of the estate and contains plants from the southern
hemisphere.
From now till September visitors can explore all the gardens and large
areas of the house and its principal rooms five days a week (Tuesdays
and Thursdays excepted). Much will be accessible by wheelchair. A ranger
service will organise guided tours for school, educational, and youth
groups. Car-parking, tea-room, shop, picnic areas, and lavatories are
provided. A visitors' reception centre is planned for next year. Costs
are -- adult, #5; child, #2.50; family, #14. Group tickets and
garden-only tickets are also available.
Mount Stuart Trust was created in 1989 by the late sixth Marquis of
Bute, who was responsible for major renovation and refurbishment work.

ANN SHAW reports on the steady progress of The Herald Foundation for
Women's Health
THE first state-of-the-art equipment bought with donations from Herald
readers is now up and running at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
Consultant gynaecologist Dr Helen McEwan says the video endoscopy
machine offers: ''Greater accuracy, safety and gives more information.
It also allows a woman to see on a television monitor the inside of her
own uterus while other gynaecological examinations are being carried
out.''
She adds: ''It's absolutely fantastic, offering state of the art
technology to women in Glasgow.''
The machine, the most advanced of its kind, made by Litechnica, cost
approximately #8000.
The new secondary investigative clinic at the Royal Infirmary will not
open officially until the autumn, after all the refurbishment and new
design, courtesy of Glasgow School of Art, along with new machinery is
in place. But, as each new piece of equipment is purchased, it will be
put to use immediately.
Meanwhile, fundraising efforts are on-going. Next week the London City
Ballet will be donating part of the proceeds from their Charity Gala
performance on Friday, June 23 at the King's theatre, Glasgow, to the
Herald Foundation for Women's Health.
If you want to go you had better hurry: a few tickets are still
available. Contact the King's theatre.
We are absolutely delighted to announce that The Herald Foundation for
Women's Health has raised nearly #50,000 so far. What's more, 800 women
have so far run coffee mornings in aid of the foundation, bringing in
more than #15,000.
Congratulations! Keep up the hard work. We hear some women are finding
themselves invited to four or more events . . .
You'll find a coupon on Page 14 if you would like to help.
Among the donations received so far have been: Lord MacFarlane of
Bearsden, #5000; Dr James &amp; Bozena Bain Memorial Trust Fund, #2000;
McGrigor Donald, #500; Public Donations, #6700.
Luncheon, October 14, 1994: surplus on tickets #5887; raffle at
luncheon, #1755; Spanish evening, #935; Citroen evening, #1768; Royal
Mail stamps appeal, #1947; Armani evening #4000; coffee mornings,

ONE sad note to record -- none of the scheduled stages on this Spring
Into Summer tour is quite large enough for Marian Bruce's setting of
forest trees for Haydn Pieces . . . it is being premiered, instead, on a
bare stage.
It still looks superb. Mark Baldwin has choreographed a piece that
seethes with classical rigour and yet comes over as engagingly sassy,
fresh and full of high spirits. In ones and in twos the dancers come
into a woodland clearing. They are, essentially, looking for the ideal
partner. There are four men -- and five women. Someone is going to be
left out. But who?
Certainly never Daria Klimentova, a perfect little madam (in bright
saffron frock) who assumes command, organises pairings, and promptly
annexes Vladislav Bubnov for herself. Though he does have to prove
himself. This he attempts in solos of bravura display.
Baldwin is renowned for his musicality as a choreographer and here --
with three Haydn piano sonatas setting a sparky pace -- he whisks up
fiendishly testing bouts of jumps and turns. Bubnov powers through these
at speed, feeding in the quirky gestures and comic touches that give
this piece its special fizz.
Technically it's a very sophisticated, demanding work which the whole
ensemble responded to with real verve,Strong, dramatic dancing from
Noriko Ohara, Campbell McKenzie and Daria Klimentova, conveyed the
spirit of Darrell's Cheri and brought to the fore all the intensity and
anguish of Lea's relationship with a self-absorbed, immature younger
man.
The two-piano version of David Earl's cinematic score was, however,
far from ideal: it simply couldn't cover the subtler textures. And some
of the minor roles bordered on caricature rather than characterisation.
Even so, this remains one of the finest short works in the company's
repertoire.
* This tour is sponsored by the Bank of Scotland.

American TV star stumbles at the movie hurdle; thriller with an
evasive ending; fear on every page with Sam Neill -- William Russell
previews the latest films.
NEW RELEASES
Bad Boys (18) directed by Don Simpson.
Silent Fall (15) directed by Bruce Beresford.
In The Mouth of Madness (15) directed by John Carpenter.
All on general release from tomorrow.
ACTORS play many parts -- or at least the good ones do. Will Smith is
a well-known American television star, whose bid to make it big in the
cinema, Bad Boys, in which he co-stars with another television name,
Martin Lawrence, proves one of those hectic black cop, slapstick dramas
which Eddie Murphy has done to death. The pair do not give the genre the
kiss of life.
Directed by Don Simpson the link with Murphy is hardly surprising. It
comes from the Beverley Hill Cops stable for which Simpson and producer,
Jerry Bruckheimer, are responsible. Shot in Miami, the trademarks are
all there -- innumerable car chases, elaborate stunts, and a plot not
worth bothering about. The film stands and falls on whether one finds
the bickering twosome of Smith and Lawrence funny.
To be fair, however, neither man is another Eddie and the film has its
moments. Even if their endless macho rivalry, as they try to track down
thieves who took $100m in heroin from the allegedly impregnable Miami
police station vaults, gets awfully wearisome. The robbery is executed
with ingenuity, as have all screen thefts since the days of Rififi, but
when the crooks fall out they reveal themselves as numbskulls of a
higher than usual order patently incapable of such clever larceny.
On the other hand, the cops are just as thick, while Tia Leoni, the
obligatory pretty girl caught in the middle because she can identify the
thieves, is even more stupid.
The plot's gimmick is that the happily married Lawrence, the unpretty
one, is mistaken by Ms Leoni for the raunchy, good-looking bachelor,
Smith, and refuses to talk to anybody else. This requires Henpecked
Lawrence to pretend to be Lothario Smith, much to the annoyance of his
wife, while Smith acts jealous on the sidelines.
The film simply tries too hard, confusing energy with comic invention,
and a little stillness would have helped make it much more amusing. It
also does a disservice to Smith, to be seen shortly in Six Degrees of
Separation based on John Guare's play about a young black man who
infiltrated New York's high-rise society by pretending he was Sidney
Poitier's son.
That shows him as able to play polished high comedy with ease,
standing up to outstanding competition from the rest of a glittering
cast. But more about the film when it opens.
Bruce Beresford's Silent Fall is a polished thriller which would have
been better had it the courage to face up to the realities of the
situation it confronts and not tacked on a cop-out ending in order to
not upset the audience too much. A husband and wife are found stabbed to
death in their luxurious home. Their nine-year-old son is in a corner of
the living room, struck dumb with shock, fending off all comers with the
murder weapon. Their teenage daughter is found, bloodstained, hiding in
a clothes cupboard.
She says she interrupted an intruder, jumped on his back, was thrown
against the wall and remembers no more. The police are baffled. Their
one witness, the little boy, is unapproachable and mute.
The investigating sheriff, Mitch Rivers (J T Walsh), calls on an old
friend, a once prominent child psychiatrist, Jake Rainer (Richard
Dreyfus), for help. Jake gave up treating children after one of his
patients, an autistic child, committed suicide, and refuses to help. But
he identifies that the child is autistic, when, confronted with the
arrival of some orderlies with a strait-jacket, he is forced to help to
prevent what he knows will be terrible damage to the child. He persuades
him to hand over the knife.
The film concentrates on how Jake is then forced to face up to his own
demons as he treats the little boy, who refuses to speak except by
imitating other people's voices. Jake has also to cope with the sister
(Liv Tyler), who gets ever more dependent upon him and is clearly
manipulative and a threat.
Did the child do it? Autistic people, as the hostile psychiatrist
(John Lithgow) demonstrates, have amazing reserves of strength. Was it
the mother's lover? Why does the sister seem to get over it all so
quickly? And who was having sex with whom when the killings occurred,
because the evidence is most peculiar.
The problem with all thrillers is revealing too much, so I go no
further. But what left me queasy was exactly what left me distrusting
the Dustin Hoffman film Rainman, which suggested that autistic people
just needed a bit of tender loving care to become happy go lucky, if
eccentric members of the family.
Austistic people certainly need that kind of care, but they are also
very difficult to deal with, cause great stress for those who have to
provide it, particularly their families, and are afflicted with a
condition for which there is no known cure.
Rainer makes all these points during the film, which is impeccably
acted by a good cast, but the ending implies that the withdrawn little
boy (nine-year-old Ben Faulkner, very good indeed) has been cured. This
feel-good message does a disservice, not only to the audience, but to
sufferers from autism. A little more honesty would have made for a far
better, if less reassuring film.
If you take a strip of paper, twist it once and then join the two ends
together you end up with a Mobius strip, a loop which has only one
surface. Try it out. John Carpenter's In The Mouth of Madness is a bit
like that, a film which has no beginning, no end, and sets up one of
those situations from which there is no escape. Sam Neill plays
investigator John Trent hired by a publisher to track down a reclusive
horror writer, Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow) whose books drive all who
read them insane.
Somehow Neill ends up inside the books Cane has been writing, finding
himself in the classic Mobius strip predicament -- he tries to drive out
of town to escape from a mob of zombies driven mad by the books and
repeatedly ends up where he started, discovering to his horror that his
actions are being written by Cane and he has no free will.
Carpenter's inspiration was the horror writer, H P Lovecraft, who
believed there was another world lurking below the surface of the one we
live in, populated by horrible monsters just waiting to get out. In The
Mouth of Madness, looks at the power of the imagination to make people
not only do the strangest things, but accept them as real. Neill has a
splendid time hamming it up as the pop-eyed, cynical private eye up to
his neck in trouble, and Carpenter has directed it with considerable
panache never letting us forget there are things that go bump in the
night!

RELAX AND STAY HEALTHY
* Dr Lewis offers tips on controlling stress:
1. Imagine how you will feel about this situation in six months, or
six years' time.
2. Break big problems into smaller ones and solve these one at a time.
3. Be optimistic.
4. Laugh at life. Studies show nursery-age children laugh an average
of 450 times each day; adults only 15 times a day.
5. Stop worrying. It's been shown that most of the things we worry
about never happen.
6. Say positive, confidence-boosting things to yourself: ''Every day,
in every way, I'm getting better and better.''
7. Slow your life down. Learn to change gear by taking up a hobby that
cannot be rushed.
8. Massage is a simple natural way of reducing stress.
9. Moderate but regular exercise works wonders in banishing stress and
depression. The choice of leisure activity is not important, provided it
continues for 20 minutes.
Finally, try this simple wind-down exercise:
Sit down, relax, half-close your eyes, and focus on a spot on the
ground a few feet from you. Breathe slowly and deeply while
concentrating on this spot. Try to focus for a full 60 seconds. After 60
seconds, get up and return to your normal routine, carrying these
feelings of deep mental relaxation with you.
Compounding pressures at home and the office are raising stress levels
in society. ANN SHAW reports that successful time management and setting
life goals can help relieve built-up tension
SO, YOU are under stress. Here's a 60-second stress test to find out
if you are suffering from ''hurry sickness''.
Without looking at your watch, or silently counting seconds, estimate
the passing of one minute. When you think the time is up, check how much
time has actually elapsed.
What your result reveals:
Less than 55 seconds: You are a victim of ''hurry sickness'', and the
less time which elapsed the more serious your condition.
Between 55 and 65 seconds: Marginal, although you do not suffer from
''hurry sickness'' you may find there are too few hours in the day to
accomplish all you want or need to achieve.
More than 60 seconds: No problem. You have a very relaxed attitude to
the passing of time.
But what about the rest of us? My friends who tried this little test
failed miserably. We lead stressed lives, trying to cope with work,
home, kids, often trying to juggle half a dozen balls in the air at the
same time.
It's small comfort to be told that we are not alone. That we are all
caught up in a whirlwind of economic change with ''downsizing'' and
''re-engineering'' the buzz word of the nineties. Whatever the word
used, the result is the same: fewer staff coping with ever-increasing
work pressures.
Relentless advances in technology are accelerating these changes.
Those left in employment find their jobs changed beyond recognition. The
other day a former colleague returned to the office on a visit. He had
retired some eight years ago and had prided himself on the fact that he
could do any job on the editorial floor. Today, he said sadly, he would
not be able to do one.
Another affliction of the nineties is ''presenteeism''; those still in
work feel the need to be there all the time working even longer hours to
justify their wage packet.
For pyschologists it's boom time with a plethora of books telling us
how to cope with the stress of change. Pyschologist and time management
guru, Dr David Lewis, believes we can all learn to have an extra 10
hours a week if we manage our time properly.
This and more is explained in his book 10 Minute Time and Stress
Management (Piatkus Books, #17.99).
To start, keep a diary of your day. Spot the time bandits: is it
constant interruptions, needless meetings or unnecessary phone calls?
Once you have analysed exactly where your time goes you are in a better
position to start bringing about change.
Set yourself goals. What do you expect to be doing in five years'
time?
Did you know that American research at Yale University showed that
only 3% of its students had set themselves goals for life. Further
research confirms that more than 90% of the population has no clear-set
goals; we simply react to life around us. No wonder we are stressed.
Study yoga and meditation. An increasingly number of executives are
finding that Eastern philosophy offers genuine benefits for business. By
calming the mind and body you not only find it takes the stress out of
your life but makes it easier to reach business decisions as well.
Ed McCracken, chief executive of Silicon Graphics, has been meditating
daily for the past 10 years. He says it gives him greater confidence to
''let go of the feeling that I have to control everything''.

Over-the-counter medicine sales are rising in tandem with prescription
costs. Suffering from a mild cold, Ann Shaw tests the knowledge and
advice of city pharmacists in her search for relief
The shop assistant wanted to palm me off with some pastilles. I wanted
something stronger than that
HOW consistent is the advice pharmacists are providing? Rising
prescription costs are forcing more and more people to buy across the
counter, often taking the advice of the pharmacist. But what sort of
advise are they getting?
Fortuitously, I have a summer cold and tickly cough. Nothing serious.
At least not bad enough to book an appointment with the GP. So I checked
it out.
Where to start? Well, Boots, Queen Street station Glasgow is a
favourite with commuters, including myself. So handy. The shop assistant
wanted to palm me off with some pastilles. No, I want something stronger
than that.
''Could I see the pharmacist?''
For a fleeting second she frowned. ''Yes, certainly.''
A brisk young woman emerged. The no-nonsense sort. I got a grilling.
''What other symptoms do you have? How long have you had your cough? Are
you bringing up anything? Right, what other medication are you on?''
She produced a bottle of cough medicine. At this I was a bit
surprised.
''What about my sore throat?''
''This will do for that too!'' I didn't like to query it. Instead I
handed over #1.20 for a 200ml bottle of Pholcodine Linctus BP, a
standard cough remedy, and fled before she quizzed me further.
With an inquisition like that who needs doctors, certainly not for
minor complaints. Verdict: highly efficient, fast, reliable.
Oh yes, I can hear you saying, that's okay if you live or work in the
city centre, but what happens if you live elsewhere, such as one of the
poorer areas?
I went to Stewart Pharmacy in Duke Street, the heart of Dennistoun --
you can't get closer to Glasgow's East End than that. The shop is busy.
I have to jostle my way to the counter then join a queue. The man ahead
of me is waiting for his prescription. He has a nasty cough. No
mistaking that. The woman behind me is clutching an armful of
proprietary medicines. Clearly she's been down this route before. She
knows what works.
''Could I see the pharmacist?''
''Certainly,'' says the assistant.
A young woman appears. She looks a bit puzzled. Maybe she's not used
to being hauled out into the front shop to carry out an instant medical
diagnosis. This becomes obvious when she starts asking me questions. I
get the impression that somewhere in the inner recesses of her memory
she has learnt by heart the type of questions one should ask but she has
difficulty remembering them.
''How long have you had it?'' After a couple of questions she gives up
and moves into dispensing. ''This is the strongest I can give you
without a prescription,'' she says, producing a packet of 24 lozenges --
Dequacaine a powerful local anaesthetic with a fast-acting
anti-bacterial agent for a sore-throat. (That's what it said on the
packet.)
Real concern comes over the pharmacist's face: ''Its a bit pricey.''
She points to the price: #2.10. ''Are you sure that's alright?''
I nod.
''What about my cough?'' She seems to have forgotten about that.
She darts over to a shelf and grabs a 200ml bottle of Simple Linctus
(99p). Total #3.09.
Verdict: helpful, but harassed. She has got more on her mind than
dealing with simple coughs and colds. This is a run-down area and the
long queue of people are seriously in a poor state of health. You don't
need to be a doctor to see that.
On to the South Side, solid middle-class territory, with a sensible
no-nonsense approach to health. I drop in at L B Dunn in Victoria Road.
''Can I see the pharmacist?''
''Certainly,'' the alacrity with which the assistant replies is a
warning. A highly efficient young woman appears. I know instantly she
means business.
''How many days have you had your symptoms? What else are you
taking?'' A barrage of questions follows. No doctor could have been more
thorough. I half expected her to say: ''Open your mouth, let's see your
throat. Cough please!''
Instead, to my surprise, she says: ''I'll make you up something for a
cough.'' She disappears only to reappear a few minutes later with a
bottle.
''Take two spoonsful three times a day and at bedtime.'' It is
labelled The Tickly Cough Bottle. And the charge? #1.50. Smells just
like the others.
Verdict: Would have no hesitation returning there for advice.
Finally to the trendy West End. Moss in Byres Road, is a large and
very busy chemist shop which advertises in large lettering outside a
whole range of services including the fact that it ''sells oxygen'', and
dispenses both NHS and private prescriptions.
Yes, you could tell immediately this was the wealthier end of town: a
young woman in a fake Chanel outfit ahead of me complete with
accessoried dog is waiting for her prescription.
I repeat my request to see the pharmacist.
She asks two questions: ''Are you on any other form of medication?
Which bothers you most, the tickly throat and cough or the sore
throat?''
Then she reaches to a top shelf and picks up a small bottle of cough
medicine, Glycerin Lemon &amp; Honey with Glucose: ''That will be #1.19.''
''What about my sore throat?''
''This will do both. If you like I can sell you some throat lozenges
but to be honest any form of sweet will do.'' That was it.
Verdict: felt I would have got more personal service in a smaller
chemist with fewer people.
Finally, I was charged the most in the poorest part of the city and
the least in the most affluent. Yet the symptoms were exactly the same.
Three pharmacists prescribed for the cough only, while the Dennistoun
chemist treated both sore throat and cough.
An interesting point was that nobody suggested I visit the doctor, or
even seek further help if I was not better in a few days.
On the whole I was reasonably satisfied with the advice I received.
Oh, another thing. All the pharmacists were young and female. Is the
middle-aged male pharmacist a disappearing species?

ANN SHAW reports on a service which helps those suffering from
diabetes to come to terms with it more easily.
THE afternoon Christopher McColgan drank four pints of milk and a
carton of orange juice in four hours heightened suspicion in his mother.
Joan McColgan had already arranged for him to see their family doctor
the following morning because he had been ''off-colour'' for about a
fortnight.
A urine test the following day confirmed her fears. Her four-year-old
was diabetic. That was a year ago.
''I felt devastated,'' says Joan McColgan, who works as a housing
officer for an association for the elderly in Glasgow. ''There's no
history of diabetes in our family and our two older daughters are
fine.''
Her GP told her to take Christopher immediately to the Royal Hospital
for Sick Children at Yorkhill. She rushed back to the family home in
Drumsargard Road, Burnside, packed a suitcase and collected her mother
for emotional support.
''I felt certain Christopher would be kept in. Imagine my surprise,
after all the tests were done, to be called in to meet the diabetic team
and to be told that there was a new scheme for treating diabetics at
home rather than in hospital. I was thrilled.''
The team, headed by Dr Kenneth Robertson, consultant paediatrician,
aims to take diabetes care out of the hospital. This innovative service
launched 18 months ago in the city is successfully revolutionising early
treatment of diabetes.
Previously, newly diagnosed children would be required to spend
several weeks in hospital while they adjusted to an insulin regime which
they would have to follow for the rest of their lives.
''I was asked if I minded Christopher being treated at home. I said
'of course not, I'm delighted'.''
The following morning before 8am a specialist diabetes nurse arrived
to give him an insulin injection. Later in the morning the dietician
arrived to explain what foods Christopher would be allowed to eat and to
stress the importance of never missing a meal. For the next month both
nurse and dietician kept in close touch with the family with the nurse
arriving twice a day at first to give insulin, once before breakfast and
again before supper.
''Then we were taught how to give it and eventually Christopher was
shown how to inject himself too. They have been very supportive. Without
their practical help I don't think we would have been able to come to
terms with it so well,'' adds Joan McColgan.
''It all seemed very complicated at first but we have got into a
routine now. If Christopher is going to a party I know that I can give
him an extra dose of insulin to allow him to eat more and he won't come
to any harm.''
She says he has accepted the situation: ''He's a good wee boy.
Sometimes he will go for a week injecting himself then say that he's had
enough and we do it for him. There's no big scene. We just accept it.
''Only occasionally does he get fed up with the regime and says: 'I
don't want to be a diabetic any more. I don't want to give myself any
more injections'.''
The tragedy is that for children like Christopher it is a life
sentence, or until research comes up with an alternative.
Christopher still visit Yorkhill hospital on a three-monthly basis for
blood check-ups. Both Joan and her husband, John, a site agent, agree
that without the support of the diabetic team learning to live with a
diabetic child would have been more difficult: ''We have the home phone
numbers of all the staff and we have been told we can ring them night or
day if we are worried. So far I have only had to do it once.''
The family belong to the parent support group at Yorkhill and the
British Diabetic Association.
''At first I was too upset to talk about it with other parents but I
have come to terms with it now,'' she says.
Meanwhile Dr Robertson considers the expense of treating a child
within his own home environment to be justified because of the benefits
gained. He heads a team of two other consultants, three specialist
diabetes nurses, and a full-time diabetes dietician with further input
from a clinical psychologist. The hospital hopes that the diabetes
service will become a role model in the future for treating other
conditions within the community.

THE independence of the Scottish legal system was never in doubt.
Until very recently it didn't exist. In domestic matters its pretences
to being a national law amounted to no more than a parochial clucking
and scratching on an Edinburgh dunghill; in international matters it
knew its place. Its place was by the fireside, a peat fireside, with
rain drip drip drip dripping through the thatch.
These comments apply just as much to the judges as to ordinary
lawyers. None of them, judges, solicitors, advocates, ever had any idea
of what it was like to be independent. All of them thought with one
mind, and that mind had ''Made In England'' engraved upon it.
Oh yes, they were trained in the Scottish Legal Tradition, but the
Scottish Legal Tradition is a post-Union development, and it has the
inbuilt factor that in a conflict of laws with any other jurisdiction,
particularly England, Scots law must cringe and give way.
Give a Scots lawyer a problem of international flavour and he would
look to England for the solution. If the problem involved England then
every Scots lawyer fell on his back and kicked his legs in the air
shouting, ''No contest! No contest!''. One word from England, or even
one word in a southern accent and Scots lawyers, and Scots judges, did
whatever English legal thinking deemed appropriate.
Top Scots lawyers needed no tuition in this. English-educated and
English-trained, they administered Scotland as a northern colony and
kept us Scots from getting uppity. If it is thought that I exaggerate,
read the judgments in the case John MacCormick and I raised 40 years ago
over the meaning of the Treaty of Union. In particular read Lord
Guthrie's judgment. Read it knowing that out of the hundreds of legal
firms in Edinburgh, not one was willing to act for us. They all feared
fire from heaven. More precisely they feared ostracism and an
anti-English tag. To the shame of legal Edinburgh we had to use an
incomer from the Isle of Mull. So much for independent Scots lawyers!
The Scots lawyer will claim that this inbuilt cringe is not his own
fault. ''It's them,'' he'll bleat, pointing in every direction except
his own breast. ''We've no parliament to keep our laws up to date,''
he'll add. ''Our highest court of all is in England in the House of
Lords.'' He may be right, but the legal profession in any country must
be independent and brave or it merely becomes a rubber stamp for tyranny
as has happened so often here in the very Scotland we claim to be
Scotland the Free.
Think what the Scottish legal profession has done in the past and you
will see what I mean. The order for the Massacre of Glencoe was signed
by a Scots lawyer, the son of Stair of Stair's Principles. We Scots
lawyers aided and abetted the genocide after Culloden. We actively
supported the Clearances and are as guilty of them as if our own hand
had put torch to thatch.
We turned a blind eye to the slavery that tied indentured miners to
the pits even when they were children and unable to create any
obligations under contract, except the one-way obligation of slavery.
That was all done in the name of being a Scots lawyer. There was profit
in it.
It is these facts that in the past have made me look at my brother
lawyers and despair. No doubt I shall be accused of using the male as an
example. It may well be that women will behave differently but so far
all they have done is run fast to behave like little moneymaking men, so
I doubt it.
Despite the sorry history of the Scots lawyer I am still optimistic.
There are signs of reform, not very great signs I admit, but still
signs. The Court of Session has taken on first of all the BBC and now
the railways and has done its job without cringing. The BBC and the
railways may not be the giants of the South, but there is no doubt which
way the Government would have liked the decision to go. The actions of
both the BBC and the railways were inspired by the executive, and it is
something new in Scots law to see the Scottish judiciary take a firm
stand on anything that has the Government hand to it.
The indication should not be lightly ignored. The resolution of
differences between the Scottish and English parliaments will have to
take place in some form of Constitutional Court and it is inconceivable
that the Court of Session should not have a say in the matter. What we
are seeing in these recent judgments may not be the broad sunny uplands
of a free country. But don't laugh. We could be watching the first green
shoots of a Scottish judicial independence.

* WOMEN are being invited to post a pink postcard to the Prime
Minister asking for more money to be spent on breast cancer research.
The National Postcard Campaign for Breast Cancer, launched last week
in Edinburgh by the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign, seeks to highlight
the fact that over 15,000 women die annually from the disease yet most
research funding comes from the voluntary sector.
Postcards are available from the Secretary, Scottish Breast Cancer
Campaign, PO Box 12202, Edinburgh EH4 1ZX. They are free but a small
donation would be welcome. For further details ring 0131 447 0511/01968
678 395.
* ''GRANNY BASHING'' is one of society's taboos. Yet it happens both
within the home and some residential care homes. A conference in
Edinburgh today will tackle some of the issues raised by the ill
treatment of elderly people.
Speakers will address the issues of hidden abuse, where staff at
institutions can abuse their patients and clients without realising it.
Although aimed mainly at professionals working with the elderly, the
conference, organised by Queen Margaret College, is open to the public.
Further information from Lindsey Irvine, Department of Health and
Nursing, Queen Margaret College (phone: 0131 317 3000).
* A NEW directory listingall sources of training and advice for local
care groups is being put together by the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations. Organisations or individuals involved in training and
development who wish to be included should contact Jane Griffiths on
0131 556 3882.
* THE latest deaf aids will be on show at open days on Friday and
Saturday organised by the National Deaf Children's Society in
Birmingham. These will be held in the society's Technology Information
Centre and will be of particular interest to professionals working with
deaf children in the fields of health, education, and social services.
Many new products will be shown for the first time alongside hearing
aids, flashing lights, text telephones and computer wizardy, and
listening devices. Further information from the National Deaf Children's
Society, 15 Dufferin Street, London EC1Y 8PD. Phone: 0171 259 0123.
* THE NHS runs a free helpline offering advice on everything from
vaccinations to patients' rights? A team of trained volunteers will help
you work your way through the medical bureaucracy if you want to lodge a
complaint, find out about waiting times or want information on local
medical treatment.
You can call Network Scotland, which runs the NHS helpline, any
weekday between 9am and 5pm on 0800 224488. What's more, you'll get a
real person at the other end, not a recorded message telling you to ring
yet another number.

SUMMER in Scotland and a time of rude awakening. Foreign holidaymakers
who have spent the winter months poring over the brochure gloss of the
clans, tartans and Nessie are on their way, keenly anticipating a
meeting with the real thing. They will want to walk in strath and glen,
take the Road to the Isles, visit a distillery, buy mill seconds
knitwear in a ''sale'' and above all, enjoy that fabled Highland
Hospitality. Which is where, alas, they will suffer a severe jolt.
Coffee will be their downfall.
Coffee in every other part of the world where coffee is to be had is
recognisable as coffee. It is served hot, usually in cups, and made from
beans which have been roasted, ground, and run through with water.
Simple, really, with the end product a delight be it sipped in a bazaar
or on a boulevard. Stimulant, sustainer and the elixir over which the
young sort out the world's problems sometime between midnight and 4am.
Coffee is clever stuff.
But not above the Highland Line it isn't. There they do it
differently, making what they so quaintly call coffee from something
that has been expressed from a yak, sieved to remove the odd hair,
diluted 10 parts water to one part yak concentrate, left to become
lukewarm and then served at a sum per cup sufficient to buy your very
own yak calf if you can but make it from Kinlochdrool to Ulan Bator.
Just imagine the potential if ever you manage the trip: small yaks
become big yaks and with one of these the lethargic with a Highland
Board grant, backing from the EC and a derivatives loan from Barings
Bank could set up their own coffee shop and offer Highland Hospitality
to foreign holidaymakers anxious to stride the clan lands, wear the
tartan and pretend they have had an almost sighting of Nessie, maybe.
Should we be so lucky?
Now at this point it would be nice to admit that I am exaggerating,
taking the Michael as they say in these parts, pulling the collective
catering leg. But you know that is not true -- must know it if ever you
have ventured north of Callander without benefit of a vacuum flask and a
firm resolve not to be suckered inside hospitality's front door just
because you need the facilities of what the Americans so quaintly call
comfort stations.
The bald fact of the matter is that when it comes to the provision of
coffee in the Highlands -- the exceptions, both of them may write and
stake their claim to excellence -- chance would be a fine thing.
The grounds of my complaint about coffee tendered in the north is --
why do they do it? Why do they serve something that is not and claim it
is? Why am I served yak sap at 90p a cup under the guise of coffee
whenever I venture north of the big whirly roundabout at the Edinburgh
end of the M8?
Being Scottish and therefore stoic, my genes demanding that I suffer
in silence, I have in the past sipped my Highland Hospitality coffee,
grimaced, left it severely alone, paid up and left. I am trying to train
myself to lose my cool and demand an explanation as well as a refund but
so far heredity has triumphed over heat.
Imagine, however, the reaction of, let us say, a French family doing
the tour. They have been to Edinburgh Castle and photographed les
enfants beside Mons Meg. They have done the National Gallery and the
People's Palace, visited Govan in the hope of bumping into Gregor Fisher
and bought string vests at source. Now, culturally sated, marvelling at
the Auld Alliance, they head north.
The now-you-see-it-now-you-don't dual carriageway of the A9 noted, the
number of blue-rinse coach tours blitzing from the Bronte country to
John O'Groats and back inside 24 hours remarked upon, our French friends
are ready for a cup of good strong coffee, perhaps a fresh croissant to
go with it. What is the French for ''you must be joking''?
And so they stop at Grannies Heilan' Hame Cafe or Rob Roy's Croft and
saunter inside with the insouciance for which they are, as a nation,
noted. It will not last long. Will they take their coffee noir or au
lait, perhaps getting into the mood, they will try it in au facon de Rob
Roy -- a wee dram stirred in. Not a hope, of course, but they will,
certainly, need the wee dram after they discover what passes here for
coffee.
Shattered, disillusioned, their string vests in disarray, they will
stagger from beneath the thatch and vow ''never again''. Their taste
buds suffering the gastronomic equivalent of a computer virus, they
flee. In fields and on foothills, hock deep in sepia-tinted lochans,
they see herds of large shaggy animals with horns. They recall the
Highland Cattle in the tourist brochures and, perking up after
disappointment, make their second big mistake of the day. For they are
not. They are yaks.

THERE must be one, but it's hard to think of a piece of legislation
with a less ambiguous title than the Single European Act. It means what
it says, just as it did in 1987 when Margaret Thatcher put her name to
it: ''An area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of
goods, persons, services, and capital is ensured.''
The agreement reached at Maastricht in December 1991 was equally
clear. Though the United Kingdom secured its ''opt-out'' from the
Charter of Social Rights, that summit laid down a treaty framework for
union, including political and monetary union. Whatever she pretends
now, history will show that Thatcher, battling like a pantomime charger,
laid the groundwork; Major just signed the thing.
All of this is worth remembering amid her twee recollections of a
distinctly odd childhood and her cynical book-plugging (Greater love
hath no woman than to lay down her party for Rupert Murdoch). As for the
frothing invective against a successor she anointed, that only confirms
what was long suspected about her faculties.
The real point is this: if the Tories have a problem with Europe, the
old lady with the funny eyes created it for them. The credit is hers.
Thatcher's effrontery, not to mention her auto-amnesia, is therefore
breathtaking. Interviewed for the umpteenth time on television this
week, she said, in sum, that chancellors come and go but decisions
affecting the currency endure. Therefore John Major should disavow a
single currency forthwith, whatever Kenneth Clarke believes.
Yet this, please recall, is the woman who alleges she only took us
into the Exchange Rate Mechanism at the insistence of Chancellor Major.
In other words, to extricate herself from a Cabinet squabble, the
champion of British sovereignty played fast and loose with the currency
and paved the way for the ERM debacle of 1992.
As to that farce, we now have Norrie Lamont joining her ladyship and
telling Major to ''get off the fence'' (presumably the one from which he
himself was pushed), adding: ''If it was up to me, I would say no,
never, to a single currency now.''
But just what, if not a preparation for monetary union, was Britain's
adventure within the ERM when Lamont was chancellor? Neither he nor
Thatcher before him could have been under any illusion. Oh yes: Norrie
was against it all along -- he just didn't happen to mention the fact
until the overpromoted chum who had promoted him beyond his merits took
his job away.
There are two kinds of Tory anti-Europeans: those who play for
advantage, personal or political, and those who believe sincerely that
greater integration will lead Europe generally, and Britain in
particular, to disaster. As far as consistency goes, the former group,
of which Thatcher remains patron saint, has form as long as your arm. In
office they accepted the realities; out of it they wrap themselves in
the flag.
Lamont is a good example. Thatcher managed to say one thing while
doing another, but Norrie was never blessed with timing. His crusade
against Europe is recognised everywhere as a pathetic vendetta against
the man whose campaign manager he was. Thatcher, despite her record in
office, at least pretends her spite is for the public good.
The authentic Europhobes are more interesting, if only because they
boast real principles, however wacky. What's more, they are winning
their war. They may not expect much while Major lasts, but they have
good reason to believe the Tories in Opposition will be firmly, rabidly
anti-European.
Nicholas Budgen, writing in yesterday's Herald, gave a good example of
what this splinter group, proud to have rallied 50 MPs to a meeting, is
about. He cited a ''huge display of public opinion on British
nationalism'', and added: ''We hope to restore the powers of
Westminster. In doing so we shall also help to preserve the union of the
United Kingdom.''
It may be, as Budgen seemed to recognise, that there's the rub. Rows
over the Common Agricultural Policy no longer answer. The CAP consumed
60% of the EU's budget in 1990, but in 1993 it was down, and falling, to
51.2%.
Besides, 60% of Britain's farming industry, and all those rural seats,
received direct support from EU subsidies in 1993.
Mystical patriotism rather than good business, once a Tory virtue,
thus becomes the issue. Budgen's group wish to repatriate sovereignty
and dissolve a treaty they dislike. Yet many Scots would say something
similar.
The flaw in the Eurosceptic argument, after all, is that anything said
about the EU can be said about the United Kingdom.
What is the UK if not a political, economic, and monetary union in
which sovereignty theoretically is pooled but in reality surrendered?
How is it possible to argue that the UK should loosen, if not sever,
ties with the EU while maintaining that a parallel arrangement within
Britain approaches perfection?
Budgen recognises the danger, claiming that a ''resuscitated
Westminster will be both a barrier and a challenge to separatism. So
long as Westminster is revered and supported, it will be more difficult
for the Scottish Nationalists to appeal directly to the European
institutions''.
Casting off Europe is necessary, in other words, lest Scots prefer
European institutions (the social rights charter, perhaps?) to what
Westminster has to offer.
But if the structure of our union with England is the same as that of
Britain's union with Europe what, save ''reverence'', should stop us
choosing the relationship that will do most good for our people, and
allow us to recover a little pride in the process? And where, if not on
a charabanc trip to Agincourt, will England's patriots be then?

MR DONALD McNEILL, chief executive of South Ayrshire NHS Trust, says
that his agreement with Ayrshire and Arran Health Board is now in
tatters as a result of the Government's instruction to drop all strings
from the 3% pay offer (June 10).
Good! Maybe next time, chief executives like Mr McNeill will pay more
attention to what the trade unions are saying.
It is clear from what he is saying that health boards have not given
trusts enough money to cover the full 3% pay rise for NHS staff. Which
means that most of the 3% on offer from trusts in Scotland will have to
be clawed back either by making substantial efficiency savings -- a
euphemism for cuts in services -- or by making the staff pay for their
own increases.
The offers tabled by trusts as a result of the recent instruction by
the Scottish NHS Chief Executive -- a fine illustration of their
so-called independence -- reveal horrendous times ahead for health
service workers. Some trusts want to stop paying extra money for working
on Bank Holidays, and a number want to freeze allowances and other pay
enhancements at 1994 levels.
This is against a background where important provisions that help to
protect the terms and conditions of NHS staff following reorganisation
or restructuring, an increasing occurrence in today's NHS, are due to be
wiped out by the Government by the end of September.
The answer for Mr McNeill and his colleagues is, of course, obvious.
Instead of jumping to the tunes of the Scottish Office, they should be
supporting the unions' national campaign to ensure that all NHS staff
get the 3% unconditionally and that the 3% increase, on both pay and
allowances, is fully funded by the Government.
Such aims surely benefit both staff and management alike.

BRIAN WILSON claims that Conservative opposition to a minimum national
wage is ''another argument which they have comprehensively lost'' (June
9), but this is most definitely not the case.
Let us take, by way of illustration, the case of an apprentice
hairdresser earning perhaps #2.50 an hour. I accept that it is not an
ideal wage, and that there are many people earning less than that, some
1.3 million by his reckoning.
Suppose that a new Labour Government were to introduce a minimum wage
of #4 an hour, a figure currently being mooted by several influential
union bosses and still far below the EU ''decency threshold'' of #5.80
an hour.
The employer of the apprentice hairdresser cannot afford this 60% wage
increase and so has to lay the apprentice off.
The end result of Brian Wilson's much vaunted minimum wage is to end
the dreams and aspirations of another young person who is now
effectively on the scrapheap, claiming benefit, thus costing the
taxpayer more money and adding another figure to the unemployment total
which the Conservative Government has successfully reduced by almost 25%
in the past two years.
Brian Wilson does not seem to grasp the concept that there are many
young people like the hairdresser on a low wage, but that this wage will
rise as he/she becomes more proficient and is given more responsibility.
Instead, he/she is thrown on to the scrapheap by the imposition of a
minimum wage which could see the unemployment rate, especially among the
young, rocket.
I also notice that Brian Wilson refuses to set a precise figure
because he believes ''that establishing the principle is infinitely more
important than choosing a figure''.
This roughly means that they have absolutely no idea about the effect
that this move will have on the British economy, and that they are
running scared of the truth.
He states that it will be a ''landmark'', and I find myself agreeing
with him -- a landmark in history because it will be the moment when the
economy and the country is finally brought to its knees by Labour's
economic madness.
It is better to have our hairdresser earning #2.50 an hour and having
some hint of self-esteem, and with a real chance of advancement in that
job, than to have him or her unemployed and on benefit, disillusioned
and bitter with no future to speak of whatsoever.

HAS it not yet dawned on Alf Young (Knowing the score, June 6) that
the purpose of the board of any company is to run that company to make
money for its owners -- even if it is a newspaper?
When a company has debtors there is always a struggle as to who can
get how much, and a public company is by, definition, in hock to its
shareholders.
The tension is not caused by envy, but by power and greed. When you
only control 20% of the debt you do not have much power, and once you
have got the power you know that you deserve anything you get.
Why stuff your wallet with politics when everyone else uses money?

WHAT utter rubbish the Rev Maxwell Craig writes (June 13).
At a recent meeting of Prayer Across Scotland held through the Home
Mission committee of the Presbytery of Paisley, we heard of an imminent
closure of a Church of Scotland home and how half the homes run by the
church could close before the end of the century through lack of
funding.
Extra parochial appointments have also to be cut back because of lack
of finance.
In the light of these and other disturbing failings, for him to say
that ''the church scene in Scotland looks brighter than for many a day''
seems to me to be ridiculous.

AN advert in a Strathclyde police magazine provokes an outcry because
it dares to discriminate in favour of Protestants.
Seven teaching posts were advertised in The Herald appointments and
education section on June 13. Each was clearly identified as being open
to Roman Catholics only.
Looking at the logic of Mr Hugh McLoughlin's letter (June 13) he would
interpret the first paragraph as being anti-Catholic and the second as
being an enforcement of the rights of the Roman Catholic Church.
However he need not worry. If the future of the church is in the
vision of Rev Maxwell Craig and Action of Churches Together in Scotland
(June 13) there will be only one church.
Our members view with distaste the insalubrious fealty paid to the
proposal by Cardinal Winning to the Kirk's General Assembly, and to the
papal encyclical, by this group.
If they are allowed to continue unhindered in their attempts to
de-stabilise the national Kirk, then the Roman Catholic Church, and all
that that implies, would become the dominant force in Scotland.
However, the Rev Maxwell Craig would be out of a job were this
conclusion reached as there would be no place for Action of Churches
Together in Scotland.

THE letters under the heading ''Religion'' (June 13) were led off,
quite rightly I believe, by the letter from Eric Stockton. Possibly the
secular ethic is the contemporary instrument of the Holy Spirit.
Action of Churches Together in Scotland is so blatantly the SNP at
prayer and so very political that the professional clergy who run that
organisation make Eric Stockton seem comparatively spiritual.
On a recent visit to the Holy Land, in serene Galilee where Jesus came
on the lake through a gap in the hills at Magdala, it was possible to
realise that the churches may well form an obstacle to spiritually
inspired living.
In the open air and remembering Jesus's teaching commitment over three
years, the churches seemed so insignificant.
The secular ethic is not perfect, naturally, but it is, unlike the
churches, not self-centred. It is a matter for regret that the epithet
''liberal'' is attached to the secular ethic, as Liberalism in the late
sixties denoted licence and has been abused.
Thus adjustment to Mr Stockton's secular ethic could make it a force
for spiritual good.

AM I alone in seeing merit in the works of MacDiarmid and Shelley,
Keats and Eliot, and Pound and Byron (what did I do with that McGonagall
anthology)?
Poetry and poets ought to be compared and contrasted. This is an
important critical avenue after all, but not in the manner of Messrs
Brown, Smith, and Riach who seem more to resemble a bunch of bar-room
cronies who, as closing time approaches, are still debating the merits
of Marciano and Ali and whether one would have ''whopped'' the other --
an entertaining diversion but a diversion none the less.

I WAS reading the report on the ''Mosquing'' of the new Glasgow
council by your municipal correspondent John MacCalman and my eyes
almost popped out of my head as I read the quotes attributed to
Councillor McFadden, and Thomas Winning (June 13).
Councillor McFadden is reputed to have said: ''This is a new council
with new ways and he'll (Dr Morris) just have to live with it.'' Will
this be the attitude of the New Labour Party with new ways that the
pollsters tell us will be our next Government?
Thomas Winning is reputed to have said: ''Anything that helps towards
establishing good relationships in our multicultural community should be
welcomed.'' It would seem to me that Roman Catholics and Muslims make
strange bedfellows.
The late George Orwell would have been proud of this example of
doublespeak. Did Thomas Winning not mean, ''Anything that helps towards
the destruction of reformed religion in Scotland should be welcomed?''

ALLOW me a little space to reply finally to Duncan Brown (Triple
disaster of MacDiarmid, June 13), and then no more. There are better
things to do than trade insults with someone who clearly has more
energies to invest in writing letters to the press than in reading,
studying, and considering the poetry he is talking about.
I have nothing to say about his literary judgments. He has his
opinions; I have mine. They have been aired clearly enough. It has to be
emphasised, however, that his opinions are unsubstantiated, either by
any literary evidence from the poems themselves, or by any worthwhile
critical consensus, or by any respected and learned authority. My
opinions are.
Persons will have their own notions of the significance of historical
events. The result, both direct and indirect, of MacDiarmid's work, like
that of the work of any great poet, is the way we think of ourselves.
Because he was so stubbornly a national figure MacDiarmid's legacy to
the culture of this country has changed the way we think of ourselves as
Scots. Mr Brown's very letters themselves are evidence of that.
The cultural event of the Scottish literary Renaissance has altered
the way Scotland can be understood and represented, both within the
country and internationally, and in that respect I do not think it is an
exaggeration to say that MacDiarmid was the most important thing to
happen in Scotland since the Treaty of Union in 1707.
In the end it depends on how much you value culture, art, music,
literature, poetry.
Mr Brown clearly treasures McGonagall more than MacDiarmid. And he
will most probably carry on hurling stones at MacDiarmid and at other
great poets such as T S Eliot and Ezra Pound -- and at me.
Let him. It will not suffice. We are all too far out of his range.

MAY I help Ethel S Goodall (June 3) to understand why Roseanna
Cunningham, MP -- and Dr Winifred Ewing, MEP, after the European
elections in 1994 -- was given a white rose.
In Hugh MacDiarmid's Selected Poetry, 1992, there is the following
poem entitled The Little White Rose of Scotland, part of which says:--
The rose of all the world is not for me.
Only the little white rose of Scotland,
That smells sharp and sweet --
And breaks the heart.

I AM enlightened to learn from Derek Reid's letter (June 6) that the
Scottish Tourist Board is attempting more than simply jumping on the
backs of the current spate of Scottish westerns to stem our tourism
haemorrhage.
Would it not have been sensible, however, to use part of the g enerous
Herald space allocated to his article to detail these efforts? And will
he seek such space on a monthly basis to update the trade on the success
or otherwise of his various promotions?
The tourism operators are crying out for leadership and are not as yet
convinced that they have a Rob Roy to the fore.

SEVERAL months ago Strathclyde Regional Council Highways Committee
warned that the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow would be closed for two
periods of 14 days this year in order that repairs could take place. To
date it would appear that no dates have been mentioned.
For businesses, bus companies, and people going on holiday, it is
essential that these dates are published soon. The police will have to
divert traffic to other routes. Holidaymakers coming to Scotland from
Europe, England and Ireland will need to adjust their routes.
It was also announced by the same committee that the swing bridge
across the River Cart at Inchinnan was to close this year for six
months. Nothing has so far been published about dates.
As there are buses running from Inchinnan, Erskine, and Bishopton to
Renfrew and Paisley each day it is essential that the dates are
published in order that they may make alternative arrangements. Car
owners from Kilmacolm, Houston and Bridge of Weir will also be affected.
Furthermore, the public would like assurances that it is safe for
heavy lorries and buses to use this bridge as it is understood that
repairs are required to the foundations.

THE economy is continuing to grow but its rate of expansion is slowing
if the latest employment figures are any guide. Unemployment is still
falling, and has done so for 21 consecutive month now, but the rate of
decline is becoming more modest. At 10,000, seasonally adjusted, last
month's fall was approximately half that of April. These figures are
consistent with the view that the economy is responding to the tight
monetary and fiscal policies maintained by the Government and may
therefore manage to escape the higher interest rates still predicted by
some economists. UK rates could be, if not at their peak, then very
close to it in the present cycle. Of course, because of low inflation,
they are higher in real terms than they seem, and even most gloomy
forecasts do not see them rising very much further. Since increased
earnings are running at the same rate as last year there is no evidence
of wage-induced inflation. The effect of weak sterling is a different
story, but sterling appears to be stabilising and if the hopes of lower
American and German rates were to materialise that trend would be
enhanced.
The Chancellor used his Mansion House speech last night to proclaim
''steady as she goes'', reiterating his commitment to a 2.5% inflation
target for another year and promising the interest-rate policy required
to do so. To the extent that his judgment has been vindicated by events
since he refused to increase rates in May there will be little
temptation to doubt his word, and willingness to be tough, even though
the Government has every political reason to avoid anything which would
worsen the plight of mortgage payers and those businesses with large
borrowings. The employment data, which are otherwise encouraging, still
show more than 8% of the workforce to be out of work; and the total
number of jobs in the economy has fallen during the last quarter. These
aspects of our difficulties excite little attention -- the whole of
Western Europe has come to live with unemployment levels which would
have seemed totally unacceptable even two decades ago. Public opinion
seems to take in its stride our inability to create new jobs on a scale
sufficient to bring people into work in line with the post-war
assumptions about full employment. We are becoming reconciled to
permanent large-scale unemployment even if not the mass unemployment of
the Depression.
It is possible that, if the optimists prove to be correct and interest
rates do not need to rise, there will be a steady economic improvement
lasting into next year. This could give the recovery its second wind,
and that possibility more than the Government's political fortunes is
what should motivate the conduct of monetary policy. It would be better
for that if the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England saw
eye to eye, but, as the Governor pointed out last night, we shall all
soon to be in a position to know the exact extent of their disagreement
last month. At this stage their difference appears to have been fairly
modest. The economy is at a point where there is little scope for
excitement unless a warm summer stimulates retail consumers, who at
least will remain uninhibited by dearer money. There could always be the
unexpected from import prices, especially from commodities priced in
dollars which might jump were that currency to get sudden new life. But
in the absence of such shocks ''Steady as she goes'' seems about right.

THE United Nations believes that as many as 4 million Iraqis are
desperately short of food. Of these a quarter are already so badly
placed as to be threatened by death. Malnutrition is certainly very
widespread and mortality among young children has soared. UN specialist
agenecies produced a joint report to this effect last month and details
of its contents are now being leaked out to the international press.
Although there may be some distance to go until a massive crisis is upon
us, the build-up to one can be discerned as the UN sanctions originally
imposed to counter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait remain in force. That
the trade sanctions have failed to move Saddam Hussein's Government even
now is something which should be remembered by all those who would have
preferred their use to that of the military force which eventually freed
Kuwait: they are a very uncertain instrument when dealing with
dictatorial regimes.
The UN itself has tried to moderate the impact of the sanctions on
humanitarian grounds and in areas of humanitarian concern. An attempt to
allow the Iraqis to sell part of their oil on world markets, provided
the proceeds went to humanitarian relief, has twice failed because of
the obduracy of the Iraqi Government. It insists that sanctions infringe
its sovereignty and any partial relief is not possible since that would
confirm that it accepts the legitimacy of those that remain. The only
obvious beneficiaries of this stance are other oil producers who are
getting a better price for their product than would be the case if the
Iraqis were free to turn their taps on and increase the supply. As it
is, in spite of their mutual hostility, the Iraqis are managing to sell
some oil through Iranian outlets and that may easily be enough to keep
the political and military elites, on whom President Saddam Hussein
depends, in the lifestyles to which they have become accustomed. There
does not seem to be any means whereby those badly affected by sanctions
can do much about it, either by protest or by force: their Government
has displayed a consistent ruthlessness in containing such activities.
The dilemma is obvious. If the UN climbs down and ends the sanctions,
Baghdad will proclaim a victory. If it keeps the trading bans in place
the suffering will become progressively more acute and its own
responsibility for it may seem harder to avoid. In fact the
responsibility for the suffering is firmly with the Iraqi Government.
The international community, but particularly the United States which is
reluctant to let Saddam away with anything more, may have to eat their
words if many thousands are not to die. When the allies decided not to
enforce the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime by capturing Baghdad
after the success of Desert Storm, they left themselves in a position of
weakness. The earlier hopes that either regional uprisings or a military
coup would topple the regime evaporated quickly and it became obvious
that only a return to force (as in Kurdistan) or its immediate threat
(as in the case of nuclear installations) could compel Baghdad to do
what the UN wanted. There is no comparable focus in the present case.
The UN cannot compel Saddam to feed his own people properly and provide
them with medical care and attention when it is sanctions which deprive
him of the easiest means of doing so. It may be galling to accept the
need to give way, but it needs to be asked whether anyone is benefiting
from these sanctions being maintained much longer.

<TEXT>
SACKED Mod boss Donnie Maclean has won his bid to clear his name at an
industrial tribunal.
The former national director of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which organises
the annual Royal National Mod, claimed unfair dismissal.
His solicitor was notified yesterday that the bid was successful and
that Mr Maclean had been awarded unspecified compensation but with a
reduction of 65%.
The maximum compensation award by a tribunal is #11,000.
The tribunal had heard that Mr Maclean was suspended in January 1994
just days after new chief executive Donald John Macsween took over as
his boss.
He was subsequently sacked on several grounds, including alleged theft
of items belonging to An Comunn.
He was also blamed for the financial disaster of the Airdrie Mod
Fringe in 1993.
Mr Macsween denied at the tribunal that he was brought in as ''a
hitman'' to get rid of Mr Maclean.
Solicitor Angus Macdonald, for Mr Maclean, yesterday said: ''We will
not know if this decision to reduce compensation means the tribunal held
Mr Maclean to be liable for something until we get the full findings
which could take a few weeks.
''But he has won. That decision of the tribunal completely clears his
name.'' Speaking on Donnie Maclean's behalf, he added: ''He is obviously
delighted with the outcome. The reason for bringing this case was to
clear his name.''
Neither the chief executive nor president of An Comunn, Mrs Ann
Draper, were available to comment last night.
Insiders were speculating last night that the tribunal's decision now
clears the way for a civil action by Mr Maclean against An Comunn and
possibly Mr Macsween.

Robbie Dinwoodie reports how today's by-election in North Down,
Belfast, poses further problems for the Government
CONSIDER this. Well-to-do voters in one of the most affluent
constituencies in the country are about to buck the political
establishment and humiliate the Government by sending a socialist lawyer
to Westminster, turning a deaf ear to smears comparing the candidate to
the Nazis.
Surely we have been through all this last month in Perth and Kinross?
Well, it's about to happen again in North Down, Belfast's wealthy
commuter belt along the so-called ''Gold Coast'' road to Bangor, the
Edwardian seaside resort reborn in the 1990s as home to one of Britain's
biggest marinas.
Of course, there is a huge gulf between the politics of the two
campaigns. Roseanna Cunningham stood for the SNP on a ticket of making
Scotland independent of Britain, while Robert McCartney is standing on
precisely the opposite demand, calling himself a United Kingdom Unionist
and seeking the strengthening of the Union and ever-closer integration
of Northern Ireland with the rest of Britain.
The significance of a victory for McCartney in today's by-election to
select a successor to the late Sir James Kilfedder would be felt in both
London and in Northern Ireland.
For the Government it would further pare their slim Westminster
majority and deliver a damning verdict from the Unionist community on
concessions made as part of the peace process.
For the politics of Northern Ireland, a resounding win for McCartney
could undermine, possibly fatally, efforts to organise the Conservative
Party as a political force there; it could inflict serious damage on
James Molyneux's leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party; and it would
create reverberations within the Democratic Unionist Party, which has
endorsed the campaign of McCartney in spite of his past clashes with Ian
Paisley.
Sir James Kilfedder held the constituency for 25 years, first as UUP
candidate and then as an Ulster Popular Unionist after splitting with
his party over the extent of Enoch Powell's influence.
He was more closely aligned with the Government than other Unionists,
even supporting the poll tax, and he took it as a betrayal when the
Conservative Party organised in North Down and fielded a candidate
against him at the last General Election, Dr Laurence Kennedy coming
within 5000 votes of him.
In 1987 there was also trouble. Local Unionists selected McCartney to
fight the seat but were ordered by headquarters to give the sitting MP a
clear run to unite opposition to the British-Irish Agreement. They
refused, McCartney came within 4000 votes of winning, he was expelled
and the constituency party was disbanded. Unionists say McCartney is now
driven by revenge, which he denies.
There are eight candidates this week, three of whom can expect to lose
their deposit -- Natural Law's James Anderson; Michael Brooks, standing
on a ''Free Para Lee Clegg Now'' ticket; and local taxi driver Chris
Carter as ''Ulster's Independent Voice''.
A fourth candidate, Independent Unionist Alan Chambers, has no chance
of winning but may take enough votes to determine who does. As a local
councillor and shopkeeper, and a friend of the former MP, he is hoping
these credentials will bring him support. He is most likely to hurt the
official Unionist who is neither local nor experienced in political
office.
The Alliance Party has watched its share of the poll in the
constituency slip from over 22% to under 15% over the past decade and is
looking to veteran Sir Oliver Napier to arrest that.
But as the only candidate prepared to accept the framework document as
the basis for further negotiation, he admits: ''This is probably the
most Unionist constituency in Northern Ireland. It has been totally
unaffected by the troubles, it might as well be Surrey.
''I'm saying we need to change, to reach an accommodation between
nationalism and unionism. But they are saying, 'I'm all right, Jack'.
They don't see a need for change.''
The local Tory organisation built up by Dr Kennedy, and peaking with
his campaign at the last election, is now falling apart. A former
constituency chairman is endorsing McCartney, while one of their three
borough councillors last week resigned from the Conservative
Association, saying they were ''living in the clouds''.
Candidate Stuart Sexton is an Englishman living in London, who became
an adviser to Government ministers after a career in the petrochemical
industry and now runs a right-wing think tank. How much damage had been
done to his campaign by last week's handshake between Northern Ireland
Office Minister Michael Ancram and Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and
Martin McGuinness? ''A lot!'' he conceded.
In fact Sexton has come up with a novel approach to dealing with the
unpopularity of his party's policies and record on Northern Ireland. He
is standing against them -- rejecting the framework document, rejecting
the plan for an Assembly, indeed rejecting just about everything the
Government has done.
He said: ''There is tremendous scepticism about where we are going. My
argument is that we have to talk to everyone concerned but I don't have
to agree with or support the detail of these negotiations. There is no
mandate or acceptability in Northern Ireland for the Government and a
lot of back-benchers and a number of ministers agree with me.''
That paraphrases as: The Conservatives have got it all wrong -- Vote
for me, your Conservative candidate!
The message from UUP candidate Alan McFarland is that the party is
quietly using its influence behind the scenes and this has far more
chance of success than the outright rejection and megaphone diplomacy
offered by McCartney. But there is a jaded look about the party just
now, and the fact that they are promoting a 45-year-old man as the
candidate for youth smacks of desperation over their demographic
profile.
McFarland is pleasant, articulate, and bright but after 18 years in
the Army, including tours of his home territory, he has had only three
years as a parliamentary assistant to James Molyneaux and Martin Smyth
to hone his political skills. Never having stood for elected office
before makes it a big jump to contesting a Westminster by-election.
He has castigated the front-runner as intellectually arrogant for
assuming that there is some simple solution to the constitutional
problem which has evaded elected representatives for decades.
This led to his ill-advised jibe that McCartney huddled together with
a group of like-minded intellectuals and constitutional lawyers ''to
produce Ulster's final solution. This sort of talk was last heard in
Hitler's Germany.''
It was an outrageous smear, given McCartney's record on fighting
religious and sectarian bigotry, but evidence of how much he frightens
political rivals. He shot to prominence in 1981 when he seized the
microphone from Ian Paisley at a rally outside City Hall and berated the
DUP leader as a fascist.
Youngest of a large family, he was born on the Shankill in 1936 and
benefited from the 1944 Education Act, which propelled him via Grosvenor
High School and Queen's University to a career in the law, becoming one
of his country's top QCs. His lifestyle and a luxury home in Cultra on
the Gold Coast have not altered his left-wing views on social issues.
To middle-class professionals, he is therefore one of them, while to
those living in Kilcooley, a Scots-style public housing scheme on the
ring road round Bangor, or in the sprawls of Dundonald on the outskirts
of East Belfast, he is a Shankill boy who did well. Boundary changes are
to take the latter out of the constituency, making it even less
promising for the DUP, which is why they have chosen not to stand and
have endorsed McCartney instead.
McCartney has argued that unionism must jettison its triumphalist and
sectarian baggage and create a modern, civic society in Northern Ireland
which is inclusive and fair for everyone, regardless of religion. At
Westminster the Government must be harried, its secret negotiations with
Dublin dragged out into the open for scrutiny.
He has repeated these themes to UUP and DUP branches who have invited
him to speak in recent months and although he accused the latter of
behaving like ''Afrikaners under apartheid'' he was given a hearing.
Although he has a reputation for falling out with fellow politicians in
the past, he could yet emerge as a bridge between the two main Unionist
parties.
With typically pugnacious immodesty, he said: ''If I couldn't do more
on my own at Westminster than the team that is representing Ulster
Unionism at present I would feel that I had utterly failed. In the past
year I have given the people of Northern Ireland more real politics and
more to think about than any elected politician.''
'If I couldn't do more on my own at Westminster than the team that is
representing Ulster Unionism at present I would feel that I had utterly
failed'

Jack McLean offers a toast to his favourite institution, The Pub
THIS is national Pub Week; well it isn't quite, because Tennent
Caledonian, being a wee bit smart, jumped the gun? I found myself the
other day down in Glasgow's Horseshoe Bar; place was full of bar staff,
freeloaders, photographers, journos, and senior executives.
Let me tell you about the Horseshoe rather than inventions such as
National Pub Week. More than 30 years ago, I used to meet my father in
the Horseshoe, one of the most famous old pubs, and very much a man's
bar, in the West of Scotland. My late mother used to turn up outside and
wait for a respectable chap to come by and she would ask him if my
father was inside.
''He's got a trilby hat, a light-grey suit, a moustache, and he's
about five-foot four,'' she used to say. Three-quarters of the Horseshoe
clientele could be thus described. The point was that my mum wouldn't
ever have thought of going into a bar, or certainly one where the men
went. Things have changed a lot.
When Tennent Caledonian started up their Pub Week they forgot to
mention that just a little over 20 years ago they had a policy of not
serving ladies. In fact, Tennant's Bar -- not anything to do with
Tennents -- in Byres Road in Glasgow, had a visitation from the local
feminists from Queen Margaret Union of Glasgow University. In came the
brazen shaven, biler-suits at the ready.
To the feminists' chagrin, the girls were cheered to the rafters and
were bought drink by the boys who thoroughly approved of girls in pubs,
as well they might. A sad thing a lonely old bachelor is in a pub, and
feels all the better for the sight of a fine-looking girl in silks and
satins and sulks and sin -- here, that's enough.
National Pub Week is, of course, a dodge for the breweries who want to
make lots more profit. Heavens, they need it, for they are losing money
yearly. So are distilleries -- pubs as well. Everybody in the drink
business. The licensed trade is not doing well at all and this is
reflected in the appalling wages.
Tennents pay an average of #3.05 an hour to their barstaff. That's not
much. Pubs everywhere pay even less, and some let their workers go home
in the dark, late at night, no taxis, young women. I have at this moment
two young god-daughters and a niece working in pubs following their
departure from school and university. Thankfully the pubs concerned make
sure that their employees are driven home.
National Pub Week attracts a certain cynicism, and so it should, but .
. .
Here's the but and it is a big one. What would we do without this
marvellous institution, this corner of culture? The Pub. Look at any
culture anywhere and you will find a social solace. In Islamic countries
it is the coffee-houses. The poor Muslims are now inflamed with Irn-Bru
and what they are needing is a wee dram to get things in perspective.
How about Ireland where the women and the Pioneers seek their delight
in tea and teetotalism? The result is early pregnancies and abortions
for the wee colleens, bitterness for the married women, and hapless
priests. Oh, aye, and 25 years and more of conflict. The happiest places
in Ireland, and thank God they are not cathedrals, are pubs and more
power to them. They are happy places because of the people and the drink
poured over a counter.
More and more people are going to their houses with cans of fizzy beer
and the odd half-bottle of voddie -- why I know not. It is certainly
cheaper to drink at home but not as much fun, in fact no fun at all.
Drink in the house? That's the Lost Weekend. What it isn't is a night
out. What it isn't is socialising.
National Pub Week is making a great deal of going down the pub but,
frankly, it isn't expressing the reality of it, perhaps because most of
the people in the licensed trade, at the accountancy end of it, don't
actually know what pubs are all about.
I spent six years in the licensed trade, on the business side of the
counter, and am still, amazingly, regarded as a good worker and even do
the odd shift to help pals in the trade. I have spent more than 30 years
as an even better worker on the other side of the bar.
For if brewers and the like put on a show the pubs don't have to.
The Heraghty's and Elcho's and Castle Bars of the South-side of
Glasgow; the Stars and Garters of Dundee, the Dean Taverns of Lothian,
the Camphill Vaults of Lanarkshire where John presided until but
recently before he died. The . . . let us go back to John.
He ran a pub and also a splendid Burns Supper, during the day,
actually. Geordie Young always turned up, him of Rangers and Scotland,
and Joe Baker of Hibs and England. Pubs do that. Turn up. I have myself,
all these years. It is not a matter of turning up. It is putting in an
appearance. It counts.

Meanwhile, tenants of a second Scottish new town have decided they
want their district council to take control of their homes, write Alan
Hunter and Lynne Robertson -- effectively delivering a blow to Scottish
Office plans to divert ownership to housing associations, at the expense
of the local authorities.
Glenrothes Development Corporation tenants were first to decide after
a ballot in April that Kirkcaldy District Council should become their
preferred landlord, with an 80% response in favour.
Yesterday, it was revealed that East Kilbride tenants have decided by
an even higher majority -- 99.3% -- to choose their district council.
The East Kilbride corporation will wind up at the end of December this
year and almost 7000 tenants were given the opportunity to vote for
their preferred landlord in future.
Leader of the council, Mr Colin Robb, said he was delighted with the
result of the vote.
He said it represented a massive vote of confidence, with the public
recognising that the council was capable of providing a high-quality
housing service to its tenants.

John Linklater looks at what lies ahead for William Windsor during his
schooldays at Eton
PRINCE WILLIAM is a first. No previous heir to the throne, or second
heir as in his case, has attended Eton College in its 555-year history.
There might be two reasons. Future monarchs have not generally received
educations, having governesses and private tutors drop round to the
palace instead. Once the progressive idea of schooling royals caught on,
when Prince Charles got packed off to get taunted about his big ears, it
was a case of the more remote the better.
Gordonstoun, in its own Morayshire estate, with ample cliff faces on
which to conceal boarders on the end of ropes, was less of a security
risk, but it scared the life out of Charles. It had a reputation for
building character, if you wanted a character like Prince Philip, but we
have learned from Jonathan Dimbleby's biography that Charles was not his
father's boy. He grew up emotionally scarred, unable to form close
friendships, and with an alleged ambition to ''come back as a tampon''.
No obstacles to kingship in the next century, perhaps, but a ''could do
better'' as the final report on Gordonstoun, in the view of both of
Prince William's parents at least.
The education of their two sons is said to be one of the few subjects
they are both prepared still to discuss with each other. Two other
boarding schools, Bradfield and Bedales, were considered at one stage,
but Eton College finally won the vote as the handier option. It is in
the Berkshire catchment area of Windsor Palace.
The school has come a long way since its foundation in 1440 by Henry
VI to educate the sons of the poor and prepare them for the service of
church and State. The fees have gone up to #12,384. At the last count
there were 20 British Prime Ministers who received their educations
there, though not all at the same time. The most recent was Harold
Macmillan, and the present Cabinet has a couple of Old Etonians in
Douglas Hurd and William Waldegrave, counterweighted by their
contemporaries, Labour MPs Tam Dalyell and Mark Fisher.
Prince William's parents were probably more impressed by the fact that
several of his own chums are going to Eton this September; boys like
Thomas van Straubenzee and Simon Heathcoat-Amory from the same feeder
prep school.
Alongside them plain William Windsor, as he will be addressed, should
not feel overexposed. ''Eton boys set little store by the odd duke,''
said Tim Card, vice-provost, and author of the recent book, Eton
Renewed, which emphasised the move towards a more meritocratic set-up at
the school under its previous headmasters, Michael McCrum and a Scot, Dr
Eric Anderson.
Bursary boys and scholarship winners have contributed to a steady
raising of academic standards at Eton. It scored second to Westminster
in last year's Top Schools indexes based on A-level results, with 84% of
boys gaining university entrance A and B passes. They have to be good.
Oxbridge colleges have a reputation for being tough on applications from
the school. There are jobs and walks of life where it pays to underplay
the Eton connection.
While Eton seeks to shed its ''toff'' image of schooling upper-class
twits -- it has abolished birchings and the iniquitous system of fagging
-- it still cannot dissuade the aristocracy entirely. There are three
young lords (Irwin, Hervey and William's cousin Lord Frederick Windsor,
son of Prince Michael of Kent) in the present roll of 1270. The school
is by no means averse to princes, until now restricted to foreign ones,
and it usually finds raffish nicknames for them. King Birendra of Nepal
used to be known as Nipples, for no reason that anyone is prepared to
discuss.
Like most institutions, it is going through a transitional phase.
Prince William will emerge computer literate, and he will have a
curricular choice that extends in languages to Chinese, Arabic, and
Japanese, but he will spend the rest of his life with an arcane
vocabulary comprehensible only to other OEs.
It will revolve around ''beaks'' teaching the ''tits'' their ''divs'',
and whether a chap is a ''dry-bob'' or a ''wet-bob'' (which relates to
the momentous decision in the life of a young man as to whether he will
play cricket or row). He will be introduced to a time-locked battery of
bizarre rituals from the annual June 4 celebration of his distant
ancestor George III's birthday by sailing down the Thames and tossing
flowers out of boaters to the mud-wrestling attempt to score the first
goal in the Eton Wall Game since 1907. He could make a name for himself.
Will the experience prepare him for whatever employment the monarchy
may still command in the twenty-first century? In his pre-pubescent
years Prince William is reported as having displayed an interest in
photographs of Playboy models and a penchant for flushing his mother's
shoes down the toilet. He has inherited his mother's tendency to sink
his jaw into his chest and affect camera-shyness.
Eton can cure this as surely as even its detractors have never denied
that a breeding of confidence is one of the school's most conspicuous
products. He will never be stuck for a network of contacts. And he will
enjoy that luxury known to every Etonian, that of ''halves'', as the
term is called, there are always three.

THEY abolished the death penalty in South Africa. This was good news
for more than 300 prisoners holed out in condemned cells, not such a
popular move in the eyes of a public already obsessed by the alarming
increase in violent crime. But it was right, and a brave, unanimous,
decision by 11 judges in the Constitutional Court.
Their reasons were published in full and gave the clearest possible
indication of what the newly democratised country is attempting to
become . . . a more civilised nation.
One by one the judges gave their verdicts. Judge Laurie Ackerman said
there was an individual right not to be put to death by the state,
adding that there was also an obligation on the state to protect society
from being harmed more than once by an unreformed killer or rapist.
''The best deterrent to murder is not a fear of the gallows but the
knowledge that one is likely to be caught and to spend much of one's
life in captivity.''
One of his colleagues, Judge John Didcott, quoted figures which showed
the murder rate did not rise significantly after the abolition of the
death penalty in countries all over the world. ''The state should never
match the callousness of the criminal. Instead it should set an example
of evolving civilisation.''
In South Africa, where authoritarianism held sway for generations,
where the rod was rarely spared, these are extraordinary conclusions.
They also give some indication of how quickly attitudes are changing.
Judge Pius Langa recalled that his country's political history had led
to life and human dignity being demeaned. ''We must in future rely on
moral persuasion rather than force.''
And perhaps the most ringing rejection of state killing came from
Judge Ismael Mahomed. He declared that the ultimate sentence represented
''a philosophy of indefensible despair'' and that, when someone is
executed, ''the dignity of us all, in a caring society, must be
compromised by repeating, systematically and deliberately, what we find
so repugnant in the conduct of the offender.''
He added: ''The rape of an offender is not considered to be a
permissible punishment for a rapist. Why then should murder be an
acceptable punishment for murder?'' Two of the judges were women.
As their judgements were being announced last week, it happened that I
was being shown around a prison near Johannesburg. It houses 4000
inmates, some 20 of whom had been convicted of killing, and more than
200 are being held on attempted murder convictions.
As we toured the prison farm, and the adjacent golf course where some
of the inmates are permitted to act as caddies -- ''they are inclined to
give you a very good lie in the rough,'' a member admitted -- I found
predictably mixed opinions among the staff on the question of capital
punishment. ''Hanging is too good for some of the evil men we have
here,'' an officer told me, but another admitted he was relieved at the
news.
''Until you have worked at a jail you can have no idea of what an
effect an execution can have on everyone -- inmates, staff, relatives. I
have known officers who faked illness just to miss it.''
In this institution the regime seemed to be liberal, the prisoners,
90% of whom were black, chatted away happily. Their dormitories were
clean and the food they received appeared adequate.
Just when I was feeling relaxed about the visit, the Scottish rugby
team's baggage man brought me swiftly back to earth. Saieed Abraham
Lincoln, a young man of Malaysian descent, startled me with the
information that he had served six months in jail. ''I was part of the
struggle,'' he said, with quiet pride.
What did you do? ''I blew up a power station. They never actually got
a conviction against me because by the time my case came up for trial
all the evidence had mysteriously disappeared -- Mandela had been
released by then.
''While I was held for interrogation it was pretty nasty all the same.
They shut my head in the drawer of a filing cabinet.''
Of course many of the policemen and warders who committed such acts
are still on the force. Indeed the couple whose job it was to guard us
were certainly around in the apartheid days. ''We know we did things
that were not civilised,'' one told me, ''but we thought we were
fighting a war. Everyone has to make a fresh start.''
On that the future of South Africa depends. After a month there I have
come home with revised ideas, still an optimist but much more aware of
the problems which lie ahead for the republic.
Sure the weather is wonderful; Pretoria, they claim, has the finest
climate in the world and I would not argue.
This is a country rich in raw materials, with excellent road
structures and a willing workforce. Their friendliness including, it
should be said, the vast majority of Afrikaans-speaking people was often
touchingly sincere.
I went, with three rugby players and the team doctor, to a Pretoria
primary school, where 450 children, each of them crisply turned out in
uniform, displayed the kind of discipline and good manners that are rare
in our equivalent establishments. ''Parents,'' the head teacher assured
us,'' are very much involved in the learning system.''
All of which is grand. Less rosy is the flood of immmigrants from all
over Africa, the rising unemployment, the lack of decisiveness, or even
cohesion, of the Government of National Unity.
I wish South Africa well . . . but I am glad to be home. What's
happening here? Lady Thatcher is being rude to Major, another Tory
minister is in trouble -- sometimes you feel you have never been away.

<HEADLINE>Waiting-list policy targets mortgage arrears. Council to bar house debtors</HEADLINE>

A COUNCIL was attacked yesterday over its plans to expand a
housing-vetting policy to include a ban on applicants with mortgage
arrears.
The Federation of Tenants and Residents Associations said it could not
begin to understand the thinking behind Kirkcaldy District Council's
proposed extension to the ''totally unfair and mean-minded policy''
which it had consistently opposed. It has called a special executive
meeting to discuss how to overturn it.
The attack coincided with the publication of a Shelter survey which
showed that the number of families being evicted from their homes by
mortgage lenders may be about to rise.
The federation said the Kirkcaldy plan would deliver a potential
''double whammy'' to home owners in the district who became unemployed,
because they were set to lose Income Support on their mortgage interest
as a result of changes in Government policy.
The vetting policy, known as Schedule One, was introduced last year to
screen housing applicants for anti-social behaviour. Applicants who
failed had their application suspended for up to 10 years.
However, what angered the federation was the inclusion in Schedule One
of rent arrears and other debts to a landlord, which can lead to a
five-year suspension from the lists. Despite a storm of protest, the
council, which has 18,500 houses, has persisted with the policy.
Now it has emerged that, following a review of the policy, it is being
proposed that people with mortgage arrears should face a similar
five-year suspension from the housing lists.
A federation spokeman said: ''We are completely astounded by the
council's insistence on continuing with this harsh and unfair policy. As
for the inclusion of mortgage arrears, we can't begin to understand the
thinking behind that.
''The council is always banging on about the Government but it is
persecuting victims of Government policy who will be stuck between a
rock and a hard place.
''The real tragedy is that the council is one of the more progressive
ones in Scotland yet it is doing real damage to its reputation as a
landlord by carrying on with this mean-minded policy.''
Last night, a council spokesman said a decision on adding people with
mortgage arrears to the policy would be taken on June 27. The idea, he
said, was to put them on an equal footing with those with rent arrears.
He said every case would be treated on its merits and it was not
automatic that people with mortgage arrears would be banned from the
housing list.
Being banned from the housing list for mortgage arrears did not mean
people would not be housed if they became homeless. ''Being picked up
under the council's homelessness policy would override the allocations
policy,'' he said.
* Shelter has announced that 45,804 homes were repossessed in the UK
in the year to the end of March, according to data compiled for its Roof
Briefing, a bi-monthly digest of housing market intelligence.
This was 6% lower than the 12 months ending March 1994. However, it
compared with a 20% fall the previous year, a dramatic slowdown in the
rate of decline in repossessions, pointing to a bottoming out of the
downward trend seen since the beginning of economic recovery in 1992,
said Roof Briefing editor Tim Dwelly.

WE have been checking through a new book of Scottish sayings old and
new to establish who are the great thinkers of our nation.
Quotable Scots (Mainstream #8.99) reveals that, in a purely quantative
sense, the voice of Scotland is not Robert Burns, the poet, but Joan
Burnie, the journalist and general scourge of things male. Burnie is
quoted 18 times in the tome compared to 17 mentions for the Bard. Sir
Walter Scott rates a 16.
Ms Burnie is surpassed by only two Scots icons -- Sean Connery and
Thomas Carlyle with 20 apiece. Our favourite quote from the book (mind
you, we've only got to the first page) is from Mel Gibson about his
William Wallace movie: ''It's going to be a happy movie -- though he
still gets hung, drawn, and quartered.''
Saints alive
THE scene is a Glasgow schools football tournament where one of the
participating teams is Stonedyke primary from Drumchapel. The compiler
of the scoreboard containing the names of the teams is obviously
suffering from a touch of Timite word blindness. There, among St
Augustine, Our Lady of the Annunciation, et al, is to be found the
school named after that well-known Drumchapel religious figure -- St
Onedyke.
* MORE saints. Aer Lingus call all their planes after saints. Even the
disembodied cockpits to be found in their simulator training facility at
Dublin airport -- all of which bear the name St Thetic.
No mean feet
WE have in front of us a leaflet with the words ''John Smith Walk,
Loch Katrine, 24th June, 1995''. We know that the Labour leader is
buried on holy ground on Iona and his loss is still felt so greatly
that, if he had been a Tim, beatification would be on the cards. But
walking on water?
It transpires that this fund-raising memorial walk is actually around
the shores of the loch. Participants are shipped from the Trossachs Pier
at 11am up the loch to Stronachlachar and then walk the 13 miles back
through some rather nice scenery.
It costs #5 to take part with half of the proceeds going to the
British Heart Foundation and the other half towards refurbishing the
party's Keir Hardie House HQ and creating therein the John Smith
Boardroom.
French follies
HAUD on to your berets, it's the Auld Alliance competition again. In
which we are offering wonderful prizes, as garnered by French consul M.
Jean-Claude Richard, in return for your stories and memories to
celebrate the 700th anniversary of the special relationship between
France and Scotland.
We seem to have digressed from the great cultural and historical
aspects of the Alliance to more practical matters. Jock Davidson of St
Monans, Fife, writes to tell us of a case in the Parisian equivalent of
a Scottish police court.
In the dock was none other than Harry McElhone, a Dundonian who went
to fame as founder and patron of Harry's New York Bar at 5 Rue Danou in
Paris (as used by Hemingway and many other celebs).
Harry, being a Dundonian, ended up on a minor charge and found himself
on the receiving end of a hard time from the prosecution lawyer who was
ranting on about this foreigner who had no respect for the laws of
France. Oor Harry, defending himself, pointed out that under the Auld
Alliance, the French King Louis XII had in 1513 issued the decree of the
Lettres de Naturalite which bestowed on Scotsmen the same rights as
Frenchmen under the law. Case dismissed.
But back to our favourite subject of the dangers of a little knowledge
of French or English as a foreign language. Norman Brown recalls a
French-Scottish summer school in Ayrshire when a geography teacher chum
of his had been drafted in to help control the jeunesse.
His eagle-eye spotted that a boy and a girl in the back seat of the
bus were enaged in osculatory activity in a rather too obvious attempt
to promote the Auld Alliance. Being rather proud of his command of
French, he thundered: ''Defense de baiser dans l'autobus.''
This produced hysterical laughter from all the French boys and girls
on the bus. The teacher was not to know that the verb baiser, since he
learnt it, had moved on and as well as meaning to kiss had assumed a
much coarser meaning, a word starting with the letter F and involving
asterisks.
The Auld Alliance debate continues and the prizes, in case you have
forgotten, are two Air France tickets to Paris, a visit to a North Sea
oil rig courtesy of Elf, a magnum of Bollinger champagne, and dinner for
two at Le Chardon in Edinburgh.
Contributions to the Diary at the Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow
G1 1QP. Et bonne chance, par le chemin.
To crown it all
OUR man at various wine tastings has sobered up sufficiently to tell
us a tale South Africa. It involves the Thelema Estate winery in
Stellenbosch which is run by husband-and-wife team Gyles and Barbara
Webb.
They produced a Sauvignon blanc in 1994 which was something of a
success and sold out very quickly. Earlier this year, there was a phone
call to the winery from a chap with a very pukka English accent
demanding to purchase three cases of the wine.
Sorry, said Mrs Webb, there was none left. Put me on to someone in
authority, said the voice, ie to a male person. Mrs Webb did not hang up
but put her husband on the line and he repeated that there was none of
the vintage left for sale.
The man became quite insistent whereupon Mr Bell lost his temper and
admitted that while he still had 10 cases in his cellar they were for
personal use and he wouldn't sell them ''even to the Queen of F******
England''. Funny you should mention that, the chap said, I'm phoning on
behalf of Her Majesty who is currently visiting South Africa.
The wine was duly delivered to the royal yacht Britannia.

JON Bon Jovi, one of America's biggest rock stars, sang a love song on
the window ledge of Glasgow's Tower Records store yesterday and brought
the city centre to a standstill, writes Alison Daniels.
The one-off Scottish gig brought around 6000 people to Argyle Street,
with some scaling traffic lights for a better view of the band, Bon
Jovi, as they played a five-song acoustic set.
The band's flying visit was sandwiched between a European tour and the
start of the band's sell-out English tour. Dedicated fans, who had
queued for two hours ouside the store, were rewarded with smiles and
handshakes as the stars, surrounded by minders, dashed from their maroon
limousines to the impromptu stage on the store's first floor.
Before shedding his leather jacket and strumming a few old favourites
on his guitar, Jon played it coy about a possible last-minute Glasgow
date. He revealed he was ''really pleased'' to be in Glasgow, before
saying fans would just have to wait and see. However, a roadie solved
the mystery: ''Nah, we're in Lisbon tonight, man.''

WORRIED Strathclyde councillors have agreed to spend #5m on urgent
maintenance of the region's rapidly deteriorating stock of school
buildings, in the grim knowledge that they really need to spend #60m
more than that.
The #60m shortfall came to light as the education committee endorsed a
#43m capital spending programme against a background of continuing
Scottish Office cuts.
In terms of Scottish Office allocation, Strathclyde has received
#26.5m, which is #850,000 down on last year.
However, the council itself had ploughed in additional resources from
property disposals, in order that a reasonable capital programme of new
building, equipment purchasing, and adequate maintenance of buildings
could be worked up.
Depute director of education John Mulgrew said: ''This produces a
capital programme of #43m. Of this, #4.7m is earmarked for property
maintenance to protect the fabric of school buildings.''
He added: ''We're spending nearly #5m in maintenance but we should be
spending another #60m on major problems like leaking roofs and rotting
window frames. These buildings are safe but the maintenance has slipped
over the years because of gross Government underfunding.''
To add to the anguish, education committee members learned yesterday
that the 12 unitary authorities that will replace Strathclyde region
next April will have a veto over capital contracts worth more than #2.5m
and revenue contracts (purchase of supplies) of more than #250,000.
The Secretary of State has suggested this should apply from August 1
but councils are making strenuous representations to have a later
cut-off date, arguing that the device would create chaos and delay.
Liberal Democrat leader Dr Christopher Mason said: ''This is a very
serious point. All it needs is for one renegade authority to throw a
spoke in the wheel and they can stop everything by refusing to give
approval for a contract, say, for the bulk purchase of toilet rolls.''

THE Duke of Northumberland has been instructed to return two
fireplaces and marble chimney pieces removed from a listed building in
Fochabers.
The fireplaces, each valued at #100,000, were installed at Kirkville
in South Street, a building dating from 1800.
Northumberland Estates applied for retrospective planning permission
to remove them in 1991 but was turned down by Moray District Council.
The duke appealed to the Scottish Secretary, seeking approval for
their removal to his ancestral seat, Alnwick Castle, and lifting of an
enforcement notice requiring him to reinstate the marble pieces.
His lawyers argued that the fireplaces were part of the original
features of Northumberland House in London's Strand when it was restored
by Robert Adam. It was demolished to make way for Charing Cross station
and they were moved to other houses, before finally ending up in
Fochabers.
Rejecting both appeals, Scottish Office Inquiry Reporter, Mr Richard
Jessop, said the fireplaces contributed greatly to the qualities of
Kirkville when it was listed as a category B building in 1971. Their
replacements were of markedly inferior quality.
Neither the duke nor his estates manager was available for comment
last night. Their only recourse now is to appeal against the Reporter's
decision at the Court of Session.

JOHANNESBURG: Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who arrived in South
Africa yesterday, said the black struggle against apartheid bore
similarities to the IRA's fight against British rule in Northern
Ireland. He hoped to learn from South Africa's peaceful transition to
democracy, he told reporters at Johannesburg airport.
Mr Adams, who will meet President Nelson Mandela during his eight-day
tour, said negotiated peace was more important than the IRA surrendering
its weapons.

AN alcoholic paedophile priest was jailed for seven years yesterday
for sexually abusing young boys at an isolated cottage where he plied
them with drink.
Father Danny Curran, 45, sat with his eyes closed and head bowed at
Belfast Crown Court as a judge told him that he had abused his trust and
betrayed his clerical colleagues.
Curran admitted 13 separate charges, nine of them indecent assaults
against boys, one as young as nine.
At the time, he was a priest in the St Paul's parish of West Belfast
and took the boys to his cottage near Tyrella Beach, Downpatrick, County
Down, where he abused them after heavy drinking sessions.
The court heard today that he was eventually questioned after a boy
fled from the house following a drunken and violent attack by Curran.
The child had been hit on the head with a vodka bottle, bitten on the
finger, kicked, and then drenched with water by the priest.
The boy ran to a neighbouring house, shaking violently and crying
hysterically: ''Please do not let him touch me. Please do not let him
get me.''
Curran's orgy of abuse, the court heard, lasted from January 1990 to
March 1994, when young boys were taken to his cottage to get away from
the violence of West Belfast.
He allowed them to drink large quantities of beer and cider while he
consumed vodka and later as they slept in bed Curran got in beside them.
One of the victims told police: ''I never told anyone about it because
I thought it would be a sin if I did.''
Another child said: ''I was too ashamed. I felt confused.''
Curran, of Bryansford Avenue, Newcastle, County Down, has spent the
last 14 months undergoing treatment in a psycho-sexual unit run by the
Roman Catholic church at Stroud in Gloucestershire.
Judge Tony Hart said Curran had abused his position of trust and
betrayed the trust of parents as well as his clerical colleagues and
those in the wider community.
He had actively encouraged the boys to drink considerable quantities.
The judge added: ''The offences were not rare or isolated. They were
carried out in a deliberate, calculated fashion.''
Curran's cottage was primitive and isolated and the court heard the
drinking sessions would continue following meals which he cooked and
after he told them stories and played cards.
Police were called in March last year when three boys ran terrified
from the cottage. One was shaking violently and bleeding.
After the hearing, Monsignor Colm McCaughan, chancellor of Down and
Connor diocese, said the church would do everything to help police
investigations into sex abuse.
''There are feelings of shock, hurt, and anger among the people and
some of the priests are now afraid to have any involvement with children
because of what happened.
''I guarantee that, with any investigation, there will be no cover-up
and we will give any help or assistance to the RUC, social services or
anyone else.''
The Bishop of Down and Connor, Dr Patrick Walsh, said he deeply
regretted the distress caused to the young victims and their families.
''The entire community of the church suffers whenever trust is
betrayed by any person ministering in her name. Father Curran has not
been engaged in any pastoral ministry since these offences came to
notice.''
Irish Roman Catholic church leader Cardinal Cahal Daly yesterday spoke
of his ''enormous distress'' over the case.
''I am horrified at the reports of this situation,'' the Cardinal
declared.
''I think of the poor children who were abused and the trauma they
have suffered. I am concerned about their families. I am concerned about
the public who are scandalised by this.
''I am deeply, deeply pained and distressed by the whole issue.''
Dr Daly interrupted a meeting of the Irish Catholic hierarchy to make
his comments about the case, as well as reports that he met senior Royal
Ulster Constabulary detectives to discuss their inquiries into
allegations of widespread sexual and physical abuse in Roman Catholic
children's homes.
He said: ''I wish you would believe how much pain and distress all
this is causing to us.''
Asked how many more cases of sex abuse involving Roman Catholic clergy
might emerge, the Cardinal replied: ''I have no idea. But it should be
remembered that we are now dealing with cases that are going back 20
years and there could be a sizeable number of people.''
He said that, tragically, there were people in what he would call the
clerical community who had been guilty of child sex abuse.
''It is enormously, enormously distressing. But, sadly you have a
proportion of people -- a small proportion -- in almost every
professional body or any kind of community who have this tendency and
yield to it.
''But the proportion among the community of priests is certainly not
higher than among comparable groups,'' he said.
A small number of individual priests had been named and were
co-operating with the RUC, and any allegations that were known to the
bishops were discussed directly with the relevant civil authorities.
Cardinal Daly stressed: ''There is no cover up, no safe havens, there
is no shelter. We are as concerned at this matter as anybody.''
He added that the question of compensation for the victims of child
sex abuse by priests was ''entirely a matter for the courts''.
However, the cardinal said he was astonished at reports that he had
discussed specific charges with the RUC.
His meeting with senior officers had been for discussions of a general
nature. ''My discussions had nothing whatsoever to do with individual
allegations,'' he added.

A BOEING 767 flying from Palma to Glasgow was involved in an alleged
near-miss at 39,000ft with a Boeing 747 yesterday.
The planes were flying at 39,000ft, five miles west of Cheltenham,
Gloucestershire, when the incident happened.
People living directly below heard a loud roar of plane engines at
about the time of the alleged near miss.
The Civil Aviation Authority said the Boeing 747 was travelling from
Montreal to Paris.
''Both aircraft were receiving a radar control service from the London
area and Terminal Control Centre,'' said a spokesman: ''The aircraft
passed at a height of 39,000ft.
''These details are subject to confirmation and will be fully
investigated by the independent Joint Airmiss Working Group.''
Reports have to be filed to the group whenever it is alleged that two
public transport planes come within 10 miles of each other. An average
of 60 such incidents are reported each year but around 80% are found to
involve no risk.

AN investigation was under way last night after three workmen died
under a hail of concrete blocks when a 15ft high wall collapsed on top
of them.
They died instantly after the rubble engulfed a wooden platform on
which they were standing at the site of Dundee University's new #6.5m
halls of residence in the city's Perth Road.
Another man who was on the platform escaped with only slight injuries.
A worker who went to the men's aid received hospital treatment for a
foot injury.
The men who died were all from Dundee. They were named as
father-of-three Derek Kenneth, 40, of Fintry Drive; Mr Michael Shirkey,
49, of Happyhillock Road, and Mr Christopher Tawse, 51, of Whitfield
Rise. The two injured men were not named.
Construction of the halls of residence was running several weeks
behind schedule but the contractors denied there was any pressure on the
operations being carried out at the time of the accident.
The tragedy happened around 9am yesterday as the men were working on
the 25ft-high platform on top of the completed third floor of a
four-storey building.
Mr Raymond Murray, 27, a worker on the site, said: ''The guys were
working next to the wall when it came down. They had no chance.''
Mr Brian Rodger, bricklaying foreman for Muir Construction Limited,
the main contractors at the site, was close to tears as he described the
wall collapse.
''It was just carnage,'' he said. ''I heard the boys screaming and I
phoned for the ambulance.''
Tayside Fire Brigade divisional officer Jack Hutcheon said: ''It was a
hazardous operation. My men had to get on scaffolding that had already
collapsed and was showing signs of failure due to damage.''
The site was sealed off and health and safety officials, building
control officers, and the police sifted through the rubble for clues to
what had happened.
Mr Alan Muir, managing director of the Inverkeithing-based
contractors, said his company was shocked and dismayed by the deaths of
the three men.
Asked if there was any pressure on the company and the employees to
get the job done more quickly, he said: ''Not on the immediate
operations that were being carried out at the time of the accident.''
Mr Muir added: ''We are totally shocked by today's events. Our most
sincere and deepest sympathies go out to the bereaved families.''
''We will be working closely with the health and safety executive to
find out how this tragedy could have occured. At this stage, however,
until we have the facts I cannot speculate as to the cause of the
accident.''
Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch told the Scottish Grand
Committee at Westminster yesterday that the Health and Safety Executive
would ''move as fast as possible to investigate the circumstances''.

BETWEEN 20 and 30 transatlantic flights were delayed for up to an hour
yesterday when the Civil Aviation Authority's main Scottish air traffic
control computer system at Prestwick suffered what was believed to be a
software fault.
A spokeswoman for the CAA confirmed that Oceanic, the CAA's national
air traffic service based at Prestwick Airport, suffered a computer
problem around midday. The CAA imposed flight traffic restrictions for
four hours, but it took almost 11 hours for the computer fault to be
rectified.
The restrictions cutting air traffic were ''in order to keep the
system safe'', she said.
As a result, about two dozen aircraft suffered delays of about an hour
at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, and some incoming flights were forced
to hold for a short while over Land's End before getting clearance.
The spokeswoman added that the flight restrictions may have had some
effect upon domestic traffic over Scotland, but that the CAA had had no
reports of any serious hold-ups.
''There was absolutely no danger. As soon as the computer went down we
put in place the flow control so that there were fewer aircraft coming
in, to keep the system safe,'' she said.
An investigation will be held into the cause of the problem.

THE Highlands is set for a major jobs bonanza when an international
bio-medical company builds a multi-million pound research and
manufacturing base in Inverness.
Highland Regional Council's planning committee yesterday narrowly
approved the #9.6m development application.
However, the name of the company is being kept secret and the
cloak-and-dagger tactics are causing growing frustration.
The biggest hi-tech manufacturing deal yet in the North of Scotland
will produce self-diagnosing equipment, including kits for pregnancy
testing, screening for lead poisoning in children, ECG electrodes for
heart monitoring, and oxygen testing for patients in intensive care.
It will create around 375 jobs over five years, as well as substantial
spin-off employment.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which needed special Scottish Office
permission to provide financial backing for the development above its
normal threshold, lodged the planning application on behalf of the
company.
HIE said it couldn't reveal the company's identity because of fears
that competitors could sabotage the plan.

Cape Town, Wednesday
A SOUTH AFRICAN suspected of being a serial killer dubbed the
''station strangler'' was jailed for 25 years today for murdering a
10-year-old boy.
''It is difficult for me in any way to find sympathy for a child
murderer,'' Judge Wally van Deventer said in the Cape Town Supreme Court
when he sentenced Norman Afzal Simons, 27.
''Think of the pain and anxiety the child must have felt when he
realised he was a prisoner of someone who would probably kill him,'' the
judge added.
Simons was found guilty of murdering Elroy van Rooyen in March last
year.
Police suspect that Simons might be the Station Strangler, South
Africa's worst serial murderer, who is believed to have killed 21 boys
and a young man, all of mixed-race, over an eight-year period.
The Station Strangler is believed to have lured many of his victims
away from railway stations. Most were found buried in shallow graves in
the Cape Town area and had been sodomised and strangled.
Simons told police that his brother, murdered in 1991, had sodomised
him. He then began hearing voices from his brother ordering him to
kill.--Reuter.

A CONSULTANT whose son was turned down by the University of Glasgow's
medical school, despite the fact he had six Higher band A passes, lodged
a petition with the Court of Session in Edinburgh yesterday, calling for
a judicial review of the decision.
Speaking from his home in the city suburbs, Mr Brian O'Reilly said his
lawyer expected the review to take a couple of weeks. The university is
to contest the case.
Mr O'Reilly claimed his son, Conor, 17, a pupil at Glasgow's St
Aloysius College, was turned down earlier this year after a five-minute
interview with two university staff.
Conor has turned down offers from Scotland's four other medical
schools.
Mr O'Reilly said he was confident of winning the review, saying it was
ridiculous that his son's future had been decided on the basis of a
brief interview. He claimed his son had been turned down for the medical
school because he did not have any practical experience.
''The bottom line is that you've got a school system which encourages
children to work hard and a university system that ignores that and
replaces it with an interview.''
He said he had had no further contact with the university after
informing its principal, Sir William Kerr Fraser, about the possibility
of him taking legal action.
A university spokesman said that, if an individual decided to use the
courts to force universities to accept them, they had to expect the
universities to contest the case.

SCOTRAIL is to ask the British Railways Board at a meeting in London
tomorrow to look at all possible options for the Fort William sleeper,
including continuing to run it on a permanent basis, Mr John Ellis, the
director of ScotRail, said on a visit to Fort William yesterday.
At the same time, however, Highland region councillors warned they
would take further legal action against ScotRail if tomorrow's board
meeting does not reinstate a normal booking service for the sleeper
after June 30.
It also emerged yesterday that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has written
to British Rail expressing his annoyance over the board's handling of
the sleeper affair.
He was said by sources yesterday to be ''fighting Scotland's corner''
and to be angry over the way British Rail had chosen to interpret the
recent Court of Session ruling, that it must continue to run until full
public consultation has been carried out over ScotRail plans to close
it.
ScotRail has said that no bookings would be taken for the sleeper
beyond the end of this month.
Councillor Duncan McPherson, convener of Highland Regional Council,
said the council was awaiting the outcome of the British Railways Board
meeting but was ready ''to take immediate appropriate action to ensure a
normal service is maintained throughout the summer''.
He added that the council had received its legal counsel's opinion on
ScotRail's refusal to take sleeper bookings after June 30.
Mr Ellis was asked yesterday if he would simply be pushing the British
Railways Board to decide whether to appeal to the House of Lords over
the sleeper's reprieve, or whether he would also be pressing for support
to run the service in perpetuity.
He replied: ''We shall be looking at all the options. I have no desire
to close the service, if I can have it operating successfully. But I
cannot continue to operate a service that is known to be loss-making,
for which I have got no financial support.''
Asked if he would be looking to the board to go to the Government for
such financial support, he said: ''I can't say where we would be looking
for financial support but we clearly have a situation here with a
service losing a lot of money but is claimed to be of considerable
social and economic benefit to the West Highlands.
''We want to be looking to see if we can continue to deliver that
benefit to the West Highlands. I shall look at every possible way to
achieve that.''
Mr Ellis said he wanted the board to take firm decisions on whether it
would push to continue the sleeper service, whether to appeal to the
House of Lords, or whether to begin the consultation procedure for
withdrawal of the service.
''We recognise how unsatisfactory the present uncertainty is, not just
for ScotRail, but more importantly for our customers in the local
communities. We want to resolve that uncertainty so people know what is
going to be happening about the sleeper service,'' Mr Ellis said.
Mr Ellis was in Fort William as part of a ScotRail exercise to have
senior managers meet the travelling public.
Meanwhile, Mr Lang was involved in angry exchanges on the matter
yesterday in the Scottish Grand Committee, where he was accused by
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, of treachery.
Sir Russell Johnston, Liberal Democrat MP for Inverness, Nairn, and
Lochaber, demanded: ''Is the Minister aware that, if the British Rail
Board this Friday decides to appeal the decision on the Fort William
sleepers to the House of Lords, that appeal could not be heard before
October under the expedited (quick) procedure, and not before next year
under normal procedure.
''Given that delay, will the Government instruct BR to get on with
running the service properly, to take bookings in the proper way, and to
run the railway instead of running it down?''
Mr Lang, giving no hint of his personal involvement, told him: ''You
make an interesting and cogent point. I am sure it will be noted
carefully by British Rail and by others.''
Mr McLeish asked the Secretary of State to accept that he had done
nothing to save Motorail, the sleeper services to Fort William, or
seated accommodation. ''Should you not come clean and own up?'' he said.
''We are used to betrayal but this is simple treachery. The Secretary
of State has done nothing and services have been axed. The Scottish
tourist industry and the travelling public will be much worse off.''
Mr Lang retorted that the question was ''shabby and wrong in every
respect''. He went on: ''Rail services in Scotland, as elsewhere in the
United Kingdom, have suffered from nationalised ownership. What is
needed most to improve rail services in this country is privatisation.
We shall then see a real improvement in rail services.''
The Scottish Secretary sought to put some balance on his remarks by
stating that only 7% of journeys to the Highlands for tourism were made
by train. A small proportion of those journeys were to Fort William and
a smaller proportion still were made on the sleeper service.
It would, he said, be wrong to imply that the tourist industry would
be devastated by any change.

THE President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, is to be
pressed for all documents relating to the BMARK-Jonathan Aitken affair
before an all-party Commons select committee decides whether to launch
an inquiry.
This new twist to the arms-to-Iran saga emerged last night when the
committee chairman, Labour's Dr Dick Caborn, announced he wanted to
discuss the issue with Mr Heseltine.
Mr Aitken will have his first chance to defend himself in front of the
Commons today when he faces MPs for Treasury Questions.
Dr Caborn said the committee was seeking details of the Trade and
Industry department's internal investigations as well as assurances of
Whitehall co-operation before deciding whether to mount its own inquiry.
''We want to make sure that we have got access to all the information
so we can have a thorough inquiry and have some conclusions,'' he said.
Mr Aitken, the Treasury Chief Secretary, has denied in the Commons
that he had any knowledge of alleged BMARK deals to route weapons to
Iran, via Singapore, when he was a non-executive director of the arms
firm.
Crucial to a select committee inquiry is who decided that vital Secret
Service intelligence was not passed to the Department of Trade and
Industry, which was granting an unprecedented number of export licences,
only one in three of which had been properly documented.
Members of the select committee are anxious to recieve all the papers
on this issue, particularly as they were denied them on their inquiry
into the Iraq supergun affair, for which the Scott Committee is still
trying to determine responsibility.
Today will be the first time Mr Aitken has been quizzed since Mr
Heseltine disclosed BMARC may have illegally supplied naval guns to the
Tehran regime.
Mr Aitken was a non-executive director of the Grantham-based company
for two years from 1988 while some of the weapons were allegedly being
shipped to Iran via Singapore. He has denied any knowledge of the trade.
Earlier, Mr Heseltine suggested that his Cabinet colleague still had
questions to answer about the affair during an interview seen by
Opposition MPs as less than helpful to the beleaguered Chief Secretary.
It emerged last night that Mr Aitken could also face questioning from
Customs and Excise which is considering whether to launch a criminal
investigation into BMARC.
''We would be obliged to question everybody concerned if we found
there was anything to investigate,'' a Customs spokesman commented.
There was Labour laughter and jeers in the Commons yesterday when Mr
Heseltine claimed that he had an ''excellent'' relationship with Mr
Aitken.
Earlier, in a radio interview, Mr Heseltine had said he was ''very
conscious'' his Commons statement on Tuesday would ''lead to questions
to Jonathan''.
He said Mr Aitken ''had to answer his own questions'' over the affair.
Then, while insisting the two cases were different, he raised that of
Mr Neil Hamilton, who left the Government last October after
unsubstantiated allegations made it impossible to continue in office.
Asked at what stage a minister involved in a controversy had to accept
it might be in the interests of the Government to step aside, Mr
Heseltine told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ''Every Minister has to
make that decision.
''Neil Hamilton made that decision a few months ago when he was
responsible for the proper conduct of corporate behaviour in my
department.
''Allegations were made against him and he felt he should absent
himself from Government while those were resolved because they reflected
directly on the job he was doing in Government.
''In this particular issue, it doesn't relate to the responsibilities
Jonathan Aitken has as Chief Secretary to the Treasury.''
His subsequent claim that he found it ''inconceivable'' Mr Aitken
could have misled the Commons when he said last March that he had no
knowledge of sales to Iran did little to convince Opposition MPs that Mr
Heseltine was not deliberately increasing the pressure on his colleague.
Labour's trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said Mr
Heseltine's remarks were ''deeply damaging'' for the Chief Secretary.

HUSBAND suffering from ''morbid jealousy syndrome'' suffocated his
wife after deciding to force her to witness his suicide, a judge heard
yesterday.
Although his marriage was on the rocks, Bryan Pringle could not cope
with the thought that his wife, Heather, might be involved with another
man, the court was told.
He became convinced that she was having an affair with her boss after
discovering that she was on the pill and watching them kissing and
cuddling in a car outside the family home, Lord Ross heard at the High
Court in Edinburgh.
Pringle, of Allan Park Loan, Edinburgh, was originally charged with
murder but the charge was reduced to culpable homicide after he was
found to be suffering from what one psychiatrist called morbid jealousy
syndrome.
He admitted killing his 45-year-old wife in their home on March 25 or
26 this year.
Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, Advocate-depute, told the court that, while this
might look like a premeditated and deliberate murder, the Crown had
accepted a plea to culpable homicide.
This was because three psychiatrists who had examined Pringle
considered that he was suffering from a mental disorder that diminished
his responsibility for the killing.
Mr Bonomy said that from 1968 until December last year Pringle had
worked as an electronic technician with an engineering firm in Penicuik,
Midlothian.
He was regarded as a totally reliable and honest employee, but last
December he left the job for no apparent reason, a possible indication
of his state of mind at the time.
The couple married in 1968 and had three children -- Mark, 26, who no
longer lived in the family home, Darren, 24, and Lesley, 19, both of
whom had still been living with their parents.
''The root of the killings lay in the deteriorating relationship
between the accused and his wife,'' Mr Bonomy told the court.
Early last year Mrs Pringle was made redundant from her job as a
company director, and about the same time the marriage was coming to a
close. Sexual relations had ended and the couple had separate bedrooms.
In September last year Mrs Pringle got a job with the Edinburgh
cleaning firm, White of Liberton, and developed a close working
relationship with Mr Alistair White, the head of the company. They began
to attend functions and conferences together.
''Notwithstanding that his marriage had deteriorated, Pringle found it
difficult to cope with the idea of his wife having a relationship with
someone else,'' said the Advocate-depute.
Pringle began behaving in a bizarre fashion, but refused to accept
medical help.
On March 17 Mr White took Mrs Pringle to a dinner and when they
returned to Mrs Pringle's house they sat in the car outside, kissing and
cuddling. That became known to Pringle.
A week later Pringle cut lengths from a clothes line and tied them to
the castors of the bed in his room. Mrs Pringle had been at the theatre,
and when she returned Pringle pounced on her almost immediately. He
punched her, grabbed her by the throat, and knelt on her back before
tying her hands and gagging her with a tea towel.
Mr Bonomy said the cause of death was suffocation, coupled with the
other injuries, which suggested a sustained and determined assault.
Pringle told psychiatrists that he had intended to tie his wife to
immobilise her so that she would have no choice but to watch while he
committed suicide. After the attack he left his wife lying on the
bedroom floor and locked the door.
''The children returned home, unaware of the horror that lay behind
the locked door,'' added the Advocate-depute.
Early next morning Pringle made a 999 call to police from a phone box
near Penicuik to say that he had killed his wife. Police arrived at the
phone box to find him still holding the receiver.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, told the court that after killing his
wife Pringle had intended to commit suicide. At Craiglockhart Pond, near
his house, he taped a plastic bag over his head so that he would
suffocate.
However, with the normal human instinct, he panicked and tore the bag
off. He then lay down on the adjacent golf course, hoping to die from
exposure.
Mr Ogg explained that his client had undergone a vasectomy some years
earlier and believed that, if his wife was taking the pill, she must be
having an affair.
Pringle also believed that he had been meant to see his wife and Mr
White kissing and cuddling in the car.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice-Clerk, will sentence Pringle on June 28
after studying background reports.
After yesterday's hearing, Mr White was asked by Radio Forth about the
claims made in court about his relationship with Mrs Pringle. He
replied: ''My conscience is clear. Any allegations that were made are
totally without foundation.''
The Pringles' oldest son, Mark, made a plea for the family's privacy
to be respected, saying: ''We desperately need peace and quiet to try to
come to terms with what has happened and to begin to rebuild our lives.
''My family and I have been devastated by the terrible tragedy
involving both of our parents. We are trying hard to cope with the chain
of events set in motion by our mother's death and our father's arrest.''

Split, Wednesday
SIX British hostages released by the Bosnian Serbs flew to freedom
tonight.
They arrived at the British military headquarters in the Croatian port
of Split, anxious to telephone their families after a gruelling 24-hour
journey.
Although clearly tired, they were described as healthy and in good
spirits after being well treated by their captors.
They enjoyed a hearty breakfast in the town of Novi Sad close to
Serbia's border with Bosnia, after being driven in on a double-decker
bus with 20 other UN hostages.
After completing formalities, they were driven on to Belgrade to catch
a plane to the Croatian capital Zagreb and then on to Split.
Their first concern was to ring relatives, who have been glued to TV
and newspaper reports about the crisis since it erupted almost three
weeks ago.
Allan Warren, 47, of Cardiff, whose sergeant son Nick, 28, is among
the six, said: ''Hopefully, the boys will get some leave next week so we
can all have a proper celebration.
''Everyone is just so relieved to know they are all safe and well.''
Emlyn Jones, of Old Colwyn, Clwyd, father of Fusilier David Jones, 25,
summed up the euphoria of relatives, saying it was better than winning
the National Lottery.
''I don't envy those #22m lottery winners -- I have got my son back.''
Fusilier Jones's fiancee Abi Davis was busy making preparations for
their wedding which will now go ahead as planned in less than a month.
Arrangements had been put on hold when her soldier sweetheart was
seized by the Bosnian Serbs.
Families of the remaining hostages were also looking forward to joyful
reunions with their loved ones -- Fusiliers Ricky Smith, 26, Simon
Mainwaring, 27, Richard Boardwell, 23, and RAF Flight Lieutenant Andrew
Hall, 28, a UN observer.
The freed hostages are likely to be allowed home in about 10 days.
The five Royal Welch Fusiliers are expected to rejoin colleagues at
Bugojno for a few days, as the Muslim enclave of Gorazde where they were
seized is totally blockaded by the Bosnian Serbs.
Welsh Secretary John Redwood welcomed the release of the hostages and
praised their courage and diligence.
''The joy and delight of the Royal Welch Fusiliers' wives and families
at the release of their loved ones will be shared by everyone in
Wales,'' he said.
The good news was tempered by mounting fears of a massive escalation
in the 38-month Bosnian crisis as thousands of Bosnian army troops
massed north of Sarajevo.
The UN reported up to 30,000 Bosnian troops moving into the area
around Breza 12 miles to the north of the city.
UN officials said they would try to dissuade the Bosnian government
forces from mounting an offensive.
As British troops were placed on alert for possible reprisal attacks
by the Bosnian Serbs, Ministers pleaded for ''maximum restraint'' by the
warring factions.
Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg warned an all-out attack by
Bosnian army forces could provoke a cycle of increasing violence and
force the withdrawal of UN peacekeeping forces.

FRANCE is Europe's biggest military nuclear force. It is also one of
Europe's biggest exponents of nuclear power generation for civilian use.
And, uniquely, it lacks any form of organised anti-nuclear environmental
lobby.
Add to that mix the fundamental Gaullist attitude that no-one, not
even Washington, will be allowed to meddle in what it perceives as its
internal affairs, and the renewal of nuclear weapons testing in the
South Pacific takes on a new perspective.
The French have always gone their own way in defence. They pulled out
of Nato's integrated military command in 1966 because they resented US
domination of the Alliance and would brook no interference with their
own nuclear programme.
They have since built five missile-carrying submarines, and are in the
process of developing new atomic warheads for their M5 ballistic
missiles. To achieve that aim, they must experiment. In the modern
nuclear club, small is beautiful.
Britain, America, and Russia have all developed miniaturised warheads
for their long-range strike forces. The Chinese are some way behind
technologically, but moving rapidly in the same direction. The trick is
to lessen the bulk and weight of the weapons while losing none of their
destructive power.
The quantum leap in computer capabilities in the last two decades has
brought the whole business to the point where much of the testing can be
done by simulation. However many physicists employed in the defence
field and brought up in older traditions still prefer the option of a
real explosion.
It remains the tried and reliable method of spot-checking the nuclear
inventory. Even weapons of mass destruction have a shelf-life. It is
also invaluable for assessing the reliability and yield of new models of
warhead.
The current French argument that a limited series of eight trial
detonations is necessary to build up a complete computer simulation data
base and ensure continuing safety does not hold water.
Eight tests would be enough to allow a comprehensive study on a new
design. France, equipped with a new generation of smaller, highly
destructive warheads, could then afford to call a halt and sign the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty due for international ratification
next year.
Validation of the programme would allow development and weapons
production to proceed in the secure knowledge that the updated nuclear
firepower was available and reliable. Computer checks could then be used
to guarantee safety for the foreseeable future.
Behind the facade lies a vital plank of strategic French foreign
policy. Paris, probably realistically, sees the rapid growth of a
stand-alone European defence community based around the Western European
Union. This would exclude the United States and be dominated by French
doctrine and military might.
The United Kingdom is the only other member-state of the WEU to
possess nuclear weapons, albeit far fewer. The Vanguard-class Trident
boats have an awesome potential. The four boats either built or under
construction could, in theory, devastate more than 500 separate targets
at a range of up to 8000 miles.
However Britain, under pressure from the United States, will deploy no
more than 128 warheads. Since the missiles and their guidance systems
are US-supplied, Whitehall's options remain limited. Only the warheads
themselves are designed and made in the UK.
France, on the other hand, has its four Redoutable and one
L'Inflexible-class boats already in service, packing a total of 80
intercontinental-range missiles, 18 surface-to-surface missiles, and
more than 100 nuclear-capable bombers. All are co-ordinated under the
banner of the Force de Frappe (strike force) and stamped ''Made in
France''.
Talks have already taken place to lay the ground rules for a
Franco-British hegemony of Europe's nuclear future. It would be the
central core of a Europe-wide defence strategy. And the atomic umbrella
would no longer be American.
Britain needs France in this partnership. At the moment, the
mid-course guidance for British Trident missiles comes from US
satellites. Without the benefit of that global positioning system,
Trident would lose its pinpoint accuracy and a great deal of its value
as a sabre worth rattling in the councils of the mighty.
The French realised long ago that there was no such thing as an
independent deterrent unless the sharp end of the business could be
coupled to satellite backup. Their own Ariane and other systems now
dominate the European aerospace scene. The UK, with a shrinking defence
budget and a lesser urge towards total domination of its neighbours,
cannot afford a satellite system on anything approaching the same scale.
It is a partnership which, if not exactly made in heaven, was at least
made in the Elysee Palace. The UK swops dependency, but remains a big
league player in its own backyard.
None of the current howls of protest by Pacific rim nations about the
continued use of Mururoa Atoll as a test-bed will influence French
policy or intentions. It took three decades of steady pressure to
persuade France even to consent to underground blasts instead of the
much more dangerous atmospheric variety.
And before French Polynesia became ground zero, tests were carried out
in the Sahara. Feather-duster responses such as those of Australia and
New Zealand in cancelling military courtesy visits and joint training
programmes are empty gestures.
The major powers have little justification for assuming the moral high
ground now. Before President Clinton imposed a test moratorium in the
United States, the Pentagon was responsible for more than 1000 nuclear
tests. Moscow exploded at least 700 warheads and the Chinese are still
doing so in defiance of international opinion.
The principal difference was that all of these club members conducted
the experiments largely on their own contaminated soil. For obvious
reasons of geographical limitation, Britain carried out its first tests
in Australia, and then under licence in Nevada.
The MoD is still keen to find a convenient location for a handful of
further ''live'' tests. Like the French, Britain's military bureaucracy
remains eager to fine-tune its new toys.

Washington, Wednesday
THE FBI believes it has identified the mystery man known as John Doe
No 2, suspected of playing a role in the Oklahoma City bombing.
The man is a 22-year-old soldier who was in the truck rental office in
Junction City, Kansas, when Timothy McVeigh allegedly rented the truck
used in the bombing.
The young soldier, named as Todd Bunting, is thought to have had
nothing to do with McVeigh or the attack. His wife told a local paper
that he was at the Ryder truck rental office the day before McVeigh went
there, and police believe that the salesman at Ryders confused the two
days.
Bunting is said to be thick-set, with dark hair and a tattoo on his
upper left arm, and therefore fits the FBI description.
FBI officials have not yet made a statement on the matter but an
official said an announcement could come in the next few days.
So far, just two men have been charged with the attack, McVeigh and
his friend Terry Nichols. Police continue to investigate Nichols's older
brother, James, who was released by a court last month but remains under
close surveillance. Some other suspects are identified, some not.
The Detroit News has published an affidavit in the James Nichols case
offered to the court by the FBI. It includes suggestions that the two
Nichols brothers and McVeigh may have taken part in robbing a house in
Arkansas last year. Several guns and some money was stolen, and one of
the guns was reportedly found in James Nichols's house in Michigan.
The same document reveals that an informant told police that James
Nichols talked to him of the possibilities of setting a superbomb to
demolish a government target on about December 23, 1989. This was just
after the Lockerbie bombing, for which the informant said Nichols blamed
the government.
The informant went on to claim that Nichols specifically mentioned the
Murrah building in Oklahoma City, and drew a sketch of it. He then found
a newspaper clipping he had kept with a photograph of the place.
Nichols has flatly denied this very strange story, saying that he had
been to Oklahoma once, 20 years ago, and had never heard of the Murrah
building before the explosion. The informant, and the FBI, could offer
no suggestion why anyone should have been fixated on that particular
building.
BOGOTA: Colombian drug barons were probably behind last Saturday's
bombing that ripped through a street festival in the north-western city
of Medellin, said a presidential spokesman. He claimed traffickers had
probably hired Marxist urban guerrillas to set off the bomb, which
killed 29 people and wounded hundreds of others.

Washington, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Jacques Chirac, who is in Washington on his way to the G7
summit in Halifax, today flatly refused to reconsider his decision to
resume nuclear testing in the Pacific.
In a joint press conference with President Clinton, he defended the
decision by saying that there would be a limited number of small tests,
between next September and March next year, and promised that France
would sign the test ban treaty in the autumn of next year.
President Clinton remarked that the United States regretted the French
decision. He added: ''We have worked hard to try to stop the tests as a
way of setting up a greater willingness to have a comprehensive test ban
treaty.''
He said that France had been very helpful in persuading the UN to
extend the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Anti-nuclear demonstrators outside the White House were not appeased.
They denounced Mr Chirac, and France, and demanded that the United
States retaliate in some way for the French testing.
Until recently the United States, too, insisted that it needed to test
nuclear weapons to ensure that they were safe and efficient. American
underground tests in the Nevada deserts have continued for years on that
pretext. President Clinton finally summoned the courage to defy his
military advisers and end testing.
The final diplomatic argument was that the United States could hardly
call convincingly for an extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty if it
were still testing.
The Americans have observed that Mr Chirac was bound to protect the
force de frappe (strike force), as the political heir of General de
Gaulle. Some of them claim that the general was father of the French
bomb, which is not true: he inherited it from the Fourth Republic, of
which Francois Mitterrand was a luminary. Mr Chirac has merely continued
a policy that goes back more than 40 years.
He was asked if the protests from around the world did not bother him,
or the fact that the rest of the world is practically disarmed. He
replied: ''Unfortunately, I haven't really seen that the rest of the
world is disarmed.''
All day France vigorously rebuffed criticism from allies over its
decision, insisting that the good news was its agreement to end testing
forever next year.
Mr Chirac's announcement that Paris would conduct eight underground
tests at its South Pacific site on Mururoa Atoll unleashed a worldwide
flood of protests.
Australia and New Zealand suspended defence ties with France. New
Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon accused Paris of ''Napoleonic
arrogance''.
''What we are seeing is the arrogant action of a European colonial
power,'' New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger told Parliament.
Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama protested over the French
move and said he would raise the matter at the Group of Seven economic
summit in Canada this week.
The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior, a worldwide symbol for
environmental activists, set sail from New Zealand for Mururoa.
The ship left from Auckland harbour, where almost 10 years ago the
original Rainbow Warrior was blown up by French secret service agents as
Greenpeace prepared to set sail for the atoll.
Conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe, in a feisty defence in the
French Parliament, hit back at Washington and at Moscow, which also
expressed regret about the move. He noted a more ''understanding''
attitude from European allies.
''We should not allow ourselves to be impressed by advice and
sometimes exhortations from countries that have carried out 10 times
more tests than we have and have nuclear stockpiles vastly exceeding
France's,'' he said.
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said of Washington's criticism:
''France is a major power. It cannot put its security into the hands of
a third party, however powerful or friendly it may be.''
However left-wing opposition parties were highly critical and demanded
a special debate in Parliament.
Socialist leader Henri Emmanuelli called the decision a ''grave
error'' and said there was no military need for more tests since
France's arsenal would be operational until the year 2010.
Ecologists' protests also flooded in. Veteran oceanographer
Jacques-Yves Cousteau added his voice, regretting that Paris had ''given
in to out-dated arguments''.

A LABOUR candidate in Falkirk who lost an election by one vote after
five recounts yesterday won her battle for a rerun. The court decision
was supported by the Tory who beat her.
Mrs Moira Fitzpatrick lost to Mr Frank Hodge in the Laurmont ward in
Polmont, in the elections for the new Falkirk unitary council authority.
However, it was later revealed that she would have won the seat if all
the votes cast had counted. This was because two ballot papers in her
favour were thrown out as they had not been officially franked by staff
at the polling station.
Mrs Fitzpatrick launched a legal challenge to the result in a civil
action at Falkirk Sheriff Court. She claimed ''the acts or omissions of
the officials'' affected the result and that she should either be
declared the winner or that the election be declared void.
During the hearing in front of Sheriff Principal John Maguire, the
other parties -- Mr Hodge and Mr Douglas Sinclair, the returning officer
-- agreed.
The sheriff principal in his judgment yesterday ruled that there
should be a rerun of the election.
He said: ''It was not suggested that the failure to stamp had been
anything more than inadvertence.''
He noted that everyone involved in the election agreed it should be
declared void and a new election held. Mr Maguire said: ''I accept that
this is the course to follow.''
He added that there was ''clearly a flaw in the conduct of the
election''.
Last night, Mrs Fitzpatrick said: ''I had no option but to pursue
action through the courts.
''I'm slightly disappointed at not being declared the outright winner.
But I'm glad that the Sheriff Principal has accepted my arguments.''
Mr Hodge said: ''A rerun is the fairest decision for everyone. And
I'll be standing again and I'm confident I can win. But I hope it's not
as close as last time. I wouldn't want to go through that again.''
Mr Willie Anderson, leader of the Labour majority group on the new
Falkirk Council, said: ''I'm very confident that Moira Fitzpatrick will
win the forthcoming by-election and represent the Polmont ward.''
In April, the Laurmont ward election was contested by four candidates
-- Labour, Tory, SNP, and Liberal Democrats. The rerun is expected to be
held within three months.

Councillor furious at 'unfair' judgment
A COUNCILLOR who won his seat by one vote yesterday attacked a
historic legal decision that will force him to fight the seat again at a
by-election.
In judgment ona case he had heard last Wednesday, Sheriff Principal
Gordon Nicholson, QC, ruled yesterday that the election of independent
councillor Tom Dobson to the Southdean ward of Jedburgh was invalid.
Mr Dobson, a retired oil rig worker, said: ''I will stand again but
this is totally unfair and a waste of taxpayers' money.''
The case was brought by defeated Liberal Democrat candidate Pat Miller
who, after four recounts at the April election for the new Scottish
Borders Council, had one vote more than Mr Dobson.
However, the returning officer ruled that two papers which had not
been stamped by officials at the polling station were void and declared
Mr Dobson the winner by a single vote.
Mrs Miller said yesterday: ''I'm delighted this has been sorted out. I
will certainly be standing again and this time I expect to have a clear
majority. I will come out fighting.''
She added: ''My decision to bring the case was not sour grapes and was
certainly not aimed at my opponent. I simply felt that the law was wrong
and today's ruling seems to back this.''
The Sheriff Principal told the court earlier that he found the
decision difficult and he had rejected one claim by Mrs Miller, that the
seat should be transferred directly to her.
In the absence of previous Scottish case law, he had based his
by-election decision on an English ruling by Lord Denning. This ruling
said an election should be run again, where ballot papers were declared
invalid, and that decision directly affected the outcome.
Agents for Mrs Miller and the returning officer had both previously
agreed that there was nothing improper or disorganised in the election
conduct. The issue centred completely on the ballot paper ruling.
The Sheriff Principal granted costs to Mrs Miller but excluded the
bill of London lawyers consulted on her behalf by Borders Liberal
Democrat MP Archy Kirkwood.
He said: ''I find it very strange that a candidate in a local election
in a small town in the Borders would instruct London solicitors in the
first instance.''

AN Orkney head teacher has been suspended following a drugs raid on an
island beach party.
Ms Sandra Logan, 32, is understood to have been among seven people
searched by police officers who arrived on Eday by boat from a
neighbouring island.
Reports on three of the people -- including Ms Logan -- have been sent
to the procurator-fiscal, sources confirmed yesterday.
A police spokesman in Kirkwall refused to comment on her involvement
in the operation.
Four police officers, including a dog handler and sniffer dog from
Inverness, landed by small boat after crossing from Sanday.
The spokesman said that, acting on information received, seven people
had been searched at a beach party at the Bay of Doomy at which children
were present. Two properties on the island were also searched.
Ms Logan took over as head of Eday primary school, which has nine
pupils, two years ago.
She is understood to have left the island earlier this week after
being told of her suspension by Orkney's education director Jim
Anderson.
In a statement, Mr Anderson confirmed that Ms Logan had been suspended
but said the move was not part of a disciplinary procedure.

MR JONATHON CASTLE, the Greenpeace activist captaining the vessel
Altair, which is shadowing the Brent Spar on the way to its deep-water
grave, told The Herald yesterday he would not appear in the Court of
Session this morning as ordered by Lord Johnston.
''I haven't received any official notification, there is not enough
time to get there, and I have a job to do here,'' he said.
Asked if it did it not concern him that he could be jailed if he did
not turn up, he replied: ''I guess that is a possibility but it would be
a small price to pay in comparison to the environmental disaster that is
going to happen if we don't stop Shell dumping the Brent Spar.''
Mr Castle said he had learned of the court order by hearsay but had
received no official notification of it.
That, however, was not because of any lack of effort on Shell's part.
After Tuesday's court hearing, the company took what it described as
''appropriate measures'' to ensure he knew he was due in court.
The contents of the court order were intimated through a loudspeaker
from a helicopter hovering above the Altair and paper copies of the
order, in waterproof containers, were put on board the Altair from a
fast rescue craft. Attempts were also made to convey the order by fax
and radio.
Shell said it was confident that the legal requirement to make every
effort to ''intimate'' the court order had been discharged fully.
''Mr Castle has given interviews to the media indicating he is aware
of the court order and that he does not intend to attend the court,'' a
spokesman said. ''If he does not attend, that will be a matter for the
Court of Session to consider.''
Mr Castle said they had been hosing down the Altair's decks when the
package, ''whatever it was'', was thrown on board and, before they could
retrieve it, it was washed overboard.
He also confirmed that they had been hosing down the helideck when the
helicopter was overhead. ''It gets very dirty and dusty,'' he said.
He said it would be dangerous to try to land someone on the helideck
without permission and he would discourage anyone from trying to do so
unless it was an emergency.
* No-one has yet owned up to causing two large oil slicks sighted in
the North Sea yesterday, according to the Marine Pollution Control Unit.
An MPCU spokeswoman in Southampton said a surveillance aircraft from
Inverness logged the slicks at 4am, following an unconfirmed report from
the oilfield standby vessel Grampian Falcon near Shell's Cormorant Alpha
platform late on Tuesday.
The pollution, described as ''grey and silver sheen'', covered an area
20km by 1km in the larger slick, 90 miles north-east of Lerwick. The
second, very similar, slick was seven miles to the south-west and 10km
long by 0.2km wide.
The MPCU said: ''We don't know who did it. There are no reports of
oiled birds in the area. We continue to monitor the situation.''
Samples have been flown to Aberdeen for laboratory analysis in the
hope of tracing the culprits.
There have now been three unattributed oil spills north-east of
Shetland in the past 10 days.

THE dumping of the Brent Spar is proving a matter of extreme
sensitivity elsewhere in Europe.
Yesterday, a Shell filling station in Germany was raked by bullets and
environmentalists there were urging a boycott of Shell stations.
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel has condemned Royal Dutch/Shell's
plans to sink the redundant offshore loading installation in the
Atlantic and has indicated he would raise the issue at the Group of
Seven (G7) summit in Canada this week.
Shell claimed yesterday that the boycott was having no significant
effect but the situation is concerning the company enough to take
full-page adverts in German newspapers to state its case.
Mr Waigel told the Rheinische Merkur newspaper: ''I think what Shell
is doing with the installation is unacceptable. Just to sink something
like that in the sea is intolerable.''
Asked whether he would raise the matter with his British colleagues at
the Halifax summit of the seven leading industrial nations, Mr Waigel
replied: ''I think this is an opportunity. If Europe can show itself
capable of negotiating solutions in issues such as this, this would be a
motivation for us all.''
Mr Guido Westerwelle, general secretary of the Free Democratic Party,
endorsed the boycott and said FDP vehicles would not be fuelled with
Shell petrol.
The Greens said in a statement that the Brent Spar was laden with 130
tonnes of toxic waste and its sinking would set a precedent for the
disposal of 400 other North Sea platforms.

A SHERIFF yesterday ordered a driver, who sued the parents of a youth
who died in a crash he caused, to pay all of the legal costs in the case
he lost.
Sheriff Sir Stephen Young, who earlier branded Alan Inglis selfish and
indifferent, allowed solicitors acting for Mr and Mrs Bill McKeegan, to
increase their costs by 20% because of the workload involved and the
anguish experienced by the couple in clearing their son from any blame.
Earlier this week, the Sheriff threw out the #60,000 damages claim
against the McKeegans and criticised Inglis's part in the civil court
action brought at Greenock Sheriff Court.
Inglis, a fishmonger of Manor Crescent, Gourock, was convicted of
reckless driving following the head-on crash in which Stuart was killed
in July 1991.
Inglis was fined and banned from driving for four years. He raised the
civil action against Stuart's parents, of Lomond Road, Wemyss Bay,
claiming the 18-year-old had been wholly or partly to blame for the
accident at Inverkip.
Stuart was killed when his vehicle was hit by Inglis's caron a bend on
the A78. The student had been on the way to his grandmother's house.
In written judgment, Sir Stephen criticised Inglis's version of
events, saying there was nothing about the manner in which he gave his
evidence which had a particular ring of truth about it.
When the Sheriff considered awarding expenses at Greenock yesterday,
the solicitor representing Inglis, Mr Alastair Leggat, did not contest
that they should be met by his client. However, he argued certain costs
to cover the employment of counsel and certain expert witnesses and
consultants hired by the defendants should not be permitted.
He urged the Sheriff not to allow an increase of fees to lawyer, Mr
Alan Paton, who acted on behalf of the McKeegans.
However, Sir Stephen found Inglis liable in all respects.
Neither of the parties involved were in court to hear the outcome but
Mrs Joan McKeegan said last night: ''This is fantastic news. I am
absolutely delighted. We couldn't have asked for anything more.''
It is believed the total costs involved could run as high as #30,000
but the final figure will not be known until all accounts have been
submitted for approval to the Sheriff Clerk's office.

IF the People newspaper was a football team, it wouldn't even beat
Accrington Stanley, the jury hearing the Graeme Souness libel case was
told yesterday.
Lord Williams, QC, counsel for the former Rangers and Liverpool
manager, added: ''I shouldn't have said that -- it's rather unfair to
Accrington Stanley.''
In his closing submissions at the High Court in London, Lord Williams
said the Sunday newspaper's conduct from start to finish had been a
''24-carat disgrace''. They had showed ''all the courage of a dead
chicken and less decency than an elderly skunk.''
He described the 1993 article in the People, which labelled Mr Souness
a ''dirty rat'', as a classic bit of sleaze journalism.
Mr Souness, he said, although no saint, had behaved with generosity
and decency towards his former wife, Danielle.
Lord Williams claimed the paper used Mrs Souness in its ''seedy shoddy
conspiracy'' to knock her ex-husband at a time when there was
speculation that he would lose his job as Liverpool manager.
''Unfortunately for them, they got it wrong. He wasn't getting the
sack.''
Pointing to the newspaper's masthead, Lord Williams read: ''First with
the People.'' He told the jury: ''First with The People. Last with the
truth.''
Lord Williams said the reason no-one from the newspaper had given
evidence was because their behaviour was so disgraceful they could not
even begin to defend it.
He said the People had exploited Mr Souness's children by putting them
on the front page, and that Mrs Danielle Souness was not a person who
could be relied on to stick to anything she had agreed.
In its interview with Mrs Souness, the paper said he ordered her,
their sons Fraser and Jordan, and adopted daughter Chantelle, to leave,
by Christmas Eve 1992, Norton Farm, at Worplesdon, Surrey, the home he
had provided for them after their split.
Mrs Souness also claimed that Mr Souness refused to pay the boys'
school fees and that she was living on hand-outs from her parents.
Lord Williams argued that Mr Souness had shown ''phenomenal
generosity'' by providing her with Norton Farm at a cost of #1m. He
bought it so he could have ''quality time'' with his children.
Its rental value was #2000 per month. In reply to her husband's
request for a nominal rent, she had offered just 25p per week.
Mr Souness had offered her everything she wanted ''on a plate'', said
Lord Williams. She could have stayed at the house until their son,
Jordan, now 10, was 18, if she had been willing to sign a tenancy
agreement.
If the article had mentioned that, it would have been blown out of the
water, he added.
Lord Williams asked if it was a coincidence that Mrs Souness's
attitude changed in April 1992, when Mr Souness met his second wife,
Karen.
''Who knows all the secrets of the human heart, but jealousy is one of
them.''
He said the article was ''absolutely pathetic'' and a ''100% lie''.
Lord Williams, calling for ''massive damages'', said Mr Souness did
not want the money, he wanted the justice, but the jury could only
measure the justice in the money.
''If our law gave the power to you to direct the People to publish a
whacking big apology on the front page, that would be good -- but it
doesn't.''
Earlier, Mr George Carman, QC, for the People, argued that Mr Souness
was not entitled, either morally or legally, to a penny damages.
He added: ''When a man behaves badly he inflicts damage to others
perhaps, but the person he wounds most is himself. The man who damaged
Graeme Souness most is himself.''
Mr Souness's second wife started weeping and her husband gripped her
hand as Mr Carman said Mr Souness had earned #7.57m over a 10-year
period.
He said: ''The gilt on the gingerbread of this man's wealth is the 2.2
million shares he received while at Glasgow Rangers.
''#7.5m over a 10-year period works out at #750,000 a year. That's
#15,000 a week before tax. Even at the top rate of tax, it would still
leave Souness with an average of #8000 a week.''
After Mrs Souness was ''evicted'' from Norton Farm, Mr Souness had
offered less than #50 per week maintenance for the two boys.
''Does that in all humanity sit comfortably with the assertion that at
all times he put his childen first?''
Mr Carman said there was no doubt that Mr Souness, of Mere, Knutsford,
Cheshire, loved his children and had been generous to them for the
majority of his life.
''The great sadness is that, when he has chosen, he has withdrawn that
generosity to exercise power and control over Danielle.''
He added: ''The key to Graeme Souness and his character is a desire to
exercise power and control. No doubt he did it very successfully on the
football pitch but, in human life, when you come to your own wife and
children, different considerations arise.''
Referring to Mr Souness's behaviour over Norton Farm, Mr Carman
described him as ''The Great Dictator''.
''He was wearing Danielle down, making her feel anxious and insecure,
trying to bring her to heel, trying to crush her,'' he said.
''This was Graeme Souness, the wealthy man, exercising power and
control. We say that's the conduct of a man behaving dishonourably,
nastily, unfairly and cruelly to his wife.
''And that conduct justifies the description, in popular language,
'you're a dirty rat'.''
Publishers MGN deny libel and say the story is true.
The hearing was adjourned until today, when the judge will sum up to
the jury.

THE noblest prospect which a Scotsman ever sees is the high road that
leads him to England,'' Dr Johnson said. There was more than an element
of criticism in the Doctor's remark, he not then knowing that Scotland
was to provide him with a biographer who would immortalise him in a way
he would have missed had Boswell not taken that road.
The notion that rather too many Scots are coming down the road and
branching off to arrive at Westminster surfaced yesterday when the
Commons debated the recommendations of the Parliamentary Boundaries
Commission for England which proposes changes to existing constituencies
to come into effect at the next General Election.
In distant centuries past, Scottish excursions south were mostly
limited to cattle-lifting and other forms of pillage and destruction,
but from about the Union of the Crowns Scots set off further south to
find fame and fortune. Nearly 400 years later the English, historically
slow to react to threats, may have decided enough is enough.
Before the Scottish issue flared, the discussion remained parochial.
Why had the Commission named a new constituency Rochford and Southend
East instead of Southend East and Rochford, angrily demanded Sir Teddy
Taylor, the present MP for Southend East.
Could the Commission move West Ham football team into East Ham
constituency wondered Mr Tony Banks who is likely to be the new Member
for East Ham when his present -- I'm sorry if this is confusing --
Newham North-west seat is abolished.
Mr Jack Straw, Shadow Home Secretary, said he didn't think so but he
was grateful to West Ham for their part in helping his constituency
football team Blackburn win the Premiership.
Mr Straw had a a bit of fun with Conservative Central Office's best
Stalinist days being behind them. He had been brought up, he confided,
on tales of the fearsome efficiency of this body in bending Boundary
Commissions and other organisations to its will, but this time he had
found Labour made well organised representations while the Tories had
been every constituency for itself, the outcome proving very
satisfactory to the Opposition.
Dame Angela Rumbold, a Tory deputy chairman, made a few derogatory
references to Labour apparatchiks, denied that Central Office had or
wished to have any coercive powers and summed up that they were quite
happy with the reorganisation which, it was estimated, would be worth
seven or eight seats to them at the next election.
The Sketch was wondering about the mathematical relation of that to
Labour's current colossal opinion poll lead when Dame Angela said firmly
that when the Home, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Secretaries got
together to prepare guidance for the next review they should deal with
the ''imbalance'' in seats between England and Scotland and Wales.
This polite way of saying there are too many Scottish MPs was robustly
expanded by Mr John Marshall (Hendon North -- Con.). Why, he thundered,
should Glasgow be given little constituencies of around 50,000 while a
similar urban area, Greater London, had mostly much bigger seats going
up to 83,000?
Mr Marshall is not English nationalist. He is a Scot. Indeed he twice
fought Dundee East in the 1960s and not getting on there took the high
road to England.
Educated at Harris Academy, Dundee, and Glasgow and St Andrews
universities, the man has clearly been trained to think and the outcome
of his thought was that the average size of a Scottish constituency
should be the same as the average size of an English one, give or take
the Western Isles or Orkney and Shetland.
Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP whose Hammersmith seat is disappearing
because, at 47,000 voters, it is considered too small, though almost as
big as the new beefed-up Glasgow seats, had thought of a charming way to
salvage his constituency.
It might become Hammersmith and the Western Isles. He would represent
the former in the winter and the latter in the summer. He reluctantly
decided the Boundary Commissions would not buy it.
But his second idea could catch on if the public get to hear about it.
Cut the number of MPs from the 659 it will be after the next election to
about 450. Now that's what a voter might consider a noble prospect.

THE Government yesterday was challenged to allow ''the truth over
Lockerbie to emerge''.
Labour MP Tam Dalyell (Linlithgow), who has persistantly questioned
Ministers over the 1998 outrage in which PanAm flight 103 was blown up
-- killing 270 people -- raised the issue at the Scottish Grand
Committee.
His move comes after suggestions that there were now doubts about the
timing device used in the bombing, which forms part of the case against
two Libyans accused of the atrocity.
Mr Dalyell said the Commons Table Office yesterday had ''refused a
crucial question over the authenticity or otherwise of the timing
device''.
He added that this followed a block being put on questions in April.
Mr Dalyell challenged Scottish Secretary Ian Lang: ''Do the Government
want the truth over Lockerbie to emerge?'' Mr Lang said the blocking of
questions was not a matter for him.
''I shall continue to answer such questions as I properly can about
these matters in accordance with convention and practice.''
Labour MP Dr Norman Godman (Greenock and Port Glasgow) asked whether
Mr Lang really believed whether those responsible would ever stand trial
in Edinburgh. Mr Lang said there would be ''no let up'' in efforts to
bring those responsible to justice.
Later, Mr Dalyell raised the Lockerbie issue again in a short debate.
He
claimed Downing Street had made it clear to the Lord Advocate after
the bombing that it ''should be played low-key''.
He said: ''At the very earliest stage, Mrs Thatcher was personally and
intimately involved. Her view was that what the Americans wanted done,
must be done.''
The Crown Office had not followed up the right leads, he said.

SCOTTISH MPs were involved in furious exchanges at Westminster
yesterday over nurses' pay.
In a special session of questions in the Scottish Grand Committee, the
issue was raised by Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy, who called for
a statement on the implementation of this year's pay award for nurses in
Scotland.
All but one of the 47 trusts in Scotland -- the exception being Angus
-- now have made made offers close to the 3% target level, but this did
not satisfy Opposition MPs, including the SNP's victor in the Perth and
Kinross by-election, Roseanna Cunningham, who made her first Commons
contribution.
In an aggressive question, which she followed by heckling of the
ministerial reply, she said there was enough cash to fund the nurses'
pay award in full.
She told the committee: ''There is enough money in the system to offer
all the nurses 3% across the board.''
The Government, through its system of local pay bargaining, was
running the risk of ''setting nurse against nurse and trust against
trust.''
Mr Lang, who welcomed Ms Cunningham to the committee, said all the
trusts were on their way to securing a sensible settlement and that it
was important to recognise that NHS spending had grown above inflation.
From the Labour benches, Mrs Helen Liddell (Monklands East) said the
Government's policies were having a devastating on morale, with nurses
feeling their role was being downgraded.
The Scottish Secretary replied that Mrs Liddell was wrong about
morale, and that nurses' income had increased by 78% over the last 15
years.
Meanwhile, the last NHS trust in Scotland without a pay offer to
nurses and other health workers on the table refused to panic last night
over the dubious distinction which Mr Lang had highlighted earlier in
the day.
The Forfar-based Angus NHS Trust, less than three months into its
existence and hampered by illness among key staff, calmly carried on
getting its act together and reassuring staff that they were not going
to lose out.
The Royal College of Nursing, which has adopted a policy of picking
out trust stragglers for special attention, was taking a sympathetic
view of Angus, which serves Tayside Health Board with three infirmaries
-- at Forfar, Arbroath and Montrose -- and a string of local hospitals.
Mr Ron Macleod, nursing director and acting chief executive, said:
''Although the other trusts have made offers we are not aware of them
being accepted, so we see no reason to panic.
''But we are keeping our staff informed about what is happening, and
obviously if anything else comes from the Scottish Office we will have
to review the position. In the meantime, we are trying to reassure our
staff that they are not going to be disadvantaged -- we expect our offer
when it comes to be comparable to those of other trusts.''
The RCN's Scottish secretary, June Andrews, said a relaxed approach
was being taken over Angus -- ''they have had a lot of sickness among
their management, so we aren't planning to subject them to any special
attention.''
However, she added:''The thing about almost everyone being close to 3%
is that it demonstrates the near-uniformity of the offers being made
across the UK. It seems a bit sad that we have had so many months of
wrangling to get this figure, especially since it is not the right
figure.
''The show won't be over until every trust is offering 3% without
strings, but the Government have demonstrated they can get people to
move a long way and get a certain level of uniformity without local pay
bargaining.''
Mr Lang's statement appeared to contain little to comfort the trust
chief executives now left high and dry by the Government's edict that
their offers should have no strings. Last week Mr Donald McNeill, of
South Ayrshire Trust, said that managements which had budgeted offers on
the basis of the savings they would make from the attached strings would
now have to renegotiate their contracts with their health boards.
However, his protests were dismissed by the Scottish Office. A
spokesman said: ''We are not aware of any trust saying they were
reducing the percentage because the strings were having to come off. A
trust which has everything signed and sealed with the health board on
the basis of strings attached to the pay offer hasn't left itself much
scope for meaningful negotiations.''

THE Government emphasised last night the importance it attached to
care in the community as Labour stepped up its attack on the lack of
resources.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton emphasised the
need for close co-operation between health boards, social work
departments and housing authorities.
He gave full backing to the role of carers, stating that it always had
been the case that people had been cared for at home by their families.
The Government, therefore, had been pleased to support the Carers
(Recognition and Services) Bill, being piloted through parliament by
Labour MP Malcolm Wicks.
Lord James told the Scottish Grand Committee: ''Probably the most
practical support we can give to carers is to offer them respite from
time to time. The opportunity to take a holiday for a week or two, or
simply a break of a few hours during the day is enormously beneficial''
Setting out the Government's position on care in the community, Lord
James said the aim of the policy was to assist people, as far as
possible, to live in their own homes with support where that was needed.
Lord James said the Government had established a working group to
review the current registration and inspection procedures for
residential care homes, with a parallel exercise being undertaken for
nursing homes. The group would report in the autumn, but it was
important that the regulatory framework supported and ensured good
quality care.
From the Labour Front Bench, Mrs Maria Fyfe criticised the way in
which the Government's community care policy was working in practice.
She spoke of hospitals closed too early, increased stress levels,
deteriorating services and a lack of national standards.
Mrs Fyfe, MP for Glasgow Maryhill, said services were ''patchy and
inadequate,'' and told the committee: ''Mentally ill people are being
discharged from hospital with too little experience of the world
outside.''

LABOUR yesterday stepped up its bid to woo business and industry and
convince the City that it is ''the real party of business and
enterprise.''
Party leader Tony Blair took his message into the heart of the City,
and at a forum of businessmen and women organised by Labour he
emphasised the party's commitment to sound and stable public finances
and said it would launch the biggest consultation of firms ever by a
political party.
Mr Blair told the conference that for too long the approach had been
dominated by ''closures, rationalisation and cost-cutting.
''We now need an approach which achieves a modern competitiveness for
Britain -- producing quality goods and services consumers want to buy at
prices they are willing to pay by achieving high productivity which will
earn good profits for investors and good wages and conditions for
employees.''
Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Jack Cunningham told the same
audience that New Labour was absolutely determined to be tough on
inflation and tough on the causes of inflation and would pursue
well-designed policies that would not ruin the economy in the process of
tackling inflation.
He said Labour would replace the Mergers and Monopolies Commission and
the Office of Free Trading with a single Competition and Consumer
Standards Office ''to root out and deal with restrictive practices, such
as price-fixing and rigged tenders , and anti competitive practices such
as abuse of monopoly power''.

SCOTTISH Office Minister George Kynoch was yesterday ordered to
accelerate the Government initiative enforcing a private-sector role in
major public service projects.
The announcement by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang that his Industry and
Local Government Minister had been made responsible co-ordinating the
Private Finance Initiative brought Opposition fears that this would
herald private-sector involvement not just in constructing capital
projects such as hospitals but in operating them.
This unease surfaced at Westminster during the debate of the Scottish
Grand Committee on the situation in Stonehaven, where the private sector
has been invited to tender for hospital provision.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson accused the Government of a
''betrayal'' of the health service the people ''love and depend on''
but, from the Government Front Bench a clearly angry Mr Kynoch argued
that the the public sector was not a bottomless pit.
What the Government was trying to do was to involve the private sector
in health service funding. Services still would be provided within the
National Health Service, free at the point of delivery, he said.
Announcing the extension of Mr Kynoch's Scottish Office brief earlier
yesterday, Mr Lang said: ''He will co-ordinate the Scottish Office's
drive to ensure maximum benefit from the involvement of private finance
and expertise in public projects.''
Mr Lang said the Private Finance Initiative offered significant
opportunities for securing necessary investment and improving efficiency
and value for money in the delivery of public services in Scotland. ''I
am fully committed to it,'' said Mr Lang.
''All capital spending schemes in areas for which I am directly
responsible will be required to demonstrate that private sector
alternatives have been fully considered before public finance is made
available. I shall also expect other public authorities with
responsibility for major capital projects to do likewise.''
Mr Kynoch said: ''I see it as my role to ensure that the benefits from
this policy are maximised within the area of Scottish Office
responsibility. This is a clear challenge for both public and private
sector. We seek to work in partnership to ensure improved public
services throughout Scotland.''
NEW guidelines on provision of medical treatment in schools are to be
issued later this year south of the Border, Scottish Office Minister
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton disclosed, adding that similar action for
Scotland was being considered.
He said many schools were giving medication appropriately and the
system was working well. ''But there are worries in some cases about
indemnity if a teacher happens to give wrong doses and something goes
wrong.''

THE Prime Minister is to meet pro-European back benchers in a bid to
keep his party united, amid warnings from Euro-sceptics that a
leadership challenge now looks inevitable.
Europhiles are alarmed at the Prime Minister's increasingly
Euro-sceptic tone and will ask him for assurances there has been no
policy shift when they meet him on June 29.
Their fears were heightened by Mr Major's remarks to the Fresh Start
Group of Euro-sceptics on Tuesday night, when he reportedly said he was
''persuadable'' over a single currency.
However, even this failed to reassure right-wingers who now expect a
leadership challenge in November, with former Chancellor Norman Lamont
touted as the most likely stalking horse.
The sceptics want the Premier to rule out signing Britain up to
monetary union once and for all, but pro-Europeans would treat any such
commitment as a declaration of war.
The Prime Minister last night told the party it was ''absolute folly''
to fight over Europe and revealed that he is working on a ''reassurance
package'' to win back disenchanted voters.
Mr Major told warring Tory Euro-sceptics and pro-Europeans to
concentrate on attacking Labour who planned to ''sell Britain out to a
federal Europe''.
He disclosed plans for measures to help party fortunes in the run-up
to the General Election in an interview in today's Daily Express. The
package reportedly includes cuts in inheritance tax and an easing of the
rules under which people's homes are used to pay for nursing care.
Mr Major also rebuffed those who claim he is ripe for toppling in an
autumn leadership challenge by declaring that he expected to lead the
party into the next election.

LORD Plumb, leader of the British Conservatives in Europe, last night
condemned Tory Euro-sceptics as ''dishonest and disreputable'' for
linking Mr Major's continued Premiership to the issue of a single
currency, (Murray Ritchie writes from Strasbourg).
In an outspoken speech in Luxembourg to Conservatives Abroad, Lord
Plumb attacked those in the party urging Mr Major to become more
sceptical on Europe and who want him to rule out British participation
in a single currency now.
His remarks are a sign that pro-Europeans in the deeply divided
Conservative Party are beginning a concerted fightback ahead of the next
General Election.
ARCH-Unionist Sir Teddy Taylor yesterday conceded that the European
dimension had made the prospect of Scottish independence more attractive
to voters, but he called on Scots Tories to fight this shift in opinion
tooth and nail.
The former Cathcart MP, speaking on the Colin Bell programme on BBC
Radio Scotland, said people did not realise how close Scotland had now
come to the possibility of breaking away from the UK and accused voters
of not taking that threat seriously enough at a time when the arguments
in favour of independence had become ''greater and more positive.''
He said the future for the Scottish Tories lay in fighting as the only
party committed to the unity of the UK. Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
should take of his kid gloves and become a street-fighter for the Union,
.

THE number of people out of work fell yet again last month, to its
lowest level for four years, according to figures released yesterday.
Every region of the UK recorded a drop in unemployment as the overall
total showed a decrease for the 21st consecutive month. However, the
rate of decline is continuing to slow down.
The Employment Department said the seasonally adjusted jobless total
was 2,317,800, down 10,000 on April, and now represents 8.3% of the
workforce, the lowest ratio since June, 1991. Unemployment has fallen by
660,700 since its peak in December 1992.
However, the drop last month was the smallest for some time, and
compares with decreases of 19,000 in April, almost 20,000 in March, and
more than 25,000 in February.
In Scotland, the figure reached a five-year low of 8%, with a
seasonally adjusted total of 200,500 -- 2000 people fewer than in April.
Scottish Office Industry Minister George Kynoch welcomed the figures
and said the unemployment rate in Scotland had been below that of the UK
for more than three years.
''This is quite an achievement but there is no reason for complacency
about unemployment in Scotland. I am very keen to see further
improvements and feel confident that the Government's package of
carefully targeted employment and training measures, in conjunction with
the general improvement in the economy, will help to achieve this aim.''
However, his political opponents were less optimistic. SNP spokeswoman
Ms Anne McNair said: ''These fiddled figures do nothing to tackle the
underlying problems facing Scotland's workforce. The number of Scots
facing poor pay and job insecurity is rising beyond toleration.''
Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said the jobless tally would be
swollen over the summer by graduating students and he renewed demands
for policies to create a growing economy in Scotland.
STUC general secretary Campbell Christie said the Prime Minister
should use the G7 summit to promote international action to tackle an
unemployment crisis which was gripping even the world's wealthiest
nations.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo welcomed yesterday's figures,
which he said put Britain close to the top of the European jobs league.
''Provided we do not put jobs at risk through unnecessary policies
such as the social chapter or a national minimum wage, Britain will
continue to have more people in jobs and fewer people out of work than
any comparable country in Europe,'' he said.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: ''These dismal figures
show that recovery in the labour market is in danger of stalling. Fewer
people are in work in the first quarter of 1995.''
The CBI said: ''The continued fall in unemployment, now stretching
back 21 months, is very welcome. But the decline in the rate of fall
points up the continuing need to improve our competitiveness.''
Shadow employment secretary Harriet Harman said May last year had seen
nearly double last month's fall in the claimant count.
Yesterday's figures also showed that the number in jobs had fallen by
14,000 in the last quarter, affecting both services and manufacturing,
she said.
''This is a worrying sign when the economy should be gaining ground.
The Government is not running the economy in a way that creates enough
jobs. There are still 1.5 million fewer jobs in the economy than there
were in March 1990.
''Mr Portillo's complacency about the figures will simply confirm in
people's minds that the Government is out of touch and doesn't care.''

SCOTLAND'S public ferry company Caledonian MacBrayne appears to have
been barred from bidding for the Orkney and Shetland ferry services.
The Scottish Office yesterday officially opened the door to tenders
for the routes, currently operated by P &amp; O Scottish Ferries, but
limited it to bidders from the private sector.
The news was greeted with dismay by Mr Colin Paterson, managing
director of CalMac. He said: ''It does seem a bit ridiculous. I think we
are not too bad at running ferry services. If we are allowed to bid then
we will bid but we will be disappointed if we are excluded.
''However, we are owned by the Government and if that is their
decision then we must abide by it.''
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the Roads and Transport Minister, started
the bidding process rolling with the announcement that an advert would
be placed in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
The deadline for expressions of interest is July 21, invitations for
operators to tender will be issued in autumn and the proposed start date
for the new contracts will be early 1977.
''The Scottish Office is committed to continued support for shipping
services to Orkney and Shetland,'' said Lord James. ''Competitive
tendering for the passenger ferry services will ensure that value for
money is achieved on these services.''
In a move which may pacify the growing unrest over the lack of
consultation on the issue, the Scottish Office said that both islands
councils would be consulted fully about the service specifications for
the contract before tender invitations go out.
The tender bids, which will cover passenger roll on/roll off services,
will be decided on the basis of the amount of subsidy needed to operate
services to and from the northern isles.
Mr Malcolm Green, chief executive of Shetland Islands Council, said
the priority for islanders was a cheaper and effective service rather
than who operated it.
A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council said it had drawn up its
proposals for the tender specifications: ''We hope the Scottish Office
will take them into account.''

THE long-term future of Hopetoun House, one of the country's top
visitor attractions, has been secured by the biggest cash hand-out to
Scotland -- a total of #4m -- from the Government-backed National
Heritage Memorial Fund.
Announcing yesterday what it described as ''a really quite
extraordinary grant'' the Hopetoun House Preservation Trust revealed it
had been facing an ''impossible future''.
''Cash flow projections would have made it very difficult to continue
on the present basis and we would have been talking about extremely
restricted access for visitors,'' said Dr Diana Henderson, chairman of
the trustees.
She revealed that in looking for solutions to their financial
difficulties affecting the house, on the banks of the Forth near South
Queensferry, the possibility of a ''Woburn-type set-up with lions'' had
been considered.
She told a press conference to announce the cash injection that she
felt the ''lions'' solution for helping to preserve a stately home was
not one for this day and age.
''People are looking for a quality experience,'' said Dr Henderson,
who stated that the trustees also had explored the possibility of
financing from the European Construction and Development Fund.
''We tried to explore every single avenue,'' added Dr Henderson who
said that when the trust was set up in 1974 there was a #400,000
endowment which had been a lot of money at that time.
''You can't run a house like Hopetoun on that now. It just does not
work.''

ONLY a handful of Scottish projects have made the short leet in the
UK-wide battle to win billions of pounds of lottery funds from the
Millennium Commission.
It is feared fewer than 15 of the 82 Scottish applications are on the
list --with the Highlands and Islands, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen
in particular the major losers.
The short leet -- whittled down from 500 UK applications -- will be
officially announced this morning, but following extensive inquiries The
Herald can reveal that it excludes:
* The ''Gateway to the Highlands and Islands'' plan for a #20m
millennium Centre at Oban, expected to create 500 jobs and boost the
local economy by almost #11m a year;
* The application for #50m towards a university for the Highlands and
Islands, and:
* The bid for #15.8m towards creating a #26.3m Gaelic World Study
Centre on Skye.
One leading Highlands' sponsor said there will be ''widespread
dismay'' that so many applications supported by the public and relevant
bodies were turned down.
It is also understood the nine-strong Millennium Commission has
rejected -- for the time being -- the British Waterways Board's
application for #50m towards the #100m reopening of the
Glasgow-Edinburgh canal link.
The canal plan is thought to require more work for consideration at a
later date for lottery funds.
Herald inquiries suggest a similar ''no go'' stance has been taken on
Glasgow District Council's #70m plan for a Glasgow Green regeneration;
Edinburgh District Council's #111m ''Dynamic City'' project, and
Aberdeen's #67m millennium Square proposal.
It is believed many other Glasgow and Edinburgh bids have been
rejected outright -- including the Greater Easterhouse Communities'
project for 50% towards a #13.5m multi-use arts, education and leisure
centre.
But inquiries confirmed the short leet does include the millennium
Forest consortium, seeking #50m for more than 200 projects; the
Ayrshire-based Asset team behind a plan to breathe new life into
Ardrossan, Saltcoats, and Stevenston; Glasgow Zoopark -- and the #60m
''Field of Dreams'' project for Hampden Park, lodged by Queen's Park.
It is understood Glasgow Development Agency's application for a #90m
redevelopment of the 47-acre Glasgow Garden Festival site at Pacific
Quay is also on the short leet. By implication, a rival bid, from Clyde
Festival Gardens 1999 Ltd, has fallen.
The GDA plan includes a national science centre, 100ft millennium
Tower, business park, cinema, planetarium, hotel, restaurants, and
bridge across the Clyde.
A commission spokesman said only that it was likely some decisions
involving the Scottish applications will be controversial.
All were supposed yesterday to receive official notification of
success or failure in making the short leet for funds towards projects
to mark the year 2000.
However, many claimed not to have received letters from the
London-based commission which will outline this morning at a press
conference those going forward to the last stage of the process. Final
decisions will be taken in late July or early August.
Mr Sandy Orr, of Edinburgh-based MacDonald Orr Ltd, which lodged the
application for the #20m ''Gateway to the Highlands and Islands,'' was
shocked that the application for #10m towards the visitor centre was
rejected.
Supporters included the Scottish Tourist Board and Argyll and Islands
Enterprise, and private companies and trusts were expected to put #2m
into the project at Ganaven Sands, Oban.
Mr Orr said: ''There was huge support for it from all relevant local
andnational bodies. Everyone wanted it because the benefits would be
spread throughout the Highlands. There will be widespread dismay at the
decision.''
Mr Orr added: ''We will have to see the other results before deciding
what to do. We will discuss with local authorities and others what to do
to procure this project, an exceptional one for the Highlands.
''Huge sums of money are available through the lottery, and we will
address the problem of how to resource this project.''
At the Gaelic College in Skye, which wanted to create a world study
centre, finance and administration manager Sandy Nicolson said: ''We are
very disappointed. We thought it was an imaginative and well-produced
project that met the criteria.
''A lot of support had been expressed. It is not going to die just
because the application was turned down, but obviously fundings will be
made more difficult.''
Highlands and Islands Enterprise took heart from the commission's
suggestion to reapply at a later date for money towards a University
that would cover numerous colleges by teaching via computers. The
rejection merely puts the schedule back, according to sources determined
that the scheme will not fall.
Asset, Scotland's first Enterprise Trust, won through with its Nobel
Project application in Ayrshire following the rundown of major employer
ICI Nobel's Explosives at Ardeer.
The trust wants a #5m millennium contribution towards a #19.5 scheme
which includes a business park, further education college, and
state-of-the-art exhibition centre. The centre will embrace 1000 years
of inventions and discoveries; a century of Nobel laureates'
achievements, and a history of explosions from the big bang to space
exploration.
Asset's partners range from Ayrshire Enterprise and local councils to
the private sector, with European funding also being sought.
Mr Cairns Campbell, Asset's chief executive, said: ''I am absolutely
delighted. A lot of work has been put in, and we are very pleased to
have reached this stage. However, there is no guarantee of success. We
still face strong opposition.''
Glasgow Zoopark was also a winner with the Zoological Society of
Glasgow's plans for a #3m ''millennium Ark,'' a conservation discovery
centre.
The zoopark, at Calderpark, wants about #1m towards an undercover
education centre.
Park director Richard O'Grady said the society was extremely pleased
at reaching this stage, but warned it could still fall.
The Millennium Forest's plans range from a major expansion of native
woodland to education centres and environmental improvements.
One source last night described the result as brilliant, but added:
''We are over the second fence, but there is another hurdle to go. We
would hope to go the full distance after detailed scrutiny of
projects.''
The consortium includes the Woodland Trust, the World Wide Fund for
Nature, the National Trust for Scotland, and the RSPB, and is backed by
Scottish Natural Heritage and the Forestry Commission.

THE Government hinted last night that it might reconsider the early
release of terrorist prisoners in Northern Ireland if there were a
decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.
The signal came from Ulster Political Affairs Minister Michael Ancram
after he met political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries.
While he insisted there would be no trade-off, he said that if the
weapons were gone the Government could look again at the prisoners
issue.
The Government has insisted since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires last
year that prisoners convicted by the courts must serve their sentences.
However, speaking at Stormont after meeting the loyalists, Mr Ancram
said: ''If there is a handing in of weapons or a decommissioning of
weapons, then obviously that will have an impact on the level of risk
that exists within Northern Ireland and that must itself have an impact,
in turn, on prison policy and on the review we would then undertake.''
He added: ''When an environment is created in which you can do certain
things that you couldn't do before, then it's right that you should look
at those.''
Mr Ancram made his comments hours after Sinn Fein President Gerry
Adams ruled out even a symbolic decommissioning of IRA weapons as a
means to open the way to substantial political dialogue.
He said such a gesture ''would symbolise an IRA surrender''.
Writing in yesterday's Irish Times, Mr Adams said it would be
''unacceptable and reprehensible'' if Westminster were allowed to hold
up progress towards a lasting peace over a demand for a symbolic
gesture.
''Of course the British Government is not simply interested in a
gesture. It is demanding the start of a surrender process as a
precondition to all-party talks,'' he wrote.
''It is, in reality, attempting to achieve by stealth what it could
not achieve in 25 years of military conflict.''
However, Security Minister Sir John Wheeler said arms remained ''the
most important issue'' and said there would have to be ''some actual
surrender of semtex and weaponry'' before serious talks could begin.
''Those conditions have not changed and they will remain unchanged,''
he added.
He said people demanded evidence that the paramilitary ceasefires were
permanent and he said the Government was prepared to help the terrorists
find a way to give up their arms.
He was supported by Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew, who said
that people failed to understand why terrorists wanted to hang on to
weapons if they had, as they said, called a halt for good.
Irish Premier John Bruton also insisted yesterday that UK-Irish
relations were not being damaged by differences over the case of
convicted murderer Private Lee Clegg.

DEBT problems for individuals and families has increased sharply,
Citizens Advice Scotland, the Scottish association of citizens advice
bureaux, said yesterday in a report.
The number of clients visiting Cabx with multiple debt problems has
trebled over the last 10 years, from 28,057 in 1984/85 to 87,050 in
1994/95, CAS said. It blamed recent legislative changes for increasing
debt problems.
Mr Martyn Evans, chief executive officer of CAS, said debt now affects
people in every walk of life. People on low pay and benefit had been
hardest hit.
Legislation such as the Child Support Act and the Bankruptcy Act
(Scotland) 1993 had widened the net and threat of indebtedness.
''Citizens Advice Scotland believes a more informed and sensitive
environment is needed from Government and the credit industry both to
prevent and relieve indebtedness,'' he said.

BABCOCK Rosyth Defence Ltd has beaten its main rival Devonport Royal
Dockyard to win a #10m Ministry of Defence contract for the major refit
of a Type 22 frigate.
Management and unions were last night celebrating the contract for
work on HMS Coventry, which safeguards 150 jobs for the next 12 months.
Babcock Rosyth managing director David Batty said: ''We have been able
to reduce timescales and costs whilst improving our quality. We are
clearly able to offer the Ministry of Defence good value for money.
''This is tremendous news for Rosyth. We are well on the way to
building our position as the UK's major surface ship refitters.''
He said it was the fourth time Babcock and Devonport had gone head to
head in competitive tendering for MoD contracts, with the score standing
at two each.
However, Mr Batty was quick to point out that the value of the Rosyth
contracts far exceeded those won by Devonport.
He stressed the contract was not part of a guaranteed package of 18
major refits over 12 years by the Ministry of Defence when Devonport was
awarded the multi-million pound Trident submarine contract last year.
There was disappointment from bosses at Devonport, who were unhappy at
not having made it three in a row.

THE families of the police and Army intelligence officers killed in
last year's Chinook helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre have
suffered a further blow over compensation.
At least three insurance companies have refused to make life assurance
payments on the basis the victims were travelling in a military
aircraft, according to Mr Aidan Canavan, a Belfast solicitor
representing some of the bereaved families.
However, the widows are claiming the Ministry of Defence plans to
restrict its damages payments to them on the grounds that the servicemen
were travelling on a civilian aircraft.
A number of the widows claimed at a press conference last week that
the Ministry of Defence is proposing to limit its damages paid for each
victim to around #100,000 on the grounds that under the Warsaw
Convention, according to the Government's legal experts, their husbands
were effectively fare-paying passengers on a civilian flight when they
died.
The official report into the crash, in which 29 servicemen died on
their way from RAF Aldergrove to a security conference in Inverness, is
due to be published today.
It is expected to say the pilot may have mistakenly entered the wrong
co-ordinates on the in-board computer system -- the system used by
pilots to help them locate their position -- but to add that a
combination of other factors may have contributed to the accident.
The 29 killed when the Chinook crashed into a remote hillside included
senior officers of the Royal Uster Constabulary, MI5, Army intelligence,
and the Northern Ireland Office, as well as four RAF crewmen.
The Government is currently under considerable pressure to review the
terms of the damages proposed by the Ministry of Defence but the refusal
of some of the insurance companies to offer any compensation whatsoever
has heightened the widows' anguish, according to Mr Canavan.
In a letter to the Prime Minister, he has warned him that the
experience and treatment of the widows could have ramifications for
civil servants, police, and soldiers who may still have to use
helicopters as a form of transport.
Mr Canavan said: ''This is nothing short of a scandal and an outrage.
The suffering of these widows has been increased because they have been
caught up in a Catch 22 situation. The Ministry of Defence is seeking to
avoid its responsibilities by designating that this Chinook was a
civilian aircraft, while reputable insurance companies are avoiding
their responsibilities by designating it as a military aircraft. It is
an unbelievable state of affairs.''

Moscow, Wednesday
RUSSIA has put its troops in the north Caucasus region on full alert
after about 100 armed men raided the south Russian town of Budennovsk
today, killing at least 40 people and fleeing with up to 200 hostages.
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets told an emergency meeting
of law enforcement agencies in Moscow that the attackers were demanding
the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya.
However, a spokesman for rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev denied
responsibility for the attack.
The gunmen are holding hostages in the town's hospital and have
threatened to kill them if so much as one of the gunmen died.
Soskovets said 20 policemen had been killed. Tass quoted sources in
Budennovsk as saying 20 residents had died near the town hall alone.
Tass said the gunmen infiltrated Budennovsk in two trucks accompanied
by a stolen police jeep before spraying people with gunfire and seizing
several local administration buildings.
Interfax news agency said they had fled with the hostages, heading
towards Chechnya, whose northern border is only 45 miles from the town.
When President Boris Yeltsin launched the campaign against Chechnya
six months ago, one of the reasons he gave was the need to clamp down on
what he described as Chechen terrorism and organised crime.
Fears that the rebels might strike in the rest of Russia were revived
after Dudayev was quoted as saying that his men would continue fighting
using ''other methods''.
Police spokeswoman Zoya Novikova said in the regional capital
Stavropol that one of the gunmen had declared ''on behalf of the Chechen
people that all the hostages would be shot dead if Russian troops did
not stop military operations in Chechnya''.
There was no confirmation that the gunmen had any link to the Chechen
rebels. -- Reuter.

A SCOTS patient is the first woman discovered to have inherited a gene
mutation for breast cancer from both parents.
The woman, now 34, was diagnosed two years ago as having the disease
and has recovered after treatment.
Now scientists at the Beatson Research Institute on the outskirts of
Glasgow have discovered that she is probably unique in Scotland and
could hold the key to many fresh discoveries about how breast cancer
occurs.
About four in 100 cases of breast cancer are thought to be caused by
inherited gene mutations -- including BRCA1, identified just a few
months ago -- passed on by one or other of their parents.
The genes come in pairs, one from each parent, and a woman who is
heterozygous to this gene mutation -- that is, has inherited it from one
parent --has an 80% chance of developing breast cancer, as well as a 70%
chance of a developing ovarian cancer. This particular woman is
homozygous -- both BRCA1 genes have the mutation.
The discovery is reported in this week's issue of the scientific
journal Nature and yesterday, Dr Donald Black, head of the Beatson's
Cancer Molecular Genetics Group, said: ''It is the first case ever found
of a woman homozygous for a mutation of the BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17.
''She has no normal copy of the gene in her body and had breast cancer
at the age of 32. The risk appears to be similar to that of heterzygotes
for the same mutation.''
The woman already has seen both breast and ovarian cancer sweep
through her family -- her mother had ovarian cancer at 42, and four out
of six maternal aunts also had one or other disease. All five are dead.
One of these aunts suffered both types and another had two attacks of
breast cancer. That aunt's daughter has survived two attacks, the second
when she was 44.
A cousin on the woman's father's side had ovarian cancer at 22. In
addition -- but unconnected to the gene -- both her grandfathers and an
uncle died from throat or lung cancer.
The scientists, who have been screening individuals from Scots
families affected by breast and ovarian cancer, tracked down the two
genes using a painstaking process to amplify their DNA using polymerase
chain reaction.
A simplified test that will enable women to be screened routinely for
the gene if there is a family history has been the target of cancer
specialists since the BRCA1 mutation was discovered last year.
The gene itself normally encodes a protein of 1863 amino acids, whose
function is unknown, but in the mutant form it is switched off.
The Beatson scientists hope to get some cells from their subject in
order to study this process and identify any proteins which are being
switched on and off.
''That will be important in identifying the other biochemical
functions which relate to breast or ovarian tumour cells,'' said Dr
Black.
''We are now trying to find out what the missing function is. So far,
we haven't a clue but if we find it we are on our way to finding a means
of replacing it and preventing the cancer from developing.
''We found this woman had inherited the same mutation from both her
parents. This suggests there was a common ancestor somewhere in the
past.''
The woman has made a full recovery after treatment and still has both
breasts and ovaries. This means the threat of a recurrence remains but
other studies have shown that, while the age of onset goes down from one
generation to the next, a daughter's chances of developing familial
breast cancer will recede after she has passed the age at which her
mother was diagnosed.
The scientists also have been researching a protein marker called
CA125, which is near BRCA1 in the chromosome 17 and was a candidate for
the role which BRCA1 eventually filled. Now, it emerges, CA125 may have
a role in the non-inherited varieties of breast cancer, the vast
majority.

AS ONE of Scotland's top drug dealers was jailed for 12 years
yesterday, the hunt was on to trace his hidden millions.
Robert Maxwell, 38, it was revealed yesterday, was so rich from his
trade in heroin that he was able to gamble #5m in five years on the
horses.
As he was led away from the High Court in Glasgow, where he admitted
trafficking in heroin worth #2.5m, Maxwell boasted to other prisoners:
''My life of luxury will continue inside, and I'll still be a
millionaire when I get out.''
However, if the authorities get their way, Maxwell, of Saracen Street,
Possil, Glasgow, could be stripped of all he owns.
Just before he was sentenced, he was handed an application for a
confiscation order. This gave details of Maxwell's financial position
and outlined the vast fortunes he spent on gambling.
Crown prosecutor Stephen MacGibbon asked Lord Osborne to order Maxwell
to lodge written answers explaining his financial affairs over the last
five years.
This has to be done by July 12 and a hearing has been fixed at the
High Court in Edinburgh for the following day.
Maxwell, who hasn't had a job for years, was caught by undercover
police at the end of a surveillance operation.
They pounced in a Glasgow pub as Maxwell swopped a bag containing
#20,000 with Dundee-born James Connolly, 48, for another bag containing
the five kilos of heroin.
Connolly, of Newington Green, Islington, London, who was on trial for
three days, claimed in evidence that he was a ticket tout and not a
heroin courier.
The jury unanimously found him guilty.
Lord Osborne jailed him for six years and said that, although he
accepted Connolly was just a courier and didn't enjoy any of the high
profits from the drugs, he was nevertheless an important part in the
evil trade.
Maxwell, who pleaded guilty at the start of the trial, claimed through
his defence QC, Mr Donald Findlay that he, too, was only a courier.
Mr Findlay said Maxwell was a compulsive gambler who had been snared
by drug barons to pay off his debts.
Lord Osborne clearly did not believe Maxwell, who had already served
seven years for a drug offence.
He pointed out that the seizure was the second largest made by
Strathclyde Police in recent years and added: ''It appears to me that
you have taken an important part in the evil trade of supplying drugs in
this city and, inevitably, your activities will have contributed to the
damage and misery which has been created by this trade.''
Lord Osborne told Maxwell that he had not learned the lesson of his
seven-year sentence for drugs and that his conduct showed outright
defiance of the criminal law.
A senior Strathclyde Police detective said last night: ''Maxwell was a
major player in drugs for years. We are delighted he has been put
away.''
The moment he was arrested, a special team of detectives from the
force's financial investigation unit moved in to look at Maxwell's money
affairs.
While outwardly he didn't display any great signs of wealth -- he
lived in a council flat -- Maxwell had money to burn.
He lived like a lord in Possilpark, one of the most deprived,
drug-ridden areas of Europe, driving around in taxis and treating his
pals to drinks.
He had two cars, a large wardrobe, and inquiries revealed he had
gambled a staggering #5m in five years.
Police believe he still has money stashed away and any discovered in
the future can be confiscated by the Crown authorities.

A SCOTTISH pressure group launched a campaign yesterday to stop a huge
consignment of nuclear waste, unwanted in America, from being sent to
Dounreay for reprocessing.
A spokesperson for Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping said that up to 30
lorryloads a year of the most highly radioactive weapons-grade material
in the world would turn the Caithness plant into ''Europe's
contamination capital for the twenty-first century''.

ATOMIC Energy Authority officials at Dounreay did not tell the
Government body investigating childhood leukemia around the plant in
1987 of the existence of its controversial nuclear waste shaft, let
alone the explosion in it in 1977.
In the damning report published on Tuesday, the Committee on Medical
Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (Comare) expressed serious
concern that its Second Report published in 1988 on childhood leukemia
did not have all the relevant evidence.
Accusing the UKAEA of having neglected its reponsibilities, Professor
Bryn Bridges, chairman of Comare, confirmed yesterday that the agency
had wrongly led it to believe that the source of radioactive particles
found on the foreshore had come from an accidental spillage in 1965.
Part of the Comare Second Report states: ''We asked the UKAEA for
details of any unplanned or experimental releases which had not been
included in the discharges showed in tables A3 (2-4) and which might
have had off-site radiological consequences.
''UKAEA have reviewed their records and provided us with the details
which are at A3.3 in the Annexe. This also includes their assessment of
any environmental impact from these incidents.''
Tables A3, however, reveal no mention of the waste shaft.
Professor Bridges said yesterday: ''I think that the committee is
certainly concerned that the conclusions it came to in its Second Report
might possibly have been different if it had known certain facts that it
didn't know.
''It is not so much that the UKAEA didn't tell us about the shaft.
They led us to believe that the source of the radioactive particles
found on the foreshore was an accidential spillage in 1965 which had
been hosed down a drain in the road by the local fire brigade. That is
where they said the particles were coming from.''
Professor Bridges said Comare had begun to doubt the veracity of that
information after studies between 1992 and 1994 about links between
child leukemia and use of beaches around Dounreay, adding that it later
transpired that the UKAEA had already had a number of possible sources
at the time of the Second Report on Dounreay.
''They allowed us to go on thinking that the 1965 spillage was the
source of the particles even when they themselves knew that there were
other possible sources which were more likely, one of which was the
shaft.
''They did not know the source themselves and they did not tell Comare
that. A group such as ours can only do its job properly if it is given
all the information it requires and there is no doubt that we were
severely hindered.''
He continued: ''We also feel they neglected their responsibilities
because, having got a number of potential hypotheses, they did not take
that any further.
''Would it have made any difference to our final conclusions? The
answer is no. We don't think that these particles on the foreshore are
the cause of the excess childhood leukemia. However, if we had known at
the time that the source of the particles was not established we would
certainly have made strong recommendations to find the source and
eliminate that.''
Professor Bridges added that, although the current UKAEA management
had been very helpful, ''I would say that the UKAEA's attitude in the
1980s was very unprofessional -- much lower than one would expect from a
body as theoretically responsible as them.''
Dounreay's management yesterday responded to Comare's criticism by
saying management at the time had given the group all relevant
information in terms of Comare's specific requests.
Mr Ian Shepherd, a Dounreay spokesman, stressed that the current
management was not at Dounreay at the time but had studied all the
records available to their predecessors and believed there had been no
intention to mislead Comare in 1987.
He said he was unable to say why there had been no reference to the
shaft in drawings made available to Comare but suggested that this may
have been because Comare had asked for information about active
facilities while the shaft ceased to be in active use in 1977.
''You have to measure what was provided against what was asked for by
Comare,'' he added.
Mr Shepherd said Comare had requested details of unplanned discharges
and Dounreay responded by giving details of such discharges, including
reference to one which was linked to metallic particles which had
occasionaly been found on the Dounreay foreshore.
''The Comare request therefore was in connection with any unplanned
discharges and was not a dedicated investigation into the metallic
particles found on the beach.
''Information provided by the authority to Comare at that time was
therefore judged to be sufficient for the purpose of that inquiry.
According to records at Dounreay, when Comare visited the site in
November 1987 they received a presentation which included a section on
beach particles and in the notes of that meeting it is stated 'their
composition and the methods by which they might have been deposited was
described.'
''This, therefore, suggests that Comare were told of several possible
sources, although we believe the breach of a plastic pipeline in 1965
was at that time considered to be the most likely source of the
particles. We have no doubt that this opinion would have been passed on
to Comare.''

TWO police officers were cleared yesterday of the manslaughter of

A jury at the Old Bailey returned the not guilty verdicts on Detective

A Scotland Yard spokesman said the pair -- who have been suspended
from duty for almost two years since Mrs Gardner's death -- would now be
reinstated, pending a Police Complaints Authority (PCA) decision on
whether they should face disciplinary action.
Mother-of-two Mrs Gardner died when her heart failed after police
officers came to her house and bound her mouth with tape as they tried
to deport her to her native Jamaica on July 28, 1993. During a violent
struggle, Mrs Gardner was trussed up in leather restraint belts and
handcuffs after lashing out and biting the officers.
Yesterday, the chairman of the Metropolitan Branch of the Police
Federation bitterly attacked the decision to prosecute the officers. Mr
Mike Bennett said they were ''scapegoats for a system that was approved
at the highest level'' and claimed the case was ''not so much a
prosecution, it was a persecution''.
''The actual investigation and decision to prosecute was straight out
of the Pontius Pilate book of justice. Everyone seemed to wash their
hands of them,'' he claimed.
Outside the court, Mrs Gardner's mother, Mrs Myrna Simpson, 57, said
she would continue to fight for justice. ''It's not the end of the case.
I'm fighting till I die for justice for Joy'', she said.
Mrs Simpson said she was ''disgusted and really saddened'' by the
verdict and she accused the judge and jury of being biased.
''It was biased from the beginning. The jury were biased and the judge
was telling them from the beginning to release the officers,'' she
alleged.
However, by their verdict, the jury decided that a reasonable person
would not inevitably have recognised the use of a gag was dangerous and
put Mrs Gardner at a real risk of suffering some physical harm.
Three officers -- Miss Evans, 41, from the Extradition Unit, and Mr
Whitby, 48, and Constable John Burrell, 43, from the Alien Deportation
Group -- were charged with her manslaughter almost a year after their
suspension.
Their trial did not start until another year had passed.
Mr Burrell was cleared at the end of the prosecution case on the order
of the judge, Mr Justice Mantell.
''All three officers are very relieved that 22 months of pain and
suffering has come to an end,'' said Mr Bennett.
He said the three officers had been very bitter about the way they had
been treated.
''They had a Home Office warrant and were using equipment approved by
the Home Office.''
The prosecution had alleged Mrs Gardner died after being gagged with
13ft of plaster tape wound round her head in different directions at
least seven times.
All three officers had denied manslaughter.
Miss Evans and Mr Whitby told the jury Mrs Gardner had been in ''a
fury'' and would not listen to reason when they forced their way into
her home in the early morning.
Miss Evans, a graduate with 17 years' police service, said Mrs Gardner
was the most violent prisoner she had ever encountered.
Mr Whitby -- who had served 19 years in the Metropolitan police --
said he had called ''deck her'' after Mrs Gardner ripped off her
tee-shirt, lashed out, and attempted to bite officers trying to restrain
her.
He managed to get her into handcuffs attached to a belt round her
waist and straps round her thighs and ankles as she continued to
struggle and bang her head on the floor.
The officer said he decided to gag her as a last resort because he
feared she would injure herself and bite his colleague -- Mr Burrell --
who was trying to hold her head.
''This lady was going to do anything to try and frustrate the
deportation,'' said PC Whitby.
The court was told it was the first time anyone had been gagged in
their own home by police during deportation. Gags were sometimes used on
aircraft for deportees who threatened to disrupt the flight -- and in
exceptional circumstances -- off an aircraft when the officers feared
biting.
Mrs Simpson's solicitor, Ms Jane Coker, said civil proceedings would
now be brought against the Home Office Immigration Service and the
police on behalf of Mrs Gardner's seven-year-old son, Graeme.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon said: ''This has been
a tragic and painful experience for all those concerned -- particularly
for the family and friends of Joy Gardner, for whom the pain was perhaps
greater because of the circumstances and the publicity surrounding it.
''This has also been a difficult and harrowing two years not only for
the officers who were suspended and facing manslaughter charges but for
their families and colleagues.''
He stressed that lessons had been learned and new measures had been
introduced following a review of deportation operations.
The Metropolitan Police also restated its ''deep regret'' at Mrs
Gardner's death.
The work of the deportation group remains suspended, as it has been
since an investigation into the case.
Black MP Bernie Grant said there was fury in the black community at
the verdicts and he warned that people in future ''may find other ways
of expressing their anger''.
Mr Grant, MP for Tottenham, north London, speaking at the House of
Commons, said: ''It is becoming increasingly commonplace for the deaths
of black people in custody to go unpunished.
''There is a feeling that a black life is worth nothing.''

THE pressure group Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping (Sand) yesterday
launched a public campaign to prevent the shipment of up to 9000 spent
nuclear fuel pins from America to Dounreay for reprocessing.
Sand issued the call amid stinging criticism of the Caithness plant's
20-year stewardship of nuclear waste by two government watchdog bodies.
According to Sand the pins represent the most dangerous configuration of
nuclear waste.
They had been used in nuclear sites throughout Europe and elsewhere
and were to be sent back to the US, their country of origin.
However, a public consultation in America is expected to result in a
refusal to accept the waste. The consultation ends on Tuesday.
Sand claimed Dounreay and the Department of Trade and Industry had
been lobbying Washington to have the highly radioactive waste brought to
Dounreay from all over the world.
''As far as Scots are concerned the effects will be substantial,''
said Sand spokeswoman Mrs Lorraine Mann.
''Up to 9000 fuel pins may be involved; up to 30 lorryloads a year of
some of the most radioactive weapons-grade material in the world will be
transported the length of Scotland to reach Dounreay.
''Much of the waste will be routinely dumped into the sea as
'authorised discharges' to be washed up around Orkney, Shetland, and the
eastern seaboard of mainland Scotland; waste consignments will last well
into the next century, making Dounreay Europe's contamination capital
for the twenty-first century.''
Mrs Mann roundly rebuked the Dounreay management for trying to win the
business.
''We have here a management that has been roundly condemned by the
regulatory agencies for incompetence and profound lack of candour and a
plant which is at least 15 years past its sell-by date.
''It is beyond belief that AEA should be allowed to place people in
Caithness and throughout Scotland at further risk by carrying out this
extremely dangerous process.''
Mrs Mann said that only three weeks ago Dounreay made a presentation
to Highland Regional Council's Dounreay liaison committee, but failed to
mention the US consultation.
''This is typical of the routine dishonesty and deceit we have come to
associate with Dounreay.
''They knew of the consultation. They can't possibly have believed
Highland Regional Council wouldn't be interested. And yet they withheld
the information that would allow HRC to make any comment,'' she said.
A DTI spokeswoman denied the department had been involved in any
lobbying exercise to win the reprocessing work.
''But it would be entirely open to Dounreay to make approaches in the
US themselves. They wouldn't have needed any sort of clearance from
us.''
The UKAEA said yesterday that, at the last meeting of Highland
Regional Council's liaison committee, Dounreay site director Mr John
Baxter had made it clear that he was seeking additional work for the
site and the subject of reprocessing work was mentioned.
Dounreay spokesman Mr Ian Shepherd said: ''We hope to win extra work
for the site, including reprocessing, worth between #20m and #90m.
''At the moment we don't know if we are going to be offered this work
so it would be unwise to make any reference to it.
''But if it is, clearly it would be a very positive situation because
it would be good for employment prospects on the site.
''We would wish to have this business if it was offered to us.''
Mr Shepherd confirmed that the UKAEA had been ''trying to win the
business'', adding that the authority would have a waste return policy
which would mean any high-level waste after reprocessing would be
returned to the country involved. ''So we would not be storing waste
here that was generated by this activity.''
UKAEA officials had also met a US delegation visiting Dounreay on a
fact-finding mission in February to prepare an environmental impact
statement.
He added that, at Dounreay, the authority had a plant that was already
fulfilling this kind of contract and had done so successfully and safely
while also enhancing local employment.

<HEADLINE>Boy raped while fishing</HEADLINE>

A 13-YEAR-OLD boy was raped and beaten while fishing at a secluded
stream in a West Yorkshire village made famous by the Bronte sisters.
The boy was threatened with a knife or cut-throat razor and sexually
assaulted on the banks of the River Worth, just yards from the main road
in the centre of Haworth.
The man left along the river bank, leaving the boy cowering in bushes,
too afraid to move.
Locals heard him whimpering and were shocked when he emerged from the
bushes covered in blood.
He was taken to the nearby Millet Fishbar, where Mr Stuart Todd, 25,
who works at the bar, called for an ambulance and the police.
Mr Todd said the fishbar had just opened at about 6.30pm on Tuesday
when an elderly customer arrived saying he could hear someone crying in
bushes by the river.
The youngster was crying out: ''Help me, help me,'' Mr Todd said. At
first, they thought it was someone joking.
Then he said: ''This lad came out, he was absolutely covered in blood.
He was a real mess. There was blood flowing down his cheeks and matted
in his hair.''
Mr Todd said the boy told them he had been fishing after school when
he was approached by a man.
He said the man told him: ''You'll never catch anything there son. The
water is too dirty.'' Then he pulled out what looked like a cut-throat
razor.
Mr Todd said that when the man produced the blade, the schoolboy threw
a brick, which hit the bespectacled man and cut his head.
He added: ''The lad told us, 'I thought he was trying to kill me. He
had a knife at my throat'.''
Mr Todd said the boy hid in bushes because he did not want the man to
attack him again. ''He was well in shock was the poor lad. There wasn't
a lot I could do except try to comfort him until the ambulance and the
police arrived.''
Another resident who was shopping at a nearby terrace of shops in the
village, said: ''This is a terrible thing. Howarth is usually a sleepy
little hollow. You just don't believe anything like this is going to
happen.''
After the attack, the boy was taken to Airedale General hospital where
he was able to give detectives a detailed description of the attacker.
The boy is from the Keighley area and was still in hospital yesterday
with bruises, cuts, and lacerations to his head and bruising to his
body, arms, and legs. His parents were still at his bedside.
The boy's condition last night was said to be stable but he is likely
to stay in hospital for another day.
The attack happened 50 yards from the railway station, which is a
popular tourist attraction.
Last night, police said a man had been charged in connection with the
attack.
A 48-year-old from the Bradford area is to appear before Keighley
magistrates today.
